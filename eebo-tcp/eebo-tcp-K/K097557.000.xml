            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS I would not inſult your ſingular countenance with any thing like the appearance of a bluſh, I inform you that the following pages are not ſacrificed to you as a compliment, but entirely due to you as a moſt diſtinguiſhed character. The poſition, I believe, will ſtand uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that there is not another man ſo circumſtanced in the three kingdoms, on whom they would not ſit aukward. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conſequences we derive from an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the primary cauſe ſhould neither be neglected, nor forgotten. Immortal deeds, I own, have been atchieved by the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſinews of military veterans; but an acquiſition of empire or honours, we rather owe to the wiſdom of the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> than the mechanical proweſs of the Troops.</p>
            <p>The actions of your life, previous to the AFFRAY in point, have given you that rank in the Annals of <hi>Modern</hi> HEROISM, which your generalſhip, had it been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in this inſtance, could ſcarcely ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</p>
            <p>Human policy, however circumſpect, is ſubject to diſaſters; and, therefore, we
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0241800700:3"/>
wonder not, that this your laſt undertaking, although truly meritorious and momentous, has fatally miſcarried. But I am no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary ſycophant, and can therefore accoſt the great man with honeſt panegyric, tho' ſucceſs keep not equal pace with his merits. Be it my buſineſs, therefore, in this offering, to proclaim,—<hi>That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi> LYTTLETON <hi>the</hi> II. d <hi>failed, it was neither from ignorance nor inattention, but ſome over-ruling neceſſity.</hi>—</p>
            <p>I have the vanity to imagine, that theſe ſheets will find their way to all thoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious places on the continent, which, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once known you, will eagerly ſnatch the future anecdotes of a man, rendered a glaring phaenomenon throughout Europe. The ſhades of <hi>Hagley</hi> I could wiſh ſacred from their approach: For the muſes will fly abaſhed their wonted groves;—the venerable and noble Peer muſt weep blood at that unnatural portrait, where the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal</hi> inſultingly refuſes the repeated offers of forgiveneſs, and the virtuous robes of reſtoration—inſolently approaching his aged ſire, with the tattered garb of every ſtudied, and poſſible deformity.—</p>

            <head>THE VAUXHALL AFFRAY; OR, MACARONIES DEFEATED.</head>
            <p>THE following paragraph appearing in the MORNING CHRONICLE of <hi>Tueſday, July</hi> 27, opened the literary campaign, in which the Maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roni forces have ſo fatally ſuffered.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"THAT the public may not be mis-informed by the news collectors of an affray and its conſequences, which happened at <hi>Vauxhall</hi> laſt <hi>Friday</hi> night, the following is declared to be the truth of the whole.—Mrs. <hi>Hartley,</hi> the celebrated actreſs, being in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with others, among whom was the Rev. Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> and Mr. <hi>Colman,</hi> was put out of countenance, by what ſhe deemed the impudent looks of four or five gentlemen, who purpoſely placed themſelves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to her, which obliged her to appeal to Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> on the occaſion, who, obſerving as ſhe did, aroſe and ſeated himſelf between her and theſe rude-looking gentlemen, who taking offence at this,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0241800700:5"/>
got up one by one, and reconnoitred him with all poſſible contempt, telling him, the ſaid <hi>Bate,</hi> that he looked like a ſtout, tight-made fellow, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, no doubt, of bruiſing; to which Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, They were four impertinent puppies, and could not be gentlemen for their behaviour to Mrs. <hi>Hartley,</hi> &amp;c. This brought on a general diſpute, which was divided into <hi>three acts,</hi> till at laſt a gentleman, one Captain <hi>Crofts,</hi> addreſſed himſelf to Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> and aſked him, Whether he meant any thing againſt him? who was anſwered, No: however, Capt. <hi>Crofts,</hi> perhaps imprudently, made himſelf a principal with the reſt, and after much ill language had paſſed, brought upon himſelf an expreſſion of anger from Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> that he would wring him by the noſe: addreſſes were then given; very ſcurrilous language was received by Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> afterwards in the Gardens, a challenge was ſent to him the next morning, and an appointment made in the afternoon at the Turk's Head Coffee-houſe, Strand, where Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> with a friend, Mr. <hi>Dawes,</hi> waited with punctuality for near an hour, when Captain <hi>Crofts,</hi> in company with the honourable Mr. <hi>Lyttleton,</hi> came in: a ſhort recapitulation began between Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> and Capt. <hi>Crofts,</hi> who were interrupted by Mr. <hi>Lyttleton,</hi> as ſecond to the latter, by deſiring that a criſis ſhould be made without words; that Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> ſhould aſk the Captain's pardon in the papers, or name his weapon, and go with him in half an hour. Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> in a very manly way, refuſed begging par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where no offence was given; but after expatiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the impropriety of his deciding the difference as a clergyman in a military manner, waved a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his profeſſion in defence of his honour, and agreed to adjourn with Captain <hi>Crofts,</hi> to ſuch
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0241800700:6"/>
place as ſhould be appointed by the ſeconds, Mr. <hi>Dawes</hi> for Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lyttleton</hi> for the Captain; who, after exerting every thing in their power to prevent any ill conſequences, reduced the cauſes of quarrel and defence to writing, the better to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what ground they were to ſtand upon, as friends to the combatants, Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> being the whole time as impatient for deciſion as any man living, who had conceived himſelf injured; but juſt as Mr. <hi>Lyttleton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dawes</hi> were going out to chuſe their piſtols, the Hon. Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> broke in with apparent anger, and demanded ſatisfaction of Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> for his friend Capt. <hi>Miles;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Lyttleton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> remonſtrated with him on the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of giving that ſatisfaction, when Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> and Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi> were then going out; yet he inſiſted on his friend's having ſatisfaction firſt; to which Capt <hi>Crofts,</hi> replied, in a way that did him honour, that he was highly offended at the mode of Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi>'s calling on Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> after they had agreed to go out on one and the ſame quarrel, and ſaid that he never underſtood that one man was bound to fight a whole company, where the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed offence was given in groſs, and not in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> however continued his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſaying that his friend could not wait, and he was determined Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> ſhould not go out with Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi> till his affair was ſettled. From this circumſtance, Mr. <hi>Lyttleton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dawes</hi> then thinking, from the particulars they had heard on both ſides, a trifling acknowledgment that each was wrong, would be beſt, recommended it to the parties, who, with ſome difficulty complied, and were made friends. Thus ended matters relative to Capt. <hi>Crofts;</hi> and with reſpect to Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall,</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0241800700:7"/>
he declared, that had Capt. <hi>Crofts,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> and their ſeconds, Mr. <hi>Dawes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lyttleton,</hi> gone out, he would have prevented a duel, by putting the former under an arreſt. The former matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus ſettled, Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> deſired Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> to introduce his friend, who he alledged was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured. He anſwered, that it would be better with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, for that he was a hot-headed man, and might come to blows without ceremony. Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> however, inſiſted on ſeeing him, obſerving that he could not receive any violence from him, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious he had never offended him. On being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, he ſaid, unleſs Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> would box him, he would beat him in every public place he met him. Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> then ſaid, if he did, he would defend himſelf; for though he was capable of boxing, he never choſe to decide any differences that way, but with thoſe from whom he could have no other ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; ſtill, as Capt. <hi>Miles</hi> triumphed in this refuſal, Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> with very great reluctance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to meet him on his own terms, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly a long room was fixed on, and Mr. <hi>Dawes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> were to ſecond the bruiſers, who immediately prepared themſelves for battle, in the preſence of Mr. <hi>Lyttleton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. At firſt, the advantage ſeemed againſt Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> but a fair ſet-to for about twenty minutes, convinced the company (but particularly Capt. <hi>Miles</hi>) that Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> though inferior in ſize, was victorious, who never received one blow that he felt. Capt. <hi>Miles</hi> was ſent home in a coach, with his face a perfect jelly, and Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> was invited to dine with the Hon. Mr. <hi>Lyttleton</hi> on the morrow, as a proof of the applauſe he highly merited. A greater inſtance of true courage never
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0241800700:8"/>
appeared in man, than in Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proverb, <hi>etiam quos contra ſtatuit equos placatoſque demiſit,</hi> enforced the applauſe of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries."</q>

                              <p>BEING at <hi>Vauxhall Gardens</hi> on Friday evening laſt, I ſaw Mrs. <hi>Hartley</hi> (in company with Mr. <hi>Hartley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Colman,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tateham</hi>) ſeated on a bench, not very far diſtant from the orcheſtra. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pleaſure of her acquaintance, I joined the party and their converſation; when we preſently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved two gentlemen paſs by, and look at her in a manner not altogether genteel; however, as cuſtom has in ſome meaſure ridiculouſly indulged our fine gentlemen in theſe familiarities <hi>en paſſant,</hi> little or no notice was taken of it. Not ſatisfied with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, theſe gentlemen preſently returned, with two or three others of a military <hi>appearance,</hi> who all ſeated themſelves at a table directly oppoſite to her, and began an attack in form, reſolutely determined to ſtare her out of countenance. Situated in the middle of her company, ſhe bore this treatment for ſome minutes, before ſhe even complained to Mr. <hi>Hartley</hi> of her diſtreſs. Imagining that their triumph was near complete, he begged her to continue her ſeat, till the concluſion of the Cantata then ſinging, after which we would all retire. Theſe gallant heroes however ſtill continuing the ſiege, ſhe found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the diſagreeable neceſſity of addreſſing her friends generally, telling us, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>That the behaviour of theſe Gentlemen was ſo uncommonly rude, ſhe could bear it no longer.</hi>"</q> On this I turned my head, and diſcovered four of theſe pretty beings ſtaring at her

with that kind of <hi>petit maitre</hi> audacity, which no language, but the modern French, can poſſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe! and triumphing over thoſe female diſtreſſes which their proweſs had nobly occaſioned.</p>
                              <p>To be a ſilent ſpectator of ſuch inſolence, would be tacitly to countenance it; loudly therefore, in order that they might hear it, I obſerved to her, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that I begged ſhe would not be diſtreſſed, as I would prevent any future inſult of that nature."</q>—In conſequence of which, I immediately placed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on a ſeat directly between them and Mrs. <hi>Hartley.</hi> This was an intimation, that their behaviour was generally remarked; and I expected to find it at leaſt productive of the end intended; inſtead of which, I became now the ſubject of their loud horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laughs and wiſe remarks. Thus unpleaſantly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced, I thought it better to face theſe deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, and therefore turned about and looked them, in my turn, full in the face; in conſequence of which, ſome diſtortions of features, I believe, paſſed on both ſides.</p>
                              <p>Mrs. <hi>Hartley,</hi> during this latter tranſaction, roſe up, and made for the walk; obſerving which, I followed her, with the reſt of the company, firſt juſtly remarking as I quitted the ſcene, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>that they were four impertinent puppies.</hi>"</q> A gentleman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly followed me, whom I afterwards found to be Capt. <hi>Crofts,</hi> of Burgoyne's light dragoons, and aſked me, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Whether I addreſſed myſelf in that ſpeech to him?</hi>"</q>—To which I replied, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Certainly not; as I did not recollect to have ſeen him in the party.</hi>"</q>—Not ſatisfied with this anſwer, he again demanded, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Whether I called him a puppy?</hi>"</q>—To which I rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as before, adding however, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>That the only way to</hi>

                              </p>
                              <p>After this anſwer, Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi> obſerved, <hi>that I look'd very big upon the occaſion,</hi>—ſurveyed me, with a ſupercilious kind of air from head to foot, and then remarked, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>You are indeed a good tight fellow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mean to intimidate me I ſuppoſe, becauſe you are a boxer.</hi>"</q> To this he received for reply, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>that box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was by no means my plan; however, as he ſeemed determined not to be ſatisfied, but continued to follow me, if he ſpoke three more impertinent words to me, I would wring his noſe off his face.</hi>"</q>—On this he demanded my name and addreſs, which was inſtantly given him; I then drew off to my company, imagining that the affair would at leaſt ſtand peaceably over till the morrow.</p>
                              <p>Previous to our leaving the Gardens, which we intended to do immediately, we were under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of walking round, in ſearch of one of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; when at the further end of the walk, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered our former aſſailants, now made doubly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable by a conſiderable augmentation.—No ſooner did we approach, than they began a freſh attack with redoubled inſolence, interlarding their loud ſallies of pleaſantry, with <q rend="inline">"<hi>Twig the Curate,</hi> &amp;c."</q> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to this as long as human nature could do, at laſt I ſtopp'd ſhort, with a view of knocking down the firſt man that inſulted me; when Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi> touched me on the ſhoulder, called me by name, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0241800700:12"/>
begged to ſpeak another word with me, which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, by going back with him; he obſerved, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That he had forgotten my addreſs, which was the cauſe of this ſecond application on that ſubject."</q> I immediately told him again, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"No. 17, <hi>Clifford's-Inn;</hi> but deſired that he would now make ſure of it, by getting pen and ink from one of the waiters, and take it down;"</q> which he did accordingly.</p>
                              <p>During this tranſaction, a little effeminate being, whom I afterwards found to be a Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall,</hi> came up to me, dreſſed <hi>a la Macaroni,</hi> and impertinently aſked me, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Whether any man had not a right to look at a fine woman?"</q> After getting over my firſt ſurprize at this wanton interference of a man, who was not even preſent at the diſpute, I anſwered, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Moſt certainly; and that I deſpiſed the man who did not look at a fine woman; however, I begged leave to obſerve, that there were two diſtinct ways of looking at her—with <hi>admiration,</hi> and with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>authorized contempt:</hi>—that the conduct I cenſured, was ſtrongly of the latter kind; and on that I founded my opinion, that the offenders were <hi>four dirty impertinent puppies.</hi>"</q> On this, he conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially remarked, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That even <hi>he himſelf</hi> had been ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus, when <hi>he</hi> look'd at a fine woman."</q> To which I anſwered, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That I had not the leaſt doubt, but that he merited any obſervation which might be made to him on that head."</q> On this, he <hi>greatly</hi> anſwered, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That he would knock the raſcal down who dared to ſay ſo;"</q> and <hi>nobly</hi> put his hand to his ſword.</p>
                              <p>This <hi>intereſting</hi> conference was, for the moment, interrupted by Capt. <hi>Crofts,</hi> who obſerved, that he ſuppoſed I was a Clergyman. Receiving an anſwer in the affirmative, he ſaid, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Perhaps then, you will
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0241800700:13"/>
take the advantage of your profeſſion, and not give me the ſatisfaction I ſhall demand."</q> To which I replied, That he never ſhould find I availed myſelf of that, to act in any manner derogatory from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Gentleman.—Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came abundantly pleaſant on this diſcovery of my profeſſion, which I parried as well as I was able; and, in return, began to hold up this <hi>creature of all creatures</hi> to public deriſion. The dreſs, hat and feather,—miniature picture, pendant at his ſnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>white boſom, and a variety of other delicate appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages to this <hi>man of faſhion,</hi> were naturally ſeized upon by me, and ſet off to the beſt advantage.—Here, however, as the laugh grew warm againſt him, I was attacked by a <hi>bran-ſpan</hi> new face, another red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hot Hibernian, who was ſcarcely intelligible. His ignorance of our language, I believe, preſerved me from that inſolence, which his ſavage countenance ſtrongly menaced. Him however I ſoon cut ſhort, by obſerving, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that the affair could by no means concern him, and that therefore, he was an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent fellow</hi> for his pains."</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>The company who aſſembled round us, on this occaſion, being deſirous of knowing the cauſe of the diſpute, I told it them in a few words, and then appealed, whether I had not done as much as could be expected of me, even if wrong in the firſt inſtance, by giving my name and addreſs?—And whether Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall,</hi> or any indifferent perſon, had a right thus wantonly to interfere in a matter, in which he was by no means concerned?—So far ſenſible of the impropriety of his conduct, he was generally hooted by the whole company, and joſtled into the middle of the Gardens, where I left him to lament his folly; and immediately took coach, and returned with Mrs. <hi>Hartley,</hi> &amp;c. to town.</p>

this is to give you notice, that if you will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point your time and place, I will meet you upon your own terms; and if you do refuſe to give me the ſatisfaction I require, I will hunt you up and down London till I find you, and will then <hi>pull your noſe—ſpit in your face,</hi> and <hi>pull your black coat off your back.</hi>

                  <p>Though in expectation of ſome interview on the preceding night's <hi>fracas,</hi> and perhaps a recapitulation of circumſtances, yet I muſt confeſs, the ſtyle of this letter,—the bearer,—the time,—and mode of its delivery, ſtaggered me not a little.

I reſolved, therefore, to adjourn the <hi>ecclairciſſement</hi> of this matter to a place leſs exceptionable than my own chambers, and in the mean time, prevail upon ſome friend to be preſent at the interview.

                  <p>Immediately upon this, I repaired in ſearch of, and ſoon found Mr. <hi>Tateham,</hi> a gentleman who was preſent at the affray in the Gardens, and who readily accompanied me to dinner to the Turk's Head Coffee-houſe, in the Strand. On our arrival here, I gave orders to the waiters, that if any gentlemen inquired for me, to ſhew them to our room. In the courſe of our dinner, Mr. <hi>Dawes,</hi> a young gentleman of the law, and a friend of mine, hearing of the nature of the diſpute, and of my being there, ſent in his name, and begged to attend me through it; to this I will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly conſented, as Mr. <hi>Tateham</hi> was under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of going out of town that evening, and I knew not at a certainty when the matter might be finally decided.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this, Capt. <hi>Crofts,</hi> attended by his friend, (whom I afterwards found to be the Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mr. <hi>Lyttleton</hi>) arrived, who were immediately ſhewn in. After ſome cuſtomary civilities on each ſide, Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi> addreſſed me, by obſerving, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>That he ſuppoſed I knew the nature of his viſit.</hi>"</q>—To which I anſwered, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>I certainly did, if that letter which I had then in my hand was written by him, and contained his ſentiments.</hi>"</q>—He rejoined in the affirmative to both;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0241800700:18"/>
on which I remarked, that it was not poſſible then we could go out upon the terms he might require, until he had put ſome of his threats in execution.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Lyttleton</hi> on this warmly interfered; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>that this was not the time to recapitulate parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; the matter being ſimply reduced to one point, which, as Capt.</hi> Crofts<hi>'s friend, he was deputed to aſk me,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether I choſe to aſk Capt.</hi> Crofts<hi>'s par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in all the public papers, for ſaying I would wring his noſe off his face, or go out with him in half an hour?</hi>"</q>—To this peremptory demand, I directly replied:—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>That being ſenſible of no impropriety in this inſtance, I ſhould not make any conceſſion at all; nor did I think myſelf juſtified, after the treatment I had received in Capt.</hi> Crofts<hi>'s letter, to go out with him, till he had executed one of his threats; after which I would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend him.</hi>"</q>—</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Lyttleton</hi> on this begged leave to reduce the ſubſtance of the queſtion and anſwer to writing; which was done by him and me, in words nearly as above.—After this he aſked me, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Whether I was not now wrong in urging Capt.</hi> Crofts <hi>to ſtrike me; as from his ſituation in a military capacity, nothing but the life of one of us could atone for it?</hi>"</q>—To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>That having been in the army myſelf, I was not to be informed of the etiquette thereof in this particular; and was therefore apprized of the grounds on which I ſtood.</hi>"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>On this Mr. <hi>Lyttleton</hi> obſerved, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>that he muſt beg then I would go over to France, leſt the conſequence might prove fatal to his friend.</hi>"</q>—This new expedition however, I begged leave to wave, by informing him, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That ſenſible of the propriety of my conduct, I would by no means leave England, be the event what it would."</q>—Here Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi> interpoſed,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0241800700:19"/>
and ſaid, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The matter might be ſettled without ſuch an excurſion; for as a miſrepreſentation of my character had been the cauſe of his ſending me the above letter, and being now convinced that the reverſe of the report was the fact, he apologized for the error, and acquainted me, that he now looked upon me as a gentleman in every reſpect."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Immediately upon this, I took him by the hand, confeſſed his behaviour to be manly, and told him, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That as we could now go out as gentlemen, I was ready to attend him, according to his requeſt:"</q>—Then turning to Mr. <hi>Dawes,</hi> begged he would provide a caſe of piſtols, and any other neceſſaries that might be wanting. The Ring in Hyde Park being propoſed as the ground, I objected to it, for fear of interruption; and therefore recommended to Mr. <hi>Lyttleton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dawes,</hi> our ſeconds, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a more private place; at the ſame time intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deſire, that we might have a gentleman of the faculty near us, in caſe either of us ſhould unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately ſtand in need of his aſſiſtance.—Here Mr. <hi>Lyttleton</hi> obſerved, that the afternoon was rather an unuſual time for theſe matters, and therefore urged it might ſtand over till Sunday morning four o'clock.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwered, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That the affair was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable enough at preſent in every point of view to me, and therefore I would not on any account, ſuffer it to hang another night upon my mind."</q> This, with Mr. <hi>Dawes</hi>'s citing the caſe of Lords <hi>Townſhend</hi> and <hi>Bellamont,</hi> to prove that it was not ſo very unuſual as was repreſented, produced an unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous agreement, that we ſhould therefore inſtantly take a poſt coach and four, with a ſurgeon, drive down to Richmond-Park, and there finally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the whole difference.</p>

At the inſtant we were about to quit the room, Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> abruptly broke in upon us, with his hat on, and, in the moſt inſolent tone of voice, demanded ſatisfaction of me, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"in the name of <hi>his friend Capt.

                  <p>He replied, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"he could not do that, as Capt. <hi>Miles</hi> was ſo enraged againſt me, that probably he might beat me."</q> I obſerved, That I fancied myſelf in the company of Gentlemen; and even at the worſt I could defend myſelf, and therefore begged he might be introduced.—He now informed me, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That Capt. <hi>Miles</hi> only came <hi>to fight me my own way; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I</hi> did not box him immediately, he would knock me down wherever he ſaw me in public."</q> Mr. <hi>Lyttleton,</hi> Capt. <hi>Crofts,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dawes</hi> now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed, by obſerving, That I had behaved in every reſpect like the gentleman; that from my preſent

conduct, my character muſt have been totally miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented; and therefore begged this matter might drop, and Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi> and I go out to ſettle our point:—This however Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> flatly refuſed; but while I was in converſation with him, Mr. <hi>Lyttleton,</hi> Capt. <hi>Crofts,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dawes</hi> conſulted together, and agreed, that with my conſent, the affair between Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi> and me might be adjuſted, if ſome conceſſions were made on either ſide; to which I immediately aſſented, if it could poſſibly be done conſiſtent with my honour. Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt declared, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That Mrs. <hi>Hartley</hi> having been ungenteelly treated, Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> acted with great ſpirit and propriety in defending her."</q> To which I readily replied, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That point being granted, I begged Mr. <hi>Crofts</hi>'s pardon for any unguarded ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which aroſe from a miſunderſtanding on both ſides."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far being amicably ſettled, we returned to the former ſubject; and on Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi>'s retiring, Captain <hi>Miles</hi> was introduced. Addreſſing myſelf to him, I acquainted him, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That I had never ſeen his face before, and therefore was ignorant how I could offend him."</q> I therefore begg'd leave to aſk him, Whether he was the perſon who took Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi>'s part in Vauxhall-Gardens? To which he confuſedly anſwered, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Yes; and he now came to take the part of his friend Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall.</hi>"</q> I told him, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That he would be diſappointed of the ſatisfaction he intended himſelf, for that I never boxed with a gentleman, nor ever would; but if he had a violent inclination to box, and nothing would ſatisfy him without it, I would ſend for two chairmen, give them a guinea a-piece, and beat, or be beaten, by them."</q>—Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0241800700:22"/>
now ſaid, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"It did not ſignify talking any more about it, for that if I did not fight him now, Capt. <hi>Miles</hi> was determined to beat me at Vaux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, or any where he next ſaw me."</q> To which I anſwered, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I ſhould be there every night next week, and would certainly defend myſelf."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the congreſs broke up, Meſſ. <hi>Lyttleton, Fitz-Gerall,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Miles</hi> going out. Not willing they ſhould enjoy any thing like the ſhadow of a triumph, I run inſtantly after them into the ſtreet, perhaps indeed, imprudently, and, overtaking them on the pavement, oppoſite Catharine-ſtreet, I told the <hi>Captain,</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That rather than receive any public inſults, if he would fix an hour on Monday morning, and bring either of the gentlemen then with him, I would meet him, and give him the ſatisfaction he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired."</q> I received no other anſwer than <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Damn ye now, Sir.</hi>"</q>—Not able to contain myſelf any longer, I beckoned him into the paſſage of the Spread Eagle Tavern, where we went into the front dining-room, attended by our friends, as before. I again addreſſed him, and begged he would not inſiſt upon this porter-like buſineſs, or that he would tell me how I had offended him; intimating to him, at the ſame time, that I ſhrewdly ſuſpected I could beat him. Not being able to pacify him with words, we ſtripped, and previous to the onſet, I addreſſed Mr. <hi>Lyttleton,</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"to teſtify how diſagreeable it was to me; and if there could be a propriety in ſuch an exerciſe, which I much doubted, begged it might be here obſerved on both ſides."</q> Theſe proper preliminaries being ſettled, the <hi>Captain</hi> received in about fifteen minutes the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> he required, not being able to diſcern a ſingle ray of light, by which to find his way home.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0241800700:23"/>
Three Iriſh Chairmen, I have this inſtant learnt, were hired to attend the meeting (according to their own confeſſion to Mr. Engliſh, Hoſier, in Catharine-Street) <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>to ſee their little Tommy,</hi> (Capt. Miles) <hi>had fair play;</hi>"</q> and if it came to a riot in the ſtreet, that they might lend a friendly hand, to carry the point of an infamous aſſaſſin.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>ungentlemanlike</hi> buſineſs being however ſettled, we all returned to the Turk's Head, except the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Capt. <hi>Miles,</hi> when my conduct was in general highly commended, and Mr. <hi>Lyttleton,</hi> on his leaving us, begged I would oblige him with my company to dinner the next day, (Sunday.)</p>
                  <p>On their departure, Mr. <hi>Dawes</hi> and I began to collect together ſome circumſtances, which led us to ſuſpect, that this Capt. <hi>Miles</hi> was an hired bruiſer.—His moſt amazingly confuſed addreſs, the manner in which his friends treated him, and his new awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward veſtments, all conſpired to convince us he was a <hi>made-up gentleman</hi> for the buſineſs. Determined, however, to act with caution in the inveſtigation of the matter, the next day when I dined with Mr. <hi>Lyttleton,</hi> I aſked him in the drawing-room apart, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Whether he knew Capt. <hi>Miles?</hi>"</q> To which he anſwered, with a ſhrug of the ſhoulders, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"He did not."</q> Not a word more on the ſubject paſſed the whole day, though Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> were of the party.</p>
                  <p>On the Monday morning I was informed, that <hi>his vanquiſhed friend</hi> Capt. <hi>Miles</hi> was Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi>'s own footman. In conſequence of this intelligence, which was a confirmation of my own ſuſpicions, I ſent the following note to Mr. <hi>Lyttleton:</hi>

                  </opener>
                  <p>THE honour of your viſit to me this morning at one o'clock, was of ſo ſingular a nature, that a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic acknowledgement of it cannot be chargeable with any violent impropriety.—It will ſave us both an infinity of trouble. The curious will be informed of the circumſtances on both ſides, without the tedious formalities of ſeparate narrations.—</p>
                  <p>In the late infamous affray, from whence I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived the melancholy conſequence of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, it is I believe, generally underſtood, that I acquitted myſelf with a tolerable degree of prudence and fortitude. The voice of candour has therefore upon that event, preſcribed a ſolemn di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0241800700:27"/>
between us for ever: you will, perhaps, think it too rigid; ſince it will now ſcarce permit me to look down upon, or lament the ſituation of a wretch, ſince that wretch is the wanton, ſelf-created, out-caſt of ſociety. Yet premeditated Villainy muſt not go unpuniſhed: However dark and ſecret his footſteps, I will induſtriouſly trace the monſter, till public atonement be made, or he hide his ſavage head eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in oblivion.</p>
                  <p>I would fain attribute your dark attempt of laſt night, or rather this morning, to thoſe Bacchana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian ſallies, which have regularly preceded you to the chair of Infamy: But it ſavours too much of deliberate villainy, to be leſs than the machination of ſome daemon of revenge.—I own my ſituation was ſomewhat unpleaſant, when four armed gentlemen, attended by two others, came to my chambers in the dead of night, knocked up my ſervant, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, under a feigned voice, and other ſpecious pretences, to allure me from my bed: the inſtant I had entered amongſt you in the dark, I doubt not but your triumph had been complete. The ſummons of a known poltroon I never obey, and therefore I eſcaped; for, Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> I believe was the only one who had even a pretence for ſpeaking with me. I honour the impudence of that man, who, knowing he has too far degraded himſelf below the dignity of a gentleman ever to be ſeen in that light again, now talks of nothing but <hi>Bullets and Bagſhot.</hi> Before my knowledge of <hi>your friend</hi> Captain <hi>Miles,</hi> you could tamely ſubmit to be called an <hi>impertinent, meddling puppy</hi> in the midſt of Vauxhall Gardens; a phraſe that would have called forth the reſentment of a grocer's apprentice; but when you and the world are informed of the mode of chaſtiſement I have

laid out for you, and which is the only one I can now condeſcend to beſtow upon you, we hear of nothing but <hi>Slugs in a Saw-pit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Think not, young gentleman, that the humours of laſt night, however oft repeated, will ſhake me from my reſolve. I have zeal in ſome inſtances, which may ſurmount the reſolution of an aſſaſſin. Should you continue to watch each pale moon to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of retirement through the circling year, and then ſteal out when darkneſs reigns propitious to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, ſtill, as long as I can eſcape the ſtiletto, the ruffian ſhall be dragged forth, however reluctant, to public view; where, as his deſigns were dark and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, his puniſhment ſhall be proportionably ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious.</p>

                  <p>THE unwarrantable freedom you have taken with my character in your narrative of the Vauxhall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, and the little regard you have paid to truth and candour, conſtrain me to lay before the public a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0241800700:29"/>
                     <hi>true</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> account of that affair, ſo far as I had any concerns in it directly or indirectly: Nor can I entertain the leaſt doubt, but that upon a fair hearing, my conduct from the beginning to the end will bear the common ſterling ſtamp of the gentleman, the man of honour, and, (if rightly conſidered by Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> himſelf) the <hi>real friend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To begin then my juſtification; even you your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> will do me the juſtice to acknowledge I was not preſent when the pretended rudeneſs you ſo much complain of was offered to Mrs. Hartley. In fact I was in another part of the gardens: But the rumour being inſtantaneouſly ſpread over the whole place, that Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi> had been inſulted with the groſſeſt abuſe and fouleſt language by a gentleman then unknown; I own, Sir, I made what expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I could to find my friend, in order, if poſſible, to prevent any fatal conſequences. When I found Capt. <hi>Crofts,</hi> Sir, you was in conference with him, words had run very high between you both, and the cauſe of all this <hi>fracas,</hi> it ſeems, was, that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Mrs. <hi>Hartley</hi> had been looked at in a manner (as you ſay) not altogether genteel."</q> This being the ground of the quarrel, I thought there was room to qualify the ſuppoſed affront that had unintentionally been given to this lady, and I obſerved, that certainly every man had a right to look at a <hi>fine woman.</hi> I flattered myſelf, that by giving Mrs. <hi>Hartley</hi> that epithet, which ſo juſtly is her due, I ſhould receive at leaſt a decent, if not a polite anſwer, more eſpecially as I declared to you, that I only came to <hi>mediate</hi> the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. Sir, I am now appealing to the tribunal of the public, and upon my honour I ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare I had no other intentions when I accoſted you, but to mediate the affair between Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0241800700:30"/>
you. The one I knew to be a gentleman, the other, by his dreſs, <hi>appeared</hi> to be ſo; and I was in hopes of reconciling you both. But, Sir, what opinion muſt the public have of your veracity in telling your own tale, when, inſtead of thanking, or at leaſt meeting me half way in my endeavours to <hi>mediate,</hi> you abruptly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in theſe very words, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Damn you for your mediation;</hi> you are an impertinent puppy for your pains."</q> This anſwer of yours, Sir, you have not only jeſuitically with-held from the public; but you are pleaſed to tell them another ſtory, and add, <q rend="inline">"that on this, I <hi>greatly</hi> anſwered, I would knock the raſcal down who dared to ſay ſo, and nobly put my hand to my ſword."</q> Sir, you know in your own conſcience I never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the word raſcal, nor did I tell you that I would knock any man down who dared to ſay ſo. Nature, Sir, has not caſt me in an athletic mould, nor has the ſcience of bruiſing had any ſhare in my gymnaſtic education. It is true, indeed, when you gave me the ungentlemanlike anſwer I have mentioned above, I obſerved to you that you had no ſword, but that you might eaſily borrow one, and that we had better retire than make any noiſe in ſo public a place. I declare, Sir, upon my honour, that at the time I gave you this whiſper in the ear, I was an utter ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to your profeſſion; nor, from your preceding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, could I poſſibly divine that you were in <hi>holy orders;</hi> much leſs could I dream of any ſuch thing by the anſwer you gave me, which was, that you did not chuſe to encounter me <hi>that way,</hi> but that, if I had a mind to try my ſkill at bruiſing, you was entirely at my ſervice. Thus, Sir, ſtood the <hi>demelé</hi> I had with you, when Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi> gave me to underſtand that you was a PARSON.

and witty upon your eccleſiaſtical character."</q> The real truth is, and I will not diſguiſe it, I replied, That I was aſhamed of your behaviour, and that you ought to have your gown publicly ſtripped from off your ſhoulders; and from that moment I determined, Sir, even though your conduct towards me had been a thouſand times more reprehenſible than it really was, and though you had ſworn a thouſand more oaths than I am ſorry to ſay you did, I determined within my own mind to pay every poſſible reſpect to your cloth, and treat you as a man, who, if not out of his ſenſes, was at leaſt within the ſacred pale and protection of the church. For, Sir, I had a character at ſtake, which I might have endangered, had I applied either my ſword or my cane, knowing you to be a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But, Sir, notwithſtanding the lenity and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I manifeſted on this occaſion, I cannot help repeating, that I think you deſerve to have your caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſock pulled over your ears. I may, however, be erroneous in my judgment, as no perſon is a proper judge in his own cauſe; but if you think my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the wrong, Sir, I am very willing to ſubmit the cenſure I thus paſs upon your public conduct to the deciſion and final adjudication of your own Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan, who, I underſtand, is the Biſhop of London, and whom all the world muſt allow to be a competent arbitrator.</p>

                  <p>WHEN villainy has wrought the human mind to a certain degree of deformity, the phaenomenon, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting our admiration, may influence the weakeſt of our paſſions.—Having confeſſed the originality of your character, and even now aſtoniſhed at ſuch a wonder-work of Providence, conſidering the frailty of human nature, I wiſh our dealings hereafter to be as limited as poſſible. I own that you have betrayed me into a weakneſs, by forcing me for a moment to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the rectitude of the univerſal ſyſtem. But, doubtleſs, the ſame extenſive Wiſdom who gave being to the <hi>blood-enveloped houſe-breaker,</hi> and <hi>aſſaſſinating foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pad,</hi> found it neceſſary, in his myſterious operations, to create a being, in whom ſhould center the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of both. The man, impatient of violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, may here be rather innocently led to arraign the Divine Juſtice; but I am thankful, that reflection has weight enough with me to baniſh ſuch melancholy ideas; and rejoice from thence to find, that a ſacred <hi>ne plus</hi> is aſſigned even to the moſt refined degeneracy. If we could ever be led to doubt the poſition, your letter of this day muſt convince us—<hi>that the vicious ignorance of the darkeſt profligate betrays itſelf in language; and that his vices are therefore ſeldom or never contagious, but from a perſonal intercourſe.</hi>

                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0241800700:33"/>
Being now in no danger of becoming a convert to the creed of libertiniſm and treachery, from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence of thoſe arguments dealt out for their ſupport by niggard Nature, a diſtant correſpondence of this kind I will never refuſe you. If ſuch condeſcenſion can at all amuſe in this your diſgraceful ſtate of exile from ſociety, I have that Chriſtian charity which will not let me with-hold it from you.—Forlorn and wretched as you really are, I will give you a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary relief from the pangs of ſelf-conviction, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing your feeble talents ever and anon into their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive kind of exertion.</p>
                  <p>Dragged forth with horrible reluctance, ten days being elapſed, you make a miſerable entrance in this day's <hi>Gazetteer;</hi> and after the example of every ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convicted culprit, unwilling to plead <hi>guilty,</hi> you make a contemptible appeal to the public, in the nature of a defence. Generouſly giving <hi>you</hi> credit for its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly formation, I apprehend the whole burden of it to be ſtrictly this:—<hi>That your interpoſition was that of a mediator;—that I damn'd you for your mediation, and called you an impertinent puppy for your pains;—that you told me I had no ſword on, but that I might borrow one;—and that I replied, I did not chuſe to engage you that way, but that if you had a mind to try your ſkill at bruiſing, I was entirely at your ſervice.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately for you, my gentle <hi>Paris!</hi> not a ſhadow of truth reſts on either of theſe aſſertions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that indeed of your being <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>an impertinent puppy for your pains,</hi>"</q> which I acknowledged in my letter of yeſterday to have ſaid to you; nor need you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have taken ſuch an infinity of pains to enforce, what is already ſo ſtrongly impreſſed on my mind, and on that of the public.</p>

Reſcued from the danger as a naked man, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now but laugh at your ſavage notions of a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;—but my wonder ceaſes, when I recollect to have read of two gentlemen going out to fight, one of whom was ſhot through the head by a mediatorial friend, in order to prevent the conſequence of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph on either ſide.—I fancy Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi> cannot but recollect the mode of your firſt addreſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not enforce the evidence of <hi>my friends,</hi> till that gentleman, or ſome other, will ſtep forth in public, and bear <hi>you</hi> witneſs. As far as reſpects the ſword buſineſs, it is entirely either the effect of a phrenſied and diſtempered brain, or the paltry, forged evaſion of an equivocating reptile. To one and the ſame cauſe muſt I aſſign the origin of the <hi>bruiſing,</hi> ſince I repeatedly and ſtudiouſly told you all, THAT <hi>was never my plan.</hi> Nay, had it been,—what could tempt me to it, when Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> was the tiny object of my reſentment! I appeal to your friend Capt. <hi>Crofts,</hi> whether I did not repeatedly diſown ſuch a mode to <hi>him?</hi> and if I waved it here, where ſome triumph might have been the conſequence, how could I condeſcend to think of ſuch an operation, when your little preſence of aerial divinity courted my thoughts from manhood, to a ſilent contemplation of the progreſſive beauties of the pigmy ſyſtem?</p>
                  <p>No, my dear little whimſey-formed being, let no ſuch rude forebodings diſturb thy pretty peace in future! Terrific as my ſtrides appear to ſuch ſilphs and ſilphids, I have long forgotten that ſchool-boy pleaſure of <hi>breaking butterflies on the wheel;</hi> nor would I now cruſh a noxious reptile, had it not attempted to ſting the foot, that meant not to diſturb it.</p>
                  <p>I cannot take leave of you, without acknowledging your political merit, in referring the nature of our
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0241800700:35"/>
diſpute to the arbitration of the <hi>Biſhop of London.</hi> I will not accuſe <hi>you</hi> with the thought, notwithſtanding its excellence.—Candid as it may appear, I muſt however decline it, tho' no man eſteems this illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous prelate more than I do. I know his worth, as a man; his excellence, as a chriſtian: yet his decree muſt be in ſome reſpect, oppoſite to the feelings of humanity. You know not perhaps, the motto of the reverend bench, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>If a man ſmite thee on the right cheek, turn unto him thy left alſo.</hi>"</q> This, I own is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſyſtem, accompanied with lawn ſleeves: theſe pious appendages have a ſoporific quality, depriving the wearers of any other than a theorical knowledge of it. However, point me not out to their Lordſhips as an heretic in this inſtance; for I have no objection to fall into their notions, upon ſimilar terms.—</p>
                  <p>The fiery taper of youth will naturally burn leſs and leſs glaring, as Time with frigid hand ſhall call forth his hoary emblems on our head. The mitre then adorns the reverend brow; the holy croſier guards its <hi>ſingle</hi> prieſt from violence.—In this calm ſtand-ſtill of life, the hour may come, when I ſhall wiſh for ſuch ſacred protections; and without an abundance of miracles, time might vouchſafe to work me to the ſacred purpoſe.—Then, being free from the wanton attacks of libertiniſm, my right-reverend feelings, would be reduced to a narrow and peaceable compaſs;—then could I perhaps, declaim in favour of that non-reſiſtance which my youthful impetuoſity pointed out as no virtue, and even being ſmitten by Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> on the right cheek, might, from a fortitude truly religious,—<hi>turn unto him my left alſo.</hi>

                  <p>THE letter I addreſſed to you, Sir, in <hi>Monday</hi>'s Gazetteer, I flatter myſelf hath fully convinced the impartial Public, my conduct throughout this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action hath been that of the gentleman, and the man of honour: <hi>of the gentleman,</hi> by my treating you as ſuch, ſo long as I took you to be a LAYMAN. <hi>Of the man of honour,</hi> by ceaſing to demand ſatisfaction, the very moment I knew you to be in <hi>holy orders.</hi> It now remains that I convince the ſame impartial Public, that I alſo acted to you as a real friend; I ſay <hi>real friend,</hi> Sir, becauſe if I ſee a Clergyman of the Church of England ſcandalouſly expoſing himſelf in public, and can poſſibly make him feel his folly ſo as to prevent a return of a ſimilar paroxyſm; I think, Sir, even in your own opinion, I muſt be allowed to be doing that Clergyman an act of real friendſhip. If you grant me this poſition, then my reply is, <q rend="inline">"Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, thou art the man."</q> For I appeal to the whole company who were that night at <hi>Vauxhall,</hi> whether they did not deem you, as a man, loſt to all ſenſe of public ſhame, public character, and public decorum?</p>
                  <p>Deſperate as your <hi>diſorder</hi> was, I did not deſpair to cure it. The only doubt with me was the <hi>modus curandi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To have conſigned you over to <hi>Lord Mansfield</hi>'s tipſtaff might poſſibly have had a temporary effect,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0241800700:37"/>
but it would not have gone to the root of the diſorder, and a relapſe in ſuch a calenture as yours, ſeemed to me to be death unavoidable.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, had I taken this matter up ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, had I attempted to convince you, that the fate of nations is not now-a-days, decided by bodily ſtrength or muſcular adroitneſs, but by the fuſil, bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onet, and cannon; and that conſequently, in a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical point of view, the ſcience of bruiſing, ſo far as it relates to gentlemen who are born to command fleets and armies, can be of no ſervice, and therefore contemned by them as a thing of no value; nay, had I even acknowledged that I approved of this <hi>bruiſing ſcience,</hi> when confined to the lower claſs of people, becauſe I think the national habits of vulgar courage ought never to be checked; I ſay, Sir, had I attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have reaſoned with you in this manner, I ſhould only have added fuel to fire. The only method then I could make uſe of with any hopes of ſucceſs, was to hold up to you the mirror of ridicule, not doubting but that I ſhould find with the poet Horace,<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Ridiculum Aeri</hi>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>On this plan, Sir, I will not conceal from you, that my firſt intention was to have borrowed one of <hi>Foote</hi>'s wooden heroes; ſtrip him ſtark naked, put him in a true Broughtonian attitude, and have told you, that he inſiſted upon your fighting him. It was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that you muſt certainly ſee through the game that was going to be played upon you. I was, indeed, of a different opinion; and I obſerved, that if the Knight of La Manch, who, in every reſpect, that of <hi>frantic courage</hi> excepted, was an excellent ſcholar,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0241800700:38"/>
and an accompliſhed gentleman, could ſeriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter a wind-mill, or a barber's baſon, your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order being ſimilar to his, you would eaſily fall into a ſimilar deception, <hi>ſpecie recti.</hi>—However, Sir, to comply with my friends, I ſuffered my opinion to be over-ruled; yet unwilling to leave you uncured, I dreſſed one of my ſervants, introduced you to him, as a perſon you greatly affronted, and a pitched battle enſued between you both, to the great diverſion of the few bye-ſtanders, who were privy to the ſecret, which hath been pompouſly recorded by your own pen in the Morning Poſt. But there is one little circumſtance, which out of charity I now tell you, and that is, I gave my ſervant ſtrict orders not to beat you unmercifully, and when we thought he had given you a ſufficient doſe, we not only interpoſed and parted you, but we highly commended your bravery, and made you believe that you had ſealed up both the peepers of the redoubtable Capt. <hi>Miles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The good intention I had in playing the riſible farce upon you, was, that when you ſhould come to the denouement of the plot, you might ſee <hi>quaſi in ſpeculo</hi> into what an infinite number of abſurdities, embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſments, and vulgariſms your <hi>unclaſſical</hi> propenſity for bruiſing muſt, <hi>as a Clergyman,</hi> unavoidably betray you; for, a man, not abſolutely bereft of reaſon, to ſee his error, is to be half cured of it; and I had flattered myſelf, indeed, that I had happily made this half-way progreſs, and was determined to be an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toptical witneſs of the real fact. With this intent I went laſt <hi>Saturday</hi> to your chambers in <hi>Clifford's-Inn;</hi> Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lyttleton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Storer</hi> were ſo obliging as to accompany me. It was nearly eleven o'clock at night, when I pleaſed myſelf with thinking that cool reaſon would have reſumed her empire, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0241800700:39"/>
that I ſhould have found you preparing yourſelf for the next morning's function of your holy office, and that conſequently all rancour, animoſity, and ill-will was buried for ever in oblivion. But, Sir, how greatly were my hopes creſt-fallen, when after gently knocking at your door, I found it barricadoed againſt me, though I repeatedly told you my name, and the real purport of my viſit. In return for this my care and attention, all the ſatisfaction I could obtain was, to hear myſelf called, <q rend="inline">"an aſſaſſin,"</q> with reiterated aſſurances from your own lips, that the firſt time you ſhould meet me, either in the Mall, Vauxhall, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelagh, or the Pantheon, you would break every bone in my ſkin. Sir, it is an eaſy matter to talk of breaking bones; but if you are not <hi>incurably gone,</hi> I now caution you not to attempt putting your menaces into execution. For if I muſt be ſerious with you, Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> you ought to know that the gentleman who can reſpect the protection of your cloth to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree, will beyond that degree protect himſelf. And I muſt further obſerve to you, that if in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of my perſon, any <hi>fatal conſequence</hi> ſhould happen either to you or myſelf, the blame will now lie at the door of your Dioceſan, and not at that of</p>

                  <p>THE thread of inconſiſtent villainy being this day re-united, I have now before me the whole contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible defence of the moſt daring, yet ridiculous, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turber of the public peace.—It has been obſerved, that my former letters ſoared too far above the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row limits of your puny underſtanding. I admit in part the propriety of the remark, and therefore, in this reply, I ſhall ſtudiouſly confine myſelf to that ſimplicity of language which is found the abler advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in the cauſe of virtue.</p>
                  <p>Pardon me, if here I breathe a digreſſive ſigh for ſome noble and worthy perſonages, who, till the fatal concluſion of your letter, had comforted themſelves with a flattering idea, that their kinſman was rather vicious from accident, than from principle, or fatal neceſſity. The tears of penitence, young man, are a grateful and efficacious offering even to deſpairing friends, winning them, as it were, by enchantment, almoſt to our own terms of remiſſion;—but, from your example, we are taught not to wonder, that a wanton and ſtubborn perſeverance alarms the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their fortitude, and bids them renounce for ever the villain they could not reclaim.—</p>
                  <p>I have hitherto, Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall,</hi> in this correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with you, trifled with my own conſequence,

rather purſuing the deluſive flights of imagination, than ſtanding forth ſimply your accuſer, as the injured man. However, a juſt and public ſacrifice can never be out of ſeaſon, and therefore I will now pin you down to that public ſtake of infamy, from which the extravagance of your conduct will never let you riſe. Behold me, therefore, literally a rigid accuſer, no longer wiſhing to trifle with the deſpondency of a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, or the patience of the public, his appointed judge.—If ſhame will permit you to look up, you may now ſee how truly formidable is an injured indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual rationally collected, and inſpired with a ſtrong but temperate fortitude, the powerful ſtaff ordained to ſupport him.—The public, Sir, are impatient for the deciſion, and therefore no <hi>hired</hi> evaſions will longer avail you. The following black indictment courts your dejected eyes; and truly diſmal is ſuch a ſcroll, which bears the ſtamp of unſhaken authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity.—</p>

                     <hi>To the Rev. Mr.</hi> BATE.</opener>
                  <p>BY ſeeing this letter in the paper, do not think I mean to continue a literary correſpondence with you, Sir, who thrive by ſcandal, and live upon defamation; I therefore declare, that as this is the firſt, ſo it ſhall be the laſt time I will publiſh any thing concerning the late affair at Vauxhall. I had indeed imagined that you and I, Sir, had finally ſettled all our differences: but as I find you have revived the ſubject, by your letters in the Morning Poſt, it is incumbent upon me to ſet the miſinformed public right, in ſome particulars which you have groſsly falſified.</p>
                  <p>You publicly call upon me to certify the truth of your having declined boxing, during the whole courſe of your proceedings. Now, Sir, I as publicly declare, that ſo far from declining, you long inſiſted upon it, refuſing me the ſatisfaction I required, and calling upon me to put my threats into execution, which, you ſaid, you would reſent with your fiſt, and your fiſt only; and it was in conſequence of Mr. <hi>Lyttleton</hi>'s aſſuring you, that the iſſue of the affair muſt then of neceſſity be fatal, that you condeſcended to <q rend="inline margQuotes">"wave your privilege;"</q> and, for the firſt time in your life, put yourſelf upon the footing of a gentleman.</p>
                  <p>Again, Sir, in your letter to Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall,</hi> you aſſert that I ſaid, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Mrs. <hi>Hartley</hi> having been ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teelly treated, Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> acted with great ſpirit and propriety in defending her."</q>—This, Sir, as I
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0241800700:45"/>
never thought, I never ſaid: the concluding words that paſſed between us were as follows; I confeſſed that you would have acted properly in protecting a lady who had in your company been publicly affronted, but that I did not think Mrs. <hi>Hartley</hi> came under that predicament; and as to myſelf, I neither intended nor offered her an inſult. In anſwer to which, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I am ſorry my paſſion forced improper words from me, and I aſk your pardon."</q> Theſe, Sir, were your words; and as they were much attended to, they muſt have been heard and remembered by every gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman preſent. I little thought the affair would have terminated thus amicably, as I was far from imagining that there would have been any ſtop put to my determined reſolution of chaſtiſing your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence.</p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, I take my leave of you, advertiſing you that I have heard of your <hi>terrific</hi> threats, and denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations of revenge. Theſe I look upon as the ravings of a lunatic, and the frantic workings of a diſtempered brain. If, however, you have coolly concerted ſchemes of meditated vengeance, I ſhall not, Sir, appeal to the mediation of your dioceſan, or the interpoſition of Juſtice Fielding. I, Sir, am a ſoldier, and look equally with an eye of contempt at the miſchief of a monkey, and the malice of a monk.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>AS a man truly ſenſible of your ſituation, I cannot but pity your misfortunes.—You muſt at laſt I think diſcover, the fatality of your league with an abandoned and deſpicable aſſociate, who will not let you now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that retreat from an extravagant imprudence, which your penitentials, and my ſympathy, had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily wrought for you. Convicted himſelf,—after the moſt candid and diſpaſſionate hearing, he ſeems diveſted of that ſavage kind of clemency which has dignified the robber and aſſaſſin; who bear individually the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of ſociety, rather than involve the partner of their guilt in the horrors of their puniſhment. This was the <hi>etiquette</hi> of heroic villainy; but now loſt in the daſtard refinements introduced by our modern <hi>fine gentlemen:</hi> for Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> has hauled you forth, ere the conſcious bluſh of guilt had loſt its empire o'er your cheek, inſiſting that you ſhall make a ſimilar atonement with him, and that on the ſame public, and diſgraceful ſcaffold.</p>
                  <p>With what a becoming diffidence do you face the world, Mr. <hi>Croftes,</hi> in this day's <hi>Gazetteer!</hi>—Your anticipations are ſo melancholy and well founded, that I could, as far as reſpects myſelf, let them die away contemptibly with the jargon and nonſenſe of the day.—We lament the diſtreſſes of the wretched, culprit mariner, who declares with aching heart, that if he weathers but the perils of his preſent voyage, he ne'er
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0241800700:47"/>
will tempt the watery main again.—Yet Society has its ſacred claims on culprits of every denomination; on that account, though you ſtudiouſly wiſh to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my reply, I cannot let you fall a ſlow and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſacrifice to your own wretched feelings and falſehoods, when one friendly cruſh may annihilate you for ever.</p>
                  <p>After a lethargy of three tedious ſummer weeks, you are rouſed from your ſomnolency, and <hi>now</hi> attempt to invalidate a ſimple narration of facts, which your ſilence, and the public candour, have ſolemnly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. However apparently inſignificant its orbit, that little fiery meteor <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> has its influence I perceive on certain <hi>pliant</hi> bodies; forcing the timid into that diſgraceful ſervice in which he himſelf has been ſo ſhamefully defeated. The ſervile awe with which the whole <hi>petit maitre</hi> tribe look up to this gilded phantom of proweſs, is a juſtification of your prudence. I jump with you in opinion, that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentary inſult on a peaceable clergyman, who fights not but from neceſſity, is leſs hazardous, than even a difference in opinion with another, whoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is founded on <note n="*" place="bottom">This was one, amongſt others, of Mr. <hi>Lyttleton</hi>'s obſervations to me (perhaps <hi>in terr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4+ letters">
                              <desc>••••…</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi>) at the Turk's Head. It ſeems not to tally, however, with an anecdote now circulating at <hi>Stuart</hi>'s, in Bond-ſtreet; where a caſe of piſtols are ſaid to be ſtill hanging as diſgraceful <hi>mementos</hi> of Mr. <hi>F—'s</hi> forgetfulneſs.</note> 
                     <q rend="inline">"<hi>his having fought eleven duels,</hi>"</q> and whoſe principal beauty ariſes from having loſt the roof of his ſkull by a piſtol ſhot.—</p>
                  <p>The world, Sir, are already convinced of your folly, and my circumſpection.—I will not therefore now diſpute with you myſelf on the two facts, the ſubject of your letters, which you have ſo totally miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. The candid will be ſatisfied without it; and even the incredulous ſhall be eaſed of any doubts and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0241800700:48"/>
ſcruples about it, by the public teſtimony of thoſe Gentlemen, who were preſent at the diſcuſſion.</p>
                  <p>I cannot however but remind you of this aukward introduction of yourſelf to the public.—You ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to ſtand forth on my appeal.—Now, Sir, if my memory ſerves me, the appeal was to prove, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that I obſerved to you repeatedly at <hi>Vauxhall,</hi> that boxing was by no means my plan, and therefore, if I refuſed to <hi>you,</hi> where ſome honour might ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a bruiſing conqueſt, how could I (in <hi>Vauxhall</hi> obſerve) think of ſuch a mode with the tiny <hi>Fitz-Gerall?</hi>"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your maſterly reply (admitting it true for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That I inſiſted upon your putting the threats of your letter in execution, &amp;c. &amp;c. <hi>the next day at the Turk's Head Coffee-houſe.</hi>"</q> This is a mode of advancing ſo truly <hi>Hibernian,</hi> that nothing but Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> having a mechanical command of you, could poſſibly have occaſioned.</p>
                  <p>I believe I have worked myſelf up into that phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical contempt for complicated vice and folly, to be able to <hi>hear</hi> any thing you can advance, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever falſe and atrocious, without the leaſt emotion. Since your own <hi>paſſive</hi> diſpoſition, and the well-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed interpoſition of an <hi>Iriſh renegado,</hi> and his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant ruffians, prevented the proof poſitive of my courage, I will not ſigh for a freſh opportunity of diſplaying it, but rather be thankful, that <hi>my</hi> honour has been preſerved, without the loſs of blood on either ſide.—You may now indulge yourſelf, young man, with paroxyſms of rage and vengeance; ſince neither <hi>my</hi> neceſſities, nor vices, are ſo preſſing, as ſeriouſly to demand my forfeit life,—ſince I never mean to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend that moſt abject of all beings, who has not ſpirit enough to diſengage <hi>himſelf</hi> from his miſeries, but
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0241800700:49"/>
cowardly courts another's hand to drive him from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.</p>
                  <p>As a proof that I never vowed the leaſt vengeance againſt <hi>you</hi> whatever, I will even conſent that all your anxieties ſhall ceaſe in future.—You ſhall be a man of <hi>gallantry,</hi>—but it muſt only be in thoſe politer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, <hi>where beaux plume themſelves on diſtreſſing the fair ſex!</hi>—You ſhall be a <hi>man of honour</hi>—in that country where they aſk a public, and an ignominious acknowledgment of a ſuppoſed offender, or his blood in half an hour, and yet after that—<hi>bluſh not to make the firſt conceſſion.</hi>—You ſhall be a man of <hi>cool,</hi> tho' <hi>reſolute courage,</hi>—where danger is happily precluded by <hi>the known interpoſition of ſome generous friends.</hi>—You ſhall be a man of <hi>ſtrict veracity,</hi>—where, after having been mean in one inſtance, they get over it, by <hi>honeſtly denying the fact</hi> in another.</p>
                  <p>Nay! come back from <hi>Richmond;</hi>—for, however offenſive to Colonel <hi>Burgoyne,</hi> you ſhall even be a SOLDIER ſtill!—But it muſt be in that arduous ſervice, where FORTS and ARMIES own your friend <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi>'s hereditary government; where they fight with ſcented quil pop-guns, loaded with <hi>bleu mange;</hi>—whoſe armour is compoſed of miniature pictures, and chicken gloves;—who eſcape the ſeverities of a noxious climate, by an artificial atmoſphere of ambroſial eſſences.</p>

                  <p>YOUR paragraph reſpecting the late fray at <hi>Vaux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall Gardens,</hi> diverted me more than any thing I have met with for ſome time. Surely it could not be as I have heard it whiſpered: Is it poſſible little <hi>Coly</hi> could conceal himſelf under the Lady's petticoats all the while? I mean, while the rugged parſon, like a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiff bayed the preſſing throng? 'Twas very good up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my word: I admire <hi>Coly</hi>'s policy; he could not have got a better bully in the world than a prieſt; their blows are weighty; he knows that he has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced them, and lately too.—Was it not great! plume thy feathers, wench, for who but thee could charm two ſages from the ſolemn chair of ſophiſtry, and make them take the cudgel for the pen?—Well, 'tis an ill wind that blows no one any good;—the parſon is to write a play—<hi>Coly</hi> is to bring it out—the lady is to play a principal part in it—and the town
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0241800700:51"/>
is to be diverted with it, as no doubt it will—good luck for the town—ſome comfort for our theatrical expectations—ſince there was never a <hi>better</hi> manager than <hi>Coly</hi>—a <hi>better</hi> actreſs than the Lady—or a <hi>ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> poet than the parſon—and I—but don't tell any body—I intend to write them a farce—and what do you think I mean to call it, eh?—perhaps you cannot gueſs, and ſo I'll tell you—The <hi>Vauxhall Fray,</hi> or a <hi>Peep through the Pocket-hole</hi>—damn'd good, is it not?—don't you think 'twill <hi>take?</hi>—if it don't, the devil <hi>take</hi> the town, I ſay—perhaps I may take it in my head to ſend it you in a day or two, and if you don't like it, I'll give you leave to print it without my conſent, and take the copy-right out of my hands, in ſpight of my teeth.</p>

                  <p>THE public has been lately much obliged to the literary talents of a Reverend Gentleman, for inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating a difference between himſelf and an other, founded on a political cauſe; they are now enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with one ſomething ſimilar, and equally as important to the world, but formed on a voluptuous one; for what, Sir, can we ſtyle a party at <hi>Vauxhall,</hi> an intimate acquaintance with a Lady in a public character, and a diſplay of knight-errantry in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but an offering to the ſhrine of Pleaſure? Our young Clergy, convinced of the ill effects of theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical diſputes, are contriving ſome means to ſoften the auſterity of religion; ſenſible how diſguſtful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that nature are become to this polite age; they have changed the tedious diſquiſitions of the fathers, to the more gentle topicks of gallantry and honour. 'Tis true their intention is humane and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, worthy the applauſe of the preſent rewarders of merit; but methinks (to pleaſe the generality of mankind) the tranſition is rather too rapid. Though Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> did not contemplate, like <hi>Harvey,</hi> the calm delights of a garden, he might have ſhunned the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous reverſe; he might have enjoyed the ſocial converſe of a friend, without making himſelf the partizan of a quarrel; he could have noticed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult to a Lady, without particularizing himſelf in an affair which her huſband thought unintereſting. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he was impelled by a warmer motive, and had a deeper ſenſe of her diſtreſs than the other gentlemen preſent; but ſtill he ſhould have conſidered the badge of his profeſſion, and ſtifled his reſentment to ſome

degree of ſtoiciſm. The world is too apt to judge from ſuch appearance, that prieſts are juggling with their conſciences, that their own example ſhews the decency and ceremony of religion, is nothing more than a cheat upon them. Great changes are brought about ſlowly and imperceptibly; men of pleaſure will admire the ſpirit of Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> but thoſe who are wont to approach a pulpit, will reflect that the old precepts of obedience and humility, are violated by the very hand and tongue that enforced them; they will appeal to their own underſtandings, and deſpiſe the man who attempts to pay ſo ill a tribute to their memories, and by loſing the good opinion of a few, may fail of their ſalutary deſigns in general.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, Sir, are my thoughts upon the ſubject, which, if you pleaſe, you may communicate to the Public, that thoſe who are engaged in Mr. <hi>Bate</hi>'s laudable plan, may avoid thoſe indiſcretions he has been guilty of, and by a <q rend="inline margQuotes">"cunning working of the ſcene,"</q> deſcend gradually to a new mode of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

                  <p>I AM ſorry to ſee, in your letter of to-day, that you have allowed Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> any degree of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary reputation. I would not have any man pluck a

                  <p>I honour your ſpirit as a man, equally with your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities as a writer. At the ſame time I cannot help in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming you, that your letters (particularly the laſt) are generally cenſured, as too florid and declamatory. This kind of dreſs is calculated to hide flaws, and varniſh over defects, and therefore ſhould properly belong to your antagoniſt. Yours ſhould be the ſtern voice of rigid Truth, founded upon ſtubborn facts. Your caſe is a good one, and ſhould be enveloped as little as poſſible. Truth is always painted naked, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no defects to hide, and would make but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different figure in the meretricious ornaments of a modern dreſs.</p>

                  <p>AS the late altercations between the Rev. Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> and ſome gentlemen of the laity, at <hi>Vauxhall,</hi>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0241800700:63"/>
have prepoſſeſſed the Public to know who is the moſt cenſurable; I cannot help (as I happened to be a ſpectator) giving an impartial and candid account ſo far as I ſaw and heard, which was as follows, viz.</p>
                  <p>As Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Hartley,</hi> the Rev. Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> with another gentleman or two were innocently enjoying themſelves over a few Vauxhall <hi>ſlices,</hi> while their auricular faculties were raviſh'd with the melodious ſtrains from the orcheſtra, ſuddenly a violent <hi>ſquall</hi> of ſome deſcendants of Adam (whoſe occupations might be in the manufactory of <hi>wigs,</hi> for what I can tell, as I never ſaw any of them before) overſet their tranquillity, and entirely ſunk for that night their pleaſures to the bottom. The Mariners, however, exerted all their efforts to weather the ſtorm, which I'm afraid they would not have accompliſh'd, had not Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> plied his <hi>oar</hi> in ſo judicious a manner as fairly kept them above water, though he rowed into the very noſe of the <hi>ſquall.</hi> But to be conciſe,—thoſe gentlemen, the inconſiſtencies of whoſe behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our the Rev. Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> ſo ſenſibly delineated, in my opinion were highly reprehenſible; if ſome open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks and long impertinent ſtarings to diſcover the exact ſymmetry of every feature in Mrs. <hi>Hartley</hi>'s face in that ſituation, are to be deem'd ſo. One of the Macaroni <hi>Antiloguiſts,</hi> not quite ſix feet ten inches high, but uncommonly full of garrulity, with a look that would have intimidated a butterfly, thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed Mr. <hi>Bate;</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Parſon Bate! Parſon Bate, as you are a ſoul-driver, it would much redound to my diſhonour to box you, and as I believe you wou'd thraſh me were you to try, I will not attempt it; but you may be aſſured I ſhall procure one, who will wallop you to your heart's content, the firſt time he meets you.</hi>"</q> By this requeſt Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> gave them directions where he was to be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0241800700:64"/>
found, and as to the reſult, he has candidly laid it open to the public in this paper before; it would therefore be neceſſary to quote it again.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, I hope every impartial perſon will acquieſce with me, that the Rev. Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> acted the part of a <hi>man,</hi> by heroically fruſtrating the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of thoſe that certainly attempted to break a very material part of the Tenth Commandment.</p>

                  <p>MR. BATE having this day publiſhed a narrative of the affray at Vauxhall, the public therefore have a right to make their remarks on it. I ſhall obſerve then, that I don't in the leaſt doubt the veracity of it in any one particular, for theſe reaſons; firſt, it is atteſted with his name, and an appeal to the parties concerned; ſecondly, the ſignature wears the name of a man who has acted <hi>nobly,</hi> in ſhewing a nice ſenſe of honour, and a man of nice honour <hi>ſcorns a lie.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo far premiſed, what muſt we think of the <hi>mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary gentlemen,</hi> in drawing up their <hi>brazen artillery</hi> to attack a <hi>woman,</hi> and <hi>ſtare</hi> her out of countenance? The anſwer is plain; that for their <hi>rude behaviour</hi> to our <hi>theatrical Shore,</hi> they are undeſerving of the name of Gentlemen, <hi>in poorly daring to inſult a woman.</hi> Mr. BATE (like a <hi>Dumont</hi>) protected her, and every man of honour muſt applaud him for the part he acted. He was ready to give them either <hi>gentleman or ungentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manlike ſatisfaction,</hi> and to ſhew there was a <hi>poetical</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0241800700:65"/>
                     <hi>juſtice</hi> in the concluſion of this piece; the perſon who was himſelf <hi>no gentleman (the boxing Capt. Miles</hi>) met with <hi>ungentlemanlike ſatisfaction:</hi> I am only ſorry that the ſervant received the wages which were ſo properly <hi>due to the maſter,</hi> and that the maſter was beat by <hi>proxy.</hi> But there is one point particularly wants clearing up, and the <hi>worthy triumvirate</hi> are <hi>publicly</hi> called upon to anſwer theſe queſtions. Was not Capt. <hi>Miles a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit man of war, and no ſoldier</hi> (as Brainworm ſays), or, in plain Engliſh, was he not either Mr. <hi>Fitz-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi>'s ſervant, or a perſon employed to fight for him and the party? Did not Capt. <hi>Crofts</hi> challenge Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> at the coffee-houſe, to <hi>try his courage,</hi> with an intent, if he was found wanting therein, to <hi>expoſe him as a coward?</hi> And, laſtly, was not the introducing of the ſuppoſed <hi>Capt. Miles</hi> at the ſame time, perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily inſiſting, that Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> ſhould fight him firſt, a ſcheme planned to <hi>ſecure a retreat to Capt. Crofts,</hi> if Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> accepted his challenge? Should this be the caſe, it is making courage, as it were, a game at <hi>Brag,</hi> and the Captain was bragging with <hi>Pam in hand,</hi> for there was a knave ſecured in his favour, being determined not to <hi>ſleep with his forefathers,</hi> but to <hi>ſleep in a whole ſkin.</hi> An anſwer therefore is neceſſary, to remove a ſtigma, which ſilence on this head will conſtrue in the affirmative.</p>

                  <p>THE concluſion of <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi>'s reply having made its appearance in this day's Gazetteer, I will venture to ſay that it is the weakeſt defence I ever ſaw; and had a premium been offered for the moſt fooliſh production of the daily papers, the Gazetteer would have carried off the prize <hi>nem. con.</hi> To prove this, what can be more weak and ridiculous than his tale about Mr. <hi>Foote</hi>'s poppets, or more infamous than that a man (pardon the <hi>miſnomer</hi>) who bears a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion under the king, ſhould even bribe his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to do that which he was afraid to do himſelf; that is, fight Mr. <hi>Bate.</hi> This was not only an affront to that gentleman, by putting his footman on a level with him, but to the army in general, in equipping a man with military veſtments, cockade, &amp;c. that was a diſgrace to it, and could be equalled in infamy only by his maſter. But to return to Mr. <hi>Foote</hi>'s poppets:—Though it is well known that Mr. <hi>Foote</hi> does not love fighting himſelf, I am of opinion he admires that ſpirit ſo much in others, he would not even keep a poppet in his pay, that would turn his back on Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall;</hi> whom, for his puſillanimous behaviour in this affair, I ſhall characteriſe as a kind of <hi>mandrake</hi> tottering under the mighty load of a cockade, like the poppy percharged with the morning dew. I ſhall only ſay, Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall</hi> in both his letters ſeems very deſirous of having the <hi>Biſhop of London</hi> for his ſecond, as well knowing that the ſword, piſtol, and hammer of death, form no part of his Lordſhip's <hi>camp equipage;</hi> and, ſhould Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> make his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, that he could ſquat entrenched behind his

                  <p>I have therefore taken the liberty to read for <hi>a Gentleman—a noiſy coxcomb;</hi> for <hi>a Man of Honour—an Aſſaſſin;</hi> and for <hi>a Real Friend,</hi> (ob mon Dieu!) <hi>a Villain.</hi> Indeed, Maſter <hi>Bobby,</hi> you have diſcovered ſo infamous an heart, that the philoſophic eye cannot but drop a pitying tear for the depravity of human nature.

                  <p>SINCE I have had a douſe of the chops given me by a ſatirical rogue in your paper of laſt Tueſday, pray give me room, while my blood is up, to take a fair knock at him in return; he ſhall have it, d—n me! in the true Batenian ſtyle. Oh, oh! Mr. <hi>Q</hi> in the Corner, you've taken it into your head to ſhew your tail at laſt; I have often heard of <hi>Q</hi> in the corner, and was always told it was an ugly thing with a long tail; but you are a plaguy fool for ſhewing your head, and opening your mouth: any body may ſee it is but a <hi>block</hi>-head, a mere mechanical <hi>wooden</hi> head; and I dare ſay the firſt knock that I ſhall hit it, 'twill ſound like an empty pumpkin, brainleſs and light;—and ſo you are in the <hi>queue,</hi> for writing, eh? have at you then, and ſee if I don't ſet you upon your head;—there, take that—there's a croſs buttock for you, <hi>Q.</hi> I told you I could turn you topſy-turvy in a minute. What a contemptible figure you cut now!—<hi>Coly</hi> looked not worſe when he <hi>peep'd thro' the pocket hole;</hi> nor the Parſon when he was popp'd in the pond, and pelted from the purlieus of Prittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, in Eſſex. You ſay you know him not; that is another proof of your having a <hi>wooden</hi> head; for who but a <hi>block</hi>-head would have expoſed his tail in defence of a ſuperficial paragraph-maker; one that has been ſcribbling theſe ſeven years in oblivion, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

And ſo, Mr. <hi>Q,</hi> you would adviſe me to change the title of my farce; but when you know me better, you will find me a man who never takes a fool's advice; I ſhall give it you under the title I have propoſed; <hi>The Vauxhall Fray;</hi> or, <hi>A Peep through the Pocket Hole;</hi> I am about the laſt ſcene, and you ſhall have it forthwith; till when, I am your's,</p>

            <p>The following was ſeen in the MORNING POST of the ſame day.</p>
            <q>A CORRESPONDENT informs us, that the Hon.

            <p>And this in the St. JAMES'S CHRONICLE of the ſame Evening.</p>
            <q>IT is ſuppoſed, that the Macaronies, who occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the Vauxhall ſquabble, were deluded into that ſcrape by the notion that Mr. Bate was a wonderful
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0241800700:70"/>
bruiſer; they ſhould not otherwiſe have acted the cowardly part which their conduct diſcovers. The loſs of an eye or a fore-tooth, or a bruiſe in the face, is worſe than death to a Macaroni; but in an excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>Bagſhot,</hi> or an adventure in a <hi>ſaw-pit,</hi> none are more ready; for not one of the whole fraternity ever feared in a quarrel, that you ſhould blow out his <hi>brains.</hi>

            <q>A CORRESPONDENT informs us, that the <hi>Maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roni Club</hi> have had a meeting on the piteous ſituation
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0241800700:71"/>
of their brother member Mr. Fitz-Gerall, and have unanimouſly reſolved to adviſe that unfortunate <hi>petit maitre</hi> to appear <hi>only</hi> in petticoats at Vauxhall for the remainder of the ſeaſon, as the moſt likely method of eſcaping the chaſtiſement due for his late unmanly and ſenſeleſs conduct. The pretty creature (<hi>his ſnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>white boſom decorated with the miniature reſemblance of his own ſweet perſon,</hi>) may then tread in perfect ſecurity the delightful walks of that enchanting ſpot, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with his equally gallant aſſociates, Capt. MILES, Capt. <hi>Crofts,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lyttleton,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            <q>A Correſpondent thinks it would not be entirely unneceſſary to inſert the following ſhort ſketch, leſt thoſe who do not much reſort to public places, ſhould be ignorant of the <hi>manly</hi> perſonage of Mr. Fitz-Gerall. He may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the noble <hi>order,</hi> by the following extraordinary piece of <hi>Macaroniſhip:</hi> Sweet <hi>Fitz</hi> wears two watches!—Sweet <hi>Fitz</hi> has nine ſeals to each!—Heavens! what could not ſuch a ſweet creature perform!</q>
            <p>The Paragraph beneath is taken from the LONDON PACKET of the ſame evening.</p>
            <q>A CORRESPONDENT ſays, that Capt. Crofts' let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in yeſterday's <hi>Gazetteer,</hi> breathes an air of harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which the military are but too apt to aſſume in the room of candour and gentleman-like civility. When an officer talks or writes to a clergyman, or, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any man of a civil profeſſion, he ſhould ſurely aim at a placid, inoffenſive ſtyle, and forget the haughty language of a young enſign to a corporal in a garriſon. To tell a clergyman, that his agreeing to fight a man with a cockade in his hat, was the firſt inſtance of his gentleman-like behaviour, is a very groſs inſult to the dignity of the cloth in general; the clerical gown is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0241800700:72"/>
ſuppoſed to be of itſelf an infallible token of the gentility of the perſon who wears it. The bravado, at the concluſion of the letter, in the words, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I, Sir, am a ſoldier, and look equally with an eye of contempt at the miſchief of a monkey, and the malice of a monk,"</q> is equally <hi>Bobadilian</hi> and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxical: Does Capt. Crofts mean his friend Fitz-Gerall by the monkey; ſince the Papers have ſaid he dreſſes ſo like one of thoſe animals whoſe miſchievous qualities he ſeems fully to poſſeſs? It is evident that Mr. Bate acts openly, if he acts abſurdly; he has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the malice of a <hi>Monk,</hi> nor the frigid caution which characterizes that order.</q>

                        <p>YOUR behaviour concerning the Vauxhall affray has not only made you more contemptible in the eyes of the public than you really were before, but has likewiſe ſhown a meanneſs in you, which I think im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be paralleled. You, Mr. Fitz-Gerall, I principally addreſs, as having acted inconſiſtent both with the character of a ſoldier and a man of honour. Your behaviour, Sir, was more like that of an aſſaſſin than of a gentleman, to come to a perſon's chambers at the dead of night, armed, and along with a ſet of ruffians, who, no doubt, if you could have drawn

You, Mr. <hi>Crofts</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lyttleton,</hi> muſt have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the whole; it muſt have been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed ſcheme; for, after you found Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> had ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit enough to give you the ſatisfaction you required, you meanly, while Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> was engaged in a talk with Mr. <hi>Fitz Gerall</hi> and <hi>his friend</hi> Captain <hi>Miles,</hi> (only fit for each other's company retired to a corner of the room, and propoſed making up the affair ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably: how far different this behaviour was to the letter you ſent at two o'clock in the morning, I leave the public to the reference of the Morning Poſt for.—Neither could I, was I Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> have ſat down ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly, and not have called you both to account, both being privy to it, although the former affair was ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably cancelled; and how Mr. <hi>Lyttleton</hi> could have the effrontery to aſk Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> home to dinner with him, being ſenſible, as he certainly muſt, that he had acted to a man of honour with ſuch impropriety, is to me moſt aſtoniſhing.—If Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall,</hi> or any of the Gentlemen concerned, can vindicate themſelves againſt the above charges, I ſhall be quite happy to find I have been miſtaken in their real characters.</p>

                  <p>YOU, and your reverend adverſary have appealed to the Public, as if they were intereſted in your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, or as if a quarrel between two obſcure indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals (of little conſequence to ſociety, and not very reſpectable) was an event of importance to the whole human race.</p>
                  <p>Such vanity I can eaſily pardon, but when it is accompanied with an impudent and avowed inſult, with a violation of that decency and reſpect which are due to the military, I hold it deſerving of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt cenſure; and ſince you have ſubmitted your conduct to the tribunal of the Public, I ſhall examine it with great freedom, but not I aſſure you without candour.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prieſt, I ſhall leave him to contemplate the diſgraceful conſequences of an impertinent and officious interpoſition. The huſband of the woman (who by the bye appears to have been too ſqueamiſh, conſidering her ſtation in life) <hi>only</hi> was obligated to take cognizance of your rudeneſs, and in <hi>his</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, her two friends who accompanied her to Vaux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, were the propereſt perſons to chaſtiſe your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence; but Prieſts, in all ages, and of every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, have been diſtinguiſhed and deſpiſed for their officiouſneſs, and the conduct of this Reverend Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen affords me a ſufficient reaſon why I ſhould leave him to his reflections.</p>
                  <p>Your giving the rank of <hi>Captain</hi> to your livery ſervant, is the occaſion of this letter; and though
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0241800700:75"/>
you may poſſibly find an excuſe for every other part of your behaviour, I am fully perſuaded, Sir, you will not be able to juſtify the liberty which you have taken with the Gentlemen of the army upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                  <p>The military will not thank you for reducing them to a level with your domeſtic, and after declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that your reſpect for the Church prevented <hi>your</hi> puniſhing your adverſary, it is ſomewhat extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary that the only inſtance you give of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for religion, was the greateſt indignity you could poſſibly offer to it! This circumſtance I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt is rather unlucky. It is a certificate of your country, but neither a proof of your courage nor humanity.</p>
                  <p>How unfortunate it is, that in almoſt every tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action you prove yourſelf a native of Hibernia! Let us now, Sir, proceed to particulars.—You became engaged in a riot at Vauxhall, but not principally. The parties who were immediately concerned agreed to meet, and that meeting was at a Coffee-houſe. While they, attended by their ſeconds, were ſettling the diſpute, your ſervant, with an aſſumed name and rank, demanded ſatisfaction for a pretended inſult, and upon this occaſion you acted in your favourite character of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> by aſſuring the Parſon, that Capt. <hi>Miles</hi> was ſo paſſionate, that if he was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he might beat him with uncommon fury. I will paſs over the indignity offered to the army, and leave the Military to correct your inſolence: they are very capable of doing it, and I have no doubt but they will take notice of the favour you have done them. I come now, Sir, to conſider you in the character of a Gentleman: When you officiouſly entered the room at the Coffee-houſe, to inform Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0241800700:76"/>
Capt. <hi>Miles,</hi> whom he had inſulted, was below, did it not occur to you, that you was guilty of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated falſehood, at all times unworthy of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and particularly in this inſtance? And was it from that confuſion of ideas ſo common to your countrymen, that you blended the character of an <hi>Officer</hi> with that of a <hi>Bravo?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Shame upon ſuch baſeneſs! By your letter of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, you ſpeak of Gentlemen that are BORN <hi>to command fleets and armies</hi>—BORN <hi>to command fleets and armies!</hi> Good Heavens!</p>
                  <p>I preſume, Sir, you imagine the ranks of Admiral and General are hereditary, and that the ſon of either muſt ſucceed to the honours of the father, though it is very poſſible this ſon might be an arrant Coward, and a conſummate Blockhead! The fate of a Nation ſo unfortunately circumſtanced would be as precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as if you was at the head of a Fleet or Army.—A misfortune which I truſt to God will never happen to us! I have one more remark to make, viz. the impropriety of a drunken man going at one o'clock in the morning to reaſon with his antagoniſt, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by three more. The late hour, and your different ſituations amount, Sir, to a preſumption, that with this auxiliary aid you meant to accompliſh what your ſervant was on trial found incapable of. To me, your intentions appear to have been hoſtile; and the difficulty, not to ſay impoſſibility of proving yourſelf a Gentleman, and a man of honour, is manifeſt in the confuſion and perplexity which appear through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole of a laborious defence, neither plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible nor free from grammatical errors. As to Capt. <hi>Crofts,</hi> was I not aſſured he had been in the army, I ſhould have concluded by his letter to Mr. <hi>Bate,</hi> that he was the Editor of the Gazette, or that a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0241800700:77"/>
Statute of Bankruptcy had lately been iſſued againſt him; and if he was in the ſecret, as you aſſert he was, of giving the title of Captain to a Bravo, I ſhall yet doubt the reality of his Military character.</p>
                  <p>As to Mr. <hi>Lyttleton,</hi> out of reſpect to his venerable and virtuous father, I ſhall remain ſilent; I will not add to the anxiety of an aged and unhappy father, already depreſſed with grief and ſorrow for the Vices of a diſſipated Son.</p>

                  <p>I AM one of that impartial Public who ſo heartily concur in applauding Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> for the great ſpirit and propriety with which he has conducted himſelf towards thoſe inſolent Macaronics, who dared to offend him, in the face of the world, in a manner ſo diametrically oppoſite to every ſentiment of honour and honeſty. It is not my preſent purpoſe to canvaſs this matter; the inveſtigation it has already gone through, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evinces Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> to be really the gentleman, and the man of honour; and that his greateſt mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune has been, having to do with perſons ſo totally devoid of every quality requiſite to the conſtituting either of thoſe characters.—Nothing remains to be ſaid on this ſubject that can increaſe Mr. <hi>Bate's</hi> merit, or the infamy and diſgrace of his opponents. I defy either his, or any other pen, to add to that univerſal odium which they have ſo effectually procured to themſelves; and therefore I hope, and doubt not, Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> will treat the letter addreſſed to him in a paper of this day by Mr. <hi>Croftes,</hi> with that ſilent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſo juſtly due to it.</p>

            <p>The Paragraphs following came forth in the MORN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING CHRONICLE of <hi>Wedneſday, Auguſt</hi> 11.</p>
            <q>
               <p>IT is ſtrongly reported, that a friendſhip, which will probably be of duration, has commenced between a certain foppiſh Knight, now inveſted with an office of ſome conſequence to the city of London and county of Middleſex, and the fribbling, parſon-fearing Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerall,</hi> founded on a fellow-feeling for each other. The Knight is beyond conception rejoiced that there is in the creation as abject a coward as himſelf; has therefore communicated to Mr. <hi>F.</hi> his readineſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Rev. Mr. <hi>Bate</hi> to Tyburn in his public character, if the ſaid <hi>B.</hi> ſhould be convicted of maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and defacing, with an intention to kill, before his ſhrievalty expires.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0241800700:81"/>
Now we ſee the <hi>denouement</hi> of the petit piece of Vauxhall, (which had like to have turned out a deep Tragedy, if not to the great actreſs, to the reverend, ſenſible, and ſpirited actor under her, and to ſome of the ſpectators) we ſurely cannot be at a loſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that the Parſon behaved well, as a <hi>bruiſer</hi> and defender of the fair, but ill as a <hi>parſon</hi> and lecturer of others; as parſons, like coblers, ſhould not go beyond their <hi>laſt</hi> or text;</p>

               <l>For, if Cobler-like, the Parſon will fight or get drunk,</l>
               <l>Worth makes the man, and want of it the fellow,</l>
               <l>The reſt is all nothing, but leather and Prunella.</l>

               <p>It is therefore hoped this will be a leſſon to all parſons to ſtick to their texts, and not ramble again to public places, not even with gods or goddeſſes either of the ſtage, pit, or gallery.</p>
