            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN a Time, when all Communities Congratulate Your MAJESTY on the <hi>Glories</hi> of Your Reign, which are continually riſing from the <hi>Proſperities</hi> of Your People; be graciouſly pleas'd, <hi>Dread Sir,</hi> to permit the loweſt of Your Subjects from the <hi>Theatre,</hi> to take this Occaſion of offering their moſt Humble Acknowledgments for Your Royal Favour and Protection.</p>
            <p>YOUR Comedians, SIR, are an Unhappy Society, whom ſome Severe Heads think wholly Uſeleſs, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Dangerous to the Young and Innocent: This Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is therefore an Attempt to remove that Prejudice, and to ſhew, what Honeſt and Laudable Uſes may be made of the <hi>Theatre,</hi> when its Performaces keep cloſe to the true Purpoſes of its Inſtitution: That it may be neceſſary to divert the Sullen and Diſſaffected from buſying their Brains to diſturb the Happineſs of a Government, which (for want of proper Amuſements) they often enter into Wild and Seditious Schemes to reform: And that it may likewiſe make thoſe very Follies the Ridicule and Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion even of thoſe that committed them. Our Labours have at leaſt this Glory to boaſt, That ſince Plays were firſt Exhibited in <hi>England,</hi> they were never totally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, but by thoſe very People, that turn'd our <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> into <hi>Irreligion</hi> and <hi>Anarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OF all Errors, thoſe that are the Effect of <hi>Superſtition</hi> make us naturally moſt obſtinate; it is therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the Blinded Proſelytes of our Few Non-Juring Clergy, are ſo hard to be recover'd by the cleareſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Senſe and Reaſon. But when a <hi>Principle</hi> is once made truly <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> it is not in the Power of Human Nature not to be <hi>aſham'd</hi> of it. From which Reflection, I was firſt determin'd to attack thoſe <hi>lurking</hi> Enemies of our Conſtitution from the Stage: And though my Succeſs has far exceeded my Expectation, yet I grieve, when I (perhaps with Vanity) imagine it might had thrice the
<pb facs="tcp:1227800700:4"/>
good Effect on the Minds of Your MAJESTY'S People, were it not under the <hi>Misfortune</hi> of being written by a <hi>Comedian.</hi> I am therefore in ſome Terror, notwithſtanding its Publick Applauſe, to reflect how far Your MAJESTY, in Your Wiſdom, may think it proper to with-hold Your Pardon for the Unlicenſed Boldneſs of my Undertaking. I am ſenſible it may be juſtly urg'd againſt me, That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Loyalty</hi> might have loſt their Luſtre, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing reduc'd to want the Defence of ſo inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Champion: But as I never believ'd the beſt Play could be ſupported in an Ill Cauſe; ſo was I aſſur'd the worſt might paſs, with Favour, in a Good one. And though my Duty and Concern has made me more careful in the Conduct of this, than any of my former Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; I am convinc'd, that what may have been extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in the Succeſs of it, is utterly owing to a happy Choice of the Subject: And as its meeting no Oppoſition from our Publick Malecontents, ſeems, in ſome Degree, an Argument of the Clear and Honeſt Truth of thoſe Principles it vindicates; ſo may it of the equal Falſhood of the Rebellious and Unchriſtian Tenets it expoſes. Nay, I have yet a farther Hope, that it has even diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Strength and Number of the <hi>Miſguided</hi> to be much leſs, than may have been artfully infinuated; there being no Aſſembly where People are ſo free, and apt to ſpeak their Minds, as in a Crowded <hi>Theatre;</hi> Of which Your MAJESTY may have lately ſeen an Inſtance, in the Inſuppreſſible Acclamations that were given on Your appearing to Honour this Play with Your Royal Preſence.</p>
            <p>BUT were the Diſaffected yet as Numerous, as ſome Few may wiſh them, What Honeſt <hi>Engliſhman</hi> can ever think them formidable, that conſiders his Security in the Wiſdom of Your MAJESTY'S <hi>Counſels,</hi> and Your He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick <hi>Reſolution</hi> to Execute them? And as every Action of Your Regal Power has ſhewn the Nation, that Your greateſt <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Delight</hi> is in being the <hi>Father</hi> of Your <hi>People;</hi> ſo may it Convince its Enemies, that <hi>they</hi> will always find You KING of Your <hi>Subjects.</hi>—But I am wandring into Thoughts that awe me into Silence; and humbly beg Leave to Subſcribe my ſelf,</p>
            <closer>May it pleaſe Your <hi>MAJESTY,</hi> 
               <signed>Your <hi>MAJESTY'S</hi> Moſt Dutiful, and Moſt Obedient, Subject and Servant, COLLEY CIBBER.</signed>

And a Coquett's Play with a ſerious Lover, is like a Back game at Tables, all open at firſt; ſhe'll make you twenty Blots—and you—ſpare none, take them All up, to be ſure, while ſhe—gains Points upon you: So that when you eagerly expect to end the Game on your Side, ſlap—as you were, ſhe whips up your Man, ſhe's fortified, and you are in a worſe Condition, than when you begun with her—Upon which, you know of Courſe, you curſe your Fortune, and ſhe laughs at you.</p>

               <p>My Father's elder Brother, Madam, was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of an antient Family in the North, who having then no Child himſelf, begg'd me from my Nurſe's Arms, to be adopted as his own, with an Aſſurance too of making me his Heir; to which my Father (then alas! in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of his Fortune) eaſily conſented. This Uncle being himſelf ſecretly diſaffected to the Government, gave me of courſe, in my Education, the ſame unhappy Prejudices, which ſince have ended in the Ruin of us both.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
               <p>No, Madam; but I own in Principles of very little difference, which I imbib'd chiefly from this Doctor; he having been five Years my Governor. As I grew up, my Father'sMerit had rais'd his Fortune under the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and fearing I might be too far fix'd in Principles againſt it, deſired me from my Uncle Home again: But I, as I then thought my ſelf bound in Gratitude, excus'd my going in Terms of Duty to my Father; whom ſince alas! I too juſtly have provok'd ever to hope a Reconciliation. I ſaw too late my Folly, and had no Defence againſt his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1227800700:37"/>
Anger, but by artfully confirming him in a Belief, that I had periſh'd with my Uncle in the late Rebellion.</p>

               <p>I can't diſown the Guilt—but ſince the Royal Mercy has been refus'd to none that frankly have confeſs'd with Penitence their Crime (which from my Heart I moſt ſincerely do) in that is all my Hope—My Youth and Education's all th' Excuſe I plead; if they deſerve no Pity, I am determin'd to throw off my Diſguiſe, and bow me to the Hand of Juſtice.</p>

               <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
               <p>This Doctor, Madam, who, as he is now your Father's, was then my Uncle's Boſom-Counſellor: 'Twas his infidious Tongue that painted it to us as an incumbent Duty, on which the Welfare of our Souls depended; he warm'd us too into ſuch a weak Belief of vile Reports, as Infamy ſhould bluſh to mention—we were aſſur'd, that half the Churches here in Town were lying all in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious Ruines; which ſince, I found, maliciouſly was meant, even of thoſe that are magnificently riſing from their new Foundation!</p>

               <p>Upon our Surrender of the Place, I brib'd a Townſman to employ me, as his Servant, in a backward Working-houſe, where, from my Youth, and Change of Habit, I paſs'd without Suſpicion till the whole Affair was over—But then, alas! whither to turn I knew not: My Life grew now no more my Care—Periſh, I ſaw, I muſt, whether as a Criminal, or a Beggar, was my only Choice.</p>

At this he took new Life, and ſpringing from his Hold, fell proteſtate at his Feet; where mute, and trembling, for a while he lay: At length with ſtreaming Eyes, and faultring Tongue, he begg'd his Bleſſing, and his Pardon. The tender Father caught him in his Arms, and dropping his fond Head upon his Cheek, kiſs'd him, and ſigh'd out, <hi>Heaven protect thee!</hi> then gave into his hand the Royal Pardon; and turning back his Face to dry his Manly Eyes, he cry'd, <hi>Deſerve this Royal Mercy,</hi> Charles, <hi>and I am ſtill thy Father.</hi> The grateful Youth. raiſing his Heart-ſwollen Voice, reply'd, <hi>May Heaven preſerve the Royal Life that gave it.</hi> But here, their Paſſions grew too ſtrong for farther Speech: Silent Embraces, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sighs, and mingling Tears, were all their Language now. The moving Scene became too tender for my Eyes, and call'd methought, for Privacy; there unperceiv'd I left them, to recover into breathing Senſe, and utterable Joy.</p>

               <p>Sir, if that can reconcile me to it, I ſhall be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Benefit, without conſidering why I that way came to deſerve it.</p>

               <p>That Argument might hold us now too long.—But, Sir,—here's the Caſe—your Principles and mine have the Misfortune to differ: Yours being (as I take it) entirely on the Revolution Side.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I did ſo, and thought it juſt.—'Twould be fruitleſs, perhaps, to offer you the Reaſons, that ſince have alter'd my Opinion: But now, Sir, even ſuppoſing that I err in Principle, you muſt ſtill allow, that Conſcience is the Rule that every honeſt Man ought to walk by.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>

            <stage>Spoken by Mrs. Oldfield.</stage>
            <lg>
               <l>HOW Wild, how Frantick is the vain Eſſay,</l>
               <l>That Builds on Modern Politicks a Play!</l>
               <l>Methinks to Write at all, is Bold enough,</l>
               <l>But in a Play to ſtand a Faction Buff!</l>
               <l>Not <hi>Rome</hi>'s Old Stage preſum'd, (or Fame's a Fibber.)</l>
               <l>And Moderns to attempt it! well ſaid <hi>CIBBER!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Was't not enough the Criticks might purſue him!</l>
               <l>But muſt he rouſe a Party to undo him!</l>
               <l>Theſe Blows I told him on his Play would fall,</l>
               <l>But he unmov'd, cry'd—Blood! we'll Stand it all,</l>
               <l>When PRIESTS turn TRAYTORS where's the mighty matter?</l>
               <l>Since when has Treaſon been exempt from Satyr?</l>
               <l>And ſhould from Guilt a Factious Clamour Riſe,</l>
               <l>Such Spite muſt ſpeak them <hi>England's</hi> Enemies,</l>
               <l>But if <hi>Old England's</hi> Friends allow 'tis right,</l>
               <l>W'are ſure their Power can chace the Jacobite,</l>
               <l>And put their Malice, like their Troops, to Flight.</l>
               <l>As for the Criticks, Thoſe, he owns, may Teize him,</l>
               <l>Becauſe he never took ſuch Pains to pleaſe them,</l>
               <l>In Time; Place, Action, Rules by which Old Wits</l>
               <l>Made Plays, as—Dames do Puddings, by Receipts:</l>
               <l>But hopes again ev'n Rebels cannot ſay,</l>
               <l>Tho' Vanquiſht, they're Inſulted in his Play:</l>
               <l>Nay more—To ſet their Cauſe in faireſt light,</l>
               <l>H' has made a Man of Senſe—A Jacobite!</l>
               <l>(Tho' by our Bards good leave, (to take it right,</l>
               <l>His Senſe was ſhewn, when turn'd from Jacobite)</l>
               <l>Thus too the Fair, that may be wrong Inclin'd,</l>
               <l>He Hopes to <hi>CHARLES's</hi> Paſſion will be Kind,</l>
               <l>And own, at worſt, on their Reflecting Pillow,</l>
               <l>The Rebel, after all's, a Pretty Fellow!</l>
               <l>But why, you'll ſay, was I made <hi>HEARTLYS</hi> Wife?</l>
               <l>Conſider, Fair ones, <hi>HEARTLY</hi> ſav'd his Life:</l>
               <l>So that you ſee, the Boy han't quite Miſcarried</l>
               <l>Beſide—</l>
               <l>Are all thoſe Dears ſo Happy you have Married?</l>
               <l>How often, in that State, has Love ſeen Elves</l>
               <l>So Cramm'd with Comſort, they could Han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <l>The Worſt you can againſt his Satyr Plead,</l>
               <l>Is that My Lord of <hi>THETFORD's</hi> Hang'd indeed:</l>
               <l>If that ſeems hard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why Grant him your Reprive,</l>
