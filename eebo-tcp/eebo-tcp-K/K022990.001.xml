            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IT was certainly a great Satisfaction to me to ſee and converſe with a Man, whom in his Writings I had ſo long known with Pleaſure: But it was a high addition to it, to hear you, at our very firſt meeting, doing juſtice to your dead friend Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi> I was not ſo happy as to know him; <hi>Virgilium tantum vidi</hi>—Had I been born early enough, I muſt have known and lov'd him: For I have been aſſur'd, not only by your ſelf, but by Mr.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0096900401:2"/>
                     <hi>Congreve</hi> and Sir <hi>William Trumbul,</hi> that his perſonal Qualities were as amiable as his Poetical, notwithſtanding the many libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miſrepreſentations of them (againſt which the former of theſe Gentlemen has told me he will one day vindicate him <note n="a" place="bottom">He ſince did ſo, in his Dedication to the Duke of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> prefix'd to <hi>Tonſon</hi>'s <hi>Duodecimo</hi> Edition of <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Plays, 1717.</note>) I ſuppoſe thoſe Injuries were begun by the Violence of Party, but 'tis no doubt they were continu'd by Envy at his ſucceſs and fame: And thoſe Scriblers who attack'd him in his latter times, were only like Gnats in a Summer's evening, which are never very troubleſome but in the fineſt and moſt glorious Seaſon; (for his fire, like the Sun's, ſhin'd cleareſt towards its ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.)</p>
                  <p>You muſt not therefore imagine, that when you told me of my own perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances that they were above thoſe Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, I was ſo vain as to believe it; and yet I may not be ſo humble as to think my ſelf quite below their notice. For Critics, as they are Birds of Prey, have ever a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination to Carrion: And though ſuch poor Writers as I, are but Beggars, however no Beggar is ſo poor but he can keep a Cur, and no Author is ſo beggarly but he can keep a Critic. So I'm far from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0096900401:3"/>
thinking the Attacks of ſuch people either any honour or diſhonour, even to me, much leſs to Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi> I think with you, that whatever leſſer Wits have riſen ſince his Death, are but like Stars appearing when the Sun is ſet, that twinkle only in his abſence, and with the Rays they have borrowed from him. Our Wit (as you call it) is but Reflexion or Imitation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſcarce to be call'd ours. True Wit I believe, may be defin'd a Juſtneſs of Thought, and a Facility of Expreſſion; or (in the Midwives phraſe) a perfect Conception, with an eaſy Delivery. However this is far from a compleat definition; pray help me to a better, as I doubt not you can.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been ſo buſy of late in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting and tranſcribing ſome of my Madrigals, for a great Man or two who deſir'd to ſee them, that I have (with your Pardon) omitted to return you an Anſwer to your moſt ingenious Letter: So Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to the Publick, like Bankers to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, are profuſe in their voluntary Loans

to it, whilſt they forget to pay their more private and particular, as more juſt Debts, to their beſt and neareſt Friends. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I hope, you who have as much good Nature as good Senſe, (ſince they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are Companions) will have Patience with a Debtor, who you think has an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to pay you his Obligations, if he had wherewithal ready about him; and in the mean time ſhould conſider, when you have oblig'd me beyond my preſent Power of returning the Favour, that a Debtor may be an honeſt Man, if he but intends to be juſt when he is able, tho' late. But I ſhould be leſs juſt to you, the more I thought I could make a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to ſo much Profuſeneſs of Wit and Humanity together; which tho' they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom accompany each other, in other Men, are in you ſo equally met, I know not in which you moſt abound. But ſo much for my Opinion of you, which is, that your Wit and Ingenuity is equal'd by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but your Judgment, or Modeſty; which (though it be to pleaſe my ſelf) I muſt no more offend, than I can do either right.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I will ſay no more now of them, than that your good Wit ne'er for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited your good Judgment, but in your Partility to me and mine; ſo that if it

were poſſible for a harden'd Scribbler to be vainer than he is, what you write of me would make me more conceited, than what I ſcribble my ſelf; yet I muſt confeſs I ought to be more humbled by your Praiſe than exalted; which commends my little Senſe with ſo much more of yours, that I am diſparag'd and diſhearten'd by your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations; who give me an Example of your Wit in the firſt Part of your Letter, and a Definition of it in the laſt: to make writing well (that is like you) more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to me than ever it was before. Thus the more great and juſt your Example and Definition of Wit are, the leſs I am capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to follow them. Then the beſt way of ſhewing my Judgment, after having ſeen how you write, is to leave off writing; and the beſt way to ſhew my Friendship to you, is to put an end to your Trouble, and to conclude</p>

                  <p>WHEN I write to you, I foreſee a long Letter, and ought to beg your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0096900401:6"/>
Patience beforehand; for if it proves the longeſt, it will be of courſe the worſt I have troubled you with. Yet to expreſs my Gratitude at large for your obliging Letter, is not more my Duty than my Intereſt; as ſome People will abundantly thank you for one Piece of Kindneſs, to put you in mind of beſtowing another. The more favourable you are to me, the more diſtinctly I ſee my Faults; Spots and Blemiſhes you know, are never ſo plainly diſcovere'd as in the brighteſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine. Thus I am mortified by thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations which were deſign'd to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me: for Praiſe to a young Wit, is like Rain to a tender Flower; if it be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately beſtow'd, it chears and revives, but if too laviſhly, overcharges and depreſſes him. Moſt Men in years, as they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diſcouragers of Youth, are like old Trees, that being paſt Bearing themſelves, will ſuffer no young Plants to flouriſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them: But as if it were not enough to have out-done all your Coaevals in Wit, you will excel them in good Nature too. As for my <note n="a" place="bottom">His <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> written at 16 Years of Age.</note> green Eſſays, if you find any pleaſure in 'em, it muſt be ſuch as a Man naturally takes in obſerving the firſt Shoots and Buddings of a Tree which he

has rais'd himſelf: and 'tis impoſſible they ſhould be eſteem'd any otherwiſe, than as we value Fruits for being early, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs are the moſt inſipid, and the worſt of the Year. In a word, I muſt blame you for treating me with ſo much Compliment, which is at beſt but the Smoak of Friendſhip. I neither write, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with you, to gain your Praiſe but your Affection. Be ſo much my Friend as to appear my Enemy, and tell me my Faults, if not as a young Man, at leaſt as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienc'd Writer.</p>

                  <p>YOUR Letter of the Twenty-fifth of <hi>March</hi> I have receiv'd, which was more welcome to me than any thing cou'd be out of the Country, tho' it were one's Rent due that Day: and I can find no fault with it, but that it charges me with Want of Sincerity, or Juſtice, for giving you your Due; who ſhou'd not let your Modeſty be ſo unjuſt to your Merit, as to reject
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0096900401:8"/>
what is due to it, and call that Compliment which is ſo ſhort of your deſert, that it is rather degrading than exalting you. But if Compliment be the Smoak only of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (as you ſay) however you muſt allow there is no Smoak but there is ſome Fire; and as the Sacrifice of Incenſe offer'd to the Gods wou'd not have been half ſo ſweet to others, if it had not been for its Smoak; ſo Friendſhip like Love, cannot be without ſome Incenſe, to perfume the Name it wou'd praiſe and immortalize. But ſince you ſay you do not write to me to gain my <hi>Praiſe,</hi> but my <hi>Affection,</hi> pray how is it poſſible to have the one without the other? We muſt admire before we love. You affirm, you would have me ſo much your Friend as to appear your Enemy, and find out your Faults rather than your Perfections: But (my Friend) that would be ſo hard to do, that I who love no Difficulties, can't be perſuaded to it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Vanity of a Scribbler is ſuch, that he will never part with his own Judgment to gratify another's; eſpecially when he muſt take Pains to do it: And tho' I am proud to be of your Opinion, when you talk of any Thing, or Man but your ſelf, I cannot ſuffer you to murther your fame, with your own hand, without oppoſing you; eſpecially when you ſay your laſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

is the worſt (ſince the longeſt) you have favoured me with; which I therefore think the beſt, as the longeſt Life (if a good one) is the beſt, as it yields the more Variety and is more Exemplary; as a chearful Summer's Day, tho' longer than a dull one in the Winter, is leſs tedious and more entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Therefore let but your Friendſhip be like your Letter, as laſting as it is agreeable, and it can never be tedious, but more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and obliging to</p>

As to my enquiry after your Intrigues with the <hi>Muſes,</hi> you may allow me to make it, ſince no old Man can give ſo young, ſo great, and able a Favourite of theirs, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot contend with you. You muſt give me leave at once to wave all your Compliments, and to collect only this in general from 'em, that your Deſign is to encourage me. But I ſeparate from all the reſt that Paragraph or two, in which you make me ſo warm an Offer of your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Were I poſſeſs'd of That, it would put an End to all thoſe Speeches with which you now make me bluſh; and change them to wholſome Advices, and free Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, which might make me wiſer and happier. I know 'tis the general Opinion, that Friendſhip is beſt contracted betwixt Perſons of equal Age: but I have ſo much Intereſt to be of another Mind, that you muſt pardon me if I cannot forbear telling you a few Notions of mine, in oppoſition to that Opinion.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place 'tis obſervable, that the Love we bear to our Friends is generally cauſed by our finding the ſame Diſpoſitions in them, which we feel in our ſelves. This is but Self-love at the Bottom: Whereas the Affection betwixt People of different Ages cannot well be ſuch, the Inclinations of ſuch
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0096900401:12"/>
being commonly various. The Friendſhip of two young Men is often occaſioned by Love of Pleaſure or Voluptuouſneſs, each being deſirous, for his own ſake, of one to aſſiſt or incourage him in the Courſes he purſues; as that of two old Men is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently on the ſcore of ſome Profit, Lucre, or Deſign upon others: Now, as a young Man who is leſs acquainted with the Ways of the World, has in all probability leſs of Intereſt; and an old Man who may be weary of himſelf, leſs of Self-love; ſo the Friendſhip between them is the more likely to be true, and unmix'd with too much Self-regard. One may add to this, that ſuch a Friendſhip is of greater Uſe and Advantage to both; for the old Man will grow more gay and agreeable to pleaſe the young one; and the young Man more diſcreet and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the help of the old one; ſo it may prove a Cure of thoſe epidemical Diſeaſes of Age and Youth, Sourneſs and Madneſs. I hope you will not need many Arguments to convince you of the Poſſibility of this; One alone abundantly ſatisfies me, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces to the very Heart; which is, that <hi>I am,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> was at this time about Seventy Years old, Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> under Seventeen.</note>

                  <p>I Shou'd believe my ſelf happy in your good Opinion, but that you treat me ſo much in a Style of Compliment. It has been obſerv'd of Women, that they are more ſubject in their youth to be touch'd with Vanity than Men, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their being generally treated this way; but the weakeſt Women are not more ſo than that weak claſs of Men, who are thought to pique them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their Wit. The World is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wanting, when a Coxcomb is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing himſelf, to help to give him the finiſhing Stroke.</p>
                  <p>Every Man is apt to think his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour overſtock'd with Vanity, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but fancy, there are certain Times, when moſt people are in a diſpoſition of being inform'd; and 'tis incredible what a vaſt Good a little Truth might do, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſuch ſeaſons. A very ſmall Alms will do a great kindneſs, to people in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0096900401:14"/>
I could name an acquaintance of yours, who wou'd at this time think himſelf more obliged to you for the Information of his Faults, than the Confirmation of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. If you would make thoſe the ſubject of a Letter, it might be as long as I could wiſh your Letters always were.</p>
                  <p>I do not wonder you have hitherto found ſome difficulty (as you are pleas'd to ſay) in writing to me, ſince you have always choſen the Task of commending me: Take but the other way, and I dare ingage you will find none at all.</p>
                  <p>As for my Verſes which you praiſe ſo much, I may truly ſay they had never been the cauſe of any Vanity in me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what they gave me when they firſt occaſion'd my acquaintance with you. But I have ſeveral times ſince been in danger of this Vice, as often I mean as I receiv'd any Letters from you.</p>
                  <p>'Tis certain, the greateſt magnifying Glaſſes in the World are a Man's own Eyes, when they look upon his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; yet even in thoſe, I cannot fancy my ſelf ſo extremely like <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> as you wou'd perſuade me: If I muſt be like him, 'tis you will make me ſo,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0096900401:15"/>
by complimenting me into a better opinion of my ſelf than I deſerve: They made him think he was the <hi>Son of Jupiter,</hi> and you aſſure me I am a Man of Parts. But is this all you can ſay to my honour? You ſaid ten times as much before, when you call'd me your Friend. After having made me believe I poſſeſs'd a ſhare in your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to treat me with Compliments and ſweet Sayings, is like the proceeding with poor <hi>Sancho Panca:</hi> They had perſuaded him that he enjoy'd a great Dominion, and then gave him nothing to ſubſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but <hi>Wafers</hi> and <hi>Marmalade.</hi> In our Days, the greateſt obligation you can lay upon a Wit, is to make a Fool of him. For as when Madmen are found incurable, wiſe Men give them their Way, and pleaſe them as well as they can; ſo when thoſe incorrigible things, Poets, are once irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably Be-Mus'd, the beſt way both to quiet them, and ſecure your ſelves from the effects of their Frenzy, is to feed their Vanity; (which indeed for the moſt part is all that is fed in a Poet.)</p>
                  <p>You may believe me, I could be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily glad that all you ſay were as true, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to me, as it wou'd be to your ſelf, for ſeveral weighty Reaſons; but for none ſo much, as that I might be to you what you

                  <p>I HAVE now chang'd the Scene from the Town to the Country; from <hi>Will</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe to <hi>Windſor</hi> Foreſt. I find no other difference than this, betwixt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Town-Wits, and the downright Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Fools; that the firſt are pertly in the Wrong, with a little more Flouriſh and Gaiety, and the laſt neither in the Right nor the Wrong, but confirmed in a ſtupid, ſettled Medium betwixt both. However, methinks theſe are moſt in the Right, who quietly and eaſily reſign themſelves over to the gentle Reign of Dulneſs, which the Wits muſt do at laſt, tho' after a great deal of Noiſe, Pother, and Reſiſtance. Ours are a ſort of modeſt, inoffenſive People, who neither have Senſe, nor pretend to any, but enjoy a jovial Sort of Dulneſs. They are commonly known in the World by the Name of honeſt, civil Gentlemen. They live much as they ride, at random; a kind of hunting Life, purſuing with earneſtneſs and hazard, ſomething not worth the catching; never in the way, nor out of it. I can't but prefer Solitude to the Company of all theſe; for tho' a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0096900401:18"/>
Man's ſelf may poſſibly be the worſt Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to converſe with in the World, yet one would think the Company of a Perſon whom we have the greateſt regard to, and affection for, could not be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant: As a Man in love with a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, deſires no Converſation but hers, ſo a Man in love with himſelf, (as moſt Men are) may be beſt pleaſed with his own. Beſides, if the trueſt and moſt uſeful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, be the knowledge of our ſelves, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude conducing moſt to make us look into our ſelves, ſhould be the moſt inſtructive State of Life. We ſee nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, than Men, who for the ſake of the circumſtantial Part, and meer outſide of Life, have been half their Days rambling out of their Nature, and ought to be ſent into Solitude to ſtudy themſelves over again. People are uſually ſpoil'd inſtead of being taught, at their coming into the World; whereas by being more converſant with Obſcurity, without any Pains, they would naturally follow what they were meant for. In a word, if a Man be a Coxcomb, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude is his beſt School; and if he be a Fool, it is his beſt Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are good Reaſons for my own Stay here, but I wiſh I could give you any for your coming hither, except that I earneſtly invite you. And yet I can't help

diſpair of ſeeing you, who, in return to your inviting me to your Foreſt, invite you to my Foreſt, the Town; where the Beaſts that inhabit, tame or wild, of long Ears or Horns, purſue one another either out of Love or Hatred.

Or if you mean to improve the worſt Pieces, which are ſuch as to render them very good, would require a great addition, and almoſt the entire new writing of them? Or, laſtly, if you mean the middle ſort, as the Songs and Love-Verſes? For theſe will need only to be ſhortned, to omit repetition; the Words remaining very little different from what they were before. Pray let me know

in Wit, like thoſe in Trade, take leaſt Pains to ſet off their Goods; while the Haberdaſhers of ſmall Wit, ſpare for no Decorations or Ornaments.

                  <p>I HAVE received yours of the 26th, as kind as it is ingenious, for which therefore I moſt heartily thank you: It would have been much more welcome to me, had it not inform'd me of your want of Health: But you who have a Mind ſo

vigorous, may well be contented with its crazy Habitation; ſince (you know) the old Similitude ſays, The Keenneſs of the Mind ſooneſt wears out the Body; as the ſharpeſt Sword ſooneſt deſtroys the Scabbard: So that (as I ſay) you muſt be ſatisfied with your apprehenſion of an uneaſy Life, (tho' I hope not a ſhort one;) notwithſtanding that generally you ſound Wits (tho' weak Bodies) are immortal hereafter, by that Genius which ſhortens your preſent Life to prolong that of the future.

                  <p>Now to ſay ſomething to what you write, concerning the preſent epidemick Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Mind and Age, Calumny; I know it is no more to be avoided (at one time or another of our Lives) than a Fever, or an Ague; and as often thoſe Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers attend, or threaten the beſt Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from the worſt Air; ſo does that malignant Air of Calumny, ſooneſt attack the ſound and elevated in Mind, as Storms of Wind the talleſt and moſt fruitful Trees; whilſt the low and weak, for bowing and moving to and fro, are, by their Weakneſs, ſecure from the danger and violence of the Tempeſt.

                  <p>I Receiv'd yours of the 9th yeſterday, which has (like the reſt of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) at once pleas'd and inſtructed me; ſo that I aſſure you, you can no more write too much to your abſent Friends, than ſpeak too much to the preſent. This is a Truth that all Men own who have either ſeen your Writings, or heard your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; enough to make others ſhow their Judgment, in ceaſing to write or talk, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to you, or in your company. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I ſpeak or write to you, not to pleaſe you, but my ſelf; ſince I provoke your Anſwers; which, whilſt they humble me, give me vanity; tho' I am leſſen'd by you even when you commend me; ſince you commend my little Senſe with ſo much more of yours, that you put me out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, whilſt you would keep me in it.

                  <p>As to the damn'd Verſes I entruſted you with, I hope you will let them undergo your Purgatory, to ſave them from other People's damning them; ſince the Criticks, who are generally the firſt damn'd in this Life, like the damn'd below, never leave to bring thoſe above them under their own Circumſtances. I beg you to peruſe my Papers, and ſelect what you think beſt, or moſt tolerable, and look over them again; for I reſolve ſuddenly to print ſome of them, as a harden'd old Gameſter will (in ſpite of all former ill uſage by Fortune) puſh on an ill Hand, in expectation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering himſelf; eſpecially, ſince I have ſuch a <hi>Croupier</hi> or Second to ſtand by me as Mr. <hi>Pope.</hi>

                  <p>MR. <hi>Engiefyld</hi> being upon his Journey to <hi>London,</hi> tells me I muſt write to you by him, which I do, not more to comply with his deſire, than to gratify my own; tho' I did it ſo lately by the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger you ſent hither: I take it too as an opportunity of ſending you the fair Copy of the <hi>Poem</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">The Original of it in Blots, and with Figures of the References from Copy to Copy, in Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Hand, is in the <hi>Harley-Library,</hi> among other ſuch <hi>Broüillons</hi> of Mr. <hi>Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherley</hi>'s Poems, corrected by him. <hi>Vid.

Mr. <hi>Englefyld</hi> is ignorant of the Contents, and I hope your prudence will let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo, for my ſake no leſs than your own: Since if you ſhould reveal any thing of this nature, it would be no wonder Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſhould be rais'd, and there are thoſe (I fear) who would be ready to improve them to my diſadvantage. I am ſorry you told the great Man, whom you met in the <hi>Court of Requeſts,</hi> that your Papers were in my hands: No Man alive ſhall ever know any ſuch thing from me; and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0096900401:31"/>
I give you this warning beſides, that tho' your ſelf ſhould ſay I had any way aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted you, I am notwithſtanding reſolv'd to deny it.</p>
                  <p>The method of the Copy I ſend you is very different from what it was, and much more regular: For the better help of your Memory, I deſire you to compare it by the <hi>Figures</hi> in the Margin, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame in this Letter. The Poem is now divided into four Parts, mark'd with the literal Figures I. II. III. IV. The firſt contains the <hi>praiſe</hi> of Dulneſs, and ſhews how upon ſeveral ſuppoſitions, it paſſes for 1. Religion. 2. Philoſophy. 3. Example. 4. Wit. And 5. The cauſe of Wit, and the end of it. The ſecond Part contains the <hi>advantages</hi> of Dulneſs: 1ſt, In Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and 2dly, at Court; where the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes of the Byaſs of a Bowl, and the Weights of a Clock, are directly tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to illuſtrate thoſe advantages of Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tho' introduced before in a place where there was no mention made of them; (which was your only objection to my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them.) The third contains the <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of Dulneſs in all Stations, and ſhews in a great many Particulars, that it is ſo fortunate, as to be eſteem'd ſome good Quality or other in all ſorts of People; that it is thought Quiet, Senſe, Caution,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0096900401:32"/>
Policy, Prudence, Majeſty, Valour, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, Honeſty, &amp;c. The fourth Part I have wholly added, as a Climax which ſums up all the <hi>praiſe, advantage,</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> of Dulneſs in a few words, and ſtrengthens them all by the oppoſition of the <hi>diſgrace, diſadvantage,</hi> and <hi>unhappineſs</hi> of Wit, with which it concludes <note n="b" place="bottom">This is totally omitted in the preſent Edition: Some of the Lines in the H. M. are theſe.

                  <p>Tho' the whole be as ſhort again as at firſt, there is not one Thought omitted, but what is a Repetition of ſomething in your firſt Volume, or in this very Paper: Some Thoughts are contracted, where they ſeem'd encompaſs'd with too many words; and ſome new expreſs'd, or added, where I thought there wanted heightning, (as you'll ſee parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culary in the Simile of the <hi>Clock-Weights;</hi>

                        <p>It was originally thus expreſs'd: <q>As Clocks run faſteſt when moſt Lead is on.</q> We find it ſo in a Letter of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> to Mr. <hi>Wycherley,</hi> dated <hi>April</hi> 3, 1705. and in a paper of Verſes of his, <hi>To the Author of a Poem call'd Succeſſio,</hi> which got out in a Miſcellany in 1712, three Years before Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> died, and two after he had laid aſide the whole deſign of publiſhing any Poems.</p>

and the Verſification throughout, is, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuch, as no Body can be ſhock'd at. The repeated permiſſions you give me of dealing freely with you, will (I hope) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe what I have done; for if I have not ſpar'd you when I thought Severity would do you a kindneſs, I have not mangled you where I thought there was no abſolute need of Amputation. As to Particulars, I can ſatisfy you better when we meet; in the mean time pray write to me when you can, you cannot too often.</p>

Nevertheleſs, ſhe is reſolv'd henceforth to be ſo cautious as to appear very little more in the World, except it be as an attendant on your Muſe, or as a Foil, not a Rival to her Wit, or Fame: So that let your Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlewoman appear when ſhe will in the World <note n="*" place="bottom">This, and the following Extract, are a full Confutation of the Lying Spirit of <hi>John Dennis</hi> and others, who impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> wrote theſe Verſes on himſelf, (tho' publiſh'd by Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> ſix Years before his Death.)

The firſt <hi>Broüillon</hi> of thoſe Verſes, and the ſecond Copy with Corrections, are both yet extant in Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi>'s own hand; from which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that if they received any alteration from Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> it was in the Omiſſion of ſome of his own Praiſes.</note>, my old worn-out Jade of a loſt Reputation, ſhall be her attendant into it,

                  <p>I MUST thank you for a Book of your Miſcellanies, which <hi>Tonſon</hi> ſent me, I ſuppoſe by your Order; and all I can tell you of it is, that nothing has lately been better receiv'd by the Publick, than your part of it; you have only diſpleas'd the Criticks by pleaſing them too well; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not left them a Word to ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, againſt you and your performances; ſo that now your hand is in you muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, 'till my Prophecy's of you be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd.

                  <p>I AM glad you receiv'd the <note n="*" place="bottom">Jacob Tonſon<hi>'s ſixth Vol. of</hi> Miſcellany Poems.</note> 
                     <hi>Miſcellany,</hi> if it were only to ſhow you that there
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0096900401:44"/>
are as bad Poets in this Nation as your Servant. This modern Cuſtom of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Miſcellanies, is very uſeful to the Poets, who, like other Thieves, eſcape by getting into a Crowd, and herd together like <hi>Banditti,</hi> ſafe only in their Multitude. Methinks <hi>Strada</hi> has given a good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of theſe kind of Collections; <hi>Nullus hodié mortalium aut naſcitur, aut moritur, aut proeliatur, aut ruſticatur, aut abit peregrè; aut redit, aut nubit; aut eſt, aut non eſt, (nam etiam mortuis iſti canunt) cui non illi ea templò cudant Epicoedia, Genethaliaca, Protreptica, Panegyrica, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalamia, Vaticinia, Propemptica, Saterica, Paroenctica, Noenias, Nugas.</hi> As to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which you ſay my part has met with, it is to be attributed to what you were pleas'd to ſay of me to the World; which you do well to call your <hi>Prophecy,</hi> ſince whatever is ſaid in my favour, muſt be a Prediction of things that are not yet; you, like a true Godfather, engage on my part for much more than ever I can perform. My Paſtoral Muſe, like other Country Girls, is but put out of Countenance, by what you Courtiers ſay to her; yet I hope you would not deceive me too far, as knowing that a young Scribler's vanity needs no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits from abroad: for Nature like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Mother, kindly takes care to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0096900401:45"/>
her ſons with as much of their own, as is neceſſary for their Satisfaction. If my Verſes ſhould meet with a few flying Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, <hi>Virgil</hi> has taught me that a young Author has not too much reaſon to be pleas'd with them, when he conſiders, that the natural conſequence of Praiſe, is Envy and Calumny.

When once a Man has appear'd as a Poet, he may give up his Pretenſions to all the rich and thriving Arts: Thoſe who have once made their court to thoſe Miſtreſſes without Portions, the Muſes, are never like to ſet up for Fortunes. But for my part, I ſhall be ſatisfy'd if I can loſe my Time agreeably this way, without loſing my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: As for gaining any, I am as indifferent in the Matter as <hi>Falſtaffe</hi> was, and may ſay of <hi>Fame</hi> as he did of <hi>Honour, If it comes, it comes unlook'd for; and there's an End on't.</hi> I can be content with a bare ſaving game, without being thought an Eminent hand, (with which Title <hi>Jacob</hi> has graciouſly dignify'd his adventurers and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers in Poetry.) <hi>Jacob</hi> creates Poets, as Kings ſometimes do Knights, not for their honour, but for money.

I hope (in point of your good nature) you will have no cruel Charity for thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of mine, you were ſo willing to be troubled with; which I take moſt infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kind of you, and ſhall acknowledge with gratitude, as long as I live. No Friend can do more for his Friend than preſerving his Reputation (nay not by preſerving his Life)
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0096900401:51"/>
ſince by preſerving his Life he can only make him live about threeſcore or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Years; but by preſerving his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he can make him live as long as the World laſts; ſo ſave him from damning, when he is gone to the Devil: Therefore I pray condemn me in private, as the Thieves do their Accomplices in <hi>Newgate,</hi> to ſave them from condemnation by the Publick. Be moſt kindly unmerciful to my poetical Faults, and do with my Papers, as you Country-gentlemen do with your Trees, ſlaſh, cut, and lop-off the Excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies and dead Parts of my wither'd Bayes, that the little remainder may live the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and increaſe the value of them, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing the number. I have troubled you with my Papers rather to give you Pain than Pleaſure, notwithſtanding your compliment, which ſays, you take the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kindly: Such is the generoſity to your Friends, that you take it kindly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by them to do them a kindneſs; and you think it done to you, when they give you an opportunity to do it to them. Wherefore you may be ſure to be troubled with my Letters out of Intereſt, if not Kindneſs; ſince mine to you will procure yours to me, ſo that I write to you more for my own ſake than yours; leſs to make you think I write well, than to learn from
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0096900401:52"/>
you to write better. Thus you ſee Intereſt in my Kindneſs, which is like the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the World, rather to make a Friend than be a Friend; but I am yours, as a true <hi>Plain-dealer.</hi>

your ſelf more trouble about them, which may prevent the pleaſure you have, and may give the World, in writing upon new Subjects of your own, whereby you will much better entertain your ſelf and others. Now as to your Remarks upon the whole Volume of my Papers; all that I deſire of you, is to mark in the Margin (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out defacing the Copy at all) either any Repetition of Words, Matter, or Senſe, or any Thoughts, or Words too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated; which if you will be ſo kind as to do for me, you will ſupply my <hi>want of Memory,</hi> with your good One, and my <hi>Deficiences of Senſe,</hi> with the Infallibility of yours; which if you do, you will moſt infinitely oblige me, who almoſt repent the trouble I have given you, ſince ſo much.

                  <p>I AM ſorry you perſiſt to take ill my not accepting your Invitation, and to find (if I miſtake not) your Exception not unmixt with ſome Suſpicion. Be certain I ſhall moſt carefully obſerve your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, not to croſs over, or deface the Copy of your Papers for the future, and only to mark in the Margin the Repetitions: But as this can ſerve no further than to get rid of thoſe Repetitions, and no way rectify the <hi>Method,</hi> nor <hi>connect</hi> the <hi>Matter,</hi> nor improve the <hi>Poetry</hi> in <hi>Expreſſion</hi> or <hi>Numbers,</hi> without further blotting, adding, and altering; ſo it really is my opinion, and deſire, that you ſhould take your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers out of my hands into your own; and that no Alterations may be made but when

times with great ſatisfaction. The Preface is very judicious and very learned; and the Verſes very tender and eaſy. The Author ſeems to have a particular Genius for that kind of Poetry, and a Judgment that much exceeds the years you told me he was of. He has taken very freely from the Ancients, but what he has mixt of his own with theirs, is no way inferior to what he has taken from them. 'Tis no flattery at all to ſay, that <hi>Virgil</hi> had written nothing ſo good at his Age<note n="*" place="margin">Sixteen.</note>. I ſhall take it as a favour if you will bring me acquainted with him; and if he will give himſelf the trouble any morning to call at my Houſe, I ſhall be very glad to read the Verſes over with him, and give him my opinion of the particulars more largely than I can well do in this Letter.

                  <p>I Receiv'd the favour of your Letter, and ſhall be very glad of the continuance of a correſpondence by which I am like to be ſo great a gainer. I hope when I have the happineſs of ſeeing you again in <hi>London,</hi> not only to read over the Verſes I have now of yours, but more that you have written ſince; for I make no doubt but any one who writes ſo well, muſt write more. Not that I think the moſt voluminous Poets al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the beſt, I believe the contrary is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true. I mention'd ſomewhat to you in <hi>London</hi> of a <hi>Paſtoral Comedy,</hi> which I ſhould be glad to hear you had thought upon ſince. I find <hi>Menage</hi> in his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon <hi>Taſſo</hi>'s <hi>Aminta,</hi> reckons up four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Paſtoral Plays in <hi>Italian:</hi> And in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over my old <hi>Italian</hi> Books, I find a great many Paſtorals and Piſcatory Plays, which I ſuppoſe <hi>Menage</hi> reckons together. I find alſo by <hi>Menage,</hi> that <hi>Taſſo</hi> is not the firſt that writ in that kind, he mentioning an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other before him, which he himſelf had never ſeen, nor indeed have I. But as the <hi>Aminta, Paſtor Fido,</hi> and <hi>Filli di Sciro</hi> of <hi>Bonarelli</hi> are the three beſt, ſo I think there
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0096900401:63"/>
is no diſpute but <hi>Aminta</hi> is the beſt of the three: Not but that the Diſcourſes in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor Fido</hi> are more entertaining and copious in ſeveral peoples opinion, tho' not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Paſtoral; and the Fable of <hi>Bonarelli</hi> more ſurprizing. I do not remember many in other Languages, that have written in this kind with ſucceſs. <hi>Racan</hi>'s <hi>Bergeries</hi> are much inferior to his Lyrick Poems; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are all too full of Conceits. <hi>Rapin</hi> will have the deſign of Paſtoral Plays to be taken from the <hi>Cyclops</hi> of <hi>Euripides.</hi> I am ſure there is nothing of this kind in <hi>Engliſh</hi> worth mentioning, and therefore you have that Field open to your ſelf. You ſee I write to you without any ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint or method, as things come into my head, and therefore pray uſe the ſame free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with me, who am, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I Cannot omit the firſt opportunity of making you my acknowledgments for reviewing thoſe Papers of mine. You have no leſs right to correct me, than the ſame hand that rais'd a Tree has to prune it. I am convinc'd as well as you, that one may
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0096900401:64"/>
correct too much; for in Poetry as in Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Man may lay Colours one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, till they ſtiffen and deaden the Piece. Beſides to beſtow heightning on every part is monſtrous: Some parts ought to be lower than the reſt; and nothing looks more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, than a Work, where the Thoughts, however different in their own nature, ſeem all on a level: 'Tis like a Meadow newly mown, where <hi>Weeds, Graſs,</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> are all laid even, and appear undiſtinguiſh'd. I believe too that ſometimes our firſt Thoughts are the beſt, as the firſt ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Grapes makes the fineſt and richeſt Wine.</p>
                  <p>I have not attempted any thing of Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Comedy, becauſe I think the Taſte of our Age will not reliſh a Poem of that ſort. People ſeek for what they call <hi>Wit,</hi> on all ſubjects, and in all places; not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that Nature loves Truth ſo well, that it hardly ever admits of flouriſhing: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi> is to Nature what <hi>Paint</hi> is to Beauty; it is not only needleſs, but impairs what it wou'd improve. There is a certain Majeſty in Simplicity which is far above all the Quaintneſs of Wit: inſomuch that the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics have excluded it from the loftieſt Poet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as well as the loweſt, and forbid it to the Epic no leſs than the Paſtoral. I ſhou'd certainly diſpleaſe all thoſe who are charm'd
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0096900401:65"/>
with <hi>Guarini</hi> and <hi>Bonarelli,</hi> and imitate <hi>Taſſo</hi> not only in the Simplicity of his Thoughts, but in that of the <hi>Fable</hi> too. If ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing diſcoveries ſhou'd have place in the ſtory of a Paſtoral Comedy, I believe it wou'd be more agreeable to Probability to make them the effects of <hi>Chance</hi> than of <hi>Deſign;</hi> Intrigue not being very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with that Innocence, which ought to conſtitute a Shepherd's Character. There is nothing in all the <hi>Aminta</hi> (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) but happens by meer accident; unleſs it be the meeting of <hi>Aminta</hi> with <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> at the <hi>Fountain,</hi> which is the contrivance of <hi>Daphne,</hi> and even that is the moſt ſimple in the world: The contrary is obſervable in <hi>Paſtor Fido,</hi> where <hi>Coriſca</hi> is ſo perfect a Miſtreſs of Intrigue, that the Plot cou'd not have been brought to paſs without her. I am inclin'd to think the Paſtoral Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy has another diſadvantage, as to the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> Its general deſign is to make us in love with the Innocence of a rural Life, ſo that to introduce Shepherds of a vicious Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter muſt in ſome meaſure debaſe it; and hence it may come to paſs, that even the virtuous Characters will not ſhine ſo much, for want of being oppos'd to their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.—Theſe Thoughts are purely my own, and therefore I have reaſon to doubt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0096900401:66"/>
them: but I hope your Judgment will ſet me right.</p>
                  <p>I wou'd beg your opinion too as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other point: It is how far the liberty of <hi>Borrowing</hi> may extend? I have defended it ſometimes by ſaying, that it ſeems not ſo much the Perfection of Senſe, to ſay things that have <hi>never</hi> been ſaid before, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thoſe <hi>beſt</hi> that have been ſaid <hi>ofteneſt;</hi> and that Writers in the caſe of borrowing from others, are like Trees which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wou'd produce only one ſort of Fruit, but by being grafted upon others, may yield variety. A mutual commerce makes Poetry flouriſh; but then Poets like Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, ſhou'd repay with ſomething of their own what they take from others; not like Pyrates, make prize of all they meet. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to tell me ſincerely, if I have not ſtretch'd this Licence too far in theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorals? I hope to become a Critic by your Precepts, and a Poet by your Example. Since I have ſeen your Eclogues, I cannot be much pleas'd with my own; however you have not taken away all my Vanity, ſo long as you give me leave to profeſs my ſelf</p>

                  <p>I Had ſooner return'd you thanks for the favour of your Letter, but that I was in hopes of giving you an account at the ſame time of my Journey to <hi>Windſor;</hi> but I am now forc'd to put that quite off, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to go to my Corporation of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> I think you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in the right in your Notions of Paſtoral, but I am of opinion, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy of Wit you mention, tho' 'tis what pleaſes the common people, is not what ever pleaſes the beſt judges. <hi>Paſtor Fido</hi> indeed has had more admirers than <hi>Aminta;</hi> but I will venture to ſay, there is a great deal of difference between the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of one and the other. <hi>Coriſca,</hi> which is a Character generally admir'd by the ordinary judges, is intolerable in a Paſtoral; and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narelli</hi>'s fancy of making his Shepherdeſs in love with two men equally, is not to be defended, whatever pains he has taken to do it. As for what you ask of the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Borrowing;</hi> 'tis very evident the beſt <hi>Latin</hi> Poets have extended this very far; and none ſo far as <hi>Virgil,</hi> who is the beſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0096900401:68"/>
of them. As for the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets, if we cannot trace them ſo plainly, 'tis perhaps becauſe we have none before them; 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that moſt of them borrow'd from <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> has been accus'd of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that wrote before him, that his Thefts might not be diſcover'd. The beſt of the modern Poets in all Languages, are thoſe that have the neareſt copied the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. Indeed in all the common Subjects of Poetry, the Thoughts are ſo obvious (at leaſt if they are natural) that whoever writes laſt, muſt write things like what have been ſaid before: But they may as well applaud the Ancients for the Arts of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, and accuſe the Moderns of having ſtol'n thoſe Inventions from them; it being evident in all ſuch caſes, that whoever live firſt, muſt firſt find them out. 'Tis true, indeed, when
<q>
                        <l>—unus &amp; alter Aſſuitur pannus,</l>
                     </q>
when there is one or two bright Thoughts ſtol'n, and all the reſt is quite different from it, a Poem makes a very fooliſh figure: But when 'tis all melted down together, and the Gold of the Ancients ſo mixt with that of the Moderns, that none can diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the one from the other, I can never
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0096900401:69"/>
find fault with it. I cannot however but own to you, that there are others of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent opinion, and that I have ſhewn your Verſes to ſome who have made that obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them. I have ſo much Company round me while I write this, and ſuch a noiſe in my ears, that 'tis impoſſible I ſhould write any thing but Nonſenſe, ſo muſt break off abruptly.</p>

Having been abſent about ſix weeks, I read over your Paſtorals again, with a great deal of pleaſure, and to judge the better read <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>'s Eclogues, and <hi>Spenſer</hi>'s Calendar, at the ſame time; and I aſſure you I continue the ſame opinion I had always of them. By the little hints you take upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to improve them, 'tis probable you
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0096900401:70"/>
will make them yet better againſt Winter; tho' there is a mean to be kept even in that too, and a Man may correct his Verſes till he takes away the true Spirit of them; eſpecially if he ſubmits to the correction of ſome who paſs for great Critics, by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Rules, and never enter into the true Deſign and Genius of an Author. I have ſeen ſome of theſe that would hardly allow any one good Ode in <hi>Horace,</hi> who cry <hi>Virgil</hi> wants fancy, and that <hi>Homer</hi> is very incorrect. While they talk at this rate, one would think them above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rate of mortals: but generally they are great admirers of <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Lucan;</hi> and when they write themſelves, we find out all the Myſtery. They ſcan their Verſes upon their Fingers; run after Conceits and glaring Thoughts; their Poems are all made up of Couplets, of which the firſt may be laſt, or the laſt firſt, without any ſort of prejudice to their Works; in which there is no Deſign, or Method, or any thing Natural or Juſt. For you are certainly in the right, that in all Writings whatſoever (not Poetry only) <hi>Nature</hi> is to be follow'd; and we ſhou'd be jealous of our ſelves for being fond of <hi>Similies, Conceits,</hi> and what they call ſaying <hi>Fine Things.</hi> When we were in the North, my Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> ſhew'd
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0096900401:71"/>
me a Letter he had receiv'd from a certain great <note n="*" place="bottom">The Earl of <hi>P.</hi>
                     </note> General in <hi>Spain;</hi> I told him I wou'd by all means have that General recall'd, and ſet to writing here at home, for it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a Man with ſo much Wit as he ſhew'd, cou'd be fit to command an Army, or do any other Buſineſs. As for what you ſay of Expreſſion: 'tis indeed the ſame thing to Wit, as Dreſs is to Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I have ſeen many Women over-dreſt, and ſeveral look better in a careleſs Night-gown, with their hair about their ears, than Mademoiſelle <hi>Spanheim</hi> dreſt for a Ball. I do not deſign to be in <hi>London</hi> till towards the Parliament: then I ſhall certainly be there; and hope by that time you will have finiſht your Paſtorals as you would have them appear in the world, and particularly the third of <hi>Autumn</hi> which I have not yet ſeen. Your laſt Eclogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſame Subject as that of mine on Mrs. <hi>Tempeſt</hi>'s Death, I ſhou'd take it very kindly in you to give it a little turn, as if it were to the Memory of the ſame Lady, if they were not written for ſome particular Woman whom you wou'd make immortal. You may take occaſion to ſhew the difference between Poets Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, and other Men's. I only hint this,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0096900401:72"/>
which you may either do, or let alone juſt as you think fit. I ſhall be very much pleas'd to ſee you again in Town, and to hear from you in the mean time. I am with very much eſteem,</p>

                  <p>AFter the Thoughts I have already ſent you on the ſubject of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, you deſire my opinion as to ſome farther particulars. There are indeed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Niceties, which tho' not much obſerved even by correct Verſifiers, I cannot but think deſerve to be better regarded.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not enough that nothing offends the Ear, but a good Poet will adapt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sounds, as well as Words, to the things he treats of. So that there is (if one may expreſs it ſo) a Style of Sound. As in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing a gliding Stream, the Numbers ſhou'd run eaſy and flowing; in deſcribing a rough Torrent or Deluge, ſonorous and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0096900401:73"/>
and ſo of the reſt. This is evident every where in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and no where elſe that I know of to any obſervable degree. The following Examples will make this plain, which I have taken from <hi>Vida.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Molle viam tacito lapſu per levia radit.</l>
                     <l>Incedit tardo molimine ſubſidendo.</l>
                     <l>Luctantes ventos, tempeſtateſque ſonoras.</l>
                     <l>Immenſo cum praecipitans ruit Oceano Nox.</l>
                     <l>Telum imbelle ſine ictu, Conjecit.</l>
                     <l>Tolle moras, cape ſaxa manu, cape robora Paſtor,</l>
                     <l>Ferte citi flammas data tela, repellite peſtem.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>This, I think, is what very few obſerve in practice, and is undoubtedly of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful force in imprinting the Image on the reader: We have one excellent Example of it in our Language, Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Ode on St. <hi>Caecilia</hi>'s Day, entitled, <hi>Alexander</hi>'s <hi>Feaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Every nice Ear, muſt (I believe) have obſerv'd, that in any ſmooth <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſe of ten ſyllables, there is naturally a <hi>Pauſe</hi> at the fourth, fifth, or ſixth ſyllable. It is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0096900401:74"/>
upon theſe the Ear reſts, and upon the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Change and Management of which depends the Variety of Verſification. For example,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>At the fifth.</hi> Where-e'er thy Navy ‖ ſpreads her canvaſs Wings,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>At the fourth.</hi> Homage to thee ‖ and Peace to all ſhe brings.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>At the ſixth.</hi> Like Tracts of Leverets ‖ in Morning Snow.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Now I fancy, that to preſerve an exact Harmony and Variety, the Pauſes of the 4th or 6th ſhou'd not be continu'd above three lines together, without the Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of another; elſe it will be apt to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Ear with one continu'd Tone, at leaſt it does mine: That at the 5th runs quicker, and carries not quite ſo dead a weight, ſo tires not ſo much tho' it be continued longer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another nicety is in relation to <hi>Exple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> whether Words or Syllables, which are made uſe of purely to ſupply a vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: <hi>Do</hi> before Verbs plural is abſolutely ſuch; and it is not improbable but future Refiners may explode <hi>did</hi> and <hi>does</hi> in the ſame manner, which are almoſt always
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0096900401:75"/>
uſed for the ſake of Rhime. The ſame Cauſe has occaſioned the promiſcuous uſe of <hi>You</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> to the ſame Perſon, which can never ſound ſo graceful as either one or the other.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I would alſo object to the Irruption of <hi>Alexandrine</hi> Verſes of twelve ſyllables, which I think ſhould never be allow'd but when ſome remarkable Beauty or Propriety in them attones for the Liberty: Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has been too free of theſe, eſpecially in his latter Works. I am of the ſame opinion as to <hi>Triple Rhimes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. I could equally object to the <hi>Repetition</hi> of the ſame Rhimes within four or ſix lines of each other, as tireſome to the Ear thro' their Monotony.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Monoſyllable-Lines,</hi> unleſs very artfully managed, are ſtiff, or languiſhing: but may be beautiful to expreſs Melancholy, Slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Labour.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To come to the <hi>Hiatus,</hi> or Gap be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two words which is caus'd by two Vowels opening on each other (upon which you deſire me to be particular) I think the rule in this caſe is either to uſe the <hi>Caeſura,</hi> or admit the <hi>Hiatus,</hi> juſt as the Ear is leaſt
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0096900401:76"/>
ſhock'd by either: For the <hi>Caeſura</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times offends the Ear more than the <hi>Hiatus</hi> itſelf, and our language is naturally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd with Conſonants: As for example; If in this Verſe,
<q>
                        <l>The Old have Int'reſt ever in their Eye,</l>
                     </q>
we ſhould ſay, to avoid the <hi>Hiatus,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>But th' Old have Int'reſt—</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hiatus</hi> which has the worſt effect, is when one word ends with the ſame Vowel that begins the following; and next to this, thoſe Vowels whoſe ſounds come neareſt to each other are moſt to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. O, A, or U, will bear a more full and graceful Sound than E, I, or Y. I know ſome people will think theſe Obſervations trivial, and therefore I am glad to corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate them by ſome great Authorities, which I have met with in <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian.</hi> In the fourth Book of Rhetoric to <hi>Herennius,</hi> are theſe words: <hi>Fugiemus cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bras Vocalium concurſiones, quae vaſtam at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que hiantem reddunt orationem; ut hoc eſt, Baccae aeneae amaeniſſimae impendebant.</hi> And Quintilian <hi>l.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Vocalium concurſus cum accidit, hiat &amp; interſiſtit, at quaſi la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borat oratio. Peſſimi longè quae eaſdem inter</hi>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0096900401:77"/>
                     <hi>ſe literas committunt, ſonabunt: Praecipuus tamen erit hiatus earum quae cavo aut patulo ore efferuntur. E plenior litera eſt, I angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtior.</hi> But he goes on to reprove the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs on the other hand of being too ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous in this matter, and ſays admirably, <hi>Neſcio an negligentia in hoc, aut ſolicitudo ſit pejor.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Tully (Orator ad Brut.) Theopompum reprehendunt, quod eas literas tanto opere fugerit, etſi idem magiſter ejus Iſocrates:</hi> which laſt Author, as <hi>Turnebus</hi> on <hi>Quintilian</hi> obſerve, has hardly one <hi>Hia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in all his Works. <hi>Quintilian</hi> tells us that <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> did not much obſerve this Nicety, tho' <hi>Tully</hi> himſelf ſays in his Orator, <hi>Crebra iſta Vocum concurſio, quam magna ex parte vitioſam, fugit Demoſthenes.</hi> If I am not miſtaken, <hi>Malherbe</hi> of all the Moderns has been the moſt ſcrupulous in this point; and I think <hi>Menage</hi> in his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon him ſays, he has not one in his Poems. To conclude, I believe the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> ſhould be avoided with more care in Poetry than in Oratory; and I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly try to prevent it, unleſs where the cutting it off is more prejudicial to the Sound than the <hi>Hiatus</hi> itſelf. I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>I Believe it was with me when I left the Town, as it is with a great many Men when they leave the World, whoſe loſs it ſelf they do not ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, as that of their Friends whom they leave behind in it. For I do not know one thing for which I can envy <hi>London,</hi> but for your continuing there. Yet I gueſs you
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0096900401:81"/>
will expect I ſhould recant this Expreſſion, when I tell you, that <hi>Sapho</hi> (by which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Name you have chriſten'd a very orthodox Lady) did not accompany me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country. However, I will confeſs my ſelf the leſs concern'd on that account, becauſe I have no very violent Inclination to loſe my Heart, eſpecially in ſo wild and ſavagè a place as this Foreſt is: In the Town, 'tis ten to one but a young Fellow may find his ſtray'd Heart again, with ſome <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet</hi> or <hi>Drury-lane</hi> Damſel; but here, where I could have met with no redreſs from an unmerciful, virtuous Dame, I muſt for ever havé loſt my little Traveller in a Hole, where I cou'd never rummage to find him again.—Well, Sir, you have your Lady in the Town ſtill, and I have my Heart in the Country ſtill, which being wholly unemploy'd as yet, has the more room in it for my Friends, and does not want a Corner at your Service.—To be ſerious, you have extreamly oblig'd me by your. Frankneſs and Kindneſs to me: And if I have abus'd it by too much Freedom on my part, I hope you will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to the natural Openneſs of my Temper, which hardly knows how to ſhow Reſpect, where I feel Affection. I wou'd love my Friend, as my Miſtreſs, without Ceremony; and hope a little rough Uſage

                  <p>YOU talk of Fame and Glory, and of the great Men of Antiquity: Pray tell me, what are all your great dead Men, but ſo many little living Letters? What a vaſt Reward is here for all the Ink waſted by Writers, and all the Blood ſpilt by Princes? There was in old time one <hi>Severus</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor. I dare ſay you never call'd him by any other Name in your Life: and yet in his days he was ſtyl'd <hi>Lucius, Septimius, Severus, Pius, Pertinax, Auguſtus, Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Adiabenicus, Arabicus, Maximus,</hi>—and what not?

                  <p>I Have been ſo well ſatisfy'd with the Country ever ſince I ſaw you, that I have not ſo much as once thought of the Town, or enquir'd of any one in it beſides Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> and your ſelf. And from him I underſtand of your Journey this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer into <hi>Leiceſterſhire;</hi> from whence I gueſs you are return'd by this time, to your old Apartment in the Widow's Corner, to your old Buſineſs of comparing Critics, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling

commentators; and to the old di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of a loſing game at picquet with the ladies, and half a play, or a quarter of a play, at the theatre; where you are none of the malicious Audience, but the chief of amorous Spectators; and for the infirmity of one <note n="*" place="bottom">His Hearing.</note> Senſe which there for the moſt part could only ſerve to diſguſt you, enjoy the vigour of another which raviſhes you.

                  <p>(According to the poetical, not the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Dodwell;</hi> who has done one thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of eternal memory; wrote two lines in his life that are not nonſenſe!) So you have the advantage of being entertain'd with all the beauty of the boxes, without being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with any of the dulneſs of the ſtage. You are ſo good a critic, that 'tis the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt happineſs of the modern Poets that you do not hear their works; and next, that you are not ſo arrant a critic, as to damn them (like the reſt) without hearing. But now I talk of thoſe critics, I have good news to tell you concerning my ſelf, for which I expect you ſhou'd congratulate with me: It is that beyond all my expectations, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0096900401:87"/>
far above my demerits, I have been moſt mercifully repriev'd by the fovereign power of <hi>Jacob Tonſon,</hi> from being brought forth to publick puniſhment; and reſpited from time to time from the hands of thoſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous executioners of the Muſes, whom I was juſt now ſpeaking of. It often happens, that guilty Poets, like other guilty criminals, when once they are known and proclaim'd, deliver themſelves into the hands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, only to prevent others from doing it more to their diſadvantage; and not out of any Ambition to ſpread their fame, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing executed in the face of the world, which is a ſame but of ſhort continuance. That Poet were a happy man who cou'd but obtain a grant to preſerve his for ninety-nine years; for thoſe names very rarely laſt ſo many days, which are planted either in <hi>Jacob Tonſon</hi>'s, or the <hi>Ordinary of Newgate</hi>'s Miſcellanies.</p>
                  <p>I have an hundred things to ſay to you, which ſhall be deferr'd till I have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ſeeing you in town, for the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon now draws on, that invites every body thither. Some of them I had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to you by Letters before this, if I had not been uncertain where you paſs'd your time the laſt ſeaſon: So much fine weather, I doubt not, has given you all the pleaſure you cou'd deſire from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0096900401:88"/>
and your own thoughts the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in it. But nothing cou'd allure Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> to our Foreſt, he continu'd (as you told me long ſince he wou'd) an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate lover of the town, in ſpite of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and fair weather. Therefore hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, to all thoſe conſiderable qualities I know you poſſeſt of, I ſhall add that of Prophecy. But I ſtill believe Mr. <hi>Wycher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s intentions were good, and am ſatisfy'd that he promiſes nothing but with a real deſign to perform it: how much ſoever his other excellent qualities are above my imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, his ſincerity, I hope, is not; and it is with the utmoſt that I am,</p>

                  <p>THE Morning after I parted from you, I found my felf (as I had prophecy'd) all alone, in an uneaſy Stage-Coach; a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful change from that agreeable company I enjoy'd the night before! without the leaſt hope of entertainment but from my laſt recourſe in ſuch caſes, a Book. I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enter into acquaintance with the <hi>Moraliſts,</hi> and had juſt receiv'd from them
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0096900401:100"/>
ſome cold conſolation for the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this life, and the incertainty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs; when I perceiv'd my Vehicle to ſtop, and heard from the ſide of it the dreadful news of a ſick Woman preparing to enter it. 'Tis not eaſy to gueſs at my mortification, but being ſo well fortify'd with Philoſophy I ſtood reſign'd with a Stoical conſtancy to endure the worſt of evils, a ſick Woman. I was indeed a little comforted to find, by her voice and dreſs, that ſhe was Young and a Gentlewoman; but no ſooner was her hood remov'd, but I ſaw one of the fineſt faces I ever beheld, and to increaſe my ſurprize, heard her ſalure me by my name. I never had more reaſon to accuſe Nature for making me ſhort-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than now, when I could not recollect I had ever ſeen thoſe fair eyes which knew me ſo well, and was utterly at a loſs how to addreſs my ſelf; till with a great deal of ſimplicity and innocence ſhe let me know (even before I diſcover'd my ignorance) that ſhe was the daughter of one in our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, lately marry'd, who having been conſulting her Phyſicians in Town, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into the Country, to try what good Air and a new Husband cou'd do to recover her. My Father, you muſt know, has ſometimes recommended the Study of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick to me, but I never had any ambition
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0096900401:101"/>
to be a Doctor till this inſtant. I ventur'd to preſcribe ſome Fruit (which I happen'd to have in the Coach) which being forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den her by her Doctors, ſhe had the more inclination to. In ſhort, I tempted, and ſhe eat; nor was I more like the Devil than ſhe like <hi>Eve.</hi> Having the good ſucceſs of the 'foreſaid Gentleman before my eyes, I put on the Gallantry of the old Serpent, and in ſpite of my evil Form accoſted her with all the Gaiety I was maſter of; which had ſo good effect, that in leſs than an hour ſhe grew pleaſant, her colour return'd, and ſhe was pleas'd to ſay my preſcription had wrought an immediate cure: In a word, I had the pleaſanteſt journey imaginable.</p>
                  <p>Thus far (methinks) my Letter has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the air of a Romance, tho' it be true. But I hope you will look on what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows as the greateſt of truths, That I think my ſelf extreamly oblig'd by you in all points, eſpecially for your kind and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Information and Advice in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the utmoſt concern to me, which I ſhall ever acknowledge as the higheſt proof at once of your friendſhip, juſtice, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. At the ſame time be aſſur'd, that Gentleman we ſpoke of, ſhall never by any alteration in me diſcover my knowledge of his Miſtake; the hearty forgiving of which is the only kind of Return I can poſſibly
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0096900401:102"/>
make him for ſo many favours. And I may derive this pleaſure at leaſt from it, that whereas I muſt otherwiſe have been a little uneaſy to know my incapacity of returning to his Obligations; I may now, by bearing his Frailty, exerciſe my Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Friendſhip more than Himſelf either is, or perhaps ever will be ſenſible of.<q>
                        <l>Ille meos, primus qui me ſibi junxit, Amores</l>

I cou'd be proud, in revenge, to find a few ſlips in your Verſes, which I read in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and ſince in the Country with more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and pleaſure: the thoughts are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſt, and you are ſure not to let them ſuffer by the Verſification. If you wou'd oblige me with the truſt of any thing of yours, I ſhou'd be glad to execute any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions you wou'd give me concerning them.

                  <p>IF I were to write to you as often as I think of you, my Letters wou'd be as bad as a Rent-charge; but tho' the one be but too little for your Good-nature, the other wou'd be too much for your Quiet, which is one bleſſing Good-nature ſhou'd indiſpenſably receive from mankind, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for thoſe many it gives. I have been inform'd of late, how much I am indebted to that quality of yours, in ſpeaking well of me in my abſence; the only thing by which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0096900401:105"/>
you prove your ſelf no Wit or Critic: Tho' indeed I have often thought, that a friend will ſhow juſt as much indulgence (and no more) to my faults when I am abſent, as he does ſeverity to 'em when I am preſent. To be very frank with you, Sir, I muſt own, that where I receiv'd ſo much Civility at firſt, I cou'd hardly have expected ſo much Sincerity afterwards. But now I have only to wiſh, that the laſt were but equal to the firſt, and that as you have omitted nothing to oblige me, ſo you wou'd omit nothing to improve me.</p>
                  <p>I caus'd an acquaintance of mine to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire twice of your welfare, by whom I have been inform'd, that you have left your ſpeculative Angle in the Widow's Coffee-houſe, and bidding adieu for ſome time to all the <hi>Rehearſals, Reviews, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettes,</hi> &amp;c. have march'd off into <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire.</hi> Thus I find you vary your life in the ſcene at leaſt, tho' not in the Action; for tho' Life for the moſt part, like an old Play, be ſtill the ſame, yet now and then a new Scene may make it more entertaining. As for my ſelf, I would not have my life a very regular Play, let it be a good merry Farce, a G-d's name, and a fig for the critical Unities! Yet (on the other ſide) I wou'd as ſoon write like <hi>Durfey,</hi> as live like <hi>T<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>_…</desc>

merry life, is (if you will excuſe ſuch a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude) not unlike a F<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>_…</desc>
                     </gap>t, at once naſty and laughable. For the generality of men, a true modern life is like a true modern play, neither Tragedy, Comedy, nor Farce, nor one, nor all of theſe: every Actor is much better known by his having the ſame Face, than by keeping the ſame Character: for we change our minds as often as they can their parts, and he who was yeſterday <hi>Caeſar,</hi> is to day Sir <hi>John Daw.</hi> So that one might ask the ſame queſtion of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern life, that <hi>Rich</hi> did of a modern play; <q rend="inline">"Pray do me the favour, Sir, to inform me; Is this your Tragedy or your Comedy?"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have dwelt the longer upon this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I perſwade my ſelf it might be uſeful, at a time when we have no other Theatre, to divert our ſelves at this great one. Here is a glorious ſtanding Comedy of Fools, at which every man is heartily merry, and thinks himſelf an unconcern'd Spectator. This (to our ſingular comfort) neither my Lord Chamberlain, nor the Queen her ſelf can ever ſhut up, or ſilence. While that of <hi>Drury</hi> (alas!) lies deſolate, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt peace: and the melancholy proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the Nymphs yet lingring about its beloved avenues, appears no leſs moving than that of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Dames lamenting over their ruin'd <hi>Ilium!</hi> What now can they

hope, diſpoſſeſs'd of their antient ſeats, but to ſerve as Captives to the inſulting Victors of the <hi>Hay-Market?</hi> The afflicted ſubjects of <hi>France</hi> do not, in our <hi>Poſt-man,</hi> ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly deplore the obſtinacy of their arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Monarch, as theſe periſhing people of <hi>Drury</hi> the obdurate heart of that <hi>Pharaoh, Rich,</hi> who like him, diſdains all Propoſals of peace and accommodation. Several Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels have been ſecretly affix'd to the great gates of his imperial palace in <hi>Bridges-ſtreet;</hi> and a Memorial repreſenting the diſtreſſes of theſe perſons, has been accidentally dropt (as we are credibly inform'd by a perſon of quality) out of his firſt Miniſter the chief Box-keeper's pocket, at a late Conference of the ſaid Perſon of quality and others, on the part of the Confederates, and his Theatrical Majeſty on his own part. Of this you may expect a copy as ſoon as it ſhall be tranſmitted to us from a good hand. As for the late Congreſs, it is here reported, that it has not been wholly ineffectual; but this wants confirmation; yet we cannot but hope the concurring prayers and tears of ſo many wretched Ladies may induce this haughty Prince to reaſon.</p>

                  <p>I MAY truly ſay I am more oblig'd to you this ſummer than to any of my Acquaintance, for had it not been for the two kind letters you ſent me, I had been perfectly, <hi>oblituſque meorum, obliviſcendus &amp; illis.</hi> The only companions I had were thoſe Muſes of whom <hi>Tully</hi> ſays, <hi>Adoleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiam alunt, Senectutem oblectant, ſecundas res ornant, adverſis perfugium ac ſolatium praebent, delectant domi, non impediunt foris, pernoctant nobiſcum, peregrinantur, ruſtican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Which indeed is as much as ever I expected from them; for the Muſes, if you take them as Companions, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſant and agreeable; but whoever ſhould be forc'd to live or depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'em, would find himſelf in a very bad condition. That Quiet, which <hi>Cowley</hi> calls the <hi>Companion of Obſcurity,</hi> was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, unleſs it was interrupted by thoſe fears you ſo juſtly gueſs I had for our Friend's welfare. 'Tis extreamly kind in you to tell me the news you heard of him, and you have deliver'd me from more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety than he imagines me capable of on his account, as I am convinc'd by his long
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0096900401:109"/>
ſilence. However the love of ſome things rewards itſelf, as of Vertue, and of Mr. <hi>Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherley.</hi> I am ſurpriz'd at the danger you tell me he has been in, and muſt agree with you, that our nation would have loſt in him alone, more wit, and probity, than would have remain'd (for ought I know) in all the reſt of it. My concern for his friendſhip will excuſe me, (ſince I know you honour him ſo much, and ſince you know I love him above all men) if I vent a part of my uneaſineſs to you, and tell you, that there has not been wanting one to inſinuate malicious untruths of me to Mr. <hi>Wycherley,</hi> which I fear may have had ſome effect upon him. If ſo, he will have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter puniſhment for his credulity than I cou'd wiſh him, in that fellow's acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The loſs of a faithful creature is ſomething, tho' of ever ſo contemptible an one; and if I were to change my Dog for ſuch a Man as the aforeſaid, I ſhou'd think my Dog undervalu'd: (who follows me about as conſtantly here in the country, as I was us'd to do Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> in the Town.)</p>
                  <p>Now I talk of my Dog, that I may not treat of a worſe ſubject which my ſpleen tempts me to, I will give you ſome account of him; a thing not wholly unprecedented, ſince <hi>Montaigne</hi> (to whom I am but a Dog
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0096900401:110"/>

He is not much a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel in his fawning, but has (what might be worth any man's while to imitate from him) a dumb ſurly ſort of kindneſs, that rather ſhows itſelf when he thinks me ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd by others, than when we walk quietly and peaceably by our ſelves. If it be the chief point of Friendſhip to comply with a friend's Motions and Inclinations, he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes this in an eminent degree; he lies down when I ſit, and walks when I walk, which is more than many good friends can pretend to, witneſs our Walk a year ago in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park.—Hiſtories are more full of examples of the Fidelity of Dogs than of Friends, but I will not inſiſt upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of 'em, becauſe it is poſſible ſome may be almoſt as fabulous as thoſe of <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>I Had written to you ſooner, but that I made ſome ſcruple of ſending profane things to you in Holy week. Beſides our Family wou'd have been ſcandaliz'd to ſee me write, who take it for granted I write nothing but ungodly Verſes. I aſſure you I am look'd upon in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood for a very well-diſpos'd perſon, no great Hunter indeed, but a great Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the noble ſport, and only unhappy in my want of conſtitution for that, and Drinking.

But I ſay nothing that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their good opinion of me: I have not quoted one <hi>Latin</hi> Author ſince I came down, but have learn'd without book a Song of Mr. <hi>Thomas Durfey</hi>'s, who is your only Poet of tolerable reputation in this country.

                  <p>I Had not ſo long omitted to expreſs my acknowledgments to you for ſo much good-nature and friendſhip as you lately ſhow'd me; but that I am but juſt return'd to my own Hermitage, from Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi>'s, who has done me ſo many favours, that I am almoſt inclin'd to think my Friends infect one another, and that your converſation with him has made him as obliging to me as your ſelf. I can aſſure you he has a ſincere reſpect for you, and this I believe he has partly contracted from me, who am too full of you not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow upon thoſe I converſe with. But I muſt now be contented to converſe only with the Dead of this world, that is to ſay, the dull and obſcure, every way obſcure, in their intellects as well as their perſons: Or elſe have recourſe to the living Dead, the old Authors with whom you are ſo well acquainted, even from <hi>Virgil</hi> down to <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> whom I do not think a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic by any means to be compar'd to Mr. <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis:</hi>

my own part will die at diſcretion, and at my leiſure.

Then indeed I muſt be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to all intents and purpoſes!

                  <p>I Give you thanks for the Verſion you ſent me of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Elegy. It is very much an image of that author's writing, who has an agreeableneſs that charms us without correctneſs, like a miſtreſs whoſe faults we ſee, but love her with them all. You have very judiciouſly alter'd his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in ſome places, and I can find nothing which I dare inſiſt upon as an error: What I have written in the margins being meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gueſſes at a little improvement, rather than Criticiſms. I aſſure you I do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect you ſhou'd ſubſcribe to my private notions but when you ſhall judge 'em agreeable to reaſon and good ſenſe. What I have done is not as a Critic, but as a Friend; I know too well how many qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are requiſite to make up the one, and that I want almoſt all I can reckon up; but I am ſure I do not want inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor I hope capacity, to be the other. Nor ſhall I take it at all amiſs, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other diſſents from my opinion: 'Tis no more than I have often done from my own; and indeed, the more a man advances in underſtanding, he becomes the more every
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0096900401:125"/>
day a critic upon himſelf, and finds ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other ſtill to blame in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer notions and opinions. I cou'd be glad to know if you have tranſlated the 11th Elegy of <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Ad amicam navigantem.</hi> the 8th of Book 3, or the 11th of Book 3, which are above all others my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular favourites, eſpecially the laſt of theſe.</p>
                  <p>As to the paſſage of which you ask my opinion in the ſecond <hi>Aeneid,</hi> it is either ſo plain as to require no ſolution; or elſe (which is very probable) you ſee farther into it than I can. <hi>Priam</hi> wou'd ſay, that <q rend="inline">"<hi>Achilles</hi> (whom ſurely you only feign to be your Father, ſince your actions are ſo different from his) did not uſe me thus inhumanly. He bluſh'd at his murder of <hi>Hector</hi> when he ſaw my ſorrows for him; and reſtored his dead body to me to be buried."</q> To this the anſwer of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> ſeems to be agreeable enough. <q rend="inline">"Go then to the ſhades, and tell <hi>Achilles</hi> how I degenerate from him:"</q> granting the truth of what <hi>Priam</hi> had ſaid of the difference between them. Indeed Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s mentioning here what <hi>Virgil</hi> more ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly paſſes in ſilence, the circumſtance of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s ſelling <hi>for mony</hi> the body of <hi>Hector,</hi> ſeems not ſo proper; it in ſome meaſure leſs'ning the character of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0096900401:126"/>
generoſity and piety, which is the very point of which <hi>Priam</hi> endeavours in this place to convince his Son, and to reproach him with the want of. But the truth of this circumſtance is no way to be queſtion'd, being expreſly taken from <hi>Homer,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents <hi>Achilles</hi> weeping for <hi>Priam,</hi> yet receiving the gold, <hi>Iliad</hi> 24: For when he gives the body, he uſes theſe words, <q rend="inline">"O my friend <hi>Patroclus!</hi> forgive me that I quit the corps of him who kill'd thee; I have great gifts in ranſom for it, which I will beſtow upon thy funeral."</q>

                  <p>YOUR Letters are a perfect charity to a man in retirement, utterly forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of all his Friends but you; for ſince Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> left <hi>London,</hi> I have not heard a word from him; tho' juſt before, and once ſince, I writ to him, and tho' I know my ſelf guilty of no offence but of doing ſincerely juſt what he <note n="*" place="bottom">Correcting his Verſes.

                     </note> bid me.—<hi>Hoc mihi libertas, hoc pia lingua dedit!</hi> But the greateſt injury he does me is the keeping me in ignorance of his welfare, which I am always very ſollicitous for, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy in the fear of any Indiſpoſition that may befal him. In what I ſent you ſome time ago, you have not verſe enough to be ſevere upon, in revenge for my laſt criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm: In one point I muſt perſiſt, that is to ſay, my diſlike of your <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> in which I take no pleaſure; I know very well that in <hi>Greek</hi> 'tis not only us'd by <hi>Xenophon,</hi> but
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0096900401:129"/>
is a common word for any Garden; but in <hi>Engliſh</hi> it bears the ſignification and conveys the idea of <hi>Eden,</hi> which alone is (I think) a reaſon againſt making <hi>Ovid</hi> uſe it; who will be thought to talk too like a Chriſtian in your verſion at leaſt, whatever it might have been in <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Greek.</hi> As for all the reſt of my Remarks, ſince you do not laugh at them as at this, I can be ſo civil as not to lay any ſtreſs upon 'em (as I think I told you before) and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in the point of <hi>Trees enjoying,</hi> you have, I muſt own, fully ſatisfy'd me that the Expreſſion is not only defenſible, but beautiful. I ſhall be very glad to ſee your Tranſlation of the Elegy, <hi>Ad Amicam na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigantem,</hi> as ſoon as you can; for (without a complement to you) every thing you write either in verſe or proſe, is welcome to me; and you may be confident, (if my opinion can be of any ſort of conſequence in any thing) that I will never be unſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, tho' I may be often miſtaken. To uſe Sincerity with you is but paying you in your own coin, from whom I have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd ſo much of it; and I need not tell you how much I really eſteem you, when I eſteem nothing in the world ſo much as that Quality. I know you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſay civil things to me in your Epiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Style, but thoſe I am to make allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0096900401:130"/>
for, as particularly when you talk of <hi>Admiring;</hi> 'tis a word you are ſo us'd to in converſation of Ladies, that it will creep into your diſcourſe in ſpite of you, ev'n to your Friends. But as Women when they think themſelves ſecure of admiration, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a thouſand Negligences, which ſhow them ſo much at diſadvantage and off their guard, as to loſe the little real Love they had before: ſo when men imagine others entertain ſome eſteem for their abilities, they often expoſe all their Imperfections and fooliſh works, to the diſparagement of the little Wit they were thought maſters of. I am going to exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify this to you, in putting into your hands (being encourag'd by ſo much indulgence) ſome verſes of my Youth, or rather Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; which (as I was a great admirer of <hi>Waller</hi>) were intended in imitation of his manner; and are perhaps, ſuch imitations, as thoſe you ſee in awkward country Dames of the fine and well-bred Ladies of the Court. If you will take 'em with you into <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> they may ſave you one hour from the converſation of the country Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and their Tenants, (who differ but in Dreſs and Name) which if it be there as bad as here, is even worſe than my Poetry.

But my almoſt continual Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes prevent that, as well as moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfactions of my life: However I may ſay one good thing of ſickneſs, that it is the beſt Cure in nature for Ambition, and deſigns upon the World or Fortune: It makes a man pretty indifferent for the future, provided he can but be eaſy, by intervals, for the preſent. He will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to compound for his Quiet only, and leave all the circumſtantial part and pomp of life to thoſe, who have a health vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enough to enjoy all the Miſtreſſes of their deſires.

the trouble of ſeeking, except a Friend; a happineſs I once hop'd to have poſſeſs'd in Mr. <hi>Wycherley;</hi> but—<hi>Quantum mutatus ab illo!</hi>—I have for ſome years been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd much like Children that build houſes with Cards, endeavouring very buſily and eagerly to raiſe a Friendſhip, which the firſt breath of any ill-natur'd By-ſtander cou'd puff away.—But I will trouble you no farther with writing, nor my ſelf with thinking, of this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>I was mightily pleas'd to perceive by your quotation from <hi>Voiture,</hi> that you had track'd me ſo far as <hi>France.</hi> You ſee 'tis with weak heads as with weak ſtomachs, they immediately throw out what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd laſt: and what they read, floats up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſurface of their mind, like Oil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on water, without incorporating. This, I think however, can't be ſaid of the Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes I laſt troubled you with, where all (I am afraid) is ſo puerile and ſo like the Author, that no body will ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect any thing to be borrow'd. Yet you, (as a friend, entertaining a better opinion of 'em) it ſeems ſearch'd in <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> but ſearch'd in vain.

pray tell me ſo freely, and it will ſave me a labour; if you think the contrary, you wou'd particularly oblige me by your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the ſeveral thoughts as they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur.

I value Sincerity the more, as I find by ſad experience, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of it is more dangerous; Writers rarely pardoning the executioners of their verſes, ev'n tho' themſelves pronounce ſentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.—As to Mr. <hi>Philips</hi>'s Paſtorals, I take the firſt to be infinitely the beſt, and the ſecond the worſt; the third is for the greateſt part a Tranſlation from <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Daphnis.</hi> I will not foreſtal your judgment of the reſt, only obſerve in that of the Nightingale theſe lines, (ſpeaking of the Muſician's playing on the harp.)<q>
                        <l>Now lightly skimming o'er the Strings they paſs,</l>
                        <l>Like Winds that gently bruſh the plying Graſs,</l>
                        <l>And melting Airs ariſe at their command;</l>
                        <l>And now, laborious, with a weighty hand,</l>
                        <l>He ſinks into the Cords, with ſolemn pace,</l>
                        <l>And gives the ſwelling Tones a manly grace.</l>

                  <p>To which nothing can be objected, but that they are too lofty for Paſtoral, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being put into the mouth of a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, as they are here; in the Poet's own perſon they had heen (I believe) more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Theſe are more after <hi>Virgil</hi>'s manner than that of <hi>Theocritus,</hi> whom yet in the character of Paſtoral he rather ſeems to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0096900401:136"/>
imitate. In the whole, I agree with the <hi>Tatler,</hi> that we have no better Eclogues in our language. There is a ſmall copy of the ſame Author publiſh'd in the <hi>Tatler</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 12. on the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Winter: 'Tis Poetical Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I recommend it to your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Garth</hi>'s Poem I have not ſeen, but believe I ſhall be of that Critic's opinion you mention at <hi>Will</hi>'s, who ſwore it was good: For tho' I am very cautious of ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Critics, yet I think one may do it more ſafely when they commend, than when they blame.</p>
                  <p>I agree with you in your cenſure of the uſe of <hi>Sea-terms</hi> in Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Virgil;</hi> not only becauſe <hi>Helenus</hi> was no great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in thoſe matters, but becauſe no Terms of Art or Cant-Words ſuit with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and dignity of Stile which <hi>Epic</hi> Poetry requires.—<hi>Cui mens divinior atque os magna ſoniturum.</hi>—The Tarpawlin Phraſe can pleaſe none but ſuch <hi>Qui Aurem habent Batavam;</hi> they muſt not expect <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus Atticis probari,</hi> I find by you. (I think I have brought in two phraſes of <hi>Martial</hi> here very dextrouſly.)</p>
                  <p>Tho' you ſay you did not rightly take my Meaning in the verſe I quoted from <hi>Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> yet I will not explain it; becauſe tho' it ſeems you are reſolv'd to take me for a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0096900401:137"/>
Critic, I wou'd by no means be thought a Commentator.—And for another reaſon too, becauſe I have quite forgot both the Verſe and the Application.</p>
                  <p>I hope it will be no offence to give my moſt hearty ſervice to Mr. <hi>Wycherly,</hi> tho' I perceive by his laſt to me, I am not to trouble him with my letters, ſince he there told me he was going inſtantly out of Town, and till his return was my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, &amp;c. I gueſs by yours he is yet with you, and beg you to do what you may with all truth and honour, that is, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him I have ever borne all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Kindneſs imaginable to him. I do not know to this hour what it is that has eſtrang'd him from me; but this I know, that he may for the future be more ſafely my friend, ſince no invitation of his ſhall ever more make me ſo free with him. I cou'd not have thought any man had been ſo very cautious and ſuſpicious, as not to credit his own Experience of a friend. Indeed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no body, may be a Maxim of Safety, but not ſo much of Honeſty. There is but one way I know of converſing ſafely with all men, that is, not by concealing what we ſay or do, but by ſaying or doing nothing that deſerves to be conceal'd, and I can truly boaſt this comfort in my affairs
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0096900401:138"/>
with Mr. <hi>Wycherly.</hi> But I pardon his Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, which is become his Nature, and ſhall never be his enemy whatſoever he ſays of me.</p>

Theſe coeleſtial thoughts put me in mind of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> you mention, who are a ſort of <hi>Sortilegi</hi> in one ſenſe, becauſe in their Lottery there are more Blanks than Prizes; the Adventurers being at beſt in an uncertainty, whereas the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters-up are ſure of ſomething. Prieſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in their Character, as they repreſent God, are ſacred; and ſo are Conſtables as they repreſent the King; but you will own a great many of 'em are very odd fellows, and the devil a bit of likeneſs in 'em. Yet I can aſſure you, I honour the good as much as I deteſt the bad, and I think, that in condemning theſe, we praiſe thoſe. I am ſo far from eſteeming ev'n the worſt unworthy of my protection, that I have defended their Character (in <hi>Congreve</hi>'s and <hi>Vanbrugh</hi>'s Plays) ev'n againſt their own Brethren. And ſo much for Prieſts in general, now for <hi>Trapp</hi> in particular whoſe Tranſlations from <hi>Ovid</hi> I have not ſo good an opinion of as you; not (I will aſſure you) from any ſort of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to him as a Prieſt, but becauſe I
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0096900401:146"/>
think he has little of the main Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtick of his Author, a graceful Eaſineſs. For let the ſenſe be ever ſo exactly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, unleſs an author looks like himſelf, in his air, habit, manner, 'tis a Diſguiſe and not a Tranſlation. But as to the Pſalm, I think <hi>David</hi> is much more beholding to him than <hi>Ovid;</hi> and as he treated the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> like a <hi>Jew,</hi> ſo he has made the <hi>Jew</hi> ſpeak like a <hi>Roman.</hi>

                  <p>IT ſeems that my late mention of <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw,</hi> and my quotation from him, has mov'd your curioſity. I therefore ſend you the whole Author, who has held a place among my other books of this nature for ſome years; in which time having read him twice or thrice, I find him one of thoſe whoſe works may juſt deſerve reading. I take this Poet to have writ like a Gentleman, that is, at leiſure hours, and more to keep out of idleneſs, than to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a reputation: ſo that nothing regular or juſt can be expected from him. All that regards Deſign, Form, Fable, (which is the Soul of Poetry) all that concerns ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, or conſent of parts, (which is the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0096900401:149"/>
Body) will probably be wanting; only pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conceptions, fine metaphors, glitt'ring expreſſions, and ſomething of a neat caſt of Verſe, (which are properly the dreſs, gems, or looſe ornaments of Poetry) may be found in theſe verſes. This is indeed the caſe of moſt other Poetical Writers of <hi>Miſcellanies;</hi> nor can it well be otherwiſe, ſince no man can be a true Poet, who writes for diverſion only. Theſe Authors ſhou'd be conſider'd as <hi>Verſifiers</hi> and <hi>witty Men,</hi> rather than as <hi>Poets;</hi> and under this head will only fall the Thoughts, the Expreſſion, and the Numbers. Theſe are only the pleaſing parts of Poetry, which may be judg'd of at a view, and comprehended all at once. And (to expreſs my ſelf like a Painter) their <hi>Colouring</hi> entertains the ſight, but the <hi>Lines</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of the Picture are not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected too narrowly.</p>
                  <p>This Author form'd himſelf upon <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch,</hi> or rather upon <hi>Marino.</hi> His thoughts one may obſerve, in the main, are pretty; but oftentimes far fetch'd, and too often ſtrain'd and ſtiffned to make them appear the greater. For men are never ſo apt to think a thing great, as when it is odd or wonderful; and inconſiderate Authors wou'd rather be admir'd than underſtood. This ambition of ſurpriſing a reader, is the true natural cauſe of all Fuſtian, or Bombaſt in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0096900401:150"/>
Poetry. To confirm what I have ſaid you need but look into his firſt Poem of the <hi>Weeper,</hi> where the 2d, 4th, 6th, 14th, 21ſt ſtanza's are as ſublimely dull, as the 7th, 8th, 9th, 16th, 17th, 20th and 23d ſtanza's of the ſame copy, are ſoft and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: And if theſe laſt want any thing, it is an eaſier and more unaffected expreſſion. The remaining thoughts in that Poem might have been ſpared, being either but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, or very trivial and mean. And by this example in the firſt one may gueſs at all the reſt; to be like this, a mixture of tender gentile thoughts and ſuitable expreſſions, of forc'd and inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable conceits, and of needleſs fillers-up to the reſt. From all which it is plain, this Author writ faſt, and ſet down what came uppermoſt. A reader may skim off the froth, and uſe the clear underneath; but if he goes too deep will meet with a mouthful of dregs: either the Top or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of him are good for little, but what he did in his <hi>own, natural, middle-way,</hi> is beſt.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak of his <hi>Numbers</hi> is a little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, they are ſo various and irregular, and moſtly Pindarick: 'tis evident his heroic Verſe (the beſt example of which is his <hi>Muſick</hi>'s <hi>Duel</hi>) is careleſly made up; but one may imagine from what it now is,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0096900401:151"/>
that had he taken more care, it had been muſical and pleaſing enough, not extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly majeſtic, but ſweet: And the time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd of his writing, he was (ev'n as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correct as he is) none of the worſt Verſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators.</p>
                  <p>I will juſt obſerve, that the beſt Pieces of this Author are, a Paraphraſe on Pſal. 23. On <hi>Leſſius,</hi> Epitaph on Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> Wiſhes to his ſuppos'd Miſtreſs, and the <hi>Dies Irae.</hi>

They are at preſent upon <hi>Laughter,</hi> which (for ought I know) may be the cauſe you might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times think me too remiſs a friend, when I was moſt intirely ſo: for I am never ſo inclin'd to mirth as when I am moſt pleas'd and moſt eaſy, which is in the company of a friend like your ſelf.</p>

As the fooling and toying with a miſtreſs is a proof of fondneſs, not diſreſpect, ſo is raillery with a friend. I know there are Prudes in friendſhip, who expect diſtance, awe and adoration, but I know you are not of them; and I for my part am no Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhipper, tho' a Papiſt. If I were to addreſs <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf in a heathen way, I fancy I ſhou'd be apt to take hold of his knee in a familiar manner, if not of his beard like <hi>Dionyſius;</hi> I was juſt going to ſay of his buttons, but I think <hi>Jupiter</hi> wore none (however I won't be poſitive to ſo nice a Critick as you, but his robe might be <hi>Subnected</hi> with a <hi>Fibula.</hi>) I know ſome Philoſophers define Laughter, <hi>A recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves to our own favour, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with the weakneſs of another:</hi> but I am ſure I very rarely laugh with that view, nor do I believe <hi>Children</hi> have any ſuch conſideration in their heads, when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their pleaſure this way: I laugh full as innocently as they, for the moſt part, and as ſillily. There is a difference too betwixt laughing <hi>about</hi> a thing and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>at</hi> a thing: One may find the inferior Man (to make a kind of caſuiſtical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction) provok'd to folly at the ſight or obſervation of ſome <hi>circumſtance of a thing,</hi> when the <hi>thing itſelf</hi> appears ſolemn and auguſt to the ſuperior Man, that is, out

Judgment and Reaſon. Let an Ambaſſador ſpeak the beſt Senſe in the world, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelf in the moſt graceful manner before a Prince, yet if the <hi>Tail</hi> of <hi>his Shirt</hi> happen (as I have known it happen to a very wiſe man) to hang out behind, more people ſhall laugh at that than attend to the other; till they recollect themſelves, and then they will not have a jot the leſs reſpect for the Miniſter. I muſt confeſs the iniquity of my countenance before you; ſeveral Muſcles of my Face ſometimes take an impertinent liberty with my Judgment, but then my Judgment ſoon riſes, and ſets all right again about my mouth: And I find I value no man ſo much, as he in whoſe ſight I have been playing the fool. I cannot be <hi>Sub-Perſona</hi> before a man I love; and not to laugh with honeſty, when Nature prompts, or Folly (which is more a ſecond Nature than any thing I know) is but a knaviſh hypocritical way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a mask of one's own face.—To conclude, thoſe that are my friends I <hi>laugh with,</hi> and thoſe that are not I <hi>laugh at;</hi> ſo am merry in company, and if ever I am wiſe, it is all by my ſelf. You take juſt another courſe, and to thoſe that are not your friends, are very civil, and to thoſe that are, very endearing and complaiſant: Thus when you and I meet, there will be

                  <p>MR. <hi>Wycherley</hi> has, I believe, ſent you two or three letters of invitation; but you, like the Fair, will be long ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited before you yield, to make the favour the more acceptable to the Lover. He is much yours by his talk; for that unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Genius which has rang'd at large like a libertine, now ſeems confin'd to you:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0096900401:159"/>
and I ſhou'd take him for your Miſtreſs too by your ſimile of the Sun and Earth: 'Tis very fine, but inverted by the application; for the gaiety of your fancy, and the droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his by the withdrawing of your luſtre, perſwades me it wou'd be juſter by the reverſe. Oh happy Favourite of the Muſes! how <hi>per-noctare,</hi> all night long with them? but alas! you do but toy, but skirmiſh with them, and decline a cloſe Engagement. Leave Elegy and Tranſlation to the inferior Claſs, on wbom the Muſes only glance now and then like our Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Sun, and then leave 'em in the dark. Think on the Dignity of Tragedy, which is of the greater Poetry, as <hi>Dennis</hi> ſays, and foil him at his other weapon, as you have done in Criticiſm.

                  <p>I Send you the book of Rudiments of <hi>Drawing,</hi> which you were pleas'd to command, and think my ſelf oblig'd to inform you at the ſame time of one of the many excellencies you poſſeſs without knowing of 'em. You are but too good a Painter already; and no Picture of <hi>Raphael</hi>'s was ever ſo beautiful, as that which you have form'd in a certain heart of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. Indeed it was but juſt that the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0096900401:164"/>
fineſt lines in nature ſhou'd be drawn upon the moſt durable ground, and none cou'd ever be met with that wou'd ſo readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or ſo faithfully retain them, as this Heart. I may boldly ſay of it that you will not find its fellow in all the <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> in this book. But I muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to you of my hand, which is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant traitor to my heart; for having been copying your picture from thence and from <hi>Kneller</hi> theſe three days, it has done all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible injury to the fineſt Face that ever was made, and to the livelieſt Image that ever was drawn. I have imagination enough in your abſence, to trace ſome reſemblance of you; but I have been ſo long us'd to loſe my judgment at the ſight of you, that 'tis paſt my power to correct it by the life, Your Picture ſeems leaſt like when plac'd before your eyes, and contrary to all other pictures receives a manifeſt diſadvantage by being ſet in the faireſt Light in the world. The Painters are a very vain gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and have a long time pretended to rival Nature; but to own the truth to you, ſhe made ſuch a finiſh'd piece about three and twenty years ago, (I beg your pardon Madam, I proteſt I meant but two and twenty) that 'tis in vain for them any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to contend with her.

                  <p>IT is too much a rule in this town, that when a Lady has once done a man a favour, he is to be rude to her ever after. It becomes our Sex to take upon us twice as much as yours allows us: By this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I may write to you moſt impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe you once anſwer'd me modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and if you ſhou'd never do me that honour for the future, I am to think (like a true Coxcomb) that your ſilence gives conſent.

fine Lady, have bright eyes, &amp;c. Firſt Madam, I make choice of you rather than of your Mother, becauſe you are younger than your Mother. Secondly, becauſe I fancy you ſpell better, as having been at ſchool later. Thirdly, becauſe you have nothing to do but to write if you pleaſe, and poſſibly it may keep you from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying your ſelf worſe: it may ſave ſome honeſt neighbouring Gentleman from three or four of your peſtilent glances. Caſt your eyes upon Paper, Madam, there you may look innocently: Men are ſeducing, books are dangerous, the amorous one's ſoften you, and the godly one's give you the ſpleen: If you look upon trees, they claſp in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces; birds and beaſts make love; the Sun is too warm for your blood, the Moon melts you into yeilding and melancholy. Therefore I ſay once more, caſt your eyes upon Paper, and read only ſuch Letters as I write, which convey no darts, no flames, but proceed from Innocence of ſoul, and ſimplicity of heart. However, I can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you a Bonnet lined with green for your eyes, but take care you don't tarniſh it with ogling too fiercely: I am told, that hand you ſhade your ſelf with this ſhining weather, is tann'd pretty much, only with being carried over thoſe Eyes—thank God I am an hundred miles off from them—

Upon the whole I wou'd ſooner truſt your hand than your Eyes for doing me miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; and tho' I doubt not ſome part of the rancour and iniquity of your heart will drop into your pen, yet ſince it will not attack me on a ſudden and unprepar'd, ſince I may have time while I break open your letter to croſs my ſelf and ſay a <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſter,</hi> I hope Providence will protect me from all you can attempt at this diſtance.

                  <p>THE Wits would ſay, that this muſt needs be a dull Letter, becauſe it is a marry'd one. I am afraid indeed you will find what Spirit there is muſt be on the ſide of the Wife, and the Husband's part as uſual will prove the dulleſt. What an unequal Pair are put together in this ſheet? in which tho' we ſin, it is you muſt do penance.

But I can't proceed without ſo far mortifying Sir <hi>Robert</hi> as to tell him, that ſhe writes this purely in obedience to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0096900401:169"/>
me, and that it is but one of thoſe honours a Husband receives for the ſake of his Wife.</p>
                  <p>It is making court ill to one fine Woman to ſhew her the regard we have for another; and yet I muſt own there is not a period of this Epiſtle but ſquints toward another over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt it. It will be in vain to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Your penetrating eyes cannot but diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver how all the letters that compoſe theſe words lean forward after Lady <hi>M</hi>'s letters, which ſeem to bend as much from mine, and fly from them as faſt as they are able. Ungrateful letters that they are! which give themſelves to another man in the very preſence of him who will yield to no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in knowing how to value them.</p>
                  <p>You will think I forget my ſelf, and am not writing to you; but let me tell you, 'tis you forget your ſelf in that thought, for you are almoſt the only Woman to whom one can ſafely addreſs the praiſes of another.

                     </hi> is of the ſame opinion.</p>
                  <p>Among theſe various conjectures, that I might be informed of the truth, I took along with me a Phyſician and a Divine, the one to inſpect the ſtate of its Body, the other to examine that of its Mind: The perſons I made choice of were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Dr. <hi>P<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap> We were no ſooner in the room but the Party came to us dreſt in that habit in which the Ladies affect an Hermophrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical imitation of Men—your ſharp wit, my dear Siſter, will immediately conclude that I mean a Riding-habit.</p>
                  <p>I think it not material to inform you, whether the Doctor, the Divine, or my ſelf look'd firſt. The Prieſt you will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly fancy was in his nature moſt an Infidel, and doubted moſt of this Miracle: we therefore propos'd to him to take the ſureſt method of believing, ſeeing and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: He comply'd with both admonitions, and having taken a large pinch of ſnuff upon it, advis'd us with a nod, that we ſhould by no means regard it as a Female but as a Male, for by ſo doing we ſhould be guilty of leſs ſinfulneſs.</p>

                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0096900401:173"/>
The Doctor upon inſpection differ'd from this opinion, he wou'd by no means allow it a miracle, or at moſt a natural one: He ſaid upon the whole it was a woman; that whatever might give a handle to think otherwiſe, was a trifle, nothing being more common than for a child to be mark'd with that thing which the mother long'd for.</p>
                  <p>As for this Party's temper of mind, it appears to be a moſt even diſpoſition, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the good qualities of both ſexes: for ſhe is neither ſo inacceſſible as other Ladies, nor is he ſo impudent as other Gentlemen. Of how obliging and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant a turn appears by this, that he tells the Ladies he has the Inclinations of a Gentleman, and that ſhe tells the Gentlemen ſhe has the <hi>Tendre</hi> of a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. As a further proof of this affable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, he formerly receiv'd viſits of the fair ſex in their maſques, till an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent fellow in a female diſguiſe mingled with a party of ladies, and impudently overheard their improving Speculations.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this, ſhe civilly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at my requeſt, that my two ſiſters ſhould be admitted privately whenever you wou'd do her the honour of your conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

How agreeable ſoever this ſight has been to me, I aſſure you it cannot be ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as the ſight of you in town, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may ſee in the country, I dare affirm no man or woman can ſhew you the like.</p>
                  <p>I therefore earneſtly deſire you to make haſte to this place; for tho' indeed like moſt other brothers, I ſhould be ſorry you were married at my expence, yet I would by no means, like them, detain you in the country from your admirers, for you may believe me, no brother in the world ever lov'd a ſiſter as I do you.</p>

                  <p>YOU are to underſtand, Madam, that my paſſion for your fair ſelf and your ſiſter, has been divided with the moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful regularity in the world. Even from my infancy I have been in love with one after the other of you, week by week, and my journey to <hi>Bath</hi> fell out in the three hundred ſeventy ſixth week of the Reign of my Sovereign Lady <hi>Sylvia.</hi> At the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0096900401:175"/>
preſent writing hereof it is the three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eighty ninth week of the Reign of your moſt Serene Majeſty, in whoſe ſervice I was liſted ſome weeks before I beheld your Siſter. This information will account for my writing to either of you hereafter, as either ſhall happen to be Queen-Regent at that time.</p>
                  <p>Pray tell your ſiſter, all the good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and virtuous inclinations ſhe has, never gave me ſo much pleaſure in her converſation, as that one vice of her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy will give me mortification this month. <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> commands her to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and ſhe refuſes! indeed if I were in <hi>Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> I ſhould honour her for this obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and magnify her no leſs for diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence than we do the <hi>Barcelonians.</hi> But people change with the change of places (as we ſee of late) and virtues become vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces when they ceaſe to be for one's intereſt, with me, as with others.</p>
                  <p>Yet let me tell her, ſhe will never look ſo finely while ſhe is upon earth, as ſhe would here in the water. It is not here as in moſt other inſtances, for thoſe Ladies that would pleaſe extremely, muſt go <hi>out</hi> of their own element. She does not make half ſo good a figure on horſeback as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden;</hi> but were ſhe once ſeen in the Bath, no man wou'd part with
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0096900401:176"/>
her for the beſt Mermaid in chriſtendom. You know I have ſeen you often, I perfectly know how you look in black and in white; I have experienc'd the utmoſt you can do in colours; but all your movements, all your graceful ſteps, deſerve not half the glory you might here attain, of a moving and eaſy behaviour in <hi>Buckram:</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing between ſwimming and walking, free enough, and more modeſtly-half-naked, than you can appear any where elſe. You have conquer'd enough already by land; ſhow your ambition, and vanquiſh alſo by water. We have no pretty Admirals on theſe Seas, but muſt ſtrike ſails to your white Flags, were they once hoiſted up. The Buckram I mention is a dreſs particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly uſeful at this time, when we are told the Princeſs is bringing over the faſhion of <hi>German</hi> Ruffs: You ought to uſe your ſelves to ſome degrees of ſtiffneſs beforehand. And when our Ladies chins have been tickled a-while with ſtarch'd muſlin and wire, they may poſſibly bear the bruſh of a <hi>German</hi> beard and whisker.</p>

                  <p>IF you ask how the waters agree with me, I muſt tell you, ſo very well, that I queſtion how you and I ſhould agree if we were in a room by our ſelves? Mrs. <hi>T.</hi> has honeſtly aſſured me, that but for ſome whims which ſhe can't entirely conquer, ſhe would go and ſee the world with me in man's cloaths. Even you, <hi>Madam,</hi> I fancy (if you wou'd not partake in our adventures) would wait our coming in at the evening with ſome impatience, and be well enough pleas'd to hear 'em by the fire-ſide. That would be better than reading Romances, unleſs Lady <hi>M.</hi> would be our Hiſtorian; for as ſhe is married, ſhe has probably lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hours in the night-time, to write or do what ſhe will in. What raiſes theſe deſires in me, is an acquaintance I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0096900401:178"/>
with my Lady <hi>Sandwich,</hi> who has all the ſpirit of the laſt age, and all the gay experience of a pleaſurable life. It were as ſcandalous an omiſſion to come to the <hi>Bath</hi> and not to ſee my Lady <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> as it had formerly been to have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd to <hi>Rome</hi> without viſiting the Queen of <hi>Sweden.</hi> She is, in a word, the beſt thing this Country has to boaſt of; and as ſhe has been all that a woman of ſpirit could be, ſo ſhe ſtill continues that eaſy and independent creature that a ſenſible woman always will be.</p>
                  <p>I muſt tell you a truth, which is not however much to my credit. I never thought ſo much of your ſelf and your ſiſter, as ſince I have been fourſcore miles diſtance from you. In the Foreſt I look'd upon you as good neighbours, at <hi>London</hi> as pretty kind of women, but here as divinities, angels, goddeſſes, or what you will. In the ſame manner I never knew at what a rate I valu'd your life, till you were upon the point of dying. If Mrs. <hi>T.</hi> and you will but fall very ſick every ſeaſon, I ſhall certainly die for you. Seriouſly I value you both ſo much that I eſteem others much the leſs for your ſakes; you have robb'd me of the pleaſure of eſteeming a thouſand pretty qualities in them, by ſhowing me ſo many finer in

I have ſeen enough of you not to overlook any Frailty you cou'd have, and nothing leſs than a Vice can make me like you leſs. I expect you ſhou'd diſcover by my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards you both, that this is true, and that therefore you ſhould pardon a thouſand things in me for that one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.

There are but juſt two Apartments, for the Maſter and Miſtreſs, below; and but two apartments above, (very much inferior to them) in the whole Houſe. When you look upon the Outſide, you'd think it large enough for a Prince; when you ſee the Inſide, it is too little for a Subject; and has not conveniency to lodge a common family. It is a houſe of Entries and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages; among which there are three Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta's through the whole, very uſeleſsly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. There is what might have been a fine Gallery, but ſpoil'd by two Arches towards the End of it, which take away the ſight of ſeveral of the windows. There are two ordinary ſtair-caſes inſtead of one great one. The beſt things within the houſe, are the Hall, which is indeed noble and well-proportion'd; and the cellars and offices under-ground, which are the moſt commodious, and the beſt contrived, of the whole. At the top of the building are ſeveral Cupola's and little Turrets that have but an ill effect, and make the building look at once fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and heavy. What ſeems of the beſt taſte, is that Front towards the gardens, which is not yet loaded with theſe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0096900401:191"/>
me. The Moon roſe in the cleareſt sky I ever ſaw, by whoſe ſolemn light I paced on ſlowly, without company, or any interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the range of my thoughts. About a mile before I reach'd <hi>Oxford,</hi> all the bells toll'd in different notes; the clocks of every colledge anſwer'd one another; and ſounded forth (ſome in a deeper, ſome a ſofter tone) that it was eleven at night. All this was no ill preparation to the life I have led ſince, among thoſe old walls, venerable galleries, ſtone portico's, ſtudious walks, and ſolitary ſcenes of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. I wanted nothing but a black gown and a ſalary, to be as meer a bookworm as any there. I conform'd my ſelf to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege hours, was roll'd up in books, lay in one of the moſt ancient, dusky parts of the Univerſity, and was as dead to the world as any Hermit of the deſart. If any thing was alive or awake in me, it was a little Vanity; ſuch as even thoſe good men us'd to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, when the Monks <hi>of their own Order</hi> extoll'd their piety and abſtraction. For I found my ſelf receiv'd with a ſort of reſpect, which this idle part of mankind, the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pay to their own ſpecies; who are as conſiderable here, as the buſy, the gay, and the ambitious are in your world.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I was treated in ſuch a manner, that I could not but ſometimes ask my ſelf
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0096900401:192" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in my mind, what College I was founder of, or what Library I had built? Methinks I do very ill to return to the world again, to leave the only place where I make a figure, and from ſeeing my ſelf ſeated with dignity in the moſt conſpicuous ſhelves of a libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, put my ſelf into the abject poſture of lying at a Lady's feet in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Square.</p>
                  <p>I will not deny, but that like <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the midſt of my glory I am wounded, and find my ſelf a meer man.

                  <p>THE chief cauſe I have to repent my leaving the town, is the uncertainty I am in every day of your Siſter's ſtate of health. I really expected by every poſt to have heard of her recovery, but on the contrary each letter has been a new awakening to my apprehenſions, and I have ever ſince ſuffer'd alarms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alarms on her account. No one can be more ſenſibly touch'd at this than I; nor any danger of any I love cou'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect me with more uneaſineſs, (tho' as I never had a ſiſter I can't be quite ſo good a judge as you, how far humanity wou'd carry me) I have felt ſome weakneſſes of a tender kind, which I would not be free from, and I am glad to find my value for people ſo rightly plac'd, as to perceive them on this occaſion.</p>

Tho' you modeſtly ſay the world has left you, yet I verily believe it is coming to you again as faſt as it can: For to give the world its due, it is always very fond of Merit when 'tis paſt its power to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it.

But if you are reſolv'd in revenge to rob the world of ſo much example as you may afford it, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your deſign will be vain; for even in a Monaſtery your devotions cannot carry

at one time or other in ſpight of all our art to keep it down; methinks 'tis almoſt fooliſh to take any pains to conceal it at all, and almoſt knaviſh to do it from thoſe that are our friends.

that never girded their lions at all.—But a particular reaſon that may engage you to write your thoughts the more freely to me, is, that I am confident no one knows you better; for I find, when others expreſs their thoughts of you, they fall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort of mine, and I know at the ſame time theirs are ſuch as you would think ſufficiently in your favour.</p>
                  <p>You may eaſily imagine how deſirous I muſt be of a correſpondence with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who had taught me long ago that it was as poſſible to eſteem at firſt ſight, as to love: and who has ſince ruin'd me for all the converſation of one ſex, and almoſt all the friendſhip of the other. I am but too ſenſible thro' your means, that the company of men wants a certain ſoftneſs to recommend it, and that of women wants every thing elſe. How often have I been quietly going to take poſſeſſion of that tranquility and indolence I had ſo long found in the country; when one evening of your converſation has ſpoil'd me for a <hi>Solitaire!</hi> Books have loſt their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon me, and I was convinced ſince I ſaw you, that there is one alive wiſer than all the Sages: a plague of female wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom! it makes a man ten times more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy than his own. What is very ſtrange, Virtue her ſelf, (when you have the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0096900401:202"/>
her) is too amiable for one's repoſe. You might have done a world of good in your time, if you had allow'd half the fine gentlemen who have ſeen you to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with you; they would have been ſtrangely Bitt, while they thought only to fall in love with a fair Lady, and you had bewitch'd them with Reaſon and Virtue (two Beauties that the very fops pretend to no acquaintance with.)</p>
                  <p>The unhappy diſtance at which we cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond, removes a great many of thoſe reſtrictions and punctilious decorums, that oftentimes in nearer converſation prejudice truth, to ſave good breeding. I may now hear of my faults, and you of your good qualities, without a bluſh; we converſe upon ſuch unfortunate generous terms, as exclude the regards of fear, ſhame, or deſign, in either of us. And methinks it would be as paltry a part, to impoſe (even in a ſingle thought) upon each other in this ſtate of ſeparation, as for Spirits of a different ſphere who have ſo little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with us, to employ that little (as ſome would make us think they do) in putting tricks and deluſions upon poor mortals.</p>
                  <p>Let me begin then, Madam, by asking you a queſtion, that may enable me to judge better of my own conduct than moſt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0096900401:203"/>
inſtances of my Life. In what manner did I behave the laſt hour I ſaw you? What degree of concern did I diſcover when I felt a misfortune which I hope you will never feel, that of parting from what one moſt eſteems? for if my part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing look'd but like that of your common acquaintance, I am the greateſt of all the hypocrites that ever Decency made.</p>
                  <p>I never ſince paſs by your houſe but with the ſame ſort of melancholy that we feel upon ſeeing the Tomb of a friend, which only ſerves to put us in mind of what we have loſt. I reflect upon the circumſtances of your departure which I was there a witneſs of (your behaviour in what I may call your laſt moments) and I indulge a gloomy kind of pleaſure in thinking that thoſe laſt moments were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to me. I would fain imagine this was not accidental, but proceeded from a penetration which I know you have, in finding out the truth of people's ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that you were willing, the laſt man that <hi>would have</hi> parted from you, ſhould be that laſt that <hi>did.</hi> I really look'd upon you juſt as the friends of <hi>Curtius</hi> might have done upon that Hero, at the inſtant when he was devoting himſelf to Glory, and running to be loſt out of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity. I was oblig'd to admire your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0096900401:204"/>
in as great a degree as I deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it; and had only to wiſh, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven would reward ſo much Virtue as was to be taken from us, with all the felicities it could enjoy elſewhere!</p>

                  <p>YOU will find me more troubleſome than ever <hi>Brutus</hi> did his Evil Genius; I ſhall meet you in more places than one, and often refreſh your memory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you arrive at your <hi>Philippi.</hi> Theſe ſhadows of me (my letters) will be haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you from time to time, and putting you in mind of the man who has really ſuffer'd very much from you, and whom you have robb'd of the moſt valuable of his enjoyments, your converſation. The advantage of hearing your ſentiments by diſcovering mine, was what I always thought a great one, and even worth the riſque I generally run of manifeſting my own indiſcretion. You then rewarded my truſt in you the moment it was given,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0096900401:205"/>
for you pleas'd or inform'd me the minute you anſwer'd. I muſt now be contented with more ſlow returns. However 'tis ſome pleaſure, that your thoughts upon Paper will be a more laſting poſſeſſion to me, and that I ſhall no longer have cauſe to complain of a loſs I have ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted, that of any thing you ſaid, which I happen'd to forget. In earneſt, Madam, if I were to write to you as often as I think of you, it muſt be every day of my life. I attend you in ſpirit thro' all your ways, I follow you thro' every ſtage in books of Travels, and fear for you thro' whole folio's; you make me ſhrink at the paſt dangers of dead travellers; and if I read of a delightful proſpect, or agreeable place, I hope it yet ſubſiſts to pleaſe you. I enquire the roads, the amuſements, the company, of every town and country thro' which you paſs, with as much diligence, as if I were to ſet out next week to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take you. In a word, no one can have you more conſtantly in mind, not even your guardian Angel (if you have one) and I am willing to indulge ſo much Popery, as to fancy ſome Being takes care of you, who knows your value better than you do your ſelf: I am willing to think that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven never gave ſo much ſelf-neglect and reſolution to a woman, to occaſion her
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0096900401:206"/>
calamity, but am pious enough to believe thoſe qualities muſt be intended to conduce to her benefit and her glory.</p>
                  <p>Your firſt ſhort letter only ſerves to ſhow me you are alive: it puts me in mind of the firſt Dove that return'd to <hi>Noah,</hi> and juſt made him know it had found no reſt abroad.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing in it that pleaſes me, but when you tell me you had no Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickneſs. I beg your next may give me all the pleaſure it can, that is, tell me any that you receive. You can make no diſcoveries that will be half ſo valuable to me as thoſe of your own mind: Nothing that regards the States or Kingdoms you paſs thro', will engage ſo much of my curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity or concern, as what relates to your ſelf: Your welfare, to ſay truth, is more at my heart than that of Chriſtendom.</p>
                  <p>I am ſure I may defend the truth, tho' perhaps not the virtue, of this declaration. One is ignorant, or doubtful at beſt, of the Merits of differing religions and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments: but private virtues one can be ſure of. I therefore know what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon has deſert enough to merit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happier than others, but not what Nation deſerves to conquer or oppreſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
