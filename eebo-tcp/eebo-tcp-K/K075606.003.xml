            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>GOOD precepts and true gold are more valuable for their antiquity. And here I preſent my good reader with one, delivered by the firſt founder of mythology, Aeſop himſelf.

any of his that are handed down to us. Though Mr. Ogleby and Sir Roger L'Eſtrange had the unhappineſs to be unacquainted with them, yet I had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to diſcover them by the removal of my old library, which has made me amends for the trouble of getting to where I now teach. They were written, or dictated at leaſt, by Aeſop, in the fifty-fourth Olympiad: and though I deſigned them chiefly for the uſe of my ſchool (this being tranſlated by a youth deſigned for a Greek profeſſor), yet no man is ſo wiſe as not to need inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aye, and by the way of fable too; ſince the Holy Scriptures themſelves, the beſt inſtructors, teach us by way of parable, ſymbol, image, and figure; and David was more moved with Nathan's "Thou art the man," than all the moſt rigid lectures in the world would have done.

               <byline>BY DR. KING<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>To the works of this excellent Humouriſt, which were firſt collected in 1776, I prefixed ſome Memoirs of his Life; which have ſince been ſo elegantly epitomized, that it would be ſuperfluous to enlarge on this article. Some extracts from his laſt biographer ſhall therefore ſupply the place: <q rend="inline">"William King was born in London in 1663, the ſon of Ezekiel King, a gentleman. He was allied to the family of Clarendon. From Weſtminſter-ſchool, where he was a ſcholar on the foundation under the care of Dr. Buſby, he was at eighteen elected to Chriſt-church, in 1681. In 1688, he was made maſter of arts; and, engaging in the ſtudy of the Civil Law, became doctor in 1692, and was admitted advocate at Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Commons.—Though he was a regular advocate in the courts of civil and canon law, he did not love his profeſſion, nor indeed any kind of buſineſs which interrupted his volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary dreams, or forced him to rouſe from that indulgence in which only he could find delight. His reputation as a civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian was yet maintained by his judgements in the courts of Delegates, and raiſed very high by the addreſs and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which he diſcovered in 1700, when he defended the earl of Angleſea againſt his lady, afterwards dutcheſs of Buckinghamſhire, who ſued for a divorce, and obtained it. The expence of his pleaſures, and neglect of buſineſs, had now leſſened his revenues; and he was willing to accept of a ſettlement in Ireland, where, about 1702, he was made judge of the admiralty, commiſſioner of the prizes, keeper of the records in Birmingham's tower, and vicar-general to Dr. Marſh the primate. But it is vain to put wealth within the reach of him who will not ſtretch out his hand to take it. King ſoon found a friend, as idle and thoughtleſs as himſelf, in Upton, one of the judges, who had a pleaſant houſe called Mountown, near Dublin, to which King frequently retired; delighting to neglect his intereſt, forget his cares, and deſert his duty. Here he wrote "Mully of Mountown," a poem, by which, though fanciful readers in the pride of ſagacity have given it a political interpretation, was meant originally no more than it expreſſed, as it was dictated only by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's delight in the quiet of Mountown. In 1708, when lord Wharton was ſent to govern Ireland, King returned to London, with his poverty, his idleneſs, and his wit. In 1711, competence, if not plenty, was again put into his power. He was, without the trouble of attendance, or the mortification of a requeſt, made gazetteer. He was now again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>laced in a profitable employment, and again threw the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit away. An Act of Inſolvency made his buſineſs at that time particularly troubleſome; and he would not wait till hurry ſhould be at an end, but impatiently reſigned it, and returned to his wonted indigence and amuſements. One of his amuſements at Lambeth, where he reſided, was to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify Dr. Tenniſon, the archbiſhop, by a publick feſtivity, on the ſurrender of Dunkirk to Hill; an event with which Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon's political bigotry did not ſuffer him to be delighted. King was reſolved to counteract his ſullenneſs, and at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of a few barrels of ale filled the neighbourhood with honeſt merriment. In the autumn of 1712 his health de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined; he grew weaker by degrees, and died on Chriſtmas-day. Though his life had not been without irregularity, his principles were pure and orthodox, and his death was pious. After this relation, it will be naturally ſuppoſed that his poems were rather the amuſements of idleneſs than efforts of ſtudy; that he endeavoured rather to divert than aſtoniſh; that his thoughts ſeldom aſpired to ſublimity; and that, if his verſe was eaſy and his images familiar, he attained what he deſired. His purpoſe is to be merry; though perhaps, to enjoy his mirth, it may be ſometimes neceſſary to think well of his opinions."</q> I need not repeat that this is quoted from Dr. Johnſon.</p>

How oft has a ſtubborn folly been ſucceſsfully arraigned by a candid and eaſy rebuke, which had long maintained itſelf againſt a more powerful, though a leſs familiar, conviction! If we can ſmile away the follies of an adverſary, ſport with his vanities, and laugh him into a ſenſe of his errors; why ſhould we forfeit that exquiſite pleaſure of complacency and good-humour, which a malicious conflict with a rival would moſt certainly deprive us of? If we miſcarry in an attempt of this nature, our defeat would be the leſs diſhonourable, becauſe we ſeemed only to play and trifle with the miſtakes of an author; but ſhould we, under the maſk of a little raillery, wit, and good-humour, obtain our end, it would double our ſatisfaction, as well as the glory of our conqueſt. Two important debates of the utmoſt conſequence in religion (Eachard's Contempt of the Clergy, and Philautus and Timothy) have with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful applauſe lately appeared in the world; the beauties of their author's ſtile, the purity of their diction, the elegant turn of thought, and above all a torrent of ſevere but good-natured wit, drew a thouſand readers to peruſe an hypotheſis they little imagined ever to eſpouſe; but they were inſenſibly deluded into good principles, and betrayed into a conviction of thoſe very truths they came on purpoſe to deride and ridicule. Where they expected to gratify a fancy only, they found a more real advantage in the reformation of their judgement, and, from admirers of the author's wit and beauties, became at laſt proſelytes to their opinions. If in two or three inſtances I have tranſgreſſed my own rules, the Fool or the Knave muſt be imagined very notorious; and that thoſe tender and merciful laſhes that were judged ſufficient for little offenders would hardly have reached the vanities of the one, or the villainies of the other. And if I am thought to have injured any perſon in his character, or to have ſaid as much as I am able, I muſt beg leave to aſſure the world, that it was owing to abundance of humanity and good-nature I did not ſay a great deal more; and would rather adviſe them to ſit eaſy and quiet under the innocent rebukes of a ſatire, than provoke others to prepare that correction, which their ignorance, their impudence, or both, have ſo juſtly deſerved.

He was born Jan. 25, 1640; and at an early age travelled with Dr. Killigrew, afterwards maſter of the Savoy, who gave him a juſt and true reliſh of poetry, and all the refinements of wit and ſenſe. He joined the party which oppoſed the arbitrary proceedings of Charles the Second, and was very active in all the meaſures which were adopted againſt that monarch and his ſucceſſor James the Second. On the death of his father, on the 23d of November, 1684, he ſucceeded him in the title of Earl of Devonſhire, and ſoon after becam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <l>Where haſt thou made thy long retreat?</l>
            <l>What lands thy warmer beams poſſeſt,</l>
            <l>What happy Indian worlds thy fruitful preſence bleſt?</l>

            <l>In dark unlovely days and in long nights ſhe mourn'd.</l>
            <l>The poor dejected beaſts hung down their heads,</l>

            <l>No footſteps of green life remain,</l>

            <head>SONG ON A LADY INDISPOSED.</head>
            <byline>BY MR. BEVIL HIGGONS<note n="*" place="bottom">An account of this poet has been already printed in vol. I. p. 128; to which the following anecdote may be added. <q rend="inline">"King Charles II. ſold Dunkirk to Louis XIV. and gave him Engliſh oak enough to build the very fleet that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards attacked and defeated one of ours in Bantry Bay on the coaſt of Ireland. This puts me in mind of the foreſight of a gentleman, who had been ſome time envoy from the king to the princes and ſtates of Italy, and who, in his return home, made the coaſt of France his road; in order to be as uſeful to his country as poſſible, and to his ſovereign too, as he thought. In his audience of the king, he told his majeſty, that the French were hard at work, building men of war in ſeveral of their ports, and that ſuch a haſty increaſe of the naval power of France could not but threaten England's ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of the ſeas, and conſequently portend deſtruction to her trade. The gentleman was in the right, for our trade and the ſovereignty of the ſeas are dependent on each other; they muſt live or die together. But what a recompenſe do you think he met with for his fidelity? really ſuch a one as I would hardly have believed, had I been told it by any perſon but his own ſon, the late Mr. Bevil Higgons, whoſe works, both in proſe and verſe, have made him known to all the men of letters in Britain, and whoſe attachment to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Stuart, even to his dying day, puts his veracity in this point out of diſpute. The recompence was a ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primand from the king, as the fore-runner to the laying him aſide, for talking of things which his majeſty told him it was not his buſineſs to meddle with."</q> I forget from which of the political writers between 1730 and 1740 this anecdote was tranſcribed; moſt probably The Craftſman.

He is generally ſtyled Dr. Evans the Epigrammiſt, and was one of the Oxford wits enumerated in the following diſtich (wretchedly imitated in the "Additions to Pope," vol. I. p. 163.):
<q>

and was to have added a third volume on trees, but died in 1679. The firſt volume of that work was compiled by Dr. Robert Morriſon, a native of Aberdeen, who, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Scotland in the troubles, ſtudied at Paris, took a degree in phyſic at Angers, directed the royal gardens at Blois till the death of the duke of Orleans; at the Reſtoration he was appointed overſeer of the king's gardens, fellow of the College of Phyſicians, and in 1669 profeſſor of Botany in the Univerſity of Oxford, where he read lectures till he ſet about publiſhing the "Univerſal Knowledge of Simples."

The Earl alſo ſettled an annual revenue for the maintenance of the Garden, and for ſupplying it with plants and herbs, with which it is well ſtocked. Dr. Sherrard, who was Conſul at Smyrna, brought from thence a fine collection of exotics, built a library here, furniſhed it with botanical books, and augmented the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſorſhip. The noble founder of the garden was created by king James I. baron Danvers of Dantſey; and by king Charles I. earl of Danby, and made a knight of the Bath. Dying unmarried, Jan. 20, 1643, the title became extinct; but was revived, in 1674, in the family of the duke of Leeds. N.</note> planted, Bobart till'd.</l>

            <head>ON THE MONUMENT AT LONDON.</head>
            <byline>BY CAPTAIN RADCLIFFE<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>This writer has already appeared in vol. I. p. 145. I did not then know that he had publiſhed a collection of his poems, under the title of
"The Ramble, an Anti-heroick Poem, together with ſome Terreſtrial Hymns and Carnal Ejaculations, by Alexander Radcliffe, of Grays Inn, Eſq. 1682,"
8vo; inſcribed to James Lord Anneſley. He had publiſhed in 1680
"Ovid Traveſtie, a Burleſque upon Ovid's Epiſtles;"
with a ſatirical introduction occaſioned by the "Preface to a late-Book, called The Wits paraphraſed." Mr. Tonſon printed a third edition of this Traveſtie in 1696. The Dedication "To Robert Fairbeard, of Grays Inn, Eſq." is no bad ſpecimen of the author's humour. <q rend="inline">"Having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted theſe Epiſtles to the Preſs, I was horribly put to it for a Patron. I thought of ſome great Lord, or ſome angelic Lady; but then again conſidered I ſhould never be able to adorn my Dedication with benign beams, corruſcant rays, and the Devil and all of influence. At laſt I heard my good friend Mr. Fairbeard was come to town—nay then—all's well enough. To you therefore I offer this Engliſh Ovid, to whom you may not be unaptly compared in ſeveral parcels of your life and converſation, only with this exception, that you have nothing of his Triſtibus. 'Tis you who burleſque all the fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and conceited gravity of the age. I remember you once told a grave and affected Advocate, 'that he burleſqued God's image, for God had made him after his own likeneſs, but he made himſelf look like an aſs.' Upon the whole matter I am very well ſatisfied in my choice of you for a judge; if you ſpeak well of the book, 'tis all I deſire, and the bookſeller will have reaſon to rejoice: though by your approbation you may draw upon yourſelf a grand inconvenience; for perhaps you may too often have ſongs, ſonnets, madrigals, and an innumerable army of ſtanzas obtruded upon you by, Sir, Your humble ſervant, ALEX. RADCLIFFE."</q>
                  </p>

                  <p>Amongſt his other poems, is a facetious one
"On the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Mr. John Sprat, late Steward of Grays Inn;"
another,
"On the Death of Edward Story, Eſq. Maſter of the Pond, and Principal of Bernard's Inn;"
and,
"The Sword's Farewell upon the Approach of Michaelmas-term."

               <l>Lov'd well his glaſs, and as he drank he writ;</l>
               <l>Vaſt was his ſoul, and ſparkling was the wine,</l>
               <l>Which ſtrangely did inſpire each mighty line.</l>
               <l>The watery ſprings of Helicon are themes</l>

dated April 3, 1694, in a Farewell-poem to the Muſes on his intending to enter into holy orders, was inſcribed "to Mr. Henry Sacheverell," his <hi>then</hi> deareſt friend and colleague. Much has been ſaid by Sacheverell's enemies of his ingratitude to his relations, and of his turbulent beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour at Oxford; but theſe appear to have been groundleſs ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, circulated only by the ſpirit of party. In his younger years he wrote ſome excellent Latin poems: beſides ſeveral in the ſecond and third volumes of the "Muſae Anglicanae," aſcribed to his pupils, there is a good one of ſome length in the ſecond volume, under his own name (tranſcribed from the Oxford Collection, on Q. Mary's death, 1695). He took the degree of M.A. May 16, 1696; B.D, Feb. 4, 1707; D.D. July 1, 1708. His firſt preferment was Cannock, in the county of Stafford. He was appointed preacher of St. Saviour's, Southwark, in 1705; and while in this ſtation preached his famous ſermons (at Derby, Aug. 15, 1709; and at St. Paul's, Nov. 5, in the ſame year); and in one of them was ſuppoſed to point at lord Godolphin. under the name of <hi>Volpone.</hi> It has been ſuggeſted, that to this circumſtance, as much as to the doctrines contained in his ſermons, he was indebted for his proſecution, and eventually for his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Being impeached by the houſe of commons, his trial began Feb. 27, 1709-10; and continued until the 23d of March: when he was ſentenced to a ſuſpenſion from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for three years, and his two ſermons ordered to be burnt. This ridiculous proſecution overthrew the miniſtry, and laid the foundation of his fortune. To Sir Simon Harcourt, who was counſel for him, he preſented a ſilver baſon gilt, with an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant inſcription. He very ſoon after was collated to a living near Shrewſbury; and, in the ſame month that his ſuſpenſion ended, had the valuable rectory of St. Andrew Holborn given him by the Queen. At that time his reputation was ſo high, that he was enabled to ſell the firſt ſermon, preached after his ſentence expired, for the ſum of 100l.; and upwards of 40,000 copies, it is ſaid, were ſoon fold. We find by Swift's Journal to Stella, Jan. 22, 1711-12, that he had alſo intereſt enough with the miniſtry to provide very amply for one of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yet, as the Dean had ſaid before, Aug. 24, 1711, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"they hated, and affected to deſpiſe him."</q> In 1716, he prefixed a dedication to "Fifteen Diſcourſes, occaſionally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered before the Univerſity of Oxford, by W. Adams, M.A. late ſtudent of Chriſt Church, and rector of Staunton upon Wye, in Oxfordſhire." After this publication, we hear little of him, except by quarrels with his pariſhioners, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was much ſuſpected to be concerned in Atterbury's plot. A conſiderable eſtate at Callow in Derbyſhire was left to him by his kinſman Geo. Sacheverell, eſq. He died June 5, 1724; and, by his will, bequeathed to Biſhop Atterbury, then in exile, who was ſuppoſed to have penned his defence for him, the ſum of 500l. By a letter to him from his uncle, 1711, it appears, that he had a brother named Thomas, and a ſiſter Suſannah. — The dutcheſs of Marlborough deſcribes him as
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"an ignorant impudent incendiary; a man who was the ſcorn even of thoſe who made uſe of him as a tool."</q>
Account, &amp;c. p. 247. — And Bp. Burnet ſays,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"He was a bold inſolent man, with a very ſmall meaſure of religion, virtue, learning, or good ſenſe; but he reſolved to force himſelf into popularity and preferment, by the moſt petulant railings at Diſſenters and Low-church men, in ſeveral ſermons and libels, wrote without either chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſtyle, or livelineſs of expreſſion."</q>

In the "Supplement to Swift," I have had occaſion to obſerve, from Mr. Granger, that Rocheſter had natural modeſty. The fact is, he wrote but little of the ribaldry which paſſes under his name; but, having obtained the character of a lewd writer, every thing in that ſtrain was fathered upon him. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"In all his works,"</q> Dr. Johnſon ſays,

            <head>ON THE CASTLE OF DUBLIN.</head>
            <byline>BY DR. PARNELL<note n="*" place="bottom">Thomas Parnell, D.D. deſcended from an antient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Congleton in Cheſhire, was born in Dublin, in the year 1679; and was admitted a member of Dublin College at the early age of thirteen. He took his degree of M.A. July 9, 1700; and in the ſame year was ordained a deacon by Dr. William King, then biſhop of Derry, having a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation from the primate, as being under twenty-three years of age. He was admitted into prieſts orders about three years after, by Dr. King, then archbiſhop of Dublin; and was collated by Dr. St. George Aſhe, biſhop of Clogher, to the archdeaconry of Clogher, Feb. 9, 1705. About that time alſo he married Miſs Anne Minchin, a young lady of great merit and beauty, by whom he had two ſons, who died young, and a daughter, living in 1770. Swift, in his Journal to Stella, Auguſt 24, 1712, ſay,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I am heartily for poor Mrs. Parnell's death: ſhe ſeemed ro be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good-natured young woman, and I believe the poor lad is much afflicted: they appeared to live perfectly well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether."</q>
This event is ſuppoſed to have made an indelible impreſſion on his ſpirits. He was warmly recommended by the Dean to archbiſhop King: who gave him a prebend in 1713, and the vicarage of Finglas (worth about 400 l. a year) May 31, 1716. His gratitude is beautifully expreſſed in a poem on the Dean's birth-day, 1713. He died at Cheſter, in July 1718, on his way to Ireland; and was buried in Trinity church in that town, without any monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to mark the place of his interment. As he left no male iſſue, his eſtate devolved to his only nephew, Sir Sir John Parnell, baronet, whoſe father was younger brother to the archdeacon, and one of the juſtices of the king's bench in Ireland. The character of Dr. Parnell is admirably pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by Dr. Goldſmith, in the Life prefixed to a volume of his Poems, originally publiſhed by Mr. Pope, in 1721. A poſthumous volume was printed at Dublin in 1758. And both theſe volumes united, with ſeveral additional poems which I had formerly collected, are printed in the forty-fourth volume of the "Engliſh Poets." N.</note>. <date>1715.</date>

            <head>ESSAY ON THE DIFFERENT STYLES OF POETRY<note n="*" place="bottom">This and the preceding Poems by Dr. Parnell (as has been already ſaid of Dr. Yalden) were omitted in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer collection only becauſe they could not then be met with. I cannot but take this opportunity of correcting a miſtake (which I was led into by Dr. Birch) in the note on the Engliſh Poets, vol. XLIV. p. 263. What is there ſaid on the Poem on Queen Anne's Peace more probably belongs to this Eſſay. The peace was not ſigned till March 30, 1713. By Swift's Journal to Stella, Dec. 22, 25, 1712, Jan. 6. 17, 31, and Feb. 19, 1712-13, it appears that this poem received ſeveral corrections in conſequence of hints from Dr. Swift, who introduced Parnell both to Oxford and Bolingbroke.

            <head>TO HENRY LORD VISCOUNT BOLINGBROKE.</head>
            <byline>BY DR. PARNELL<note n="†" place="bottom">Allegory is in itſelf ſo retired a way of Writing, that it was thought proper to ſay ſomething beforehand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Piece, which is entirely framed upon it. The deſign, therefore, is to ſhew the ſeveral Styles which have been made uſe of by thoſe who have endeavoured to write in verſe. The ſcheme, by which it is carried on, ſuppoſes an old Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Poet couching his obſervations or inſtructions within an Allegory; which Allegory is wrought out upon the ſingle word Flight, as in the figurative way it ſignifies a thought above the common level: here Wit is made to be Pegaſus, and the Poet his Rider, who flies by ſeveral countries where he muſt not touch, by which are meant ſo many vicious Styles, and arrives at laſt at the Sublime. This way of Writing is not only very engaging to the fancy whenever it is well performed; but it has been thought alſo one of the firſt that the Poets made uſe of. Hence aroſe many of thoſe ſtories concerning the Heathen Gods, which at firſt were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to inſinuate Truth and Morality more pleaſingly, and which afterwards made Poetry itſelf more ſolemn, when they happened to be received into the Heathen Divinity. And indeed there ſeems to be no likelier way by which a Poetical Genius may yet appear as an Original, than that he ſhould proceed with a full compaſs of thought and knowledge, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deſign his plan, or to beautify the parts of it, in an allegorical manner. We are much beholden to Antiquity
for thoſe excellent compoſitions by which Writers at preſent form their minds; but it is not ſo much required of us to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here merely to their fables, as to obſerve their manner. For, if we preclude our own invention, Poetry will conſiſt only in expreſſion, or ſimile, or the application of old ſtories; and the utmoſt character to which a Genius can arrive will depend on imitation, or a borrowing from others, which we muſt agree together not to call ſtealing, becauſe we take only from the Ancients. There have been Poets amongſt ourſelves, ſuch as Spenſer and Milton, who have ſucceſsfully ventured further. Theſe inſtances may let us ſee that Invention is not bounded by what has been done before: they may open our imaginations, and be one method of preſerving us from Writing without ſchemes. As for what relates any further particularly to this Poem, the Reader will obſerve, that its aim is Inſtruction. Perhaps a repreſentation of ſeveral miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes and difficulties, which happen to many who write Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, may deter ſome from attempting what they have not been made for: and perhaps the deſcription of ſeveral beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging to it may afford hints towards forming a Genius for delighting and improving mankind. If either of theſe happen, the Poem is uſeful; and upon that account its faults may be more eaſily excuſed. PARNELL.</note>.</byline>

               <p>This Bacchanalian night-prize of the Counter-Scuffle being thus finiſhed, hath ever ſince frighted both priſoners and gaolers from coming into any room, for fear of a ſecond up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar. So that the Counter, for want of ſweet garniſhing, and cleanly looking to, is grown ſo naſly that no man (by his good-will) will thruſt his noſe in at any of the grates: nay,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0771900503:265"/>
will rather go a mile about than come near it; though, to keep it ſweet, a great deal of mace is ſtuck upon every ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, as if he were a capon in white broth. Upon this ſloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs it is woefully haunted with Rats: not ſuch Rats as run up and down in Brew-houſes, ſucking the new wort of ſtrong beer ſo long, and in ſuch abundance, that half the city is compelled to drink beer as ſmall as water; nor thoſe Rats which are not mealy-mouth'd in Bake-houſes, where they gnaw ſo many batches of bread, that a penny loaf wants ſometimes three or four ounces in weight: and then the honeſt Baker is blam'd, and curs'd, and (perhaps) innocently ſet in the pillory. Neither are they thoſe Rats which greaze their throats in Fallow-chandlers ſhops, where they nibble ſo much upon candles, that not one pound in an hundred is ever full weight. No, theſe are no Rats with four legs, but only two; and though they have neſts in a thouſand places of London, yet for the moſt part they run but into two Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traps, that is to ſay, the Counters of Wood-ſtreet and the Poultry, and for that cauſe are called Counter-rats:</p>

            <byline>BY JOHN CROWNE<note n="*" place="bottom">A dramatic writer, whoſe performances both in comedy and tragedy were acted with applauſe, though comedy ſeems to have been more peculiarly his talent. Seventeen of his plays are enumerated by Jacob. He was bred under his father, an independent miniſter in Nova Scotia. Being a man of ſome genius, and impatient of the gloomy education he received in that country, he reſolved upon coming to England, to try if he could not make his fortune by his wits. When he firſt arrived here, his neceſſities were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely urgent: and he was obliged to become a gentleman-uſher to an old Independent lady. But he ſoon grew as weary of that preciſe office, as he was of the diſcipline of Nova Scotia. He ſet himſelf therefore to writing; and preſently made himſelf ſo known to the court and town, that he was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by Charles II. to write "The Maſque of Calypſo." This nomination was procured him by the earl of Rocheſter: it muſt not however be aſcribed entirely to his merit, but to ſome little ſpite in this lord, who deſigned by that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to mortify Mr. Dryden. Upon the breaking-out of the two parties, after the pretended diſcovery of the Popiſh plot, the favour Crowne was in at court induced him to embrace the Tory party; about which time he wrote a comedy called "The City Politicks," in order to ſatirize and expoſe the Whigs. This comedy was by many intrigues of the party-men hindered from appearing upon the ſtage, till the king himſelf laid his abſolute commands on the lord cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain to have it acted immediately. About the latter end of this reign, Crowne, tired out with writing, and deſirous to ſhelter himſelf from the reſentment of many enemies he had made by his "City Politicks," ventured to addreſs the king himſelf, for an eſtabliſhment in ſome office that might be a ſecurity to him for life. The king anſwered,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"he ſhould be provided for;"</q>
but added,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"that he would firſt ſee another comedy."</q>
Mr. Crowne endeavoured to excuſe himſelf, by telling the king, that
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"he plotted ſlowly and aukwardly."</q>
His majeſty replied, that
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"he would help him to a plot;"</q>
and ſo put into his hand the Spaniſh comedy, called "Non pued eſſer," out of which Mr. Crowne took the comedy of "Sir Courtly Nice" The play was juſt ready to appear to the world; and Mr. Crowne extremely delighted to think that he was going to be made happy the remaining part of his life, by the performance of the king's promiſe. But, upon the laſt day of the rehearſal, he met Underhill the player coming from the houſe as he was going to it; upon which, reprimanding him for neglecting ſo conſiderable a part as he had in the comedy, and upon the laſt day too;
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Lord, Sir, ſays Underhill, we are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done."
— "How! ſays Crowne, is the playhouſe on fire?"
"The whole nation, replies the player, will quickly be ſo, for the king is dead."</q>
The king's death ruined Crowne, who had now nothing but his wits to live on for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of his life. It is not certain when he died, but it is ſuppoſed to be ſomewhere about the year 1703. See Dennis's Letters, 1721, vol. I. p. 48. and the Biographical Dictionary, 8vo. Mr. Crowne was author of two other poems, called "Pandion and Amphiginia," and "Daeneids." N.</note>.</byline>

               <head>TO JOHN EARL OF MULGRAVE, &amp;c.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE long been aſhamed to ſee ſo many of my writings march into the world, and yet, not one of them honoured by your lordſhip's patronage. It is an eaſy matter for a troop to force themſelves on ladies and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0771900503:284"/>
neutral gentlemen, or nobility, who will not arm; but they muſt be men of ſome merit and gallantry, who compel regard from a General. Your lordſhip is as much above us in our own ways, as you are in other reſpects; and I give this manifeſt proof of it: your fortune, and, moſt men believe, your inclination, fixes you on the top of eaſe and pleaſure; therefore you would never have written one line, if it had coſt you any pains: yet have you performed maſteries, which we, who
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0771900503:285"/>
make poetry the whole buſineſs of our lives, could never equal. In your Eſſay on Poetry there appears to me a commanding genius ſtanding on a riſe, over-looking the age you live in, ſeeing all the writers in it marching below you, and too often diſorderly; and you give us thoſe orders which plainly ſhew, Poetry attends on you, you may do what you pleaſe with it; but we, compared with your lordſhip, are but poor drudges to it, that have oftener the will than the power to do well. Your lordſhip has not only a perfect underſtanding of what is fit to paſs in the world, but you are of a ſevere temper, which will not give your paſs to any falſe ſenſe; the abſence therefore of your name from my writings ſeems a ſilent charge againſt me of want of merit. To remove that reproach, I take this occaſion to tell the world, your lordſhip has approved of ſome of my writings; and I have longed to make my brags of it, but have been hindered either by the unkindneſs of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which has given me ſome blow, and made me unfit to appear before you, or by the kindneſs of ſome generous perſons, by which my writings have been in a manner mortgaged. Though the law of the land does not reckon favour freely beſtowed among debts, the law of gratitude does; whenever a man is obliged, a judgement is entered againſt him. In the late reign, when your lordſhip graced the Lord Chamberlain's office, you were pleaſed to ſhew me thoſe regards which made me vain: and I was very deſirous to make it known to the world, but the cloudineſs of thoſe times got I think into my head, I did not write ſo well as I
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0771900503:286"/>
have done formerly. Now I venture before your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, becauſe I bring an acquaintance of yours, I am ſure you value, Mr. Boileau; and a piece of his all men of ſenſe have eſteemed, becauſe it expoſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt men who are the antipodes to good ſenſe; prieſts who advance nonſenſe above reaſon, make trifles of the moſt ſolemn matters, and ſolemn things of trifles, are idle in the great affairs of their calling, and buſy in impertinence. By the few we have had amongſt us of ſuch kind of Churchmen, we may gueſs the miſery of the people who live in the Roman Church, where there are ſcarce any other; where the whole maſs of prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is a heap of proud fleſh, and all the ſtrength and nutriment of a nation goes to feed eccleſiaſtical cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; thanks be to God, we are in a condition to make ſport with them; if ever they come amongſt us, they will ſpoil the jeſt. And, paſt diſpute, it is very fit to render men contemptible who endeavour to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſo. We have had too many in our Church who have buſied themſelves, and embroiled others about things which the French have had the underſtanding to know were only fit for a droll. But now we have greater affairs on our hand. We have not time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for modes in Religion, when the Being of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and indeed the Engliſh Nation, lies at ſtake. In a calm at ſea, men may have leiſure to wrangle at Cheſs; but, if a ſtorm ariſes, the quarrel is at an end, and the biſhops, knights, rooks, and pawns, that bred it, are left to ſhift for themſelves. I am well aſſured the Lutrin pleaſes your lordſhip, but I may doubt of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0771900503:287"/>
my management of it; for I treat it as an Engliſh pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateer would do a French prize, great part of it I ſling away, and I daſh, brew, and diſguiſe, the reſt as I think good. I ſhall not value how the world cenſures me, if I have the good-fortune to be approved of by your lordſhip, and thought worthy of the title of, my Lord,</p>
               <p>Your lordſhip's moſt humble and obliged ſervant,</p>

                  <l>At length learn'd Allen the deep ſilence broke.</l>
                  <l>He only, of all the Prieſts our Church obey'd,</l>

                  <l>None in his preſence durſt lay claim to parts,</l>
