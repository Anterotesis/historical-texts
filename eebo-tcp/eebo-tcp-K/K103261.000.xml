            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>READER, if thou art a man of the world, this book will not pleaſe thee—it was written by thoſe who were abſtracted from mankind, and had little reliſh for either the ribaldry or amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0363100400:7"/>
of the preſent times.—Mr. Paulet was a clergyman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing in the world, and unknown to all but men like himſelf—the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of his life he read mankind chiefly in his ſtudy; for it was his unhappy fate, whenever he wiſhed to take a wider range, to experience little more than their falſehood or infidelity.—His ſon, by becoming a private
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0363100400:8"/>
tutor in town for a while, afforded him frequent opportunities of hearing what follies were moſt predominant; and from his own letters, perhaps, it may not be incurious to trace the decent ſobriety of the character of the old Engliſh gentleman, when compared with the inflated maxims of the modern Indian innovator.—The daughter's correſpondence likewiſe will not be totally unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive,
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0363100400:9"/>
as it may afford ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable inſtances of the great changes that, in a ſhort time, may be brought about from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of Manners over Laws, Principles, and Morality.—It may be juſtly urged, perhaps, that Mr. Paulet ſaw every thing through a contracted medium; but, however, the mind is tempered by virtue, or harmonized by religion,
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0363100400:10"/>
I fear there are few good men who can ſurvey the ſcenes that are continually ſhifting before them, without acrimony or diſguſt.—The mind of man in ſolitude is torpid and inactive, but when caſt on the ocean of life, it is diſſipated and infirm—reſtleſs in the purſuit of ſome hidden good, it wears out its ſenſibility by perpetual motion; and confined within the limits of an

unextended empire, it contracts it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and becomes gloomy and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent.</p>

                  <p>AT four o'clock this afternoon I was again ſent for, not to pray by him, but (at my own requeſt) to pay the laſt tribute to expiring friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip—He had no orders to give about either his plumes or his monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—"If I have lived well, ſaid he, my deeds will be graven on the minds of men, and I ſhall have the bleſſings of the deſerving—let the poor be decently ſupplied on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion with all neceſſaries, and if
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0363100400:14"/>
they loved me, they will not wiſh for ſuperfluities—I have ever been their protector, and they would not, I am ſure, convert my funeral into an hour of feſtivity—I feel an awe, but no grief, at my diſſolution—ſome philoſophers, it is ſaid, have been above terrors, but I fear they were below humanity—to ſhudder is the part of the guilty, to ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſmayed is the language of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic, to be humble is the duty of a man—before the mortification took place, I had need of all my reſolution, but I hope in thoſe moments I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed virtue on the rack, and ſuffered torture only to refine my ore from its droſs—There is, I am convinced of it, now a counterpoiſe to all human mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery—ſome hidden reſource which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0363100400:15"/>
the mind can beſt ſupply at its utmoſt exigency—I feel it now, and ſhould think it ill exchanged for all that titles, wealth, fortune, or power could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon me, and tho' I am journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apace to that undiſcovered coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, from which I never ſhall return, I would not wiſh for one hour of added life for aught but for my friends, amongſt whom, my deareſt Paulet, I have ever principally eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you—thus ſaying, he preſſed ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly my hand, looked fervently to heaven—ſighed—and expired.—A ſcene like this awakened all my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and for ſome moments I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced an awful ſomething without a name—tears and grief had nearly overwhelmed me, but I have again recovered my tranquillity, for it would
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0363100400:16"/>
ill become me to fall a victim to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, when my life and my profeſſion demand me to make uſe of its inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—I have gained by his death a trial of that fortitude, which I hope I have not altogether diſgraced—what I have loſt you can eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with me—He was a man, (for I muſt ever dwell on his character) who, though he had experienced all the falſehood of a bad world, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſteeled his heart againſt the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of humanity—he was benevolent without vanity, and generous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oſtentation—he had a heart, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, too ſuſceptible of ſoft impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which ever laid him open to the deſigns of the artful and diſingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo that from the ſuperiority of his underſtanding he derived a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0363100400:17"/>
in his worldly conduct—he was warm in his reſentments, but, leſt he ſhould be behind hand in reparation, paid always over price—he was ſkill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the neceſſary truths of the religion he profeſſed, and it was no inferior branch of his knowledge, that he was ever willing to remain igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of thoſe deeper myſteries which its divine Author thought fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal from him—he was to me a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, a benefactor, and a friend, a friend that—but I will here cloſe the ſubject, entreating you, my deareſt Charles, to withdraw frequently from the buſy ſcenes of life to contemplate the character of a man, which may add fervour to virtue, zeal to religion, and confidence to truth.</p>

                  <p>I Hope you would not ſuppoſe that either the diverſions of town, or the dignity of my new character as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0363100400:21"/>
would ſo entirely engroſs my attention, as to make me forget my friends—It is true, this mode of life has not a little engaged both my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and my wonder—I wonder at every thing I ſee, and then I wonder that I ſhould wonder at any thing—all here is one perpetual ſcene of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, noiſe, and diſſipation—mankind ever in purſuit of ſomething, which when found, creates more wants than it ſupplies—a general ſiege is laid againſt an old offender called Time, which, though every one complains of the loſs of, yet every one is in league to kill it as faſt as poſſible—the old maid at Ranelagh may have hopes of making a conqueſt, and the old ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron at a rout may be enraptured with ſpadille—but, believe me, theſe are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0363100400:22"/>
only ſecondary conſiderations—to kill ſo much time is the principal point in view—for how can the old maid experience any real pleaſure from haunting thoſe circles where ſhe is conſcious that ſhe is conſidered but as the forlorn ſhadow of her departed beauty—or how can the old matron receive any high gratification from returning to thoſe tables, where ſhe muſt reflect (if ſhe has not ſtifled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection) that ſhe can only afford new ſpecimens of the acidity of her tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the fraudulency of her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—indeed ſhe has one conſolation, that the troops ſhe is engaged with are generally full as corrupt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated as herſelf.—You will ſay that the old can have but few proſpects and amuſements—it is true, but they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0363100400:23"/>
can have real ones, proſpects ever brightening, as attraction muſt ever encreaſe, the nearer we approach the object—but you will now exclaim that I appear already to write from my dictatorial chair, and give laws in the true ſtyle of a ſchool-maſter; but I can never help expatiating on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, for it is not ſo much the comet itſelf, as the tail of that comet that I am ſo much in care for—there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome expecting niece or entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed couſin, who, to be kept out of harm's way, muſt be the watchful ſentinel to all this ſcene of diſorder—good Heavens! as if the mind could be more in harm's way, or more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated than by ſitting ſeven hours at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant on a card-table, now and then admiring work, perhaps indulged by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0363100400:24"/>
introducing her knotting, and ſtoring her mind (for to read would be ill manners) with thoſe remarks only that avarice, ignorance, and ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour are continually ſuggeſting—and what are the fruits of this miſerable farrago every day's experience too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally evinces.—You think I wiſh to deter you from coming here—indeed I do,—for tho' the country, I fear, affords frequently no better examples, yet it is impoſſible to drive quite ſo faſt on croſs-roads, as it is on a turn-pike; and there are numbers who can keep themſelves afloat on a gentle ſtream, whoſe ſtrength is yet utterly inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſtem a torrent.—I do not doubt either the goodneſs of your heart, or the firmneſs of your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but remember the wiſeſt and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0363100400:25"/>
the beſt have found the inefficacy of reaſon againſt worldly ſeduction—nor do I mean to ſtifle a generous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, or preclude that trial which is appointed to virtue—I know both their value and reward—but conſider—true courage conſiſts in combating an enemy nobly, that attacks you—it is the part of a bravado only to be affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous for a conteſt.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0363100400:28"/>
of literary attainments—for a ſhort time he has been at Weſtminſter ſchool, but (as too frequently is the caſe) has been ſo much taken off by the diverſions of the town, that it was well if in the courſe of the week the Maſters were able to remove that love of diſſipation, which the young man had imbibed the preceding days of it—however, before I came to him he could tolerably conſtrue ſome of the eaſier claſſics, and he is by no means deficient in point of natural abilities—by the death of his mother he is now committed to the care of an uncle, who, for a year and a half, has placed him under my direction—what my mediocrity ſhall be able to impart I know not; but attention will not be wanting, and I have a father ever
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0363100400:29"/>
able and willing to ſupply all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies—my preſent endeavour is to improve his taſte by furniſhing his mind with the beſt criticiſms on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient literature, ſuch as Warburton's on the 6th Book of Virgil, and Hurd's on the Art of Poetry.—By the aid of theſe books I perceive his mind to be wonderfully enlarged, and he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready remarked that the fame of the commentators ought nearly to equal the glory of their reſpective authors—from hence you will gather that he has Feeling, which in preference to every other conſideration ought prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to be improved.—He has juſt aſked my opinion of the Ramblers, which, ſays he, I find are generally conſidered as pompous and pedantic—I tell him that the Ramblers are my
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0363100400:30"/>

<q rend="inline margQuotes">"That they are the ſtore-houſe of all moral virtues."</q>
—I fear he thinks I have ſtrong prejudices, for he often obſerves that the world ſpeaks quite otherwiſe—as to the world, I tell him, there are but few who are capable of judging—thoſe that are, either through envy or other malignant paſſions, will rarely do juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to living authors—Johnſon would be more read, was his matter as thinly ſpread as in other periodical publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—then he has written on party ſubjects, and this can never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given by his vanquiſhed opponents—Warburton is not leſs obnoxious on the ſame account—indeed ſo far I will
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0363100400:31"/>
accede—that the one by long dealing in words has too much encreaſed the vocabulary, and the other by dealing too much with mankind has at length exceeded the decent limits of all ſober ſatire—but truth and virtue were their guides, and whilſt theſe remain in the world, ſuch authors will ever be conſidered as their brighteſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments—an old gentleman was by chance preſent at this dialogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my pupil and me, who haſtily exclaimed, "Good God! ſir, why I never heard a ſyllable of all this, in regard to either of them, and I have reſided the greateſt part of my life<note n="*" place="bottom">The biſhop of Glouceſter lived at Prior Park, near Bath, and the author of the Ramblers in Johnſon's Court, Fleet-ſtreet.

                     <salute>Dear Charles,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>MY time of late has been much taken up in aſſiſting the executors to ſettle Mr. Arlington's affairs—we now find that from the very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous ſale of the eſtate, after paying off all the debts, there will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left very conſiderable for his relations—a circumſtance which, could he have known, poor man! would have greatly contributed to have brightened up the evening of his days—but to wave this melancholy ſubject.</p>
                  <p>So ignorant, Charles, was I of the world, that I did not know it was one great inſtance of politeneſs to go up to town only juſt to come down again,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0363100400:48"/>
and that with ſuch rapidity, that a by-ſtander might fancy that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional welfare depended on their ſpeed—<hi>We</hi> have now brought down with us, I aſſure you, as part of <hi>our</hi> retinue, a domeſtic chaplain, Mr. <hi>Pliant</hi>—ſo ſilken, ſo ſupple, and ſo complying, that I could almoſt fancy him to ſay to his patron—<q rend="inline">"Is it your pleaſure, ſir, to believe in God?"</q>—He is, I find on enquiry, a diſtant relation, and ſeems thoroughly broke in to the office he is to fill—yeſterday, as I was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from my uſual ride, I met him, like <hi>Juſtice Overdo</hi> in the comedy, in queſt of enormities, and we really enjoyed a very pretty kind of a chit-chat, till at length ſome how or other I dropped out ſomething about ſervilities—<q rend="inline">"Servilities!" ſays he, "now I reckon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0363100400:49"/>
you think that I am forced to ſubmit to ſome ſervilities as you call them—no, ſir, let me tell you, my mode of life is perfectly agreeable to me—Mr. Maſſem keeps a good table, has the choiceſt liquors—and, though your country hereabouts to be ſure is dull enough, yet we have always company in the houſe to paſs away the time with—and as for buſineſs, I have nothing to do but to duſt the books—clean the bird-cages, and now and then make rebuſſes for the ladies—indeed if we had not ſome amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments amongſt ourſelves, it would be dull enough here, for I have been ſauntering about," ſays he, "for theſe two hours, and cannot meet with any one thing worthy the leaſt obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Surely," ſays I, "ſir, nature,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0363100400:50"/>
to a mind capable of reflection like yours, every where preſents a fund of entertainment—to a man, who knows how to take a ride, this blade of graſs, or this declining hill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords an infinite ſcope for contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation—in this ſequeſtered ſcene me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I could ſay with Shakeſpeare, that I

                           <l>" Find tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,</l>
                           <l>Sermons in ſtones, and good in every thing."</l>
                        </q>
but if this retired proſpect delights you not, I will return with you to the top of the hill, and preſent you with an object that may call forth all your attention—that is at once a cure for pride, and a lecture to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0363100400:51"/>
that reminds philoſophy of its true end, and makes none but the ignorant tremble to behold it—it leads the languid to hope, allays the the thirſt of avarice, and places wealth on its true foundation—to you and me, ſir, it may be the vehicle to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; a car more triumphant than ever graced the conqueſts of a Caeſar, or an Alexander"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Good God! ſir", ſays my companion, "what can you mean?—I can ſee nothing but a HEARSE."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, Charles, as I found the preſent delighted him not, I thought it by no means unfair to raiſe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Futurity.</p>

                  <p>I Intended by to-day's poſt to have ſent you a ſtring of political reports, with ſome large extracts from ſpeeches ſaid to have been lately made in the houſe of commons; but, as I find the former are nothing but reports, and the latter, like dying confeſſions, were printed beforehand, I now ſit down with an abſolute determination to give you nothing but the truth.</p>
                  <p>The grand vehicle of buſineſs in this metropolis appears to me to be a <hi>Lie</hi>—it riſes in the morning with the watchman, bawling out—<hi>Half an hour paſt eleven o'clock,</hi> and accompanies the 'prentice home, who pulls out his

watch with great eagerneſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his maſter that it has not yet ſtruck <hi>twelve</hi>—through the regions of darkneſs, its operations perhaps are better ſuppoſed than deſcribed, for it ſtands not unveiled in open day-light till it is circulated through the Strand by paragraphs, poſtcripts, letters, and advertiſements—fame, in the ſhape of a news-carrier, ſounding the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet before it.—By its aid the tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and his wife are enabled to drink their coffee, and by its aid the tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and his wife are enabled to drink that coffee comfortably, for ſcandal, like irreligion, gives a reliſh to many enjoyments.—But now the whole city is in a ferment, for there its morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are monopolized, and it is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed</hi> and <hi>brokered</hi> about to greater

or leſs advantage from its different degrees of ſanctity in great wigs, and its more or leſs ſolemnity in city faces—indeed it is never a moment unemployed there but at dinner-time, when it ſteals away to meet the ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man on his return from the gaming-table or the ſtews—with him it holds a levee, where it is decked in ſmiles and graces—(what it has loſt in weight it has gained in politeneſs)—and lends to expectation, even the confidence of ſucceſs—the veil indeed is never taken off, for the promiſer gives a hundred to ſtrengthen one, till time alone convinces you of the uncertainty of a future day—you now plead loudly for admittance, but to-morrow is called in to the juggler's aid, for this afternoon he is engaged to vote

againſt <hi>the Articles,</hi> and at night he muſt negociate with a Jew ere he dares to ſhow his face again before the waiter at Almack's—but his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants perhaps are town-bred, and are taught to deſcry want and neceſſity by intuition—Lying is their profeſſed ſcience, for what miſchiefs might not enſue if through ignorance a ſtranger ſhould be let in to ſee a patriot barter his integrity, or a fair one her reputation and her virtue—if miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes like theſe ſhould ariſe, <hi>Honour</hi> muſt be called in as a ſafe-guard here, as <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is the ſecurity of the city—but the evening advances, and it is now ſold wholeſale at theatres, lecture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and all other places of public diverſion—like Scrub, it may be ſaid to be of all profeſſions—<q rend="inline">"one day

                  <p>I Received your laſt <hi>kind</hi> letter, and now ſit down to give you ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle account of the jaunt I have juſt taken with my good friends into Derbyſhire.—My father, for a long time, was againſt my going, but Miſs Maſſem did every thing in her power to teaze him into it.—At Derby we ſaw the Silk mills, and what I liked much better the New aſſembly room, and the China manufactory, but we ſtaid there only a ſhort time, for there was a low family who found out Mr. Maſſem, and was exceedingly troubleſome and impertinent to him, ſo in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we went to Kedleſton, where we
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0363100400:77"/>
had a very tolerable dance—next day we ſaw lord Scarſdale's, which is very fine to be ſure; but Miſs Maſſem found great fault with the furniture of the houſe, and Mr. Layout, who was with us, allowed no part of the garden ground to be diſpoſed in taſte—Mr. Maſſem admired nothing but the large pillars; and captain Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville thought there was a great deal of idle money thrown away upon the library—as for myſelf, I liked every thing, but particularly the ſideboard—from Kedleſton we went to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, which, if it was not for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, would, if poſſible, be ten times more diſmal than Marleſton—how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we danced and went upon the water with muſic, and drank tea at the boat houſe, and, upon the whole,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0363100400:78"/>
paſſed our time very agreably—from thence we went to Chatſworth—it proved a moſt charming day, and we were all enraptured with the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works—in ſome places, cataracts of water fall down ſtairs twenty yards deep, and in others the water is forced up into the air to the moſt incredible height, to ſay nothing of the artificial tree which would have ſprinkled us all over from its leaves, if it had not been out of order—from Chatſworth we went to Buxton, where we joined parties with lord Canvaſs and Dr. and Mrs. Grudgens—at firſt they took no notice of us, but as ſoon as they found out who Mr. Maſſem was, they were particularly complaiſant and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.—My lord is moſt exceedingly engaging—but Dr Grudgens talks of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0363100400:79"/>
nothing but eating and preferment—and then ſo ſuſpicious, that in a morning, when he played at <hi>all-fours</hi> with captain Glanville, if the hand was not out before the bell rung, he was ſure to keep the cards in his pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et all the while he knelt down to ſay his prayers—indeed prayers here are merely made a farce of—for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple laugh and whiſper the whole time—tho' it would not ſignify much if they did not, for what with the howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of dogs, the bawling of footmen, and the giggling of ladies maids in the paſſages, it would be utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to hear one ſyllable that the parſon ſaid—poor man!—I was really quite ſorry for him, and my father would have been abſolutely ſhocked, for the company had uſed to pay him
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0363100400:80"/>
more or leſs, juſt as they won or loſt at cards—indeed I thought he ſeemed to have no advantage but that of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace at the head of the table, whilſt the ladies were fighting for the wings of the chickens.—But I muſt tell you one circumſtance that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened about Mrs. Grudgens—one day ſhe was very buſy in carving an immenſe gooſe that ſtood before her, when captain Glanville deſired her next neighbour to help him to ſome apple pye—Mrs. Grudgens, with all the good nature in the world, came immediately out of the gooſe, and plunged directly into the pye—to be ſure ſhe was elbow-deep in ſage and onion—and the captain was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky, for he is a man of vaſt wit, as to ſet all the company into a loud laugh
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0363100400:81"/>
by calling out—<q rend="inline">"For heaven's ſake madam ſtop—I aſked for apple pye—I did not mean a medley one."</q>

                  <p>I Muſt ſtill think you too young to go into orders—I may be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in my notions perhaps—but I will chearfully ſtreighten my own circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to approve my ſincerity.—It has been well obſerved, that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0363100400:82"/>
                     <q rend="inline">"young men are apt to miſtake the completion of their academic courſes for the completion of their theologic ſtudies"</q>—a miſtake which inclines them to aſpire to teach others, ſeeing the rather, (as St. Paul expreſſes it) that they ought to be taught them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves."—Thoſe who are appointed to explain the oracles of God, ſhould have attended to them moſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly—otherwiſe they may ſoon be caught in the deluſive ſnares of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern infidelity, or wax old in the pernicious ſyſtem of not changing <q rend="inline">"the poſture of defence, and of keeping to ſtrong holds."</q>—And I am ſorry to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that true religion has nearly ſuffered as much from the one as from the other—Our Saviour, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, has confined the practice of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0363100400:83"/>
our duty within the limits of his own ſermon on the mount; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, as a divine, it will be requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that you ſhould be able to give a rational account of the faith that is in you—a rational and a cautious one let it always be, for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in the hands of controvertiſts, have generally been wreſted to the moſt infamous purpoſes—each man inſiſting on that being irreligion, which was only not conſonant to his own prejudices.—St. Auguſtine, I know, aſſerts, that <note n="*" place="bottom">Dictum eſt tamen—, non ut aliquid diceretur, ſed ne taceretur. Aug. de Trin. lib. v.c.9.</note> 
                     <q rend="inline">"when any enquiry is made, it is not neceſſary that you ſhould ſay any thing to the purpoſe, but well or ill that you ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep talking"</q>—but none but

ſuch a ſaint would have ſaid it, and this very aſſertion with me would invalidate his whole authority.—In regard to ſtudying the Fathers in general, I can only ſay, that I hope they were ſincere, but by their ſtrange interpretations, (to ſay no worſe of them) they have opened a door to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule; and from their abſurdities, modern infidels have ſought occaſion to undermine the main fabrick of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion itſelf.

                  <p>I Am juſt returned from Sadlers Wells, which does not only lower my idea of the times, but even of human nature—I do not ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the entertainment itſelf as it is called, as on the cruel means that muſt have been made uſe of before the managers could have procured ſo dreadful an exhibition—whence can ariſe the pleaſure of ſeeing children ſuſpended in the air, or toſſed about
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0363100400:91"/>
at the utmoſt hazard of their lives to gratify the avarice of unnatural parents? But indeed the country affords almoſt as ſtrong inſtances of cruelty, as town, for wreſtling, ſingle-ſtick, or even foot-ball, are never conſidered as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions by the common people, but as attended with danger, miſchief, or blood-ſhed;—but in town, what ſhocks me moſt, is that continual flocking to executions—in the country, from the leſs frequency of them, even butchers weep, but here they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the next diverſions to Sadlers Wells; and by uſe men can ſee a monkey dangling from a wire, or a fellow-creature expiring at the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows with equal unconcern—how much care therefore ſhould be taken to inculcate the principles of humanity
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0363100400:92"/>
in youth, a term which in general, I believe, is miſtaken for cowardice; how little care indeed is taken, even amongſt the higher ranks of people, who ſuffer their children unmercifully to treat the whole brute-creation, and then wonder that in time they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come cruel enemies and undutiful children—they think not how early theſe inhuman principles are imbibed; they begin indeed in infancy only with torturing flies, but they end in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting to view the moſt horrid murders of the inquiſition.</p>

                  <p>THE alterations already made at Marleſton are ſo great, that I hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know my own village—Mr. Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſem every day makes purchaſes of ground, no matter at what expence, that Mr. Layout may at leaſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he has ſcope enough for his invention. I hear of nothing but Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſks, Statues, Gazebos, Terminations, and a Laurel-belt—they talk of taſte juſt as if it was to be brought down in a broad-wheeled waggon, and they had nothing to do but to ſcatter it at random—Mr. Layout thinks there ſhould be a clump, and there is one; the 'ſquire thinks it would look pretty
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0363100400:95"/>
to cut a viſta through it, and it is cut; and his ſiſter thinks ſhe ſhould like a dairy-houſe near the ſpot, and ſhe builds it—ſo that at laſt it will be an <hi>Olio,</hi> a <hi>Chriſtmas Pie,</hi> a <hi>Solomon Gundy,</hi> or perhaps a <hi>Fool's Coat</hi>—I muſt own, it rather grieves me to find that the grove on the right hand, where the ruſtic ſeat was, with the motto of <hi>Hae latebrae dulces &amp; ſi jam credis, amoenae,</hi> ſhould be condemned to be cut down, as well as the large one, which Mr. Arlington had uſed to call Shenſtone's Grove, for the urn to his memory was pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily executed, and the placing of the ſtatue of the Sibyl in front of it, which ſeemed to exclaim <hi>Procul O procul eſte profani!</hi> was in my opinion a very happy thought—however, they are all to be ſwept away, to make room,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0363100400:96"/>
as the 'ſquire informs me, for a fine Mercury <hi>with his quiver,</hi> and a Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules <hi>with his trident</hi>—I fear, ſome how or other, theſe Latin mottoes have called down vengeance on the groves themſelves, for I am ſure, that neither he nor his chaplain can conſtrue them—inſtead of theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable ſhades, a paltry ſhrubbery is to be planted, which is to be deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated (as the 'ſquire would ſay), <q rend="inline">"with all the monſters of the internal world."</q>—By what I ſee of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended alterations of the water, it is deſtined to take any courſe but its own, for the merit of every thing ſeems to conſiſt only in the ſum it is to coſt;—where the genius of the place is attended to, I am as much delighted as any man with modern
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0363100400:97"/>
improvements—but where expence is only conſidered, or miſtaken as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other name for real taſte, I feel ſo much diſguſt, that I turn away my eyes from falſe ornament, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template nature herſelf in a ſimple farm, unbroke-in upon by a Mr. Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Maſſem has not only qualified himſelf to act as a Juſtice of the peace, but has likewiſe bought a ſeat in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—from this latter acquiſition to his dignity, he will be enabled to do very little good or harm; but from the former, where ſome preparation is neceſſary, much miſchief may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to the neighbourhood, if he ſhould prove, as I fear will be the caſe, <q rend="inline">"a law unto himſelf."</q>—indeed I am far from wiſhing to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0363100400:98"/>
the power of a juſtice, for very few are willing to act as it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pecuniary advantages,—and this I partly attribute to the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of attornies—theſe ſinful men in the fleſh (as the Quakers call them) have ſtopped the free courſe of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and turned that food, which ought to have proved our nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſupport, into a diſeaſe.—What could be his motive for going into parliament (<hi>except the honour on't</hi>) I did not foreſee, but Miſs Maſſem informs me, that this will account for his civility in bowing to many of the ſhabby-looking people that he meets with in the ſtreets of London—he may now call them his conſtituents, but I believe in reality
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0363100400:99"/>
they are no other than his own poor relations.</p>
                  <p>Oh!

                  <p>P.S. Mr. Maſſem has juſt been with me, and told me the price of his ſeat; and I agree with him that he has bought in very dear, for the ſtocks on that exchange are ſoon likely to fall.</p>

neceſſity of my ſeeing more of the world, he always ſays he does not wiſh it—that he had much rather ſee me married to a good man, than a great one, and I believe he is as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to meet with the one as the other in this neighbourhood, unleſs he can perſuade poor old Dr. Snore to make an offer, or the ever amiable and charming maſter Patty Pipkin; but perhaps he aſpires ſo high as to think I may marry 'ſquire Homebrew'd, or Parſon Poacher—if I ſhould be honoured with the firſt, my employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be I ſuppoſe to make tea all day long to ſettle his ſtomach, and if I take the other, I ſhould be conſtantly engaged in packing up hampers of hares and partridges to ſend to town, to be exchanged by

his correſpondents for oyſters and brandy.—My father ſeriouſly, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, means all for my good, but I am every day more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that his not knowing the world, will be my greateſt misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, for I am ſure Marleſtone is not the place, if a woman (as Miſs Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſem ſays) is intended to make the moſt of herſelf.

In regard to <q rend="inline">"women making the moſt of themſelves,"</q> Miſs Maſſem has borrowed that idea from her brother, who has been uſed in India to make ſuch purchaſes at a public market; and indeed if the plan was as openly avowed here, in my mind it would make but very little difference—for what is running from plays to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certs, from concerts to routs, and from routs to the Pantheon, but being equally expoſed to ſale at a public market—and what is the preparation to it but the vileſt proſtitution of time, reaſon, and tranquility—the mornings are paſſed in ſelecting orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

figure of a Coloſſus may be eaſily changed into an Egyptian idol;—the next ſtep is to conſult the ſtrength of the houſe, in regard to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers—as there are no tolerable men, the lady muſt recite at leaſt half the play—they have an old man that can make a ſhift to whine out a ſmall part, a roaring tyrant, and a d—m your blood lover, and then the ſcene-ſhifters may ſupply the reſt—Whilſt the work is perfecting, the public is informed by the News-papers that a gentleman of diſtinguiſhed abilities (now abroad) will ſoon favour the town with a new tragedy—the firſt night of the performance the houſe is crowded in every corner of it (for mankind are not in queſt of what is good, but of any Haſh that they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0363100400:112"/>
to be a new one)—the curtain riſes to ſoft muſic, the lady makes vows at the altar, the tyrant and his trumpets alarm her—ſhe faints, and is ordered to be married.—A hermit ſecretes her from the tyrant—diſcovers himſelf to be her father, the lover finds out the hermitage, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond acts ends with their embraces.—They muſt then embrace no more—he is her brother—ſhe flies from him to an altar, or a tomb, (this makes variety in the puppet-ſhow)—the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſees her, and would abſolutely bear her off, but ſhe is reſcued by her brother.—In the fourth act her brother is ſeized by the tyrant's guards—is impriſoned—ſhe viſits him—the guards drag her from her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the tyrant—he then reſolves
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0363100400:113"/>
inſtantly to marry her—ſhe ſcreams, and the hermit burſts in, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to make an important diſcovery, if he will only delay the nuptials—the tyrant ſtill perſiſts—his guards ſeize the hermit—ſhe rages, prays, and goes mad—the noiſe encreaſes, and the theatre is drowned with tears.—Expectation is now big for the fifth act—what a ſcene of diſtreſs!—ſhe is abſolutely forced to the altar, but there, rather than marry the tyrant, the murderer of her race, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers her ſenſes, and murders him herſelf—the guards take no notice of the matter, and the houſe applauds her for near a quarter of an hour;—the hermit then declares that her lover is not her brother, but a young prince whom he has educated, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0363100400:114"/>
therefore with great piety gives his bleſſing on their nuptials—all then is joy and exultation—and thus, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all the rules of Tragedy, ends this miſerable happy cataſtrophe.—Some half dozen in the theatre per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be rather diſcontented, but to keep them in humour, a favourite actreſs takes off their attention from the play, by giving them the news of the town by way of epilogue.</p>
                  <p>This may not be the exact drama; but <hi>Sethona,</hi> which I have juſt now ſeen, is, if poſſible, much more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and inconſiſtent.</p>

                  <p>I Was in hopes to have found more Remarks of Mr. Arlington's on Gardening, &amp;c. than I am at preſent able to ſend you—he evidently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have ſaid more on Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, which is abſolutely neceſſary likewiſe to be thoroughly underſtood by the complete Maſter of modern Deſign.</p>
                  <p>From theſe papers you will ſee what notions the ancients held of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0363100400:137"/>
gardening in general; but ſhould you ever wiſh to dive into further parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, I will ſhew you a moſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious book on that ſubject, which I have by me; the title of it is <hi>Stengel de Horto</hi>—mine is the ſecond edition, printed in 1650.—There are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand different receipts to make para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes; and his account of the gardens in Italy will much divert you: indeed I ſuſpect that the Italian gardens are not much improved ſince the days of <hi>Phflaumeren.</hi>—In regard to the French gardens, you may look over a book entitled <hi>Voyage Pittoreſque des Environs des Paris, par M. D. . .</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, as you would ſuppoſe a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to begin, with ſaying,

                  <p>Since lord Kamis and Mr. Shen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone publiſhed their Remarks, there has appeared a little Eſſay on Deſign in Gardening, by a gentleman of the Temple, and an octavo volume of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, written by Mr. Wh—ley; both of them books of merit, but the latter, I think, is too full of technical terms for a novice to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in.</p>

                                 <p>It is not improbable, ſays Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Temple, but that the moſt refined pleaſures of invention deſcended ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier into Lower Aſia from Damaſcus and Aſſyria—but as theſe nations abounded not with heroes, the poets make little or no mention of them.</p>
                                 <p>It has been ſuppoſed, that Epicurus was the firſt who introduced gardens into Greece—but Pliny aſſures us, he was only the firſt who had a garden within the city of Athens, whereas before his time they were without the walls, like the <hi>Horti Suburbani</hi> of the Romans.</p>
                                 <p>

                                 </p>
                                 <p>Nor was this luxury confined mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the philoſophers—the greateſt warriours ſought for hours of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſuch retirements, and the ſame hands were employed in the ſervice of agriculture, which had raiſed and ſupported the glory of their country.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0363100400:145"/>Though utility was chiefly ſought for in the gardens of the philoſophers, yet Virgil's Deſcription of the Elyſian Fields affords a moſt beautiful ſpecimen of bold imagery and rich deſign.—<q rend="inline">"The full green of the woods—the gayly il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated lawn, the grove with the rapid river iſſuing from it; the duſky thickets, the freſh meads watered with rills, the ſequeſtered vale rendered more ſolemn by the thick wood, and placid ſtream."</q>—His account likewiſe of the old Corycians gardens makes us greatly lament, that haſte ſhould have deprived the world of his maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructions on a ſubject he ſo much admired—Father Harduin, indeed, in his Notes on Pliny, thinks the loſs is amply made up to us by his brother Jeſuit's Poem on Gardening, which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0363100400:146"/>
he puts in competition with the Georgics—an opinion which will be adopted by ſuch critics as feel no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the feeble deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of—and the glowing pictures of a <hi>Maſon.</hi>

                                 <p>In England we have ever, till of late, moſt ſervilely copied our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of gardening from the Italians, French, Flemiſh, or Dutch, all of whom indeed ſeem to have offered nothing better in the conſtruction of them, than <q rend="inline">"clipt hedges, parterres, ſquirting fountains, true-love knots, and flouriſhes."</q>—Sir William Temple ſeems much delighted with the taſte brought in by king William, of which the evergreen quarter at Kenſington remains a ſpecimen; and offers Moore Park, in Hertfordſhire, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0363100400:147"/>
figure of a garden he ever ſaw—indeed he allows there may be other forms admitted wholly irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, but they muſt owe their beauty to ſome extraordinary diſpoſitions of nature.</p>
                                 <p>Lord Bacon does not like images cut out in juniper, or other garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuff—<q rend="inline">"they be for children," ſays he—"but can approve of little low hedges cut round like welts, with ſome pretty pyramids—and in ſome places fair columns upon frames of carpenter's work."</q>

                                 <p>Mr. Pope ſeverely ridicules the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of nature, but propoſes a place to be copied from, which in his time partook largely of the old abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties<note n="‡" place="bottom">A full detail of them may be found in Monſr. de Phflaumeren, &amp;c</note>; and whoſe beauties were but

ought to be tempered with ſimplicity, rejecting ſumptuous and glaring or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments—in this reſpect the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Oxford may be deemed a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect model."</q>—That the gardens of Oxford may be as uſeful and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as thoſe of ancient Rome, for the purpoſes of ſtudy and application, I will by no means preſume to deny—but they are certainly as artful as their buildings—they are formal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out unity of deſign, and complex without variety.</p>

—utility would ſuffer if the ground was not poliſhed near the dwelling; but this poliſh, to ſpeak philoſophically, ſhould be, I think inverſely as the diſtance.</p>
                                 <p>Mr. Burke doubts <q rend="inline">"whether beauty be at all an idea belonging to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion"</q>—ſurely the effect produced by it in architecture ſtrikes even a common eye with pleaſure—the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance produced from vegetables is not much to the purpoſe, for it will appear from an accurate ſurvey, that there is more regularity in the parts of flowers than is commonly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined—their forms indeed are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely varied, but in the ſame plant nature ſeldom deviates from the laws of proportion, and ſome of our beſt botaniſts have actually founded much
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0363100400:151"/>
of their ſyſtems upon the proportion of the parts—ſo far therefore from ſuppoſing no beauty to reſult from proportion, we may infer that ſome part at leaſt of the beauty even of vegetables ariſes from it.</p>
                                 <p>It is ſuppoſed by modern rules that all avenues of courſe muſt be cut down, but I am far from thinking, that they may not frequently remain to great advantage—they muſt be long and wide, and ſhould properly lead to a Gothic caſtle, tower, or any other large and ancient building.—I know it has been ſaid,<note n="†" place="bottom">Vide Eſſay on Sublime and Beautiful.</note> 
                                    <q rend="inline">"that ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of a moderate length are far grander, and that a true artiſt ſhould always put a generous deceit on the

will ſuffer for it—a magnificent build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will certainly appear more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent after viewing a cottage—but where is the connection between a dairy and a Chineſe temple, a ruſtic ſeat and a Grecian altar?</p>
                                 <p>We rarely ſee the whole of a building, with its furniture, confined to one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion—ſome minute article is for ever giving us diſguſt—we view an hermitage for inſtance;—from the gloomy entrance into it—the crucifix and other emblems placed in order—the ſtraw-bed and old ſeat—we are ſo ſtruck with the ſolemnity of the ſcene, that we are even in expectation of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaint himſelf approach to meet us—till all of a ſudden a modern din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing table preſents itſelf to view, and at once deſtroys all our enthuſiaſm.—

                     <salute>Dear Father,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Have now been near a week at Bath with my pupil—we lodge at the new hotel, called York houſe, which is very commodious—indeed more ſo, I think, than the noble one juſt fitted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in Covent-Garden, as there are
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0363100400:178"/>
more conveniencies under the ſame roof.—You have heard ſo much of the neatneſs and regularity of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings here, that it is unneceſſary for me to expatiate upon them—the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus and ſouth front of the Square are beautiful beyond deſcription; but I cannot approve the Creſcent, though I muſt confeſs I never ſaw any build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (where ſo many rules of architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were violated) that altogether looked ſo well.—To deſcribe the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and faſhions here, would be far beyond my art, though they have many peculiar to themſelves—as in town, people quarrel for places and preferments, and where ſome great prize is held up to the aſpirants; ſo here, for want of better employment, they have been abſolutely compelled
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0363100400:179"/>
to quarrel for nothing at all—not whether one man ſhould have more popularity or higher diſtinction than another, but whether he ſhould go up the hill or down to dance his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuet; and whether the important place of maſter of the ceremonies ſhould be filled by a native of Ireland or England—nay, to ſo great a degree has this faſhion of quarrelling for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing prevailed amongſt the fair ſex, that, not content merely with the war of the tongue, they have even deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to blows—this can be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to nothing but the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Fermentation of the waters.</p>
                  <p>The numberleſs evils to which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are always by neceſſity expoſed, ſhould make them, one would think, at all times endeavour to unite in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0363100400:180"/>
bands of mutual harmony, and here eſpecially, where ſo many are in a perpetual ſtate of ſuffering—yet here, from mere faſhion, the ſtrangeſt infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation prevails, even amongſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, who fly as far as poſſible from the baths and the ſhelter of the lower town, to brave the turbulency of the mountains;—the buildings are now extended ſo far, that, as the Iriſhman would ſay, <q rend="inline">"Bath is run away from itſelf, it is abſolutely gone out of its own town;"</q> and it may do very well for the healthful to follow it, but ſure it is the greateſt abſurdity in the world that invalids ſhould fly as far as poſſible from ſhelter, and from all thoſe advantages for which Bath is ſo peculiarly and ſo juſtly celebrated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0363100400:181"/>The waters (if you believe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries) are ſpecifics for all diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; there is only one that you can poſſibly die of, which is Obſtinacy—this becomes incurable from not tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advice enough about the uſe of them, when preſent, or by removing from the benefit of them too ſoon—it is true, lady <hi>Skinandbone</hi> has been coughing up her lungs here theſe two years, but would certainly have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, had ſhe not <hi>obſtinately</hi> refuſed to ſtay one fortnight longer; and my lord <hi>Laſtlegs</hi> would abſolutely have relinquiſhed his crutches in a few days more, and hung them up in the pump-room as the moſt memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable trophies in it—had he not <hi>obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately</hi> reſolved to change theſe ever efficacious waters for thoſe of Briſtol.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0363100400:182"/>In regard to the diverſions, there is a play-houſe here, where the actors (excluſive of Garrick) are in general full as good as thoſe in town—in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy they do not always ſpeak with <q rend="inline">"a good accent and good diſcretion,"</q> but I have ſeen ſome characters in comedy really ſupported with great humour and propriety.—The new rooms are elegantly fitted up, and may be better calculated, perhaps, than any others for the purpoſes of dancing and gaming; but as I never partake of the latter, and not very frequently of the former, they afford me but little or no entertainment—for an evening or two I might have been delighted with the ſplendor of the appearance, but ſoon, (as ſome one expreſſes it)
<q>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0363100400:183"/>
                        <l>" The gay idea palls upon the ſenſe,</l>
                        <l>" And coldly ſtrikes the mind with feeble bliſs."</l>
                     </q>
In ſhort, if I was obliged to give you my opinion of Bath, I ſhould define it to be a place, in which though life, perhaps, may not be paſſed moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, it may, nevertheleſs, be waſted agreeably—amongſt wanton widows, and debauched wives, <hi>forſaken</hi> Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and <hi>forſaking</hi> men of quality.</p>
                  <p>This place is ſo fertile of anecdote, that I could ſend you volumes from it inſtead of epiſtles.</p>

                     <p>P.S. There is a literary ſociety eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed near Bath by a ſet of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and ladies where many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements

are made on the prizes that were diſtributed by the ancients—inſtead of the bay they give jeſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and inſtead of laurels artificial noſegays—I have not ſeen any of the literary productions, but hear there will ſoon be publiſhed a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent didactic poem on the beautiful arch of lady Horatia Pedant's auburn eye brow.</p>

                  <p>THIS morning put a period to all my happineſs—your ſiſter—your loſt unhappy ſiſter is fled with Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville!—The care, the affection that I
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0363100400:185"/>
have ever ſhewn for her—all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of virtue and religion that I have ever endeavoured to inculcate, have availed her nothing, and ſhe is fled at laſt with Glanville.—From her infancy I have laboured to prove my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a kind and indulgent father; and now when I meant to reap the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of my toil—behold, this is my reward!—but I myſelf have been the cauſe—I have given up too far,—but as ſhe had loſt her mother, and my notions of life were ſuppoſed to be too contracted, the opinions of others have weighed againſt me, and I have relaxed my own principles to her ruin.—I have got ſo far on my road to town, but can hear no tidings which way they took—nor is it needful for me to inquire—I am rather flying
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0363100400:186"/>
from myſelf than in purſuit of her—ſhe is for ever loſt—ſhe's ruined—ſhe fled, alas! with Glanville.—Had his intentions been honourable, whence this ſecrecy?—but nothing can excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate her—ſhe knew the depth of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery into which I ſhould be plunged, and, had ſhe thought of marriage, would have ſaved my deſperation.—Glanville would not marry her—he owns no ties of either honeſty or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour—he could violate all engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (if he made any) and the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated world would call it Gallantry.—All her principles were polluted—ſhe was deaf to ſhame, as well as virtue, who could dare to triumph thus over the weakneſs of a father's heart.—Delay not, my ſon, to ſeek—to inquire—to upbraid—it is too late, alas! to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0363100400:187"/>
recall,—and ſhould chance or fortune caſt her in your way—reproach her with her infamy—tell her that ſhe has violated her duty to herſelf—to me—and if there needs an aggravation of her crime—to her God—that no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance can obliterate the ſtain—that ſhe has pulled down ruin on herſelf and on her father, and that his tears will be drops of vengeance on her head for ever:—tell her—no, no, this may be too harſh,—tell her only that if ſhe would return—I could forgive her.</p>

                  <p>I Have now no hopes of ſeeing you before I leave town, for I have at laſt got ſome faint intelligence of your ſiſter, and ſhall ſet off immediately for Dover—ſhould ſhe have ſet ſail (for I hear he is carrying her to France) I ſhall then relinquiſh all purſuit, and leave her to the protection of that power that can amend her heart, and aſſuage my ſorrows—when you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me thus torn and diſtracted with my grief, harbour not a thought that your ſiſter was ever dearer to me than yourſelf—ſhe is loſt—and now awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens all my anxiety, <q rend="inline">"but thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine."</q>

                  <p>LET thoſe only talk of bearing up againſt afflictions, who have never felt them—there may be ſuch ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that no principles can fortify the mind againſt, and under which the greateſt and the beſt muſt ever fall—into ſuch a one is your unhappy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plunged.—I purſued my journey ſo much faſter than I expected, (for man neither knows his weakneſs nor his ſtrength) that I thought by night I ſhould even reach Dover, but gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no tidings, I began to ſink under my fatigue, and to hope only from time for that aid which philoſophy could not afford me.—As I was paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through a ſmall village, I ſaw all the people running out with unfeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0363100400:190"/>
curioſity after a poor wretch, who they told me was falling into labour—the officers, I found, were perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her, to ſave expences, to the next pariſh, and had refuſed her not only harbour, but relief—no ſituation can diſpenſe with our humanity—I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, therefore, to allot ſome few ſhillings to ſuccour, at leaſt, if not to ſave this victim of diſtreſs;—as I came nearer the rabble ſtopped, and, for a while, I even forgot my own miſeries to contemplate hers—I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed againſt their cruelty in the bittereſt terms—broke through the crowd, and inſiſted on their affording her ſome relief—they told me <q rend="inline">"there was no occaſion, for the woman en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated only for to die"</q>—I demanded that they ſhould convey her to the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0363100400:191"/>
next ale-houſe,—that I would leave my watch—my money;—my aid to carry her into it, alas! I was unable to give, for ſhe was now from agonies, become an object too ſhocking for humanity to behold;—I was, at length, reſponſible for her charges, and the crowd were indifferent to her diſtreſs.—As ſoon as they had borne her in, I entreated her to take comfort—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed her miſeries—aſſured her, that if either by leaving my watch or ſome money, I could procure her cordial medicine or aſſiſtance, I would relieve her—ſhe looked up wiſtfully in my face, and told me ſhe wiſhed me only to forgive.—Think, my deareſt Charles, what muſt be my feelings, when I found this object of miſery to be no other than my poor unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0363100400:192"/>
daughter, whom that villain Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville had thus baſely deſerted—for a while, I fear, I was unable to yield that aſſiſtance as a father, that ſhe would have found from me as a friend;—but recovering my tranquillity—I aſſured her that all reſentments were loſt in her diſtreſs; that I had even forgot ſhe had offended me, and that if ſhe could recover—<q rend="inline">"Alas! ſays ſhe, it is now too late, for I have languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whole days from want—without friend—without money—and without that comfort that innocence could have afforded me;"</q> but that to ſee me once again was more than her fondeſt wiſhes ever formed; nor had ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other hope than by the bleſſing of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to look up for the forgiveneſs of her God."—But here I pauſe, for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0363100400:193"/>
the ſcene became too affecting, and I believe I was carried away from her before death put a period to her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs.—Fondly bewailing her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely fate, I ſit by her faded corſe, and ſhed the tender tribute of unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tears—thinking that I ſtill ſee her only as aſleep—that I ſhall again enjoy the ſweets of her converſe, and that we ſhall again be happy—happy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, we may be in another world, but never more in this—but I bluſh to refer myſelf only to futurity, when on earth I can feel no more comfort—Oh! Charles, think not that I mean to vindicate wrong, or that my fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs gets the better of my principles—I know her errors, but will not, with a malicious world, think this the only fault that a woman can never
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0363100400:194"/>
expiate—it is not, believe me, an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror at the crime, but the pride of life that begets theſe diſtinctions. Let the cold, the ſelfiſh, and the unfriendly ſpeak rigidly of her offences, a father could feel only for her diſtreſs.—When this firſt burſt of my grief be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſubſide, I ſhall endeavour to take ſome meaſures for her removal; for at all adventures I reſolve to bury her at Marleſton, not with thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, perhaps, as if adorned with virtue; yet, nevertheleſs, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency that is due to the unfortunate; and leſt <q rend="inline">"ill tongues ſhould hereafter be too buſy with her fame"</q> I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſomething like the following epitaph upon her tomb—<q>
