            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is with great Pleaſure I ſee at laſt the Preſervation of Children become the Care of Men of Senſe: It is certainly a Matter that well deſerves their Attention, and, I doubt not, the Publick will ſoon find the good and great Effects of it, The <hi>Foundling Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> may be of more Uſe to the World, than was perhaps at firſt imagin'd by the Promoters of it; it will be a Means not only of preventing the Murder of many, but of ſaving more, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing a more reaſonable and more natural Method of Nurſing. In my Opinion, this Buſineſs has been too long fatally left to the Management of Women, who cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have proper Knowledge to fit them for ſuch a Taſk, notwithſtanding they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to be their own Province. What I mean, is a Philoſophic Knowledge of Nature, to be acquired only by learned Obſervation and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and which therefore the Unlearned muſt be incapable of. They may preſume upon the Examples and tranſmitted Cuſtoms of their Great Grand-mothers, who were taught by the Phyſicians of their unenlighten'd Days; when Phyſicians, as appears by late Diſcoveries, were miſtaken in many things; being led away be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0164601100:3"/>hypothetical Reaſonings to entertain very wild Conceits, in which they were greatly bewilder'd themſelves, and miſled others to believe, I know not what ſtrange unaccountable Powers in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Herbs, Roots, and Drugs; and alſo in ſome ſuperſtitious Practices and Ceremonies; for all which Notions, there being no real Foundation in Nature, they ought to be looked upon as the Effects of Ignorance, or the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of deſigning Quacks; who found their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, by pretending to great Knowledge in theſe occult Qualities, and impoſing upon the Credulous. The Art of Phyſick has been much improv'd within this laſt Century; by obſerving and following Nature more cloſely, many uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſcoveries have been made, which help us to account for Things in a natural Way, that before ſeem'd myſterious and magical; and which have conſequently made the Practice of it more conformable to Reaſon and good Senſe. This being the Caſe, there is great room to fear, that thoſe Nurſes who yet retain many of theſe traditional Prejudices, are capitally mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in their Management of Children in general and, fancying that Nature has left a great deal to their Skill and Contrivance, often do much harm, where they intend to do good. Of this I ſhall endeavour to convince them, by ſhewing, how I think Children may be cloath'd, fed, and managed with much leſs Trouble to their Nurſes, and infinitely greater Eaſe and Comfort to the little ones.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0164601100:4"/>
            <p>THE Foundlings under the Care of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital, I preſume, will be bred in a very plain, ſimple Manner: They will therefore infallibly have the more Health, Beauty, Strength, and Spirits; I might add Underſtanding too, as all the Faculties of the Mind are well known to depend upon the Organs of the Body; ſo that when theſe are in good Order, the thinking Part is moſt alert and active; the contrary, when they are diſturbed or diſeaſed. When theſe Advantages appear in Favour of Children ſo brought up, as I am confident in time they will, it may ſerve to convince moſt Nurſes, Aunts, Grand-mothers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how much they have hitherto been in the wrong, what Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is done to Children, and what Multitudes are deſtroyed or ſpoiled, as well by cramming them with Cakes, Sweetmeats, &amp;c. till they foul their Blood, choak their Veſſels, pall the Appetite, and ruin every Faculty of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; as by cockering and indulging them, to the utter Perverſion of their naturally good Temper, till they become quite froward and indocile.</p>
            <p>WHEN a Man takes upon him to contradict received Opinions and Prejudices ſanctified by Time, it is expected he ſhould bring valid Proof of what he advances. The Truth of what I ſay, that the Treatment of Children in general is wrong, unreaſonable and unnatural, will in great meaſure appear, if we but conſider what a puny valetudinary Race moſt of our People of Condition are; chiefly owing to bad
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0164601100:5"/>Nurſing, and bad Habits contracted early. But let any one, who would be fully convinced of this Matter, look over the Bills of Mortality; there he may obſerve, that almoſt Half the Number of thoſe, who fill up that black Liſt, die under five Years of Age: So that Half the People that come into the World, go out of it again before they become of the leaſt Uſe to it, or themſelves. To me, this ſeems to deſerve ſerious Conſideration; and yet I cannot find, that any one Man of Senſe, and publick Spirit, has ever attended to it at all; notwithſtanding the Maxim in every one's Mouth, that a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Inhabitants is the greateſt Strength and beſt Support of a Commonwealth. The Miſconduct, to which I muſt impute a great Part of the Calamity, is too common and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to engage the Idle and Speculative, who are to be caught only by very refined Reſearches; and the buſy Part of Mankind, where their immediate Intereſt is not concerned, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways overlook what they ſee daily: It may be thought a natural Evil, and ſo is ſubmitted to without Examination. But this is by no means the Caſe; and where it is entirely owing to Miſmanagement, and poſſibly may admit of a Remedy, it is ridiculous to charge it upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſuppoſe, that Infants are more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Diſeaſe and Death than grown Perſons; on the contrary, they bear Pain and Diſeaſe much better, Fevers eſpecially, (as is plain in the Caſe of the Small-Pox, generally moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to Children) and for the ſame Reaſon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0164601100:6"/>that a Twig is leſs hurt by a Storm than an Oak. In all the other Productions of Nature we ſee the greateſt Vigor and Luxuriancy of Health, the nearer they are to the Egg or the Bud: They are indeed then moſt ſenſible of Injury, and it is Injury only that deſtroys them. When was there a Lamb, a Bird, or a Tree that died becauſe it was young? Theſe are under the immediate Nurſing of unerring Nature, and they thrive accordingly. Ought it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be the Care of every Nurſe and every Parent, not only to protect their Nurſelings from Injury, but to be well aſſured that their own officious Services be not the greateſt the helpleſs Creatures can ſuffer?</p>
            <p>IN the lower Claſs of Mankind, eſpecially in the Country, Diſeaſe and Mortality are not ſo frequent, either among the Adult, or their Children. Health and Poſterity are the Portion of the Poor, I mean the laborious: The Want of Superfluity confines them more within the Limits of Nature: Hence they enjoy Bleſſings they feel not, and are ignorant of their Cauſe. The Mother who has only a few Rags to cover her Child looſely, and little more than her own Breaſt to feed it, ſees it healthy and ſtrong, and very ſoon able to ſhift for itſelf; while the puny Infect, the Heir and Hope of a rich Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily lies languſhing under a Load of Finery, that overpowers his Limbs, abhorring and rejecting the Dainties he is crammed with, till he dies a Victim to the miſtaken Care and Tenderneſs of his fond Mother. In the Courſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0164601100:7"/>of my Practice I have had frequent occaſion to be fully ſatisfied of this, and have often heard a Mother anxiouſly ſay <hi>the Child has not been well ever ſince it has done puking and crying.</hi> Theſe Complaints, tho' not attended to, point very plainly to their Cauſe. Is it not very evident, that when a Child rids its Stomach ſeveral times in a Day, that it has been over-loaded? when it cries, from the Incumbrance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of its Cloaths, that it is hurt by them? While the natural Strength laſts (as every Child is born with more Health and Strength than is generally imagined) it cries at, or rejects the ſuperfluous Load, and thrives apace: that is, grows very fat, bloted, and diſtended beyond meaſure; like a Houſe-Lamb. But in Time, the ſame oppreſſive Cauſe continuing, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Powers are overcome, being no longer able to throw off the unequal Weight; the Child, now not able to cry any more, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes and is quiet. The Misfortune is, theſe Complaints are not underſtood; it is ſwadled and cramm'd on, 'till after Gripes, Purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it ſinks under both Burdens into a Convulſion Fit, and eſcapes any further Torture. This would be the Caſe with the Lamb, was it not killed when it is full fat.</p>
            <p>THAT the preſent Method of Nurſing is wrong, one would think needed no other Proof than the frequent Miſcarriages attending it, the Death of Many, and ill Health of Thoſe that ſurvive. But the perſuading you of it may be a needleſs Taſk; if you have ever thought about
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0164601100:8"/>it, I doubt not but you are already convinced it is ſo. However, ſince you deſire my Sentiments upon the Subject, taking it for granted you think with me, that moſt of our Nurſes are got into a wrong Method, I will endeavour, in as few Words as poſſible, to tell you what I think a right one.</p>
            <p>YOU perceive, Sir, by the Hints I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready dropp'd, what I am going to complain of is, that Children in general are over-cloath'd and over-fed, and fed and cloath'd improperly. To theſe Cauſes I impute almoſt all their Diſeaſes. But to be a little more explicit. The firſt great Miſtake is, that they think a new-born Infant cannot be kept too warm; from this Prejudice they load and bind it with Flannels, Wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Swaths, Stays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> commonly called Cloaths; which all together are almoſt equal to its own Weight; by which means a healthy Child in a Month's Time is made ſo tender and chilly, it cannot bear the external Air; and if, by any Accident of a Door or Window left careleſsly open too long, a refreſhing Breeze be admitted into the ſuffocating Atmoſphere of the Lying-in Bed-chamber, the Child and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſometimes catch irrecoverable Colds. But what is worſe than this, at the End of the Month, if things go on apparently well, this Hot-bed Plant is ſent out into the Country, to be rear'd in a leaky Houſe, that lets in Wind and Rain from every Quarter. Is it any Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Child never thrives afterwards? The Truth is, a new-born Child cannot well be too
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0164601100:9"/>cool and looſe in its Dreſs; it wants leſs Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than a grown Perſon, in proportion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is naturally warmer, as appears by the Thermometer; and would therefore bear the Cold of a Winter's Night, much better than any adult Perſon whatever. There are many Inſtances both ancient and modern of Infants expoſed and deſerted, that have lived ſeveral Days. As it was the Practice of ancient Times, in many Parts of the World, to expoſe all thoſe, whom the Parents did not care to be encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd with; that were deformed or born under evil Stars: not to mention the many Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings pick'd up in <hi>London</hi> Streets. Theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may ſerve to ſhew, that Nature has made Children able to bear even great Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, before they are made weak and ſickly by their miſtaken Nurſes. But beſides the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief ariſing from the Weight and Heat of theſe Swaddling-cloaths, they are put on ſo tight, and the Child is ſo cramp'd by them, that its Bowels have not Room, nor the Limbs any Liberty, to act and exert themſelves in the free eaſy manner they ought. This is a very hurtful Circumſtance, for Limbs that are not uſed, will never be ſtrong, and ſuch tender Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies cannot bear much Preſſure: The Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation reſtrained by the Compreſſion of any one Part, muſt produce unnatural Swellings in ſome other; eſpecially as the Fibres of Infants are ſo eaſily diſtended. To which doubtleſs are owing the many Diſtortions and Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities we meet with every where; chiefly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0164601100:10"/>among Women, who ſuffer more in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular than the Men. I would recommend the following Dreſs: A little Flannel Waiſtcoat without Sleeves, made to fit the Body, and tie looſely behind; to which there ſhould be a Petticoat ſew'd, and over this a kind of Gown of the ſame Material, or any other that is light, thin and flimſy. The Petticoat ſhould not be quite ſo long as the Child, the Gown a few Inches longer; with one Cap only on the Head, which may be made double, if it be thought not warm enough. What I mean is, that the whole Coiffure ſhould be ſo contrived, that it might be put on at once, and neither bind nor preſs the Head at all: The Linnen as uſual. This, I think would be abundantly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the Day; laying aſide all thoſe Swathes, Bandages, Stays, and Contrivances, that are moſt ridiculouſly uſed to cloſe and keep the Head in its Place, and ſupport the Body. As if Nature, exact Nature, had produced her chief Work, a human Creature, ſo careleſsly unfiniſh'd, as to want thoſe idle Aids to make it perfect. Shoes and Stockings are very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Incumbrances, beſides that they keep the Legs wet and naſty, if they are not changed every Hour, and often cramp and hurt the Feet: A Child would ſtand firmer, and learn to walk much ſooner without them. I think they cannot be neceſſary 'till it runs out in the Dirt. There ſhould be a thin Flannel Shirt for the Night, which ought to be every way quite looſe. Children in this ſimple, pleaſant Dreſs,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0164601100:11"/>which may be readily put on and off without teazing them, would find themſelves perfectly eaſy and happy, enjoying the free Uſe of their Limbs and Faculties, which they would very ſoon begin to employ, when they are thus left at Liberty. I would have them put into it as ſoon as they are born, and continued in it, till they are three Years old; when it may be changed for any other more genteel and faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: tho' I could wiſh it was not the Cuſtom to wear Stays at all; not becauſe I ſee no Beauty in the Sugarloaf Shape, but that I am apprehenſive, it is often procur'd at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Health and Strength of the Body. There is an odd Notion enough entertained about Change, and the keeping of Children clean. Some imagine that clean Linnen and freſh Cloaths draw, and rob them of their nouriſhing Juices. I cannot ſee that they do any thing more than imbibe a little of that Moiſture which their Bodies exhale. Were it as is ſuppoſed, it would be of Service to them; ſince they are always too abundantly ſupplied, and therefore I think they cannot be changed too often, and would have them clean every Day; as it would free them from Stinks and Sourneſſes, which are not only offenſive, but very prejudicial to the tender State of Infancy.</p>
            <p>THE Feeding of Children properly is of much greater Importance to them than their Cloathing. We ought to take great Care to be right in this material Article, and that nothing be given them, but what is wholeſome and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0164601100:12"/>good for them, and in ſuch Quantity, as the Body calls for towards its Support and Growth; not a Grain more. Let us conſider what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture directs in the Caſe: If we follow Nature, inſtead of leading or driving it, we cannot err. In the Buſineſs of Nurſing, as well as Phyſick, Art is ever deſtructive, if it does not exactly copy this Original. When a Child is firſt born, there ſeems to be no Proviſion at all made for it; for the Mother's Milk ſeldom comes till the third Day; ſo that according to Nature, a Child would be left a Day and a half, or two Days, without any Food; to me a very ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Proof that it wants none: It is born full of Blood, full of Excrements, its Appetites not awake, nor its Senſes opened; and requires this intermediate Time of Abſtinence and Reſt, to compoſe and recover the Struggle of the Birth, and the Change of Circulation, (the Blood run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into new Channels,) which always put it into a little Fever. However extraordinary this may appear, I am ſure it is better it were not fed at all; for it ſleeps almoſt the whole Time, and when the Milk is ready for it, would be hungry, and ſuck with more Eagerneſs; which is often neceſſary, for it ſeldom comes freely at firſt. At leaſt I would prevail thus far, that the Child be not awaked out of its Sleep to be fed, as is commonly done. This is the conſtant Courſe of Nature, which is very little attended to, and never followed. The general Practice is, as ſoon as a Child is born, to cram a Dab of Butter and Sugar down its
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0164601100:13"/>Throat, a little Oil, Panada, Caudle, or ſome ſuch unwholſome Meſs. So that they ſet out wrong, and the Child ſtands a fair Chance of being made ſick from the firſt Hour. It is the Cuſtom of ſome to give a little roaſt Pig to an Infant; which it ſeems, is to cure it of all the Mother's Longings. I wiſh theſe Matters were a little more enquired into, for the Honour of the Sex; to which many Imperfections of this kind are imputed, which I am ſure it does not lie under. When a Child ſucks its own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which, with a very few Exceptions, would be beſt for every Child, and every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Nature has provided it with ſuch whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſuitable Nouriſhment; ſuppoſing her a temperate Woman, that makes ſome Uſe of her Limbs; it can hardly do amiſs. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would likewiſe, in moſt hyſterical, ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Caſes, eſtabliſh her own Health by it, tho' ſhe were weak and ſickly before, as well as that of her Offspring. For theſe Reaſons I could wiſh, that every Woman that is able, whoſe Fountains are not greatly diſturbed or tainted, would give Suck to her Child. I am very ſure that forcing back the Milk, which moſt young Women muſt have in great abundance, may be of fatal Conſequence: Sometimes it endangers Life, and often lays the Foundation of many incurable Diſeaſes. The Reaſons that are given for this Practice are very frivolous, and drawn from falſe Premiſes; that ſome Women are too weak to bear ſuch a Drain, which would rob them of their own Nouriſhment. This is a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0164601100:14"/>very miſtaken Notion; for the firſt general Cauſe of moſt People's Diſeaſes is, not Want of Nouriſhment, as is here imagined, but too great a Fulneſs and Redundancy of Humours; good at firſt, but being more than the Body can employ or conſume, the whole Maſs becomes corrupt, and produces many Diſeaſes. This is confirmed by the general Practice of Phyſicians, who make holes in the Skin, perpetual Bliſters, Iſſues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to let out the Superfluity. I would therefore leave it to be conſider'd, whether the throwing back ſuch a Load of Humour, as a Woman's firſt Milk, be moſt likely to mend her Conſtitution, or make her Complaints irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediable. The Mother's firſt Milk is purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and cleanſes the Child of its long hoarded Excrement; no Child therefore can be deprived of it without manifeſt Injury. By degrees it changes its Property, becomes leſs purgative, and more nouriſhing; and is the beſt and only Food the Child likes, or ought to have for ſome time. If I could prevail, no Child ſhould ever be cramm'd with any unnatural Mixture, 'till the Proviſion of Nature was ready for it; nor afterwards fed with any ungenial alien Diet whatever, the <hi>firſt three Months:</hi> for it is not well able to digeſt and aſſimilate other Aliments ſooner. There is uſually Milk enough with the firſt Child; ſometimes more than it can take: It is poured forth from an exuberant, overflowing Urn, by a bountiful Hand, that never provides ſparingly. The Call of Nature ſhould be waited for to feed it with any thing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0164601100:15"/>more ſubſtantial, and the Appetite ever precede the Food; not only with regard to the daily Meals, but thoſe Changes of Diet, which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, increaſing Life requires. But this is never done in either Caſe, which is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Miſtakes of all Nurſes. Thus far Nature, if ſhe be not interrupted, will do the whole Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs perfectly well; and there ſeems to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left for a Nurſe to do, but to keep the Child clean and ſweet, and to tumble and toſs it about a good deal, play with it, and keep it in good Humour.</p>
            <p>BUT now the Child (I mean when it is about three Months old) requires more ſolid Suſtenance, we are to enquire what, and how much, is moſt proper to give it. We may be well aſſured, there is a great Miſtake either in the Quantity or Quality of Childrens Food, or both, as it is uſually given them; becauſe they are made ſick by it. As to Quantity, there is a moſt ridiculous Error in the common Practice; for it is generally ſuppoſed, that whenever a Child cries, it wants Victuals; and it is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fed, ten, twelve, or more times in a Day and Night. This is ſo obvious a Miſapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that I am ſurprized it ſhould ever prevail. If a Child's Wants and Motions be diligently and judiciouſly attended to, it will be found that it never cries but from Pain: Now the firſt Senſations of Hunger are not attended with Pain; accordingly a Child (I mean this of a very young one) that is hungry, will make a hundred other Signs of its Want, before it will
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0164601100:16"/>cry for Food. If it be healthy and quite eaſy in its Dreſs, it will hardly ever cry at all. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe Signs and Motions, I ſpeak of, are but rarely to be obſerved; becauſe it ſeldom happens that Children are ever ſuffered to be hungry. In a few, very few, whom I have had the Pleaſure to ſee reaſonably nurſed, that were not fed above two or three times in four and twenty Hours, and yet were perfectly healthy, active and happy; I have ſeen theſe Signals, which were as intelligible as if they had ſpoke.</p>
            <p>THERE are many Faults in the Quality of their Food; It is not ſimple enough. Their Paps, Panada's, Gruels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are generally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with Sugar, Spice, and ſometimes a Drop of Wine; neither of which they ought ever to taſte. Our Bodies never want them: they are what Luxury only has introduced, to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Health of Mankind. It is not enough that their Food be ſimple, it ſhould be alſo light. Several People, I find, are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their Notions of what is light; and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that moſt kinds of Paſtry, Puddings, Cuſtards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are light, that is, light of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. But there is nothing heavier in this Senſe than unfermented Flour and Eggs boil'd hard, which are the chief Ingredients of thoſe Preparations. What I mean by light, to give the beſt Idea I can of it, is any Subſtance that is eaſily ſeparated, and ſoluble in warm Water. Good Bread is the lighteſt thing I know; the Power of due Fermentation, in which conſiſts
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0164601100:17"/>the whole Art of making it, breaks and attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the tenacious Particles of the Flour, ſo as to give it theſe Qualities I mention, and make it the fitteſt Food for young Children. Cows Milk is alſo ſimple and light, and very good for them; but it is injudiciouſly prepared: it ſhould not be boiled, for boiling alters the Taſte and Property of it, deſtroys its Sweetneſs, and makes it thicker, heavier, and leſs fit to mix and aſſimilate with the Blood. But the chief Objection is, that their Food is wholly vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; the bad Conſequence of which is, that it will turn ſour in their Stomachs. The firſt and general Cauſe of all the Diſeaſes of Infants, is manifeſtly this aceſcent Quality of all their Food. If any of theſe vegetable Preparations I have named, be kept in a Degree of Heat equal to that of a Child's Stomach it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſour as Vinegar in a few Hours time. Theſe Things are therefore very improper to feed a Child wholly with. Some Part of its Diet ſhould be contrived to have a contrary Tendency; ſuch as we find only in Fleſh, which is the direct oppoſite to Acid, and tends to Putrefaction. In a due Mixture of theſe two Extremes, correcting each other, conſiſts that Salubrity of Aliment our Nature ſeems to require. As we are partly carniverous Animals, a Child ought not to be fed wholly upon Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables. The Mother's Milk, when it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good, ſeems to be this true Mixture of the animal and vegetable Properties, that agrees beſt with the Conſtitution of a Child; readily
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0164601100:18"/>paſſes into good Blood, requiring but a gentle Exertion of the Powers of Circulation to break and ſubdue its Particles and make them ſmooth and round, and eaſily diviſible. I would adviſe therefore, that one half of Infants Diet be thin light Broths, with a little Bread or Rice boiled in them; which laſt is not ſo aſceſcent as any other kind of Meal or Flour. Theſe Broths ſhould be made with the Fleſh of full grown Animals, becauſe their Juices are more ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate; eſpecially if they had never been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to be fatted. The Juices of a young Ox, taken from the Plough, make the fineſt fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd and moſt wholſome Soup. I believe it is for the ſame Reaſon, the Fleſh of all wild Animals has a lighter Taſte than that of tame, ſaginated ones; and is therefore moſt agreeable to the Palates of the Luxurious; but this is to be underſtood of thoſe Creatures that feed on Corn or Herbage. The other Part of Childrens Diet may be a little Bread and Water boiled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dry, and then mixed with freſh Milk, not boiled. This, without Sugar, Spice, or any other pretended Amendment whatever, would be perfectly light and wholſome, of ſufficient Nouriſhment, ſomething like Milk from the Cow, with the additional Strength and Spirit of Bread in it. Twice a Day, and not oftener, a ſucking Child ſhould be fed at firſt; once with the Broth, and once with the Milk thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. As to the Quantity at each Time, its Appetite muſt be the Meaſure of that; its
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0164601100:19"/>Hunger ſhould be ſatisfied, but no more; for Children will always eat with ſome Eagerneſs full as much as they ought: Therefore it muſt be very wrong to go beyond that, and ſtuff them till they ſpue, as the common Method is. They ſhould not be laid on their Backs to be fed, but held in a ſitting Poſture, that ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing may be eaſier to them, and that they may the more readily diſcover when they have had enough. When they come to be about <hi>ſix Months</hi> old, and their Appetite and Digeſtion grows ſtrong, they may be fed three times a Day; which I think they ought never to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their whole Lives after. By Night I would not have them fed or ſuckled at all, that they might at leaſt be hungry in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is this Night-feeding that makes them ſo over-fat and bloated. If they be not uſed to it at firſt, and perhaps awaked on purpoſe, they will never ſeek it; and if they are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed from the Birth, in a Week's time they will get into a Habit of ſleeping all, or moſt part of the Night very quietly; awaking poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly once or twice for a few Minutes, when they are wet and ought to be changed. If it be thought neceſſary to give them any thing between Meals, a little Milk and Water is beſt. Their Meals, and in my Opinion their ſucking too, ought to be at ſtated Times, and the ſame every Day; that the Stomach may have Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals to digeſt, and the Appetite return. The Child would ſoon be quite eaſy and ſatisfied in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0164601100:20"/>the Habit; much more ſo, than when taught to expect Food at all times, and at every little Fit of Crying and Uneaſineſs. Let this Method be obſerved about a <hi>Twelvemonth,</hi> when, and not before, they may be weaned; not all at once, but by inſenſible Degrees; that they may neither feel, nor fret at the want of the Breaſt. This might be very eaſily manag'd, if they were ſuffer'd to ſuck only at certain Times. If this Plan of Nurſing were literally purſued, the Children kept clean and ſweet, tumbled and toſs'd about a good deal, and carried out every Day in all Weathers; I am confident, that in ſix or eight Months time moſt Children would become healthy and ſtrong, would be able to fit up on the Ground without Support, to divert themſelves an Hour at a time, to the great Relief of their Nurſes, would readily find the uſe of their Legs, and very ſoon ſhift for themſelves.</p>
            <p>IF it be aſked whether I mean this of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in general, and that weakly Ones born of unhealthy Parents ſhould be treated in the ſame Manner; I anſwer, that it is not ſo common for Children to inherit the Diſeaſes of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as is generally imagined; there is much vulgar Error in this Opinion; for People that are very unhealthy ſeldom have Children, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the bad Health be of the female Side; and it is generally late in Life when chronick Diſeaſes take place in moſt Men, when the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Love is pretty well over: Certainly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0164601100:21"/>Children can have no Title to thoſe Infirmities, which their Parents have acquired by Indolence and Intemperance long after their Birth. It is not common for People to complain of Ails they think hereditary, till they are grown up; that is, till they have contributed to them by their own Irregularities and Exceſſes, and then are glad to throw their own Faults back upon their Parents; and lament a bad Conſtitution, when they have ſpoiled a very good one. It is very ſeldom that young Children are troubled with Family Diſtempers: Indeed, when we find them affected with ſcrophulous, venereal, or high ſcorbutick Complaints, we may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably conclude the Taint to have been traſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them; but theſe Caſes are very rare, in Compariſon of the many others that are falſly, and without the leaſt Foundation, imputed to Parents, when the real Cauſe is either in the Complainants themſelves, or bad Nurſing, that has fixed them early in wrong Habits. In one Senſe many Diſeaſes may be ſaid to be heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, perhaps all thoſe of male Formation; by which I mean not only Deformity and Diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but all thoſe Caſes where the Fibres and Veſſels of one Part are weaker in Proportion than the reſt; ſo that upon any Strain of the Body, whether of Debauch or too violent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, the weak Part fails firſt, and diſorders the whole. Thus Complaints may be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſimilar to thoſe of the Parent, owing in ſome meaſure to the Similitude of Parts, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0164601100:22"/>poſſibly is inherited, like the Features of the Face; but yet theſe Diſeaſes might never have appeared, but for the immediate acting Cauſe, the Violence done to the Body. Moſt Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers have two Cauſes; the one, a particular State of the Solids and Fluids of the Body, which diſpoſe it to receive certain Infections and Impulſes; the other, the Infection or Impulſe itſelf. Now what I contend for is, that tho' this prediſponent State or Habit of the Body be heritable, yet the Diſeaſes incident to theſe wretched Heirs may be avoided, by preventing the active Cauſe; which may be done in many Caſes by a due Attention to the Non-naturals, as they are called; in plainer Words, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, temperate Life: in Children, by good Nurſing. Therefore I conclude, that inſtead of indulging and enfeebling yet more, by the common Methods, Children ſo unhappily born; that which I am recommending, together with the wholſome Milk of a healthy Nurſe, is the beſt, the only Means to remedy the Evil, and by which alone they may by degrees be made healthy and ſtrong. And thus, in a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or two of reaſonable, temperate Perſons, every Taint and Infirmity whatever, the King's Evil, and Madneſs not excepted, would be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wore out.</p>
            <p>THE plain natural Plan I have laid down, is never followed; becauſe moſt Mothers, of any Condition, either cannot, or will not undertake the troubleſome Taſk of ſuckling their own
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0164601100:23"/>Children; which is troubleſome only for want of proper Method; were it rightly managed, there would be much Pleaſure in it, to every Woman that can prevail upon herſelf to give up a little of the Beauty of her Breaſt to feed her Offspring. There would be no fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Huſband's Ears with the Noiſe of the ſqualling Brat. The Child, was it nurs'd in this Way, would be always quiet, in good Humour, ever playing, laughing, or ſleeping. In my Opinion, a Man of Senſe cannot have a prettier Rattle (for Rattles he muſt have of one kind or other) than ſuch a young Child. I am quite at a loſs to account for the general Practice of ſending Infants out of Doors, to be ſuckled, or dry-nurſed by another Woman, who has not ſo much Underſtanding, nor can have ſo much Affection for it, as the Parents; and how it comes to paſs, that People of good Senſe and eaſy Circumſtances will not give themſelves the Pains to watch over the Health and Welfare of their Children; that poſſibly would take much more with a Shrub or a Flower; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as the Love of Poſterity is ſo natural to Mankind. I would earneſtly recommend it to every Father to have his Child nurſed under his own Eye, to make uſe of his own Reaſon and Senſe in ſuperintending and directing the Management of it; nor ſuffer it to be made one of the Myſteries of the <hi>Bona Dea,</hi> from which the Men are to be excluded. I would adviſe every Mother that can, for her own ſake,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0164601100:24"/>as well as her Child's, to ſuckle it. If ſhe be a healthy Woman, it will confirm her Health; if weakly, in moſt Caſes it will reſtore her. It need be no Confinement to her, or Abridgment of her Time: Four times in four and twenty Hours will be often enough to give it Suck; letting it have as much as it will take, out of both Breaſts, at each time. It may be fed and dreſs'd by ſome handy, reaſonable Servant, that will ſubmit to be directed; whom likewiſe it may ſleep with. No other Woman's Milk can be ſo good for her Child; and dry-nurſing I look upon to be the moſt unnatural and dangerous Method of all; and, according to my Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not one in three ſurvives it. To breed a Child in this artificial Manner, requires more Knowledge of Nature, and the animal Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, than the beſt Nurſe was ever Miſtreſs of, as well as more Care and Attention than is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally beſtow'd on Children: the Skill of a good Phyſician would be neceſſary to manage it rightly. I am very glad this is not the Method of the Hoſpital: I believe there is not the leaſt Colour of Objection to any Part of the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that moſt uſeful and excellent Charity, as far as it depends upon the Directors of it. Sending the Children out to Country Nurſes, under the Care of Inſpectors, is undoubtedly the beſt Method they could take; but how far theſe Nurſes and their Inſpectors (who, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, are to be ſome good Gentlewomen in the Neighbourhood) may be perſuaded out of their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0164601100:25"/>old Forms, to treat their Nurſelings a little more reaſonably, is matter of much Doubt. I fear they will be too tenacious of their Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as well as opinionated of their Skill, to be eaſily convinced they are in the wrong; and who ſhall undertake the Taſk? However, I deſpair not of ſeeing a Reformation one Day or other; and to contribute to it as much as lies in my Power, I will give you my Opinion as to the Precautions, neceſſary to be taken, in the Choice of theſe Nurſes; and likewiſe a few Reaſons why the Children, entruſted to their Care, ſhould be treated ſomewhat differently from thoſe, who are nurſed in a more natural Way, and ſuck their own Mothers. I make no doubt, but great Care is taken, that the Nurſes, recommended to the Hoſpital, be clean and healthy Women. But this is not enough, the Preference ſhould be given to the middle-aged; becauſe they will have more Milk than the very young, and more and better than the old. This is a material Conſideration, as, I ſuppoſe, they have each her own Child to ſuckle beſides. Thoſe between twenty and thirty are certainly of the beſt Age. But what I think of the utmoſt Conſequence is, that great Regard ſhould be had to the Time of their Lying-in, and thoſe procured, if poſſible, who have not been brought to-bed above two or three Months. The Reaſon of this is, that Nature intending a Child ſhould ſuck about a Twelvemonth, the Milk ſeldom continues good much longer.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0164601100:26"/>About that Time, Women in general, though they give Suck, are apt to breed again; ſome indeed, that are very ſanguine, will breed ſooner: theſe, notwithſtanding their Milk, are apt to be troubled with the <hi>Catamenia,</hi> which diſturb it greatly; and therefore are not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be made Nurſes of. But, whether they breed or not, it is my Opinion, that after a Year's Time, or thereabouts, however it may agree with a Child that has ſucked it from the firſt, their Milk will become ſtale and vapid, at leaſt very unfit for a new-born Infant; that if it be deprived of its own Mother's Milk, ought undoubtedly to have what is moſt like it: the newer it is, the more ſuitable in all reſpects to its tender Nature. Yet it is a common thing for a Woman to ſuckle two or three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſucceſſively with the ſame Milk.</p>
            <p>A NURSE ought to have great Regard to her Diet: It is not enough that ſhe be ſober and temperate, her Food ſhould conſiſt of a proper Mixture of Fleſh and Vegetables: She ſhould eat one hearty Meal of Fleſh-meat every Day, with a good deal of Garden Stuff, and Bread. Thin Broth or Milk would be beſt for her Breakfaſt and Supper. Her Drink ſhould be ſmall Beer, or Milk and Water; but upon no Account ſhould ſhe ever touch a drop of Wine or ſtrong Drink, much leſs any kind of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Liquors: Giving Ale or Brandy to a Nurſe is, in effect, giving it the Child; and it is eaſy to conclude what would be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0164601100:27"/>
            <p>THE Children likewiſe, thus ſent out, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a particular Treatment. The Plan I would lay down, could I prevail, ſhould be that of Nature, excluding Art and foreign Aid entirely. But when this is broke in upon, a little adventitious Skill becomes indiſpenſibly neceſſary; that if we are not perfectly right in following cloſely the Deſign of Nature, we may co-operate a little, and not be totally wrong in counter-acting it, as is too often the Caſe. What I mean is, that every Child, not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Mother's firſt Milk, whether it be dry-nurſed, or ſuckled by another Woman, ſhould be purged in a Day or two after the Birth; and this purging continued for ſome time; not by regular Doſes of Phyſick, that may operate all at once; but ſome lenient Laxative ſhould be contrived, and given two or three times a Day, ſo as to keep the Child's Body open for the firſt nine Days, or Fortnight; leſſening the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity inſenſibly, 'till it be left off. It ſhould be ſo managed, that the Operation of the artificial Phyſick may reſemble that of the natural. This is ſo material, that for want of it, moſt Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren within the firſt Month break out in Pimples all over; the Nurſes call it the red Gum, and look upon it to be a natural thing, and that the Children will be unhealthy that have it not. So indeed they will be in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood; and it is better that theſe Foulneſſes, which become acrid and hot by remaining too long in the Body, ſhould be diſcharged through
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0164601100:28"/>the Skin, than not at all; or that they ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d be lodged in the Blood, or fall upon the Vitals, to lay the Foundation of numberleſs future Evils: but it is chiefly owing to the Neglect of this Method at firſt. A Child that ſucks its own Mother, unleſs it be greatly over-fed, or kept too hot, will never be troubled with this Humour at all. If the Children that are brought to the Hoſpital be not above a Month old, and it be found, upon Enquiry, that they have not ſuck'd their own Mothers, ſomething of this kind preſcribed them would not be too late, nor improper. The following Form may be uſed: Take Manna, Pulp of Caſſia, of each half an ounce; diſſolve 'em in about three ounces of thin Broth. Let the Child take two ſpoonfuls three times a Day, varying the Quantity according to the Effect; which at firſt ought to be three or four Stools in four and twenty Hours.</p>
            <p>ORDERS ſhould be given theſe Nurſes to keep the Children awake by Day, as long as they are diſpoſed to be ſo, and to amuſe and keep them in good Humour all they can; not to lull and rock them to ſleep, or to continue their Sleep too long; which is only done to ſave their own Time and Trouble, to the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of the Childrens Health, Spirits, and Underſtanding. With regard to Feeding them, as it is not likely they ſhould have Milk enough to ſupport two, their own and the Hoſpital Child; it is beſt they ſhould begin immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the Method I have recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0164601100:29"/>if they or their Inſpectors can be perſuaded to think it right; which, however, I would not have underſtood ſo ſtrictly, but it might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be a little varied, preſerving only the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. I would adviſe, however, if it be thought proper, now and then to give them a little Bread and Butter; that the Butter be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſweet and freſh, and allowed but in very ſmall Quantity; otherwiſe it will be apt to turn bitter and rancid in the Stomach, and foul all the Juices of the Body. A Child might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed any kind of mellow Fruit, either raw, ſtewed, or baked; Roots of all ſorts, and all the Produce of the Kitchen Garden. I am ſure all theſe things are wholſome and good for them, and every one elſe, notwithſtanding the idle Notion of their being windy, which they are only to very debauched Stomachs; and ſo is Milk: but no Man's Blood wants the cleanſing, refreſhing Power of Milk more than his, whoſe Stomach, uſed to inflammatory things of high Reliſh, will not bear the firſt Chill of it. To Children, all this kind of Food, taken in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, is perfectly grateful and ſalutary. Some may think that they carry into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach the Eggs of future Worms; but of this I am not very apprehenſive: for I believe there are few things we eat or drink, that do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey them. But then they can never be hatch'd in a healthy Inſide, where all the Juices are ſweet and good, and every Gland performs its Office; the Gall in particular would deſtroy
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0164601100:30"/>them: Bullocks Gall has been found to be a good and ſafe Vermifuge. It is my Opinion, we ſwallow the Eggs of many little Animals, that are never brought into Life within us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept where they find a fit Neſt or Lodgment in the acid Phlegm, or vitiated Humours of the Stomach and Bowels. Were theſe totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged every Day, and the Food of yeſterday employed or thrown off to the laſt Grain, no Worms could ever harbour in our Vitals. As ſoon as the Children have any Teeth, at ſix or eight Months they may by degrees be uſed to a little Fleſh-meat; which they are always very fond of, much more ſo at firſt, than of any Confectionary or Paſtry Wares, with which they ſhould never debauch their Taſte.</p>
            <p>BREEDING Teeth has been thought to be, and is, fatal to many Children; but I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident this is not from Nature: for it is no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, or we could not be well in Health 'till one or two and twenty, or later. Teeth are breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt Part of that Time; and it is my Opinion, the laſt Teeth give more Pain than the firſt, as the Bones and Gums, they are to pierce, are grown more firm and hard. But whatever Fever, Fits, or other dangerous Symptoms ſeem to attend this Operation of Nature, healthy Children have ſometimes bred their Teeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch bad Attendants; which ought to incline us to ſuſpect the Evil not to be natural, but rather the Effect of too great a Fulneſs, or the corrupt Humours of the Body put into Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0164601100:31"/>by the ſtimulating Pain the Tooth cauſes in breaking its way out. This, I believe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happens without ſome Pain, and poſſibly a little Fever; but if the Blood and Juices be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſweet and good, and there be not too great a Redundancy of them, both will be but ſlight, and paſs off imperceptibly, without any bad Conſequence whatever. The chief Intention of the Method I am recommending is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Humours of the Body in this State; and therefore if it ſucceeds, Children ſo mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged will breed their Teeth with leſs Pain and Danger than are commonly obſerved to attend this Work of Nature.</p>
            <p>As I have ſaid that the firſt and general Cauſe of moſt of the Diſeaſes Infants are liable to, is the acid Corruption of their Food; it may not be amiſs juſt to mention an eaſy and certain Remedy, or rather Preventive if given timely, at the firſt Appearance of predomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Acid; which is very obvious from the green Stools, Gripes, and Purgings occaſioned by it. The common Method, when theſe Symptoms appear, is to give the Pearl Julep, Crabs Eye, and the teſtaceous Powders, which, tho' they do abſorb the Acidities, have this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience in their Effect, that they are apt to lodge in the Body, and bring on a Coſtiveneſs, very detrimental to Infants, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a little Manna, or ſome gentle Purge to be given frequently to carry them off. Inſtead of theſe, I would recommend a certain fine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0164601100:32"/>Powder, called <hi>Magneſia alba,</hi> which at the ſame time that it corrects and ſweetens all Sourneſſes, rather more effectually than the teſtaceous Powders, is likewiſe a lenient Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and keeps the Body gently open. This is the only alkaline Purge I know of, and which our Diſpenſatories have long wanted. I could wiſh it was more univerſally received among us, and think it well deſerves the Rank in our Books of Pharmacy, which it already has in ſome fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ones. I have taken it myſelf, and given it to others for the Heart-burn, and find it to be the beſt and moſt effectual Remedy for that Complaint. It may be given to Children from one to two drams a Day, a little at a time, in all their Food, 'till the Acidities be quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and the concomitant Symptoms diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear entirely. I have often given it with good and great Effect, even when the Children have been far gone in Diſeaſes firſt brought on by prevailing Acid.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſome other little Niceties that, were they obſerved in the nurſing of Children, would be of ſome Uſe to them; ſuch as putting them ſoon upon their Legs, in order to forward their walking; accuſtoming them to uſe both Hands alike; for employing one more than the other, will not only make the Hand and Arm ſo uſed, but alſo that Side of the Body, bigger than the other. This is ſometimes the Cauſe of Crookedneſs. It would likewiſe not be amiſs to forward their ſpeaking plain, by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plain diſtinct Words to them, inſtead of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0164601100:33"/>the Namby Pamby Stile, and giving them back their own broken inarticulate Attempts; by which Means, I believe, ſome Children ſcarcely ſpeak intelligibly at ſeven Years of Age. I think they cannot be made reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures too ſoon.</p>
            <p>THESE few looſe Thoughts on the Subject of Nurſing Children, I ſend you for your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Satisfaction, if they be lucky enough to give you any. I have neither Time nor Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to think of Form and Order, or ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by affected Demonſtrations taken from mechanical Principles and Powers. All I have endeavour'd is to be intelligible and uſeful; and therefore I have a voided, as much as poſſible, all Terms of Art; together with learned Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as often produced out of Vanity, and to ſhew deep Reading, as for the ſake of Proof. If you think it may be of any Uſe to publiſh this Letter, I am not unwilling it ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; if not, do with it what you pleaſe. I deliver it up as a <hi>Foundling</hi> to be diſpoſed of as you think proper. I ſhall only add by way of Perſuaſive to thoſe who may be inclined to make Trial of the Method I recommend, that I am a Father, and have already practiſed it with the moſt deſirable Succeſs.</p>
