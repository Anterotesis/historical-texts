            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>IN our Strictures on the Tragedy of <hi>Elvira,</hi> we ſhall not haſten all at once into the midſt of Things, according to the Rules of Epic Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; Heroic Poems and Remarks on New Plays, are things ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially different, that they ought not to be written by the ſame Rules.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1233500300:5"/>
Had Mr. <hi>Malloch</hi> been aware of theſe Diſtinctions in writing, which ſurely are not very nice, he probably would have diſcovered that Scenes admirably adapted for forming a Burleſque Tragedy, would never ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in forming a ſerious Drama. In the Prologue the Author informs us, that the Preliminaries of Peace are ſigned, and the War now over, and he humbly hopes, as we have ſpared the <hi>French,</hi> we will ſpare his Tragedy. But as the Principles of Reſtitution ſeem at preſent ſtrong in this Nation, before we extend our Mercy to him, we inſiſt that in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Superiors, he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore every thing valuable he has plunder'd from the <hi>French</hi> during the Courſe of his ſad and tedious Compoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1233500300:6"/>
In the firſt Scene of this Tragedy a Gentleman who has been abroad, during the Wars, requeſts his Friend to acquaint him with what has paſt at Court in the time of his Abſence. We were equally ſurprized and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with this new Method of informing the Spectators of the Tranſactions prior to the Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Play; nothing can be more natural, for we imagine the Art of conveying Letters by Poſt was at that time undiſcovered. We muſt indeed acknowledge, that dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time of the Roman Empire Letters were tranſmitted with the utmoſt Celerity from one Part to another of thoſe immenſe Domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions; but we alſo know, that after
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1233500300:7"/>
the Subverſion of that State by the Incurſions of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> the firſt Act of Cruelty committed by theſe Barbarians was murdering all the Poſt-Boys in cold Blood: In like manner as our inhuman <hi>Edward</hi> upon his compleating the Conqueſt of <hi>Wales,</hi> ordered all the Bards to be put to Death, amongſt the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of which had Mr. <hi>Malloch</hi> been included we had not now been tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with his execrable Tragedy. Novelty of the ſame kind with this we have mentioned runs thro' the whole Play, almoſt every Scene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Interview and a <hi>tête a tête.</hi> The King wants to ſee his Son, the Queen wants to ſee <hi>Elvira, Elvira</hi> wants to ſee the King, and ſo on thro' the Five Acts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1233500300:8"/>
No new Thoughts or Sentiments are to be found in this Performance, we meet only with old ones abſurdly expreſſed. <hi>Dryden</hi> ſaid that <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> was every where to be traced in the Snow of the Ancients. We may ſay that <hi>Malloch</hi> is every where to be traced in the Puddle of the Moderns. Inſtead of ſelecting the Beauties, he has pick'd out what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is deſpicable in <hi>Shakeſpeare, Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Dryden,</hi> and <hi>Rowe,</hi> like a Pick-Pocket who dives for Handkerchiefs, not for Gold; and contents himſelf with what he finds in our Great Coat Pocket, without attempting our Watch or your Purſe. Tho' Mr. <hi>Malloch</hi> may only mean to borrow, yet as he poſſeſſes no Fund of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1233500300:9"/>
Genius from whence he can pay his Debts, borrowing, we are afraid is an inadequate Expreſſion, the harſher one of ſtealing we muſt therefore, tho' reluctantly, ſubſtitute in its room. In the Prologue he acknowledges himſelf a Culprit, but as the Loſs of what he has pilfered is inſignificant to the Owners, we ſhall bring him in guilty only of Petty Larcenary: We believe he has been driven, like poor People in this ſevere Weather by dire Neceſſity, to ſuch diſhoneſt Shifts.</p>
            <p>In this Play the Author has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a Rebellion unparalleled in any Hiſtory, Ancient or Modern. He raiſes his Rebellions as a ſkilful Gardener does his Muſhrooms, in a Moment; and like an artful Nurſe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1233500300:10"/>
he lulls in a Moment the fretful Child aſleep. The Prince enters an Appartment of the Palace with a drawn Sword; this forms the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. The King enters the ſame Appartment without a drawn Sword. This quaſhes the Rebellion. How to credit this Story, or to pardon this poetical Licence, we are greatly at a Loſs; for we know in the Year 1745 three thouſand Mountaineers actually appeared at <hi>Derby. Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> we are credibly informed, had a Gang of at leaſt a Dozen ſtout Fellows; and it is pretty certain that <hi>Bedemar,</hi> when going to inſlave <hi>Venice,</hi> had provided Piſtols and Battle Powder for more than fifteen fighting Men. We are almoſt tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think, that Mr. <hi>Malloch</hi> gets his Rebellions ready made, like his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1233500300:11"/>
               <hi>Scotch</hi> Tobacco, cut and dry, at the Sign of the Valiant Highlander.</p>
            <p>Our great Author poſſeſſes, in its utmoſt Perfection, the happy Art of uniting rival Ladies, and of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at Variance a virtuous Father and Son. How intimate his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Human Nature! How deep his Knowledge of the Paſſions! No leſs exquiſite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in his Morality, like a true Diſciple of Lord <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> he unites Vice and Virtue moſt lovingly together; witneſs this memorable Line of the King's, addreſſed to <hi>Elvira;</hi>

            <p>We heard it once aſſerted by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Hume,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> that Mr. <hi>Malloch</hi> was deſtitute of the Pathetic. In this Obſervation however we beg leave to differ with him. In the fourth Act the whole Board of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe Privy Counſellors are melted into Tears. The Trial of the Prince moves the Hearts of thoſe Monſters of Iniquity, thoſe Members of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, when the leſs humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience are in Danger, from the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1233500300:13"/>
of two inſipid Harangues, of falling faſt aſleep. This majeſtic Scene is too exactly copied from a Trial at the <hi>Old Bailey,</hi> to have even the Merit of Originality. And indeed it is to the Lenity of the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> that we owe by far the greater Part of this amazing Play. The good Man lets his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Subjects out of Priſon to chat with him, when a wiſer Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch would have kept them cloſe confined in <hi>Newgate.</hi> The incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Action of that univerſal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> alone, ſaved this Act from the Damnation it deſerved. Had not he, like a ſecond <hi>Aeneas,</hi> carried the old doating and decrepid Father on his Back, he muſt have lain by the W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y. Tho' we muſt obſerve another Character in this Play
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1233500300:14"/>
ſeemed better ſuited to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity and Fire of this Actor. We could not but ſmile at the Humour of a merry Wag in the Pit, who at the Concluſion of one of the moſt tireſome Pleadings, with ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Impatience and Emotion called out, <hi>Encore, encore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fifth Act we were melted with the Sight of two young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which the King embraced, which the Prince embraced, which <hi>Elvira</hi> embraced. Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> in the 44th No. of the <hi>Spectator,</hi> has ſome Remarks ſo judicious and lively on the Practice of introducing Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren on the Stage, that we muſt beg leave to tranſcribe the Paſſage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:1233500300:15"/>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"A diſconſolate Mother with a Child in her Hand, has frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn Compaſſion from the Audience, and has therefore gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Place in ſeveral Tragedies; a modern Writer who obſerved how this had taken in other Plays, being reſolved to double the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and melt his Audience twice as much as thoſe before him had done, brought a Princeſs on the Stage with a little Boy in one Hand, and a Girl in the other. A third Poet being reſolved to out-write all his Predeceſſors, a few Years ago introduced three Children with great Succeſs; and as I am informed a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who is ſully determined to break the moſt obdurate Heart, has
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1233500300:16"/>
a Tragedy by him where the firſt Perſon that appears on the Stage is an afflicted Widow, in her mourning Weeds, with half a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen fatherleſs Children attending her, like thoſe that uſually hang about the Figure of Charity. Thus ſeveral Incidents that are beautiful in a good Writer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ridiculous by falling into the Hands of a bad one."</q>
            </p>
            <p>We would ſuggeſt to Mr. <hi>Malloch</hi> the uſeful Hint of introducing in ſome of his future Productions, the whole Foundling Hoſpital, which with a well painted Scene of the Edifice itſelf would certainly call forth the warmeſt Tears of Pity, and the bittereſt Emotions of Diſtreſs;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1233500300:17"/>
eſpecially when we conſider that many of the Parents of theſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Babes would probably be Spectators of this intereſting Scene.</p>
            <p>The Concluſion of the Piece is as abrupt as the other Parts of it are abſurd. We ſhould be much at a Loſs to gueſs by whom the Poiſon is adminiſtered to <hi>Elvira,</hi> were we not aided in our Conjectures by the ſhrewd Suſpicions which the King, tho' otherwiſe a very loving Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſeems to entertain of his Wife. Upon my regreting that her Majeſty, if guilty, ſhould eſcape without poetical Juſtice at leaſt, a Gentleman who ſat behind me, a Friend as I ſuppoſed of the Author, aſſured me her Puniſhment was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the Farce, which for that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1233500300:18"/>
Purpoſe was, contrary to Cuſtom, added to the Play.</p>
            <p>Though in general this Tragedy is colder than the moſt extreme Parts of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> yet we now and then feel a Warmth, but it is ſuch a Warmth or Glow rath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, as is ſometimes produced by the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Snow.</p>
            <p>Bad as this Play is, yet will the Author have the Profits of his Three Nights: Few on the Firſt Night having either Taſte or Spirit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Diſapprobation. Like the Raſcals who plundered <hi>Liſbon</hi> after the Earthquake, Mr. <hi>David Malloch</hi> will extract Guineas out of Rubbiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1233500300:19"/>
We ſhall now give, in a few Words, the Quinteſſence of this Play. Monarchs ought to be juſt. Heroes are bad Men. Huſbands ought to die for their Wives, Wives for their Huſbands. We ought to govern our Paſſions. And the Sun ſhines on all alike. A few of theſe new Remarks form the Sum total of this contemptible Piece.</p>
            <p>After the Play we were entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an Epilogue fraught with Humour, and ſpoken with Spirit. There was a Simile of a Bundle of Twigs formed into a Rod, which ſeemed to convey a delicate Alluſion to Mr. <hi>Malloch</hi>'s original Profeſſion, and ſome of the Lines contained an exquiſite and ſevere Criticiſm on the Play itſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1233500300:20"/>
Amidſt all the harſhneſs inſpired by a real Feeling of the Dulneſs of the Compoſition itſelf, it would be unjuſt not to beſtow the higheſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe on the principal Performers, by the Energy of whoſe Action even Dulneſs was ſometimes rendered reſpectable. We were ſorry to find ſuch great Talents ſo very ill em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. The melting Tones of a <hi>Cibber</hi> ſhould make every Eye ſtream with Tears. <hi>Pritchard</hi> ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways elevate. <hi>Garrick</hi> give Strength and Majeſty to the Scene.
