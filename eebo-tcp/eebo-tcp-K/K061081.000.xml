            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE VOYAGES AND ADVENTURES OF <hi>Capt.</hi> RICHARD FALCONER. BOOK I.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> WAS born at a Town call'd <hi>Bruton,</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> of Parents tolerably well to paſs in the World; my Mother dy'd when I was very young: My Father, <hi>Richard Falconer,</hi> had been a great Traveller in his Days, and his frequently
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0388001100:8"/>
repeating his Adventures abroad, made me have a great Deſire to follow his Steps: I often begg'd he would let me go to Sea with ſome Captain of his Acquaintance; but he would often ſay, <hi>Dick,</hi> ſtay where you are, you know not the Hazard and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers attend a maritime Life: You ſhall have a good Trade in your Belly, and that will keep you from a Deſire of rambling; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tell me what Calling you like beſt, that I may immediately put you out in Order to your living hereafter: You know, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd he, that my Fortune is but ſmall, and I living to the extent of it, it will not be poſſible for me to leave you wherewithal to ſupport you without ſome Employment. Therefore, (reply'd I) as you have a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you may leave your Subſtance to her, ſhe muſt be provided for; as for our Sex, we can beſt take Care for our ſelves, and if you pleaſe but to fit me out to Sea, even in what Station you think convenient, it ſhall be all I will deſire. Son, (ſays my Father) think no more of going to Sea, for I'll not have it ſo; I know it is only a Deſire of Youth, prone to change: If I ſhould give you leave, I am aſſur'd one Week's Voyage would make you wiſh to be at home again. I us'd all the Arguments my young Senſe prompted me with, but all to no purpoſe, my Father was not to be mov'd, and thus
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0388001100:9"/>
I liv'd two Years longer with him in Expectation of his Mind altering. At laſt an Accident happen'd that farther'd my Deſires, and tho' it was the Ruin of our Family, I muſt confeſs, I was not much concern'd.</p>
            <p>My Father was Superviſor of a Tax laid upon the burning of Pipes, and he having gather'd a Sum of Money, amounting to 3800 <hi>l.</hi> in order to pay in to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the King's Uſe, was by an under Exciſe-man, robb'd of the whole Sum, who made his Eſcape. My Father us'd all poſſible Means to apprehend him without Noiſe, but all his Endeavours were fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: ſo finding his Affairs in a deſperate Condition, reſolv'd to retire to ſome Part of the World, where he might be ſafe from the griping Hands of the Law. One Morning juſt before his voluntary Exile, he call'd me to him: <hi>Dick</hi> (ſays he) you have been often deſirous of going to Sea, and I have always us'd Arguments to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you from it; but now ſince what has happen'd, it being impoſſible for me to continue upon the Place of my Birth, the Patrimony of my Anceſtors, I muſt e'en recommend that way of Life to you which I ſhould never have choſe, but that the Exigency of my Affairs will not permit me to provide any other Way for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0388001100:10"/>
you. Here (continu'd he) take this 100 <hi>l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which I can ill ſpare out of my little For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but ſince it is all I can do for you, take it, and may Heaven proſper thy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings; may the Bleſſing of a Father always live with you, whoſe Prayers ſhall ever be ſent to our Almighty Creator for thy Welfare. Here (added he) is a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Recommendation for you to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Pultney,</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> whoſe Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip I am ſure will be of ſervice to you. With that, he embrac'd me with Tears in his Eyes, gave me his Bleſſing, kiſs'd me and took his leave for ever, for never have my Eyes beheld him ſince.</p>
            <p>This Parting, I think, was the greateſt Grief my Thoughts had ever known 'till then; (for nothing could be fonder, or ſhew more paternal Affection, than my dear Father at his laſt Farewel) but the Joy of my being at Liberty to follow my own Deſires, ſoon drowned my Sorrow for parting with ſo good a Parent.</p>
            <p>I had now nothing to do but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide my little Equipage in order to go to <hi>Briſtol</hi> to my Father's Friend; I pack'd up my Things in a Portmantua, and gave them to an old Servant of my Father's, who would ſee me as far as <hi>Briſtol,</hi> for his ſake. We ſet out in the Morning, and reach'd it by Noon: I enquir'd for

Captain <hi>Pultney,</hi> and by good Fortune found him at his Dwelling Houſe, in <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff</hi> Street, he having remov'd himſelf from another Street, which caus'd ſome Difficulty in the finding. I acquainted him who I was, and gave him my Father's Letter. He read it, and receiv'd me very kindly: It was to this Effect.</p>

Mr. <hi>Falconer,</hi> (ſays the Captain) I am heartily ſorry for your Father's Misfortunes, which he tells me in his Letter you will inform me of. After I had given him the whole Story, he told me he would provide for me as ſoon as poſſible, and till then I ſhould be as welcome to him as his own Son: In the mean time, ſays he, I would have you verſe your ſelf in the Mathematicks, which may be of uſe to you: I'll take Care to provide you a Maſter, and Inſtruments; which accordingly he did; and as I had a great Deſire to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and had ſome ſmall Knowledge of it which I learn'd at School, apart from my other Studies, I ſoon attain'd to the Theory of it.</p>
            <p>After I had run through the Courſe of Mathematicks, and the Captain was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd I was capable, he got me to be Mate (or rather Aſſiſtant) on board the <hi>Albion</hi> Frigate, Captain <hi>Waſe</hi> Commander; and on the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1699, we ſet ſail, (bound for <hi>Jamaica)</hi> with a fair Wind. As ſoon as we loſt ſight of Land, I began to be extremely Sea-ſick, and bore the Jeſts of the Sailors but indifferently; who cry'd, There's an excellent Maſter's-Mate, he'll hit <hi>Jamaica</hi> to a Hair, if the Iſland were no bigger than the Bung-hole of a Cask. I muſt confeſs, I believe my ſelf
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0388001100:13"/>
to be the only Perſon who ever ſet out on his firſt Voyage, as Maſter's-Mate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having ſeen a River that was naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But in a Day or two I was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well, and was never troubled with any Sickneſs afterwards.</p>
            <p>We had nothing material happen'd to us 'till we enter'd the Bay of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> where we were encounter'd with a dreadful Storm; the Billows ran Mountains high, and our Veſſel ſeem'd to be the Sport of the Waves: A Ship that overtook us the Day before, and accompany'd us, tho' it were not at Half a Furlong diſtance, was ſometimes loſt, by reaſon of the Heighth of the Waves. The Storm continu'd with this Violence three Days, and at laſt abated ſomething of its Fierceneſs, but ſtill blew very hard. The other Veſſel by firing a Gun, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Signal, made it appear ſhe was in diſtreſs, but the Sea ran ſo high it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to give them any Aſſiſtance, yet we bore down to them (being to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) as nigh as we could without Danger to our ſelves; we enquir'd into the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and found ſhe had ſprung a Leak; they had all Hands to pump by turns, but yet the Water gain'd on them. They begg'd of us to hoiſt out our Boat (their own being ſtav'd) to give them Succour upon occaſion: Accordingly we put out our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0388001100:14"/>
Long-Boat, with two of our Men in it, but the Rope that held her to the Ship broke by the Violence of the Waves, and drove away with the two unfortunate Men in her, and what became of them we could never learn; but undoubtedly they periſh'd by the Sea, or Hunger, we being 70 Leagues from any Shore. The Ship, after prodigious Labour of the Sailors, and in leſs than ten Minutes, ſunk to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; out of Fifty ſeven Men, but Four were ſav'd, and they, by good Fortune, laid hold on Ropes we threw out for that Purpoſe; but it had not been poſſible to ſave any, if we had not bore down to Leeward when we ſaw them in the laſt Extremity. And here we ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at Providence; For this very Veſſel was a Pyrate, one Captain <hi>Jones,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, who in an open large Boat ſet out from <hi>Dover,</hi> and near <hi>Oſtend</hi> ſtole upon a <hi>French</hi> Veſſel in the Night, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Captain and ſome others, and ſet all the Sailors a-ſhore that would not embrace their Deſigns, and had reſolv'd to attack us as ſoon as the Storm was over. The Four Men that were ſav'd, were three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, and one <hi>French</hi> Man, who ſaid they were forc'd, with ſeveral others, by the above mention'd Captain <hi>Jones,</hi> to take to that Courſe of Life; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0388001100:15"/>
true or falſe, I can't tell; indeed they behav'd themſelves very well with us all the Voyage, and were enter'd into our Books as Four of the Ship's Crew, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Two we left on Shore, who were not to be found when we ſet ſail, and the two poor Wretches that were loſt in the Boat. The Storm ſtill continu'd, but the Wind fair, ſo we ran it away with a riv'd Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail all Night, and the next Morning we had a violent Storm of Rain, and ſome Thunder, but about Noon the Sky clear'd up, the Rain ceas'd, and the Tempeſt was laid; the Wind however continuing fair, with a midling Gale.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the 28th. we diſcover'd the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and the Pike of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> and paſs'd this Iſland, or rather Rock, of a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Heighth. At Night the Wind roſe again, and continu'd to blow very hard for two Days. As I was walking on the Deck one Morning, my Chops were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with a Fiſh which drop'd down; I took it up, panting at the Gills for Life; it prov'd to be a flying Fiſh, purſu'd (as I ſuppoſe) by ſome Dolphin, or Albecore; the Manner of theſe Fiſhes avoiding their Enemies, is jumping out of the Water, and flying 'till their Wings are dry, then fall down again into the Sea. The Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin that chaſes them is one of the fineſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0388001100:16"/>
colour'd Fiſh that ſwims. I have obſerv'd our Painters draw them bending like a Bow; but I think it is as ſtrait a Fiſh as any in the Sea. We caught one of them with a Fizgig, an Inſtrument made of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Rows of iron Spikes, bearded like Hooks, and a Staff four or five Foot long to it; to this they tye a Cord of a great length, and dart it with all their Strength; the wounded Fiſh immediately flownces downward many Fathoms, and up again, which the Darter obſerves, giving him Rope and Play 'till his Weakneſs makes him more tame; then they draw him up the Ship's-ſide, and cut him in Pieces. The firſt we caught in this Manner was about ſix Foot long, which we dreſs'd, and part of it ſerv'd the whole Ship's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for Dinner; as ſoon as it was caught it loſt that beautiful Colour it had in the Water; as for my own Part, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their praiſing it, I had rather eat a Herring or a Mackrel than this rare Fiſh. I don't know whether theſe Fiſh can hear, or love Muſick, but this I am ſure of, we had an excellent Trumpet on board, which diverted us in good Weather, and I have obſerv'd, that at the Sound of it the Number of theſe Dolphins ſeem'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and ſwim within two Foot of our Veſſel; but that may be pure Accident;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0388001100:17"/>
yet I fancy there's ſomething in't, that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd the Fable of <hi>Amphion</hi> and the Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin. Sharks are taken as we take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fiſh, only the Hook is about two Foot long, and an iron Chain above that about four Foot long, and a long Rope to that; they generally bait the Hook with a Piece of Beef of three or four Pounds, which the voracious Fiſh ſwallows imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, Hook and all; then they give him play a while, and when he is pretty well ſpent, they draw him in with a Tackle: There's always one ſtands ready with an Axe to make a Divorce between his Tail and his Body, otherwiſe he would give ſuch large Thumps with it that might do the Ship Damage: I my ſelf was thrown down but with a Touch of it. This that we took, had in his Paunch the Collar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone of a Man, and a Boatſwain's ſilver Whiſtle, with a red Ribbon in it, entire, not ſo much as bruis'd, which was given to me as a Preſent, to make me amends for the Fall I receiv'd; it may be ſeen at my Bookſeller's, if any one has the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to ask for it; as to the Collar-bone, not any one would accept of it, ſo I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd it to the watry Element again.</p>
            <p>We paſt the <hi>Tropick,</hi> attended by the <hi>Tropick</hi>-Birds, a Fowl ſomething bigger than a Pidgeon; but one would think, as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0388001100:18"/>
it flies, it had an unlighted Candle fix'd in its Tail. I cannot let go the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of paſſing this <hi>Tropick:</hi> When you are in the Latitude, the old Sailors ask the reſt of the Ship's Crew, Whether they were ever that way before? If not, they muſt either pay a Bottle and Pound, (as they call it) or be duck'd: They that don't pay, are fix'd to a Rope at the Main-Yard-Arm, and duck'd three Times in the Sea; at which the reſt of the Crew Huz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za! and fire a Volley of Small-ſhot.</p>
            <p>When Admiral <hi>Benbow</hi> went with his Squadron of Men of War, the whole Fleet duck'd, but the Admiral gave 'em Notice, by firſt firing a Gun, which was immediately follow'd with a Volley of Muskets, and Huzzaing, by every Ship in the Fleet. A Day or two before our Account is out, we ſend a Man to the Topmaſt-head, in order to diſcover Land, where he ſtays an Hour, and looks about him: He that diſcovers it firſt, is rewarded with a Bottle and Pound; that is, a Bottle of Rum, and a Pound of Sugar, which is demanded as ſoon as the Anchor is caſt in a Place where ſuch Commodities are to be had. Now the Bottles and Pounds that accrue from the People that are not willing to be duck'd, in paſſing the <hi>Tropick,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0388001100:19"/>
by the old Sailors for a merry Bout, when ſafe in Harbour; which muſt not be touch'd by the freſh Men, as they call 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> the 3d, our Man at the Topmaſt-head, inſtead of crying, Land, (as we expected) call'd out, A Sail! a Sail! which in a quarter of an Hour we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd plainly upon Deck. We did not know what to think of it, we knew we were near Land, and conſequently in fear of thoſe Pyrates, or Buccaniers, that infeſt thoſe Coaſts: Our Captain call'd all Hands aloft; and told us, Gentlemen, 'Tis One to One, but this Veſſel we ſee may be a Pyrate, if ſo, how muſt we behave our ſelves? If you are reſolv'd to ſtand it, I'll ſtand it to the laſt; if not, we'll ſurrender with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firing a Gun, which may induce 'em to be civil to us. The Sailors cry'd, Let's fight 'em, let's fight 'em. With that, we put our Cheſts in the Hold, and brought up our Hammocks, to place 'em in the Netting on the Quarter-Deck; we clear'd our Guns, which were Twelve, and muſter'd our Men, which amounted to Thirty-eight, Paſſengers and all, who were as willing to fight as any of us, they having ſomething on Board that was valuable; and ſome of 'em, perhaps,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0388001100:20"/>
all their Fortune. We kept our Way, and the Ship bore up to us, with all the Sail ſhe could make. Night coming upon us, our Man at the Topmaſt-head diſcover'd Land, and another Ship to the Windward of us. With that, we call'd another Council, and perſiſted in our firſt Opinion of fighting; but yet to uſe all Means poſſible of making to Shore, (which was <hi>Barbadoes:)</hi> But for all our Endeavours, the firſt Ship got up with us, and about Twelve a Clock at Night hail'd us, and commanded us to hoiſt out our Boat, and come on Board him, with our Captain. We anſwer'd, We had never a Boat, (as indeed we had not) but we told him, if he would ſtay till Morning, ſomething might be done. At laſt he threatned to ſink us, if we wou'd not ſend our Captain aboard im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; and thereupon fir'd a Gun, which ſtruck our Veſſel on her Quarter. With that, we fir'd our Broad-ſide upon him, accompany'd with ſome ſmall Arms; which they little expecting, (I believe) did ſome Damage, and put 'em in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. Whereupon we tack'd about, and with our other ſix Guns rak'd her fore and aft; but was immediately ſeconded with a Broad-ſide from them, which kill'd us two Men, and wounded a third.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0388001100:21"/>
Upon which, with loud Huzza's and Firing, they immediately boarded us on our Starboard-Quarter, and pour'd into us at leaſt fourſcore Men: We reſiſted 'em with all the Force we had, but all to no purpoſe; they drove us into the Fore-caſtle, where, by good Chance, we made ſhift to barricade our ſelves; but they threaten'd to turn our own Guns upon us, if we did not ſurrender imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately: But our Captain being reſolute, order'd us to fire upon 'em with our ſmall Arms. Now we had under the Greatings, cloſe to our Steerage, a large Ciſtern, lin'd with Tin, where we had unwittingly plac'd ſeveral Cartriges of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but happily for us, whether it was our Firing, or in the Buſtle ſome Match dropt in, I know not, but the Powder took fire, blew up the Greatings, with ſome part of the Quarter-Deck, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Enemy, at leaſt, into the Air. Upon that, we ſally'd out, and drove the reſt, with our Cutlaſhes, into their own Veſſel again, with the loſs of ſeveral. But this ſignify'd little, for with the Fall and Breach of our Quarter-Deck, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Room was entirely ſtopp'd up; nor cou'd we, without great Difficulty, clear it from the Lumber, ſo that we had not any Powder, but what was in the Mens
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0388001100:22"/>
Cartriges, for their Muskets: However, we fir'd briskly with 'em; yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they prepar'd to Board us again, with all the Menaces imaginable. This Fight continu'd at leaſt four Hours, and the Dawn began to break upon us, which diſcover'd to us the other Ship we ſaw over Night, and we diſtinguiſh'd <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours; with that we gave a great Shout, and fir'd our ſmall Arms again. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy no ſooner ſaw the Ship with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Colours, but they cut off their Grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling-Irons, and did their Endeavour to make off, but their Rigging was ſo ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, that their Sails cou'd not be hoiſted. In the mean Time the other Ship came up to us, and, without hailing, pour'd a Broad-ſide into the Pyrate, and there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd a deſperate Fight between them. As for our Ship, it was of little Uſe, ſo we ſteer'd off, and clear'd our Gun-Room, and in half an Hour (the Fight continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that while) we had charg'd our Great Guns, and return'd to the Fight; but upon the Inſtant we ſaw the Pyrate ſinking, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship had tore a Hole between Wind and Water, that ſhe ſunk in a Moment, and but eight Men ſav'd, who told us their Captain was a Pyrate, from <hi>Guadalupe;</hi> that when they were ſinking, they had not above twenty Men
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0388001100:23"/>
left, out of an Hundred and ſixty; and moſt of them wounded. The Ship that gave us this ſeaſonable Reſcue was the <hi>Guernſey</hi> Frigate, whoſe Station was <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes.</hi> We lay by for an Hour or two, to repair our Rigging, &amp;c. and hail'd her, deſiring 'em to ſend a Boat on Board for our Captain, becauſe we were without one; which accordingly they did. Captain <hi>Waſe</hi> and I went immediately on Board, to pay our Reſpects to their Commander, who receiv'd us with all imaginable Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility. We had, on Board our Ship, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Sailors, and two Paſſengers, killd; the one, <hi>Joſeph Ridge</hi> of <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and the other, <hi>Daniel Thompſon</hi> of <hi>Mevis,</hi> Merchant; and four wounded. The <hi>Guernſey</hi> had ſixteen Men kill'd, and three wounded; among which was the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, who died the ſame Day of a Wound he received in his Thigh, with a Musket Ball chew'd, which made the Wound mortal. The Captain invited us to dine with him, which we did; where we were treated with a new Diſh, (at leaſt to me) a <hi>Pollo,</hi> that is, Fowls boil'd with Rice and ſalt Pork; which was very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latable. We took our Leaves of the Captain, and went on Board of our own Veſſel, and at five a Clock in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

               <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> for its bigneſs, is the richeſt and beſt peopled Iſland in all <hi>America;</hi> it is ſeated in thirteen Degrees, twenty Minutes; in length, twenty four meaſur'd Miles, and in the broadeſt Part about ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen: It reſembles a Leg of Mutton, with the Knuckle off. The <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Eaſt</hi> Sides are fortify'd by Nature, from any Harm from Ships of War, by reaſon there is no Anchoring Place. On the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſterly</hi> Part, are four excellent, commodious, well-fortify'd Harbours: The chief is that where we now ride, which will contain a Thouſand Sail of Ships, free from the Danger of any Winds. At the bottom of this Harbour, ſtands the Capitol of the Iſland, call'd St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi>'s; with a Fort at each End, and a Platform in the middle; which makes it of Strength ſufficient to oppoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>a Royal Navy: 'Tis a neat large Town, with two Churches, one with a handſome Organ: For Largeneſs, I think this Town may compare with our City of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> but better inhabited. As for the other three, which are, 1. <hi>Charles</hi> Town. 2. St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Town.</hi> 3. <hi>Little Briſtol</hi> in <hi>Spright</hi>'s Bay, I can give no manner of Account of: But for my Reader's Satisfaction, if he

               <hi>July</hi> the 20th.

We paſs'd <hi>Martinico, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minica, Guadalupe,</hi> and <hi>Antegoa,</hi> and the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> anchor'd at <hi>Mevis,</hi> where we had immediately the Friends of Mr. <hi>Daniel Thompſon,</hi> Merchant, on Board us, to unlade the Goods; for they had heard of his Death, by a Veſſel from <hi>Barbadoes</hi> a Week before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mevis,</hi> or <hi>Nevis,</hi> lies in ſeven Degrees, nineteen Minutes; it is ſix Leagues in Circumference: There is but one Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the whole Iſland, which ſome call <hi>Mevis</hi> Harbour, or <hi>Bath Bay,</hi> where lies the Town, under the former Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is pretty well ſecured with a Fort and Platform of Great Guns. I was inform'd by one of the Inhabitants, that there is a Mineral Water, very good to bathe in, which cures the ſame Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers

            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſettled here, <hi>Ann.

They ſend abroad as much Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, Ginger, Cotton, and Tobacco, as any Iſland of its Bigneſs in the <hi>Caribbees.</hi> They are very regular in their Government here, they neither allow of Drunkenneſs, nor Whoring, (I mean in common, as in <hi>Barbadoes, Jamaica,</hi> &amp;c.) Here I was firſt ſaluted with a little Fly, call'd a <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keto,</hi> and tho' it is ſmall, yet it has a deviliſh ſharp Sting with it. They get into our Stockings, and are ſo very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to new Comers, that there's hardly any bearing of 'em. If you ſcratch the Places ſtung by 'em till the Blood comes, it may prove dangerous; I my ſelf kept a ſore Leg three Months upon that account. I was alſo inform'd there was a Flea they call <hi>Chigos,</hi> which breed in Duſt, or Aſhes; and of all the Inſects in the <hi>Caribbees,</hi> this is the moſt dangerous: They get into the Nails of the Toes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly, and from thence run over all the Body; tho' they chiefly fix themſelves in the bottom of the Feet: Which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions an itching, follow'd with Holes in the Skin. They make Bliſters as big as Peas in the Fleſh, where their young ones
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0388001100:27"/>
breeding, cauſe Ulcers and rotten Fleſh, which there is no Remedy for, but to eat away the Parts affected, with <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> and Burnt-Alum. While we lay here, there was a Sword Fiſh ran himſelf aſhore, (which was ſuppos'd to be done in eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chaſing ſome other Fiſh:) It had no Scales, but a dusky Skin, and a white Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, rough like a Smith's File, a flat Head, two Fins on each ſide, two on the Back, and one inſtead of a Tail. It is a Fiſh of prodigious Swiftneſs: The Sword (which is fix'd in the Head) is ſix, ſeven, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eight Foot long: Near his Eyes are two Noſtrils, out of which he throws the Water a great heighth into the Air. This Fiſh often encounters with the Whale, and proves too hard for him; for with his Sword he rips up the Whale. I bought one of theſe Swords of a poor Inhabitant, for four Bottles of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Beer, (which is a great Rarity with them) that he got in a Piece of a Wreck, but thruſt in ſo far, that the End, in getting out, was broke three Inches.</p>
            <p>Next to <hi>Mevis,</hi> lies St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> (or, as we generally call it, St. <hi>Kit's)</hi> in ſeventeen Degrees, and twenty five Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, <hi>Northward</hi> of the Equinoctial. It is twenty five Leagues in Circumference, the Soil light and ſandy, and produces
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0388001100:28"/>
Fruit common with us in <hi>England.</hi> In the middle of this Iſland riſes a high Mountain, from which runs Streams of freſh Water, that ſometimes ſwell ſo high with ſudden Rains, that they drown all the Country near 'em. This Iſland is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> who even in the Time of War live very friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together. There was formerly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd a Silver Mine here, which the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> claim an equal Title to; but neither make any Uſe of it, by reaſon of the want of Miners. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties are better peopled than the <hi>French,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> have more Conveniencies, and better fortify'd Places than the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi> An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fryar belonging to the <hi>French</hi> Jeſuits, (who gave me this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription) told me, that the <hi>French</hi> had built a Town, call'd, <hi>Baſſe Terre</hi> (in a Harbour of the ſame Name, and chief in the Iſland) full as big as <hi>Graveſend,</hi> with very handſome Houſes, for the Merchants, and Trades People, which are many; where there is alſo an Hoſpital to maintain their indigent ſick, together with a handſome Free-ſchool, with large Endowments, for the Children of the Iſland. But what they moſtly brag of, is their Caſtle, which is built about a Furlong from the Sea, at the Foot of a high Mountain, ſhadow'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0388001100:29"/>
with great Trees: In the Way thither, ſtand the Houſes of the Governour, and other Officers, for more Security; ſeated in a Walk of Orange and Lemon Trees, from the Brow of the Sea up to the Caſtle; which is three Story high, built with Freeſtone and Brick: The Halls and Chambers are very lightſome and high, and the Walls are adorn'd with Cedar: On the Top is a flat Terrace, which yields a delightful Proſpect all over the Country. The Winds which blow from the Hills, ſo tempers the Heat, that it makes it more pleaſant than any other Iſland of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbees.</hi> As to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, they are not much inferior to the <hi>French;</hi> they have ſix Churches, and two Chapels, for Divine Service. This Iſland was plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed jointly by <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> in 1625. Captain <hi>Thomas Warner,</hi> for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and one <hi>Deſnambuc,</hi> for the <hi>French.</hi> The Natives made a vigorous Reſiſtance, but to little Purpoſe. With this Succeſs, they return'd back to their ſeveral Countries, and went again and ſettled there; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having more Supplies from <hi>London,</hi> daily encreas'd; when on the contrary, the Merchants at <hi>Paris</hi> grew weary, ſeeing no Return for all the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they had been at. But whilſt this Buſineſs ſeem'd to go on with Succeſs, an
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0388001100:30"/>
Accident happen'd, which ruin'd all at once. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſet out a Fleet the ſame Year, of thirty one Galloons, three Galleaſes, and four Pinnaces, with four thouſand Men, under the Command and Direction of <hi>Frederick de Toledo,</hi> from <hi>Cadiz, Antonio Nunnez Barrico,</hi> and <hi>Franciſco de Almeida,</hi> Commanders of twenty Galleys, from <hi>Portugal;</hi> theſe join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the abovementioned, with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to drive the <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> entirely out of the <hi>American</hi> Iſlands. Coming before <hi>Mevis,</hi> they took nine <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels: After that they ſail'd to St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> where Captain <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambuc</hi> (altho' not prepar'd for Defence, becauſe their Fortifications were not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd) drew all his Forces near the Shore, to hinder their Landing: But Captain <hi>Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> who commanded another Port, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd 'em to land without the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Whereupon young <hi>Deſnambuc,</hi> Lieutenant of a Company under <hi>Roſſey,</hi> ſally'd out, and fell valiantly on the firſt Company of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> killing many of 'em, and put 'em to the Rout; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being ſeconded by another Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, he was ſlain, after having made a ſtout Reſiſtance, and forſaken by all his Men. <hi>Roſſey,</hi> upon this, abandons his Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and flies to the Hills, and high
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0388001100:31"/>
Grounds: Whereupon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſters of the Forts, but durſt not follow <hi>Roſſey,</hi> for fear of an Ambuſcade; which Fear prov'd true: For <hi>Deſnambuc</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining the Fort, retir'd on Board ſome Veſſel, prepar'd for that Purpoſe, and made off. In the mean time, the Powder taking Fire, blew up the Fort, and ſix hundred <hi>Spaniards,</hi> into the Air. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> relying upon the League between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> made no Reſiſtance, but ſent Agents to <hi>Toledo,</hi> &amp;c. to put him in mind of the League between their Maſters: To which he reply'd, That St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> being part of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> World, was given by the Pope to his Maſter <hi>Philip.</hi> Nevertheleſs he gave 'em ſix of the nine Veſſels they took at <hi>Mevis,</hi> to imbark themſelves, on Condition they wou'd ſail immediately for <hi>England;</hi> which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to: But the ſix Veſſels not holding all, the reſt were left on the Iſland, for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Opportunity. No ſooner was <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo</hi> out of ſight, but the remaining part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inhabitants took freſh Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and rebuilt ſeveral Forts, and made every thing ready for Defence, if Occaſion ſhou'd be. In the mean Time <hi>Deſnam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buc</hi> ſuffer'd a great deal of Hardſhip, thro' ill Weather, and want of Proviſion; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been at ſeveral Iſlands, intending to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0388001100:32"/>
ſettle, with his little Company, but not liking any of 'em, and hearing that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy were gone to the <hi>Havana,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were buſy tilling their Grounds, he return'd to his former Station, where they ſuffer'd many Hardſhips; till ſome Veſſels from the <hi>Netherlands</hi> arriv'd, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd 'em with Proviſions, Ammunition, and Cloaths, upon Credit: But in a few Years they paid all, and grew rich, from their plentiful Stock of Tobacco, Sugars, Ginger, and Indigo, till they brought it to the rich and flouriſhing State it now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in.</p>
            <p>Having ended our Affairs, we ſet Sail for <hi>Jamaica,</hi> the 21ſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1699; and on the 7th of <hi>September,</hi> anchor'd ſafe in <hi>Port Royal</hi> Harbour, in the great and flouriſhing Iſland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> without any Accident. This was our laſt Station: Here we were to unlade the remaining part of our Goods, and take in its Return, Rum, Sugar, and Spice.</p>
            <p>This Iſland of <hi>Jamaica</hi> is the only Mart of all <hi>America</hi> for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which drive a large Trade here; but Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs is in its full Perfection: I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Captain <hi>Waſe</hi> ask'd one of our Men, that had ſpent ſome Money aſhore, what was his Opinion of the Honeſty of the Women of <hi>Port Royal?</hi> Why truly, ſays
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0388001100:33"/>
               <hi>Tarr</hi> very bluntly, if there's one honeſt Woman ſhou'd happen to tumble down, I believe there's never another to take her up. Proviſion is prodigious dear here; two or three of us went on ſhore to Dinner, one Day, at <hi>Port Royal,</hi> where we had only a roaſted Turkey, wretchedly lean, and nothing nigh ſo well taſted as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Turkeys, and our Eating came to Thirty Shillings; but then, to make amends, Money is plenty enough. We had a Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor on Board, that had been a Taylor by Trade; this Fellow got Leave of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to go on ſhore for a Month, where he clear'd, by working Journey-Work, twelve Pound for that Month: But then he had the Ship's Proviſion carry'd on ſhore to him two or three times a Week; had he been to have paid for his Diet, he had ſav'd but a ſmall Matter. I was mightily ſurpriz'd to ſee a Market for Turtle, in the ſame Manner as our Butchers. This is a Meat, or rather Fiſh, of an odd Nature, but of an excellent Taſte; the Lean looks like the Fleſh of Pork, but ſomething of a deeper red; the Fat is a ſort of a light green, but very luſcious; this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Diet of the Slaves, or meaner ſort of People; but if Strangers eat too much of it, it's apt to give 'em the Bloody-Flux. This is a very reigning Diſtemper here,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0388001100:34"/>
and carries off abundance of new Comers. The Iſland of <hi>Jamaica</hi> lies—Leagues <hi>North</hi> from the <hi>Southern</hi> Continent of <hi>America,</hi> in the Sea call'd <hi>Mare del Nor;</hi> and <hi>South</hi> from the Iſle of <hi>Cuba,</hi> about twelve Leagues; and twenty <hi>Weſt</hi> from <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> in eighteen Degrees <hi>Northern</hi> Latitude; and beareth from <hi>Rio de Hach, North-Weſt,</hi> a hundred and fifty Leagues; from <hi>Santa Martha, N. N. W.</hi> a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty-five; from <hi>Carthagena, N.</hi> a hundred and fourteen; from <hi>Portobello, N. E.</hi> and by <hi>N.</hi> a hundred and ninety; from the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien, N.</hi> and by <hi>E.</hi> a hundred and ſeventy; and from the Bay of <hi>Mexico,</hi> a hundred and fifty. Its Form is almoſt oval; being in Length, from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> about fifty four Leagues; from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> in the broadeſt part, twenty three Leagues, going narrower toward each End, like a Rowling-Pin, (a good Compariſon.) In Circumference, one hundred and fifty Leagues. The Air of this Iſland is more temperate, and the Heat more tolerable, than any of the other Iſlands, by reaſon of the cool Breezes which conſtantly blow from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> with frequent Showers of Rain, and Dews that fall in the Night. Theſe Dews are very pernicious to careleſs drunken People, that lie expos'd all Night to 'em. This
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0388001100:35"/>
is alſo the only Iſle of the <hi>Barloventi,</hi> which is not ſubject to violent Storms, and Hurricanes, as the other Iſlands are. And the Diſeaſes that are predominant here, are only bred by Intemperance; as Surfeits, Bloody-flux, Fevers, and Agues; or occaſion'd by ill Diet, or Slothfulneſs. This Iſland is well water'd with Springs and Rivulets of freſh Water, (with many handſome Rivers ſtor'd with ſeveral ſorts of Fiſh;) and is all over (eſpecially in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts) full of high Mountains and Hills: It is alſo well wooded; for the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> Parts chiefly abound with large and tall Woods. Neither is there wanting Savanna's, or Plains. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of this Iſland are very many; and firſt, for Vegetables; the Sugars are ſo good, that they now out ſell thoſe of <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> 5 <hi>s. per Cent.</hi> Tobacco is ſo excellent, that it is bought up faſter than the Planters can cure it: The Indigo is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo here very good: The Cotton is much the beſt of all the neighbouring Iſlands: Tortoiſe-ſhell is very plenty here. Here are alſo great Variety of Dyewood, as <hi>Fuſt-wick, Red-wood,</hi> a kind of <hi>Log-wood, Cedar, Mohogeny, Lignum-vitae, Ebony, Granadille,</hi> and many others. Nay, there's many Mines, both of Silver, Copper, and Gold; but that the Inhabitants think it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0388001100:36"/>
wou'd be dangerous to break 'em up, for fear of drawing the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Buccaniers upon 'em. There are ſeveral Fiſhermen who have found pieces of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergreaſe upon the Surface of the Water, near the Shore. Ginger grows better here than in any other Part of <hi>America;</hi> and Cod-Pepper very plentifully: And alſo, a certain Kind of Spice call'd, <hi>Piemete,</hi> in Form of <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Pepper, of a very aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and curious Taſte, partaking, as it were, of ſeveral Species together: It grows wild among the Mountains, and is highly valu'd among the Inhabitants. Of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Plants I have ſeen ſeveral, as <hi>Guaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, China-root, Caſſia, Fiſtula Veuillard, Achiotes, Tamarines, Contrayerva, Ciperas, Adiantum-nigrum, Aloes, Cucumis Agriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, Sumach, Acacia, Miſſelto,</hi> with many other Drugs and Balſams. The ingenious Sir <hi>Hans Sloan</hi> has wrote an elaborate Book of the Plants of this Iſland. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chineal</hi> is produc'd by a Plant that grows in this Country, but not brought to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, without much Care and Induſtry. This Iſland is alſo very well ſtock'd with Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as Horſes, Cows, and Aſſes; there have been many Mules, but the Inhabitants made ſo little Uſe of 'em, that now there are but few. Sheep are large and tall, and their Meat indifferently good, but their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0388001100:37"/>
Fleece worth nothing. <hi>Goats</hi> (or <hi>Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates)</hi> are without Number, being a Beaſt peculiar to the Country. Hogs, both wild and tame, in abundance. I have been hunting the wild Hog in <hi>Porta Morant</hi> Bay, and it gives good Diverſion, though ſometimes dangerous: You go with ſome Ten or a Dozen in Company, arm'd with a Musket and a Cutlaſh; as ſoon as ever (with your Dogs) you have found 'em out, you all take Aim, and fire as quick as you can; but if you don't kill 'em immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with your Shot, they ſet upon you open-mouth'd, ſo that you muſt either hew 'em down with your Cutlaſhes, or club your Muskets. Generally as ſoon as you have 'em, you flay 'em, as you do Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and <hi>barbicue</hi> 'em, even in the very Place where you kill 'em; that is, you dig a ſquare Hole in the Earth, then clap four Stakes at each Corner, and on 'em put your Meat, ſo make a Fire under it, and when one ſide is done enough, you turn the other. For tame Fowls, they have of all the Kinds that we have in <hi>England;</hi> beſides <hi>Guinea</hi> Hens, <hi>Parrots, Parachites, Machaws,</hi> and <hi>Boobies,</hi> (which are <hi>Boobies</hi> indeed, for they will ſit upon a Tree, or Poſt, till you come and take 'em.) They have three Crops a Year, in this Iſland, and the Trees are always green. They
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0388001100:38"/>
have three ſorts of Bread, one of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Corn, another of <hi>Guinea</hi> Wheat, and the third of a Root they call Caſavi, which is rank Poiſon, till preſs'd and bak'd in an Oven; 'tis very white, but taſteleſs, and the Bread made of it, the Size of our thin Oat-Cakes. But of all the Fruit this Iſland produces, the Pine-Apple is the beſt, which grows very low, with Leaves ſomething like the <hi>Indicus Ficus</hi> that I have ſeen in Gardens here in <hi>England;</hi> the Taſte is ſo excellent, that I know not what to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it to, it having the Reliſh of all fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flavour'd Fruits. There's a Fruit that grows upon a low Buſh, call'd the Prickle-Pear, the inſide of which is red, and on the top is a little thorny Thing like a Star, which if you do not take away, before you eat it, may prove pernicious. If you eat but two of this Fruit, it will make your Urine as red as Blood. <hi>Plantins</hi> are a very good Fruit, which is, when bak'd in the Aſhes, us'd by the Slaves inſtead of Bread: 'Tis a Fruit with a Skin on it, like our Beans, which is taken off, and then the Fruit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, about the ſize of a <hi>Bolognia</hi> Sauſage. <hi>Bannanas</hi> is another Fruit ſomething of the ſame Kind, but ſhorter, and more luſcious: Both theſe Fruits are ripe all the Year, for when ſome are fit to gather, others are green, and ſome in Bud. The Oranges
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0388001100:39"/>
and Lemons, are neither of 'em good, in my Opinion: but their Limes are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, they grow upon a Tree full of Thorns, where you muſt be ſure to prick your Fingers, if you'll gather 'em. Theſe, with Spring-Water and Sugar, was the chief of my Liquor, while we ſtaid there. The Potatoes are very fine here, exceeding, in my Opinion, even thoſe of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Then there's another Root call'd Jams, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>-Artichoak, but larger and ſtringy. The Onions of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> are much milder, and better taſted than our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Onions, and very whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: They us'd to make a great Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Crogick Brewis; that is, Bisket ſoak'd in fair Water, for ſome Time, then the Water thrown away, and the Bisket ſtrew'd over with Salt, Oil, and Lime-Juice, together with Onions; and ſo eaten as a dainty Diſh. There is a ſenſitive Plant in this Iſland; the Stalk, ſurrounded with Leaves full of dark red Spots, bears a ſweet-ſmelling violet-colour'd Flower; the Leaves, as ſoon as touch'd, cloſe up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and die; and accordingly as they are held in the Hand a ſhorter or a longer Time, this Alteration continues. Ginger grows plentiful here; the Male Plant (for there's Sexes) hath generally bigger Leaves than the Female: The Stalks, which are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0388001100:40"/>
without Knots, have more Leaves upwards than downwards, and ſpreads along the Earth, ſtill taking Root anew. When the Leaves wither, then the Ginger is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ripe, but it has not that Poinancy whilſt green, as when dry'd. The Cotton of this Place (of which the Cloaths and Hammocks are made, are vended in moſt Parts of the <hi>Weſteru</hi> World) grows on a Tree about the Heighth of a Peach-Tree, with a ſtrait Stem, or Body, out of which ſhoot Boughs of an equal Length, and at equal Diſtance: Between the Leaves, which are narrow and long, grow red Flowers, and from 'em, oval Cods, which, when ripe, incloſe the Cotton, and a Seed like Pepper. Of hurtful Creatures, there is the Crocodile, or <hi>Alligator,</hi> which infeſt many Rivers and Ponds; this is a Creature of a monſtrous Size; I have ſeen one twenty ſix Foot long; it moves ſwiftly and ſtrongly forward, but turns ſlow; they are impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable every where but in the Eye, or Belly; they have four Feet, or Fins, with which they go, or ſwim; their uſual Courſe of getting their Food is to lie on their Backs as dead, then with a ſudden Onſet they ſpring upon their Prey, whether Man or Beaſt: But 'tis eaſily avoided by a Man, by reaſon of an Aromatick Smell that comes from the Body, which may be ſmelt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0388001100:41"/>
five Hundred Yards; but if a Man has got a Cold, and can't ſmell, if he has Eyes they are eaſily avoided; for if they run right forward, it is but ſlipping on one ſide, for they are as long in turning as a Coach. The Oil that's made from theſe Creatures, is good for ſeveral Diſtempers. They lay their Eggs (about the ſize of a Turkey's) and cover 'em with Sand, which heated by the Beams of the Sun, hatches the young ones, who naturally creep into the Water. One of theſe Creatures ſwam after us fifty Yards in <hi>Porto Morant</hi> Bay, and rais'd his Head upon the Edge of our Long-Boat, which was deeply laden with Casks of Water; our Carpenter, who had been fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Timber to Wood the Ship, ſtruck him a very great Blow on the Noſe with his Hatchet, that I am ſure hurt him, for he gave a ſort of Shriek, which no Body ever heard before, and ſwam to ſhore; where I obſerv'd him to run his Head into the Mud, as if it pain'd him, which makes me think that their Heads are not invulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as is reported. The <hi>Guana</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creature amphibious as the <hi>Alligator,</hi> but nothing nigh ſo large: There's an Iſland near <hi>Jamaica,</hi> call'd <hi>Guana</hi> Iſland, inhabited by nothing elſe; our Seamen eat of theſe latter, but much Good may it do 'em, for the Fleſh looks like a piece of a 
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0388001100:42"/>
               <hi>Black-a-more</hi>'s Arm; but how it taſtes I can't tell, neither do I ever deſign to try. The <hi>Cocoa</hi> Nut is a Fruit that is both Meat, Drink, and Cloathing to the Natives, (I mean the Blacks) the Rind ſerves for wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Cloaths, nay, and rigging their Canoes, before they knew the <hi>Europeans;</hi> and when you have taken off the Bark, you muſt be beholding to a Saw to cut off the Monkey's Face, which is the top, with three Marks that makes it ſomething reſemble that Animal; then the Inſide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, firſt a liquid Subſtance, like Whey, but very ſweet; after you have taken out this Liquor, round the Nut is a Subſtance a quarter of an Inch thick, which you cut out, and that's the Meat, which is very delicious and grateful to the Taſte, but not wholſome, if eat of too much: There's another Thing that's very remarkable, and that is the <hi>Phiſick-Nut,</hi> much of the Taſte of our Pig-nuts, but one or two of 'em will do your Buſineſs, upwards or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as well as Dr. <hi>Annodyne-Necklace</hi>'s Sugar-Plumbs. As I was going one Day to dine with Captain <hi>Kendal,</hi> (a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Inhabitant within a Mile of the Bay in <hi>Porto Morant)</hi> attended by a Black, a Servant of his, I ſaw in the Hedge a fair Apple growing on a Buſh, which I readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gather'd, and was conveying to my
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0388001100:43"/>
Mouth, but prevented by the Black's giving me a Blow on the Hand, which ſtruck it from me; I immediately, with my Sword in the Scabbard, fell to belabour the poor Fellow for his Inſolence, for I having been familiar with him, and talk'd to him along the Road, thought he made our old <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Proverb true, <hi>If you give an Inch they'll take an Ell;</hi> but it ſeems the Fellow ſav'd my Life by it, for this Fruit, which was call'd a <hi>Mangineel Apple,</hi> was rank Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but what I had never ſeen or heard of before; I was ſo concern'd for the Blows I had given the poor Fellow, that I gave him a Dollar to make him amends. I remember I was afterwards waſhing my ſelf at a River, in the ſame Bay, and it raining very hard, I went under a Tree, to ſave my Cloaths from being wet, and in placing them together in a Cavity of the Shore, the Drops of Rain fell on a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineel</hi> Tree, and ſo on my Back, but in leſs than half an Hour my Fleſh burn'd very hot, and white Bliſters appear'd upon my Skin, inſomuch that I was in a high Fever; but a Native of the Place being with me, ran for ſalt Water, and waſh'd me all over, and afterwards got ſome Oil and dip'd my Shirt in it, and put it on my Back, which gave me Eaſe immediately; but the Spots remain'd upon my Skin ſeveral Years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0388001100:44"/>
I don't doubt but my Readers will laugh at me for thus running from one Thing to another, but I relate 'em juſt as my Memory prompts me. This Iſland was firſt diſcover'd by <hi>Columbus, Anno Dom.</hi> 1499. After he had conquer'd the Natives, and built a City, call'd <hi>Sevilla,</hi> (afterwards <hi>St. Jago de la Vega)</hi> conſiſting of about ſeventeen Hundred Houſes, two Churches, two Chapels, and an Abbey, he made his Son <hi>Diego Columbus</hi> Governor of the whole Iſland, for his Maſter <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The firſt Attempt made upon this Iſland by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was <hi>A. D.</hi> 1592, under the Command of Mr. <hi>Antony Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> but after vanquiſhing the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they deſerted it, as not thinking it worth their keeping, and return'd home. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> again poſſeſſing it, remain'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted, till <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1654, when <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver Cromwel,</hi> then Lord Protector, rigg'd out a Fleet of Ships to make a Deſcent on <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> under the Command of Colonel <hi>Venables;</hi> but being diſappointed of their Hopes, and meeting with ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, ſteer'd away for <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and on the 10th of <hi>May</hi> (after a ſtout Reſiſtance) made themſelves Maſters of it. The Iſland is ſuppos'd to contain two hundred and fifty thouſand Inhabitants, Slaves included. The chief Towns are, 1ſt, <hi>St. Jago,</hi> about
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0388001100:45"/>
ſix Miles up the Country. 2<hi>dly, Paſſage-Town,</hi> ſix Miles from that. 3<hi>dly,</hi> (And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the largeſt, before the Earthquake de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd it) <hi>Port Royal,</hi> it contained a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Houſes, many of them eminent Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but as it is now built on a ſmall Neck of Land, which forms the Harbour, I take it to be about the bigneſs of <hi>Dept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> At both Ends of the Town is a large Fort, known by the Name of the ſquare and round Fort: the ſquare Fort, or Caſtle, contains a hundred Pieces of Ordnance, and the other about thirty, beſides ſeveral Canon on the Platform, which reaches from one Fort to the other; ſo that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Treachery, they need not fear an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack either by Land or Sea. About a Mile farther, is another ſmall Fort, call'd <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Fort, which ſecures the Town from any Attempt by Land: Off the Mouth of the Harbour, towards the Sea, lie ſeveral ſmall Iſlands, upon the moſt <hi>Weſtern</hi> of which (lying within half a League of the Town, and by which all the Veſſels muſt paſs) they have erected a Fort which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains eight Guns. The chief Harbour, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Port Royal,</hi> is <hi>Port St. Antony,</hi> on the <hi>North;</hi> a very ſafe, commodious, land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock'd Harbour, only the coming in is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing difficult, the Channel being narrow'd by a little Iſland that lies off the Mouth of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0388001100:46"/>
the Port. 2<hi>d, Portomorant,</hi> a very capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Harbour, where Ships do convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wood and Water, and ride ſafe from all Winds. 3<hi>d,</hi> On the <hi>South</hi> is <hi>Port Gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> which is much the largeſt of all that has been mention'd, it being five Leagues over, in ſome Places; it is land-lock'd by a Point of Land that runs <hi>S. W.</hi> from the main of the Iſland: The Road is ſo deep that a Ship of a thouſand Tun may lay her Side to the Shore of the Point, and lade or unlade at Pleaſure, with Planks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>float.</p>
            <p>Now finding our Affairs wou'd detain us half a Year longer, I got Leave of the Captain to go in a Sloop, with ſome of my Acquaintance, to get Logwood, and on <hi>September</hi> the 25th we ſet ſail for the Bay of <hi>Campeche,</hi> with a fair Wind. The old Manner of getting this Wood is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; a Company of deſperate Fellows get together in a Sloop, well arm'd, and Land by ſtealth, but in Caſe of any Reſiſtance, the whole Crew attends on the Cutters, ready arm'd to defend 'em; (indeed there's a Colony of <hi>Engliſh</hi> that ſells this Log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, but many chuſe the other Way; all this was ſtrange to me, for I knew nothing of the matter, till we were out to Sea. There was one Fellow there that told me, that about ten Years before he went with a

Veſſel, and they took the ſame Method as uſual, in getting it, and landed all their Men but ſix, that they left on Board to look after the Veſſel; in the mean time the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having Intelligence of their Deſcent, ſent a hundred Men, in ſeveral Canoes, to ſeize their Veſſel; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they did, without any Reſiſtance from the ſix Men on Board: After they had clap'd theſe Men under Hatches, they ſearch'd and ranſack'd the Veſſel, ſending every thing on ſhore that was of any Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; then they prepar'd to trepan the Crew, as they came on board, which happen'd the very next Night, when ſome of the Men coming on board with a Load of Log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> caus'd the ſix Men to ſtand upon Deck, and on Pain of Death, not to diſcover the Truth of the Matter, which happen'd as they deſir'd, for the Men coming on Board careleſly without their Arms, were all ſeiz'd immediately, and clapp'd in Irons. The reſt that were on ſhore wondering at the ſtay of the Boat, ſent a Canoe with ſix Men, to know the Reaſon of their Delay, which were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe taken in the ſame Trap with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The Man that told me this Story, was one of theſe laſt ſix, who found means ſecretly in the middle of the Night to ſlip into the Water, and ſwam aſhore, tho' a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0388001100:48"/>
League off, where he happily inform'd the reſt of the Crew (which were forty three) of the Misfortune that had happen'd to their Companions: Whereupon they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted what they had beſt do; where it was unanimouſly agreed, to ſeize upon three large Canoes, that lay at the bottom of the Bay, that belong'd to ſome <hi>French</hi> Hunters that were on ſhore; which was done accordingly: On Board they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately got, well arm'd, and ſteer'd away for their Sloop: But as they deſign'd to trick them the ſame way as the others had done their Companions, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted what to do if they ſhould be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd before they could get on Board, which was probable enough. At length it was agreed to carry on the Plot in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and as ſoon as ever they could get over the Ship's ſide to aſſault the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with all the Vigour imaginable, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing two or three to releaſe their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and put Arms into their Hands, to be aſſiſtant in recovering their Liberties. Every thing happen'd as was ſuggeſted, for when they came within half a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long of the Veſſel, they were hail'd by ſome of their own Men, as it is uſual in ſuch Caſes; which was anſwer'd by them in the Canoes, with ſwearing and curſing at 'em, for not coming aſhore with their Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0388001100:49"/>
as order'd, but to force 'em to bring their Wood aboard in Canoes. They ask'd from on Board, how many were come with 'em? All (anſwer'd they in the Boat) but three, that we left aſhore to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Arms, and a ſmall Remainder of Log-wood, which you muſt go and fetch immediately with the Long-boat, (which they pretended cou'd not go to 'em before, by reaſon ſhe had a Hole broke in her Bow, againſt a piece of Rock, that gave 'em a great deal of Trouble in getting her to the Veſſel.) Our People ſmil'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to hear they had got their Leſſon ſo ready. In asking and anſwering theſe Queſtions, they had reach'd the Veſſel, and getting nimbly up the Side, they drew from under their Watch-Coats, their Piſtols and Cutlaſhes, and firſt fir'd upon the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> who were running to ſeize 'em, half unarm'd, as not ſuſpecting any Reſiſtance: Thoſe whoſe Office it was to releaſe the Priſoners under Hatches, did it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by killing the two Centuries that watch'd over 'em; and then coming up with this freſh Recruit ſoon overcame the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and made 'em call for Quarter: Which was not granted till they had thrown down their Arms. When they had ſurrender'd, they chain'd 'em all under Hatches; and ſo the Conquerors became Priſoners, and the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0388001100:50"/>
Priſoners Conquerors. After the Action was over, they look'd after the Dead, which was found to be nine <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and one <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who was ſuppos'd to be kill'd by our own Men, in the firſt Fire.</p>
            <p>Upon this good Succeſs, they having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that there lay a rich Ship in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour before the Town of <hi>Campeche,</hi> they reſolv'd to try their good Fortune farther, which they contriv'd as follows: they hoiſted <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colours, and ſail'd away immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately for the Port of <hi>Campeche,</hi> where they arriv'd by next Morning, ſaluted the Caſtle and Town with ſeven Guns, as Friends, and were paid back the Complement. The Shore was fill'd with Numbers of People, to ſee the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> brought aſhore Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; but they were miſtaken. The Ship which they had a Deſign upon lay about a League from the Town, as having ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd but two Days before, but was to put farther in that very Evening, before the Sea Breeze fail'd; our Men boarded her on the Starboard-ſide, which lay from the Town, and took her, without firing a Gun; cut her Cables, and made out to Sea, before the Town knew what was the matter: But as ſoon as ever they ſmelt the Trick, a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Man of War of thirty Guns (being all that was in the Harbour) ſlip'd her Cables, and crouded all the Sail
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0388001100:51"/>
ſhe cou'd, to come up with us; we finding ſhe gain'd upon us, call'd a Council, and at laſt reſolv'd to bring up moſt of our <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Priſoners bound, and expoſe 'em to the whole Fire of the Enemy. Which ſucceeded accordingly, for the Ship coming cloſe up to us, (without any firing on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide) commanded us to ſtrike. Upon that we order'd the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain to lay before 'em their Condition; which profited little at firſt, but after many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties from them, and Threatnings from us, the others were prevail'd upon to ſheer off, and make towards the Town, while we made the beſt of our Way. But the <hi>Spaniard</hi> making up to the Town again, was met by ſeveral armed Boats, with the Governor himſelf in one of them, who gave a ſtrict Command not to regard any Thing, but uſe all poſſible Means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Ship, and the Pyrates (as they term'd us.) When we perceiv'd the Boats making up to the Ship, and obſerv'd her tack about to give us Chaſe, we gueſs'd at the Matter, and finding ſhe gain'd upon us, we put our ſelves into a Poſture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and propos'd to engage her in the Prize we took laſt, which carry'd twenty Guns: We muſter'd our Men, and found we had ſeventy one; but then we had two hundred <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Priſoners, who, we
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0388001100:52"/>
fear'd, if by any Accident they ſhou'd get looſe, might prove our Ruin; whereupon a Conſult was immediately held to put moſt of them to Death. Upon which the Captain of the firſt Prize ſtood up, and ſaid, (in pretty good <hi>Engliſh)</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you have taken us fairly, and done no more than we our ſelves did to you; now ſeeing that Ship which purſues us, and gains upon us every Moment, is coming in order to fight you, we ſhall run a more certain Danger by it, by being your Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if you expoſe us to the Fire of their Canon, as you did before; and if they do really fire, I may as well take them for an Enemy, as you, ſince we are ſure to receive the moſt Damage. But to make the Matter ſhort, being the Time is ſo, I propoſe to you, that if the Veſſel fires at you, we may reaſonably conclude, they have no manner of Regard for us, ſo we ſhall not have any for them, and, if you'll give us that Liberty, we will freely fight under your Command, and endeavour, as far as in us lies, to defend your Veſſel, as much as if it was our own. This Speech of the Captain's was approv'd of by the reſt of the Priſoners; ſo that at laſt we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to ſet ſixty of them at Liberty, and the reſt faſt bound under Hatches, where we put two Centuries, with two Patareroes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0388001100:53"/>
fix'd, charg'd with ſmall Shot, with Orders, that if there ſeem'd to be any thing like Diſturbance, to fire in upon 'em. The ſixty we choſe out to be aſſiſtant to us, were order'd to the Great Guns, ſo that we ſtill had the Command over 'em, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had no Arms. After we had ſettled every thing, we lay by, (ſeeing it impoſſible to eſcape without fighting) in order for their coming up to us, which they did in a ſhort time, and coming within Hail, they order'd us to ſtrike immediately, and make no Reſiſtance, or elſe they wou'd have no Regard to their Friends on Board us, but ſink or take us, and put every Man of us to Death. Upon which the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain that was our Priſoner, made Anſwer. That if they offer'd to fire a Gun, every <hi>Spaniard</hi> on Board us reſolv'd to fight againſt 'em as Enemies. Which was anſwer'd, They muſt obey the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's Orders, who had juſt left 'em, and was return'd on ſhore. Upon this they fir'd a Broadſide upon us, but we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd it immediately with our ſmall Arms, and great Guns, which were well ply'd by our <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Priſoners. The Fight conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd half an Hour with all the Fierceneſs imaginable; at laſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> prepar'd to board us with his Boats at the ſame Time, but were receiv'd ſo briskly, and ſo da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mag'd
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0388001100:54"/>
by our Hand-Granado's, that they were oblig'd to make to the Ship with great Loſs. The Hand-Granado's ſtood us in great ſtead, for we diſpatch'd three or four of our Men into the Main-Top, who from thence diſcharg'd ſeveral Granado's, that by their own Report kill'd and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above thirty Men. They attempted to board us once again, and came on briskly with firing and loud Shouts, to terrify us; but we return'd 'em their Shouts and firing with Intereſt, for with a lucky Shot we drove away their Main-Maſt, which put 'em into ſtrange Confuſion: This Accident (if we would have laid hold on't) might have given us an Opportunity of out-ſailing 'em; but that was not once thought of, for Deſire of Revenge made us fight like Furies. The next Broad-ſide we gave 'em, ſtruck away their Rudder, which render'd 'em incapable of ſteering their Veſſel, or tacking about: Upon which we perceiving what had happen'd, tack'd about, and with a Broad-ſide that rack'd her fore and aft, kill'd 'em, by their own Confeſſion, ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Men, for it ſplit two of their Guns, whoſe Splinters did moſt of the Execution. Now what we call to <hi>rake fore and aft,</hi> is to lay the Side of our Ship againſt the Enemy's Head or Stern, and fire into 'em, ſo that every Shot goes from one End of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0388001100:55"/>
the Ship to the other, inſtead of going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs, ſo that of Conſequence one Shot that way will do more Damage than ten directly ſide to ſide. The Heat of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> now began to abate, but yet he hector'd as much as ever; at laſt a lucky Shot enter'd her Powder-Room, and blew up her main Deck, with ſeveral <hi>Spaniards,</hi> into the Air; upon which was heard ſuch Groans and Yelling, from wounded and dying Men, that were enough to frighten Men leſs inur'd to ſuch Encounters: With this Succeſs we prepar'd, in the Confuſion, to board them in our turn, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, by ſeeing their Veſſel ſinking; whereupon they ſtruck down their Colours, and ask'd for Quarter, and Help; which we immediately gave 'em, by putting out our Boats, which together with their own, ſav'd all the Men they had left, which were ninety five, out of four hundred and odd.</p>
            <p>This Succeſs fluſh'd us mightily with Hopes of ſucceeding in any Enterprize. We loſt out of our <hi>Spaniards</hi> twenty ſix, and of <hi>Engliſh</hi> nine kill'd, and two wounded, who dy'd the next Day. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were of ſignal Service to us, and fought bravely, even to Deſparation; well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if they ſhou'd be taken (after fighting
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0388001100:56"/>
on our ſide) they muſt all inevitably ſuffer Death: Which prov'd happy for us; for it had been impoſſible for us to have eſcap'd 'em, even if all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on Board us had ſtood neuter.</p>
            <p>After we had clear'd our Veſſel of the Blood and dead Men, and refreſh'd our ſelves, we call'd up our <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Priſoners, that they might refreſh themſelves likewiſe, and return'd the others (who had fought ſo bravely in our Defence) our hearty Thanks; and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain expreſs'd himſelf ſo handſomly, that our Maſter freely offer'd him our Sloop, victual'd and ready fitted up, to do what he thought fit with. Upon this kind Offer the Captain ſmil'd, and told him he would not take it without buying: And as for Money, I have none, (purſued he) but if you'll liſten to a Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem of mine, I'll engage to furniſh you with Money for your Veſſel, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing over and above. With that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to take ſix of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that had fought for us, and in our Long-Boat to go on ſhore to the Governor, and demand a Ranſom for the Priſoners we had taken; which was agreed to: accordingly they went aſhore, and told the Governor, if he did not immediately ſend fifty Dollars a Man, for two hundred and twenty, they wou'd be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0388001100:57"/>
Soul ty'd Back to Back, and thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea. Upon which there was a Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering made through the Town, and the Money rais'd immediately, and in twelve Hours the Captain return'd with 11000 Dollars, gave our Captain 5000, diſtributed 3000 among the Sailors, and kept the reſt for himſelf. The next Day we ſet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that were ſav'd from the Man of War on ſhore, and as many more that were willing, out of the other Ship, and of our own Sloop; ſo that Captain <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi> our friendly <hi>Spaniard,</hi> took his leave of us, with eighty of his Countrymen with Intention for the <hi>South</hi> Sea; and we ſteer'd our Courſe, in our rich Prize, for <hi>Jamaica,</hi> where we ſhar'd it: Every common Sailor had to his Share 800<hi>l.</hi> Moreover the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain order'd me in particular, 200<hi>l.</hi> more, for the Service I did in ſwimming aſhore unperceiv'd, to give 'em Notice.</p>
            <p>After ending his Story, I ask'd him how he had improv'd his Money from that Time? Pſha! (ſays he) that, and five times as much, is gone ſince then. And this is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for Sailors are ſuch Fools, that what they get with the utmoſt Danger, they ſpend as the meaneſt Trifles. We ſail'd before the Wind ſix Days together, towards the Bay, but on the ſeventh, the Clouds
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0388001100:58"/>
darken'd, and the Welkin ſeem'd all on fire, by Times, with Lightning, and the Thunder roar'd louder than ever I heard it in my Life; in ſhort, a dreadful Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane approach'd, which was ſuſpected by a deceitful Calm, and Showers of Rain. Which the inimitable <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> very juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribes.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0388001100:60"/>
that ſteals out of his lurking-place, when the bluſtering Bailiffs are gone out of ſight. About ſix in the Evening, we ſaw a Water-Spout: This is an Aerial Engine, or Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck, that draws up the ſalt Water of the Sea, and diſtils it into freſh Showers of Rain: This Cloud comes down in Form of a Pipe of Lead of a vaſt Thickneſs, and by the Force of the Sun ſucks up a great Quantity of Water. I ſtood an Hour to obſerve it; after it had continu'd about half an Hour in the Water, it drew up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly, by Degrees, till it was loſt in the Clouds; but in the cloſing of the ſame, it ſhut out ſome of the Water, which fell into the Sea again, with a Noiſe like that of Thunder, and occaſion'd a Smoke in the Water, that laſted for a conſiderable Time. The Sailors told me, that theſe Water-Spouts ſometimes did great Damage to Ships that by Calms were too near 'em when they fell. One Fellow told me, that he ſaw a Bark of ſixty Tun ſuck'd out of the Water by one of 'em, which caus'd the breaking of the Spout, and ſunk the Veſſel with the Fall of the Waters. In the <hi>Streights,</hi> when Ships approach theſe airy Engines, they fire off a Gun, and that breaks 'em before they come too near. The Perſon told me, that at the Fall of Water, the Sea was curl'd as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0388001100:61"/>
much as if you had thrown a large Stone into a ſtanding Pond of Water. We have ſometimes at a Diſtance ſeen fourteen or fifteen at a Time at Work, but I never ſaw one ſo large as this.</p>
            <p>In the Evening we caught a ſmall Shark, with two ſucking Fiſhes that ſtuck cloſe to her till laid on the Deck, and then drop'd down of their own Accord. This is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the <hi>Remora</hi> of the Ancients: It is about the Bigneſs of a Mackrel, with a flat Head, and is of a griſtly Subſtance. Theſe ſtick to the ſides of Veſſels very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and ſometimes ſwim upon the Surface of the Water, and are even caught with a naked Hook. I have ſometimes ſeen theſe Fiſhes ſticking to a Log of Wood, in the Water. When we hog'd our Ship, (a Hog is an Inſtrument of ſix Foot ſquare, ſomething like a Harrow, and Stumps of old Brooms fix'd cloſe in the middle part) this is put to the bottom of the Ship, with a Rope before and another aft, fix'd to the Capſtorn, which cleans the Veſſel from all ſorts of Filth. I have ſeen many of 'em in the Hog together, with Barnicles and Oyſters, and ſeveral other Shell-fiſh.</p>

               <hi>October</hi> the 6th, we anchor'd at <hi>Triſt Iſland,</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Campeachy,</hi> and ſent
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0388001100:62"/>
our Men aſhore at <hi>Logwood Creek,</hi> to ſeek for the Logwood-Cutters, who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came on Board. The Bargain was ſoon ſtruck, and in Exchange for our Rum and Sugar, and a little Money, we got in our Lading in eight Days, and ſet ſail for <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica</hi> the 15th Day of <hi>October.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in getting up to <hi>Jamaica</hi> again, generally takes us up two Months, becauſe we are oblig'd to ply it all the way to Windward. One Day it being ſtark calm, I went into the Water to waſh my ſelf, though I was diſſuaded by all the Sailors, by reaſon of that Coaſt being infeſted with Sharks, which ſometimes meet with Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and bite off a Limb: But being there had not been any ſeen that Day, I wou'd venture, but ty'd a Rope about me, for fear of any Accident that might happen, or the Wind ſtriking up of a ſudden. But I had not been long in the Water, before they cry'd from the Gunnel, A Shark! a Shark! but I thinking they had only ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, as ſometimes they do, when any one is in the Water, did not mind 'em, till at laſt they pull'd me by main Force, up the ſide of the Ship; when looking into the Water, I ſaw a ſwinging large Shark, with his white Belly turn'd up in order to bite at me. Upon which I thank'd God and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0388001100:63"/>
good Friends that had prevented him, by ſwiftly pulling me up; though the Rope had rubb'd off the Skin, and ſome part of my Fleſh, with the Force. Now a Shark cannot get his Prey, without firſt turning himſelf upon his Back, becauſe their upper Jaw is much larger than their under: Which often prevents Accidents.</p>
            <p>I one Day went down into the Hold, to bottle off a ſmall Parcel of Wine that I had there, for fear 'twou'd ſowre, which made me in a filthy Pickle: Coming upon Deck again, I wanted to clean my ſelf, but did not care to go into the Water, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo went into the Boat aſtern, that we hoiſted overboard in the Morning, to look after a Wreck that we diſcover'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Water: Being in the Boat, I began to waſh my ſelf, and when I had dreſs'd my ſelf again, I pull'd a Book out of my Pocket, and ſate reading in the Boat; when, before I was aware, a Storm began to riſe, ſo that I cou'd not get up the Ship-ſide, as uſual, but call'd for the Ladder of Ropes, that hangs over the Ship's Quarter, in order to get up that way; but whether it was not faſten'd above, or whether it broke through Rottenneſs, as being ſeldom us'd, I can't tell, but down I fell into the Sea; and though the Ship (as they told me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards)
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0388001100:64"/>
tack'd about to take me up, if it was poſſible; yet I loſt ſight of 'em, thro' the Duskineſs of the Evening, and the Storm together. Now I had the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Fears that cou'd ever poſſeſs any one in my Condition: I was forc'd to drive with the Wind, which ſate (by good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune) with the Current, and having kept my ſelf above Water, as near as I could gueſs in this Fright, four Hours, I felt my Feet every now and then touch Ground; and at laſt, by a great Wave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was thrown and left upon the Sand; yet it being dark, I knew not what to do; but I got up and walk'd, as well as my tir'd Limbs wou'd let me; and every now and then was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the Waves, but not high enough to waſh me away.</p>
            <p>When I had got far enough, as I thought, to be out of Danger, I cou'd not diſcover any thing of Land, and I immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectur'd that it was but ſome Bank of Sand, that the Sea wou'd overflow at high Tide: Whereupon I ſate down to reſt my weary Limbs, and fit my ſelf for Death, for that was all I cou'd expect, in my own Opinion. Then all my Sins came flying in my Face, which I repented of with all the Sincerity imaginable: I offer'd up my fervent Prayers to our Almighty Creator, not for my Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0388001100:65"/>
(becauſe I did not expect any ſuch Thing) but for all my paſt Offences; and I may really ſay, I expected my Diſſolution with a Calmneſs that made me think I had made my Peace with Heaven. At laſt I fell aſleep, (tho' I try'd all I could againſt it, by riſing up and walking, till I was oblig'd to lie down again.) In the Morning when I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wak'd, I was amaz'd to find my ſelf among four or five very low ſandy Iſlands, but all ſeparated half a Mile or more (as I gueſs'd) by the Sea. With that I began to be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle chearful, and walk'd about to ſee if I could find any thing that was eatable, but to my great Grief I found nothing but a few Eggs, that I was oblig'd to eat raw; this laid my Condition before my Eyes in a moſt horrid Manner, and the Fear of ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeem'd to me to be worſe than that of drowning; and oft did I wiſh that the Sea had ſwallow'd me, rather than thrown me on this deſolate Iſland; for I cou'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the Evenneſs of 'em, that they were not inhabited either by Man, or Beaſt, or any Thing elſe, but Rats, and ſeveral ſorts of Fowl.</p>
            <p>Upon this Iſland there was ſome few Buſhes of a Wood they call'd <hi>Burton</hi> Wood, which us'd to be my Shelter at Night; but to compleat my Miſery, there was not to be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0388001100:66"/>
found one drop of freſh Water on the Iſland; ſo that I was forc'd to drink my own Urine for two or three Days together; which made my Skin come off like the Peal of a boil'd Codlin. At laſt my Miſery ſo encreas'd, that I was often in the Mind to put an end to my wretched Life, but deſiſted, on the Opinion that I had of ſome Alligator, or other voracious Creature, coming to do it for me. Strange Circumſtances indeed! to wiſh to be devour'd alive, as a Mitigation of my Misfortunes.</p>
            <p>I had liv'd a Week here upon Eggs only, when, by good Fortune, upon a Buſh I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd a Booby ſitting; I ran immediately, as faſt as I cou'd, and with a Stick knock'd him down: I never conſider'd whether it was proper to eat or no, but I ſuck'd the Blood, and eat the Fleſh, with ſuch a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as none can expreſs, but them that have felt the Pain of Hunger to the ſame Degree as my ſelf. After I had devour'd this Banquet, I walk'd about, and diſcover'd many more of theſe Birds, which I ſlew.</p>
            <p>Now my Stomach being pretty well appeas'd, I began to conſider whether I could not, with two Sticks, make a Fire, as I had ſeen Blacks in <hi>Jamaica:</hi> I try'd with all the Wood I could get, and at laſt happily did it. This done, I gather'd ſome
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0388001100:67"/>
Sticks, and made a Fire, pick'd ſeveral of my Boobies, and broil'd 'em, as well as I cou'd; and now I reſolv'd to come to an Allowance. This Bird is a Water Fowl, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bigneſs of a large Crow; of grey Colour; it has a long ſtrong Bill, and Feet like a Duck, and its Fleſh ſeem'd to me to taſte ſomething like a Duck's, but ſtronger, and a little Fiſhy: And it is ſuch a Booby, that it will not get out of your Way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beating.</p>
            <p>At Night I and the reſt of my Fellow-Inhabitants, had a great Storm of Rain and Thunder, with the redeſt Lightning I had ever ſeen, which well waſh'd us all, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; as for my ſelf, my Cloaths (which were only a pair of thin Shoes and Thread Stockings, and a Cotton Waſtcoat and Breeches) were ſoundly wet; but I had this Happineſs, to find in the Morning ſeveral Cavities of Rain-Water, which put in my Head a Thought of making a deep Well, or hollow Place, that I might have Water continually by me; which I brought to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this Manner: I took a Piece of Wood I found on the Iſland, and pitch'd upon a Place under a Burton-Tree, where with my Hands and the Stick together, I dug a Hole, or Well, big enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Hogſhead of Water, then put in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0388001100:68"/>
Stones and pa v'd it, and got in and ſtamp'd 'em down ha rd all round, and with my Stick beat th e ſides cloſe, ſo that I made it capable of holding Water for a long Time.</p>
            <p>But now the Difficulty was, how to get the Water there, which at laſt I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd very well, for with my Shirt (which was pretty fine) I effected it, by ſoaking it in Water for ſome Time, and then afterwards it wou'd bear it very well; ſo with this Holland-Bucket I cou'd carry two Gallons of Water at a Time, which wou'd not leak out above a Pint, in two hundred Yards; ſo in two Days Time I had fill'd my Well.</p>
            <p>Now I began to think of Life again for a while, for I had ready broil'd forty of theſe Boobies, deſigning to allow my ſelf half a one a Day. I alſo made my ſelf a Cu pboard of Earth, by mixing Water with it, which was four Foot in Length, three in Heighth, and two in Breadth, though it laſted but four Days, the Sun drying it ſo faſt, that it crack'd, and afterwards fell in pieces. What moſt amaz'd me, and pleas'd me together, was, that my Boobies continu'd ſweet without the leaſt Taint. I had a ſmall <hi>Ovid</hi> printed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0388001100:69"/>
by <hi>Elziver,</hi> which I had by good Fortune put in my Breeches Pocket, when I was going up the Ladder of Ropes, and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſs'd cloſe in my Pocket, was not quite ſpoil'd, but only the Cover off, and ſtain'd a little with the Wet. This was a great Mitigation of my Misfortunes, for I could entertain my ſelf in this Book, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Burton-Buſh, till I fell aſleep. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd always in good Health, only a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle troubled with the Head-Ach, for want of a Hat, which I loſt in the Water, in falling down from the Ladder of Ropes. But I remedy'd this as well a I could, by ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering a Parcel of Chicken-Weed (which grows there in Plenty) and ſtrewing it over the Burton-Buſhes, under which I ſate. Nay, at laſt, finding my Time might be longer there than I expected, I tore off one of the Sleeves of my Shirt, and lin'd a wooden Cap, that I had made of green ſprigs, and twiſted with the green Bark that I peel'd off, ſo that if I had been ſeen in this Figure, I ſhou'd have appear'd like a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with the Basket of a Cudgel upon his Head.</p>
            <p>One Day coming from waſhing my ſelf, (which I us'd often to do to cool me) I heard a flouncing in the Water, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Head, to ſee from whence the Noiſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0388001100:70"/>
came, I ſaw the oddeſt Fiſh, I believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ever was known. It had (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) chas'd ſome other Fiſh very eagerly, and run it ſelf too far on the Sand, and the Tide being almoſt at the loweſt, it had left it there. It was (as near as I cou'd gueſs) about fifteen Foot long; it had a Head like a Horſe, and out of the Mouth came two Horns curl'd like a Ram's Horn, only twice as large; it had but one Eye, and that was at the Extremity of the Noſe; it ſeem'd, as it flounc'd, to be ſomething of a changeable Aſh-colour, with a Tail that taper'd to the End in a ſharp Point: it look'd ſo terrible to me, that I was afraid to approach it; as it labour'd it ſeem'd to groan; it lay in this Hole of Water half an Hour, with its Body in, and its Tail out; and as ſoon as the Tide came up to it, it ſhak'd its Tail to and fro, as a Dog does when he ſeems pleas'd, all the while it felt the Water; it ſtruggled but now and then, and at laſt, when the Water was pretty high, it turn'd its Head, and made a Noiſe ſomething like the Clucking of a Hen with Chickens, but louder; and when it had Water enough to ſwim away, it lay moving up and down a quarter of an Hour, being as I ſuppoſe hurt with its ſtruggling. A Gentleman of my Acquaintance advis'd me to leave this Deſcription out; for, ſays
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0388001100:71"/>
he, No Body will believe it. I reply'd, I did not care for that, as I was ſatisfied in my ſelf it was true.</p>
            <p>I had been here now a Month, by my Reckoning, and in that Time my Skin look'd as if it had been rubb'd over with Walnut-ſhells. I had a Mind ſeveral Times to have ſwam to one of the other Iſlands; but as they look'd only like Heaps of Sand, I thought I had got the beſt Birth, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented my ſelf with my own Station. Boobies I could get enough, (who build on the Ground) and another Bird that lays the Eggs which I us'd to eat, but I never ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd to taſte of 'em, though as their Eggs were good, we may ſuppoſe their Fleſh was ſo too: But however, I was ſo well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with my Boobies, that I did not care to try Experiments.</p>
            <p>This Iſland which I was upon, ſeem'd to me to be about two Miles in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and was almoſt round, and on the <hi>Weſt</hi> ſide there's a good Anchoring-place, for the Water is very deep, within two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom of the Shore. God forgive me, but I often wiſh'd to have had Companions in my Misfortune, and hop'd every Day either to have ſeen ſome Veſſel come that way, or a Wreck, where, perhaps, I might
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0388001100:72"/>
have found ſome Neceſſaries which I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But I wou'd often check my ſelf in theſe Cogitations, as not becoming a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; yet they wou'd as often awake in my Mind, in ſpight of all my Devotion and other good Thoughts; it being natural to deſire Company. I us'd to fancy, that if I ſhou'd be forc'd to ſtay there long, I ſhou'd forget my Speech; ſo I us'd to talk aloud, ask my ſelf Queſtions, and anſwer 'em; but if any Body had been by to have heard me, they wou'd certainly have thought me bewitch'd, I us'd to ask my ſelf ſuch odd Queſtions. All this while I cou'd not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my ſelf where I was, or how near any inhabited Place.</p>
            <p>One Morning (which I took to be the 8th of <hi>November)</hi> a violent Storm aroſe, which continu'd till Noon, when in the mean time I obſerv'd a Bark labouring with the Waves for ſeveral Hours, and at laſt, with the Violence of the Tempeſt, was perfectly thrown out of the Water upon the ſhore, within a quarter of a Mile from the Place where I obſerv'd 'em. I ran to ſee if there was any Body I could be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting to, where I found four Men (being all that was in the Veſſel) buſy about ſaving what they could out of her: When I came up with 'em, and hail'd 'em in <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0388001100:73"/>
they ſeem'd mightily ſurpriz'd; they ask'd me how I came there, and how long I had been there? When I told 'em my Story, they were all mightily concern'd for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as well as for me, for they found there was no Poſſibility of getting their Bark off the Sands, being the Wind had forc'd her ſo far: With that we began to bemoan one another's Misfortunes; but I muſt confeſs to you, without lying, I was never more rejoic'd in my whole Life; for they had on Board plenty of every thing for a Twelvemonth, and not any thing ſpoil'd. Their Lading (which was Logwood) they had thrown over board to lighten their Ship; which was the Occaſion of the Wind forcing her ſo far: Had they kept in their Lading, they wou'd have bulg'd in the Sands half a quarter a Mile from the Place where they did, and the Sea flying over 'em, wou'd not only have ſpoil'd their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, but perhaps been the Death of 'em all. By theſe Men I underſtood where we were, <hi>viz.</hi> upon one of the Iſles of <hi>Alcranes,</hi> which are five Iſlands, or rather large Banks of Sand; (for there is not a Tree, nor Buſh, upon any but that where we were) they lie in the Latitude of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Degrees <hi>North,</hi> twenty five Leagues from <hi>Jucatan,</hi> and about ſixty from <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachy</hi> Town. We work'd as faſt as we
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0388001100:74"/>
cou'd, and got out every Thing that wou'd be uſeful to us, before Night. We had ſix Barrels of ſalt Beef, three of Pork, two of Peaſe, and two of Flower, and eleven Barrels of Bisket; a ſmall Copper, and an Iron Pot; ſeveral wearing Cloaths, and a ſpare Hat, which I wanted mightily: We had beſides, ſeveral Cags of Rum, and one of Brandy, and a Cheſt of Sugar, with many other Things of Uſe: ſome Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, and one Fowling-piece. We took off the Sails from the Yards, and with ſome pieces of Timber erected a Tent big enough to hold twenty Men, under which we put their Beds, that we got from the Bark. 'Tis true we had no Shelter from the Weather, for the Trees were ſo low that they were of no Uſe to us. I now thought my ſelf in a Palace, and was as merry, as if I had been at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> or even at home in my own Country: I cou'd joak now and then, and tell a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tale. In ſhort, when we had been there ſome Time, we began to be very eaſy, and to wait contentedly, till Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhou'd fetch us out of this Iſland. The Bark lay upon the Sands, fifty Yards from the Water when at the higheſt, ſo that I us'd to lie in her Cabin, by reaſon there was no more Beds aſhore, than was for my four Companions, <hi>viz. Thomas</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0388001100:75"/>
               <hi>Randal,</hi> of <hi>Cork</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (whoſe Bed was largeſt, which he did me the Favour to ſpare a part of now and then, when the Wind was high, and I did not care to lie on Board) <hi>Richard White,</hi> of <hi>Port Royal, William Muſgrave,</hi> of <hi>Kingſton</hi> in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> and <hi>Ralph Middleton,</hi> of—Theſe Men, with eight others, ſet out of <hi>Port Royal</hi> about a Month after us, bound for the ſame Place: But thoſe others lying aſhore, and wandring too far up in the Country, were met, as 'tis ſuppos'd, by ſome <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> who ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'em: Yet by all Appearance they fought deſperately, for when Mr. <hi>Randal</hi> and Mr. <hi>Middleton</hi> went to ſeek for 'em, they found all the eight dead, with fifteen <hi>Indians,</hi> and two <hi>Spaniards;</hi> all the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> had ſeveral Cuts in their Heads, Arms, Breaſts, &amp;c. that made it very plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, they had ſold their Lives dearly. They were too far up in the Country, to bring down their Dead; ſo they were oblig'd to dig a Hole in the Earth, and put 'em in, as they lay in their Cloaths. As for the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they ſtrip'd 'em, and left 'em above Ground, as they found 'em, and made all the haſte they could to imbark, for fear of any other unlucky Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident that might happen. They ſet ſail
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0388001100:76"/>
as ſoon as ever they came on board, and made the beſt of their way for <hi>Jamaica,</hi> till they were overtaken by the Storm that ſhipwreck'd 'em on <hi>Make Shift Iſland</hi> (as I had nam'd it.) When I told them of the ſtrange Fiſh I had ſeen, there was not any of 'em, but Mr. <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> that had ſeen it, and he told me, when he was a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in <hi>Mexico,</hi> he had ſeen one there, and they call'd it the <hi>Ram Fiſh;</hi> but he told me I was miſtaken concerning the Eyes, for they were on the top of the Head, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall, not bigger than a Musket-ball; and that which I took for an Eye, was a Hole that they ſometimes ſpouted Water through. This that he ſaw at <hi>Mexico,</hi> was carried about for a Shew in a Cart, but it was but eight Foot and a half in Length, and was by Order of the Viceroy ſent two Leagues into the Bay, to be bury'd, for it ſtunk ſo intolerably, they were afraid it wou'd breed a Plague.</p>
            <p>Now we had all Manner of Fiſhing-Tackle with us, but we wanted a Boat to go a little way from Shore to catch Fiſh, therefore we ſet our Wits to work, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make ſome manner of Engine, and at laſt we pitch'd upon this odd Project: We took ſix Casks, and tarr'd 'em all over,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0388001100:77"/>
then ſtop'd up the Bungs with Cork, and nail'd 'em cloſe down with a piece of tarr'd Canvas, theſe ſix Casks we ty'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſome of the Cords of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and upon them we plac'd the Skuttles of the Deck, and fix'd them, and made it ſo ſtrong, that two Men might eaſily ſit upon 'em, but for fear a Storm ſhou'd hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, we ty'd to one end of her a Coil or two of ſmall Rope, of five hundred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom long, which we fix'd to a Stake on the Shore: Then two of 'em went out, (as for my part, I was no Fiſherman) in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee what Succeſs they ſhou'd have, but return'd with only one <hi>Nurſe,</hi> a Fiſh ſo called, about two Foot long, ſomething like a Shark, only its Skin is very rough, and, when dry, will do the ſame Office as a Seal-skin. The ſame boil'd in Lemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juice, is the only Remedy in the World for the Scurvy, by applying ſome of the Skin to the Calfs of your Legs, and rubbing your Body with ſome of the Liquor, once or twice. We ſent out our Fiſhermen the next Day again, and they return'd with two old <hi>Wives,</hi> and a young <hi>Shark,</hi> about two Foot long; which we dreſs'd for Dinner, and they prov'd excellent Eating. In the Morning following, we kill'd a young <hi>Seal,</hi> with our Fowling-Piece; but firſt ſhe was
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0388001100:78"/>
ſo kind to give me a Blow on the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, that cut the Skin, and bled very much; which was done with her Fins, for as they run towards the Water, they throw backwards the Gravel, as Horſes do when they gallop hard; this we ſalted, and it eat very well, after lying two or three Days in the Brine.</p>

happens) ſtole inſenſibly on us all. I, as being the youngeſt, began to reflect on my ſad Condition, in ſpending my Youth on a Barren Land, without Hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever redeem'd. Whereupon, Mr. <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> being the Eldeſt, roſe up and made the following Speech, as nigh as I can remember.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Falconer,</hi> and my Fellow-Sufferers; but 'tis to you (pointing at me) that I chiefly addreſs my Speech, being you ſeem to deſpair of a Redemption from this Place, (as you call it) more than any other of the ſame Condition. Is not the Providence of a Power Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme ſhewn in every Accident in the Life of Man; even you your ſelf, how much better is your Condition now, than you cou'd have imagin'd it wou'd have been a Month ago? There is a Virtue in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Suffering, and to repine, ſeems to doubt of the All-ſeeing Power, which regulates our Actions. If you ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of your deſerving (as a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for any Crime you have committed) what has happen'd, why do you not with a contrite Heart, lift up your Voice
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0388001100:81"/>
to Heaven, and ſincerely ask Forgiveneſs of all your paſt Offences, and that Way free your ſelf of thoſe groſs Errors that are crept into your weak Faith. Think you that the Divine Providence that caſt <hi>Jonas</hi> from the Bowels of the Whale, has not that Retentive Power ſtill left, to aid and fetch us from this Place?</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, tho' touch'd with what he ſaid, I could not forbear ſmiling at the Word <hi>Retentive,</hi> which brought to my Mind an Image very diverting in an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that happen'd once to me in <hi>England,</hi> ſince my Sea Adventures, and perhaps one Time or other I may communicate to my Friends, which I'm ſure will divert 'em; for my living on Shore for theſe ſix Years laſt paſt, has been as extraordinary as my Adventures at Sea.</p>
            <p>Here (purſu'd he) we have every Thing that can be requir'd to ſatisfy Nature; we have Beds to lie on, and a Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Weather; we have Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for a Twelvemonth, and if we ſhou'd continue here a longer Time, we need not fear ſtarving, the very Iſland produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing wherewithal to ſupport Nature, as

Eggs and Fowls; and tho' there is no River or Rivulet of freſh Water, yet it rains ſo frequently, we need not fear even that, being we have Veſſels enough to ſave it in: You have the leaſt Reaſon to ſpurn at Providence of any one here, that had only a Hole in the Earth to ſave your Water, which had not laſted two Days longer, before we (very happily for you) were thrown on Shore. Is there not a Providence in being thrown on Land, when you expected Drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Morning dawn'd, which happen'd otherwiſe? Is there not a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in getting Food, when you expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to ſtarve? Is there not a Providence in getting Fire by rubbing two Sticks, which you know you could not effect ſince, tho' we have all endeavour'd at it? Was it not a Providence, that your Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies remain'd ſweet, even till the Day that we came here? And was it not a Providence that we were thrown here, which brought you all Sorts of Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (I mean all that is neceſſary) with Flint, and Steel, and other Utenſils? And can you then doubt of a farther Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0388001100:83"/>
that have had all theſe? Beſides, even Company is ſome Allay to Sorrow, you were alone before, and had only your ſelf to talk too. Our Bark is ſtrong and firm, and by Degrees, I don't doubt but with Time and much Labour, to get her into the Water again. I have been a Board her this Morning when you were all aſleep, and examin'd her carefully In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and Out, and fancy our Liberty may ſoon be effected; I only wonder we have never thought before of clearing the Sand from our Veſſel, which once done, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we may Launch her out into deep Water; we have all our Tackling, Sails and Maſts entire, without Damage; I don't deſpair of the Mercy of God in working our Deliverance, whoſe Ways are paſt the Knowledge of us poor inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Mortals.

               <hi>Straits</hi> of <hi>Elſenor</hi> and <hi>Helſinburgh,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meeting any thing material; when one Evening it began to Thunder, Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and Rain prodigiouſly; the Storm was ſo violent, that we expected every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when we ſhould be drove on Shore on the Coaſt of <hi>Sweedland,</hi> or <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> and be daſh'd to Pieces. The Storm continu'd ſo long, that all our Maſts came by the Board, our Veſſel ſprung a Leak, and the Water gain'd upon us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Moment; at laſt it overpower'd us ſo much, that we left Pumping, as believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impoſſible to ſave ourſelves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended our Souls to the Mercy of the Lord. At laſt our Ship ſunk down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and moſt of our Men with it; but I and two more had the good Fortune to lay hold of the Main-Maſt, (that had been cut above Deck, being it was ſprung below, and thrown Over-board to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any Danger) which was tangled in ſome of the Cordage; but the Ship ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downright, with the Rope that was turn'd to the Main-Maſt, gave it ſuch a Tug, that pull'd it under Water; but afterwards looſing or ſlipping off by good
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0388001100:85"/>
Fortune, it roſe with two of us again, but the third was never ſeen after. The other that ſav'd himſelf upon the Maſt, was the Maſter, a Man about Sixty Years old, who held pretty well for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an Hour, but at laſt thro' Weakneſs and Age (recommending his Soul to God) fell off; but yet call'd for Help, and I being willing to give, laid hold of him, which I had no ſooner done, but he graſp'd at me, and laying faſt hold of the Skirt of my Waſtcoat, (having never a Coat on) pull'd me off the Maſt; but with his Weight and ſome Strugling I made to ſave my ſelf, my Skirt rip'd off, and the Maſter ſunk to the Bottom, and I by good Fortune laid hold of the Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hung to the Maſt; ſo once more got on ſtride it, but with little Hopes of Life: yet doing my Endeavour to ſave my ſelf, but with a Reſignation to the Will of Heaven. At laſt, after being toſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about for two or three Hours more, the End of the Maſt ruſh'd with ſuch Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence againſt a Rock, (as I ſuppos'd) that with the Shock I was thrown off; but laid hold of ſome of the Cordage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0388001100:86"/>
and held faſt till it fix'd it ſelf in ſome of the craggy Cliffs of the Rock.</p>
            <p>By this Time the Tempeſt was very much abated, and the Waves not daſhing ſo often, nor ſo fierce, I found that the Maſt hung on the craggy Clifts of the Rock, which I climb'd up as faſt as I could, leaſt another Wave ſhould daſh me againſt it, and beat my Brains out. After I had got as high as I could, and out of Danger of the Waves, I kneel'd down and return'd Thanks to the Almighty for my wonderful Deliverance; which was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful indeed! For tho' the Maſt beat ſo often againſt the Rock, yet I eſcap'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſo much as bruis'd. When I had poured out the Fullneſs of my Soul to the All-ſeeing Power, that had protected me from ſuch an imminent Danger, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd my ſelf to ſleep, but with a Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wonderful, (even to my ſelf) won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in every Circumſtance, that the Almighty Providence ſhould chuſe me out of thirty poor Souls that periſh'd in the ſtormy Deep, for a Monument of his Mercy. I ſlept, but yet my Dreams were troubled; I thought in my Sleep, I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0388001100:87"/>
was caſt on Shore upon a Barren Rock, where there was not a Creature but my ſelf, no Food, nor any Thing to ſuſtain Nature; which prov'd too true. I was awak'd by ſomething that lick'd my Face, which in my Fright I laid hold on, but ſoon let it go again upon finding it hairy, which ſtartled me very much; and tho' it was ſtill dark, I could not go to ſleep again for the Concern I was in, for fear of ſome devouring Creature ſhould come and ſeize me. I liſtened, and obſerved the Storm was laid, and the Dawn approaching, I began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my Mind, and to put my Truſt in him, that had hitherto preſerved me.</p>
            <p>When it came to be light enough to perceive any Object, I roſe up and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to view the Place; when, to my great Surprize, I found it to be only a large Rock, about half a Mile in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference as near as I could gueſs; but the North Part ſo inacceſſible, there was no getting to the Top of it: Looking about me, I ſaw coming fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards me, a large Bitch, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0388001100:88"/>
was the Creature had awak'd me by licking my Face. I muſt confeſs I was ſurprized and pleas'd, and made much of my new Companion. I hop'd from it I ſhould find ſome humane Creatures; but ſearching about and not meeting with any, I was more grieved than before; yet ſtill I reſign'd my ſelf to the Will of him that ſees all Things, and knew it was in his Power to fetch me out of Darkneſs and the Shadow of Death. In walking up and down in a little Cavity of the Rock, I met with ſeven young ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Puppies, that I found belong'd to the Bitch my Companion, for ſhe gave them ſuck, which I ſtay'd a little while to obſerve. Then a Thought came into my Head, that this might be ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort for Fiſhermen, and I ſhould very ſhortly ſee ſome that would take me from this deſolate Place.</p>
            <p>I began to ſearch about for ſomething to ſuſtain Nature, but could find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſome <hi>Perriwinkles,</hi> and other little Shell-fiſh, which I ventured to feed upon, for now I began to be very hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry. I wonder'd mightily at my poor
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0388001100:89"/>
Bitch, how ſhe got Food to ſupport her ſelf, and her ſeven young Ones. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſhe uſed to leave me two or three times a Day, but return'd in a quarter of an Hour. One Day I had the Curioſity to watch her, but ſhe went ſo faſt, that I could not come up to her; but ſtill I follow'd, and at laſt came to the Point of a Rock where ſhe went down, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing below, ſaw her feeding upon a dead <hi>Seal;</hi> but how it came there I could not ſuppoſe, neither could I go down the Rock to ſee farther, it being ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Place: When ſhe had eat her fill, ſhe came up again, and went to give her young Ones ſuck. I was mightily put to it for Water, tho' there was good Quantities in ſeveral Cavities of the Rock, but ſo hard to come at, that ſometimes I ventured breaking my Neck to get it; beſides, I could not expect that would always laſt, for the Sun was pretty warm, tho' not intolerable. I had in my Pocket a Knife and Fork and a Caſe of Lancets, but they were ruſted by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wet, and of no uſe to me, for I could get nothing to exerciſe 'em on;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0388001100:90"/>
indeed my Fork ſerv'd me to twiſt out my Perriwinkles.</p>
            <p>I had been here now fifteen Days, and nothing to feed on but theſe ſort of Shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh; yet ſtill my Strength and Health continued to a Miracle: I ſlep'd well, tho' my Bed was ſomething hard: It was compos'd of part of the Rigging that came on Shore with the Maſt, which I had untwiſted, and pull'd into <hi>Oakham,</hi> and laid it under an hollow Part of the Rock, where no Rain or Wind could hurt me, unleſs it blew hard South, which when it did, would force a little into my Bed-Chamber.</p>
            <p>Looking out one Day I ſaw a Boat coming towards my Rocky Iſland, the ſight rais'd my Spirits wonderfully, but obſerving her narrowly, I found ſhe was only driving, by the Wind and Tide, without any one in her: However I got down my Rock, and waited for her coming on Shore, which ſhe did within twenty Yards of me; I immediately got in her to rumage her, and, ſuprizing Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence! found twenty dry'd Fiſh, a Salt-Box fill'd with Bisket, and about half a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0388001100:91"/>
Pint of Brandy in a Bottle. After gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God Thanks with great Sincerity of Soul, I fell to, and eat heartily. There were two Oars in the Boat, a Boat-Hook, a ſmall Fiſher-Net, and a Tinder-Box, with a Grapling Iron and Rope for a Cable: Upon this I began to be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſy, and thought my ſelf to be in a happy Condition: I brought my Fiſh on Shore, and ſtow'd it in my Bed-Chamber, and over it, (for fear of my Bitch,) put ſeveral Pieces of Ropes. I had a Tinder Box, and could ſtrike a Light, but had no Candle to burn nor any Proviſion to dreſs.</p>
            <p>After I had ſettled every Thing as I would have it, I reſolv'd to take my Boat and go round the Rock, to ſee if I could diſcover any Thing on the other ſide of the inacceſſible Part. Whereupon I took two of my dry'd Fiſh, and Half a Dozen Biskets, and put my ſelf on Board; but my poor Bitch came to the Shore Side, and took on ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, that I went and took her in. I row'd half round, (as near as I could gueſs) the firſt Day; but what made me
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0388001100:92"/>
ſo long was, that in ſome Places, I was oblig'd to row half a League from Shore, to avoid ſome Shallows which lay out towards the North Eaſt ſide. I ventured to lie in my Boat all Night, and the next Morning went onward in my Voyage, and at laſt came to that Part of the Rock that I could not get over when I was a Shore. Here I found upon the Ground a Neſt of Eggs, about the Bigneſs of a Duck Egg, yet I could not diſcover what Fowl own'd them; but I took 'em all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and ventured to ſuck one of them, which I found as pleaſant as a new laid Hen Egg. Here the Bitch grew very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, and by her whining and fruitleſs Endeavours to paſs the Rock, (which was Perpendicular) let me underſtand ſhe wanted to be with her Puppies. Finding nothing here for my Benefit, but my Eggs, I got on Board, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to go round, which I did, till I came to the Place where the Seal lay that my Bitch found, but it ſtunk abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably; yet ſhe fell to, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eat, ran up the Rock, and ſo (as I ſuppoſe,) to her Puppies. I went on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0388001100:93"/>
Board again; but there aroſe ſuch a Fog of a ſuddain, that I could hardly ſee the Length of the Boat, ſo rather choſe to go back again than venture farther out of my Knowledge, which I did in a little time, the Sea being higher over the Sand, and arrived at my own Habitation.</p>
            <p>I pull'd up my Boat as high as I could, and went on Shore, and coming to viſit my young Companions found the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt dead for want of the Dam, which I immediately took, cut open and flay'd off the Skin, when after being dry'd, I made me a Cap of, by cutting it in form, and ſewing it together with ſome fine Rope Yarn that I twiſted on pupoſe, and my Fork I us'd inſtead of a Needle. The Fat ſerv'd me to make Candles in this Manner, by pulling to Pieces ſome Rope Yarn and twiſting it hard; then I ſtruck a Light, and with an Egg-Shell heated my Fat, and drew the Rope Yarn thro' it, ſo I provided my ſelf with a new ſort of Candle. But then I had but a ſmall Piece of Match, and when that ſhould be gone, I ſhould be at a ſtrange loſs how to light my Candle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0388001100:94"/>
Finding my Proviſion decreaſe, I came to an Allowance of a Quarter of a Fiſh a Day, and Half a Bisket, and not to touch that if I could get any Shell-fiſh, which began to be ſcarce too, for ſome Days I could not find above Ten or Twelve, and when I came firſt there, I us'd to take 'em up by Handfuls. Upon this I began to reflect, that Winter was approaching, and conſequently very cold Weather; and then perhaps I ſhould not get any Food; I reſolved within my ſelf to venture in my Boat, and ſail which way the Wind ſhould direct me, but then I was put to it for a Sail, (for we had cut off the Yards and Sails of the Main Maſt, before we threw it over Board) but at laſt I thought of a White Dimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Waſtcoat that I wore, which was lin'd with Linnen, this I unript and ſew'd together again, ſo pieced the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Outſides, and made me a tolerable Sail. But in the mean time the Wind blew ſo high, that I durſt not venture out; and continued ſo long, that my Proviſion was diminiſh'd to two Fiſh, which almoſt put me to my Wits End.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0388001100:95"/>
Shell-Fiſh were not to be had. So at laſt I reſolv'd to kill one of my Bitch's Whelps; which I did, made a Fire with ſome Boards I found at the Bottom of my Boat, and roaſted it; 'twas palatable and eat wonderfully well, they being not two Months old.</p>
            <p>I don't queſtion but you'll all laugh at me, when I ſhall tell you that it went very much againſt me to kill this harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Creature; but my Neceſſity had no Law; beſides, I had obſerv'd but two Days before, that the Seal, which was the Dam's Food, was gnaw'd to the Bones. In ſhort, after ſome Strugglings with my ſelf, I kill'd five of the ſix, and ſalted two of 'em; for after eating my Biskets out of the Salt-Box, I found a Handful or two of Salt at the Bottom, which I made uſe of in that Manner. The Intrails I boil'd, and gave to the Dam and other Puppy, who eat of it heartily, making no Scruple tho' their own Fleſh and Blood. The ſixth and laſt Puppy I reſolv'd not to kill at all if I could help it, it being ſo like the Dam, and wou'd always be with me if it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0388001100:96"/>
could, when the others would only play about the Hole where they lay.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, I began to find the Weather cold, and ſo reſolv'd to ſet ſail in my Boat, with my two Companions, my Bitch and Puppy; and on the 1ſt of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> after being on the Rock from <hi>May</hi> the 30th, I ſet ſail with the Wind about N. E. a middling Gale, and ſteering with my other Oar; for you muſt know my Boat-Hook was my Maſt, and a piece of ſlit Wood that I ſav'd from the Fire was my Yard; ſo that I cou'd make ſhift to ply it to Windward upon Occaſion, but was reſolv'd to ſail before the Wind till I diſcover'd Land; but my Boat being pretty large, and my Sail but ſmall, I could not make my Way as I might have done with a Sail fitted to the Boat, ſo that I could not diſcover Land that Night, but ſail'd on till about Midnight; then I was ſo fatigu'd, that in Spite of my ſelf, I was oblig'd to lie along in the Boat, and fell aſleep, and ſlept till I was awaken'd by a Fiſherman in a Boat, whom I underſtood not; but found by his Dialect to be a <hi>Dane.</hi> I gave him
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0388001100:97"/>
to underſtand my Condition, by ſpeaking and Signs together, which he ſeem'd to be ſorry for by beating his Breaſt, and ſhaking his Head.</p>
            <p>He carry'd me a-Shore to a Village, where they made very much of me, and gave me Cloaths; but I would not ſtir without my Dogs. My Boat was ſold, and the Money gave me, for my own Uſe. After I had ſtay'd at the Village three Days, I was carry'd to <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> the Factor for ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, who made a Gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for me which amounted to twenty ſeven Pounds in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money. The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſent a Perſon to me, who underſtood <hi>Engliſh</hi> very well, and took down the Particulars of my Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Language, that I ſaw afterwards printed there; but no one could ever fix upon the Rock that I liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on. One ſaid it was ſuch a One, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a One; and ſome conjectur'd it to be a Part of the Main Land of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> which I ſhould have found if I had ventured further when hinder'd by the Fog.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0388001100:98"/>
But I forgot to tell you, that by Printing this Account, a Man came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Boat, that he ſaid he had loſt by the Careleſſneſs of a Boy, to whom he had given it in Charge; who neglecting to faſten it on Shore, it drove out to Sea, and came where I had the good Fortune to meet with it, or rather guided by the Eye of Providence, to be the Means or Inſtrument of ſaving my Life; which, but for that, I muſt have inevitably loſt. The Fiſherman that own'd the Boat, had a New One given him in the Room on't, and to the Value of five Pounds for the Things it contain'd.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman that was order'd to take the Notes mention'd above, brought me a Hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi> Guineas, collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Merchants and Gentlemen of the City. The King likewiſe order'd me a Hundred more from his Privy Purſe; ſo that in <hi>November</hi> the 18th, I went on Board an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, call'd the <hi>Happy,</hi> Captain <hi>John Gibſon</hi> Commander. We immediately ſet ſail for <hi>London,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>Debtford, December</hi> the 25th, being <hi>Chriſtmaſs-Day,</hi> 1688; but finding
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0388001100:99"/>
Things out of Order in <hi>England,</hi> I thought it was no Place to ſettle in. So <hi>January</hi> the 1ſt I took Horſe for <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and from thence embark'd for <hi>Cork,</hi> where I had ſome ſmall Effects, and happily arriv'd there, <hi>January</hi> the 14th; where I was welcom'd from Death, by all my Friends.</p>
            <p>But I forgot one Thing which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me at <hi>Copenhagen.</hi> Dining with the Gentleman that ſpoke <hi>Engliſh</hi> very well, and ſeveral other <hi>Danes,</hi> I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to drink to him in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with, <hi>Sir, My humble Service to you,</hi> and ask'd him if he would <hi>Pledge me:</hi> Upon which, he told me, I muſt never mention Pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among <hi>Danes;</hi> for, added he, 'tis the greateſt Affront you can put upon 'em. How ſo, Sir, ſays I? Why, ſays he, I know 'tis your Cuſtom in <hi>England,</hi> but if you all knew the Meaning of it, you would ſurely aboliſh it. Whereupon, I preſs'd him to tell me the Foundation of that Cuſtom, according to his Notion. Why ſays he, when the <hi>Danes</hi> invaded <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and got the Better of the Natives, they us'd often to eat and drink toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0388001100:100"/>
but ſtill allowing the <hi>Danes</hi> to be their Maſters: And very often, upon ſome Pique or Intereſt, they us'd even to ſtab 'em when they were lifting the Cup to their Mouths. Upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being frequently murder'd in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they contriv'd at laſt when they were at Meals, or drinking with the <hi>Danes,</hi> to ſay to their next Neighbour, <hi>Here's to you;</hi> upon which, the other cry'd, <hi>I'll pledge you:</hi> Which was as much as to ſay, he would be his Surety, or Pledge, while the other drank; and accordingly the other would guard him while he drank. When done, the other would drink; and then he that drank before, was to ſtand his Pledge likewiſe. Nay, it came to be ſuch a Cuſtom at laſt, that when one <hi>Engliſhman</hi> came into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſeveral <hi>Danes,</hi> he wou'd ſay in taking up his Cup, to his next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Will you Pledge me, with an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis; upon the others anſw'ring he would, he might drink without Fear.</p>
            <p>After ſtaying the Winter at <hi>Cork,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to embark with Captain <hi>Clarke,</hi> on Board the Ship <hi>Gilliflower,</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0388001100:101"/>
we ſet out from <hi>Cork, April</hi> the 23d, 1689. for <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> and ſo for <hi>Virginia;</hi> we arriv'd at <hi>Boſton June</hi> the 3d, having a quick Paſſage. After having done our Buſineſs there, we ſet ſail for <hi>Virginia.</hi> We doubled <hi>Cape-Cod</hi> without any Danger; but one Night a Storm roſe, that flung us on Shore upon the Main, within ſix Leagues of <hi>Cape-Charles,</hi> where our Men were all ſav'd, but in a poor Condition. Our Ship ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Sands a Furlong from Shore, fourteen out of twenty of our Men that could ſwim, went into the Long-Boat, and went on Board the Ship, to get ſome Neceſſaries; as ſoon as they had got what they wanted, they came towards the Shore again; but the Boat being deeply Laden, could not come nigh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Shore to unload, ſo that they reſolv'd to go farther to ſeek for deeper Water, and bid us follow along the Shore, which we did; but they doubling a Point of Land, we loſt Sight of 'em: However we follow'd on ſtill, when going over a little Swamp, we perceiv'd ſeveral <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> in a Wood on our Right-Hand.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0388001100:102"/>
Whereupon we began to be in a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Fright, but ſtill we march'd on; when coming to the Skirt of the Wood, they let fly their Arrows at us, which kill'd one of our Companions, and wounded two more, one in the Arm, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Side of the Neck; as for my part, I ſtill remain'd unhurt, but had an Arrow ſticking in the Sleeve of my Watch-coat. After the <hi>Indians</hi> had fir'd, they ran to us with incredible Swiftneſs, whereupon (having no Weapons) we kneel'd down to 'em, and implor'd their Mercy. One among 'em ſpoke <hi>Engliſh</hi> pretty well, who ſaid, You <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> White-Men, we will kill you to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd of your Brothers at <hi>I ameſtown,</hi> who kill us many <hi>Indians;</hi> we will take you to our <hi>Werowance,</hi> (i. e. <hi>King,)</hi> and he will order us to burn you, where we will drink your Blood, and feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Fleſh. They hurry'd us along that Night at leaſt twenty Miles up in the Country, and next Morning brought us to their Village, where was their <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowance,</hi> ſick in his Cabin; but hearing of our coming, he roſe up, and with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0388001100:103"/>
of his Officers (who are call'd <hi>Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orooſes)</hi> came towards us. After he had examin'd the <hi>Indians</hi> (as we ſuppoſe) how we were taken, he order'd a great Fire to be made, and had us all ty'd to one Stake fix'd in the Earth; but we were no ſooner ty'd, and the Signal given for firing the Wood about us, but we were unty'd and brought back to the Tent, to ſtay, as we were inform'd, till the next Day, till more <hi>Indians</hi> could come to be Spectators of our Tragedy. They had ſtrip'd us Naked, and in my Breeches-Pocket had found my Box of Inſtruments, which they examin'd very narrowly, and ask'd which of us it belong'd to? When they were inform'd it was mine, I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent for before the <hi>Werowance,</hi> who ask'd me by his Interpreter, the Name and Uſe of every Inſtrument, which I inform'd him: When he came to my Lancets, and being inform'd they were to Bleed, he ask'd in a great Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if I was the Murderer of the <hi>Indians</hi> that were taken by the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> But when I let him know it was to let Blood in many Diſtempers, for Eaſe for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0388001100:104"/>
and that we were Strangers to thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> that kill'd their <hi>Indians,</hi> he abated of his Anger, and ask'd me if I could ſhow how I let Blood, which I told him I could, if any one wanted it, and was not well. Whereupon the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowance</hi> ſaid he was not very well; but he would have me try upon one of my Companions, before he would let me Bleed him. I told his Interpreter that he ſhould tell him I would feel his Pulſe, that I might know whether 'twas proper to let him Blood or no; Feel his Pulſe! what's that? ſays the Interpreter, and thought I meant ſomething elſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I took him by the Hand, and ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him what I meant. When the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter had ſatisfy'd him with what I ſaid, he beckon'd me to him, and held out his Hand, which I felt, and found he was in a high Fever; I told the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter that he muſt be let Blood, for his Indiſpoſition was a Fever, and explain'd his Diſtemper, which he finding to agree with his Condition, ſeem'd to be mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleas'd; but he would have me Bleed ſome one of my Companions before him;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0388001100:105"/>
I pitch'd upon one that it would not injure, and Bled him upon the Ground till he had Bled enough, and then ty'd up his Arm. The <hi>Werowance</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Indians</hi> were amaz'd to ſee him Bleed ſuch a Quantity, and ask'd me if he muſt Bleed as much? I told 'em, yes, or rather more; but that I wou'd have ſomething to ſave the Blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I could make a better Judgment of the Cauſe of his Diſtemper. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they brought me a <hi>Callibaſh,</hi> which I ſuppos'd might hold a Quart; and upon this, I ty'd up his Arm, and let him Bleed till I had taken about Sixteen Ounces from him, ſo ty'd up his Arm again. When I had done, he wanted to go into his Hammock to ſleep; but I told him he muſt not go to reſt till Night, which he comply'd with. The next Day he was much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſent for me again, from the Place where they had kept us waking all Night, by Singing and Dancing round us; and if any of us offer'd to ſleep, they would jogg us and hinder us. When I came to him I unbound his Arm,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0388001100:106"/>
and he looking at the Orifice, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it clos'd, was more amaz'd than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; then he made his Interpreter ask me concerning his Blood, which was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; and when I told him if I had not Bled him, he would ſoon have dy'd, he got up, and made me ſit down upon a Mat which lay in his Cabbin, and told me by his Interpreter, if I would ſtay with him, he would ſave both me and my Companions; if we would Fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Whites,</hi> and Marry <hi>Indian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that ſhould be allotted us. I told him I would ask my Companions, who rejoyc'd at the Propoſals; (and tho' all marry'd before) yet they made no Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of having another Wife. As for my ſelf, (tho' not marry'd,) I did not much care for ſuch a tawny Rib, therefore told the <hi>Werowance,</hi> none of our Profeſſion ever marry'd; he being well ſatisfy'd with this Anſwer, ſpar'd all our Lives. For my part I had a Houſe allotted me to my ſelf, that is a Place about the Height of one Story with us, and cover'd with the Barks of Trees; the Fire-Place is in the Middle of the Houſe, and all the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0388001100:107"/>
is the Door. The Country is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally pretty even, and agrees very well with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution. I need not deſcribe the Climate, being I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you all know the Nature of it as well as I. All the <hi>Indians</hi> that ever I ſaw, were well Limb'd, and near Six Foot high.</p>
            <p>The Marriages were made the next Day without much Ceremony, they were only join'd by their Prieſts, without any Queſtion on either Side, and ſo carry'd Home to their ſeveral Tents. All the while I was here, they were making Preparations to go againſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> One Day I was ſent for, and ordered to feel the Pulſe of the King; after I had done, he asked me if I could tell any thing of the Affairs of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> by feeling the Pulſe; but I told him, that was impoſſible, without I was with 'em in Perſon: Whereupon, the King asked me if I would go to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> and come to him again, and give him a true Account of 'em, but ſays he, you muſt leave your <hi>Sagamore,</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Box of Inſtruments) behind you. I told him I would make it my Buſineſs
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0388001100:108"/>
to inform my ſelf in every Particular, but that I did not know the Way; he told me I ſhould have a <hi>Canoe</hi> and Four <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> that ſhould carry me within a League of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I muſt confeſs I went with Joy and Sorrow; with Joy to leave ſuch a curſed Place, where Death threatened me every Day; with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to go without my Companions: We went into our Canoe, which lay about ſix Miles from the Place where the King liv'd, but took no Proviſions with us; becauſe my <hi>Indians</hi> were to provide for me by catching of Fiſh, in which they are very dexterous. We went down the River that the <hi>Indians</hi> call'd <hi>Kuskarra</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, till we came to <hi>Cheſapeack-Bay;</hi> then we row'd in our Canoe paſt <hi>Ruſſels</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and made toward <hi>Cape,</hi> or <hi>Poynt-Comfort;</hi> but coming about a League or thereabouts near the Iſland, a Boat came down the River, and upon what Account I can't tell; but they fir'd a Muſquet, which being heard by the <hi>Indians,</hi> they immediately jump'd Over-board, and ſwam back again to Shore. I was not much concerned I muſt own, for there
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0388001100:109"/>
was no Danger of their being drowned; for moſt <hi>Indians</hi> ſwim like Fiſhes. I took the Paddles and made the beſt of my Way to <hi>Poynt-Comfort,</hi> which I paſs'd, and enter'd <hi>Powhattan</hi> River, (being directed by my <hi>Indians</hi> ſo to do,) and directed my Way to <hi>Lameſtown,</hi> where I arriv'd very late, and was mightily rejoyc'd to find my Companions all well in Health, and ready to embark the next Day for <hi>Boſton,</hi> in a Veſſel bound for that Place. After refreſhing my ſelf, and ſelling my Canoe, I with the reſt of the Company ſet ſail the next Day, and after various Adventures am arriv'd where you ſee me.</p>
            <p>Now think with your ſelf, Mr. <hi>Falconer,</hi> whether we need doubt the Providence of God in helping us from this Iſland? There's nothing here like the Hardſhips I have undergone, and yet have been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily freed from; and therefore you need not deſpair. Deſpair is the Frenzy of the Mind, and ought to be avoided, by having a true Notion of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we ſerve. Upon this I happen'd to ſmile, but was mightily check'd by Mr. <hi>Randal,</hi> who asked me with a clouded
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0388001100:110"/>
Countenance, what I ſmil'd at? I reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Story might have had the ſame Effect upon ſome old Women, (if it were in Print) that the Sufferings of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had upon a Perſon in Years. What mean you by that, ſaid Mr. <hi>Randal?</hi> Why, Ill tell you, but I would not have you angry at it, for I really believe every thing you have ſaid to me. But a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Divine once at <hi>Stamford</hi> in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire,</hi> was preaching a Sermon upon Chriſt's Paſſion, where he expatiated on the many Sufferings, and what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour underwent to redeem us Mortals from the Curſe that was laid upon us: An old Woman (one of the Auditors) took the Parſon by the Sleeve as he went out of the Church, and ſaid to him, Indeed, Sir, you have made a very feeling Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which has mov'd me very much, and more eſpecially to ask you a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, or two. Say on, good Woman, ſays the Parſon. Pray then, Sir, (ſays ſhe) how long is it ago ſince this Matter hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd? Almoſt Seventeen Hundred Years ago. And how far off? (added the old Gentlewoman.) A great Way off, ſome
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0388001100:111"/>
Three or Four Thouſand Miles from hence. Alack aday! cry'd the Woman, I'm glad on't; Why ſo, ſays the Parſon? Becauſe (added ſhe) 'tis ſo long ago, and ſo far off, I hope in God it is not true. As to your own Belief, (Mr. <hi>Falconer,</hi> ſaid he,) I leave it to your ſelf; but I don't like jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Sacred Things: The old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Ignorance was Compaſſion; your Knowledge ſeems to be profane. I have known a great many airy young Fellows that have talk'd idly on ſuch Things, to make People have an Opinion of their Wit; but yet, I believe, even in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Time of their Utterance, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience told 'em, the very doing what was not pleaſing to God or Man. I real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took Mr. <hi>Randal</hi>'s Way of expreſſing himſelf very kindly, and as I ought; for there appear'd ſo much Sincerity and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour in all that he ſaid, that it would move any one that had a Senſe of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Humane Nature. Therefore I beg'd his Pardon, and was heartily ſorry if I had ſaid ought that might any ways of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him; which he freely forgave. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had ſpent the Night in Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0388001100:112"/>
of what had paſt; the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we (after imploring the Aſſiſtance of the Almighty) went to Work to clear the Sand from our Veſſel: which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued working on, for 16 Days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, reſting only on <hi>Sunday,</hi> which at laſt we effected. We had thrown up the Sand on each ſide, down from our Veſſel quite to the Surface of the Water, when it was loweſt. Now the next Thing we had to do, was to get Poles to put under our Veſſel to Launch her out, which we got from the <hi>Burton</hi> Wood, but with much difficulty, being we were forced to cut a great many before we could get them that were fit for our Purpoſe. After we had done this, we returned God Thanks for our Succeſs hitherto, and on the Day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſolved (God willing) to thruſt off our Veſſel into the Water, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Mr. <hi>Randal</hi>'s being taken Ill of a Fever, occaſioned (as we ſuppoſe) by his great Fatigue in working to free our Ship from the Sand, wherein he ſpared no Pains, for to encourage us as much by his Actions as his Words, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0388001100:113"/>
his Strength. The Concern we were all in upon this, occaſioned our delay in not getting our Veſſel out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides one Hand out of Five, was a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Strength. Mr <hi>Randal</hi> never thought of his Inſtruments, till now, which he wanted to let himſelf Blood, but not feeling them about his Cloaths, we ſuppos'd they might have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd in the Veſſel, ſo I ran immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſee if I could find them; and getting up the Side, my very Weight pull'd her down to the Sand; which had certainly bruis'd me to Death, if I had not by the Appointment of divine Providence ſunk into the Hollow that we had made by throwing the Sand from the Ship. I crept out in a great Fright, and ran to my Companions, who with much ado got her upright, and afterwards we fixed ſome ſpare Oars on each ſide, to keep her up from falling again. For the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Wood that we had placed under her were greas'd to facilitate her ſliping into the Water, and we had dig'd the the Sand ſo entirely from her, that ſhe reſted only on 'em, which occaſioned
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0388001100:114"/>
her leaning to one ſide with my Weight only, which had not happened, I believe, if I had endeavour'd to have got on Board on the other ſide, which was higheſt, but chuſing the loweſt for my more eaſy Entrance, was the Cauſe of the Accident, that happened to me. When we were enter'd into the Veſſel, and found our Endeavours to find the Box of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fruitleſs, we were all mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, for we verily believed that bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would have cured him; nay even he himſelf ſaid, that if he could be let Blood, he was certain his Fever would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and he ſhould be eaſier; yet to ſee with what a perfect Reſignation he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Will of Heaven, it would have inſpired one with a true Knowledge of the Being good Men enjoy after a Diſſolution from this painful Life. He was ſtill worſe and worſe; but yet ſo Patient in his Sufferings, that perfectly amaz'd us all. He continued in this Manner a whole Week, without taſting any Thing but Water-gruel ill made, for what little Oatmeal we had, was ſower. When we ſaw by the Courſe of Nature,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0388001100:115"/>
it was impoſſible he ſhould laſt long, we all were very much griev'd; as for my own Part, I could not forbear ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Tears, for I had taken ſuch an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to him, that almoſt equall'd a Child's Love to a Parent. He ſeeing me weep, call'd me with a faint Voice towards him; and when I was near him, he made me ſit down by him. After ſeveral kind Expreſſions, which made my Tears flow more plentifully, he ſaid to me, Mr. <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner,</hi> if you grieve for me, dry your Tears, I deſire nothing but your Prayers. I am going to pay a Debt incumbent on me by Nature, and a Debt that muſt be paid, which was contracted at my Birth, and Death will not admit of any Evaſion; all Mortals owe the ſame Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſome ſquander away that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which ſhould be freely paid when call'd for. How happy are they that provide againſt ſuch a Creditor, that may come at any Hour of Day or Night, and lawfully demand his due? Here is no Shuffling as in worldly Matters, no putting off the important Viſiter; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we are ſure he will call upon us,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0388001100:116"/>
'tis good to be always provided againſt the Time. How happy are honeſt Minds, when they have provided to ſatisfy their worldly Creditors; they then live in a Contentment of Mind, peculiar to an honeſt Heart: But what muſt be ſaid for the laſt Debt, upon which depends the Welfare of the Soul, our doing well or ill hereafter, is it not of the utmoſt Importance? Therefore as I am endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to pay that Debt, whoſe utmoſt Limit will ſoon expire, help me by your Prayers to finiſh what I hope I have well begun, and as Friend's Advice, prepare to make up your Accounts to Heaven, for you know not how ſoon they may be call'd for; beſides you will have one leſs to eat of the Proviſion is left. After this, being tir'd with ſpeaking ſo much toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he turn'd to reſt himſelf, but his Fever was ſo violent, he could take no eaſe in Body, tho' tranquil in Mind. So finding we could not expect his Life, we pray'd for a ſpeedy and a painleſs Releaſe from it. After this we gave him ſome Water (which he often beg'd for in vain) to cool his Mouth. When he had
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0388001100:117"/>
drank it, he ſaid he found himſelf a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eaſier, and the Pain and Burning ſomething abated, which we took as a lightning before Death, or as the Spirits collected together to make their laſt fruitleſs Efforts.</p>
            <p>When he found himſelf juſt upon the Point of expiring, he made this ſhort Prayer, which was ſo imprinted in my Memory, that I ſhall never forget it: O Almighty Creator of Heaven and Earth, whoſe all-ſeeing Eye looks into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Corner of the Heart! pardon my Offences, which I heartily repent of, and rely upon the infinite Grace of thy wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mercy to abſolve me of all my paſt Crimes, through the Merits of my Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. Then lifting up his Hands and Eyes to Heaven expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with the Happineſs of continuing in his right Senſes in ſuch a Fever, which is almoſt always attended with a Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy.</p>
            <p>After our Sorrow for his Death was ſomething abated, we conſulted how to bury him. Mr. <hi>Middleton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> were for ſewing him in his Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mock
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0388001100:118"/>
and throwing him into the Sea; But Mr. <hi>White</hi> and my ſelf were for burying him on the Land, which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to; ſo we dig'd the Hole which I deſigned for my Well, Seven Foot long and Seven deep, and return'd him to Earth from whence he came. Upon the Bark of the Tree that ſhaded his Grave, I wrote this Epitaph.</p>
            <q rend="margQuotes">Under this Tree lies the Body of <hi>Thomas Randal,</hi> Gent. born in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Cork, Anno Domini</hi> 1641. who was thrown aſhore with <hi>Richard White, William Muſgrave,</hi> and <hi>Ralph Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> both of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> to the Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Richard Falconer</hi> of <hi>Bruton</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> who was unfortunately caſt on Shore before them on the 18th of of <hi>September</hi> 1699. yet received from their Converſation a Mitigation of his own Misfortune. Whoſe Chance it is ever to read theſe Lines, pay a Tear to the Memory of <hi>Thomas Randal,</hi> and endeavour to make as good an End as he did, who died a Natural Death on <hi>Friday December</hi> the 21ſt 1699, in his perfect Mind, and a true Notion of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0388001100:119"/>
Power of God to pardon all his Faults, whoſe Failings were corrected by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Penitence, dying every Day he lived.</q>
            <p>This took me up a whole Tree. Mr. <hi>Randal</hi> made no Will; yet I claimed his Dog, being the Whelp of the Bitch he found upon the Rock which he was thrown upon in the <hi>Baltick,</hi> the Bitch being Dead ſome Years before. We were forced to tie him up after we had buried Mr. <hi>Randal,</hi> for with his Feet he would ſcrape Holes in the Grave two Foot deep, and howl prodigiouſly.</p>
            <p>After this we prepared once more to Launch our Veſſel; but firſt we put on Board what Proviſion we had left, and all the Things that we took from thence. Mr. <hi>Randal</hi>'s Death gave me (with the others Permiſſion) a Title to a Bed, which I wanted before. So that I took up the Cabin which was alloted me, and laid on Board every Night: And now we bent our Thoughts intirely on our Veſſel, and on <hi>Monday</hi> the 31ſt of <hi>December</hi> launch'd her out into the Sea, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to ſet Sail the next Day. After we had fix'd her faſt with two Anchors,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0388001100:120"/>
and a Halſer on Shore, we went on Board to Dine and make ourſelves Merry, which we did very heartily, and to add to our Mirth, we made a large Can of Punch, which we never attempted to do before, being we had but one Bottle of Lime Juice in all, and was what (indeed) we deſign'd for this Occaſion; in ſhort the Punch ran down ſo merrily, that we were all in a drunken Condition; but when it was all gone, we reſolved to go to reſt: But all I could do, could not perſuade 'em to lie on Board that Night in their Cabins, (yet without a Bed;) but they would venture, tho' they were obliged to ſwim a hundred Yards before they could wade to Shore, but however they got ſafe, which I knew by their hollowing and rejoicing.</p>
            <p>Having brought my Bed on Board, I went to reſt very contentedly, which I did till next Morning: But oh! Horror! when I had dreſt my ſelf, and going on Deck, to call my Companions to come on Board to Dine, which was intended over Night, and afterwards to go on Shore, and bring our Sails and Yards on
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0388001100:121"/>
Board, and make to Sea as faſt as we could, I could not ſee any Land, which ſo overcame me on the Suddain, that I ſunk down on the Deck, without Senſe or Motion: How long I continu'd ſo, I can't tell, but I awak'd full of the Senſe of my lamentable Condition, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Times (ſpight of my Reſolution to forbear) curs'd my unhappy Stars, that had brought me to that deplorable State. O Wretch that I am! what will my unhappy Fate do with me, is any one's Condition equal to mine? (I would cry) But 'tis a juſt Puniſhment, in not rendering to God the Tribute due for his Mercies, that we had hitherto known. Inſtead of coming on Board to be Frolick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and Merry, we ſhould have given Thanks to him, that gave us the Bleſſing of thinking we were no longer ſubject to ſuch Hardſhips, that we might probably have undergone, if we had been detain'd longer on that Iſland. If poor Mr. <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> had remain'd among us, this Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had not happened. He by his wiſe and prudent Care and Conduct, would have prevented this unlucky Accident. What
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0388001100:122"/>
muſt my poor Companions think that are left in a more miſerable Condition than my ſelf, if it be poſſible. I have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, neither am I of my ſelf capable of ruling the Veſſel in a Calm, much leſs if there ſhould a Storm happen, which are too frequent in this Climate.</p>
            <p>After I had vented my Grief in a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Words and Tears, I began to think how the Veſſel ſhould have gone to Sea without my Knowledge; and by Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Matter the Night before, found by our Eagerneſs and fatal Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs, we had forgot to faſten our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to the Geers, and pulling up the Halſer that we had faſten'd to one of the <hi>Burton</hi> Trees on Shore, perceiv'd that the Force of the Veſſel had pull'd the Tree out of the Earth. Then I too late found that a Hurricane had roſe when I was ſound aſleep, and ſtupify'd by too much Liquor, and carry'd off the Veſſel. This Reflection wounded me deeper than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which I follow'd with Curſes on that Liquor that ſteals away our Senſes, and makes worſe than Beaſts of Humane Creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0388001100:123"/>
Now I began to call upon him that hears us in the Time of Trouble, even when the Wind blows loudeſt, whoſe Nod can ſhake the Frame of Earth from off its Baſis; and with a Heart ſincere, and vicious Thoughts corrected, I ſent my Soul in Penitential Words and Tears before his Throne of Mercy, imploring a ſpeedy Ending of my Life or Troubles; when I began to be ſomething better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in my Mind, and thought of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining Nature almoſt ſpent, with the Fatigue and Grieving: One great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort I had of my Side, which my poor (former) wretched Companions wanted, that was Proviſion in Plenty, and freſh Water; ſo that when I began to conſider coolly, I found I had not that Cauſe to complain which they had, who were left on a Barren Iſland, without any other Proviſion than that very ſame Diet which I was forc'd to take up with, when firſt thrown on Shore; that is, the Boobies, whoſe Numbers were mightily diminiſh'd, before we deſign'd to leave the Iſland.</p>
            <p>What made me moſt uneaſy, was to think what my Companions could judge
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0388001100:124"/>
of me, whether they ſhould take it for Deſign or Chance; but then I ſtill'd that Thought, by knowing they muſt needs ſee that the Tree was forc'd away with Violence beyond the Strength of Man. Beſides, I had another ſmall Comfort, that was the Company of my Dog, which lay on Board with me, which I us'd to talk to as if he were a rational Creature; and the poor Creature wou'd ſtand and ſtare me in the Face, as if he were ſenſible of what I ſaid to him. It was a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Creature, of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Kind; but very good-natured, and would often go to the Cabbin where I lay, which was that of his old Maſter's, and whine migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily.</p>
            <p>I remain'd toſs'd upon the Sea for a Fortnight without diſcovering Land; for the Weather continu'd very calm, but yet ſo hazy that I could not perceive the Sun for ſeveral Days. One Day ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome Linnen that I had drop'd under the Sacking of my Bed, (for I did not lie in a Hammock) I found an old Glove with 75 Pieces of Eight in't, which I took and ſew'd in the Waſte-Band
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0388001100:125"/>
of my Breeches, for fear I ſhould want it ſome time or other. I made no Scruple of taking it, for I was well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it did belong to poor Mr. <hi>Randal.</hi> Beſide I had heard the other People ſay, that they were ſure he had Money ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; and after his Death we ſearch'd for it, but could not find any.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> the 20th I diſcover'd a Sail to Leeward of me, but ſhe bore away ſo faſt, that there was not any Hope of Succour from her, and I had not any Thing to diſtinguiſh me; and I ſuppos'd tho' I could ſee them, yet they could not ſee me by Reaſon of my want of Sail, which would have made me the more conſpicuous. The next Day I diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Land, about ſix Leagues to the S. W. of me, which I obſerv'd my Veſſel did not come nigh, but coaſted along Shore; but I was well aſſured it was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Jucatan,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> and was the Place we came from; now all my Fear was that I ſhould fall into their Hands, who would make me do the Work of a Slave; but even that I thought was better than to live in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0388001100:126"/>
Fear of Storms and Tempeſts, or Shipwreck.</p>
            <p>I coaſted along in this Manner for two or three Days, and at laſt diſcover'd Land right a-head, which I was very glad of; but yet mix'd with ſome Fear, in not knowing what Treatment I ſhould have. I began now to think of ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, and not to tell 'em the Truth, of belonging to the Logwood Veſſel, but reſolv'd to tell 'em that we were taken by a <hi>French</hi> Privateer, and after being rumag'd, were turn'd off as uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> the 30th, I made the Bay and Town of <hi>Franciſco di Campeche,</hi> as it prov'd afterwards, and was almoſt upon it before I was met by any Thing of a Ship, or a Boat; but at laſt two Canoes came on Board with one <hi>Spaniard</hi> and ſix <hi>Indians,</hi> who were much ſurpriz'd when they underſtood my Condition by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken <hi>French,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> underſtood. They immediately carry'd me on Shore, and from thence to the Governor, who was at Dinner; they would have had me ſtaid till he had din'd; but he hearing of me, commanded
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0388001100:127"/>
me to come in, where he was at Dinner with ſeveral Gentlemen, and two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and tho' 'tis very rare any one ſees the Women, yet they did not offer to Veil themſelves. I was ordered to ſit down by my ſelf at a little Table placed for that Purpoſe, where I had ſent me of what compoſed their Dinner, which was ſome freſh Fiſh, and Fowls, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Wine of ſeveral Sorts.</p>
            <p>The Chief Town of the Province of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catan,</hi> lies twelve Leagues from the Sea on either Side, which is a Biſhop's See, and the Reſident of the Governor of this Province. <hi>Valladolid</hi> is the ſecond City; and <hi>Campeche</hi> the third; yet tho' but the third reckon'd, it far exceeds the reſt, for Riches and Magnificence. It is a well ſituated neat built Town, and by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation contains near Two Thouſand Houſes. It is well fortified both by Art and Nature: By the former in a ſtrong, well built, neat Caſtle, that contains a Hundred Braſs Cannon, and ſeveral Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars; and the latter by a Ridge of Hills, that runs all along the Side of the City. There is in the Caſtle a very neat Piaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0388001100:128"/>
conſiſting of about Thirty high Arches. This Town has the chiefeſt Trade; for from this Place, the other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Towns are furniſhed with all Neceſſaries that come from the <hi>Havana</hi> and other Places in <hi>America;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from <hi>Old Spain.</hi> Yet for all their Power, Riches and Strength, Capt <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> with one Ship, and a ſmall Bark, and whoſe whole Crew contain'd but a Hundred and Forty Men, Landed in the Middle of the Day, and in Spite of all their Forces, which were Two Hundred Horſe, and Five Hundred Foot, took the Place, with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and ſeveral other Perſons of Quality; together with a rich Ship laden with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots and ſeveral other valuable Ladings, before they knew of the City's being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. This Province of <hi>Jucatan,</hi> contains in Compaſs Nine Hundred Miles, and is ſituated between Eighteen and Twenty Degrees, Northern Latitude. The Air is very hot, and not altogether ſo Wholeſome as ſome other Parts of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> are. The Diſtempers that reign here, are moſtly Fluxes and Feavers, which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0388001100:129"/>
carry off Abundance of New Comers. This Province was firſt diſcover'd by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando Cortez,</hi> among his Conqueſts of <hi>New Spain;</hi> and tho' not altogether ſo Fruitful, yet by the Induſtry of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, 'tis as Rich as any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provinces of <hi>New Spain;</hi> for they are moſt either Merchants or Tradeſmen: And 'tis the Vulgar Opinion, that theſe People are more hard and barbarous than any other Part of the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies;</hi> yet, for my own part, I receiv'd more Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility by 'em, than if I had been among my own Friends in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a Tradition here among the Inhabitants, that they us'd a Ceremony much like our Baptiſm, and which had in their Language, the Term of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or Second Birth; which they thought to be the Seed or Groundwork of all good and juſt Things; and after being initiated, they were certain it was not in the Power of the Evil Spirit to hurt 'em in Body or Goods: Neither were they permitted to Marry, without firſt taking that Order upon 'em, which they us'd to diſtinguiſh by an <hi>Oſtriche</hi>'s
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0388001100:130"/>
Feather, larger and longer than any other they us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to wear for Ornaments upon their Heads.</p>
            <p>They have another Tradition, that this Province of <hi>Jucatan</hi> was firſt Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and Cultivated by a White-Bearded People, that came from the Eaſt; after being toſs'd many Moons upon the Sea, and ſuffering many Hardſhips for Want of Food and Freſh Water, and other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries; yet reliev'd from Want and their Enemies, through the Power of the Deity they Worſhip'd, who even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Sun to Shine, or not Shine; who made it Rain or dry Weather; who could heal Sickneſs, or ſend Diſtempers; in ſhort, a God that kept all the other petty Deities in Awe.</p>
            <p>This Story, if true, ſeems to confirm an old Tradition of our <hi>Welſh</hi> Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that tell us of one <hi>Madoc ap Owen,</hi> Son to <hi>Guineth,</hi> a Prince of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who was drove by ſome Diſguſt, from his own Country, with ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who after various Adventures at Sea, were driven on an unknown Land to the Weſt, many Hundred Leagues,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0388001100:131"/>
where they had Communication in a friendly Manner, with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and made a Settlement. Whereupon <hi>Madoc ap Owen</hi> return'd for <hi>Britain</hi> again, and got to the Number of Two Thouſand Men and Women, beſides Children, which mix'd with the Natives, and left among 'em ſeveral of their Opinions and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; which they retain'd till the laſt, when <hi>Cortez</hi> ſubdu'd 'em; but now, by the Cruelty of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Natives are almoſt extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>After they had feaſted me for two or three Days, they ſent me about with ſeveral Officers appointed by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to make a Gathering, which we did with Succeſs; for in Three Days we had got Seven Hundred and odd Pieces of Eight: And Two Merchants there, were at the Charge of fitting up my Bark, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſend it for my poor Companions. When it was finiſh'd, they gave me ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Neceſſaries for my ſelf and Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to hearten us up; as ſome Bottles of fine Wines; Two Bottles of Citron-Water, for a Cordial; Chocolate, and ſeveral other uſeful Things: But the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0388001100:132"/>
was to get Seamen to go with me: At laſt they remembered they had Five <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> that were Priſoners there, and taken in the Bay of <hi>Campeche,</hi> upon Suſpicion of Piracy, but nothing could be prov'd againſt 'em; which they Freed without any Ranſom: This did not look like Barbarity or Ill-Nature; for I receiv'd as much Humanity among 'em, as could be expected from any of the moſt Civiliz'd Nations: But they have a greater Kindneſs for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than they have for their Neighbours the <hi>French,</hi> being the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are more open and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, (they ſay) and don't uſe Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems to deceive 'em, as the <hi>French</hi> do frequently; tho' they only pay 'em in their own Coin, for there is no Nation under the Sun more fruitful than the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in Plottings and Ambuſcades, (as they call 'em) to deceive their Enemies; which yet they think lawful.</p>
            <p>On <hi>February</hi> the 15th, 1700. we ſet ſail from <hi>Campeche</hi> Bay, after paying my Acknowledgment to the generous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, &amp;c. but having nothing to preſent him with worth Acceptance, but my <hi>Ovid,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0388001100:133"/>
I gave him that, which he took very kindly, and ſaid he would prize it mightily, not only in having never a one, but in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me and my Misfortunes.</p>
            <p>We ply'd it to Windward very briskly, and in Fifteen Days diſcover'd the Iſles of the <hi>Alcranes;</hi> but we durſt not go in within the Shoals, becauſe we were all ignorant of the Channel. So we caſt Anchor, and hoiſted out our Boat, with Two Men and my ſelf, and made to Shore, where we found my Three Companions, but in a miſerable Condition, and Mr. <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> ſo faint and weak, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected he could not live long.</p>
            <p>When they awak'd the next Day, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I was drove off in the Dark, they were all in Deſpair, to find the Veſſel gone, which they perceiv'd was occaſion'd by a Hurricane, that they were aſſur'd was violent, becauſe it had blown down their Tent, tho' without awaking 'em. But when they began to conſider they had no Food, nor but very little freſh Water, which was left in a Barrel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Head in the Tent, their Deſpair increas'd; but as no Paſſion can laſt long
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0388001100:134"/>
that's violent, it wore off with their Care for Suſtenance, which they diligently ſearch'd for; but not finding any Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Eggs, or Boobies, the dreadful Fear of Starving came into their Minds, with all its horrid Attendance. Now they imagin'd that all that happen'd to 'em, was, as I had thought, a Judgment of Divine Providence for the vile Sin of Drunkenneſs, when they ſhould have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther implor'd Heav'n's Aſſiſtance, in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering 'em in their Delivery from the Place where they were.</p>
            <p>They had been now Five Days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Eating or Drinking, not for Want of Stomachs, but Food, which they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to get, but all to no Purpoſe; for the Boobies were retir'd, either out of Fear, or Cuſtom, to ſome other Place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neither could they find one Egg more, and Weakneſs came ſo faſt upon 'em, with Hunger and Drought, that they were hardly able to crawl, ſo they thought of nothing but dying; when at laſt they remember'd the Body of good Mr. <hi>Randal,</hi> that had been buried a Week, which they dug up, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0388001100:135"/>
putrify'd; and that poor Wretch that help'd to ſupport our Misfortunes when alive with his ſage Advice, now was a Means of preſerving their Lives, tho dead. They had by good Fortune left 'em a Tinder-Box in the Tent, (we hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two) with which they ſtruck a Light, and made a Fire, then cut off ſeveral pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Fleſh of the Brawn of his Arms and Thighs, broil'd 'em on the Coals, tho' with a great deal of Reluctance; which was the Means of keeping Life and Soul together, till we came to relieve 'em from that deplorable Condition. Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> we brought to a little Life and Strength, by giving him ſome Citron-Water in ſmall Quantities. When I ſaw the Carcaſs of my poor good Monitor lie for Food for Humane Creatures, my Horror at the Sight overcame my Reaſon, and I believe I ſaid Things ſhocking enough; however when I had calmly conſidered their Condition, I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſorry for what I had ſaid, and beg'd their Pardon. After we had refreſhed our ſelves, we once more laid him in the Earth, having ſew'd his poor Bones in one of the Hammocks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0388001100:136"/>
I muſt confeſs, I never think of that good Man, but Tears come into my Eyes, and Melancholy clouds all my Thoughts: For he was one whoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter came up to all we cou'd deſire in frail Men. Honeſt, without Intereſt; Friendly, without Deſign; Religious, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Reaſon, and not ſwadled up ſo tite as to make it deform'd: Pleaſant in Converſation, Courteous to All, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing but Vice: Gentle in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving; Bold in All Dangers, in being arm'd with an Innocence that inſpir'd him with Succeſs; in ſhort, he was a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of a Man, when we conſider his Life had been always at Sea, among a Crew prone to all manner of Vices, and where it was not poſſible to find a Pattern to follow of any Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>He was a ſingle Man, or rather indeed, a Batchelor; for he had often told me, he cou'd not bear to Marry a Woman, to put her into Frights and Fears when the Wind blew hard, as every good Wife muſt certainly be concern'd for the Danger of her Husband. Beſides, as it was his Fortune to lead a Seafaring Life, he cou'd
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0388001100:137"/>
not think of Marrying, to be abſent from his other ſelf ſo long; (as he term'd it) not but if he had had a ſufficient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency, he ſaid, he believ'd he ſhou'd have enter'd into the Marriage State in the latter Part of Life, that he might have ſettl'd his Mind; and free from the Hazard and Turmoils of the Sea, ſlip'd into his Shrowd with Content, among his Friends and Acquaintance at Home.</p>
            <p>He was an excellent Sailor, and knew moſt Parts of the World perfectly well; underſtood <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and ſeem'd to have a pretty good Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue. His Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals were moſtly taken in Short-Hand. But he had one ſmall Manuſcript, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining about Twenty Leaves, <hi>Spaniſh</hi> on one Side, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> on the other, all in his own Hand; which I ſuppoſe he had Tranſlated for his Diverſion, or to paſs away his Leiſure Hours. It was a Treatiſe of Herbs and Flowers, with other Rarities, to be found in the <hi>Weſt-Indies:</hi> Which being but ſhort, I ſhall give my Readers at the latter End of this Piece. On the Flat of his Book, he had
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0388001100:138"/>
writ in a large Hand theſe Words. <hi>This Manuſcript in</hi> Spaniſh, <hi>I have Tranſcrib'd from the Original of the Reverend Father</hi> Pedero di Riberia, <hi>of the Order of</hi> Jeſus, <hi>when I was Pilot in</hi> Mexico. <hi>The Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation I have made at my Leiſure Hours; and the Cures by the Simples, &amp;c. menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd in the ſaid Book, I have been an Eye-Witneſs to many of, and ſome were pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd on my ſelf.</hi> But more of this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>We now were got on Board once again, in order to ſail as ſoon as the Wind would riſe, it being ſtark Calm, and continu'd ſo two Days; but at laſt it blew a little, and we weigh'd Anchor, and ſtood out to Sea; but made but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Way. I now was Maſter, or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a Ship, and began to take upon me; we were in all Nine Men, all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh;</hi> that is, My ſelf firſt, <hi>Richard White, W. Muſgrave,</hi> and <hi>Ralph Middleton,</hi> my old Companions: <hi>John Stone, W. Kea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Francis Hood, W. Warren,</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Meadows,</hi> (All of <hi>England)</hi> the Five Men given me by Don <hi>Antonio;</hi> who, as I ſaid before, were taken on Suſpicion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0388001100:139"/>
of Pyracy. Whereupon a Thought came into my Head, that had eſcap'd me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: I conſider'd if theſe were really Pyrates, being Five to Four, they might be too powerful for us, and perhaps murder us. <hi>Franc Hood</hi> we had made our Cook, to dreſs our Proviſion, which he underſtood a little. One Day we All Din'd together upon Deck, under our Awning, it being very calm Weather; an <hi>Awning</hi> is only a Sail fix'd at the Quarter-Deck, and carry'd over the <hi>Booms</hi> (that is, ſpare Maſts that lie along from Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Forecaſtle) to the Forecaſtle, to keep the Sun from our Heads: in Men of War, and great Ships, they have one made of ſeveral Kinds of handſome Stuff, for the Officers on the Quarter-Deck; beſides another on the Main Deck, for the Common Sailors. One Day, as I ſaid before, being at Dinner, for we All eat together; I ask'd the five Men, what was the Reaſon they were taken by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for Pyrates? Upon this they ſeem'd nonplus'd, but <hi>Warren</hi> ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd himſelf, as well as the reſt, and ſpake for the others, in this Manner: We
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0388001100:140"/>
embark'd on Board the Ship <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> in the <hi>Thames,</hi> bound for <hi>Jamaica,</hi> where we made a proſperous Voyage; but after taking in our Lading in our Way Home, we were overtaken by a Storm, in which our Ship was loſt, and all the Men periſh'd, but my ſelf and Four Companions; who were ſav'd in the Long-Boat: But the Reaſon we were taken for Pyrates was, that making to Shore to ſave our ſelves, we ſaw a Bark riding at Anchor, without the Port of <hi>Campeche,</hi> which we made to, in order to enquire wherea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts we were, and to beg ſome Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, our own being gone, and entring the Veſſel, found but two People in't; the third, jumping into the Water, ſwam on Shore, and brought three Boats fill'd with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldiers, which enter'd the Veſſel before we could make off. Make off! ſaid I, what did you deſign to run away with the Veſſel? No; anſwer'd <hi>Warren,</hi> with ſome Confuſion, but we did deſign to weigh Anchor, and go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Shore, that we might land in the Morning, it being late at Night; but we were prevented by their coming on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0388001100:141"/>
Board us, where we were found, being arm'd, which we had taken Care of, when we went into our Boat, to defend our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if we were obliged to land among the <hi>Savages:</hi> And indeed they had their Arms reſtor'd 'em, when they were freed and ſent on Board with me.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, I did not like the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's being nonplus'd now and then, in not knowing what to ſay; but upon Conſideration, thought it might be for Want of Words to expreſs himſelf better, which is the Occaſion very often of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of common Underſtanding Stammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Humming, and Hawing, to put their Words in better Order; ſo for that Time I took no more Notice, not weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in my Mind. But in the Evening Mr. <hi>Middleton</hi> came to me, with a Face of Concern, and told me he did not like theſe Fellows Tale. Why ſo? ſays I. Becauſe I obſerve they herd together, anſwer'd he, and are always whiſpering and ſpeaking low to one another. Oh! ſays I, there cannot be any Danger in 'em; for if they had any Inclination to run away with our Veſſel, they might
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0388001100:142"/>
have done it when they were five to one, before we took you in. I know not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Middleton,</hi> I have a Heart forebodes ſomething. Pſhaw, old Womens Fears; (ſaid I) for, as I ſaid before, they wou'd have don't when they had more Power; before I landed on <hi>Deſpair Iſland,</hi> (as I call'd it) if they had any ſuch Intentions. There is a Providence that rules o'er all our Actions, (anſwer'd <hi>Middleton)</hi> that we can no more ſee into, than the Book of Fate; but if a foreboding Heart may ſpeak, I am ſure ſomething we ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from theſe Fellows, that will be of Danger to us. If ſo, reply'd I, there's no reſiſting the Will of Providence; for what will come, will come, and there's no Fending againſt it: But, added he, this ſeems ſomething like Fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and to reſiſt againſt that, ſeems like ſtruggling againſt the Will of Heav'n; that warns us by theſe Forebodings to prevent theſe Accidents of Life. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God, purſu'd he, has fix'd a Period to our Breath; but Accidents that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in this Pilgrimage of Life, may be avoided by a timely Notice: As we are
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0388001100:143"/>
all Partakers of free Will, and from that, form our own Happineſs, or Miſery, it cannot be ſaid but that the Actions of Life may be regulated by that free Will. Our Maker never form'd a Villain! nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does their external Parts differ from a virtuous Man's; if they did, they were to be eaſily avoided: But as an old Poet ſays, <hi>There's no Art to find the Mind's Conſtruction in the Face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Diſcourſe, I began to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in my Opinion of their Honeſty, and therefore we reſolv'd to ſtand upon our Guard. We took no Notice of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference then to our two other Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but reſolv'd to ſtay till Night, we having a better Opportunity, being we lay together in the Cabbin Aft; (which is as much as to ſay, in the Stern, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind) when we were to go to Supper, we call'd one another to come, but five of the Sailors excus'd themſelves, by ſaying they had Din'd ſo lately, that they had no Stomach as yet; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we had an Opportunity ſooner to converſe together than we deſign'd. For being at Supper, we open'd the Matter
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0388001100:144"/>
to our other two Companions, and they agreed immediately that we were in ſome Danger; ſo we reſolv'd in the middle Watch of the Night, to ſeize 'em in their Sleep. We were to have the firſt Watch, which we ſet at Eight of the Clock; then they were to Watch till Twelve; and then in their third Watch, between One and Two, we had conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſeize upon 'em as they ſlept; that is, Four of 'em, for One of them watch'd with us, which was <hi>Franck Hood,</hi> the Cook; whom we agreed to ſeize and bind faſt, towards the latter End of the Watch, and to threaten him with Death if he offer'd to make the leaſt Noiſe.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ever our firſt Watch was ſet, we ſent Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> to prepare our Arms; in about a Half an Hour, or thereabouts <hi>Warren,</hi> call'd to <hi>Hood</hi> upon Deck, (they lying below) to get him a little Water, for he was bloody dry, he ſaid: Whereupon the other went down immediately with ſome Water in a Can to him. As ſoon as he was gone down, I had the Curioſity to draw as near the Scuttle as I could to hear the Diſcourſe.

Now, you muſt know, <hi>Hood,</hi> our Cook, had been employ'd that Day about ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Proviſions, our Beef Casks, and Pork, to ſee what Quantity we had, that we might know how long it would laſt; ſo that the others had not an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to diſcloſe the Deſign to him. As ſoon as he was got down, I cou'd hear <hi>Will Warren</hi> ſay to him G—d D—n ye, <hi>Franck,</hi> we had like to have been ſmoak'd to Day; and tho' we had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd the Story that I told 'em, yet I was a little ſurpriz'd at their asking me, becauſe then I did not expect it; but we deſign to be even with 'em in a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Time: For, hark ye, ſays he, and ſpake ſo low that I cou'd not hear him; upon which, the other ſaid there's no Difficulty in the Matter; but we need not be in ſuch Haſte, for you know, as we ply it to Windward, a Day or two can break no Squares, and we can ſoon (after the Effecting our Deſign) bear down to Leeward to our Comrades that we left on Shore; for I fancy, added he, that they have ſome ſmall Suſpicion of you now, (which in Time will ſleep)
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0388001100:146"/>
and may be on their Guard; therefore 'tis better to wait a Day or two: No, G—d Z—ds, we'll do it too Night, when they are aſleep, reply'd <hi>Warren;</hi> whereupon there were many Arguments, <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con;</hi> (as I fancy'd) but they ſpoke ſo low, that I cou'd only hear a G—d D—n ye, now and then, and ſomething of that Kind.</p>
            <p>A little while after, <hi>Hood</hi> came up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and after walking up and down, and fixing his Eyes often upon me, who in the mean Time was provided with a Couple of Piſtols under my Watch-Coat, and indeed were their own, that we hung up ready charg'd in our Cabbin; which was one Reaſon of their Deſign to ſeize on us in our Sleep, being they had no Arms till they cou'd ſeize on 'em where they hung; or elſe, they were ſuch deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Fellows, they wou'd have don't in the open Day. <hi>Hood,</hi> as I ſaid before, ſeem'd to fix his Eyes frequently upon me, for till now I never watch'd in the Night; at laſt, ſaid he very ſoftly, if you pleaſe, Mr. <hi>Falconer,</hi> I have a Word or two to ſay to you, that much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0388001100:147"/>
you All. What is it? ſays I. Why, anſwer'd He, I wou'd have the reſt of your Companions, Ear Witneſſes too; with that I call'd 'em together; but, ſays he, let's retire as far from the Scuttle as we can, that we may not be heard by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny below Deck; ſo we went into the Cabbin, and open'd the Scuttle above, that Mr. <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> who ſteer'd, might hear what was ſaid. When we were ſat down upon the Floor, Mr. <hi>Hood</hi> began as follows. My four Companions below have a wicked Deſign upon you; that is, to ſeize you, and put you into the Boat, and run away with your Veſſel: But I thinking it an inhuman Action, not only to any one, but to you in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that have been the Means of their Freedom; therefore, I hope, appointed by Providence, I come to let you know it, that we may think of ſome Means to prevent it. Upon this, (finding his Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,) I told him that we were provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt it already; and with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of my Companions, told him our Deſign of ſeizing 'em in the third Watch; but, ſays he, they intend to put their
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0388001100:148"/>
Project in Practice, their next Watch; therefore I think 'twill be more proper for us to Counter-plot 'em, and ſeize 'em this; but as they have no Arms, ſays I, and we have, we need not fear 'em.</p>
            <p>We had ſeveral Debates about this, which took up too much Time to our Sorrow. For <hi>Warren</hi> miſtruſting <hi>Hood,</hi> it ſeems, got up and liſten'd, and when he found that we retir'd all of us to the Cabbin, he got upon Deck, and ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoftly, came ſo cloſe, that he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard every thing we ſaid, which as ſoon as he underſtood, he went immediately to his Companions, who waited impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (as they told us afterwards) and let 'em know all our Diſcourſe; whereupon, without pauſing, they reſolv'd to ſeize us immediately, in the Midſt of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation; which was no ſooner reſolv'd upon, but done: For we were immediately ſurpriz'd with their ſeizing us, which they did with that Quickneſs, and ſo unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably, that we were all confounded and amaz'd; they had whip'd off two Piſtols in our Conſternation, which they clap'd to our Breaſts. In this Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0388001100:149"/>
I had forgot mine that were at my Girdle, (or elſe we might have been hard enough for 'em;) neither did I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member 'em till they found 'em about me. They had ſhut the Cabbin Door on the Inſide, till they had bound us, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver minded Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> knocking and making a Noiſe, till they had ſecur'd us. Which done, they open'd the Door, and ſeiz'd him, who came to know what the Matter was, for we had no Candle in the Cabbin, and he hearing a Noiſe amongſt us, thought we were ſeizing <hi>Hood,</hi> and call'd to us to forbear, (as he ſaid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards) and make Haſte, for he was going to tack about, tho' we did not hear him; on which he clap'd the Helm a Lee, and came down to fetch us out, to haul off the Sheets, &amp;c. and was ſeiz'd, and bound with us; for they left us immediately, being the Sails flutter'd in the Wind, by Reaſon ſhe was veering round, when the Helm was a Lee.</p>
            <p>After they had fix'd the Veſſel, and it was broad Day, they came and unbound our Legs, and gave us Leave to walk upon Deck; whereupon I began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0388001100:150"/>
with 'em, particularly Mr. <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> being he ſeem'd to have a ſort of Command over the others. Pray, ſays I to him, for what Reaſon have you ſeiz'd upon us, and bound us in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Have we done you any Injury? Why, ſays he, Self-preſervation; I found you were a going to do the like by us, therefore you are but ſerv'd in your Kind. And what do you deſign to do with us, now you have your Deſire? Do with you! why, by and by we deſign to put you in the Boat, and turn you a-drift; but for that Son of a B—h, <hi>Hood,</hi> we'll murder him without Mercy; a Dog, to betray us! How, betray you! reply'd I? Yes! for I overheard All; then related the Manner of it as mention'd above. But as you have not ſo much injur'd us, we'll put you immediately in the Boat, with a Week's Proviſions, and a ſmall Sail, and you ſhall ſeek your Fortune, as I ſuppoſe you wou'd have done by us. No, anſwer'd I, we only deſign'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine you till we came to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and there to have given you your Liberty to go where you had thought fit. Ay, ay,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0388001100:151"/>
ſays <hi>Warren,</hi> ſhaking his Head, this is eaſily ſaid, nor are we bound to believe you. Why, 'tis plain, ſaid I, that our conſulting to ſeize you, was but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent what has happen'd. We are not to enquire into the Matter, anſwer'd <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> and now we have you in our Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we'll do as we think fit. Why then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſays I, put us aſhore at any Land that belongs to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and we ſhall think you have not done us any Injury. No, ſays he, we muſt go to meet our Captain and Fifty Men upon the Main Land of <hi>Jucatan,</hi> where our Veſſel was ſtranded not to be gotten off. Our firſt Deſign when we were taken in our Boat, was to get us a Veſſel to go a <hi>Buccaneer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which we had done at <hi>Campeche,</hi> if it had not been for the <hi>Indian</hi> that ſwam a Shore unknown to us, and brought Succours too ſoon; which we cou'd not avoid, the Sea Breeze blowing very ſtrong all Night; ſo we ſeeing our Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, were forc'd to form the Lie we told the Governour, which had ſome Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Truth, for we did not uſe any Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to the two old <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being by
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0388001100:152"/>
good Words we thought to make 'em aſſiſting to work our Bark back again to our Men. Now, purſu'd he, if you will all reſolve to go a <hi>Buccaneering</hi> with us, we'll venture to carry you to our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Men; if not, we'll do as we have propos'd. We looking one upon another, as if it were to know each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Reſolutions; he cry'd, nay, if you pauſe, you ſhan't have that Grace, if you deſire it: Therefore prepare every Thing, purſu'd he, to one of his Companions, that they may be going, they won't be long before they come to their Journey's End.</p>
            <p>When they had got every Thing ready, that is to ſay, a Barrel of Bisket, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Water, about half a Dozen Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Beef, and as much Pork, a ſmall Kettle, and a Tinder-Box; we were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter provided than we expected, by much. Beſides, they granted us Four Cutlaſſes, and a Fowling-Piece, with about Four Pound of Powder, and a ſufficient Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Shot; together with all poor Mr. <hi>Randal</hi>'s Journals, after their peruſing 'em, and finding 'em of no Uſe to them:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0388001100:153"/>
When this was done, he order'd 'em to tie <hi>Hood</hi> to the Maſt of the Veſſel, and was charging a Piſtol to ſhoot him thro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Head, not conſidering it was charg'd before, for it was one of them I had at my Girdle, and which they took from me; but in his Eagerneſs and Heat of Paſſion did not mind it. We all intreated for the poor Fellow, and he himſelf fell upon his Knees, and beg'd with all the Eloquence he had, to ſpare him, and let him go with us; but <hi>Warren</hi> ſwore bitterly, nothing ſhould ſave him. Says I, Mr. <hi>Warren,</hi> if you believe there is a Power that form'd this Globe, and ſees every Action of Mankind, think what a Crime you commit by wounding of him, by murdering his Image: But if you're an Atheiſt, and believe in no Power Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, yet conſider what a Conqueſt you will have gain'd over your ſelf by overcoming this headſtrong Paſſion. It may be your own Caſe another Time; and Murder you know is puniſh'd with Death. What the Devil have we got here, a preaching Puppy? Why, doſt think that I mind thy ridiculous Cant!
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0388001100:154"/>
prithee mind thy own Buſineſs, and get thee gone, or perhaps I may begin with you, and ſend you to the Devil before your Time. With that, he cock'd his Piſtol, and levell'd it at <hi>Hood;</hi> but firing, it ſplit into ſeveral Pieces, and one ſtruck <hi>Warren</hi> into the Skull ſo deep, that he was breathing his laſt upon Deck; one of the Bullets graz'd upon the Side of my Temple, and did but juſt break the Skin; as for <hi>Hood,</hi> he was not hurt; but with the Fright and Noiſe of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol, (as we ſuppos'd) labour'd with ſuch an Agony of Spirit, that he broke the Cords that ty'd him by the Arms, tho' as thick as a Middle Finger, and fell down; but roſe immediately, and not finding himſelf hurt, ran to us, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound our Arms, not perceiv'd by the other two, who were buſy about unfortunate <hi>Warren;</hi> and tho' they were call'd to by him that ſteer'd, (who ran immediately to prevent it) yet they did not mind it, they were ſo concern'd about <hi>Warren.</hi> And before he that ſteer'd came, <hi>Hood</hi> had unbound me, and ſtop'd the Fellow <hi>(Meadows)</hi> by giving him a Blow with his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0388001100:155"/>
Fiſt that knock'd him down. In the mean Time, I had unbound <hi>White, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> and <hi>Middleton;</hi> and we went and ſeiz'd upon the other two <hi>Pyrates,</hi> for now we call'd 'em nothing elſe. After we had bound 'em in our Turn, we went to ſee what Aſſiſtance cou'd be given to <hi>Warren,</hi> where we found that a Piece of the Barrel of the Piſtol had ſunk into his Skull, and that he was juſt expiring; but yet, he ſat upon his Breech with great Reſolution; ſays he, I ſee you have overpower'd us, and I likewiſe ſee the Hand of Heav'n is in it. I now with Horror find (added he) that what you intimated to me about Heav'n, to be true; I ſee it more in this one Accident, than in all the Preachings of the Fathers. I was bred a <hi>Roman,</hi> had good Honeſt Parents, <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe Steps, if I had follow'd, wou'd have made my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence eaſy to me at this Time; but I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook all Religion in general, and now too late, I find, that to dally with Heav'n is fooling ones ſelf; but yet, in this one Moment of my Life, that's left, I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily repent of all my paſt Crimes, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0388001100:156"/>
rely upon the Saviour of the World, that dy'd for our Sins, to pardon mine. With that, he croſs'd himſelf, and expir'd.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, I was very ſorry for the unhappy Accident of his Death; but yet, glad that we were at Liberty; and was ſomething eaſy that the poor Soul repented before his Expiration; not doubting but the piercing Eye of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſaw that if he had ſurviv'd, he would have liv'd a good Chriſtian. And ſure the Almighty's infinite Stock of Bounty, has enough Mercy to ſave the repenting Soul, tho' late before his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance comes.</p>
            <p>After we had ſecur'd our <hi>Tartars,</hi> we threw Mr. <hi>Warren</hi> Over-board, and bore up to the Wind; for after our firſt tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about in the Morning, when the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle happen'd, they bore away with Tack at Cat-head, as being for their Purpoſe. The three Men that were left, deſir'd us to let 'em have the Boat, and go ſeek their Companions; which we refus'd, as not having Hands enough to carry our Veſſel to <hi>Jamaica.</hi> But we promis'd 'em, if they wou'd freely work in the Voyage,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0388001100:157"/>
they ſhou'd have their intire Liberty to go where they thought fit, without any Complaints againſt them. Upon this, we began to be a little ſociable as before, and they all declar'd, that what they did was by the Inſtigation of <hi>Warren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Day we diſcover'd a Ship to Windward of us, that bore down upon us with crowded Sails. We fill'd all the Sails we had, and endeavour'd to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from her as faſt as we cou'd, but all to no Purpoſe; we ſaw they gain'd upon us every Moment, and therefore ſeeing it was not poſſible for us to eſcape, we back'd our Sails and laid by for 'em, that they might be more civil if they were Enemies. As ſoon as ever they came up with us, they hail'd us, and order'd us to come on Board, which we durſt not deny; when Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> and I, with <hi>Hood</hi> and <hi>White</hi> for Rowers, went on Board 'em. We found by <hi>Hood</hi>'s knowing 'em, that they were his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Comrades. Now, as <hi>Hood</hi> ſaid, we did not know how we ſhou'd behave our ſelves, or what we ſhou'd ſay about <hi>Warren;</hi> but we only told the Captain
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0388001100:158"/>
how we met with his Men, and that they were redeem'd upon my Account. He never ask'd particularly for <hi>Warren,</hi> but how they All did; but when they ſent on Board to ſearch our Veſſel, they ſoon came to the Truth on't; for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three told 'em the Story, tho' not with aggravating Circumſtances: Upon which, poor <hi>Hood</hi> was ty'd to their Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt, laſh'd with a Cat of Nine-Tails moſt abominably; and after that pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled in Brine, which was more Pain than the Whipping; but it kept his Back from feſtering, which it might otherwiſe have done; becauſe they flea the Skin off at every Stroke, and to prevent it, they waſh it with Brine; which is call'd <hi>Whipping</hi> and <hi>Pickeling.</hi> After this they wou'd not keep him among 'em; but ſent for the other three Men from our Veſſel, and order'd us all on Board, with another of their Men that was ill of a dangerous Fever, which they fear'd might prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious. They did not take any Thing from us, as we expected at firſt, only gave us this ſick Man to look after, which we were very well contented with.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0388001100:159"/>
So we parted with 'em very well ſatisfy'd, but much better when we were out of Sight, fearing they had forgot them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and wou'd ſend for us back, and take our Proviſion from us, or one Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief or another; for Pyrates do not often uſe to be ſo courteous.</p>
            <p>Our ſick Man mended apace, for we took great Care of him, and by keeping him low, only with Water-Gruel, his Fever left him; when I began to keep up his Spirits with my Cordials that I had by me, and in a Week's Time he was pretty hoddy, (as we call it at Sea). Now we began to converſe with him, and he ſeem'd to be a ſenſible good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humour'd Fellow.</p>
            <p>Among other Diſcourſe, we ask'd him how Captain <hi>M—ll</hi> and his Crew got a Ship? Says he, I can only tell the Story as I heard it; (for I was ſick on Shore) which is as follows:</p>
            <p>Sixteen of our Men got a <hi>Paragua</hi> from the <hi>Indians,</hi> who hate the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> tho' under their Subjection, and love the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> very well; theſe ſet out to ſeize upon the firſt Ship
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0388001100:160"/>
that they thought they cou'd compaſs; when after being five Days Cruiſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long Shore, they ſpy'd a large Ship wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering <hi>Cape Catoch;</hi> but believing it to be too ſtrong for 'em, they reſolv'd to work by Stratagem, thus: Twelve Men laid down in the Boat, as if very faint and weak, and made a Signal to the Ship, as if in Diſtreſs, who very charitably brought too; now they had no Arms with 'em, for when they reſolv'd to uſe this Stratagem, they left 'em a-Shore, as making the Pretence more feaſible; ſo that when they arriv'd at the Ship, they all went feebly up, as if not able to ſtand; nay, ſome were oblig'd to be led, forſooth, to colour the Matter the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They then told 'em that their Ship was caſt away upon <hi>Logerhead</hi>'s <hi>Key,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three Leagues from <hi>Cape Catoch,</hi> and ſaving themſelves in their Boats, they got ſafe into the <hi>Cape;</hi> but that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering up in the Country, they were met by the <hi>Indians,</hi> who us'd 'em bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly, killing Eleven of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and wou'd have ſerv'd the reſt ſo, if they had not made their Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0388001100:161"/>
in that <hi>Paragua;</hi> that they were ſo harraſs'd for want of Food, having been without eating two Days, that they fear'd ſome of their Companions wou'd never recover.</p>
            <p>The poor <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſwallow'd the Bait, and their Captain being a very good Man, reſolv'd to relieve 'em, and ask'd 'em what they wou'd have him to do for 'em? They beg'd him to land 'em on the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colony, or Iſland in their Way. He anſwer'd, he was bound for St. <hi>Domingo</hi> in <hi>Hiſpaniola;</hi> but that he wou'd put in at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> tho' ſomething out of his Way; yet, ſays he, I don't care for going to any of the noted Ports, becauſe there is a War talk'd of between <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and tho' it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd they might meet with ſome Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. They were mightily oblig'd to him, they ſaid, but they did not know how to return the Obligation, but by praying for him and his.</p>
            <p>They ſail'd very lovingly with 'em for three or four Days, till at laſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune gave them an Opportunity to put their Enterprize in Execution. They
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0388001100:162"/>
had Notice that the Ship leak'd migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and that the Water came into the Bread-Room; upon which, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> went down to remove the Bread to get at the Leak, and did not leave more than five Men and the Captain above, whom they inſtantly ſeiz'd, and clap'd down the Hatches upon the reſt. When they had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd them, they arm'd themſelves with Piſtols and Launces, which were plac'd in the Steerage of the Ship, and ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulated with 'em; but firſt, they ſteer'd their Courſe back again, that they might not loſe any Time. As they came up, one by one, they bound them, till they were all ſo, but the Captain and the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot: The Captain they confin'd to his Cabbin, with a Centry to guard him; but they let the Pilot go looſe, that he might ſteer the Ship. O inhuman! cry'd I! thus the Snake in the friendly Boſom warm'd, turns and ſtings his kind Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector: Thus was their generous <hi>Hoſt</hi> (if I may call him ſo) betray'd by his too much good Nature.</p>
            <p>After they had brought the Ship ſafe to us, we embark'd, and put the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0388001100:163"/>
on Shore without a Morſel to help themſelves; nay, if the <hi>Indians</hi> cou'd conveniently meet with 'em, they wou'd not leave one alive. I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, purſu'd the Man, that the barbarous Story ſhock'd my very Nature, and made me hate their Society; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally believe the Abhorrence of this curs'd Action brought my Diſtemper upon me.</p>
            <p>How much are ſome Beaſts Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of Kindneſs more than Man? A poor Cur, fed but with a Cruſt a Day, will follow ſtill the bounteous Hand that gives it. Ingratitude is the Fountain of all other Crimes, for from thence flow all the reſt. But all the Knowledge ſome Men are endow'd with, is but to find the beſt Way to deceive. How happy it would be, if ſuch Creatures cou'd ſhake off their Humanity, and become Beaſts in Form as well as Mind; then we ſhou'd have a Mark to ſhun 'em by. Our Creator has form'd all Kind of Beaſts in Shapes that tell us what they are: But Men differ in their Natures more than Beaſts, or are indeed under their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Form, the very Natures of the Brute
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0388001100:164"/>
Creation. How many Villains, under a ſmooth Face and Tongue, betray their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? The Father cheats the Son, the Son the Father, Mothers ſquander the Dowry of their Daughters, and then proſtitute 'em to gain 'em Bread; which is not Gain but Puniſhment: But Ingratitude, like Murder, meets with its Puniſhment on Earth, as well as in the other World; and an ungrateful Man ſhou'd have a Mark that all Human Society may ſhun him. I think the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> us'd to puniſh Ingratitude with Death, as a Crime equal to Sacriledge or Parricide.</p>
            <p>After having taken all their Men on Board, (and leaving Directions on a Bark of a Tree, for the five Men that were gone upon the ſame Deſign ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Way;) we ſet ſail, and had not been out two Days before we met with you. Pray, ſays I, how came you among 'em, if you lik'd not their Deſign? Why, Sir, anſwer'd he by Accident; Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking from <hi>Bermudas,</hi> bound for St. <hi>Catherines,</hi> or the Iſle of <hi>Providence,</hi> we were met by this Pyrate in a Ship of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0388001100:165"/>
twenty Guns, and a hundred and twenty Men, who took us, and rumaging us, threaten'd to turn us a-drift without Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, if we wou'd not embrace his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which was Pyracy. We, rather than undergo what he threaten'd us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, conſented with our Tongues; but our Inclinations were far from it. And from our firſt being with him, we were plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make our Eſcape the next Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. But the other four (being but five in all in our Veſſel) were unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kill'd in that Engagement, where they loſt their Ship. What Ship was it they fought with? Why, Sir, a Man of War of twenty ſix Guns, ſent out on Purpoſe to take her; for the Captain had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſuch Diſorders where-ever he came, that he oblig'd the Governour of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> to ſend out the Ship call'd the <hi>Experiment,</hi> to cruiſe till ſhe met with him; which ſhe did about five Weeks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. Our Captain, as ſoon as he ſaw her, gueſs'd at her Deſign, and reſolv'd to fight her to the laſt; well knowing if he could take or ſink her, he might be pretty ſecure to range where he pleas'd,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0388001100:166"/>
there being never another Ship of War nearer than <hi>Barbadoes;</hi> who never came ſo far Weſt. After he had made a Speech to his Men to encourage them to fight it out, and told 'em their Advantage, they conſented to hoiſt the Bloody Flag, and neither to give or take Quarter. As ſoon as ever the Man of War ſaw our Bloody Flag out, they hoiſted theirs, and there enſu'd a dreadful Fight. We began about two a-Clock, and fought till dark Night, without perceiving any Advantage on either Side; and then by Conſent lay by till Morning without fighting; which we did ſo nigh, it being calm, that we cou'd talk to one another; but we did it only in threatning Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. As ſoon as the Morning dawn'd, we went to it agen, with more Fury than before, for our People fought like deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Madmen, well knowing if they ſhou'd be taken, they muſt all die. The other Ship fought with a Bravery un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common; but I believe the Advantage was on our Side, tho' we had kill'd on Board us thirty ſix Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0388001100:167"/>
We fought on till Noon, when we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd a Ship about three Leagues to Windward of us, which bore down upon us with all the Sail they cou'd. We ſoon conjectur'd, they cou'd be no Friends to us, ſo without much Conſultation, we reſolv'd to run it before the Wind, with all the Sail we cou'd make; as for the <hi>Experiment</hi> we fought with, we had put it out of their Power to follow us, being we had ſhot their Main-Maſt by the Board, ſo that if the other overtook us we ſhou'd have but one to deal with. We by good Fortune had all our Maſts firm, and we out-ſail'd the other Veſſel; but as ſoon as ſhe came up with the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,</hi> (who never offer'd to follow us) ſhe laid by, as we ſuppoſe to aſſiſt her, and we obſerv'd thro' our Teleſcopes that ſhe had <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colours out.</p>
            <p>We ſoon loſt Sight of 'em, and then we deſign'd to change our Courſe, but were prevented by the Men diſcovering two Foot Water in the Hold; who cou'd not find out the Leak, tho' they ſearch'd with all the Dilligence they cou'd. So we were oblig'd to Pump, but all that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0388001100:168"/>
we cou'd do, the Water ſtill gain'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, we reſolv'd to bear away to <hi>Jucatan,</hi> a Province belonging to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and ſeek out ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Place unfrequented by them, where we might find out our Leak, and ſtop it.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding our Labour in Pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Water gain'd upon us; ſo we put out our Long-Boat, and our Pinnace, in order to put in our Proviſion; which by Morning we effected, and very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily for us; for it was agreed upon all Hands, the Ship cou'd not ſwim above Eight Hours; and tho' we diſcover'd Land, and were not above ſix Leagues off Shore, yet we were afraid we cou'd not reach it, being the Ship was ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy with Water. So all that cou'd not ſwim were order'd into the two Boats, with their Arms; which held in 'em thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeven Men with Officers. They that were left on Board, had Orders to Pump as long as they cou'd, and run direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into Shore to the Leeward of <hi>Cape Catoch;</hi> but within half a League off the Place the Ship ſunk, and the Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0388001100:169"/>
themſelves to ſwiming, which we met with our Pinnace, and took up.</p>
            <p>I cannot omit one barbarous Action of the Captain's. There was five Men wounded, who beg'd to be taken into the Boat, but the Captain refus'd 'em; and this was his Reaſon, as he gave to us in the Boat. Says he, thoſe five that are wounded, will take up too much Room, being they can't ſit as we do, but muſt lie along; and another Thing is, they will take more Time in looking after, than we can well ſpare. Beſides, as I believe they won't recover, they will be the ſooner out of their Pain; and if they ſhou'd recover, added he, they wou'd help us to devour our Proviſion, which we muſt take particular Care of, for we know not when we ſhall get more. I muſt confeſs, this Uſage ſtruck me to the Heart almoſt, eſpecially as to one of 'em, who ſeem'd to have a Senſe of his Condition, and repented of all his paſt Crimes.</p>
            <p>After we were on Shore, we found that we had kill'd on Board us forty three Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the five that our Captain barbarouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0388001100:170"/>
murder'd, by leaving 'em in the Ship when ſhe ſunk. Two of their Bodies were drove on Shore the next Day, but were order'd by the Captain to have Stones ty'd to their Feet, and carry'd off Shore and ſunk. As ſoon as we had made us two Tents with Sails that were put in the Boat for that Purpoſe, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſult in what Manner they ſhou'd get a Ship; when one <hi>Warren</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to take the Boat, and four Men beſide himſelf, with Arms, and a Week's Proviſion, for he wou'd not have any more, and go to the Bay of <hi>Campeache,</hi> or <hi>Campeche</hi> Town, where he did not fear getting a Veſſel for their Purpoſe; being he ſaid he had done ſo upon the like Occaſion before. Whereupon the Boat and four Men were order'd for him; but he ſtaying longer than the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Time, they thought ſome Miſchance had happen'd to him, ſo took off their Thoughts of having any Veſſel from him. One Day they ſpy'd a large <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragua</hi> coming towards Shore with Nine <hi>Indians,</hi> and two <hi>Spaniards</hi> in't, and finding it come ſo near, that they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0388001100:171"/>
muſt of Courſe ſee 'em, they immediately reſolv'd either to take or kill 'em all, for fear they ſhou'd diſcover 'em to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> before they had got a Veſſel to go off again.</p>
            <p>Tho' I muſt confeſs there was ſome Reaſon, yet I thought it barbarous to ſee how they murder'd the two <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and nine <hi>Indians.</hi> They put out their Pinnace and ten Men well arm'd, to go and take this <hi>Paragua;</hi> as ſoon as ever they were diſcover'd by the <hi>Indians,</hi> they jump'd Over-board, and made towards Shore; but were ſhot by our Men, or knock'd on the Head with the Butt-End of their Muſquets. The two <hi>Spaniards</hi> had a new Kind of Death; they ty'd 'em, Breaſt to Breaſt, and their Hands behind 'em, and threw 'em Over-board; where they ſtruggl'd for ſome Time, and at laſt were drown'd. I thought this was a Cruelty exceeding all the Tyrants in the World, and if I had had a Boat, and our People never a one, I wou'd have run any Hazard to have ſav'd 'em. Their <hi>Paragua</hi> was laden with Flower, and dry'd Fiſh, with ſeveral Sides of dry'd
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0388001100:172"/>
Pork, or Bacon; which was too good for the People that had it. As for my own Part, but little of it came to my Share, for I was taken ill the ſecond Day after we came there, and ſo weak and feeble, that I did not expect to overcome it; and if it had not been for a Black, that was Trumpeter to the Captain, I ſhou'd have periſh'd for want of Suſtenance; but the poor Fellow frequently wou'd bring me ſomething or other to nouriſh me; and it is to him, under God, that I owe my Life. He wou'd often tell me that he did not love that ſort of Life, and wiſh'd he cou'd get rid of his Maſter; but, ſays he, if he did but know I had as much as a Thought that Way, he wou'd be the Death of me. I believe this was the only poor Fellow that pray'd in the whole Crew. He was chriſten'd at <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> (and had very good Notions of Religion) where he was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to his preſent Maſter, who had made ſeveral Voyages into the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> for a <hi>Plymouth</hi> Merchant; but at laſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matters on Shore go but indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and having kill'd a <hi>French</hi> Officer
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0388001100:173"/>
there, ſeiz'd upon the Ship he us'd to Command, and with a Crew of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Fellows made off to Sea, and ſteer'd his old Courſe for the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and there commenc'd Pyrate; but had met with no other Succeſs, than what has been related to you.</p>
            <p>Says I, this Fellow's too wicked to have Succeſs in any Thing, eſpecially when Succeſs muſt be an Addition to his Crimes: If it were poſſible to know his Fate, we ſhou'd find that he wou'd have ſome deſperate End: For Men when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd by Providence Divine, tho' perhaps they may meet with ſome Succeſs at firſt, at laſt find an End that's fitted for ſuch Wretches, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Superior Being; and even Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, notwithſtanding their Human Form, are no better than Brutes; nay, I take an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> or <hi>Deiſt,</hi> to have far leſs Right to Salvation, than thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> that pray to the Devil; for they do it thro' Ignorance, and Worſhip him with a more ſincere Devotion, becauſe they know 'tis in his Power to do 'em Harm. With what a fervent Zeal wou'd they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0388001100:174"/>
ſerve the true God, if they knew (as all who profeſs Chriſtianity do) that it is in his Power to beſtow Bleſſings, even after this Life. With what Devotion they Worſhip the Sun, who they take to be the Superior Deity, becauſe it makes the Earth green, and is the ſecond Cauſe of all the Good they enjoy? Then, with how much more Reverence ought we to give Praiſe to that Power that lends Light and general Heat to that Planet? If an Atheiſt wou'd conſider the Works of Nature juſtly, he would find it an Impoſſibility to be ſo any longer; and to fancy this World was form'd by Chance or Accident, is to allow Beaſts the Privileges of Nature and Reaſon, to as great a Degree as we that pretend to Humanity.</p>

               <hi>John Rouſe</hi> was the Name of this Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or we took on Board, born at <hi>Bermudas.</hi> He offer'd us ſome Propoſals if we wou'd go along with him thither; but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd it, as wanting to be with my old Ship's Crew, and thought of ſeeing my own Country again, as I believe all Travellers have, who bring nothing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0388001100:175"/>
Home but Misfortunes, or the Vices of the Places they have travel'd thro'. From this Man, ſaid <hi>Rouſe,</hi> I had the following ſhort Deſcription of <hi>Bermudas,</hi> or the <hi>Summer Iſlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bermudas,</hi> (the Place of my Birth) or the <hi>Summer Iſlands,</hi> is ſuppos'd by ſome, to take its Name of <hi>Bermudas</hi> from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Black Hogs that came out of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship that was caſt away on thoſe Shores. And by others from one <hi>John Bermudas,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the firſt Diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Iſlands. The Name <hi>Summer Iſlands,</hi> is deriv'd from <hi>George Summers,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, who ſuffer'd Shipwreck there. They are ſituated in thirty two Degrees, and twenty five Minutes of Northern Latitude; Sixteen Hundred Leagues from <hi>England;</hi> Twelve Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from <hi>Madera;</hi> Four Hundred from <hi>Hiſpaniola;</hi> and about Three Hundred from <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New England.</hi> The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> had it firſt, and after them the <hi>French;</hi> but the Supplies that were ſent 'em from <hi>France</hi> miſcarrying by Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck, they were oblig'd to abandon the Iſlands. After this, one <hi>Wing field,</hi> a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0388001100:176"/>
Merchant in <hi>London,</hi> ſent in two Ships, Captain <hi>Goſnel</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> with People to ſettle there; but there was not much done till 1612. when a Company was Eſtabliſh'd at <hi>London</hi> by Letters Patents, given by King <hi>James</hi> the firſt, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent Captain <hi>Moor</hi> with ſixty five Men, where he was two Years in fortifying the Iſlands againſt the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of any Invaſion from either <hi>French, Spaniards,</hi> or <hi>Indians.</hi> In the mean Time a ſort of Rats ſo increas'd, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd every Thing that was Green in the whole Iſland, and had like to have ſtarv'd the Inhabitants, if Providence had not timely ſent a Diſeaſe among 'em that conſum'd 'em All. In about three Years after the firſt Plantation by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Moor,</hi> there was ſent 'em another Supply of Men and Proviſion, by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Bartlet,</hi> who return'd with a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Weight of Ambergreeſe. The next Year, there arriv'd five hundred Men and Women, with Tradeſmen of all Sorts. In 1616. one <hi>Tuckard</hi> ſucceeded in the Government, and was very ſerviceable to the Plantation, in bringing and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0388001100:177"/>
ſeveral Trees, and Tobacco. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo divided the Country into Acres, and parcell'd it out to the Tenants. It en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd daily in Culture and Inhabitants. The Form of the Iſlands as they lie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles ſomething of a Lobſter with its Claws off. The Chief of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands is call'd <hi>George Iſland,</hi> and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Eight Parts, beſides the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Land. 1. <hi>Hamilton Tribe;</hi> 2. <hi>Smith</hi>'s <hi>Tribe;</hi> 3. <hi>Devonſhire Tribe;</hi> 4. <hi>Pembroke Tribe;</hi> 5. <hi>Paget</hi>'s <hi>Tribe;</hi> 6. <hi>Warwick Tribe;</hi> 7. <hi>Southampton Tribe;</hi> 8. <hi>Sandy</hi>'s <hi>Tribe.</hi> The Iſlands are all ſurrounded by Rocks, that at High-Water are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to Strangers. The Chief Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are <hi>Southampton, Harrinton,</hi> and the <hi>Great Sound.</hi> Upon St. <hi>George</hi>'s <hi>Iſland,</hi> they have built ſeveral large and ſtrong Forts, whoſe Chief are <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Dover</hi> Forts. The Soil in ſome Places is Sandy or Claye; and in other Places Aſh-colour'd, White, and Black; about two Foot deep under the Aſh, is found great Slates, which the Inhabitants make uſe of ſeveral Ways; and under that Black is found a Stony Subſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0388001100:178"/>
ſomething like a Spunge, or Pummice-Stone. The Wells, and Pits, Ebb and Flow with the Sea, yet produce excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent freſh Water. The Sky is generally ſerene; but when 'tis o'er-caſt they have dreadful Thunder and Lightning. The Air is much the ſame as with you in <hi>England.</hi> They have two Harveſts in the Year: They Sow in <hi>March,</hi> and Reap in <hi>June;</hi> then they Sow in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and Gather in <hi>January:</hi> And from that Month till <hi>May,</hi> the Whales frequently ſwim by them. They often find great Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Ambergreece, and ſometimes Pearl Oyſters. No venomous Creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will live in any of the ſaid Iſlands. The yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low large Spiders have not the leaſt Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom in 'em. There's Plenty of all Sorts of Cattle, both Wild and Tame, eſpecially Hogs, who have mightily encreas'd ſince their firſt Landing; but they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo fat as we could wiſh, feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only on Berries that fall from the Palmeto-Trees, which are very ſweet. There's Plenty of Mulberies, both White and Red, which produce prodigious Numbers of Silk-Worms; who ſpin Silk

of the Colour of the Berry. The Trees are here of different Kinds; the Cedar is reckon'd the Largeſt in the Univerſe. The Leaves are downy, and prickly at the End: The Berries that it produceth are of a pale Red which incloſe four White Kernels; the Outermoſt Skin is ſweet; the Innermoſt that contains the Kernel, is ſharp; and the Pulp is tartiſh. The Tree is always flouriſhing, being at the ſame Time full of Bloſſoms, green, and ripe Fruit. The Berries when ripe begin to gape, and fall off in Rainy Weather; leaving a round Stalk on the Boughs, which loſes not its Rind till that Time two Years after. The Berry requires one Year before it comes to its full Ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which happens about <hi>December.</hi> The Boughs ſhoot upwards, and in a little Time are ſo heavy, that they weigh down the Body of the Tree. There are many Plants, as the Prickle Pear, Poyſon Weed, Red Weed, Purging Bean, Red Pepper, and the Coſtive Tree, and the Sea Feather, which grows on the Brink of the Sea. There is another Plant call'd <hi>Nuchtly,</hi> which grows in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0388001100:180"/>
the Niches of the Rocks, waſh'd by the Waves of the Sea, and produces a Fruit like a Pear, which they call the <hi>Speckl'd Pear,</hi> from its Spots. For Fowls, we have all Sorts that <hi>England</hi> produces, beſides a great Number of Cranes, larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than any I have ſeen elſewhere; with a ſort of Fowl that lives in Holes in the Rocks, like Rabbets. As for Tortoiſes, they are as good there as any where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They catch them in this Manner; they watch for 'em at Night, when they come on Shore to dig Holes to bury their Eggs in; while they are doing of it, they turn 'em on their Backs, and not being able to get upon their Legs again, they are eaſily taken. Some will have a Hundred Eggs in 'em about as big as a common Tennis-Ball, and very round; but a thin Skin, and the Yolk lies on the Side of the Skin, or Shell, and may be ſeen on the Out-ſide: Theſe hidden in the Sand, are nouriſh'd by the Sun, and never minded by the Tortoiſe that lays 'em; and as ſoon as ever they have broke the Shell, they all run into the Sea. Some ſay they are full ſix Years a

Chappels. In the Year 1616, five Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſet ſail from thence in an open Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of about Three Tun, and after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuffer'd ſeveral Storms and Tempeſts, were ſafely landed at <hi>Kingſale</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> have made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Attempts upon thoſe Iſlands; but always were drove away with conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Loſs.</p>
            <p>About a Month before I embark'd for this unfortunate Voyage, we took a <hi>French</hi> Pyrate, who was ſo inſolent as to come into <hi>Harrinton</hi>'s <hi>Sound,</hi> even at Noon-Day, and cut the Cables of a Merchant-man, richly laden, bound for <hi>England;</hi> but by good Fortune run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Flats in the Mouth of the <hi>Sound,</hi> in going out again: So we had Time to Man ſome Boats with ſome of the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Garriſon, and ſend to their Relief, where there happen'd a deſperate Fight for ſome Time; but more Forces going to the Aſſiſtance of the others, they took 'em after an obſtinate Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, killing twenty ſeven of their Men, and loſing eleven of our own. The Captain made his Eſcape in his Boat,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0388001100:185"/>
in the latter End of the Engagement, when he perceiv'd his Danger; but was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to go on Shore on <hi>Ireland Iſland</hi> for ſome Proviſion, where he, and four Men that were with him, were ſecur'd, and ſent to <hi>Tucker</hi>'s <hi>Town;</hi> where they were to be try'd the Day I came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>Two Nights after we had parted with the Pyrate, we were encounter'd with a dreadful Storm, that laſted two Days without abating; and out poor Bark, which was none of the beſt, was tumbl'd and toſs'd like a Tennis-Ball, yet we receiv'd no Damage, but that ſhe wou'd not anſwer the Helm; ſo that we were oblig'd to let her go before the Tempeſt, and truſt to the Mercy of Heav'n for Relief. This Storm and the Danger we had eſcap'd from the Pyrate, put me in Mind of theſe four Lines of the foremention'd Poet, the celebrated <hi>Waller.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Bold were the Men, which on the Ocean firſt</l>
               <l>Spread their new Sails, when Shipwreck was the Worſt.</l>
               <l>More Danger now from Man alone we find,</l>
               <l>Than from the Rocks, the Billows or the Wind.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0388001100:186"/>
We, in the Middle of the Storm diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd Land right a Head, which put us all into our Pannicks; we endeavour'd to bring our Veſſel to bear up to the Wind, but all to no Purpoſe; for ſhe ſtill drove nearer the Shore, where we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd ſeveral Tokens of a Shipwreck, as Pieces of broken Maſts, and Barrels ſwiming on the Water, and a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens Hats; then we began to think we ſhou'd certainly run the ſame Fate, when as ſoon as thought our Bark was drove on Shore, in a ſmooth ſandy Bay, but where we had Opportunity to quit her, which was happy for us; for the Sea waſh'd over her with ſuch Violence, we had not any Hopes of her eſcaping the Storm, but thought of Courſe we ſhou'd be torn to Pieces.</p>
            <p>When we were a-Shore, we all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it cou'd be no other Part but the South of <hi>Cuba Iſland,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> We were then in a terrible Fright, leſt we were near any Part that belong'd to the <hi>Indians;</hi> for Mr. <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> aſſur'd me, that there were ſome Parts of the South<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Side of <hi>Cuba,</hi> that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0388001100:187"/>
dwelt in, in Spite of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and Maſſacre'd them where-ever they met 'em, or any other Whites. We lay all Night in terrible Fear, and tho' we found the Storm abated, or rather a Calm ſucceeded, yet we durſt not ſtir till the Moon roſe, and then we all walk'd towards our Veſſel, which we found all on one Side; but by good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune moſt of our Proviſions was dry, which mightily rejoyc'd us; but all the Veſſel's Riging and Maſts were ſhatter'd and torn to Pieces, and ſome Part of her Quarter wrung off, that ſhe cou'd not be of any Uſe to us if we cou'd have got her upright. But we took out all our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and our Arms, with two Barrels of Gun-Powder that was dry, the reſt being damag'd with Water and Sand that had got in. We had Arms enough, as having them that belong'd to the three Sailors that were taken in the Pyrate, which we ſuppos'd they had forgot; ſo we were ſix Men well arm'd, with each a Muſquet, a Caſe of Piſtols, and a Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onet; beſide two Cutlaſſes, if Need were.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0388001100:188"/>
By that Time we had taken every Thing out, Day approach'd, and then we deſign'd altogether, well arm'd, to go and view the Country. <hi>John Rouſe</hi> was very well recover'd of his Fever, but a little weak, yet his Heart was as good as the Beſt of us. So we reſolv'd if we were ſet upon by <hi>Indians,</hi> to defend our ſelves to the laſt Drop of Blood, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to die by their Hands in Fight, than to be tortur'd after the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they inflict upon all the <hi>Whites</hi> they get into their Hands. But ſtill we had ſome Hopes that we were too far to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Northward for 'em.</p>
            <p>When we had plac'd our Proviſion and other Neceſſaries ſafe behind a Tuft of Trees that grew cloſe by the Water Side, we fix'd our Arms, and ventur'd to walk up in the Country, which we did almoſt every Way that Day, four or five Miles; but cou'd not diſcover any Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor any Sign of Inhabitants, only in one Place the Graſs ſeem'd to be late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troden, but whether by Man or Beaſt we cou'd not diſcover; ſo being pretty well tir'd, we went back again to our
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0388001100:189"/>
Station, where we eat heartily, and at Night we laid our ſelves upon the Graſs, and fell aſleep, for we durſt not lie upon the Sails we had got for that Purpoſe, being they were not dry, tho' ſpread all Day long.</p>
            <p>I was awaken'd the next Morning by a Company of <hi>Lizards</hi> creeping over me, which is an Animal frightful enough to look at, but very Harmleſs, and great Lovers of Mankind; they ſay, that theſe Creatures, if a Perſon lies aſleep, and any voracious Beaſt, or the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligator,</hi> which comes on Shore often, is approaching the Place where you lie, will crawl to you as faſt as they can, and with their forked Tongues tickle you till you awake, that you may avoid by their timely Notice the coming Danger. I got up, being rowz'd by theſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and look'd about me, but ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an odd Kind of a Snake about two Foot long, having a Head ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a Weeſel, and Eyes fiery like a Cat's; as ſoon as it ſpy'd me it ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and my Dog after it, but he did not kill it; but I believe put it in a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0388001100:190"/>
Fright, for it made a Noiſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a Weeſel, but louder, which awaken'd my Companions. When I told Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> what I had ſeen, he ſaid it was a ſmall Serpent, but not very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, call'd the <hi>Guabiniquinaze Serpent,</hi> from eating a little Creature of that Name, ſomething reſembling a ſmall Mole; and the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> eat of 'em, and reckon 'em dainty Food.</p>
            <p>We now reſolv'd for another Walk, to diſcover what Inhabitants were our Neighbours, whether <hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;</hi> if <hi>Indians,</hi> we deſign'd to patch up our Boat, which had ſeveral Holes in't, and make off as faſt as we cou'd, and Row Northward, till we came to ſome Place inhabited by <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But if we found the Latter, to beg Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſome Means to get to <hi>Jamaica;</hi> whereupon we ventur'd out with theſe Reſolutions. We met with ſeveral fine large Cedar Trees, and one particularly ſo large, that Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> and I cou'd but juſt fathom it with our Hands joyn'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0388001100:191"/>
We had not gone far before my Dog be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bark, when turning my Head on one Side, I beheld a Black approaching towards us, and being ſtartled at the Sight, I cock'd my Piece, and reſolv'd to fire at him; but he call'd to me in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and told me he did not come to do any Harm, but was a poor diſtreſs'd <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> that wanted Food, and was almoſt ſtarv'd, having eat nothing but Wild Fruit for four Days. Upon that I let him come near, where he was ſoon known by Mr <hi>Rouſe</hi> to be <hi>Willam Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> the Black that was Trumpeter to the Captain that commanded the Pyrate Ship. Upon his knowing him, we ſat down and gave him ſome Proviſion, which we had brought with us, becauſe we deſign'd to be out all Day.</p>
            <p>After he had refreſh'd himſelf a little, we ask'd him how he came into this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland? Why, anſwer'd he, we were Crui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing about <hi>Cuba,</hi> in Hopes of ſome <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Prize, when a Storm aroſe and drove us upon a Rock, where our Ship was beat to Pieces, and not above Eighteen Men ſav'd beſide the Captain. And did
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0388001100:192"/>
that wicked Wretch eſcape the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck? Yes, anſwer'd <hi>Plymouth,</hi> but to undergo a more violent Death. For, ſays he, as ſoon as ever we landed, we wander'd up in the Country to ſee for ſome Food, without any Weapons but a few Cutlaſſes, having loſt our firſt Arms; but however we all got ſomething or other to defend our ſelves on Shore, as long Clubs, which we got from the Trees we found in our Walks; our Captain reſolv'd if he met with any <hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>Spaniards</hi> Huts, that he wou'd murder all that he found in 'em, for fear they ſhou'd make their Eſcape, and bring more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Thus he encourag'd his Men to follow him with their Clubs; ſays he, we will walk till we find fome beaten Path, and there lie hid till Night, when we may go on to ſome Houſes, and come upon 'em undiſcover'd; by which Means we may get Proviſion and other Arms: For the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Cuba</hi> uſe Fire-Arms as well as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and are full as dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in uſing 'em as any <hi>Europeans,</hi> &amp;c. After travelling about ten Miles to the N. W. we diſcover'd a Path, upon which a Halt was commanded, and to retire in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0388001100:193"/>
to the Woods again till Night; which we did, and din'd upon what Fruits we cou'd get upon the Trees.</p>
            <p>About two Hours before Night a Dog ſmell'd us out, and running away from us, bark'd moſt furiouſly; upon that we were afraid of being diſcover'd, which Fear prov'd true; for in Half an Hour, or thereabouts, after the Dog left us, we were ſaluted with ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and Muſquet-Shot, that kill'd us three Men, and wounded me in the Foot, but it prov'd the Means of ſaving my Life: For as ſoon as our Men perceiv'd what had happen'd, they ran as hard as they cou'd to meet the Danger, as knowing they cou'd do no Good till they came to Handy-Blows; I, in endeavouring to follow 'em, found my Hurt, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my keeping up with the reſt; but I cou'd hear and ſee 'em at it: There was about Two Hundred <hi>Indians</hi> ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Men, and in about Half an Hour kill'd 'em every One. I ſaw the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain lay about him deſperately, but at laſt fell, being run thro' the Throat with a Wooden Stake. As ſoon as ever they had
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0388001100:194"/>
conquer'd 'em. or rather murder'd 'em, they fell to ſtriping of 'em as faſt as they cou'd, and carry'd 'em off, together with their own Dead, which were many, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſold their Lives very dearly.</p>
            <p>After they were all gone, which I ſound by their Screeming and Noiſe at a Diſtance, I ventur'd to ſteal out from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a Row of Buſhes, where I had plac'd my ſelf to ſee what had happen'd; I went to the Place of Battle, where I found two of our Men that they had left, with all their Arms, and ſome of their own; ſo I took up one of their beſt Muſquets, and a Cutlaſs, and made far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Wood, for fear of being caught; which I had certainly been, if I had ſtaid a Quarter of an Hour longer, for I ſoon heard 'em come Hooping, Scream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Hollowing back, to fetch the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two Bodies, and their Arms, as I conjectur'd.</p>
            <p>I walk'd as far as my hurt Foot wou'd let me that Night, and out of Danger of the <hi>Indians</hi> as I thought, and then lay'd me down to ſleep as well as I cou'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0388001100:195"/>
very hungry, and ſadly tir'd, and ſlept pretty well till Morning, when I proceeded forward in my painful Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and directed my Courſe N. E. think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that was the beſt Way to avoid the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> and probably to meet with ſome <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> whom I knew inhabited towards the North; the <hi>Havanna</hi> the Capital City of the whole Iſland being ſeated there. I wander'd for four Days, eating nothing but Fruit in the Woods; but laying my ſelf down about an Hour ago, to reſt my ſelf a little, I thought I heard the Tongues of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> which to my great Joy prov'd true. I left my Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet behind the Buſhes, for fear of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming you; but now after returning God and you Thanks for this time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nouriſhment, I'll go and fetch it, which he did; and we might eaſily know it to be an <hi>Indian</hi> Piece, for they had rudely carv'd it all over with ſeveral Figures of Birds and Beaſts.</p>
            <p>Now, ſaid I to my Companions, you ſee the Reward of Wickedneſs. He was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd by Providence to go on long in his Crimes, tho' ſome are that are inur'd to Ills;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0388001100:196"/>
yet they are overtaken at laſt, when their Crimes are full blown; for tho' Juſtice has Leaden Feet, yet they always find he has Iron Hands: And we too often ſee that he who kills his Adverſary in a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, tho' he eſcape the Law, one time or other meets the ſame Fate himſelf.</p>
            <p>After poor <hi>Plymouth</hi> had refreſh'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, we ſet forward, and walk'd along till we came to a Road that ſeem'd to be a Main Road of the Iſland, by the Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Here we conſulted what we ſhou'd do, whether we ſhou'd go on, or return for more Proviſion; but we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to go a little Diſtance from the Road, for fear we ſhou'd meet with more of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and run the ſame Fate with the other <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi> But <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> told us, we were a great way from that Place where his Countrymen were kill'd; (for <hi>Plymouth,</hi> tho' born in <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> wou'd always call himſelf an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> as being brought over very young,) ſo we reſolv'd one and all to venture.</p>
            <p>We ſent up our Prayers to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for our Safety, and went on with a Faith that we ſhou'd come off with Succeſs;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0388001100:197"/>
but we had not gone far when we heard the Reports of ſeveral Muſquets, and ſhouting in a barbarous Manner, behind us. Looking that Way, we ſaw a <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latto</hi> riding as faſt as ever his Mule cou'd carry him; when he came up to us, he ſtop'd, and cry'd in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> Make haſte, run, for the <hi>Indians</hi> are coming upon you, they have kill'd ſeveral <hi>Spaniards</hi> already, and they are fighting with them. Mr. <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> who underſtood <hi>Spaniſh</hi> very well, interpreted what he ſaid to us; he ask'd him how far they were off? He anſwer'd juſt by, and hearing another Shout, put Spurs to his Mule, and left us in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. We found by the Shouting and the Firing, that they wou'd be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon us, ſo we retir'd out of the Road to let 'em paſs, and laid down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Bellies that they might not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover us. Immediately came by about twenty <hi>Spaniards</hi> on Horſeback, purſu'd by near a hundred <hi>Indians:</hi> Juſt as they came by us one <hi>Spaniard</hi> drop'd, and crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Buſh on the other Side of the Road; and preſently the <hi>Indians</hi> follow'd, ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a horrid Manner, and overtook
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0388001100:198"/>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> again, who being very ſwift on Foot, out-run an ordinary Horſe; and they had thrown away their Fire-Arms, to make them the lighter to run, as we ſuppos'd. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> knew they wou'd ſoon overtake 'em, ſo only run to charge their Piſtols, and ſtand till they came up; then diſcharge 'em, to put 'em in Confuſion; and run again, to prolong the time, in Hopes of ſome Aid. All this we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that crept into the Buſh undiſcover'd by the <hi>Indians,</hi> by Reaſon of the Horſes Feet, and the Duſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he being the Foremoſt in Flight. He told us moreover that about three Leagues farther, there was a Fort belonging to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſtop the <hi>Indians,</hi> they uſing to make Inroads before that Fort was built, even to the Gates of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Havanna.</hi> Upon this we conſulted and reſolv'd to follow, upon the Edge of the Road, to ſee how we cou'd be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting; we ſoon came even with 'em, for they were in a narrow Place, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> kept 'em at Bay pretty well; by good Fortune there was a high Hedge made by Trees all along as we went,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0388001100:199"/>
which hinder'd us from being diſcover'd. Here we reſolv'd to fire upon 'em all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and then run further up, and if poſſible get out into the Road and face 'em. Accordingly we agreed to fire four, and three, and the firſt four to charge again immediately. Mr. <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> Mr. <hi>Middleton,</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> and my ſelf agreed to fire firſt; then <hi>Hood, Rouſe</hi> and <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth;</hi> which as ſoon as we had taken good Aim we did, and firing at their Backs, kill'd four downright, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral, for I had order'd 'em to put two Bullets into each Piece. As ſoon as ever we had fir'd our Muſquets, we let fly one Piſtol each, and then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three fir'd their Guns. As ſoon as <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> had fir'd, he ran and charg'd our four Guns, (he having never a Piſtol) and then we let fly our other Piſtols. With theſe Diſcharges we had kill'd at leaſt fifteen <hi>Indians,</hi> and put the reſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch Frights that they began to run; (for with the Duſt and Buſtle they made, they cou'd hardly diſtinguiſh from whence the Fire came) neither did they ſtop till they met with the poor wounded <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0388001100:200"/>
who had crept out, hearing the Diſcharge of our Pieces, (as we ſuppos'd) they fell upon the poor Fellow with Shouts and Outcries, and tore him to pieces, never minding the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing 'em; who cry'd <hi>Miracalo! Miraca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo!</hi> a Miracle! a Miracle! By this Time we got within twenty Yards of the End of the Hedge, where we Seven fir'd our Muſquets, and left 'em to <hi>Plymouth</hi> to charge; then we ran in upon 'em with our Piſtols, and diſcharg'd 'em cloſe upon 'em. With this laſt Fire we drop'd 'em twelve Men, and they ſcream'd out, and ran away as faſt as they cou'd. We did not think fit to follow 'em, for it was not to any Purpoſe, being they were ſoon out of Sight. We charg'd our Guns and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols again, and the twelve <hi>Spaniards</hi> did the like, they having Nine in the laſt Conflict kill'd, and two deſperately wounded. They gave us Thanks for our Reſcue, and ſaid we were ſurely ſent from Heav'n to their Relief; they let us know they were Tax-gatherers for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and were oblig'd to go in Numbers, and well arm'd, for fear of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0388001100:201"/>
theſe deſperate <hi>Indians;</hi> who, about nine Years ago, ſet upon 'em and kill'd Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of 'em, and but two eſcap'd; but never met with any Moleſtation from that Time till now; ſo that this Time (thinking the Danger over) we leſſen'd our Number from Fifty to Thirty, which I ſuppoſe the <hi>Indians</hi> having Notice of, was the Occaſion of their ſetting upon us. They ſaid it was to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for to go back, for the reſt of their Companions that were kill'd, which being a Mile of, they had taken with 'em.</p>
            <p>We had not gone above half a League onward, but we heard dreadful Shout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as before, and looking behind us, it being a ſtrait Road, we cou'd perceive a Cloud of Duſt, and the <hi>Indians</hi> running full Speed towards us. Upon which, we put down our two wounded Men that were on Horſeback, and mounted upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſpare Horſes. Now we being nineteen Horſemen, reſolv'd to ſtand it: We divided into Ranks, four in a Rank, which made five Ranks; only there was but three in the laſt Rank. So we reſolv'd to keep directly one behind the other, and when the firſt File had
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0388001100:202"/>
fir'd to fall in the Rear, and charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> wou'd make up the three firſt Ranks, as they ſaid they cou'd not in Honour expoſe us to the firſt On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, being we ventur'd our Lives in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Aſſiſtance. We had no Time to diſpute for now they were juſt upon us, and to our Surprize had ſeveral Fire Arms among 'em. As ſoon as they got within a Hundred Paces of us they fir'd, but not above two of their Pieces went off, the reſt were clog'd with Duſt in running, that very happily for us hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd their Diſcharging. The Shot miſs'd us by Providence, and we wou'd not give 'em Time to charge again, but we mov'd forward and fir'd in upon 'em, and did great Execution; when it came to our Turn to fire, we in the Heat forgot our Orders, but after we had diſcharg'd our Guns and Piſtols, we fell in with 'em with our Cutlaſſes, and being rais'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 'em by being on Horſeback, did great Execution; and that with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> charging and firing again, put 'em to the Rout; but now we follow'd 'em being on Horſeback, and diſpers'd 'em
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0388001100:203"/>
ſo that it was impoſſible for 'em to rally any more that Night. However we took four of 'em Priſoners, and tying their Hands behind 'em, faſten'd 'em to two of our foremoſt Horſes, the reſt following after, that they might not get Looſe.</p>
            <p>We were met in the Road by twenty <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, with each a Foot-Soldier behind 'em, who were upon the full Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop to our Aſſiſtance, being alarm'd by the <hi>Mulatto</hi> that rode by; but I believe ſome were glad they came too late. The Officer and the reſt ſaluted us very courteouſly, when they heard how lucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we came to their Aſſiſtance; but fell a whipping the poor naked <hi>Indians</hi> ſo barbarouſly, that tho' they deſerv'd it, I cou'd not bear to ſee it done in cold Blood, and tho' the Blood follow'd every Laſh, yet they never cry'd out. This is the chief Cauſe of the Hatred of the <hi>Indians,</hi> when ever the <hi>Spaniards</hi> get any of 'em in their Power, they put 'em to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Torture; but if, on the contrary, they would uſe 'em civilly, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge 'em now and then, I am ſure they might live in perfect Friendſhip with 'em:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0388001100:204"/>
For the <hi>Indians</hi> are good-natur'd, loving and affable, till they are incens'd, and then they are implacable.</p>
            <p>We arriv'd at the Fort about Evening, and were very well entertain'd. The Officer did not doubt but to procure us a Ship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to tranſport us to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> tho' they had Orders from <hi>Havanna</hi> to ſecure all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels, there being a War talk'd of between the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Dutch.</hi> The next Day the Officer mightily brag'd of being an old <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that is, born in <hi>Spain,</hi> and of an ancient Family; and Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> made us very merry upon the Road, in interpreting the Don's Speeches. We found all along from the Fort, a great many Gentlemens Houſes pleaſantly ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and the Country all along yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delightful Proſpects.</p>
            <p>We were well entertain'd at a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Houſe at Dinner, with Proviſions dreſs'd after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Way, and all manner of Sweetmeats and cool Wines. The Gentleman had a Vault or Cellar thirty Foot deep under Ground. He ſpoke pretty good <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and had been
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0388001100:205"/>
a Factor ſeveral Years in <hi>London,</hi> and knew our Cuſtoms and Manners very well, and prefer'd our Way of dreſſing Victuals before their own. He had an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cook from a <hi>Tavern</hi> behind the <hi>Royal-Exchange,</hi> that he brought with him into <hi>Spain,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Cuba,</hi> where he had a vaſt Eſtate left him. His Cook's Name was <hi>Hodges,</hi> a good underſtanding Fellow, and made very much of us, and wou'd fain have had us to ſtay with his Maſter longer. But as ſoon as we had din'd, we were oblig'd to get on Horſeback, and away for the <hi>Havanna,</hi> which we reach'd about ſix a-Clock in the Evening. We had Rooms alloted us, and ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Men came to ſee us, that liv'd there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Havanna</hi> is the Capital City of the whole Iſland of <hi>Cuba,</hi> and has as great a Trade as any Place belonging to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> It has one of the fineſt Harbours in the Univerſe, not for its Greatneſs, but its Security, yet able to contain five hundred Ships of the greateſt Burthen. The Mouth of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0388001100:206"/>
the Harbour is commanded by a Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and a ſquare Fort, faſten'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a ſtrong Boom, or Iron Chain, that no Ship can enter. The moſt ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Part of the whole Harbour, is eight Fathom Water, and all its Banks is pav'd round with flat Stone, ſo that a Veſſel of a Thouſand Tun may lay her Side to it and unlade. Juſt between the two Forts there ſtands a round Water Tower, where they diſcover to the Town how many Veſſels are coming towards the Harbour by putting out a Flag for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ship. This Place is the beſt fortify'd and garriſon'd in all the <hi>Indies,</hi> to ſecure the Plate Fleet, and all other Ships that meet here, to ſet Sail altogether for <hi>Spain.</hi> This City is very large, near as big as <hi>Briſtol</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are handſomely built, but after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faſhion. There are Two hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Churches, fine, and well built, with Spires, and an Organ in each, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſeveral Chappels; and a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en laid for a third Church while we were there. This City almoſt as ſoon as it was built, was ſack'd by a <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0388001100:207"/>
Pyrate in the Year 1536, who was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thither by a Tempeſt, and landing his Men well arm'd, took the City in Spite of all their Reſiſtance, and burnt many of the Houſes, they being moſt part Wood; and had conſum'd 'em all, had not the <hi>Spaniards</hi> redeem'd the reſt by paying 'em a Thouſand Ducats. Upon the receiving of the Money, they made out to Sea, and the ſame Evening came into the <hi>Havanna</hi> three Ships from <hi>Spain,</hi> who hearing of what had chanc'd, prepar'd to follow 'em, taking ſeveral Soldiers on Board 'em; the Admiral, who ſail'd beſt, got the firſt Sight of the <hi>Frenchman;</hi> but being fearful to attack him before the other Ships came up, lay by. The <hi>Frenchman</hi> ſeeing that, boldly ſet upon the firſt Ship, and took her without fighting; the ſecond, ſeeing that, tack'd about, and ran a-Shore, which was taken by the Ship's Boat; the third alſo run the ſame Fate. Fluſh'd with this Succeſs, they return'd to the <hi>Havan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> the ſecond time, and exacted a Thouſand <hi>Ducats</hi> more, or elſe they threaten'd to level the City with the Ground, which
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0388001100:208"/>
was paid 'em immediately. Then they took their laſt Leave, with this rich Booty, and ſail'd for <hi>Rochel</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where they ſhar'd their Prizes. After this they built their Houſes with Stone, as they are now, which nevertheleſs the <hi>Engliſh</hi> took about twelve Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>There are many fair Harbours beſides the <hi>Havanna,</hi> in <hi>Cuba,</hi> as that of St. <hi>Jago</hi> City and Harbour, which is a handſome Place, ſeated on the South of the Iſland, and is alſo a Biſhop's See under the Archbiſhoprick of St. <hi>Domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</hi> Three Leagues from St. <hi>Jago</hi> lies thoſe famous Copper Mountains, call'd by the <hi>Spaniards, Sierra de Cobre.</hi> There's another Town and Harbour ſituated on the Eaſtern Part of <hi>Cuba,</hi> call'd <hi>Baracoa,</hi> where they gather the beſt Ebony of all the <hi>Indies.</hi> There's many other good ones, as St. <hi>Salvador, Trinedad, Puerto del Principe,</hi> which has a Fountain near it, that ſome times of the Year produces Liquid Pitch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cuba</hi> was formerly divided into Eight Provinces and Governments, and better
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0388001100:209"/>
Peopl'd than any other Iſland in <hi>America,</hi> before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> invaded 'em; but now there are but few <hi>Indians,</hi> which inhabit ſeveral Parts of the Iſland unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but the Natives can never forget their Barbarity, which they have by Tradition from Father to Son. Nay, I have been inform'd that they keep a ſolemn Feſtival once a Year, which was the Time that the Maſſacre of the <hi>Indians</hi> happen'd; and if they can get any <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they ſacrifice 'em to ſatisfy <hi>the Manes</hi> of their dead Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hugh Linſcoten,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Voyager, relates that a <hi>Caſſick,</hi> or one of the Lords of a Province, caught a <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> at their firſt Landing, and threw him into a River, to ſee if he wou'd drown, which he did, and that ſatisfy'd him they were not Immortal. Whereupon he encourag'd his Men, and repuls'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeveral times with great Loſs; but at laſt run the ſame Fate with the reſt of the Natives. 'Tis reported that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> firſt and laſt had maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed Sixty Thouſand <hi>Indians</hi> in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland of <hi>Cuba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0388001100:210"/>
               <hi>La Caſas,</hi> a Biſhop in <hi>New Spain,</hi> that wrote the Hiſtory of the <hi>Indies,</hi> tells us this Story of another <hi>Caſſick,</hi> that was taken by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> and condemn'd to be burnt alive with green Wood, that his Torture might be the longer and more exquiſite. While he was ty'd to the Stake, before the Fire was lighted, a Fryar that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent preach'd to him the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, and that all who dy'd in that Faith, and truſted in God that form'd the Earth, and all the Creatures therein, ſhou'd immediately after their Purgation, aſcend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Reſidence of our Creator, there to converſe with Angels, and ſuch as dy'd in that Faith; but on the contrary, if they perſiſted in Ignorance, and dy'd in a contrary Opinion, they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into Hell, and live in an Eternity of Torments. Upon this, the <hi>Caſſick</hi> ask'd him if there were any <hi>Spaniards</hi> in Heav'n? And being anſwer'd there were many; Then ſays the <hi>Caſſick,</hi> let me go to Hell, for I wou'd rather converſe with thoſe you call <hi>Devils,</hi> than you
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0388001100:211"/>
               <hi>Spaniards</hi> in Heaven; for I am ſure you are far the Worſt of Devils, and take Delight in nothing but tormenting us. Tho' the Fryar's Preaching was certainly true, yet Men of any Reaſon muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that no Religion can be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by Cruelty and the Sword, which was always the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Method with the <hi>Indians,</hi> where-ever they came; and all their Excuſe was, that if they had not us'd them in that Manner, they cou'd never have made their Conqueſts, being they were forc'd to leſſen 'em, for fear their Numbers might overpower 'em; ſo that in ſhort, as <hi>Dryden</hi> ſays in his Conqueſt of <hi>Mexico</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards, You threaten Peace, but you invite a War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I met here with a Prieſt, that I am ſure harbour'd nothing of Cruelty in his Breaſt, for he came to ſee us every Day, and in ſuch a friendly Manner, that charm'd us all. He was always ſending us one good Thing or other, and wou'd take us to divert us Abroad. He underſtood <hi>Latin</hi> very well, and ſome <hi>Engliſh.</hi> On the <hi>Sunday</hi> he preach'd an excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0388001100:212"/>
us, whoſe Chief Heads ran upon us; and to excite Charity in his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to let us have what was neceſſary in carrying us to <hi>Jamaica.</hi> The next Day he brought us to the Value of Fifty Pound in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dollars, which were collected at the Church Doors for us. There was a ſmall Veſſel of about Forty Tun upon the Stocks, that was bought of the Owners for us, and a Collection made in the Town for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to pay for it. We told 'em of the Proviſion we had left on Shore, which by our Computation cou'd not be above twenty Leagues off; but they told us it would be difficult to find it. One Day a <hi>Spaniard</hi> met us walking with Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio</hi> in one of the Cloyſters of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and reprimanded him for favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hereticks</hi> (as he call'd us) ſo much. He thought none of us underſtood <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> ſo was more free in his Converſation. Says Father <hi>Antonio,</hi> we ought to uſe Charity even to Brute Beaſts, and much more to our Fellow Creatures, who wear with us our Creator's Image; I wou'd not be thought to make a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0388001100:213"/>
Schiſm in our Religion, which I am ſure is the holieſt and moſt pure; but yet I cannot conſent in my Thoughts, that All who are out of the Pale of our Church muſt ſuffer Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it wou'd be horrid to think it, and would take away from the Luſtre of our Opinion, which ſhines ſo brightly. If they are in any Errors concerning their Belief, God, in whoſe Breaſt it lies, can open their Eyes when he thinks fit that they may ſee thoſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. Then added the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> with the ſame Reaſon you may ſay the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and Natives may ſtill remain in Ignorance, till Heaven ſhall think ſit to open their Eyes, as you ſay; and if ſo, the <hi>Miſſionary</hi> Fathers may ſpare their Trouble. No, reply'd the Father, We are there appointed by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to bring 'em out of the Cloud that dims their Sight. But of People that own Chriſt, and ſerve the ſame God with us, who differ but in a few outward Forms of Worſhip, it is very hard to believe that thoſe inſtructed in that Worſhip, muſt inevitably ſink into
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0388001100:214"/>
Damnation. I can't tell what the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>'s Thoughts were upon this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but I am ſure he was more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable than before, for he pull'd out of his Purſe a <hi>Moidore,</hi> and gave Father <hi>Antonio</hi> for our Uſe, which it ſeems he had refus'd to do, when he went about collecting for us. After he was gone, he told us his Diſcourſe, <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> and what he cou'd not make out in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> clear'd to us from the other's telling him in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> what he meant.</p>

We had all ſorts of Proviſion ſent on Board for half a Year, or more, ſo that we only ſtay'd for the Wind to riſe, it being quite calm.</p>
            <p>While we ſtay'd there, the four unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Indians</hi> were to be executed in the midſt of the <hi>Parade.</hi> They were firſt to be drag'd by four Horſes, naked, along the great Street to the <hi>Parade,</hi> and then to be chain'd to a Poſt, fix'd for that Purpoſe, and burnt to Death: I muſt confeſs, when I ſaw with what barbarous Cruelty they deſign'd to uſe 'em, I repented my being an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the taking of 'em. This Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was order'd to be between ſeven and eight in the Evening, being then it was cooleſt: All the <hi>Indian</hi> Slaves that ſerv'd <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Maſters in the Town, were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go and be Spectators of the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that they might ſee what they muſt expect, if they ever offer'd to Rebel in the like manner. When the Time came, the whole Street was crowded with a vaſt Number of People of all Conditions. But ſuch a Sight I never deſire to ſee again, each <hi>Indian</hi> was ty'd by the Feet to the Harnaſs of the Horſe, and ſo drag'd from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0388001100:217"/>
the Priſon to the Place of Execution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bare Stones naked, their Arms tied upon their Breaſts, and faſten'd upon their Backs, that they might not lift 'em up to ſave themſelves as they were dragg'd along the Stones; but by that time the poor Creatures came to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,</hi> their Skin of their Legs, Thighs, and Back, were almoſt ſtrip'd off, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Complaint; As ſoon as they were ty'd faſt to the Stake, they took from a Pot of Liquid Pitch, boiling hot, a Stick with ſomething faſten'd to the End on't, and rub'd over their naked Bodies. One of them then, I obſerv'd, began to faint, but was rated by another of his Fellow Sufferers in their own Language, which none underſtood but <hi>Indians,</hi> and the Fellow ſeem'd to bear it much better. Before the Fire was put to the Pile, a Fryer ſtep'd up to them, and in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſpoke to the <hi>Indian</hi> that was ready to faint before, who had been Servant in the Town, but run away from his Maſter, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> The Fryer deſir'd 'em, if they would be happy in the other World, to acknowledge themſelves Chriſtians, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0388001100:218"/>
go out of the World in that Faith. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this the <hi>Indian</hi> anſwer'd, <q rend="margQuotes">When I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among you (ſaid he) and was taught to worſhip your God, you told me he was an upright God, and a juſt God to them that ſerv'd him Faithfully, but an avenging Power to thoſe that once Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him: If ſo, how comes it to paſs that he has not puniſh'd you for all your Crimes. You have taught me, that Whoring and Adultery were Sins not to be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, and yet you commit thoſe Sins, as if you were in no fear of any Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Murder is one of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments not to be forgiven, when at the ſame Time you'll hire a Bravo to kill a Stranger that looks but wantonly on your Wives. In ſhort, I know not any one thing that I have heard preach'd to us poor <hi>Indians,</hi> that you practiſe your ſelves. Therefore if your <hi>Spaniſh</hi> God be as you deſcrib'd him to us, the Curſe muſt fall upon you if we can't believe in him, being we are deter'd by the Cruelties you inflict upon us in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him as you would have us, when we find your Actions and Words differ
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0388001100:219"/>
more than our Complexions. You preach up Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs, but you Practiſe Debauchery and Lewdneſs.</q>

            <p>He ſaid more, which was to excite the <hi>Indians</hi> to Rebel, but they put a ſtop to it, by putting Fire to the Wood, which being compos'd of ſeveral Combuſtible Matters, ſoon conſum'd the poor Wretches.</p>
            <p>When all was over, Father <hi>Antonio</hi> took us home to his Lodgings, to give us a ſmall Collation for the laſt time, being the next Day, we did All deſign to lie on Board, in Expectation of the Winds riſing. We told him by Mr. <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> That we thought it a great Weakneſs in them to preach in that manner, to <hi>Indians</hi> in their Condition, and it would be apt to make others deſpiſe their Religion; ſays Mr. <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> it is like courting a Woman to Love by Stripes; (pardon the Compariſon) Why, ſays Father <hi>Antonio,</hi> I muſt confeſs it is not what any of our Fathers like, but it is what we are order'd to do, and therefore muſt not be deny'd. Beſides at firſt, it was a piece of barbarous Policy in the firſt Conquerors of the <hi>Indies,</hi> they would order the Miſſionaries to preach to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0388001100:220"/>
all <hi>Indian</hi> Criminals, but out of hearing of any Spectators; ſo as ſoon as they were executed, they would declare to all the <hi>Indians,</hi> that they died Chriſtians, and were happy. Mr. <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> ask'd him, What made them uſe 'em ſo inhumanely, was it not enough that they ſuffer'd Death, but muſt be tortur'd in that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Manner? He replied, It was done to terrifie the other <hi>Indians</hi> from any Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.

our proſperous Voyage: So on the next Day, we paid our hearty Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to all our Benefactors, and went on Board; where we had not been a Quarter of an Hour, before an extraordinary Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage came from the Governor for <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> our Black, who went with them without any Heſitation, and return'd with a Preſent from the Governor, of ſeveral Bottles of Rack, <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wines, Fowls, Rice, and Brandy, with twenty Pieces of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gold, as the Meſſenger told us, in Recompenſe for the Loſs of one of our Companions; for the Governor had ſent for <hi>Plymouth,</hi> to know if he would ſerve him in Quality of his Trumpeter, and he would ſettle a Penſion upon him for Life. <hi>Plymouth</hi> thought fit to accept of it, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Maſter, nor knowing when he ſhould have one: But he got leave to come on Board to bid us farewel which he did in a very Affectionate manner. I bid him have a care to pleaſe the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> and then he need not fear doing well; ſo we parted with <hi>Plymouth,</hi> with our hearty Thanks recommended to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Antonio</hi> for all his Favours. <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0388001100:222"/>
had a Trumpet given him by the Governor, as ſoon as he came on ſhore, which he brought with him, and ſounded all the Way in the Boat, as he went back again to oblige us; for really he ſounded extraordinary well, and had learnt on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Inſtruments, having a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Underſtanding in Muſick. We were ſorry to part with <hi>Plymouth,</hi> as being a faithful honeſt Fellow, yet glad he had got ſo good a Maſter. The Wind riſing, we weigh'd Anchor, and left the Port with three Huzza's and a Volley of Small Arms, (we having no Cannon) and in two Days loſt Sight of the Iſland <hi>Cuba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This famous Iſland of <hi>Cuba,</hi> which was firſt call'd <hi>Joanna</hi> by <hi>Columbus</hi> the firſt Diſcoverer, afterwards <hi>Fernandina,</hi> then <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> as being the Firſt and Laſt Iſland the <hi>Spaniards</hi> touch'd at: But afterwards was call'd <hi>Cuba,</hi> and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that Name. This is reckon'd one of the Four Iſlands of the <hi>Barlovento.</hi> The others are <hi>Hiſpaniolo, Jamaica,</hi> and <hi>Porto-Rico.</hi> The North Side of <hi>Cuba</hi> is fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a vaſt Number of ſmall Iſlands, call'd the <hi>Lucaies,</hi> which ſome Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0388001100:223"/>
have taken for a Part of the main Land. The chief is <hi>Bahama,</hi> which forms the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> the Paſſage that all Ships go through, when they come out of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> into <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cuba</hi> has on the North, <hi>Jucatan,</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince on the main Land, diſtant about 50 Leagues, and on the South <hi>Jamaica,</hi> about 40 Leagues: In length 220, and in the broadeſt Part about 56. The Soil in moſt Parts, that are inhabited by <hi>Spaniards,</hi> is Fruitful, and much more Healthy than <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi> The Tobacco is reckon'd the beſt in the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies.</hi> I have ſeen very large Vines there, which bear excellent Grapes, but not fit to make Wine; many have tried, but it turns ſour in a few Days. And for Birds, Beaſts, and Fiſhes, it comes up to, if not exceeds any of the other Iſlands. The Bird <hi>Flamingo</hi> is a Fowl ſomething bigger than our ordinary Geeſe, but Legs and Neck twice as long, and all over red, and generally go in a Body at a Diſtance, they look like a Company of Soldiers march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have a Proverb here, That the Time will come that <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0388001100:224"/>
Men will walk as freely in their Streets, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do now; if it were ſo, it would be of a prodigious Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> being the <hi>Havana</hi> is a Strait that Commands all the Ships that come out of the <hi>Indies</hi> for <hi>Europe,</hi> and I really think from what I have ſeen, that it would be in the Power of Ten thouſand Men, with a Fleet proportionable, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the whole Iſland in a little Time. Beſides it is obſerv'd, that there are more Prizes brought into the <hi>Havana,</hi> than any four Havens in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While we were at the <hi>Havana,</hi> a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> carried two ſtrange Beaſts about the Streets for a Show, that he brought from <hi>Brazil,</hi> the one was call'd <hi>Ai,</hi> with a Head ſomething reſembling that of a Man's, and cover'd with rough ſhort gray Hair: Each Foot has three Claws cloſe together, about a Finger long, very ſharp Teeth, with a ſmooth high black Noſe, very ſmall ſleepy Eyes, and no Ears, with a Tail ſmall above, and broad at the Bottom, with Hair all over the Body of an Aſh colour. This Beaſt is about the Size of a large Fox, but ſo lazy a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that when it gets up a Tree, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0388001100:225"/>
comes down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>till it has devour'd every Leaf, and when it has done, it will ſit there twenty Days together without eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and almoſt ſtarv'd before it will take the pains to go down to feed. It can't travel or creep in a whole Day not above a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Mile. This that was ſhown to us, never would ſtir till rouz'd with a ſtick, and it would be aſleep again in an Inſtant.</p>
            <p>The other Creature was ſomething like a <hi>Baboon,</hi> but conſiderably larger, with a Face and long Beard, like an old Man's, and hairy like a Goat, all over the Body; his Ears bald, his Eyes black, large and Sparkling. He that ſhow'd it to us, call'd it a <hi>Cayon,</hi> its Tail is about four or five Foot long, which they twiſt round a Tree, and ſo fling themſelves to the next. They are very Fierce and Subtile, and when Wounded, will ſet upon their Adverſary without any Fear; and if forc'd to climb the Trees, they carry their Mouths and Hands full of Stones to throw at Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers as they paſs by; and when wounded, they ſet up a ſhriek, that immediately brings all of their Kind, within Hearing, to their Succour, who ſtop the Wound
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0388001100:226"/>
with Leaves and Moſs, which will ſoon be heal'd. This that we ſaw was brought up very young by the Perſon that had him, and would play many comical Tricks; As he was ſhown to us, he urin'd in his Paw and threw it in our Faces, before we were aware, and while I was a wiping mine, he gave me ſuch a Salute with his Tail, that made me ſtand farther off, which ſeem'd to pleaſe him mightily, for he look'd at me and chatter'd, as much as to ſay, I have given it you. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> told us, they us'd to play at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Game with the Natives for Money, and would often win, and then go ſpend what they had got, upon a Liquor that made them Drunk, and as ſoon as they found themſelves ſo, they would retire very decently, and take a Nap, by which they were very often caught.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſeph de Acosta,</hi> that wrote the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>West-Indies</hi> in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> tells a Story of one of theſe Sort of Creatures, going to a Tavern, with a Pot, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to pay for his Wine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet would not part with his Money, till they had fill'd his Pot with the Wine; but in the mean time beat
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0388001100:227"/>
four or five Boys, that did their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to take it from him, and carried it ſafe to them that ſent him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> relates another Story of one of them, that ſeeing a <hi>Spaniard</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fire a Gun at him, ſnatch'd up a little Child that was there, and held it before him as a Buckler, and would not let it go before the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was retir'd; then he laid the Child gently down, and ran away, after having firſt Urin'd upon it.</p>
            <p>The Fellow that ſhow'd them, ſold 'em to the Governor of <hi>Havana</hi> for Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Dollars, and would have gone with us to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> or any where; but we durſt not take him without an Order from the Governor, who does not ſuffer any one to go out of the Iſland without a Paſs from him, which coſts a Dollar, and brings into his Purſe a great deal of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the Year, having no other Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> only ſo much a Year for a Table, and a Pallace ready furniſh'd with every thing that is neceſſary, beſides Servants. Every Ship that comes in pays two Dollars, and at
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0388001100:228"/>
going out four more, ſo that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Iſland exceeds in its Profit any other Government (except the Vice Roy of <hi>Mexico)</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh West-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Weather continued favourable, ſo that we arriv'd at <hi>Jamaica</hi> without meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing remarkable in our Paſſage: As ſoon as we had caſt Anchor, I order'd the Boat to be made ready to carry me on Board my own Ship, which I ſaw Ride there. But when I got up the Ship-ſide, I found my Cloaths ſelling at the Maſt, at, <hi>Who bids more?</hi> which is the Method, as ſoon as a Perſon is dead, or kill'd; the firſt Harbour they Anchor in, the Cloaths of the Deceas'd are brought upon Deck, and Sold by Auction, the Money to be paid when they come to <hi>England,</hi> for it generally happens that Sailors have not any till they come Home again.</p>
            <p>They were at the laſt Article when I came up the Ship-ſide; which was a pair of black worſted Stockings that coſt I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve about four Shillings, which went at twelve and Six-pence, tho' they had been worn. As ſoon as I was ſeen by 'em,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0388001100:229"/>
ſome cry'd out a Ghoſt! a Ghoſt! and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ran away to ſecure the Cloaths they had bought, ſuſpecting that now I wou'd have 'em again. When they were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd of my being alive, and were told my Story, they were all rejoic'd at my good Fortune, but none would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon to let me have my Cloaths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. So I took up the Slop-Book and caſt up what they were ſold for, and found, that what coſt me about twenty Pound, were ſold for four times the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: When I was ſatisfied in that, I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led every Perſon, one by one, that had bought any of my Cloaths, and ſtruck a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with them for ready Money, and bought them for about ten Pound; but the ready Money pleas'd them mightily.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Waſe</hi> being ſick aſhore, I went to pay him a Viſit, where he was mighty glad to ſee me, as believing I had periſh'd; he told me that the Veſſel hung Lights out for ſeveral Hours, that I might know where to ſwim, and laid by as long as the Wind would permit, as the Crew acquainted him when they came into Harbour. The Captain told me, That he did not think
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0388001100:230"/>
he ſhould live long, therefore was mighty glad I was come to take Charge of the Ship, which had ſail'd before, if he had been in a Condition to bear the Sea. From thence I went on Board my new Bark, and ſettled my Affairs there with my Companions, who were mighty ſorry to think of parting with me, <hi>Hood</hi> and <hi>Rouſe</hi> deſir'd they might be receiv'd on Board as Sailors, and go for <hi>England</hi> with us; for <hi>Hood</hi> was an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> I mean born in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Rouſe</hi> had Friends there. Beſides it was as eaſie to go from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Bermudas,</hi> as from <hi>Jamaica.</hi> So I ſpoke to the Captain, who was very well pleas'd to receive them, being he had loſt five Men by the Diſtemper of the Country. The poor Captain died in a Week after my coming, and left me Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor for his Wife, who liv'd at <hi>Briſtol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as we had Buried him, I went on Board with my two Men, and did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to Sail in three Days at fartheſt, which I would have done before, but that I was hinder'd by wanting a Chapman for our Bark, being we had Shares to diſpoſe of; when I came on Board, the Maſter told
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0388001100:231"/>
me, he had no Occaſion for the two Men to add to their Charge; ſays I, that's as I ſhall think fit, for the Power is in my Hands now; And who put that Power into your Hands? (ſays the Maſter) He that had the Power ſo to do (ſays I) the Captain, whereupon I ſhew'd him in Writing. He told me it did not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy any thing, and that he would find no one of the Sailors would obey a Boy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to ſteer a Veſſel. Says I, I don't deſire to have any Command over you, but only to repreſent the Captain that's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd: We have no want of any Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives (replies the Maſter) and you ſhall go in your own Station, or not at all. It would be a pretty thing, added he, for my Mate to become my Captain, and as I was deſign'd by the Captain to have the Command of the Veſſel before you came, ſo I intend to keep it. But ſays I, this Paper ſign'd by his own Hand, is but of two Days Date, and you can't ſhow any thing for the Command, as you pretend to: Therefore (ſays I) I'll make my Complaint to the Governor, and he ſhall Right me. Ay, ay, do ſo!
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0388001100:232"/>
(ſays he) I'll ſtand to any thing he ſhall Command. Whereupon <hi>Rouſe, Hood,</hi> and my ſelf went into the Boat again, and row'd immediately on Shore; but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor was ſix Miles up in the Country, and it being pretty late, we deſign'd to wait for his coming home, which we were told would be in the Morning early. So I went on board the Bark, and laid all Night, the Ship lying beyond the Keys two Leagues from the Harbour, in order to ſail. The next Morning getting up, with an Intent to wait upon the Governor, and looking towards the Place where the Ship lay over Night, found ſhe was gone, and caſting my Eyes towards Sea, ſaw a Ship 4 or 5 Leagues diſtant from us, which we ſuppos'd to be ours. I immediately went on Shore, and found the Governor juſt come to Town, and made my Complaint. He told me there was no Remedy, but to ſend immediately to <hi>Blewfields Bay,</hi> where he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed they would ſtop to get Wood, which was uſual with our Ships that were bound for <hi>England:</hi> Whereupon there was a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger order'd for <hi>Blewfields,</hi> which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, to give Inſtructions to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0388001100:233"/>
Officer that commanded at the Fort, to ſeize the Maſter of the Ship, and order him before the Governor at <hi>Port-Royal:</hi> So we got on Horſeback, and reach'd it in three Days, it being almoſt a hundred Miles. When we came there, we found ſeveral Ships in the Harbour, but none that we wanted: So we waited a Week, but all to no Purpoſe, for ſhe paſt the Bay, as miſtruſting our Deſign; upon this we were oblig'd to return with a heavy Heart, and tell the Governor of our ill Succeſs. Who pitied me, and told me he would ſee me ſhip'd in the firſt Veſſel bound for <hi>England:</hi> So I went on board my own Bark, where they were all glad to ſee me, tho' ſorry I was ſo diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now I was very glad that I had not diſpos'd of my Bark, for I thought now it might be of uſe to me. We conſulted together, to know what was beſt to do; at laſt I made a Bargain with them, if they would venture with me in our Bark to <hi>England,</hi> I wou'd give them not only my Share of her, but as much Money as came to the other two Shares, if they would be willing to part with them: Upon this
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0388001100:234"/>
we agreed, and with what Money I had, I began to lade my Veſſel with Things to Traffick with. I bought a good Quantity of Indigo, ſome Cotton, Sugar, and Rum. In ſhort, I laid out the beſt Part of my Money; and on <hi>June</hi> the 1ſt, 1700, ſet Sail, and ſteered our Courſe for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I leave <hi>Jamaica,</hi> I think it will not be amiſs to give ſome Account of the dreadful Earthquake that happen'd there in 1692. I am ſure it is a true Account of it, being it was wrote by the Rector of <hi>Port-Royal</hi>'s own Hand, who was upon the Place when the Accident happen'd. You ſhall have it in his own Words.</p>

                  <p>FROM on board the <hi>Granado</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in <hi>Port-Royal</hi> Harbour, I doubt not but you will hear both from <hi>Garret</hi>'s and <hi>Bris</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe, of the great Calamity that hath befallen this Iſland by a terrible Earthquake on the 7<hi>th,</hi> Inſtant. Which have thrown down almoſt all the Houſes, Churches, Sugar Works, Mills and Bridges, thro' the whole Country; it tore the Rocks and Mountains, and deſtroy'd ſome whole Plantations, and threw them into the Sea; but <hi>Port-Royal</hi> had much the greater Share in this terrible Judgment of God. I will therefore be more particular in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0388001100:236"/>
you an account of its Proceeding, that you may know what my Danger was, and how unexpected my Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 7<hi>th,</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> I had been at Church reading Prayers, (which I did every Day) ſince I was <hi>Rector of</hi> PORT-ROYAL, to keep up ſome <hi>ſhow</hi> of Religion amongſt a moſt Ungodly, and debauch'd People. When Prayers being ended, I went to a Place hard by the Church, (where Merchants uſe to meet) where the Preſident of the Council was, who acts in Chief till we have a new Governor; came into my Company, and engag'd me to take a Glaſs of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood-Wine with him, as a whet before Dinner. He being my very good Friend, I ſtay'd with him; upon which, he lighted a Pipe of Tobacco, which he was pretty long taking, and not being will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to leave him before it was out; I was detain'd from going to one Captain <hi>Rudder</hi>'s where I was to Dine; whoſe Houſe upon the firſt Concuſſion ſunk into the Earth, then into the Sea, with his Wife and Family, and ſome others that came to Dinner with him. But to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0388001100:237"/>
return to the <hi>Preſident</hi> and his Pipe of Tobacco, before it was out, I found the Ground rolling and moving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> underneath my Feet; upon which I ſaid to him, Lord, Sir! What's this? He reply'd very compoſedly, being a very grave Man; it is an Earthquake, be not afraid it will be ſoon over; but it did encreaſe every Minute, and we heard the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Tower</hi> fall; upon which we ran to ſave our ſelves. I quickly loſt him and made towards <hi>Morgan</hi>'s-<hi>Fort,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wide open Place, I thought to be there more ſecure from the falling Houſes; but as I made towards it, I ſaw the Earth open and ſwallow up a Multitude of People, and the Sea mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon us over the Fortifications. I then laid aſide all hopes of eſcaping, and reſolv'd to make towards my own Lodging, and there to meet Death in as good a Poſture as I could, but I was forc'd to croſs and run thro' two or three narrow Streets, the <hi>Houſes</hi> and <hi>Walls</hi> fell on each ſide me, ſome <hi>Bricks</hi> came rolling over my <hi>Shoes</hi> but none hurt me: When I came to my Lodging
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0388001100:238"/>
I found all things in the ſame Order I left them in, not a Picture (of which there were ſeveral fair ones in my Chamber) being out of it's Place. I went to the <hi>Balcony</hi> to view the Street in which our Houſe ſtood, I ſaw never a Houſe down, nor the Ground ſo much as crack'd. The People ſeeing me there cry'd out to me to come and Pray with 'em. When I was come into the Street every one lead hold on my Cloaths and Embrac'd me, that with their fear and kindneſs I was almoſt ſtiffled. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded 'em at laſt to kneel down, and make a large Ring, which they did: I Pray'd with them near an Hour, when I was almoſt ſpent with the Exerciſe, they brought me a Chair; the Earth working all the while with new Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and trembling like the rolling of the Sea; inſomuch, that ſometimes whilſt I was at Prayer, I cou'd hardly keep my ſelf upon my Knees by that time I had been half an Hour longer, ſetting before 'em their many and hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Sins. Some Merchants came to me, who deſir'd me to go Aboard ſome
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0388001100:239"/>
Ship in the Harbour and refreſh my ſelf; they told me they had gotten me a Boat to carry me off. Coming to the Sea which had entirely ſwallow'd up the <hi>Wharfe,</hi> with all thoſe goodly Houſes on it; moſt of 'em as fine as thoſe in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> and two entire Houſes beyond it. I upon the tops of ſome Houſes that lay level with the Water, got firſt into a <hi>Canoe,</hi> and then in a long Boat which put me Aboard a Ship, call'd, the <hi>Siam</hi> Merchant, where I found the Preſident ſafe, who was overjoy'd to ſee me: I continu'd there that Night, but could not Sleep for the returns of the Earthquake al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Hour, which made all the Guns in the Ship to jar and rattle. The next Day I went from Ship to Ship to viſit thoſe that were taken up in Boats bruiſed, and Dying, and to Pray with 'em, alſo to do the laſt Office to them, in ſaying the Form of Prayer that is us'd at the Burial of the Dead, which hath been my ſorrowful Employment ever ſince I came Aboard this Ship, with deſign to come for <hi>England;</hi> we
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0388001100:240"/>
having nothing but ſhaking of the Earth, Thunder, Lightning, and foul Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever ſince. And the People being ſo deſperately Wicked, it makes me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to ſtay in the Place; for that very time this terrible Earthquake was, as ſoon as it was Night, a Crew of leud Rogues which they call Privateers, fell to breaking open Warehouſes, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to rob and rifle their Neighbours, whilſt the Earth trembled under them, and ſome of the Houſes fell on 'em in the Act, and thoſe that remain ſtill in the Place, are as Impudent and Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en as ever. I have been twice aſhore to Pray with the Bruis'd and Dying Perſons, and to Chriſten their Children, where I met too many Drunk and Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I did not ſpare 'em, nor the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates who have ſuffer'd Wickedneſs to grow to ſo great a Height. I have I bleſs God to the beſt of my Skill and Power, diſcharg'd my Duty in that Place, which you will hear from moſt Perſons that come from hence: I have Preach'd ſo ſeaſonable to them, and ſo plain, in the laſt Sermon I Preach'd in

the Church, by ſetting before them what would be the Iſſue of their Impenitence, that they have ſince confeſs'd it look'd more like a Propheſy than a Sermon. I had, I confeſs an Impulſe to do it, and many times I have preach'd in the Pulpit, Things that I never meditated at home, and could not methought do otherwiſe. The Day (when all this befell us) was clear, affording not any Suſpicion of the leaſt Evil, but in the Space of three Minutes, about half an Hour after Eleven in the Morning, <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> the faireſt Town of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, the beſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and Mart of this Part of the World, exceeding in its Riches, plentiful of all good Things, was taken and ſhatter'd to Pieces, ſunk in, and cover'd for the greateſt part by the Sea, and will in a ſhort Time be wholly eaten up by it; for ſome of thoſe Buildings that yet ſtand and are left, we every Day hear fall, and the Sea daily incroaches upon the Town. We gueſs, by falling of the Houſes, and opening of the Earth, and Inundation of the Waters, that there are killed Fifteen Hundred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0388001100:242"/>
and many of good Note, of whom are my good Friend Attorney-General <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> Martial <hi>Reeves, William Turner, Thomas Turner</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is loſt: I have loſt the beſt Living, that ever I had or ſhall have. I came, as I told you, aboard this Ship, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to come home; but the People are ſo Importunate with me to ſtay, I know not what to ſay to them, I muſt undergo great Hardſhips if I ſtay here, the Country being broken all to pieces, I muſt now live in a Hut, and eat Yams and Potatoes for Bread, which I could never endure; drink Rum Punch and Water, which were never pleaſing to me. I have wrote as effectually as I could to my Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> to ſend a younger Perſon, who may better endure the Fatigue of it, than I can: Now it would look very unnatural in me to leave the People in their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and therefore whatever I ſuffer, I would not have ſuch a Blame lie at my Door. I have acquainted my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> That by Reaſon of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſtreſs. I am willing to continue
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0388001100:243"/>
a Year longer. They are going to build a new Town near the Rock in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinea,</hi> the Garden of the Iſland. The <hi>French</hi> from <hi>Petigauies</hi> did attack the Iſland on the North Side, but were all defeated and deſtroyed, it being near the time of the Earthquake.</p>

                     <p>EVER ſince that fatal Day (the moſt terrible that ever I ſaw) I have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on board a Ship for the ſhaking of the Earth, returns every now and then: Yeſterday we had a very great one, but it ſeems leſs terrible aboard than on ſhore. Yet I have ventur'd to <hi>Port-Royal</hi> three times (ſince its Deſolation) among the ſhatter'd Houſes to bury the Dead, and Chriſten their Children. <hi>Sunday</hi> laſt I preach'd amongſt them in a Tent; The Houſes that remain being ſo ſhatter'd, that I durſt not preach in them. The People are over-joy'd when they ſee me amongſt them; and wept
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0388001100:244"/>
very bitterly when I preach'd to them: I hope by this terrible Judgement, God will make them Reform themſelves, for there was not a more ungodly People upon the Face of the Earth. It is a ſad Sight to ſee ſuch a fair Harbour cover'd with the dead Bodies of the People of all Conditions; for our great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Burial Place, the Palliſadoes, was deſtroyed by the Earthquake, and the Sea waſh'd the Carcaſſes of thoſe that were there Buried, out of their Graves. Their Tombs being daſh'd to pieces by the Earthquake, of which there were Hundreds in that Place. Many rich Men are utterly ruined, whilſt many by watching Opportunities, ſearching the ſunk Houſes, even almoſt whilſt the Earthquake laſted (while Terror and Amazement, had ſeized on all the conſiderable Perſons) have gotten great Riches. We have had an Account from ſeveral Places of the Iſland, of Miſchiefs done there by the Earthquake: From St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s we hear, that above a Thouſand Acres of Wood-Land, are waſh'd into the Sea,

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were ſwallowed up to the Neck, the Earth ſhut upon them and ſqueez'd them to Death. And in that manner ſeveral are left buried with their Heads above Ground, only ſome Heads the Dogs have eaten. They are covered with Duſt and Earth by the People, which yet remain on the Place to avoid the Stench. Thus I have told you a long and ſad Story, and God knows what worſe may happen yet. The People tell me they hear great Bellowing and Noiſes in the Mountains, which makes ſome very Apprehenſive of an Irruption of Fire; if ſo, I fear it will be more deſtructive than the Earthquake.

I believe this was the moſt terrible Earthquake that has ever happen'd ſince the Creation of the World, and did more Damage. They tell a Story of a wicked Fellow, that in the Time of the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake raviſhed a Merchant's Daughter, and after murder'd her, that he might not be diſcover'd; but a Black that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be in another Room, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what had happen'd, ran away to the Ship where her Father was to give him Notice, that he might come and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him. But when he came and found his Daughter murder'd and the Villain gone, he was almoſt Diſtracted, and the Houſe tumbling with the Earthquake, he periſh'd in the Ruins bemoaning his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The execrable Wretch was ſoon overtaken with Divine Vengeance; for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make his Eſcape, a large Stone from one of the falling Houſes, dropt on his Back and broke it, where he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in ſuch Miſery, that he prayed for ſome one to knock him on the Head to put him out of his Torture. The Pain was ſo violent, that it took away his Senſes, and in the height of his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0388001100:247"/>
diſcover'd himſelf to be the Author of the horrid Fact mention'd; but he died without Repentance, curſing every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>Another Story that was told me, was, That a Gentlewoman had come out of the Country to lye-in there, being ſhe would be better accommodated, and was brought to Bed but two Days before. The Husband was gone out; and at the firſt ſhock of the Houſe all her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants left her, with the Infant with her, which with the Violence of the ſhock, was overturn'd in the Cradle: With this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, the Gentlewoman in a Fright roſe out of her Bed, tho' in a weak Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and took up her Child, and feeling the Houſe totter, ran down Stairs in her Shift, with her Infant in her Arms, where ſhe was met by her Husband, who took her in his Arms to carry her away, juſt as the Houſe fell upon them all, where they were drawn out, but the Child was dead, and the Mother died in half an Hour, the Husband mightily bruiſed, with much Pain linger'd out to the next
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0388001100:248"/>
Day, and then expir'd, and were all three buried together in one Grave.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Abraham Matthews,</hi> an Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> that was alive when I was there, told me of a remarkable Providence that happen'd to him, as he was packing up ſeveral Things to carry on Board ſome Veſſel that was in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, for the more Security. He had no ſooner come out of the Houſe where he lodg'd, but it fell down and ſmother'd ſeveral People within. Juſt as he got to the Water-ſide, the Boat was going off, and as he put one Foot into the Boat, the Boat-Man puſh'd him out again, and told him he muſt ſtay till he came back, being the Boat was full. The Boat in turning the Point by the Fort was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd by a Point of the Shore, which fell upon it, and all that were in't pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd. This was the ſecond Deliverance. When he ſaw what had happen'd, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd to the Church, which was open, to return God Thanks; and beg his farther Protection, or if Death happen'd, he could not chooſe a better Place to die in. While he was at Prayers, he ſaw one of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0388001100:249"/>
               <hi>Buccaniers,</hi> or Thieves, ſtealing away his Bundle, which he immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, ſeiz'd, and took it from him: As ſoon as he was out of the Church, that fell to the Ground. When he had got the Bundle, he kneel'd upon the Earth to tie it faſter, the adjacent Houſe ſunk down alſo and ſmother'd the Fellow, with ſeveral others that were in't. Going a little farther he met ſome of his Acquaintance, who were getting a <hi>Canoe</hi> ready to convey themſelves on Board a Ship in the Harbour, where he ſafely arriv'd, and gave God Thanks for his many and happy Deliverances.</p>
            <p>We put in at <hi>Blewfields-Bay,</hi> for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of Wood and Water, and when we were provided, ſteer'd our Courſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for <hi>England.</hi> But as we came within ten Leagues of the <hi>Havana,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Man of War of Forty Guns came up with us, who commanded us to ſtrike our Sails, which we did immediately, and coming on Board us, were ſurpriz'd to find us all <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Men, not expecting other than <hi>Spaniards</hi> from the building of our Veſſel. Whereupon they made us all Priſoners, and ſent fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0388001100:250"/>
Men on Board us to carry the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel into the <hi>Havana.</hi> Telling 'em how we came by the Veſſel did not ſignify any thing, for they ſaid we were Pyrates, and had ſeiz'd it. And our Paſs which we had from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the <hi>Havana,</hi> not being to be found, made Things appear but with an indifferent Face; we were afraid we ſhould find many Difficulties in getting our Liberty, eſpecially if they went to their Station, which was St. <hi>Jago.</hi> But it happen'd better than we expected, for ſhe made direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Port of the <hi>Havana,</hi> where we knew every thing would be plac'd in a true Light again. When we were anchor'd, and the People could come on Board us, we were ſoon known, and the Captain going to the Governor, was ſoon inform'd of the Matter; ſo we were releas'd immediately, and had a Viſit made us from Father <hi>Antonio,</hi> and honeſt <hi>Plymouth,</hi> who were mightily rejoic'd to ſee us.</p>
            <p>We were detain'd two Days, before we could get away: And then we ſet Sail with a brisk Gale, firſt ſaluting the Town with our 4 Guns, and 4 Patter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aroes, which I had forgot to mention our buying at <hi>Port-Royal.</hi>

In two Days after our firſt Sailing we made Cape <hi>Florida,</hi> and entred the Gulph that bears the ſame Name, and paſs'd it without Danger. But here a ſudden Calm overtook us, as frequently happens when your paſt the Gulph; and the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſet ſtrong to Weſtward, occaſion'd, as we ſuppos'd, by the opening of the Land, upon that Coaſt. The Calm laſting for four Days and we were inſenſibly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried within half a League of the Shore, but a little Breeze riſing from Land, helped us farther out again: But ſtill our Danger more encreas'd, for we ſoon perceiv'd three large <hi>Canoes</hi> making towards us, full of <hi>Indians,</hi> arm'd. We had not much time to conſult what to do, for they gain'd upon us every Moment. Now Death, or ſomething worſe than Death, glar'd us in the Face, and moſt of us thought this the laſt Day we had to live. Come Friends (ſaid I) if we muſt die, let's die bravely like <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi> To die is juſt as common as to live, only Life is choice, but Death we ſtill purſue, and every ſtep we take ſhortens our Journey. If then we follow Death, why ſhould we
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0388001100:252"/>
fear it? Or if we ſhou'd fear, what wou'd that avail, ſince fearing cannot put back the Fated Hour. Then let us like thoſe that wou'd diſpoſe of ſomewhat, do it to the beſt Advantage. We charg'd our 4 Guns with double and round, and our Patter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aroes with Musket-Balls: The reſt of our Arms we got in readineſs, and reſolv'd to Die fighting, and not ſuffer our ſelves to be taken, to be miſerably Butcher'd, as all the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Florida</hi> do, when they get any Whites in their Power. We reſolv'd to fire our ſix Muskets upon 'em, as ſoon as they came within reach; ſo we took our aim, two to each <hi>Canoe,</hi> and fir'd upon 'em, which did 'em ſome Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, for they ſtop'd upon it: Which made us make the beſt of our way, but they ſoon purſu'd us with loud and rude Shouts. By this time, we had charg'd our Muskets again, and fir'd as before at the ſame diſtance; but whatever damage we did 'em, they came on as faſt as they cou'd, but not before we had charg'd our Pieces the third Time, which we fir'd as before, but did more Execution, as being nearer to us; and now we charg'd 'em
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0388001100:253"/>
the 4<hi>th,</hi> Time, and laid them along up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Deck for a farther Occaſion; for they being ſo nigh that our great Guns wou'd reach 'em with our double and round, which we fir'd one at a time; the firſt we fir'd at was the largeſt <hi>Canoe,</hi> which put them in ſuch confuſion, that they fell foul of one another, and being in a hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle together, we fir'd the other three, that made a mighty Havock among 'em. We now thought of a Victory, inſtead of being made Slaves, and bore up to them that we might make our <hi>Patteraroes</hi> of uſe to us, which we fir'd upon 'em with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge (or Musket) Shot, that anſwer'd our end; for now they began to turn tail, which we ſeeing, fir'd our Muskets the 4<hi>th,</hi> time, which kill'd them two <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians:</hi> And charging our great Guns with ſingle Balls, of 3 pound Weight, (or 3 Pounders as they call them at Sea) and firing at their Boats (or <hi>Canoes)</hi> we ſunk one of them, but the Men ſwam to the other <hi>Canoes,</hi> and taking hold of the ſides, with their weight turn'd it over. Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> and the reſt of our Men, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd to make up to them, and in this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0388001100:254"/>
Confuſion kill them all. But I was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with the diſappointment they had met with, and as it was not in their Power to hurt us farther, reſolv'd to make the beſt of our way. But looking towards the ſhore, ſaw Eight more of their <hi>Canoes</hi> making up to us; this put us upon making all the Sail we cou'd, and the Sea breeze being now pretty ſtrong, we made good way. We thought the <hi>Canoes</hi> wou'd ſtay when they came up with the other three, but they made after us a long with the thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> that they had taken up. We had charg'd our great Guns with great Shot, and fir'd at them, but miſt them; we charg'd them the 2<hi>d,</hi> time, and one Shot by good Fortune took the firſt <hi>Canoe</hi> and over-ſet her, which put them into more Confuſion than before; but ſtill five of them purſu'd us, which were met with by ſome of our Musket-Balls, that gave two of them their <hi>Quietus eſt:</hi> And firing our great Guns once more, ſunk one of their <hi>Canoes,</hi> but the Men ſoon got into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and follow'd us ſtill. Seeing this, we reſolv'd to make one ſtrong Effort, and make the beſt of our way. So we
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0388001100:255"/>
back'd our main Sail and lay'd by for 'em, and brought our four Guns to one ſide, and our 4 Patteraroes to bear accordingly; we charg'd our Muskets once more, and laid them in readineſs, with two half Pikes, and our Cutlaſſes; and now we reſolv'd not to fire till every Gun might do Execution; we ſtaid till they came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two Ships length of us, and then we fir'd upon them as faſt as ever we cou'd, which prov'd effectual; for we kill'd 'em at leaſt Twenty. Upon which, they ſet up dreadful uncommon Noiſes, and row'd back as faſt as ever they cou'd; we gave them our farewel Musket-Shots, and made the beſt of our way. By a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Computation we kill'd them at leaſt 50 <hi>Indians,</hi> without their once firing at us; neither could we conceive how they intended to Aſſault us, or whether they had any fire Arms, for we ſaw none. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had brought our Veſſel to rights again, we Aſſembled our ſelves to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and return'd our ſincere Thanks to the Defender of the Weak, and giver of all good Things, for our happy Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. We ſaw the <hi>Canoes</hi> padling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0388001100:256"/>
Shore, and were met by ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with a deſign as we ſuppoſs'd to aſſiſt them; but we were now too far for them, and there was nothing more to be fear'd, and ſo we Sail'd on with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous Gale, and met with nothing worth note. Till <hi>Thurſday July</hi> the 15<hi>th,</hi> we diſcover'd Land, which amaz'd us all, for we did not think of falling in with any Shore till we ſaw <hi>England:</hi> We went to conſult our Charts, and ſaw we were near <hi>Newfound-land,</hi> and finding that, we ſteer'd directly into St. <hi>John</hi>'s Harbour, which is the Capital of the Iſland, I mean of that Part which belongs to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi> The Harbour is large, fair, ſtrong, and Commodious, commanded by ſeveral good Forts, and a ſtrong Boom that ſhuts it up: The Town conſiſts of about 800 Houſes, built after the manner of the Houſes in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Newfound-land,</hi> or <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> was diſcover'd by <hi>Sebaſtian Cabot,</hi> for King <hi>Henry</hi> the VII. of <hi>England.</hi> This Iſland is ſeated in 52 of Northern Latitude; and divided from the Continent by an Arm of the Sea, about 20 Leagues over; it is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0388001100:257"/>
larger than <hi>Ireland;</hi> the Climate is much the ſame as in <hi>England,</hi> very wholeſome; has ſeveral commodious Harbours. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> poſſeſs one Part, and the <hi>French</hi> the other; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are more Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous. This Iſland is of great Benefit to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as well as other Nations, from the vaſt quantities of Fiſh that are caught upon the Banks of <hi>Newfound-land.</hi> This is a very large Bank of Sand, which extends a hundred and twenty Leagues to the Weſt, near the Continent, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 20 Leagues broad in the middle, and Sharpens to each end. It is reckon'd the moſt extraordinary thing found in the Sea of that kind, for Ships may Anchor tho' twenty or thirty Leagues from Land. The Fruits are the ſame with us in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Soil ſo very rich, that it will bare Peaſe, Beans, &amp;c. without Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which are as good as any in <hi>England.</hi> The Beaſts the ſame, only the Bear which is found there. In ſhort, <hi>Newfound-land</hi> reſembles <hi>England</hi> in every thing ſo much, that if a Man cou'd be carry'd from thence in his Sleep, he wou'd only think he was ſtray'd ſomewhere out of his Knowledge.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0388001100:258"/>
There is only this to be ſaid, that there is not ſo many Inhabitants, ſo there is more Plenty of every thing for human Life: Their chief Trade is Fiſh, but they ſend great Quantities of Musk, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and other Furrs. There is not one <hi>Indian</hi> to be found upon the whole Iſland, but what are brought from other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and us'd as Servants; tho' it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported about 20 Years ago towards the <hi>North-Weſt</hi> Parts, the <hi>French</hi> met with ſome <hi>Indians,</hi> that us'd to help them to Cure their Fiſh, and make their Oyl. They deſcribe them a civil ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but no Knowledge of a ſuperior Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and when attempted to be taught, they wou'd Anſwer. We are well contented with our own God, neither do we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any other; Why ſhou'd we offer to change? We think our Fore-fathers wiſer than we are, and they Worſhip'd the ſame with us: Therefore, as we think of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame Place where they are, we muſt Worſhip the ſame Power. You have your God, and we have Ours; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Nation muſt have a God according to their own Language. Shou'd we Pray
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0388001100:259"/>
to your God in our <hi>Indian</hi> Language, how ſhould we be underſtood; or ſhould you Pray to Ours, what wou'd it avail you, being he wou'd not know what you ſaid to him. Now we have not one God only, but many; as one for Fiſhing, one for Fowling, and another for Husbandry: And when we are about any of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Buiſineſſes, we Pray to that God, for it wou'd be too much for one to mind them all. Wou'd it not ſeem ridiculous for one of us if we wanted Succeſs in Hunting, to Pray to him that takes care of Fiſhing; or you that wear Cloaths, Wou'd you go to a Fiſherman to bid him Cloath you. You tell us there is a vaſt Number of Worſhipers of your God, in all Countries, than what need you any more: We will ſerve you as well, and as faithfully as if we had but one God, and Pray to our God's to give you Succeſs in whatever you undertake. If you Fiſh, we'll Pray to that God; if you go to fell Timber, we'll Pray to that, and ſo on, to whatever you employ your ſelves in. When you are out of their Dominions, you muſt Pray for your ſelves to your
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0388001100:260"/>
own God. In ſhort, there is neither fair means or foul, will ever bring theſe poor Creatures to the Knowledge of the true God: If you are angry with them, they will comply with you, and ſay, Well, Well, we will do as you wou'd have us, but never think of it afterwards: If you Reaſon calmly with them, than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you as above.</p>
            <p>After being here two Days we ſet Sail, and made our Courſe for <hi>England, July</hi> 25<hi>th,</hi> 1700. We met with no extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Accident in our Paſſage, till we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the Land's End, <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 21<hi>ſt,</hi> How rejoyc'd I was to ſee my Native Country, let them judge that have been in the ſame Condition as I have been; and I may with truth ſay, that the Tranſports felt in firſt ſeeing the white Cliffs of the Iſland that gave me Birth, exceeded the Joy I receiv'd when I was deliver'd from the moſt imminent Danger. Here we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, whether it were better for us to go to <hi>London,</hi> or to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> but every one allow'd <hi>London</hi> to be the beſt Mart for our Goods; ſo we made for the <hi>Thames</hi> and the Weather being fair, and a brisk

Gale; we Anchor'd over-againſt <hi>Shade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> Dock. Now all that we had to do was to get Chapmen for our Goods; I applied my ſelf to a Merchant upon <hi>Change,</hi> who ſoon ſtruck a Bargain, and with the Conſent of my Companions, ſold the Lading, bottom and all, for Nine hundred and twenty Pound; reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the Lading Seven hundred Pound, which was my own, and two hundred and twenty for the Veſſel, and every thing beſides. They were all contented with their Dividend, but ſtill reſolv'd to go with me to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to ſee after my Affairs there: So we ſet out on foot, intending to walk it, and be a little Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon the Road, for we expected more Diverſion by walking it leaſurely, than going in any other manner. I had turn'd all my Money into Bank Bills, which amounted to 800 <hi>l.</hi> with my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that I had for my Goods, and ſew'd them in the Waſteband of my Breeches, not that there cou'd be any Danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many in Company. We took the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi> Road, tho' ſomething out of our way, being I reſolv'd to carry my Friend to <hi>Bruton,</hi> the Place of my Birth. Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0388001100:262"/>
thro' <hi>Baſing-ſtoke,</hi> a Sailor met us begging Charity for God's ſake: I gave him Six-pence, which he return'd me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thanks for; I ask'd him how it came to paſs, that a luſty Sailor as he was did not go to Sea, (eſpecially now War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing talk'd of between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French)</hi> He anſwer'd he was going to <hi>London</hi> for that intent, but was oblig'd to be beholding to good Men's Charity to aſſiſt him in his Journey. Why, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd I, have you no Friends, your Cloaths are good, you don't ſeem to have beg'd long. No anſwer'd he, this is my firſt Day, I made an end of the little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney I had laſt Night. Have you been long from Sea, (ſays I) but a Week: I had the Misfortune to be caſt away in ſight of Harbour; from whence came you? (ask'd I) ſays he we came from <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> and were bound for <hi>Briſtol;</hi> but a violent Storm over took us within ſix Leagues from the Mouth of the River <hi>Severn,</hi> and drove our Ship upon ſome Rocks in the Mouth of the Bay, and all the Men periſh'd but my ſelf. From <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> (ſays I) Pray what Ship? The
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0388001100:263"/>
               <hi>Albion</hi> Frigate reply'd he, Who was your Captain? added I. The Captain dy'd at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> but the Maſter ſupply'd his Place, one <hi>Jacob Bingley.</hi> Did you ever hear of one <hi>Falconer?</hi> Yes, he was the Mate ſuppos'd to be loſt in a Voyage he made to the Bay of <hi>Campeachy,</hi> but coming ſafe into Harbour afterwards, the Captain before his Death gave him the Command of our Ship; but the Maſter not approving of ſuch a young Man to have the Power over him, ſet Sail without him: This I learn'd on Board afterwards, for I and another Sailor were hir'd for the Voyage that Afternoon, before the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſet Sail. We had but an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Paſſage the whole Voyage, which was made up with nothing but Storms, and Calms, that caus'd a great deal of uneaſineſs and our Proviſion receiv'd Damage by the Salt-water, which drove us to the laſt Extremity; and when we were rais'd in our Hopes of ſetting our Feet upon our native Country, we were devour'd by the tempeſtuous Waves: I my ſelf was taken up for Dead upon the Shore by a Fiſherman. Have you any Friends (ſays
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0388001100:264"/>
I) at <hi>London?</hi> None, (reply'd he) every Place to me is Home, a Sailor is never out of his way; if ſo, return with us to <hi>Briſtol</hi> where we are bound, and I'll promiſe you if I can't get you a Ship, I'll give you where withal to carry you to <hi>London</hi> without begging. We eaſily agreed upon the Matter, and honeſt Tarr went on with us. I ask'd him why he did not endeavour to get a Ship at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> he anſwer'd, he wou'd rather chuſe to go in a Man of War, than a Merchant Man, ſince War was approaching, and he heard there was a Fleet fitting out for the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and if ſo, (ſays he) there may be ſome hopes of getting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there, either of <hi>Jack Spaniard,</hi> or <hi>Jack Frenchman.</hi> We came to <hi>Bruton,</hi> and took Lodgings in the <hi>Magpye-Inn,</hi> where I viſited all my Acquaintance; and from thence we went in the ſame manner to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where the firſt thing was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after my poor Father; But I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by Captain <hi>Pultney,</hi> that he thought he was certainly Dead: Tho' he had ſeen him but once ſince I had been Abroad, and that was in the <hi>January</hi> before; when he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0388001100:265"/>
came privately to him, and told him he was ſettled in a ſmall Village near <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and went by the name of <hi>Hawkins.</hi> What convinces me he is Dead, is that about two Months ago, he ſent me a Letter which I'll ſhow you: He went up Stairs and fetch'd it, which contain'd theſe Words.</p>

            <p>Grief ſo overcame me for a time, that I was not able to ſpeak; to be rob'd of a Father, and a Father I lov'd ſo dearly, was a cutting Stroke; and I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to make uſe of all my young Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy to ſupport it. My Father had left the Writing of his Eſtate with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Pultney:</hi> He having only Mortgag'd it before for five hundred Pound, to a Friend to prevent its being ſeiz'd on by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0388001100:267"/>
the Crown, which was redeem'd by the Captain by my Father's Appointment, when he came to ſee him laſt. I paid him his five hundred Pound, and wou'd have given him Intereſt for it, but he wou'd not accept of it, but advis'd me to part with it, without I deſign'd to ſettle in <hi>England,</hi> which I thought was the beſt way, whether I ſtaid in <hi>England</hi> or not. The Captain undertook the Matter, and ſold it for four Thouſand Pound. But whilſt he was buſie about it, I got Mr. <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> who was always my boſom Friend to go to <hi>Hereford,</hi> and if it 'twere poſſible to find where my dear Father was bury'd, and to ſee how Matters ſtood there. Accordingly we hir'd a couple of Horſes, and ſet out; when we arriv'd at <hi>Hereford,</hi> we found it not a little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, but at laſt thro' the means of one Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> Organiſt of the Cathedral Church, we had ſight of the Place, which was about half a Mile from the City: Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> came by the knowledge of it by the means of an honeſt Clergyman, that my Father had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a Friendſhip with, before that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Accident befell him that depriv'd him
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0388001100:268"/>
of his Life. He brought us to his Houſe, where the Gentleman was laid up with a fit of the Gout; as ſoon as we were private, I let him know who I was, upon which, he tenderly Embrac'd me, and was mightily joy'd to ſee the Son of his late Friend. Says he, I ſhou'd have been at <hi>Briſtol</hi> e're now, but that the Gout prevented me: Your Father was a Man I had but a ſhort Acquaintance with, yet that little time diſcover'd him to be a Man of Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Honeſty and Honour. When He was upon his death Bed, he told me his real Name, and Circumſtances, and what Misfortunes had brought him to this Part; he told me alſo, that he had a Son at Sea, and beg'd of me to diſpoſe of his little Fortune he had here, and ſee it put into the Hands of Captain <hi>Pultney</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which I had done, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented as I ſaid before, by this ſudden Fit of the Gout. I have taken care of all your Father's Effects, and the little Farm I have bought my ſelf, it being for my turn. Upon that, he ſent his Maid for a little Box which he unlock'd, and told me out two hundred Guineas; this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0388001100:269"/>
is what your Father left in ready Money behind him: His Farm, &amp;c. I rate at two hundred and fifty pound more, there are the Writings, and there is the Money. By the Writings I ſaw it coſt my Father, but two hundred Pound; as for his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel and other little neceſſaries, I gave them by his Order to a Maid Servant, and a Man that he hir'd; and for his Goods, there is but few, nor have we made an Eſtimate of them; but if you'll have them Prais'd, I will give ſomething more than what they are valu'd at, being I wou'd willingly have them along with the Houſe. Says I, neither ſhall they be parted, and if you pleaſe to except of them, be they what the will you ſhall be heartily welcome: He refus'd them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately, but I prevail'd with him to take them with much ado; he alſo gave me a Ring which I priz'd mightily, becauſe it had been my Father's from his Infancy, given him by my Grandfather. When he had ſettl'd every thing, I went to ſee the Place where my Father's Bones were laid, which fill'd me with ſuch awful Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that I cou'd not refrain from Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0388001100:270"/>
in ſpight of my Reſolution to the contrary. I wou'd have Erected a Tomb, or Monument for him, but it was his laſt Requeſt that he might be Bury'd as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, as he did deſign to live there.</p>
            <p>After parting with my Father's Grave with a load of Sorrow, we took leave of my Friend the Parſon, and Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> and rode for <hi>Briſtol</hi> again; but were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken about ſix Miles from <hi>Hereford</hi> by three Gentlemen of the Pad, that had got ſome notice of the Booty they ſhou'd gain if they cou'd Rob us, for I was ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertent as to put all my Money into my Bags which I wore before me at my Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; they paſt us firſt, but looking wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon us, gave us ſome ſuſpicion of what they were. Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> advis'd me to ride back again, and ſtay ſtill we had more Company; but I told him they wou'd ſoon overtake us, and ſeeing us fearful wou'd make them more Reſolute, ſo I rather choſe to face them, for we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd they were returning to meet us. We reſolv'd to be before hand with them, and we drew out our Piſtols ready, and if they offer'd to come too near us to begin
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0388001100:271"/>
with them. As ſoon as they came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 20 Yards of us, I call'd to them, and ask'd them what they wanted; if it was our Money, they ſhou'd firſt take our Lives; they anſwer'd, they had no ſuch Intention; Than what is your Reaſon of paſſing us firſt, and then meeting us again? They anſwer'd, one of their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in lighting to eaſe himſelf below the Hill had drop'd his Watch, and they were returning to find it if they cou'd. Why then paſs by in the Name of God, (ſays I) and accordingly they did; but we were cautious of letting them come too near us; as ſoon as they were paſt us, we ſet Spurs to our Horſes, and got over the Heath before we look'd behind us; but riding leaſurely thro' the Village, we ſaw them coming after a full Gallop. Now we repented we had not ſtay'd in the Village; but we reſolv'd as before to encounter them if they Aſſaulted us: The ſoon overtook us, and coming even with us, told us their Companion had found his Watch, which he pull'd out and ſhow'd us. They ſaid they cou'd not blame us in taking them for Highway-Men;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0388001100:272"/>
but they aſſur'd us, they were Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers as we were, and were going to <hi>Worceſter.</hi> We did not make any Words with them, but rode along with them, indeed, becauſe we cou'd not help it: They rode with us for about a Mile, and then the Road going narrow, one of them pretending to go foremoſt ſeiz'd hold of my Bridle, with the Surprize, my Horſe being a very good one, roſe up an end; and he diſcharging his Piſtol, the Ball graz'd upon my Cloak-Bag, and did not do any farther Damage. Upon this I fir'd one of my Piſtols but miſs'd him, but I threw it at him with all my force, which hit him on the Head ſo full, that he ſtagger'd a little and fell from his Horſe: The other diſcharg'd a Pocket-Piſtol at me, and Wounded me ſlightly in the left Shoulder; but going to diſcharge another, I ſet Spurs to my Horſe, and had the good Fortune to ſnatch it from him, but in the buſtle between us it went off, and ſhot the other Highway-Man's Horſe in the Head; which ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd him, that he ran away with him in ſpight of all he cou'd to ſtop him. Mr.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0388001100:273"/>
               <hi>Muſgrave</hi> who engag'd with him, follow'd him, but conſidering he had left me with two, return'd again, and in very good time; for the other Fellow that I had knock'd down with my Piſtol, had got up again, and had juſt caught his Horſe that was grazing under the Hedge. His o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Companion that I had taken the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol from, had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> drawn a broad cutting Sword, and was laying at me; I by good Fortune had before me a great Coat for fear of Rain, and the ball of his Piſtol had broke the Strap, ſo that I wrap'd it round my left Arm, and receiv'd his Blow, which did me no damage, and in the mean time thruſt my Sword into his Side up to the Hilt, which nevertheleſs did not kill him. But he call'd to his Companion; come <hi>Harry</hi> let's make off, for by G—d I believe I'm kill'd: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they fled as faſt as ever they cou'd back again, the way we came, with my Sword in his Breaſt; for when he receiv'd the Wound, he turn'd ſo ſhort with his Horſe, that wrung the Hilt out of my Hand. Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> was for follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, but I found ſome pain in my
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0388001100:274"/>
Shoulder, and it began to grow ſtiff, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold, and choſe to go on; but in our riding and talking of the late Accident, we loſt our Road, and had taken that which had led to <hi>Gloſter;</hi> and riding on, we met the third High-way-man, whoſe Horſe had run away with him, who was coming back, as we ſuppos'd, to ſee how Things went: As ſoon as ever he ſaw us, he turn'd his Horſe, and rid away as hard as ever he cou'd, and we rid as faſt after him, it being, as we thought, our Road; we follow'd him through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Villages, and we call'd to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſtop him, but to no purpoſe; at laſt his Horſe ſtumbled, which gave us time to come pretty near him; when he found he cou'd not eſcape us, he turn'd about, and diſcharg'd a Piſtol at us; I had one Piſtol that I had not fir'd yet, which I drew from the Houſing, and let fly at him, and wounded him in the Neck; he fled as faſt as he cou'd, and our Horſes begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to tire, he got out of our ſight; we ask'd ſeveral People we met, whether they had ſeen any ſuch Perſon, and they told us he was gon into <hi>Gloſter</hi> Town e're
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0388001100:275"/>
then; we follow'd, and got into <hi>Gloſter</hi> immediately, and were told ſuch a Man was ſeen to ride through the Town, ſo we purſu'd him no farther, our Horſes being very much tir'd; but they ſent a Hue-and-Cry after him, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for they return'd no wiſer than they went out. We ſtay'd at <hi>Gloſter</hi> two Days to have my Wound dreſs'd, and then rode to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where all our Friends waited impatiently for us, being we had exceeded our Time three Days, after having ſettled my Money in the Hands of People, that the Captain appointed to Improve it for me. I reſolv'd to make a Trip to <hi>Ireland</hi> to ſee my Siſter that was marry'd very well to a Merchant there: But hearing of the Grand Fleet making Preparation for ſome Expedition, put us all agog, and my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Genius for Travel, made me once more reſolve to be Gadding. I open'd my Mind to Captain <hi>Pultney,</hi> who advis'd me to the contrary; but I told him I was ſo much concern'd for my Father's Death, (as indeed I was) that I ſhou'd ſooner wear it off at Sea, than on Shore, being here every Object that I ſaw put me in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0388001100:276"/>
mind of Him. He was very well ſatisfy'd with my Reaſons at laſt; but, ſays He, I wou'd not have you go in any Poſt, but as a Voluntier, that you may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to ſtay longer than you ſhou'd deſire. I thought this the beſt way, therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd for <hi>London</hi> with all my Companions, and get us a Ship. I had Letters of Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations to Secretary <hi>Burchet,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Gentlemen that had the Management of the <hi>Navy.</hi> We arriv'd at <hi>London February</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi> 1701, Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> and I enter'd on Board the <hi>Breda,</hi> Captain <hi>Fog</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, becauſe we were inform'd Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Benbow</hi> wou'd hoiſt his Flag in that Ship. Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> having formerly had ſome Acquaintance with the Admiral, waited on him, and had a Warrant for a Quarter-Maſter given him. The reſt of our Companions enter'd before the Maſt, that is, Common Sailors in the ſame Ship. <hi>Hood</hi> was ſoon made Cook's Mate, and the reſt of 'em got ſome little Office, that rais'd 'em ſomething above the Common Sailors, tho' they enter'd as ſuch, and all by the means of Mr. <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> who acquainted the Admiral with their Fortunes. When
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0388001100:277"/>
we had ſent all our Things on Board, and not knowing when they wou'd Sail, Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> and I got leave to go to <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> by Land, where we arriv'd on <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday March</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> and ſtay'd there till the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet arriv'd. A Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron was order'd out to Cruiſe, of which our Ship was one, but an unlucky Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent hinder'd my going with her, (but Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> was forc'd to go againſt his Inclinations, and leave me behind him;) which was as follows. One Evening coming from ſeeing a Play at the Bull's Head, a Gentleman coming out with a Lady, the Croud by chance joſtled me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lady, which this Gentleman Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> (Nephew to <hi>Johnny Gibſon,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Place) took as an Affront put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, being he had the Care of the Lady; but I begg'd her Pardon, and told her it was an Accident I cou'd not help; but he being in a ſtrange Paſſion, call'd me ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral genteel Names, as Rogue, Raſcal, and ſuch like, and ſtruck me over the Head with his Cane, tho' I did not much mind his Words; I did not care to take his Blows without a Return, which I did with
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0388001100:278"/>
Intereſt, and we were ſoon parted. But an Hour after, being at the aforeſaid <hi>Bull-Head</hi> at Supper, the Drawer came up and told us, There was a Gentleman below deſir'd to ſpeak one Word to Mr. <hi>Falconer;</hi> there was one Mr. <hi>Langley,</hi> Lieutenant to the <hi>Windſor</hi> Man of War, that I had made an acquaintance with at the Play, that promis'd to come and ſup with us, and I took the Meſſage to come from him, but was ſurpriz'd to find it, the Gentleman that I had the Buſtle with. He wanted to drink a Glaſs of Wine withme He ſaid, and led me into a Room; when we were there, he told me he came for Satisfaction of the Affront I put upon him about an Hour ago; therefore draw, added he, or I'll run you through. I endeavour'd to pacify him with good Words, yet all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; he made ſo many Thruſts at me, that I was in danger of my Life; but at laſt I diſarm'd him, but not without a little Wound in my Arm: As ſoon as I gave him his Sword again, he puſh'd at me with all the Malice imaginable; and hearing the People from all Parts of the Houſe, coming to ſee what was the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0388001100:279"/>
he clap'd his Back againſt the Door to keep 'em out, which They on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide broke open, and giving him a puſh, his Breaſt ran againſt the point of my Sword, which appear'd at his Back, and he fell down without any ſign of Life. The People coming in, I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſecur'd, and carry'd to Priſon, till they knew whether he wou'd live, or die. I was mightily concern'd, not from any Danger was to be fear'd, but that it wou'd be a hindrance to my Voyage. The Gentleman continu'd in a violent Fever a great while, and his Life was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair'd of; but at laſt, after a tedious Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs recover'd, but continu'd weak. One Day he came to viſit me in a Chair, where I was confin'd, and told me He was very ſorry for what had happen'd, and that to day I ſhou'd be at liberty; and accordingly came an Order in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon for my Freedom, without paying any Fees. But to my great Grief the Fleet was ſail'd, and <hi>Benbow</hi>'s Squadron deſign'd for the <hi>Indies.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> beg'd me to be patient, and he wou'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me a Paſſage in a Store-Ship that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0388001100:280"/>
wou'd ſail in a Week at fartheſt for <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> and he was as good as his Word; for the next Day he carry'd me to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Young,</hi> Commander of the <hi>Tyger</hi> Store-Ship, and enter'd me immediately. Then my Heart began to be at Reſt, and I gave him Thanks; and for the time we ſtay'd there, Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> and I were very inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; and he expreſs'd himſelf ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teelly about our former Encounter, that he gain'd my Eſteem.</p>
            <p>Paſſion indeed, is certainly a Madneſs; and therefore what is done in that Heat ought to be forgot, if the Perſon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves repent of it. But how humane it wou'd be, if in the midſt of that Fire of Paſſion which blazes out, they cou'd ſprinkle the cool Water of Reaſon, and quench it? For nothing more deforms the Mind or Body than Paſſion, and 'tis then we loſe our humane Form, and are meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphos'd into Beaſts. How many great and good Men have done ſuch things in Paſſion, that they have repented of all their Lives after.

            <p>We ſet Sail from <hi>Spithead May</hi> the 18<hi>th,</hi> 1701, and our Captain gave us hopes of overtaking the Fleet, by reaſon he ſaid, one Ship cou'd make better way than a whole Fleet, being they were oblig'd to wait for one another. We met with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary but a Storm, that drove us almoſt upon the Iſland <hi>Madera<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which being ſo nigh, our Captain reſolv'd to Anchor at, and accordingly we did in the Bay of the City of <hi>Funzal,</hi> the Capitol of the Place, Captain <hi>Young</hi> and I went on Shore to view the Town.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Funzal,</hi> the Capitol of this Iſland, is a large handſome City, with one Cathedral and four other Churches, all neatly Built; two Cloiſters, one for the Men, and the other for the Women. The City contains 1600 Houſes. There is alſo computed to be upon this Iſland 100000 Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. I bought a <hi>Portugueze</hi> Book here that gives a better Account of the firſt Diſcovery of this Iſland than any I have ſeen extant, which Mr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for me in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I have ſeen it in

                  <p>WHEN <hi>England</hi> was ſettled in a laſting Peace, after the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moils and Hazard of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous War. King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, who conquer'd <hi>France,</hi> and fix'd his Royal Standard in the City of <hi>Paris:</hi> He who had felt the Inconveniences of War, knew how to encourage the Pleaſures of Peace, and <hi>London</hi> the Metropolitan City of the Kingdom, became the Seat of Mirth and

Jollity. All thoughts of War were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd; the Enſigns now were furl'd, and Swords were wore for Ornament, not Uſe. Among the reſt that embelliſh'd the Court, was one <hi>Lionel Machin,</hi> the youngeſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a noble Family, and conſequently not over-rich; yet a Gentleman (which often happens in younger Brothers) that was reckon'd the only Ornament of the Root from whence he ſprung. This Gentleman fell deſperately in Love with a Lady, beautiful to Perfection, and the only Boaſt of her Time. But there was a vaſt Diſparity in their Fortunes; for ſhe was the only Daughter to a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe Riches exceeded moſt of his Rank, and conſequently courted by thoſe that cou'd make her a Joynture equal to the Fortune her Father wou'd give her. But nevertheleſs the Force of Love is ſuch, that it never minds Intereſt nor Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the young Lady, whoſe Name was <hi>Arabella,</hi> was ſo much taken with the winning Behaviour of <hi>Lionel,</hi> that ſhe plac'd her entire Affection upon him, who was indeed, bating his ſlender Means, the moſt deſerving of her. But the Parents
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0388001100:285"/>
of <hi>Arabella</hi> hearing of the Amity that was between 'em, complain'd to King <hi>Edward,</hi> and beg'd that he wou'd interpoſe his Royal Authority. The King us'd many Perſwaſions to <hi>Lionel</hi> to withdraw his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but it was like bidding the Sun ſtand ſtill, or the Wind, or Rain, to ceaſe; for their Affections were ſo ſtrongly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that nothing cou'd ever part 'em. The Father having provided a fit Match for his Daughter, intreated the King to ſecure <hi>Lionel</hi> till the Marriage was ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd, who granted his Requeſt, and clapt <hi>Lionel</hi> in Priſon under pretence of ſome treaſonable Practices. When immediately the Marriage-Rites were perform'd, and <hi>Arabella</hi> was conſtrain'd to give her Hand where it was not in her Power to give her Heart; and Parents are to blame to force their Children to marry againſt their Inclinations, being from thence ſprings ſuch Diſorders in Families that is not in their Power to compoſe. As ſoon as the Ceremony was over, the Husband carry'd his Lady to a Palace, ſeated upon the River <hi>Severn,</hi> near <hi>Briſtol:</hi> When done, <hi>Lionel</hi> was releas'd out of Priſon,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0388001100:286"/>
but with a heavy Heart, for the Loſs of his dear <hi>Arabella.</hi> But ſtill his Love en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd from the Difficulties he found to obtain his Deſire, and knowing it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to live without her, thought of a Stratagem that gave him hopes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering all Difficulties. He ſummon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Thirty young Gentlemen, all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, Bold, and fit for any Undertaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When he had got 'em all together, he made this ſhort Oration to 'em:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">Moſt here are my Relations, or what's a nearer Tye, my Boſom-friends: You all know the Indignity I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, by <hi>Arabella</hi>'s forc'd Marriage; therefore I require you all to aſſiſt me in whatever I ſhall undertake (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tainting your Honour) to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd for the Affront put upon me. To this Requeſt they all agreed to ſerve him with their Lives and Fortunes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon it was reſolv'd to part and take ſeveral ways to <hi>Briſtol:</hi> When they all arriv'd at their Place of Rendezvous, they conſulted together, and reſolv'd to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0388001100:287"/>
ſeize any Ship in the River, that they found was fit for their turn. <hi>Lionel</hi> thought nothing difficult when Love was to be the Reward; but now he wanted ſome means to let <hi>Arabella</hi> know their Deſign: But at laſt it was agreed, that one of their Company ſhou'd enter into the Service of the Husband, which fell out as they cou'd wiſh, and a proper Perſon was hir'd to be Groom, where he had the care of a fine ſpotted Horſe, that us'd to carry the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy abroad, to viſit her Neighbours: The Wind proving fair, notice was given that the Project was to be put in Execution; the pretended Groom, to favour the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had omitted giving <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Horſe any Water. When <hi>Arabella</hi> had notice of the Hour, ſhe ordered her ſpotted Horſe to be Sadled, under pretence of taking the Air, attended with her Groom, and two more of her Domeſticks. When they came near the Cape of Land, where <hi>Lionel</hi> and his Companions waited for Her; the Horſe by beating of the Waves againſt the Shore heard and ſmelt the Water, and made down to it to Drink, where <hi>Lionel</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately lay'd hold of the Lady, (who
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0388001100:288"/>
ſeem'd to be mightily frighten'd) and put her in their Boat and made off. Now the Day that they had ſeiz'd the Lady, was alſo pitch'd on to ſeize the Ship they had a deſign upon; which was eaſily done, being their Crew were moſt of them a Shore. They cut her Cables, and made off to Sea withal the Sail they cou'd bear, and ſoon got out of ſight, and directed their Courſe for <hi>France,</hi> but a Storm met them and drove them quite contrary. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel</hi>'s Friends now began to Repent of their Undertaking, and <hi>Lionel</hi> was mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd for the Danger of Her, he Lov'd more dear than Life; who tho' mightily diſorder'd with the Sea, yet ſeem'd contented in having the Object of her Deſire with Her. Thirty Days they were the ſport of the Waves, every Day expecting Death; but one Morning they diſcover'd Land, high, craggy, and very Woody, which fill'd them with Joy, more eſpecially <hi>Lionel,</hi> for now he hop'd a reſting Place, for his dear <hi>Arabella.</hi> None in the Ship could gueſs what Land it cou'd be, for they knew it was not Inhabited, being Birds of all ſorts
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0388001100:289"/>
were ſo tame, that they would ſuffer themſelves to be taken with the Hand. The Place they choſe for their Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations was a fine Grove of Laurel-Trees that were very delightful, as was alſo every part of the Country they had rambled over. Finding they were to ſtay there a great while, they got out of their Ship ſeveral Neceſſaries, and liv'd very pleaſant for about 13 Days, deſigning to commit themſelves in a Day or two to the mercy of the Waves, for tho' the Iſland was delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to live in, yet it ſeem'd tireſome to thoſe that wanted many things they enjoy'd in their own Country.</p>
                  <p>The Night before they deſign'd to Embark, a violent Storm roſe, and drove the Ship from the Iſland with about 16 Men that were preparing all things for Sailing the next Day. Theſe were toſt by the Winds and Sea for many Days, but at laſt, to their great Joy, diſcover'd Land, where they ran their Ship on Shore, being ſhe was ſo leaky ſhe could hardly Swim. But their Joy for being ſav'd from the watry Element,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0388001100:290"/>
ſoon chang'd to Sorrow, when they found themſelves taken by the <hi>Moors;</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Landed on the Coaſt of <hi>Africk.</hi> Their new Maſters (after hard uſage) arriv'd at the City of <hi>Morocco,</hi> with their Purchaſe, where they ſold them in the Market like <hi>Cows,</hi> or <hi>Oxen;</hi> but all declaring they were Men of Rank, they were Impriſon'd, in hopes of large Ranſoms.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Lionel</hi> and <hi>Arabella,</hi> and the reſt that were left on Shore, diſcover'd the next Morning their fatal Diſaſter; Grief ſiez'd them with ſuch a force, that ſome of them loſt their Senſes, running Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick up and down the Woods, and raving, kill'd themſelves. Poor <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Grief ſunk inward, and prey'd upon her Life with ſuch Violence, that Death appear'd to her Reſcue: She never upbraided <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> with her Misfortunes, but clos'd her Eyes with a true Repentance of her fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lionel</hi> was like a diſtracted Man, lay'd himſelf down at her Feet, and cou'd not be remov'd till Death gave him his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe. His Companions bury'd them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one Grave, and at the Foot E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0388001100:291"/>
a Croſs, to ſhew thoſe that were Interr'd there, dy'd under the Banner of Chriſt: Upon the Bark of the Tree, they cut in Letters the whole Story of their Misfortunes. The reſt that remain'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Iſland, propos'd to themſelves of venturing into their Boat (which by good Fortune was left on Shore) and ſteer'd their Courſe to the nigheſt main Land, where they happily arriv'd without Danger, but ran the ſame Fate with their other Companions that were thrown on the ſame Coaſt in the Ship, that they all thought was caſt away. All the comfort they receiv'd in their Misfortunes, was, that they were committed to the ſame Priſon, that their Companions were in. They were over Joy'd to find thoſe alive that were thought dead, but mourn'd to think of meeting in ſuch a melancholly Place. In the ſame Priſon was one <hi>Juan de Morales,</hi> a noted Pilot, and an excellent Navigator; this Man was mightily pleas'd with the Tales of theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſo often beg'd them to repeat their Adventures, that he had every Mark of the Iſland exact, and perfectly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0388001100:292"/>
ſaw it in immagination. In the Year 1416 <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> Son to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> dy'd in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and left con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Sums of Money to redeem <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Priſoners that were Captive in <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> among the reſt was <hi>Juan de Morales,</hi> and at the ſame time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men got their Ranſom, and ſafely arriv'd in their own Country, with a Pardon for their Offence from the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Husband of <hi>Arabella. Morales</hi> and all his Ship's Crew, were taken by the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,</hi> who met with 'em cruiſing in thoſe Seas, but all excepting <hi>Morales</hi> had their Liberty given them, who was detain'd for his Knowledge in the Mathematicks, and Promiſes were made him of great Recompence, if he wou'd ſerve King <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> in his Diſcoveries.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as they were arriv'd at <hi>Lisbon, Morales</hi> was preſented to the King, by <hi>Don Henry</hi> the <hi>Infant,</hi> who was a great encourager to new Diſcoveries, where he open'd the whole Story of <hi>Lionel</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella:</hi> Which was ſo generally receiv'd, that a Fleet was order'd immediately for this new Voyage, and <hi>June</hi> the 2<hi>d,</hi> 1420
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0388001100:293"/>
ſet out to Sea well Arm'd. They deſign'd firſt for <hi>Porto Sancto,</hi> as being nigh the Iſland as <hi>Morales</hi> conjectur'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> abandon'd.</p>
                  <p>When they arriv'd there, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants advis'd them not to go any farther in their Diſcoveries towards the N. E. being there was a black Cloud which wou'd terminate their Navigation, becauſe there was not any one that ever attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, but loſt their Lives for their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and were never heard of more. Notwithſtanding <hi>Gonſalvo</hi> the Admiral, and <hi>Morales</hi> the Pilot, were well aſſur'd that very Cloud was the Iſland they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find, they were the more convinc'd in it, by reaſon the Cloud continu'd of the ſame colour thro' every Change of the Moon. But the reſt of the Ship's Crew were of the contrary Opinion, and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniz'd againſt <hi>Morales,</hi> telling him that he being a <hi>Caſtilian,</hi> (an conſequently their Enemy) did it to Diſgrace them; and that it was a Preſumptious thing to pretend to ſearch into the Secrets of Providence.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding their grumblings, they ſet Sail from <hi>Porto Sancto,</hi> and made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0388001100:294"/>
for their Diſcovery; but the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they approach'd this Cloud, the more frightful it grew, which caus'd a terrible fear in all the Sailors, intreating <hi>Gonſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> to return, and not to be the Death of ſo many innocent People. But ſtill they held their Courſe for all their Clamours; yet <hi>Gonſales</hi> to encourage the Sailors, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd 'em it muſt be firm Land, and to diſſipate their Fears, made 'em this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Oration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">Why ſhou'd I be more hardy than you, but that I am confirm'd it is as I tell you? If there ſhou'd be any Danger, have I any Means to extricate my ſelf more than your ſelves? Is not my Life as precious to me, as any of yours, my Companions? A Fool-hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs does not become us, it's true; but a firm Courage is what all Men ſhou'd be endu'd with.

                  </p>
                  <p>They proceeded chearfully, animated by this Oration, and in a little time enter'd the Cloud, or ſettled Fog; but the Tide driving the Veſſel too far North, they put out their Boats to Tow their Ship in the midſt of the Cloud; but the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they Row'd, the Cloud ſeem'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and preſently after they diſcover'd Land to their great Joy, being it was what but few of them expected: The firſt Cape they diſcover'd, was call'd by <hi>Gonſales,</hi> Cape St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> which they doubled and ſaw a fine and fertile Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try full of fair and lofty Trees, that made the proſpect Delightful. Sailing on, they diſcover'd a large Bay, which <hi>Morales</hi> judg'd to be the Place where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were thrown; but it being late, <hi>Gonſales</hi> order'd to let fall the Anchors, not caring to Land till they had the whole Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. The next Morning they Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and found it to be the ſame Place where <hi>Lionel Machin,</hi> and <hi>Arabella</hi> were Bury'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0388001100:296"/>
When they had given account to the Admiral of the State of Things, He Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and took Poſſeſſion of the Iſland for his Maſter, <hi>John</hi> the Firſt, King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> They erected an Altar upon the Tomb of the two Lovers; ſaid Maſs, and return'd God thanks for their happy Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gonſales</hi> term'd the Iſland <hi>Madera</hi> from the quantity of its Wood, (which in the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Language ſignifies Woody) that was found all over the Iſland, but no humane Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>After they had ſearch'd well on Shore, Boats were order'd to Row round the Iſland, being it was dangerous for their Ship, by reaſon of many Rocks and Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that lay in the Water. So ſteering Weſt, they diſcover'd four fine ſmall Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers running into the Sea, the Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreamly clear. <hi>Gonſales</hi> order'd ſome to be bottled to preſent to the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> his Maſter at his Return.</p>
                  <p>Going farther, ſeveral Soldiers were Landed in a Valley, which was water'd by a fine River, and a noble Grove of Trees that made a perfect Harbour, where <hi>Gonſales</hi> erected a large Croſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0388001100:297"/>
Sailing on, they came to a Point of Land that ran a great way into the Sea, which was inhabited by ſuch a Number of great, different Birds, that the Men were afraid of being devour'd by 'em. This Place was nam'd <hi>Punta des Gralhos,</hi> from the large Number of Birds.</p>
                  <p>Going forward, they diſcover'd a Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley cover'd with fine large Cedar-Trees; next to that they found another large one, where was a great Lake or Pond, from whence they cou'd perceive the Bay they ſet out from. With ſearching the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they diſcover'd a large Plain, which overlook'd the reſt of the Iſland, free from Trees, but cover'd over with a beautiful Fennal, call'd by the Portugueze <hi>Funchall.</hi> Upon this Plain they built a City, and call'd it <hi>Funchall,</hi> from the quantity of Fennel that was found there, which was formerly a Biſhop's See, but is ſtill the chief Place for Temporal Affairs.</p>
                  <p>From this Plain runs three Rivers into the Sea, which form an Iſland, and Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock the Haven, ſecure from Storms and Tempeſts.</p>

Two reſolute Soldiers pull'd off their Cloaths, and attempted to ſwim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the Stream, but were hurry'd away with the Current in ſuch an impetuous manner, that they had periſh'd if they had not been timely ſuccour'd by their Companions by Ropes, which they threw in, and pull'd 'em up againſt the Violence of the Stream. This Torrent they nam'd <hi>Soccorides,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The moſt remarkable Thing they found in their Voyage, was a great Number of Sea-Wolves, which ruſh'd out of a Cave into the Water when they approach'd 'em. <hi>Gonſales</hi> gather'd all Sorts of Plants, Roots, Flowers and Minerals, together with all Sorts of Birds, and a large Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the Earth, and imbark'd for <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> where he ſafely arriv'd <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> The ſame Year 1420, where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd with all the favour imaginable.</p>

In <hi>May</hi> 1421, <hi>Gonſales</hi> was made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the whole Iſland, with an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Title of <hi>Count,</hi> and in the ſame Month ſet Sail with his Wife and two Daughters, and many more, for the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the ſame, where he happily arriv'd, and laid the Foundation for the preſent Capitol of <hi>Funchal,</hi> or <hi>Funzal,</hi> but to Honour <hi>Lionel Machin,</hi> who was there interr'd, he call'd the Place <hi>Porto Machino,</hi> and over the Grave he erected a noble Church. Some Writers relate that <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſales</hi> ſet the Woods on fire, that continued burning for ſeven Years, which made Wood ſcarce in that Iſland; but there is ſuch Plenty of all Sorts, that I look upon that Story but as a Fable.

any other Iſland, as large again. The Graſs ſhoots up ſo high, that they are oblig'd to burn it, and in the Aſhes they plant Sugar-Canes, which in ſix Months time produce Sugar. The Inhabitants are more civiliz'd than any of the <hi>Canary</hi>-Iſlands.</p>

            <p>After we had made an End of our Affairs, we ſet Sail from thence, and directed our Courſe for <hi>Teneriff,</hi> one of the <hi>Canary</hi>-Iſlands, or the <hi>Inſulae Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natae</hi> of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> where we ſafely arriv'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Iſland lies in twenty-ſeven De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and thirty Minutes; about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Leagues in length. <hi>Sancta Cruze,</hi> the Place where we Anchor'd, is the chief Harbour. It is an Iſland very well inhabited, containing three Cities, or large Towns, beſides a great Number of Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But what it's fam'd moſt for is the <hi>Pike,</hi> or high Mountain, that rears its Head above the Clouds, and ſeems to ſcale even Heaven it ſelf. I have ſeen many People that have told me they have been at the Top of this Mountain: But none give ſo good a Deſcription of it (and even the whole Iſland) as the Right Reverend Dr. <hi>Sprat</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory of the Royal Society;</hi> which is as follows.</p>

               <p>Having furniſh'd our ſelves with a Guide, Servants, and Horſes, to carry our Wine and Proviſion; we ſet forth from <hi>Oratava,</hi> a Port-Town in the Iſland of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> ſituated on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, two Miles diſtant from the Main Sea, and travell'd from twelve at Night till eight in the Morning, by which time we got to the Top of the firſt Mountain, towards the <hi>Pico de Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raira:</hi> There, under a very large, and conſpicuous Pine-Tree, we took our Breakfaſt, Din'd, and refreſh'd our ſelves till Two in the Afternoon: Then we paſs'd through many ſandy Ways, over many lofty Mountains, but naked and bare, and not cover'd with any Pine-Trees, as our firſt Night's Paſſage was. This expos'd us to exceſſive Heat, till we arriv'd at the Foot of the <hi>Pico,</hi> where we found many huge Stones, which ſeem'd to have fall'n from ſome upper Part: About ſix in the Evening we began to aſcend the <hi>Pico,</hi> but we were ſcarce advanc'd a Mile, and the Way being no more paſſable for Horſes, we left them with our Servants. In the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0388001100:302"/>
Aſcent of one Mile, ſome of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany grew very faint and ſick, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by Fluxes, Vomitings, and Aguiſh Diſtempers, our Horſe's Hairs ſtanding upright like Briſtles, and calling for ſome of our Wine, carry'd on ſmall Barrels on a Horſe; we found it ſo wonderfully cold, that we cou'd not drink it till we had made a Fire to warm it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Air was very calm and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate. But when the Sun was ſet, it began to blow with ſuch Violence, and grew ſo cold, that taking up our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt the hollow Rocks, we were neceſſitated to keep great Fires in the Mouths of 'em all Night. About Four in the Morning we began to mount a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and being come another Mile up, one of our Company fail'd, and was not able to proceed any farther. Here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the black Rocks. The reſt of us purſu'd our Journey till we came to the Sugar-Loaf, where we began to travel again in a White Sand, being fitted with Shooes, whoſe ſingle Soles are made a Finger broader than the upper Leather to encounter this difficult Paſſage. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0388001100:303"/>
aſcended as far as the black Rocks, which lay all flat like a plain Floor. We climb'd within a Mile of the very Top of the <hi>Pico,</hi> and at laſt we gain'd the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, where we found no ſuch Smoak as appear'd a little below, but a continual Perſpiration of a hot and ſulphurous Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, that made our Faces extreamly ſore. All this way we found no conſiderable Alteration of the Air, and very little Wind, but on the Top it was ſo impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, that we had much ado to ſtand againſt it, whilſt we drank the King's Health, and fired each of us a Piece. Here alſo we took our Dinner, but found that our Strong-Waters had loſt their Virtue, and were almoſt inſipid, while our Wine was more ſpirituous and brisk than before. The Top on which we ſtood being not above a Yard broad, is the brink of a Pit, call'd the <hi>Caldera,</hi> which we judg'd to be a Musket-Shot over, and near fourſcore Yards deep, in form of a <hi>Cone,</hi> hollow within like a <hi>Kettle,</hi> and cover'd with ſmall looſe Stones, mix'd with Sulphure and Sand, from among which iſſu'd divers Spiracles
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0388001100:304"/>
of Smoak and Heat; which being ſtirr'd with any thing, puffs and makes a Noiſe, and ſo offenſive, that we were almoſt ſuffocated with the ſudden Emanation of Vapours, upon the removing one of theſe Stones, which were ſo hot as not eaſily to be handled. We deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not above four or five Yards into the <hi>Caldera,</hi> becauſe of the ſlipperineſs under foot, and the difficulty; but ſome have adventured to the Bottom. Other Matters obſervable, we diſcover'd none, beſides a clear ſort of Sulphur which lay like Salt upon the Stones. From this renown'd <hi>Pico</hi> we cou'd ſee the <hi>Grand Canaries,</hi> 14 Leagues diſtant; <hi>Palma,</hi> 18; and <hi>Gomera,</hi> 7; which interval of Sea ſeem'd not much wider than the <hi>Thames</hi> about <hi>London.</hi> We diſcern'd alſo the <hi>Herro,</hi> being diſtant about 20 Leagues, and ſo to the utmoſt Limits of the Sea, much farther. As ſoon as the Sun appear'd, the ſhadow of the <hi>Pico</hi> ſeem'd to cover, not only the whole Iſland, and the <hi>Grand Canaries,</hi> but the Sea, to the very Horizon, where the top of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0388001100:305"/>
                  <hi>Sugar-Loaf</hi> or <hi>Pico,</hi> viſibly appear'd to turn up, and caſt its ſhade into the Air itſelf, at which we were much ſurpriz'd; but the Sun was not far Aſcended, when the Clouds began to riſe ſo faſt, as that they intercepted our Proſpect both of the Sea, and the whole Iſland, except the tops only of the ſubjacent Mountains, which ſeem'd to pierce them thro'. Whether theſe Clouds do ever ſurmount the <hi>Pico,</hi> we can't ſay, but to ſuch as are far below, they ſeem ſometimes to hang above it, or rather wrap themſelves about it, as conſtantly when the Weſt Winds blow; this they call the <hi>Cap,</hi> and is the infallible Prognoſtick of inſuing Storms. One of our Company who made this Journey agen two Years after arriving at the top of the <hi>Pico</hi> before Day, and creeping under a great Stone to ſhroud himſelf from the cold Air, after a little ſpace found himſelf all wet, and perceiv'd it to come from a perpetual trickling of Water from the Rocks above him. Many excellent and exuberant Springs we found iſſuing from the tops of moſt of the other
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0388001100:306"/>
Mountains, guſhing out in great Spouts almoſt as far as the huge <hi>Pine-tree,</hi> which we mention'd before. Having ſtay'd a while at the top, we all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended the ſandy Way, till we came to the foot of the <hi>Sugar-Loaf,</hi> which being ſteep, even almoſt to a perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, we ſoon paſs'd; and here we met with a Cave about 10 Yards deep, and 15 broad, being in ſhape like an Oven, or <hi>Cupola,</hi> having a hole at the top, near 8 Yards over. This we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended by a Rope that our Servants held faſt at the top, while with the other end (being faſtned about our middles) we ſwung our ſelves, till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over a Bank of <hi>Snow,</hi> we ſlid down lighting upon it; we were forc'd to ſwing thus in our deſcent, becauſe in the midſt of the bottom of this Cave, oppoſite to the overture at the top, is a round Pit of Water, like a Well, the Surface whereof is about a Yard lower, but as wide as the Mouth at top, and about ſix Fathom deep. We ſuppos'd this Water not a Spring, but diſſolved <hi>Snow</hi> blown in, or Water trickling
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0388001100:307"/>
thro' the Rocks. About the ſides of the Grot, for ſome height there is Ice and Icicles hanging down to the <hi>Snow.</hi> But being quickly weary of this exceſſive cold Place, and drawn up again, we continu'd our Deſcent from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, by the ſame Paſſage we went up the Day before, and ſo about five in the Evening arriv'd at <hi>Orotava,</hi> from whence we ſet forth; our Faces ſo red and ſore, that to coll 'em, we were forc'd to waſh and bath them in whites of Eggs. The whole height of the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> in Perpendicular is vulgarly eſteem'd to be two Miles and a half; no Trees, Herbs, nor Shrubs did we find in all the Paſſage, but <hi>Pines;</hi> and among the whiter Sands, a kind of <hi>Broom</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a buſhy Plant; and on that ſide where we lay all Night, a kind of <hi>Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> which had ſtems eight Foot high, and the Trunk near a Foot thick, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtem growing in four Squares, and emerging from the Ground like tuffs of Ruſhes; upon the edges of theſe Stems grow very ſmall red Buttons, or Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which being ſqueez'd, produce a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0388001100:308"/>
poiſonous Milk; which falling upon any part of a Horſe, or other Beaſt, fetches off all the Hair from the Skin immediately; of the withered Sticks of this Vegetable we made our Fire all Night. This Plant is alſo univerſally ſpread over the Iſland, and is perhaps a kind of <hi>Euphorbium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the Iſland <hi>Teneriff</hi> it ſelf, this Account was given by a Judicious and Ingenious Man who liv'd twenty Years in it, as a Phyſician and Merchant, his Opinion is, that the whole Iſland being a Soil mightily impregnated with Brimſtone, did in former Times take Fire, and blow up all, or near all, at the ſame time; and that many Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of huge Stone, calcin'd and burnt, which appears all over this Iſland, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the South-Weſt part of it, were caſt up, and rais'd out of the Bowels of the Earth, at the time of that General Conflagration; and that the greateſt Quantity of this Sulphur, lying about the Centre of the Iſland, rais'd up the <hi>Pico</hi> to that heighth at which it is now ſeen; and he ſays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0388001100:309"/>
that any one upon the Place, that ſhall carefully Note the Situation, and Manner of thoſe calcin'd Rocks, how they lie, will eaſily be of that Mind; for they lie (ſays he) three, or four Miles almoſt round the bottom of the <hi>Pico,</hi> and in ſuch Order one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, almoſt to the <hi>Sugar-Loaf,</hi> as it is call'd, as if the whole Ground ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and riſing up together, by the Aſcention of the Brimſtone, the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and Rivers of it, did with a ſudden Eruption, rowl, and tumble them down from the reſt of the Rocks, eſpecially (as is ſaid before) to the South-Weſt, for on that ſide from the very top of the <hi>Pico,</hi> almoſt to the Sea Coaſt, lie huge heaps of theſe burnt Rocks one under another; and there ſtill remain the very Tracts of the Brimſtone Rivers, as they run over this Quarter of the Iſland, which has ſo waſted the Ground beyond recovery that nothing can be made to grow there but <hi>Broom:</hi> But on the North-ſide of the <hi>Pico,</hi> few or none of theſe Stones appear'd; and hence he concludes, that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0388001100:310"/>
the <hi>Vulcanio</hi> diſcharg'd it ſelf chiefly on the South-Weſt ſide. He adds far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that at the ſame time Mines of ſeveral Mettles were blown up, ſome of thoſe calcin'd Rocks reſembling Iron-Oar, ſome Silver, and others Copper; particularly on the South-Weſt Parts, call'd <hi>Azuleios</hi> being very high Mountains, where never any <hi>Engliſhman</hi> but himſelf (that ever he heard of) was. There are vaſt quantities of a looſe blewiſh Earth, mixt with blew Stones, which have a yellow ruſt upon 'em, like that of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or Vitriol; as alſo many ſmall Springs of Vitriol Water, where he ſuppoſes a Copper Mine, and he was told by a Bell-founder of <hi>Oratavia,</hi> that he got out of two Horſe Loads of this Earth, as much Gold as made two large Rings: And a <hi>Portugueze</hi> who had been in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> told him, that his Opinion was, there were as good Mines of Gold and Silver there, as the beſt in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> Thereabouts alſo are Nitrous Waters, and Stones cover'd over with a deep
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0388001100:311"/>
Saffron-colour'd ruſt, taſting of Iron; and farther, he mentions one of his Friends, which of two Lumps of Earth or Oar, brought from the top of this ſide of the Mountain, made two Silver Spoons. All this he confirm'd by the laſt Inſtance of the <hi>Palm</hi>-Iſland, 18 League from the <hi>Teneriff,</hi> where, about 12 Years ſince a <hi>Vulcanio</hi> was fix'd, the violence thereof made an Earthquake in this Iſland, ſo great, that he and others ran out of their Houſes, fearing they wou'd have fallen upon their Heads; they heard the noiſe of the Torrent of flaming Brimſtone, like Thunder, and ſaw the Fires as plain by Night, for ſix Weeks together, as a burning Torch, and ſo much Sand and Aſhes brought from thence by the Wind and Clouds fell upon his Hat, as would fill the Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box of his Inkhorn.</p>
               <p>In ſome places of this Iſland grows a crooked Shrub call'd <hi>Legnan,</hi> which they bring for <hi>England</hi> as a ſweet Wood. There are likewiſe. <hi>Apricocks, Peach-trees,</hi> and others, which bear
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0388001100:312"/>
twice a Year; alſo <hi>Pear-trees,</hi> as preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; <hi>Almonds</hi> with a tender Shell; <hi>Palms, Plantains, Oranges</hi> and <hi>Lemons,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Paeguadaes,</hi> which have ſmall ones within them, from whence they are ſo denominated. Alſo they have <hi>Sugar-Canes,</hi> and a little <hi>Cotton, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquintida,</hi> &amp;c. The Roſes blow at <hi>Chriſtmaſs;</hi> there are good <hi>Carnations,</hi> and very large, but no <hi>Tulips</hi> will grow or thrive there; <hi>Samphire</hi> cloaths the Rocks in abundance, and a kind of Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Ground. Another Graſs grows near the Sea, which is of a broader Leaf, ſo luſcious and rank, that it will kill a Horſe that eats of it, but no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beaſt. Eighty Ears of Wheat have been found to ſpring from one Root, but grows not very high; the Corn of this is tranſparent, like the pureſt yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Amber, and one Buſhel has brought forth a hundred in a ſeaſonable Year.</p>
               <p>The Canary Birds which they bring to us in <hi>England,</hi> bred in the <hi>Baran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi>'s or <hi>Gills,</hi> which the Water has fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away in the Mountains, being Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces very cold. There are alſo <hi>Quails,</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0388001100:313"/>
                  <hi>Partridges</hi> larger than ours, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beautiful, great Wood <hi>Pidgeons, Turtles</hi> at Spring, <hi>Crows,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Falcons</hi> come flying over from the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bees are carried into the Mountains, where they proſper exceedingly, and there they have wild Goats which climb to the very top of the <hi>Pico</hi> ſometimes; alſo Hogs, and multitude of Coneys.</p>
               <p>Of Fiſh, they have the <hi>Cherna,</hi> a very large and excellent Fiſh, better taſted than any we have in <hi>England;</hi> the <hi>Mera, Dolphins, Lobſters</hi> without great Claws, <hi>Muſsles, Periwincles,</hi> and the <hi>Clacas,</hi> which is abſolutely the very beſt Shell-Fiſh in the World; they grow in the Rocks five or ſix under one great Shell, thro' the top Holes whereof they peep out with their Nibs, from whence (the Shells being broken open a little more with a Stone) the draw them, there is alſo another ſort of Fiſh like an <hi>Eel,</hi> which hath ſix or ſeven Tails of a ſpan long, united to one Head and Body, which is alſo as ſhort; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there they have <hi>Turtles</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brido's,</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0388001100:314"/>
which are better than our Trouts. The Iſland is full of Springs of freſh Water, taſting like Milk; which in <hi>Lalagima,</hi> where the Water is not ſo clear and Lympid, they cleanſe by percolating it through a kind of ſpungy Stone, cut in form of a baſon. The Vines which afford thoſe excellent Wines grow all about the Iſland within a Mile of the Sea; ſuch as are planted farther up are not much eſteem'd, nor will they thrive in any of the other Iſlands. Concerning the <hi>Guanchio's</hi> or antient Inhabitants, he gave this full account the 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> about 12 Years ſince, he took his Journey from <hi>Guimar,</hi> a Town for the moſt part In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, by ſuch as derive themſelves from the antient <hi>Guanchio</hi>'s in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſome of them, to view their Caves, and the Corps buried in them: (a Favour they ſeldom or never permit to any, having the Corps of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors in great Veneration, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe being extremely againſt any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation of the Dead) but he had done ſeveral Elemoſinary Cures among them,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0388001100:315"/>
for they are very poor (yet the pooreſt think themſelves too good to Marry with the beſt <hi>Spaniard)</hi> which endear'd him to them exceedingly; otherwiſe it is Death for any Stranger to viſit theſe Caves and Bodies. The Corps are ſew'd up in Goats Skins, with Thongs of the ſame, with very great Curioſity, particularly in the incomparable exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and evenneſs of the Seams; and the Skins are made very cloſe and fit to the Corps, which are for the moſt part entire, the Eyes clos'd, Hair on their Heads, Ears, Noſe, Teeth, Lips and Beard, all perfect, only diſcolour'd, and a little ſhrivled; likewiſe the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda of both Sexes. He ſaw about three or 4 Hundred in ſeveral Caves, ſome of them ſtanding, others lying upon Beds of Wood, ſo hardened by an Art they had (which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Curay,</hi> to cure a piece of Wood) that no Iron can pierce or hurt it. Theſe Bodies are very light, as if made of Straw, and in ſome broken Bodies be obſerv'd the Nerves and Tendons, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſpring of the Veins and Arteries
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0388001100:316"/>
very diſtinctly. By the relation of the moſt antient of this Iſland, they had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Tribe that had this Art only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, and kept as a Thing Sacred, and not to be communicated to the Vulgar; theſe mixt not themſelves with the reſt of the Inhabitants, nor Marry'd out of their own Tribe, and were alſo their Prieſts and Miniſters of Religion. But when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Conquer'd the Place, moſt of them were deſtroy'd, and the Art periſhed with them, only they held ſome Traditions yet of a few Ingredients that were us'd in this Buſineſs; they took Butter (ſome ſay they mix'd Bears-greaſe with it) which they kept for that purpoſe in the Skins; wherein they boyl'd certain Herbs, firſt a kind of wild Lavender, which grows there in great Quantities upon the Rocks; ſecondly, an Herb call'd <hi>Lara,</hi> of a very gummy and glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous Conſiſtence, which now grows there under the tops of the Mountains; thirdly, a kind of <hi>Cyclamen</hi> or Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread; fourthly, wild Sage, which grows plentifully, upon this Iſland;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0388001100:317"/>
theſe, with others bruis'd and boyl'd up with Butter, rendred it a perfect Balſam; this prepar'd, they firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowel the Corps (and in the poorer ſort, to ſave Charges, took out the Brains behind) after the Body was thus order'd, they had in readineſs a <hi>Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium</hi> made of the Bark of Pine-trees, wherewith they waſh'd the Body, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in the Sun in Summer, and in the Winter in a Stove, this repeating very often; afterwards they began their Unction, both without and within, drying it as before; this they continued till the Balſam had penetrated into the whole Habit, and the Muſcle, in all parts appeared through the contracted Skin, and the Body become exceeding light, then they ſew'd them up in Goats-skins, as was before mention'd. The antients ſay, that they have above twenty Caves of their Kings and great Perſonages, with their whole Families, yet unknown to any but themſelves, and which they will never diſcover. Laſtly he ſays, that Bodies are found in the Caves of the Grand <hi>Canaries</hi> in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0388001100:318"/>
Sacks, quite conſumed, and not as theſe in <hi>Teneriff.</hi> Antiently when they had no knowledge of Iron, they made their Lances of Wood, harden'd as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore memtion'd. They have earthen Pots ſo hard that they cannot be broken: Of theſe ſome are found in the Caves, and old <hi>Bavances,</hi> and us'd by the poorer People that find them to boyl Meat in. Their Food is Barley parch'd and then ground with little ſtone Mills, and mingled with Milk and Honey, which they always carry with them in Goats-skins at their Backs: To this Day they drink no Wine, nor care for Fleſh, they are very ingenious, lean tall, active, and full of Courage, for they leap from Rock to Rock, from a prodigious Height, till they come to the bottom, ſometimes making ten Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms deep at one leap, in this manner: Firſt they tertiate their Lances, which are about the bigneſs of a half Pike, and aim with the point at any piece of a Rock, upon which they intend to light, ſometimes not half a Foot broad, in leaping off they clap their Feet cloſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0388001100:319"/>
to the Launce, and ſo carry their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in the Air, the point of their Launce comes firſt to the Place, which breaks the force of their Fall; then they ſlide gently down by the Staff, and pitch with their Feet on the very place they firſt deſign'd, and ſo from Rock to Rock, till they come to the bottom; but their Novices ſometimes break their Necks in the learning. He told alſo (and the ſame was very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confirm'd by a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Canary</hi> Merchant there in the Company) that they whiſtle ſo loud, as to be heard five Miles off, and that to be in the ſame Room with them when they whiſtle, were enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the breaking the Tympanum of the Ear; and added, that he (being in Company of one that whiſtled his loudeſt) could not hear perfectly in 15 Days after; he affirms alſo, that they throw Stones with a force almoſt as great as that of a Bullet; and now uſe Stones in all their Fights as they did antiently.</p>

a Galley with <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Colours out, Rowing up to us with all their Strength; we were all ſurpriz'd and amaz'd, and cou'd hardly give credit to our Eyes, being no one on Board us ever heard of a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Galley ſo far from their own Coaſt; but it ſeems we were nigher <hi>Africk</hi> than we ſuppos'd, as it prov'd afterwards. Our Captain told us we had nothing to do but fight it to the laſt; for if we were taken, we might be Slaves all our Lives long. I advis'd our Captain to put out our Boat, and tow our Ship from 'em: For, ſays I, if a Wind does not riſe in the mean time, that we may eſcape 'em, yet we ſhall gain more time to put our ſelves in Readineſs to receive 'em when they come up with us. This Advice was approv'd on, and the Boat was got out immediately with ſix Men to Row, and I oblig'd my ſelf to go along with her to ſteer her right, that they might Row with all their Strength. We Tow'd ſo tightly for an Hour, that we made pretty good way with our Ship; but for all our Endeavours, we found that in about ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hour they wou'd get up with us; but we deſign'd to Row till they were
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0388001100:322"/>
within a Quarter of a Mile of us, and then go into the Ship again. In the mean time our Men on Board had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd every thing, and were in good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to receive 'em. We had ſixteen Guns, and forty Men, and Ammunition enough. We were preparing to come on Board, when we found they were almoſt up with us, but our Captain advis'd me not, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd us to have Arms in the Boat, with ſome Hand-Granado's; and as ſoon as we ſhou'd ſee 'em Engag'd, to go to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Side of the Enemy, and fire upon 'em, and by that means we ſhou'd amuſe 'em, that they wou'd not venture to Board us. Immediately it was agreed, and two more Men together, with our Arms, were put into us. The Galley came up with us in an Inſtant, and hail'd us in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and bid us ſtrike our Colours immediately, or it ſhou'd be worſe for us, but were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd by us with our Cannon, inſtead of our Voices, and we went to it. Now to obey my Orders, I loos'd my Tow-Rope, Row'd to get on the other Side of the Galley, but was mightily ſurpriz'd to find their Boat out, and about the Number of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0388001100:323"/>
twenty <hi>Turks</hi> getting into her, our Men in the Boat advis'd immediately to return, but I told 'em 'twas too late, for it wou'd be worſe for us if we did: Nay, our Captain call'd to us to come on Board, but I thought they wou'd do us more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury in getting up the Ship's ſide, than if we ſtood 'em boldly, which we reſolv'd to do: There was nine of us, and we had Arms enough; ſo before they cou'd fire at us, we diſcharg'd our Muskets at 'em, and laid our ſelves under the Gunnel of our Boat to charge again: When we were prepar'd, I order'd 'em not to ſtir till the <hi>Turks</hi> had fired; and as ſoon as they had done ſo, to ſet Fire to the Fuze of their Hand-<hi>Grando's,</hi> and throw 'em upon 'em, as ſoon as we heard the <hi>Turks</hi> fire, which did us no Damage, we ſet Fire to our Hand-<hi>Granado's,</hi> as agreed upon, and threw 'em in upon 'em; but they ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething, it ſeems, order'd but half their Number to fire at firſt, and the other half fired upon us ſo unluckily, when we roſe to diſcharge our <hi>Granado's,</hi> that they kill'd three of my Men out-right, wounded another dangerouſly, and my ſelf in the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0388001100:324"/>
left Arm. It is true, our <hi>Granado's</hi> kill'd 'em four, and wounded ſeveral; but ſtill their Number doubled ours, and now they prepar'd to Board us. My four Companions and my ſelf fired upon 'em with our Pieces, but cou'd not prevent 'em Boarding us; yet we clubb'd our Muskets on both Sides, and fell to work; but a <hi>Turk</hi> coming behind me while I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging with another, and ſtruck the Cock of his Piſtol into my Skull, and I drop'd down for Dead; but when I came to my ſelf, which was not in ſeveral Hours, as I was told, I found my ſelf on Board the Galley,</p>
            <p>They had order'd a <hi>Surgeon</hi> to dreſs my Wounds, which were three; one in my left Arm, that in my Skull, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the Side of my Throat, which I did not feel in the receiving. I was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to be taken particular care of; for being I was not in a Sailor's Habit, they thought I was ſomething above the reſt, and therefore hop'd to get a conſiderable Sum for my Ranſom. The Surgeon that dreſs'd me was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Renegado, whoſe Name was <hi>Matthews.</hi> The Captain was
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0388001100:325"/>
an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> too, born at <hi>Deptford,</hi> but the vileſt Wretch ſure that ever breath'd. There were ſeveral other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's on Board, moſt of 'em profligate Wretches. I underſtood from my Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, that the two Veſſels parted after a deſparate Engagement, and the <hi>Turks</hi> had above fifty Men kill'd and wounded. Three of my Companions were Priſoners likewiſe; the fourth being kill'd in the laſt Conflict, and the other expir'd in the Boat with his Wounds. When I began to mend, I walk'd upon Deck, and look'd about me a little; the other three (being well) had renounc'd their Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; he who dy'd for their Sins, and took upon him the State of Man, that he might redeem us miſerable Sinners from the Curſe of the Serpent. What muſt be their Puniſhment, who for a little Eaſe in this World, forego their Portion of Eternal Life? If the Tortures of Hell have their Degrees, the laſt and greateſt muſt be their Lot. The Captain of the Galley order'd me one Day to be brought before him on the Deck, where he told me, If I did not in a Twelvemonth procure him to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0388001100:326"/>
the Value of Eight hundred Pound for my Ranſom; I ſhou'd be chain'd to the Oar, and be a Slave all my Life; (it ſeems one of the Three that was taken with me, had fold him of my Abilities, and that I was poſſeſs'd of a plentiful Fortune.) I anſwer'd, I would ſend to <hi>England,</hi> and do my Endeavour to get that Sum; but I told him it was more than I was worth, and there was no hopes of ſo much Money for my Ranſom, unleſs my Friends wou'd out of Charity contribute towards it. I added, I believ'd I cou'd raiſe a Hundred and fifty, or Two hundred Pounds: But he ſtuck to his Text, and told me, He wou'd bate me nothing of that; and when the Time was expir'd that he had fix'd, if the Money did not come, I ſhou'd never have my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. I told him, I wou'd do my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to procure it for him when we came into Port, and had liberty to write to my Friends in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Captain did deſign to Cruize a Month longer, that he might take ſome Prize to make him amends for his laſt Diſappointment. He never importun'd me to forſake my Religion; being, if I
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0388001100:327"/>
had been as vile as the others, he wou'd not have had any hopes of my Money to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem me. We coaſted off the Shore of <hi>Africk</hi> a Fortnight or three Weeks, but met with no Prize; which enrag'd the Captain very much. One Day the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon</hi> dreſſing the Wound in my Head, ſlipt into my Hand a Letter, which he bid me Read cautiouſly, and give him an Anſwer the next Day. I had not an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for ſeveral Hours to Read the Contents; at laſt I counterfeited a ſudden Weakneſs, and retir'd to my Cabin, which was in the Place we call the <hi>Forecaſtle.</hi> When I laid my ſelf down, and found no one was near me, I open'd my Letter, and Read the Contents to this Effect:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>We whoſe Names are ſubſcrib'd to this, have reſolv'd upon a Stratagem for our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, there is ſeven of us, <hi>Engliſh,</hi> beſides your ſelf; and the Galley-Slaves are <hi>20</hi> in Number who have notice of the Project. One of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that has the Keys of the Galley-Slaves Chains is alſo one of our Number. Our Project muſt be put ſpeedily in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being they'll go into Harbour in Ten
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0388001100:328"/>
Days, and then it will be impoſſible to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. We will procure Arms, and give you farther Notice of the Hour. We muſt not ſeem to converſe together, neither muſt you take it ill if you find we give you ill Language now and then, it being only to inſinuate our ſelves into the good Eſteem of the <hi>Turks.</hi> When we have redeem'd the Slaves, we ſhall be Twenty-eight in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which will be a ſufficient Strength to Cope with the <hi>Turks,</hi> they being but Forty-one in all. We will convey Arms into your Cabin by the means of Mr. <hi>Matthews,</hi> and we doubt not but we ſhall effect our Liberty under God.</p>

After I had read it, I pray'd to God to Aid us in our Deſign. The next Day Mr. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews</hi> came to dreſs me as before; I gave him to underſtand that I had read, and conſider'd the Letter, and told him my Opinion was to execute it as faſt as ever we cou'd, for fear of any Accident that might happen: For, ſays I, it is not impoſſible but we may meet with one of their own Galleys, and then we ſhall find it to be a fruitleſs Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. Says he, we muſt wait a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time; for if we ſhou'd fail, we muſt expect the worſt of Torments. He went from me upon this, being ſome of the <hi>Turks</hi> came to look upon my Wound. The Captain ask'd him how my Hurts far'd? Ah! Dam him, ſays he, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Dog will do well enough I warrant him: So much the better, anſwer'd the Captain, for I am inform'd he is worth a great deal of Money, and I ſhall ſet his Ranſom at a higher Rate than what I firſt determin'd. All this Diſcourſe I heard, being upon Deck, talking with my three Companions that were taken with me, who treated me with ill Language, and call'd me Chriſtian Fool, that wou'd not turn
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0388001100:330"/>
               <hi>Mahometan,</hi> when I might have all the Liberty I deſir'd. One of them carry'd the Jeſt ſo far, that he gave me two or three good Strokes with his Hand; but the Captain ſeeing 'em, ſaid to 'em, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Let the Fool alone, 'tis not worth your while to foul your Fingers about him. I ſaid ſo much to 'em concerning <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> their Falſe Prophet, that if the <hi>Turks</hi> had underſtood me, I might have run the Danger of being murder'd. But generally the <hi>Rengado's,</hi> (that is, thoſe that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Chriſtian Faith, and turn <hi>Turks)</hi> have ſo little of any Religion in 'em, that they laugh at thoſe that have any at all. At Night Mr. <hi>Matthews</hi> told me in <hi>French</hi> very low, that the next Morning early was deſign'd for their Enterprize, being it was ſome Faſt-day with them, that they uſually at Four a Clock in the Morning riſe, and waſh themſelves all over, and pray to their Prophet for ſome time; and this being to be done below, they thought then wou'd be the right time. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly all that Night they ſpent ſecretly in preparing every thing. He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Slaves (which was <hi>Jenkins)</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0388001100:331"/>
found fought with 'em for ſomething, and chaſtiz'd 'em as uſual, but took the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to unlock 'em all, and order'd 'em to lie ſtill as if their Chains were faſt, till they had Command to do otherwiſe. Every thing ſucceeded to our Wiſhes, for the <hi>Turks</hi> got up to their Devotion ſooner than we expected, even before it was Light; and hudling down together, we clap'd down the Hatches, and ſecur'd the beſt part of 'em. The Captain, with two <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and one <hi>Frenchman,</hi> were ſeiz'd in the Cabin, and bound Hands and Feet; and this without any Noiſe. About Eight others that had not got up as early as the reſt, our Galley-Slaves ſeiz'd; and before we cou'd prevent 'em, had kill'd 'em all, and beg'd they might ſerve the Captain and the whole Crew in the ſame kind.</p>
            <p>The Buſtle the Slaves made in killing the Eight <hi>Turks,</hi> rouz'd the others below from their Prayers; and when they found they were ſhut down, they made a Noiſe; and knocking to be let out, which we did; but firſt we loaded a great Gun with Musket-ſhot, and turn'd the Muzzle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0388001100:332"/>
the Scuttle. Then as they came up, we Bound 'em; but being but few <hi>Engliſh,</hi> we cou'd not hinder the Slaves from kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſeveral of theſe too. At laſt we bound 'em all, being Twenty-five, there being kill'd by the Slaves ſixteen; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by the Conſent and Agreement of all, we chain'd twenty of 'em to the Oar in the room of thoſe we had releas'd; but they began to be very ſtubborn at firſt, but we put the Slaves to 'em, and they ſoon made 'em work, by giving 'em the ſame Uſage as they generally us'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from 'em.</p>
            <p>When we had ſecur'd 'em, we return'd God thanks for our happy Succeſs, and then conſulted which way we ſhou'd ſteer. We <hi>Engliſh</hi> agreed to go for <hi>England,</hi> but the Slaves we redeem'd, being moſtly <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> and <hi>Portugueze,</hi> were for going to <hi>Spain;</hi> in ſhort, there was no agreeing, for they being the greater Number, they pretended to have the Command over us, never conſidering 'twas to us they chiefly ow'd their Liberty. I muſt confeſs I was very much diſſatisfy'd at their Ingratitude, but cou'd not find any means to help our
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0388001100:333"/>
ſelves. Mr. <hi>Matthews</hi> ſpoke to 'em in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and laid before 'em the Benefit it wou'd be for 'em to go for <hi>England;</hi> but it was like Preaching to ſo many Beaſts, for they regarded him not, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to follow their firſt Deſign of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting their Courſe for <hi>Spain.</hi> When we found there was no Remedy, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd 'em to touch at <hi>Lisbon</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ſet us aſhore there; which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with much intreaty. If we had been of an equal Number, we wou'd have endeavour'd to have forc'd 'em with us for <hi>England,</hi> that they might have repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Ingratitude.</p>
            <p>They wou'd not let any of us have the Command of the Veſſel, but one <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſques</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> was choſen Captain, who immediately turn'd out Mr. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews,</hi> that we had given the Captain's Cabin to, and took Poſſeſſion of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This ſet us all a murmuring, and we conſulted to contrive ſome way to be even with 'em; but they were ſo watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and always upon their Guard, that it was to no purpoſe to plot any thing. They us'd to put Centinels upon us every
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0388001100:334"/>
time we went to Reſt. One Night we was awaken'd out of our Sleep by Orders from our new Captain <hi>Velaſques;</hi> when we were upon Deck, he told us there was a Ship diſcover'd to the Windward of us. Now my Reaſon of ſending for you, ſays the Captain, is, We deſign to Attack her, and make Prize of her, let her be of what Nation ſhe will, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> When Mr. <hi>Matthews</hi> had told us in <hi>Engliſh</hi> what he ſaid, my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation roſe that I cou'd hardly forbear ruſhing upon him, and tear his Throat out: But at laſt my Reaſon conquer'd my Paſſion, and I became calm. I bid Mr. <hi>Matthews</hi> let him know he cou'd not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect us to fight, if they were <hi>Engliſh,</hi> our Countrymen: But he ſwore we ſhou'd fight, or be kill'd, if they were our own Fathers. I bid Mr. <hi>Matthews</hi> tell him, As for my own part, I wou'd not fight a ſtroke, let it be what Nation it wou'd; and for his threatning to kill us, I did not know but it wou'd be better to die, than to Sociate with ſuch an ungrateful Crew as they were. The Ship now, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of keeping her Courſe, as ſhe did at
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0388001100:335"/>
firſt, made all the Sail ſhe cou'd, and bore down upon us, which they did not mind in our Diſputing. The Captain then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to change his Tone, and thought it the wiſeſt way to ſteer away before the Wind, and endeavour to get from 'em. Whereupon he crowded away, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labour'd the poor <hi>Turks</hi> with his Baſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do to Row with all their Strength, that I pity'd 'em. Looking towards the Ship that purſu'd us, we cou'd perceive <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours out, which rejoyc'd us <hi>Engliſh</hi> mightily. We now conſulted how we ſhou'd ſtop the Galley; for with Sailing and Rowing we went faſter than they. At laſt I reſolv'd to take a Piſtol, and ſhoot him through the Head, let the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence be what it wou'd. So I laid hold of one of the Piſtols unperceiv'd (they having prepar'd their Arms for their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,) goes up to <hi>Velaſques,</hi> and took him by the Throat with my Left-hand; and holding the Piſtol to his Breaſt with my Right, I threatn'd to ſhoot him Dead if he or his Men offer'd to ſtir. Several of his Companions were running to his Aſſiſtance, but were ſtop'd by Mr. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews,</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0388001100:336"/>
telling 'em, if they offer'd to ſtir, their Captain was a Dead Man. This Buſtle caus'd the <hi>Turks</hi> to lye upon their Oars, and in the mean tims Mr. <hi>Sloan</hi> brought the Gally to the Wind, and lay'd by, and the Ship got up with us in an Inſtant, and without hailing us, pour'd in a Broad-ſide upon us, which kill'd us two of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and five of our <hi>Spaniards,</hi> among which was that ungrateful Monſter <hi>Valaſques,</hi> and the wind of one of the Shot threw me down upon Deck without any farther hurt; we had no Colours up at all but the <hi>Vane</hi> upon the Top-maſt Head, which ſhew'd us to be a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Veſſel; I ſent up <hi>George Kirk</hi> to take down that, which prevented their Firing again; upon this they haled us: But after we told 'em we were <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> they ſent immediately two Boats well arm'd on Board us, and when we had ſatisfied 'em how it was with us, we ſeiz'd upon our vile <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> and bound 'em, we ſaw it was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man of War, and upon enquiry found it was the <hi>Ruby,</hi> Captain <hi>Walton</hi> Commander, bound after the Fleet for
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0388001100:337"/>
the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> They had met with Capt. <hi>Young</hi> and his Crew ſteering their Courſe for <hi>England,</hi> being they were ſo diſabled with the Engagement they had with the Gally of the <hi>Turks</hi> that we were in, they durſt not hold on their Way for the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> So the Stores were moſt of 'em put on Board the <hi>Ruby,</hi> and the reſt were to follow as ſoon as they cou'd Ship 'em in another Veſſel. Now there were two Men that were Paſſengers in Captain <hi>Young</hi>'s Ship, put on Board the <hi>Ruby</hi> to purſue their Voyage, and they ſeeing the Galley knew her to be the ſame that engag'd with Captain <hi>Young</hi> in the <hi>Tyger,</hi> and that was the reaſon they fir'd upon us without hailing, as is uſual in thoſe Caſes.</p>
            <p>I was very glad of an Opportunity to purſue my Voyage, I made my Addreſs to Captain <hi>Walton,</hi> who very friendly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me; while we were conſulting what we ſhou'd do about our Priſoners, the Galley ſeem'd to lye deeper in the Water, and going to examine her, found a Shot had pierc'd her between Wind and Water, but it was impoſſible to come to it to ſtop
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0388001100:338"/>
it; ſo we took what we cou'd out of her, and going to unlock the Galley-Slaves Chains, the Key was not to be found, and the Galley was ſinking every Minute, and before we cou'd break the Chains ſhe ſunk down right with the whole 20 poor unfortunate <hi>Turks,</hi> and all the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> (who being ty'd) cou'd not help themſelves, neither had we time to give 'em any Aſſiſtance. I muſt confeſs I was very much concerned to ſee ſo many poor unfortunate Creatures meet with Death, when it was in our Power ten Minutes before to have ſav'd 'em. Captain <hi>Walton</hi> was realy griev'd at it, and ſhow'd a Temper full of Humanity. We had juſt brought on Board the Captain, and two more <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> with the <hi>Frenchman, Renegado's.</hi> The Captain was ſo ſullen that he wou'd not eat or drink, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (as we ſuppos'd) to ſtarve himſelf to Death. Captain <hi>Walton</hi> us'd all gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle means poſſible to bring him into Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but to no purpoſe, for he wou'd not ſo much as give any anſwer to what he ask'd him, and in about a Week or eight Days after we took him on Board, he
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0388001100:339"/>
was found dead in his Hammock; one of the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> told us he had poiſon'd himſelf, for he always ſaid if he was ever taken by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> he wou'd make away with himſelf, to prevent the puniſhment he ſhou'd undergo. The other four <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> that were Inſtrumental in our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, were all <hi>Mahometans</hi> in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as I ſaid before, that is, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook their Chriſtianity in outward ſhow, but were realy Chriſtians in their Hearts, as was likewiſe my three Companions that were taken in the Boat with me, but as they told me they only did it to have ſome Opportunity of getting their Liberty, and the Words that were us'd, tho' it was in a Speech they did not underſtand, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſhock'd 'em in their utterance, and they all hop'd their Peace was made with God for their Crimes, with a ſincere Penitence from the moment they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Matthews</hi> the <hi>Surgeon, George Jenkins, William Aſhton,</hi> and <hi>Ralph Smallwood,</hi> were taken in a Ship call'd the <hi>Two Brothers</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> bound for <hi>Scanderoon,</hi> after an obſtinate Fight, where
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0388001100:340"/>
all were kill'd, excepting the abovementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd four, who were taken and ſold for Slaves, and continu'd ſo for ſome Years; but ſeizing on a Boat with the four <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> that did deſign to venture for their Liberty with 'em, they put to Sea, and rather choſe to truſt in the Waves, and an open Boat, than ſtay there to be Slaves for ever. But <hi>Hamet</hi> the Renegado, whoſe Chriſtian Name was <hi>Lewis Gordon,</hi> having notice of their flight, follow'd 'em with a ſwift Galley, and got ſight of 'em; Mr. <hi>Matthews</hi> (who relates the Story in this manner) and his Companions ſeeing it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to make their Eſcape, thought of a Stratagem for four of 'em to get the Good-will of the Renegado <hi>Hamet;</hi> which was this: Seeing no likelihood of getting clear off, the four <hi>Engliſh</hi> propos'd to the <hi>French</hi> to caſt Lots, and that ſhou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide which four ſhou'd be bound, and the other four ſhou'd immediately Row back, as if they had no deſign of running away, and make out their Story as well as they cou'd; accordingly we drew, and the Lots fell upon the four <hi>Frenchmen.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately we Bound 'em, and Row'd back, and were ſoon met by the Galley, where
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0388001100:341"/>
we made our Tale good, by telling the <hi>Turks,</hi> that going a Fiſhing with the four <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> they wou'd have compell'd us by force to have Row'd with 'em in their Boat for <hi>Spain;</hi> but we being not willing, fell to grappling with 'em, and overcame 'em by main force, ty'd 'em, and were bringing 'em back. The <hi>Frenchmen</hi> kept true to their Promiſe, and never contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted us in our Story. <hi>Hamet</hi> upon this became very civil to us, and put us in Truſt: He made me immediately Surgeon to the Galley, Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> Maſter of the Slaves, and our two other Companions had ſome little Office that pleas'd 'em. We went ſeveral Voyages with him, and took many Veſſels, but never met with any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship before the <hi>Tyger</hi> that we had the deſperate Engagement with. The four <hi>Frenchmen</hi> were made Slaves to Row in another Galley, which was taken about two Months ago by a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Man of War, and by that means got their Liberty.</p>
            <p>The other two <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> that were taken in the Cabin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd that they had been guilty of many Crimes, but more eſpecially in denying
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0388001100:342"/>
their Saviour; but they now felt in their Hearts and Minds, and Earning to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and beg'd that Captain <hi>Walton</hi> wou'd forgive 'em, and not take their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation for a Falſhood, being they were in ſome danger; but a true Light of the Divine Brightneſs. Captain <hi>Walton</hi> freely forgave 'em, and having a Chaplain in the Ship, we re-chriſten'd 'em; and the Fellows ſeem'd ever afterwards to have a true Senſe of their happy Condition. Captain <hi>Walton,</hi> and my ſelf, were God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers for 'em all. Therefore it behov'd us to ſee, that they were now inſtructed in their Faith; tho' theſe were of ſufficient Years to know their Duty without Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for 'em. We have many People that undergo that Office, but never conſider what their Duty is; and, in ſhort, make it nothing but an outward Ceremony, when if they thought of it, as they ought to do, they wou'd find it of the utmoſt Concern; for the true Office of Sureties, or Godfathers, &amp;c. are to train up the young Plant, till it is capable of bearing Fruit it ſelf of Good Works. But many now-a-days do as the Turtles do by their
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0388001100:343"/>
Eggs, lay 'em, cover 'em with Sand, and never more regard 'em.</p>
            <p>We came into our old Courſe again, and purſu'd it with ſucceſs: When we were got into the Latitude of the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick, we duck'd our Men as before; but there was a great Mutiny of the Sailors: The Captain had three Dogs on Board, and they wou'd have 'em duck'd as well as themſelves, unleſs he wou'd pay the uſual Rate; which being promis'd 'em, they were compos'd again, and the Sailors and Dogs were reconcil'd without going together by the Ears.</p>
            <p>We overtook an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel that had ſuffer'd much by an Engagement with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pyrate; ſhe had loſt all her Maſts, but had rais'd a Jury Main-Maſt, yet cou'd make but little way, by Reaſon of her Leaks. Our Captain ſent a Boat on Board, and gave 'em all the Aſſiſtance he cou'd; but finding it was but two Days ſince the Engagement, we had ſome hopes of coming up with her, being we learnt from the other Ship ſhe was mightily diſabled as well as themſelves. So we crowded all the Sails we cou'd; and tho' it was in the Night, we made the beſt of our way.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0388001100:344"/>
The Veſſel we left, ſaluted us with five Guns to take their Leave, which we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd with three; and in a quarter of an Hour afterwards heard ſeveral Guns fir'd now and then, as if ſome Veſſel was in diſtreſs, and in an Hour more diſcover'd a Light, which we made directly towards, and coming up with it, found it to be the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Veſſel that had engag'd with the other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship two Days before; the Light that they made was only a large Lanthorn fix'd on their main Top-Maſt Head, that we might the ſooner perceive 'em. We immediately hail'd 'em, and commanded 'em to ſurrender: They readily obey'd, and beg'd our Aſſiſtance, which they had great need of; for the Water gaining upon 'em every Moment in an Hours time, the Ship ſunk, but we had preſerv'd all the Men, being in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 23, having loſt in the Engagement with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship 27, and receiv'd ſeveral Shot between Wind and Water, which they did not perceive till they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd two Foot Water in the Hold, and found no hopes of being ſav'd from the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Enemy the Sea, if we had not fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0388001100:345"/>
for them came timely to their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. But to allay their Joy for their Deliverance from Death, they were made Priſoners, and being Pyrates (as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,) for there was no War declar'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Nations; therefore they might very probably think they were to be puniſh'd with Death when they came on ſhore.</p>
            <p>The Ship ſunk ſo faſt, that we cou'd ſave nothing but the Men, which took us up about four Hours, and then we purſu'd our Courſe, and about four in the Evening made the Iſland <hi>Barbados,</hi> where we ſet our <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Priſoners on ſhore. Captain <hi>Walton</hi> gave the Governor an Account of what had happen'd, and left it to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to do with 'em as he thought fit.</p>
            <p>On <hi>June</hi> the Twenty-third we ſet Sail for <hi>Dominio,</hi> where we arriv'd without any Accident. Here I went on ſhore along with ſeveral of our Men to get Wood and Water for our Ship. The Natives ſeem'd very civil, and came on Board us in their <hi>Canoes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Indians</hi> are moſt of 'em tall, luſty Men, well featur'd and well limb'd,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0388001100:346"/>
but poor Brains, for an ordinary Glaſs of Rum will make 'em drunk: They mightily like this Liquor, and will call for it as ſoon as ever they come on Board you: They wear no Cloaths, but a little Skirt about their Waſte; but moſt of 'em have Pieces of Braſs in the form of a Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarter Moon in their Noſe and Ears. I gave one of theſe <hi>Indians</hi> a pair of Breeches, and he made an Eſſay to put 'em on in this manner. He firſt put his two Arms into the Thighs of the Breeches, and deſir'd one of his Companions to but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton the Waſteband about his Neck; but when we ſhow'd him the right way, and he had put 'em on, he walk'd as if he had formerly worn Irons, and was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy with 'em that he pull'd 'em off, and made Signs to have ſome Linnen in exchange: In Return I gave him a long Cravat, and ty'd it properly about his Neck: But to ſee how the Fellow ſtrutted, one wou'd have taken him for one of the Captains of the Train'd-Bands, ready to march.</p>
            <p>I rambled with theſe <hi>Indians</hi> ſeveral Miles up in the Country, and ſaw their
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0388001100:347"/>
Hutts, that were dig'd about three Foot deep in the Earth, and then rais'd about ſix Foot high above the Surface, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Barks of Trees, and ſometimes divided into Apartments by a couple of long Poles, and Fathers, Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, lie promiſcuouſly together.</p>
            <p>The Day before we ſail'd, (after we had provided our ſelves with Wood and Water) I went up to the <hi>Indian</hi> Hutts to exchange a trifle or two for one of their Bows and Arrows; and returning towards the Ship, by my ſelf, loſt my way; and tho' I directed my Courſe (as I thought right) I came to that part of the Shore where was no Ship to be found; but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to go more Weſt along the <hi>Strand,</hi> my Way was intercepted by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral high pointed Rocks, which I made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral fruitleſs Eſſays to paſs. I then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to make a Compaſs within Land to get by the Rocks; which I did, but cou'd not find the Bay where the Ship rod. I was now in a deep perplexity, and tho' very much tyr'd, yet reſolv'd to look for the Track that wou'd
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0388001100:348"/>
carry me back to ſome of the Huts, where I might get an <hi>Indian</hi> to direct me; but there were ſo many various ones, that I knew not which to chuſe. At laſt I pitch'd upon one that brought me to ſeveral of 'em, but not thoſe from whence I came. I ſearch'd 'em, but cou'd find no <hi>Indians</hi> in 'em. I from thence walk'd a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but was ſurpriz'd with a Sight that ſhock'd me with Horror. Near the Skirt of a thick Wood I found one of our Men kill'd, with an Arrow in his Throat; and by the Poſture he lay in, I found it was done when he was eaſing Nature. The Object ſo overcame me, that I thought not my own unhappy Condition, till I was awak'd from my Stupidity by a Noiſe and Gabbling I heard in the Wood on my Right. This put me into a terrible Fright, which made me run as far from the Noiſe as I cou'd; for I made no doubt, that if they caught me, I ſhou'd run the ſame Fate with the poor, unfortunate Fellow, who perhaps might loſe his Life by his ſeeking me. When I had got a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Diſtance, I enter'd the Wood, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0388001100:349"/>
ventur'd to look out, where I cou'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (tho' it was almoſt dark) what they were doing.</p>
            <p>They cut off the poor Fellow's Head, and tore out his Bowels in a moſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Manner. Let any one judge what my Condition muſt be; I'm ſure my Thoughts were ſo confus'd, that I might juſtly ſay I never thought at all. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, when they had done, they carry'd him between Eight of 'em upon four Staves, and went towards their Tents. When they were gone, and I had leaſure for Reflection, every Thought was a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to me; but yet when my Senſes were compos'd, I put my Truſt in God that he wou'd deliver me from this Danger, as well as ſeveral other imminent ones, which through his Mercy I had overcome.</p>
            <p>I crept farther into the Wood to reſt my Limbs, but my Thoughts kept me waking all Night. When Day approach'd I went ſtill farther into the Wood, not only to avoid thoſe Barbarous <hi>Indians,</hi> but to ſee if, when on the other ſide, I cou'd find ſome Path that wou'd. lead me to the Bay where our Ship rode; but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0388001100:350"/>
before I cou'd get out of it I heard a <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> diſcharg'd, that both rejoyc'd and griev'd me; it joy'd me to know that the Ship cou'd not be far off, and griev'd me to think that it was certainly the Signal for the Boat to come on Board, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they might be that Moment under Sail. I ran with all the haſte I cou'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but with a Mind mix'd with Hope and Fear. I got out of the Wood at laſt, and directed my Courſe to that Part as I thought the Noiſe of the Gun came from, but cou'd find no Path; yet at laſt I got to the Top of a Rock from whence I cou'd behold the Sea, and the great Grief to ſee our Ship under Sail not half a League from the Shore. I immediately pull'd off my Shirt, and hung it to a Stick I had broke to ſupport me in my Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but my Signal did not do me any good, for they ſaw nothing of it. My Deſpair began to be predominant o're my Reaſon, and I had often reſolv'd to throw my ſelf down from the Rock to end my Miſery; but ſtill my Conſcience wou'd give me a ſecret Check; and at laſt I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd with my ſelf to ſubmit to whatever
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0388001100:351"/>
ſhou'd befall me, with a thorough Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Will of Heav'n. As ſoon as the Ship was out of ſight, I went down from the Rock (not having power to ſtir before) and endeavour'd to find ſome Food, but was prevented by a hideous Noiſe I heard, which drove me to ſhelter in the Wood again; but the farther I went, the plainer I heard the Noiſe, ſo that I knew not what to do; for at laſt it increas'd on every ſide: So that coming to a thick parcel of Shrubs, I laid my ſelf down, and couch'd ſo cloſe, that it was impoſſible for 'em to ſee me, unleſs they came into the very middle of it. I had thrown my Bow and Arrows away, as being of no uſe to me; but I had my Sword, which, however, I did not deſign to uſe. The Noiſe came ſo nigh me, that I cou'd hear the Tread of their Feet, and the Boughs ruſtle about me; but at laſt they went inſenſibly away, ſo that I heard no more of 'em for ſome time.</p>
            <p>When I found all was ſtill, I began to get up and look about me, where I ſaw 'em in the Plain engag'd with ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Indians,</hi> whom I thought I knew,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0388001100:352"/>
tho' at a good Diſtance. I ſaw ſeveral of 'em fall upon the Ground. At laſt thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> that went hollowing through the Wood ſeem'd to me to have the worſt of it, and were drove by the other Party quite back again; but did not purſue 'em any farther, only let fly their Arrows at 'em; and one of 'em came among the Shrubs where I lay, which ſtartled me, for I was afraid they wou'd come to look for their Arrows, and ſo find me. After the hurly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burly was over, I reſolv'd to go out of the Wood, and follow thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> that were Vanquiſhers, with this hope, That they might be of a milder Nature, and not ſo barbarous as the others who run through the Wood, who to my thinking had more ſtern Looks than thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> I had ſeen upon that part of the Iſland where we us'd to Land to get Wood and Water. So as I ſaid, I got up, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected my Courſe out of the Wood after the <hi>Indians,</hi> but ſoon diſcover'd two <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Men, and four Women coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, (which I ſuppoſe had hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves during the late Conflict:) It was to no purpoſe for me to fly, for they had got
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0388001100:353"/>
ſight of me; or if I had, they wou'd have ſoon ſent one of their winged Meſſengers after me; ſo I choſe boldly to meet 'em. When we were come within forty Paces one of another, one of the <hi>Indians</hi> was going to ſhoot at me, but was with-held by one of the Women: As ſoon as ever I came cloſe to 'em, they look'd upon me with ſtrange Geſtures, and diſtorted Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances; I put my Hand to my Head and Breaſt, which is the Token of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion with the <hi>Indians;</hi> and they let me know by Signs that I muſt go with them, which I did not deny; for if I had, I knew I ſhou'd be forc'd; ſo I went willingly enough. When we had got through the Wood, one of the <hi>Indian</hi> Men wou'd have my Coat and Waſtecoat of, which I durſt not refuſe: The Coat he put upon his Companion, and the Waſtecoat on himſelf, and ſtrutted ſtrangely. I gave my Handkerchief and Neckcloth to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hinder'd the <hi>Indian</hi> from ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at me, who receiv'd it with a great deal of Joy, and ſeem'd mightily pleas'd with me. When we arriv'd at their Hutts, there came out at leaſt a Hundred
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0388001100:354"/>
Frightful-looking <hi>Indians,</hi> who came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me, and had a great deal of Talk with thoſe that brought me with 'em; but the two <hi>Indians</hi> were forc'd to part with their Cloaths they had taken from me, to two of the oldeſt <hi>Indians,</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put 'em on, and ſeem'd mighty proud of themſelves. They gave me ſome Rice, and another ſort of Victuals boyl'd; but what it was compos'd of, I cou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learn, neither did I eat any of the ſame all the while I was among 'em. When Night came, I was ſent into a Hutt by my ſelf, and the Door ſhut upon me, I had a piece of Mat to lie on, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to cover me. Now I had leaſure to reflect upon my Misfortunes, which I cou'd not do before, by reaſon of the Fears I was in. I thought my Condition was now worſe than ever it was, for I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally believ'd they deſign'd to make a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of me, for I thought to my ſelf they were Cannibals, or Men-Eaters. I paſs'd the Night with a thouſand Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Inquietudes; but nevertheleſs my Senſes were ſo tyr'd, that I ſlept whether I wou'd or no; and in the Morning was
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0388001100:355"/>
awak'd by four of the Eldeſt <hi>Indians</hi> that came to viſit me, who made Signs to me to follow 'em, which I did without any heſitation; when I was out in the midſt of the plain Place before the Doors of their Hutts, they brought before me ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of their Women, and gave me to know by Signs that I ſhou'd take her to be my Mate, or Bedfellow, or ſuffer Death. I muſt confeſs I was mightily ſhock'd, but not giving my ſelf much time to weigh, or think of the Matter, I pitch'd upon her that I had given my Neckcloth and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief too, and immediately all the reſt were diſmiſs'd; and my Bride and I (for it was even ſo) were conducted to a Hutt, where there was ſeveral old <hi>Indians</hi> wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for me to compleat the Ceremony. When my Bride and I came before 'em, we were order'd to ſit down, then both our Feet were waſh'd with Water: After that they brought us a piece of their <hi>Indian</hi> Cake, or Bread, on which I was order'd to break off a piece, and give to my Bride. She then came and laid her Head on my Breaſt; and then, kneeling, put my Right Foot upon her Neck; when that was done,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0388001100:356"/>
ſhe roſe and went out, but immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, and brought me ſome Fleſh broil'd on the Coals, with which ſhe tore into Morſels, and put in my Mouth, and ſtood before me all the while I eat. I muſt confeſs I was ſo hungry, that I had a very good Appetite to my Victuals, being I had not eat any Fleſh for four Days: But I had no great Stomach to my Bride, although a young well-featur'd Woman, yet her Complexion did not like me. When I had done Eating, my Bride and I were put into a Hutt, and ſhut cloſe without any Light; but the old Proverb, <hi>Joan's as good as my Lady in the Dark,</hi> had like to have prov'd no Proverb to me. In the Morning we were wak'd with a rude Noiſe round our Tent, which ſtartled me at firſt; but I found afterwards it was a ſort of an <hi>Epithalamium.</hi> When they had made their frightful Noiſe for ſometime, they enter'd promiſcuouſly Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The Men came and took hold of me, and the Women of my new Spouſe, led us out with Shouts, unpleaſing Noiſes, and antick Geſtures: They continu'd it till we came to a River, and then we
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0388001100:357"/>
parted; the Men with me, and the Women with my Wife. They put me into the River, and waſh'd me all over, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Women did as much by my Tawny Rib. After they had given notice by their Shouts, that they had made an End of ſcowring me, they put on my Shirt and Drawers again, and led me to the Bank where my Spouſe waited for me with her She-attendance, and we return'd with the ſame Noiſe as we came out. When we came to the Hutts, the old <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> met us; the Old Men took me, and the Old Women my Wife, and gave us an Entertainment ſeperably, which laſted two Hours, according to my Computation; when they had made an End, they fetch'd us out of our different Tents, and ſeated us on a Bank, and then danc'd, and play'd ſuch mad, rude, monkey Gambols, that put me in mind of the mad Feaſts of the <hi>Bachii</hi> in <hi>Virgil,</hi> for they wou'd tear their Faces with their Nails, and ſcratch one another ſo violently, that one wou'd have thought they had been ſo many <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> and yet all in Mirth; for they wou'd laugh ſuch Horſe-laughs when ever
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0388001100:358"/>
any one of 'em was hurt, that quite ſtun'd me. When this ſport was over, the young <hi>Indians</hi> of both Sexes took my Bride and I into one of their Hutts, and gave us an Entertainment of Fiſh broil'd upon the Coals, and a pleaſant Liquor in a <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſh,</hi> that was exceeding ſtrong, which ſoon got into moſt of their Noddles; and as faſt as they grew a little Tipſie, they reel'd out one by one, and laid themſelves before the Door of the Hutt, and went to ſleep. My good Wife, among the reſt, got her Doſe too; but was ſo monſtrouſly loving withall, that I cou'd not tell well what to do with her. When Night came, we retir'd to our Reſt as before, and were wak'd next Morning by another kind of Noiſe that was made, with rude knocking at our Door, or rather Basket, for it was nothing elſe, and five or ſix of the old <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> came in with Hatchets, and other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to enable us to get Food for our ſelves, as I underſtood. My Wife took me out by the Arm, and carry'd me into the Wood with our Bows and Arrows, and by her Signs gave me to underſtand that ſhe wou'd bring me where I ſhou'd kill
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0388001100:359"/>
ſome Creature. At laſt we came to the Foot of a Hill, where we aſcended with ſome difficulty; but when we had gain'd the Summit, we diſcover'd vaſt Numbers, or Herds of Goats. My Spouſe ſhot, and kill'd one the firſt time; but I was ſuch a Bungler at it, that I cou'd never do any execution. But my Spouſe was very dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous, as all the <hi>Indians</hi> are in the Iſland of <hi>Dominico.</hi> My Wife ſeem'd to have a great Love for me, and wou'd always make much of me, her Way. When we had skin'd our Goat, we took out our Implements, and made a Fire to broil ſome of it. When it was ready, I gave my Creator thanks for providing for us poor inſignificant Mortals; and looking towards Heav'n, the Reſidence of him that form'd us all. My Wife fix'd her Eyes upon me, and then look'd upwards too, with a kind of Concern. After we had done, I return'd thanks again in the ſame manner as before, and my Wife did the ſame; that is, ſhe ſtar'd upwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as if ſhe had a mind to ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as ſhe thought I look'd at: And when ſhe found ſhe cou'd not ſee any thing,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0388001100:360"/>
ſhe came to me, and put her Arm ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly about my Neck, and with a ſort of a begging Tone, ſeem'd to ask me by Signs and Words, which I cou'd not underſtand, what I meant by looking upwards. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally griev'd to know that I cou'd not make her underſtand, for I cou'd not learn any of their Speech, but here and there a common Word; neither did I ever perceive they had any manner of Worſhip to any thing; otherwiſe if I wou'd have made her comprehend what I meant, I might have found it no hard Matter to have converted her from their abominable Heatheniſm; for ſhe was of a mighty mild Nature, very Loving and Courteous, and nothing like the reſt of the Savage Crew, who were prone to all manner of Wickedneſs. Her Voice too, differ'd from theirs, for moſt of the <hi>Indians</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd their Words in their Throat, as indeed you cou'd not well ſpeak 'em with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Gutteral Sound; yet ſhe, whatever was the meaning on't, ſpoke her Words a different Way from the reſt, and had a pleaſing Manner. I really began to love her, and only wiſh'd ſhe had been my
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0388001100:361"/>
Wife in the uſual Forms: She cou'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce any Word in Engliſh that I wou'd ſay to her, but I cou'd never get her to repeat whole Sentences; and all ſhe did was like a Parrot. After we had done our hunting-work, I was for going over the Hill to view the Country, and walk'd up and down a good way; but I obſerv'd my Wife was very uneaſy, but eſpecially when I got to the Brow of the Hill. On the other ſide (which was about half a League over) I made an Eſſay to go down; ſhe laid hold of my Arms, and pull'd me back with all her force, and with many ſupplicating Actions ſeem'd to beg of me not to go; and when ſhe found I was offering at it again, ſhe ſcreem'd out ſo diſmally, that it frighted me from making any more attempts. I endeavour'd to know what ſhe meant, but cou'd gather nothing from her Words and Actions that cou'd let me into any thing: But ſhe wou'd often handle her Bow and Arrows, and with menacing Actions let me know there was ſome Danger. As we went homeward this odd Accident ran very much in my Head, and I was mighty
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0388001100:362"/>
deſirous to find out the meaning of it; and every time I went to hunt there with my Wife, I wanted ſadly to get down the Hill on the other ſide. This Hill was of a vaſt Length, and extended from Eaſt to South-Weſt, almoſt a-croſs the Iſland. I did not know how to contrive it, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hunting, I made believe I was very much tyr'd, and laid my ſelf down in order to ſleep; and my Wife with her uſual good humour, accompany'd me, and in a very little time I found ſhe was in a ſound Sleep. I immediately roſe, and ſtole away ſoftly upon my intended Journey. I got away from my Wife without her awaking, and came to the Brow of the Hill, which I ſurvey'd, and found no difficulty in the deſcending. When I had got to the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Hill, I was mightily pleas'd with the Evenneſs of the Ground, and the Proſpect round me, which I cou'd compare to nothing but the Vale of <hi>Eſham</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> bating the Houſes and Towns in't. I had walk'd up and down the Vale for near an Hour, and was preparing to go back the ſame way I came. When looking back to take my laſt Survey, I
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0388001100:363"/>
ſaw a Smoak at a Diſtance, and it ran in my Mind it was the very place that our Men us'd to go to, from on Board, to truck with the Inhabitants. The Thought took up ſome of my Time; and I believe, if it had not been for a tender Regard for my Wife, I had certainly directed my Courſe for that Smoak I ſaw there. But I muſt confeſs I cou'd not think of leaving her behind me, but Curioſity put it into my Head to go a little nearer that Smoak I had diſcover'd: But juſt as I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that way, I heard a dreadful Scream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind me; and turning about, I ſaw my Wife upon the Brow of the Hill, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the moſt pitiful Lamentation imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. The tender Regard I now began to have for my Wife, made me make all the haſte I cou'd to her Relief, as thinking ſome Miſchance might have befell her. When I came to the Bottom of the Hill, I ſaw ſeveral of the <hi>Indians</hi> of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood waiting for me above, and ſome were coming down. As ſoon as I had got to the Top of the Hill, I was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſeiz'd by the <hi>Indians</hi> above, and drag'd along as if I had been the greateſt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0388001100:364"/>
Criminal imaginable, and my poor Wife hanging upon my Arm all drown'd in Tears. I cou'd not imagin what was the Matter, and what cou'd be the Reaſon of their uſing me in that manner. I found it muſt be ſomething extraordinary by the Grief of my Wife, whoſe Sorrow increas'd the farther I went towards our Hutts; but e're we cou'd get there, it rain'd and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd ſo violently, that we were well waſh'd before we came to our Journey's End, when we were within ken of our Hutts; the whole Tribe came near us, ſome skipping and dancing, as mightily rejoyc'd; others with the Face of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and hanging their Heads in ſign of Sorrow, and mightily lamented over my Wife. After the old <hi>Indians</hi> had conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome time, they ty'd me to a wither'd Tree that ſtood at the Mouth of the Hutts; then I began to underſtand what they meant, for I cou'd perceive they were bringing Boughs of green Wood, in order to burn me. This Sight made my Courage fail me, and it was impoſſible to expreſs my Deſpair and Horror. I found now that the laſt Day of my Life was
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0388001100:365"/>
come, (for it was impoſſible to foreſee any thing to the contrary.) My laſt Recourſe was to the Maker and Giver of all good Things, for I had try'd all other Means in vain; as alſo had my poor Wife, whoſe Rage and Deſpair overcame her; and ſhe was carry'd away by the Women in the utmoſt Agony. After my Wife was gone, they ſet fire to the Wood which enclos'd me; which being green and wet with the late Rain, was a great while in Burning; all the while it was kindling, ſome of the <hi>Indians</hi> jump'd round me, and danc'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their barbarous manner, while others ſtood ready with their Bows and Arrows to ſhoot at me (as I ſuppos'd) if the Fire ſhou'd burn the Bands that ty'd me, and I ſhou'd offer to run away. The Wood being green (as I ſaid before) was very ſtubborn in kindling, which made the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion more dreadful: I made ſeveral Eſſays to break the Bands that held me, but all my Efforts were but in vain; and I obſerv'd every Time I made my fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Endeavours, the barbarous Crew ſhouted and laugh'd for joy. The Fire encreaſing, I pray'd to Almighty God to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0388001100:366"/>
give me Strength to bear the horrid Pain I was going to ſuffer; and, if it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to go out of the World with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Fortitude of a good Chriſtian, who was only going to change this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Life for a better. I compar'd my ſelf to a wounded Perſon, that muſt bear probing of his Hurts, in order to cure 'em. I now had given my ſelf up entirely to my Thoughts of the other World; and this ſeem'd to me like aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning a barren Iſland, in order to go to one where was plenty of every thing. But before the Fire reach'd me, there fell ſuch a prodigious Showre of Rain, mix'd with Thunder and Lightning, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd the Fire. The Storm laſted for ſeveral Hours with the utmoſt Violence, and I remain'd ſtill ty'd to the Tree. When the Storm was over, they began to renew their Fire, and brought the Wood nearer than before, it being at firſt half a Yard from my Body all round; but now they pil'd it cloſe to me, that the Fire might the ſooner be my Executioner, which I wiſh'd for, as knowing it wou'd put me to a ſpeedier Death. But before
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0388001100:367"/>
they had well plac'd the Wood, they heard Shouts and Noiſes in the adjacent Woods; upon which the <hi>Indians</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ran away from me, and took to their Arms in an Inſtant, old and young. The Noiſe came nearer, and nearer ſtill, till at laſt I cou'd perceive ſeveral <hi>Indians</hi> bolt out of the Wood, who were met by our <hi>Indians,</hi> and a bloody Fight enſu'd. The Enemy <hi>Indians</hi> ſeem'd to have the beſt on't, by reaſon of ſome Fire-Arms that they had, with which they made ſtrange havock with our <hi>Indians;</hi> the Battle conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd for ſome Hours with a great deal of Heat, and many of our <hi>Indians</hi> fell. At laſt the Enemy <hi>Indians</hi> drove ours, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Hutts, and I cou'd only hear the Noiſe they made, being I was ſtill faſtned to the Tree. The Fight continu'd out of ſight about half an Hour, when my Wife came running with all the Tranſports of Joy imaginable; and after having put her Head under my Feet, ſhe unty'd me, and fell upon me with all the Signs of a ſincere Love. I muſt confeſs I was mightily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyc'd to ſee my ſelf at Liberty, and let what wou'd happen, my Condition cou'd
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0388001100:368"/>
not be worſe than it was ſome Hours ago. I cou'd not forbear expreſſing my Love to my Wife by Kiſſes and Embraces. We went to our Hutt, and I took my Sword that had been laid up from my firſt being amongſt 'em. I was going out of my Tent in order to go with my Wife to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Iſland, that was not known to theſe <hi>Indians:</hi> But juſt as we came among the Tents, three <hi>Indians</hi> met us that had run way from the Fight (as I conjectur'd:) As ſoon as they ſaw me and my Wife, they came up with a great deal of ill Nature in their Countenances; and after ſome Talk with my Wife, one of 'em with his wooden Sword, went to make a Blow at me; but my Wife inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, receiv'd the Blow upon her Head, which ſtruck her to the Ground, bloody and ſenſeleſs. My Rage roſe ſo high up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, that I cou'd not contain my ſelf; but I drew my Sword, and thruſt it up to the Hilt in the Wretches Body; the other two ſeeing their Companion's Death, ran upon me with the Rage of Lyons; but I ſlipping on one ſide, avoided the Strokes intended me: They turn'd immediately
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0388001100:369"/>
upon me, and let drive at me ſeveral Blows, which had the good Fortune not to hit me; but I run one of 'em into the Throat with my Sword; upon which he ſet up ſuch a Cry that frightned me, and ran away, and was immediately follow'd by the other. I then ran to the Aſſiſtance of my Wife, who lay almoſt ſtrangled in her own Blood. I rais'd her from the Earth, and ſeated her under the Tree where I was ty'd, and brought her to her ſelf a little; but I found her Skull was crack'd with the Blow the <hi>Indian</hi> gave her, and to my great Grief perceiv'd ſhe was juſt expiring. But the Sorrow and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to part with me, (as I judg'd by her Actions) ſtruck me to the Soul. She laid one Arm about my Waſte, and her Head in my Lap, but with ſuch piteous Looks with her Eyes that almoſt diſtracted me. She made Signs to me to look upward (as I fancy'd) to pray for her, tho' I cou'd not tell for certain what ſhe meant; but ſhe pronounc'd ſeveral Words with Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and Paſſion; and I really fancy'd, if we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0388001100:370"/>
ſome Notions of a ſupreme Being. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe expir'd, the Enemy <hi>Indians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with all of our <hi>Indian</hi> Priſoners, I mean all that they had not kill'd; for out of Two Hundred <hi>Indians</hi> of our Party, there was not above Twenty-two left. They were mightily ſurpriz'd to find me, for many of the Enemy <hi>Indians</hi> knew me; and when I came to examine their Faces, I remember'd they were the <hi>Indians</hi> that inhabited about the Bay where our Ship lay. One or two of 'em cou'd ſpeak a little Engliſh, that they learn'd by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that uſually An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor'd in the Bay. One of 'em knew my Name, that he had gather'd from our Sailors enquiring for me, when ſent by the Captain before the Ship ſail'd. Maſter <hi>Falconer,</hi> ſays he, me glad to ſee you, White Men belong to great Ships; come look, for you very Great, and not look you here go away much ſorry. My Wife took up all my Thoughts, who was juſt dying; and though her Strength and Speech fail'd her, yet ſhe endeavour'd to pull down my Face to hers, which ſhe kiſs'd; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n ſunk her Head into my Boſom, and expir'd.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0388001100:371"/>
I was really as much concern'd, as if I had marry'd one of my own Complexion and Country; for I had great Hopes, if ever I cou'd have made my Eſcape with her, and cou'd but have taught her Engliſh, to have made her a good Chriſtian. With the Aſſiſtance of my now friendly <hi>Indians</hi> I laid her in the Earth: They told me ſhe was Daughter to one of the Chief of their Enemy-Tribe. From theſe <hi>Indians</hi> I learn'd, that thoſe I had fell amongſt were a Tribe of <hi>Indians</hi> that had liv'd on this ſide the Ridge of Mountains for many Years, and declar'd open War with thoſe of the other ſide for holding Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with <hi>Whites;</hi> and were ſo ſtrict, that they put all <hi>Indians</hi> to Death that ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted ſingly to go over the Mountains, which was the Reaſon of my Danger of Burning. The Women that they took, (all that were with Child) were ſhot to Death, and the Men in general ran the ſame Fate; for they were reſolv'd not to have any one of the Breed alive. When they had plunder'd the Hutts, they went through the Woods, and over the Mountain again, and ſo to their own
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0388001100:372"/>
Hutts, which I knew. The Old Men, and Women met 'em, ſkipping and dance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Joy of their Succeſs, and ſome Mourning for the Loſs of a Husband, Brother, or Father that was ſlain in Battle. Theſe friendly <hi>Indians</hi> were often plagu'd with their ſudden ruſhing upon them, and deſtroying many of them, till at laſt they took up a reſolution to Aſſault them, and if poſſible to extirpate the whole Race; and they had often made Inroads upon 'em, which leſſen'd their Number till this laſt ended 'em, as I ſaid before. The Women and Female Children dwelt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly among 'em, being they had no where to go. I began to live comfortably among theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> and us'd to partake of their Diverſion and Labour; as, Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Fiſhing, &amp;c. Theſe <hi>Indians</hi> were ſo expert in Shooting with their Bows and Arrows, that I have ſeen 'em hit the Mark Three Hundred Yards, within the compaſs of a half Crown.</p>
            <p>This Iſland of <hi>Dominico</hi> took its Name from its being diſcover'd on a <hi>Sunday.</hi> It is computed to be in length about thirty Leagues, and about twenty-eight in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0388001100:373"/>
breadth. It is very mountainous, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the North-Eaſt. I have heard there are ſome <hi>French</hi> Settlements upon the Iſland; but I enquir'd of the above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd <hi>Indian,</hi> who aſſur'd me there was not any Inhabitants but Natives, and of thoſe not above a Hundred Families, who were moſtly ſeated near that Part that compos'd the Harbour. Says the <hi>Indian</hi> that I us'd to talk with, there be ſome indeed a great way off in <hi>de Iſland,</hi> dat are our Fathers and Mothers; and ſome of our Wives dat when de die, we throw into de Sea, and de ſwim to dat place; and when we die, we ſwim dere too. By this we might perceive they had ſome Notion of the Immortality of the Soul. I did my Endeavour to make him ſenſible of the Joys of Heaven, and Pains of Hell, but to no purpoſe. I told him of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Being that commanded all things below, and that Righteous People dwelt with him after this Life. He ask'd where my God live? His Throne is in Heaven, anſwer'd I, pointing upward, where He ſits to Judge the Quick and Dead. He
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0388001100:374"/>
live up dare, high; how you get up high, no ſteps reach dare. It is our Immortal Part, added I, that aſcends, our Soul, which is cloath'd with the Grace of our Divine Creator, and enjoys an Eternity of Bleſſings. You be de <hi>White Man,</hi> you have Soul; we be no <hi>White,</hi> we have no Soul; when we die, we fling in Water, big Fiſh come carry us to an oder place, den we live dare and die agen, and Fiſh bring us upon back to an oder place. How are you aſſur'd of this (ſays I?) Have you ever ſeen any that have been tranſported in the manner you tell me of? No (anſwer'd he) but me ſure it be ſo. But when we were carry'd by Fiſh to dat oder place, we eat de Leaf of Tree, dat we can no remember what we do in toter place, dat we be bring from. All the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I cou'd uſe was of no Effect; for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm was ſo rooted in him, and all the other <hi>Indians,</hi> that it will be the greateſt Difficulty imaginable to bring 'em to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſtianity. Their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are ſo infirm, that without a Miracle there will be no curing 'em. The <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0388001100:375"/>
wou'd have had me marry'd into one of their Tribe; and I, fearful to deny 'em, brought my ſelf off by telling no <hi>White</hi> cou'd marry under twelve Moons after their Wive's Death; with which they ſeem'd ſatisfy'd, but made me Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe when that time was expir'd to change my Condition of Widower to that of Marry'd Man. I might have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated with a She-Companion if I had found any Inclination, but I evaded it as well as I could.</p>
            <p>The Soil of the Iſland is very fruitful, and there's plenty of every thing.</p>
            <p>I could not perceive that theſe <hi>Indians</hi> worſhip'd any thing, except the Moon: Which when at full, they would all ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together; and looking upward, ſtand gazing a conſiderable time, and then with one Conſent pronounce a word which ſounded like <hi>Hiu!</hi> This word they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally repeated three times. When they had done <hi>Stargazing,</hi> they would fall to Jumping and Capering like ſo many mad things. When that was over, they would retire to their ſeveral Hutts, and not ſtir out till Morning upon any account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0388001100:376"/>
I ask'd <hi>Will</hi> (for that was the Name of him that could ſpeak Engliſh, who was mighty proud to be call'd ſo) what Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was it they perform'd after they were retir'd into their Hutts? But he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, <hi>Me no tell dat, Wife make much Noiſe, ſhe no care for dat; when you have new Wife, you know what we do, but me no tell till den.</hi> What gave me a Curioſity to know, was, that <hi>Will</hi> told me that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Ceremony was over, I muſt not offer to come out of my Hutt, nor come a nigh any of theirs; for if I did, they would kill me. The Hutt that was built for me, was order'd in another manner than their own, with a high Door made of Wicket; there's being ſo low, that an ordinary ſiz'd Man muſt have ſtoop'd to go in or out.</p>
            <p>I us'd to go fiſh in their <hi>Canoes</hi> with 'em, where they would catch good ſtore; and let it be what it would, the Cargo was divided among the whole Tribe, only he that caught 'em choſe firſt.</p>
            <p>I told <hi>Will,</hi> that as ſoon as ever a Ship arriv'd there, I did deſign to imbark in her in order to purſue my Voyage: But he
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0388001100:377"/>
told me I muſt take care not to let any other of the <hi>Indians</hi> know it, for they would never ſuffer any one to go from 'em, after they had been once ſettled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong 'em. How do you know that, ſays I? Have you had any Talk with 'em con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me? He told me he had not, but it was their way: For he gave me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that about ſix Years ago there was four Men left on ſhore upon their Iſland, by reaſon of their Veſſel driving out to Sea by a Hurricano; and theſe four Men ſettled among 'em, and marry'd <hi>Indian</hi> Wives, and had Children by 'em. But at any time when a Ship came into the Bay, they were hurry'd a great way up in the Country, and detain'd there till the Ships were gone, and then liv'd with 'em as before. But a ſmall Veſſel put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in there by Night, the Engliſh-Men ſpy'd it before any of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and were got to the Shore ſide, converſing with the Crew of the Veſſel before the <hi>Indians</hi> found 'em out. But when they ſaw 'em talking together, they were mightily enrag'd. The four Men went on Board the Veſſel to make merry with
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0388001100:378"/>
their Countrymen, and afterwards came on ſhore again, and made it no Secret, that they deſign'd to go on Board that Veſſel in order to go to their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The <hi>Indians</hi> took no notice for the preſent: But the Day they deſign'd to imbark, they ſet upon the Veſſel with their <hi>Canoes,</hi> and kill'd every Perſon on Board it. When they had done that, they took as many things out of her as they had occaſion for, and ſet her a-drift. He told me that the four <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> were the firſt that taught 'em to uſe Fire-Arms, and in the Ship they took, they had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Muskets and Quantities of Powder and Shot. But carrying the Powder to their Hutts, a Boy met 'em ſmoaking in a Cane, they call a Smoaking Cane, and by ſome Accident the Fire caught hold of the Powder, and blew it up, with the Death of Eight <hi>Indians,</hi> and wounding ſeveral others. After they had brought every thing up to their Hutts, they took the Wives of the four Sailors (the <hi>Indians</hi> with their Children) and ſhot 'em to Death with Arrows. This is the Senſe of the Story <hi>Indian Will</hi> told me, which
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0388001100:379"/>
was pretty hard to pick out too, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his manner of telling it. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation made me very uneaſy, yet put me upon thinking to make my Eſcape the firſt Opportunity. I waited a full Month before I could ſee any Veſſel, but at laſt one came into the Harbour. I perceiv'd they came in order to get Wood by hoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their long Boat; but as I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving 'em, I was ſeiz'd by ſeveral <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and carry'd at leaſt ſix Miles up in the Country, in order to be ſecur'd till the Ship ſhould be gone. I began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair now of ever getting away, being it was natural to ſuppoſe, that they would be more watchful over me for the future. Beſides, I did not know but they would uſe me after another manner, and not let me have ſo much Liberty as I had before. I wanted for nothing in my Confinement, and was only guarded by four <hi>Indians</hi> that went to ſleep when I did. I once thought I might make my Eſcape whilſt they ſlept; but afterwards repented that Thought, in knowing if they ſhould chance to wake, I was certainly a dead Man; for <hi>Indian Will</hi> told me, as I was carrying away, that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0388001100:380"/>
the <hi>Indians</hi> had Orders to ſhoot me if I offer'd to make my Eſcape: Beſides, I ſhould have found it difficult enough to have known my way, eſpecially in the Dark; for they carry'd me to a place that I had never been at before. I had been here four Days, and had given over all Hopes of my Liberty, and began to call together my ſcatter'd Thoughts, that were fluſter'd upon that Occaſion; when, on the fourth Day, about Noon, I was agreeably ſurpriz'd with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Voices, I began to prick up my Ears, and wiſh'd they might come to the place where I was. I was not long in expecting of 'em; for one of 'em ſpying the Hutt, where I was, call'd out to the others to come along; for here's an <hi>Indian</hi>'s Hutt, ſays he, we'll go in it, and ſee what they'll give us. With that they immediately came in before two of my <hi>Indians</hi> could hide me, (the other two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone in the Morning to the Village:) As ſoon as ever I ſaw 'em, tho' Strangers, I could not forbear ſhowing my Tranſports at the ſight of my Countrymen. They were mightily ſurpriz'd to ſee me; and when I told 'em my Condition, they ſaid
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0388001100:381"/>
they would have me along with 'em in ſpight of their Teeth: But I told 'em that was very dangerous; for if theſe <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould raiſe the Village (that lay within a Mile of the Shore) we ſhould all loſe our Lives. Some advis'd to knock 'em on the Head; but I could not agree to that, for theſe were <hi>Indians</hi> that never injur'd me. Two of my Countrymen had got a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Spaw-water Flasks fill'd with Rum, upon the ſight of which a Thought came into my Head, that ſeem'd the moſt likely to compaſs my Deſign. I told my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen if we could make the <hi>Indians</hi> drunk, there might be ſome hopes of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off without either hurting them, or endangering our ſelves. We drank to one another, and the <hi>Indians</hi> did us Reaſon in pledging us; for I believe out of the two Flasks they drank one and three quarters. It ſoon began to work with them, and they got up and fell a Dancing moſt mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and a while after drop'd down dead Drunk. We reſolv'd to tye 'em Hands and Feet, that if they awak'd, they might not follow us, and raiſe the whole Body of <hi>Indians</hi> upon us. With the help of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0388001100:382"/>
our Garters we ty'd 'em faſt enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waking 'em, and made the beſt of our way towards the Sea-ſide. All the Danger we ran was in meeting with any of the other <hi>Indians,</hi> but we happily avoided 'em, and came to the place where the Boat lay. The Ship was ready to Sail, having got their Wood and Water aboard; and theſe eight Men were thoſe that had been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring hard in cutting Wood, &amp;c. and ſo were reſolv'd to go up the Country to view it, never having been farther than the place where they fell'd the Trees, and happily for me came to give me my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, under Providence. As we were getting into the Boat to go on Board (the Ship having made a Waft in her Ancient,) <hi>Indian Will</hi> came running down almoſt out of Breath, and cry'd, Get quick in Ship, they come down preſently kill all me go wid you de kill me elſe for tell you. We hurry'd away, and <hi>Indian Will</hi> with us, and got on Board in very good time; for before we were well under Sail, we could perceive at leaſt Two Hundred <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> bringing their <hi>Canoes</hi> with 'em. We had a brisk Gale, ſo that they could not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0388001100:383"/>
well overtake us; for they never go above two Leagues from ſhore. Nevertheleſs they put their <hi>Canoes</hi> in the Water, and began to paddle after us. The Captain was for Firing at 'em with our great Guns, but I perſwaded him againſt it, by telling him it might be worſe for other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels that ſhould come after us; and as they could not overtake us to do us any damage, it was beſt not to take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of 'em. When we had loſt ſight of <hi>Dominico,</hi> I ask'd <hi>Indian Will</hi> the Reaſon of their endeavouring to detain all <hi>Whites</hi> in that clandeſtine Manner; and he gave me to know, that they fear'd if the <hi>Whites</hi> ſhould know the Smallneſs of their Number, that they would put 'em all to Death, and ſeize upon the whole Iſland. The Ship that took us up was call'd the <hi>Twins</hi> from <hi>Caroline,</hi> Captain <hi>Fuller</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; ſhe came then from <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and was bound for <hi>Jamaica.</hi> I took <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Will</hi> as my Servant, and did deſign to give him ſome Cloaths, as ſoon as we arriv'd at <hi>Jamaica;</hi> but for the preſent I had none for my ſelf, and made but an odd ſort of a Figure. My Beard was
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0388001100:384"/>
pretty long, and being ſomething incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Red, look'd but oddly: My Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was all gone, ſo that my whole Dreſs conſiſted of a Hat, a Waſtecoat, a pair of Breeches, and a pair of Shooes. The Captain was ſo kind to lend me a Shirt, and a pair of Stockings, and I got my Beard off, and once more look'd like a Chriſtian. We made <hi>Jamaica</hi> without meeting with any thing material, and found the Fleet at Anchor. I went on Board the Admiral, and paid my Reſpects to him. which he took very kindly. I there once more met with my Friend Mr. <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> and the reſt of my Companions who had given me over for loſt; for Captain <hi>Walton</hi> told the Admiral and my Comrades, that I was certainly Murther'd by the <hi>Indians.</hi> I had all my Things reſtor'd me, that were brought in the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bion</hi> Frigate, that arriv'd about a Week before me with the Stores of the Fleet, after ſhe had been in the Dock at <hi>Plimouth</hi> and well mended. She alſo brought News of War being declared between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and the Death of his Sacred Majeſty King <hi>William</hi> the Third, of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0388001100:385"/>
Memory, and the Coronation of her Majeſty Queen <hi>Anne. July</hi> the 11<hi>th</hi> 1702, The whole Fleet ſet out from <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> in order for a Deſcent upon St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> as was ſuppos'd, but things not anſwering, the Admiral, in the <hi>Breda</hi> Captain <hi>Fog,</hi> with ſix other Men of War, <hi>viz. Defiance,</hi> Captain <hi>Kirby; Greenwich,</hi> Captain <hi>Wade; Windſor,</hi> Captain <hi>Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Ruby,</hi> Captain <hi>Walton; Falmouth,</hi> Captain <hi>Vincent;</hi> and <hi>Pendennis,</hi> Captain <hi>Hudſon,</hi> in queſt of Monſieur <hi>du Caſſe,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Commodore, that was deſign'd for <hi>America</hi> with Ammunition, Forces, Proviſion, and Money to pay the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, beſides ſeveral Governors to be put in the room of others that were call'd back. We directed our Courſe to Port <hi>Leogaon,</hi> where <hi>du Caſſe</hi> was expected every Day: But when we came there we were inform'd that <hi>du Caſſe</hi> was Sail'd for <hi>Carthagena,</hi> upon which we directed our Courſe for that place, after having taken three Ships, one of Sixteen, another of Thirty, call'd <hi>Reine de Angelos,</hi> or the Queen of Angels, and another of Six Guns richly Laden, beſide three Barks
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0388001100:386"/>
taken by Captain <hi>Conſtable,</hi> in the <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> and a fourth Sunk, likewiſe a <hi>French</hi> Man of War of Forty Guns burnt.</p>
            <p>On the 19<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> O. S. about 10 in the Morning, we diſcover'd Ten Sail to the Eaſtward of us, which we bore up to, and found 'em to be the Fleet we were in queſt of; tho' there was Ten Sail, yet there was but Six Fighting Ships, the reſt were Store-Ships which made the beſt of their Way; ſo when the Admiral came up with 'em we had but Six to Engage. The Line of Battle was form'd about three in the Afternoon, The <hi>Defiance</hi> led the Van, the <hi>Windſor</hi> ſecond, and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> in the <hi>Breda</hi> the third. Theſe three kept pretty cloſe together, but the other four were a League behind. At four in the Afternoon we began the Engagement, but the <hi>Defiance</hi> after firing three Guns bore away to Leeward and lay there out of Gun-ſhot all the Evening, ſo that the whole ſtrength of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet lay upon the Admiral and the <hi>Windſor</hi> till it was Dark. In the Night the <hi>Windſor</hi> fell foul of our Ship, which ſtartled a great many, that were not upon Deck, as believing it
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0388001100:387"/>
might be a <hi>French</hi> Fireſhip, tho' we knew they had not one in the Fleet: But Fear, as well as Paſſion, blends our Reaſon. The Wind chop'd about in the Night, ſo that we had the Weather-gage of 'em; upon which we bore down upon 'em, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd for three Hours; but the <hi>Ruby,</hi> Captain <hi>Walton,</hi> was diſabl'd, and order'd by the Admiral to make for <hi>Port-Royal.</hi> My Man <hi>Indian Will,</hi> who was on Board, dreſs'd like an <hi>European,</hi> was terribly frighted with the Noiſe of our Guns; and every time he ſaw the Flaſh of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Cannon, he wou'd ſquat down upon the Deck, and lye flat upon his Belly for ſome time; one of our Men that was ſhot in the Guts lay expiring, and <hi>Indian Will</hi> was getting away out of Danger, he ſaid, but unfortunately ſtumbled over the Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man, who in the Pangs of Death graſp'd <hi>Will</hi> ſo faſt, that he cry'd out luſtily for Help, but it was more than I could do to unclench his Hand till he was quite Dead, and then we releas'd poor <hi>Will,</hi> frighted out of his Wits, who could not be prevail'd upon to come upon Deck any more till we told him we had done
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0388001100:388"/>
Fighting. We took one Ship from the <hi>French,</hi> that they had taken from the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> in their Voyage. The Fight laſted ſix Days, on and off; but the Admiral being wounded in the Thigh, and finding that, <hi>Wade, Kirby,</hi> and <hi>Hudſon,</hi> did not care for Fighting, we left 'em, after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling two of their Ships, and directed our Courſe back to <hi>Portugal.</hi> As ſoon as we arriv'd there, the Admiral ſent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to confine Captain <hi>Conſtable, Wade, Kirby,</hi> and <hi>Hudſon,</hi> and Summon'd a Court-Marſhal, Try'd 'em, and found 'em Guilty of Cowardice, excluding <hi>Conſtable;</hi> and accordingly the other Three were ſent to <hi>England</hi> to receive Sentence of Death, which was executed upon Two of 'em. The Third, Captain <hi>Hudſon</hi> dy'd in the Voyage, and ſo prevented an Ignominious Death. How eaſy had it been for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to have taken the <hi>French,</hi> if they had been unanimous; but ſuch an Inſtance of Puſillanimity is not to be found in the Records of the Navy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> the 14<hi>th,</hi> 1702, We were all concern'd with the News of Admiral <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi>'s Death, who dy'd of the Wound in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0388001100:389"/>
his Thigh that he receiv'd in the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Monſieur <hi>du Caſſe,</hi> lamented by all. I obſerv'd there was a perfect Groan in every Ship in the Fleet, when the Admiral's Flag was Lor'd with a Whiff, which is the Cuſtom at Sea. He was bury'd at <hi>Kingſtown,</hi> where he dy'd. He had ſeveral rich <hi>Plantations</hi> in <hi>Jamai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and many Slaves. He had made five ſucceſsful Voyages to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd home laden with Wealth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but the ſixth prov'd fatal to Him. He had a perfect Knowledge in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of <hi>America,</hi> having been ſeveral Years Captain of a Privateer there. He was a Man belov'd of both Officers and Common Sailors; a Perſon of true Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and Fortitude: For when he was wounded in the Engagement, he order'd the Carpenters to make him a Cradle, that he might be upon Deck to give Orders. Nothing went more near his Heart than this unfortunate Expedition; and the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons reported, that the Grief he conceiv'd from it, hinder'd the healing of his Wound, which was given with a Musket-Ball, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0388001100:390"/>
not a Chain-Shot, as has been reported in our Publick Papers. Admiral <hi>Martin,</hi> as being the eldeſt Officer, ſupply'd his Place till Admiral <hi>Whetſtone</hi> arriv'd in the <hi>Boyne.</hi> My very good Friend Captain <hi>Hercules Mitchell,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Strombelo</hi> Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, was made Captain of the <hi>Windſor;</hi> and Admiral <hi>Benbow</hi> being Dead, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd my ſelf, with Captain <hi>Fog</hi>'s leave, into his Ship. The Fleet ſet Sail with the Merchant Ships for <hi>England, March</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi> 1703, and met with nothing worthy of Note.</p>
            <p>On <hi>May</hi> the 5<hi>th,</hi> we enter'd St. <hi>John</hi>'s Harbour in <hi>New-found-land,</hi> and ſtay'd there till <hi>May</hi> the 12<hi>th,</hi> then ſet Sail for the <hi>Bay of Bulls,</hi> a convenient Harbour to Wood and Water in the ſame Iſland. After we had provided every thing we wanted there, we weigh'd Anchor in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Sail for <hi>England.</hi> In weighing our beſt <hi>Bowre</hi> (an Anchor ſo call'd) the Nippers giving way, the Captſtorn-Barrs kill'd us three Men, and broke the Back of a fourth, who dy'd in a Week after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0388001100:391"/>
               <hi>November</hi> the 1ſt, we were ſeparated from the Fleet by a dreadful Storm, that threw all our Maſts by the Board, and our Boltſprit was alſo Sprung, but we fiſh'd that which preſerv'd it. We were in a very pitiful Condition, and I am ſure in great Danger, for I really heard ſome of the Sailors at their Prayers. We loſt two of our Men, who fell with the Main-maſt overboard. The Storm laſted for two Days, and the Weather continu'd ſo Hazy we could not take our Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. We put up our Jury-Maſts, but could make but little Way. We had Captain <hi>Titchburn</hi>'s Company of <hi>Marines,</hi> and Major <hi>Bowls,</hi> Major of the Regiment that did belong to Colonel <hi>Jones,</hi> who dy'd in the Voyage, ſo that having above our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, our Proviſion began to be at an Ebb, which obliged us all to come to half-allowance, and half a Pint of Water a Day to each Man, for we did not know how long we ſhould be out at Sea; but we made <hi>Ireland</hi> beyond all our Hopes <hi>November</hi> the 20<hi>th,</hi> and got ſafe into <hi>Gallaway</hi> Harbour on the 23<hi>d,</hi> and it was a great Providence we did ſo; for on the 25<hi>th</hi> there aroſe ſuch a violent Storm, that muſt have inevitably deſtroyed us. This was that fatal Hurricane that did ſo much Dammage in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. There was two Ships in <hi>Gallaway</hi> Harbour that was ſtranded, and it was allowed by every Body that we ſhould have run the ſame Fate, if our Maſts had been ſtanding; but having none but Jury-Maſts, which we took down when the Storm began to be pretty high, ſo that the Wind could not have the ſame Power over us; neither do I think shat the Storm was ſo violent in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by all Deſcription, as it was in <hi>England, Holland,</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> We ſtay'd at <hi>Gallaway</hi> four Months, and in that time we had got Maſts up and repair'd our other Dammages. While the Ship was fitting up, I lay on ſhore in the Town. <hi>Gallaway</hi> is a
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0388001100:392"/>
neat well-fortify'd Town, as big as <hi>Salisbury,</hi> yet has but one Church. Every thing is very cheap there. I had my Board in a private Houſe for four Shillings <hi>per</hi> Week, and ſeldom Din'd without two or three Diſhes at Table: We bought the beſt <hi>French</hi> Wine for Fourteen pence <hi>per</hi> Quart, and ſometimes under. We ſet Sail from <hi>Gallaway, February</hi> the 27<hi>th,</hi> 1704, and arrived ſafely at <hi>Plymouth.</hi> Thus after many Misfortunes and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards I once more ſet my Feet upon my dear na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country (accompany'd with <hi>Indian Will,</hi> who ſtill lives with me, and proves an honeſt faithful Servant; and I have taken Pains to have him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Chriſtian Religion, and likewiſe to have him Chriſtned by the Name of <hi>William Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico,</hi> from the Iſland that he came from;) and tho' warn'd by many Dangers I had run, I could not forbear making three Voyages more, but yet in a Station different from what I went before. But as they were but common Voyages, that is nothing extraordinary happening, I ſhall conclude with my Prayers and Thanks to Heaven for the many Mercies I have received; wiſhing long Life and Happineſs to my King, Proſperity, Peace, and Riches to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and a hearty Union among my Fellow Subjects.</p>
