            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>— I Have paid all the attention, that the ſhortneſs of the time would permit, in ſearching and procuring authorities, to enable you to oppoſe the objections lately made to <hi>annual parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> as ſtated in your kind letter of the 17th inſtant. — With reſpect to the firſt, i. e. their <q>incompetency, now that the empire is ſo vaſt, and foreign connections ſo interwoven with us;</q> I beg leave to remind you, that the empire is not now more interwoven with foreign connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (I mean thoſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone have power to affect us,) than they were when <hi>annual</hi> parliaments (and <hi>"more often if need be"</hi>) were the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed law of the land; I mean in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0299501400:3"/>
glorious reign of king Edward III. when <hi>ſeveral</hi> of the richeſt and moſt <hi>populous provinces of France</hi> were the hereditary dominions of the family upon the throne; and when the remainder of that mighty and extenſive empire, with the exception of a very few provinces, (the great duke of Burgundy himſelf doing homage for his eſtates,) belonged abſolutely to the crown of England, by the right of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. But the true conſtitutional an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the objection is, that all foreign dominions, acquired by the crown of England, <hi>ought to be governed by free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments of their own,</hi> duly elected by the inhabitants of each diſtinct country reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectively, who have not only the <hi>beſt right,</hi> but the <hi>beſt knowledge and abilities,</hi> how to preſcribe laws for their own go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſafety, and neceſſities. This is the only true means of removing all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty from the government of <hi>diſtant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,</hi> becauſe, in the firſt place, it is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0299501400:4"/>
the only means that is ſtrictly conſiſtent with the <hi>natural rights</hi> of the inhabitants in each dominion, ſeparately conſidered; and alſo, 2dly, the only means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the inhabitants of ſuch diſtant dominions or colonies, from invading the <hi>natural rights</hi> of <hi>each other,</hi> which is the ſource of civil war and diſunion; and, if this moſt eſſential principle of our <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> and of <hi>natural equity,</hi> had been regarded by adminiſtration, agreeably to what I have ſtated, in my Declaration of the Peoples Rights, reſpecting <hi>Ireland,</hi> we ſhould not have loſt <hi>America!</hi> — The only true means, for inſtance, to preſerve the Britiſh empire in <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> which ſtill remains to us, is, to inſtruct the Sooders, and lower caſts of the Indian tribes, concerning their <hi>natural right to a ſhare in the government</hi> of thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which they inhabit, that their duly elected repreſentatives, in a general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, may have confidence to reject
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0299501400:5"/>
and confute that deteſtable lie of the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins, by which they are holden in ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and rendered the prey of Tartarian, as well as European, wolves and tigers.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh company of merchants, aided by the Britiſh government, have, at preſent, both power and influence ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to effect this, and reſtore them to their rights: this would be an obligation never to be forgotten, and which would eſtabliſh trade upon its proper baſis, and <hi>remove all difficulties, as well as expence, from the government of that vaſt empire;</hi> but, if the opportunity be too long ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, it may be ſuddenly loſt for ever!</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the ſecond objection, — <q>The apprehenſions of diſorder on too frequent elections.</q> — The evidence of experience confutes it, as, I hope, I have already proved in the two little tracts, <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Legal Means of political Reformation, in two tracts, p. 31 and 32, alſo 55 and 56. See alſo the three laſt paragraphs of the Memorial of the Deputies from the ſeveral petitioning counties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein it is declared, concerning ANNUAL parliaments, that <q>they were ever deſcribed as conſiſtent with the greateſt peace, and moſt peaceably conducted.</q>
               </note>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0299501400:6"/>
and of which the preamble to the wicked act of the 8th of king Henry VI. is itſelf an ample teſtimony; <note n="†" place="bottom">The <hi>legal Means, &amp;c.</hi> p. 29, 30.</note> becauſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters of the conſtitution, at that time, could not ſay that <q>man-ſlaughter, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, batteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> had <hi>then</hi> happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as they really <hi>do now</hi> at our <hi>ſeptennial elections,</hi> but only in the <hi>future</hi> tenſe, that <hi>"they ſhall very likely ariſe and be."</hi> They could not complain, that there were a <hi>number of outrageous people</hi> at county elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and therefore they perverſely and deceitfully complained only of an <hi>outrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and exceſſive number of people:</hi> the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet, <hi>"outrageous,"</hi> was not applicable to the people, and therefore they have deceitfully branded the innocent ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>"number,"</hi> with the charge of being <hi>"outrageous."</hi> The reaſon of this is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0299501400:7"/>
plain: the manner of wording the act, as it now ſtands, has the effect of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation againſt the behaviour of the people, that is, to a <hi>careleſs reader,</hi> and thereby it anſwered the deceitful purpoſe of thoſe who framed (or tranſlated) the act, which would have been <hi>null and void</hi> for want of <hi>truth,</hi> had the adjective, <hi>"outrageous,"</hi> been applied to the other ſubſtantive, i. e. <hi>people;</hi> for <hi>falſehood</hi> in a preamble has the unqueſtionable effect of deſtroying the force of any ſtatute.</p>
            <p>But, if the people really were <hi>outrageous</hi> at elections, as well as <hi>exceſſively numerous,</hi> yet, it is certain, that they had <hi>right</hi> on their ſide, and intended the good of the kingdom in general; becauſe they have the evidence of all antiquity, that the <hi>majority</hi> of theſe exceſſive numbers were generally for ſending to parliament the beſt and moſt reſpectable men they could find among them; which is not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the teſtimony I quoted from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0299501400:8"/>
Prynne, in p. 31 and 32 of my firſt little tract,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>For a</hi> more equal repreſentation, &amp;c.</note> but alſo by the evidence of that learned antiquarian, Browne Willis, Eſq. who tells us, in the preface of his <hi>Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia parliamentaria,</hi> that <q>the knights of ſhires</q> (viz. thoſe that were choſen by the <hi>outrageous and exceſſive number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>) <q>have, EVER, IN ALL COUNTIES, been choſen out of the principal <hi>gentry and quality:</hi> and though, ſays he, the citizens and burgeſſes were hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore elected out of their reſpective communities, and were only the CHIEF and MOST EMINENT MERCHANTS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of their own communities or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate bodies; yet, in king Edward IV.'s time, we find a great many of them diſtinguiſhed by titles,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This affords a farther anſwer alſo to the firſt objection againſt <hi>annual</hi> parliaments.</p>
            <p>For who are ſo fit to judge of public affairs, <q>
                  <hi>now that the empire</hi> is ſo vaſt,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0299501400:9"/>
and foreign connexions ſo interwoven with us,</q> (according to the objector's ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,) as <q>the principal gentry and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</q> out of the counties, and the <hi>"chief and moſt eminent merchants"</hi> out of the trading cities and boroughs? and more eſpecially ſuch knights, citizens, and burgeſſes, as thoſe of ancient times, whoſe conduct in parliament procured them <hi>the honour</hi> of being <hi>annually retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>more often,</hi> for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years together?</p>
            <p>Thus, the two firſt objections againſt <hi>annual elections</hi> are manifeſtly without foundation; and, with reſpect to the third, that <q>it never was the law of the land,</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">So far is this objection from the <hi>truth,</hi> that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties from the ſeveral petitioning counties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have, in their MEMORIAL, declared, that <q>
                     <hi>ſhortening the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſitting of parliament can only be done,</hi> CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SISTENTLY WITH <hi>the</hi> CONSTITUTION, <hi>or with the beſt policy on any enlarged view, by ſhortening it</hi> TO THE PERIOD OF A YEAR;</q> and they afterwards cite the ancient acts, which ordained, that <q>a parliament ſhall be holden every year once, and more often if need be.</q>
               </note> it ſavours either of ſuch deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0299501400:10"/>
ignorance, or of ſuch bare-faced falſehood and effrontery, as ſcarcely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves an anſwer!</p>
            <p>If I have made any error or miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation in either of the little tracts, let the objectors point it out, and they will not find me backward to ſubmit to <hi>truth;</hi> for that is my duty to God and man! — But, to condemn the doctrine in the lump, without deigning to give a ſingle reaſon or proof againſt it, though it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the moſt unqueſtionable hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical evidence, of which many even of the <hi>original</hi> documents (I mean the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual,</hi> or rather <hi>ſeſſional, writs</hi> themſelves) do ſtill exiſt, in our public records, to this day, is ſuch a deteſtable perverſion of <hi>truth,</hi> ſuch a depravity of human nature, in the baneful ſervice of our great natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral enemy, the <hi>"father of lies,"</hi> that I ſhould hardly have believed my own ears, had I been preſent when the objection was made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0299501400:11"/>Perſons, who diſcover ſuch impotent malice againſt <hi>truth,</hi> muſt be warned of their <hi>ſpiritual</hi> danger, leſt they ſhould be loſt for ever!</p>
            <p>That you may be able more eaſily to confute ſuch objectors, I have ſent you Browne Willis's Notitia parliamentaria; where you will find, in the very firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of writs, (viz. that for the county of Bedford,) examples of <hi>annual</hi> elections for twenty years together, in continual ſucceſſion, except in one ſingle inſtance; which omiſſion will be the more eaſily excuſed, if it be conſidered that there were <hi>two general elections</hi> in the year which <hi>preceded</hi> the year of omiſſion, as alſo <hi>two general elections</hi> in the year which <hi>followed</hi> it. — The period I refer to is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the 15th of king Edward II. and the 15th of king Edward III. In the 6th year of the latter reign, there were <hi>three</hi> new parliaments; two in the 7th, two in the 10th, two in the 11th, two
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0299501400:12"/>
in the 12th, two in the 13th, and FOUR in the 14th, year.<note n="*" place="bottom">It was an ancient uſage of our Saxon anceſtors, to hold <hi>provincial parliaments,</hi> or <hi>ſhire-gemots,</hi> regularly twice a year. <note n="‡" place="bottom">—<q>For the aſſembling of parliament; which, by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of king Alfred, was <hi>to aſſemble twice a year.</hi>

                  <hi>"Twa ſchire-gemot,"</hi> or <hi>two county parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments,</hi> are expreſsly ordained to be holden <hi>"on gear,"</hi> (i. e. <hi>"in a year,"</hi>) by the 5th law of king Edgar, and the 17th law of Canute. See Lambard's Archionomia, p. 64 and 111.</note> This affords ample proof, not only that <hi>new</hi> parliaments ſhould be holden every year <hi>once,</hi> but even <hi>"more often if need be."</hi> The book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a great abundance of other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: and, though the <hi>annual</hi> elections were ſometimes omitted, yet this affords no proof againſt the peoples <hi>right</hi> to have them. Another learned antiquarian, Mr. Gurdon, informs us, in his Hiſtory of the high Court of Parliament, page 282, that <q>
                  <hi>new</hi> ſummonſes were to go out for a <hi>new</hi> parliament,<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <p>The continuance of parliaments for a longer term, without <hi>re-election,</hi> ſeems to have been begun in the reign of king Edward IV. after the people had been ſo cruelly harraſſed by civil war, that they had no ſpirit or (perhaps) <hi>power</hi> left to oppoſe that dangerous uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of their parliamentary rights by <hi>royal prorogations.</hi>
