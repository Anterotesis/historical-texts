            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THERE is no perſon whoſe patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age a Work of this kind may ſo properly claim, as Your's; Your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life having done ſo much honour to the moral part, and Your public one ſuch juſtice to the principal Characters, repreſented in our Author's writings.</p>
            <p>Your action has been a better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on his Text, than all his Editors have been able to ſupply. You mark his beauties; They but clear his blots. You impreſs us with the living ſpirit; They only preſent us the dead letter.</p>
            <p>There is one ſtriking ſimilarity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Shakeſpeare and You, in a very uncommon particular: He is the only Dramatic Writer, who ever alike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AMONG the many writers of our nation, who have by their talents contributed to entertain, inform, or improve our minds, no one has ſo happily or univerſally ſucceeded, as he whom we may juſtly ſtile our firſt, our greateſt Poet, Shakeſpeare. For more than a century and a half, this Author has been the delight of the Ingenious, the text of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt, and the ſtudy of the Philoſopher. Even his cotemporary writers have ingenuouſly yielded their plaudit to his fame, as not preſuming it could leſſen theirs, ſet at ſo great a diſtance. Such ſuperior excellence could never be brought into a comparative light; and jealouſy is dumb, when competition muſt be vain. For him, then, they chearfully twined the laurel-wreath, and unrepining placed it on his brow; where it will ever bloom, while ſenſe, taſte, and natural feelings of the heart, ſhall remain amongſt the characteriſtics of this, or any other nation, that can be able to conſtrue his language. He is a Claſſic, and cotemporary with all ages.</p>
            <q>
               <l>True Nature's Drama repreſents all time;</l>
               <l>Though old the laſt, the firſt retains its prime.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0453900300:6"/>But amidſt all this burſt of applauſe, one ſingle diſcordant voice is faintly heard. Voltaire has ſtood forth his opponent. One might imagine ſuch a writer to have had taſte enough to reliſh his <hi>poetical beauties,</hi> at leaſt, tho' poſſibly ſome doubt might ariſe about his ſympathy with his <hi>moral ones.</hi> But he unfairly tries him by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant laws, which our Author either did not know, or regarded not. His compoſitions are a diſtinct ſpecies of the Drama; and not being an imitation of the Greek one, cannot be juſtly ſaid to have infringed its rules. Shakeſpeare is a <hi>model,</hi> not a <hi>copy</hi>; he looked into nature, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to books, both for men and works. 'Tis learned ignorance, therefore, to quote the antient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplars againſt him. Is there no ſpring inſpired, but Aganippe's font? No raptured viſion, but on Parnaſſus' mount? The Grecian Bards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had conceived a more liberal notion, in this particular, who, by making <hi>Phoebus</hi> the God of Poetry, ſeem to have acknowledged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration to be univerſal.</p>
            <p>But as it may ſhew more impartiality upon this ſubject, to oppoſe one French authority to another, I ſhall here quote againſt M. Voltaire, the Abbé Le Blanc's opinion of our Author, in his <hi>Letters on the Engliſh Nation,</hi> written to his Friend.
<q>He is, ſays he, of all Writers, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient or modern, the moſt of an original. He is truly a great genius, and Nature has endowed him with powers to ſhew it. His imagination is rich and ſtrong: he paints whatever he ſees, and embelliſhes whatever he deſcribes. The Loves in the train of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus are not repreſented with more grace, in
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0453900300:7"/>
the Pictures of Albanus, than this Poet gives to thoſe that attend on Cleopatra, in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the pomp with which that Queen preſents herſelf to Mark Antony, on the banks of the Cydnus.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The reputation of this Author is ſo great, that I ſhall not be ſurprized if you ſuſpect me of exaggeration in this account of him. Thoſe of our nation who have ever men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned him, have been content to praiſe, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being capable of judging ſufficiently of his merits.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To the further honour of our Author be it ſaid, that a Lady <note n="*" place="bottom">Mrs Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> of diſtinguiſhed merit has lately appeared a champion in his cauſe, againſt this <hi>minor critic,</hi> this <hi>minute philoſopher,</hi> this <hi>fly upon a pillar of St. Paul</hi>'s. It was her example which has ſtirred up my emulation to this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; for I own that I am ambitious of the honour of appearing to think, at leaſt, though I deſpair of the ſucceſs of writing, like her.</p>
            <p>Mr. Pope, in the Preface to his edition of this Author, ſays,
<q>Of all the Engliſh Poets, Shakeſpeare muſt be confeſſed to be the faireſt and fulleſt ſubject for Criticiſm, and to afford the moſt numerous, as well as moſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, inſtances, both of beauties and blemiſhes, of all ſorts.</q>
And again:
<q>I cannot, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but mention ſome of his principal and characteriſtic excellencies; for which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his defects, he is juſtly and deſervedly elevated above all other Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Writers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0453900300:8"/>He might have added the following obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, from Longinus, to his remarks, who ſays, that
<q>In reading Homer, Plato, or any other of the great geniuſes of antiquity; whenever we happen to meet with paſſages which appear to be unintelligible or abſurd, we ought fairly to conclude, that were they alive to explain themſelves in thoſe places, we ſhould to our confuſion be convinced, that the ignorance or error lay in our own conceptions alone.</q>
Horace, too, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to upon this occaſion, who indulgently ſays, that <hi>The blaze of fine writing gilds o'er its blots.</hi> Such was the candor, ſuch the modeſty, and ſuch the deference, ſhewn by Antient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators to the works of literature or genius. The brightneſs of the ſun concealed its ſpots from them; but ſecond-hand critics, to ſpeak in the words of a modern Author, <hi>peer through a ſmoked glaſs to obſerve them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The learned and ingenious Doctor Johnſon has given us a juſt and beautiful ſimile, on this ſubject:
<q>The works of a correct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular writer, ſays he, is a garden accurately formed, and diligently planted; varied with ſhades, and ſcented by flowers. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Shakeſpeare is a foreſt, in which oaks extend their branches, and pines tower in the air, interſperſed ſometimes with weeds and brambles, and ſometimes affording ſhelter to myrtles and roſes; filling the eye with awful pomp, and gratifying the mind with endleſs diverſity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This laſt-mentioned Editor is the only one who has conſidered Shakeſpeare's writings in a
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0453900300:9"/>
moral light; and therefore I confeſs myſelf of opinion that he has beſt underſtood them, by thus pointing to their higheſt merit, and nobleſt excellence. And from ſeveral paſſages in the Doctor's Preface, particularly where he ſays, that
<q>From his writings, indeed, a ſyſtem of <hi>ſocial duties</hi> may be ſelected; for he who thinks reaſonably, muſt think <hi>morally</hi>;</q>
as well as from frequent reflections of my own, reſpecting the oeconomical conduct of life and manners, which have always ariſen in my mind on the peruſal of Shakeſpeare's works, I have ventured to aſſume the taſk of placing his Ethic merits in a more conſpicuous point of view, than they have ever hitherto been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in to the Public.</p>
            <p>My difficulty will not be <hi>what to find,</hi> but <hi>what to chuſe,</hi> amidſt ſuch a profuſion of ſweets, and variety of colours; nay, ſometimes, how to ſeparate the moral from the matter, in this Author's writings; which are often ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texted, that, to continue Doctor Johnſon's allegory above quoted, they may be compared to an intermixture of the phyſic with the kitchen garden, where both food and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine may be culled from the ſame ſpot.</p>
            <p>Shakeſpeare is not only my Poet, but my Philoſopher alſo. His anatomy of the human heart is delineated from <hi>nature,</hi> not from <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſics</hi>; referring immediately to our intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe, and not wandering with the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, through the pathleſs wilds of theory. We not only <hi>ſee,</hi> but <hi>feel</hi> his diſſections juſt and ſcientific.—The late ingenious Lord Lyttelton, ſpeaking of Sakeſpeare, ſays,
<q>No author had
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0453900300:10"/>
ever ſo copious, ſo bold, ſo creative an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, with ſo perfect a knowledge of the paſſions, the humours, and ſentiments of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. He painted all characters, from heroes and kings, down to inn-keepers and peaſants, with equal truth, and equal force. If human nature were quite deſtroyed, and no monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment left of it, except his Works, other Beings might learn what man was, from thoſe writings <note n="*" place="bottom">Dialogues of the Dead.</note>.</q>
And Ben Johnſon had long before ſaid of him:
<q>
                  <l>Nature herſelf was proud of his deſigns,</l>
                  <l>And joyed to wear the dreſſings of his lines.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Shakeſpeare ſeems to poſſeſs that happy and peculiar kind of ſuperiority over all other Dramatic Authors, that the ancient poets and hiſtorians confeſſedly bear above the modern ones, with regard to the genuine characters, manners, and ſentiments, of the perſons exhibited in their reſpective writings. In the firſt, we ſee the <hi>men of Nature</hi>; in the latter, but <hi>the children of the Schools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The world at preſent is held more in tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, than it formerly was.—From our modes of education, policies, and breeding, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and demeanor are become more ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, our minds leſs candid, and our actions more diſguiſed. Our modern literary painters repreſent us ſuch as we appear; but the genuine unadulterate heart can be moved by no affection, allied by no ſympathy, with ſuch factitious perſonages, ſuch puppets of polity, ſuch automata of modern refinement. Hence, love, friendſhip, patriotiſm, are long ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0453900300:11"/>
the obſolete ſentiments of chivalry and romance. But in all the repreſentations of Shakeſpeare, we are ſenſible of a connection; his whole Dramatis Perſonae ſeem to be <hi>our acquaintance and countrymen</hi>; while in moſt other exhibitions, they appear to be <hi>ſtrangers and foreigners.</hi> Doctor Johnſon, upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Tragedy of Cato with one of our Author's plays, ſays juſtly, that
<q>Addiſon ſpeaks the language of <hi>Poets,</hi> but Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare that of <hi>Men.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor Warburton ſays,
<q>Of all the literary exercitations of ſpeculative men, whether deſigned for the uſe or entertainment of the world, there are none of ſo much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or what are more of our immediate concern, than thoſe which let us into a knowledge of our nature. Others may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the reaſon, or amuſe the imagination; but theſe only can improve the heart, and form the mind to wiſdom. Now, in this ſcience our Shakeſpeare is confeſſed to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy the foremoſt place; whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the amazing ſagacity with which he inveſtigates every hidden ſpring and wheel of human action; or his happy manner of communicating this knowledge, in the juſt and lively paintings which he has given us of all our paſſions, appetites, and purſuits. Theſe afford a leſſon, which can never be too often repeated, or too ſtrongly incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Shaftſbury, though ſevere, I think rather too much ſo, againſt Shakeſpeare's faults, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that
<q>By the juſtneſs of his moral, the
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0453900300:12"/>
aptneſs of his deſcriptions, and the plain and natural turn of ſeveral of his characters, he pleaſes his audience, and gains their ear, <hi>without a ſingle bribe from luxury or vice.</hi>

            <p>Our Author's poetical beauties have been already ſelected, though they needed it not, as they are undoubtedly ſo ſtriking as ſcarcely to require the being particularly pointed out to any Reader capable of conceiving or reliſhing them; but a ſingle line, ſometimes a word, in many inſtances throughout his Works, may convey a hint, or impreſs a ſentiment upon the heart, if properly marked, which might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be overlooked, while curioſity is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fable, or the imagination tranſported with the ſplendor of diction, or ſublimity of images.</p>
            <p>There is a Moral ſometimes couched in his Fable, which whenever I have been able to diſcover, I have pointed out to the Reader; and from thoſe pieces where this excellence is deficient in the Argument, as particularly in his Hiſtorical Plays, where poetical juſtice cannot always obtain, human life not being the whole of our exiſtence, I have given his moral and inſtruction in detail, by quoting the paſſages as they happen to lie detached, or referring to the ſcope and tenor of the dialogue.</p>
            <p>In theſe remarks and obſervations I have not reſtricted myſelf to morals purely ethic, but have extended my obſervations and reflections to whatever has reference to the general oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of life and manners, reſpecting prudence, polity, decency, and decorum; or relative to the
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0453900300:13"/>
tender affections and fond endearments of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature; more eſpecially regarding thoſe moral duties which are the trueſt ſource of mortal bliſs—domeſtic ties, offices, and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>This code of morality has an advantage over any other of the kind, on account of its not being conducted ſyſtematically. In all books that treat upon theſe ſubjects, the precepts are diſpoſed methodically, under ſeparate heads or chapters; as Ambition, Bravery, Conſtancy, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and ſo on to the end of the alphabet; which mode, though uſeful on account of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, or as a common-place book, cannot be near ſo entertaining, and conſequently ſo well able to anſwer the <hi>utile dulci,</hi> as a work of this ſort, where the documents riſe out of the action immediately before our eyes, and are conſtantly varying with the quick ſhifting of ſcenes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſubjects; where love ſometimes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows war, jealouſy ſucceeds friendſhip, parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony liberality; and ſo proceeding throughout the intire <hi>quicquid agunt homines</hi> of human life.</p>

                  <head>THE MORALITY OF SHAKESPEARE's DRAMA ILLUSTRATED.</head>
                  <head>The TEMPEST.</head>
                  <p>THIS Play, and the Midſummer Night's Dream, which in all the latter editions immediately follows it, are conſidered by Dr. Warburton,
<q>as the nobleſt effort of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and amazing imagination, peculiar to Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, which ſoars above the bounds of Nature, without forſaking Senſe; or, more properly, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Nature along with it, beyond her terreſtrial limits.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He has, indeed, in both theſe exhibitions, created Beings out of all viſible exiſtence; or, as he has him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf moſt beautifully expreſſed it,
<q>
                        <l>Given to airy Nothing</l>
                        <l>A local habitation, and a name.</l>
                     </q>
Yet by the powers of his genius has he contrived to make theſe chimeras of his brain think, act, and ſpeak, in a manner which appears ſo ſuited to the anomalous perſonages his magic has conjured up, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0453900300:18"/>
we readily adopt them into the ſcale of Nature, from a preſumption, that were they really to exiſt, they would probably reſemble the characters which his wand has endowed them with.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two plays are generally ſuppoſed to have been the firſt and ſecond of his writing; though I believe there are no dates remaining, to confirm this opinion; which can therefore be founded only on the idea, that his youthful imagination muſt naturally be thought to have been more ſportive and exuberant, than his riper judgment might have permitted the indulgence of. And here, indeed,
<q>
                        <l>She wantons, as in her prime,</l>
                        <l>And plays at will her virgin fancies:</l>
                     </q>
though, if I may be allowed the liberty of a criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm about this matter, I ſhould be rather inclined to ſuppoſe this Play to have been one of his latter performances, as all the <hi>unities</hi> are ſo ſtrictly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in it.</p>
                  <p>But though both theſe pieces poſſeſs all the <hi>leſſer merits</hi> of poeſy, they are not ſo much ſuited to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of my preſent undertaking, eſpecially the ſecond, as ſeveral others of the ſame author; for the moſt material events, in both, being principally conducted by <hi>machinery,</hi> or ſupernatural agency, produce rather aſtoniſhment than reflection: ſo that unleſs we adopt Dr. Johnſon's remark, in the firſt ſcene of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt,
<q>it may be obſerved of Gonzalo, that being the only good man that appears with the King, he is the only one who preſerves his chearfulneſs in the wreck, or his hope on the iſland,</q>
there is not ſo much to be collected from them, as I could wiſh, to be placed to the ſcore of Morality. However, all that can be extracted from either, referrible to this head, ſhall be diligently pointed out to the reader. With this view I ſhall lay the Fable of this Play before my reader, for the ſake of the Moral, which may be ſo fairly deduced from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0453900300:19"/>Proſpero, a duke of Milan, having been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled his dominion, by the uſurpation of his brother Anthonio, confederated with Alonzo, a king of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, is committed to the mercy of the winds and waves, in a rotten bark, accompanied only by his daughter, Miranda, a child of three years old; but has had the good fortune to eſcape, and be landed on an uninhabited iſland; where the firſt ſcene is laid, and the intire action continued, during the whole repreſentation.</p>
                  <p>About twelve years after this event, Anthonio, with Alonzo, Ferdinand his ſon, and other attendants, being on a voyage together, are driven out of their courſe, by a ſtorm, and wrecked upon this iſland, but eſcape alive on ſhore; where the Prince, meeting with Miranda, falls in love with her, and a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal paſſion is conceived on her part, alſo.</p>
                  <p>Proſpero, having thus got his enemies within his power, on their repentance, generouſly forgives them their cruelty and injuſtice, recovers his dukedom again, and the marriage of the lovers confirms an alliance on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>From this ſhort ſtory I think the following <hi>general Moral</hi> will naturally reſult: That the ways, the juſtice, and the goodneſs of Providence, are ſo frequently manifeſted towards mankind, even in this life, that it ſhould ever encourage an honeſt and a guiltleſs mind to form hopes, in the moſt forlorn ſituations; and ought alſo to warn the wicked never to reſt aſſured in the falſe confidence of wealth or power, againſt the natural abhorrence of vice, both in God and man.</p>
                  <p>Many of the unforeſeen events of life, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us but accident or contingency, may poſſibly be parts of the ſecret workings of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<q>All chance direction which we cannot ſee;</q>
and have oftener been remarked rather as chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vice, than as reliefs from miſery. We are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0453900300:20"/>
ſenſible in our own nature, of a ſtronger impulſe to reſent the firſt, than even to commiſerate the latter. How much higher, then, muſt this ſentiment riſe, in the Author of that very nature! In wretchedneſs there is no contagion, 'tis but particular and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary: the effects of vice are general and eternal.</p>
                  <p>Part of a ſpeech in this play may be better quoted here, than elſewhere, as it refers ſo immediately to this ſubject.</p>

                        <p>Trinculo moſt humourouſly ridicules the paſſion of the Engliſh for ſtrange ſights, in the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, on ſeeing Caliban lying aſleep on the ground, whom he takes for a dead ſea-monſter, juſt caſt aſhore by the working of the waves.
<q>Were I in England, now, as once I was, and had but this fiſh painted, not a holy-day fool there but would give a piece of ſilver. There would this monſter <hi>make a man</hi>; any ſtrange beaſt there <hi>makes a man.</hi> When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to ſee a dead Indian.</q>
                           <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0453900300:25"/>
Not, however, that this foible can fairly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced againſt us, as a national reflection, by any means; for it is not peculiar to this, or any other particular people, but will be found to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſpoſition and idle curioſity of mankind, in general. There is another piece of ſarcaſm, alſo, thrown out, in the ſame ſpeech, as unjuſt as the former: <hi>When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar.</hi> No nation on the globe is more diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for charity, humanity, and benevolence, than the Engliſh are, at preſent. And this muſt have been always their characteriſtic; for manners may refine, but cannot create, virtues. Poliſhing may give taſte, but feelings come from nature.</p>
                        <p>After Trinculo has recovered from his fright, and finds Caliban to be but an harmleſs ſavage, ſo very ſimple as to believe Stephano to be the Man in the Moon; he ſays,
<q>By this good light, this is a very ſhallow monſter—<hi>I afraid of him?</hi> a very ſhallow monſter. The man i' th' Moon? a moſt poor credulous monſter.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis to be obſerved, here, that he was not charged with having been afraid, nor did any one know of it, but himſelf; and it was this very conſciouſneſs that forced ſuch a bravado from him. This is Doctor Warburton's remark. 'Tis a juſt one, and may be rendered general, by obſerving, that, upon all occaſions, too prompt a defence of ourſelves, is a ſort of ſelf-accuſation.</p>

                        </q>
                        <p>In this ſpeech, the pious notion of the Antients, with regard to this relation, while genuine Nature was their ſole Preceptor, is fully expreſſed. Here the duty of children to their parents, is indeed car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the height; and yet, methinks, not at all too far. They are the objects of our earlieſt affections, of our firſt deference, of our primary obligations. Even ſuperſtition, in this caſe, as far at leaſt as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit obedience extends, exceeds not true devotion.</p>
                        <p>The Decalogue was originally written on two ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; five in each. The firſt refers ſolely to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; the ſecond, to Morality, only. To honour our parents, therefore, as falling within the former line of obligations, is, by this diſtinction, made one
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0453900300:32"/>
of our <hi>pious</hi> duties; as through them we honour the Creator, who ordained this relation between us. This precept, then, ſhould ſeem to have a double tie upon us, as partaking both of <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>morals</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, however the latter bond may chance to be cancelled, the firſt ought never to be diſpenſed with.</p>
                        <p>In fine, there is ſomething ſo fond and endearing in the idea and exerciſe of a child's obedience and deference towards a parent, that how rotten muſt the root be, or how blighted the branches, if ſuch a tree ſhould fail of producing its natural fruit!</p>
                        <p>Thus far, by way of general reflection, only; for I muſt, notwithſtanding, admit, that the particular inſtance of the daughter's compliance, exacted by the father, in this piece, of reſigning an huſband of her own choice, <hi>upon equal terms,</hi> and accepting another, choſen arbitrarily for her, <hi>by caprice merely,</hi> was too ſevere a trial of obedience. Egeus here, like Abraham, would ſacrifice his child at the altar, not only without the command of God, but contrary to his expreſs purpoſe, proclaimed aloud by the voice of Nature, and further confirmed from the deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of virtuous affection, free will, and rational election.</p>
                        <p>When I ſaid that the duty of a child was <hi>natural,</hi> I did not mean to inveſt the parent with an authority which <hi>was not ſo</hi>; and I cannot blame Hermia, therefore, upon the ſevere laws of Athens being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to her, for the chaſte and ſpirited reſolution ſhe frames to herſelf on that occaſion.</p>

                              <l>Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;</l>

                              <l>My tongue ſhould catch your tongue's ſweet melody.</l>
                              <l>Were the world mine, Demetrius being 'bated,</l>

                        </q>

                           <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0453900300:34"/>Hermia had uſed no arts, no coquetry, to allure her lover from her; for, as ſhe expreſſes it, juſt after, in the ſame dialogue,
<q>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</q>
She had, indeed, happened to have done her an <hi>injury,</hi> but <hi>no wrong</hi>; and therefore the forſaken maid ſhews her juſtice in plaining her own ill fortune, only, without expreſſing the leaſt manner of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt her unoffending rival.</p>
                        <p>Hermia, in the ſame ſcene, alludes to the magic power of love, which concenters all our ideas in one, making us prefer a cottage to a palace, and a deſert to a grove, according to the ſituation or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the object of our affections. After having declared the purpoſe of flying her country with her lover, ſhe adds,
<q>
                              <l>Before the time I did Lyſander ſee,</l>
                              <l>Seemed Athens like a Paradiſe to me.</l>
                              <l>O then, what graces in my love do dwell,</l>
                              <l>That he hath turned a heaven into hell?</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And Helena, afterwards, carries on the ſame idea, in the following lines:
<q>
                              <l>Things baſe and vile, holding no quantity,</l>
                              <l>Love can tranſpoſe to form and dignity.</l>
                              <l>Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;</l>
                              <l>And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind;</l>
                              <l>Nor hath love's mind of any judgment taſte:</l>
                              <l>Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haſte,</l>
                              <l>And therefore is love ſaid to be a child,</l>
                              <l>Becauſe in choice he is ſo oft beguiled.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſeus too, in a paſſage of his ſpeech, in the firſt Scene of the Fifth Act of this Play, accords with the above ſentiment:
<q>
                              <l>While the lover all as frantic</l>
                              <l>Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And Shakeſpeare has hinted a moral, on this latter ſubject, with regard to irregular or ill-placed affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Dr. Warburton has juſtly obſerved,
<q>by as fine a metamorphoſis as any in Ovid,</q>

                     <p>Among the <hi>brief of ſports,</hi> as it is called, to be exhibited before Theſeus, on his wedding-day, this is the title of one:

                           <l>The thrice three Muſes mourning for the death</l>

                     <p>Mr. Warton imagines this paſſage to have alluded to a poem of Spenſer's, ſtiled <hi>The Tears of the Muſes, on the Neglect and Contempt of Learning,</hi> in his time. Though this was not properly a complaint of that age, only; it has been ſo much the grievance of all times, that it has, long ſince, obtained into a proverb, <hi>As poor as a poet.</hi>

is certainly very hard. Perſons who apply their minds to letters, muſt unavoidably neglect their temporal concerns; and thoſe who employ their time in the reformation or entertainment of the world, ſhould be ſupported by it—Not by merely accidental and precarious emoluments, but upon ſome more permanent foundation; like the Clergy, who have had a proviſion made for them, for the ſame reaſon as above; and the name of <hi>Clerk,</hi> tho' now appropriated to the latter, was formerly the common appellation of both.

                  <head>THE Two Gentlemen of Verona.</head>
                  <p>THE Fable of this Play has no more moral in it, than the former, nor does it make us much amends, either by the number, or variety of its documents. I would, therefore, have paſſed it by, as ſome of the editors have done, on the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of its not being one of Shakeſpeare's; but that I thought any thing which had ever been imputed to that author, had a right to claim a place in this Work; unleſs the rejection of it were eſtabliſhed upon better grounds, than the diverſity of opinions about its authenticity, among the Commentators.</p>
                  <p>And, indeed, were I to offer any doubt upon this point, myſelf, it ſhould not be ſo much from the objections adduced by the editors, as on account of the unnatural inconſiſtency of character, in the perſon of Protheus; who, in the firſt Act, and during above half the ſecond, appears to ſtand in the moſt amiable and virtuous lights, both of morals and manhood, as a fond lover, and a faithful friend; and yet ſuddenly belies his fair ſeemings, by an infidelity toward the firſt object, and a treachery with regard to the ſecond. 'Tis true, indeed, that in the latter end he expreſſes a ſort of contrition for his crimes; but yet this ſtill ſeems to remain equivocal; as it does not appear to have ariſen from any remorſe of conſcience, or abhorrence of his baſeneſs, but rather from a diſappointment in his purſuit, and an open detection of his villainy.</p>
                  <p>There are but few inſtances of this kind, that I remember to have met with, throughout the drama of Shakeſpeare; for however he may ſport, as he often does, with the three <hi>unities</hi> of Ariſtotle, <hi>time,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0453900300:41"/>
place,</hi> and <hi>action,</hi> he ſeldom ſins againſt a fourth, which I am ſurpriſed the Critics have not added, as being worth them all—namely, that of <hi>character</hi>; the tenor of which is generally preſerved, from firſt to laſt, in all his works. This conſiſtency is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the epic, and why not inſiſted on in the dramatic poem, I cannot conceive.</p>
                  <p>I am venturing, I own, beyond my purpoſe; but I am tempted here, upon mentioning his breach of the unities, to obſerve, that the Commentators do our author great injuſtice, to examine him by the cold rules of artful conſtruction. Shakeſpeare's writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings reſemble the antient muſic, which conſiſted in <hi>melody</hi> alone, without regard to <hi>harmony,</hi> which is a ſcience of much later invention; and it has been remarked, that the original airs of every country, which charm a natural ear moſt, have been thoſe that give offence to <hi>modern compoſers,</hi> by an utter neglect of the <hi>counter-point.</hi> The compoſitions of our Bard have the ſame beauty, with the ſame defect. He ought, therefore, never to be conſidered but under the deſcription which Milton has given of him;
<q>
                        <l>Our ſweeteſt Shakeſpeare, Fancy's child,</l>
                        <l>Warbling his native wood-notes wild.</l>
                     </q>
Would they reſtrain him within the precincts of art, the height, the depth of whoſe imagination and creative genius found even the extent of Nature too ſtreightly bounded for it to move in?</p>
                  <q>Exhauſted worlds, and then imagined new.</q>
                  <p>Like an eaſtern monarch, his word was law, his will and pleaſure edicts and decrees. But there are certain <hi>mechaniſts</hi> in criticiſm, who have no other way of judging, but by applying the <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>compaſs</hi>; like antient gardeners, who trimmed their foreſt-trees into cones and cylinders, and reduced winding brooks to ſquare canals. A man muſt be <hi>born</hi> a critic, as well as a poet; but, at this rate, he may be <hi>bred</hi> both.</p>
                  <p>But to return from this digreſſion to the ſubject which lies more properly before us, at preſent.</p>

                     <p>The great neceſſity and benefit of Travel are properly recommended, and marked by apt phraſe, in the firſt ſpeech here; which opening, with the addition of a few other paſſages, ſeems to promiſe more than, I am ſorry to ſay, the reſt of the piece is reſponſible for. And it is this circumſtance which has induced the critics to ſuſpect this Play not to have been originally one of Shakeſpeare's, but only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and enriched with fragments, by him; as it may be deemed to be not <hi>a jewel,</hi> but only <hi>a lump of paſte,</hi> ſet round <hi>with ſparks.</hi>

of man. Second nature is more than a match even for the firſt. In this philoſophy lie the manifeſt and manifold advantages of a good education, which alone forms the different manners allotted to the ſexes, rendering men brave, and preſerving women chaſte.

                  <p>I CANNOT ſee what moral can be extracted from the fable of this Piece; but as the author of it ſeems to have thought otherwiſe, I ſhall preſent the reader with his idea on this ſubject, in his own words; where the Duke paſſes ſentence on Angelo, his deputy, for his double villainy:

                              <l>For we bid this be done,</l>

                        </p>
                        <p>The ſame reflection is carried on, in the fifth Scene of the Second Act; where ſome one ſays,
<q>Lord Angelo is ſevere.</q>
To which Eſcalus, his colleague in adminiſtration, replies,
<q>
                              <l>It is but needful;</l>
                              <l>Mercy is not itſelf, that oft looks ſo;</l>

                        </p>
                        <p>But to recur back again to the firſt Act, which I quitted in purſuit of the above argument ſtarted there; in the ſixth Scene, where Claudio deſires his friend to employ his ſiſter to ſolicit his pardon, he very judiciouſly urges that peculiar kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſiveneſs, which naturally dwells in youth and innocence:
<q>
                              <l>Acquaint her with the danger of my State;</l>

                        <p>Gratiano then coming in, and taking notice of the ſeriouſneſs of Anthonio's aſpect, alike imputes it to the ſame cauſe his other friends had done:

                              <l>You look not well, Signior Anthonio;</l>
                              <l>You have too much reſpect upon the world;</l>

                        <p>To which he replies:
<q>

                        <p>Upon this, Gratiano enters into the ſame hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous deſcription of the different characters of men, as Solarino had done.</p>

                           <l>By being peeviſh? I tell thee what, Anthonio,</l>
                           <l>(I love thee, and it is my love that ſpeaks)</l>
                           <l>There are a ſort of men, whoſe viſages</l>

                     <p>The great principle of univerſal charity, which ſoars above the partial reſpects of nations or of ſects, is ſtrongly, though indirectly, inculcated, in the Jew's ſpeech, here; which, according to this very principle, ſhould be received without prejudice, though proceeding from the mouth of an Alien, and an Infidel.</p>
                     <p>Shylock, ſpeaking of Anthonio,
<q>He hath diſgraced me, and hindered me of half a million, laughed at my loſſes, mocked at my gains, ſcorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies; and what's his reaſon? <hi>I am a Jew.</hi> Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimenſions, ſenſes, affections, paſſions? Fed with the ſame food, hurt by the ſame weapons, ſubject to the ſame diſeaſes, healed by the ſame means, warmed and cooled by the ſame ſummer and winter, as a Chriſtian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poiſon us, do we not die?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the remainder of the ſpeech exceeds the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Chriſtian ethics, I think proper to ſtop the Jew's mouth, here.</p>

                        <p>THIS Play begins with a reflection on the <hi>firſt,</hi> and I may add the <hi>principal,</hi> concern in life, the education of children. Men are often more ſedulous in training the brutes of their kennels, their mews and their ſtables, than they ſeem to be about the heirs of their blood, their fortunes, or their honours. In ſad truth may it be ſaid, that we ſeldom meet with a jockey, an huntſman, or a ſportſman, who is half ſo <hi>well-bred</hi> as his horſes, his hawks, or his hounds.</p>
                        <p>Orlando, ſpeaking of the unkindneſs of his elder brother and guardian, ſays,
<q>For my part, he keeps me ruſtically at home; or, to ſpeak more properly, <hi>flies</hi> me here at home, unkept; for call you that keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the <hi>ſtalling of an ox?</hi> His horſes are bred better; for beſides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage; and to that end riders dearly hired; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the which the animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Beſides this Nothing that he ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully gives me, the Something that Nature gave me his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſeems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines <note n="*" place="bottom">Mines, <hi>for</hi> undermines.</note> my gentility with my education.</q>

                        <p>Orlando, travelling through the foreſt, with his poor old friend, leaves him, for a while, to go in queſt of food, as ſhewn before, in the laſt Scene but one; and coming where the Duke and his train are at dinner, draws his ſword, to force ſome of the viands from them. The former Scene, already quoted, prepares us finely for Orlando's violence here, which muſt otherwiſe have created diſguſt, and ſeem to have been inconſiſtent with his expreſſion, in the third Scene above, where he ſays to Adam,
<q>
                              <l>What, would'ſt thou have me go and beg my food?</l>
                              <l>Or with a baſe and boiſterous ſword enforce</l>

                        <p>The abrupt commencement of this dialogue leads us to ſuppoſe, that it is but the continuation of one they had engaged in before their appearance in this ſcene, in which Celia had been endeavouring to quiet Roſalind's fears, upon her lover's having broke his promiſe of meeting her; and whether from being tired with her obſtinacy, or reſolving to try her ſincerity, ſhe here ſeems to join in her reſentment, by agreeing with her in every thing; which has an effect very natural in all ſuch caſes, that the plaintiff immediately becomes defendant, whenever the perſon beloved happens to be cenſured by any one elſe but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

                        <p>Doctor Warburton, in a note on this paſſage, has quoted a ſimilar one from Fletcher, in his Queen of Corinth:
<q>
                              <l>Has he familiarly</l>
                              <l>Diſliked your yellow ſtarch, or ſaid your doublet</l>
                              <l>Was not exactly frenchified? or drawn your ſword,</l>
                              <l>Cried 'twas ill mounted? has he given the lye,</l>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>In</hi> circle, <hi>or</hi> oblique, <hi>or</hi> ſemi-circle,</l>
                              <l>Or <hi>direct parallel?</hi> you muſt challenge him.</l>
                           </q>

                        <p>THE rational, ſociable, and friendly manner in which crowned heads uſed formerly to live plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly with one another, is deſcribed here—Why is it no longer ſo? Does modern polity oppoſe itſelf to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity? Kings may have miſtreſſes, indeed; but friend or favourite they muſt have none. What amends can the whole <hi>regalia</hi> of their ſolitary pomp afford them, for being denied one of the ſweeteſt, the deareſt, and the moſt virtuous enjoyments of life; a manly ſympathy of affections, and a chaſte intercourſe of ſouls! Modern kings may ſay, as Richard the Third did, <hi>I am myſelf alone; Incedo ſolus</hi>; but not in the happy ſenſe that Horace meant it—the <hi>quacunque libido eſt</hi> is wanting.</p>

                              <p>Sicilia cannot ſhew himſelf over-kind to Bohemia; they were trained together in their childhoods; and there rooted betwixt them then ſuch an affection, which cannot chuſe but branch now. Since their more mature dignities and royal neceſſities made ſeparation of their ſociety, their encounters, though not perſonal, have been royally attornied with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embaſſies; that they have ſeemed to be together, though abſent; ſhook hands, as over a vaſt; and embraced, as it were, from the ends of oppoſed winds. The heavens continue their loves!</p>

Though I cannot help obſerving here, that her vindictive ſpirit appears plainly not to have yet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, but only taken a different courſe, by the latter part of her ſpeech; for ſhe continues ſtill to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate her charges againſt him, as if only by way of enumerating the articles of her forgiveneſs.</p>
                        <p>Our Author, who almoſt every where manifeſts a perfect knowledge in the anatomy of the human mind, proves his ſcience more particularly in a paſſage of this Scene, by ſhewing a property in our natures which might have eſcaped any common diſſecter of morals; and this is, our ſuffering, upon true penitence and contrition, not only all reproach thrown out againſt us with meekneſs and ſubmiſſion, but even encouraging and augmenting the abuſe, by joining in our own condemnation. This may poſſibly ariſe from a ſtrong wiſh, or ſanguine hope, that ſuch a voluntary penance may in part be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, both by heaven and the world, as ſome ſort of atonement for our crimes.</p>

Perdita ſhews a charming genuineneſs of nature in her latter ſpeech; for though ſhe confeſſes the truth of Polixenes' poſition, yet is ſhe ſo jealous of the honour of our great parent, that even the appearance of a violation againſt her rights offends her. And the parallel ſhe makes upon the occaſion, is beautiful. Readers ſee not half the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of Shakeſpeare, who overlook his <hi>minutiae.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>This Comedy is full of well-deſcribed character, and beautiful deſcription; but theſe not happening to fall within the ſcope I had preſcribed to myſelf in this work, I have reluctantly paſſed them by, without noting.

higheſt,</hi> in the alluſion to ſacred writ, relating to the two principal articles in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the fall of man, and his redemption. Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare makes frequent references to the ſacred text, and writes often, not only as a moraliſt, but as a divine.</p>
                        <p>Autolicus having by accident had ſome hand in bringing about the diſcovery of Perdita, which was a circumſtance that might have been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make another man's fortune, makes only this ſad ſoliloquy upon the occaſion:
<q>
                              <hi>Now, had I not the daſh of my former life in me, would preferment drop on my head.</hi> I brought the old man and his ſon aboard the Prince; told him I heard them talk of a fardel, and I know not what; but he at that time over-fond of the ſhepherd's daughter, ſo he then took her to be, who began to be much ſea-ſick, and himſelf little better, extremity of weather continuing, this myſtery remained undiſcovered. <hi>But 'tis all one to me; for had I been the finder out of this ſecret, it would not have reliſhed, among my other diſcredits.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>That <hi>honeſty is the beſt policy,</hi> is a homely proverb; but this only the more vouches the truth of it, by its having ſtood the teſt of all experience. Character is the <hi>immediate jewel of the ſoul,</hi> not only in its own worth, but even in the temporal advantages which frequently accrue from it. Loſt health may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, loſt fortune be regained, even loſt ſenſes may be recovered; but a forfeited character is rarely ever to be retrieved.</p>
                        <p>This is a theme which cannot be too largely or too frequently expatiated upon; which I hope will ſerve as my apology for having taken the hint from ſo mean and trifling an inſtance as the foregoing.</p>

                              <l>To pay this debt of love but to a brother,</l>

                        <p>I am happy that this latter paſſage happens to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur ſo immediately after my remark above, as it affords me an opportunity of doing juſtice to Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, by obſerving that his inference, from Olivia's grief, to the nature of her heart in love, ſhews a perfect knowledge in this ſpecies of philoſophy. The paſſions are divided into but two claſſes, the tender and the violent; and any one of either affords an earneſt of all others of the ſame kind.</p>
                        <p>His diſtinction, too, of the <hi>three thrones,</hi> the <hi>liver, brain,</hi> and <hi>heart,</hi> is admirable.

                        <p>Upon Mrs. Page's reading Falſtaff's Love-letter to her, ſhe makes the following reflection:
<q>What unweighed behaviour hath this Flemiſh drunkard pickt, i' th' Devil's name, out of my converſation, that he dares in this manner eſſay me? Why, he hath not been thrice in my company— What ſhould I ſay to him? I was then frugal of my mirth."</q>

                        <q>Nay, I know not—It makes me almoſt ready to wrangle with mine own honeſty. I'll entertain myſelf like one that I am not acquainted withal; for, ſure, unleſs he knew ſome ſtain in me, that I know not myſelf, he would never have boarded me in this fury.</q>
                        <p>This is a very natural ſentiment for a delicate mind to conceive, upon meeting with an affront of this ſort; and 'tis extremely proper, upon all ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to enter into ſuch a ſelf-examination, by way of inquiring what part of our own conduct, or <hi>unweighed behaviour,</hi> as ſhe expreſſes it, might have encouraged the offence; and upon an impartial ſcrutiny we ſhall generally find, that 'tis more our indiſcretion than our charms which prompts the attack.</p>

                        <head>THE INTRODUCTION. SCENE III.</head>
                        <p>Among the preparations which are making, in order to deceive the drunken Tinker into the notion of his having been a mad Lord juſt recovering his ſenſes, ſome Strollers are introduced to perform a Play for his entertainment; and the Actors meaning to exhibit one of the old religious Farces, ſtiled the <hi>Myſteries,</hi> upon enumerating the <hi>properties</hi> neceſſary toward the repreſentation, aſk for
<q>a little <hi>vinegar</hi> to make their Devil roar.</q>
Upon which paſſage Dr. Warburton gives the following note:</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>When the acting the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the Old and New Teſtament was in vogue, at the repreſentation of the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Paſſion,</hi> Judas and the Devil made a part. And the Devil, wherever he came, was always to ſuffer ſome diſgrace, to make the people laugh; as here the buffoonery was to apply the <hi>gall and vinegar,</hi> to make him roar. And the <hi>Paſſion</hi> being that, of all the <hi>Myſteries,</hi> which was moſt frequently repreſented, <hi>vinegar</hi> became at length the ſtanding implement to torment the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0453900300:144"/>
Devil, and uſed for this purpoſe even after the <hi>Myſteries</hi> ceaſed and the <hi>Moralities</hi> 
                              <note n="*" place="bottom">Certain allegorical pieces, where the Virtues and Vices were perſonified, which ſucceeded to the ſtage, upon the prohibition of the former.</note> came in vogue; where the Devil ſtill continued to bear a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part. The mention of it here, was deſigned to ridicule ſo abſurd a circumſtance in theſe old Farces.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The giving ſuch theatrical repreſentations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ, was rather ſomething more than barely <hi>abſurd</hi>; it was extremely profane: but the device of tormenting the Devil with <hi>gall and vinegar,</hi> had a myſtic conceit in it; being certainly intended by the authors of theſe exhibitions, as an alluſion to a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance in the <hi>Paſſion,</hi> mentioned by St. Matthew, where he ſays, <hi>they gave him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall.</hi> Chap. xxvii. ver. 34. And as the ſufferings on the <hi>Croſs</hi> were undergone for our <hi>redemption from ſin,</hi> the prieſts, who were the contrivers of this ſtrange and improper ſpecies of drama, might have intended this particular to ſhew the diſtreſs of the Devil upon that occaſion.</p>

                     <p>After Catharine has been thoroughly reclaimed, ſhe takes an occaſion, from a circumſtance in the Play, of reproving another married woman, in an admirable ſpeech; wherein the deſcription of a way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wife, with the duty and ſubmiſſion which ought to be ſhewn to a huſband, are finely ſet forth.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Fy! fy! unknit that threatening unkind brow,</l>
                        <l>And dart not ſcornful glances from thoſe eyes,</l>
                        <l>To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.</l>
                        <l>It blots thy beauty, as froſts bite the meads;</l>
                        <l>Confounds thy fame, as whirlwinds ſhake fair buds,</l>
                        <l>And in no ſenſe is meet or amiable.</l>
                        <l>A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,</l>
                        <l>Muddy, ill-ſeeming, thick, bereft of beauty;</l>
                        <l>And while it is ſo, none ſo dry or thirſty</l>
                        <l>Will deign to ſip, or touch one drop of it.</l>
                        <l>Thy huſband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,</l>
                        <l>Thy head, thy ſovereign; one that cares for thee,</l>
                        <l>And for thy maintenance commits his body</l>
                        <l>To painful labour, both by ſea and land;</l>
                        <l>To watch the night in ſtorms, the day in cold,</l>

                        <l>Too little payment for ſo great a debt.</l>
                        <l>Such duty as the ſubject owes the prince,</l>
                        <l>Even ſuch a woman oweth to her huſband;</l>
                        <l>And when ſhe's froward, peeviſh, ſullen, ſour,</l>
                        <l>And not obedient to his honeſt will,</l>
                        <l>What is ſhe but a foul contending rebel,</l>
                        <l>And graceleſs traitor, to her loving lord?</l>
                        <l>I am aſhamed that women are ſo ſimple,</l>
                        <l>To offer war, where they ſhould kneel for peace;</l>
                        <l>Or ſeek for rule, ſupremacy, and ſway,</l>
                        <l>When they are bound to ſerve, love, and obey.</l>
                        <l>Why are our bodies ſoft, and weak, and ſmooth,</l>
                        <l>Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,</l>
                        <l>But that our ſoft conditions and our hearts</l>
                        <l>Should well agree with our external parts?</l>
                        <l>Come, come, you froward and unable worms,</l>
                        <l>My mind has been as big as one of yours,</l>
                        <l>My heart as great, my reaſon haply more,</l>
                        <l>To bandy word for word, and frown for frown;</l>
                        <l>But now I ſee our lances are but ſtraws,</l>

                     </q>
                     <p>I have ſtopped ſhort here, as thinking that the following lines might have marred the whole beauty of the ſpeech; the doctrine of <hi>paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance</hi> in the ſtate of marriage, being there carried, perhaps, rather a little too far. But I ſhall quote them here, as they afford me an opportunity of remarking on the nature of too prompt reformees, who are apt to run into the very contrary extreme, at once; betraying more of the <hi>time-ſerver,</hi> than the <hi>convert.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, in general, indeed, it has been obſerved, that the moſt haughty tyrants become, on a reverſe of fortune, the moſt abject ſlaves; and this from a like principle, in both caſes; that they are apt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the ſame ſpirit of deſpotiſm to the conqueror, they were before impreſt with themſelves; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, are brought to tremble at the apprehenſion of their own vice.</p>
                     <p>The lines I allude to, are theſe:
<q>
                           <l>Then vail your ſtomachs, for it is no boot,</l>
                           <l>And place your hands beneath your huſband's foot;</l>
                           <l>In token of which duty, if he pleaſe,</l>
                           <l>My hand is ready, may it do him eaſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <p>The total metamorphoſis of character, manners, and diſpoſition, wrought in us by love, is well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in a ſpeech in this Scene:
<q>
                              <sp>
                                 <speaker>Benedick.</speaker>
                                 <p>I do much wonder, that one man ſeeing how much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man is a fool, when he dedicates his behaviour to love, will, after he hath laughed at ſuch ſhallow follies in others, become the argument of his own ſcorn, by falling himſelf in love! And ſuch a man is Claudio. I have known when there was no muſic with him, but the drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0453900300:161"/>
and the pipe. I have known when he would have walked ten miles a foot, to ſee a good armour; and now will he lye ten nights awake, carving the faſhion of a new doublet. He was wont to ſpeak plain, and to the purpoſe, like an honeſt man, and a ſoldier; and now is he turned orthographer; his words are a very fantaſtical banquet, juſt ſo many ſtrange diſhes.</p>
                              </sp>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>From theſe reflections, Benedick goes on holding a debate with himſelf upon this ſubject; and, like moſt people, before their hearts have become a party in the matter, draws a vain portrait of the peerleſs para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon who only can be capable of triumphing over his affections; leaving nothing, in the choice of his miſtreſs, to Heaven itſelf, except <hi>the colour of her hair.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <q>May I be ſo converted, and ſee with theſe eyes? I cannot tell; I think not. I will not be ſworn but love may transform me to an oyſter; but I'll take my oath, that till he have made one of me, he ſhall never make me ſuch a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wiſe, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well. But till all graces meet in one woman, one woman ſhall not come in my grace. Rich ſhe ſhall be, that's certain; wiſe, or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her; fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good diſcourſe, an excellent muſician; <hi>and her hair ſhall be of what colour it pleaſe God.</hi>

                        <p>The ſcheme for inducing Benedick and Beatrice to fall in love with each other, which is commenced with him in the preceding Scene, and concluded with her in the firſt one of the Third Act, is moſt admirably laid. The ſureſt method that artifice can contrive to inſpire a paſſion in any one, is by giving them a notion of the other party's predilection for them; for, as Hero ſays to Urſula, in the plot on Beatrice,

They have the truth of this, from Hero; they ſeem to pity the lady; it ſeems her affections have the full bent. Love me! Why, it muſt be requited—I hear how I am cenſured; they ſay, I will bear myſelf proudly, if I perceive the love to come from her; they ſay too, that ſhe will rather die than give any ſign of affection.—I did never think to marry—I muſt not ſeem proud—happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. They ſay the lady is fair; 'tis a truth, I can bear them witneſs—And virtuous—'Tis ſo, I cannot reprove it—And wiſe—but for loving me—By my troth, it is no addition to her wit—nor no great argument of her folly, neither; for I will be horribly in love with her—I may chance to have ſome odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have railed ſo long againſt marriage; but doth not the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth, that he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and ſentences, theſe paper bullets of the brain, awe a man from the career of his humour? No— the world muſt be peopled—When I ſaid I would die a bachelor, I did not think I ſhould live 'till I were married. Here comes Beatrice! By this day, ſhe's a fair lady—I do ſpy ſome marks of love in her.</q>

<q>Lady, what man is he you are accuſed of?</q>
Upon which paſſage Doctor Warburton makes the following judicious remark:</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>The Friar had juſt before boaſted his great ſkill in ſifting out the truth; and indeed, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in this inſtance, to have been no fool. He was by, all the while at the accuſation, and heard no names mentioned. Why, then, ſhould he aſk her what man ſhe was accuſed of? But in this lay the ſubtilty of his examination. For, had Hero been guilty, it was very probable that, in the hurry and confuſion of ſpirits into which the terrible inſult of her lover had thrown her, ſhe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0453900300:169"/>
would never have obſerved that the man's name was not mentioned; and ſo, on this queſtion, might have betrayed herſelf, by naming the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhe was conſcious of an affair with. The Friar obſerved this, and ſo concluded, that, were ſhe guilty, ſhe would probably have fallen into the trap he had laid for her. I only take notice of this, to ſhew how admirably well Shakeſpeare knew how to ſuſtain his characters.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this noble defence for the unhappy Hero, not being ſufficient to obviate the ſtrong impreſſions of her guilt, which the father had conceived againſt her, the honeſt Prieſt then goes on to propoſe a ſcheme of conduct to him, which might peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bring about ſome criſis or event, that would clear her innocence; at leaſt ſilence the infamy, and remove her from being any longer an object of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy. In this propoſal there is ſhewn a juſt knowledge of the world, and an intimate acquaintance with the ſecret movements of the human heart.</p>

                        <p>Beatrice, in ſpiriting up Benedick to avenge her couſin Hero's quarrel, thus expreſſes her reſentment againſt the offender:
<q>Is he not approved in the height a villain, that hath ſlander'd, ſcorn'd, diſhonour'd my kinſwoman! O, that I were a man! What! bear her in hand until they come to take hands, and then with public accuſation, uncover'd ſlander, unmitigated rancour— O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place. O that I were a man for his ſake! or, that I had any friend would be a man for my ſake! But manhood is melted into courteſies, valour into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones too—He is now as valiant as Hercules, that only tells a lie, and ſwears to it—I cannot be a man with wiſhing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will die a woman with grieving.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is a generous warmth of indignation in this ſpeech, which muſt certainly impreſs a female reader with the ſame ſentiments upon ſuch an occaſion. I am not ſo diſingenuous to take advantage of this paſſage as an hiſtorical fact, but am willing to reſt it upon the ſole authority of the Poet's aſſumption, as this will ſufficiently anſwer the deſign of my intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it; which is, to vindicate my ſex from the general, but unjuſt charge of being prone to ſlander; for were this the caſe, were not the reſentment of Beatrice, in this inſtance, natural, how could it move our ſympathy? which it actually does here, even though we acknowledge the circumſtance to have been merely imaginary.</p>
                        <p>I believe, that there is nothing which a woman of virtue feels herſelf more offended at, than defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſcandal; firſt againſt her own character, and proportionably when others are made the victims. There are women, indeed, who may be fond of flander, as having an intereſt in depreciating an idea of chaſtity; but this is owing to their frailty, not their ſex—Vice is neither maſculine, nor feminine; <hi>'tis the common of two.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <q>This brother Anthony is the trueſt picture ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable of human nature. He had aſſumed the character of a Sage, to comfort his brother o'er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with grief for his only daughter's affront and diſhonour; and had ſeverely reproved him for not commanding his paſſion better, on ſo try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an occaſion. Yet, immediately after this, no ſooner does he begin to ſuſpect that his age and valour are ſlighted, but he falls into the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate fit of rage himſelf; and all his brother can ſay, or do, is not of power to pacify him. This is copying Nature with a penetration and exactneſs of judgment peculiar to Shakeſpeare. As to the expreſſion, too, of his paſſion, nothing can be more highly painted.</q>

                        <p>THE Counteſs of Rouſillon ſpeaking of Helena, her Ward, ſays,
<q>I have thoſe hopes of her good, that her education promiſes her; diſpoſition ſhe inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity; they are virtues and traitors too; in her they are the better for her ſimpleneſs; ſhe derives her honeſty, and achieves her goodneſs.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Commentators are not agreed in opinion upon the <hi>verbal</hi> ſenſe of this paſſage—but no matter; I ſhall leave their criticiſm undecided, and proceed to the moral interpretation of it; which is, that a <hi>derived</hi> virtue, which implies a natural good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, affords conſiderable aſſiſtance to a good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; that accompliſhments, without ſuch a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, are a diſadvantage to the poſſeſſors, as but tending to their condemnation and reproach; that the innocence and ſimplicity of Helena's mind and heart made uſe of no arts, but left her talents to the natural effect of their own operations; and that though a good diſpoſition may be <hi>inherited,</hi> virtues muſt be <hi>purchaſed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the ſame Scene, when Bertram comes to take leave of his mother, in order to attend the king, ſhe gives him her bleſſing in a moſt pathetic manner, and the moſt effectual too, where the ſeeds of virtue are, by ſetting his noble father before him as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern. To this ſhe likewiſe adds ſome precepts for the conduct of his life, which would have done honour to the firſt Sages of Aegypt, Greece, or Rome.</p>

                        <p>THE following ſpeech, though delivered with an air of levity, and expreſſed in humorous words and images, ſupplies occaſion for three very juſt reflections. The firſt, That <hi>ſelf intereſt,</hi> in the mere worldly ſenſe of the term, is the ruling prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of mankind. Secondly, That men are too apt to inveigh againſt corruption, more from the being void of temptation themſelves, than their being free from this vice; and, laſtly, That bad examples in the ſuperior ranks of life, have a dangerous tendency to injure the morals of the inferior claſſes of a people.</p>
                        <p>Upon a peace being made between the kings of England and France, in which the right of Arthur to the Britiſh throne is betrayed on the one hand, and but poorly compenſated on the other, Faulcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge makes this ſoliloquy:

Sorrow ſoftens the mind, while it is yet warmed by hope; but hardens it, when 'tis congealed by deſpair. Diſtreſs, while there remains any proſpect of relief, is weak and flexible; but when no ſuccour appears, is fearleſs

                           <l>Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale,</l>
                           <l>Vexing the dull ear of a drowſy man.</l>

                        <p>This may be a juſt image of life, to thoſe who have exhauſted its variety, and palled their ſenſes with its pleaſures. The ſpeech might not have ill become his father, old Philip, then labouring under baffled hopes and diſappointed wiſhes; who had juſt then ſuffered the mortification of having loſt a battle, in the heart of his own dominions, and whoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken faith in heaven had obliged him to break faith on earth, without effect too; but it was certainly rather too premature a ſentence to have proceeded from the lips of a young prince, who had been but juſt married to a woman he loved. Such an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in the character of a ſpeaker, hurts the effect of a thought or ſentiment.</p>
                        <p>In the ſame Scene, there is a ſtrong deſcription given of the ſituation of a ſovereign, with regard to the people, after he has forfeited their love, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or eſteem.</p>

                        <p>When the King ſentences theſe two champions to exile, he exacts an oath from them both, not to be reconciled to one another abroad, ſo far as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate againſt the ſtate of England; in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtering of which bond, he deſires them to
<q>
                              <l>Swear by the duty that you owe to Heaven. . . . .</l>
                              <l>Our part therein we baniſh with yourſelves.</l>

                        </p>
                        <p>Upon which latter line Doctor Warburton gives the following note:</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>It is a queſtion much debated among the writers on the <hi>Law of Nations,</hi> whether a baniſhed man be ſtill tied in allegiance to the ſtate which ſent him into exile. Tully and Clarendon declare for the affirmative: Hobbes and Puffendorf hold
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0453900300:203"/>
the negative. Our Author, by this line, ſeems to be of the latter opinion.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But I agree intirely with Cicero and Clarendon. The undergoing any penalty of law cannot diſſolve either the moral or the political duty we owe our country. Socrates, by refuſing to eſcape out of priſon, ſhewed, that he thought his obedience and ſubmiſſion to the ſtate continued ſtill to be obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory on him, even though the decree was unjuſt, and the ſentence death. And under the <hi>Oſtraciſm,</hi> which impoſed baniſhment upon men for their very eminence and virtue, we do not hear of the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exiles either ſpeaking, or acting, as if they deemed their allegiance to have been cancelled.</p>
                        <p>Nay, Ariſtides carried the ſubmiſſion of a good ſubject ſo far, as to think himſelf obliged in duty to write his own name on a <hi>ſhell,</hi> at the requeſt of an illiterate citizen of Athens, who voted againſt him on that very law. And Themiſtocles, though baniſhed through the ſpirit of faction, not that of the laws, and kindly entertained and preferred in the armies of Perſia, choſe to ſwallow poiſon, rather than march againſt his country.</p>
                        <p>'Tis not the community that baniſhes a man, but the laws which govern it.</p>
                        <q>"It is the law, not I, condemns your brother <note n="*" place="bottom">Angelo to Iſabella. <hi>Meaſure for Meaſure.</hi>
                           </note>.</q>
                        <p>Theſe ſurely are no object of reſentment; and to riſe in arms againſt a nation, becauſe one of its ſtatutes had fallen heavy upon us, would be juſt as rational, as to ſet a foreſt on fire, becauſe we had received the baſtinado by a cudgel that was taken out of it.</p>

                        <p>Upon which paſſage there is the following reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the note by Doctor Johnſon:</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>It is matter of very melancholy conſideration, that all human advantages confer more power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, than good.</q>
A very melancholy reflection, indeed, were we to ſuppoſe it true!</p>
                        <p>In the inſtance before us, the hand of power, ſtrength, or treachery, may certainly deprive us of a life, which it cannot reſtore; but Shakeſpeare does not mean to make the reflection univerſal. A good Prince may render his whole people happy; a bad one can only affect a part. When tyranny becomes general, it defeats itſelf, at the coſt of the oppreſſor.</p>
                        <p>If my objection to the above uncomfortable maxim be valid, in the higheſt example, it would be trifling to adduce any leſſer ones to prove it.</p>

                        <p>There are undoubtedly certain notices, or premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, in the order of Providence, which mankind have been frequently ſenſible of; ſometimes from dreams, at other times from unaccountable impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on the mind, foreboding particular misfortunes of our lives, let philoſophy reaſon againſt the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ever ſo wiſely.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, there appears one argument to oppoſe this opinion, which, in any indifferent caſe, might be thought ſufficiently able to overthrow it; which is, that ſuch hints rarely, if ever, have been found to anſwer any other purpoſe, than to render us unhappy before our time.</p>
                        <p>But matter of fact is not to be controverted by ſyllogiſm. The objection only ſerves to reſolve it into a myſtery, and leaves it ſtill uninveſtigable by human ſcience.

                              <l>Of vapours, that did ſeem to ſtrangle him.</l>

                        <p>The nobleneſs of Hotſpur's character is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably ſuſtained throughout this Play. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſpeech ſhews a fine part of it:

                              <l>Well ſaid, my noble Scot. If ſpeaking truth,</l>

                              <l>The tongues of ſoothers; but a braver place,</l>
                              <l>In my heart's love, hath no man than yourſelf—</l>
                              <l>Nay, taſk me to my word; approve me, lord.</l>

                        <p>The precarious and critical ſituation of unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable and hazardous undertakings, is well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon in the following paſſage of the ſame Scene, when the conſpirators are informed that Northumberland is prevented by ſickneſs from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the rendez-vous:

But, indeed, this reflection may more generally be applied to every ſpecies of vice; for in guilt there can be no peace within, nor confidence without.</p>

                     <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
                     <p>I thought that my taſk was done with this Play, when I had got to the end of it; but there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo very great, ſingular, and attractive, in the two principal characters of this hiſtoric piece, that I find a pleaſure in keeping them ſtill in view, and contemplating them both in my mind.</p>
                     <p>Whenever Hotſpur or the Prince <hi>filled the Scene,</hi> which they are either of them, ſingly, ſufficient to do, I confeſs that my heart was ſenſible of ſuch an emotion, as Sir Philip Sidney ſaid he uſed to be affected with, on a peruſal of the old Ballad of Chevy-Chaſe; <hi>as if he had heard the ſound of a trumpet.</hi> Perhaps the following obſervation may better account for my impulſe:</p>
                     <p>Women are apt to eſteem the <hi>antient virtue</hi> of courage at an higher rate than men in general are; and this, for theſe two eſpecial reaſons. The firſt, that it is peculiarly neceſſary to their perſonal defence; and the next, that their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs induces them to form a ſublimer notion of this quality, than the ſtronger, and therefore braver, ſex may naturally be ſuppoſed to compliment it with. Men, feeling the principles of it in their own breaſts, conceive no very ſupernatural idea of it; while
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0453900300:237"/>
women, having no ſuch premiſſes to reaſon from, look on it as ſomething more than human.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reflections, with the frequent occaſions I have had, thoughout this Play, of comparing the two heroes of it with each other, have tempted me to undertake a Parallel between them, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Plutarch; which, however, I did not mean to have given the Reader, as hinted above, 'till I ſhould come to the end of the ſecond Play after this, where our Author has concluded all he had to ſay about Henry the Fifth.</p>
                     <p>But as Shakeſpeare has opened enough of this Prince's character, here, to ſupply ſufficient materials for the compariſon, and that his unfortunate rival is juſt ſlain, I thought the Parallel might have a better effect on the mind of my Readers, in this place, than it would be likely to produce after the delay had ſuffered the impreſſion of Hotſpur's qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to wear out of their remembrance.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="excursus">
                     <head>A PARALLEL BETWEEN HOTSPUR, AND HENRY PRINCE OF WALES.</head>
                     <p>THEY are both equally brave; but the courage of Hotſpur has a greater portion of fierceneſs in it— The Prince's magnanimity is more heroic. The firſt reſembles Achilles; the latter is more like Hector. The different principles, too, of their actions help to form and juſtify this diſtinction; as the one <hi>invades,</hi> and the other <hi>defends,</hi> a right. Hotſpur ſpeaks nobly of his rival Dowglas, to his face, but after he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his friend; the Prince does the ſame of Hotſpur, behind his back, and while he is ſtill his enemy.</p>
                     <p>They both of them poſſeſs a ſportive vein of humour in their ſcenes of common life; but Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpur ſtill preſerves the ſurly and refractory haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his character, throughout, even in the relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0453900300:238"/>
he indulges himſelf in. The Prince has more of eaſe and nature in his; delivering himſelf over to mirth and diſſipation, without reſerve. Hotſpur's feſtivity ſeems to reſemble that of Hamlet; as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed merely to relieve anxiety of mind, and cover ſanguinary purpoſes; the Prince's gaiety, like that of Faulconbridge <note n="*" place="bottom">In King John.</note>, appears to be more genuine, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from natural temper, and an healthful flow of ſpirits. The Prince is Alcibiades—Percy is—him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>There is likewiſe another character in this rich Play, of a moſt peculiar diſtinction; as being not only <hi>original,</hi> but <hi>inimitable,</hi> alſo—No copy of it has ever ſince appeared, either in life or deſcription. Any one of the Dramatis Perſonae in Congreve's Comedies, or, indeed, in moſt of the modern ones, might repeat the wit or humour of the ſeparate parts, with equal effect on the audience, as the perſon to whoſe rôle they are appropriated; but there is a certain characteriſtic peculiarity in all the humour of Falſtaff, that would ſound flatly in the mouths of Bardolph, Poins, or Peto. In fine, the portrait of this extraordinary perſonage is delineated by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly a hand, that we may venture to pronounce it to be the only one that ever afforded ſo high a degree of pleaſure, without the leaſt pretence to merit or virtue to ſupport it.</p>
                     <p>I was obliged to paſs by many of his ſtrokes of humour, character, and deſcription, becauſe they did not fall within the rule I had preſcribed to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in theſe notes; but I honeſtly confeſs that it was with regret, whenever I did ſo; for, were there as much moral, as there certainly is phyſical, good in laughing, I might have tranſcribed every Scene of his, throughout this, the following Play, and the Merry Wives of Windſor, for the advantage of the health, as well as the entertainment, of my readers.</p>

                        <p>The delicacy of the Prince's difficulty upon this occaſion, in not being able to manifeſt the concern he was really ſenſible of for his father's illneſs, leſt, from the former complexion of his life and manners, he might be ſuſpected of inſincerity in ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, muſt have a fine effect on the ſentiment of a reader who is poſſeſſed of the leaſt refinement of principle or virtue.</p>
                        <p>A moſt uſeful leſſon might be framed, upon the very ſingular character of this amiable perſon. The pattern is not perfect; and therefore—ſhall I venture to ſay it? the example is the better, for that reaſon. His manners are idle, but his morals uncorrupt. He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Falſtaff to make as free with him as he pleaſes, but breaks his head, as Mrs. Quickly tells us in a former Scene, for his having thrown out a jeſt upon his father. Young men may learn from him never to be guilty of more vice, than the temptation to it might precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them into. He connives at the robbery of his companions, for the diverſion of playing the ſame game upon them, again; but reſolves to make ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution for the wrong <note n="†" place="bottom">See the laſt Scene of Act II, in the firſt part of this Play.</note>. He offends his father by the diſſoluteneſs of his conduct; but his filial affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſpect are ſtill unremitted towards him. He ſhews a ſpirit of juſtice in injuſtice, and of duty, even in diſobedience.</p>
                        <p>I here offer this comment as a ſupplement to the character I have already drawn of this Prince, at the end of the former Play. I could not have fairly added it there, as any thing that did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately relate to the compariſon between him and Hotſpur, would have been improperly introduced in the Parallel.</p>

                              <l>We would not ſeek a battle, as we are,</l>

                        </p>
                        <p>There is ſomething extremely fine in Henry's reply to the French gaſconading taunt above. It is uncommon to meet with ſo much careleſsneſs and courage in the ſame character—There is no ſuch deſcription in hiſtory, nor have many people, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, ever been acquainted with it among the living manners of men; and yet the repreſentation of it appears to be ſo perfectly natural, that we muſt greatly admire the talents of a writer, who could thus realize, in effect, a mere idea.</p>
                        <p>The bravery of Henry ſcorned to deny the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his troops, either with regard to their health or numbers: theſe circumſtances the enemy pretended to have been acquainted with already, or were determined to make an experiment of, at leaſt; he therefore openly acknowledges the truth of his weak ſituation; and this with the ſame eaſe and humour, as he would have delivered himſelf to Falſtaff, had he been his aid-du-camp for the day.
<q>
                              <l>Upon his royal face there is no note,</l>
                              <l>How dread an army have enrounded him <note n="*" place="bottom">Chorus to Act IV.</note>;</l>
                           </q>
But, at the ſame time, he moſt reſolutely declares his purpoſe of trying the event; at every hazard of life, claim, and liberty.</p>
                        <p>The contemptuous ſarcaſms he throws out, in this ſpeech, againſt the French nation, beſides ſhewing an admirable temper and compoſure of mind in ſuch difficult circumſtances, convey alſo an apt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partee to the ſcornful inſolence of the Dauphin; who, in return to Henry's demanding his right of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the crown of France, ſent him a parcel of tennis-balls to play with, in alluſion to the ſlight repute of his former life and manners, Pertneſs is impertinence; but repartee has the <hi>lex talionis,</hi> or law of retaliation, on its ſide.</p>

                           <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0453900300:274"/>Shakeſpeare has a great reſemblance to Arioſto, whoſe ſtile had a mixture of humour, with ſublimity in it. The late ingenious Mr. Hawkins ſays of the latter,

                                 <p>No; nor is it meet he ſhould; for, though I ſpeak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I am—The violet ſmells to him, as it doth to me; all his ſenſes have but human conditions. His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedneſs he appears but a man; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet when they ſtoop, they ſtoop with the like wing; therefore, when he ſees reaſon of fears, as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the ſame reliſh as ours are; yet in reaſon no man ſhould poſſeſs him with any appearance of fear, leſt he, by ſhewing it, ſhould diſhearten his army.</p>

                                 <p>He may ſhew what outward courage he will; but, I believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wiſh himſelf in the Thames up to the neck; and ſo I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, ſo we were quit here.</p>

                                 <p>I dare ſay you love him not ſo ill to wiſh him here alone, however you ſpeak this to feel other men's minds. Methinks, I could not die any where ſo contented, as in the king's company; his cauſe being juſt, and his quarrel honourable.</p>
                              </sp>
                              <sp>

                                 <p>Ay, or more than we ſhould ſeek after; for we know enough, if we know we are the king's ſubjects; if his cauſe be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us.</p>
                              </sp>
                              <sp>

                                 <p>But if the cauſe be not good, the king himſelf hath a heavy reckoning to make; when all thoſe legs, and arms, and heads, chopped off in a battle, ſhall join together at the latter day, and cry all, <hi>we died at ſuch a place</hi>; ſome ſwearing, ſome crying for a ſurgeon, ſome upon their wives left poor behind them, ſome upon the debts they owe, ſome upon their children rawly left. I am afeared there are few die well, that fall in battle; for how can they charitably diſpoſe of any thing, when blood is their argument? Now, if theſe men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the king, that led them to it, whom to diſobey were againſt all proportion of ſubjection.</p>
                              </sp>
                              <sp>
                                 <speaker>Henry.</speaker>
                                 <p>So, if a ſon that is ſent by his father about merchandize, do fall into ſome lewd action, and miſcarry, the imputation of his wickedneſs, by your rule, ſhould be impoſed upon the father that ſent him; or, if a ſervant under his maſter's command, tranſporting a ſum of money, be aſſailed by robbers, and die in many irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled iniquities, you may call the buſineſs of the matter the author of the ſervant's damnation. But this is not ſo—The king is not bound to anſwer the particular endings of his ſoldiers, the father of his ſon, nor the maſter of his ſervant; for they purpoſe not their deaths, when they purpoſe their ſervices. Beſides, there is no king, be his cauſe never ſo ſpotleſs, if it come to the arbitrament of ſwords, can try it with all unſpotted ſoldiers. Some, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder; ſome of beguiling virgins with the broken ſeals of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; ſome making the wars their bulwark, that have before gored the gentle boſom of peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if theſe men have defeated the law, and out-run native puniſhment, <hi>though they can cut-ſtrip men, they have no wings to fly from God.</hi> War is his beadle, war is his vengeance; ſo that herein men are puniſhed, for before-breach of the king's law, in the king's quarrel
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0453900300:277"/>
now—Where they feared death, they have borne life away; and where they would be ſafe, they periſh. Then, if they die unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, no more is the king guilty of their damnation, than he was before guilty of thoſe impieties for which they are now viſited. Every ſubject's duty is the king's, but every ſubject's ſoul is his own. Therefore ſhould every ſoldier, in the wars, do as every ſick man, in his bed, waſh every moth out of his conſcience; and, dying ſo, death is to him an advantage; or, not dying, the time was bleſſedly loſt, wherein ſuch preparation was gained; and to him that eſcapes, it were not ſin to think that, making God ſo free an offer, he let him out-live that day to ſee his greatneſs, and to teach others how they ſhould prepare.</p>

                        <p>The Poet has moſt judiciouſly interrupted Henry's ſpeech, in this critical place. It would have been expected from him to have ſaid ſomething more, upon ſo intereſting an occaſion; and yet it would have been impoſſible to have carried either ſentiment or expreſſion higher than Exeter had juſt done, on the ſame ſubject. Shakeſpeare has herein imitated the addreſs of Timanthes, who, in his picture of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Iphigenia, covers her father's head with a veil.</p>

                        <p>The firſt ſentence in the above ſpeech, is one among the many inſtances in which Shakeſpeare has manifeſted his thorough knowledge in human nature. Henry acts with an heroic reſolution during the whole of this perilous conflict, and replies with a daring and careleſs ſpirit to all the inſolence and contempt of a powerful enemy; but he expreſſes no rage, nor betrays the leaſt manner of reſentment, throughout. The dangers and difficulties of his ſituation required the utmoſt command and preſervation of his temper. Diſtreſs and affliction are ſovereign ſpecifics for the pride and fierceneſs of man's nature. But theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints being now removed, by his victory, he begins to yield the rein a little to paſſion, upon ſeeing the obſtinacy of the enemy ſtill continuing after their defeat.</p>

Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak liſt of a country's faſhion—We are the makers of manners, Kate; and the liberty <note n="†" place="bottom">The privileges, or authority of ſuperior rank.</note> that follows our places, ſtops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will do yours for the upholding the nice faſhion of your country, in denying me a kiſs—Therefore—patiently, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing— <stage>[Kiſſing her.]</stage>
You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate; there is more eloquence in a touch of them, than in all the tongues of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0453900300:293"/>
the French council; and they would ſooner perſwade Harry of England, than a general petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.</p>
                           </sp>
                        </q>
                        <p>In the laſt paſſage of the foregoing dialogue, Henry affords a good ſubject for reflection, where he ſpeaks of the powerful influence of kings over the manners of a people. The maxim appears to be plauſible, but is not true, in every reſpect. <hi>Rank and example</hi> alone, will not be ſufficient for this effect, unſupported by <hi>dignity and precept.</hi> It is not enough for a prince to act well himſelf, and intend well to morals—He muſt form a purpoſe for their ſupport, and be active in his general, as well as private, capacity. A ſovereign, indeed, has it in his power, whenever it is in his will, moſt effectually to encourage virtue, and diſcourage vice, if he chuſes to make this object the rule of his polity. This would be the ſureſt and ſafeſt method of rendering himſelf abſolute; for as poor Cardinal Wolſey ſays—upon a maxim too late diſcovered—
<q>"Corruption wins not more than honeſty."</q>
Religion itſelf has judged it neceſſary to hold out diſtant rewards and puniſhments, to allure and deter mankind, and kings can only have a right to be ſtiled the vice-gerents of Heaven, when they render theſe ſanctions more immediate. A king is ſaid to have long hands; but they are of no uſe except to wrap himſelf up, <hi>while he keeps them folded.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Lewis the Fourteenth happily brought ſuch a <hi>golden age</hi> to bear, toward the latter part of his il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious reign, if we may give credit to what St. Evremond ſays, in a letter of his to Ninon de l'Enclos.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>You live in a country where people have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary advantages towards ſaving their ſouls. There, vice is almoſt as much againſt the faſhion, as againſt virtue. Sinning paſſes for ill-breeding; ſhocks decency, and offends good manners, as much as religion. Formerly, it ſufficed to be
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0453900300:294"/>
wicked; but, at preſent, one muſt be a ſcoundrel, to be damned, in France. They who have not regard enough for another life, are led to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the conſideration and duties of this.</q>

Juſt ſuch a prince, whoſe very goodneſs, for want of ſenſe and ſpirit, muſt ever render the dupe of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and the ſport of Faction.</p>

This ſpeaks to the heart, as well as to the underſtanding. We then ſee things and actions in their true light, which the falſe glare of gain or pleaſure, or the involved and complicated nature of ſin, are but too apt to hide from our notice. Vice would diſguſt even thoſe that practiſe it, if they did not uſe arts to conceal the vileneſs of it from their own view. We drink liquors out of a cup, which are too foul to bear a glaſs.</p>
                        <p>He who has betrayed a friend, deceived a miſtreſs, wronged the orphan, or oppreſſed the poor, muſt ſurely never have ſeen a penitent on his death-bed! What deſperate madneſs, then, muſt it be, ever to do a deed, for any advantage in life, which after ſo ſhort—<hi>ſo very ſhort</hi>—a ſpace of time, we would give a galaxy of worlds to have undone again!</p>

                  <p>MR. Theobald ſuſpects the three parts of this Drama to be ſpurious, on account of ſome obſolete expreſſions in them, <hi>alder-lieveſt, unneath, mailed, me-ſeemeth, darraign, exigent, a-brook,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Theobald does not enumerate the words, but I have taken this taſk upon me, in order to give the fulleſt force to his criticiſm. The Antients have left us an humane maxim, <hi>that we ſhould never ſpeak ill of the dead.</hi> I think we ſhould carry this moral even further, <hi>by doing them every juſtice in our power.</hi> What has particularly induced me to make this remark, is, that Doctor Johnſon ſays he can obſerve but two expreſſions of the old phraſeology, throughout theſe three Plays. I do not mean to make any compariſon between the ſenſe, knowledge, or litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe two critics; but Dr. Johnſon is alive, to anſwer for himſelf, and poor Theobald muſt now ſpeak by another's tongue.</note>; and Doctor Warburton is of the ſame opinion, from the want of ſpirit and effect in the compoſition. If I was to offer an objection to the authenticity of theſe Pieces, it ſhould be rather from their barrenneſs of ſentiment, or reflection; though I think there is enough of the ſtile and manner of Shakeſpeare, in them all, to evince them to be his.</p>

a king, and yet not the leſs fit to be the latter, <hi>for this very reaſon,</hi> replies with philoſophy and virtue to the perſon who is going to take him priſoner, and who aſks him,

                        <p>EVERY repreſentation, either of a ſcene or ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of peace, is peculiarly ſoothing to the human mind. 'Tis its own moſt natural and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate. But when it is contraſted with the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite condition of tumult and war, the delight riſes infinitely higher. There are many ſuch deſcriptions as this in Shakeſpeare; and as the imbuing the mind with ſuch contemplations, muſt certainly have a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency in it, I am glad to tranſcribe every paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the kind I meet with in him.</p>

                        <p>This long Scene, in which Richard courts Lady Anne, relict of the firſt Prince of Wales, ſon to Henry the Sixth, whom he had murdered, is ſo well known to every one who has ever read or ſeen this Play, that I need not be at the trouble of tranſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, though I ſhall take the liberty of remarking on the very improbable concluſion of it.</p>
                        <p>Women are certainly moſt extremely ill uſed, in the unnatural repreſentation of female frailty, here given. But it may, perhaps, be ſome palliation of his offence, to obſerve that this ſtrange fable was not any invention of the poet; though it muſt indeed be confeſſed that he yielded too eaſy a credence to a fictitious piece of hiſtory, which reſted upon no better authority than the ſame that affirmed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Richard; which fact has lately, from a concurrence of cotemporary teſtimonies, been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

problematical at leaſt, by a learned and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious author <note n="*" place="bottom">See a Tract upon this ſubject, by the Honourable Horatio Walpole.</note>.</p>
                        <p>The concluſion of the Fifth Scene of Act the Fourth, in this Play, where the Queen, widow of Edward the Fourth, after the death of Lady Anne, promiſes her daughter to this tyrant and uſurper, who had killed her ſons, is founded likewiſe upon the ſame diſingenuous authority with the two former paſſages.</p>

                        <p>Now nothing can demonſtrate the inveſtigating faculties of Shakeſpeare, more than this paſſage does. He never lived in any times of commotion himſelf, therefore the particular knowledge he here ſhews, in the general nature of ſuch a criſis, muſt be owing more to philoſophy than experience; rather to his own reflection, than any knowledge of hiſtory. I ſpeak with regard to the Engliſh writers only, on ſuch ſubjects; who were all, before his time, moſt barren of obſervation and maxim.

                        <p>Could any writer but Shakeſpeare have ever thought of ſuch a circumſtance, in the midſt of a deep tragedy, as the ſending an old grave Biſhop on an errand for a <hi>leaf of ſtrawberries?</hi> and this, in the moſt formal ſcene of the Play too, where the lords are met in council, to ſettle about the day for the corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                        <p>But could any writer but himſelf have attempted ſuch a whim, without ſetting the audience a-laughing at the ridiculouſneſs and abſurdity of ſuch an inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? And yet he contrives, ſome-how or other, to hold us in awe, all the while; though he muſt be a very ingenious critic, indeed, who can ſupply any ſort of reaſon for the introduction of ſuch a familiar and comic ſtroke, upon ſo ſerious an occaſion. And
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0453900300:324"/>
what renders the ſolution of this paſſage ſtill more difficult, is, that the requeſt is made by a perſon, too, whoſe mind was deeply intent on murder and uſurpation, at the very time.</p>
                        <p>None of the editors have taken the leaſt notice of this article; and the firſt notion that occurred to me upon it, was, that perhaps Richard wanted to get rid of old Ely, after any manner, however indecent or abrupt, in order to be at liberty to plot with Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham in private; for the moment the Biſhop goes out on his errand, he ſays,
<q>Couſin of Buckingham, a word with you.</q>
But as he did not ſend the reſt of the Council-Board a-packing after him, and adjourn them from <hi>the bed of juſtice</hi> to the <hi>ſtrawberry bed,</hi> but retires immediately himſelf with his complotter Buckingham, we cannot ſuppoſe this idea to have been the purpoſe intended by ſo extraordinary a motion.</p>
                        <p>There is, then, no other way left us to reſolve this text, than to impute it ſolely to the peculiar cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter that Shakeſpeare has given us all along of this extraordinary perſonage; whom he has repreſented throughout, as preſerving a facetious humour, and exerting a ſort of careleſs eaſe, in the midſt of all his crimes.</p>
                        <p>I am ſorry not to be able to give a better account of this particular, than what I have here offered; becauſe, if it is to reſt upon ſuch a comment, our author muſt, in this inſtance, be thought to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed a manifeſt ignorance in human nature, or the nature of guilt at leaſt; as no vicious perſon, I do not mean thoſe of profligate manners merely, but no deſigning or determined villain was ever chearful, yet, or could poſſibly be able to aſſume even the ſemblance of careleſſneſs or eaſe, upon any occaſion whatſoever.</p>

                        <p>But the circumſtance which moſt eminently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes both of theſe crimes from every other ſpecies of guilt, is their being ſo wholly repugnant to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In other vices, we may ſuffer a temptation, and have only a moral ſtruggle to conquer; but one muſt be trained, be <hi>educated</hi> to theſe, muſt ſtifle ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and overcome our <hi>firſt,</hi> by a <hi>ſecond</hi> nature.</p>
                        <p>And of all murders, from the days of <hi>Herod</hi> to theſe, the killing a child muſt ſurely raiſe a ſtronger war in the moſt hardened villain's breaſt, than the ſlaughter of an adult. Its innocence, its engaging manners, even its very helpleſſneſs, muſt plead ſo movingly in its defence, as to render the deed, one ſhould think, impoſſible! Might not the idea of a

                     <p>In this Scene, the adverſe camps are ſuppoſed to be pitched near each other at night, ready to join battle in the morning; and in the ſpace between, the ſpirits of all the perſons murdered by <hi>Richard</hi> ariſe, threatening deſtruction to him, and promiſing ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to <hi>Richmond.</hi> But the ghoſts here are not to be taken literally; they are to be underſtood only as an allegorical repreſentation of thoſe images or ideas which naturally occur to the minds of men during their ſleep, referring to the actions of their lives, whether good or bad.</p>

                        <q>Sweet are the ſlumbers of the virtuous man,</q>
ſays Addiſon, in his Cato; and a modern writer, in a poem on the ſubject of dreams, moſt emphatically expreſſes himſelf thus:
<q>
                           <l>Nor are the oppreſſor's crimes in ſleep forgot;</l>
                           <l>He ſtarts appalled, <hi>for conſcience ſlumbers not</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>That this is the ſenſe in which our Poet meant this ſcene to be accepted, is fully evident from his repreſenting both <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Richmond</hi> to have been aſleep during the apparition, and therefore capable

of receiving thoſe notices in <hi>the mind</hi>'s <hi>eye</hi> only, as Hamlet ſays; which intirely removes the ſeeming abſurdity of ſuch an exhibition.</p>
                     <p>The ſoliloquy of ſelf-accuſation, which Richard enters upon alone, immediately after the ſpectral viſion is cloſed, though ſo ſtrongly marked, is nothing more than might be ſuppoſed natural, in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and ſituation of the ſpeaker, as there deſcribed.</p>

Body may be overcome by body, but the mind only can conquer itſelf. Notions of religion are natural to all men, in ſome ſort or other. The good are inſpired by devotion, the bad terrified by ſuperſtition. The admonitions of conſcience are taken for ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural emotions, and this awes us more than any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in the common courſe of things. Man has been ſeverally defined a <hi>riſible,</hi> a <hi>rational,</hi> a <hi>religious,</hi> and a <hi>baſhful</hi> animal.

                        <p>There is an excellent leſſon for kings, given in this place, as well as in many other paſſages of Shakeſpeare. The honour and ſafety of princes are ſo much confided to the ſenſe and conduct of their Miniſters, that ſuch truſtees for the State ſhould be ever ſelected with the niceſt judgment and ſtricteſt impartiality; in which choice, virtue ſhould be at leaſt <hi>equally</hi> regarded with talents. Were the crown teſtamentary, a ſovereign ſhould be circumſpect to whoſe hands he intruſted the government of his people, even after his death; and how much more ſolicitous ought he to be, with reſpect to thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to rule, while his own glory and intereſt lie ſo immediately at ſtake!</p>
                        <p>The great <hi>Condé</hi> complimented <hi>Corneille</hi>'s Play of <hi>Cinna,</hi> by ſtiling it <hi>The Breviary of Kings</hi>—I think that many of Shakeſpeare's pieces much better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that name. But, indeed, his writings may well

                        <p>The character of Queen Catharine is finely drawn in this Play. A becoming demeanour is preſerved
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0453900300:339"/>
throughout every ſituation and circumſtance ſhe is placed in. She diſcovers that dignity and ſpirit which become the wife and daughter of a king, ſhews the duty and obedience which a huſband and a ſovereign have a right to claim, and ſpeaks, on her own part, with ſuch a noble confidence, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured innocence may fully warrant. One can never be too much aſſured, in a juſt cauſe, either of their own, or of others; for whoever defends the rights of the oppreſſed, fights under the banner of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

                        <p>The preſent Scene preſents us with a ſecond ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of compaſſion, which though it intereſts us after a different manner from the former, as neither being ſo innocent, nor ſuffering ſo unjuſtly; yet, ſhall I hazard the expreſſion? affects us almoſt as much. We do not, indeed, feel our minds impreſſed with ſuch a tender ſenſibility towards the latter, as the firſt; but, for the honour and dignity of human nature, let me ſay, that our commiſeration, in the ſecond caſe, ariſes from principles of a nobler kind; from our forgiveneſs of the penitent, and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for his misfortunes, ſoftened ſtill more by our ſorrow for his guilt: ſo that, upon the whole, the generoſity of our ſentiment, in one inſtance, nearly equals the ſympathy of it, in the other.</p>
                        <p>The true ſupputation of the precariouſneſs and inſtability of all worldly happineſs and greatneſs, with the fit temper and reſignation to bear their loſs, are moſt pathetically and poetically ſet forth, in the following beautiful and affecting ſcene.</p>

                              <l>Farewel, a long farewel, to all my greatneſs!</l>
                              <l>This is the ſtate of man—To-day he puts forth</l>
                              <l>The tender leaves of hopes, to-morrow bloſſoms,</l>
                              <l>And bears his bluſhing honours thick upon him;</l>
                              <l>The third day comes a froſt, a killing froſt,</l>
                              <l>And when he thinks, good eaſy man, full ſurely</l>

                              <l>I feel my heart new opened—Oh, how wretched</l>

                  <p>IT may be neceſſary to many Readers to premiſe, that the Piece here under conſideration, is the Play as originally written by Shakeſpeare, left the bearing it in mind as altered by <hi>Tate,</hi> and generally acted ſo, might occaſion confuſion or miſtakes, in the following notes and obſervations.</p>
                  <p>The Critics are divided in their opinions between the original and the altered copy. Some prefer the firſt, as a more general repreſentation of human life, where fraud too often ſucceeds, and innocence ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers: others prefer the latter, as a more moral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of what life ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>But argument in this, as in many other caſes, had better be left quite out of the queſtion; for our feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are often a ſurer guide than our reaſon; and by this criterion I may venture to pronounce, that the reader or ſpectator will always be better pleaſed with the happy, than the unfortunate, cataſtrophe of innocence and virtue.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if Dramatic exhibitions are deſigned, as they certainly ſhould be, to recommend virtue and diſcourage vice, there cannot remain the leaſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſpute in our minds, whether Shakeſpeare or Tate have fulfilled Horace's precept of <hi>utile dulci</hi> the beſt. However, if <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>terror,</hi> as the Critics ſay, are the principal objects of Tragedy, ſurely no Play that ever was written can poſſibly anſwer both theſe ends better than this performance, as it ſtands in the preſent text.</p>
                  <p>The Reader, I hope, will not think that I have exceeded the <hi>line</hi> I had preſcribed to myſelf, in the conduct of this Work, by my hazarding the above criticiſm, as the ſubject may be ſtill conſidered as of

a moral nature or tendency, and may, therefore, not improperly be conſorted with the reſt of my remarks upon this eſtimable author.</p>

                        <p>This is a fine deſcription of a parent's diſtributive juſtice, in the diviſion of a fortune between his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

                        <p>I ſpeak here with regard to conduct; of principle only, and not of affection; for 'tis often impoſſible for the moſt virtuous or impartial parent to refrain from loving one child better than another.

But then it ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, whether the inſtances of abdication had been prompted by any of the principles above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or no; for mere fits of devotion, or diſguſt, are ſeldom long or ſtrong enough, to ſupport the mind under ſuch a dereliction.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, habit is a moſt powerful thing; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons uſed to occupation of any kind, are apt to feel an irkſome vacuity and wearineſs in themſelves, with an oppreſſive tediouſneſs of time lying on their hands, whenever they ceaſe from employment. This has been the confeſſion of all the merchants, lawyers, farmers, and phyſicians, I have ever known, or heard of, who had retired from their profeſſions, or quitted their ordinary ſcenes of action, late in life. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, therefore, ſuch an experiment is attempted, it ſhould ariſe from a <hi>principle,</hi> not from a <hi>preference</hi>; becauſe the choice muſt be ventured upon, before the compariſon can be tried.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>But, indeed, what was there left for her to ſay, after ſuch hyperbolical profeſſions as had been juſt made before her? However, I dare pronounce, that any reader, who is at all acquainted with human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without looking any further into the ſtory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the preſent ſcene, muſt have already determined the point in his own mind, which of the daughter's duties or affections were moſt to be relied upon.</p>
                        <p>No paſſion can either bear or juſtify exaggeration, but love alone. There the extravagance of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and the enthuſiaſm of devotement, prove the

                           <hi>luxuriance</hi> of the ſoil; but in every other inſtance, betray the <hi>ſterility</hi> of it. There is, in reality, no other paſſion in the human breaſt, but love. All other affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſuch as avarice, duty, envy, revenge, or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, ariſe from ſome foreign ſentiment, are founded on principle, or inſtigated by vice or pride. Theſe we may be educated, tempted, or provoked to; but the former is a ſpontaneous and involuntary impulſe of the ſoul, a certain attractive force, that can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be dictated to us by moral, nor reſtrained by document.</p>

                        <p>When they have arrived near the hovel, Lear changes his purpoſe, on account of a reaſon he afterwards gives, regarding the diſtracted ſtate of his mind; and being preſſed by Kent, who juſt then joins him, to take ſhelter from the outrage of the night, he cries,
<q>Let me alone.</q>
And being intreated, a ſecond time, he repeats the ſame anſwer. But upon being further urged by the kind earneſtneſs of his poor ſervant, which Kent ſtill preſerves the appearance of, he then exclaims, with emotion,
<q>Wilt break my heart?</q>

                        <p>How truly affecting is this ſhort expoſtulation, if quickly conceived?

But it was the inſtantaneous compariſon between the barbarity of his own daughters, which had reduced him to ſuch a wretched condition, and the humanity of a common alien kindly preſſing him to a ſhelter from it, that ſo ſuddenly ſtruck and affected his mind, at that moment—This thought, indeed, might well be ſaid to <hi>break his heart</hi>; and to have added a ſingle word more, to explain this ſentiment, would have marred the whole beauty of the paſſage.</p>

                           <pb n="363" facs="tcp:0453900300:369"/>Upon Kent's ſtill continuing his entreaty, he ſtill refuſes to comply, but reaſons with him thus:

                              <l>Invades us to the ſkin—So 'tis to thee—</l>
                              <l>But where the greater malady is fixt,</l>

                              <l>But if thy flight lay toward the roaring ſea,</l>
                              <l>Thou'dſt meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's free,</l>

                        <p>This thought is beautifully expreſſed, in an old Elegy written on the good biſhop Boulter, who died Primate of Ireland, ſome years ago:

Ventidius, who comes to thank him for his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to repay the debt,

                        </p>
                        <p>But to return to our former Scene—When Timon aſks the old Athenian whether his daughter likes the young man that courts her, he replies,
<q>
                              <l>She is young and apt—</l>
                              <l>Our own precedent paſſions do inſtruct us,</l>
                              <l>What levity's in youth.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is a ſenſible and philoſophic reflection, and ſhould be more attended to, than it generally is: for there are no perſons fit to educate, to guide, or inſtruct young people, but thoſe who have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten their own youth. Parents and grand-parents are apt, too often, to require their children and grand-children ſhould benefit of their earned know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and long experience, and ſo go on from thence, improving ſtill in ſenſe and virtue. It would be a happy thing, indeed, if we could put morals on the foot of ſcience, which is thus progreſſive; but they muſt be very ignorant of human nature, who expect it.</p>
                        <p>"Old folks," as an ingenious modern author expreſſes it,
<q>would have young ones as <hi>wiſe</hi> as themſelves; without conſidering that they muſt be <hi>fools,</hi> if they were ſo <note n="*" place="bottom">The Friends, or Original Letters, Vol. II. Letter LXXIX.</note>.</q>
Meaning, for he does not ſtay to explain himſelf, that they muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of dull, phlegmatic natures, without paſſions, without ſenſibility, and conſequently incapable of improvement or virtue.</p>
                        <p>Whenever I have happened to obſerve what are called <hi>the virtues of age</hi> to be innate in youth, I have naturally expected to meet with the vices of it there alſo; and have but rarely found any one of ſuch character uninfected with ſelfiſhneſs or avarice.</p>

                  <p>IT has been much diſputed among the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, whether this Play be originally Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare's, or only the work of ſome elder Author, reviſed and improved for repreſentation by him: though, if I might be allowed to venture a criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm upon this ſubject, I ſhould ſuppoſe the intire Piece to be his, and for a very ſingular reaſon; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole of the fable, as well as the conduct of it, is ſo very <hi>barbarous,</hi> in every ſenſe of the word, that I think, however he might have been tempted to make uſe of the legend, in ſome hurry or other, for his own purpoſe, he could hardly have adopted it from any other perſon's compoſition. We are quick-ſighted to the faults of others, though purblind to our own.

poetical a ſtile, rather, for ſo ſad a ſubject; but I think the firſt argument of it a very ſtrong one, upon this occaſion—
<q>If there were reaſon for theſe miſeries, &amp;c.</q>
For we certainly ſuffer thoſe misfortunes, which happen to our lot in the common courſe of nature or of juſtice, with much more reſignation of mind, than we can do thoſe which are inflicted on us by the violences of tyranny, cruelty, or malice—Here our deteſtation and abhorrence of the agent, ſerves to heighten our reſentment of the injury.</p>

                        <p>Again—The horrors of a guilty mind are ſtrongly and finely painted, in the following ſpeech. The images of our crimes not only haunt us in our dreams, but often become the viſions of our waking thoughts. All the bars that Providence could op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to vice, it has ſet againſt it.

                        <p>This is natural—One of the moſt horrid circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of guilt, is that total ſuppreſſion a wicked perſon is apt to labour under, for a time, of the ability to pray. I ſhould think that, from this very extraordinary circumſtance, Divines might deduce a good argument to ſtrengthen the Chriſtian ſyſtem of theology. If, as the advocates for Natural Religion ſay, our vices proceed from the violence of our paſſions merely, contrition, upon their ſcheme, might immediately ſucceed the gratification of our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but, as we are taught that temptation ariſes from the inſtigation of an evil ſpirit, the fiend has ſtill a further intereſt in the poſtponing of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Suicide muſt certainly be a ſtrong inſtance of this latter doctrine; as it prompts us, even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the intent of nature, and the general ſcope, both of our affections, impreſſions, and feelings, to the deſtruction of our own exiſtence.</p>

                        <p>But all this ariſes from a too preſumptuous and over-weening notion of our own conſequence in the creation.

And though our ſtrength may then, or even before, become weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it may not, however, be encumbered either with decrepitude or pain: and even to the laſt we may be ſtill capable of uſing as much exerciſe, as age re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; or if any accidental ail ſhould render more neceſſary, an horſe may reſtore the full benefit, at leaſt, though perhaps not the uſe, of our limbs.</p>
                     <p>Let us add to theſe, the pleaſures of hope, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, reflection, reading, ſcience, converſation, love, friendſhip,
<q>
                           <l>Relations dear, and all the charities</l>
                           <l>Of father, ſon, and brother.</l>
                        </q>
Even our moſt moderate ſatisfactions and enjoyments, though their impreſſions may not be ſo ſenſibly felt, during their continuance, yet if their <hi>moment</hi> be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated, by multiplying the degree into the duration, we ſhall find the amount to exceed the quantity of more poignant but ſhorter ſenſations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="427" facs="tcp:0453900300:431"/>Let us alſo take into our account the viciſſitude and variety of ſeaſons, with the alternation of day and night;
<q>
                           <l>Sweet is the breath of morn, her riſing ſweet,</l>
                           <l>With charm of earlieſt birds; pleaſant the ſun,</l>
                           <l>When firſt on this delightful land he ſpreads</l>
                           <l>His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,</l>
                           <l>Glitt'ring with dew; fragrant the fertile earth</l>
                           <l>After ſoft ſhow'rs; and ſweet the coming on</l>
                           <l>Of grateful evening mild; then ſilent night</l>
                           <l>With this her ſolemn bird, and this fair moon,</l>
                           <l>And theſe the gems of Heaven, her ſtarry train.</l>

                     <p>Thus are deſcribed the delights of Eden, by a Poet ſo enamoured of the beauties of Nature, that he has certainly exerted his utmoſt powers to enhance her charms; and yet even Milton's imagination was not able to tranſcend the reality of thoſe objects and enjoyments, which our common fields and gardens afford us every day.</p>
                     <p>This is the common life of man; this the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the yeoman, the huſbandman, the labourer, the artiſt, the mechanic, the ſervant—the <hi>many</hi> of mankind. And where ſickneſs, pain, loſs of any ſenſe or limb, happens to the lot of individuals, this is not according to the <hi>courſe</hi> of Nature, but rather a <hi>violence</hi> againſt it. And theſe accidents afflict not the <hi>many,</hi> but the <hi>few</hi>; nor is Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence any more anſwerable for the <hi>natural,</hi> than for the <hi>moral,</hi> ills of life: one is but incidental to the general conſtitution and neceſſity of things, and the other to the appetites and free-will of man.</p>
                     <p>But ſloth, luxury, ambition, vicious paſſions, envy, hatred, and malice, may render ſome diſeaſed in body, and others diſcontented in mind. This is not, however, the <hi>condition</hi> of their nature, but the <hi>corruption</hi> of it; and theſe are ſtill not the <hi>many,</hi> but the <hi>few</hi>; not the <hi>body</hi> of the people, but the <hi>excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcences</hi> which ariſe out of it, and muſt be nouriſhed at its coſt—namely, the great, the opulent, and the proud.</p>

                        <p>The true character of a ſoldier is well deſcribed, in this Scene. When Coriolanus, in the heat of battle, and covered with blood, demands a freſh ſupply of troops from Cominius, the General an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,

                        <p>That warmth of affection with which Menenius greets good news from his friend, muſt charm the ſenſible Reader. On hearing that Coriolanus had defeated the Volſcians, and written a letter to him on that occaſion, he cries out in tranſport,
<q>Take my cap <note n="*" place="bottom">Meaning I'll throw up my <hi>cap</hi> to the ſkies for joy. Doctor Warburton changes the word to <hi>cup,</hi> as deſigning a <hi>libation</hi> of thanks—I think unneceſſarily.</note>, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo! Marcius coming home!

                        </p>
                        <p>And again, in the next Scene, upon meeting him, he expreſſes the fulneſs of his heart, which exceeds even to pain, in very ſtrong and apt terms:
<q>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>A hundred thouſand welcomes</hi>—I could weep,</l>

It would not have near the effect upon the Reader, if ſpoken by a more ſtayed and ſober perſon; for virtues are apt to ſtrike us more forcibly in ſlight characters, than in ſolid ones; and Menenius has already given us a deſcription of himſelf, in the preceding Scene, which ſufficiently juſtifies me in this diſtinction:

                        <p>When Coriolanus comes home victorious from the Volſcian war, his family and friends gather about him, complimenting and congratulating him on his bravery and ſucceſs; all but Virgilia, his wife, whoſe heart being fuller of joy and fondneſs than them all put together, was therefore rendered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of uttering a ſyllable on that occaſion— Upon which he ſalutes her thus:
<q>My gracious ſilence, hail!</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Doctor Warburton gives the following note upon this paſſage:
<q>The epithet joined to <hi>ſilence</hi> ſhews
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:0453900300:445"/>
it not to proceed from ſullenneſs or reſerve, but to be the effect of a virtuous mind poſſeſſing it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in peace. The expreſſion is extremely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime; and the ſenſe of it conveys the fineſt praiſe that can be given to a woman.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I perfectly agree with the Doctor in his opinion, both of the beauty of the expreſſion, and the merit of the character implied in it. I have taken the liberty of leaving out the adjunct, <hi>good,</hi> joined to the laſt word, in his note, as being ſuperfluous in that place; for no <hi>bad</hi> one can poſſibly deſerve praiſe.</p>

                        <p>When the cautious Caſſius propoſes to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators that they ſhall all enter into a ſolemn cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant together, to ſanctify their mutual engagements,

the nobler Brutus oppoſes it, in the following words:
<q>

                              <l>Is guilty of a ſeveral baſtardy,</l>

<q>

                              <l>To cut the head off, and then hack the limbs,</l>
                              <l>Like wrath in death, and envy <note n="†" place="bottom">

                                 </note> afterwards;</l>
                              <l>For Antony is but a limb of Caeſar,</l>
                              <l>And in the ſpirit of man there is no blood.</l>
                              <l>Oh, that we then could come by Caeſar's ſpirit,</l>
                              <l>And not diſmember Caeſar! But, alas!</l>
                              <l>Caeſar muſt bleed for it—And, gentle friends,</l>
                              <l>Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;</l>
                              <l>Let's carve him as a diſh fit for the gods,</l>

                              <l>And let our hearts, as ſubtle maſters do,</l>
                              <l>Stir up their ſervants to an act of rage,</l>

                        <p>It were much to be wiſhed, for the ſake both of decency and humanity, that ſuch a ſentiment as this, was the ſpirit of laws relative to all capital puniſhments.—Breaking on the wheel, empaling, and other foreign penalties of death, are horrible even to thought; and what muſt they be to the view! Even our own code, though reckoned milder than our neighbours, is hardly leſs barbarous; in the inſtances of quartering, burning, and preſſing to death, if executed according to the full rigour of the ſentence. But the hangman, it ſeems, has more
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:0453900300:457"/>
humanity than the legiſlature, as he is ſaid always to render the criminal ſenſeleſs, before he proceeds to the ſeverity of the ſtatute. He firſt kills the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> the <hi>demon</hi> of the law, and then only executes the <hi>dead</hi> letter of it.</p>
                        <p>There is a ſentiment upon this ſubject, in a late writing, which I think may very properly be quoted here.
<q>I would have all laws mild, but executed with the utmoſt ſtrictneſs; ſo that juſtice and humanity may go hand in hand together. I am not for ſevere executions; for when the penalty exceeds the offence, it is not <hi>the criminal,</hi> but <hi>human nature</hi> that ſuffers. Death alone is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to remove the offender <note n="*" place="bottom">Series of Letters between Henry and Frances.</note>.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But methinks this argument might be urged ſtill further in favour of clemency—Suppoſe we ſhould reaſon thus:
<q>All laws are a mutual compact of ſociety entered into with itſelf. The <hi>Many</hi> can confide to the <hi>Few</hi> thoſe rights only, which they reſpectively poſſeſs in themſelves. To confer a power of death, then, ſhould ſeem to imply <hi>a right of ſuicide.</hi>

                        <p>When Artemidorus, upon ſeeing the number of papers preſented to him on his march to the capital, cries out,
<q>

                        <p>I cannot help thinking, that the Poet has not given either Caeſar fair play for his life, or Brutus for his character, in bringing on the aſſaſſination ſo immediately after the one has uttered, and the other heard, the two foregoing ſpeeches.</p>

it; but I confeſs that I was anxious to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, in order to take an opportunity of vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating our Author from an abſurdity of expreſſion, which has been ſo diſingenuouſly imputed to him by his rival, Ben Johnſon, who charges him with hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrote that paſſage thus:

                        </p>
                        <p>Now, <hi>O rare Ben Johnſon</hi>

                        <p>Or, ſuppoſe that the line had really ſtood as Johnſon has pretended to have quoted it, might not any candid critic, who was at all verſed in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of expreſſion generally made uſe of by Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, have ſufficiently obviated the contradiction in the terms, by only conſtruing the word <hi>wrong,</hi> into the ſenſe of <hi>injury?</hi> for a penalty is certainly an <hi>injury</hi>

                     <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
                     <p>The aſſaſſination of Caeſar is a fact famous in hiſtory; but notwithſtanding the heroic opinion which the world has been taught to conceive of it, I confeſs that I have ever reputed its <hi>fame</hi> as a matter of <hi>notoriety</hi> rather than of <hi>applauſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall only conſider this action in the perſon of Brutus alone, becauſe it has been thought that he was the only one among the conſpirators who had engaged in it upon principle ſolely, as Antony has ſaid above.</p>
                     <p>Plutarch has debated this ſubject, in his compariſon of Brutus with Dion; and, in my opinion, ſeems to condemn it, upon the whole. At leaſt, if we take in the character he there draws of Caeſar, with the ſtate and circumſtances of the Commonwealth at that political criſis, it plainly appears that he meant to declare againſt it.</p>
                     <p>His words are:
<q>With reſpect to Caeſar, though, whilſt his imperial power was in its infancy, he treated his opponents with ſeverity; yet, as ſoon as that power was confirmed, the tyranny was rather a <hi>nominal,</hi> than a <hi>real</hi> thing; for no tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal action could be laid to his charge. Nay, ſuch was the condition of Rome then, that it evidently required a <hi>maſter</hi>; and Caeſar was no more than <hi>a tender and ſkilful phyſician, appointed by Providence to heal the diſtempers of the ſtate.</hi> Of courſe the people lamented his death, and were implacably enraged againſt his <hi>aſſaſſins.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Cowley, in his fine Ode to Brutus, brings heavy charges alſo againſt him, on account of this action; though he ſeems only to do ſo, in order to vindicate him from them. But then he does not pretend to defend him, from the facts themſelves, juſtifying him only upon the higher principle which had rendered him <hi>guilty</hi> of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="461" facs="tcp:0453900300:465"/>However, I think that he is ſeverer upon his heroe even than Plutarch, by mentioning that weak and unphiloſophic exclamation of his, where he ſays, <hi>he had miſtaken virtue for a good, but found it only a name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <l>What can we ſay, but thine own tragic word?</l>
                        <l>That <hi>virtue,</hi> which had worſhipped been by thee,</l>
                        <l>As the moſt ſolid <hi>good,</hi> and greateſt <hi>deity,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>By this fatal proof became</l>
                        <l>An <hi>idol</hi> only, and a <hi>name.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
                     <p>This circumſtance his Biographer had favourably ſuffered to paſs unnoticed; and of which Balzac ſays,
<q>that Brutus ſeems to lament his diſappointment here, <hi>as if he was upbraiding a jilting miſtreſs.</hi>
                        </q>
If he had acted ſolely from <hi>virtue,</hi> he would not have complained that he had miſſed the <hi>reward.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But though the principle might have been ever ſo right, in itſelf, the action was certainly wrong, in him. There are duties involved in duties, ſometimes, which may counteract each other, and thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what might be the <hi>virtue</hi> of one perſon, the <hi>vice</hi> of another. Many ſituations and caſes of this kind may be propoſed; but I ſhall not launch beyond my ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Brutus had many and great obligations to Caeſar. He owed him his life—nay, 'tis ſaid, even his <hi>firſt life</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Caeſar had an amour with Servilia, the mother of Brutus, before his birth.</note>; and had the lives of ſeveral of his friends ſaved alſo at his interceſſion. He had ever lived with him in the greateſt intimacy, and on the footing of his <hi>firſt friend.</hi> Nay, Caeſar had created himſelf enemies, by his partiality towards him, in the preferring him to poſts of profit and honour, which others, from their ſervices, were better intitled to. One of theſe malecontents was Caſſius, who from that very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment became the firſt mover and principal actor in the conſpiracy. And were all theſe obligations to be cancelled by one daſh of the <hi>Stoic</hi>'s-<hi>pen?</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Stoical virtues</hi> are not always <hi>moral ones.</hi> Thoſe metaphyſical <hi>braveries</hi> (for I was wrong in calling them <hi>virtues</hi>) which exceed the feelings of humanity, have never, as I ſaid before <note n="†" place="bottom">See firſt obſervation on Scene I. Act II. and another on firſt part of Scene V Act IV.</note>, been able to inſpire my mind with either admiration or eſteem.</p>
                     <p>The ſympathy of nature is wanting, and true philoſophy has good reaſon to ſuſpect every prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or motive of action to be ſophiſticate, that bears not this <hi>original impreſſion.</hi>

                     <p>WHEN the inſidious Jachimo drops myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hints to the guileleſs Imogen, that he is poſſeſſed of ſome ſecret relative to her huſband, which he heſitates to reveal, ſhe urges him to the diſcovery of it, in theſe words:
<q>
                           <l>You do ſeem to know</l>
                           <l>Something of me, or what concerns me. Pray you,</l>
                           <l>Since doubting things go ill often hurts more,</l>
                           <l>Than to be ſure they do; for certainties,</l>
                           <l>Or are paſt remedies, or timely known</l>
                           <l>The remedy's then born; diſcover to me</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>The nature of the human mind is well ſhewn here; it preſſes ſtill to know the worſt of every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended evil; though not on account of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above propoſed, which is rather ingenious than juſt; but merely to ſatisfy the impatience, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſuſpence of doubt. Providence has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a deſign, in every kind of impreſſion it makes upon its creatures; and the reaſon that Imogen gives here, may, perhaps, be its true one, in this caſe: but what I contend for is, That ſuch a reflection is not the real ſource of our curioſity upon theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Philoſophy may ſerve to govern our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes, but is incapable of inſpiring them.</p>

                        <p>In the ſame Scene, which is a foreſt, Imogen, upon reading her miſtaken huſband's mandate to Piſanio, requiring him to put her to death, on a preſumption of her having been falſe to his bed, thus exclaims:
<q>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>Falſe to his bed!</hi> What is it to be falſe?</l>
                              <l>To lie in watch there, and to think on him?</l>
                              <l>To weep 'twixt clock and clock? If ſleep charge nature,</l>
                              <l>To break it with a fearful dream of him,</l>
                              <l>And cry myſelf awake? That's falſe to's bed! is't?</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nothing, in ſituation of circumſtance, in thought, or expreſſion, can exceed the beauty or tender effect of the above paſſage. It catches ſuch quick hold of our ſympathy, that we feel as if the ſcene was real, and are at once tranſported amidſt the gloom and ſilence of the foreſt, in ſpite of all the glare of the Theatre, and the loud applauſe of the audience. It is in ſuch inſtances as theſe, that Shakeſpeare has never yet been equalled, and can never be excelled. What a power of natural ſentiment muſt a man have been poſſeſſed of, who could ſo adequately expreſs that kind of ingenuous ſurprize upon ſuch a challenge, which none but a woman can poſſibly feel! Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare could not only aſſume all characters, but even their ſexes too—This whole Scene is beautiful, but falls not within our rule to tranſcribe any more of it here. The Commentators are all dumb upon this fine paſſage—not ſilent in admiration, but frozen into ſcholaſtic apathy. One may ſay of ſuch cold critics on Shakeſpeare, what Addiſon does of lukewarm Chriſtians,
<q>That <hi>they want parts to be devout,</hi> and could as ſoon make an epic poem, as a fervent prayer.</q>

                        <p>There is a true ſpirit of natural bravery expreſſed here. When Cloten meets Guiderius in the foreſt, and challenges him to yield himſelf a priſoner, he replies,

                        <p>After <hi>Guiderius</hi> has ſlain <hi>Cloten</hi> in fight, his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Arviragus</hi> ſays he envies him the action, and wiſhes for ſome ſuch trial of danger to exerciſe his own ſpirit upon. On this occaſion old Bellarius makes the following reflection:
<q>
                              <l>O thou goddeſs,</l>

                        <p>The notion here expreſſed, is one of the many antient pieces of ſuperſtition that modern philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy has finally deſtroyed. The lion has long ſince loſt its inſtinct for princes, as well as for virgins. Human nature is the ſame throughout; it is edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation alone that diſtinguiſhes man from man. There are, indeed, great differences often obſervable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the talents and intellects of the ſpecies; but this diſtinction is remarked in <hi>individuals,</hi> only, not in the <hi>claſſes</hi> of mankind.</p>

                        <p>THE deſcription of Ajax in this Play is worth tranſcribing, as being humorous in itſelf, agreeing with the repreſentation of him in the Iliad, and becauſe it may be applied alſo in part to many, and in the whole to a few, medley characters that are frequently to be met with in life.</p>

                        <p>This man, lady, hath robbed many beaſts of their particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.

He is melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly without cauſe, and merry againſt the hair; he hath the joints of every thing, but every thing ſo out of joint, that he is a gouty <hi>Briareus,</hi> many hands, and no uſe; or purblind <hi>Argus,</hi> all eyes, and no ſight.</p>

                        <p>Creſſida's ſpeech here, in reference to her wooer Troilus, contains very juſt reflections and prudent maxims for the conduct of women, in the dangerous circumſtance of love. What ſhe ſays, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the utterance of the moſt virtuous matron, though her own character in this piece is unluckily a bad one. But our Author's genius teemed ſo fertile in document, that he was unable to reſtrain its impulſe, and coolly wait for a fit opportunity of adapting the ſpeaker to the ſpeech. Shakeſpeare's faults ariſe from richneſs, not from poverty; they exceed, not fall ſhort; his monſters never want a head, but have ſometimes two.</p>

                  <p>WERE it my province to have ſelected the poetical beauties of our Author, there are few of his Plays that would have furniſhed me more amply than this. The language abounds with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and delicacy, and ſeems to breathe the ſoul of youthful fondneſs; but neither the fable nor the dialogue can afford much aſſiſtance toward my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe; as the firſt is founded on a vicious prejudice unknown to the liberal minds of Britons, that of entailing family feuds and reſentments down from generation to generation; and the ſecond, as far, at leaſt, as the lovers are concerned, though poetical and refined, is dictated more by paſſion than by ſentiment.</p>
                  <p>But as my young Readers might not forgive my paſſing over this Play unnoticed, I ſhall juſt obſerve, that the cataſtrophe of the unhappy lovers ſeems intended as a kind of moral, as well as poetical juſtice, for their having ventured upon an unweighed engagement together, without the concurrence and conſent of their parents. See my reflection on the firſt Scene, Act I. <hi>Midſummer Night's Dream,</hi> where this duty and obedience is both enforced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained.</p>

<q>This is not the remark of a weak man.</q>
It is not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but why ſhould <hi>Polonius</hi> be deemed ſo? He certainly ſpeaks very good ſenſe, throughout, though with the natural and <hi>reſpectable</hi> mixture of the old man in it; which, methinks, as Addiſon ſays of <hi>Cornaro</hi>'s <note n="†" place="bottom">He wrote a treatiſe on <hi>health and long life,</hi> at fourſcore, commended in the Spectator, No. 195.</note> ſtile, is an improvement to it. As to the manner in which he deſcribes Hamlet's madneſs, in Scene IV. following, I take it to be only deſigned by <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> in ridicule of the old pedantic mode of definitions, or quaint diſtinctions, in logic and philoſophy; the <hi>categories, predicaments,</hi> and <hi>predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cables</hi> of the <hi>Schools,</hi> uſed in thoſe times. There are
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:0453900300:511"/>
many inſtances of the ſame oblique ſtrictures, upon other ſubjects, in our Author; I have, therefore, ever thought this character miſtaken, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently miſrepreſented on the Stage, by its being generally given to a comic actor.</p>

                        <p>The famous ſoliloquy of Hamlet, here, <hi>To be, or not to be,</hi> is ſo generally remembered, and has been ſo often remarked upon, that I might poſſibly be thought guilty of a neglect, in paſſing it by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a comment. But the ſubject is a hazardous one, and therefore had better not be meddled with. It might, perhaps, bear a diſcuſſion in philoſophy, but religion forbids any manner of debate upon it.</p>

                           <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> not only affords documents to real life, but ſupplies them even to the mimic one; as may be ſeen in this Scene, where he makes <hi>Hamlet</hi> give inſtructions to Actors how they ſhould perform their parts. But as there is no moral to be extracted from the paſſage, I ſhall not quote it here.</p>
                        <p>But all theſe rules, however excellent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, may be conſidered rather as ſtrictures on bad performers, than precepts for their reformation. Actors, like Poets, muſt be born, not made; and <hi>a receipt to form an Actor,</hi> may be conſidered in the ſame light with the one <hi>to frame an Epic poem.</hi> It is not ſo much from want of <hi>notion,</hi> as of <hi>Nature,</hi> that ſo many of the <hi>Dramatis Perſonae</hi> are found to be deficient in the expreſſion of ſentiment, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of character.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Talents</hi> are as neceſſary to Actors, as <hi>Genius</hi> is to Authors; if I may be allowed ſuch a diſtinction of terms—but neither are to be acquired in the ſchools. All Mr. Garrick's <hi>art,</hi> without his <hi>nature,</hi> would produce no effect, as may be ſeen in the many who
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:0453900300:512"/>
have <hi>laboriouſly,</hi> but vainly attempted to copy him. I have known perſons capable of writing a part, who were incapable of performing it. Our Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was an inſtance of this inconſiſtency; who, though he formed the <hi>rule,</hi> could not ſupply the <hi>example.</hi>

<q>That piece of Shakeſpeare's, which appears to have moſt affected Engliſh hearts, and has, perhaps, been ofteneſt acted of any that have come upon our ſtage, is almoſt one continued moral; a ſeries of deep reflections drawn from <hi>one</hi> mouth, upon the ſubject of <hi>one</hi> ſingle accident and calamity, naturally fitted to move horror and compaſſion.</q>

                  <head>OTHELLO.</head>
                  <p>SHAKESPEARE has written three pieces on the ſubject of jealouſy; the Winter's Tale, Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beline, and this one, beſides the character of Ford, in the Merry Wives. But ſuch was the richneſs of his genius, that he has not borrowed a ſingle thought, image, or expreſſion, from any one of them, to aſſiſt him in any of the others. The ſubject ſeems rather to have grown progreſſively out of itſelf, to have inſpired its own ſentiments, and have dictated its own language. This Play, in my opinion, is very juſtly conſidered as the laſt and greateſt effort of our Author's genius, and may, therefore, be looked upon as the <hi>chef d'oeuvre</hi> of dramatic compoſition.</p>
                  <p>How perfectly does Othello's conduct throughout, correſpond with Iago's deſcription of it in the latter end of the Firſt Act!</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>The Moor is of a free and open nature,</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>Such a character is not uncommon in life; whoſe virtues, ariſing more from an excellence of nature, than an exertion of philoſophy, is led to judge of others by itſelf, and of courſe become the dupe of art and villainy.</p>

We ought neither to be votaries to the Cynic nor the Stoic ſects.

                        <p>I have before obſerved upon the exuberance of Shakeſpeare's document and moral. He ſo much abounds in maxim and reflection, that he appears fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently at a loſs to find proper characters, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out even his own extenſive drama, ſufficient to parcel them out to; ſo that he is frequently obliged to make his fools talk ſenſe, and ſet his knaves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching. An inſtance of the latter impropriety may be ſeen in the following paſſage, which contains both ſound philoſophy, and uſeful admonition.

                           <p>Virtue? a fig. <hi>'Tis in ourſelves that we are thus, or thus.</hi> Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles, or ſow lettuce; ſet hyſſop, and weed up thyme; ſupply it with one gender of herbs, or diſtract it with many; either have it ſterile with idleneſs, or manured with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our will. If the ballance of our lives had not one ſcale of reaſon, to poiſe another of ſenſuality, the blood and baſeneſs of our natures would conduct us to moſt prepoſterous concluſions.</p>

                        <p>The plea that Rodorigo offers above, for remaining ſtill under the dominion of a lawleſs paſſion, is framed upon a fatal error, too prevalent in the world, that <hi>virtue</hi> is a peculiar gift from Heaven, granted <hi>ſpeciali gratiâ,</hi> as it were, to particular and choſen perſons. Hence indolent minds are apt to conclude it a vain taſk to reſtrain their paſſions, or reſiſt their tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without the ſupernatural aid of ſuch an innate endowment. Iago, in his reply, reaſons very juſtly againſt this dangerous and diſcouraging doctrine of <hi>partial grace</hi>; in ſupport of which argument I ſhall

                        <p>It has often ſurprized me, to find the character of Deſdemona ſo much miſtaken and ſlighted, as it too generally is.

            <head>A GENERAL POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>THERE are many favourite paſſages in Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, which moſt of my Readers have got by heart, and miſſing here, may poſſibly object to my having neglected to quote or obſerve upon them, in their proper places. But my intention, in this Work, was not to propound the beauties of the Poet, but to expound the document of the Moraliſt, throughout his writings.</p>
            <p>So far from being inſenſible to the other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of this Author, I have ever thought him by much the greateſt poet of our nation, for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity of idea, and beauty of expreſſion. Perhaps I may even think myſelf guilty of ſome injuſtice, in limiting his fame within the narrow confines of theſe kingdoms; for, upon a compariſon with the much venerated names of Antiquity, I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that we need not ſurrender the Britiſh Palm, either to the Grecian Bay, or the Roman Laurel, with regard to the principal parts of poetry; as thought, ſentiment, or deſcription—And though the dead languages are confeſſed to be ſuperior to ours, yet even here, in the very article of diction, our Author ſhall meaſure his pen with any of the antient <hi>ſtyles,</hi> in their moſt admired compound and decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound epithets, deſcriptive phraſes, or figurative expreſſions. <hi>The multitudinous ſea, ear-piercing fife, big war, giddy maſt, ſky-aſpiring, heaven-kiſſing hill, time-honoured name, cloud-capt towers, heavenly-harneſſed team, raſh gunpowder, poliſhed perturbation, gracious ſilence, golden care, trumpet-tongued, thought-executing fires</hi>; with
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:0453900300:527"/>
a number of other words, both epic and comic, are inſtances of it. But with regard to the moral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of our Engliſh <hi>Confucius,</hi> either for beauty or number, he undoubtedly challenges the wreath from the whole collective Hoſt of Greek or Roman Writers, whether ethic, epic, dramatic, didactic, or hiſtoric.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Montagu ſays, very juſtly, that
<q>We are apt to conſider Shakeſpeare only as a poet; but he is certainly one of the greateſt moral philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers that ever lived.</q>
And this is true; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in his univerſal ſcheme of doctrine, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends manners, proprieties, and decorums; and whatever relates to theſe, to perſonal character, or national deſcription, falls equally within the great line of morals. Horace prefers Homer to all the philoſophers,
<q>
                  <l>Qui, quid ſit pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</l>
                  <l>Pleniùs et meliùs Chryſippo et Crantore dicit.</l>
               </q>
And ſurely Shakeſpeare <hi>pleniùs et meliùs</hi> excels him again, as much as the living ſcene exceeds the dead letter, as action is preferable to didaction, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation to declamation.</p>
            <p>Example is better than precept. A dramatic moral affords us the benefit of both, at once. Plato wiſhed that Virtue could aſſume a viſible form. Dramatic exhibition gives one, both to Virtue and to Vice. The abſtract idea is there materialized. The contraſt of character, too, affords an additional ſtrength to the moral; as we are led to love virtue, on a double account, by being made to abhor vice, at the ſame time. The dramatic moraliſt poſſeſſes a manifeſt advantage over the doctrinal one. Mere deſcriptions of virtue or vice do not ſtrike us, ſo ſtrongly, as the viſible repreſentations of them. Richard the Third's dream, Lady Macbeth's ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy in her ſleep, the Dagger Scene in the ſame Play, Cardinal Beaufort's laſt moments, with many other paſſages in our Author, of the ſame admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:0453900300:528"/>
kind, avail us more than whole volumes of Tully's Offices, or Seneca's Morals.</p>
            <p>In this ſcenic province of inſtruction, our repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations are much better calculated to anſwer the end propoſed, than thoſe of the Antients were, on account of the different hours of exhibition. Theirs were performed in the morning; which circumſtance ſuffered the ſalutary effect to be worn out of the mind, by the buſineſs or avocations of the day. Ours are at night; the impreſſions accompany us to our couch, ſupply matter for our lateſt reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and may ſometimes furniſh the ſubject of our very dreams.</p>
            <p>But Shakeſpeare ſeems to have extended his views ſtill further; by frequently interſperſing alluſions to the Scriptures, throughout his writings. I would not have the old <hi>Myſteries</hi> reſtored to the Stage, nor ſhould Dramatic Dialogue exceed into Sermons; but I think, that ſuch occaſional hints or paſſages, as this Author has ſupplied, when thrown in ſparingly, and introduced with diſcretion, may ſometimes ſerve to add a ſtrength and dignity to the ſtile and ſubject of ſuch compoſitions; beſides the advantage of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, perhaps, effects of an higher nature, by calling our attention to more ſerious reflections, in the very midſt of our pleaſures and diſſipations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinking our ſpirits, or damping our enjoyments; awakening us to the contemplation of a religion ſo pure, ſo equally free from the ſeverities of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and the ſuperſtitions of devotion; of a ſyſtem of theology, framed even as Man himſelf would chuſe; in fine, of a faith and doctrine, which has but ſtronger bound the ſocial ties, given an higher ſanction to moral obligations, and proved our duty to be our intereſt alſo.</p>

But in reſpect to the latter, I muſt here throw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not only upon the candor, but the indulgence of my Readers; hoping that the many failures in the execution may be pardoned, on the ſingle merit of the deſign.</p>
