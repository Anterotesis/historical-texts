            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We bring a piece drawn from our ancient ſtore,</l>
                  <l>Which made old Engliſh ſides with laughing ſore.</l>
                  <l>Some ſmiles from Tony Lumpkin, if you ſpare,</l>
                  <l>Let Trincalo of Totnam have his ſhare.</l>

                  <l>Each ſiſter muſe a ſep'rate ſhop ſhould keep,</l>
                  <l>Comedy to laugh, Tragedy to weep,</l>
                  <l>And ſentimental laudanum to make you ſleep.</l>
                  <l>I'll tell you what, good folks, if you don't jeſt,</l>

                  <l>Do laugh, pray laugh—'tis your beſt cure when ill,</l>

                     <l>They ſay, you think too much, and talk too little;</l>
                     <l>While you with ſcorh, cry out againſt their prate,</l>
                     <l>And ſwear, with heels ſo light, their heads want weight.</l>

                     <l>England would ſhew its laughing face once more.</l>
                     <l>For this good end, our bard throws in his mite,</l>

                     <l>In acting ſcenes employ their laughing hours,</l>
                     <l>And life's rough path make gay by ſtrewing flowers.</l>

                     <l>And what makes Frenchmen grin, will make you ſmile.</l>
                     <l>The drama, would like Alkalis, protect you</l>

                     <l>Dealing death round him, with a ſilver ſpoon.</l>

               <head>SONG, ſung by Mr. LOWE, at Drury-lane Theatre, 20th November, 1740<note n="*" place="bottom">After the performance of the TEMPEST, for the Benefit of Captain Pedlie's Crew, who on this occaſion came on the Stage, and returned thanks; the Prince of Wales, Father of his preſent Majeſty, honoured the Theatre writh his attendance. Captain Peddie was Commander of the Prince of Orange, homeward bound from St. Chriſtopher's. Oct. 23, after a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous paſſage, about 30 leagues E. of Scilly, he was attacked by a Spaniſh Privateer of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>8 guns, as many ſwivels, and 150 Men. The Spaniards holſting Engliſh Colours, Capt. Peddie had no ſuſpicion of him till he was cloſe on board, when his adverſary poured in a broadſide upon him with all his ſmall arms. Captain Peddie's guns being all wet below, he coud only return him his quarter deck guns and ſmall arms; but clapping the helm hard a-weather, he had the courage to run him aboard on the quarter, which did him conſiderable damage. When the Spaniard got clear, he ſhot ahead and lay by a quarter of an hour, which gave the captain time to get ready for him; and on his bearing down again, a ſmart engagement enſued for about three hours and a half; when the Don bore away, and Captain Peddie after him; but finding he outſailed him, he clapped upon a wind, and continued his voyage with a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wind till he arrived in the Downs, October 30, having loſt but four men and five wounded. After ſo brave a deliverance he was ſcarcely anchored, before, by a violent ſtorm, his ſhip was driven a ſhore and loſt; himſelf narrowly eſcaping, and five of his crew having periſhed with the cold. The gallant beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of this Gentleman, and his ſubſequent misfortunes, made a deep impreſſion on the publick. On the 20th November 1740, CATO was acted at Covent Garden for his Benefit. His Majeſty ſent him 100 Guineas, the Dutcheſs of Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough 20, and Mr. Onſlow, Speaker of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, with many of the Nobility, made him preſents to the value of near 3000 pounds. Soon after he had given him the Command of the Baſiliſk Bomb. The above Song was written by Mr. Walmſley, the patron of Mr. Garrick, and the friend of Doctor Johnſon, except the third Stanza, which was added by Mr. Garrick himſelf.</note>

               <p>I AM a theatrical politician, and can talk as learnedly in my field of politics as you, or any of your correſpondents, can do in your's. I can remember the day when a Gray's-Inn Journaliſt, or a Herald, has mauled a manager weekly, as ably as the Monitor or the North Briton has lately attacked the Miniſter. Some of your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians allow Mr. Pitt to be a great man, but think he has been too fond of continental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections. In like manner, I not only allow Garrick to be the greateſt actor the world ever ſaw, but alſo am of opinion that he is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent manager; and yet I muſt, as a true patriot, blame him for his encouragement of pantomime. Two Pantomimes in one winter, and the town had only ſenſe enough to damn one. O tempora! O mores! but I ſhall conclude what I have to ſay at preſent, with taking notice, that the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of theatres are as extraordinary as thoſe
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:0633400102:270"/>
of ſtates and republics; and tumults in king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are ſcarce attended with greater confuſion than riots at the Playhouſe. On theſe occaſions great patriots, theatrical and political, chiefly ſhew themſelves. Hampden, who oppoſed ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money, is not more celebrated than Thady Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patrick, who demoliſhed full price. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing poem is a parody on that celebrated ode of Dryden's, which that great orator, Mr. She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridan, has ſo often recited with uncommon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe at Spring-gardens, Pewterers-hall, Drury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane Theatre, Oxford, Cambridge, and Bath; and I moſt heartily wiſh, that it were in my power to prevail with that gentleman to employ his noble powers of elocution on the following parody.</p>
