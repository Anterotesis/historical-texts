            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE State of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Buſineſs in this Town having been long perplexed with Pretenders in both Kinds, in order to open Men's Eyes againſt ſuch Abuſes, it appeared no unprofitable Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to publiſh a Paper which ſhould obſerve upon the Manners of the Pleaſurable, as well as the Buſie Part of Mankind. To make this generally read, it ſeemed the moſt proper Method to form it by Way of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Intelligence, conſiſting of ſuch Parts as might gratify the Curioſity of Perſons of all Conditions, and of each Sex.
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0397200201:3"/>
But a Work of this Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Time to grow into the Notice of the World, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened very luckily, that a little before I had reſolved upon this Deſign, a Gentleman had written Predictions, and Two or Three other Pieces in my Name, which had render'd it famous thro' all Parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> and by an inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Spirit and Humour, raiſed it to as high a Pitch of Reputation as it could poſſibly arrive at.</p>
            <p>By this good Fortune, the Name of <hi>Iſaac Bickerſtaff</hi> gained an Audience of all who had any Taſte of Wit, and the Addition of the ordinary Occurrences of common Journals of News brought in a Multitude of other Readers. I could not, I confeſs, long keep up the Opinion of the Town, that theſe Lucubrations
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0397200201:4"/>
were written by the ſame Hand with the firſt Works which were publiſhed under my Name; but before I loſt the Participation of that Author's Fame, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready found the Advantage of his Authority, to which I owe the ſudden Acceptance which my Labours met with in the World.</p>
            <p>The general Purpoſe of this Paper, is to expoſe the falſe Arts of Life, to pull off the Diſguiſes of Cunning, Vanity, and Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to recommend a general Simplicity in our Dreſs, our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and our Behaviour. No Man has a better Judgment for the Diſcovery, or a nobler Spirit for the Contempt of all Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, than your ſelf; which Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities render you the moſt proper Patron for the Author of theſe Eſſays. In the general, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0397200201:5"/>
however executed, has meet with ſo great Succeſs, that there is hardly a Name now eminent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us for Power, Wit, Beauty, Valour, or Wiſdom, which is not ſubſcribed, for the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Two Volumes in <hi>Octavo,</hi> on a <hi>Royal</hi> or <hi>Medium</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. This is indeed an Honour for which it is impoſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a ſuitable Gratitude; and there is nothing could be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Pleaſure I take in it, but the Reflection that it gives me the moſt conſpicuous Occaſion I can ever have, of ſubſcribing my ſelf,</p>

               <p>THO' the other Papers which are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed for the Uſe of the good People of <hi>England</hi> have certainly very wholſom Effects, and are laudable in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Kinds, they do not ſeem to come up to the main Deſign of ſuch Narrations, which I humbly preſume, ſhould be principally intended for the Uſe of politick Perſons, who are ſo publick-ſpirited as to neglect their own Affairs to look into Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of State. Now theſe Gentlemen, for the moſt Part, being Perſons of ſtrong Zeal, and weak Intellects, It is both a Charitable and Neceſſary Work to offer ſomething, whereby ſuch worthy and well-affected Members of the Commonwealth may be inſtructed, after their Reading, <hi>what to</hi>

                  <hi>think;</hi> which ſhall be the End and Purpoſe of this my Paper: Wherein I ſhall from Time to Time Report and Conſider all Matters of what Kind ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that ſhall occur to Me, and publiſh ſuch my Advices and Reflections every <hi>Tueſday, Thurſday,</hi> and <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Week, for the Convenience of the Poſt. I reſolved alſo to have ſomething which may be of Entertainment to the Fair Sex, in Honour of whom I have taken the Title of this Paper. I therefore earneſtly deſire all Perſons, without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, to take it in for the preſent <hi>Gratis,</hi> and hereafter at the Price of One Penny, forbidding all Hawkers to take more for it at their Peril. And I deſire all Perſons to conſider, that I am at a very great Charge for proper Materials for this Work, as well as that before I reſolved upon it, I had ſettled a Correſpondence in all Parts of the Known and Knowing World. And foraſmuch as this Globe is not trodden upon by meer Drudges of Buſineſs only, but that Men of Spirit and Genius are juſtly to be eſteemed as conſiderable Agents in it, we ſhall not, upon a Dearth of News, preſent you with muſty Foreign Edicts, or dull Proclamations, but ſhall divide our Relation of the Paſſages which occur in Action or Diſcourſe throughout this Town as well as elſewhere, under ſuch Dates of Places as may prepare you for the Matter you are to expect, in the following Manner:</p>
               <p>All Accounts of <hi>Gallantry, Pleaſure,</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,</hi> ſhall be under the Article of <hi>White</hi>'s <hi>Chocolate-houſe; Poetry</hi> under that of <hi>Will</hi>'s <hi>Coffee-houſe: Learning,</hi> under the Title of <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian; Foreign</hi> and <hi>Domeſtick News,</hi> you will have from <hi>St. James</hi>'s <hi>Coffee-houſe;</hi> and what elſe I have to offer on any other Subject ſhall be dated from my own <hi>Apartment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I once more deſire my Reader to conſider, That as I cannot keep an ingenious Man to go daily to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0397200201:8"/>
                  <hi>Will</hi>'s, under Twopence each Day mereby for his Charges; to <hi>White</hi>'s, under Sixpence; nor to the <hi>Graecian,</hi> without allowing him ſome Plain <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> to be as able as others at the Learned Table; and that a good Obſerver cannot ſpeak with even <hi>Kidney</hi> at St. <hi>James</hi>'s without clean Linnen. I ſay, theſe Conſiderations will, I hope, make all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons willing to comply with my Humble Requeſt (when my <hi>Gratis</hi> Stock is exhauſted) of a Penny a-piece; eſpecially ſince they are ſure of ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Amuſement, and that it is impoſſible for me to want Means to entertain 'em, having, beſides the Force of my own Parts, the Power of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that I can, by caſting a Figure, tell you all that will happen before it comes to paſs.</p>
               <p>But this laſt Faculty I ſhall uſe very ſparingly, and ſpeak but of few Things 'till they are paſſed for fear of divulging Matters which may offend our Superiors.</p>

               <p>THE deplorable Condition of a very pretty Gentleman, who walks here at the Hours when Men of Quality firſt appear, is what is very much lamented. His Hiſtory is, That on the 9th of <hi>September</hi> 1705. being in his One and twentieth Year, he was waſhing his Teeth at a Tavern Window in <hi>Pall-mall,</hi> when a fine Equipage paſſed by, and in it a young Lady who looked up at him; away goes the Coach, and the young Gentleman pulled off his Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap, and inſtead of rubbing his Gums, as he ought to do out of the Window till about Four a Clock, ſits him down, and ſpoke not a Word till Twelve at Night; after which, he began to enquire, If any Body knew the Lady—The Company asked, What Lady? But he ſaid
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0397200201:9"/>
no more, 'till they broke up at Six in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. All the enſuing Winter he went from Church to Church every Sunday, and from Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe to Playhouſe every Night in the Week, but could never find the Original of the Picture which dwelt in his Boſom. In a Word, his Attention to any Thing but his Paſſion, was utterly gone. He has loſt all the Money he ever played for, and been confuted in every Argument he has enter'd upon ſince the Moment he firſt ſaw her. He is of a Noble Family, has naturally a very good Air, and is of a frank, honeſt Temper: But this Paſſion has ſo extremely mauled him, that his Features are ſet and uninformed, and his whole Viſage is deaden'd by a long Abſence of Thought. He never appears in any Alacrity, but when raiſed by Wine; at which Time he is ſure to come hither, and throw away a great deal of Wit on Fellows, who have no Senſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than juſt to obſerve, That our poor Lover has moſt Underſtanding when he is drunk, and is leaſt in his Senſes when he is ſober.</p>

               <p>Letters from the <hi>Hague</hi> of the 16th ſay, That Major-General <hi>Cadogan</hi> was gone to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> with Orders to diſperſe proper Inſtructions for aſſembling the whole Force of the Allies in <hi>Flanders</hi> in the Beginning of the next Month. The late Offers concerning Peace, were made in the Style of Perſons who think themſelves upon equal Terms: But the Allies have ſo juſt a Senſe of their preſent Advantages, that they will not admit of a Treaty, except <hi>France</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers what is more ſuitable to her preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. At the ſame Time we make Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as if we were alarmed by a greater Force than that which we are carrying into the Field. Thus this Point ſeems now to be argued Sword in Hand. This was what a Great General al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to, when being asked the Names of thoſe who were to be Plenipotentiaries for the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Peace; anſwered, with a ſerious Air, <hi>There are about an Hundred thouſand of us.</hi> Mr. <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> who has the Ear of the greateſt Politicians that come hither, tells me, There is a Mail come in to Day with Letters, dated <hi>Hague, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> 19. <hi>N.

               <p>I am ſorry I am obliged to trouble the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick with ſo much Diſcourſe upon a Matter which I at the very firſt mentioned as a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle, <hi>viz.</hi> the Death of Mr. <hi>Partridge,</hi> under whoſe Name there is an <hi>Almanack</hi> come out for the Year 1709. In one Page of which it is aſſerted by the ſaid <hi>John Partridge,</hi> That he is ſtill living, and not only ſo, but that he was alſo living ſome Time before, and even at the Inſtant when I writ of his Death. I have in another Place, and in a Paper by it ſelf, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently convinced this Man that he is dead, and if he has any Shame, I don't doubt but that by this Time he owns it to all his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: For tho' the Legs and Arms, and whole Body of that Man may ſtill appear and perform their animal Functions; yet ſince, as I have elſewhere obſerved, his Art is gone, the Man is gone. I am, as I ſaid, concerned, that this

               <p>THere has lain all this Evening on the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the following Poem. The Subject of it being Matter very uſeful for Families, I thought it deſerved to be conſidered, and made more publick. The Turn the Poet gives it, is very happy; but the Foundation is from a real Accident which happened among my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. A young Gentleman of a great Eſtate, fell deſperately in Love with a great Beauty, of very high Quality, but as ill-natured, as long Flattery and an habitual Self will could make her. However, my young Spark ventures upon her, like a Man of Quality, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with her, or having ever ſaluted
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0397200201:14"/>
her, till it was a Crime to kiſs any Woman elſe. Beauty is a Thing which palls with Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; and the Charms of this Lady ſoon wanted the Support of good Humour and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſancy of Manners. Upon this my Spark flies to the Bottle for Relief from his Satiety. She diſdains him for being tired with that for which all Men envied him; and he never came Home, but it was—Was there no Sot that would ſtay longer? Would any Man living but you? Did I leave all the World for this Uſage? To which he—Madam, Split me, you are very impertinent! In a Word, this Match was Wedlock in its moſt terrible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances. She, at laſt weary of Railing to no Purpoſe, applies to a good Uncle, who gives her a Bottle of Water: The Vertue of this Powerful Liquor (ſaid he) is ſuch, that if the Woman you marry proves a Scold, (which, it ſeems, my dear Neece, is your Misfortune; as it was your good Mother's before you,) let her hold ſix Spoonfuls in her Mouth, for a full half Hour after you come Home—But I find I am not in Humour for telling a Tale, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Nature is ſo ungrateful as Story-Telling againſt the Grain, therefore take it as the Author has given it you.</p>

               <p>Letters from <hi>Venice</hi> ſay, The Diſappointment of their Expectation to ſee his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0397200201:18"/>
has very much diſquieted the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Our laſt Advices from <hi>Germany</hi> inform us, That the Miniſter of <hi>Hanover</hi> has urg'd the Council at <hi>Ratisbonne</hi> to exert themſelves in Behalf of the Common Cauſe, and taken the Liberty to ſay, That the Dignity, the Virtue, the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Electoral Highneſs, his Maſter, were called to the Head of their Affairs in vain, if they thought fit to leave him naked of the proper Means to make thoſe Excellencies uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Honour and Safety of the Empire. They write from <hi>Berlin</hi> of the 13th, <hi>O. S.</hi> That the true Deſign of General <hi>Fleming</hi>'s Viſit to that Court was, to inſinuate, that it will be for the mutual Intereſt of the King of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> and King <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to enter into a new Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but that the Miniſters of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> are not inclined to his Sentiments. We hear from <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> That his Imperial Majeſty has expreſſed great Satisfaction in their High Mightineſſes having communicated to him the whole that has paſſed in the Affair of a Peace. Though there have been Practices uſed by the Agents of <hi>France,</hi> in all the Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> to break the good Underſtanding of the Allies, they have had no other Effect, but to make all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers concerned in the Alliance, more doubtful of their Safety from the great Offers of the Enemy. The Empire is rouzed by this Alarm, and the Frontiers of all the <hi>French</hi> Dominions are in Danger of being inſulted the enſuing Campagne: Advices from all Parts confirm, That it is impoſſible for <hi>France</hi> to find a Way to obtain ſo much Credit, as to gain any one Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate of the Allies, or conceive any Hope for Safety from other Proſpects.</p>

               <p>I find it of very great Uſe, now I am ſetting up for a Writer of News, that I am an Adept in Aſtrological Speculations; by which Means. I avoid ſpeaking of Things which may offend Great Perſons. But at the ſame Time, I muſt not proſtitute the Liberal Sciences ſo far, as not to utter the Truth in Caſes which do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concern the Good of my Native Country. I muſt therefore contradict what has been ſo aſſuredly reported by the News-Writers of <hi>England,</hi> That <hi>France</hi> is in the moſt deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Condition, and that their People die in great Multitudes. I will therefore let the World know, that my Correſpondent, by the Way of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> informs me, upon his Honour, That the Gentleman who writes the Gazette of <hi>Paris,</hi> and ought to know as well as any Man, has told him, That ever ſince the King has been paſt his 63d Year, or Grand Climacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, there has not died one Man of the <hi>French</hi> Nation who was younger than his Majeſty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a very few, who were taken ſuddenly near the Village of <hi>Hickſtet</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> and ſome more, who were ſtraitned for Lodging at a Place called <hi>Ramilies,</hi> and died on the Road to <hi>Ghent</hi> and <hi>Bruges.</hi> There are alſo other Things given out by the Allies, which are Shifts below a Conquering Nation to make uſe of. Among others, 'tis ſaid, There is a general Murmuring among the People of <hi>France,</hi> tho' at the ſame Time all my Letters agree, That there is ſo good an Underſtanding among them, that there is not one Morſel carried out of any Market in the Kingdom, but what is delivered upon Credit.</p>

               <p>THis Evening, the Comedy, call'd <hi>The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Wife,</hi> was acted in <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> for the Benefit of Mrs. <hi>Bignall.</hi> The Part which gives Name to the Play was performed by her ſelf. Through the whole Action, ſhe made a a very pretty Figure, and exactly entered into the Nature of the Part. Her Husband, in the <hi>Drama,</hi> is repreſented to be one of thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchees who run through the Vices of the Town, and believe when they think fit they can marry and ſettle at their Eaſe. His own Knowledge of the Iniquity of the Age, makes him chuſe a Wife wholly ignorant of it, and place his Security in her Want of Skill how to abuſe him. The Poet, on many Occaſions, where the Propriety of the Character will admit of it, inſinuates, That there is no Defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Vice, but the Contempt of it: And has, in the natural Ideas of an untainted Innocent, ſhown the gradual Steps to Ruin and Deſtruction, which Perſons of Condition run into, without the Help of a good Education how to form their Conduct. The Torment of a Jealous Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, which ariſes from his own Falſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims, and the Aggravation of his Pain, by the very Words in which he ſees her Innocence, makes a very pleaſant and inſtructive Satyr.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0397200201:21"/>
The Character of <hi>Horner,</hi> and the Deſign of it, is a good Repreſentation of the Age in which that Comedy was written; at which Time Love and Wenching were the Buſineſs of Life, and the Gallant Manner of purſuing Women was the beſt Recommendation at Court. To which only it is to be imputed, that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Mr. <hi>Wicherly</hi>'s Character and Senſe, condeſcends to repreſent the Inſults done to the Honour of the Bed, without juſt Reproof; but to have drawn a Man of Probity with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſuch Conſiderations, had been a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and a Poet had at that Time diſcovered his Want of knowing the Manners of the Court he lived in, by a Virtuous Character in his fine Gentleman, as he would ſhow his Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, by drawing a Vicious one to pleaſe the preſent Audience. Mrs. <hi>Bignall</hi> did her Part very happily, and had a certain Grace in her Ruſticity, which gave us Hopes of ſeeing her a very Skilful Player, and in ſome Parts, ſupply our Loſs of Mrs. <hi>Verbruggen.</hi> I cannot be of the ſame Opinion with my Friends and Fellow-Labourers, the <hi>Reformers of Manners,</hi> in their Severity towards Plays, but muſt allow, that a good Play acted before a well-bred Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, muſt raiſe very proper Incitements to good Behaviour, and be the moſt quick and moſt prevailing Method of giving Young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a Turn of Senſe and Breeding. But as I have ſet up for a Weekly Hiſtorian, I reſolve to be a Faithful One; and therefore take this publick Occaſion, to admoniſh a Young Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who came fluſtered into the Box laſt Night, and let him know, how much all his Friends were out of Countenance for him. The Women ſate in Terror of hearing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ſhould ſhock their Modeſty, and all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0397200201:22"/>
the Gentlemen in as much Pain, out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the Ladies, and perhaps Reſentment for the Indignity which was offered in coming into their Preſence in ſo diſreſpectful a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Wine made him ſay nothing that was Rude, therefore he is forgiven, upon Condition he weill never hazard his offending more in this Kind. As I juſt now hinted, I own my ſelf of the Society for <hi>Reformation of Manners.</hi> We have lower Inſtruments than thoſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> for puniſhing great Crimes, and expoſing the Abanddoned. Therefore, as I diſign to have Notices from all Publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, I ſhall take upon me only Indecorums, Improprieties, and Negligences, in ſuch as ſhould give us better Examples. After this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration; if a Fine Lady thinks fit to giggle at Church, or a Great Beau come in drunk to a Play, either ſhall be ſure to hear of it in my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Paper: For meerly as a well-bred Man, I cannot bear theſe Enormities.</p>
               <p>After the Play, we naturally ſtroll to this Coffee-houſe, in Hopes of meeting ſome new Poem, or other Entertainment, among the Men of Wit and Pleaſure, where there is a Dearth a preſent. But it is wonderful there ſhould be ſo few Writers, when the Art is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come meerly Mechanick, and Men may make themſelves Great that Way, by as certain and infallible Rules, as you may be a Joiner or a Maſon. There happens a good Inſtance of this, in what the Hawker juſt now has offered to Sale; to wit, <hi>Inſtructions to Vanderbank; A Sequel to the Advice to the Poets; A poem, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the Glorious Succeſs of Her Majeſty's Arms, under the Command of the Duke of</hi> Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borought, <hi>the laſt Tear in</hi> Flanders. Here you are to underſtand, that the Author finding the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0397200201:23"/>
Poets would not take his Advice, he troubles himſelf no more about 'em; but has met with one <hi>Vanderbank,</hi> who works in Arras, and makes very good Tapeſtry Hangings: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in order to celebrate the Hero of the Age, he claps me together all that can be ſaid of a Man that makes Hangings: As,<q>
                     <l>Then, Artiſt, who doſt Nature's Face expreſs</l>
                     <l>In Silk and Gold, and Scenes of Action dreſs;</l>
                     <l>Doſt figur'd Arras animated leave,</l>
                     <l>Spin a Bright Story, or a Paſſion weave</l>
                     <l>By mingling Threads; canſt mingle Shade and Light,</l>
                     <l>Delineate Triumphs, or deſcribe a Fight?</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Well, what ſhall this Work man do? Why? To ſhow how great an Hero the Poet intends, he provides him a very good Horſe:
<q>
                     <l>Champing his Foam, and bounding on the Plain</l>
                     <l>Arch his High Neck, and Graceful ſpread his Mane.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now as to the Intrepidity, the calm Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, the conſtant Application of the Hero, it is not neceſſary to take that upon your ſelf; you may, in the Lump, bid him you employ raiſe him as High as he can, and if he does it not, let him anſwer for diſobeying Orders.<q>
                     <l>Let Fame and Victory in inferior Sky,</l>
                     <l>Hover with ballanc'd Wings, and ſmiling fly</l>
                     <l>Above his Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A whole Poem of this Kind may be ready againſt an enſuing Campagne, as well as a Space left in the Canvaſs of a Piece of Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry for the principal Figure, while the Under-Parts are working: So that in Effect, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſer copies after the Man he pretends to direct.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0397200201:24"/>
This Method ſhould, methinks, encourage young Beginners: For the Invention is ſo fitted to all Capacities, that by the Help of it a Man may make a Receipt for a Poem. A young Man may obſerve, that the Gigg of the Thing is, as I ſaid, finding out all that can be ſaid of his Way you employ to ſet forth your Worthy. <hi>Waller</hi> and <hi>Denham</hi> had worn out the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of <hi>Advice to a Painter:</hi> This Author has transferred the Work, and ſent his <hi>Advice to the Poets;</hi> that is to ſay, to the <hi>Turners of Verſe,</hi> as he calls 'em. Well, that Thought is worn out alſo, therefore he directs his Genius to the Loom, and will have a new Set of Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Honour of the laſt Year in <hi>Flanders.</hi> I muſt own to you, I approve extremely this Invention, and it might be improved for the Benefit of Manufactury: As, ſuppoſe an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Gentleman ſhould write a Poem of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to a Callico-Printer: Do you think there is a Girl in <hi>England,</hi> that would wear any Thing but <hi>The Taking of Liſle,</hi> or <hi>The Battle of Oudenarde?</hi> They would certainly be all the Faſhion, till the Heroes Abroad had cut out ſome more Parterns. I ſhould fancy ſmall Skirmiſhes might do for Under-Petticoats, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they had a Siege for the Upper. If our Adviſer were well imitated, many Induſtrious People might be put to Work. Little Mr. <hi>Dactile,</hi> now in the Room, who formerly writ a Song and a Half, is a Week gone in a very pretty Work, upon this Hint: He is writing an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram to a young Virgin who knits very well ('tis a Thouſand Pities he is a <hi>Jacobite</hi>): But his Epigram is by Way of Advice to this Damſel, to knit all the Actions of the <hi>Pretender</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> laſt Campagne in the Clock of a Stocking. It were endleſs to enumerate
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0397200201:25"/>
the many Hands and Trades that may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by Poets, of ſo uſeful a Turn as this Adviſer's. I ſhall think of it; and in this Time of Taxes, ſhall conſult a great Critick employed in the Cuſtom-houſe, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what Tax may be proper to put upon Knives, Seals, Rings, Hangings, Wrought-Beds, Gowns and Petticoats, where any of thoſe Commodities bear Motto's, or are worked upon Poetical Grounds.</p>

               <p>ALL Hearts at preſent pant for Two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies only, who have for ſome Time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed the Dominion of the Town. They are indeed both exceeding Charming, but differ very much in their Excellencies. The Beauty of <hi>Clariſſa</hi> is Soft, that of <hi>Chloe</hi> Piercing. When you look at <hi>Clariſſa,</hi> you ſee the moſt exact Harmony of Feature, Complexion, and Shape; you find in <hi>Chloe</hi> nothing extraordinary in any one of thoſe Particulars, but the whole Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man irreſiſtible. <hi>Clariſſa</hi> looks Languiſhing; <hi>Chloe</hi> Killing. <hi>Clariſſa</hi> never fails of gaining Admiration; <hi>Chloe</hi> of moving Deſire. The Gazers at <hi>Clariſſa</hi> are at firſt unconcerned, as if they were obſerving a fine Picture. They who behold <hi>Chloe,</hi> at the firſt Glance, diſcover Tranſport, as if they met their deareſt Friend. Theſe different Perfections are ſuitably repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the laſt great Painter <hi>Italy</hi> has ſent us, Mr. <hi>Jervaſe. Clariſſa</hi> is, by that skilful Hand, placed in a Manner that looks artleſs, and innocent of the Torments ſhe gives; <hi>Chloe</hi> drawn with a Livelineſs that ſhows ſhe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious, but not affected, of her Perfections. <hi>Clariſſa</hi> is a Shepherdeſs; <hi>Chloe</hi> a Country Girl. I muſt own, the Deſign of <hi>Chloe</hi>'s Picture ſhows, to me, great Maſtery in the Painter; for nothing could be better imagined than the Dreſs he has given her, of a Straw-Hat and Ribband, to repreſent that Sort of Beauty which enters the Heart with a certain Familiarity, and cheats it into a Belief, that it has received a Lover as well as an Object of Love. The Force of their different Beauties is ſeen alſo in the Effects it makes on their Lovers. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of <hi>Chloe</hi> are eternally gay and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed: Thoſe of <hi>Clariſſa,</hi> melancholy and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0397200201:29"/>
thoughtful. And as this Paſſion always changes the natural Man into a quite different Creature from what he was before, the Love of <hi>Chloe</hi> makes Coxcombs; that of <hi>Clariſſa,</hi> Madmen. There were of each Kind juſt now in this Room. Here was one that whiſtles, laughs, ſings, and cuts Capers, for Love of <hi>Chloe.</hi> Another has juſt now writ Three Lines to <hi>Clariſſa,</hi> then taken a Turn in the Garden, then came back again, then tore his Fragment, then called for ſome Chocolate, then went away without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chloe</hi> has ſo many Admirers in the Houſe at preſent, that there is too much Noiſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in my Narration: So that the Progreſs of the Loves of <hi>Clariſſa</hi> and <hi>Chloe,</hi> together with the Bottles that are drank each Night for the One, and the many Sighs which are uttered, and Songs written, on the Other, muſt be our Subject on future Occaſions.</p>

               <p>Letters from the <hi>Hay-market</hi> inform us, That on <hi>Saturday</hi> Night laſt the Opera of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> was performed with great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. This Intelligence is not very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us Friends of the Theatre; for the Stage being an Entertainment of the Reaſon and all our Faculties, this Way of being pleaſed with the Suſpence of 'em for Three Hours together, and being given up to the ſhallow Satisfaction of the Eyes and Ears only, ſeems to ariſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Degeneracy of our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than an Improvement of our Diverſions. That the Underſtanding has no Part in the Pleaſure is evident, from what theſe Letters very poſitively aſſert, to wit, That a great Part of the Performance was done in <hi>Italian:</hi> And a great Critick fell into Fits in the Gallery, at ſeeing, not only Time and Place, but Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

and Nations confuſed in the moſt incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Manner. His Spleen is ſo extremely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on this Occaſion, that he is going to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a Treatiſe againſt Opera's, which, he thinks, have already inclined us to Thoughts of Peace, and if tolerated, muſt infallibly diſpirit us from carrying on the War. He has communicated his Scheme to the whole Room, and declared in what Manner Things of this Kind were firſt introduced. He has upon this Occaſion conſidered the Nature of Sounds in general, and made a very elaborate Digreſſion upon the <hi>London Cries,</hi> wherein he has ſhown from Reaſon and Philoſophy, why Oyſters are cried, Card-matches ſung, and Turneps and all other Vegetables neither cried, ſung, nor ſaid, but ſold, with an Accent and Tone neither natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to Man or Beaſt. This Piece ſeems to be taken from the Model of that excellent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Mrs. <hi>Manly</hi> the School Miſtreſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Samplers. Advices from the upper End of <hi>Piccadilly</hi> ſay, That <hi>May-Fair</hi> is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aboliſhed; and we hear, Mr. <hi>Penkethman</hi> has removed his ingenious Company of Strollers to <hi>Greenwich:</hi> But other Letters from <hi>Deptford</hi> ſay, the Company is only making thither, and not yet ſettled; but that ſeveral Heathen Gods and Goddeſſes, which are to deſcend in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines, landed at the <hi>Kings-Head-Stairs</hi> laſt <hi>Saturday. Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupid</hi> went on Foot from thence to <hi>Greenwich; Mars</hi> got drunk in the Town, and broke his Landlord's Head, for which he ſate in the Stocks the whole Evening; but Mr. <hi>Penkethman</hi> giving Security that he ſhould do nothing this enſuing Summer, he was ſet at Liberty. The moſt melancholy Part of all, was, that <hi>Diana</hi> was taken in the Act of Fornication with a Boat-man, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0397200201:31"/>

               <p>Letters from the <hi>Hague</hi> of the 23d Inſtant, <hi>N.

               <p>Theſe Letters add, That an Expreſs arrived at the <hi>Hague</hi> on the 20th Inſtant, with Advice, That the Enemy having made a Detachment from <hi>Tournay</hi> of 1500 Horſe, each Trooper carrying a Foot Soldier behind him, in order to ſurpriſe the Garriſon of <hi>Aloſt;</hi> the Allies, upon Notice of their March, ſent out a ſtrong Body of Troops from <hi>Ghent,</hi> which engaged the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at <hi>Aſche,</hi> and took 200 of them Priſoners, obliging the reſt to retire without making any farther Attempt.

a Fleet of Merchant Ships coming from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> were attacked by Six <hi>French</hi> Privateers at the Entrance of the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> We have yet no certain Advice of the Event: But Letters from <hi>Rotterdam</hi> ſay, That a <hi>Dutch</hi> Man of War of Forty Guns, which was Convoy to the ſaid Fleet, was taken, as were alſo Eighteen of the Merchants.

               <p>I have lately been very ſtudious for Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and have juſt now, by my Aſtrological Flying-Poſt, received a Packet from <hi>Felicia,</hi> an Iſland in <hi>America,</hi> with an Account that gives me great Satisfaction, and lets me under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the Iſland was never in greater Proſperity, or the Adminiſtration in ſo good Hands, ſince the Death of their late glorious King. Theſe Letters import, That the Chief Miniſter has entered into a firm League with the ableſt and beſt Men of the Nation, to carry on the Cauſe of Liberty, to the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Religion, Virtue, and Honour. Thoſe Perſons at the Helm are ſo uſeful, and in themſelves of ſuch Weight, that their ſtrict Alliance muſt needs tend to the univerſal Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the People. <hi>Camillo,</hi> it ſeems, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides

The next Member of their Society is <hi>Horatio,</hi> who makes all the Publick Diſpatches. This Miniſter is Maſter of all the Languages in Uſe to great Perfection. He is held in the higheſt Veneration imaginable for a ſevere Honeſty, and Love of his Country: He lives in a Court unſullied with any of its Artifices, the Refuge of the Oppreſſed, and Terror of Oppreſſors. <hi>Martio</hi> has joined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this Council; a Man of moſt undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reſolution and great Knowledge in Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Affairs; famous for deſtroying the Navy of the <hi>Franks,</hi> and ſingularly happy in one Particular, That he never preferred a Man who has not proved remarkably ſerviceable to his Country. <hi>Philander</hi> is mentioned with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diſtinction; a Nobleman who has the moſt refined Taſt of the true Pleaſures and Elegance of Life, joined to an indefatigable Induſtry in Buſineſs: A Man eloquent in Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, agreeable in Converſation, and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous in all Manner of Publick Negotiations. Theſe Letters add, That <hi>Verono,</hi> who is alſo of this Council, has lately ſet Sail to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Patricia,</hi> with Deſign to confirm the Affections of the People in the Intereſts of his Queen. This Miniſter is Maſter of great Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and is as induſtrious and reſtleſs for the Preſervation of the Liberties of the People, as the greateſt Enemy can be to ſubvert them. The Influence of theſe Perſonages, who are Men of ſuch diſtinguiſhed Parts and Virtues,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0397200201:34"/>
makes the People enjoy the utmoſt Tranquility in the Midſt of a War, and gives them undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hopes of a ſecure Peace from their Vigilance and Integrity.</p>

               <p>This was long ago a witty Author's Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Evil ſtill continues; and if a Man of any Delicacy were to attend the Diſcourſes of the young Fellows of this Age, they would believe there were none but Proſtitutes to make the Objects of Paſſion. So true it is what the Author of the above Verſes ſaid, a little before his Death, of the modern Pretenders to Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry: <q rend="inline">"They ſet up for Wits in this Age, by ſaying when they are Sober, what they of the laſt ſpoke only when they were Drunk."</q> But <hi>Cupid</hi> is not only Blind at preſent, but Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drunk; he has loſt all his Faculties: Elſe how ſhould <hi>Celia</hi> be ſo long a Maid with that agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Behaviour? <hi>Corinna,</hi> with that ſprightly Wit? <hi>Lesbia,</hi> with that Heavenly Voice? And <hi>Sachariſſa,</hi> with all thoſe Excellencies in one Perſon, frequent the Park, the Play, and murder the poor Tits that drag her to publick Places, and not a Man turn pale at her Appearance? But ſuch is the fallen State of Love, that if it were not for honeſt <hi>Cynthio,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0397200201:35"/>
who is true to the Cauſe, we ſhould hardly have a Pattern left of the ancient Worthies that Way: And indeed he has but very little Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perſevere; but he has a Devotion, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Love, for his Miſtreſs; and ſays,<q>
                     <l>Only tell her that I love,</l>
                     <l>Leave the reſt to her, and Fate;</l>
                     <l>Some kind Planet from Above,</l>
                     <l>May, perhaps, her Paſſion move:</l>
                     <l>Lovers on their Stars muſt wait.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But the Stars I am ſo intimately acquainted with, that I can aſſure him he will never have her: For would you believe it, tho' <hi>Cynthio</hi> has Wit, Good Senſe, Fortune, and his very Being depends upon her, the Termagant for whom he fighs, is in Love with a Fellow, who ſtares in the Glaſs all the Time he is with her, and lets her plainly ſee, ſhe may poſſibly be his Rival, but never his Miſtreſs. Yet <hi>Cynthio,</hi> the ſame unhappy Man whom I mentioned in my firſt Narrative, pleaſes himſelf with a vain Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that with the Language of his Eyes, now he has found who ſhe is, he ſhall conquer her, though her Eyes are intent upon one who looks from her; which is ordinary with the Sex. It is certainly a Miſtake in the Ancients, to draw the little Gentleman, <hi>Love,</hi> as a blind Boy; for his real Character is, a little Thief that ſquints. For ask Mrs. <hi>Meddle,</hi> who is a Confident, or Spy, upon all the Paſſions in Town, and ſhe'll tell you, that the Whole is a Game of Croſs Purpoſes. The Lover is generally purſuing one who is in Purſuit of another, and running from one that deſires to meet him. Nay, the Nature of this Paſſion is ſo juſtly repreſented in a ſquinting little Thief, (who is always in a Double Action) that do but obſerve <hi>Clariſſa</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0397200201:36"/>
next Time you ſee her, and you'll find, when her Eyes have made their ſoft Tour round the Company, ſhe makes no Stay on him they ſay ſhe is to marry, but reſts Two Seconds of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute on <hi>Wildair,</hi> who neither looks nor thinks on her, or any Woman elſe. However, <hi>Cynthio</hi> had a Bow from her t'other Day, upon which he is very much come to himſelf; and I heard him ſend his Man of an Errand Yeſterday with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Manner of Heſitation; a Quarter of an Hour after which he reckoned Twenty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd he was to ſup with a Friend, and went exactly to his Appointment. I ſent to know how he did this Morning, and I find he hath not forgot that he ſpoke to me Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>

               <p>Letters from <hi>Italy</hi> ſay, That the Marquis <hi>de Prie,</hi> upon the Receipt of an Expreſs from the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> went immediately to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Cardinal <hi>Paulucci,</hi> Miniſter of State to his Holineſs, and demanded in the Name of his Imperial Majeſty, that King <hi>Charles</hi> ſhould be forthwith acknowledged King of <hi>Spain,</hi> by a ſolemn Act of the Congregation of Cardinals appointed for that Purpoſe: He declared at the ſame Time, That if the leaſt Heſitation were made in this moſt important Article of the late Treaty, he ſhould not only be obliged to leave <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf, but alſo tranſmit his Maſter's Orders to the Imperial Troops to face about, and return into the Eccleſiaſtical Dominions. When the Cardinal reported this Meſſage to the Pope, his Holineſs was ſtruck with ſo ſenſible an Affliction, that he burſt into Tears. His Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row was aggravated by Letters which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after arrived from the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> wherein his Nuncio acquainted him, That upon the News of his Accommodation with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, he had received a Meſſage to forbear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Court; and the People were ſo highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, that they could hardly be reſtrain'd from inſulting his Palace. Theſe Letters add, That the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was gone from <hi>Florence</hi> to <hi>Piſa,</hi> and from <hi>Piſa</hi> to <hi>Leghorn,</hi> where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour paid his Majeſty all imaginable Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.

               </p>
               <p>General <hi>Boneval,</hi> Governo of <hi>Commacchio,</hi> had ſummoned the Magiſtrates of all the Towns near that Place to appear before him, and take an Oath of Fidelity to his Imperial Majeſty, commanding alſo the Gentry to pay him Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, on Pain of Death and Confiſcation of Goods. Advices from <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> inform us, That the Bankers of <hi>Geneva</hi> were utterly rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Failure of Mr. <hi>Bernard.</hi> They add, That the Deputies of the <hi>Swiſs</hi> Cantons were returned from <hi>Soleure,</hi> where they were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the Inſtance of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador; but were very much diſſatisfied with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception they had from that Miniſter. 'Tis true, he omitted no Civilities, or Expreſſions of Friendſhip from his Maſter, but he took no Notice of their Penſions and Arrears; what further provoked their Indignation, was, That inſtead of 25 Piſtoles formerly allowed to each Member for their Charge in coming to the Diet, he had preſented them with 6 only. They write from <hi>Dreſden,</hi> That King <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was ſtill buſie in recruiting his Cavalry, and that the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Troops, which lately ſerved in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> had Orders to be in <hi>Saxony</hi> in the Middle of <hi>May,</hi> and that his Majeſty of <hi>Denmark</hi> was expected at <hi>Dreſden</hi> in the Beginning of that Month. King <hi>Auguſtus</hi> makes great Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for his Reception, and has appointed Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Coaches, each drawn by Six Horſes, for that Purpoſe: The Interview of theſe Princes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords great Matter for Speculation. Letters from <hi>Paris</hi> of the 22d of this Month ſay, That Mareſchal <hi>Harcourt</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0397200201:39"/>
were preparing to go into <hi>Alſace</hi> and <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> but that their Troops were in Want of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Neceſſaries.

               <p>At the Siege of <hi>Namur</hi> by the Allies, there were in the Ranks of the Company commanded by Captain <hi>Pincent,</hi> in Colonel <hi>Frederick Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Regiment, one <hi>Unnion</hi> a Corporal, and one <hi>Valentine</hi> a private Centinel: There happened between theſe Two Men a Diſpute about a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Love, which, upon ſome Aggravations, grew to an irreconcileable Hatred. <hi>Unnion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Officer of <hi>Valentine,</hi> took all Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties even to ſtrike his Rival, and profeſs the Spite and Revenge which moved him to it.

They had ſpent whole Months thus, one injuring, the other complaining; when in the Midſt of this Rage towards each other, they were commanded upon the Attack of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, where the Corporal received a Shot in the Thigh, and fell; the <hi>French</hi> preſſing on, and he expecting to be trampled to Death, called out to his Enemy, Ah, <hi>Valentine!</hi> Can you leave me here? <hi>Valentine</hi> immediately ran back, and in the Midſt of a thick Fire of the <hi>French,</hi> took the Corporal upon his Back, and brought him thro' all that Danger as far as the Abbey of <hi>Salſine,</hi> where a Cannon-Ball took off his Head: His Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy fell under his Enemy whom he was carrying
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0397200201:41"/>
off. <hi>Unnion</hi> immediately forgot his Wound, roſe up, tearing his Hair, and then threw himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bleeding Carcaſs, crying, Ah <hi>Valentine!</hi> Was it for me, who have ſo barbarouſly uſed thee, that thou haſt died? I will not live after thee. He was not by any Means to be forced from the Body, but was removed with it bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Arms, and attended with Tears by all their Comrades, who knew their Enmity. When he was brought to a Tent, his Wounds were dreſſed by Force; but the next Day, ſtill calling upon <hi>Valentine,</hi> and lamenting his Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to him, he died in the Pangs of Remorſe and Deſpair.</p>
               <p>It may be a Queſtion among Men of Noble Sentiments, Whether of theſe unfortunate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had the greater Soul, he that was ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as to venture his Life for his Enemy, or he who could not ſurvive the Man that died, in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him ſuch an Obligation?</p>
               <p>When we ſee Spirits like theſe in a People, to what Heights may we not ſuppoſe their Glory may ariſe, but (as it is excellently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by <hi>Salluſt</hi>) it is not only to the general Bent of a Nation that great Revolutions are owing, but to the extraordinary Genio's that lead 'em. On which Occaſion he proceeds to ſay, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatneſs was neither to be attributed to their ſuperior Poli y, for in that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> excelled; nor to their Valour, for in that the <hi>French</hi> were preferable; but to particular Men, who were born for the Good of their Country, and formed for great Attempts. This he ſays to introduce the Characters of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Cato.</hi> It would be entring into too weighty a Diſcourſe for this Place, if I attempted to ſhow, that our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has produced as great and able Men for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0397200201:42"/>
publick Affairs as any other. But I believe, the Reader outruns me, and fixes his Imagination upon the Duke of <hi>Marlborough.</hi> It is, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, a pleaſing Reflection to conſider the Diſpenſations of Providence in the Fortune of this Illuſtrious Man, who, in the Space of Forty Years, has paſſed through all the Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Humane Life, till he has aſcended to the Character of a Prince, and become the Scourge of a Tyrant, who ſate in one of the greateſt Thrones of <hi>Europe,</hi> before the Man who was to have the greateſt Part in his Downfal had made one Step in the World. But ſuch Elevations are the Natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of an exact Prudence, a calm Courage, a well governed Temper, a patient Ambition, and an affable Behaviour. Theſe Arts, as they are the Steps to his Greatneſs, ſo they are the Pillars of it now it is raiſed. To this her Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Son, <hi>Great Britain</hi> is indebted for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Conduct of her Arms, in whom ſhe can boaſt, She has produced a Man formed by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to lead a Nation of Heroes.</p>

without further Reflection. As I came into the Room, ſhe cries, Oh! Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> I am utterly undone! I have broke that pretty <hi>Italian</hi> Fan I ſhowed you when you were here laſt, wherein were ſo admirably drawn our Firſt Parents in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> aſleep in each other's Arms. But there is ſuch an Affinity between Painting and Poetry, that I have been impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Images which were raiſed by that Picture, by reading the ſame Repreſentation in Two of our greateſt Poets. Look you, here are the Paſſages in <hi>Milton</hi> and in <hi>Dryden.</hi> All <hi>Milton</hi>'s Thoughts are wonderfully juſt and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, in this inimitable Deſcription which <hi>Adam</hi> makes of himſelf in the Eighth Book of <hi>Paradiſe Loſt.</hi> But there is none of them finer than that contained in the following Lines, where he tells us his Thoughts when he was falling aſleep a little after his Creation:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>While thus I call'd, and ſtray'd I know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</l>
                  <l>From whence I firſt drew Air, and firſt beheld</l>
                  <l>This happy Light; when Anſwer none return'd,</l>
                  <l>On a green ſhady Bank, profuſe of Flowers,</l>
                  <l>Penſive I ſate me down, there gentle Sleep</l>
                  <l>Firſt found me, and with ſoft Oppreſſion ſeiz'd</l>
                  <l>My drowned Senſe, untroubled, though I thought</l>
                  <l>I then was paſſing to my former State,</l>
                  <l>Inſenſible and forthwith to diſſolve.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But now I can't forgive this odious Thing: This <hi>Dryden,</hi> who, in his <hi>State of Innocence,</hi> has given my Great-Grandmother <hi>Eve</hi> the ſame Apprehenſion of Annihilation on a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Occaſion: As <hi>Adam</hi> pronounces it of himſelf. when he was ſeized with a pleaſing Kind of Stupor and Deadneſs, <hi>Eve</hi> fancies her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0397200201:44"/>
falling away, and diſſolving in the Hurry of a Rapture. However, the Verſes are very good, and I don't know but it may be natural what ſhe ſays. I'll read 'em:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>When your kind Eyes look'd languiſhing on mine,</l>
                  <l>And wreathing Arms did ſoft Embraces join;</l>
                  <l>A doubtful Trembling ſeiz'd me firſt all o'er,</l>
                  <l>Then Wiſhes, and a Warmth unknown before:</l>
                  <l>What follow'd, was all Extaſie and Trance,</l>
                  <l>Immortal Pleaſures round my ſwimming Eyes did dance;</l>
                  <l>And ſpeechleſs Joys, in whoſe ſweet Tumults toſt,</l>
                  <l>I thought my Breath and my New Being loſt.</l>
               </q>
               <p>She went on, and ſaid a Thouſand good Things at Random, but ſo ſtrangely mixed, that you would be apt to ſay, All her Wit is meer good Luck, and not the Effect of Reaſon and Judgment. When I made my Eſcape hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I found a Gentleman playing the Critick on Two other great Poets, even <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi> He was obſerving, that <hi>Virgil</hi> is more judicious than the other in the Epithets he gives his Hero. <hi>Homer</hi>'s uſual Epithet, ſaid he, is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and his Indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been often rallied by the Criticks, for mentioning the Nimbleneſs of Foot in <hi>Achilles,</hi> though he deſcribes him ſtanding, ſitting, lying down, fighting, eating, drinking, or in any other Circumſtance, however foreign or repugnant to Speed and Activity. <hi>Virgil</hi>'s common Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> is <hi>Pius,</hi> or <hi>Pater.</hi> I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſidered, ſaid he, what Paſſage there is in any of his Hero's Actions, where either of theſe Appellations would have been moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, to ſee if I could catch him at the ſame Fault with <hi>Homer:</hi> And this, I think, is his Meeting with <hi>Dido</hi> in the Cave, where <hi>Pius</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0397200201:45"/>
                  <hi>Aeneas</hi> would have been Abſurd, and <hi>Pater Aeneas</hi> a Burleſque: The Poet has therefore wiſely dropped 'em both for <hi>Dux Trojanus.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Speluncam Dido Dux &amp; Trojanus candem</l>
                     <l>Deveniunt, —</l>
                  </q> Which he has repeated twice in <hi>Juno</hi>'s Speech, and his own Narration: For he very well knew, a looſe Action might be conſiſtent enough with the uſual Manners of a Soldier, tho' it became neither the Chaſtity of a Pious Man, nor the Gravity of the Father of a People.</p>

               <p>While other Parts of the Town are amuſed with the preſent Actions, we generally ſpend the Evening at this Table in Enquiries into An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and think any Thing News which gives us new Knowledge. Thus we are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a very pleaſant Entertainment to our ſelves, in putting the Actions of <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Iliad</hi> into an exact Journal.</p>
               <p>This Poem is introduced by <hi>Chryſes,</hi> King of <hi>Chryſeis,</hi> and Prieſt of <hi>Apollo,</hi> who comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demand his Daughter, who was carried off at the Taking of that City, and given to <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> for his Part of the Booty. The Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal he received enrages <hi>Apollo,</hi> who for Nine Days ſhowered down Darts upon them, which occaſioned the Peſtilence.</p>
               <p>The 10th Day <hi>Achilles</hi> aſſembles the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and encourages <hi>Calchas</hi> to ſpeak for the Surrender of <hi>Chryſeis</hi> to appeaſe <hi>Apollo. Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> ſtorm at one another, notwithſtanding which <hi>Agamemnon</hi> will not releaſe his Priſoner, unleſs he has <hi>Briſeis</hi> in her Stead. After long Conteſtations, wherein <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> gives a glorious Character of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>'s Valour, he determines to reſtore <hi>Briſeis</hi> to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0397200201:46"/>
her Father, and ſends Two Heralds to fetch away <hi>Chryſeis</hi> from <hi>Achilles,</hi> who abandons him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Sorrow and Deſpair. His Mother <hi>Thetis</hi> came to comfort him under his Affliction, and promiſes to repreſent his ſorrowful Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to <hi>Jupiter:</hi> But he could not attend it; for the Evening before, he had appointed to divert himſelf for Two Days beyond the Seas with the harmleſs <hi>Aethiopians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twas the 21ſt Day after <hi>Chryſeis</hi>'s Arrival to the Camp, that <hi>Thetis</hi> went very early to demand an Audience of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> The Means he uſes to ſatisfie her were, to perſwade the <hi>Greeks</hi> to attack the <hi>Trojans;</hi> that ſo they might perceive the Conſequence of contemning <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> and the Miſeries they ſuffer if he does not head them. The next Night he orders <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi> in a Dream, to attack them; who was deceived with the Hopes of obtaining a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and alſo taking the City without ſharing the Honour with <hi>Achilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 22d in the Morning, he aſſembles the Council, and having made a Feint of raiſing the Siege and retiring, he declares to them his Dream; and, together with <hi>Neſtor</hi> and <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> reſolves on an Engagement.</p>
               <p>This was the 23d Day, which is full of Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and which continues from almoſt the Beginning of the Second Canto to the Eighth. The Armies being then drawn up in View of one another, <hi>Hector</hi> brings it about, that <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> the Two Perſons concerned in the Quarrel, ſhould decide it by a ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat; which tending to the Advantage of <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> was interrupted by a Cowardice infuſed by <hi>Minerva:</hi> Then both Armies engage, where the <hi>Trojans</hi> have the Diſadvantage; but being afterwards animated by <hi>Apollo,</hi> they repulſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0397200201:47"/>
the Enemy, yet they are once again forced to give Ground; but their Affairs were retrieved by <hi>Hector,</hi> who has a ſingle Combat with <hi>Ajax.</hi> The Gods threw themſelves into the Battle, Juno and <hi>Minerva</hi> took the <hi>Gracians</hi> Part, and <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> the <hi>Trojans:</hi> But <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> are both wounded by <hi>Diomedes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Truce for burying the Slain ended the 23d Day; after which the <hi>Greeks</hi> threw up a great Intrenchment to ſecure their Navy from Danger. Councils are held on both Sides. On the Morning of the 24th Day, the Battle is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, but in a very diſadvantagious Manner to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who were beaten back to their Retrenchments. <hi>Agamemnon</hi> being in Deſpair at this ill Succeſs, propoſes to the Counſel to quit the Enterprize and retire from <hi>Troy.</hi> But by the Advice of <hi>Neſtor,</hi> he is perſwaded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>Achilles,</hi> by returning <hi>Chryſeis,</hi> and ſending him conſiderable Preſents. Hereupon, <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> and <hi>Ajax</hi> are ſent to that Hero, who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues inflexible in his Anger. <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> at his Return, joins himſelf with <hi>Diomedes,</hi> and goes in the Night to gain Intelligence of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: They enter into their very Camp, where, finding the Centinels aſleep, they made a great Slaughter. <hi>Rheſus,</hi> who was juſt then arrived with Recruits from <hi>Thrace</hi> for the <hi>Trojans,</hi> was killed in that Action. Here ends the 10th Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The Sequel of this Journal will be inſerted in the next Article from this Place.</p>

               <p>The preſent great Captains of the Age, the Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi> and Prince <hi>Eugene,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been the Subject of the Diſcourſe of the laſt Company I was in, it has naturally led me into a Conſideration of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the Two greateſt Names which ever appeared before this Century. In order to enter into their Characters, there needs no more but exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining their Behaviour in Parallel Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. It muſt be allowed, That they had an equal Greatneſs of Soul; but <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s was more corrected and allayed by a Mixture of Prudence and Circumſpection. This is ſeen conſpicuouſly in one Particular in their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wherein they ſeem to have ſhown exactly the Difference of their Tempers. When <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> after a long Courſe of Victories, would ſtill have led his Soldiers farther from Home, they unanimouſly refuſed to follow him. We meet with the like Behaviour in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Army in the Midſt of his March againſt <hi>Arioviſtus.</hi> Let us therefore obſerve the Conduct of our Two Generals in ſo nice an Affair: And here we find <hi>Alexander</hi> at the Head of his Army, upbraiding them with their Cowardice, and Meanneſs of Spirit; and in the End, telling them plainly, He would go forward himſelf, though not a Man followed him. This ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indeed an exceſſive Bravery; but how would the Commander have come off, if the Speech had not ſucceeded, and the Soldiers had taken him at his Word? The Project ſeems of a Piece with Mr. <hi>Bays</hi>'s in the <hi>Rehearſal,</hi> who, to gain a Clap in his Prologue, comes out, with a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Fellow in a Fur-Cap following him, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0397200201:51"/>
tells his Audience, If they would not like his Play, he would lie down and have his Head ſtruck off. If this gained a Clap, all was well; but if not, there was nothing left but for the Executioner to do his Office. But <hi>Caeſar</hi> would not leave the Succeſs of his Speech to ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Events: He ſhews his Men the Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of their Fears in an obliging Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and concludes, That if none elſe would march along with them, he would go himſelf with the Tenth Legion, for he was aſſured of their Fidelity and Valour, though all the reſt forſook him; not but that in all Probability they were as much againſt the March as the reſt. The Reſult of all was very natural: The Tenth Legion fired with the Praiſes of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ſend Thanks to him for the juſt Opinion he entertains of 'em; and the reſt, aſhamed to be outdone, aſſure him, That they are as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to follow where he pleaſes to lead them, as any other Part of the Army.</p>

               <p>Thus far, in as brief and intelligible a Manner as any Will can appear, till it is explained by the Learned, I have diſpoſed of my Real and Perſonal Eſtate: But, as I am an Adept, I have by Birth an equal Right to give alſo an indefea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Title to my Endowments and Qualifications; which I do in the following Manner:</p>
               <p>

               <p>The Body ſhall be carried by Six Watchmen, who are never ſeen in the Day.</p>

               <p>To make my Funeral (what that Solemnity, when done to common Men, really is in it ſelf) a very Farce; and ſince all Mourners are meer Actors on theſe Occaſions, I ſhall deſire thoſe who are profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly ſuch, to attend me. I humbly therefore beſeech Mrs. <hi>Barry</hi> to act once more, and be my Widow-When ſhe ſwoons away at the Church-Porch, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Merry Sir <hi>John Falſtaff,</hi> and the Gay Sir <hi>Harry Wildair,</hi> to ſupport her.

In ſhort, he was in his whole Perſon and Dreſs ſo extremely ſouſed, that there did not appear one Inch or ſingle Thread about him unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. Pardon me, that the melancholy Object ſtill dwells upon me ſo far as to reduce me to Punning. However, we attended to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, where we ſtay'd to hear the irrevocable Words pronounced upon our old Servant, and made the beſt of our Way to Town. I took a Reſolution to forbear all married Perſons, or any in Danger of being ſuch, for Four and twenty Hours at leaſt; therefore dreſſed, and went to viſit <hi>Florimell,</hi> the vaineſt Thing in Town, where I knew would drop in Colonel <hi>Picket,</hi> juſt come from the Camp, her profeſſed Admirer. He is of that Order of Men who has much Honour and Merit, but withal a Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb; the other of that Set of Females who has Innocence and Wit, but the Firſt of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets. It is eaſy to believe, Theſe muſt be Admirers of each other. She ſays, The Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel rides the beſt of any Man in <hi>England:</hi> The Colonel ſays, She talks the beſt of any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. At the ſame Time, he underſtands Wit juſt as ſhe does Horſemanſhip. You are to know, theſe extraordinary Perſons ſee each other dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and they themſelves, as well as the Town, think it will be a Match: But it can never happen that they can come to the Point; for inſtead of addreſſing to each other, they ſpend their whole Time in Reports of themſelves: He is ſatisfied if he can convince her he is a fine Gentleman, and a Man of Conſequence; and ſhe, in appearing to him an accompliſhed Lady and a Wit, without further Deſign. Thus he tells her of his Manner of poſting his Men at ſuch a Paſs, with the Numbers he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded on that Detachment: She tells him,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0397200201:57"/>
how ſhe was dreſſed on ſuch a Day at Court, and what Offers were made her the Week following. She ſeems to hear the Repetition of his Men's Names with Admiration; and waits only to anſwer him with as falſe a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Lovers. They talk to each other not to be informed, but approved. Thus they are ſo like, that they are to be ever diſtant, and the Parallel Lines may run together for ever, but never meet.</p>

               <p>Letters from <hi>Rome,</hi> dated the 13th Inſtant, ſay, That on the preceding <hi>Sunday</hi> his Holineſs was carried in an open Chair from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s to St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, attended by the Sacred College, in Cavalcade; and, after Maſs, diſtributed ſeveral Dowries for the Marriage of poor and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgins.

by the 15th Inſtant, he will retire from that Court, and order the Imperial Troops to return into the Ecclefiaſtical State.

               <p>THE Play of <hi>The London Cuckolds</hi> was acted this Evening before a ſuitable Audience, who were extremely well diverted with that Heap of Vice and Abſurdity. The Indignation which <hi>Eugenio,</hi> who is a Gentleman of a juſt Taſt, has, upon Occaſion of ſeeing humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fall ſo low in their Delights, made him, I thought, expatiate upon the Mention of this Play very agreeably. Of all Men living, ſaid he, I pity Players, (who muſt be Men of good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to be capable of being ſuch) that they are obliged to repeat and aſſume proper Geſtures for repreſenting Things of which their Reaſon muſt be aſhamed, and which they muſt diſdain their Audience for approving. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of theſe low Gratifications is only to be made by People of Condition, by encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Preſentation of the Noble Characters drawn by <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> and others, from whence it is impoſſible to return without ſtrong Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Honour and Humanity. On theſe Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, Diſtreſs is laid before us with all its Cauſes and Conſequences, and our Reſentment placed according to the Merit of the Perſons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. Were <hi>Drama</hi>'s of this Nature more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Taſt of the Town, Men who have Genius would bend their Studies to excel in 'em. How forcible an Effect this would have on our Minds, one needs no more than to obſerve
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0397200201:62"/>
how ſtrongly we are touched by meer Pictures. Who can ſee <hi>Le Brun</hi>'s Picture of the Battle of <hi>Porus,</hi> without entring into the Character of that fierce gallant Man, and being accordingly ſpurred to an Emulation of his Conſtancy and Courage? When he is falling with his Wound, the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are at the ſame Time very terrible and languiſhing; and there is ſuch a ſtern Faintneſs diffuſed through all his Look, as is apt to move a kind of Horrour, as well as Pity in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder. This, I ſay, is an Effect wrought by meer Lights and Shades, conſider alſo a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation made by Words only, as in an Account given by a good Writer: <hi>Catiline</hi> in <hi>Salluſt</hi> makes juſt ſuch a Figure as <hi>Porus</hi> by <hi>Le Brun.</hi> It is ſaid of him, Catilina <hi>vero longe a ſuis inter Hoſtium Cadavera repertus eſt; paululum etiam ſpirans, Ferocitatemque Animi quam vivus habue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat in Vultu retinens.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'<hi>Catiline</hi> was found kill'd far from his own Men among the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Enemy: He ſeemed ſtill to breath, and ſtill retained in his Face the ſame Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he had when he was living."</q> You have in that one Sentence a lively Impreſſion of his whole Life and Actions. What I would inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate from all this, is, That if the Painter and the Hiſtorian can do thus much in Colours and Language, what may not be performed by an excellent Poet? When the Character he draws is repreſented by the Perſon, the Manner, the Look, and the Motion, of an accompliſhed Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: If a Thing painted or related can irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enter our Hearts, what may not be brought to paſs by ſeeing generous Things performed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Eyes? <hi>Eugenio</hi> ended his Diſcourſe, by recommending the apt Uſe of a Theatre, as the moſt agreeable and eaſie Method of making a polite and moral Gentry, which would end in rendring the reſt of the People regular in their
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0397200201:63"/>
Behaviour, and ambitious of laudable Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.</p>

               <p>After the Laſſitude of a Day ſpent in the ſtrolling Manner, which is uſual with Men of Pleaſure in this Town, and with a Head full of a Million of Impertinencies, which had danced round it for Ten Hours together, I came to my Lodging, and haſtened to Bed. My Valet de Chambre knows my Univerſity. Trick of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there; and he being a good Scholar for a Gentleman, ran over the Names of <hi>Horace, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullus, Ovid,</hi> and others, to know which I would have. Bring <hi>Virgil,</hi> ſaid I, and if I fall aſleep, take Care of the Candle. I read the Sixth Book over with the moſt exquiſite De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and had gone half through it a ſecond Time, when the pleaſing Idea's of <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0397200201:65"/>
deceaſed Worthies walking in them, ſincere Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers enjoying their Languiſhment without Pain, Compaſſion for the unhappy Spirits who had miſpent their ſhort Day-light, and were exiled from the Seats of Bliſs for ever; I ſay, I was deep again in my Reading, when this Mixture of Images had taken Place of all others in my Imagination before, and lulled me into a Dream, from which I am juſt awake, to my great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage. The happy Manſions of <hi>Elyſium</hi> by Degrees ſeemed to be wafted from me, and the very Traces of my late walking Thoughts began to fade away, when I was caſt by a ſudden Whirlwind upon an Iſland, encompaſſed with a roaring and troubled Sea, which ſhak'd its very Centre, and rocked its Inhabitants as in a Cradle. The Iſlanders lay on their Faces with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offering to look up, or hope for Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all her Harbours were crowded with Mariners, and tall Veſſels of War lay in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being driven to Pieces on her Shores. Bleſs me! ſaid I, why have I lived in ſuch a Manner, that the Convulſion of Nature ſhould be ſo terrible to me, when I feel in my ſelf, that the better Part of me is to ſurvive it? Oh! may that be in Happineſs. A ſudden Shriek, in which the whole People on their Faces join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, interrupted my Soliloquy, and turned my Eyes and Attention to the Object which had given us that ſudden Start, in the Midſt of an inconſolable and ſpeechleſs Affliction. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the Winds grew calm, the Waves ſubſided, and the People ſtood up, turning their Faces upon a magnificent Pile in the Midſt of the Iſland. There we beheld an Hero of a comely and erect Aſpect, but pale and languid, ſitting under a Canopy of State. By the Faces and dumb Sorrow of thoſe who attended, we thought him in the Article of Death. At a Diſtance ſate a Lady, whoſe Life ſeemed to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0397200201:66"/>
hang upon the ſame Thread with his: She kept her Eyes fixed upon him, and ſeemed to ſmother Ten Thouſand Thouſand nameleſs Things, which urged her Tenderneſs to claſp him in her Arms: But her Greatneſs of Spirit overcame thoſe Sentiments, and gave her Power to forbear diſturbing his laſt Moment; which immediately approached. The Hero looked up with an Air of Negligence, and Satiety of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rather than of Pain to leave it; and leaning back his Head, expired.</p>
               <p>When the Heroine, who ſate at a Diſtance, ſaw his laſt Inſtant come, ſhe threw her ſelf at his Feet, and kneeling, preſſed his Hand to her Lips; in which Poſture ſhe continued under the Agony of an unutterable Sorrow, till con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from our Sight by her Attendants. That commanding Awe, which accompanies the Grief of great Minds, reſtrained the Multitude while in her Preſence; but as ſoon as ſhe retired, they gave Way to their Diſtraction, and all the Iſlanders called upon their deceaſed Hero. To him, methought, they cried out, as to a Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Being, and I gathered from their broken Accents, That it was he who had the Empire over the Ocean and its Powers, by which he had long protected the Iſland from Shipwreck and Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. They now give a Looſe to their Moan, and think themſelves expoſed without Hopes of Humane or Divine Aſſiſtance. While the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ran wild, and expreſſed all the different Forms of Lamentation, methought a Sable Cloud over-ſhadowed the whole Land, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered its Inhabitants with Darkneſs: No Glimpſe of Light appeared, except one Ray from Heaven upon the Place in which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine now ſecluded her ſelf from the World, with her Eyes fixed on thoſe Abodes to which her Conſort was aſcended. Methought a long Period of Time had paſſed away in Mourning
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0397200201:67"/>
and in Darkneſs, when a Twilight began by Degrees to enlighten the Hemiſphere; and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round me, I ſaw a Boat rowed towards the Shore, in which ſate a Perſonage adorned with Warlike Trophies, bearing on his left Arm a Shield, on which was engraven the Image of <hi>Victory,</hi> and in his Right Hand a Branch of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. His Viſage was at once ſo winning and ſo awful, that the Shield and the Olive ſeemed equally ſuitable to his Genius.</p>
               <p>When this illuſtrious <note n="*" place="bottom">About this Time the D. of <hi>M.</hi> returned from <hi>Holland</hi> with the Preliminaries of a Peace.</note> Perſon touched on the Shore, he was received by the Acclamations of the People, and followed to the Palace of the Heroine. No Pleaſure in the Glory of her Arms, or the Acclamations of her applauding Subjects, were ever capable to ſuſpend her Sorrow for one Moment, till ſhe ſaw the Olive Branch in the Hand of that auſpicious Meſſenger. At that Sight, as Heaven beſtows its Bleſſings on the Wants and Importunities of Mortals, out of its Native Bounty, and not to encreaſe its own Power or Honour, in Compaſſion to the World, the Celeſtial Mourner was then firſt ſeen to turn her Regard to Things below; and taking the Branch out of the Warrior's Hand, looked at it with much Satisfaction, and ſpoke of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Peace, with a Voice and Accent, ſuch as that in which Guardian Spirits whiſper to dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Penitents Aſſurances of Happineſs. The Air was huſhed, the Multitude attentive, and all Nature in a Pauſe, while ſhe was ſpeaking. But as ſoon as the Meſſenger of Peace had made ſome low Reply, in which, methought, I heard the Word <hi>Iberia,</hi> the Heroine aſſuming a more ſevere Air, but ſuch as ſpoke Reſolution, without Rage, returned him the Olive, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0397200201:68"/>
again veiled her Face. Loud Cries and Claſhing of Arms immediately followed, which forced me from my charming Viſion, and drove me back to theſe Manſions of Care and Sorrow.</p>

               <p>THis Evening we were entertained with <hi>The Old Batchelor,</hi> a Comedy of deſerved Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. In the Character which gives Name to the Play, there is excellently repreſented the Reluctance of a battered Debauchee to come into the Trammels of Order and Decency: He neither languiſhes nor burns, but frets, for Love. The Gentlemen of more regular Behaviour are drawn with much Spirit and Wit, and the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> introduced by the Dialogue of the firſt Scens with uncommon, yet natural, Converſation. The Part of <hi>Fondlewife</hi> is a lively Image of the unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Fondneſs of Age and impotence. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſuch agreeable Works as theſe, the Town has this half Age been tormented with Inſects, called <hi>Eaſie Writers,</hi> whoſe Abilities Mr. <hi>Wicherly</hi> one Day deſcribed excellently well in one Word: <hi>That,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>among theſe Fellows is called</hi> Eaſy Writing, <hi>which any one may eaſily write.</hi> Such Jantie Scribblers are ſo juſtly laughed at for their Sonnets on <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Chloris,</hi> and Fantaſtical Deſcriptions in 'em, that an ingenious Kinſman of mine, of the Family of the <hi>Staffs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Humphrey Wagſtaff</hi> by Name, has, to avoid their Strain, run into a Way perfectly new, and deſcribed Things exactly as they happen: He never forms Fields, or Nymphs, or Groves, where they are not, but
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0397200201:69"/>
makes the Incidents juſt as they really appear. For an Example of it, I ſtole out of his Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript the following Lines: They are a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Morning, but of the Morning in Town; nay, of the Morning at this End of the Town, where my Kinſman at preſent lodges.</p>

                  <l>The Youth with broomy Stumps began to trace</l>
                  <l>The Kennel Edge, where Wheels had worn the Place.</l>
                  <l>The Smallcoal Man was heard with Cadence deep,</l>

                  <l>Duns at his Lordſhip's Gate began to meet;</l>

               <p>All that I apprehend is, that dear <hi>Numps</hi> will be angry I have publiſhed theſe Lines; not that he has any Reaſon to be aſhamed of them, but for fear of thoſe Rogues, the Bane to all excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Performances, the <hi>Imitators.</hi> Therefore, beforehand, I bar all Deſcriptions of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as, a Medley of Verſes ſignifying, Grey-Peas are now cried warm: That Wenches now begin to amble round the Paſſages of the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe: Or of Noon; as, That find Ladies and great Beaux are juſt yawning out of their Beds and Windows in <hi>Pall-Mall,</hi> and ſo forth.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0397200201:70"/>
Man who ſhall go about to imitate him, that he will be very inſipid. The Family Stock is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked in this Deſign, and we will not admit of Counterfeits: Dr. <hi>Anderſon</hi> and his Heirs enjoy his Pills, Sir <hi>Willium Read</hi> has the Cure of Eyes, and Monſieur <hi>Roſelli</hi> can only cure the Gout. We pretend to none of theſe Things; but to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine who and who are together, to tell any miſtaken Man he is not what he believes he is, to diſtinguiſh Merit, and expoſe falſe Pretences to it, is a Liberty our Family has by Law in 'em, from an Inter-Marriage with a Daughter of Mr. <hi>Scoggin,</hi> the famous Droll of the laſt Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This Right I deſign to make Uſe of; but will not encroach upon the above-mentioned Adepts, or any other. At the ſame Time I ſhall take all the Privileges I may, as an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and will lay hold of the late Act of Naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to introduce what I ſhall think fit from <hi>France.</hi> The Uſe of that Law may, I hope, be extended to people the polite World with new Characters, as well as the Kingdom it ſelf with new Subjects. Therefore an Author of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, called <hi>Le Bruyere,</hi> I ſhall make bold with on ſuch Occaſions. The laſt Perſon I read of in that Writer, was, Lord <hi>Timon. Timon,</hi> ſays my Author, is the moſt generous of all Men; but is ſo hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with that ſtrong Impulſe of Beſtowing, that he confers Benefits without Diſtinction, and is Munificent without laying Obligations. For all the Unworthy, who receive from him, have ſo little Senſe of this noble Infirmity, that they look upon themſelves rather as Partners in a Spoil, than Partakers of a Bounty. The other Day, coming into <hi>Paris,</hi> I met <hi>Timon</hi> going out on Horſeback, attended only by one Servant. It ſtruck me with a ſudden Damp, to ſee a Man of ſo excellent a Diſpoſition, and that underſtood making a Figure ſo very well, ſo much ſhorten'd
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0397200201:71"/>
in his Retinue. But paſſing by his Houſe, I ſaw his great Coach break to Pieces before his Door, and, by a ſtrange Inchantment, immediately turned into many different Vehicles. The firſt was a very pretty Chariot, into which ſtep'd his Lordſhip's Secretary. The ſecond was hung a little heavier; into that ſtrutted the Fat Steward. In an Inſtant follow'd a Chaiſe, which was enter'd by the Butler. The reſt of the Body and Wheels were forthwith changed into Go-carts, and ran away with by the Nurſes and Brats of the reſt of the Family What makes theſe Misfortunes in the Affairs of <hi>Timon</hi> the more aſtoniſhing, is, That he has a better Underſtanding than thoſe who cheat him; ſo that a Man knows not which more to wonder at, the Indifference of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or the Impud nce of the Servant.</p>

               <p>It is a Matter of much Speculation among the Beaus and Oglers, what it is that can have made ſo ſuddeu a Change, as has been of late obſerved, in the whole Behaviour of <hi>Paſtorella,</hi> who never ſate ſtill a Moment till ſhe was Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, which ſhe has now exceeded by Two Months. Her Aunt, who has the Care of her, has not been always ſo rigid as ſhe is at this preſent Date; but has ſo good a Senſe of the Frailty of Woman, and Falſhood of Man, that ſhe reſolved on all Manner of Methods to keep <hi>Paſtorella,</hi> if poſſible, in Safety, againſt her ſelf, and all her Admirers. At the ſame Time the good Lady knew by long Experience, that a gay Inclination, curbed too raſhly, would but run to the greater Exceſſes for that Reſtraint: Therefore intended to watch her, and take ſome Opportunity of engaging her inſenſibly in her own Intereſts, without the Anguiſh of an Admonition. You are to know then, That Miſs, with all her Flirting and Ogling, had alſo
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0397200201:72"/>
naturally a ſtrong Curioſity in her, and was the greateſt Eves-Dropper breathing. <hi>Pariſatis</hi> (for ſo her prudent Aunt is called) obſerved this Humour, and retires one Day to her Cloſet, into which ſhe knew <hi>Paſtorella</hi> would peep, and liſten to know how ſhe was employed. It happened accordingly, and the young Lady ſaw her good Governante on her Knees, and after a mental Behaviour, break into theſe Words: <hi>As for the dear Child committed to my Care, let her Sobriety of Carriage, and Severity of Behaviour, be ſuch, as may make that Noble Lord, who is taken with her Beauty, turn his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to ſuch as are honourable.</hi> Here <hi>Pariſatis</hi> heard her Neece neſtle cloſer to the Key-Hole: She then goes on; <hi>Make her the joyful Mother of a numerous and wealthy Offspring; and let her Carriage be ſuch, as may make this Noble Youth expect the Bleſſings of an happy Marriage, from the Singularity of her Life, in this looſe and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious Age.</hi> Miſs having heard enough, ſneaks off for Fear of Diſcovery, and immediately, at her Glaſs, alters the Sitting of her Head; then pulls up her Tucker, and forms herſelf into the exact Manner of <hi>Lindamira:</hi> In a Word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a ſincere Convert to every Thing that's commendable in a fine young Lady; and Two or Three ſuch Matches as her Aunt feigned in her Devotions, are at this Day in her Choice. This is the Hiſtory and Original Cauſe of <hi>Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rella</hi>'s Converſion from Coquettry. The Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Management of this young Lady's Temper, and good Judgment of it, is hardly to be exceeded. I ſcarce remember a greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Forbearance of the uſual peeviſh Way with which the Aged treat the Young, than this, except that of our famous <hi>Noy,</hi> whoſe good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture went ſo far, as to make him put off his Admonitions to his Son, even till after his Death,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0397200201:73"/>
and did not give him his Thoughts of him, till he came to read that memo able Paſſage in his Will: <hi>All the reſt of my Eſtate,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I leave to my Son</hi> Edward <hi>(who is Executor to this my Will) to be ſquandred as he ſhall think fit: I leave it him for that Purpoſe, and hope no better from him.</hi> A generous Diſdain, and Reflection upon how little he deſerved from ſo excellent a Father, reformed the young Man, and made <hi>Edward,</hi> from an errant Rake, become a fine Gentleman.</p>

               <p>MY Brother <hi>Iſaac</hi> having a ſudden Occaſion to go out of Town, ordered me to take upon me the Diſpatch of the next Advices from Home, with Liberty to ſpeak it my own Way;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0397200201:75"/>
not doubting the Allowances which would be given to a Writer of my Sex. You may be ſure, I undertook it with much Satisfaction: And I confeſs, I am not a little pleaſed with the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of running over all the Papers in his Cloſet, which he has left open for my Uſe on this Occaſion. The firſt that I lay my Hands on, is, A Treatiſe concerning <hi>The Empire of Beauty,</hi> and the Effects it has had in all Nations of the World, upon the publick and private Actions of Men; with an Appendix, which he calls, <hi>The Batchelor's Scheme for Governing his Wife.</hi> The firſt Thing he makes this Gentleman propoſe, is, That ſhe ſhall be no Woman; for ſhe is to have an Averſion to Balls, to Opera's, to Viſits: She is to think his Company ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to fill up all the Hours of Life with great Satisfaction: She is never to believe any other Man Wiſe, Learned, or Valiant; or at leaſt but in a ſecond Degree. In the next Place, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſhe ſhall be a Cuckold; but expects, that he himſelf muſt live in perfect Security from that Terror. He dwells a great while on Inſtructions for her diſcreet Behaviour, in caſe of his Falſhood. I have not Patience with theſe unreaſonable Expectations, therefore turn back to the Treatiſe it ſelf. Here, indeed, my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deduces all the Revolutions among Men from the Paſſion of Love; and in his Preface, anſwers that uſual Obſervation againſt us, <hi>That there is no Quarrel without a Woman in it;</hi> with a gallant Aſſertion, <hi>That there is nothing elſe worth Quarrelling for.</hi> My Brother is of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion truly Amorous; all his Thoughts and Actions carry in 'em a Tincture of that obliging Inclination; and this Turn has opened his Eyes to ſee, we are not the inconſiderable C eatures which unlucky Pretenders to our Favour would inſinuate. He obſerves, That no Man begins to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0397200201:76"/>
make any tolerable Figure, till he ſets out with he Hopes of Pleaſing ſome one of us. No ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he takes that in Hand, but he pleaſes every one elſe by the by. It has an immediate Effect upon his Behaviour. There is Colonel <hi>Ranter,</hi> who never ſpoke without an Oath, till he ſaw the Lady <hi>Betty Modiſh;</hi> now never gives his Man an Order, but it is, Pray <hi>Tom,</hi> do it. The Drawers where he drinks, live in perfect Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. He asked <hi>Will</hi> at the <hi>George</hi> t'other Day, How he did? Where he uſed to ſay, <hi>Damn it, Is it ſo?</hi> He now believes <hi>there is ſome Miſtake: He muſt confeſs, he is of another Opinion; but however he won't inſiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every Temper, except downright inſipid, is to be animated and ſoftned by the Influence of Beauty: But of this untractable Sort is a life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs handſome Fellow that viſits us, whom I have dreſſed at this Twelvemonth; but he is as inſenſible of all the Arts I uſe, as if he converſed all that Time with his Nurſe. He outdoes our whole Sex in all the Faults our Enemies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to us; he has brought Lazineſs into an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and makes his Indolence his Philoſophy: Inſomuch, that no long r ago than Yeſterday in the Evening he gave me this Account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: <hi>I am, Madam, perfectly unmoved at all that paſſes among Men, and ſeldom gives my ſelf the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue of going among 'em; but when I do, I always appear the ſame Thing to thoſe whom I converſe with. My Hours of Exiſtence, or being awake, are from Eleven in the Morning to Eleven at Night; half of which I live to my ſelf, in picking my Teeth, waſhing my Hands, paring my Nails, and looking in the Glaſs. The Inſignificancy of my Manners to the reſt of the World, makes the Laughers call me a</hi> Quid Nunc, <hi>a Phraſe which I neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, or ſhall ever enquire what they mean by it. The laſt of me each Night is at St.</hi> James<hi>'s Coffee-houſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0397200201:77"/>
                  <hi>where I converſe, yet never fall into a Diſpute on any Occaſion, but leave the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I have Paſſive of all that goes through it, without entring into the Buſineſs of Life. And thus, Madam, have I arrived by Lazineſs, to what others pretended to by Philoſophy, a perfect Neglect of the World.</hi> Sure, if our Sex had the Liberty of frequenting Publick Houſes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, we ſhould put theſe Rivals of our Faults and Follies out of Countenance. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we ſhall ſoon have the Pleaſure of being acquainted with 'em one Way or other; for my Brother <hi>Iſaac</hi> deſigns, for the Uſe of our Sex, to give the exact Characters of all the Chief Politicians who frequent any of the Coffee-houſes from St. <hi>James</hi>'s to the <hi>Change;</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to begin with that Cluſter of Wiſe Heads, as they are found ſitting every Evening from the Left-ſide of the Fire, at the <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to the Door. This will be of great Service for us, and I have Authority to promiſe an exact Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of their Deliberations; the Publication of which I am to be allowed for Pin-Money. In the mean Time, I caſt my Eye upon a new Book, which gave me a more pleaſing Entertainment, being a ſixth Part of Miſcellany Poems, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd by <hi>Jacob Tonſon;</hi> which, I find, by my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Notes upon it, no Way inferior to the other Volumes. There are, it ſeems, in this, a Collection of the beſt Paſtorals that have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto appeared in <hi>England;</hi> but among them, none ſuperior to that Dialogue between <hi>Sylvia</hi> and <hi>Dorinda,</hi> written by one of my own Sex; where all our little Weakneſſes are laid open in a Manner more juſt, and with truer Raillery, than ever Man yet hit upon.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Only this I now diſcern,</l>

But to reaſſume my firſt Deſign, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a greater Inſtance of the Command of Females, than in the prevailing Charms of the Heroine in the Play which was acted this Night, call'd, <hi>All for Love;</hi> or, <hi>The World well loſt.</hi> The enamoured <hi>Antony</hi> reſigns Glory and Power to the Force of the attractive <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whoſe Charms were the Defence of her Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, againſt a People otherwiſe invincible.

If we have their Favour, we give our ſelves very little Anxiety for the reſt of our Readers.

the Army of the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> paſſed alſo through that Place. Thoſe Troops were to be followed by 6 Battalions more.</p>
               <p>Letters from <hi>Naples</hi> of the 16th of <hi>April</hi> ſay, That the Marquis <hi>de Prie</hi>'s Son was arrived there, with Inſtructions from his Father, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify to the Viceroy the Neceſſity his Imperial Majeſty was under, of deſiring an Aid from that Kingdom, for carrying on the extraordinary Expences of the War. On the 14th of the ſame Month, they made a Review of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops in that Garriſon, and afterwards of the Marines; one Part of whom will embark with thoſe deſigned for <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and the reſt are to be ſent on Board the Gallies appointed to convoy Proviſions to that Place.</p>
               <p>We hear from <hi>Rome.</hi> by Letters dated the 20th of <hi>April,</hi> That the Count <hi>de Mellos,</hi> Envoy from the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> had made his Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Entry into that City with much State and Magnificence. The Pope has lately held Two other Conſiſtories, wherein he made a Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Two Cardinals; but the Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of King <hi>Charles</hi> is ſtill deferred.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The ſame Advices ſay, Bread was ſold at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> for 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Pound; and that there was not half enough, even at that Rate, to ſupply the Neceſſities of the People, which reduced them to the utmoſt Deſpair; that 300 Men had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up Arms, and having plunder'd the Market of the Suburb of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> preſſed down by their Multitude the King's Guards who oppoſed them. Two of thoſe Mutineers were afterward ſeiz'd, and condemn'd to Death; but Four others went to the Magiſtrate who pronounc'd that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and told him.

loſt among the enraged People, to keep up a Show of Authority; the Captain of the Guards, who ſaw all their Inſolence, pretended, That he had repreſented to the King their deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition, and had obtained their Pardon. It is further reported, That the Dauphin, and Dutcheſs of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> as they went to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera, were ſurrounded by Crowds of People, who upbraided them with their Neglect of the general Calamity, in going to Diverſions, when the whole People were ready to periſh for want of Bread. Edicts are daily publiſhed to ſuppreſs theſe Riots; and Papers, with Menaces againſt the Government, as publickly thrown about. Among others, theſe Words were dropped in a Court of Juſtice, France <hi>wants a</hi> Ravilliac <hi>or a</hi> Jeſuit <hi>to deliver her.</hi> Beſides this univerſal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, there is a contagious Sickneſs, which, it is feared, will end in a Peſtilence.

               <p>A Kinſman has ſent me a Letter, wherein he informs me, He had lately reſolved to write an Heroick Poem; but by Buſineſs has been interrupted, and has only made one Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, which he ſhould be afflicted to have wholly loſt, and begs of me to apply it to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, being very deſirous to ſee it well placed in the World. I am ſo willing to help the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, that I have taken it in: But though his greater Genius might very well diſtinguiſh his Verſes from mine, I have marked where his begin. His Lines are a Deſcription of the Sun in Eclipſe, which I know nothing more like than a brave Man in Sorrow, who bears it as he ſhould, without imploring the Pity of his Friends, or being dejected with the Contempt of his Enemies: As in the Caſe of <hi>Cato:</hi>

With Inborn Strength alone oppos'd Mankind,</l>
                  <l>With Heav'n in View, to all below it blind:</l>
                  <l>Regardleſs of his Friend's Applauſe, or Moan,</l>
                  <l>Alone Triumphant, ſince he falls alone.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>' Thus when the Ruler of the Genial Day,</l>
                  <l>' Behind ſome dark'ning Planet forms his Way,</l>
                  <l>' Deſponding Mortals, with officious Care,</l>
                  <l>' The Concave Drum, and Magick Braſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare;</l>
                  <l>' Implore him to ſuſtain th'important Fight,</l>
                  <l>' And ſave depending Worlds from endleſs Night.</l>
                  <l>' Fondly they hope their Labour may avail,</l>
                  <l>' To eaſe his Conflict, and aſſiſt his Toil.</l>
                  <l>' Whilſt he in Beams of Native Splendor bright</l>
                  <l>' (Tho' dark his Orb appear to Humane Sight)</l>
                  <l>' Shines to the Gods with more diffuſive Light.</l>
                  <l>' To diſtant Stars with equal Glory burns,</l>
                  <l>' Inflames their Lamps, and feeds their Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Urns.</l>
                  <l>' Sure to retain his known ſuperior Tract,</l>
                  <l>' And proves the more illuſtrious by Defect.</l>
               </q>
               <p>This is a very lively Image; but I muſt take the Liberty to ſay, My Kinſman drives the Sun a little like <hi>Phaeton:</hi> He has all the Warmth of <hi>Phaebus,</hi> but won't ſtay for his Direction of it. <hi>Avail</hi> and <hi>Toil, Defect</hi> and <hi>Tract,</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do for Rhimes. But however, he has the true Spirit in him; for which Reaſon I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to entertain any Thing he pleas'd to ſend me. The Subject which he writes upon, naturally raiſes great Reflections in the Soul, and puts us in Mind of the mixed Condition which we Mortals are to ſupport; which, as it varies to Good or Bad, adorns or defaces our Actions to the Beholders: All which Glory and Shame muſt end in what we ſo much repine at, Death. But Doctrines on
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0397200201:84"/>
this Occaſion, any other than that of living well, are the moſt inſignificant and moſt empty of all the Labours of Men. None but a Tragedian can die by Rule, and wait till he diſcovers a Plot, or ſays a fine Thing upon his <hi>Exit.</hi> In real Life, this is a Chimaera; and by Noble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, it will be done decently, without the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation of it. We ſee Men of all Conditions and Characters go through it with equal Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: And if we conſider the Speeches of the mighty Philoſophers, Heroes, Law-givers, and Great Captains, they can produce no more in a diſcerning Spirit, than Rules to make a Man a Fop on his Death-Bed. Commend me to that natural Greatneſs of Soul, expreſſed by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and conſequently reſolute Country Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, who ſaid in the Pains of the Cholick, <hi>If I once get this Breath out of my Body, you ſhall hang me before you put it in again.</hi> Honeſt <hi>Ned.</hi> and ſo he died.</p>
               <p>But it is to be ſuppoſed, from this Place you may expect an Account of ſuch a Thing as a New Play is not to be omitted. That acted this Night is the neweſt that ever was writ. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is my ingenious Friend Mr. <hi>Thomas D—y.</hi> This Drama is called, <hi>The Modern Prophets,</hi> and is a moſt unanſwerable Satyr againſt the late Spirit of Enthuſiaſm. The Writer had by long Experience obſerved, That in Company, very grave Diſcourſes have been followed by Baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry; and therefore has turned the Humour that Way with great Succeſs, and taken from his Audience all Manner of Superſtition, by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations of pretty Mrs. <hi>Bignall,</hi> whom he has, with great Subtilty, made a Lay-Siſter, as well as a Propheteſs; by which Means, ſhe carries on the Affairs of both Worlds with great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. My Friend deſigns to go on with another Work againſt Winter, which he intends to call,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0397200201:85"/>
                  <hi>The Modern Poets;</hi> a People no leſs miſtaken in their Opinions of being inſpired, than the other. In order to this, he has by him ſeveral Songs, beſides many Ambiguities, which cannot be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken for any Thing but what he means them. Mr. <hi>D—y</hi> generally writes State-Plays, and is wonderfully uſeful to the World in ſuch Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations. This Method is the ſame that was us'd by the Old <hi>Athenians,</hi> to laugh out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or promote Opinions among the People. My Friend has therefore, againſt this Play is acted for his own Benefit, made Two Dances, which may be alſo of an univerſal Benefit. In the Firſt, he has repreſented Abſolute Power in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Tall Man with an Hat and Feather, who gives his Firſt Miniſter, that ſtands juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, an huge Kick; the Miniſter gives the Kick to the next before; and ſo to the End of the Stage. In the Moral and Practical Jeſt, you are made to underſtand, That there is, in an Abſolute Government, no Gratification, but giving the Kick you receive from one above you, to one below you. This is performed to a grave and melancholy Air; but on a ſudden the Tune moves quicker, and the whole Company fall into a Circle, and take Hands; then at a certain ſharp Note, they move round, and kick as kick can. This latter Performance he makes to be the Repreſentation of a Free State; where, if you all mind your Steps, you may go round and round very jollily, with a Motion pleaſant to your ſelves and thoſe you dance with: Nay, if you put your ſelves out, at the worſt you only kick and are kicked, like Friends and Equals.</p>

                     <p>SInce you have been pleaſed to make your ſelf ſo famous of late, by your ingenious Writings, and ſome Time ago by your learned Predictions: Since <hi>Partridge</hi> of Immortal Memory is dead and gone, who, Poetical as he was, could not underſtand his own Poetry; and Philomathical as he was, could not read his own Deſtiny: Since the <hi>Pope,</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> and great Part of his Court, are either literally or metaphorically defunct: Since, I ſay, theſe Things (not foretold by any one but your ſelf) have come to paſs after ſo ſurprizing a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; 'tis with no ſmall Concern I ſee the Original of the <hi>Staffian</hi> Race ſo little known in the World as it is at this Time; for which Reaſon, as you have employed your Studies in Aſtronomy, and the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Sciences; ſo I, my Mother being a <hi>Welch</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, dedicated mine to Genealogy, particularly that of our own Family, which, for its Antiquity and Number, may challenge any in <hi>Great Britain.</hi> The <hi>Staffs</hi> are originally of <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> which took its Name from them: The Firſt that I find of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0397200201:87"/>
                        <hi>Staffs</hi> was one <hi>Jacobſtaff,</hi> a famous and renowned Aſtronomer, who by <hi>Dorothy</hi> his Wife, had Iſſue Seven Sons, <hi>viz. Bickerſtaff. Longſtaff, Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff, Quarterſtaff, Whiteſtaff, Falſtaff,</hi> and <hi>Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff.</hi> He alſo had a Younger Brother who was twice married, and had Five Sons; <hi>viz. Diſtaff, Pikeſtaff, Mopſtaff, Broomſtaff,</hi> and <hi>Ragged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff.</hi> As for the Branch from whence you ſpring, I ſhall ſay very little of it, only that 'tis the Chief of the <hi>Staffs,</hi> and called <hi>Bickerſtaff, quaſi Bigger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff;</hi> as much as to ſay, the <hi>Great Staff,</hi> or <hi>Staff</hi> of <hi>Staffs;</hi> and that it has applied it ſelf to Aſtronomy with great Succeſs, after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our aforeſaid Forefather. The Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants from <hi>Longſtaff,</hi> the ſecond Son, were a rakiſh diſorderly Sort of People, and rambled from one Place to another, till in <hi>Harry II.</hi>'s Time they ſettled in <hi>Kent,</hi> and were called <hi>Long-Tails,</hi> from the <hi>Long-Tails</hi> which were ſent them as a Puniſhment for the Murder of <hi>Thomas a Becket,</hi> as the Legends ſay. They have been always ſeeked after by the Ladies; but whether it be to ſhow their Averſion to Popery, or their Love to Miracles, I can't ſay. The <hi>Wagſtaffs</hi> are a merry thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Sort of People, who have always been opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated of their own Wit; they have turned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſtly to Poetry. This is the moſt numerous Branch of our Family, and the pooreſt. The <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſtaffs</hi> are moſt of them Prize-fighters, or Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtealers: There have been ſo many of them hanged lately, that there are very few of that Branch of our Family left. The <hi>Whiteſtaffs</hi> are all Courtiers, and have had very conſiderable Places. There have been ſome of them of that Strength and Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity. That Five hundred of the ableſt Men in the Kingdom have often tugged in vain to pull a Staff out of their Hands. The <hi>Falſtaffs</hi> are ſtrangely given to Whoring and Drinking: There are Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them in and about <hi>London.</hi> And one Thing is very remarkable of this Branch, and that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0397200201:88"/>
is, There are juſt as many Women as Men in it. There was a wicked Stick of Wood of this Name in <hi>Harry IV.</hi>'s Time, one Sir <hi>John Falſtaff.</hi> As for <hi>Tipſtaff,</hi> the youngeſt Son, he was an honeſt Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; but his Sons, and his Sons Sons, have all of them been the verieſt Rogues living: 'Tis this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Branch has ſtock'd the Nation with that Swarm of Lawyers, Attorneys, Serjeants, and Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs, with which the Nation is over-run. <hi>Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff,</hi> being a Seventh Son, uſed to cure the <hi>King's-Evil;</hi> but his raſcally Deſcendants are ſo far from having that healing Quality, that by a Touch upon the Shoulder, they give a Man ſuch an ill Habit of Body, that he can never come abroad af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. This is all I know of the Line of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobſtaff:</hi> His younger Brother <hi>Iſaacſtaff,</hi> as I told you before, had Five Sons, and was married twice; his Firſt Wife was a <hi>Staff,</hi> (for they did not ſtand upon falſe Heraldry in thoſe Days) by whom he had one Son, who in Proceſs of Time being a School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and well read in the <hi>Greek,</hi> called himſelf <hi>Diſtaff</hi> or <hi>Twiceſtaff.</hi> He was not very rich, ſo he put his Children out to Trades; and the <hi>Diſtaffs</hi> have ever ſince been employed in the Woollen and Linen Manufactures, except my ſelf, who am a Genealogiſt. <hi>Pikeſtaff,</hi> the eldeſt Son by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Venter, was a Man of Buſineſs, a downright plodding Fellow, and withal ſo plain, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Proverb. Moſt of this Family are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Army. <hi>Raggedſtaff</hi> was an unlucky Boy, and uſed to tear his Clothes a getting Birds Neſts, and was always playing with a tame Bear his Father kept. <hi>Mopſtaff</hi> fell in love with one of his Father's Maids, and uſed to help her to clean the Houſe. <hi>Broomſtaff</hi> was a Chimney-Sweeper. The <hi>Mopſtaffs</hi> and <hi>Broomſtaffs</hi> are naturally as civil People as ever went out of Doors; but alas! If they once get into ill Hands, they knock down all before them. <hi>Pilgrimſtaff</hi> run away from his

                     <p>You are to underſtand, Sir, That Simplicity of Behaviour, which is the Perfection of good Breeding and good Senſe, is utterly loſt in the World; and in the Room of it, there are ſtarted a Thouſand little Inventions, which Men, barren of better Things, take up in the Place of it. Thus for every Character in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation that uſed to pleaſe, there is an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor put upon you. Him whom we allow'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly for a certain pleaſant Subtilty, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Way of giving you an unexpected Hit, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Droll,</hi> is now mimick'd by a <hi>Biter,</hi> who is a dull Fellow, that tells you a Lye with a grave Face, and laughs at you for knowing him no better than to believe him. Inſtead of that Sort of Companion, who could rally you, and keep his Countenance, till he made you fall
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0397200201:93"/>
into ſome little Inconſiſtency of Behaviour, at which you your ſelf could laugh with him, you have the Sneerer, who will keep you Company from Morning to Night, to gather your Follies of the Day, (which perhaps you commit out of Confidence in him) and expoſe you in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all the Scorners in Town. For your Man of Senſe and free Spirit, whoſe Set of Thoughts were built upon Learning, Reaſon, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, you have now an impudent Creature made up of Vice only, who ſupports his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by his Courage, and Want of Learning by Contempt of it.</p>

                     <p>Dear Sir, hold: What you have told me already of this Change in Converſation, is too miſerable to be heard with any Delight; but, methinks, as theſe new Creatures appear in the World, it might give an excellent Field to Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the Stage, to divert us with the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of them there.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
                     <p>No, No: As you ſay, there might be ſome Hopes of Redreſs of theſe Grievances, if there were proper Care taken of the Theatre; but the Hiſtory of that is yet more lamentable, than that of the Decay of Converſation I gave you.</p>

                     <p>It is now ſome Years, ſince ſeveral Revolutions in the Gay World had made the Empire of the Stage ſubject to very fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, which were too dangerous to be cured by the Skill of little King <hi>Oberon,</hi> who then ſate in the Throne of it. The Lazineſs of this Prince threw him upon the Choice of a Perſon who was fit to ſpend his Life in Contentions, an able and profound Attorney, to whom he mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his whole Empire. This <hi>Divite</hi> is the moſt skilful of all Politicians: He has a perfect
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0397200201:94"/>
Art in being unintelligible in Diſcourſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comeatable in Buſineſs. But he having no Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in this polite Way, brought in upon us, to get in his Money, Ladder-dancers, Rope-dancers, Jugglers, and Mountebanks, to ſtrut in the Place of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Heroes, and <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Humouriſts. When the Seat of Wit was thus mortgaged, without Equity of Redemption, an Architect aroſe, who has built the Muſe a new Palace, but ſecured her no Retinue; ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Action there, we have been put off by Song and Dance. This latter Help of Sound has alſo began to fail for want of Voices; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Palace has ſince been put into the Hands of a Surgeon, who cuts any Foreign Fellow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Eunuch, and paſſes him upon us for a Singer of <hi>Italy.</hi>

                     <p>Things are come to this Paſs; and yet the World will not underſtand, that the Theatre has much the ſame Effect on the Manners of the Age, as the Bank on the Credit of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wit and Spirit, Humour and good Senſe, can never be revived, but under the Government of thoſe who are Judges of ſuch Talents, who know, that whatever is put up in their Stead, is but a ſhort and trifling Expedient, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Appearance of them for a Seaſon. It is poſſible, a Peace will give Leiſure to put theſe Matters under new Regulations; but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent all the Aſſiſtance we can ſee towards our Recovery, is as far from giving us Help, as a Poultice is from performing what can be done only by the Grand Elixir.</p>

The following Poem comes from <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhagen,</hi> and is as fine a Winter-piece, as we have ever had from any of the Schools of the moſt learned Painters. Such Images as theſe give us a new Pleaſure in our Sight, and fix up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Minds Traces of Reflection, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company us whenever the like Objects occur. In ſhort, excellent Poetry and Deſcription dwell upon us ſo agreeably, that all the Readers of them are made to think, if not write, like Men of Wit.

                  <l>When Empire in its Childhood firſt appears,</l>
                  <l>A watchful Fate e'erſees its tender Years:</l>

                  <l>And elbows all the Kingdoms round about.</l>
                  <l>The Place thus made for its firſt breathing free,</l>
                  <l>It moves again for Eaſe and Luxury:</l>
                  <l>Till ſwelling by Degrees it has poſſeſt</l>
                  <l>The greater Space, and now crowds up the reſt.</l>
                  <l>When from behind there ſtarts ſome petty State,</l>
                  <l>And puſhes on its now unweildy Fate.</l>
                  <l>Then down the Precipice of Time it goes,</l>

               <p>MUch Hurry and Buſineſs had to Day per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd me into a Mood too thoughtful for going into Company; for which Reaſon, in ſtead of the Tavern, I went into <hi>Lincoln's Inn-Walks;</hi> and having taken a Round or Two, I ſate down, according to the allowed Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of theſe Places, on a Bench; at the other End of which ſate a venerable Gentleman, who ſpeaking with a very affable Air, <hi>Mr.</hi> Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff, ſaid he, <hi>I take it for a very great Piece of good Fortune that you have found me out. Sir,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>I had never, that I know of, the Honour of ſeeing you before. That,</hi> replied he, <hi>is what I have often lamented; but I aſſure you, I have for many Years done you good Offices, without being obſerved by you; or elſe, when you had any little Glimpſe of my being concerned in an Affair, you have fled from me, and ſhunned me like an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but however, the Part I am to act in the World is ſuch, that I am to go on in doing Good, though I meet with never ſo many Repulſes, even from thoſe I oblige.</hi> This, thought I, ſhows a great good Nature, but little Judgment in the Perſons upon whom he confers his Favours. He immediately took Notice to me, That he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by my Countenance I thought him indiſcreet in his Beneficence, and proceeded to tell me his Quality in the following Manner: <hi>I know thee,</hi> Iſaac, <hi>to be ſo well vers'd in the Occult Sciences, that I need not much Preface, or make long Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to gain you Faith that there are Airy Beings, who are employed in the Care and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi>

I have of late been upon ſuch hard Duty, and know you have ſo much Work for me, that I think fit to appear to you Face to Face, to deſire you would give me as little Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for Vigilance as you can. Sir,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>it will be a great Inſtruction to me in my Behaviour, if you pleaſe to give me ſome Account of your late Employments, and what Hardſhips or Satisfactions you have had in them, that I may govern my ſelf accordingly.</hi> He anſwered: To give you an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Drudgery we go through, I will entertain you only with my Three laſt Stations: I was on the Firſt of <hi>April</hi> laſt put to mortifie a great Beauty, with whom I was a Week; from her I went to a common Swearer, and have been laſt with a Gameſter. When I firſt came to my Lady, I found my great Work was to guard well her Eyes and Ears, but her Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers were ſo numerous, and the Houſe, after the modern Way, ſo full of Looking-glaſſes, that I ſeldom had her ſafe but in her Sleep. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we went Abroad, we were ſurrounded by an Army of Enemies: When a well-made Man appeared, he was ſure to have a Side-glance of Obſervation: If a diſagreeable Fellow, he had a full Face, out of meer Inclination to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. But at the Cloſe of the Evening, on the Sixth of the laſt Month, my Ward was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a Couch, reading <hi>Ovid's Epiſtles;</hi> and as ſhe came to this Line of <hi>Helen</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi>

enter'd <hi>Philander,</hi> who is the moſt skilful of all Men in an Addreſs to Women. He is arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the Perfection of that Art which gains them, which is, <hi>To talk like a very miſerable Man, but look like a very happy One.</hi> I ſaw <hi>Dictinna</hi> bluſh at his Entrance, which gave me the Alarm; but he immediately ſaid ſomething ſo agreeable on her being at Study, and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of finding a Lady employed in ſo grave a Manner, that he on a ſudden became very fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly a Man of no Conſequence; and in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant laid all her Suſpicions of his Skill aſleep, as he almoſt had done mine, till I obſerved him very dangerouſly turn his Diſcourſe upon the Elegance of her Dreſs, and her Judgment in the Choice of that very pretty Mourning. Having had Women before under my Care, I trembled at the Apprehenſion of a Man of Senſe who could talk upon Trifles, and reſolved to ſtick to my Poſt with all the Circumſpection imaginable. In ſhort, I prepoſſeſſed her againſt all he could ſay to the Advantage of her Dreſs and Perſon; but he turned again the Diſcourſe, where I found I had no Power o ver her, on the abuſing her Friends and Acquaintance. He allowed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, That <hi>Flora</hi> had a little Beauty, and a great deal of Wit; but then ſhe was ſo ungainly in her Behaviour, and ſuch a laughing <hi>Hoyden—Paſtorella</hi> had with him the Allowance of being Blameleſs: But what was that towards being Praiſe-worthy? To be only Innocent, is not to be Virtuous. He afterwards ſpoke ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mrs. <hi>Dipple</hi>'s Forehead, Mrs. <hi>Prim</hi>'s Mouth, Mrs. <hi>Dentifrice</hi>'s Teeth, and Mrs. <hi>Fidget</hi>'s Cheeks, that ſhe grew downright in Love with him: For it is always to be underſtood, That a Lady takes all you detract from the reſt of her Sex to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0397200201:103"/>
be a Gift to her. In a Word, Things went ſo far, that I was diſmiſſed, and ſhe will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Evening Nine Months, from the Sixth of <hi>April,</hi> by a very remarkable Token. The next, as I ſaid, I went to was a common Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: Never was a Creature ſo puzzled as my ſelf when I came firſt to view his Brain; half of it was worn out, and filled up with meer Exple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, that had nothing to do with any other Parts of the Texture; therefore, when he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for his Clothes in a Morning, he would cry, <hi>John?—John</hi> does not anſwer. <hi>What a Plague! No Body there? What the Devil, and rot me!</hi> John, <hi>for a laxy Dog as you are.</hi> I knew no Way to cure him, but by writing down all he ſaid one Morning as he was dreſſing, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it before him on the Toilet when he came to pick his Teeth. The laſt Recital I gave him of what he ſaid for half an Hour before, was, <hi>What, a Pox rot me! Where is the Waſhball? Call the Chairmen: Damn 'em, I warrant they are at the Alehouſe already! Zounds, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found 'em.</hi> When he came to the Glaſs, he takes up my Note—<hi>Ha! This Fellow is worſe than me: What, Does he ſwear with Pen and Ink?</hi> But reading on, he found them to be his own Words. The Stratagem had ſo good an Effect upon him, that he grew immediately a new Man, and is learning to ſpeak without an Oath, which makes him extremely ſhort in his Phraſes; for, as I obſerved before, a Common Swearer has a Brain without any Idea on the Swearing Side; therefore my Ward has yet mighty little to ſay, and is forced to ſubſtitute ſome other Vehicle of Nonſence to ſupply the Defect of his uſual Expletives. When I left him, he made Uſe of, <hi>Odsbodikins! Oh me!</hi> and <hi>Never ſtir alive!</hi> and ſo forth; which gave me the Hopes of his Recovery. So I went to the next I told you of,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0397200201:104"/>
the Gameſter. When we firſt take our Place about a Man, the Receptacles of the <hi>Pericra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> are immediately ſearched. In his, I found no one ordinary Trace of Thinking; but ſtrong Paſſion, violent Deſires, and a continued Series of different Changes, had torn it to Pieces. There appeared no middle Condition; the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of a Prince, or the Miſery of a Beggar, were his alternate States. I was with him no longer than one Day, which was Yeſterday. In the Morning at Twelve, we were worth Four Thouſand Pounds; at Three, we were arrived at Six Thouſand; half an Hour after, we were reduced to One Thouſand; at Four of the Clock we were down to Two Hundred; at Five, to Fifty; at Six, to Five; at Seven, to One Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea; the next Bet, to Nothing. This Morning, he borrowed Half a Crown of the Maid who cleans his Shoes; and is now gaming in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colns-Inn-Fields</hi> among the Boys for Farthings and Oranges, till he has made up Three Pieces, and then he returns to <hi>White</hi>'s into the beſt Company in Town. This ended our firſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and it is hoped, you will forgive me that I have picked ſo little out of my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at our firſt Interview. In the next, 'tis poſſible he may tell me more pleaſing Incidents; for though he is a Familiar, he is not an Evil Spirit.</p>

               <p>We hear from the <hi>Hague</hi> of the 14th Inſtant, <hi>N, S.</hi> That Monſieur <hi>de Torcy</hi> hath had frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences with the Grand Penſioner, and the other Miniſters who were heretofore commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned to treat with Monſieur <hi>Rouille.</hi> The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminaries of a Peace are almoſt ſettled, and the Proceedings wait only for the Arrival of the Duke of <hi>Marlborough;</hi> after whoſe Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Articles propoſed, it is not doubted

but the Methods of the Treaty will be publickly known. In the mean Time, the States have declared an Abhorrence of making any Step in this great Affair, but in Concert with the Court of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and other Princes of the Alliance. The Poſture of Affairs in <hi>Franes</hi> does neceſſarily oblige that Nation to be very much in Earneſt in their Offers; and Monſieur <hi>de Torcy</hi> hath profeſſed to the Grand Penſioner, That he will avoid all Occaſions of giving him the leaſt Jealouſie of his uſing any Addreſs in private Converſations for accompliſhing the Ends of his Embaſſy. It is ſaid, That as ſoon as the Preliminaries are adjuſted, that Miniſter is to return to the <hi>French</hi> Court. The States of <hi>Holland</hi> have reſolved to make it an Inſtruction to all their Men of War and Privateers, to bring into their Ports whatever Neutral Ships they ſhall meet with laden with Corn, and bound for <hi>France;</hi> and to avoid all Cauſe of Complaint from the Potentates to whom theſe Ships ſhall belong, their full Demand for their Freight ſhall be paid them there.

               <p>HAD it not been that my Familiar had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me, as I told you in my laſt, in Perſon, I had certainly been unable to have found even Words, without Meaning, to keep up my Intelligence with the Town: But he has checked me ſeverely for my Deſpondence, and ordered me to go on in my Deſign of obſerving upon Things, and forbearing Perſons; for, ſaid he, the Age you live in is ſuch, that a good Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of any Vice or Virtue will infallibly be

miſrepreſented; and though none will take the kind Deſcriptions you make ſo much to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to wiſh well to the Author, yet all will reſent the ill Characters you produce, out of Fear of their own Turn in the Licence you muſt be obliged to take, if you point at particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons. I took his Admonition kindly, and immediately promiſed him to beg Pardon of the Author of the <hi>Advice to the Poets,</hi> for my Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery upon his Work; tho' I aimed at no more, in that Examination, but to convince him, and all Men of Genius, of the Folly of laying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out on ſuch Plans as are below their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. I hope too it was done without Ill-Breeding, and nothing ſpoken below what a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilian (as it is allowed I am) may utter to a Phyſician. After this Preface, all the World may be ſafe from my Writings; for if I can find nothing to commend, I am ſilent, and will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the Subject: For, though I am a Reformer, I ſcorn to be an Inquiſitor.</p>
               <p>It would become all Men as well as me, to lay before 'em the noble Character of <hi>Verus</hi> the Magiſtrate, who always ſate in Triumph over, and Contempt of Vice; He never ſearched after it, or ſpared it when it came before him: At the ſame Time, He could ſee thro' the Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and Diſguiſe of thoſe, who have no Pretence to Virtue themſelves, but by their Severity to the Vicious. This ſame <hi>Verus</hi> was, in Times long paſt, Chief Juſtice (as we call it amongſt us) in <hi>Faelicia.</hi> He was a Man of profound Knowledge of the Laws of his Country, and as juſt an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of 'em in his own Perſon. He conſidered Juſtice as a Cardinal Virtue, not as a Trade for Maintenance. Wherever he was Judge, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forgot that he was alſo Council. The Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal before him was always ſure he ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Country, and, in a Sort, a Parent of it.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0397200201:108"/>
The Priſoner knew, that tho' his Spirit was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with Guilt, and incapable of Language to defend it ſelf, all would be gathered from him which could conduce to his Safety; and that his Judge would wreſt no Law to deſtroy him, nor conceal any that could ſave him. In his Time, there were a Neſt of Pretenders to Juſtice, who happen'd to be employed to put Things in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for being examined before him at his uſual Seſſions: Theſe Animals were to <hi>Verus,</hi> as Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys are to Men, ſo like, that you can hardly diſown them; but ſo baſe, that you are aſhamed of their Fraternity. It grew a Phraſe, <hi>Who would do Juſtice on the Juſtices?</hi> That certainly would <hi>Verus.</hi> I have ſeen an old Trial where he ſate Judge on Two of 'em; one was called <hi>Trick-Track,</hi> the other <hi>Tearſhift;</hi> one was a learned Judge of Sharpers, the other the quickeſt of all Men at finding out a Wench. <hi>Trick-Track</hi> never ſpared a Pick-pocket, but was a Companion to Cheats: <hi>Tearſhift</hi> would make Compliments to Wenches of Quality, but certainly commit poor ones. If a poor Rogue wanted a Lodging, <hi>Trick-Track</hi> ſent him to Gaol for a Thief: If a poor Whore went only with one thin Petticoat, <hi>Tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhift</hi> would impriſon her for being looſe in her Dreſs. Theſe Patriots infeſted the Days of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> while they alternately committed and relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed each others Priſoners. But <hi>Verus</hi> regarded them as Criminals, and always look'd upon Men as they ſtood in the Eye of Juſtice, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting whether they ſate on the Bench, or ſtood at the Bar.</p>

               <p>Yeſterday we were entertained with the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy of <hi>The Earl of Eſſex,</hi> in which there is not one good Line, and yet a Play which was never ſeen without drawing Tears from ſome Part of the Audience: A remarkable Inſtance, that the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0397200201:109"/>
Soul is not to be moved by Words, but Things for the Incidents in this <hi>Drama</hi> are laid together ſo happily, that the Spectator makes the Play for himſelf, by the Force which the Circumſtance has upon his Imagination. Thus, in ſpight of the moſt dry Diſcourſes, and Expreſſions almoſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous with reſpect to Propriety, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for one unprejudic'd to ſee it untouch'd with Pity. I muſt confeſs this Effect is not wrought on ſuch as examine why they are pleaſed; but it never fails to appear on thoſe who are not too learned in Nature, to be moved by her firſt Suggeſtions. It is certain, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Behaviour of Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> has no ſmall Share in conducing to the Popularity of the Play; and when an handſome Fellow is going to a more courſe <hi>Exit</hi> than Beheading, his Shape and Countenance makes every tender one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve him with all her Heart, without waiting till ſhe hears his dying Words.</p>
               <p>This Evening <hi>The Alchymiſt</hi> was played. This Comedy is an Example of <hi>Ben</hi>'s extenſive Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and Penerration into the Paſſions and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Mankind. The Scene in the Fourth Act, where all the cheated People oppoſe the Man that would open their Eyes, has ſomething in it ſo inimitably excellent, that it is certainly as great a Maſter-piece as has ever appeared by any Hand.

Deceit in the Purſuit of what we wiſh for. A Gentleman here this Evening was giving me an Account of a dumb Fortune-Teller, who out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does Mr. <hi>Partridge,</hi> my ſelf, or the Unborn-Doctor, for Predictions. All his Viſitants come to him full of Expectations, and pay his own Rate for the Interpretations they put upon his Shrugs and Nods. There is a fine rich City-Widow ſtole thither the other Day, (though it is not Six Weeks ſince her Husband's Departure from her Company to reſt) and, with her truſty Maid, demanded of him, Whether ſhe ſhould marry again, by holding up Two Fingers, like Horns on her Forehead. The Wizard held up both her Hands forked. The Relict deſired to know, Whether he meant by his holding up both Hands, to repreſent that ſhe had one Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band before, and that ſhe ſhould have another? Or that he intimated, ſhe ſhould have Two more? The Cunning Man look'd a little ſour; upon which <hi>Betty</hi> jogged her Miſtreſs, who gave t'other Guinea; and he made her underſtand, She ſhould poſitively have Two more; but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his Head, and hinted, that they ſhould not live long with her. The Widow ſighed, and gave him t'other half Guinea. After this Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, all that ſhe had next to do, was to make Sallies to our End of the Town, and find out who it is her Fate to have. There are Two who frequent this Place, whom ſhe takes for Men of Vogue, and of whom her Imagination has given her the Choice. They are both the Appearances of fine Gentlemen, to ſuch as do not know when they ſee Perſons of that Turn; and indeed, they are induſtrious enough to come at that Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, to deſerve the Reputation of being ſuch. But this Town will not allow us to be the Thing we ſeem to aim at, and are too diſcerning to be fobb'd off with Pretences. One of theſe pretty
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0397200201:111"/>
Fellows fails by his laborious Exactneſs; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by his as much ſtudied Negligence. <hi>Frank Careleſs,</hi> as ſoon as his Valet has helped on and adjuſted his Clothes, goes to his Glaſs, ſets his Wig awry, tumbles his Cravat; and in ſhort, undreſſes himſelf to go into Company. <hi>Will Nice</hi> is ſo little ſatisfied with his Dreſs, that all the Time he is at a Viſit, he is ſtill mending it, and is for that Reaſon the more inſufferable; for he who ſtudies Careleſneſs, has, at leaſt, his Work the ſooner done of the Two. The Widow is diſtracted whom to take for her firſt Man; for <hi>Nice</hi> is every Way ſo careful, that ſhe fears his Length of Days; and <hi>Frank</hi> is ſo looſe, that ſhe has Apprehenſions for her own Health with him. I am puzzled how to give a juſt Idea of them; but in a Word, <hi>Careleſs</hi> is a Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, and <hi>Nice</hi> a Fop: Both, you'll ſay, very hopeful Candidates for a gay Woman juſt ſet at Liberty. But there is a Whiſper, her Maid will give her to <hi>Tom Terrour</hi> the Gameſter. This Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low has undone ſo many Women, that he'll cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſucceed if he is introduced; for nothing ſo much prevails with the vain Part of that Sex, as the Glory of deceiving them who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived others.</p>

               <p>I Have taken a Reſolution hereafter, on any Want of Intelligence, to carry my Familiar abroad with me, who has promiſed to give me very proper and juſt Notices of Perſons and Things, to make up the Hiſtory of the paſſing Day. He is wonderfully skilful in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Men and Manners, which has made me more than ordinary curious to know how he came to that Perfection, and I communicated to him that Doubt. Mr. <hi>Pacolet,</hi> ſaid I, I am migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſurpriz'd to ſee you ſo good a Judge of our Nature and Circumſtances, ſince you are a meer Spirit, and have no Knowledge of the Bodily Parts of us. He anſwered, ſmiling, You are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, I have been one of you, and lived a Month amongſt you, which gives me an exact Senſe of your Condition. You are to know, That all who enter into Humane Life, have a certain Date or <hi>Stamen</hi> given to their Being,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0397200201:114"/>
which they only who die of Age may be ſaid to have arrived at; but it is ordered ſometimes by Fate, that ſuch as die Infants, are after Death to attend Mankind to the End of that <hi>Stamen</hi> of Being in themſelves, which was broke off by Sickneſs or any other Diſafter. Theſe are proper Guardians to Men, as being inſenſible of the Infirmity of their State. You are Philoſopher enough to know, that the Difference of Men's Underſtanding proceeds only from the various Diſpoſitions of their Organs; ſo that he who dies at a Month old, is in the next Life as knowing (tho' more innocent) as they who live to Fifty; and after Death, they have as perfect a Memory and Judgment of all that paſs'd in their Life-time, as I have of all the Revolutions in that uneaſie, turbulent Condition of yours; and, you'd ſay, I had enough of it in a Month, were I to tell you all my Misfortunes. A Life of a Month, can't have, one would think, much Variety; but pray, ſaid I, let us have your Story.</p>
               <p>Then he proceeds in the following Manner:</p>
               <p>It was one of the moſt wealthy Families in <hi>Great Britain</hi> into which I was born, and it was a very great Happineſs to me that it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, otherwiſe I had ſtill, in all Probability, been living: But I ſhall recount to you all the Occurrences of my ſhort and miſerable Exiſtence, juſt as, by examining into the Traces made in my Brain, they appeared to me at that Time. The firſt Thing that ever ſtruck my Senſes, was a Noiſe over my Head of one ſhrieking; after which, methought I took a full Jump, and found my ſelf in the Hands of a Sorcereſs, who ſeem'd as if ſhe had been long waking, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſome Incantation: I was throughly frightned, and cried out, but ſhe immediately ſeem'd to go on in ſome Magical Operation, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0397200201:115"/>
anointed me from Head to Foot. What they meant, I could not imagine; for there gather'd a great Crowd about me, crying, <hi>An Heir, an Heir;</hi> upon which I grew a little ſtill, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved this was a Ceremony to be uſed only to great Perſons, and ſuch as made them, what they call'd, <hi>Heirs.</hi> I lay very quiet; but the Witch, for no Manner of Reaſon or Provocation in the World, takes me and binds my Head as hard as poſſibly ſhe could, then ties up both my Legs, and makes me ſwallow down an horrid Mixture; I thought it an harſh Entrance into Life to begin with taking Phyſick; but I was forced to it, or elſe muſt have taken down a great Inſtrument in which ſhe gave it me. When I was thus dreſſed, I was carried to a Bed-ſide, where a fine young Lady (my Mother I wot) had like to have hugg'd me to Death. From her, they faced me about, and there was a Thing with quite another Look from the reſt of the Room, to whom they talk'd about my Noſe. He ſeem'd wonderfully pleas'd to ſee me; but I knew ſince, my Noſe belong'd to another Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. That into which I was born, is one of the moſt numerous amongſt you; therefore Crowds of Relations came every Day to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate my Arrival; among others, my Couſin <hi>Betty,</hi> the greateſt Romp in Nature: She whisks me ſuch a Height over her Head, that I cry'd out for fear of falling. She pinch'd me, and called me ſquealing Chit, and threw me into a Girls Arms that was taken in to tend me. The Girl was very proud of the Womanly Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Nurſe, and took upon her to ſtrip and dreſs me a-new, becauſe I made a Noiſe, to ſee what ailed me: She did ſo, and ſtuck a Pin in every Joint about me. I ſtill cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Upon which, ſhe lays me on my Face in her Lap; and to quiet me, fell a nailing in all
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0397200201:116"/>
the Pins, by clapping me on the Back, and skreaming a Lullaby. But my Pain made me exalt my Voice above hers, which brought up the Nurſe, the Witch I firſt ſaw, and my Grandmother. The Girl is turn'd down Stairs, and I ſtripp'd again, as well to find what ail'd me, as to ſatisfy my Granam's further Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This good old Woman's Viſit was the Cauſe of all my Troubles. You are to underſtand, That I was hitherto bred by Hand, and any Body that ſtood next, gave me Pap, if I did but open my Lips; inſomuch, that I was grown ſo cunning, as to pretend my ſelf aſleep when I was not, to prevent my being cramm'd. But my Grandmother began a loud Lecture upon the Idleneſs of the Wives of this Age, who, for Fear of their Shapes, forbear ſuckling their own Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring: And Ten Nurſes were immediately ſent for; one was whiſper'd to have a wanton Eye, and would ſoon ſpoil her Milk; another was in a Conſumption; the Third had an ill Voice, and would frighten me, inſtead of lulling me to ſleep. Such Exceptions were made againſt all but one Country Milch-Wench, to whom I was committed, and put to the Breaſt. This care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Jade was eternally romping with the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and downright ſtarved me; inſomuch that I daily pined away, and ſhould never have been reliev'd, had it not been, that on the Thirtieth Day of my Life, a Fellow of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> who had writ upon <hi>Cold Baths,</hi> came to viſit me, and ſolemnly proteſted, I was utterly loſt for want of that Method: Upon which he ſous'd me Head and Ears into a Pail of Water, where I had the good Fortune to be drowned, and ſo eſcap'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laſh'd into a Linguiſt till Sixteen, running after Wenches till Twenty five, and being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to an ill natured Wife till Sixty: Which had certainly been my Fate, had not the Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0397200201:117"/>
between Body and Soul been broke by this Philoſopher. Thus, till the Age I ſhould have otherwiſe liv'd. I am oblig'd to watch the Steps of Men; and if you pleaſe, ſhall accompany you in your preſent Walks, and get you Intelligence from the Aerial Lacquey, who is in Waiting, what are the Thoughts and Purpoſes of any whom you enquire for. I accepted his kind Offer, and immediately took him with me in an Hack to <hi>White</hi>'s.</p>

               <p>The firſt Thing we took Notice of, was a Nobleman of a goodly and frank Aſpect, with his generous Birth and Temper viſible in it, playing at Cards with a Creature of a black and horrid Countenance, wherein were plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated the Arts of his Mind, Couſenage and Falſhood. They were marking their Game with Counters, on which we could ſee Inſcriptions, imperceptible to any but us. My Lord had ſcor'd with Pieces of Ivory, on which were writ, <hi>Good Fame, Glory, Riches, Honour, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</hi> The Spectre over-againſt him had on his Counters the Inſcriptions of <hi>Diſhonour. Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Poverty, Ignorance, and Want of Shame.</hi> Bleſs me! ſaid I; Sure my Lord does not ſee what he plays for! As well as I do, ſays <hi>Pacolet.</hi> He deſpiſes that Fellow he plays with, and ſcorns himſelf for making him his Companion. At the very Inſtant he was ſpeaking, I ſaw the Fellow who play'd with my Lord, hide Two Cards in the Roll of his Stocking: <hi>Pacolet</hi> immediately ſtole 'em from thence; upon which the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

Mr. <hi>Iſaac,</hi> This to you looks wonderful, but not at all to us higher Beings: That Noble has as many good Qualities as any Man of his Order, and ſeems to have no Faults but what, as I may ſay, are Excreſcencies from Virtues. He is Generous to a Prodigality, more Affable than is conſiſtent with his Quality, and Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to a Raſhneſs. Yet, after all this, the Source of his whole Conduct is (tho' he would hate himſelf if he knew it) meer Avarice. The Ready Caſh laid before the Gameſter's Counters makes him venture, as you ſee, and lay Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt Infamy, Abundance againſt Want; in a Word, all that's deſirable againſt all that's to be avoided. However, ſaid I, be ſure you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint the Sharpers to Night, and ſteal from 'em all the Cards they hide. <hi>Pacolet</hi> obey'd me, and my Lord went Home with their whole Bank in his Pocket.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Knight,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I Deſire you would give my humble Service to all our Friends, which I ſpeak of to you (out of Method) in the very Beginning of my Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, leſt the preſent Diſorders, by which this Seat of Gallantry and Pleaſure is torn to Pieces, ſhould make me forget it. You keep ſo good Company, that you know <hi>Bath</hi> is ſtock'd with ſuch as come hither to be relieved from luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Health, or imaginary Sickneſs, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is always as well ſtowed with Gallants as Invalids, who live together in a very good
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0397200201:121"/>
Underſtanding. But the Seaſon is ſo early, that our fine Company is not yet arrived; and the Warm Bath, which in Heathen Times was dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>Venus,</hi> is now uſed only by ſuch as really want it for Health's Sake. There are however a good many Strangers, among whom are Two ambitious Ladies, who being both in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn of their Life, take the Opportunity of placing themſelves at the Head of ſuch as we are, before the <hi>Chloe's, Clariſſa's,</hi> and <hi>Paſtorella's</hi> come down. One of theſe Two is exceſſively in Pain, that the ugly Being called <hi>Time</hi> will make Wrinkles in Spite of the Lead Forehead-Cloth; and therefore hides with the Gaiery of her Air, the Volubility of her Tongue, and Quickneſs of her Motion, the Injuries which it has done her. The other Lady is but Two Years behind her in Life, and dreads as much being laid aſide as the former, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly has taken the neceſſary Precautions to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent her Reign over us. But ſhe is very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, and wonderfully turned for Ambition, being never apparently tranſported either with Affectation or Malice. Thus, while <hi>Florimel</hi> is talking in Publick, and ſpreading her Graces in Aſſemblies, to gain a Popular Dominion over our Diverſions, <hi>Prudentia</hi> viſits very cunningly all the Lame, the Splenatick, and the Superan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, who have their diſtinct Claſſes of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and Friends. Among theſe, ſhe has found that ſome Body has ſent down printed Certificates of <hi>Florimel</hi>'s Age, which ſhe has read and diſtributed to this unjoyful Set of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are always Enemies to thoſe in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the good Opinion of the Company. This unprovoked Injury done by <hi>Prudentia,</hi> was the firſt Occaſion of our fatal Diviſions here, and a Declaration of War between theſe Rivals. <hi>Florimel</hi> has abundance of Wit, which ſhe has
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0397200201:122"/>
laviſh'd in decrying <hi>Prudentia,</hi> and giving De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to her little Arts. For an Inſtance of her ſuperior Power, ſhe beſpoke the Play of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander the Great,</hi> to be acted by the Company of Strollers, and deſired us all to be there on <hi>Thurſday</hi> laſt. When ſhe ſpoke to me to come, <hi>As you are,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>a Lover, you will not fail the Death of</hi> Alexander: <hi>The Paſſion of Love is wonderfully hit—</hi>Statira! <hi>Oh that happy Woman—To have a Conqueror at her Feet—But you'll be ſure to be there.</hi> I, and ſeveral others, reſolv'd to be of her Party. But ſee the irreſiſtible Strength of that unſuſpected Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a <hi>Silent Woman. Prudentia</hi> had counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotted us, and had beſpoke on the ſame Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popper-Show of <hi>The Creation of the World.</hi> She had engaged every Body to be there; and to turn our Leader into Ridicule, had ſecretly let 'em know, that the Poppet <hi>Eve</hi> was made the moſt like <hi>Florimel</hi> that ever was ſeen. On <hi>Thurſday</hi> Morning the <hi>Poppet-Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and ſeveral others who lived before the Flood, paſs'd thro' the Streets on Horſeback, to invite us all to the Paſtime, and the Repreſentation of ſuch Things as we all knew to be true; and Mr. Mayor was ſo wiſe as to prefer theſe innocent People the Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, who, he ſaid, were to repreſent Chriſtians, before the wicked Players, who were to ſhow <hi>Alexander,</hi> an Heathen Philoſopher. To be ſhort, this <hi>Prudentia</hi> had ſo laid it, that at Ten of the Clock Footmen were ſent to take Places at the Poppet-Show, and all we of <hi>Florimel</hi>'s Party were to be out of Faſhion, or deſert her. We choſe the latter. All the World crowded to <hi>Prudentia</hi>'s Houſe, becauſe it was given out, no Body could get in. When we came to <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood in the Show, <hi>Punch</hi> and his Wife were introduced dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the Ark. An honeſt plain Friend of <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel</hi>'s,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0397200201:123"/>
but a Critick withal, roſe up in the midſt of the Repreſentation, and made many very good Exceptions to the <hi>Drama</hi> it ſelf, and told us. That it was againſt all Morality, as well as Rules of the Stage, that <hi>Punch</hi> ſhould be in Jeſt in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, or indeed that he ſhould appear at all. This was certainly a juſt Remark, and I thought to ſecond him; but he was hiſs'd by <hi>Prudentia</hi>'s Party; upon which, really, Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> we who were his Friends hiſs'd him too. Old Mrs. <hi>Petulent</hi> deſired both her Daughters to mind the Moral; then whiſpered Mrs. Mayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, <hi>This is very proper for young People to ſee. Punch</hi> at the End of the Play made Madam <hi>Prudentia</hi> a Compliment, and was very civil to the whole Company, making Bows till his Buttons touch'd the Ground. All was carried triumphantly againſt our Party. In the mean Time <hi>Florimel</hi> went to the Tragedy, dreſs'd as fine as Hands could make her, in Hopes to ſee <hi>Prudentia</hi> pine away with Envy. Inſtead of that, ſhe ſate a full Hour alone, and at laſt was entertain'd with this whole Relation from <hi>Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> who wiped her Eyes with her Tragical cut Handkerchief, and lamented the Ignorance of the Quality. <hi>Florimel</hi> was ſtung with this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, and the next Day beſpoke the Poppet-Show. <hi>Prudentia,</hi> inſolent with Power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke <hi>Alexander.</hi> The whole Company came then to <hi>Alexander.</hi> Madam <hi>Petulant</hi> deſired her Daughters to mind the Moral, and believe no Man's fair Words; <hi>For you'll ſee Children,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>theſe Soldiers are never to be depended upon; they are ſometimes here, ſometimes there—Don't you ſee. Daughter</hi> Betty, <hi>Colonel</hi> Clod, <hi>our next Neighbour in the Country, pulls off his Hat to you? Court'ſie, good Child, his Eſtate is juſt by us. Florimel</hi> was now mortified down to <hi>Prudentia</hi>'s Humour; and <hi>Prudentia</hi> exalted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0397200201:124"/>
hers. This was obſerved: <hi>Florimel</hi> invites us to the Play a Second Time, <hi>Prudentia</hi> to the Show. See the Uncertainty of Humane Affairs! The Beaux, the Wits, the Gameſters, the Prues, the Coquets, the Valitudinarians, and Gallants, all now wait upon <hi>Florimel.</hi> Such is the State of Things at this preſent Date; and if there happens any new Commotions, you ſhall have immediate Advice from,</p>

But indeed, I dare not go further in this Matter, than juſt this bare Mention; for though it was taking your Place of Right, rather than Place of Precedence, yet it is ſo tender a Point, and on which the very Life of Female Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition depends, that it is of the laſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to meddle in it: All my Hopes are from your beautiful Sex; and thoſe bright Eyes, which are the Bane of others, are my only Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine.

               <p>Letters from the <hi>Hague,</hi> bearing Date the 21ſt Inſtant, <hi>N. S.</hi> adviſe, That his Grace the Duke of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> immediately after his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, ſent his Secretary to the Preſident and the Penſionary, to acquaint them therewith. Soon after, theſe Miniſters viſited the Duke, and made him Compliments in the Name of the States-General; after which they enter'd into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with him on the preſent Poſture of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and gave his Grace Aſſurances of the firm Adherence of the States to the Alliance: At the ſame Time acquainting him, That all Overtures of Peace were rejected, till they had an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of acting in Concert with their Allies on that Subject. After this Interview, the Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and the Preſident returned to the Aſſembly of the States. Monſieur <hi>Torcy</hi> has had a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at the Penſioner's Houſe with his Grace the Duke of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> Prince <hi>Eugene,</hi> and his Excellency the Lord <hi>Townſhend.</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of what was debated at that Time is kept ſecret; but there appears an Air of Satisfaction and good Underſtanding between theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0397200201:126"/>
We are apt alſo to give our ſelves very hopeful Proſpects from Monſieur <hi>Torcy</hi>'s being employed in this Negotiation, who has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remarkable for a particular Way of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in his Senſe of the Greatneſs of <hi>France;</hi> which he has always ſaid, <hi>Was to be promoted rather by the Arts of Peace, than thoſe of War.</hi> His delivering himſelf freely on this Subject, has formerly appeared an unſucceſsful Way to Power in that Court; but in its preſent Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thoſe Maxims are better received; and it is thought a certain Argument of the Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>French</hi> King's Intentions, that this Miniſter is at preſent made uſe of. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis is to return to <hi>Paris</hi> within few Days, who has ſent a Courier thither to give Notice of the Reaſons of his Return, that the Court may be the ſooner able to diſpatch Commiſſioners for a formal Treaty.</p>
               <p>The Expectations of Peace are increaſed by Advices from <hi>Paris</hi> of the 17th Inſtant, which ſay, The Dauphin hath altered his Reſolution of commanding in <hi>Flanders</hi> the enſuing Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign. The <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Pruſſian</hi> Reinforcements, together with Count <hi>Merci</hi>'s Regiment of Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Horſe, are encamped in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> and ſufficient Stores of Corn and Forage are tranſported to that Place and <hi>Ghent</hi> for the Service of the Confederate Army.</p>
               <p>They write from <hi>Mons,</hi> That the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had Advice, That an advanced Party of the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Army had been defeated by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>THE Diſcourſe has happened to turn this Evening upon the true Nature of Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, the Perfection of which was aſſerted to conſiſt in a certain artful Way of conveying the Applauſe in an indirect Manner. There was a Gentleman gave us ſeveral Inſtances of it: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, he quoted (from Sir <hi>Francis Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> in his <hi>Advancement of Learning</hi>) a very great Compliment made to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as follows: In a full Debate upon Publick Affairs in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, one of the Aſſembly roſe up, and with a very grave Air ſaid, He thought it for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Dignity of the Commonwealth, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſhould be declared a God, and have Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip paid him. The Emperor was ſurprized at the Propoſal, and demanded of him to declare whether he had made any Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to incline him to that Overture? The Senator anſwered, with a bold and haughty Tone, <hi>Sir, In Matters that concern the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, I will be governed by no Man.</hi> Another Gentleman mentioned ſomething of the ſame Kind ſpoken by the late Duke of <hi>B—m,</hi> to the late Earl of <hi>O—y: My Lord,</hi> (ſays the Duke, after his Libertine Way) <hi>you will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be Damn'd. How, my Lord!</hi> ſays the Earl with ſome Warmth. <hi>Nay,</hi> ſays the Duke, <hi>there's no Help for it, for it is poſitively ſaid, Curſed is he of whom all Men ſpeak well.</hi> This is taking a Man by Surprize, and being welcome when you have ſo ſurprized him. The Perſon flattered receives you into his Cloſet at once; and the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0397200201:128"/>
ſudden Change in his Heart, from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of an Ill-wiſher, to find you his Friend, makes you in his full Favour in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Spirits that were raiſed ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt you, are as ſuddenly for you. There was another Inſtance given of this Kind at the Table: A Gentleman who had a very great Favour done him, and an Employment beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, without ſo much as being known to his Benefactor, waited upon the Great Man who was ſo Generous, and was beginning to ſay, he was infinitely obliged. <hi>Not at all,</hi> ſays the Patron, turning from him to another, <hi>Had I known a more deſerving Man in</hi> England, <hi>he ſhould not have had it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhould certainly have had more Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, had not a Gentleman produced a Book which he thought an Inſtance of this kind: It was a Pamphlet, call'd, <hi>The Naked Truth.</hi> The Idea any one would have of that Work from the Title, was, That there would be much Plain Dealing with People in Power, and that we ſhould ſee Things in their proper Light, ſtripped of the Ornaments which are uſually given to the Actions of the Great: But the Skill of this Author is ſuch, that he has, under that rugged Appearance, approved himſelf the fineſt Gentleman and Courtier that ever writ. The Language is extremely ſublime, and not at all to be underſtood by the Vulgar: The Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſuch as would make no Figure in ordinary Words; but ſuch is the Art of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and the Thoughts are elevated to ſo high a Degree, that I queſtion whether the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will ſell much. There was an ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured Fellow preſent, who hates all Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick mortally. <hi>P— take him!</hi> ſaid he, <hi>What the Devil means his</hi> Naked Truth, <hi>in ſpeaking nothing but to the Advantage of all whom he</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0397200201:129"/>
                  <hi>mentions? This is juſt ſuch a great Action as that of the Champion's on a Coronation Day, who chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges all Mankind to diſpute with him the Right of the Sovereign, ſurrounded with his Guards.</hi> The Gentleman who produced the Treatiſe, deſired him to be cautious, and ſaid, it was writ by an excellent Soldier, which made the Company obſerve it more narrowly: And (as Criticks are the greateſt Conjurers at finding out a known <hi>Truth</hi>) one ſaid, he was ſure it was writ by the Hand of his Sword-Arm. I could not perceive much wit in that Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but it rais'd a Laugh, and I ſuppoſe, was meant as a Sneer upon valiant Men. The ſame Man pretended to ſee in the Style, that it was an Horſe-Officer; but ſure that's being too nice: For though you may know Officers of the Cavalry by the Turn of their <hi>Feet,</hi> I can't ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how you ſhould diſcern their <hi>Hands</hi> from thoſe of other Men. But it is always thus with Pedants; they will ever be carping, if a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman or a Man of Honour puts Pen to Paper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

I will therefore ſet this Excellent Piece in a Light too glaring for weak Eyes, and, in Imitation of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>Longinus,</hi> ſhall, as well as I can, make my Obſervations in a Style like the Author's, of whom I treat; which perhaps I am as capable of as another, having <hi>an unbounded Force of Thinking, as well as a moſt exquiſite Addreſs extenſively and wiſely indulged to me by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preme Powers.</hi> My Author, I will dare to aſſert ſhows the moſt Univerſal Knowledge of any Writer who has appeared this Century.

but to carry on a Defenſive Part. But his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments could not avail in the Council of War. Upon which, a great Detachment of Foot, and the whole of the Horſe of the King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>'s Army, paſſed the River, and with ſome Pieces of Cannon did good Execution on the Enemy. Upon obſerving this, the Marquis <hi>de Bay</hi> advanced with his Horſe, and attacked the Right Wing of the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Cavalry, who faced about, and fled, without ſtanding the firſt Encounter. But their Foot repulſed the ſame Body of Horſe in three ſucceſſive Charges, with great Order and Reſolution. While this was tranſacting, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> General com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Brigade of <hi>Pearce,</hi> to keep the Enemy in Diverſion by a new Attack. This was ſo well executed, that the <hi>Portugueze</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry had Time to retire in good Order, and repaſs the River. But that Brigade, which reſcued 'em, was it ſelf ſurrounded by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and Major-General <hi>Sarkey,</hi> Brigadier <hi>Pearce,</hi> together with both their Regiments, and that of the Lord <hi>Galway,</hi> lately raiſed, were taken Priſoners.</p>
               <p>During the Engagement, the Earl of <hi>Barry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> having advanced too far to give ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Order, was hemmed in by a Squadron of the Enemy; but found Means to gallop up to the Brigade of <hi>Pearce,</hi> with which he remains alſo a Priſoner. My Lord <hi>Galway</hi> had his Horſe ſhot under him in this Action; and the Conde <hi>de St. Juan,</hi> a <hi>Portugueze</hi> General, was taken Priſoner. The ſame Night the Army encamped at <hi>Aronches,</hi> and on the 9th moved to <hi>Elvas,</hi> where they lay when theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches came away. Colonel <hi>Stanwix</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is alſo taken. The whole of this Affair has given the <hi>Portugueze</hi> a great Idea of the Capacity and Courage of my Lord <hi>Galway,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0397200201:132"/>
whoſe Advice they entered upon this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Affair, and by whoſe Conduct they were reſcued from it. The prodigious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Reſolution of that great Man is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be parallel'd, who, under the Oppreſſion of a maimed Body, and the Reflection of repeated ill Fortune, goes on with an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Alacrity in the Service of the Common Cauſe. He has already put Things in a very good Poſture after this ill Accident, and made the neceſſary Diſpoſitions for covering the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from any further Attempt of the Enemy, who lie ſtill in the Camp they were in before the Battle.</p>
               <p>Letters from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> dated the 25th Inſtant, adviſe, That notwithſtanding the Negotiations of a Peace ſeem ſo far advanced, that ſome do confidently report the Preliminaries of a Treaty to be actually agreed on; yet the Allies haſten their Preparations for opening the Campaign; and the Forces of the Empire, the <hi>Pruſſians,</hi> the <hi>Danes,</hi> the <hi>Wirtembergers,</hi> the <hi>Palatines,</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Auxiliaries, are in Motion towards the General Rendevous, they being already ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> Theſe Advices add, That the Deputies of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> having made a General Review of the Troops in <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſet out for <hi>Antwerp</hi> on the 21ſt Inſtant from that Place.

               <p>IT is obſerved too often, that Men of Wit do ſo much employ their Thoughts upon fine Speculations, that Things uſeful to Mankind are wholly neglected; and they are buſy in making Emendations upon ſome Encliticks in a <hi>Greek</hi> Author, while obvious Things, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man may have uſe for, are wholly overlooked. It would be an happy Thing, if ſuch as have real Capacities for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service, were employed in Works of general Uſe; but becauſe a Thing is every Body's Buſineſs, it is no Body's Buſineſs: This is for Want of publick Spirit. As for my Part, who am only a Student, and a Man of no great Intereſt, I can only remark Things, and recommend the Correction of 'em to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Powers. There is an Offence I have a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Times lamented, but fear I ſhall never ſee remedi d; which is, That in a Nation where Learning is ſo frequent as in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> there ſhould be ſo many groſs Errors as there are in the very Directions of Things, wherein Accuracy is neceſſary ſo the Conduct of Life. This is notoriouſly obſerved by all Men of Letters when they firſt come to Town (at
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0397200201:134"/>
which Time they are uſually curious that Way) in the Inſcriptions on Sign-Poſts. I have Cauſe to know this Matter as well as any Body; for I have (when I went to Merchant-Taylor's School) ſuffered Stripes for ſpelling after the Signs I obſerved in my Way; tho' at the ſame Time, I muſt confeſs, ſtaring at thoſe Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions firſt gave me an Idea and Curioſity for Medals; in which I have ſince arrived at ſome Knowledge. Many a Man has loſt his Way and his Dinner by this general Want of Skill in Orthography: For, conſidering that the Painters are uſually ſo very bad, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know the Animal under whoſe Sign you are to live that Day, How muſt the Stranger be miſſed, if it be wrong ſpelled, as well as ill painted? I have a Couſin now in Town, who has anſwered under <hi>Batchellor</hi> at <hi>Queen</hi>'s College, whoſe Name is <hi>Humphrey Mopſtaff:</hi> (He is a Kin to us by his Mother.) This young Man going to ſee a Relation in <hi>Barbekin,</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a whole Day by the Miſtake of one Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for it was written, <hi>This is the BEER,</hi> inſtead of, <hi>This is the BEAR.</hi> He was ſet right at laſt, by enquiring for the Houſe, of a Fellow who could not read, and knew the Place mechanically, only by having been often drunk there. But, in the Name of Goodneſs, let us make our Learning of Uſe to us, or not. Was not this a Shame, that a Philoſopher ſhould be thus directed by a Cobler? I'll be ſworn, if it were known how many have ſuffered in this Kind by falſe Speeling ſince the Union, this Matter would not long lie thus. What makes theſe Evils the more inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is, That they are ſo eaſily amended, and nothing done in it. But it is ſo far from that, that the Evil goes on in other Arts as well as Orthography. Places are confounded, as well
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0397200201:135"/>
for want of proper Diſtinctions, as Things for Want of true Characters. Had I not come by the other Day very early in the Morning, there might have been Miſchief done; for a worthy <hi>North-Britain</hi> was ſwearing at <hi>Stocks-market</hi> that they would not let him in at his Ludg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but I knowing the Gentleman, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving him look often at the King on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and then double his Oaths, that he was ſure he was right, found he miſtook that for <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> by the Erection of the like Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in each Place. I grant, private Men may diſtinguiſh their Abodes as they pleaſe; as one of my Acquaintance who lives at <hi>Marybone,</hi> has put a good Sentence of his own Invention upon his Dwelling-place, to find out where he lives: He is ſo near <hi>London,</hi> that his Conceit is this, <hi>The Country in Town;</hi> or, <hi>The Town in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> for you know, if they are both in one, they are all one. Beſides that, the Ambiguity is not of great Conſequence; if you are ſafe at the Place, 'tis no Matter if you do not diſtinctly know where to ſay the Place is. But to return to the Orthography of Publick Places: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, That every Tradeſman in the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſhall give me Sixpence a Quarter for keeping their Signs in Repair, as to the Grammatical Part; and I will take into my Houſe a <hi>Swiſs</hi> Count of my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who can remember all their Names without Book, for Diſpatch ſake, ſetting up the Head of the ſaid Foreigner for my Sign; the Features being ſtrong, and fit for hanging high.</p>

               <p>This Day a Mail arrived from <hi>Holland,</hi> by which there are Advices from <hi>Paris,</hi> That the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> is in the utmoſt Miſery and Diſtraction. The Merchants of <hi>Lions</hi> have been
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0397200201:136"/>
at Court, to remonſtrate their great Sufferings by the Failure of their Publick Credit; but have received no other Satisfaction, than Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of a ſudden Peace; and that their Debts will be made good by Funds out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, which will not anſwer, but in caſe of the Peace which is promiſed. In the mean Time, the Cries of the common People are loud for Want of Bread, the Gentry have loſt all Spirit and Zeal for their Country, and the King himſelf ſeems to languiſh under the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety of the preſſing Calamities of the Nation, and retires from hearing thoſe Grievances, which he hath not Power to redreſs. Inſtead of Preparations for War, and the Defence of their Country, there is nothing to be ſeen but evident Marks of a general Deſpair. Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Faſtings, Publick Mournings, and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, are become the ſole Employments of a People, who were lately the moſt vain and gay of any in the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>The Pope has written to the <hi>French</hi> King on the Subject of a Peace, and his Majeſty has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the lowlieſt Terms, That he entirely ſubmits his Affairs to Divine Providence, and ſhall ſoon ſhow the World, that he prefers the Tranquility of his People to the Glory of his Arms, and Extent of his Conqueſts.</p>
               <p>Letters from the <hi>Hague</hi> of the 24th ſay, That his Excellency the Lord <hi>Toxnſhend</hi> delivered his Credentials on that Day to the States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as Plenipotentiary from the Queen of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> as did alſo Count <hi>Zinzendorf,</hi> who bears the ſame Character from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> intended to ſet out the next Day for <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and his Grace the Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi> on the <hi>Tueſday</hi> following. The Marquis <hi>de Torcy</hi> talks daily of going, but ſtill

continues here. The Army of the Allies is to aſſemble on the 7th of the next Month at <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin;</hi> though 'tis generally believed, that the Preliminar es to a Treaty are fully adjuſted.</p>
               <p>The Approech of a Peace ſtrikes a Pannick thro' ou Armies, tho' that of a Battle could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do it, and they almoſt repent of their Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, that made ſuch haſt to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the <hi>French</hi> King. The Duke of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> tho' otherwiſe the greateſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Age, has plainly ſhown himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the Arts of Husbanding a War. He might have grown as old as the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> or Prince <hi>Waldeck,</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and yet have got Reputation enough every Year for any reaſonable Man: For the Command of General in <hi>Flanders</hi> hath been ever looked upon as a Proviſion for Life. For my Pa t, I can't ſee how his Grace can anſwer it to the World, for the great Eagerneſs he hath ſhown to ſend a Hundred Thouſand of the braveſt Fellows in <hi>Europe</hi> a begging. But the pr vate Gentlemen of the Infantry will be able to ſhift for themſelves; a brave Man can never ſtarve in a Country ſtock'd with Hen-rooſts. <hi>There is not a Yard of Linnen,</hi> ſays my honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed P ogenitor, Sir <hi>John Falſtaff, in my whole Company; but as for that,</hi> ſays this worthy Knight, <hi>I am in no great Pain, we ſhall find Shirts on every Heage.</hi> There is another Sort of Gentlemen whom I am much more concerned for, and that is, the ingenious Fraternity of which I have the Honour to be an unworthy Member; I mean th <hi>News-Writers of Great Britain,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Poſt-Men</hi> or <hi>Poſt-Boys,</hi> or by what other Name or Title ſoever dignified or diſtinguiſhed. The Caſe of theſe Gentlemen is, I think, more hard than that of the Soldiers, conſidering that they have taken more Towns, and fought more
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0397200201:138"/>
Battels. They have been upon Parties and Skirmiſhes, when our Armies have lain ſtill; and given the General Aſſault to many a Place, when the Beſiegers were quiet in their Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. They have made us Maſters of ſeveral ſtrong Towns many Weeks before our Generals could do it; and compleated Victories, when our greateſt Captains have been glad to come off with a drawn Battle. Where Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> has ſlain his Thouſands, <hi>Boyer</hi> has ſlain his Ten Thouſands. This Gentleman can indeed be never enough commended for his Courage and Intrepidity during this whole War: He has laid about him with an inexpreſſible Fury, and like the offended <hi>Marius</hi> of Ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> made ſuch Havock among his Countrymen, as muſt be the Work of Two or Three Ages to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. It muſt be confeſs'd, the Redoubted Mr. <hi>Buckley</hi> has ſhed as much Blood as the former; but I cannot forbear ſaying, (and I hope it will not look like Envy) that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard our Brother <hi>Buckley</hi> as a kind of <hi>Drawcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir,</hi> who ſpares neither Friend or Foe: But gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally kills as many of his own Side as the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's. It is impoſſible for this ingenious Sort of Men to ſubſiſt after a Peace: Every one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members the Shifts they were driven to in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, when they could not furniſh out a ſingle Paper of News, without lighting up a Comet in <hi>Germany,</hi> or a Fire in <hi>Moſcow.</hi> There ſcarce appeared a Letter without a Paragraph on an Earthquake. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies were grown ſo familiar, that they had loſt their Name, as a great Poet of that Age has it I remember Mr. <hi>Dyer,</hi> who is juſtly look'd upon by all the Fox-hunters in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the greateſt Stateſman our Country has produced, was particularly famous for dealing in Whales, inſomuch that in Five Months Time

               <p>THERE is nothing can give a Man of any Conſideration greater Pain, than to ſee Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Diſtinction laid aſide amongſt Men, eſpecially when the Rank (of which he himſelf is a Member) is intruded upon by ſuch as have no Pretence to that Honour. The Appellation of <hi>Eſquire</hi> is the moſt notoriouſly abuſed in this Kind of any Claſs amongſt Men, inſomuch that it is become almoſt the Subject of Deriſion; but I will be bold to ſay, This Behaviour towards it proceeds from the Ignorance of the People in its true Origine. I ſhall therefore, as briefly as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, do my ſelf and all true <hi>Eſquires</hi> the Juſtice to look into Antiquity upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>In the Firſt Ages of the World, before the Invention of Jointures and Settlements, when the noble Paſſion of Love had Poſſeſſion of the Hearts of Men, and the Fair Sex were not yet cultivated into the merciful Diſpoſition which they have ſhowed in latter Centuries, it was natural for Great and Heroick Spirits to retire to Rivulets, Woods, and Caves, to lament their Deſtiny, and the Cruelty of the fair Perſons who were deaf to their Lamentations. The Hero in this Diſtreſs was generally in Armour, and in a Readineſs to fight any Man he met with, eſpecially if diſtinguiſhed by any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Qualifications, it being the Nature of Heroick Love to hate all Merit, leſt it ſhould
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0397200201:143"/>
come within the Obſervation of the Cruel One, by whom its own Perfections are neglected. A Lover of this Kind had always about him a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Second Value, and ſubordinate to him, who could hear his Afflictions, carry an Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his Wounds, hold his Helmet when he was eating (if ever he did eat); or in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, when he was retired to his Apartment in any King's Palace, tell the Prince himſelf, or perhaps his Daughter, the Birth, Parentage, and Adventures, of his valiant Maſter. This truſty Companion was ſtyled his <hi>Eſquire,</hi> and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fit for any Offices about him; was as gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and chaſt as a Gentleman-Uſher, quick and active as an Equerry, ſmooth and eloquent as a Maſter of the Ceremonies. A Man thus qualified was the firſt, as the Ancients affirm, who was called an <hi>Eſquire;</hi> and none without theſe Accompliſhments ought to aſſume our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: But, to the utter Diſgrace and Confuſion of the Heralds, every Pretender is admitted into this Fraternity, even Perſons the moſt Foreign to this courteous Inſtitution I have taken an Inventory of all within this City, and looked over every Letter in the <hi>Poſt-Office</hi> for my better Information. There are of the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-Temple,</hi> including all in the Buttery-Books, and in the Liſts of the Houſe, 5000. In the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> 4000. In the <hi>King's Bench Walks</hi> the whole Buildings are inhabited by Eſquires only. The adjacent Street of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> from <hi>Morris</hi>'s Coffee-houſe, and the Turning towards the <hi>Graecian,</hi> you cannot meet one who is not an Eſquire. 'till you take Water. Every Houſe in <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Arundel</hi> Streets is gove ned alſo by a 'Squire, or his Lady. <hi>Soho-Square, Bloomsbury-Square,</hi> and all other Places, where the Floors riſe above Nine Foot, are ſo many Univerſities, where you enter your ſelves, and become of our Order.

However, if this were the worſt of the Evil, it were to be ſupported, becauſe they are generally Men of ſome Figure and Uſe; though I know no Pretence they have to an Honour which had its Riſe from Chivalry. But if you travel into the Counties of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> we are ſtill more impoſed upon by Innovation. We are indeed derived from the Field: But ſhall that give Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to all that ride mad after Foxes, that holloo when they ſee an Hare, or venture their Necks full Speed after an Hawk, immediately to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence Eſquires? No; our Order is Temperate, Cleanly, Sober, and Chaſt; but theſe Rural Eſquires commit Immodeſties upon Hay-cocks, wear Shirts half a Week, and are drunk Twice a Day. Theſe Men are alſo to the laſt Degree exceſſive in their Food: An Eſquire of <hi>Norfolk</hi> eats Two Pounds of Dumplin every Meal, as if obliged to it by our Order: An Eſquire in <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> is as ravenous in devouring Hogs-fleſh: One of <hi>Eſſex</hi> has as little Mercy on Calves.

It would be impious not to acknowledge the Indulgence of Heaven to us; but at the ſame Time, as we are to love our Enemies, we are glad to ſee 'em mortified enough to mix Chriſtianity with their Politicks.

               <p>IT is not to be imagined how far Prepoſſeſſion will run away with People's Underſtandings, in Caſes wherein they are under preſent Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The following Narration is a ſufficient Teſtimony of the Truth of this Obſervation.</p>
               <p>I had the Honour the other Day of a Viſit from a Gentlewoman (a Stranger to me) who ſeemed to be about Thirty. Her Complexion is Brown; but the Air of her Face has an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, which ſurpaſſes the Beauties of the Faireſt Women. There appeared in her Look and Mien a ſprightly Health; and her Eyes had too much Vivacity to become the Language of Complaint, which ſhe began to enter into. She ſeemed ſenſible of it; and therefore, with
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0397200201:149"/>
down-caſt Looks, ſaid ſhe, Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> You ſee before you the unhappieſt of Women; and therefore, as you are eſteemed by all the World both a great Civilian, as well as an Aſtrologer, I muſt deſire your Advice and Aſſiſtance, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me in a Method of obtaining a Divorce from a Marriage, which I know the Law will pronounce void. Madam, ſaid I, your Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance is of ſuch a Nature, that you muſt be very ingenuous in repreſenting the Cauſes of your Complaint, or I cannot give you the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction you deſire. Sir, ſhe anſwers, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved there would be no need of half your Skill in the Art of Divination, to gueſs why a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would part from her Husband. 'Tis true, ſaid I, but Suſpicions, or Gueſſes at what you mean, nay, Certainty of it, except you plainly ſpeak it, are no Foundation for a formal Suit. She clap'd her Fan before her Face; My Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſaid ſhe, is no more an Husband <hi>(here ſhe burſt into Tears)</hi> than one of the <hi>Italian</hi> Singers.</p>
               <p>Madam, ſaid I, the Affliction you complain of, is to be redreſſed by Law; but at the ſame Time, conſider what Mortifications you are to go through in bringing it into open Court; how you will be able to bear the impertinent Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the People preſent at the Tryal, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Reflections of the Pleaders, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations that will in general be put upon your Conduct by all the World: How little (will they ſay) could that Lady command her Paſſions. Beſides, conſider, that curbing our Deſires is the greateſt Glory we can arrive at in this World, and will be moſt rewarded in the next. She anſwered, like a prudent Matron, Sir, if you pleaſe to remember the Office of Matrimony, the firſt Cauſe of its Inſtitution is that of having Poſterity: Therefore, as to the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0397200201:150"/>
curbing Deſires, I am willing to undergo any Abſtinence from Food as you pleaſe to enjoin me; but I cannot, with any Quiet of Mind, live in the Neglect of a neceſſary Duty, and an expreſs Commandment, <hi>Increaſe and Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</hi> Obſerving ſhe was learned, and knew ſo well the Duties of Life, I turned my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments rather to dehort her from this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Procedure by Examples, than Precepts. Do but conſider, Madam, what Crowds of beauteous Women live in Nunneries, ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ever from the Sight and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men, with all the Alacrity of Spirit imaginable; they ſpend their Time in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Raptures, in conſtant and frequent Devotion, and at proper Hours in agreeable Converſations. Sir, ſaid ſhe haſtily, Tell not me of Papiſts, or any of their Idolatries. Well then, Madam, conſider how many fine Ladies live innocently in the Eye of the World, and this gay Town, in the midſt of Temptation: There's the Witty Mrs. <hi>W—</hi> is a Virgin of 44, Mrs. <hi>T—s</hi> is 39, Mrs. <hi>L—ce</hi> 33; yet you ſee, they laugh and are gay, at the Park, at the Play-houſe, at Balls, and at Viſits; and ſo much at Eaſe, that all this ſeems hardly a Self-denial. Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> ſaid ſhe, with ſome Emotion, you are an excellent Caſuiſt; but the laſt Word deſtroyed your whole Argument; if it is not Self-denial, it is no Virtue. I preſented you with an Half-Guinea, in Hopes not only to have my Conſcience eas'd, but my Fortune told. Yet—Well Madam, ſaid I, Pray of what Age is your Husband? He is, reply'd my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Client, Fifty, and I have been his Wife Fifteen Years. How happen'd it, you never communicated your Diſtreſs in all this Time to your Friends and Relations? She anſwered, He has been thus but a Fortnight. I am the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0397200201:151"/>
moſt ſerious Man in the World to look at, and yet could not forbear laughing out. Why, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, in caſe of Infirmity, which proceeds on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Age, the Law gives no Remedy. Sir, ſaid ſhe, I find you have no more Learning that Dr. <hi>Caſe;</hi> and I am told of a young Man, not Five and Twenty, juſt come from <hi>Oxford,</hi> to whom I will communicate this whole Matter, and doubt not but he will appear to have Seven Times more uſeful and ſatisfactory Knowledge than you and all your boaſted Family. Thus I have entirely loſt my Client: But if this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Narrative preſerves <hi>Paſtorella</hi> from the intended Marriage with one Twenty Years her Senior—To ſave a Fine Lady, I am content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have my Learning decry'd, and my <hi>Predictions</hi> bound up with <hi>Poor Robin</hi>'s <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacks.</hi>

               <p>This Evening was acted, <hi>The Recruiting Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,</hi> in which Mr. <hi>Eſtcourt</hi>'s proper Senſe and Obſervation is what ſupports the Play. There is not, in my humble Opinion, the Humour hit in <hi>Serjeant Kite;</hi> but it is admirably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by his Action. If I have Skill to judge, that Man is an excellent Actor; but the Crowd of the Audience are fitter for Repreſentations at <hi>May-Fair,</hi> than a <hi>Theatre-Royal.</hi> Yet that Fair is now broke, as well as the <hi>Theatre</hi> is breaking: But it is allowed ſtill to ſell Animals there. Therefore, if any Lady or Gentleman have Occaſion for a tame Elephant, let them enquire of Mr. <hi>Penkethman,</hi> who has one to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of at a reaſonable Rate. The Downfal of <hi>May-Fair</hi> has quite ſunk the Price of this noble Creature, as well as of many other Curioſities of Nature. A Tyger will ſell almoſt as cheap as an Ox; and I am credibly informed, a Man may purchaſe a Cat with Three Legs, for very
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0397200201:152"/>
near the Value of one with Four. I hear like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, That there is a great Deſolation among the Gentlemen and Ladies who were the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the Town, and uſed to ſhine in Plumes and Diadems; the Heroes being moſt of them preſs'd, and the Queens beating Hemp, Mrs. <hi>Sarabrand,</hi> ſo famous for her ingenious Puppet-Show, has ſet up a Shop in the <hi>Exchange,</hi> where ſhe ſells her little Troop under the Term of Jointed-Babies. I could not but be ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to know of her, how ſhe had diſpoſed of that Rake-hell <hi>Punch,</hi> whoſe lewd Life and Converſation had given ſo much Scandal, and did not a little contribute to the Ruin of the Fair. She told me, with a Sigh, That deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ever reclaiming him, ſhe would not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to place him in a Civil Family, but got him in a Poſt upon a Stall in <hi>Wapping,</hi> where he may be ſeen from Sun-riſing to Sun-ſetting, with a Glaſs in one Hand, and a Pipe in the other, as Centry to a Brandy-Shop. The great Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Nature bring to my Mind the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes of the unfortunate <hi>Camilla,</hi> who has had the ill Luck to break before her Voice, and to diſappear at a Time when her Beauty was in the Heighth of its Bloom. This Lady enter'd ſo throughly into the great Characters ſhe act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that when ſhe had finiſhed her Part, ſhe could not think of retrenching her Equipage, but would appear in her own Lodgings with the ſame Magnificence that ſhe did upon the Stage. This Greatneſs of Soul has reduced that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Princeſs to an involuntary Retirement, where ſhe now paſſes her Time among the Woods and Forreſts, thinking on the Crowns and Scepters ſhe has loſt, and often humming over in her Solitude,

The Trade between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> ſhall be ſettled upon the ſame Foundation as in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second.</p>

               <p>A Gentleman has writ to me out of the Country a very civil Letter, and ſaid Things which I ſuppreſs with great Violence to my Vanity. There are many Terms in my Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives which he complains want explaining, and has therefore deſired, that, for the Benefit of my Country Readers, I would let him know what I mean by a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> a <hi>Pretty-Fellow,</hi> a <hi>Toaſt,</hi> a <hi>Coquet,</hi> a <hi>Critick,</hi> a <hi>Wit,</hi> and all other Appellations of thoſe in the gayer World, who are in Poſſeſſion of theſe ſeveral Characters; together with an Account of thoſe who unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately pretend to 'em. I ſhall begin with him we uſually call a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> or Man of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p>It is generally thought, That Warmth of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, quick Reliſh of Pleaſure, and a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of becoming it, are the moſt eſſential Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for forming this Sort of Man. But any one that is much in Company will obſerve, that the Height of good Breeding is ſhown rather in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver giving Offence, than in doing obliging Things. Thus he that never Shocks you, tho' he is ſeldom entertaining, is more likely to keep your Favour, than he who often entertains, and ſometimes diſpleaſes you. The moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Talent therefore in a Man of Converſation, which is what we ordinarily intend by a Fine Gentleman, is a good Judgment. He that has this in Perfection, is Maſter of his Companion, without letting him ſee it; and has the ſame Advantage over Men of any other Qualifications whatſoever, as one that can ſee would have over a blind Man of Ten times his Strength.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0397200201:157"/>
This is what makes <hi>Sophronius</hi> the Darling of all who converſe with him, and the moſt Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with his Acquaintance of any Man in Town. By the Light of this Faculty, he acts with great Eaſe and Freedom among the Men of Pleaſure, and acquits himſelf with Skill and Diſpatch among the Men of Buſineſs. All which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms with ſuch Succeſs, that, with as much Diſcretion in Life as any Man ever had, he neither is, nor appears Cunning. But as he does a good Office, if he ever does it, with Readineſs and Alacrity; ſo he denies what he does not care to engage in, in a Manner that convinces you, that you ought not to have asked it. His Judgment is ſo good and unerring, and accompanied with ſo chearful a Spirit, that his Converſation is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Feaſt, at which he helps ſome, and is helped by others, in ſuch a Manner, that the Equality of Society is perfectly kept up, and every Man obliges as much as he is obliged: For it is the greateſt and juſteſt Skill in a Man of Superior Underſtanding, to know how to be on a Level with his Companions. This ſweet Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition runs through all the Actions of <hi>Sophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and make his Company deſired by Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, without being envied by Men. <hi>Sophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> would be as juſt as he is, if there were no Law; and would be as diſcreet as he is, if there were no ſuch Thing as Calumny.</p>
               <p>In Imitation of this agreeable Being, is made that Animal we call a <hi>Pretty Fellow;</hi> who being juſt able to find out, that what makes <hi>Sophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> acceptable, is a Natural Behaviour; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the ſame Reputation, makes his own an Artificial one. <hi>Jack Dimple</hi> is his perfect Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick, whereby he is of Courſe the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like him of all Men living. <hi>Sophronius</hi> juſt now paſſed into the inner Room directly forward: <hi>Jack</hi> comes as faſt after as he can for the Right
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0397200201:158"/>
and Left Looking-glaſs, in which he had but juſt approved himſelf by a Nod at each, and marched on. He will meditate within for Half an Hour, till he thinks he is not careleſs enough in his Air, and come back to the Mirror to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect his Forgetfulneſs.</p>

               <p>This Night was acted the Comedy, called, <hi>The Fox;</hi> but I wonder the Modern Writers do not uſe their Intereſt in the Houſe to ſuppreſs ſuch Repreſentations. A Man that has been at this, will ha dly like any other Play during the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Therefore I humbly move, That the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as well as Dreſſes, of the laſt Age, ſhould give Way to the preſent Faſhion. We are come into a good Method enough (if we were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted in our Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th by ſuch an Apparition as a Play of <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s) to be entertained at more Eaſe, both to the Spectator and the Writer, than in the Days of Old. It is no Difficulty to get Hats, and Swords, and Wigs, and Shooes, and every Thing elſe, from the Shops in Town, and make a Man ſhow himſelf by his Habit, without more ado, to be a Counſellor, a Fop, a Courtier, or a Citizen, and not be obliged to make thoſe Characters talk in different Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects to be diſtinguiſhed from each other. This is certainly the ſureſt and beſt Way of Writing: But ſuch a Play as this makes a Man for a Month after over-run with Criticiſm, and enquire, <hi>What every Man on the Stage ſaid? What had ſuch a one to do to meddle with ſuch a Thing? How came t'other, who was bred after this or that Manner, to ſpeak ſo like a Man converſant among a different People?</hi> Theſe Queſtions rob us of all our Pleaſure; for at this Rate, no Sentence in a Play ſhould be ſpoken by any one Character which could poſſibly enter into the Head of any other Man repreſented in it; but
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0397200201:159"/>
every Sentiment ſhould be peculiar to him only who utters it. Laborious <hi>Ben</hi>'s Works will bear this Sort of Inquiſition; but if the preſent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were thus examined, and the Offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Rule cut out, few Plays would be long enough for the whole Evening's Entertainment.</p>
               <p>But I don't know how they did in thoſe old Times: This ſame <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> has made every one's Paſſion in this Play be towards Money, and yet not one of them expreſſes that Deſire, or endeavour to obtain it any Way but what is peculiar to him only: One ſacrifices his Wife, another his Profeſſion, another his Poſterity, from the ſame Motive; but their Characters are kept ſo skilfully apart, that it ſeems prodigious their Diſcourſes ſhould riſe from the Intention of the ſame Author.</p>
               <p>But the Poets are a Neſt of Hornets, and I'll drive theſe Thoughts no farther, but muſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſome hard Treatment I am like to meet with from my Brother Writers. I am credibly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Author of a Play, call'd, <hi>Love in a Hollow Tree,</hi> has made ſome Remarks upon my late Diſcourſe on <hi>The Naked Truth.</hi> I cannot blame a Gentleman for writing againſt any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; it is for the Good of the learned World. But I would have the Thing fairly left between us Two, and not under the Protection of Patrons. But my Intelligence is, that he has dedicated his Treatiſe to the Honourable Mr. <hi>Edw—d H—rd.</hi>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0397200201:160"/>
relating to your ſelf, wherein you foretold your own Death would happen on the 17th Inſtant, unleſs it were prevented by the Aſſiſtance of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed People: I have therefore prevailed on my own Modeſty to ſend you a Piece of News, which may ſerve inſtead of <hi>Goddard's Drops,</hi> to keep you alive for Two Days, till Nature be able to recover it ſelf, or till you meet with ſome beteer Help from other Hands. Therefore, without further Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, I will go on to relate a ſingular Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture juſt happened in the Place where I am wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, wherein it may be highly uſeful for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to be informed.</p>
                     <p>Three young Ladies of our Town were on <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> laſt indicted for <hi>Witchcraft.</hi> The Witneſſes againſt the Firſt depoſed upon Oath before Juſtice <hi>Bindover,</hi> That ſhe kept Spirits locked up in Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which ſometimes appeared in Flames of blue Fire; That ſhe uſed Magical Herbs, with ſome of which ſhe drew in Hundreds of Men daily to her, who went out from her Preſence all inflamed, their Mouths parched, and a hot Steam iſſuing from them, attended with a grievous Stench; That many of the ſaid Men were by the Force of that Herb metamorphoſed into Swine, and lay wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Kennels for Twenty four Hours, before they could reaſſume their Shapes or their Senſes.</p>
                     <p>It was proved againſt the Second, That ſhe cut off by Night the Limbs from dead Bodies that were hanged, and were ſeen to dig Holes in the Ground, to mutter ſome conjuring Words, and bury Pieces of the Fleſh, after the uſual Manner of Witches.</p>
                     <p>The Third was accuſed for a notorious Piece of Sorcery, long practiſed by Hags, of moulding up Pieces of Dough into the Shapes of Men, Women and Children; then heating them at a gentle Fire, which had a Sympathetick Power to torment the Bowels of thoſe in the Neighbourhood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0397200201:161"/>
This was the Sum of what was objected againſt the Three Ladies, who indeed had nothing to ſay in their own Defence, but downright denying the Facts, which is like to avail very little when they come upon their Trials.</p>
                     <p>But the Parſon of our Pariſh, a ſtrange refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man, will believe nothing of all this; ſo that the whole Town cries out, <hi>Shame! That one of his Coat ſhould be ſuch an Atheiſt?</hi> And deſign to complain of him to the Biſhop. He goes about very odly to ſolve the Matter. He ſuppoſes, That the Firſt of theſe Ladies keeping a Brandy and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco Shop, the Fellows went out ſmoaking, and got drunk towards Evening, and made themſelves Beaſts. He ſays, The Second is a Butcher's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſometimes brings a Quarter of Mutton from the Slaughter-houſe over Night againſt a Market-Day, and once buried a Bit of Beef in the Ground, as a known Receipt to cure Warts on her Hands. The Parſon affirms, That the Third ſells Gingerbread, which, to pleaſe the Children, ſhe is forced to ſtamp with Images before 'tis baked; and if it burns their Guts, 'tis becauſe they eat too much, or do not drink after it.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Anſwers he gives to ſolve theſe wonderful <hi>Phaenomena;</hi> upon which I ſhall not animaavert, but leave it among Philoſophers: And ſo wiſhing you all Succeſs in your Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings for the Amendment of the World, I remain,</p>

I believe your Death, which you foretold would happen on the 17th Inſtant, will fall out the ſame Way, and that your Diſtemper hath already ſeiz'd on you, and makes Progreſs daily. The lower Part of you, that is, the <hi>Advertiſements,</hi> is dead; and theſe have riſen for theſe Ten Days laſt paſt, ſo that they now take up almoſt a whole Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph. Pray, Sir, do your Endeavour to drive this Diſtemper as much as poſſible to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Parts, and keep it there, as wiſe Folks do the Gout; for if it once gets into your Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, it will ſoon fly up into your Head, and you are a dead Man.</p>

               <p>I Came hither this Evening to ſee Faſhions, and who ſhould I firſt encounter but my old Friend <hi>Cynthio</hi> (encompaſſed by a Crowd of young Fellows) dictating on the Paſſion of Love with the gayeſt Air imaginable. <q rend="inline">'Well, ſays he, as to what I know of the Matter, there is nothing but Ogling with Skill carries a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but indeed it is not every Fool that is capable of this Art: You will find Twenty can ſpeak eloquently, Fifty can fight man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and a Thouſand that can dreſs gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teely at a Miſtreſs, where there is one that can gaze skilfully. This requires an exquiſite Judgment, to take the Language of her Eyes to yours exactly, and not let yours talk too faſt for hers; as at a Play between the Acts, when Beau <hi>Frisk</hi> ſtands upon a Bench full in <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi>'s Face, and her dear Eyes are ſearching round to avoid that flaring open Fool; ſhe meets the watchful Glance of her true Lover, and ſees his Heart attentive on her Charms, and waiting for a ſecond Twincle of her Eye for its next Motion. Here the good Company ſneer'd; but he goes on. Nor is this Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance a Slavery, when a Man meets Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and her Eye comes often in his Way: For, after an Evening ſo ſpent, and the Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of Four or Five ſignificant Looks at him, the happy Man goes Home to his Lodging, full of Ten thouſand pleaſing Images: His Brain is dilated, and gives him all the Idea's and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects which it ever lets in to its Seat of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0397200201:166"/>
Thus a kind Look from <hi>Lindamira</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives in his Imagination all the Beauteous Launs, Green Fields, Woods, Foreſts, Rivers, and Solitudes, which he had ever before ſeen in Picture, Deſcription, or Real Life: And all with this Addition, That he now ſees 'em with the Eyes of an happy Lover, as before only with thoſe of a common Man. You laugh, Gentlemen: But conſider your ſelves, (you common People that were never in Love) and compare your ſelves in good Humour with your ſelves out of Humour, and you will then acknowledge, that all External Objects affect you according to the Diſpoſition you are in to receive their Impreſſions, and not as thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are in their own Nature. How much more ſhall all that paſſes within his View and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, touch with Delight a Man who is prepoſſeſs'd with ſucceſsful Love, which is an Aſſemblage of ſoft Affections, gay Deſires, and hopeful Reſolutions?'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Cynthio</hi> went on at this Rate to the Crowd about him, without any Purpoſe in his Talk, but to vent an Heart overflowing with Senſe of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. I wondered what could exalt him from the Diſtreſs in which he had long appear'd, to ſo much Alacrity. But my Familiar has given me the State of his Affairs. It ſeems then, that lately coming out of the Play-houſe, his Miſtreſs, who knows he is in her Livery, as the Manner of inſolent Beauties, is reſolved to keep him ſtill ſo, and gave him ſo much Wages, as to complain to him of the Crowd ſhe was to paſs through. He had his Wits and Reſolution enough about him to take her Hand, and ſay, He would attend her to her Coach. All the Way thither, my good young Man ſtammer'd at every Word, and ſtumbled at every Step. His Miſtreſs, wonderfully pleaſed with her Triumph, put him to a Thouſand Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0397200201:167"/>

to make a Man of his natural Wit ſpeak with Heſitation, and let drop her Fan, to ſee him recover it aukwardly. This is the whole Foundation of <hi>Cynthio</hi>'s Recovery to the ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Air he appears with at preſent.</p>
               <p>I grew mighty curious to know ſomething more of that Lady's Affairs, as being amaz'd how ſhe could dally with an Offer of one of his Merit and Fortune. I ſent <hi>Pacolet</hi> to her Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, who immediately brought me back the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Letter to her Friend and Confident <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda</hi> in the Country, wherein ſhe has open'd her Heart and all its Folds.</p>

                     <p>THE Town grows ſo empty, that you muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect my Letter ſo too, except you will allow me to talk of my ſelf inſtead of others: You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine what Pain it is, after a whole Day ſpent in Publick, to want your Company, and the Eaſe which Friendſhip allows in being vain to each other, and ſpeaking all our Minds. An Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Slaughter which theſe unhappy Eyes have made within Ten Days laſt paſt, would make me appear too great a Tyrant to be allowed in a Chriſtian Country. I ſhall therefore confine my ſelf to my Principal Conqueſts, which are the Hearts of Beau <hi>Frisk,</hi> and <hi>Jack Freeland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Cynthio,</hi> who, you know, wore my Fetters before you went out of Town. Shall I tell you my Weakneſs? I begin to love <hi>Frisk:</hi> It is the beſt humoured Impertinent Thing in the World: He is always too in waiting, and will certainly carry me off one Time or other. <hi>Freeland</hi>'s Father and mine have been upon Treaty without conſulting me; and <hi>Cynthio</hi> has been eternally watching my Eyes, without approaching me, my Friends, my Maid, or any one about me: He hopes to get me, I believe, as they ſay the Rattle Snake does
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0397200201:170"/>
the Squirrel, by ſtaring at me till I drop into his Mouth. <hi>Freeland</hi> demands me for a Jointure which he thinks deſerves me; <hi>Cynthio</hi> thinks nothing high enough to be my Value: <hi>Freeland</hi> therefore will take it for no Obligation to have me; and <hi>Cynthio</hi>'s Idea of me, is what will vaniſh by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me better. Familiarity will equally turn the Veneration of the one, and the Indifference of the other, into Contempt. I will ſtick therefore to my old Maxim, To have that Sort of Man, who can have no greater Views than what are in my Power to give him Poſſeſſion of. The utmoſt of my Dear <hi>Frisk</hi>'s Ambition is, to be thought a Man of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion; and therefore has been ſo much in Mode, as to reſolve upon me, becauſe the whole Town likes me. Thus I chooſe rather a Man who loves me becauſe others do, than one who approves me on his own Judgment. He that judges for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Love, will often change his Opinion; but he that follows the Senſe of others, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, as long as a Woman can make Advances. The Viſits I make, the Entertainments I give, and the Addreſſes I receive, will be all Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for me with a Man of <hi>Frisk</hi>'s ſecond-hand Genius; but would be ſo many Bars to my Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs with any other Man. However, ſince <hi>Frisk</hi> can wait, I ſhall enjoy a Summer or Two longer, and remain a ſingle Woman, in the ſublime Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of being followed and admired; which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can equal, except that of being beloved by you.</p>

               <p>My chief Buſineſs here this Evening was to ſpeak to my Friends in Behalf of honeſt <hi>Cave Underhill,</hi> who has been a Comick for Three Generations: My Father admired him extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he was a Boy. There is certainly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0397200201:171"/>
excellently repreſented in his Manner of Action; in which he ever avoided that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Fault in Players, of doing too much. It muſt be confeſs'd, he has not the Merit of ſome ingenious Perſons now on the Stage, of adding to his Authors; for the Actors were ſo dull in the laſt Age, that many of them have gone out of the World, without having ever ſpoke one Word of their own in the Theatre. Poor <hi>Cave</hi> is ſo mortified, that he quibbles, and tells you, he pretends only to act a Part fit for a Man who has one Foot in the Grave; <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Grave-dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> All Admirers of true Comedy, it is hop'd, will have the Gratitude to be preſent on the laſt Day of his Acting, who, if he does not happen to pleaſe them, will have it even then to ſay, That it is his firſt Offence.</p>
               <p>But there is a Gentleman here, who ſays he has it from good Hands, that there is actually a Subſcription made by many Perſons of Wit and Quality, for the Encouragement of new Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. This Deſign will very much contribute to the Improvement and Diverſion of the Town: But as every Man is moſt concerned for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I, who am of a <hi>Saturnine</hi> and Melancholy Complexion, cannot but murmur, that there is not an equal Invitation to write Tragedies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by me, in my Book of Common Places, enough to enable me to finiſh a very Sad one by the Fifth of the next Month. I have the Farewell of a General, with a Truncheon in his Hand, dying for Love, in Six Lines. I have the Principles of a Politician, (who does all the Miſchief in the Play,) together with his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on the Vanity of Ambition in his laſt Moments, expreſs'd in a Page and an half. I have all my Oaths ready, and my Similies want nothing but Application. I won't pretend to give you an Account of the Plot, it being the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0397200201:172"/>
ſame Deſign upon which all Tragedies have been writ for ſeveral Years laſt paſt; and from the Beginning of the Firſt Scene, the Frequenters of the Houſe may know, as well as the Author, when the Battle is to be fought, the Lady to yield, and the Hero proceed to his Wedding and Coronation. Beſides theſe Advantages which I have in Readineſs, I have an eminent Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian very much my Friend, who ſhall come in, and go through the whole Five Acts, without troubling me for one Sentence, whether he is to kill or be killed, love or be loved, win Battles or loſe them, or whatever other Tragical Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance I ſhall pleaſe to aſſign him.</p>

               <p>I have this Day received a Letter, ſubſcribed <hi>Fidelia,</hi> that gives me an Account of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment under which a young Lady ſuffers, and deſires my Help to exorciſe her from the Power of the Sorcerer. Her Lover is a Rake of Sixty; the Lady a virtuous Woman of Twenty five: Her Relations are to the laſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree afflicted, and amazed at this irregular Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Their Sorrow I know not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, but can their Aſtoniſhment; for there is no Spirit in Woman half ſo prevalent as that of Contradiction, which is the ſole Cauſe of her Perſeverance. Let the whole Family go dreſs'd in a Body, and call the Bride to Morrow Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her Nuptials, and I'll undertake, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant will forget her Lover in the midſt of all his Aches.

               <p>THE Generality of Mankind are ſo very fond of this World, and of ſtaying in it, that a Man cannot have eminent Skill in any one Art, but they will, in Spite of his Teeth, make him a Phyſician alſo, that being the Science the Worldings have moſt need of. I pretended, when I firſt ſet up, to Aſtrology only; but I am told, I have deep Skill alſo in Medecine. I am applied to now by a Gentleman for my Advice in Behalf of his Wife, who, upon the leaſt Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Difficulty, is exceſſively troubled with Fits, and can bear no Manner of Paſſion without falling into immediate Convulſions. I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, it is a Caſe I have known before, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Party was recovered by certain Words pronounced in the midſt of the Fit, by the Learned Doctor who performed the Cure. Theſe Ails have uſually their Beginning from the Affections of the Mind: Therefore you muſt have Patience to let me give you an Inſtance, whereby you may diſcern the Cauſe of the Diſtemper, and then proceed in the Cure as follows:</p>
               <p>A fine Town Lady was married to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of ancient Deſcent in one of the Counties
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0397200201:174"/>
of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who had good Humour to a Weakneſs, and was that Sort of Perſon, of whom it is uſually ſaid, He is no Man's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my but his own: One who had too much Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of Soul to have any Authority with his Wife; and ſhe too little Senſe to give him Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for that Reaſon. His kind Wife obſerved this Temper in him, and made proper Uſe of it. But knowing it was below a Gentlewoman to wrangle, ſhe reſolved upon an Expedient to ſave Decorum, and wear her Dear to her Point at the ſame Time. She therefore took upon her to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern him, by falling into Fits whenever ſhe was repulſed in a Requeſt, or contradicted in a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. It was a Fiſh-Day, when in the midſt of her Husband's good Humour at Table, ſhe bethought her ſelf to try her Project. She made Signs that ſhe had ſwallowed a Bone. The Man grew pale as Aſhes, and ran to her Aſſiſtance, calling for Drink. No, my Dear, ſaid ſhe, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, It is down; don't be frightened. This Accident betrayed his Softneſs enough. The next Day ſhe complained, a Lady's Chariot, whoſe Husband had not half his Eſtate, had a Crane-Neck, and hung with twice the Air that hers did. He anſwered, Madam, You know my Income, you know I have loſt Two Coach-Horſes this Spring.—Down ſhe fell.—<hi>Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn!</hi> Betty, Suſan, Alice, <hi>throw Water in her Face.</hi> With much Care and Pains ſhe was at laſt brought to her ſelf, and the Vehicle in which ſhe viſited was amended in the niceſt Manner, to prevent Relapſes; but they frequently happen'd during that Husband's whole Life, which he had the good Fortune to end in few Years after. The Diſconſolate ſoon pitched upon a very agreeable Succeſſor, whom ſhe very prudently deſigned to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by the ſame Method. This Man knew her little Arts, and reſolved to break through all
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0397200201:175"/>
Tenderneſs, and be abſolute Maſter, as ſoon as Occaſion offered. One Day it happened, that a Diſcourſe aroſe about Furniture: He was very glad of the Occaſion, and fell into an Invective againſt <hi>China,</hi> proteſting, he would never let Five Pounds more of his Money be laid out that Way as long as he breathed. She immediately fainted—He ſtarts up as amaz'd, and calls for Help—The Maids ran to the Cloſet—He chafes her Face, bends her forwards, and beats the Palms of her Hands: Her Convulſions increaſe, and down ſhe tumbles on the Floor, where ſhe lies quite dead, in Spight of what the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, from the Nurſery to the Kitchin, could do for her Relief.</p>
               <p>While every Servant was thus helping or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting their Miſtreſs, he, fixing his Cheek to hers, ſeemed to be following her in a Trance of Sorrow; but ſecretly whiſpers her, <hi>My Dear, This will never do: What is within my Power and Fortune, you may always command, but none of your Artifices: You are quite in other Hands than thoſe you paſſed theſe pretty Paſſions upon.</hi> This made her almoſt in the Condition ſhe pretended; her Convulſions now come thicker, nor was ſhe to be held down. The kind Man doubles his Care, helps the Servants to throw Water in her Face by full Quarts; and when the ſinking Part of the Fit came again, <hi>Well, my Dear,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I applaud your Action; but I muſt take my Leave of you till you are more ſincere with me. Farewell for ever: You ſhall always know where to hear of me, and want for nothing.</hi> With that, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Maids to keep plying her with Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, while he went for a Phyſician: He was ſcarce at the Stair-head when ſhe followed, and pulling him into a Cloſet, thank'd him for her Cure; which was ſo abſolute, that ſhe gave me this Relation her ſelf, to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0397200201:176"/>

               <p>They write from the <hi>Hague</hi> of the 7th, That Monſieur <hi>Rouille</hi> had received Orders from the Court of <hi>France,</hi> to ſignify to the States-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and the Miniſters of the High Allies, That the King could not conſent to the Preliminaries of a Treaty of Peace, as it was offered to him by Monſieur <hi>Torcy.</hi> The great Difficulty is the Buſineſs of <hi>Spain,</hi> on which Particular his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſeemed only to ſay, during the Treaty, that it was not ſo immediately under their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Direction, as that he could engage for its being relinquiſhed by the Duke of <hi>Anjou:</hi> But now he poſitively anſwers, That he cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with what his Miniſter has promiſed in his Behalf, even in ſuch Points as are wholly in himſelf to act in or not.

                     <p>THE ſurpriſing News which arrived this Day, of your Majeſty's having refuſed to ſign the Treaty your Miniſters have in a Manner ſued for, is what gives Ground to this Application to your Majeſty, from one whoſe Name, perhaps, is too obſcure to have ever reached your Territories; but one, who with all the <hi>European</hi> World, is affected with your Determinations. Therefore,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0397200201:178"/>
as it is mine and the common Cauſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, I preſume to expoſtulate with you on this Occaſion. It will, I doubt not, appear to the Vulgar extravagant, that the Actions of a mighty Prince ſhould be ballanced by the Cenſure of a private Man, whoſe Approbation or Diſlike are equally contemptible in their Eyes, when they regard the Thrones of Sovereigns. But your Majeſty has ſhown, through the whole Courſe of your Reign, too great a Value for Liberal Arts to be inſenſible, that true Fame lies only in the Hands of Learned Men, by whom it is to be tranſmitted to Futurity, with Marks of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Reproach to the End of Time. The Date of Humane Life is too ſhort to recompence the Cares which attend the moſt private Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Therefore it is, that our Souls are made as it were too big for it, and extend themſelves in the Proſpect of a longer Exiſtence, in a good Fame and Memory of worthy Actions after our Deceaſe. The whole Race of Men have this Paſſion in ſome Degree implanted in their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, which is the ſtrongeſt and nobleſt Incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to honeſt Attempts: But the baſe Uſe of the Arts of Peace, Eloquence, Poetry, and all the Parts of Learning, have been poſſeſſed by Souls ſo unworthy thoſe Faculties, that the Names and Appellations of Things have been confounded by the Labours and Writings of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Men, who have ſtamp'd a Reputation upon ſuch Actions, as are in themſelves the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Contempt and Diſgrace. This is that which has miſled your Majeſty in the Conduct of your Reign, and made that Life, which might have been the moſt imitable, the moſt to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided. To this it is, that the great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Qualities of which your Majeſty is Maſter, are loſt in their Application; and your Majeſty has been carrying on for many Years the moſt
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0397200201:179"/>
cruel Tyranny, with all the noble Methods which are uſed to ſupport a juſt Reign. Thus it is, that it avails nothing that you are a Bountiful Maſter; that you are ſo Generous as to reward even the Unſucceſsful with Honour and Riches; that no laudable Action paſſes unrewarded in your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; that you have ſearched all Nations for obſcure Merit. In a Word, that you are in your private Character endowed with every Princely Quality, when all this is ſubjected to unjuſt and ill-taught Ambition, which to the Injury of the World, is gilded by thoſe Endowments. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if your Majeſty will condeſcend to look into your own Soul, and conſider all its Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Weakneſſes with Impartiality; if you will but be convinced, that Life is ſupported in you by the ordinary Methods of Food, Reſt, and Sleep; you would think it impoſſible that you could ever be ſo much impoſed on, as to have been wrought into a Belief, that ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the ſame Make with your ſelf were formed by Providence for no other End, but by the Hazard of their very Being to extend the Conqueſts and Glory of an Individual of their own Species. A very little Reflection will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince your Majeſty, that ſuch cannot be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Creator; and if not, What Horror muſt it give your Majeſty to think of the vaſt Devaſtations your Ambition has made among your Fellow-Creatures? While the Warmth of Youth, the Flattery of Crowds, and a continual Series of Succeſs and Triumph, indulged your Majeſty in this Alluſion of Mind, it was leſs to be wondered at, that you proceeded in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken Purſuit of Grandeur; but when Age, Diſappointments, Publick Calamities, Perſonal Diſtempers, and the Reverſe of all that makes Men forget their true Being, are fallen upon you: Heavens! Is it poſſible you can live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Remorſe? Can the wretched Man be a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant? Can Grief ſtudy Torments? Can Sorrow be Cruel?—</p>
                     <p>Your Majeſty will obſerve, I do not bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you a railing Accuſation; but as you are a ſtrict Profeſſor of Religion, I beſeech your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to ſtop the Effuſion of Blood, by receiving the Opportunity which preſents it ſelf, for the Preſervation of your diſtreſſed People. Be no longer ſo infatuated, as to hope for Renown from Murder and Violence: But conſider, that the Great Day will come, in which this World and all its Glory ſhall change in a Moment: When Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall ſicken, and the Earth and Sea give up the Bodies committed to them, to appear before the laſt Tribunal. Will it then, Oh King! be an Anſwer for the Lives of Millions who have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len by the Sword? <hi>They periſhed for my Glory.</hi> That Day will come on, and one like it is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately approaching: Injur'd Nations advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thy Habitation: Vengeance has began its March, which is to be diverted only by the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Oppreſſor.

               <p>IN my Paper of the 28th of the laſt Month, I mentioned ſeveral Characters which want Explanation to the Generality of Readers: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, I ſpoke of a Pretty Fellow. I have ſince received a kind Admonition in a Letter, to take Care that I do not omit to ſhow alſo what is meant by a <hi>very</hi> Pretty Fellow, which is to be allowed as a Character by it ſelf, and a Perſon exalted above the other by a peculiar Sprightli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as one who, by a diſtinguiſhing Vigour, outſtrips his Companions, and has thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and obtained a particular Appellation, or Nick-name of Familiarity. Some have this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from the Fair Sex, who are ſo generous as to take into their Protection ſuch as are laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by the Men, and place them for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Degrees of Favour.</p>
               <p>The chief of this Sort is Colonel <hi>Brunett,</hi> who is a Man of Faſhion, becauſe he will be ſo; and practiſes a very janty Way of Behaviour, becauſe he is too careleſs to know when he offends, and too ſanguine to be mortified if he did know it. Thus the Colonel has met with a Town ready to receive him, and cannot poſſibly ſee why he ſhould not make uſe of their Favour, and ſet himſelf in the Firſt Degree of Converſation. Therefore he is very ſucceſsfully loud among the Wits, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar among the Ladies, and diſſolute among the Rakes. Thus he is admitted in one Place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is ſo in another; and every Man treats <hi>Brunett</hi> well, not out of his particular Eſteem
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0397200201:182"/>
for him, but in Reſpect to the Opinion of others. It is to me a ſolid Pleaſure to ſee the World thus miſtaken on the good-natur'd Side; for 'tis Ten to One but the Colonel mounts into a General Officer, marries a fine Lady, and is Maſter of a good Eſtate, before they come to explain upon him. What gives moſt Delight to me in this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, is, that all this ariſes from pure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Colonel can account for his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs no more than thoſe by whom he ſucceeds. For theſe Cauſes and Conſiderations, I pronounce him a true Woman's Man, and in the firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <hi>A very pretty Fellow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next to a Man of this univerſal Genius, is one who is peculiarly formed for the Service of the Ladies, and his Merit chiefly is to be of no Conſequence. I am indeed a little in Doubt, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ought not rather to be called a <hi>very Happy,</hi> than a <hi>very Pretty</hi> Fellow? For he is admitted at all Hours: All he ſays or does, which would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in another, are paſſed over in him; and all Actions and Speeches which pleaſe, doubly pleaſe if they come from him: No one wonders or takes Notice when he's wrong; but all admire him when he's in the Right.—By the Way it is fit to remark, That there are People of better Senſe than theſe, who endeavour at this Character; but they are out of Nature; and tho', with ſome Induſtry, they get the Characters of Fools, they cannot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to be <hi>very,</hi> ſeldom to be meerly <hi>Pretty Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</hi> But where Nature has formed a Perſon for this Station amongſt Men, he is gifted with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Genius for Succeſs, and his very Errors and Abſurdities contribute to it; this Felicity attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to his Life's End. For it being in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner neceſſary that he ſhould be of no Conſequence, he is as well in old Age as Youth; and I know a Man, whoſe Son has been ſome Years a pretty Fellow, who is himſelf at this Hour a <hi>very</hi> Pretty Fellow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0397200201:183"/>
One muſt move tenderly in this Place, for we are now in the Ladies Lodgings, and ſpeaking of ſuch as are ſupported by their Influence and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; againſt which there is not, neither ought there to be, any Diſpute or Obſervation. But when we come into more free Air, one may talk a little more at large.</p>
               <p>Give me Leave then to mention Three, whom I do not doubt but we ſhall ſee make conſiderable Figures; and theſe are ſuch as, for their <hi>Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalian</hi> Performances, muſt be admitted into this Order. They are Three Brothers lately landed from <hi>Holland:</hi> As yet, indeed, they have not made their publick Entry, but lodge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe at <hi>Wapping.</hi> They have merited already on the Water-ſide particular Titles: The Firſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hogſhead;</hi> the Second, <hi>Culverin;</hi> and the Third, <hi>Muſquet.</hi> This Fraternity is preparing for our End of the Town by their Ability in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and meaſure their Time and Merit by Liquid Weight, and Power of Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Hogſhead</hi> is a prettier Fellow than <hi>Culverin</hi> by Two Quarts, and <hi>Culverin</hi> than <hi>Muſquet</hi> by a full Pint. It is to be feared, <hi>Hogſhead</hi> is ſo often too full, and <hi>Culverin</hi> over-loaded, that <hi>Muſquet</hi> will be the only laſting <hi>very</hi> Pretty Fellow of the Three.</p>
               <p>A Third Sort of this Denomination are ſuch as, by very daring Adventures in Love, have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed to themſelves Renown and new Names; as, <hi>Jo. Carry,</hi> for his exceſſive Strength and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; <hi>Tom Drybones,</hi> for his generous Loſs of Youth and Health; and <hi>Cancrum,</hi> for his meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Rottenneſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe great and leading Spirits are propoſed to all ſuch of our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Youth as would arrive at Perfection in theſe different Kinds; and if their Parts and Accompliſhments were well imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, it is not doubted but that our Nation
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0397200201:184"/>
would ſoon excel all others it Wit and Arts, as they already do in Arms.</p>
               <p>[<hi>N. B.</hi> The Gentleman who ſtole <hi>Betty Pepin,</hi> may own it, for he is allowed to be a <hi>very</hi> Pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Fellow.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But we muſt proceed to the Explanation of other Terms in our Writings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To know what a Toaſt is in the Country, gives as much Perplexity as ſhe her ſelf does in Town: And indeed, the Learned differ very much upon the Original of this Word, and the Acceptation of it among the Moderns. However, it is by all agreed to have a joyous and chearful Import. A Toaſt in a cold Morning, heightened by Nutmeg, and ſweeten'd with Sugar, has for many Ages been given to our Rural Diſpenſers of Juſtice, before they enter'd upon Cauſes, and has been of great and politick Uſe to take off the Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Sentences; but has indeed been remarkable for one ill Effect, that it inclines thoſe who uſe it immoderately, to ſpeak <hi>Latin,</hi> to the Admiration, rather than Information, of an Audience. This Application of a Toaſt makes it very obvious, that the Word may, without a Metaphor, be underſtood as an apt Name for a Thing which raiſes us in the moſt ſovereign De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. But many of the Wits of the laſt Age will aſſert, That the Word, in its preſent Senſe, was known among them in their Youth, and had its Riſe from an Accident at the Town of <hi>Bath,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second.</p>
               <p>It happened, that on a Publick Day a celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Beauty of thoſe Times was in the <hi>Croſs Bath,</hi> and one of the Crowd of her Admirers took a Glaſs of the Water in which the Fair One ſtood, and drank her Health to the Company. There was in the Place a Gay Fellow, half fuddled, who offered to jump in, and ſwore, Tho' he liked not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0397200201:185"/>
the Liquor, he would have the Toaſt. He was oppoſed in his Reſolution; yet this Whim gave Foundation to the preſent Honour which is done to the Lady we mention in our Liquors, who has ever ſince been called a <hi>Toaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' this Inſtitution had ſo trivial a Beginning, it is now elevated into a formal Order; and that happy Virgin who is received and drank to at their Meetings, has no more to do in this Life, but to judge and accept of the firſt good Offer. The Manner of her Inauguration is much like that of the Choice of a Doge in <hi>Venice:</hi> It is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Ballotting; and when ſhe is ſo cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, ſhe reigns indiſputably for that enſuing Year; but muſt be elected anew to prolong her Empire a Moment beyond it. When ſhe is regularly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, her Name is written with a Diamond on a Drinking-glaſs. The Hieroglyphick of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond is to ſhew her, that her Value is imaginary; and that of the Glaſs to acquaint her, that her Condition is frail, and depends on the Hand which holds her. This wiſe Deſign admoniſhes her, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to over-rate or depreciate her Charms; as well conſidering and applying, that it is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the Humour and Taſte of the Company, whether the Toaſt is eaten, or left as an Offal.</p>
               <p>The Foremoſt of the whole Rank of Toaſts, and the moſt undiſputed in their preſent Empire, are Mrs. <hi>Gatty</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Frontlet:</hi> The Firſt an Agreeable, the Second an Awful Beauty. Theſe Ladies are perfect Friends, out of a Knowledge, that their Perfections are too different to ſtand in Competition. He that likes <hi>Gatty,</hi> can have no Reliſh for ſo ſolemn a Creature as <hi>Frontlet;</hi> and an Admirer of <hi>Frontlet,</hi> will call <hi>Gatty</hi> a May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole Girl. <hi>Gatty</hi> for ever ſmiles upon you; and <hi>Frontlet</hi> diſdains to ſee you ſmile. <hi>Gatty</hi>'s Love is a ſhining quick Flame; <hi>Frontlet</hi>'s a ſlow waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0397200201:186"/>
Fire. <hi>Gatty</hi> likes the Man that diverts her; <hi>Frontlet</hi> him who adores her. <hi>Gatty</hi> always im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the Soil in which ſhe travels; <hi>Frontlet</hi> lays waſte the Country. <hi>Gatty</hi> does not only ſmile, but laughs at her Lover; <hi>Frontlet</hi> not only looks ſerious, but frowns at him. All the Men of Wit, (and Coxcombs their Followers) are profeſſed Servants of <hi>Gatty:</hi> The Politicians and Pretenders give ſolemn Worſhip to <hi>Frontlet.</hi> Their Reign will be beſt judged of by its Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Frontlet</hi> will never be choſen more; and <hi>Gatty</hi> is a Toaſt for Life.</p>

               <p>A Letter from a young Lady, written in the moſt paſſionate Terms, wherein ſhe laments the Misfortune of a Gentleman, her Lover, who was lately wounded in a Duel, has turned my Thoughts to that Subject, and enclined me to examine into the Cauſes which precipitate Men into ſo fatal a Folly. And as it has been propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to treat of Subjects of Gallantry in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle from hence, and no one Point in Nature is more proper to be conſider'd by the Company who frequent this Place than that of Duels, it is worth our Conſideration to examine into this Chimaerical groundleſs Humour, and to lay every other Thought aſide, till we have ſtrip'd it of all its falſe Pretences to Credit and Reputation amongſt Men.</p>
               <p>But I muſt confeſs, when I conſider what I am going about, and run over in my Imagination all the endleſs Crowd of Men of Honour who will be offended at ſuch a Diſcourſe; I am underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, methinks, a Work worthy an invulnerable Hero in Romance, rather than a private Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with a ſingle Rapier: But as I am pretty well acquainted by great Opportunities with the Nature of Man, and know of a Truth, that all Men fight <hi>againſt their Will,</hi> the Danger vaniſhes, and Reſolution riſes upon this Subject. For this Reaſon I ſhall talk very freely on a Cuſtom which all Men wiſh exploded, though no Man has Courage enough to reſiſt it.</p>
               <p>But there is one unintelligible Word which I fear will extremely perplex my Diſſertation; and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0397200201:192"/>
I confeſs to you I find very hard to explain, which is, the Term <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> An honeſt Country Gentleman had the Misfortune to fall into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Two or Three modern Men of Honour, where he happened to be very ill treated; and one of the Company being conſcious of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſends a Note to him in the Morning, and tells him, He was ready to give him Satisfaction. This is fine Doing (ſays the plain Fellow). Laſt Night he ſent me away curſedly out of Humour, and this Morning he fancies it would be a Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to be run through the Body.</p>
               <p>As the Matter at preſent ſtands, it is not to do handſome Actions denominates a Man of Honour; it is enough if he dares to defend ill Ones. Thus you often ſee a common Sharper in Competition with a Gentleman of the firſt Rank; though all Mankind is convinced, that a fighting Gameſter is only a Pick-pocket with the Courage of an Highway-Man. One cannot with any Patience reflect on the unaccountable Jumble of Perſons and Things in this Town and Nation, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions very frequently, that a brave Man falls by a Hand below that of the common Hangman, and yet his Executioner eſcapes the Clutches of the Hangman for doing it. I ſhall therefore here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after conſider, how the braveſt Men in other Ages and Nations have behaved themſelves upon ſuch Incidents as we decide by Combat; and ſhow, from their Practice, that this Reſentment neither has its Foundation from true Reaſon, or ſolid Fame; but is an Impoſture, made up of Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, Falſhood, and Want of Underſtanding. For this Work, a good Hiſtory of Quarrels would be very edifying to the Publick, and I apply my ſelf to the Town for Particulars and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances within their Knowledge, which may ſerve to embelliſh the Diſſertation with proper Cuts. Moſt of the Quarrels I have ever known,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0397200201:193"/>
have proceeded from ſome valiant Coxcomb's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the Wrong, to defend ſome prevailing Folly, and preſerve himſelf from the Ingenuity of owning a Miſtake.</p>
               <p>By this Means it is called, <hi>Giving a Man Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> to urge your Offence againſt him with your Sword; which puts me in Mind of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Order to the Keeper, in <hi>The Tale of a Tub: If you neglect to do all this, damn you and your Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for ever; and ſo we bid you heartily fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel.</hi> If the Contradiction in the very Terms of one of our Challenges were as well explained, and turn'd into downright <hi>Engliſh,</hi> would it not run after this Manner?</p>

               <p>Among the many Employments I am neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily put upon by my Friends, that of giving Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0397200201:194"/>
is the moſt unwelcome to me; and indeed, I am forced to uſe a little Art in the Matter; for ſome People will ask Counſel of you, when they have already acted what they tell you is ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Deliberation. I had almoſt loſt a very good Friend t'other Day, who came to know how I liked his Deſign to marry ſuch a Lady. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, By no Means; and I muſt be poſitive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, for very ſolid Reaſous, which are not proper to communicate. Not proper to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate! (ſaid he with a grave Air) I will know the Bottom of this. I ſaw him moved, and knew from thence he was already determined; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evaded it by ſaying, To tell you the Truth, dear <hi>Frank,</hi> Of all Women living, I would have her my ſelf. <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſaid he, Thou art too late, for we have been both one theſe two Months.</p>
               <p>I learned this Caution by a Gentleman's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting me formerly about his Son. He railed at his damn'd Extravagance, and told me, In a very little Time, he would beggar him by the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Bills which came from <hi>Oxford</hi> every Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Make the Rogue bite upon the Bridle,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>pay none of his Bills, it will but encourage him to further Treſpaſſes.</hi> He look'd plaguy ſowr at me. His Son ſoon after ſent up a Paper of Verſes, forſooth, in Print, on the laſt publick Occaſion; upon which, he is convinced the Boy has Parts, and a Lad of Spirit is not to be too much cramp'd in his Maintenance, leſt he take ill Courſes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Father nor Son can ever ſince endure the Sight of me.</p>
               <p>Theſe Sort of People ask Opinions, only out of the Fulneſs of their Heart on the Subject of their Perplexity, and not from a Deſire of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>There is nothing ſo eaſy as to find out which Opinion the Perſon in Doubt has a Mind to; therefore the ſure Way is to tell him, that is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0397200201:195"/>
to be choſen. Then you are to be very clear and poſitive; leave no Handle for Scruple. Bleſs me! Sir, there's no Room for a Queſtion. This rivets you into his Heart; for you at once applaud his Wiſdom, and gratify his Inclination. However, I had too much Bowels to be inſincere to a Man who came Yeſterday to know of me, With which of two eminent Men in the City he ſhould place his Son? Their Names are <hi>Paulo</hi> and <hi>Avaro.</hi> This gave me much Debate with my ſelf, becauſe not only the Fortune of the Youth, but his Virtue alſo, depended upon this Choice. The Men are equally wealthy; but they differ in the Uſe and Application of their Riches, which you immediately ſee upon entring their Doors.</p>
               <p>The Habitation of <hi>Paulo</hi> has at once the Air of a Nobleman and a Merchant. You ſee the Servants act with Affection to their Maſter, and Satisfaction in themſelves: The Maſter meets you with an open Countenance, full of Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Integrity: Your Buſineſs is diſpatched with that Confidence and Welcome which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accompanies honeſt Minds: His Table is the Image of Plenty and Generoſity, ſupported by Juſtice and Frugality. After we had dined here, our Affair was to viſit <hi>Avaro:</hi> Out comes an aukward Fellow with a careful Countenance; Sir, Would you ſpeak with my Maſter? May I crave your Name? After the firſt Preambles, he leads us into a noble Solitude, a great Houſe that ſeem'd uninhabited; but from the End of the ſpacious Hall moves towards us <hi>Avaro,</hi> with a ſuſpicious Aſpect, as if he believed us Thieves; and as for my Part, I approached him as if I knew him a Cut-purſe. We fell into Diſcourſe of his noble Dwelling, and the Great Eſtate all the World knew he had to enjoy in it: And I, to plague him, fell a commending <hi>Paulo</hi>'s Way
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0397200201:196"/>
of Living. <hi>Paulo,</hi> anſwered <hi>Avaro,</hi> is a very good Man; but we who have ſmaller Eſtates, muſt cut our Coat according to our Cloth. Nay, ſays I, Every Man knows his own Circumſtance beſt; you are in the Right, if you han't where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal. He look'd very ſowr; (for it is, you muſt know, the utmoſt Vanity of a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited rich Man to be contradicted, when he calls himſelf Poor.) But I was reſolved to vex him, by conſenting to all he ſaid; the main Deſign of which was, that he would have us find out, he was one of the wealthieſt Men in <hi>London,</hi> and lived like a Beggar. We left him, and took a Turn on the Change. My Friend was raviſhed with <hi>Avaro:</hi> This (ſaid he) is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a ſure Man. I contradicted him with much Warmth, and ſummed up their different Characters as well as I could. This <hi>Paulo</hi> (ſaid I) grows wealthy by being a common Good; <hi>Avaro,</hi> by being a general Evil: <hi>Paulo</hi> has the Art, <hi>Avaro</hi> the Craft of Trade. When <hi>Paulo</hi> gains, all Men he deals with are the better: Whenever <hi>Avaro</hi> profits, another certainly loſes. In a Word, <hi>Paulo</hi> is a Citizen, and <hi>Avaro</hi> a Cit. I convinced my Friend, and carried the young Gentleman the next Day to <hi>Paulo,</hi> where he will learn the Way both to gain, and enjoy a good Fortune. And tho' I cannot ſay, I have, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from <hi>Avaro,</hi> ſaved him from the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, I have prevented his deſerving it every Day he lives: For with <hi>Paulo</hi> he will be an honeſt Man, without being ſo for Fear of the Law; as with <hi>Avaro,</hi> he would have been a Villain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Protection of it.</p>

               <p>Advices from the <hi>Hague</hi> of the 14th Inſtant, <hi>N.

But my Reaſon for troubling you at this preſent is, to put a Stop, if it may be, to an inſinuating, increaſing Set of People, who ſticking to the <hi>Letter</hi> of your Treatiſe, and not to the Spirit of it, do aſſume the Name of <hi>Pretty</hi> Fellows; nay, and even get new Names, as you very well hint. Some of them I have heard calling to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as I have ſate at <hi>White</hi>'s and St. <hi>James</hi>'s, by the Names of, <hi>Betty, Nelly,</hi> and ſo forth. You ſee them accoſt each other with effeminate Airs: They have their Signs and Tokens like Free-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: They rail at Womenkind; receive Viſits on their Beds in Gowns, and do a Thouſand other unintelligible Prettineſſes that I cannot tell what to make of. I therefore heartily deſire you would exclude all this Sort of Animals.</p>

There is another Matter I am foreſeeing an ill Conſequence from, but may be timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Prudence; which is, that for the laſt Fortnight, prodigious Shoals of Volunteers have gone over to bully the <hi>French,</hi> upon hearing the Peace was juſt ſigning; and this is ſo true, that I can aſſure you, all Ingroſſing Work about the <hi>Temple</hi> is riſen above 3 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound for want of Hands. Now as 'tis poſſible, ſome little Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Affairs may have broken their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and that they will poſt back again, I am under the laſt Apprehenſion, that theſe will, at their Return, all ſet up for <hi>Pretty Fellows,</hi> and thereby confound all Merit and Service, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on us ſome new Alteration in our Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap-Wigs and Pockets, unleſs you can provide a particular Claſs for them.

               <p>It is very odd this Prince ſhould offer to invite me into his Dominions, or believe I ſhould accept the Invitation. No, no, I remember too well how he ſerved an ingenious Gentleman, a Friend of mine, whom he locked up in the <hi>Baſtile</hi> for no Reaſon in the World, but becauſe he was a Wit, and feared he might mention him with Juſtice in ſome of his Writings. His Way is, That all Men of Senſe are preferred, baniſhed, or impriſoned. He has indeed a Sort of Juſtice in him, like that of the Gameſters; for if a Stander-by ſees one at Play cheat, he has a Right to come in for Shares, as knowing the Myſteries of the Game.</p>
               <p>This is a very wiſe and juſt Maxim; and if I have not left at Mr. <hi>Morphew</hi>'s, directed to me, Bank Bills for 200 <hi>l.</hi> on or before this Day Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, I ſhall tell how <hi>Tom Caſh</hi> got his Eſtate.

divert you with a Figure I ſaw juſt after my Death, when the Philoſopher threw me, as I told you ſome Days ago, into the Pail of Water.</p>
               <q>You are to know, That when Men leave the Body, there are Receptacles for them as ſoon as they depart, according to the Manner in which they lived and died. At the very Inſtant that I was killed, there came away with me a Spirit which had loſt its Body in a Duel. We were both examined. Me, the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly looked at with Kindneſs and Pity, but at the ſame Time with an Air of Welcome, and Conſolation: They pronounced me very happy, who had died in Innocence; and told me, a quite different Place was allotted to me, than that which was appointed for my Companion; there being a great Diſtance from the Manſions of Fools and Innocents: Tho' at the ſame Time, ſaid one of the Ghoſts, there is a great Affinity between an Idiot who has been ſo for long Life, and a Child who departs before Maturity. But this Gentleman who has arrived with you is a Fool of his own making, is ignorant out of Choice, and will fare accordingly. The Aſſembly began to flock about him, and one ſaid to him, Sir, I obſerved you came into the Gate of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons murdered, and I deſire to know, What brought you to your untimely End? He ſaid, He had been a Second. <hi>Socrates</hi> (who may be ſaid to have been murdered by the Commonwealth of <hi>Athens</hi>) ſtood by, and began to draw near him, in order, after his Manner, to lead him into a Senſe of his Error by Conceſſions in his own Diſcourſe. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid that Divine and Amicable Spirit, <hi>What was the Quarrel?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>We ſhall know very ſuddenly, when the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal in the Buſineſs comes, for he was deſperately wounded before I fell. Sir,</hi> ſaid the Sage, <hi>Had you an Eſtate? Yes, Sir,</hi> the new Gueſt anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

                  <hi>I have left it in a very good Condition, and made my Will the Night before this Occaſion.</hi> Did you read it before you ſign'd it? Yes ſure, Sir, ſaid the new Comer. <hi>Socrates</hi> replies, Could a Man, that would not give his Eſtate without reading the Inſtrument, diſpoſe of his Life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking a Queſtion? That illuſtrious Shade turned from him, and a Crowd of impertinent Goblins, who had been Droles and Paraſites in their Life-time, and were knock'd on the Head for their Sawcineſs, came about my Fellow-Traveller, and made themſelves very merry with Queſtions about the Words <hi>Cart</hi> and <hi>Terce,</hi> and other Terms of Fencers. But his Thoughts began to ſettle into Reflection upon the Adventure which had robbed him of his late Being; and with a wretched Sigh, ſaid he, <hi>How terrible are Conviction and Guilt when they come too late for Penitence!</hi>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pacolet</hi> was going on in this Strain, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from it, and told me, <q>It was too ſoon to give my Diſcourſe on this Subject ſo ſerious a Turn; you have chiefly to do with that Part of Mankind which muſt be led into Reflection by Degrees, and you muſt treat this Cuſtom with Humour and Raillery to get an Audience, before you come to pronounce Sentence upon it. There is Foundation enough for raiſing ſuch Entertainments from the Practice on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Don't you know, that often a Man is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of Bed to follow implicitly a Coxcomb (with whom he would not keep Company on any other Occaſion) to Ruin and Death?—Then a good Liſt of ſuch as are qualified by the Laws of theſe uncourteous Men of Chivalry to enter into Combat (who are often Perſons of Honour without common Honeſty): Theſe, I ſay, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and drawn up in their proper Order, would give an Averſion to doing any Thing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

with ſuch as Men laugh at and contemn.

                  <hi>PAcolet</hi> being gone a ſtrolling among the Men of the Sword, in order to find out the ſecret Cauſes of the frequent Diſputes we meet with, and furniſh me with Materials for my Treatiſe on Duelling; I have Room left to go on in my Information to my Country Readers, whereby they may underſtand the bright Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whoſe Memoirs I have taken upon me to write. But in my Diſcourſe of the 28th of the laſt Month, I omitted to mention the moſt agreeable of all bad Characters; and that is, a <hi>Rake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Rake is a Man always to be pitied; and if he lives, is one Day certainly reclaimed; for
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0397200201:206"/>
his Faults proceed not from Choice or Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but from ſtrong Paſſions and Appetites' which are in Youth too violent for the Club of Reaſon, good Senſe, good Manners, and good Nature: All which he muſt have by Nature and Education, before he can be allowed to be, or have been of this Order. He is a poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weildy Wretch, that commits Faults out of the Redundance of his good Qualities. His Pity and Compaſſion makes him ſometimes a Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all his Fellows, let 'em be never ſo much below him in Underſtanding. His Deſires run away with him through the Strength and Force of a lively Imagination, which hurries him on to unlawful Pleaſures, before Reaſon has Power to come in to his Reſcue. Thus, with all the good Intentions in the World to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, this Creature ſins on againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, himſelf, his Friends, and his Country, who all call for a better Uſe of his Talents. There is not a Being under the Sun ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as this: He goes on in a Purſuit he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſapproves, and has no Enjoyment but what is followed by Remorſe; no Relief from Remorſe, but the Repetition of his Crime. It's poſſible I may talk of this Perſon with too much Indulgence; but I muſt repeat it, that I think this, a Character which is the moſt the Object of Pity of any in the World. The Man in the Pangs of the Stone, Gout, or any acute Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, is not in ſo deplorable a Condition in the Eye of right Senſe, as he that errs and repents, and repents and errs on. The Fellow with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Limbs juſtly deſerves your Alms for his impotent Condition; but he that can't uſe his own Reaſon, is in a much worſe State; for you ſee him in miſerable Circumſtances, with his Remedy at the ſame Time in his own Poſſeſſion, if he would or could uſe it. This is the Cauſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0397200201:207"/>
that, of all ill Characters, the Rake has the beſt Quarter in the World; for when he is himſelf, and unruffled with Intemperance, you ſee his natural Faculties exert themſelves, and attract an Eye of Favour towards his Infirmities.</p>
               <p>But if we look round us here, how many dull Rogues are there, that would fain be what this poor Man hates himſelf for? All the Noiſe towards Six in the Evening, is cauſed by his Mimicks and Imitators. How ought Men of Senſe to be careful of their Actions, if it were meerly from the Indignation of ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ill drawn by ſuch little Pretenders? Not to ſay, he that leads, is guilty of all the Actions of his Followers: And a Rake has Imitators whom you would never expect ſhould prove ſo-Second-hand Vice ſure of all is the moſt nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. There is hardly a Folly more abſurd, or which ſeems leſs to be accounted for, (tho' 'tis what we ſee every Day) than that grave and honeſt Natures give into this Way, and at the ſame Time have good Senſe, if they thought fit to uſe it: But the Fatality (under which moſt Men labour) of deſiring to be what they are not, makes 'em go out of a Method, in which they might be received with Applauſe, and would certainly excel; into one, wherein they will all their Life have the Air of Strangers to what they aim at.</p>
               <p>For this Reaſon, I have not lamented the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis of any one I know ſo much as of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis,</hi> who was born with Sweetneſs of Temper, juſt Apprehenſion, and every Thing elſe that might make him a Man fit for his Order. But inſtead of the Purſuit of ſober Studies, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, in which he would certainly be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of making a conſiderable Figure in the nobleſt Aſſembly of Men in the World; I ſay, in ſpight of that good Nature, which is his proper Bent,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0397200201:208"/>
he will ſay ill-natured Things aloud, put ſuch as he was, and ſtill ſhould be, out of Countenance, and drown all the natural Good in him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an artificial ill Character, in which he will never ſucceed: For <hi>Nobilis</hi> is no Rake. He may guzzle as much Wine as he pleaſes, talk Bawdy if he thinks fit; but he may as well drink Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-gruel, and go twice a Day to Church, for it will never do. I pronounce it again, <hi>Nobilis</hi> is no Rake. To be of that Order, he muſt be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious againſt his Will, and not ſo by Study or Application. All Pretty Fellows are alſo excluded to a Man, as well as all Inamaratoes, or Perſons of the Epicene Gender, who gaze at one another in the Preſence of Ladies. This Claſs, of which I am giving you an Account, is pretended to alſo by Men of ſtrong Abilities in Drinking; tho' they are ſuch whom the Liquor, not the Converſation, keeps together. But Blockheads may roar, fight, and ſtab, and be never the nearer; their Labour is alſo loſt; they want Senſe: They are no Rakes.</p>
               <p>As a Rake among Men is the Man who lives in the conſtant Abuſe of his Reaſon, ſo a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet among Women is one who lives in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Miſapplication of her Beauty. The chief of all, whom I have the Honour to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, is pretty Mrs. <hi>Toſs:</hi> She is ever in Practice of ſomething which disfigures her, and takes from her Charms; tho' all ſhe does, tends to a contrary Effect. She has naturally a very agreeable Voice and Utterance, which ſhe has chang'd for the prettieſt Liſp imaginable. She ſees what ſhe has a Mind to ſee, at half a Mile Diſtance; but poring with her Eyes half ſhut at every one ſhe paſſes by, ſhe believes much more becoming. The <hi>Cupid</hi> on her Fan and ſhe have their Eyes full on each other, all the Time in which they are not both in Motion. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever her Eye is turned from that dear Object,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0397200201:209"/>
you may have a Glance and your Bow, if ſhe is in Humour, returned as civilly as you make it; but that muſt not be in the Preſence of a Man of greater Quality: For Mrs. <hi>Toſs</hi> is ſo throughly well bred, that the chief Perſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent has all her Regards. And ſhe, who gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles at Divine Service, and laughs at her very Mother, can compoſe her ſelf at the Approach of a Man of a good Eſtate.</p>

               <p>A fine Lady ſhewed a Gentleman of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for an eternal Anſwer to all his Addreſſes, a Paper of Verſes, with which ſhe is ſo capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, that ſhe profeſs'd, the Author ſhould be the happy Man in Spite of all other Pretenders. It is ordinary for Love to make Men Poetical, and it had that Effect on this enamour'd Man: But he was reſolved to try his Vein upon ſome of her Confidents or Retinue, before he ventured upon ſo high a Theme as her ſelf. To do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than ſo, would be like making an Heroick Poem a Man's firſt Attempt. Among the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites to the Fair One, he found her Parrat not to be in the laſt Degree: He ſaw <hi>Poll</hi> had her Ear, when his Sighs were neglected. To write againſt him, had been a fruitleſs Labour; therefore he reſolved to flatter him into his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, in the following Manner:</p>

                  <lg>
                     <head>To a Lady on her Parrat.</head>

                     <l>The Gods diſguis'd were ſeldom known to fail,</l>

                     <l>Surpriz'd the Fair, and taught her how to love.</l>

                        </gap>d quit,</l>
                     <l>For any Form which might to thee admit.</l>
                     <l>See how the wanton Bird, at every Glance,</l>
                     <l>Swells his glad Plumes, and feels an am'rous Trunce.</l>
                     <l>The Queen of Beauty has forſook the Dove,</l>
                     <l>Henceforth the Parrat be the Bird of Love.</l>
                  </lg>

It is indeed a very juſt Propoſition, to give that Honour rather to the Parrat than the other Volatile. The Parrat repreſents us in the State of making Love: The Dove in the Poſſeſſion of the Object beloved. But inſtead of turning the Dove off, I fancy it would be better if the Chaiſe of <hi>Venus</hi> had hereafter a Parrat added, (as we ſee ſometimes a Third Horſe to a Coach) which might intimate, That to be a Parrat, is the only Way to ſucceed; and to be a Dove, to preſerve your Conqueſts. If the Swain would go on ſucceſsfully, he muſt imitate the Bird he writes upon. For he who would be loved by Women, muſt never be ſilent before the Favour, or open his Lips after it.</p>

                     <p>I Deſire the Favour of you to decide this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Whether calling a Gentleman a <hi>Smart Fellow,</hi> is an Affront or not? A Youth entring a certain Coffee-houſe, with his Cane tied at his Button, wearing red-heel'd Shoes, I thought of your Deſcription, and could not forbear telling a Friend of mine next to me, There enters a Smart Fellow. The Gentleman hearing it, had immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately a Mind to pick a Quarrel with me, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Satisfaction: At which I was more puzzled than at the other, remembring what Mention your Familiar makes of thoſe that had loſt their Lives on ſuch Occaſions. The Thing is referred to your
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0397200201:213"/>
Judgment, and I expect you to be my Second, ſince you have been the Cauſe of our Quarrel. I am,</p>

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>

                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>I abſolutely pronounce, that there is no Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Offence given in this Expreſſion; for a <hi>Smart Fellow</hi> is always an Appellation of Praiſe, and is a Man of double Capacity. The true Caſt or Mould in which you may be ſure to know him is, when his Livelihood or Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is in the Civil Liſt, and you ſee him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a Vivacity or Mettle above the Way he is in by a little Jerk in his Motion, ſhort Trip in his Steps, well-fancied Lining of his Coat, or any other Indications which may be given in a vigorous Dreſs. Now, What poſſible Inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can there be, that 'tis a Cauſe of Quarrel for a Man to ſay, he allows a Gentleman really to be, what he, his Taylor, his Hoſier, and his Millener, have conſpired to make him? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, if this Perſon who appeals to me had ſaid, He was <hi>not a Smart Fellow,</hi> there had been Cauſe for Reſentment; but if he ſtands to it that he is one, he leaves no Manner of Ground for a Miſunderſtanding. Indeed, it is a moſt lamentable Thing, that there ſhould be a Diſpure raiſed upon a Man's ſaying another is, what he plainly takes Pains to be thought.</p>
               <p>But this Point connot be ſo well adjuſted, as by enquiring what are the Sentiments of wiſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Communities of the Uſe of the Sword, and from thence conclude, Whether it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to draw it ſo frequently or not? An Illuſtrious Commonwealth of <hi>Italy</hi> has preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it ſelf for many Ages, without letting one of their Subjects handle this deſtructive, Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, always leaving that Work to ſuch of Mankind as underſtand the Uſe of a whole Skin
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0397200201:214"/>
ſo little, as to make a Profeſſion of expoſing it to Cuts and Scars.</p>
               <p>But what need we run to ſuch Foreign Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Our moſt ancient and well-governed Cities are conſpicuous Exemples to all Mankind in their Regulation of Military Atchievements. The chief Citizens, like the noble <hi>Italians,</hi> hire Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries to carry Arms in their Stead; and you ſhall have a Fellow of a deſperate Fortune, for the Gain of one Half-Crown, go through all the Dangers of <hi>Tuttle-Fields,</hi> or the <hi>Artillery-Ground,</hi> clap his Right Jaw within Two Inches of the Touch-hole of a Muſquet, fire it off, and Huzza, with as little Concern as he tears a Pullet. Thus you ſee, to what Scorn of Danger theſe Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries arrive, out of a meer Love of ſordid Gain: But methinks it ſhould take off the ſtrong Prepoſſeſſion Men have in Favour of bold Actions, when they ſee upon what low Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives Men aſpire to 'em. Do but obſerve the common Practice in the Government of thoſe Heroick Bodies, our Militia and Lieutenancies, the moſt ancient Corps of Soldiers, perhaps, in the Univerſe; I queſtion, Whether there is one Inſtance of an Animoſity between any Two of theſe illuſtrious Sons of <hi>Mars</hi> ſince their Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was decided by Combat? I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber indeed to have read the Chronicle, of an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which had like to have occaſiond Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the very Field before all the General Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, tho' moſt of them were Juſtices of the Peace: Captain <hi>Crabtree</hi> of <hi>Birching-Lane,</hi> Haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſher, had drawn a Bill upon Major-General <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,</hi> Cheeſemonger in <hi>Thames-ſtreet. Crabtree</hi> draws this upon Mr. <hi>William Maggot</hi> and <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> A Country Lad receiv'd this Bill, and not underſtanding the Word <hi>Company,</hi> us'd in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bills on Men in Partnerſhip, carried it to Mr. <hi>Jeffrey Stitch</hi> of <hi>Crooked-Lane</hi> (Lieutenant of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0397200201:215"/>
the Major-General's Company) whom he had the Day before ſeen march by the Door in all the Pomp of his Commiſſion. The Lieutenant accepts it, for the Honour of the Company, ſince it had come to him. But Repayment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ask'd from the Major-General, he abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſes. Upon this, the Lieutenant thinks of nothing leſs than to bring this to a Rupture, and takes for his Second, <hi>Tobias Armſtrong</hi> of the <hi>Counter,</hi> and ſends him with a Challenge in a Scrip of Parchment, wherein was written, <hi>Stitch contra Maggot,</hi> and all the Fury vaniſh'd in a Moment. The Major-General gives Satisfaction to the Second, and all was well.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that the bold Spirits of our City are kept in ſuch Subjection to the Civil Power. Otherwiſe, Where would our Liberties ſoon be? If Wealth and Valour were ſuffer'd to exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their utmoſt Force: If ſuch Officers as are employed in the terrible Bands above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, were to draw Bills as well as Swords: Theſe dangerous Captains, who could victual an Army as well as lead it, would be too powerful for the State. But the Point of Honour juſtly gives Way to that of Gain; and by long and wiſe Regulation, the richeſt is the braveſt Man. I have known a Captain riſe to a Colonel in Two Days by the Fall of Stocks; and a Major, my good Friend, near the <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> aſcended to that Honour by the Fall of the Price of Spirits, and the Riſing of right <hi>Nantz.</hi> By this true Senſe of Honour, that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Warriors are ever in good Order and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, with their Colours and Coats all whole: As in other Battalions (where their Principles of Action are leſs ſolid) you ſee the Men of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice look like Spectres, with long Sides, and lank Cheeks. In this Army, you may meaſure a Man's Services by his Waſte, and the moſt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0397200201:216"/>
prominent Belly is certainly the Man who has been moſt upon Action. Beſides all this, there is another excellent Remark to be made in the Diſcipline of theſe Troops. It being of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſſity that the People of <hi>England</hi> ſhould ſee what they have for their Money, and be Eye-witneſſes of the Advantages they gain by it, all Battles which are fought abroad are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented here. But ſince one Side muſt be beaten, and the other conquer, which might create Diſputes, the eldeſt Company is always to make the other run, and the younger retreats, according to the laſt News and beſt Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. I have my ſelf ſeen Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> make <hi>Catinat</hi> fly from the Back-ſide of <hi>Grays-Inn-Lane</hi> to <hi>Hockley in the Hole,</hi> and not give over the Purſuit, till obliged to leave the <hi>Bear-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> on the Right, to avoid being borne down by Fencers, Wild Bulls and Monſters, too terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Encounter of any Heroes, but ſuch whoſe Lives are their Livelihood.</p>
               <p>We have here ſeen, that wiſe Nations do not admit of Fighting, even in the Defence of their Country, as a laudable Action; and they live within the Walls of our own City in great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reputation without it. It would be very neceſſary to underſtand, by what Force of the Climate, Food, Education, or Employment, one Man's Senſe is brought to differ ſo eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from that of another; that one is ridiculous and contemptible for forbearing a Thing which makes for his Safety; and another applauded for conſulting his Ruin and Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>It will therefore be neceſſary for us (to ſhow our Travelling) to examine this Subject fully, and tell you how it comes to paſs, That a Man of Honour in <hi>Spain,</hi> tho' you offend him never ſo gallantly, ſtabs you baſely; in <hi>England,</hi> tho' you offend never ſo baſely, challenges fairly:
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0397200201:217"/>
The former kills you out of Revenge; the latter out of good Breeding. But to probe the Heart of Man in this Particular to its utmoſt Thoughts and Receſſes, I muſt wait for the Return of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celet,</hi> who is now attending a Gentleman lately in a Duel, and ſometimes viſits the Perſon, by whoſe Hand he received his Wounds.</p>

This is the more ſurpriſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Men of the moſt delicate Senſe and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples have naturally in other Caſes a particular Repugnance in accommodating themſelves to the Maxims of the World: But one may eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Man that is affected with Beauetry, and the Reputation of a Tilt, from him who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies with both, meerly as they are impoſed upon him by Cuſtom; for in the former you'll remark an Air of Vanity and Triumph; whereas when the latter appears in a long Duvillier full of Powder, or has decided a Quarrel by the Sword, you may perceive in his Face, that he appeals to Cuſtom for an Excuſe. I think it may not be improper to enquire into the Genealogy of this Chimerical Monſter, called a <hi>Duel,</hi> which I take to be an illegitimate Species of the ancient Knight-Errantry. By the Laws of this Whim, your He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Perſon, or Man of Gallantry, was indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly obliged to ſtarve in Armour a certain Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Years in the Chaſe of Monſters, encounter them at the Peril of his Life, and ſuffer great Hardſhips, in order to gain the Affection of the Fair Lady, and qualifie himſelf for aſſuming the <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Poin's Men of nice Honour. But to do Juſtice to the ancient and real Monſters, I muſt obſerve, that they never moleſted thoſe who were not of a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to Hunt for them in the Woods and Deſarts; whereas on the contrary, our modern Monſters are ſo familiarly admitted and entertained in all the Courts and Cities of <hi>Europe,</hi> (except <hi>France</hi>) that one can ſcarce be in the moſt humaniz'd Society without riſquing ones Life; the People of the beſt Sort, and the fine Gentlemen of the Age, being ſo fond of 'em, that they ſeldom appear in any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Place without one. I have ſome further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations upon this Subject, which as you encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me, ſhall be communicated to you, by, Sir, a Couſin; but once removed from the beſt Family of the <hi>Staffs,</hi> namely,</p>

               <p>It is certain, Mr. <hi>Switch</hi> has hit upon the true Source of this Evil; and that it proceeds only from the Force of Cuſtom that we contradict our ſelves in half the Particulars and Occurrences of Life. But ſuch a Tyranny in Love, which the Fair impoſe upon us, is a little too ſevere, that we muſt demonſtrate our Affection for 'em by no certain Proof but Hatred to one another, or come at them (only as one does to an Eſtate) by Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivorſhip. This Way of Application to gain a Lady's Heart, is taking her as we do Towns and Caſtles, by diſtreſſing the Place, and letting none come near 'em without our Paſs. Were ſuch a Lover once to write the Truth of his Heart, and let her know his whole Thoughts, he would appear indeed to have a Paſſion for her; but it would hardly be called Love.

               <p>I am juſt come hither at Ten at Night, and have ever ſince Six been in the moſt celebrated, though moſt nauſeous, Company in Town: The Two Leaders of the Society were a Critick and a Wit. Theſe Two Gentlemen are great Opponents upon all Occaſions, not diſcerning that they are the neareſt each other in Temper and Talents of any Two Claſſes of Men in the World; for to profeſs Judgment, and to profeſs Wit, both ariſe from the ſame Failure, which is Want of Judgment. The Poverty of the Critick this Way proceeds from the Abuſe of his Faculty; that of the Wit, from the Neglect of it. It's a particular Obſervation I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made, That of all Morrals, a Critick is the ſillieſt; for by inuring himſelf to examine all Things, whether they are of Conſequence or not, he never looks upon any Thing but with a Deſign of paſſing Sentence upon it; by which Means, he is never a Companion,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0397200201:223"/>
but always a Cenſor. This makes him earneſt upon Trifles; and diſpute on the moſt indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Occaſions with Vehemence. If he offers to ſpeak or write, that Talent which ſhould approve the Work of the other Faculties, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents their Operation. He comes upon Action in Armour; but without Weapons: He ſtands in Safety; but can gain no Glory. The Wit on the other Hand has been hurried ſo long away by Imagination only, that Judgment ſeems not to have ever been one of his natural Faculties. This Gentleman takes himſelf to be as much obliged to be merry, as the other to be grave. A thorough Critick is a Sort of Puritan in the polite World. As an Enthuſiaſt in Religion ſtumbles at the ordinary Occurrences of Life, if he cannot quote Scripture Examples on the Occaſion; ſo the Critick is never ſafe in his Speech or Writing, without he has among the celebrated Writers an Authority for the Truth of his Sentence. You will believe we had a very good Time with theſe Brethren, who were ſo far out of the Dreſs of their native Country, and ſo loſt to its Dialect, that they were as much Strangers to themſelves, as to their Relation to each other. They took up the whole Diſcourſe; ſometimes the Critick grew paſſionate, and when reprimanded by the Wit for any Trip or Heſitation in his Voice, he would anſwer, Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> makes ſuch a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter on ſuch an Occaſion break off in the ſame Manner; ſo that the Stop was according to Nature, and as a Man in a Paſſion ſhould do. The Wit, who is as far gone in Letters as himſelf, ſeems to be at a Loſs to anſwer ſuch an Apology; and concludes only, that though his Anger is juſtly vented, it wants Fire in the Utterance. If Wit is to be meaſured by the Circumſtances of Time and Place, there is no
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0397200201:224"/>
Man has generally ſo little of that Talent, as he who is a Wit by Profeſſion. What he ſays, inſtead of ariſing from the Occaſion, has an Occaſion invented to bring it in. Thus he is new for no other Reaſon, but that he talks like no Body elſe; but has taken up a Method of his own, without Commerce or Dialogue with other People. The lively <hi>Jaſper Dactyle</hi> is one of this Character. He ſeems to have made a Vow to be witty to his Life's End. When you meet him, What do you think, ſays he, I have been entertaining my ſelf with? Then out comes a premeditated Turn; to which 'tis to no Purpoſe to anſwer, for he goes on in the ſame Strain of Thought he deſigned without your ſpeaking. Therefore I have a general Anſwer to all he can ſay; as, <hi>Sure there never was any Creature had ſo much Fire! Spondee,</hi> who is a Critick, is ſeldom out of this fine Man's Company. They have no Manner of Affection for each other, but keep together, like <hi>Novell</hi> and <hi>Oldfox</hi> in the <hi>Plain-Dealer,</hi> becauſe they ſhow each other. I know ſeveral of Senſe who can be diverted with this Couple; but I ſee no Curioſity in the Thing, except it be, that <hi>Spondee</hi> is dull and ſeems dull; but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctyle</hi> is heavy with a brisk Face. It muſt be own'd alſo, that <hi>Dactyle</hi> has almoſt Vigour enough to be a Coxcomb; but <hi>Spondee</hi> by the Lowneſs of his Conſtitution, is only a Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>

               <p>THE Vigilance, the Anxiety, the Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which I have for the good People of <hi>England,</hi> I am perſwaded will in Time be much commended; but I doubt whether they will ever be rewarded. However, I muſt go on chearfully in my Work of Reformation: That being my great Deſign, I am ſtudious to prevent my Labour's increaſing upon me; therefore am particularly obſervant of the Temper and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Childhood and Youth, that we may not give Vice and Folly Supplies from the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generation. It is hardly to be imagined how uſeful this Study is, and what great Evils or Benefits ariſe from putting us in our tender Years to what we are fit, or unfit: Therefore on <hi>Tueſday</hi> laſt (with a Deſign to ſound their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations) I took Three Lads who are under my Guardianſhip, a rambling, in a Hackney-Coach, to ſhow them the Town, as the Lions, the Tombs, <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and the other Places which are Entertainments to raw Minds, becauſe they ſtrike forcibly on the Fancy. The Boys are Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, one of Sixteen, the other of Fourteen, the other of Twelve. The Firſt was his Father's Darling, the Second his Mother's, and the Third is mine, who am their Uncle. Mr. <hi>William</hi> is a Lad of true Genius; but being at the upper End of a great School, and having all the Boys below him, his Arrogance is inſupportable. If I begin to ſhow a little of my <hi>Latin,</hi> he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately interrupts: Uncle, under Favour, that which you ſay is not underſtood in that Manner.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0397200201:228"/>
Brother, ſays my Boy <hi>Jack,</hi> You do not ſhow your Manners much in contradicting my Unkle <hi>Iſaac.</hi> You queer Cur, ſays Mr. <hi>William,</hi> Do you think my Uncle takes any Notice of ſuch a dull Rogue as you are? Mr. <hi>William</hi> goes on; He is the moſt ſtupid of all my Mother's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: He knows nothing of his Book: When he ſhould mind that, he is hiding or hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Taws and Marbles, or laying up Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things. His Way of Thinking is, Four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Farthings make Sixpence, and Two Sixpences a Shilling, Two Shillings and Sixpence Half a Crown, and Two Half-Crowns Five Shillings. So within theſe Two Months, the cloſe Hunks has ſcrap'd up Twenty Shillings, and we'll make him ſpend it all before he comes Home. <hi>Jack</hi> immediately claps his Hands into both Pockets, and turns as pale as Aſhes. There is nothing touches a Parent (and ſuch I am to <hi>Jack</hi>) ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as a provident Conduct. This Lad has in him the true Temper for a good Husband, a kind Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and an honeſt Executor. All the great People you ſee make conſiderable Figures on the Change, in Court, and ſometimes in Senates, are ſuch as in Reality have no greater Faculty than what may be called Humane Inſtinct, which is a natural Tendency to their own Preſervation, and that of their Friends, without being capable of ſtriking out of the Road for Adventures. There's Sir <hi>William Scrip</hi> was of this Sort of Capacity from his Childhood: He has bought the Country round him, and makes a Bargain better than Sir <hi>Harry Wildfire</hi> with all his Wit and Humour. Sir <hi>Harry</hi> never wants Money but he comes to <hi>Scrip,</hi> laughs at him half an Hour, and then gives Bond for t'other Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. The cloſe Men are incapable of placing Merit any where but in their Pence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gain it; while others, who have larger Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0397200201:229"/>
are diverted from the Purſuit by Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which can be ſupported only by that Caſh which they deſpiſe; and therefore are in the End, Slaves to their Inferiors both in Fortune and Underſtanding. I once heard a Man of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Senſe obſerve, That more Affairs in the World failed by being in the Hands of Men of too large Capacities for their Buſineſs, than by being in the Conduct of ſuch as wanted Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to execute them. <hi>Jack</hi> therefore being of a plodding Make, ſhall be a Citizen; and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign him to be the Refuge of the Family in their Diſtreſs, as well as their Jeſt in Proſperity. His Brother <hi>Will</hi> ſhall go to <hi>Oxford</hi> with all Speed, where, if he does not arrive at being a Man of Senſe, he will ſoon be informed wherein he is a Coxcomb. There is in that Place ſuch a true Spirit of Raillery and Humour, that if they can't make you a wiſe Man, they will certainly let you know you are a Fool, which is all my Couſin wants to ceaſe to be ſo. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken theſe Two out of the Way, I have Leiſure to look at my Third Lad. I obſerve in the young Rogue a natural Subtilty of Mind, which diſcovers it ſelf rather in forbearing to declare his Thoughts on any Occaſion, than in any viſible Way of exerting himſelf in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. For which Reaſon I will place him where, if he commits no Faults, he may go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than thoſe in other Stations, though they excel in Virtues. The Boy is well faſhioned, and will eaſily fall into a graceful Manner; wherefore, I have a Deſign to make him a Page to a great Lady of my Acquaintance; by which Means he will be well skill'd in the common Modes of Life, and make a greater Progreſs in the World by that Knowledge, than with the greateſt Qualities without it. A good Mien in a Court will carry a Man greater Lengths than
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0397200201:230"/>
a good Underſtanding in any other Place. We ſee a World of Pains taken, and the beſt Years of Life ſpent, in collecting a Set of Thoughts in a College for the Conduct of Life; and after all, the Man ſo qualified ſhall heſitate in his Speech to a good Suit of Clothes, and want common Senſe before an agreeable Woman. Hence it is, that Wiſdom, Valour, Juſtice, and Learning, can't keep a Man in Countenance that is poſſeſſed with theſe Excellencies, if he wants that infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Art of Life and Behaviour, call'd Good Breeding. A Man endow'd with great Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without this, is like one who has his Pockets full of Gold, but always wants Change for his ordinary Occaſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Will. Courtly</hi> is a living Inſtance of this Truth, and has had the ſame Education which I am gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my Nephew. He never ſpoke a Thing but what was ſaid before, and yet can converſe with the wittieſt Men without being ridiculous. Among the Learned, he does not appear igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; nor with the Wiſe, indiſcreet. Living in Converſation from his Infancy, makes him no where at a Loſs; and a long Familiarity with the Perſons of Men, is in a Manner of the ſame Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him, as if he knew their Arts. As Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is the Invention of wiſe Men to keep Fools at a Diſtance, ſo good Breeding is an Expedient to make Fools and wiſe Men Equals.</p>

Many were the Opinions which were immediately declared on this Subject: Some were for a certain Softneſs; ſome for I

know not what Delicacy; others for ſomething inexpreſſibly Tender: When it came to me, I ſaid there was no Rule in the World to be made for writing Letters, but that of being as near what you ſpeak Face to Face as you can; which is ſo great a Truth, that I am of Opinion, Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting has loſt more Miſtreſſes than any one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in the whole Legend of Love. For when you write to a Lady for whom you have a ſolid and honourable Paſſion, the great Idea you have of her, join'd to a quick Senſe of her Abſence, fills your Mind with a Sort of Tenderneſs, that gives your Language too much the Air of Complaint, which is ſeldom ſucceſsful. For a Man may flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf as he pleaſes, but he will find, that the Women have more Underſtanding in their own Affairs than we have, and Women of Spirit are not to be won by Mourners. He that can keep handſomely within Rules, and ſupport the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of a Companion to his Miſtreſs, is much more likely to prevail, than he who lets her ſee, the whole Reliſh of his Life depends upon her. If poſſible therefore divert your Miſtreſs, rather than ſigh to her. The pleaſant Man ſhe will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for her own Sake; but the languiſhing Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has nothing to hope from, but her Pity.

               <p>IN my Diſſertation againſt the Cuſtom of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Combat, it has been objected, that there is not Learning, or much Reading, ſhown therein, which is the very Life and Soul of all Treatiſes; for which Reaſon, being always eaſy to receive Admonitions, and reform my Errors, I thought fit to conſult this learned
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0397200201:235"/>
Board on the Subject. Upon propoſing ſome Doubts, and deſiring their Aſſiſtance, a very hopeful young Gentleman, my Relation, who is to be called to the Bar within a Year and an half at fartheſt, told me, That he had ever ſince I firſt mentioned Duelling turned his Head that Way; and that he was principally moved thereto, becauſe he deſigned to follow the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits in the North of <hi>England</hi> and the South of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to reſide moſtly at his own Eſtate at <hi>Landbadernawz</hi> in <hi>Cardiganſhire.</hi> The Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern <hi>Britains</hi> and the Southern <hi>Scots</hi> are a warm People, and the <hi>Welſh a Nation of Gentlemen;</hi> ſo that it behov'd him to underſtand well the Science of Quarrelling. The young Gentleman proceeded admirably well, and gave the Board an Account, that he had read <hi>Fitzherbert</hi>'s <hi>Grand Abridgment,</hi> and had found, that Duelling is a very ancient Part of the Law: For when a Man is ſued, be it for his Life or his Land, the Perſon that joins the Iſſue, whether Plaintiff or Defendant, may put the Trial upon the Duel. Further he argued, under Favour of the Court, that when the Iſſue is joined by the Duel in Treaſon or other Capital Crimes, the Parties accuſed and Accuſer muſt fight in their own proper Perſons: But if the Diſpute be for Lands, you may hire a Champion at <hi>Hockley in the Hole,</hi> or any where elſe. This Part of the Law we had from the <hi>Saxons;</hi> and they had it, as alſo the Trial by <hi>Ordeal,</hi> from the <hi>Lapland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> It is indeed agreed, ſaid he, the Southern and Eaſtern Nations never knew any Thing of it; for though the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> would ſcold, and call Names filthily, yet there is not an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a Challenge that ever paſſed amongſt them.</p>
               <p>His quoting the Eaſtern Nations, put another Gentleman in Mind of an Account he had from
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0397200201:236"/>
a Boatſwain of an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Man; which was, that a <hi>Chineſe</hi> had tricked and bubbled him, and that when he came to demand Satisfaction the next Morning, and like a true Tar of Honour called him Son of a Whore, Lyar, Dog, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rough Appellatives uſed by Perſons conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with Winds and Waves; the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> with great Tranquility, deſired him not to come Abroad faſting, nor put himſelf in a Heat, for it would prejudice his Health. Thus the Eaſt knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Gallantry.</p>
               <p>There ſate at the Left of the Table a Perſon of a venerable Aſpect, who aſſerted, That half the Impoſitions which are put upon theſe Ages, have been tranſmitted by Writers who have given too great Pomp and Magnificence to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits of the ancient <hi>Bear-Garden,</hi> and made their Gladiators, by fabulous Tradition, greater than <hi>Gorman</hi> and others of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> He informed the Company, that he had ſearched Authorities for what he ſaid, and that a learned Antiquary, <hi>Humphrey Scarecrow</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Hockley in the Hole,</hi> Recorder to the <hi>Bear-Garden,</hi> was then writing a Diſcourſe on the Subject. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the beſt Accounts, ſays this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that the high Names which are uſed among us with ſo great Veneration, were no other than Stage-fighters, and Worthies of the ancient <hi>Bear-Garden.</hi> The renowned <hi>Hercules</hi> always carried a Quarterſtaff, and was from thence called <hi>Claviger.</hi> A learned Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt is about proving what Wood this Staff was made of, whether Oak, Aſh, or Crab-Tree. The firſt Trial of Skill he ever performed, was with one <hi>Cacus,</hi> a Deer-Stealer; the next was with <hi>Typhonus,</hi> a Giant of Forty Foot Four Inches. Indeed it was unhappily recorded, that meeting at laſt with a Sailor's Wife, ſhe made his Staff of Proweſs ſerve her own Uſe, and dwindle
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0397200201:237"/>
away to a Diſtaff: She clapt him on an old Tar-Jacket of her Husband's; ſo that this great Hero drooped like a ſcabbed Sheep. Him his Contemporary <hi>Theſeus</hi> ſucceeded in the <hi>Bear-Garden,</hi> which Honour he held for many Years: This grand Duelliſt went to Hell, and was the only One of that Sort that ever came back again. As for <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Hector,</hi> (as the Ballads of thoſe Times mention) they were pretty Smart Fellows; they fought at Sword and Buckler; but the former had much the better of it; his Mother, who was an Oyſter-Woman, having got a Black-Smith of <hi>Lemnos</hi> to make her Son's Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons. There's a Pair of truſty <hi>Trojans</hi> in a Song of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s, that were famous for handling their Gauntlets, <hi>Dares,</hi> and <hi>Entellus;</hi> and indeed it does appear, they fought no Sham Prize. What Arms the great <hi>Alexander</hi> uſed, is uncertain; however, the Hiſtorian mentions, when he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd <hi>Thaleſtris,</hi> it was only at ſingle Rapier; but the Weapon ſoon failed; for it was always obſerved, that the <hi>Amazons</hi> had a Sort of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment about them, which made the Blade of the Weapon, though never of ſo good Metal, at every home Puſh loſe its Edge and grow fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman Bear-Garden</hi> was abundantly more magnificent than any Thing <hi>Greece</hi> could boaſt of; it flouriſhed moſt under thoſe Delights of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Domitian:</hi> At one Time it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, 400 Senators enter'd the Liſt, and thought it an Honour to be cudgelled and quarterſtaffed. I obſerve, the <hi>Laniſtae</hi> were the People chiefly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, which makes me imagine our <hi>Bear-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> copied much after this, the Butchers being the greateſt Men in it.</p>
               <p>Thus far the Glory and Honour of the <hi>Bear-Garden</hi> ſtood ſecure, till Fate, that irreſiſtible Ruler of ſublunary Things, in that univerſal
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0397200201:238"/>
Ruin of Arts and politer Learning, by thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage People the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> deſtroyed and levelled it to the Ground. Then fell the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and Bravery of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, till at laſt the Warlike Genius (but accompanied with more Courteſie) revived in the Chriſtian World under thoſe puiſſant Champions, St. <hi>George,</hi> St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> and other dignified Heroes: One kill'd his Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, another his Lion, and were all afterwards canonized for it, having red Letters before them to illuſtrate their Martial Temper. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation, it muſt be own'd, were devoted to Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry and Chivalry above the reſt of the World. What a great Figure does that great Name, Don <hi>Quixot,</hi> make in Hiſtory? How ſhines this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Star in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> World? O renown'd Hero!

                     <p>I Thought when I left the Town to have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed your Fame here, and helped you to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it by Intelligence from hence; but alas! they had never heard of the <hi>Tatler</hi> till I brought down a Set. I lent them from Houſe to Houſe; but they asked we what they meant. I began to enlighten them, by telling who and who were ſuppoſed to be intended by the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters drawn. I ſaid for Inſtance, <hi>Chloe</hi> and <hi>Clariſſa</hi> are two eminent Toaſts. A Gentleman (who keeps his Greyhound and Gun, and one would think might know better) told me, he ſuppoſed they were Papiſhes, for their Names were not <hi>Engliſh:</hi> Then, ſaid he, Why do you call live People Toaſts? I anſwered, That was a new Name found out by the Wits, to make a Lady have the ſame Effect as Burridge in the Glaſs when a Man is drinking. But ſays I, Sir, I perceive this is to you all bamboozling; why you look as if you were <hi>Don Diego'd</hi> to the Tune of a Thouſand Pounds.

                     <p>This Evening I was with a Couple of young Ladies; one of them has the Character of the prettieſt Company, yet really I thought her but ſilly; the other, who talked a great deal leſs, I obſerved to have Underſtanding. The Lady who is reckoned ſuch a Companion among her Acquaintance, has only, with a very brisk Air, a Knack of ſaying the commoneſt Things: The other, with a ſly ſerious one, ſays home Things enough. The firſt (Miſtreſs <hi>Giddy</hi>) is very quick; but the ſecond (Mrs. <hi>Slim</hi>) fell into <hi>Giddy</hi>'s own Style, and was as good Company as ſhe. <hi>Giddy</hi> happens to drop her Glove; <hi>Slim</hi> reaches it to her: Madam (ſays <hi>Giddy</hi>) I hope you'll have a better Office. Upon which <hi>Slim</hi> immediately repartees, and ſits in her Lap, and cries, Are you not ſorry for my Heavineſs? This ſly Wench pleaſed me to ſee how ſhe hit her Height of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo well. We ſate down to Supper. Says <hi>Giddy,</hi> mighty prettily, Two Hands in a Diſh, and One in a Purſe: Says <hi>Slim,</hi> Ay, Madam, the More the Merrier; but the Few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Better Chear. I quickly took the Hint, and was as witty and talkative as they. Says I,

                     </opener>
                     <p>I Know not whether you ought to pity or laugh at me; for I am fallen deſperately in Love with a profeſs'd <hi>Platonne,</hi> the moſt unaccountable Creature of her Sex. To hear her talk Seraphicks, and run over <hi>Norris</hi> and <hi>Moor,</hi> and <hi>Milton,</hi> and the whole Set of Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Triflers, torments me heartily; for to a Lover who underſtands Metaphors, all this pretty Prattle of Idea's gives very fine Views of Pleaſure, which only the dear Declaimer prevents, by underſtanding them literally. Why ſhould ſhe wiſh to be a Cherubim, when 'tis Fleſh and Blood that makes her adorable? If I ſpeak to her, that's a high Breach of the Idea of Intuition: If I offer at her Hand or Lip, ſhe ſhrinks from the Touch like a Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Plant, and would contract her ſelf into meer Spirit. She calls her Chariot, Vehicle; her furbelow'd Scarf, Pinnions: Her blue Mant and Petticoat is her Azure Dreſs; and her Footman goes by the Name of <hi>Oberon.</hi> 'Tis my Misfortune to be Six Foot and a half high, Two full Spans between the Shoulders, Thirteen Inches Diameter in the Calves; and before I was in Love, I had a noble Stomach, and uſually went to Bed ſober with Two Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. I am not quite Six and twenty, and my Noſe is marked truly Aquiline. For theſe Reaſons, I am in a very particular Manner her Averſion. What ſhall I do? Impudence it ſelf cannot reclaim her. If I write miſerable, ſhe reckons me among the Children of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſcards me her Region: If I aſſume the Groſs and Subſtantial, ſhe plays the real Ghoſt with me, and vani&amp;;shes in a Moment.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0397200201:244"/>
I had Hopes in the Hypocriſy of her Sex; but Perſeverance makes it as bad as fixed Averſion. I deſire your Opinion, Whether I may not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully play the Inquiſition upon her, make uſe of a little Force, and put her to the Rack and the Torture, only to convince her, ſhe has real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fine Limbs, without ſpoiling or diſtorting them. I expect your Directions, e're I proceed to dwindle and fall away with Deſpair; which at preſent I don't think adviſable, becauſe, if ſhe ſhould recant, ſhe may then hate me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the other Extreme for my Tenuity. I am (with Impatience)</p>
                     <closer>

               <p>My Patient has put his Caſe with very much Warmth, and repreſented it in ſo lively a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that I ſee both his Torment and Tormenter with great Perſpicuity. This Order of <hi>Platonick</hi> Ladies are to be dealt with in a peculiar Manner from all the reſt of the Sex. Flattery is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Way, and the Way in this Caſe; but it is not to be done groſly. Every Man that has Wit, and Humour, and Raillery, can make a good Flatterer for Woman in general; but a <hi>Platoune</hi> is not to be touched with Panegyrick: She will tell you, it is a Senſuality in the Soul to be delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Way. You are not therefore to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, but ſilently conſent to all ſhe does, and ſays. You are to conſider in her, the Scorn of you is not Humour, but Opinion.</p>
               <p>There were ſome Years ſince a Set of theſe Ladies who were of Quality, and gave out, That Virginity was to be their State of Life during this mortal Condition, and therefore reſolved to join their Fortunes, and erect a
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0397200201:245"/>
Nunnery. The Place of Reſidence was pitched upon; and a pretty Situation, full of natural Falls and Riſings of Waters, with ſhady Coverts, and flowry Arbours, was approved by Seven of the Founders. There were as many of our Sex who took the Liberty to viſit thoſe Manſions of intended Severity; among others, a famous <hi>Rake</hi> of that Time, who had the grave Way to an Excellence. He came in firſt; but upon ſeeing a Servant coming towards him, with a Deſign to tell him, this was no Place for him or his Companions, up goes my grave Impudence to the Maid: Young Woman, ſaid he, if any of the Ladies are in the Way on this Side of the Houſe, pray carry us on the other Side towards the Gardens: We are, you muſt know, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that are travelling <hi>England;</hi> after which we ſhall go into Foreign Parts, where ſome of us have already been. Here he bows in the moſt humble Manner, and kiſſed the Girl, who knew not how to behave to ſuch a Sort of Carriage. He goes on: Now you muſt know we have an Ambition to have it to ſay, That we have a Proteſtant Nunnery in <hi>England:</hi> But pray Mrs. <hi>Betty</hi>—Sir, ſhe replied, my Name is <hi>Suſan,</hi> at your Service. Then I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily beg your Pardon—No Offence in the leaſt (ſays ſhe) for I have a Couſin-German whoſe Name is <hi>Betty.</hi> Indeed, ſaid he, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to you that was more than I knew, I ſpoke at Random: But ſince it happens that I was near in the Right, give me Leave to preſent this Gentleman to the Favour of a civil Salute. His Friend advances, and ſo on, till that they had all ſaluted her. By this Means, the poor Girl was in the middle of the Crowd of theſe Fellows at a Loſs what to do, without Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to paſs through 'em; and the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> at ſeveral Peep-holes, pale, trembling, and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0397200201:246"/>
                  <hi>Rake</hi> perceiv'd they were obſerv'd, and therefore took Care to keep <hi>Suky</hi> in Chat with Queſtions concerning their Way of Life; when appeared at laſt <hi>Madonella,</hi> a Lady who had writ a fine Book concerning the Recluſe Life, and was the Projectrix of the Foundation. She approaches into the Hall; and <hi>Rake,</hi> knowing the Dignity of his own Mien and Aſpect, goes Deputy from his Company. She begins; Sir, I am obliged to follow the Servant, who was ſent out to know, What Affair could make Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers preſs upon a Solitude which we, who are to inhabit this Place, have devoted to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and our own Thoughts? Madam, replies <hi>Rake,</hi> (with an Air of great Diſtance, mixed with a certain Indifference, by which he could diſſemble Diſſimulation) your great Intention has made more Noiſe in the World than you deſign it ſhould; and we Travellers, who have ſeen many foreign Inſtitutions of this Kind, have a Curioſity to ſee, in its firſt Rudiments, this Seat of Primitive Piety; for ſuch it muſt be called by future Ages, to the Eternal Honour of the Founders. I have read <hi>Madonella</hi>'s excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ſeraphick Diſcourſe on this Subject. The Lady immediately anſwers, If what I have ſaid could have contributed to raiſe any Thoughts in you that may make for the Advancement of intellectual and divine Converſation, I ſhould think my ſelf extremely happy. He immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell back with the profoundeſt Veneration; then advancing, Are you then that admired La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? If I may approach Lips which have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Things ſo ſacred—He ſalutes her. His Friends followed his Example. The Devoted within ſtood in Amazement where this would end, to ſee <hi>Madonella</hi> receive their Addreſs and their Company. But <hi>Rake</hi> goes on—We
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0397200201:247"/>
would not tranſgreſs Rules; but if we may take the Liberty to ſee the Place you have thought fit to chuſe for ever, we would go into ſuch Parts of the Gardens as is conſiſtent with the Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics you have impoſed on your ſelves. To be ſhort, <hi>Madonella</hi> permitted <hi>Rake</hi> to lead her into the Aſſembly of Nuns, followed by his Friends, and each took his Fair One by the Hand, after due Explanation, to walk round the Gardens. The Converſation turned upon the Lillies, the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the Arbors, and the growing Vegetables; and <hi>Rake</hi> had the ſolemn Impudence, when the whole Company ſtood round him, to ſay, That he ſincerely wiſhed Men might riſe out of the Earth like Plants; and that our Minds were not of Neceſſity to be ſullied with carnivorous Appetites for the Generation, as well as Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our Species. This was ſpoke with ſo eaſie and fixed an Aſſurance, that <hi>Madonella</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, Sir, under the Notion of a pious Thought, you deceive your ſelf in wiſhing an Inſtitution foreign to that of Providence: Theſe Deſires were implanted in us for reverend Purpoſes, in preſerving the Race of Men, and giving Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for making our Chaſtity more Heroick. The Conference was continued in this Celeſtial Strain, and carried on ſo well by the Managers on both Sides, that it created a Second and a Second Interview; and, without entring into further Particulars, there was hardly one of them but was a Mother or Father that Day Twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month.</p>
               <p>Any unnatural Part is long taking up, and as long laying aſide; therefore Mr. <hi>Sturdy</hi> may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelf, <hi>Platonica</hi> will fly for ever from a forward Behaviour; but if he approaches her according to this Model, ſhe will fall in with the Neceſſities of mortal Life, and condeſcend
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0397200201:248"/>
to look with Pity upon an unhappy Man, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned in ſo much Body, and urged by ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Deſires.</p>

               <p>This Offence gives me Occaſion to expreſs my ſelf with the Reſentment I ought, on People who take Liberties of Speech before that Sex of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0397200201:251"/>
whom the honoured Names of Mother, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Siſter, are a Part: I had like to have named Wife in the Number; but the ſenſeleſs World are ſo miſtaken in their Sentiments of Pleaſure, that the moſt amiable Term in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life is become the Deriſion of Fools and Scorners. My Brother and I have at leaſt Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Times quarrell'd upon this Topick. I ever argue, That the Frailties of Women are to be imputed to the falſe Ornaments which Men of Wit put upon our Folly and Coquetry. He lays all the Vices of Men upon Women's ſecret Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Libertine Characters in them. I did not care to give up a Point; but now he is out of the Way, I cannot but own I believe there is very much in what he aſſerted: For if you will believe your Eyes, and own, that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edeſt and the wittieſt of them all marry one Day or other; Is it poſſible to believe, that if a Man thought he ſhould be for ever incapable of being received by a Woman of Merit and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he would perſiſt in an abandon'd Way, and deny himſelf the Poſſibility of enjoying the Happineſs of well-govern'd Deſires, orderly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, and honourable Methods of Life? If our Sex were wiſe, a Lover ſhould have a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate from the laſt Woman he ſerved, how he was turned away, before he was received into the Service of another: But at preſent any Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond is welcome, provided he promiſes to enter into our Livery. It is wonderful, that we will not take a Footman without Credentials from his laſt Maſter; and in the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of Life, we make no Scruple of falling into a Treaty with the moſt notorious Offender in his Behaviour againſt others. But this Breach of Commerce between the Sexes, proceeds from an unaccountable Prevalence of Cuſtom, by which a Woman is to the laſt Degree reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0397200201:252"/>
for being deceived, and a Man ſuffers no Loſs of Credit for being a Deceiver.</p>
               <p>Since this Tyrant Humour has gained Place, Why are we repreſented in the Writings of Men in ill Figures for Artifice in our Carriage, when we have to do with a profeſſed Impoſtor? When Oaths, Imprecations, Vows, and Adorations, are made uſe of as Words of Courſe, What Arts are not neceſſary to defend us from ſuch as glory in the Breach of 'em? As for my Part, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to hear all, and believe none of 'em; and therefore ſolemnly declare, no Vow ſhall deceive me, but that of Marriage: For I am turned of Twenty, and being of a ſmall Fortune, ſome Wit. and (if I can believe my Lovers and my Glaſs) Handſome, I have heard all that can be ſaid towards my Undoing, and ſhall therefore, for Warning-ſake, give an Account of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers that have been made me, my Manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting 'em, and my Aſſiſtances to keep my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
               <p>In the Sixteenth Year of my Life, I fell into the Acquaintance of a Lady extremely well known in this Town for the quick Advancement of her Husband, and the Honours and Diſtinctions which her Induſtry has procured him, and all who belong to her. This excellent Body ſate next to me for ſome Months at Church, and took the Liberty (which ſhe ſaid her Years and the Zeal ſhe had for my Welfare gave her Claim to) to aſſure me, that ſhe obſerved ſome Parts of my Behaviour which would lead me into Errors, and give Encouragement to ſome to entertain Hopes I did not think of. What made you (ſaid ſhe) look through your Fan at that Lord, when your Eyes ſhould have been turned upward, or cloſed in Attention upon better Objects? I bluſhed, and pretended Fifty odd Excuſes;—but confounded my ſelf the more. She wanted
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0397200201:253"/>
nothing but to ſee that Confuſion, and goes on: Nay, Child, do not be troubled that I take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, my Value for you made me ſpeak it; for though he is my Kinſman, I have a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Regard to Virtue than any other Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. She had hardly done ſpeaking, when this noble Lord came up to us, and lead her to her Coach.</p>
               <p>My Head ran all that Day and Night on the exemplary Carriage of this Woman, who could be ſo virtuouſly impertinent, as to admoniſh one ſhe was hardly acquainted with. However it ſtruck upon the Vanity of a Girl that it may poſſibly be, his Thoughts might have been as favourable of me, as mine were amorous of him, and as unlikely Things as that have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, if he ſhould make me his Wife. She never mentioned this more to me; but I ſtill in all publick Places ſtole Looks at this Man, who eaſily obſerved my Paſſion for him. It is ſo hard a Thing to check the Return of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Thoughts, that he became my Dream, my Viſion, my Food, my Wiſh, my Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>That Miniſter of Darkneſs, the Lady <hi>Semphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> perceived too well the Temper I was in, and would one Day after Evening Service needs take me to the Park. When we were there, my Lord paſſes by; I fluſhed into a Flame. Mrs. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) You may very well remember the Concern I was in upon the firſt Notice I took of your Regard to that Lord, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, who had a tender Friendſhip for your Mother (now in her Grave) that I am vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant of your Conduct. She went on with much Severity, and after great Solicitation, prevailed on me to go with her into the Country, and there ſpend the enſuing Summer out of the Way of a Man ſhe ſaw I loved, and one whom
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0397200201:254"/>
ſhe perceived meditated my Ruin, by frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſiring her to introduce him to me; which ſhe abſolutely refuſed, except he would give his Honour that he had no other Deſign but to marry me. To her Country-Houſe a Week or Two after we went: There was at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther End of her Garden a Kind of Wilderneſs, in the Middle of which ran a ſoft Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let by an Arbour of Jeſſamin. In this Place I uſually paſſed my retired Hours, and read ſome Romantick or Poetical Tale till the Cloſe of the Evening. It was near that Time in the Heat of Summer, when gentle Winds, ſoft Murmurs of Water, and Notes of Nightingals had given my Mind an Indolence, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that Repoſe of Soul, Twilight and the End of a warm Day naturally throws up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Spirits. It was at ſuch an Hour, and in ſuch a State of Tranquility I ſat, when, to my unexpreſſible Amazement, I ſaw my Lord walking towards me, whom I knew not till that Moment to have been in the Country. I could obſerve in his Approach the Perplexity which attends a Man big with Deſign; and I had, while he was coming forward, Time to reflect that I was betrayed; the Senſe of which gave me a Reſentment ſuitable to ſuch a Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But when he entered into the Bower where I was, my Heart flew towards him, and, I confeſs, a certain Joy came into my Mind, with an Hope, that he might then make a Declaration of Honour and Paſſion. This threw my Eye upon him with ſuch Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as gave him Power, with a broken Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, to begin. Madam,—You will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der—For it is certain, you muſt have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved—though I fear you will miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Motives—But by Heaven, and all that's Sacred! If you could—Here he
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0397200201:255"/>
made a full Stand. And I recovered Power to ſay, The Conſternation I am in you will not, I hope, believe—An helpleſs innocent Maid—Beſides that, the Place—He ſaw me in as great Confuſion as himſelf; which attributing to the ſame Cauſes, he had the Audaciouſneſs to throw himſelf at my Feet, talk of the Stilneſs of the Evening, and then ran into Deifications of my Perſon. Pure Flames, Conſtant Love, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Raptures, and a Thouſand other Phraſes drawn from the Images we have of Heaven, which ill Men uſe for the Service of Hell, were run over with uncommon Vehemence. After which, he ſeized me in his Arms: His Deſign was too evident. In my utmoſt Diſtreſs, I fell upon my Knees—My Lord, pity me, on my Knees—On my Knees in the Cauſe of Virtue, as you were lately in that of Wickedneſs. Can you think of deſtroying the Labour of a whole Life, the Purpoſe of a long Education, for the baſe Service of a ſudden Appetite; to throw one that loves you, that doats on you, out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Road of all that is virtuous and Praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy? Have I taken in all the Inſtructions of Piety, Religion and Reaſon, for no other End, but to be the Sacrifice of Luſt, and abandoned to Scorn? Aſſume your ſelf, my Lord, and do not attempt to vitiate a Temple Sacred to Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, Honour, and Religion. If I have inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you, ſtab this Boſom, and let me die, but not be ruined by the Hand I love. The Ardency of my Paſſion made me incapable of uttering more; and I ſaw my Lover aſtoniſhed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by my Behaviour: When ruſhed in <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronia.</hi> Ha! Faithful baſe Man, could you then ſteal out of Town, and lurk like a Robber about my Houſe for ſuch brutiſh Purpoſes!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0397200201:256"/>
My Lord was by this Time recovered, and fell into a violent Laughter at the Turn which <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronia</hi> deſigned to give her Villany. He bowed to me with the utmoſt Reſpect: Mrs. <hi>Diſtaff,</hi> ſaid he, be careful hereafter of your Company; and ſo retired. The Friend <hi>Semphronia</hi> congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated my Deliverance with a Flood of Tears.</p>
               <p>This Nobleman has ſince very frequently made his Addreſſes to me with Honour, but I have as often refuſed them; as well knowing, that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity and Marriage will make him, on ſome ill-natured Occaſion, call all I ſaid in the Arbour a Theatrical Action. Beſides that, I glory in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning a Man, who had Thoughts to my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour. If this Method were the Imitation of the whole Sex, Innocence would be the only Dreſs of Beauty; and all Affectation by any other Arts to pleaſe the Eyes of Men, would be baniſhed to the Stews for ever. The Conqueſt of Paſſion gives Ten times more Happineſs than we can reap from the Gratification of it; and ſhe that has got over ſuch a one as mine, will ſtand among Beaux and Pretty Fellows, with as much Safety as in a Summer's Day among Graſs-hoppers and Butterflies.</p>
               <p>P. S. <hi>I have Ten Millions of Things more againſt Men, if I ever get the Pen again.</hi>

               <p>HAving taken upon me to cure all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers which proceed from Affections of the Mind, I have laboured, ſince I firſt kept this publick Stage, to do all the Good I could, and have perfected many Cures at my own Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; carefully avoiding the common Method of Mountebanks, to do their moſt eminent Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0397200201:258"/>
in Sight of the People; but muſt be ſo juſt to my Patients as to declare, they have teſtified under their Hands their Senſe of my poor Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the Good I have done them, which I publiſh for the Benefit of the World, and not out of any Thoughts of private Advantage.</p>
               <p>I have cured fine Mrs. <hi>Spy</hi> of a great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in her Eyes, which made her eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally rolling them from one Coxcomb to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in publick Places, in ſo languiſhing a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that it at once leſſened her own Power, and her Beholders Vanity. Twenty Drops of my Ink, placed in certain Letters on which ſhe attentively looked for half an Hour, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored her to the true Uſe of her Sight; which is, to guide, and not miſlead us. Ever ſince ſhe took this Liquor, which I call, <hi>Bickerſtaff</hi>'s <hi>Circumſpection-Water,</hi> ſhe looks right forward, and can bear being looked at for half a Day without returning one Glance. This Water has a peculiar Vertue in it, which makes it the only true Coſmetick or Beauty-Waſh in the World: The Nature of it is ſuch, that if you go to a Glaſs, with a Deſign to admire your Face, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately changes it into downright Deformity. If you conſult it only to look with a better Countenance upon your Friends, it immediately gives an Alacrity to the Viſage, and new Grace to the whole Perſon. There is indeed a great deal owing to the Conſtitution of the Perſon to whom it is applied: It is in vain to give it when the Patient is in the Rage of the Diſtemper; a Bride in her firſt Month, a Lady ſoon after her Husband's being Knighted, or any Perſon of either Sex who has lately obtained any new good Fortune or Preferment, muſt be prepared ſome Time before they uſe it. It has an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon others, as well as the Patient, when it is taken in due Form. Lady <hi>Petulant</hi> has by
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0397200201:259"/>
the Uſe of it cured her Husband of Jealouſy, and Lady <hi>Gad</hi> her whole Neighbourhood of Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>The Fame of theſe Things, added to my being an old Fellow, makes me extreamly acceptable to the Fair Sex. You would hardly believe me, when I tell you there is not a Man in Town ſo much their Delight as my ſelf. They make no more of viſiting me, than going to Madam <hi>d'Epingle</hi>'s. There were two of them, namely, <hi>Damia</hi> and <hi>Clidamira,</hi> (I aſſure you Women of Diſtinction) who came to ſee me this Morning in their Way to Prayers, and being in a very diverting Humour, (as Innocence always makes People chea ful) they would needs have me, according to the Diſtinction of <hi>pretty</hi> and <hi>very</hi> pretty Fellows, inform them, if I thought either of them had a Title to the <hi>very Pretty</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe of their own Sex; and if I did, which was the more deſerving of the Two?</p>
               <p>To put them to the Tryal, Look ye, ſaid I, I muſt not raſhly give my Judgment in Matters or this Importance; pray let me ſee you dance: I play upon the Kit. They immediately fell back to the lower End of the Room (You may be ſure they curt'ſy'd low enough to me): And began. Never were Two in the World ſo equally match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and both S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Ladies, Ladies, cried I, not half that Air, you'll fire the Houſe. Both ſmiled; for by the by, there's no carrying a Metaphor too far, when a Lady's Charms are ſpoke of. Some Body, I think, has called a fine Woman dancing, a Brandiſhed Torch of Beauty. Theſe Rivals moved with ſuch an agreeable Freedom, that you would believe their Geſture was the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Effect of the Muſick, and not the Product of Skill and Practice. Now <hi>Clidamira</hi> came on
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0397200201:260"/>
with a Crowd of Graces, and demanded my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with ſo ſweet an Air—And ſhe had no ſooner carried it, but <hi>Damia</hi> made her utterly forgot by a gentle ſinking, and a Rigadoon Step. The Conteſt held a full half Hour; and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, I ſaw no manner of Difference in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, till they came up together, and expected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Therefore, <hi>Clidamira,</hi> you are a <hi>pretty;</hi> but, <hi>Damia,</hi> you are a <hi>very</hi> pretty Lady. For, ſaid I, Beauty loſes its Force, if not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Modeſty. She that has an humble Opinion of her ſelf, will have every Body's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, becauſe ſhe does not expect it; while the vain Creature loſes Approbation through too great a Senſe of deſerving it.</p>

               <p>Being of a very ſpare and hective Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I am forced to make frequent Journies of a Mile or Two for freſh Air; and indeed by this laſt, which was no further than the Village of <hi>Chelſea,</hi> I am further convinced of the Neceſſity of travelling to know the World. For as it is uſual with young Voyagers, aſſoon as they land upon a Shore, to begin their Accounts of the Nature of the People, their Soil, their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, their Inclinations, and their Paſſions; ſo really I fancied I could give you an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Deſcription of this Village, from the Five Fields where the Robbers lie in wait, to the Coffee-houſe where the <hi>Literari</hi> ſit in Council. A great Anceſtor of ours by the Mother's Side, Mr. Juſtice <hi>Overdo,</hi> (whoſe Hiſtory is
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0397200201:261"/>
written by <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi>) met with more Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities by walking <hi>incog.</hi> than he was capable of correcting; and found great Mortifications in obſerving alſo Perſons of Eminence, whom he before knew nothing of. Thus it fared with me, even in a Place ſo near the Town as this. When I came into the Coffee-houſe, I had not Time to ſalute the Company, before my Eye was diverted by Ten Thouſand Gimcracks round the Room and on the Sieling. When my firſt Aſtoniſhment was over, comes to me a Sage of a thin and meagre Countenance; which Aſpect made me doubt, whether Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Fretting had made it ſo Philoſophick: But I very ſoon perceived him to be of that Sect which the Ancients call <hi>Gingiviſtae;</hi> in our Language, Tooth-Drawers. I immediately had a Reſpect for the Man; for theſe practical Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers go upon a very rational Hypotheſis, not to cure, but take away the Part affected. My Love of Mankind made me very benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to Mr. <hi>Salter,</hi> for ſuch is the Name of this eminent Barber and Antiquary. Men are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but unjuſtly, diſtinguiſhed rather by their Fortunes, than their Talents, otherwiſe this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage would make a great Figure in that Claſs of Men which I diſtinguiſh under the Title of <hi>Odd Fellows.</hi> But it is the Misfortune of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of great Genius, to have their Faculties diſſipated by Attention to too many Things at once. Mr. <hi>Salter</hi> is an Inſtance of this: If he would wholly give himſelf up to the String, inſtead of playing Twenty Beginnings to Tunes, he might before he dies play <hi>Roger de Caubly</hi> quite out. I heard him go through his whole Round, and indeed I think he does play the merry <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> Bells pretty juſtly; but he confeſs'd to me, he did that rather to ſhow he was Orthodox, than that he valued himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0397200201:262"/>
the Muſick it ſelf. Or if he did proceed in his Anatomy, Why might not he hope in Time to cut off Legs, as well as draw Teeth? The Particularity of this Man put me into a deep Thought, whence it ſhould proceed, that of all the lower Order, Barbers ſhould go further in hitting the Ridicul us, than any other Set of Men. Watermen brawl, Coblers ſing: But why muſt a Barber be for ever a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician, a Muſician, an Anatomiſt, a Poet, and a Phyſician? The learned <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſays, his Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber uſed to comb his Head in <hi>Iambicks.</hi> And indeed in all Ages, one of this uſeful Profeſſion, this Order of Coſmetick Philoſophers, has been celebrated by the moſt eminent Hands. You ſee the Barber in Don <hi>Quixot</hi> is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Characters in the Hiſtory, which gave me Satisfaction in the Doubt, why Don <hi>Saltero</hi> writ his Name with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Termination: For he is deſcended in a right Line, not from <hi>John Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcan,</hi> as he himſelf aſſerts, but from that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Companion of the Knight of <hi>Mancha.</hi> And I hereby certify all the worthy Citizens who travel to ſee his Rarities, that his double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrelled Piſtols, Targets, Coats of Mail, his Sclopeta, and Sword of <hi>Toledo,</hi> were left to his Anceſtor by the ſaid Don <hi>Quixot,</hi> and by the ſaid Anceſtor to all his Progeny down to Don <hi>Saltero.</hi> Though I go thus far in favour of Don <hi>Saltero</hi>'s great Merit, I cannot allow a Liberty he takes of impoſing ſeveral Names (without my Licence) on the Collections he has made, to the Abuſe of the good People of <hi>England;</hi> one of which is particularly calculated to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Religious Perſons, to the great Scandal of the Well-diſpoſed, and may introduce Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Opinions. He ſhows you a Straw-Hat, which I know to be made by <hi>Madge Peskad,</hi> within Three Miles of <hi>Bedford;</hi> and tells you.

                  <hi>it is</hi> Pontius Pilate<hi>'s Wife's Chambermaid's Siſter's Hat.</hi> To my knowledge of this very Hat, it may be added, that the Covering of Straw was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſince it was deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them to make Bricks without it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is really nothing, but under the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pretence of Learning and Antiquity, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the World. There are other Things which I cannot tolerate among his Rarities; as, the <hi>China</hi> Figure of a Lady in the Glaſs-Caſe; the <hi>Italian</hi> Engine for the Impriſonment of thoſe who go Abroad with it: Both which I hereby order to be taken down, or elſe he may expect to have his Letters Patents for making Punch ſuperſeded, be debarred wearing his Muff next Winter, or ever coming to <hi>London</hi> without his Wife. It may perhaps be thought I have dwelt too long upon the Affairs of this Operator; but I deſire the Reader to remember, that it is my Way to conſider Men as they ſtand in Merit, and not according to their Fortune or Figure; and if he is in a Coffee-houſe at the Reading hereof, let him look round, and he will find there may be more Characters drawn in this Account than that of Don <hi>Saltero;</hi> for half the Politicians about him, he may obſerve, are, by their Place in Nature, of the Claſs of Tooth-Drawers.</p>

For as it is natural to lift a Man's Hand to a Sore, when you fear any Thing coming at you; ſo when a Perſon feels his Thoughts are run out, and has no more to ſay, it is as natural to ſupply his weak Brain with Powder at the neareſt Place of Acceſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Noſtrils. This is ſo evident, that Nature ſuggeſts the Uſe according to the Indigence of the Perſons who uſe this Medicine, without being prepoſſeſſed with the Force of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion or Cuſtom. For Example; the Native <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernians,</hi> who are reckoned not much unlike the ancie t <hi>Baeotians,</hi> take this Specifick for Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Head, in greater Abundance than any other Nation under the Sun. The learned <hi>Sotus,</hi> as ſparing as he is in his Words, would be ſtill more ſilent if it were not for this Powder.</p>
               <p>However low and poor, the taking Snuff ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a Man to be in his own Stock of Thought, or Means to employ his Brains and his Fingers, yet there is a poorer Creature in the World than He, and this is a Borrower of Snuff; a Fellow that keeps no Box of his own, but is always ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others for a Pinch. Such poor Rogues put me always in Mind of a common Phraſe among School-Boys when they are compoſing their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, who run to an upper Scholar, and cry, <hi>Pray give me a little</hi> Senſe. But of all Things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to the Ladies who are got into this pretty Help to Diſcourſe. I have been this Three Years perſwading <hi>Sagiſſa</hi> to leave it off; but ſhe talks ſo much, and is ſo Learned, that ſhe is above Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. However, an Accident t'other Day brought that about, which my Eloquence never
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0397200201:266"/>
could accompliſh: She had a <hi>very pretty Fellow</hi> in her Cloſet, who ran thither to avoid ſome Company that came to viſit her. She made an Excuſe to go in to him for ſome Implement they were talking of. Her eager Gallant ſnatched a Kiſs; but being unuſed to Snuff, ſome Grains from off her upper Lip made him ſneeze aloud, which alarm'd the Viſitants, and has made a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, that profound Reading, very much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, and a general Knowledge of who and who's together, cannot fill up her vacant Hours ſo much, but that ſhe is ſometimes obliged to deſcend to Entertainments leſs intellectual.</p>

               <p>Having taken a Reſolution when Plays are acted next Winter by an entire good Company, to publiſh Obſervations from Time to Time on the Performance of the Actors, I think it but juſt to give an Abſtract of the Laws of Action, for the Help of the leſs learned Part of the Audience,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0397200201:268"/>
that they may rationally enjoy ſo refined and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive a Pleaſure as a juſt Repreſentation of humane Life. The great Errors in Playing are admirably well expoſed in <hi>Hamlet</hi>'s Direction to the Actors who are to play in his ſuppoſed Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy; by which we ſhall form our future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on their Behaviour, and for that Reaſon you have the Diſcourſe as follows:</p>
               <q>Speak the Speech as I pronounce it to you, trippingly on the Tongue; but if you mouth it as many of our Players do, I had as lieu the Town-Cryer had ſpoke my Lines: Nor do not ſaw the Air too much with your Hand thus; but uſe all gently: For in the very Torrent, Tempeſt, and, as I may ſay, the Whirlwind of Paſſion, you muſt acquire and beget a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance that may give it Smoothneſs. Oh! It offends me to the Soul, to ſee a robuſtous Periwig-pated Fellow tear a Paſſion to Tatters, to very Rags, to ſplit the Ears of the Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, who (for the moſt Part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb Shews and Noiſe. I could have ſuch a Fellow whipt for o'erdoing <hi>Termagant:</hi> It out-<hi>Herod's Herod.</hi> Be not too tame neither; but let your own Diſcretion be your Tutor: Sute the Action to the Word, the Word to the Action; with this ſpecial Obſervance, that you o'erſtop not the Modeſty of Nature; for any Thing ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, is from the Purpoſe of Playing, whoſe End, both at the firſt and now, was, and is, to hold as 'twere the Mirror up to Nature; to ſhew Virtue her own Feature; Scorn her own Image; and the very Age and Body of the Time its Form and Preſſure. Now this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, or come tardy off, though it make the Unskilful laugh, cannot but make the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous grieve. The Cenſures of which one muſt, in your Allowance, overſway a whole Theatre
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0397200201:269"/>
of others. Oh! there be Players that I have ſeen play, and heard others praiſe, and that highly, (not to ſpeak it prophanely) that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having the Accent of <hi>Chriſtian, Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Norman,</hi> have ſo ſtrutted and bellowed, that I have thought ſome of Nature's Journey men had made Men, and not made them well, they imitated Humanity ſo abominably. This ſhould be reformed altogether; and let thoſe that play your Clowns, ſpeak no more than is ſet down for them: For there be of them that will of themſelves laugh, to ſet on ſome Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of barren Spectators to laugh too; though in the mean Time, ſome neceſſary Queſtion of the Play be then to be conſider'd; that's villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and ſhews a moſt pitiful Ambition in the Fool that uſes it.</q>

                     <p>IT is now almoſt Three Weeks ſince what you writ about happen'd in this Place: The Quarrel between my Friends did not run ſo high as I find your Accounts have made it. The Truth of the Fact you ſhall have very faithfully. You are to underſtand, that the Perſons concern'd in this Scene were, Lady <hi>Autumn,</hi> and Lady <hi>Springly: Autumn</hi> is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of good Breeding, Formality, and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Way practiſed in the laſt Age; and Lady <hi>Springly,</hi> a modern Impertinent of our Sex, who affects as improper a Familiarity, as the other does Diſtance. Lady <hi>Autumn</hi> knows to an Hair's Breadth where her Place is in all Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies and Converſations; but <hi>Springly</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives nor takes Place of any Body, but underſtands the Place to ſignify no more, than to have Room enough to be at Eaſe wherever ſhe comes. Thus while <hi>Autumn</hi> takes the Whole of this Life to conſiſt in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Punctilio and Decorum, <hi>Springly</hi> takes every Thing to be becoming which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0397200201:273"/>
to her Eaſe and Satisfaction. Theſe Heroines have married Two Brothers, both Knights. <hi>Springly</hi> is the Spouſe of the elder, who is a Baronet; and <hi>Autumn,</hi> being a rich Widow, has taken the younger, and her Purſe endowed him with an equal Fortune and Knighthood of the ſame Order. This Jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Titles, you need not doubt, has been an aching Torment to <hi>Autumn,</hi> who took Place of the other on no Pretence, but her Careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diſregard of Diſtinction. The ſecret Occaſion of Envy broiled long in the Breaſt of <hi>Autumn;</hi> but no Opportunity of Contention on that Subject happening, kept all Things quiet till the Accident, of which you demand an Account.</p>
                     <p>It was given out among all the gay People of this Place, That on the 9th Inſtant ſeveral Damſels, ſwift of Foot, were to run for a Sute of Head-Clothes at the <hi>Old Wells.</hi> Lady <hi>Autumn</hi> on this Occaſion invited <hi>Springly</hi> to go with her in her Coach to ſee the Race. When they came to the Place where the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of Epſom</hi> and all his Court of Citizens were aſſembled, as well as a Crowd of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all Orders, a brisk young Fellow ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes himſelf to the younger of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, <hi>viz. Springly,</hi> and offers her his Service to conduct her into the Muſick-Room. <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> accepts the Compliment, and is led trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly through a bowing Crowd, while <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn</hi> is left among the Rabble, and has much ado to get back into her Coach; but ſhe did it at laſt: And as it is uſual to ſee by the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes my Lady's preſent Diſpoſition, ſhe orders <hi>John</hi> to whip furiouſly Home to her Husband; where, when ſhe enters, down ſhe ſits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to unpin her Hood, and lament her fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh fond Heart to marry into a Family where
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0397200201:274"/>
ſhe was ſo little regarded, ſhe that might—Here ſhe ſtops; then riſes up and ſtamps, and ſits down again. Her gentle Knight made his Approaches with a ſupple beſeeching Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. My Dear, ſaid he,—Tell me no Dears, replied <hi>Autumn</hi>—in the Preſence of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and all the Merchants—What will the World ſay of a Woman that has thrown her ſelf away at this Rate? Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> withdrew, and knew it would not be long a Secret to him; as well as that Experience told him, He that marries a Fortune, is of Courſe guilty of all Faults againſt his Wife, let them be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by whom they will. But <hi>Springly,</hi> an Hour or Two after, returns from the <hi>Wells,</hi> and finds the whole Company together. Down ſhe ſat, and a profound Silence enſued. You know a premeditated Quarrel uſually begins and works up with the Words, <hi>Some People.</hi> The Silence was broken by Lady <hi>Autumn,</hi> who began to ſay, <hi>There are Some People who fancy, that if Some People—Springly</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately takes her up; <hi>There are Some People who fancy, if Other People—Autumn</hi> repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees; <hi>People may give themſelves Airs; but Other People, perhaps, who make leſs ado, may be, perhaps, as agreeable as People who ſet themſelves out more.</hi> All the other People at the Table ſat mute, while theſe Two People, who were quarrelling, went on with the Uſe of the Word <hi>People,</hi> inſtancing the very Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents between them, as if they kept only in diſtant Hints. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſays <hi>Autumn,</hi> red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>There are ſome People will go Abroad in other People's Coaches, and leave thoſe with whom they went to ſhift for themſelves; and if, perhaps, thoſe People have married the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brother; yet, perhaps, he may be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to thoſe People for what he is.

ſmartly anſwers, <hi>People may bring ſo much ill Humour into a Family, as People may repent their receiving their Money;</hi> and goes on,—<hi>Every Body is not conſiderable enough to give her Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Upon this, <hi>Autumn</hi> comes up to her, and deſired her to kiſs her, and never to ſee her again; which her Siſter refuſing, my Lady gave her a Box on the Ear—<hi>Springly</hi> returns; <hi>Ay, ay,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I knew well enough you meant me by your Some People, and gives her another on t'other Side.</hi> To it they went with moſt Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine Fury: Each Husband ran in. The Wives immediately fell upon their Husbands, and tore Periwigs and Cravats. The Company interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; when (according to the Slip-Knot of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, which makes them return to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when any put in between) the Ladies and their Husbands fell upon all the reſt of the Company; and having beat all their Friends and Relations out of the Houſe, came to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves time enough to know, there was no bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Jeſt of the Place after theſe Adventures, and therefore marched off the next Day. It is ſaid, the Governour has ſent ſeveral Joints of Mutton, and has propoſed divers Diſhes very exquiſitely dreſſed, to bring them down again.

               <p>This Day appear'd here a Figure of a Perſon, whoſe Services to the Fair Sex have reduced him to a Kind of Exiſtence, for which there is no Name. If there be a Condition between Life and Death, without being abſolutely dead or living, his State is that. His Aſpect and Complexion in his robuſt Days gave him the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Title of <hi>Africanus:</hi> But it is not only from the warm Climates in which he has ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, nor from the Diſaſters in which he has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, that he deſerves the ſame Appellation with that renowned <hi>Roman;</hi> but the Magnanimity with which he appears in his laſt Moments, is what gives him the undoubted Character of <hi>Hero. Cato</hi> ſtabbed himſelf, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> drank Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but our <hi>Africanus</hi> lives in the continual Puncture of aching Bones and poiſoned Juices. The Old Heroes fled from Torments by Death, and this Modern lives in Death and Torments, with an Heart wholly bent upon a Supply for remaining in them. An ordinary Spirit would ſink under his Oppreſſions; but he makes an Advantage of his very Sorrow, and raiſes an Income from his Diſeaſes. Long has this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy been converſant in Bartering, and knows that when Stocks are loweſt, it is the Time to buy. Therefore, with much Prudence and Tranquility, he thinks, that now he has not a Bone ſound, but a Thouſand nodous Parts for which the Anatomiſt have not Words, and more Diſeaſes than the College ever heard of, it is the only Times to purchaſe an Annuity for Life. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> told me, it was an Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more ſurprizing and pleaſant than can be imagined, to ſee an Inhabitant of neither World without Hand to lift, or Leg to move, ſcarce Tongue to utter his Meaning, ſo keen upon
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0397200201:277"/>
biting the whole World, and making Bubbles at his Exit. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> added, that he would have bought Twelve Shillings a Year of him, but that he feared there was ſome Trick in it, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him already dead: What! Says that Knight, Is Mr. <hi>Partridge,</hi> whom I met juſt now going on both his Legs firmer than I can, allowed to be quire dead; and ſhall <hi>Africanus,</hi> without one Limb that can do its Office, be pronounced alive.</p>
               <p>What heightened the Tragi-Comedy of this Market for Annuities was, that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of it provoked <hi>Monocalus</hi> (who is the moſt Eloquent of all Men) to many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Reflections, which he ſpoke with the Vehemence and Language both of a Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and an Orator. <q rend="inline">"When I caſt (ſaid that delightful Speaker) my Eye upon thee, thou unaccountable <hi>Africanus,</hi> I cannot but call my ſelf as unaccountable as thou art; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we were born to ſhew what Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions Nature is pleaſed to form in the ſame Species. Here am I, able to eat, to drink, to ſleep, and do all Acts of Nature, except begetting my Like; and yet by an unintelligible Force of Spleen and Fancy, I every Moment imagine I am dying. It is utter Madneſs in thee to provide for Supper; for I'll bet you Ten to One, you don't live till half an Hour after Four; and yet I am ſo diſtracted as to be in Fear every Moment, though I'll lay Ten to Three, I drink Three Pints of burnt Claret at your Funeral Three Nights hence. After all, I envy thee; thou that haſt no Senſe of Death, art happier than one that always fears it."</q> The Knight had gone on, but that a Third Man ended the Seene by applauding the Knight's Eloquence
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0397200201:278"/>
and Philoſophy, in a Laughter too violent for his own Conſtitution, as much as he mock'd that of <hi>Africanus</hi> and <hi>Monoculus.</hi>

               <p>IT may be thought very unaccountable, that I who can never be ſuppoſed to go to <hi>White</hi>'s, ſhould pretend to talk to you of Matters proper for, or in the Stile of, that Place. But though I never viſit theſe publick Haunts, I converſe with thoſe that do; and for all they pretend ſo much to the contrary, they are as talkative as our Sex, and as much at a Loſs to entertain the preſent Company, without ſacrificing the laſt, as we our ſelves. This Reflection has led me into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Uſe of Speech; and made me look over in my Memory all my Acquaintance of both Sexes, to know to which I may more juſtly impute the Sin of ſuperfluous Diſcourſe, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Converſation, without entring into it as it reſpects Religion.</p>
               <p>I foreſee my Acquaintance will immediately, upon ſtarting this Subject, ask me, How I ſhall celebrate Mrs. <hi>Alſe Copſwood,</hi> the <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, who is come to Town lately, and moves as if ſhe were on her Nag, and going to take a Five-Bar Gate; and is as loud as if ſhe were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing her Dogs? I can eaſily anſwer that; for ſhe is as ſoft as <hi>Damon,</hi> in Compariſon of her Brother-in-Law <hi>Tom. Bellfrey,</hi> who is the moſt accompliſh'd Man in this Kingdom for all Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-like Activities and Accompliſhments. It is allow'd, that he is a profeſs'd Enemy to the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0397200201:280"/>
                  <hi>Italian</hi> Performers in Muſick. But then for our own native Manner, according to the Cuſtoms and known Uſages of our Iſland, he is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, for the Generality of the Pleaſure he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows, much before thoſe Fellows, though they ſing to full Theatres. For what is a Theatrical Voice to that of a Fox-hunter? I have been at a Muſical Entertainment in an open Field, where it amaz'd me to hear to what Pitches the chief Maſters would reach. There was a Meeting near our Seat in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and the moſt emine t of all the Counties of <hi>England</hi> were at it. How wonderful was the Harmony between Men and Dogs! <hi>Robin Cartail</hi> of <hi>Bucks</hi> was to anſwer to <hi>Jowler;</hi> Mr. <hi>Tinbreaſt</hi> of <hi>Cornwal</hi> was appointed to open with <hi>Sweetlips,</hi> and Beaux <hi>Slimber,</hi> a <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doner,</hi> undertook to keep up with <hi>Trips,</hi> a Whelp juſt ſet in: <hi>Tom. Bellfrey</hi> and <hi>Ringwood</hi> were cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together, to fill the Cry on all Occaſions, and be in at the Death of the Fox, Hare, or Stag; for which both the Dog and the Man were excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſuited, and loved one another, and were as much together as <hi>Baniſter</hi> and <hi>King.</hi> When <hi>Jowler</hi> firſt alarm'd the Field, <hi>Cartail</hi> repeated every Note; <hi>Sweetlips</hi>'s Treble ſucceeded, and ſhook the Wood; <hi>Tinbreaſt</hi> eccho'd a Quarter of a Mile beyond it. We were ſoon after all at a Loſs, till we rid up, and found <hi>Trips</hi> and <hi>Slimber</hi> at a Default in Half Notes: But the Day and the Tune was recovered by <hi>Tom. Bellfrey</hi> and <hi>Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> to the great Joy of us all, tho' they drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every other Voice: For <hi>Bellfrey</hi> carries a Note Four Furlongs, Three Rood, and Six Paces, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any other in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I fear the Mention of this will be thought a Digreſſion from my Purpoſe about Speech: But I anſwer, No. Since this is uſed where Speech rather ſhould be employ'd, it may come in o Conſideration in the ſame Chapter: For Mr. <hi>Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0397200201:281"/>
being at a Viſit where I was, <hi>viz.</hi> his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin's (Lady <hi>Dainty</hi>'s) in <hi>Soho,</hi> was asked, What Entertainments they had in the Country? Now <hi>Bellfrey</hi> is very ignorant, and much a Clown; but confident withal. In a Word, he ſtruck up a Fox-Chaſe: Lady <hi>Dainty</hi>'s Dog, Mr. <hi>Sippet,</hi> as ſhe calls him, ſtarted and jump'd out of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Lap, and fell a barking. <hi>Bellfrey</hi> went on, and call'd all the neighbouring Pariſhes into the Square. Never was Woman in ſuch Confuſion as that delicate Lady. But there was no ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping her Kinſman. A Room full of Ladies fell into the moſt violent Laughter: My Lady look'd as if ſhe was ſhrieking; Mr. <hi>Sippet</hi> in the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Room, breaking his Heart with bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but all of us unheard. As ſoon as <hi>Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> became ſilent, up gets my Lady, and takes him by the Arm to lead him off: <hi>Bellfrey</hi> was in his Boots. As ſhe was hurrying him away, his Spurs takes hold of her Petticoat; his Whip throws down a Cabinet of <hi>China:</hi> He cries, <hi>What! Are your Crocks rotten? Are your Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats ragged? A Man can't walk in your Houſe for Trincums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every County of <hi>Great Britain</hi> has One Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or more of this Sort of Fellows, who Roar inſtead of Speaking. Therefore if it be true, that we Women are alſo given to greater Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Words than is neceſſary, ſure ſhe that diſturbs but a Room or a Family is more to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, than one who draws together Pariſhes and Counties, and ſometimes (with an Eſtate that might make him the Bleſſing and Ornament of the World around him) has no other View and Ambition, but to be an Animal above Dogs and Horſes, without the Reliſh of any one En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, which is peculiar to the Faculties of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. I know it will here be ſaid, that talking of meer Country Squires at this Rate, is,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0397200201:282"/>
as it were, to write againſt <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orſon.</hi> To prove any Thing againſt the Race of Men, you muſt take 'em as they are adorn'd with Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as they live in Courts, or have received Inſtructions in Colleges.</p>
               <p>But I am ſo full of my late Entertainment by Mr. <hi>Bellfrey,</hi> that I muſt defer purſuing this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to another Day; and wave the proper Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon the different Offenders in this Kind, ſome by profound Eloquence on ſmall Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, others by degrading Speech upon great Circumſtances. Expect therefore to hear of the Whiſperer without Buſineſs, the Laugher with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wit, the Complainer without receiving In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and a very large Crowd, which I ſhall not foreſtall, who are common (though not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obſerv'd) Impertinents, whoſe Tongues are too voluble for their Brains, and are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Deſpiſers of us Women, though we have their Superiors, the Men of Senſe, for our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>

                     <p>A Noble Gentleman of this City, who has the Honour of ſerving his Country as Major in the Train-Bands, being at that General Mart of Stock-Jobbers call'd <hi>Jonathans,</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to raiſe himſelf (as all Men of Honour ought) to the Degree of Colonel at leaſt; it happened that he bought the <hi>Bear</hi> of another Officer, who, though not Commiſſioned in the Army, yet no leſs eminently ſerves the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick than the other, in raiſing the Credit of the Kingdom, by raiſing that of the Stocks. However, having ſold the <hi>Bear,</hi> and Words ariſing about the Delivery, the moſt Noble Major, no leſs ſcorning to be outwitted in the Coffee-houſe, than to run into the Field, according to Method, abuſed the other with the Titles of, <hi>Rogue, Villain, Bearskin-Man,</hi> and the like. Whereupon Satisfaction was demanded, and accepted: So, forth the Major march'd, commanding his Adverſary to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. To a moſt ſpacious Room in the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff's Houſe, near the Place of Quarrel, they come; where, having due Regard to what you have lately publiſh'd, they reſolved not to ſhed one another's Blood in that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Manner you prohibited; yet, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0397200201:285"/>
to put up Affronts without Satisfaction' they ſtripp'd, and in decent Manner fought full fairly with their wrathful Hands. The Combat laſted a Quarter of an Hour; in which Time Victory was often doubtful, and many a dry Blow was ſtrenuouſly laid on by each Side, till the Major finding his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary obſtinate, unwilling to give him further Chaſtiſement, with moſt ſhrill Voice cry'd out, <hi>I am ſatisfied, enough.</hi> Whereupon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat ceas'd, and both were Friends imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>
                     <p>Thus the World may ſee, how neceſſary it is to encourage thoſe Men, who make it their Buſineſs to inſtruct the People in every Thing neceſſary for their Preſervation.

Many other Calamities may ceaſe with the War; but I diſmally dread the Multiplication of theſe Mortals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Eaſe and Luxuriouſneſs of a ſettled Peace, half the Bleſſing of which may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by 'em. Their Miſtake lies certainly here, in a wretched Belief, That their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mickry paſſes for Real Buſineſs, or True Wit. Dear Sir, convince 'em, that it never was, is, or ever will be, either of them; nor ever did, does, or to all Futurity ever can look like ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them; but that it is the moſt curſed Diſturbance in Nature, which is poſſible to be inflicted on Mankind, under the noble Definition of a Sociable Creature. In doing this, Sir, you will oblige more Humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, than can find Room to ſubſcribe their Names.</p>

               <p>In Purſuance of my laſt Date from hence, I am to proceed on the Accounts I promiſed of ſeveral Perſonages among the Men, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous Fortunes, or Ambition in ſhewing their Follies, have exalted them above their Fellows: The Levity of their Minds is viſible in their every Word and Geſture, and there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0397200201:287"/>
Looks, or affected Severity, or impertinent Gaie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or pert Smartneſs, their Self-Love and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration cannot, under any of theſe Diſguiſes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo invincible as that of the Men. You may eaſily take Notice, that in all their Actions there is a ſecret Approbation, either in the Tone of their Voice, the Turn of their Body, or Caſt of their Eye, which ſhows that they are extremely in their own Favour.</p>
               <p>Take one of your Men of Buſineſs, he ſhall keep you half an Hour with your Hat off, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining you with his Conſideration of that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair you ſpoke of to him laſt, till he has drawn a Crowd that obſerves you in this Grimace. Then when he is publick enough, he immediately runs into Secrets, and falls a whiſpering. You and he make Breaks with Adverbs; as, <hi>But however, thus far;</hi> and then you whiſper again, and ſo on, till they who are about you are diſperſed, and your buſy Man's Vanity is no longer gratified by the Notice taken of what Importance he is, and how inconſiderable you are; for your Pretender to Buſineſs is never in Secret, but in Publick.</p>
               <p>There is my dear Lord <hi>No-where,</hi> of all Men the moſt gracious and moſt obliging, the Terror of all Valets de Chambre, whom he oppreſſes with good Breeding, in enquiring for my good Lord, and for my good Lady's Health. This imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Courtier will whiſper a Privy-Counſellor's Lacquey with the utmoſt Goodneſs and Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention, to know when they next ſit; and is throughly taken up, and thinks he has a Part in a Secret, if he knows that there is a Secret. <hi>What it is</hi> he will whiſper you, <hi>that Time will diſcover;</hi> then he ſhrugs, and calls you back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain—<hi>Sir, I need not ſay to you. That theſe Things are not to be ſpoken of—And hark'ee, No Names, I would not be quoted.</hi> What adds to the Jeſt is, that his Emptineſs has its Moods and Seaſons,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0397200201:288"/>
and he will not condeſcend to let you into theſe his Diſcoveries, except he is in very good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or has ſeen ſome Body in Faſhion talk to you. He will keep his <hi>Nothing</hi> to himſelf, and paſs by and overlook as well as the beſt of 'em; not obſerving that he is inſolent when he is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and obliging when he is haughty. Show me a Woman ſo inconſiderable as this frequent Character.</p>
               <p>But my Mind (now I am in) turns to many no leſs obſervable: Thou dear <hi>Will. Shoeſtring!</hi> I profeſs my ſelf in Love with thee? How ſhall I ſpeak thee? How ſhall I addreſs thee? How ſhall I draw thee? Thou dear Outſide! Will you be combing your Wig, Playing with your Box, or Picking your Teeth? Or chuſeſt thou rather to be Speaking; to be ſpeaking for thy only Purpoſe in Speaking, to ſhew your Teeth? Rub 'em no longer, dear <hi>Shoeſtring:</hi> Do not premeditate Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Do not for ever Whiten: Oh! That for my Quiet and his own they were rotten.</p>
               <p>But I will forget him, and give my Hand to the courteous <hi>Umbra;</hi> He is a fine Man indeed, but the ſoft Creature bows below my Apron-String before he takes it; yet after the firſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, he is as familiar as my Phyſician, and his Inſignificancy makes me half ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to him of all I would to my Doctor. He is ſo courteous, that he carries half the Meſſages of Ladies Ails in Town to their Midwives and Nurſes. He underſtands too the Art of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine as far as to the Cure of a Pimple or a Raſh. On Occaſions of the like Importance, he is the moſt aſſiduous of all Men living, in conſulting and ſearching Precedents from Family to Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; then he ſpeaks of his Obſequiouſneſs and Diligence in the Style of real Services. If you ſneer at him, and thank him for his great Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he bows, and ſays, <hi>Madam, all the good</hi>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0397200201:289"/>
                  <hi>Offices in my Power, while I have any Knowledge or Credit, ſhall be at your Service.</hi> The Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſo ſhallow a Being, and the intent Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication with which he purſues Trifles, has made me carefully reflect upon that Sort of Men we uſually call an <hi>Impertinent:</hi> And I am, upon mature Deliberation, ſo far from being offended with him, that I am really obliged to him; for though he will take you aſide, and talk half an Hour upon Matters wholly inſignificant with the moſt ſolemn Air, yet I conſider, that theſe Things are of Weight in his Imagination, and he thinks he is communicating what is for my Service. If therefore it be a juſt Rule, to judge of a Man by his Intention, according to the Equity of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breeding, he that is impertinently kind or wiſe, to do you Service, ought in Return to have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Place both in your Aff ction and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem; ſo that the courteous <hi>Umbra</hi> deſerves the Favour of all his Acquaintance; for though he never ſerv'd 'em, he is ever willing to do it, and believes he does it.</p>
               <p>As impotent Kindneſs is to be returned with all our Abilities to oblige; ſo impotent Malice is to be treated with all our Force to depreſs it. For this Reaſon, <hi>Fly-Blow</hi> (who is received in all the Families in Town through the Degeneracy and Iniquity of their Manners) is to be treated like a Knave, tho' he is one of the weakeſt of Fools: He has by Rote, and at Second hand, all that can be ſaid of any Man of Figure, Wit, and Virtue in Town. Name a Man of Worth, and this Creature tells you the worſt Paſſage of his Life. Speak of a beautiful Woman, and this Puppy will whiſper the next Man to him, tho' he has nothing to ſay of her. He is a <hi>Fly</hi> that feeds on the ſore Part, and would have nothing to live on, if the whole Body were in Health. You may know him by the Frequency of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0397200201:290"/>

               <p>The Approaches before <hi>Tournay</hi> have been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with great Succeſs; and our Advices from the Camp before that Place of the 11th Inſtant ſay, That they had already made a Lodgment on the Glacis.

               <p>AS I am call'd forth by the immenſe Love I bear to my Fellow Creatures, and the warm Inclination I feel within me, to ſtem, as far I can, the prevailing Torrent of Vice and Ignorance; ſo I cannot more properly purſue that noble Impulſe, than by ſetting forth the Excellence of Virtue and Knowledge in their native and beautiful Colours. For this Reaſon I made my late Excurſion to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where thoſe Qualities appear in their higheſt Luſtre, and are the only Pretences to Honour and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. Superiority is there given in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Men's Advancement in Wiſdom and Learning; and that juſt Rule of Life is ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally received among thoſe happy People, that you ſhall ſee an Earl walk bear-headed to the Son of the meaneſt Artificer, in Reſpect to ſeven Years more Worth and Knowledge than the Nobleman is poſſeſs'd of. In other Places they bow to Men's Fortunes, but here to their Underſtandings. It is not to be expreſs'd, how pleaſing the Order, the Diſcipline, the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Lives, is to a Philoſopher, who has, by many Years Experience in the World, learn'd to contemn every Thing but what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in this Manſion of ſelect and well-taught Spirits. The Magnificence of their Palaces, the Greatneſs of their Revenues, the Sweetneſs of their Groves and Retirements, ſeem equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0397200201:292"/>
for the Reſidence of Princes and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; and a Familiarity with Objects of Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, as well as Places of Receſs, prepares the Inhabitants with an Equanimity for their future Fortunes, whether humble or illuſtrious. How was I pleas'd when I look'd round at St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, and could, in the Faces of the ingenious Youth, ſee Miniſters of State, Chanſellors, Biſhops, and Judges. Here only is Humane Life! Here only the Life of Man is a Rational Being! Here Men underſtand and are employed in Works worthy their noble Nature. This tranſitory Being paſſes away in an Employment not unworthy a future State, the Contemplation of the great Decrees of Providence. Each Man lives as if he were to anſwer the Queſtions made to <hi>Job, Where waſt thou when I laid the Foundations of the Earth? Who ſhut up the Sea with Doors, and ſaid, Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhalt thou come, and no further?</hi> Such Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations make Life agreeable, make Death wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
               <p>But alas! I was torn from this noble Society by the Buſineſs of this dirty mean World, and the Cares of Fortune: For I was oblig'd to be in <hi>London</hi> againſt the 7th Day of the Term, and accordingly govern'd my ſelf by my <hi>Oxford</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack, and came laſt Night; but find, to my great Aſtoniſhment, that this ignorant Town began the Term on the 24th of the laſt Month, in Oppoſition to all the Learning and Aſtronomy of the famous Univerſity of which I have been ſpeaking; according to which, the Term cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was to commence on the 1ſt Inſtant. You may be ſure, a Man who has turn'd his Studies as I have, could not be miſtaken in Point of Time; for knowing I was come to Town in Term, I examin'd the paſſing Moments very narrowly, and called an eminent Aſtronomer to my Aſſiſtance. Upon very ſtrict Obſervation
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0397200201:293"/>
we ſound, that the Cold has been ſo ſevere this laſt Winter, (which is allow'd to have a benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Quality) that it retarded the Earth in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving round from <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> to this Seaſon full Seven Days and Two Seconds. My Learned Friend aſſured me further, That the Earth had lately received a Shog from a Comet that croſs'd its Vortex, which, if it had come Ten Degrees nearer us, had made us loſe this whole Term. I was indeed once of Opinion, That the <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Computation was the moſt regular, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eleven Days before the <hi>Julian;</hi> but am now fully convinc'd, that we ought to be Seven Days after the Chancellor and Judges, and Eighteen before the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that the <hi>Oxonion</hi> Computation is the beſt of the Three.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Reaſons which I have gather'd from Philoſophy and Nature; to which I can add other Circumſtances in Vindication of the Account of this Learned Body who publiſh'd this Almanack.</p>
               <p>It is notorious to Philoſophers, that Joy and Grief can haſten and delay Time. Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> is of Opinion, That a Man in great Miſery may ſo far loſe his Meaſures, as to think a Minute an Hour; or in Joy, make an Hour a Minute. Let us examine the preſent Caſe by this Rule, and we ſhall find, that the Cauſe of this general Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, has been the great Succeſs of the laſt Campaigne, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hopes of Peace. Stocks ran ſo high at the <hi>Change,</hi> that the Citizens had gain'd Three Days of the Courtiers; and we have indeed been ſo happy this Reign, that it the Univerſity did not rectify our Miſtakes, we ſhould think our ſelves but in the Second Year of Her pretent Majeſty. It would be endleſs to enumerate the many Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages that have happened by this Ignorance of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0397200201:294"/>
the Vulgar. All the Recognizances within the Dioceſe of <hi>Oxford</hi> have been forfeited, for not appearing on the Firſt Day of this Fictitious Term. The Univerſity has been Nonſuited in their Action againſt the Bookſellers for printing <hi>Clarendon</hi> in <hi>Quarto.</hi> Indeed what gives me the moſt quick Concern, is the Caſe of a poor Gentleman my Friend, who was t'other Day taken in Execution by a Set of ignorant Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs. He ſhould, it ſeems, have pleaded in the firſt Week of Term; but being a Maſter of Arts of <hi>Oxford,</hi> he would not recede from the <hi>Oxonian</hi> Computation. He ſhew'd Mr. <hi>Broad</hi> the <hi>Almanack,</hi> and the very Day when the Term began; but the mercileſs ignorant Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, againſt all Senſe and Learning, would hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him away. He went indeed quietly enough; but he has taken exact Notes of the Time of Arreſt, and ſufficient Witneſſes of his being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into Gaol; and has, by Advice of the Recorder of <hi>Oxford,</hi> brought his Action; and we doubt not but we ſhall pay 'em off with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and blemiſh the Reputation of Mr. <hi>Broad.</hi> We have one convincing Proof, which all that frequent the Courts of Juſtices are Witneſſes of: The Dog that comes conſtantly to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> on the Firſt Day of the Term, did not appear till the Firſt Day according to the <hi>Oxford Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack;</hi> whoſe Inſtinct I take to be a better Guide than Men's erroneous Opinions, which are uſually byaſs'd by Intereſt. I judge in this Caſe, as King <hi>Charles</hi> II. victual'd his Navy, with the Bread which one of his Dogs choſe of ſeveral Pieces thrown before him, rather than truſt to the Aſſeverations of the Victuallers. Mr. <hi>Cowper,</hi> and other learned Council, have already urg'd the Authority of this Almanack in Behalf of their Clients. We ſhall therefore go on with all Speed in our Cauſe; and doubt not, but Chancery will give at the End what

                     <p>I have never read of a Duel among the <hi>Romans;</hi> and yet their Nobility uſed more Liberty with their Tongues than one may do now without being challeng'd.</p>

                     <p>Perhaps the <hi>Romans</hi> were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that ill Language, and brutal Manners, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected only on thoſe who were guilty of them; and that a Man's Reputation was not at all clear'd by cutting the Perſon's Throat who had reflected upon it: But the Cuſtom of thoſe Times had fixed the Scandal in the Action; whereas now it lies in the Reproach.</p>

                     <p>And yet the only Sort of Duel that one can conceive to have been fought upon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives truly honourable and allowable, was that between the <hi>Horatii</hi> and <hi>Curiatii.</hi>

                     <p>Colonel <hi>Plume,</hi> Pray what was the Method of Single Combat in your Time among the Cavaliers? I ſuppoſe, that as the Uſe of Clothes continues, though the Faſhion of them
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0397200201:299"/>
has been mutable; ſo Duels, tho' ſtill in Uſe, have had in all Times their particular Modes of Performance.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>We had no conſtant Rule, but generally conducted our Diſpute and Tilt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the laſt that had happen'd between Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Reputation among the very Top Fellows for Bravery and Gallantry.</p>

                     <p>If the Faſhion of Quarrelling and Tilting was ſo often chang'd in your Time, Colonel <hi>Plume,</hi> a Man might fight, yet loſe his Credit for want of underſtanding the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Why, Sir <hi>Mark,</hi> in the Beginning of <hi>July,</hi> a Man would have been cenſur'd for want of Courage, or been thought indigent of the true Notions of Honour, if he had put up Words; which in the End of <hi>September</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one could not reſent without paſſing for a brutal and quarrelſome Fellow.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Your Men of nice Honour, Sir, were for avoiding all Cenſure of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which they ſuppos'd might be taken in a Rencounter; therefore they us'd Seconds, who were to ſee that all was upon the Square, and make a faithful Report of the whole Combat; but in a little Time it became a Faſhion for the Seconds to fight, and I'll tell you how it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>

                     <p>I was going to tell you, Mr. <hi>Sage,</hi> That one Cornet <hi>Modiſh</hi> had deſned his Friend, Captain <hi>Smart,</hi>'s Opinion in ſome Affair, but did not follow it; upon which Captain <hi>Smart</hi> ſent
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0397200201:300"/>
Major <hi>Adroit</hi> (a very Topping Fellow of thoſe Times) to the Perſon that had ſlighted his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The Major never enquired into the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, becauſe it was not the manner then among the very Topping Fellows; but got two Swords of an equal Length, and then waited upon Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net <hi>Modiſh,</hi> deſiring him to chooſe his Sword, and meet his Friend Captain <hi>Smart.</hi> Cornet <hi>Modiſh</hi> came with his Friend to the Place of Combat; there the Principals put on their Pumps, and ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Shirts, to ſhow they had nothing but what Men of Honour carry about 'em, and then engag'd.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir <hi>Mark.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>And did the Seconds ſtand by Sir?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Col. <hi>Plume.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>It was a received Cuſtom till that Time; but the Swords of thoſe Days being pretty long, and the Principals acting on both Sides upon the Defenſive, and the Morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing froſty, Major <hi>Adroit</hi> deſired that the other Second, who was alſo a very Topping Fellow, would try a Thruſt or Two only to keep them warm, till the Principals had decided the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which was agreed to by <hi>Modiſh</hi>'s Second, who preſently whipt <hi>Adroit</hi> through the Body, diſarm'd him, and then parted the Principals, who had receiv'd no Harm at all.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>Sage.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>But was not <hi>Adroit</hi> laugh'd at?</p>

                     <speaker>Col. <hi>Plume.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>On the Contrary, the very Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Fellows were ever after of Opinion. That no Man who deſerved that Character, could ſerve as a Second, without Fighting; and the Smarts and Modiſhes finding their Account in it, the Humour took without Oppoſition.</p>

                     <p>Pray Colonel, How long did that Faſhion continue?</p>

                     <speaker>Col. <hi>Plume.</hi>

                     <p>Not long neither, Mr. <hi>Sage;</hi> for as ſoon as it became a Faſhion, the very Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Fellows thought their Honour reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0397200201:301"/>
if they did not proffer themſelves as Seconds when any of their Friends had a Quarrel; ſo that ſometimes there were a Dozen of a Side.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir <hi>Mark.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Bleſs me! If that Cuſtom had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, we ſhould have been at a Loſs now for our very Pretty Fellows; for they ſeem to be the proper Men to officer, animate, and keep up an Army: But, pray Sir, How did that ſociable Manner of Tilting grow out of Mode?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Col. <hi>Plume.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Why, Sir, I'll tell you: It was a Law among the Combatants, That the Party which happen'd to have the firſt Man diſarm'd or kill'd, ſhould yield as vanquiſh'd; which ſome People thought might encourage the Modiſhes and Smarts in quarrelling, to the Deſtruction of only the very Topping Fellows; and as ſoon as this Reflection was ſtarted, the very Topping Fellows thought it an Incumbrance upon their Honour to fight at all themſelves. Since that Time, the Modiſhes and the Smarts, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Europe,</hi> have extoll'd the <hi>French</hi> King's Edict.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir <hi>Mark.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Our very pretty Fellows, whom I take to be the Succeſſors of the very Topping Fellows, think a Quarrel ſo little Faſhionable, that they will not be expos'd to it by another Man's Vanity, or Want of Senſe.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>Sage.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>But, Colonel, I have obſerv'd in your Account of Duels, that there was a great Exactneſs in avoiding all Advantage that might poſſibly be between the Combatants.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Col. <hi>Plume.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>That's true, Sir; for the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons were always equal.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>Sage.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Yes, Sir; but ſuppoſe an active, adroit, ſtrong Man, had inſulted an aukward, or a feeble, or an unpractis'd Swords-man.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Col. <hi>Plume.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Then, Sir, they fought with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols.</p>
                  </sp>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>But, Sir, there might be a certain Advantage that Way; for a good Marks-man will be ſure to hit his Man at 20 Yards Diſtance; and a Man whoſe Hand ſhakes (which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Men that debauch in Pleaſures, or have not us'd Piſtols out of their Holſters) won't venture to fire, unleſs he touches the Perſon he ſhoots at. Now, Sir, I am of Opinion, that one can get no Honour in killing a Man (if one has it all Rug) as the Gameſters ſay, when they have a Trick to make the Game ſecure, though they ſeem to play upon the Square.</p>

                     <p>In Truth, Mr. <hi>Sage,</hi> I think ſuch a Fact muſt be Murder in a Man's own private Conſcience, whatever it may appear to the World.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>I have known ſome Men ſo nice, that they would not fight but upon a Cloak without Piſtols.</p>

                     <p>I believe a Cuſtom, well eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would outdo the Grand Monarch's Edict.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>And Bullies would then leave off their long Swords; but I don't find that a very Pretty Fellow can ſtay to change his Sword, when he is inſulted by a Bully with a long Diego, tho' his own at the ſame Time be no longer than a Pen-knife; which will certainly be the Caſe, if ſuch little Swords are in Mode.

He has inſerted in his Plea ſome Things which I fear will give Offence, for he pretends to argue, that tho' a Man has a little of the Knave mix'd with the Fool, he is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs liable to the Loſs of Goods; and makes the Abuſe of Reaſon as juſt an Avoidance of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate as the total Abſence of it. This is what can never paſs; but witty Men are ſo full of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that there is no perſwading 'em; and my Friend will not be convinc'd, but that upon quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Solomon,</hi> who always uſed the Word <hi>Fool</hi> as a Term of the ſame Signification with Unjuſt, and makes all Deviation from Goodneſs and Virtue to come under the Notion of <hi>Folly,</hi> I ſay he doubts not, but by the Force of this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, let his Ideot Uncle appear never ſo great a Knave, he ſhall prove him a Fool at the ſame Time.</p>
               <p>This Affair led the Company here into an Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of theſe Points; and none coming here but Wits, what was aſſerted by a young Lawyer, that a Lunatick is in the Care of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> but a Fool in that of the Crown, was received with general Indignation. <q rend="inline">'Why that? ſays old <hi>Renault.</hi> Why that? Why muſt a Fool be a Courtier more than a Madman? This is the Iniquity of this dull Age: I remember the Time when it went on the mad Side; all your Top Wits were Scowrers, Rakes, Roarers, and Demoliſhers of Windows. I knew a mad Lord who was drunk five Years together, and was the Envy of that Age; who is faintly imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the dull Pretenders to Vice and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this.

This is (ſaid he) Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> a proper Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for you to treat in your Article from this Place; and if you would ſend your <hi>Pacolet</hi> into all our Brains, you would find, that a little Fibre or Valve, ſcarce diſcernable, makes the Diſtinction between a Politician and an Ideot.

Shall this unfortunate Man be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of his Eſtate, becauſe he is tractable and indolent, runs in no Man's Debt, invades no Man's Bed, nor ſpends the Eſtate he owes his Children and his Character; when one who ſhews no Senſe above him, but in ſuch Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhall be eſteem'd in his Senſes, and poſſibly may pretend to the Guardianſhip of him who is no Ways his Inferior, but in being leſs wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?

               <p>Letters from the <hi>Hague</hi> of the 16th Inſtant, <hi>N. S.</hi> ſay, That the Siege of <hi>Tournay</hi> went on with all imaginable Succeſs; and that there has been no manner of Stop given to the Attempts of the Confederates ſince they undertook it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that by an Accident of Firing a Piece of Ordnance it burſt, and kill'd 15 or 16 Men. The <hi>French</hi> Army is ſtill in the Camp of <hi>Lens,</hi> and goes on in improving their Intrenchments. When the laſt Advices came away, it was believed the Town of <hi>Tournay</hi> would be in the Hands of the Confederates by the End of this Month. Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> inform us, That they have an Account of a great Action between the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents in the <hi>Vivarez,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King's Forces under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelaure,</hi> in which Engagement there were Eighteen Hundred Men Kill'd on the Spot. They add, That all Sorts of People who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Oppreſſion or Diſcontent do daily join the <hi>Vivarois;</hi> and that their preſent Body of Men in Arms conſiſted of Six Thouſand. This ſudden Inſurrection has put the Court of <hi>France</hi> under great Difficulties; and the King has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Orders, That the main Body of his Troops in <hi>Spain</hi> ſhall withdraw into his own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

where they are to be quartered in ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries as have of late diſcovered an Inclination to take up Arms: The Calamities of that Kingdom, being ſuch, that the People are not by any Means to be kept in Obedience, except by the Terror of Military Execution. What makes the Diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſtill greater, is, That the Court begins to be doubtful of their Troops, ſome Regiments in the Action of the <hi>Cevennes</hi> having faced about againſt their Officers; and after the Battle was over, join'd the Malecontents. Upon receiving Advice of this Battle, the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached Twelve Battalions into thoſe Parts, and began to add new Works to his Intrenchments near <hi>Brianzon,</hi> in order to defend his Camp, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being weakened by ſending ſo great a Rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement into the <hi>Cevennes.</hi> Letters from <hi>Spain</hi> ſay, That the Dutcheſs of <hi>Anjou</hi> was lately deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a Second Son.

               <p>Much might be ſaid for the Improvement of this Syſtem; which, for its Style and Invention, may inſtruct Generals and their Hiſtorians, both in fighting a Battle, and deſcribing it when 'tis over.

               <p>Some Part of the Company keep up the old Way of Converſation in this Place, which uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned upon the Examination of Nature, and an Enquiry into the Manners of Men.

Have the News-Papers mentioned that Matter? But, pray, Can you tell me what Method will be taken to provide for theſe</hi> Palatines? <hi>But this,</hi> as you ſay, <hi>Time will clear.

This led my Friend and me to weigh this wandring Manner in many other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and he took out of his Pockets ſeveral little Notes or Tickets to ſollicit for Votes to Employments: As, <q rend="inline">"Mr. <hi>John Taplaſh</hi> having ſerved all Offices, and being reduced to great Poverty, deſires your Vote for Singing-Clerk of this Pariſh.

               <p>LOoking over ſome old Papers, I found a little Treatiſe, written by my Great-Grandfather, concerning <hi>Bribery,</hi> and thought his Manner of treating that Subject not unworthy my Remark. He there has a Digreſſion concerning a Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that in ſome Circumſtances a Man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Injury, and yet be conſcious to himſelf that he deſerves it. There are abundance of fine Things ſaid on the Subject; but the whole wrap'd up in ſo much Jingle and Pun, (which was the Wit of thoſe Times) that it is ſcarce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible; but I thought the Deſign was well enough in the following Sketch of the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Poetry: For in this Caſe, where Two are Rivals for the ſame Thing, and propoſe to obtain it by Preſents, he that attempts the Judge's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, by making him Offers of Reward, ought not to complain when he loſes his Cauſe by a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Bidder. The good old Dogrel runs thus:</p>

               <p>The Diſcourſe happen'd this Evening to fall upon Characters drawn in Plays, and a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man remark'd, That there was no Method in the World of knowing the Taſte of an Age, or Period of Time ſo good, as by the Obſervations of the Perſons repreſented in their Comedies. There were ſeveral Inſtances produced, as <hi>Ben. Johnſon</hi>'s bringing in a Fellow ſmoaking as a Piece of Foppery; but, ſaid the Gentleman, (who entertain'd us on this Subject) this Matter is no where ſo obſervable as in the Difference of the Characters of Women on the Stage in the laſt Age, and in this. It is not to be ſuppoſed that it was a Poverty of Genius in <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> that his Women made ſo ſmall a Figure in his Dialogues; but it certainly is, that he drew Women as they then were in Life; for that Sex had not in thoſe Days that Freedom in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; and their Characters were only, that they were Mothers, Siſters, Daughters, and Wives. There were not then among the Ladies, ſhining Wits, Politicians, Virtuoſae, Free-Thinkers, and Diſputants; nay, there was then hardly ſuch a Creature ev'n as a Coquet: But Vanity had quite another Turn, and the moſt conſpicuous
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0397200201:323"/>
Woman at that Time of Day was only the beſt Houſewife. Were it poſſible to bring into Life an Aſſembly of Matrons of that Age, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the learned Lady <hi>Woodby</hi> into their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they would not believe the ſame Nation could produce a Creature ſo unlike any Thing they ever ſaw in it.</p>
               <p>But theſe Ancients would be as much aſtoniſh'd to ſee in the ſame Age ſo illuſtrious a Pattern to all who love Things Praiſe-worthy, as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Aſpaſia.</hi> Methinks, I now ſee her walking in her Garden like our firſt Parent, with unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Charms, before Beauty had Spectators, and bearing celeſtial conſcious Virtue in her Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. Her Countenance is the lively Picture of her Mind, which is the Seat of Honour, Truth, Compaſſion, Knowledge, and Innocence.
<q>
                     <l>There dwells the Scorn of Vice and Pity too.</l>
                  </q>
In the Midſt of the moſt ample Fortune, and Veneration of all that behold and know her, without the leaſt Affectation, ſhe conſults Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, the Contemplation of her own Being, and that ſupreme Power which beſtowed it. Without the Learning of Schools, or Knowledge of a long Courſe of Arguments, ſhe goes on in a ſteady Courſe of uninterrupted Piety and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and adds to the Severity and Privacy of the laſt Age all the Freedom and Eaſe of this. The Language and Mien of a Court ſhe is poſſeſſed of in the higheſt Degree; but the Simplicity and humble Thoughts of a Cottage, are her more welcome Entertainments. <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> is a Female Philoſopher, who does not only live up to the Reſignation of the moſt retired Lives of the ancient Sages, but alſo to the Schemes and Plans which they thought beautiful, tho' inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. This Lady is the moſt exact Oeconomiſt, without appearing buſie; the moſt ſtrictly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0397200201:324"/>
without taſting the Praiſe of it; and ſhuns Applauſe with as much Induſtry, as others do Reproach. This Character is ſo particular, that it will very eaſily be fixed on her only, by all that know her: But I dare ſay, ſhe will be the laſt that finds it out.</p>
               <p>But, alas! If we have One or Two ſuch La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, How many Dozens are there like the reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Polugloſſa,</hi> who is acquainted with all the World but her ſelf; who has the Appearance of all, and Poſſeſſion of no one Virtue: She has indeed in her Practice the Abſence of Vice, but her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is the continual Hiſtory of it; and it is apparent, when ſhe ſpeaks of the criminal Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of others, that her Innocence is only a Reſtraint, with a certain Mixture of Envy. She is ſo perfectly oppoſite to the Character of <hi>Aſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> that as Vice is terrible to her only as it is the Object of Reproach, ſo Virtue is agreeable only as it is attended with Applauſe.</p>

               <p>We were upon the Heroick Strain this Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Queſtion was, What is the True Sublime? Many very good Diſcourſes happen'd thereupon; after which a Gentleman at the Table, who is, it ſeems, writing on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, aſſum'd the Argument; and tho' he ran thro' many Inſtances of Sublimity from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writers, ſaid, He had hardly known an Occaſion wherein the true Greatneſs of Soul, which animates a General in Action, is ſo well repreſented, with Regard to the Perſon of whom it was ſpoken, and the Time in which it was writ, as in a few Lines in a modern Poem: There is (continued he) nothing ſo forc'd and conſtrain'd, as what we frequently meet with in Tragedies; to make a Man under the Weight of a great Sorrow, or full of Meditation upon what he is ſoon to execute, caſt about for a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile to what he himſelf is, or the Thing which he is going to act: But there is nothing more proper and natural for a Poet, whoſe Buſineſs is to deſcribe, and who is Spectator of one in that Circumſtance when his Mind is working upon a great Image, and that the Idea's hurry upon his Imagination; I ſay, there is nothing ſo natural, as for a Poet to relieve and clear himſelf from the Burthen of Thought at that Time, by uttering his Conception in Simile and Metaphor. The higheſt Act of the Mind of Man, is to poſſeſs it ſelf with Tranquility in eminent Danger, and to have its Thoughts ſo free, as to act at that Time without Perplexity. The ancient Authors have compared this ſedate Courage to a Rock that remains immoveable
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0397200201:332"/>
amidſt the Rage of Winds and Waves; but that is too ſtupid and inanimate a Similitude, and could do no Credit to the Hero. At other Times they are all of 'em wonderfully obliged to a <hi>Lybian</hi> Lion, which may give indeed very agreeable Terrors to a Deſcription; but is no Compliment to the Perſon to whom it is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Eagles, Tygers, and Wolves, are made Uſe of on the ſame Occaſion, and very often with much Beauty; but this is ſtill an Honour done to the Brute, rather than the Hero. <hi>Mars, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, Bacchus,</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> have each of 'em furniſh'd very good Similes in their Time, and made, doubtleſs, a greater Impreſſion on the Mind of a Heathen, than they have on that of a modern Reader. But the ſublime Image that I am talking of, and which I really think as great as ever enter'd into the Thought of Man, is in the Poem call'd, <hi>The Campaign;</hi> where the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile of a miniſtring Angel ſets forth the moſt ſedate and the moſt active Courage, engaged in an Uproar of Nature, a Confuſion of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and a Scene of Divine Vengeance. Add to all, That theſe Lines compliment the General and his Queen at the ſame Time, and have all the natural Horrors, heighten'd by the Image that was ſtill freſh in the Mind of every Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

               <p>The whole Poem is ſo exquiſitely Noble and Poetick, that I think it an Honour to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Language. The Gentleman concluded his Critick on this Work, by ſaying, that he eſteemed it wholly new, and a wonderful At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to keep up the ordinary Idea's of a March of an Army, juſt as they happen'd in ſo warm and great a Style, and yet be at once Familiar and Heroick. Such a Performance is a Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle as well as a Poem, and will preſerve the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of our Hero, when all the Edifices and Statues erected to his Honour are blended with common Duſt.</p>

               <p>THIS Day, paſſing through <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> I was ſtopp'd in the Piazza by <hi>Pacolet,</hi> to obſerve what he called the Triumph of Love and Youth.

I asked im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, What young Heir or Lover own'd that glittering Equipage? But my Companion interrupted: Do not you ſee there the mourning <hi>Aeſculapius?</hi> The Mourning! ſaid I. Yes <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſaid <hi>Pacolet,</hi> He is in deep Mourning, and is the languiſhing hopeleſs Lover of the divine <hi>Hebe,</hi> the Emblem of Youth and Beauty. The excellent and

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> moſt powerful of all Things:</p>
               <p>You are not ſo ignorant as to be a Stranger to the Character of <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> as the Patron and moſt ſucceſsful of all who profeſs the Art of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. But as moſt of his Operations are owing to a natural Sagacity or Impulſe, he has very little troubled himſelf with the Doctrine of Drugs; but has always given Nature more Room to help her ſelf, than any of her learned Aſſiſtants; and conſequently has done greater Wonders than is in the Power of Art to perform: For which Reaſon he is half deify'd by the People; and has ever been juſtly courted by all the World, as if he were a Seventh Son.</p>
               <p>It happen'd, that the charming <hi>Hebe</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, by a long and violent Fever, to the moſt extreme Danger of Death; and when all Skill fail'd, they ſent for <hi>Aeſculapius.</hi> The renowned Artiſt was touch'd with the deepeſt Compaſſion to ſee the faded Charms and faint Bloom of <hi>Hebe;</hi> and had a generous Concern in beholding a Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, not between Life, but rather between Youth and Death. All his Skill and his Paſſion tended to the Recovery of <hi>Hebe,</hi> beautiful even in Sickneſs: But, alas! the unhappy Phyſician knew not, that in all his Care he was only ſharpening Darts for his own Deſtruction. In a Word, his Fortune was the ſame with that of the Statuary, who fell in Love with the Image of his own making; and the unfortunate <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> is become the Patient of her whom he lately recovered. Long before this Diſaſter, <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> was far gone in the unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and ſuperfluous Amuſements of old Age, in increaſing unweildy Stores, and providing, in the midſt of an Incapacity of Enjoyment of what he had, for a Supply of more Wants than he had Calls for in Youth it ſelf. But theſe low Conſiderations
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0397200201:336"/>
are now no more, and Love has taken Place of Avarice, or rather is become an Avarice of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kind, which ſtill urges him to purſue what he does not want. But behold the Matamorphoſis; the anxious mean Cares of an Uſurer are turned into the Languiſhments and Complaints of a Lover. Behold, ſays the aged <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, I own, great Love, thy Empire: Pity, <hi>Hebe,</hi> the Fop you have made: What have I to do with Guilding but on Pills? Yet, O Fair! For thee I ſit amidſt a Crowd of painted Deities on my Chariot, button'd in Gold, claſp'd in Gold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any Value for that beloved Metal, but as it adorns the Perſon, and laces the Hat of thy dying Lover. I ask not to live, O <hi>Hebe!</hi> Give me but gentle Death: <hi>Euthanaſia, Eutha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſia,</hi> that is all I implore. When <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> had finiſhed his Complaint, <hi>Pacolet</hi> went on in deep Morals on the Incertainty of Riches with this remarkable Exclamation; O Wealth! How im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent art thou? And how little doſt thou ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply us with real Happineſs, when the Uſurer himſelf can forget thee for the Love of what is as foreign to his Felicity as thou art?</p>

               <p>THE other Day I took a Walk a Mile or Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out of Town, and ſtrolling wherever Chance led me, I was inſenſibly carried into a By-Road, along which was a very agreeable Quickſet, of an extraordinary Height, which ſurrounded a very delicious Seat and Garden. From one Angle of the Hedge, I heard a Voice cry, Sir, Sir—This rais'd my Curioſity, and I heard the ſame Voice ſay, but in a gentle Tone, Come forward, come forward. I did ſo, and one through the Hedge called me by my Name, and bad me go on to the Left, and I ſhould be admitted to viſit an old Acquaintance in Diſtreſs. The Laws of Knight Errantry made me obey the Summons without Heſitation; and I was let in at the Back-Gate of a lovely Houſe by a Maid-Servant, who carried me from Room to Room, till I came into a Gallery; at the End of which, I ſaw a fine Lady dreſſed in the moſt ſumptuous Habit, as if ſhe were going to a Ball, but with the moſt abject and diſconſolate Sorrow in her Face
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0397200201:341"/>
that I ever beheld. As I came near, ſhe burſt into Tears, and cry'd, Sir, Do not you know the unhappy <hi>Teraminta?</hi> I ſoon recollected her whole Perſon: But (ſaid I) Madam, The Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Dreſs, in which I have ever ſeen you at your good Father's Houſe, and the Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Countenance with which you always appeared, are ſo unlike the Faſhion and Temper you are now in, that I did not eaſily recover the Memory of you. Your habit was then decent and modeſt, your Looks ſerene and beautiful: Whence then this unaccountable Change? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſpeak ſo deep a Sorrow as your preſent Aſpect; yet your Dreſs is made for Jollity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling. It is (ſaid ſhe) an unſpeakable Pleaſure to meet with one I know, and to bewail my ſelf to any that is not an utter Stranger to Humanity.</p>
               <p>When your Friend my Father died, he left me to a wide World, with no Defence againſt the Inſults of Fortune, but rather, a Thouſand Snares to intrap me in the Dangers to which Youth and Innocence are expoſed, in an Age wherein Honour and Virtue are become mere Words, and uſed only as they ſerve to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray thoſe who underſtand them in their native Senſe, and obey them as the Guides and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of their Being. The wickedeſt of all Men living, the abandoned <hi>Decius,</hi> who has no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any good Art or Purpoſe of Humane Life, but as it tends to the Satisfaction of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, had Opportunities of frequently ſeeing and entertaining me at a Houſe where mixed Company boarded, and where he placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the baſe Intention which he has ſince brought to paſs. <hi>Decius</hi> ſaw enough in me to raiſe his brural Deſires, and my Circumſtances gave him Hopes of accompliſhing them. But a l the glittering Expectations he could lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, joined by my private Terrors of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0397200201:342"/>
it ſelf, could not for ſome Months prevail upon me; yet however I hated his Intention, I ſtill had a ſecret Satisfaction in his Courtſhip, and always expoſed my ſelf to his Solicitations. See here the Bane of our Sex! Let the Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be never ſo apparent, the Flatterer never ſo ill thought of, his Praiſes are ſtill agreeable, and we contribute to our own Deceit. I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever fond of all Opportunities and Pretences of being in his Company. In a Word, I was at laſt ruined by him, and brought to this Place, where I have been ever ſince immur'd; and from the fatal Day after my Fall from Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, my Worſhipper became my Maſter and my Tyrant.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee me habited in the moſt gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Manner, not in Honour of me as a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he loves, but as this Attire charms his own Eye, and urges him to repeat the Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation he takes in me, as the Servant of his brutiſh Luſts and Appetites. I know not where to fly for Redreſs; but am here pining away Life in the Solitude and Severity of a Nun, but the Conſcience and Guilt of an Harlot. I live in this lewd Practice with a Religious Awe of my Miniſter of Darkneſs, upbraided with the Support I receive from him, for the ineſtimable Poſſeſſion of Youth, of Innocence, of Honour, and of Conſcience. I ſee, Sir, my Diſcourſe grows painful to you, all I beg of you is, to paint in ſo ſtrong Colours, as to let <hi>Decius</hi> ſee I am diſcovered to be in his Poſſeſſion, that I may be turned out of this deteſtable Scene of regular Iniquity, and either think no more, or ſin no more. If your Writings have the good Effect of gaining my Enlargement, I promiſe you I will atone for this unhappy Step, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring an innocent laborious Poverty, to all the guilty Affluence the World can offer me.</p>

               <p>I am got hither ſafe, but never ſpent Time with ſo little Satisfaction as this Evening; for you muſt know, I was Five Hours with Three <hi>Merry,</hi> and Two <hi>Honeſt Fellows.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſang Catches; and the latter even died with laughing at the Noiſe they made. Well, (ſays <hi>Tom Belfrey</hi>) You Scholars, Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> are the worſt Company in the World. Ay, (ſays his Oppoſite) You are dull to Night; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee be merry. With that I huzza'd, and took a Jump croſs the Table, then came clever upon my Legs, and fell a laughing. Let Mr. <hi>Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff</hi> alone (ſays one of the <hi>Honeſt Fellows</hi>), when he's in a good Humour, he's as good Company as any Man in <hi>England.</hi> He had no ſooner ſpoke, but I ſnatched his Hat off his Head, and clap'd it upon my own, and burſt out a laughing again; upon which we all fell a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for half an Hour. One of the <hi>Honeſt Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi> got behind me in the Interim, and hit me a ſound Slap on the Back; upon which he got the Laugh out of my Hands, and it was ſuch a Twang on my Shoulders, that I confeſs he was much merrier than I. I was half angry; but reſolved to keep up the good Humour of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0397200201:346"/>
the Company; and after hollowing as loud as I could poſſibly, I drank off a Bumper of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, that made me ſtare again. Nay, (ſays one of the <hi>Honeſt Fellows</hi>) Mr. <hi>Iſaac</hi> is in the Right, there is no Converſation in this; What fignifies Jumping, or hitting one another on the Back? Let's drink about. We did ſo from Seven a Clock till Eleven; and now I am come hither, and, after the Manner of the wiſe <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> begin to reflect upon the Paſſages of the Day. I remember nothing, but that I am bruiſed to Death; and as it is my Way to write down all the good Things I have heard in the laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to furniſh my Paper, I can from this only tell you my Sufferings, and my Bangs.</p>
               <p>I nam'd <hi>Pythagoras</hi> juſt now, and I proteſt to you, as he believ'd Men after Death enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other Species, I am now and then tempted to think other Animals enter into Men, and could name ſeveral on Two Legs, that never diſcover any Sentiment above what is common with the Species of a lower Kind; as we ſee in theſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Wits whom I was with to Night, whoſe Parts conſiſt in Strength and Activity; but their boiſterous Mirth gives me great Impatience for the Return of ſuch Happineſs as I enjoyed in a Converſation laſt Week. Among others in that Company, we had <hi>Florio,</hi> who never interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any Man living when he was ſpeaking; or ever ceaſed to ſpeak, but others lamented that he had done. His Diſcourſe ever ariſes from a Fulneſs of the Matter before him, and not from Oſtentation or Triumph of his Underſtanding; for though he ſeldom delivers what he need fear being repeated, he ſpeaks without having that End in View; and his Forbearance of Calumny or Bitterneſs, is owing rather to his good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than his Diſcretion; for which Reaſon, he is eſteem'd a Gentleman perfectly qualified for
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0397200201:347"/>
Converſation, in whom a general Good-will to Mankind takes off the Neceſſity of Caution and Circumſpection.</p>
               <p>We had at the ſame Time that Evening the beſt Sort of Companion that can be, a good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured old Man. This Perſon meets in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of young Men, Veneration for his Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and is not only valued for the good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of which he is Maſter, but reaps an Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the Pardon he gives to other Men Faults: And the ingenious Sort of Men with whom he converſes, have ſo juſt a Regard for him, that he rather is an Example, than a Check to their Behaviour. For this Reaſon, as <hi>Senecio</hi> never pretends to be a Man of Pleaſure before Youth, ſo young Men never ſet up for Wiſdom before <hi>Senecio;</hi> ſo that you never meet, where he is, thoſe Monſters of Converſation, who are grave or gay above their Years. He never converſes but with Followers of Nature and good Senſe, where all that is uttered is only the Effect of a communicable Temper, and not of Emulation to excel their Companions; all Deſire of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority being a Contradiction to that Spirit which makes a juſt Converſation, the very Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of which is mutual Good-will. Hence it is, that I take it for a Rule, that the natural, and not the acquired Man, is the Companion. Learning, Wit, Gallantry, and good Breeding, are all but ſubordinate Qualities in Society, and are of no Value, but as they are ſubſervient to Benevolence, and tend to a certain Manner of being or appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal to the reſt of the Company; for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is compoſed of an Aſſembly of Men, as they are Men, and not as they are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Fortune: Therefore he that brings his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with him into Converſation, ſhould always pay the Reckoning; for he came to receive Homage, and not to meet his Friends.—But

               <p>WE ſee every Day Volumes written againſt that Tyrant of Humane Life called <hi>Love,</hi> and yet there is no Help found againſt his Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or Barrier againſt the Inroads he is pleaſed to make into the Mind of Man. After this Preface, you will expect I am going to give par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Inſtances of what I have aſſerted. That Expectation cannot be raiſed too high for the Novelty of the Hiſtory, and Manner of Life, of the Emperor <hi>Aurengezebe,</hi> who has reſided for ſome Years in the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> with the Air and Mien indeed of his Imperial Quality, but the Equipage and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment only of a private Gentleman. This Potentate, for a long Series of Time, appeared from the Hour of Twelve till that of Two at a Coffee-houſe near the <hi>Change,</hi> and had a Seat (though without a Canopy) ſacred to himſelf,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0397200201:349"/>
where he gave diurnal Audiences concerning Commerce, Politicks, Tare and Tret, Uſury and Abatement, with all Things neceſſary for helping the Diſtreſſed, who are willing to give one Limb for the better Maintenance of the reſt; or ſuch joyous Youths, whoſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy is confined to the preſent Hour, and were deſirous to call in the Revenue of next half Year to double the Enjoyment of this. Long did this growing Monarch employ himſelf after this Manner: And as Alliances are neceſſary to all great Kingdoms, he took particularly the Intereſts of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth into his Care and Protection. When all Mankind were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking that unhappy Monarch, and thoſe who had neither Valour or Wit to oppoſe againſt him, would be ſtill ſhowing their impotent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice by laying Wagers in Oppoſition to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, <hi>Aurengezebe</hi> ever took the Part of his Contemporary, and laid immenſe Treaſures on his Side in Defence of his important Magazine of <hi>Toulon. Aurengezebe</hi> alſo had all this while a conſtant Intelligence with <hi>India,</hi> and his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were anſwered in Jewels, which he ſoon made Brillant, and cauſed to be affixed to his Imperial Caſtor, which he always wears cock'd in Front, to ſhow his Defiance; with an Hear of Imperial Snuff in the Middle of his ample Viſage, to ſhow his Sagacity. The Zealots, for this little Spot called <hi>Great Britain,</hi> fell uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally into this Emperor's Policies, and paid Homage to his ſuperior Genius, in forfeiting their Coffers to his Treaſury.</p>
               <p>But Wealth and Wiſdom are Poſſeſſions too ſolemn not to give Wearineſs to active Minds, without the Relief (in vacant Hours) of Wit and Love, which are the proper Amuſements of the Powerful and the Wiſe: This Emperor therefore, with great Regularity, every Day at Five in the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0397200201:350"/>
Afternoon, leaves his Money-Changers, his Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans, and little Hoarders of Wealth, to their low Purſuits, and aſcends his Chariot to drive to <hi>Will</hi>'s; where the Taſte is refined, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh given to Mens Poſſeſſions, by a polite Skill in gratifying their Paſſions and Appetites. There it is that the Emperor has learned to live and to love, and not, like a Miſer, to gaze only on his Ingots or his Treaſures; but with a nobler Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, to live the Admiration of others, for his Splendour and Happineſs in being Maſter of them. But a Prince is no more to be his own Caterer in his Love, than in his Food; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Aurengezebe</hi> has ever in waiting Two Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors for his Diſhes, and his Wenches for his retired Hours, by whom the Scene of his Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is prepared in the following Manner.</p>
               <p>There is near <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> a Street known by the Name of <hi>Drury,</hi> which, before the Days of Chriſtianity, was purchaſed by the Queen of <hi>Paphos,</hi> and is the only Part of <hi>Great Britain</hi> where the Tenure of Vaſſalage is ſtill in Being. All that long Courſe of Building is under par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Diſtricts or Ladiſhips, after the Manner of Lordſhips in other Parts, over which Matrons of known Abilities preſide, and have, for the Support of their Age and Infirmities, certain Taxes paid out of the Rewards of the amorous Labours of the Young. This Seraglio of <hi>Great Britain</hi> is diſpoſed into convenient Allies and Apartments, and every Houſe, from the Cellar to the Garret, inhabited by Nymphs of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Orders, that Perſons of every Rank may be accommodated with an immediate Conſort, to allay their Flames, and partake of their Cares. Here it is, that when <hi>Aurengezebe</hi> thinks fit to give a Looſe to Dalliance, the Purveyors prepare the Entertainment; and what makes it more
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0397200201:351"/>
auguſt is, that every Perſon concerned in the Interlude has his ſet Part, and the Prince ſends before-hand Word what he deſigns to ſay, and directs alſo the very Anſwer which ſhall be made to him.</p>
               <p>It has been before hinted, that this Emperor has a continual Commerce with <hi>India;</hi> and it is to be noted, that the largeſt Stone that rich Earth has produced, is in our <hi>Aurengezebe</hi>'s Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
               <p>But all Things are now diſpoſed for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. At his Entrance into the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> a Servant delivers him his Bever of State and Love, on which is fixed this ineſtimable Jewel as his Diadem. When he is ſeated, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors, <hi>Pandarus</hi> and <hi>Nuncio,</hi> marching on each Side of the Matron of the Houſe, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce her into his Preſence. In the midſt of the Room, they bow all together to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</p>
               <p>When the Matron—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoever thou art, (as thy awful Aſpect ſpeaks thee a Man of Power) be propitious to this Manſus of Love, and let not the Severity of thy Wiſdom diſdain, that by the Repreſentation of naked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, or paſtoral Figures, we revive in thee the Memory at leaſt of that Power of</hi> Venus, <hi>to which all the Wiſe and the Brave are ſome Part of their Lives devoted. Aurengezebe</hi> conſents by a Nod, and they go out backward.</p>
               <p>After this, an unhappy Nymph, who is to be ſuppoſed juſt eſcaped from the Hands of a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher, with her Treſſes diſhevel'd, runs into the Room with a Dagger in her Hand, and falls before the Emperor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pity, Oh! pity! whoever thou art, an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Virgin, whom one of the Train has robbed of her Innocence; her Innocence, which was all her</hi>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:0397200201:352"/>
                  <hi>Portion—Or rather, let me die like the memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Lucretia—Upon which ſhe ſtabs her ſelf. The Body is immediately examined after the Manner of our Coroners. <hi>Lucretia</hi> recovers by a Cup of right <hi>Nants;</hi> and the Matron, who is her next Relation, ſtops all Proceſs at Law.</p>
               <p>This unhappy Affair is no ſooner over, but a naked Mad-woman breaks into the Room, calls for her Duke, her Lord, her Emperor. As ſoon as ſhe ſpies <hi>Aurengezebe,</hi> the Object of all her Fury and Love, ſhe calls for Petticoats, is ready to ſink with Shame, and is dreſſed in all haſte in new Attire at his Charge. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Accident of the Mad-woman, makes <hi>Aurengezebe</hi> curious to know, whether others who are in their Senſes can gueſs at his Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For which Reaſon the whole Convent is examined one by one. The Matron marches in with a tawdry Country Girl—Pray <hi>Winifred,</hi> (ſays ſhe) Who do you think that fine Man with thoſe Jewels and Pearls is?—I believe (ſays <hi>Winifred</hi>) it is our Landlord—It muſt be the Squire himſelf—The Emperor laughs at her Simplicity—Go Fool, ſays the Matron: Then turning to the Emperor—Your Greatneſs will pardon her Ignorance! After her, ſeveral others of different Characters are inſtructed to miſtake who he is in the ſame Manner: Then the whole Siſterhood are called together, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror riſes, and cocking his Hat, declares, He is the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> and they his Concubines. A general Murmur goes through the Aſſembly, and <hi>Aurengezebe</hi> certifying, that he keeps them for State rather than Uſe; tells them, they are permitted to receive all Men into their Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; then proceeds through the Crowd, among whom he throws Medals ſhaped like Half-Crowns, and returns to his Chariot.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:0397200201:353"/>
This being all that paſſed the laſt Day a which <hi>Aurengezebe</hi> viſited the Women's Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I conſulted <hi>Pacolet</hi> concerning the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſuch ſtrange Amuſements in old Age: To which he anſwer'd; You may remember, when I gave you an Account of my good Fortune in being drowned on the 30th Day of my Humane Life, I told you of the Diſaſters I ſhould otherwiſe have met with before I arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the End of my <hi>Stamen,</hi> which was Sixty Years. I may now add an Obſervation to you, That all who exceed that Period, except the latter Part of it is ſpent in the Exerciſe of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Contemplation of Futurity, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily fall into an Indecent old Age, becauſe, with Regard to all the Enjoyments of the Years of Vigour and Manhood, Childhood returns upon them: And as Infants ride on Sticks, build Houſes in Dirt, and make Ships in Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by a faint Idea of Things they are to act hereafter; ſo old Men play the Lovers, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, and Emperors, from the decaying Image of the more perfect Performances of their ſtronger Years: Therefore be ſure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> and <hi>Aurengezebe</hi> in your next Bill of Mortality of the Metaphorically De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct.</p>

               <p>As ſoon as I came hither this Evening, no leſs than Ten People produced the following Poem, which they all reported was ſent to each of them by the Penny-Poſt from an unknown Hand. All the Battle-Writers in the Room were in Debate, who could be the Author of a Piece ſo martially written; and every Body ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded the Addreſs and Skill of the Author, in calling it a <hi>Poſtſcript:</hi> It being the Nature of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0397200201:354"/>
a Poſtſcript to contain ſomething very Material which was forgotten, or not clearly expreſſed in the Letter it ſelf. Thus, the Verſes being occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by a March without Beat of Drum, and that Circumſtance being no ways taken Notice of in any of the Stanza's, the Author calls it a Poſtſcript; not that it is a Poſtſcript, but figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, becauſe it wants a Poſtſcript. Common Writers, when what they mean is not expreſſed in the Book it ſelf, ſupply it by a Preface; but a Poſtſcript ſeems to me the more juſt Way of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology; becauſe otherwiſe a Man makes an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe before the Offence is committed. All the Heroick Poets were gueſſed at for its Author; but though we could not find out his Name, yet one repeated a Couplet in <hi>Hudibras</hi> which ſpoke his Qualifications:</p>

               <p>My Brethren of the Quill, the ingenious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of News-writers, having with great Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Elegance already informed the World, that the Town of <hi>Tournay</hi> capitulated on the 28th Inſtant, there is nothing left for me to ſay, but to congratulate the good Company here, that we have Reaſon to hope for an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of thanking Mr. <hi>Withers</hi> next Winter in this Place, for the Service he has done his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. No Man deſerves better of his Friends
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0397200201:356"/>
than that Gentleman, whoſe diſtinguiſhing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter it is, that he gives his Orders with the Familiarity, and enjoys his Fortune with the Generoſity, of a Fellow-Soldier. His Grace the Duke of <hi>Argyle</hi> had alſo an eminent Part in the Reduction of this important Place. That illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Youth diſcovers the peculiar Turn of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Greatneſs of Soul, which only make Men of high Birth and Quality uſeful to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and conſiders Nobility as an imaginary Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, unleſs accompanied with the Practice of thoſe generous Virtues by which it ought to be obtained. But that our Military Glory is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at its preſent Height, and that Men of all Ranks ſo paſſionately affect their Share in it, is certainly owing to the Merit and Conduct of our glorious General: For as the great Secret in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry, though not in Nature, has occaſioned many uſeful Diſcoveries; and the fantaſtick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being wholly diſintereſted in Friendſhip, has made Men do a Thouſand generous Actions above themſelves; ſo, though the preſent Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and Fame of the Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi> is a Station of Glory to which no one hopes to arrive, yet all carry their Actions to an higher Pitch, by having that great Example laid before them.</p>

               <p>MY Friend Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> has communicated to me his Letters from <hi>Epſom</hi> of the 25th Inſtant, which give, in general, a very good Account of the preſent Poſture of Affairs in that Place; but that the Tranquility and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence of the Company begins to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the Arrival of Sir <hi>Taffety Trippet,</hi> a Fortune-hunter, whoſe Follies are too groſs to give Diverſion; and whoſe Vanity is too ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid to let him be ſenſible that he is a publick Offence. If People will indulge a ſplenatick Humour, it is impoſſible to be at Eaſe, when ſuch Creatures as are the Scandal of our Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſet up for Gallantry and Adventures. It will be much more eaſy therefore to laugh Sir <hi>Taffety</hi> into Reaſon, than convert him from his Foppery by any ſerious Contempt. I knew a Gentleman that made it a Maxim to open his Doors, and ever run into the Way of Bullies, to avoid their Inſolence. The Rule will hold as well with Coxcombs: They are never morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but when they ſee you receive, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them; otherwiſe they reſt aſſured, that it is your Ignorance makes them out of your good Graces; or, that 'tis only want of Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance prevents their being amiable where they are ſhun'd and avoided. But Sir <hi>Taffety</hi> is a Fop of ſo ſanguine a Complexion, that I fear it will
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0397200201:358"/>
be very hard for the fair One he at preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues to get rid of the Chace, without being ſo tired, as for her own Eaſe to fall into the Mouth of the Mungrel ſhe runs from. But the Hiſtory of Sir <hi>Taffety</hi> is as pleaſant as his Character.</p>
               <p>It happened, that when he firſt ſet up for a Fortune-hunter, he choſe <hi>Tunbridge</hi> for the Scene of Action; where were at that Time Two Siſters upon the ſame Deſign. The Knight believed of Courſe the Elder muſt be the better Prize; and conſequently makes all his Sail that Way. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that want Senſe, do always in an egregious Manner want Modeſty, which made our Hero triumph in making his Amour as publick as was poſſible. The adored Lady was no leſs vain of his publick Addreſſes. An Attorney with one Cauſe is not half ſo reſtleſs as a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with one Lover. Where-ever they met, they talked to each other aloud, choſe each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Partner at Balls, ſaluted at the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous Parts of the Service at Church, and practiſed in Honour of each other all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Particularities which are uſual for Perſons who admire one another, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible to the reſt of the World. Theſe Two Lovers ſeem'd as much made for each other as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and all pronounced it a Match of Nature's own making; but the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Nuptials, (ſo univerſally approved) the younger Siſter, envious of the good Fortune even of her Siſter, who had been preſent at moſt of their Interviews, and had an equal Taſt for the Charms of a Fop (as there are a Set of Women made for that Order of Men); the younger, I ſay, unable to ſee ſo rich a Prize paſs by her, diſcovered to Sir <hi>Taffety,</hi> that a Coquet Air, much Tongue, and Three Suits, was all the Portion of his Miſtreſs. His Love vaniſhed that Moment, himſelf and Equipage
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0397200201:359"/>
the next Morning. It is uncertain where the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has been ever ſince engag'd; but certain it is, he has not appeared in his Character as a Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of Love and Fortune till he arrived at <hi>Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,</hi> where there is at preſent a young Lady of Youth, Beauty, and Fortune, who has alarmed all the Vain and the Impertinent to infeſt that Quarter. At the Head of this Aſſembly, Sir <hi>Taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety</hi> ſhines in the brighteſt Manner, with all the Accompliſhments which uſually enſuare the Heart of Woman; with this particular Merit, (which often is of great Service) that he is laughed at for her Sake. The Friends of the fair One are in much Pain for the Sufferings ſhe goes through from the Perſeverance of this Hero; but they may be much more ſo from the Danger of his ſucceeding, toward which they give him an helping Hand, if they diſſwade her with Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for there is a fantaſtical Generoſity in the Sex, to approve Creatures of the leaſt Merit ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, when they ſee the Imperfections of their Admirers are become Marks of Deriſion for their Sakes; and there is nothing ſo frequent, as that he who was contemptible to a Woman in her own Judgment, has won her by being too violently oppoſed by others.</p>

               <p>In the ſeveral Capacities I bear, of Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Civilian, and Phyſician, I have with great Application ſtudied the publick Emolument: To this End ſerve all my Lucubrations, Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and whatever other Labours I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, whether nocturnal or diurnal. On this Motive am I induced to publiſh a never-failing Medicine for the Spleen: My Experience in this Diſtemper came from a very remarkable Cure on my ever worthy Friend <hi>Tom Spindle,</hi> who, through exceſſive Gaiety, had exhauſted
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0397200201:360"/>
that natural Stock of Wit and Spirits he had long been bleſſed with: He was ſunk and flattened to the lower Degree imaginable, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whole Hours over the <hi>Book of Martyrs,</hi> and <hi>Pilgrims Progreſs;</hi> his other Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions never riſing higher than the Colour of his Urine, or Regularity of his Pulſe. In this Condition I found him, accompanied by the learned Dr. <hi>Drachm,</hi> and a good old Nurſe. <hi>Drachm</hi> had preſcribed Magazines of Herbs, and Mines of Steel. I ſoon diſcovered the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and deſcanted on the Nature of it, till I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced both the Patient and his Nurſe, that the Spleen is not to be cured by Medicine, but by Poetry. <hi>Apollo,</hi> the Author of Phyſick, ſhone with diffuſive Rays the beſt of Poets as well as of Phyſicians; and it is in this double Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that I have made my Way, and have found ſweet, eaſy, flowring Numbers, are oft ſuperior to our nobleſt Medicines. When the Spirits are low, and Nature ſunk, the Muſe, with ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and harmonious Notes, gives an unexpected Turn with a Grain of Poetry, which I prepare without the Uſe of Mercury. I have done Wonders in this Kind; for the Spleen is like the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> the Effects of whoſe malignant Poiſon are to be prevented by no other Remedy but the Charms of Muſick: For you are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that as ſome noxious Animals carry Antidotes for their own Poiſons; ſo there is ſomething equally unaccountable in Poetry: For though it is ſometimes a Diſeaſe, it is to be cured only by it ſelf. Now I knowing <hi>Tom Spindle</hi>'s Conſtitution, and that he is not only a pretty Gentleman, but alſo a pretty Poet, found the true Cauſe of his Diſtemper was a violent Grief that moved his Affections too ſtrongly: For during the late Treaty of Peace, he had writ a moſt excellent Poem on that Subject;
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0397200201:361"/>

I immediately told him, there was great Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the <hi>French</hi> would now ſue to us for Peace. I ſaw immediately a new Life in his Eyes; and knew, That nothing could help him forward ſo well, as hearing Verſes which he would believe worſe than his own; I read him therefore the <hi>Bruſſels Poſtſcript.</hi> After which I recited ſome Heroick Lines of my own, which operated ſo ſtrongly on the Tympanum of his Ear, that I doubt not but I have kept out all other Sounds for a Fortnight; and have Reaſon to hope, we ſhall ſee him abroad the Day before his Poem.</p>
               <p>This you ſee, is a particular Secret I have found out, <hi>viz.</hi> That you are not to chuſe your Phyſician for his Knowledge in your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, but for having it himſelf.

For being called the other Day to one in Love, I took indeed their Three Guinea's, and gave them my Advice; which was, to ſend for <hi>Aeſculapius. Aeſculapius,</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw the Patient, cries out, 'Tis Love! 'Tis Love! Oh! the unequal Pulſe! Theſe are the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms a Lover feels; ſuch Sighs, ſuch Pangs, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the uneaſy Mind; nor can our Art, or all our boaſted Skill, avail—Yet, O Fair! for thee—Thus the Sage ran on, and owned the Paſſion which he pitied, as well as that he felt a greater Pain than ever he cured: After which he concluded, All I can adviſe, is Marriage: Charms and Beauty will give new Life and Vigour, and turn the Courſe of Nature to its better Proſpect. This is the new Way; and

thus <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> has left his beloved Powders, and writes a <hi>Recipe</hi> for a Wife at Sixty. In ſhort, my Friend followed the Preſcription, and married Youth and Beauty in its perfect Bloom.</p>

               <p>Tragical Paſſion was the Subject of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe where I laſt viſited this Evening; and a Gentleman who knows that I am at preſent writing a very deep Tragedy, directed his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in a particular Manner to me. It is the common Fault (ſaid he) of you, Gentlemen, who write in the Buskin Style, that you give us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sentiments of ſuch who behold Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Events, than of ſuch who bear a Part in 'em themſelves. I would adviſe all who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this Way, to read <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> with Care, and they will ſoon be deterred from putting forth what is uſually called Tragedy. The Way of common Writers in this Kind, is rather the <hi>Deſcription</hi> than the <hi>Expreſſion</hi> of Sorrow. There is no Medium in theſe Attempts; and you muſt go to the very Bottom of the Heart, or it is all mere Language; and the Writer of ſuch Lines is no more a Poet, than a Man is a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician for knowing the Names of Diſtempers, without the Cauſes of them Men of Senſe are profeſſed Enemies to all ſuch empty Labours: For he who p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Image in this Place is wonderfully noble and great; yet this Man in all this is but ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing towards his great Affliction, and is ſtill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough himſelf, as you ſee, to make a Simile?

Reading but this one Scene has convinced me, that he who deſcribes the Concern of great Men, muſt have a Soul as noble, and as ſuſceptible of high Thoughts, as they whom he repreſents: I ſhall therefore lay by my <hi>Drama</hi> for ſome Time, and turn my Thoughts to Cares and Griefs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what below that of Heroes, but no leſs moving.

We choſe to take our Walk on <hi>Tower Hill;</hi> and as we were coming from thence in o der to ſtroll as far as <hi>Garraway</hi>'s, I obſe ved two Men, who had but juſt landed, coming from the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. I thought there was ſomething uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0397200201:365"/>
in their Mien and Aſpect; but though they ſeemed by their Viſage to be related, yet, was there a Warmth in their Manner, as if they differed very much in their Sentiments of the Subject on which they were talking. One of them ſeem'd to have a natural Confidence, mixed with an ingenuous Freedom in his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, his Dreſs very plain, but very graceful and becoming: The other, in the midſt of an over-bearing Carriage, betrayed (by frequently looking round him) a Suſpicion that he was not enough regarded by thoſe he met, or that he feared they would make ſome Attack upon him. This Perſon was much taller than his Companion, and added to that Height the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a Feather in his Hat, and Heels to his Shoes ſo monſtrouſly high, that he had Three or Four Times fallen down, had he not been ſupported by his Friend. They made a full Stop as they came within a few Yards of the Place where we ſtood. The plain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man bowed to <hi>Pacolet;</hi> the other looked on him with ſome Diſpleaſure: Upon which I asked him, Who they both were? When he thus informed me of their Perſons and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>You may remember, <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten told you, there are Beings of a ſuperior Rank to Mankind, who frequently viſit the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations of Men, in order to call them from ſome wrong Purſuits in which they are actually engaged, or divert them from Methods which will lead them into Errors for the future. He that will carefully reflect upon the Occurrences of his Life, will find he has been ſometimes extricated out of Difficulties, and received Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours where he could never have expected ſuch Benefits; as well as met with croſs Events from ſome unſeen Hand, which have diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0397200201:366"/>
his beſt laid Deſigns. Such Accidents arrive from the Interventions of Aerial Beings, as they are benevolent or hurtful to the Nature of Man, and attend his Steps in the Tracts of Ambition, of Buſineſs, and of Pleaſure. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ever appeared to you in the Manner I do now, I have frequently followed you in your Evening Walks, and have often, by throwing ſome Accident in your Way, as the paſſing by of a Funeral, or the Appearance of ſome other ſolemn Object, given your Imagination a new Turn, and changed a Night you had deſtined to Mirth and Jollity, into an Exerciſe of Study and Contemplation. I was the old Soldier who met you laſt Summer in <hi>Chelſea</hi>-Fields, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that I had broken my Wooden-Leg, and could not get Home; but I ſnap'd it ſhort off on purpoſe, that you might fall into the Reflections you did on that Subject, and take me into your Hack. If you remember, you made your ſelf very merry on that Fracture, and asked me, Whether I thought I ſhould next Winter feel Cold in the Toes of that Leg? As is uſually obſerved, that thoſe who loſe Limbs, are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of Pains in the extreme Parts, even after thoſe Limbs are cut off. However, my keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you then in the Story of the Battle of the <hi>Boin,</hi> prevented an Aſſignation, which would have led you into more Diſaſters than I then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort: Thoſe Two Perſons you ſee yonder, are ſuch as I am; they are not real Men, but are mere Shades and Figures: One is named <hi>Alethes,</hi> the other <hi>Veriſimilis.</hi> Their Office is to be the Guardians and Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Honour.</hi> They are now going to viſit the ſeveral Parts of the Town, to ſee how their Intereſts in the World decay or flouriſh, and to purge themſelves from the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0397200201:367"/>
many falſe Imputations they daily meet with in the Commerce and Converſation of Men. You obſerved <hi>Veriſimilis</hi> frowned when he firſt ſaw me. What he is provoked at, is, that I told him one Day, though he ſtrutted and dreſſed with ſo much Oſtentation, if he kept himſelf within his own Bounds, he was but a Lacquey, and wore only that Gentleman's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very whom he is now with. This frets him to the Heart; for you muſt know, he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a long Time to ſet up for himſelf, and gets among a Crowd of the more unthinking Part of Mankind, who take him for a Perſon of the Firſt Quality; though his Introduction into the World was wholly owing to his preſent Companion.</p>
               <p>This Encounter was very agreeable to me, and I was reſolved to dog them, and deſired <hi>Pacolet</hi> to accompany me. I ſoon perceived what he told me in the Geſture of the Perſons: For when they look'd at each other in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the well-dreſs'd Man ſuddenly caſt down his Eyes, and diſcovered that the other had a painful Superiority over him. After ſome further Diſcourſe, they took Leave. The plain Gentleman went down towards <hi>Thames-ſtreet,</hi> in order to be preſent, at leaſt, at the Oaths taken at the <hi>Cuſtom Houſe;</hi> and the other made directly for the Heart of the City. It is incredible how great a Change there imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately appeared in the Man of Honour when he got rid of his uneaſie Companion: He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted the Cock of his Hat a-new, ſettled his Sword-Knot, and had an Appearance that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a ſudden Inclination for him and his Intereſts in all who beheld him. For my Part (ſaid I to <hi>Pacolet</hi>) I cannot but think you are miſtaken in calling this Perſon, of the Lower Quality; for he looks much more like a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0397200201:368"/>
than the other. Don't you obſerve all Eyes are upon him as he advances: How each Sex gazes at his Stature, Aſpect, Addreſs, and Motion? <hi>Pacolet</hi> only ſmiled, and ſhaked his Head; as leaving me to be convinced by my own further Obſervation. We kept on our Way after him till we came to <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi> where the plain Gentleman again came up to the other; and they ſtood together after the Manner of eminent Merchants, as if ready to receive Application; but I could obſerve no Man talk to either of them. The One was laughed at as a Fop; and I heard many Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers againſt the other, as a whimſical Sort of Fellow, and a great Enemy to Trade. They croſſed <hi>Cornhill</hi> together, and came into the full <hi>Change,</hi> where ſome bowed, and gave themſelves Airs in being known to ſo fine a Man as <hi>Veriſimilis,</hi> who, they ſaid, had great Intereſt in all Princes Courts; and the other was taken Notice of by ſeveral as one they had ſeen ſomewhere long before. One more particularly ſaid, He had formerly been a Man of Conſideration in the World; but was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky, that they who dealt with him, by ſome ſtrange Infatuation or other, had a Way of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off their own Bills, and were prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſlow in improving their Stock. But as much as I was curious to obſerve the Reception theſe Gentlemen met with upon <hi>Change,</hi> I could not help being interrupted by one that came up towards us, to whom every Body made their Compliments. He was of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Height, and in his Dreſs there ſeemed to be great Care to appear no Way particular, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in a certain exact and feat Manner of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and Circumſpection. He was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully careful that his Shoes and Cloathes ſhould be without the leaſt Speck upon them;
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0397200201:369"/>
and ſeem'd to think, that on ſuch an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident depended his very Life and Fortune. There was hardly a Man on <hi>Change</hi> who had not a Note upon him; and each ſeem'd very well ſatisfied that their Money lay in his Hands, without demanding Payment. I asked <hi>Pacolet,</hi> What great Merchant that was, who was ſo univerſally addreſſed to, yet made too familiar an Appearance to command that extraordinary Deference? <hi>Pacolet</hi> anſwer'd, This Perſon is the Daemon or Genius of Credit; his Name is <hi>Umbra.</hi> If you obſerve, he follows <hi>Alethes</hi> and <hi>Veriſimilis</hi> at a Diſtance; and indeed has no Foundation for the Figure he makes in the World, but that he is thought to keep their Caſh; though at the ſame Time, none who truſt him, would truſt the other for a Groat. As the Company rolled about, the Three Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters were jumbled into one Place: When they were ſo, and all thought there was an Alliance between them, they immediately drew upon them the Buſineſs of the whole <hi>Change.</hi> But their Affairs ſoon encreaſed to ſuch an unweildy Bulk, that <hi>Alethes</hi> took his Leave, and ſaid, He would not engage further than he had an immediate Fund to anſwer. <hi>Veriſimilis</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that though he had Revenues large enough to go on his own Bottom, yet it was below one of his Family to condeſcend to trade in his own Name; therefore he alſo retired. I was extremely troubled, to ſee the glorious Mart of <hi>London</hi> left with no other Guardian, but him of Credit. But <hi>Pacolet</hi> told me, That Traders had nothing to do with the <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Conſcience</hi> of their Correſpondents, provided they ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a general Behaviour in the World, which could not hurt their Credit or their Purſes: For (ſaid he) you may in this one Tract of Building of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> ſee the imaginary
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0397200201:370"/>
Motives on which the greateſt Affairs move, as well as in rambling over the Face of the Earth. For tho' <hi>Alethes</hi> is the real Governour, as well as Legiſlator of Mankind, he has very little Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs but to make up Quarrels, and is only a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Referree, to whom every Man pretends to appeal; but is ſatisfied with his Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions no further than they promote his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Hence it is, that the Soldier and the Courtier model their Actions according to <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilis</hi>'s Manner, and the Merchant according to that of <hi>Umbra.</hi> Among theſe Men, Honour and Credit are not valuable Poſſeſſions in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or purſued out of a Principle of Juſtice; but merely as they are ſerviceable to Ambition and to Commerce. But the World will never be in any Manner of Order or Tranquility, till Men are firmly convinced, that Conſcience, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Credit, are all in one Intereſt; and that without the Concurrence of the former, the latter are but Impoſitions upon our ſelves and others. The Force theſe deluſive Words have, is not ſeen in the Tranſactions of the buſie World only, but alſo have their Tyranny over the Fair Sex. Were you to ask the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <hi>Lais,</hi> What Pangs of Reflection, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Conſideration of her Honour to her Conſcience, has given her? She could tell you, That it has forced her to drink up half a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon this Winter of <hi>Tom Daſſapas</hi>'s Potions; That ſhe ſtill pines away for fear of being a Mother; and knows not, but the Moment ſhe is ſuch, ſhe ſhall be a Murdereſs: But if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience had as ſtrong a Force upon her Mind as Honour, the firſt Step to her unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition had never been made; ſhe had ſtill been innocent, as ſhe's beautiful. Were Men ſo enlighten'd and ſtudious of their own Good, as to act by the Dictates of their Reaſon and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0397200201:371"/>
Reflection, and not the Opinion of others, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would be the ſteady Ruler of humane Life; and the Words, <hi>Truth, Law, Reaſon, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> would be but Synonymous Terms, for that only Guide which makes us paſs our Days in our own Favour and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

How could you (ſaid he) leave ſuch a Hint ſo coldly? How could <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> and <hi>Semphronia</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into your Imagination at the ſame Time, and you never declare to us the different Reception you gave 'em?</p>
               <p>The Figures which the ancient Mythologiſts and Poets put upon Love and Luſt in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, are very inſtructive. Love is a beauteous Blind Child, adorn'd with a Quiver and a Bow, which he plays with, and ſhoots around him, without Deſign or Direction; to intimate to us, that the Perſon beloved has no Intention to give us the Anxieties we meet with; but that the Beauties of a worthy Object are like the Charms of a lovely Infant: They cannot but attract your Concern and Fondneſs, tho' the Child ſo regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is as inſenſible of the Value you put upon it, as it is that it deſerves your Benevolence. On the other Side, the Sages figured Luſt in the Form of a Satyr; of Shape, part Humane, part Beſtial; to ſignify, that the Followers of it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Reaſon of a Man to purſue the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of a Beaſt. This Satyr is made to haunt the Paths and Coverts of the Wood-Nymphs and Shepherdeſſes, to lurk on the Banks of Rivulets, and watch the purling Streams, (as the Reſorts of retired Virgins) to ſhow, that lawleſs Deſire tends chiefly to prey upon Innocence, and has ſomething ſo unnatural in it, that it hates its own Make, and ſhuns the Object it lov'd, as ſoon as it has made it like it ſelf. Love therefore is a Child that complains and bewails its Inability to help it ſelf, and weeps for Aſſiſtance, without an immediate Reflection or Knowledge of the Food it wants: Luſt, a watchful Thief which ſeizes its Prey, and lays Snares for its own Relief; and its principal Object being Innocence, it never robs, but it murders at the ſame Time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:0397200201:373"/>
From this Idea of a <hi>Cupid</hi> and a <hi>Satyr,</hi> we may ſettle our Notion of theſe different Deſires, and accordingly rank their Followers. <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> muſt therefore be allow'd to be the firſt of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Order of Love, whoſe unaffected Freedom, and conſcious Innocence, give her the Attendance of the Graces in all her Actions. That awful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which we bear towards her in all our Thoughts of her, and that chearful Familiarity with which we approach her, are certain Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of her being the trueſt Object of Love of any of her Sex. In this accompliſh'd Lady, Love is the conſtant Effect, becauſe it is never the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Yet, tho' her Mien carries much more Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation than Command, to behold her is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Check to looſe Behaviour; and to love her, is a liberal Education: For, it being the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all Love to create an Imitation of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Perſon in the Lover, a Regard for <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> naturally produces Decency of Manners, and good Conduct of Life in her Admirers. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the giggling <hi>Leucippe</hi> could but ſee her Train of Fops aſſembled, and <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> move by 'em, ſhe would be mortified at the Veneration with which ſhe is beheld, ev'n by <hi>Leucippe</hi>'s own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking Equipage, whoſe Paſſions have long ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Leave of their Underſtandings.</p>
               <p>As Charity is eſteemed a Conjunction of the good Qualities neceſſary to a virtuous Man, ſo Love is the happy Compoſition of all the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments that make a Fine Gentleman. The Motive of a Man's Life is ſeen in all his Actions; and ſuch as have the Beauteous Boy for their Inſpirer, have a Simplicity of Behaviour, and a certain Evenneſs of Deſire, which burns like the Lamp of Life in their Boſoms; while they who are inſtigated by the Satyr, are ever tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Jealouſies of the Object of their Wiſhes; often deſire what they ſcorn, and as often
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0397200201:374"/>
conſciouſly and knowingly embrace where they are mutually indifferent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florio,</hi> the generous Husband, and <hi>Limberham,</hi> the kind Keeper, are noted Examples of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Effects which theſe Deſires produce in the Mind. <hi>Amanda,</hi> who is the Wife of <hi>Florio,</hi> lives in the continual Enjoyment of new Inſtances of her Husband's Friendſhip, and ſees it the End of all his Ambition to make her Life one Series of Pleaſure and Satisfaction; and <hi>Amanda</hi>'s Reliſh of the Goods of Life, is all that makes 'em plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to <hi>Florio:</hi> They behave themſelves to each other when preſent with a certain apparent Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, which tranſports above Rapture; and they think of each other in Abſence with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence unknown to the higheſt Friendſhip: Their Satisfactions are doubled, their Sorrows leſſen'd by Participation.</p>
               <p>On the other Hand, <hi>Corinna,</hi> who is the Miſtreſs of <hi>Limberham,</hi> lives in conſtant Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Her Equipage is, an old Woman, who was what <hi>Corinna</hi> is now; an antiquated Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was Pimp to <hi>Limberham</hi>'s Father; and a Chamber-Maid, who is <hi>Limberham</hi>'s Wench by Fits, out of a Principle of Politicks to make her jealous and watchful of <hi>Corinna.</hi> Under this Guard, and in this Converſation, <hi>Corinna</hi> lives in State: The Furniture of her Habitation, and her own gorgeous Dreſs, make her the Envy of all the ſtrolling Ladies in the Town; but <hi>Corinna</hi> know ſhe her ſelf is but Part of <hi>Limberham</hi>'s Houſhold-Stuff, and is as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being diſpos'd of elſewhere, as any other Moveable. But while her Keeper is perſwaded by his Spies, that no Enemy has been within his Doors ſince his laſt Viſit, no <hi>Perſian</hi> Prince was ever ſo magnificently bountiful: A kind Look or falling Tear is worth a Piece of Broc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kade, a Sigh is a Jewel, and a Smile is a Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0397200201:375"/>
board of Plate. All this is ſhar'd between <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinna</hi> and her Guard in his Abſence. With this great Oeconomy and Induſtry does the unhappy <hi>Limberham</hi> purchaſe the conſtant Tortures of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, the Favour of ſpending his Eſtate, and the Opportunity of enriching one by whom he knows he is hated and deſpiſed. Theſe are the ordinary and common Evils which attend Keepers, and <hi>Corinna</hi> is a Wench but of common Size of Wickedneſs, were you to know what paſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Roof where the fair <hi>Meſſalina</hi> reigns with her humble Adorer!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meſſalina</hi> is the profeſs'd Miſtreſs of Mankind; ſhe has left the Bed of her Husband and her beauteous Offspring, to give a Looſe to Want of Shame and Fulneſs of Deſire. Wretched <hi>Nocturuus,</hi> her feeble Keeper! How the poor Creature fribles in his Gate, and skuttles from Place to Place to diſpatch his neceſſary Affairs in painful Day-light, that he may return to the conſtant Twilight preſerv'd in that Scene of Wantonneſs, <hi>Meſſalina</hi>'s Bed-chamber! How does he, while he is abſent from thence, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his Imagination the Breadth of his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Shoulders, the ſpruce Nightcap of his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, the ready Attendance of his Butler! Any of all whom he knows ſhe admits, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to approve of. This, alas! is the Gallantry; this the Freedom of our Fine Gentlemen: For this they preſerve their Liberty, and keep clear of that Bugbear, Marriage. But he does not underſtand either Vice or Virtue, who will not allow, that Life without the Rules of Morality is a wayward uneaſie Being, with Snatches only of Pleaſure; but under the Regulation of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, a reaſonable and uniform Habit of Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I have ſeen in a Play of old <hi>Haywood</hi>'s, a Speech at the End of an Act, which touch'd this Point with much Spirit. He makes a married
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0397200201:376"/>
Man in the Play, upon ſome endearing Occaſion, look at his Spouſe with an Air of Fondneſs, and fall into the following Reflection on his Condition:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Oh Marriage! Happieſt, eaſieſt, ſafeſt State;</l>
                  <l>Let Debauchees and Drunkards ſcorn thy Rights,</l>
                  <l>Who, in their nauſeous Draughts and Luſts, profane</l>
                  <l>Both thee and Heav'n by whom thou wer't or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd.</l>
                  <l>How can the Savage call it Loſs of Freedom,</l>
                  <l>Thus to converſe with, thus to gaze at</l>
                  <l>A faithful, beauteous Friend?</l>
                  <l>Bluſh not, my fair One, that thy Love applauds thee,</l>
                  <l>Nor be it painful to my wedded Wife,</l>
                  <l>That my full Heart o'erflows in Praiſe of thee.</l>
                  <l>Thou art by Law, by Intereſt, Paſſion, mine:</l>
                  <l>Paſſion and Reaſon join in Love of thee.</l>
                  <l>Thus, through a World of Calumny and Fraud,</l>
                  <l>We paſs both unreproach'd, both undeceiv'd;</l>

For we ſhall never give Accounts to the World of any Thing, but what the Lives and Endeavours of the Perſons (of whom we treat) make the Baſis of their Fame and Repu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation. For this Reaſon it is to be hoped, that our Appearance is reputed a publick Benefit; and tho' certain Perſons may turn what we mean for Panegyrick into Scandal, let it be anſwered once for all, That if our Praiſes are really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd as Raillery, ſuch malevolent Perſons owe their Safety from it only to their being too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable for Hiſtory. It is not every Man who deals in Ratsbane, or is unſeaſonably amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that can adorn Story like <hi>Aeſculapius;</hi> nor every Stock-Jobber of the <hi>India</hi> Company can aſſume the Port, and perſonate the Figure of <hi>Aurengezebe.</hi> My noble Anceſtor Mr. <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear,</hi> who was of the Race of the <hi>Staffs,</hi> was not more fond of the memorable Sir <hi>John Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff,</hi> than I am of thoſe Worthies; but the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> have an admirable Admonition expreſs'd in two Words, to wit, <hi>Nequid nimis,</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids my indulging my ſelf on thoſe delightful

Subjects, and calls me to do Juſtice to others, who make no leſs Figures in our Generation. Of ſuch, the firſt and moſt renown'd is, that eminent Hero and Lover, <hi>Orlando</hi> the Handſome, whoſe Diſappointments in Love, in Gallantry, and in War, have baniſhed him from publick View, and made him voluntarily enter into a Confinement, to which the ungrateful Age would otherwiſe have forced him. Ten <hi>Luſtra</hi> and more are wholly paſs'd ſince <hi>Orlando</hi> firſt appeared in the Metropolis of this Iſland: His Deſcent noble, his Wit humorous, his Perſon charming. But to none of theſe Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Advantages was his Title ſo undoubted as that of his Beauty. His Complexion was fair, but his Countenance manly; his Stature of the talleſt, his Shape the moſt exact; and tho' in all his Limbs he had a Proportion as delicate as we ſee in the Works of the moſt skilful Statua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, his Body had a Strength and Firmneſs little inferior to the Marble of which ſuch Images are form'd. This made <hi>Orlando</hi> the univerſal Flame of all the Fair Sex; Innocent Virgins ſigh'd for him, as <hi>Adonis;</hi> experienced Widows, as <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.</hi> Thus did this Figure walk alone the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and Ornament of our <hi>Species,</hi> but of Courſe the Envy of all who had the ſame Paſſions, without his ſuperior Merit and Pretences to the Favour of that enchanting Creature, <hi>Woman.</hi> However, the generous <hi>Orlando</hi> believ'd himſelf form'd for the World, and not to be engroſs'd by any particular Affection. He ſigh'd not for <hi>Delia,</hi> for <hi>Chloris,</hi> for <hi>Chloe,</hi> for <hi>Betty,</hi> nor my Lady, nor for the ready Chamber-maid, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Baroneſs: <hi>Woman</hi> was his Miſtreſs, and the whole Sex his Seraglio. His Form was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways irreſiſtible: And if we conſider, that not One of Five hundred can bear the leaſt Favour from a Lady without being exalted above him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0397200201:380"/>
if alſo we muſt allow, that a Smile from a Side-Box has made <hi>Jack Spruce</hi> half mad, we can't think it wonderful that <hi>Orlando</hi>'s repeated Conqueſts touch'd his Brain: So it certainly did, and <hi>Orlando</hi> became an Enthuſiaſt in Love; and in all his Addreſs, contracted ſomething out of the ordinary Courſe of Breeding and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility. However, (powerful as he was) he would ſtill add to the Advantages of his Perſon, that of a Profeſſion which the Ladies always fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and immediately commenced Soldier. Thus equipp'd for Love and Honour, our Hero ſeeks diſtant Climes and Adventures, and leaves the deſpairing Nymphs of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to the Courtſhip of Beaus and Witlings till his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. His Exploits in Foreign Nations and Courts, have not been regularly enough com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto us, to report 'em with that Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity which we profeſs in our Narrations: But after many Feats of Arms, (which thoſe who were Witneſſes to them have ſuppreſs'd out of Envy, but which we have had faithfully related from his own Mouth in our publick Streets) <hi>Orlando</hi> returns home full, but not loaded with Years. Beaus born in his Abſence made it their Buſineſs to decry his Furniture, his Dreſs, his Manner; but all ſuch Rivalry he ſuppreſſed (as the Philoſopher did the Sceptick, who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued there was no ſuch Thing as Motion) by only moving.

                     <p>HAving a great deal of more advantagious Buſineſs at preſent on my Hands, I thought to have deferr'd anſwering your <hi>Tatler</hi> of the 21ſt Inſtant, till the Company was gone, and Seaſon over; but having reſolved not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard any Impertinences of your Paper, except what relate particularly to me, I am the more eaſily induc'd to anſwer you (as I ſhall find Time to do it): Firſt, pa tly leſt you ſhould think your ſelf neglected, which I have Reaſon to believe you would take heinouſly ill. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, partly becauſe it will increaſe my Fame, and conſequently my Audience, when all the Quality ſhall ſee with how much Wit and Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery I ſhow you—I don't care a Farthing for you. Thirdly, partly becauſe being <hi>without Books,</hi> if I don't ſhow much Learning, it will not be imputed to my having none.</p>
                     <p>I have travelled <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and fully comprehend whatever any <hi>German</hi> Arriſt in the World can do; yet cannot I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, why you ſhould endeavour to diſturb the Repoſe and Plenty which (tho' unworthy) I enjoy at this Place. It cannot be, that you take Offence at my Prologues and Epilogues, which you are pleas'd to miſcall Fooliſh and

Abuſive. No, no, until you give a better, I ſhall not forbear thinking, that the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your picking a Quarrel with me was, becauſe it is more agreeable to your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as well as more to the Honour of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Now I appeal to all Men, if this is not contrary to that uncontroulable, unaccountable Dominion, which by the Laws of Nature I exerciſe over them; for all Sorts of Wood and Wire were made for the Uſe and Benefit of Man: I have therefore an unqueſtionable Right to frame, faſhion, and put them together, as I pleaſe; and having made them what they are, my Puppets are my Property, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Slaves: Nor is there in Nature any Thing more juſt, than the Homage which is paid by a leſs to a more excellent Being: So that by the Right therefore of a ſuperior Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, I am their ſupreme Moderator, altho' you would inſinuate (agreeably to your level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Principles) that I am my ſelf but a great Puppet, and can therefore have but a co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Juriſdiction with them. I ſuppoſe I have now ſufficiently made it appear, that I have a paternal Right to keep a Puppet-Show, and this Right I will maintain in my Prologues on all Occaſions.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, if you write a Defence of your ſelf againſt this my Self-Defence, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh you to keep within Bounds; for

                     <p>I order you to handle only theſe Two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, to which our Diſpute may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: The Firſt, Whether I have not an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power, whenever I pleaſe, to light a Pipe with one of <hi>Punch</hi>'s Legs, or warm my Fingers with his whole Carcaſs? The Second, Whether the Devil would not be in <hi>Punch,</hi> ſhould he by Word or Deed oppoſe my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Will and Pleaſure? And then, perhaps, I may (if I can find Leiſure for it) give you the Trouble of a ſecond Letter.</p>
                     <p>But if you intend to tell me of the Original of Puppet-Shows, and the ſeveral Changes and Revolutions that have happened in them, ſince <hi>Theſpis,</hi> and I don't care who, that's <hi>Noli me tangere;</hi> I have ſolemnly engaged to ſay nothing of what I can't approve. Or, if you talk of certain Contracts with the Mayor and Burgeſſes, or Fees to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables, for the Privilege of Acting, I will not write one ſingle Word about any ſuch Matters; but ſhall leave you to be mumbled by the learned and very ingenious Author of a late Book, who knows very well what's to be ſaid and done in ſuch Caſes. He is now ſhuffling the Cards, and dealing to <hi>Timothy;</hi> but if he wins the Game; I will ſend him to play at Backgammon with you; and then he will ſatisfy you, that Deuce-Ace makes Five.</p>
