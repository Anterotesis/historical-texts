            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>OF all the tyrannies that afflict mankind tyranny in religion is the worſt: Every other ſpecies of tyranny is limited to the world we live in; but this attempts a ſtride beyond the grave, and ſeeks to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue us into eternity. It is there, and not here, it is to God and not to man, it is to a heavenly and not to an earthly tribunal, that we are to account for our belief; if then we believe falſely and diſhonourably of the Creator, and that belief is forced upon us, as far as force can operate, by human laws and human tribunals, on whom is the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality of that belief to fall; on thoſe who impoſe it, or on thoſe on whom it is impoſed?</p>
            <p>A bookſeller o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the name of Williams has been proſecuted in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don on a charge of blaſphemy, for publiſhing a book intitled the <hi>Age of Reaſon:</hi> Blaſphemy is a word of vaſt ſound, but of equivocal and almoſt indefinite ſignification; unleſs we confine it to the ſimple idea of hurting or injuring the reputation of any one, which was its original meaning. As a word, it exiſted before Chriſtianity exiſted, being a Greek word, or Greek anglofied, as all the etymological dictionaries will ſhew.</p>
            <p>But behold how various and contradictory has been the ſignification and application of this equivocal word: Socrates, who lived more than four hundred years before the Chriſtian aera, was convicted of blaſphemy, for preaching againſt the belief of a plurality of gods, and for preaching the belief of one god, and was condemned to ſuffer death by poiſon: Jeſus Chriſt was convicted of blaſphemy under the Jewiſh law, and was crucified. Calling Mahomet an impoſtor would be blaſphemy in Turkey; and denying the infallibility of the Pope and the Church would be blaſphemy at Rome. What then is to be underſtood by this word blaſphemy? We ſee that in the caſe of Socrates, truth was condemned as blaſphemy. Are we ſure that truth is not blaſphemy in the preſent day? Woe, however, be to thoſe who make it ſo, whoever they may be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0276701000:5"/>A book called the bible has been voted by men, and decreed by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man laws, to be the word of God, and the diſbelief of this is called blaſphemy. But if the bible be not the word of God, it is the laws, and the execution of them, that is blaſphemy, and not the diſbelief. Strange ſtories are told of the Creator in that book. He is repreſented as acting under the influence of every human paſſion, even of the moſt malignant kind. If theſe ſtories are falſe, we err in believing them to be true, and ought not to believe them. It is therefore a duty, which every man owes to himſelf, and reverentially to his Maker, to aſcertain by every poſſible enquiry, whether there be ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to believe them or not.</p>
            <p>My own opinion is decidedly, that the evidence does not warrant the belief, and that we ſin in forcing that belief upon ourſelves, and upon others. In ſaying this, I have no other object in view, than truth. But that I may not be accuſed of reſting upon bare aſſertion, with reſpect to the equivocal ſtate of the bible, I will produce an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and I will not pick and cull the bible for the purpoſe. I will go fairly to the caſe I will take the two firſt chapters of Geneſis, as they ſtand, and ſhew from thence the truth of what I ſay, that is, that the evidence does not warrant the belief, that the bible is the word of God.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finiſhed, and all the hoſt of them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 And on the ſeventh day God ended his work which he had made, and he reſted on the ſeventh day from all his work which he had made.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 And God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it: becauſe that in it he had reſted from all his work, which God created and made.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 ¶ Theſe are the generations of the heavens and of the earth, when they were created; in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,</p>
                        <p n="5">5 And every plant of the field, before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field, before it grew: for the Lord God had not cauſed it to rain upon the earth, <hi>and there was not a man to till the ground.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6 But there went up a miſt from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 And the Lord God formed man of the duſt of the ground, and breated into his noſtrils the breath of life; and man became a living ſoul.</p>
                        <p n="8">8 ¶ And the Lord God planted a garden eaſtward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</p>
                        <p n="9">9 And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleaſant to the ſight, and good for food: the tree of life alſo in the midſt of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>
                        <p n="10">10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</p>
                        <p n="11">11 The name of the firſt is Piſon: that is it which compaſſeth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.</p>
                        <p n="12">12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx-ſtone.</p>
                        <p n="13">13 And the name of the ſecond river is Gibon: the ſame is it that compaſſeth the whole land of Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p n="14">14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the eaſt of Aſſyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</p>
                        <p n="15">15 And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dreſs it and to keep it.</p>
                        <p n="16">16 And the Lord God commanded the man, ſaying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayeſt freely eat:</p>
                        <p n="17">17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou ſhalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</p>
                        <p n="18">18 ¶ And the Lord God ſaid, it is not good that the man ſhould be alone: I will make him an help meet for him.</p>
                        <p n="19">19 And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beaſt of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them unto Adam to ſee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0276701000:8"/>
what he would call them: and whatſoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</p>
                        <p n="20">20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beaſt of the field: but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</p>
                        <p n="21">21 And the Lord God cauſed a deep ſleep to fall upon Adam, and he ſlept: and he took one of his ribs, and cloſed up the fleſh inſtead thereof.</p>
                        <p n="22">22 And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</p>
                        <p n="23">23 And Adam ſaid, This is now bone of my bones, and fleſh of my fleſh: ſhe ſhall be called woman, becauſe ſhe was taken out of man.</p>
                        <p n="24">24 Therefore ſhall a man leave his father and his mother, and ſhall cleave unto his wife: and they ſhall be one fleſh.</p>
                        <p n="25">25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not aſhamed.</p>

            <p>Theſe two chapters are called the Moſaic account of the creation; and we are told, nobody knows by whom, that Moſes was inſtructed by God to write that account.</p>
            <p>It has happened that every nation of people has been world-makers; and each makes the world to begin his own way, as if they had all been brought up, as Hudibraſs ſays, to the trade. There are hundreds of different opinions and traditions how the world began. My buſineſs, however, in this place, is only with thoſe two chapters.</p>
            <p>I begin then by ſaying, that thoſe two chapters, inſtead of contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as has been believed, one continued account of the Creation, written by Moſes, contain two different and contradictory ſtories of a creation, made by two different perſons, and written in two differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtiles of expreſſion. The evidence that ſhews this, is ſo clear when attended to without prejudice, that, did we meet with the ſame evidence in any Arabic or Chineſe account of a creation, we ſhould not heſitate in pronouncing it a forgery.</p>
            <p>I proceed to diſtinguiſh the two ſtories from each other.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſtory begins at the firſt verſe of the firſt chapter, and ends at the end of the third verſe of the ſecond chapter; for the adverbial conjunction, THUS, with which the ſecond chapter begins, (as the reader will ſee) connects itſelf to the laſt verſe of the firſt chapter, and thoſe three verſes belong to, and make the concluſion of, the firſt ſtory.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſtory begins at the fourth verſe of the ſecond chapter, and ends with that chapter. Thoſe two ſtories have been confuſed into one, by cutting off the three laſt verſes of the firſt ſtory, and throwing them to the ſecond chapter.</p>
            <p>I go now to ſhew that thoſe ſtories have been written by two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0276701000:9"/>From the firſt verſe of the firſt chapter, to the end of the third Verſe of the ſecond chapter, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch makes the whole of the firſt ſtory, the word GOD is uſed without any epithet or additional word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined with it, as the reader will ſee; and this ſtile of expreſſion is invariably uſed throughout the whole of this ſtory, and is repeated no leſs than thirty five times, viz.
<q>In the beginning GOD created the heavens, and the earth, and the ſpirit of GOD moved on the face of the water, and GOD ſaid, Let there be light, and GOD ſaw the light, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But immediately from the beginning of the fourth verſe of the ſecond chapter, where the ſecond ſtory begins, the ſtile of expreſſion is always the <hi>Lord God,</hi> and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The firſt ſtory contains thirty-four verſes, and repeats the ſingle word GOD thirty-five times. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſtory contains twenty two verſes, and repeats the compound word <hi>Lord-God</hi> eleven times; this difference of ſtile, ſo often repeated, and ſo uniformly continued, ſhews, that thoſe two chapters, containing two different ſtories, are written by different perſons, it is the ſame in all the different edition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the bible, in all the languages I have ſeen.</p>

               </gap>ing thus ſhewn from the difference of ſtile, that thoſe two chapters divided, as they properly divide themſelves, at the end of the third verſe of the ſecond chap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er, are the work of two different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to ſhew from the contradictory matters they contain, that they cannot be the work of one perſon, and are two different ſtories.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible, unleſs the writer was a lunatic, without memory, that one and the ſame perſon could ſay, as is ſaid in the 27 and 28 verſes of the firſt chapter—<q>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him: male and female created he them, and God bleſſed them, and God ſaid unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and repleniſh the earth, and ſubdue it, and have dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, and over the fowls of the air, and over every living thing, that moveth on the face of the earth.</q> It is, I ſay, impoſſible, that the ſame per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on, who ſaid this, could afterwards ſay, as is ſaid in the ſecond chapter, ver. 5, <hi>and there was not a man to till the ground;</hi> and then proceed in the 7th verſe to give another account of the making a man for the firſt time, and afterwards of the making a woman out of his rib.</p>
            <p>Again, one and the ſame perſon could not write, as is written in the 29th verſe of the firſt chapter; behold I (God) have given you every herb bearing ſeed, which is on the face of all the earth; and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree bearing ſeed, to you it ſhall be for meat and afterwards ſay, as is ſaid in the ſecond chapter, that the Lord-God planted a tree in the midſt of a garden, and forbad man to eat thereof.</p>
            <p>Again, one and the ſame perſon could not ſay, <q>Thus the heavens and the earth were finiſhed, and all the hoſt of them, and on the ſeventh day God ended all his work, which he had made,</q> and immediately
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0276701000:10"/>
after, ſet the Creator to work again, to plant a garden, to make a man and a woman, &amp;c. as is done in the ſecond chapter.</p>
            <p>Here are evidently two different ſtories contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icting each other— According to the firſt, the two ſexes, the male and the female, were made at the ſame time. According to the ſecond, they were made at different times. The man firſt, the woman afterwards. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the firſt ſtory, they were to have dominion over all the earth. According to the ſecond, their dominion was limited to a garden. How large a garden it could be, that one man and one woman could dreſs and keep in order, I leave to the proſecutor, the judge, the jury, and Mr. Erſkine, to determine.</p>
            <p>The ſtory of the talking ſerpent, and its tete a tete with Eve: the doleful adventure, called the <hi>Fall of Man;</hi> and how he was turned out of this fine garden, and how the garden was afterwards locked up and guarded by a flaming ſword, (if any one can tell what a flaming ſword is) belong altogether to the ſecond ſtory. They have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the firſt ſtory. According to the firſt there was no gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Eden; no forbidden tree: The ſcene was the whole earth, and the fruit of all trees was allowed to be eaten.</p>
            <p>In giving this example of the ſtrange ſtate of the bible, it cannot be ſaid I have gone out of my way to ſeek it, for I have taken the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the book; nor can it be ſaid I have made more of it, than it makes of itſelf. That there are two ſtories is as viſible to the eye, when attended to, as that there are two chapters, and that they have been written by different perſons, nobody knows by whom. If this, then, is the ſtrange condition, the beginning of the bible is in, it leads to a juſt ſuſpicion, that the other parts are no better, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it becomes every man's duty to examine the caſe. I have done it for myſelf, and am ſatisfied, that the bible is <hi>fabulous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps I ſhall be told in the cant-language of the day, as I have often been told by the biſhop of Landaff and others, of the great and laudable pains, that many pious and learned men have taken to explain the obſcure, and reconcile the contradictory, or as they ſay, the <hi>ſeemingly contradictory</hi> paſſages of the bible. It is becauſe the bible needs ſuch an undertaking, that is one of the firſt cauſes to ſuſpect it is NOT the word of God: this ſingle reflection, when carried home to the mind, is in itſelf a volume.</p>
            <p>What! does not the Creator of the Univerſe, the Fountain of all Wiſdom, the Origin of all Science, the Author of all Knowledge, the God of Order and of Harmony, know how to write? When we contemplate the vaſt oeconomy of the creation, when we behold the unerring regularity of the viſible ſolar ſyſtem, the perfection with which all its ſeveral parts revolve, and by correſponding aſſemblage, form a whole;—when we launch our eye into the boundleſs ocean of ſpace, and ſee ourſelves ſurrounded by innumerable worlds, not one of which varies from its appointed place—when we trace the power of a Creator, from a mite to an elephant; from an atom to an univerſe; can we ſuppoſe that the mind that could conceive ſuch a deſign, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0276701000:11"/>
the power that executed it with incomparable perfection, cannot write without inconſiſtence; or that a book ſo written can be the work of ſuch a power? The writings of Thomas Paine, even of Thomas Paine, need no commentator to explain, expound, derange, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrange their ſeveral parts, to render them intelligible—he can relate a fact, or write an eſſay, without forgetting in one page what he has written in another; certainly then, did the God of all perfection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to write or dictate a book, that book would be as perfect as himſelf is perfect: The bible is not ſo, and it is confeſſedly not ſo, by the attempts to amend it.</p>
            <p>Perhaps I ſhall be told, that though I have produced one inſtance, I cannot produce another of equal force. One is ſufficient to call in queſtion the genuineneſs or authenticity of any book that pretends to be the word of God: for ſuch a book would, as before ſaid, be as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as its author is perfect.</p>
            <p>I will, however, advance only four chapters further into the book of Geneſis and produce another example that is ſufficient to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the ſtory to which it belongs.</p>
            <p>We have all heard of Noah's Flood; and it is impoſſible to think of the whole human race, men, women, children, and infants (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one family) deliberately drowning, without feeling a painful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; that heart muſt be a heart of flint that can contemplate ſuch a ſcene with tranquility. There is nothing in the ancient mythology, nor in the religion of any people we know of upon the globe, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords a ſentence of their God, or of their Gods, ſo tremendouſly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and mercileſs. If the ſtory be not true, we blaſphemiouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God by believing it, and ſtill more ſo, in forcing, by laws and penalties, that belief upon others. I go now to ſhew from the face of the ſtory, that it carries the evidence of not being true.</p>
            <p>I know not if the judge, the jury, and Mr. Erſkine, who tried and convicted Williams, ever read the bible, or know any thing of its contents, and therefore I will ſtate the caſe preciſely:</p>
            <p>There were no ſuch people, as Jews or Iſraelites, in the time that Noah is ſaid to have lived, and conſequently, there was no ſuch law as that which is called the Jewiſh or Moſaic Law. It is, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bible, more than ſix hundred years from the time the flood is ſaid to have happened, to the time of Moſes, and conſequently the time the flood is ſaid to have happened, was more than ſix hundred years prior to the law, called the Law of Moſes, even admitting Moſes to have been the giver of that law, of which there is great cauſe to doubt.</p>
            <p>We have here two different epochs, or points of time; that of the flood, and that of the law of Moſes; the former more than ſix hundred years prior to the latter. But the maker of the ſtory of the flood, whoever he was, has betrayed himſelf by blundering, for he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed the order of the times. He has told the ſtory, as if the law of Moſes was prior to the flood; for he has made God to ſay to Noah, Geneſis, chap. vii. ver. 2, <q>Of every clean beaſt, thou ſhalt take
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0276701000:12"/>
unto thee by ſevens, male and his female, and of beaſts that are <hi>not clean</hi> by two, the male and his female.</q> This is the Moſaic law, and could only be ſaid after that law was given, not before: There was no ſuch thing as beaſts clean and unclean in the time of Noah—it is no where ſaid, they were created ſo. They were only <hi>declared</hi> to be ſo, <hi>as meats,</hi> by the Moſaic law, and that to the Jews only, and there were no ſuch people as Jews in the time of Noah. This is the blundering condition in which this ſtrange ſtory ſtands.</p>
            <p>When we reflect on a ſentence, ſo tremendouſly ſevere, as that of conſigning the whole human race, eight perſons excepted, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate drowning; a ſentence, which repreſents the Creator, in a more mercileſs character than any of thoſe, whom we call Pagans, ever repreſented the Creator to be, under the figure of any of their deities, we ought at leaſt to ſuſpend our belief of it, on a compariſon of the beneficent character of the Creator, with the tremendous ſeverity of the ſentence; but when we ſee the ſtory told with ſuch an evident contradiction of circumſtances, we ought to ſet it down for nothing better than a Jewiſh fable, told by nobody knows whom, and nobody knows when.</p>
            <p>It is a relief to the genuine and ſenſible ſoul of man to find the ſtory unfounded. It frees us from two painful ſenſations at once; that of having hard thoughts of the Creator, on account of the ſeverity of the ſentence; and that of ſympathiſing in the horrid tragedy of a drowning world. He who cannot feel the force of what I mean, is not, in my eſtimation of character, worthy the name of a human being.</p>
            <p>I have juſt ſaid there is great cauſe to doubt, if the law, called the law of Moſes, was given by Moſes; the books, called books of Moſes, which contain among other things, what is called the Moſaic law, are put in front of the bible, in the manner of a conſtitution, with a hiſtory annexed to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Had theſe books been written by Moſes, they would undoubtedly have been the oldeſt books in the bible, and entitled to be placed firſt, and the law and the hiſtory they contain, would be frequently referred to in the books that follow; but this is not the caſe. From the time of Othniel, the firſt of the judges (Judges, chap. iii. ver. 9) to the end of the book of Judges, which contains a period of four hundred and ten years, this law, and thoſe books were not in practice, nor known among the Jews, nor are they ſo much as alluded to throughout the whole of that period. And if the reader will examine the 22d and 23d chapters of 2d book of Kings, and 34th chapter 2d Chron. he will find, that no ſuch law, nor any ſuch books were known in the time of the Jewiſh monarchy, and that the Jews were Pagans during the whole of that time, and of their judges.</p>
            <p>The firſt time the law, called the law of Moſes, made its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, was in the time of Joſiah, about a thouſand years after Moſes was dead, it is then ſaid to have been found by accident. The account of this finding, or pretended finding, is given,

               </gap>ir monarchy deſtroyed. It is therefore evident that the law, called the law of Moſes, of which the Jews talk ſo much, was promulgated and eſtabliſhed only in the latter time of the Jewiſh monarchy; and it is very remarkable, that no ſooner had they eſtabliſhed it than they were a deſtroyed people, as if they were puniſhed for acting an impoſition and affixing the name of the Lord to it, and maſſacreing their former prieſts under pretence of religion. The ſum of the hiſtory of the Jews is this—they continued to be a nation about a thouſand years, they then eſtabliſhed a law which they called the <hi>law of the Lord given by Moſes,</hi> and were deſtroyed. This is not opinion but hiſtorical evidence.</p>
            <p>Levi, the Jew, who has written an anſwer to the <hi>Age of Reaſon,</hi> gives a ſtrange account of the law called the law of Moſes.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking of the ſtory of the ſun and moon ſtanding ſtill, that the Iſraelites might cut the throats of all their enemies, and hang all their kings, as told in Joſhua, Chap. x. he ſays, <q>There is alſo another proof of the reality of this miracle, which is the appeal that the author of the book of Joſhua makes to the book of <hi>Jaſher, is not this written in the book of Jaſher.</hi> Hence continues Levi, it is manifeſt that the book, commonly called the book of Jaſher exiſted and was well known at the time the book of Joſhua was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0276701000:14"/>
written;</q> and pray, Sir, continues Levi, <q>what book do you think this was? <hi>why no other than the law of Moſes;</hi>
               </q> Levi, like the biſhop of Landaff and many other gueſs-work commentators, either forgets, or does not know, what there is in one part of the bible when he is giving his opinion upon another part.</p>
            <p>I did not, however, expect to find ſo much ignorance in a Jew with reſpect to the hiſtory of his nation, though I might not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at it in a biſhop. If Levi will look into the account given in the firſt Chap. 2d book of Samuel, of the Amalakite ſlaying Saul and bringing the crown and bracelets to David, he will find the following recital, ver. 15, 17, 18, <q>and David called one of the young men and ſaid, go near and fall upon him (the Amalakite) and he ſmote him that he died, and David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his ſon; alſo he bad them teach the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the uſe of the bow; <hi>behold it is written in the book of Jaſher.</hi>
               </q> If the book of Jaſher were what Levi calls it, the law of Moſes, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Moſes, it is not poſſible that any thing that David ſaid or did could be written in that law, ſince Moſes died more than five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before David was born; and on the other hand, admitting the book of Jaſher to be the law, called the law of Moſes, that law muſt have been written more than five hundred years after Moſes was dead, or it could not relate any thing ſaid or done by David. Levi may take which of theſe caſes he pleaſes, for both are againſt him.</p>
            <p>I am not going, in the courſe of this letter, to write a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary on the bible. The two inſtances I have produced, and which are taken from the beginning of the bible, ſhew the neceſſity of examining it. It is a book that has been read more, and examined leſs, than any book that ever exiſted. Had it come to us as an Arabic or Chineſe book, and ſaid to have been a ſacred book by the people from whom it came, no apology would have been made for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and diſorderly ſtate it is in. The tales it relates of the Creator would have been cenſured, and our pity been excited for thoſe who believed them. We ſhould have vindicated the goodneſs of God againſt ſuch a book, and preached up the diſbelief of it out of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to him. Why then do we not act as honorably by the Creator in the one caſe, as we would do in the other. As a Chineſe book we would have examined it; ought we not then to examine it as a Jewiſh book? The Chineſe are a people who have all the appearance of far greater an iquity than the Jews, and in point of permanency, there is no compariſon. They are alſo a people of mild manners, and of good morals, except where they have been corrupted by European com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. Yet we take the word of a reſtleſs bloody-minded people, as the Jews of Paleſtine were, when we would reject the ſame authority from a better people. We ought to ſee it is habit and prejudice that have prevented people from examining the bible. Thoſe of the church of England call it holy, becauſe the Jews called it ſo, and becauſe cuſtom and certain acts of parliament call it ſo, and they read it from cuſtom. Diſſenters read it for the purpoſe of doctrinal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0276701000:15"/>
and are very fertile in diſcoveries and inventions. But none of them read it for the pure purpoſe of information, and of rendering juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Creator by examining if the evidence it contains warrants the belief of its being what it is called. Inſtead of doing this, they take it blindfolded, and will have it to be the word of God whether it be ſo or not. For my own part, my belief in the perfection of the Deity, will not permit me to believe that a book ſo manifeſtly obſcure, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, and contradictory, can be his work. I can write a better book myſelf. This diſbelief in me proceeds from my belief in the Creator. I cannot pin my faith upon the <hi>ſay ſo</hi> of Hilkiah the prieſt, who ſaid he found it, or any part of it, nor upon Shaphan the ſcribe, nor upon any prieſt nor any ſcribe, or man of the law of the preſent day.</p>
            <p>As to acts of parliament, there are ſome that ſay, there are witches and wizzards; and the perſons who made thoſe acts (it was in the time of James the Firſt) made alſo ſome acts which call the bible the holy ſcriptures or word of God. But acts of parliament decide nothing with reſpect to God; and as theſe acts of parliament-makers were wrong with reſpect to witches and wizzards, they may alſo be wrong with reſpect to the book in queſtion. It is therefore neceſſary that the book be examined, it is our duty to examine i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the right of examination is ſinful in any government or in any judge or jury. The bible makes God to ſay to Moſes, Deut. chap. vii. 2d ver. <q>And when the Lord the God ſhall deliver them before thee, thou ſhalt ſmite them, and utterly deſtroy them, thou ſhalt make no covenant with them, <hi>nor ſhew mercy unto them.</hi>
               </q> Not all the prieſts, nor ſcribes, nor tribunals in the world, nor all the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of man, ſhall make me believe that God ever gave ſuch a <hi>Robeſperian precept</hi> as that of ſhewing <hi>no mercy;</hi> and conſequently it is impoſſible that I, or any perſon who believes as reverentially of the Creator as I do, can believe ſuch a book to be the word of God.</p>
            <p>There have been, and ſtill are, thoſe, who whilſt they <hi>profeſs</hi> to believe the bible to be the word of God affect to turn it into ridicule. Taking their profeſſion and conduct together, they act blaſphemouſly; becauſe they act as if <hi>God himſelf</hi> was not to be believed. The caſe is exceedingly different with reſpect to the <hi>Age of Reaſon.</hi> That book is written to ſhew from the bible itſelf, that there is abundant matter to ſuſpect it is not the word of God, and that we have been impoſed upon, firſt by Jews, and afterwards by prieſts and commentators.</p>
            <p>Not one of thoſe who have attempted to write anſwers to the <hi>Age of Reaſon</hi> have taken the ground upon which only an anſwer could be written. The caſe in queſtion is not upon any point of doctrine, but altogether upon a matter of fact. Is the book called the bible the word of God or is it not? If it can be proved to be ſo, it ought to be believed as ſuch; if not, it ought not to be believed as ſuch. This is the true ſtate of the caſe. The <hi>Age of Reaſon</hi> produces evidence to ſhew, and I have in this letter produced additional evidence, that it is <hi>not</hi> the word of God. Thoſe who take the contrary ſide, ſhould
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0276701000:16"/>
prove that it is. But this they have not done nor attempted to do, and conſequently they have done nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The proſecutors of Williams have ſhrunk from the point as the anſwerers have done. They have availed themſelves of prejudice inſtead of proof. If a writing was produced in a court of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſaid to be the writing of a certain perſon, and upon the reality or non-reality of which, ſome matter at iſſue depended, the point to be proved would be, that ſuch writing was the writing of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Or if the iſſue depended upon certain words, which ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſon was ſaid to have ſpoken, the point to be proved would be, that ſuch words were ſpoken by ſuch perſon? and Mr. Erſkine would contend the caſe upon this ground. A certain book is ſaid to be the word of God, what is the proof that it is ſo, for upon this the whole depends; and if it cannot be proved to be ſo, the proſecution fails for want of evidence.</p>
            <p>The proſecution againſt Williams charges him with publiſhing a book, entitled the <hi>Age of Reaſon,</hi> which, it ſays, is an impious blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous pamphlet, tending to ridicule and bring into contempt the holy ſcriptures. Nothing is more eaſy than to find abuſive words, and Engliſh proſecutions are famous for this ſpecies of vulgarity. The charge however is ſophiſtical; for the charge as growing out of the pamphlet ſhould have ſtated, not as it now ſtates, to ridicule and bring into contempt the holy ſcriptures, but to ſhew, that the books called the holy ſcriptures are not the holy ſcriptures. It is one thing if I ridicule a work as being written by a certain perſon; but it is quite a different thing, if I write to prove that ſuch work was not written by ſuch perſon. In the firſt caſe, I attack the perſon through the work; in the other caſe, I defend the honor of the perſon againſt the work. This is what the Age of Reaſon does, and conſequently the charge in the indictment is ſophiſtically ſtated. Every one will admit, that if the bible be <hi>not</hi> the word of God, we err in believing it to be his word, and ought not to believe it. Certainly, then, the ground the proſecution ſhould take, would be to prove that the bible is in fact what it is called. But this the proſecution has not done and cannot do.</p>
            <p>In all caſes the prior fact muſt be proved, before the ſubſequent facts can be admitted in evidence. In a proſecution for adultery, the fact of marriage, which is the prior fact, muſt be proved before the facts to prove adultery can be received. If the fact of marriage can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved, adultery cannot be proved; and if the proſecution can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove the bible to be the word of God, the charge of blaſphemy is viſionary and groundleſs.</p>
            <p>In Turkey they might prove, if the caſe happened, that a certain book was bought of a certain bookſeller, and that the ſaid book was written againſt the koran. In Spain and Portugal they might prove, that a certain book was bought of a certain bookſeller, and that the ſaid book was written againſt the infallibility of the pope. Under the ancient mythology they might have proved, that a certain writing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0276701000:17"/>
was bought of a certain perſon, and that the ſaid writing was written againſt the belief of a plurality of gods, and in the ſupport of the belief of one God: Socrates was condemned for a work of this kind.</p>
            <p>All theſe are but ſubſequent facts and amount to nothing, unleſs the prior facts be proved. The prior fact with reſpect to the firſt caſe is, Is the <hi>koran</hi> the word of God? with reſpect to the ſecond, Is the infallibility of the pope a truth? with reſpect to the third, Is the belief of a plurality of gods a true belief? and in like manner with reſpect to the preſent proſecution, Is the book called the <hi>bible</hi> the word of God? If the preſent proſecution prove no more than could be proved in any or all of theſe caſes, it proves only as they do, or as an inquiſition would prove; and, in this view of the caſe, the proſecutors ought at leaſt to leave off reviling that infernal inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the inquiſition. The proſecution, however, though it may injure the individual may promote the cauſe of truth; becauſe the manner in which it has been conducted appears a confeſſion to the world, that there is no evidence to prove that the bible is the word of God. On what authority then do we believe the many ſtrange ſtories that the bible tells of God.</p>
            <p>This proſecution has been carried on through the medium of what is called a ſpecial jury, and the whole of a ſpecial jury is nominated by t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e is to continue to appoint the whole ſpecial jury, which he does by nominating the forty-eight perſons from which the ſolicitor of each party is to ſtrike out twelve, Mr. Erſkine's bill is only vapour and ſmoke. The root of the grievance lies in the manner of forming the jury, and to this Mr. Erſkine's bill applies no remedy.</p>
            <p>When the trial of Williams came on, only eleven of the ſpecial jurymen appeared, and the trial was adjourned. In caſes where the whole number do not appear, it is cuſtomary to make up the deficiency by taking jurymen from perſons preſent in court. This, in the law term, is called a <hi>Tales.</hi> Why was not this done in this caſe? Reaſon will ſuggeſt, that they did not chuſe to depend on a man accidentally taken. When the trial recommenced the whole of the ſpecial jury ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and Williams was convicted: It is folly to contend a cauſe where the whole jury is nominated by one of the parties. I will relate a recent caſe that explains a great deal with reſpect to ſpecial juries in crown proſecutions.</p>
            <p>On the trial of Lambert and others, printers and proprietors of the Morning Chronicle, for a libel, a ſpecial jury was ſtruck on the prayer of the attorney-general, who uſed to be called Diabolus Regis or King's Devil.</p>
            <p>Only ſeven or eight of the ſpecial jury appeared, and the attorney-general not praying a <hi>Tales,</hi> the trial ſtood over to a future day, when it was to be brought on a ſecond time, the attorney-general prayed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0276701000:18"/>
for a new ſpecial jury, but as this was not admiſſible, the original ſpecial jury was ſummoned. Only eight of them appeared, on which the attorney-general ſaid, as I cannot, on a ſecond trial, have a ſpecial jury, I will pray a <hi>Tales.</hi> Four perſons were then taken from perſons preſent in court, and added to the eight ſpecial jurymen. The jury went out at two o'clock to conſult on their verdict, and the judge (Kenyon) underſtanding they were divided, and likely to be ſome time in making up their minds, retired from the bench, and went home. At ſeven, the jury went, attended by an officer of the court, to the judge's houſe, and delivered a verdict,
<q>Guilty of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing, but with no malicious intention.</q>
The judge ſaid,
<q>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not record this verdict; it is no verdict at all.</q>
The jury withdrew, and after ſetting in conſultation till five in the morning, brought in a verdict, NOT GUILTY. Would this have been the caſe, had they been all ſpecial jurymen nominated by the maſter of the crown-office? This is one of the caſes that ought to open the eyes of people with reſpect to the manner of forming ſpecial juries.</p>
            <p>On the trial of Williams, the judge prevented the counſel for the defendant proceeding in the defence. The proſecution had ſelected a number of paſſages from the Age of Reaſon, and inſerted them in the indictment. The defending counſel was ſelecting other paſſages to ſhew, that the paſſages in the indictment were concluſions drawn from premiſes, and unfairly ſeparated therefrom in the indictment. The judge ſaid, <hi>he did not know how to act;</hi> meaning thereby, whether to let the counſel proceed in the defence or not; and aſked the jury, if they wiſhed to hear the paſſages read which the defending counſel had ſelected. The jury ſaid, NO, and the defending counſel was in conſequence ſilence. Mr. Erskine then, Falſtaff-like, having all the field to himſelf, and no enemy at hand, laid about him moſt heroicly, and the jury found the defendant <hi>guilty.</hi> I know not if Mr. Erskine ran out of court and hallooed, huzza for the bible and the trial by jury.</p>
            <p>Robeſpiere cauſed a decree to be paſſed during the trial of Briſſot and others, that after a trial had laſted three days, (the whole of which time, in the caſe of Briſſot, was taken up by the proſecuting party) the judge ſhould ask the jury (who were then a packed jury) if they were ſatisfied? If the jury ſaid YES, the trial ended, and the jury proceeded to give their verdict, without hearing the defence of the accuſed party. It needs no depth of wiſdom to make an application of this caſe.</p>
            <p>I will now ſtate a caſe to ſhew, that the trial of Williams is not a trial according to Kenyon's own explanation of law.</p>
            <p>On a late trial in London (Selthens, verſus Hooſſman) on a policy of inſurance, one of the jurymen, Mr. Dunnage, after hearing one ſide of the caſe, and without hearing the other ſide, got up and ſaid, <hi>it was as legal a policy of inſurance as ever was written.</hi> The judge, who was the ſame as preſided on the trial of Williams, replied, <hi>that it was a great misfortune when any gentleman of the jury makes up his mind
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0276701000:19"/>
on a cauſe before it was finiſhed.</hi> Mr. Erskine, who in that caſe was counſel for the defendant; (in this, he was againſt the defendant) cried out, <hi>it is worſe than a misfortune, it is a fault.</hi> The judge in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the jury, in ſumming up the evidence, expatiated upon, and explained the parts, which the law aſſigned to the counſel on each ſide, to the witneſſes, and to the judge, and ſaid,
<q>When all this was done, <hi>AND NOT UNTIL THEN,</hi> it was the buſineſs of the jury to declare what the juſtice of the caſe was; and that it was extremely raſh and imprudent in any man to draw a concluſion before all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were laid before them, upon which that concluſion was to be grounded.</q>—According then to Kenyon's own doctrine, the trial of Williams is an irregular trial, the verdict an irregular verdict, and as ſuch, is not recordable.</p>
            <p>As to ſpecial juries, they are but modern; and were inſtituted for the purpoſe of determining caſes at <hi>law</hi> between merchants; becauſe, as the method of keeping merchants accounts differs from that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tradeſmen, and their buſineſs by lying much in foreign bills of exchange, inſurances, &amp;c. is of a different deſcription to that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tradeſmen, it might happen that a common jury might not be competent to form a judgment. The law that inſtituted ſpecial juries makes it neceſſary that the jurors be <hi>merchants,</hi> or of the degree of <hi>ſquires.</hi> A ſpecial jury in London is generally compoſed of merchants; and in the country of men called country ſquires, that is, fox-hunters, or men qualified to hunt foxes. The one may decide very well upon a caſe of pounds, ſhillings, and pence, or of the counting-houſe; and the other of the jockey-club or the chace. But who would not laugh, that becauſe ſuch men can decide ſuch caſes, they can alſo be jurors upon theology. Talk with ſome London merchants about ſcripture, and they will underſtand you mean <hi>ſcrip,</hi> and tell you how much it is worth at the Stock Exchange. Ask them about theology, and they will ſay, they know of no ſuch gentleman upon Change. Tell ſome country ſquires of the ſun and moon ſtanding ſtill, the one on the top of a hill, and the other in a valley, and they will ſwear it is a lie of one's own making. Tell them that God-Almighty ordered a man to make a cake and bake it with a t—d and eat it, and they will ſay, it is one of Dean Swift's blackguard ſtories. Tell them it is in the bible, and they will lay a bowl of punch it is not, and leave it to the parſon of the pariſh to decide. Ask <hi>them</hi> alſo about theology, and they will ſay, they know of no ſuch a one on the turf. An appeal to ſuch juries, ſerves to bring the bible into more ridicule than any thing the author of the Age of Reaſon has written; and the manner in which the trial has been conducted, ſhews, that the proſecutor dares not come to the point, nor meet the defence of the defendant. But all other caſes apart, on what ground of right, otherwiſe than on the right aſſumed by an inquiſition, do ſuch proſecutions ſtand. Religion is a private affair between every man and his Maker, and no tribunal or third party has a right to interfere between them. It is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a thing of this world; it is only practiſed in this world; but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0276701000:20"/>
its object is in a future world; and it is no otherwiſe an object of juſt laws than for the purpoſe of protecting the equal rights of all, however various their beliefs may be. If one man chuſe to believe the book called the bible to be the word of God; and another, from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced idea of the purity and perfection of God, compared with the contradictions the book contains; from the laſciviouſneſs of ſome of its ſtories, like that of Lot getting drunk and debauching his two daughters, which is not ſpoken of as a crime, and for which the moſt abſurd apologies are made; from the immorality of ſome of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, like that of ſhewing no mercy; and from the total want of evidence on the caſe, thinks he ought not to believe it to be the word of God: each of them has an equal right; and if the one has a right to give his reaſons for believing it to be ſo, the other has an equal right to give his reaſons for believing the <hi>contrary.</hi> Any thing that goes beyond this rule is an inquiſition. Mr. Erskine talks of his moral education; Mr. Erskine is very little acquainted with theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſubjects, if he does not know there is ſuch a thing as a <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> belief that the bible is not the word of God. This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; it is the belief of thouſands far more learned than Mr. Erskine; and is a belief that is every day increaſing. It is not infidelity, as Mr. Erskine prophanely and abuſively calls it: it is the direct reverſe of infidelity. It is a pure religious belief, founded on the idea of the perfection of the Creator. If the bible be the word of God, it needs not the wretched aid of proſecutions to ſupport it; and you might with as much propriety make a law to protect the ſunſhine as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the bible, if the bible, like the ſun, be the work of God. We ſee that God takes good care of the Creation he has made. He ſuffers no part of it to be extinguiſhed; and he will take the ſame care of his word, if he ever gave <hi>one.</hi> But men ought to be reverentially careful and ſuſpicious how they aſcribe books to him as his <hi>word,</hi> which from this confuſed condition, would diſhonour a common ſcribbler, and againſt which there is abundant evidence, and every cauſe to ſuſpect impoſition. Leave then the bible to itſelf. God will take care of it if he has any thing to do with it, as he takes care of the ſun and the moon, which need not your laws for their better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. As the two inſtances I have produced in the beginning of this letter, from the book of Geneſis, the one reſpecting the account called the Moſaic account of the Creation; the other of the flood, ſufficiently ſhew the neceſſity of examining the bible, in order to aſcertain what degree of evidence there is for receiving or rejecting it as a ſacred book. I ſhall not add more upon that ſubject; but in order to ſhew Mr. Erskine that there are religious eſtabliſhments for public worſhip which make no profeſſion of faith of the books called the holy ſcriptures, nor admit of prieſts, I will conclude with an account of a ſociety lately began in Paris, and which is very rapidly extending itſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſociety takes the name of Theophilantropes, which would be rendered in Engliſh by the word Theophilanthropiſts, word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0276701000:21"/>

               <hi>INTRODUCTION,</hi> ENTITLED, PRECISE HISTORY OF THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.</p>
            <q rend="inline normQuotes">
               <p>Towards the month of Vendimiaire, of the year 5, (Sept. 1796) there appeared at Paris, a ſmall work, entitled, Manuel of the Theoantropophiles, ſince called, for the ſake of eaſier pronunciation, Theophilantropes (Theophilanthropiſts) publiſhed by C —.</p>
               <p>The worſhip ſet forth in this Manuel, of which the origin is from the beginning of the world, was then profeſſed by ſome families in the ſilence of domeſtic life. But ſcarcely was the Manuel pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, than ſome perſons, reſpectable for their knowledge and their manners, ſaw, in the formation of a ſociety open to the public, an eaſy method of ſpreading moral religion, and of leading by degrees, great numbers to the knowledge thereof, who appear to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten it. This conſideration ought of itſelf not to leave indifferent thoſe perſons who know that morality and religion, which is the moſt ſolid ſupport thereof, are neceſſary to the maintenance of ſociety as well as to the happineſs of the individual. Theſe conſiderations deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the families of the Theophilantropiſts to unite publicly for the exerciſe of their worſhip.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſociety of this kind opened in the month of Nivoſe, year 5, (Jan. 1797,) in the ſtreet Denis, No. 34, corner of Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard-ſtreet. The care of conducting this ſociety was undertaken by five fathers of families. They adopted the Manuel of the Theophilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropiſts. They agreed to hold their days of public worſhip on the days correſponding to Sundays, but without making this a hindrance to other ſocieties to chuſe ſuch other day as they thought more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. Soon after this more ſocieties were opened, of which ſome celebrate <hi>on</hi> the decadi (tenth day) and others <hi>on</hi> the Sunday: It was alſo reſolved, that the committee ſhould meet one hour each week for the purpoſe of preparing or examining the diſcourſes and lectures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for the next general aſſembly. That the general aſſemblies ſhould be called Fetes (feſtivals) religious and moral. That thoſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0276701000:23"/>
feſtivals ſhould be conducted in principle and form, in a manner, as not to be conſidered as the feſtivals of an excluſive worſhip; and that in recalling thoſe who might not be attached to any particular wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, thoſe feſtivals might alſo be attended as moral exerciſes by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of every ſect, and conſequently avoid, by ſcrupulous care, every thing that might make the ſociety appear under the name of a ſect. The ſociety adopts neither <hi>rites</hi> nor <hi>prieſthood,</hi> and it will never loſe ſight of the reſolution not to advance any thing as a ſociety incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to any ſect or ſects, in any time or country, and under any government.</p>
               <p>It will be ſeen that it is ſo much the more eaſy for the ſociety to keep within this circle, becauſe, that the dogmas of the Theophilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropiſts are thoſe upon which all the ſects have agreed, that their moral is that upon which there has never been the leaſt diſſent; and that the name they have taken expreſſes the double end of all the ſects, that of leading to the <hi>adoration of God and love of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Theophilantropiſts do not call themſelves the diſciples of ſuch or ſuch a man. They avail themſelves of the wiſe precepts that have been tranſmitted by writers of all countries and in all ages. The reader will find in the diſcourſes, lectures, hymns, and canticles, which the Theophilanthropiſts have adopted for their religious and moral feſtivals, and which they preſent under the title of Armée Religieuſe, extracts from moraliſts, ancient and modern, diveſted of maxims too ſevere, or too looſely conceived, or contrary to piety, whether towards God or towards man.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Next follow the dogmas of the Theophilanthropiſts or things they profeſs to believe. Theſe are but two, and are thus expreſſed, les Theophilantropes croient à l'exiſtence de dieu et a l'immortalite de l'ame. The Theophilanthropiſts believe in the exiſtence of God, and the immortality of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>The manuel of the Theophilanthropiſts, a ſmall volume of ſixty pages, duodecimo, is publiſhed ſeparately, as is alſo their catechiſm, which is of the ſame ſize. The principles of the Theophilanthropiſts are the ſame as thoſe publiſhed in the firſt part of the Age of Reaſon in 1793, and in the ſecond part in 1795. The Theophilanthropiſts as a ſociety are ſilent upon all the things they do not profeſs to believe, as the <hi>ſacredneſs</hi> of the books called the bible, &amp;c. &amp;c. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the immortality of the ſoul, but they are ſilent on the immortality of the body, or that which the church calls the reſurrection. The author of the <hi>Age of Reaſon</hi> gives reaſons for every thing he <hi>diſbelieves</hi> as well as for thoſe he <hi>believes;</hi> and where this cannot be done with ſafety, the government is a deſpotiſm, and the church an inquiſition.</p>
            <p>It is more than three years ſince the firſt part of the Age of Reaſon was publiſhed, and more than a year and half ſince the publication of the ſecond part. The biſhop of Landaff undertook to write an anſwer to the ſecond part; and it was not until after it was known that the author of the Age of Reaſon would reply to the biſhop, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0276701000:24"/>
the proſecution againſt the book was ſet on foot; and which is ſaid to be carried on by ſome clergy of the Engliſh church. If the biſhop is one of them, and the object be to prevent an expoſure of the numerous and groſs errors he has committed in his work (and which he wrote when report ſaid that Thomas Paine was dead) it is a confeſſion that he feels the weakneſs of his cauſe, and finds himſelf unable to maintain it. In this caſe, he has given me a triumph I did not ſeek, and Mr. Erskine, the herald of the proſecution, has proclaimed it.</p>

               <hi>DISCOURSE OF THOMAS PAINE</hi> AT THE SOCIETY OF THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.</head>
            <p>RELIGION has two principal enemies, Fanaticiſm and Infidelity, or that which is called Atheiſm. The firſt requires to be combated by reaſon and morality, the other by natural philoſophy.</p>
            <p>The exiſtence of a God is the firſt dogma of the Theophilanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. It is upon this ſubject that I ſolicit your attention: for though it has been often treated of, and that moſt ſublimely, the ſubject is inexhauſtible; and there will always remain ſomething to be ſaid that has not been before advanced. I go therefore to open the ſubject, and to crave your attention to the end.</p>
            <p>The univerſe is the bible of a true Theophilanthropiſt. It is there that he reads of God. It is there that the proofs of his exiſtence are to be ſought and to be found. As to written or printed books, by whatever name they are called, they are the works of man's hands, and carry no evidence in themſelves that God is the author of any of them. It muſt be in ſomething that man could not make, that we muſt ſeek evidence for our belief, and that ſomething is the univerſe; the true bible; the inimitable word of God.</p>
            <p>Contemplating the univerſe, the whole ſyſtem of creation, in this point of light, we ſhall diſcover, that all that which is called natural philoſophy is properly a divine ſtudy—It is the ſtudy of God through his works—It is the beſt ſtudy, by which we can arrive at a knowledge of his exiſtence, and the only one by which we can gain a glimpſe of his perfection.</p>
            <p>Do we want to contemplate his power? we ſee it in the immenſity of the Creation. Do we want to contemplate his wiſdom? We ſee it in the unchangeable order by which the incomprehenſible WHOLE it governed. Do we want to contemplate his munificence? We ſee it in the abundance with which he fills the earth. Do we want to contemplate his mercy? We ſee it in his not with-holding that abundance even from the unthankful. In fine, do we want to know what God is? Search not written or printed books, but the ſcripture called the <hi>Creation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been the error of the ſchools to teach aſtronomy, and all the other ſciences, and ſubjects of natural philoſophy, as accompliſhments
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0276701000:26"/>
only; whereas they ſhould be taught theologically, or with reference to the Being who is the author of them; for all the principles of ſcience are of Divine origin. Man cannot make, or invent, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive principles. He can only diſcover them; and he ought to look through the diſcovery to the author.</p>
            <p>When we examine an extraordinary piece of machinery, an aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing pile of architecture, a well executed ſtatue, or an highly finiſhed painting, where life and action are imitated, and habit only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents our miſtaking a ſurface of light and ſhade for cubical ſolidity, our ideas are naturally led to think of the extenſive genius and talents of the artiſt. When we ſtudy elements of geometry, we think of Euclid. When we ſpeak of gravitation, we think of Newton. How then is it, that when we ſtudy the works of God in the Creation, we ſtop ſhort and do not think of God? It is from the error of the ſchools in having taught thoſe ſubjects as accompliſhments only, and thereby ſeparated the ſtudy of them from the Being who is the author of them.</p>
            <p>The ſchools have made the ſtudy of theology to conſiſt in the ſtudy of opinions in written or printed books; whereas theology ſhould be ſtudied in the works or book of the creation. The ſtudy of theology in books of opinions has often produced fanaticiſm, rancour, and cruelty of temper; and from hence have proceeded the numerous perſecutions, the fanatical quarrels, the religious burnings and maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, that have deſolated Europe. But the ſtudy of theology in the works of the creation produces a direct contrary effect. The mind becomes at once enlightened and ſerene; a copy of the ſcene it beholds; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and adoration go hand in hand; and all the ſocial faculties become enlarged.</p>
            <p>The evil that has reſulted from the error of the ſchools, in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing natural philoſophy as an accompliſhment only, has been that of generating in the pupils a ſpecies of Atheiſm. Inſtead of looking through the works of Creation to the Creator himſelf, they ſtop ſhort, and employ the knowledge they acquire to create doubts of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. They labour, with ſtudied ingenuity, to aſcribe every thing they behold to inmate properties of matter; and jump over all the reſt by ſaying, that matter is eternal.</p>
            <p>Let us examine this ſubject; it is worth examining; for if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it through all its caſes, the reſult will be, that the exiſtence of a ſuperior cauſe, or that which man calls God, will be diſcoverable by philoſophical principles.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, admitting matter to have properties, as we ſee it has, the queſtion ſtill remains, how came matter by thoſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? To this they will anſwer, that matter poſſeſſed thoſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties eternally. This is not ſolution, but aſſertion; and to deny it is equally as impoſſible of proof as to aſſert it. It is then neceſſary to go further, and therefore I ſay,—if there exiſt a circumſtance that is <hi>not</hi> a property of matter, and without which the univerſe, or to ſpeak in a limited degree, the ſolar ſyſtem, compoſed of planets and a ſun,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0276701000:27"/>
could not exiſt a moment; all the arguments of Atheiſm, drawn from properties of matter, and applied to account for the univerſe, will be overthrown, and the exiſtence of a ſuperior cauſe, or that which man calls God, becomes diſcoverable, as is before ſaid, by natural philoſophy.</p>
            <p>I go now to ſhew that ſuch a circumſtance exiſts, and what it is:</p>
            <p>The univerſe is compoſed of matter, and, as a ſyſtem, is ſuſtained by motion. Motion is <hi>not a property</hi> of matter, and without this motion the ſolar ſyſtem could not exiſt. Were motion a property of matter, that undiſcovered and undiſcoverable thing called perpetual motion would eſtabliſh itſelf. It is becauſe motion is not a property of matter, that perpetual motion is an impoſſibility in the hand of every being but that of the Creator of motion. When the pretenders to Atheiſm can produce perpetual motion, and not till then, they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be credited</p>
            <p>The natural ſtate of matter, as to place, is a ſtate of reſt. Motion, or change of place, is the effect of an external cauſe acting upon matter. As to that faculty of matter that is called gravitation, it is the influence which two or more bodies have reciprocally on each other to unite and be at reſt. Every thing which has hitherto been diſcovered with reſpect to the motion of the planets in the ſyſtem, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates only to the laws by which motion acts, and not to the cauſe of motion. Gravitation, ſo far from being the cauſe of motion to the planets that compoſe the ſolar ſyſtem, would be the deſtruction of the ſolar ſyſtem, were revolutionary motion to ceaſe; for as the action of ſpinning upholds a top, the revolutionary motion upholds the planets in their orbits, and prevents them from gravitating and forming one maſs with the ſun. In one ſenſe of the word, philoſophy knows, and atheiſm, ſays, that matter is in perpetual motion. But the motion here meant refers to the <hi>ſtate</hi> of matter, and that only on the ſurface of the earth. It is either decompoſition, which is continually deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the form of bodies of matter, or recompoſition, which renews that matter in the ſame or another form, as the decompoſition of animal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or vegetable ſubſtances enter into the compoſition of other bodies. But the motion that upholds the ſolar ſyſtem is of an entire different kind, and is not a property of matter. It operates alſo to an entire different effect. It operates to <hi>perpetual preſervation,</hi> and to prevent <hi>any change</hi> in the ſtate of the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>Giving then to matter all the properties which philoſophy knows it has, or all that atheiſm aſcribes to it, and can prove, and even ſuppoſing matter to be eternal, it will not account for the ſyſtem of the univerſe or of the ſolar ſyſtem, becauſe it will not account for motion, and it is motion that preſerves it. When, therefore, we diſcover a circumſtance of ſuch immenſe importance, that without it the univerſe could not exiſt, and for which neither matter, nor any, nor all, the properties of matter can account; we are by neceſſity forced into the rational and comfortable belief of the exiſtence of a cauſe ſuperior to matter, and that cauſe man calls GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0276701000:28"/>As to that which is called nature, it is no other than the laws by which motion and action of every kind, with reſpect to unintelligible matter, is regulated. And when we ſpeak of looking through nature up to nature's God, we ſpeak philoſophically the ſame rational lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as when we ſpeak of looking through human law up to the power that ordained them.</p>
            <p>God is the power or firſt cauſe, nature is the law, and matter is the ſubject acted upon.</p>
            <p>But infidelity by aſcribing every phaenomenon to properties of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, conceives a ſyſtem for which it cannot account, and yet it pretends to demonſtration. It reaſons from what it ſees on the ſurface of the earth, but it does not carry itſelf on the ſolar ſyſtem exiſting by motion. It ſees upon the ſurface a perpetual decompoſition and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſition of matter. It ſees that an oak produces an acorn, an acorn an oak, a bird an egg, an egg a bird, and ſo on. In things of this kind it ſees ſomething which it calls a natural cauſe, but none of the cauſes it ſees is the cauſe of that motion which preſerves the ſolar ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>Let us contemplate this wonderful and ſtupendous ſyſtem conſiſting of matter and exiſting by motion. It is not matter in a ſtate of reſt, nor in a ſtate of decompoſition or recompoſition. It is matter ſyſtematized in perpetual orbicular or circular motion. As a ſyſtem that motion is the life of it: as animation is life to an animal body, deprive the ſyſtem of motion, and, as a ſyſtem, it muſt expire. Who then breathed into the ſyſtem the life of motion? What power im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the planets to move ſince motion is not a property of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which they are compoſed? If we contemplate the immenſe velocity of this motion, our wonder becomes increaſed, and our adoration enlarges itſelf in the ſame proportion. To inſtance only one of the planets, that of the earth we inhabit, its diſtance from the ſun, the centre of the orbits of all the planets, is, according to obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the tranſit of the planet Venus, about one hundred million miles; conſequently the diameter of the orbit or circle in which the earth moves round the ſun is double that diſtance; and the meaſure of the circumference of the orbit, taken as three times its diameter, is ſix hundred million miles. The earth performs this voyage in 365 days and ſome hours, and conſequently moves at the rate of more than one million ſix hundred thouſand miles every twenty-four hours.</p>
            <p>Where will infidelity, where will atheiſm, find cauſe for this aſtoniſhing velocity of motion, never ceaſing, never varying, and which is the preſervation of the earth in its orbit? It is not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning from an acorn to an oak, from an egg to a bird, or from any change in the ſtate of matter on the ſurface of the earth, that this can be accounted for. Its cauſe is not to be found in matter nor in any thing we call nature. The atheiſt who affects to reaſon, and the fanatic who rejects reaſon, plunge themſelves alike into inextricable difficulties. The one perverts the ſublime and enlightening ſtudy of natural philoſophy into a deformity of abſurdities by not reaſoning to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0276701000:29"/>
the end. The other loſes himſelf in the obſcurity of metaphyſical theories, and diſhonours the Creator, by treating the ſtudy of his works with contempt. The one is a half-rational of whom there is ſome hope, the other a viſionary to whom we muſt be charitable.</p>
            <p>When at firſt thought we think of a Creator, our ideas appear to us undefined and confuſed; but if we reaſon philoſophically, thoſe ideas can be eaſily arranged and ſimplified. <hi>It is a Being whoſe power is equal to his will.</hi> Obſerve the nature of the will of man. It is of an infinite quality. We cannot conceive the poſſibility of limits to the will. Obſerve, on the other hand, how exceedingly limited is his power of acting compared with the nature of his will. Suppoſe the power equal to the will and man would be a God. He would will himſelf eternal, and be ſo. He could will a creation and could make it. In this progreſſive reaſoning, we ſee, in the nature of the will of man, half of that which we conceive in thinking of God, add the other half and we have the whole idea of a being who could make the univerſe, and ſuſtain it by perpetual motion; becauſe he could create that motion.</p>
            <p>We know nothing of the capacity of the will of animals; but we know a great deal of the difference of their powers. For example, how numerous are the degrees, and how immenſe is the difference of power, from a mite to a man. Since then every thing we ſee below us ſhews a progreſſion of power, where is the difficulty in ſuppoſing that there is at the <hi>ſummit of all things</hi> a Being in whom an infinity of power unites with the infinity of the will. When this ſimple idea preſents itſelf to our mind we have the idea of a perfect being that man calls God.</p>
            <p>It is comfortable to live under the belief of the exiſtence of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely protecting power; and it is an addition to that comfort to know, that ſuch a belief is not a mere conceit of the imagination, as many of the theories that are called religious are; nor a belief founded only on tradition or received opinion, but is a belief deducible by the action of reaſon upon the things that compoſe the ſyſtem of the univerſe; a belief ariſing out of viſible facts, and ſo demonſtrable is the truth of this belief, that if no ſuch belief had exiſted the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who now controvert it, would have been the perſons who would have produced and propagated it; becauſe, by beginning to reaſon, they would have been led on to reaſon progreſſively to the end, and thereby have diſcovered that matter and all the properties it has, will not account for the ſyſtem of the univerſe, and that there muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be a ſuperior cauſe.</p>
            <p>It was the exceſs to which imaginary ſyſtems of religion had been carried, and the intolerance, perſecutions, burnings, and maſſacres, they occaſioned, that firſt induced certain perſons to propagate infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; thinking, that upon the whole, it was better not to believe at all, than to believe a multitude of things and complicated creeds, that occaſioned ſo much miſchief in the world. But thoſe days are paſt; perſecution has ceaſed, and the antidote then ſet up againſt it has no

longer even the ſhadow of apology. We profeſs, and we proclaim in peace, the pure, unmixed, comfortable, and rational belief of a God, as manifeſted to us in the univerſe. We do this without any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of that belief being made a cauſe of perſecution as other beliefs have been, or of ſuffering perſecution ourſelves. To God, and not to man, are all men to account for their belief.</p>
            <p>It has been well obſerved at the firſt inſtitution of this ſociety, that the dogmas it profeſſes to believe, are from the commencement of the world; that they are not novelties, but are confeſſedly the baſis of all ſyſtems of religion, however numerous and contradictory they may be. All men in the outſet of the religion they profeſs are Theophilanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. It is impoſſible to form any ſyſtem of religion without build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon thoſe principles, and therefore they are not ſectarian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, unleſs we ſuppoſe a ſect compoſed of all the world.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid in the courſe of this diſcourſe, that the ſtudy of natural philoſophy is a divine ſtudy, becauſe it is the ſtudy of the works of God in the Creation. If we conſider theology upon this ground, what an extenſive field of improvement in things both divine and human opens itſelf before us. All the principles of ſcience are of divine origin. It was not man that invented the principles on which aſtronomy, and every branch of mathematics are founded and ſtudied. It was not man that gave properties to the circle and the triangle. Thoſe principles are eternal and immutable. We ſee in them the unchangeable nature of the Divinity. We ſee in them immortality, an immortality exiſting after the material figures that expreſs thoſe properties are diſſolved in duſt.</p>
            <p>The ſociety is at preſent in its infancy, and its means are ſmall; but I wiſh to hold in view the ſubject I allude to, and inſtead of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the philoſophical branches of learning as ornamental accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only, as they have hitherto been taught, to teach them in a manner that ſhall combine theological knowledge with ſcientific in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; to do this to the beſt advantage, ſome inſtruments will be neceſſary for the purpoſe of explanation, of which the ſociety is not yet poſſeſſed. But as the views of the ſociety extend to public good, as well as to that of the individual, and as its principles can have no enemies, means may be deviſed to procure them.</p>
            <p>If we unite to the preſent inſtruction, a ſeries of lectures on the ground I have mentioned, we ſhall, in the firſt place, render theology the moſt delightful and entertaining of all ſtudies. In the next place, we ſhall give ſcientific inſtruction to thoſe who could not otherwiſe obtain it. The mechanic of every profeſſion will there be taught the mathematical principles neceſſary to render him a proficient in his art. The cultivator will there ſee developed the principles of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; while, at the ſame time, they will be led to ſee the hand of God in all theſe things.</p>
