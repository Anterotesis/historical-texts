            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS I am under a neceſſity of giving a preface to the following work, I ſhall, in the language of our immortal countryman, <hi>imitate the</hi> ROMANS <hi>in brevity,</hi> as <hi>brevity is the ſoul of wit;</hi> and not be ſo ſtudious of the neceſſary ornaments of ſtile, as of relating FACTS, with the unbiaſs'd integrity of a faithful and impartial hiſtorian. This I have thought fit to premiſe, that the reader may not imagine he is running over a jumble of <hi>facts and fiction;</hi> ſince it is but too common, with modern authors of the poetical caſt, to lard their prefaces with a ſet of <hi>ingenious</hi> flouriſhes, which carry a greater air of rhodomontade than truth.</p>
            <p>The following tragedy was originally written in <hi>Italian,</hi> by the celebrated Signior FUNIDOSO DELL'ARUNDO, formerly a rope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker in <hi>Civita Vecchia;</hi> from which place he prudently retir'd, to avoid the addreſſes of the lady INQUISITION, who had a ſtrange hankering after his perſon, on account of his libertiniſm in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; for, though a <hi>Catholic</hi> in appearance, he was a <hi>Lutheran</hi> at heart. In the year 1751 he arrived in <hi>London,</hi> with that theatrical family of <hi>Italians,</hi> who gave the town ſuch exquiſite pleaſure, in the performance of ſeveral incomparable <hi>burlettas,</hi> all, or moſt of which, are ſaid (with what truth I will not venture to aſcertain, as I am writing a narrative of FACTS) to be the production of our <hi>hempen genius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the following year, which the reader, without my chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical aſſiſtance, will be able to diſcover to be the year 1752, Signior DELL'ARUNDO took ſhipping for <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reſiding in that part of the world, on account of the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the neceſſaries of life, and accordingly ſettled in a ſea port about thirty miles to the ſouthward of that place. He had not been many months in his new reſidence, till he married a widow, who was ſomewhat paſt the <hi>heyday of her blood;</hi> or, to ſpeak leſs poetically, pretty well ſtricken in years; and before he had been a dozen moons in his alter'd ſtate, to his great affliction, he loſt his lady. I might here, according to the uſual prolixity of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, take up my reader's time, by telling him of what diſtemper the <hi>Signiora</hi> departed this life; but, as I don't intend to clog my narrative with <hi>uſeleſs matters,</hi> I ſhall be totally ſilent on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: nay, I am ſo great a lover of conciſeneſs in hiſtory, that I ſhall not even ſo far intrude on my candid reader's leiſure, as to inform him that the lady died of a fit of the cholic.</p>
            <p>As our <hi>Italian phoenomenon</hi> was a great admirer of poetry, it is no wonder, after he had acquir'd a competent knowledge of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> language, that he receiv'd ſo ſenſible a pleaſure from the peruſal of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> poets. He was ſo captivated with the <hi>maſterly ſtyle and expreſſion</hi> of our dramatic authors (eſpecially <hi>the more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1193100600:4"/>ones)</hi> that he reſolv'd to collect the principal beauties in our language, and throw them into a tragedy, form'd on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> plan, in his native tongue; which he at length ſo happily exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, that his performance will <hi>undoubtedly</hi> be an honour to lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature in general, and to the <hi>Italian</hi> language in particular.</p>
            <p>In <hi>October</hi> 1756, our celebrated foreigner departed this life; and, according to the phraſe of our diurnal ſcribblers, <hi>univerſally lamented by all his acquaintance;</hi> and as a perpetual monument of the friendſhip, which had long exiſted between <hi>us,</hi> left his value<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able performance to my care, in the following words contain'd in the body of his laſt will and teſtament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item, I give and deviſe to my moſt dear friend, brother bard, and brother rope-maker,</hi> JOSEPH REED, <hi>late of</hi> STOCKTON <hi>aforeſaid, now of</hi> KING DAVID'S FORT, <hi>near</hi> Sun-Tavern-Fields, London, <hi>all and ſingular my piece, production, performance, drama, or tragedy, called</hi> MADRIGAL <hi>and</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note 1. in the Firſt Act.</note> TROLLETTA, <hi>with the prologue, epilogue, airs, odes, dirges, and all appurtenances thereunto belonging, or in any wiſe appertaining; to be tranſlated, alter'd, imitated, and made fit for the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>or other ſtage, by him the ſaid</hi> JOSEPH REED. <hi>I alſo will and require that the profits, ariſing from the publication, or theatrical exhibition of the ſaid tragedy, be applied and iſſued to, and for the ſole uſe, intereſt, behalf, ad-vantage, and emolument of him the ſaid</hi> JOSEPH REED, <hi>his heirs, executors, adminiſtrators, and aſſigns; only</hi> willing and requiring <hi>of him the ſaid</hi> JOSEPH REED, <hi>after ſuch tranſlation, alteration, or imitation is compleated, that the original</hi> at the ſole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the ſaid JOSEPH REED, <hi>may be ſent to the</hi> Vatican <hi>library at</hi> Rome, <hi>to be there preſerv'd as a perpetual monument of my dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic genius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have given this extract to prove my legal title to the Piece; for I muſt confeſs, not withſtanding that clauſe in the <hi>bard's</hi> MAGNA CHARTA, call'd <hi>poetica licentia,</hi> I think it little leſs than down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right robbery, to raiſe any conſiderable ſum from the tranſlation, or alteration of the works of an <hi>exotic</hi> brother, unleſs ſuch brother, or his deſcendents, be admitted to go ſnacks in the profits. I could wiſh that Mr. POPE had been of my opinion in this particular, but am ſorry to tell the world he <hi>was not,</hi> which I think no ſmall blemiſh in his character. It is univerſally known this great, tho' little man, pocketed <hi>ſome thouſands</hi> by his tranſlation of the works of MEONIDAS HOMER, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of the <hi>fine old Grecians;</hi> yet I could never learn (though I have made very ſtrict enquiry) that he had the gratitude or good manners, to ſend even a bill of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, or bank note of a cool hundred, to any of Mr. HOMER'S lineal deſcendents. I am aware that ſome of Mr. POPE'S advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates will be ready to bellow out, <hi>Zounds! the fellow's mad! Where the devil could be find ſuch deſcendents?</hi> — But pray, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, why did not your admir'd <hi>little friend</hi> advertiſe in all the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic papers in <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> to effect ſuch diſcovery? Inſtead of
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:1193100600:5"/>this, I could never find he advertis'd at all. — Had he but even iſſued out a notice to that purpoſe in our <hi>Daily Advertiſer only,</hi> I make no doubt but he would have had, within eight and forty hours of the publication, one or more claimants, who would have proved their lineal deſcent <hi>upon oath,</hi> which I think is as much ſatisfaction, as any reaſonable perſon, who is not a downright in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel, would require. — But to return to my ſubject.</p>
            <p>If it be plagiariſm, without benefit of clergy, to borrow a few lines from a native author, it is certainly as criminal to ſteal whole plays from a foreigner. — When I reflect on the prevalency of this iniquitous practice, I am ready to fall down on my <hi>marrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones,</hi> to return my humble and hearty thanks to goddeſs NATURE, for ſo kindly diſqualifying me for the perpetration of ſuch offence, by giving me the knowledge <hi>of one language only</hi> — The filching of plays, under cover of tranſlation, heaven knows, is a crime of no ſhort ſtanding — Nay, ſome of our countrymen have carried their villainy to a yet greater height, and ſtole plays with little or no alteration at all. Among theſe abandon'd plagiaries, I am told, was AARON HILL, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>of turgid, altering, and tranſlating memory.</hi> I have heard a report of his <hi>borrowing</hi> the tragedy of ZARA; and, as the ſtory is in few hands, I ſhall, by way of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, give it to my readers; at the ſame time moſt earneſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring and requiring my ſaid readers that it <hi>may go no further;</hi> for I would not be known to propagate any rumour, to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of an author, for whoſe memory I have ſo profound a veneration.</p>
            <p>In the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and — I have forgot what — Mr. THOMAS HUDSON, then an uſher to a grammar-ſchool at <hi>Durham,</hi> now a clergyman in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> tranſlated Monſ. VOLTAIRE'S <hi>Zaire.</hi> On ſending ſuch tranſlation to <hi>London,</hi> for the peruſal and examination of ſome connoiſſieur in drama, it unfortunately fell into the hands of a conſiderable dealer in hats: this <hi>beaverite</hi> having a more delicate taſte in the <hi>outſide,</hi> than <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide</hi> ornaments of a <hi>head,</hi> gave the piece to a friend for ſuch exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; by means of which friend poor Miſs <hi>Zara</hi> fell into the hands of the aforeſaid poetical raviſher, AARON, who
<q>
                  <l>Crop'd this fair roſe, and rifled all its ſweetneſs,</l>
                  <l>Then caſt it, like a loathſome weed, away.</l>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Otway's Orph.</hi>
                  </bibl>
               </q> that is, in plain proſe, pilfer'd the copy; and, the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the theft, gave out that <hi>the piece was abſolutely unfit for the ſtage;</hi> but, notwithſtanding ſuch inſinuation, in that, or the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaſon, Miſs <hi>Zara</hi> was thrown upon the town, and receiv'd with univerſal applauſe. It is true the play, <hi>in the ſtricteſt ſenſe,</hi> could not be HUDSON'S, as HILL had miſplac'd <hi>a ſingle ſcene,</hi> and made the <hi>conſiderable</hi> alteration of <hi>fifty lines or upwards,</hi> by which the property (according to modern authors' latitudinarian notions of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum) undoubtedly</hi> became his own—The above anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote I had from Mr. HUDSON; wherefore if brother AARON'S
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1193100600:6"/>ghoſt know it to be a fib, I humbly deſire the ſaid ghoſt to take a trip into the <hi>north,</hi> and confront the ſermonizer. I ſhall not pretend to aſcertain the truth of this charge, but only offer, as my private opinion, <hi>on the ſide of the church,</hi> that the ſtiles of the <hi>Engliſh Zara</hi> and <hi>Merope,</hi> (both the ſame author's in <hi>French)</hi> are almoſt as different, as thoſe of <hi>Jane Shore</hi> and <hi>Irene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this digreſſion, I ſhall lay before the public my embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſments concerning this tragedy. Signior DELL'ARUNDO had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately forgot, that his <hi>moſt dear friend</hi> underſtood no human language but that of his mother tongue: however, that no pains might be wanting, on my ſide, to do as much honour as I could to the production of my deceaſed brother, I got one of the <hi>Opera-Tranſlators</hi> to give me the piece in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but alas! the verſion was <hi>ſo very ſublime,</hi> that I could not poſſibly underſtand any three lines of it together. After this I employ'd my friend, PETER RONE, profeſſor of languages, to give me a literal tranſlation, which anſwer'd my purpoſe ſo well, that I was able to trace many of the beauties, our foreigner had borrow'd from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights. Where the context would allow, I have given the many <hi>ſtriking</hi> paſſages in the very dreſs of the reſpective authors, from whom they were undoubtedly borrow'd: where the text would not allow me ſuch paſſages in the very words, I have by parody, or imitation, kept as near the <hi>ſublime originals</hi> as I poſſibly could.</p>
            <p>Signior DELL'ARUNDO, in a codicil to his will, hath alſo left me, ſubject to the aforeſaid conditions, the farther legacy of three plays, viz. one Comedy and two Tragedies, called the <hi>Contraſt,</hi> the <hi>Diſtreſs'd Princeſs,</hi> and the <hi>Diſtreſs'd Wife.</hi> The Comedy is thought to be a tolerable piece; but as to the Tragedies, I muſt own I think them greatly inferior to the following work. They have no <hi>triumphal entries,</hi> ROMAN <hi>ovations, ſacrifices, dirges, proceſſions, ghoſts, drums, trumpets, thunder, lightning, battles, miraculous revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions</hi> (ſo neceſſary, according to Mr. BAYES'S rule, to ELEVATE and SURPRIZE) or any of that <hi>ſublime rant,</hi> which may be call'd the very ſoul of modern tragedy. In ſhort, they have nothing but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, propriety, and ſimplicity of fable and diction to recommend them. I have been advis'd to lard them plentifully with the above <hi>tragic artillery;</hi> but, ſo deprav'd is my taſte, that I cannot liſten to ſuch innovation: I rather chuſe to wait till <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>common ſenſe</hi> come into play again on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſtage. In the mean time, if the town have a deſire to ſee the theatrical exhibition of the ſaid pieces; and the ſaid town can or will raiſe me a patron, that hath influence ſufficient to procure their repreſentation, <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> of the ſaid pieces ſhall be at the ſervice of the public in the enſuing ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>That nothing might be wanting to render the following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction as entertaining as poſſible, I have prevailed on my learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ingenious friend, Dr. HUMBUG, to aſſiſt me in writing annotations to the piece.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1193100600:7"/>I can hardly conclude this preface, without an intimation of the excellency of Mr. DAVIS in the character of BUCKRAMO. I hope his <hi>voice, figure</hi> and <hi>abilities for the ſtage</hi> will, in the enſuing ſeaſon, intitle him to the regard of the Public on a PATENT THEATRE.</p>

                        <note n="31" place="bottom">In the 18th century, the inhabitants of <hi>Great Britain</hi> were very much addicted to drinking a liquid, call'd <hi>Geneva;</hi> or, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its uſual abbreviation, <hi>gin,</hi> which was a ſlow, but ſure poiſon. They ſwallow'd it, as the <hi>Turks</hi> do opium, meerly for the ſake of intoxication. The conſumption of this liquid was ſo great, that ſome thouſands of <hi>poiſoners general,</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by the <hi>modeſt</hi> appellation of <hi>diſtillers,</hi> got their liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; nay, ſome of them amaſs'd immenſe fortunes by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this inebriating ſpirit. So great was the ſkill of theſe chymical poiſoners, that they could extract this intoxicating liquor from moloſſes, juniper-berries, turpentine; nay, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, had they ſet about it, from the upper leathers of old ſhoes; but the chief, and moſt benefical principles, from which they could poſſibly draw this fatal juice, were wheat, barley, or other grain. In the years 1757 and 1758, on account of the real, or artificial ſcarcity of grain in <hi>England,</hi> theſe gentry were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the uſe of it, which ſo affected the diſtillery, that, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily for the nation, ſeveral of its profeſſors were obliged to leave off their pernicious trades, and launch into leſs deſtructive cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. During ſuch prohibition it was remark'd, that human excrement, both <hi>a priori</hi> and <hi>a poſteriori</hi> bore an advanced price, which might probably ariſe from the uſe of theſe fragrant mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials in diſtillery.

                           <p>As I intend in a few months to give the world a compleat edition of SHAKESPEAR'S works, in twenty volumes in folio, it may not, in this place, be amiſs to give a ſpecimen of my cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical abilities. My 475th note on the tragedy of <hi>Macbeth</hi> runs thus:
<q>
                                 <p>Though all the ſtream of editions concur in reading,
<q>
                                       <l>Or elſe my ſword with an unbatter'd edgr,</l>
                                       <l>I'll ſheath again undeeded. —</l>
                                    </q>
yet I am perſuaded our immortal poet, who never wrote a line of fuſtian in his life, could not be guilty of ſuch a turgid expreſſion. I ſhall therefore propoſe three ſeveral readings, one of which our poet certainly wrote:
<q>1. <l>Or elſe my ſword with an <hi>unſpatter'd</hi> edge,</l>
                                       <l>I'll ſheath again <hi>unſpeeded.</hi>—</l>
                                    </q>
as if he had ſaid, <hi>or elſe my ſword, with edge</hi> unſprinkled, <hi>or</hi> unſmear'd, <hi>with human gore, I'll ſheath again</hi> unſpeeded, <hi>i. e.</hi> unſucceſsful.
<q>2. <l>Or elſe my ſword, with an <hi>unbattled</hi> edge,</l>
                                       <l>I'll ſheath again <hi>unbleeded — that is,</hi> unbloody.</l>
                                    </q>
                                    <q>3. <l>Or elſe my ſword, with <hi>man-unbatten'd</hi> edge,</l>
                                       <l>I'll ſheath again <hi>in dead hide.</hi> —</l>
                                    </q>
q. d. <hi>or elſe my ſword, with edge</hi> unbatten'd, <hi>or</hi> unfatten'd with man, <hi>or</hi> the blood of man, <hi>I'll ſheath again</hi> in dead hide; that is, in the ſcabbard. To illuſtrate this image more fully, it may not be amiſs to add, that ſcabbards are generally made of <hi>dead hides,</hi> or leather. I am apt to think, from the analogy of ſound between <hi>in dead hide,</hi> and <hi>undeeded,</hi> that ſuch corruption hath crept into the text.</p>

                           <p>As I have now ended my annotations, and occaſionally ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd a few <hi>encomia</hi> on the play, it will be naturally expected I ſhould give my ſummary opinion of its merits, which I ſhall deliver, not ſo much with the candour of the friend, as the impartiality of the critick. I ſhall divide the ſubject of my remarks into three heads, viz. the fable, the manners, and the diction.</p>
                           <p>As to the fable — but it had quite ſlipt my memory, that the printer's boy hath been waiting this half hour at my elbow for the finiſhing note, wherefore I muſt defer my criticiſm, till the next edition of this tragedy.</p>

               <l>FROM the dear ſwain, who promiſes to wed me,</l>
               <l>My curioſity hath hither led me,</l>
               <l>To know what fate attends our author's lays;</l>
