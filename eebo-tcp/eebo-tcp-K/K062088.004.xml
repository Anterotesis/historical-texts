            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
            <p>WHEN firſt Willoughby arrived in
London, he had endeavoured to bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to a reſolution of ſeeing Celeſtina; but
her abſence at that time on a tour of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and the aſſurances he received that
ſhe was engaged to Montague Thorold,
not only diverted him from that intention,
but gave his ſiſter both time and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to repreſent her as neither wanting or
wiſhing for that attention, which he thought
he ſhould, as a friend, ſhew her. Theſe
inſinuations had gradually their effect: not
however in curing that invincible tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0206900204:4"/>
he always felt for her, but in mingling
with it ſo much bitterneſs that his life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more than ever wretched. The acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
meeting Celeſtina at an aſſembly,
gay, unconcerned, and, as he believed,
forgetting her former attachment to him in
her new preference to Montague Thorold;
the ſecond meeting, which happened at the
opera; and evéry thing that he heard both
from his ſiſter and in general converſation
where Celeſtina was mentioned, all ſerved
to confirm this idea; while the letter which
would have undeceived him, never reached
his hands. It was left with Lady Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux;
who, determined as ſhe was to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede
every advance towards a reconciliation
between her brother and Celeſtina, made
no ſcruple, on hearing from whom it came,
to open, read, and, after ſome conſideration,
to deftroy it.</p>
            <p>Of the apparent neglect, therefore, which
Celeſtina imputed to Willoughby, he had
accuſed <hi>ber;</hi> and thought, that if ſhe had
not determined to connect herſelf with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0206900204:5"/>
Montague Thorold without any attention
to his wiſhes or reliance on his regard, ſhe
would have written to or ſent to him: while
his neglect of a letter by which ſhe thought
ſhe ſhould awaken all the tenderneſs of
friendſhip which ſhe hoped he ſtill retained
for her, and the angry and diſdainful looks
with which he had twice met her, wounded
both her affection and her pride. Thus,
by the treachery of Lady Molyneux, all
commerce even of civility was at an end
between them; and ſuch was the ſituation
of Willoughby, when the Caſtlenorths ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
in London from Italy.</p>
            <p>Embarraſſed more and more in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and on the point of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with pecuniary diſtreſs, it was more
than time that he ſhould determine what to
do; and this determination, the return of
the Caſtlenorths to England was intended
to haſten.</p>
            <p>Always believing that to the artifices of
Lady Caſtlenorth he had owed his being
compelled to quit Celeſtina, and ſtill hoping
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0206900204:6"/>
to detect thoſe artifices, he had, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
viſits at his uncle's, and by a ſort of
tacit and reluctant acquieſcence in many of
his plans, given Miſs Fitz-Hayman great
reaſon to ſuppoſe that he intended fulfilling
his original engagement with her: yet now
that he ſaw he muſt either continue to act
what he could not but feel was a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and diſingenuous part, or break
with his uncle entirely, his uneaſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more inſupportable. The tortures
which he had felt in obſerving the favour
Celeſtina had ſhewn to Montague Thorold,
by whiſpering and laughing with him, gave
him a cruel foretaſte of what he ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
were he to ſee her married to him; yet
his reaſon, whenever he was calm enough
to liſten to it, told him how abſurd, how
improper it was, to indulge ſuch ſenſations
of anguiſh and regret; ſince, if the relation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
which had been hinted at did really
ſubſiſt between them, he could never take
any other part in regard to her than a
friendly and fraternal concern in her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0206900204:7"/>
and ſince the age, family, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Montague Thorold were all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
objection, he ought, if ſhe believed
ſuch an alliance would make her happy,
not only to rejoice in it but promote it.</p>
            <p>From this, however, his heart abſolutely
revolted; and all he could prevail upon
himſelf to think of was, to make for Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
ſome more ample proviſion if he was
once convinced of their relationſhip, and to
wiſh her happy: for to ſee her happy, when
another was to be the object of her love,
he found would be to him the cruelleſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
that Fate could inflict.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he thought, that ſince every
other woman on earth was indifferent to
him, he ought to learn to approve of Miſs
Fitz-Hayman, of whoſe apparently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
affection towards him he could not
be inſenſible. But love was never yet the
effect of effort; and while he compared her,
with all her laboured accompliſhments, to
Celeſtina, he found too certainly that he
never could love her, and that with ſuch
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0206900204:8"/>
ſentiments to promiſe it, was an unworthy
proſtitution of his honour.</p>
            <p>His coldneſs, however, and viſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance,
diſcouraged none of the other
parties who deſired this marriage: and
Miſs Fitz-Hayman, with all that pride
which her birth, her fortune, and the exalted
idea of her own merit, gave her, ſeemed to
be, either from her affection to Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
or ſome other cauſe, content to receive
his hand with the hope of afterwards win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his heart. Convinced that he had no
attachment but to Celeſtina, and certain
that the impediments between them muſt
effectually prevent his ever again thinking
of her with the fond partiality he had done,
ſhe ſeemed very eaſy as to his indifference
towards herſelf; foreſeeing, perhaps, that
their lives would be ſuch after they were
married as would very ſoon produce it, if
they did not ſet out with it: or, to judge
more candidly, ſhe might think with pride
and pleaſure of conquering, as his wife, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0206900204:9"/>
coldneſs to which, as his miſtreſs, ſhe could
not be inſenſible.</p>
            <p>Lord Caſtlenorth had ſo determined a
predilection for the match, which the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
he had met with had by no means
abated, that he would not ſee any thing that
appeared inimical to this his darling ſcheme.
His great object was—and he forgot his
infirmities as he purſued it—to procure for
Willoughby the reverſion of all his titles,
and, to change his name to Fitz-Hayman.
This he found would be attended with no
great difficulty; and now, whenever he ſaw
his nephew, he enumerated all the ſpecies
of ſatisfaction which in his opinion would
attend theſe acquirements, dwelling with
great delight on the circumſtance of the
family arms remaining unchanged; though
he offered to quarter thoſe of Willoughby,
if their owner found any reluctance in
parting with them entirely.</p>
            <p>From theſe harangues, which nothing
could for a moment render intereſting to
Willoughby, <hi>his</hi> imagination was often quite
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0206900204:10"/>
abſent, and ſled after Celeſtina, whom it
repreſented as making the felicity of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague
Thorold, and enjoying with him that
life of elegant and literary retirement, which
he had himſelf fondly hoped to ſhare with
her. Frequently, when his uncle was
talking to him of his anceſtor, Reginald
Fitz-Hayman, who in the reign of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
IV. was ſlain by the celebrated Hotſpur,
then in rebellion, after having twice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſed
him, deſcribing the circumſtances
of the combat, and ſtill more minutely
the bearings thereupon granted in addition
to their former coat, Willoughby, far from
attending to him, was meditating on ſome
walk he had taken with Celeſtina during their
ſhort happineſs at Alveſtone the preceding
ſpring; on the remarks ſhe had made, and
the improvements ſhe had ſuggeſted; and
having no idea of what his uncle was talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about, only under ſtanding by his tone
when he ended a period, he ſaid—"To be
ſure"—"Oh certainly"—"Very great"—"Undoubtedly"—without
knowing or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0206900204:11"/>
whether theſe words were well placed:
while Lord Caſtlenorth was too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with the pleaſure of hearing himſelf
talk on his favourite topic, to remark, that
Willoughby knew not a ſyllable of what he
was ſaying; and the latter had really ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
ſuch a habit of inattention to thoſe
ſubjects about which his uncle paraded,
that he not unfrequently had, in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
aſſented to plans relative to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and his reſidence after his marriage,
when in reality he had not, on the diſcourſe
to which he ſeemed to liſten, formed any
one idea.</p>
            <p>A few days only paſſed in this manner
after the return of the Caſtlenorths to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
before the extreme pain he felt, the
ſecond time of ſeeing Celeſtina in public,
made him ſenſible of his inability to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
long in this undecided and wretched
ſtate. From mere acquieſcence in miſery,
or rather from an hope to eſcape from it by
detecting Lady Caſtlenorth's ſchemes, he
had become inſenſibly more deeply entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0206900204:12"/>
in them: and he now began to accuſe
himſelf of very unjuſtifiable conduct; ſince
not all the diſtreſſing circumſtances of his
fortune, not the certainty of Celeſtina's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
loſt to him, nor the pleaſure of ſaving
his paternal eſtate, and particularly Alveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone,
which, after Celeſtina, had always
been his firſt object, could, on a ſtrict ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of his own heart, lead him to
form a ſerious wiſh of becoming the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of Miſs Fitz-Hayman: and he was
conſcious that every part of his behaviour
that had raiſed contrary expectations, was
owing rather to his deſpair of obtaining one
woman than to his wiſh of being united to
another.</p>
            <p>His mind was now in ſuch a ſtate of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
debate and perplexity, that nothing
had the power a moment to amuſe or pleaſe
him. His ſiſter, without an heart herſelf,
had no notion of the corroſive ſenſations
that preyed on his; his health, though far
from being reſtored, was ſuch as no longer
offered her any proſpect of becoming the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0206900204:13"/>
heireſs to what family property was left;
and ſince her brother did live, her wiſh was
to have him live in ſplendour, graced with
the happineſs of nobility, and reflecting
honour on her by his affluence and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.
Her diſlike of Lady Caſtlenorth
and her daughter was long ſince loft in the
more inveterate diſlike ſhe had conceived
againſt Celeſtina, ſince ſhe had been ſo
much ſeen in good company in London,
and ſo much celebrated for her beauty:
ſhe always therefore affected to conſider his
marriage with Miſs Fitz-Hayman as a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
thing; and from the moment of the
Caſtlenorths return to England, ſhe joined,
with more zeal than her ſelfiſh indolence
uſually permitted her to feel for any thing,
in promoting it.</p>
            <p>Thus beſet by his family, and on the
other hand harraſſed by the encreaſing cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of his creditors, who offered him only
the fad alternative of felling Alveſtone, and
whoſe impatience was fomented by the
artful management of Lady Caſtlenorth,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0206900204:14"/>
Willoughby for ſome litle time lingered
and heſitated: now thought that he ought
to marry, when ſuch advantages were to
be acquired by it, now recoiled from the
dreadful idea of paſſing his life with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who was indifferent to him, and whom
he doubted whether he could ever learn to
love. Even in the ſymptoms of her regard
for him, which were unequivocal enough,
there was ſomething which rather diſguſted
than flattered him; and when he thought
how different were their minds, their tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and their purſuits, no earthly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
ſeemed to have ſufficient weight
with, him, to make him reſolve on putting
on a yoke ſo uneaſy to his imagination.</p>
            <p>The repeated ſight of Celeſtina made all
his wounds bleed afreſh. He found, that
neither the ſuſpicions of their relationſhip,
or what he thought the certainty of her
alienation from him, were ſtrong enough
to counteract the effect of the long rooted
affection he felt for her: but he believed
that if those ſuſpicions once amounted to a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0206900204:15"/>
certainty—if once he was thoroughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
Celeſtina was his ſiſter, he ſhould
learn to conquer every other ſentiment in
regard to her but what he might with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
indulge.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon, and becauſe he found
ſome ſatisfaction in the delay this journey
would give him a pretence for, and thought
that mere change of place would afford
him ſome relief, he determined to ſet out
in ſearch of that ſervant, Hannah Biſcoe,
to whom he had obtained a direction in
Italy, and whom he had been detained
from viſiting partly by his ill ſtate of health
and partly by the artifices of Lady Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux.</p>
            <p>After ſhe and Lady Caſtlenorth had met,
however, her oppoſition to this journey
was withdrawn; and he ſet out on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
attended only by his old ſervant
Farnham, intending to reach the village to
which he was directed, and which was on the
borders of Lancaſhire, by eaſy journies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0206900204:16"/>
Miſs Fitz-Hayman, to whom he had
ſaid that every conſideration urged him to
a complete developement of the myſtery
now that it ſeemed to be in his power, ſaw
him depart with an appearance of reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
but Willoughby had ſeen her, ever
ſince her arrival in England, making par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for public places without him, if he
happened not to be able or diſpoſed to go;
and found, that during his abſence ſhe
would proceed in the ſame courſe of amuſement;
and that ſhe and her mother would
find no inconvenience for want of an eſcort,
as they had brought over with them an Iriſh
officer, who had been in the ſervice of
France,- with whom Lady Caſtlenorth had
contracted an intimacy a few years before
in Italy, which in their laſt journey to the
Continent had been renewed and encreaſed:
in conſequence of which, Captain Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naugh
had accompanied them to London,
where he had apartments in the houſe, and
was become one of the family. At all
places of public reſort he attended on Lady
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0206900204:17"/>
Caſtlenorth; ſat by her at the upper end of
the table to carve for her; and acted as a
ſort of gentleman uſher to the mother,
while he treated the daughter with the moſt
profound reverence and reſpect.</p>
            <p>This gentleman was three or four and
thirty. His face was handſome, and his
figure, though large, uncommonly fine.
He had ſeen a great deal of ſervice and of
the world; ſpoke all European languages
except Engliſh, well, and with all the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of a Frenchman, had enough of the
national character ſtill about him, to mark
him for an Iriſhman.</p>
            <p>He was, indeed, ſufficiently proud of
his country, and piqued himſelf on being
deſcended from the kings of Leinſter; and
Lord Caſtlenorth, to whom he contrived to

to long ſtories, by his knowledge

Lord Caſtlenorth, among other doubts on
this and equally important ſubjects with
which he amuſed himſelf, ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
whether the genealogy of Captain
Cavanaugh might not be traced back in
Ireland a generation or two beyond his own
in Normandy, a circumſtance which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
his reſpect, and gave, in his opinion,
weight and value to thoſe qualities by which
the Captain contrived to render himſelf,
throughout the family, ſo very acceptable.</p>
            <p>Willoughby had ſeen him with them
once or twice abroad, but had not then
particularly noticed him among that croud
of all nations and deſcriptions which Lady
Caſtlenorth contrived to collect around her
there. He now ſaw him, not without a
ſlight degree of ſurpriſe, domeſticated in
the family; but his whole attention ſeemed
to be given to the elder members of it; and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0206900204:19"/>
he hardly ever ſpoke to Miſs Fitz-Hayman,
who, when Willoughby one day took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to remark that he was on a footing
of greater intimacy than formerly, anſwered,
with ſomething like a careleſs ſneer—"Oh
you know that Cavanaugh has long been
my mother's great favourite."</p>
            <p>In the ſocieties of London, however,
this intimacy became the ſubject of ſome
malicious comments; and Lady Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux,
who ſeldom let any thing of that
ſort eſcape her, could not forbear indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
herſelf in ſome remarks on Lady Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenorth's
friendſhip, even before her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who gave, however, ſo little atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to what he heard, that before he reached
the end of his firſt day's journey he had
forgot that ſuch a perſon as the Captain
exiſted, as he would probably have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Lady Caſtlenorth herſelf, had not the
purpoſe of his preſent journey, and all the
tranſactions of the laſt twelve months of his
life, brought her and the conſequences of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0206900204:20"/>
thoſe tranſactions too forcibly to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>While Willoughby was thus on his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
the diſquiet and unhappineſs of Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,
though ſhe was compelled to appear
to conquer them, were but little abated.</p>
            <p>Nothing, in the opinion of Lady Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
contributed ſo much to wean the mind
from indulging ſorrow or encouraging
weakneſs, as variety of company and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
diſſipation; and in theſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
her reluctance, Celeſtina was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
engaged. She now more than ever
regretted that ſhe had relinquiſhed that
plan of life which ſhe had fixed upon when
firſt left, by the death of Mrs. Willoughby,
to ſeek a new one. The quiet farm houſe
in Devonſhire where Cathcatt and Jeſſy
lived, the tender attention ſhe ſhould be
there ſure to meet with, the not unpleaſing
melancholy of Mrs. Elphinſtone, and the
perfect ſecluſion ſhe might there enjoy from
a world where nothing gave her any real
pleaſure, were ideas which were now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0206900204:21"/>
returning to her mind with new
power. There, ſhe thought her ſad heart
might be laid open to the pitying ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of her firſt and moſt beloved friend,
and find ſome ſatisfaction amidſt it's own
diſappointments in witneſſing the happineſs
of that friend, to which ſhe had been ſo,
greatly inſtrumental; and there ſhe might
wander whole days among the fields and
copſes, indulging herſelf in repeating the
name of Willoughby, in thinking of him,
in reading again thoſe books they had read
together, painting the plants he admired,
and compoſing melancholy verſes, which
above every other occupation ſoothed her
mind. But when ſhe had repreſented to
herſelf all the mournful pleaſure ſhe ſhould
in ſuch a ſituation enjoy, and half determined
to gratify herſelf, the ingratitude of which
ſhe ſhould be guilty towards Lady Horatia
deſtroyed her reſolves; and alas! ſhe recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
too, that at the farm of Jeſſy ſhe ſaw
from almoſt every field, and from ſome of
the windows of the houſe, Alveſtone Park,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0206900204:22"/>
where Miſs Fitz-Hayman would ſoon be
miſtreſs; the ſight ſhe thought ſhe could
not bear; and her mind turned with terror
from the idea of it. There were alſo very
ſtrong objections againſt her going into the
immediate neighbourhood of Montague
Thorold, if ſhe meant not to give him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement;
and theſe conſiderations
adding to the impracticability of her quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
without better reaſons than a mere wiſh
of retirement, ſuch a generous protectreſs
as Lady Horatia, determined her to wean
her mind from an inclination ſhe could not
properly indulge, and to move on as well
as ſhe could in the weariſome circle; till
the time arrived when Lady Horatia ſet out
on her ſummer tour, which was to begin
by going to Matlock, from whence ſhe
was to go into Wales, and then end the
ſummer at Cheltenham.</p>
            <p>Vavaſour had been ſo long abſent, that
Celeſtina began to hope his pride and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
had ſubdued every wiſh to purſue
her. In this, however, ſhe was miſtaken:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0206900204:23"/>
a few days after the departure of Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he called, and was admitted. Lady
Horatia and Celeſtina, though neither of
them were pleaſed to ſee him, yet received
him with civility, and entered on common
topics, ſuch as the occurrences of the day
afford; to theſe he appeared very inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and turning abruptly to Celeſtina, he
ſaid—"Miſs De Mornay, cannot I ſpeak
to you alone?"</p>
            <p>She heſitated a moment, and then ſaid—"I
believe, Mr. Vavaſour, there is nothing
you can have to communicate to me, that
ought to be a ſecret to Lady Horatia How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard."</p>
            <p>"There is, Madam," returned he with
quickneſs, and appearing much diſpleaſed
with her apparent diſinclination to oblige
him, "for what I have to ſay relates in
ſome meaſure to others, whoſe confidence
I have no right to betray whatever I may
chuſe to do in thoſe circumſtances that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
only to myſelf."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0206900204:24"/>
Lady Horatia now roſe, and ſaid—"My
dear, oblige Mr. Vavaſour if he wiſhes to
ſpeak to you without witneſſes." She then
left the room.</p>
            <p>"Now, Madam," ſaid Vavaſour, as
ſoon as ſhe had ſhut the door—"now you
have no longer an excuſe to repulſe or deny
me: Willoughby aſſuredly quits you for
ever: and nothing ought, nothing ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede
my pretenſions. Emily—my poor
Emily herſelf—on whoſe account I own to
you I have heſitated more than once, wiſhes
my ſucceſs, and bids me ſay, that convinced
my happineſs depends upon you, ſhe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws
every claim which ſhe had on my
heart, and beſeeches you to believe it is not
unworthy your acceptance."</p>
            <p>"Emily, Sir?" cried Celeſtina in ſome
ſurpriſe: "of whom do you ſpeak? and
how can a perſon to whoſe very name I am
a ſtranger, be likely in ſuch a caſe to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
me?"</p>
            <p>"Don't affect," ſaid he, "the ridiculous
prudery of diſclaiming any knowledge of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0206900204:25"/>
her, becauſe ſhe does not rank among thoſe
who are falſely called virtuous women: by
heaven ſhe has virtues that might redeem
the vices of half her ſex; not one in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
of whom poſſeſs a twentieth part of
her worth."</p>
            <p>"I mean not," anſwered Celeſtina,
mildly, "to diſpute her value, but only
to aſk on what pretenſion you urge to me
either the reſignation or opinions of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with whom I have no acquaintance."</p>
            <p>"Why will you pretend not to know
her," reſumed he with redoubled impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity—"why
affect not to know that
Emily, who has lived with me almoſt twelve
months, is the ſiſter of your Mrs. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
and of that Cathcart whom Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
picked up and placed as his ſteward at
Alveſtone."</p>
            <p>"I have heard there is ſuch a perſon,"
ſaid Celeſtina: "but I did not know ſhe
lived with you."</p>
            <p>"Yes, ſhe has lived with me ſome time,
though I did not till lately know her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0206900204:26"/>
Unworthy and diſgraced as you may
think her, ſhe ſhould at this moment have
been miſtreſs of my houſe and my fortune,
by what you would call legal claims, if I
had not, like a curſed fool as I am, taken
up a paſſion for you which I cannot get rid
of, and which my generous little girl not
only knows, but with diſintereſted affection,
inſtead of trying to diſſuade me from it,
wiſhes me to ſucceed in. I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fancied, that your knowledge of my
attachment to her was in my way; and that
circumſtance, together with the eternal
myſtery that always hung over Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's
intentions—in ſhort, my hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cured of a damned folly, by reaſon and
abſence, inſtead of matrimony, have alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
made me refrain from viſiting you
lately. But now I think, ſince George is
gone out of town and returns only to be
married to Miſs Fitz-Hayman, there is an
end of that; and for my experiment—curſe
me if I believe it will do; and ſo here
I am again, more in love and a greater
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0206900204:27"/>
blockhead than ever. Don't, however,
miſtake me, Celeſtina: I will not, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bear to be triſled with; nor will I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
one hour, either to your coquetry or
to the abſurd partiality which I ſometimes
uſed to believe you had, for that whining,
ſnivelling Montague Thorold. If there are
no other pretenſions than his in the way, I
ſhall ſoon know how to ſettle the matter."</p>
            <p>"Really, Mr. Vavaſour," ſaid Celeſtina,
as ſoon as he would give her an opportunity
of ſpeaking, "your conduct and manners
are ſo eccentric, that it is difficult to know
what to ſay to you, which you will not call
either prudery or coquetry, or impute to a
partiality for ſome other perſon. Permit
me, however, to tell you, with that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
with which I have always ſpoke on
this ſubject, that I am ſenſible of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
you do me, but that I never can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it, even though my ſituation were to
be more humble than it is, and though
ſuch a man as Mr. Montague Thorold had
never exiſted."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0206900204:28"/>
"Oh! very well, Madam," cried Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour,
impatiently interrupting her—"You
muſt, however, allow me to aſk your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections:
are they to my perſon? my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily?
my fortune?"</p>
            <p>"I have already ſaid, Sir, that they are
all unexceptionable."</p>
            <p>"Well, Madam, I muſt then infer from
your refuſal, that you are engaged."</p>
            <p>"No, Sir, that inference by no means
follows. Pardon me if I ſay, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all the advantages you poſſeſs, it
is poſſible for a perſon to decline the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of your addreſſes without being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged."</p>
            <p>"However, Madam, do you or do
you not deny that ſuch an engagement does
exiſt? Of that, I think, I have a right to
enquire."</p>
            <p>"Forgive me, Sir, if I anſwer that it
does not ſeem to me that you have any
right in the world to aſk that queſtion of
me."</p>
            <p>"Well then, I ſhall aſk it elſewhere."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0206900204:29"/>
"Where you have, if poſſible, ſtill leſs
right," ſaid Celeſtina, alarmed at his vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence.</p>
            <p>"You are, however, very quick at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
to whom I allude."</p>
            <p>"Certainly, after what you have juſt
ſaid, I cannot miſtake your meaning. You
allude to Mr. Montague Thorold."</p>
            <p>"Damn him," cried Vavaſour, riſing,
and ſpeaking with vehemence that made
her ſhudder, "that puppy croſſes me like
my evil genius. By any man at all worthy
of you, I might perhaps bear to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted;
but by ſuch a ſilly fellow as that—no,
damn it, there is no enduring it—curſe
me if it does not make me frantic."</p>
            <p>"Hear me then, Mr. Vavaſour—hear
me for the laſt time—for I never will again
willingly expoſe myſelf to this ſort of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>I am not</hi> engaged to Mr. Thorold:
it is not likely I ever ſhall be engaged to
him; and farther, I again proteſt to you,
that did no ſuch perſon exiſt it would make
no difference in the reſolution I have made
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0206900204:30"/>
never to liſten to the offers with which you
honour me."</p>
            <p>This declaration, repeated ſo ſtrongly,
ſerved but to inflame thoſe paſſions which
Celeſtina hoped it would repreſs, and piqued
his pride, without deſtroying what he called
love. He walked backwards and forwards
in the room a moment or two, and ſeemed
to be reaſoning with that extravagant
warmth of temper ſhe had complained of:
but his eyes and his manner expreſſed
plainly what he forbore to utter. After a
while, he appeared to have conquered the
inclination he felt to give way to the rage
that poſſeſſed him; and ſitting down by
her, he ſoftened his voice as much as he
could, though it trembled through the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of emotions he felt, and endeavoured
to ſpeak calmly while he ſaid—"Celeſtina,
if this be really the caſe—if I may venture
to believe you, you will not ſurely refuſe
to ſatisfy me a little farther. I am not a
vain coxcomb: but I know that neither
my figure or my underſtanding are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0206900204:31"/>
temptible; I have a very affluent fortune;
and I have an heart that, as you well know,
adores you. Willoughby cannot or will
not marry you; of that I think you can no
longer doubt. You ſay, that you are not
engaged to the young Doctor Thorold;
tell me then, what there is, that overba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing
ſo many points in my favour, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them all ineffectual."</p>
            <p>"And I will tell you candidly, Mr.
Vavaſour. My objections then are, to your
morals—to your principles: they may not
be, and I dare ſay are not, worſe than thoſe
of other young men of fortune who have
equal opportunities of following their own
inclinations: but however that may be,
they are ſuch as would inevitably make me
unhappy; and knowing that, it would be
extreme folly were any advantages which
affluence can offer to induce me to riſk it."</p>
            <p>"My morals!" cried Vavaſour—"again
my morals!—and pray what part of what
you are pleaſed to call my morals is it that
gives you ſo much offence?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0206900204:32"/>
"All," anſwered ſhe. "Your manner
of life—your attachments—your connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which you have juſt acknowledged
you could not, without heſitation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance,
quit."</p>
            <p>"Still you will miſunderſtand me. What
I ſaid in regard to Emily ſurely went to a
very different meaning. I told you, that
you are the only woman upon earth for
whom I would quit her; and the greater
my regard has been for her, ſurely the
greater it makes out my attachment to you,
for whom I would relinquiſh her. By hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!
I cannot tell how far my affection for
her might have carried me, if my paſſion
for you had not taken ſo deep root in my
heart; and curſe me, if amidſt it all I do
not ſtill love her dearly, and would give
half my eſtate to make her happy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh
her health; but poor dear girl—ſhe
will never, I am afraid, recover."</p>
            <p>"If her illneſs is occaſioned by her fears
of loſing you, Sir," ſaid Celeſtina, "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
at once the cauſe of it by thinking of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0206900204:33"/>
me no more. If you love her as much as
you expreſs, ſurely this cannot be difficult;
and why, feeling this attachment to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
whom you think ſo deſerving of it,
ſhould you, contrary to the dictates of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
purſue one who never can return the
good opinion you entertain of her."</p>
            <p>"Becauſe of my morals! Ridiculous
cant and falſehood. Don't I know that
women all like the very libertiniſm they are
pleaſed outwardly to condemn? Don't I
know that the proudeſt, the moſt prudiſh
among ye, are flattered by the attention of
thoſe men who are called the greateſt rakes,
and that if any queer fellow ſets up to be a
moral man, ye all laugh at and deſpiſe
him. This ſort of ſtuff about morals, you
have learned, I ſuppoſe, either from old par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
Thorold, or this good motherly gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
you live with: but you, who have
ſo much ſenſe, cannot ſeriouſly perſiſt in
ſuch methodiſtical cant; and as to any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
about Emily—"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0206900204:34"/>
"Don't miſtake me, Mr. Vavaſour. I
made no mention of her in the way of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection."</p>
            <p>"Well then," cried he, interrupting her,
"as to my morals in every other reſpect
they are really exemplary. I play, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively,
very little; I don't drink a fifth
part ſo much as half the people I live with;
and I reckon myſelf, upon the whole, a very
orderly, ſober fellow."</p>
            <p>"By compariſon only," ſaid Celeſtina,
half ſmiling at his way of making out the account.</p>
            <p>"Aye, by compariſon. Every thing in
this world is, you know, good or bad only
by compariſon. Come, come, Celeſtina, I
was willing enough to allow for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion
in favour of George Willoughby,
but to any other I cannot, I will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
nor will I allow any thing to this
damned prudery. I know myſelf worthy
of you, highly as I think of you. Yes, I
deſerve you, if it be only for my perſevering
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0206900204:35"/>
love; and by all that's good I will not be
denied."</p>
            <p>"You really will, Sir," replied Celeſtina;
who, more and more diſtreſſed by his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
deſired to put an end to it for ever
if poſſible—"you really will; for I proteſt
to you that I never can give any other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
than I have already given, and I beg,
I entreat that you will deſiſt from a purſuit
that can produce for you only mortification."</p>
            <p>"May perdition ſeize me if I do!" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
he with renewed vehemence. "No!
if I periſh in the attempt, I will perſevere!"
He was proceeding in this ſtrain, when Lady
Horatia ſent to let Celeſtina know ſhe waited
for her to go out; and ſhe took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of haſtening away, glad to be relieved
from a converſation ſo diſtreſſing; while
Vavaſour, finding all attempts to detain her
ineffectual, left the houſe in one of thoſe
paroxyſms of paſſion, which diſappointment,
from his having never been uſed to ſubmit
to it, always produced.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
            <p>IT would be difficult to ſay, whether
Willoughby, wandering and ſolitary among
the remote villages of Yorkſhire, or Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,
ſurrounded in London by what the
world calls pleaſure and amuſement, was the
moſt internally wretched. Celeſtina's
laſt dialogue with Vavaſour, had convinced
her that Willoughby no longer thought of
her even with that degree of friendſhip and
tenderneſs which he had ſo often aſſured
her nothing ſhould deſtroy: he was gone
out of town merely to prepare for his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
and gone without deigning either
to ſee her or anſwer the letter ſhe had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to him. There was, in ſuch conduct,
ſo much unkindneſs and inhumanity, that
ſhe began to hope her reflections on it would
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0206900204:37"/>
by degrees abate the anguiſh ſhe now felt:
and ſhe liſtened to Lady Horatia, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
ſpoke of it as an unequivocal proof
of Willoughby's want of an heart capable
of a generous and ſteady attachment. To
Montague Thorold, however, (who now
again returned to town after an abſence on
buſineſs of ſome little time), ſhe could not
liſten with ſo much complacency as her
friend wiſhed; and ſhe repeatedly told him,
that the greateſt obligation he could confer
upon her would be to deſiſt from talking to
her of love. The certainty, however, there now
ſeemed to be that Willoughby no
longer conſidered himſelf as intereſted about
her; her poſitive rejection of Mr. Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour,
and the encouragement given him by
Lady Horatia to perſevere, brought him
continually to the houſe; where their morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
parties of reading re-commenced; and
whenever they went out of an evening,
Montague Thorold was their attendant:
thus drinking intoxicating draughts of love,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0206900204:38"/>
and indulging hope that it would finally be
ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>Willoughby now found without difficulty
the perſon he ſought: and whether it was
that ſhe had her leſſon more completely, or
was permitted to ſpeak plainer of what ſhe
knew, ſhe anſwered all his enquiries in ſuch
a way as ſerved to perplex but not entirely
to affirm the queſtion, whether Celeſtina
was his mother's daughter. The woman
was, in her mind and ideas, one of the
loweſt of the vulgar: yet her ſimplicity
ſeemed to be affected; and all the proofs
which had been talked of did not amount
to her declaring that ſhe was preſent at the
birth of Celeſtina or could produce any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
evidence of it. She ſpoke principally
to the time when ſhe ſaid the little girl was
at nurſe at Kenſington; of, which ſhe related
a great many particulars that ſtaggered
Willoughby more than ever, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
him: yet all the woman ſaid, though
it was conſiſtent, had the air of having been
learned by rote; and there was about her a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0206900204:39"/>
ſort of guarded cunning which ſeemed to
have been acquired, or at leaſt improved
by long practice. Willoughby attempted
to diſcover whether ſhe had not received
money from Lady Caſtlenorth, and to find
what were her preſent means of ſubſiſtence:
but for theſe enquiries alſo ſhe ſeemed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared;
and gave at leaſt a plauſible account
of a legacy left her by a great uncle, that
enabled her to live without ſervitude in her
native country, where ſhe boarded with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and affected great piety and ſanctity.
She bleſſed God, ſhe ſaid, that ſhe ſcorned
for the lucre of gain to belye any one, dead
or alive, much more her good miſtreſs
who was gone: but truth was truth and ſhe
hoped, by the help of God, always to ſpeak
it plain and direct, without fee or reward:
"and as for Lady Caſtlenorth," added ſhe,
"whom your honour thinks has paid me
for ſpeaking of this thing, pray conſider,
your honour, wherein it could be uſeful to
my lady to put me upon ſaying a falſity.
If I was baſe enough to take money of my
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0206900204:40"/>
Lady for it, which to be certain I never
did, for what would that be, as your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
well knows, but ſelling my immortal
ſoul? and what good, as I may ſay, would
all the gold and diamonds in the world do
me, if my precious ſoul was to periſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of them."</p>
            <p>This cant, to which Willoughby liſtened
with continued patience, made him hope
that he ſhould, in ſome inſtance or other,
detect her of inconſiſtency. But though he
ſaw her repeatedly, and ſet Farnham to
watch her ſtill more narrowly and to talk
the matter over with her as if in confidence,
ſhe was always ſo guarded that no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
could be diſcovered; and after wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near a week at the village, Willoughby
was compelled to give up every idea of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
coming at the truth, and to return
towards London without being poſitively
ſure that Celeſtina was ſo nearly related to
him; yet forced to allow that he could not,
in contradiction to all he had heard of a
child nurſed in ſecret at Kenſington, bring
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0206900204:41"/>
any ſort of evidence on which he ought to
rely that ſhe was not ſo.</p>
            <p>Sick at heart, and feeling too ſenſibly
that all his future life muſt be unhappy, his
mind ſunk in total deſpondence. Too cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it was, that under ſuch circumſtances
he could not think of marrying Celeſtina:
yet he was unhappily conſcious that he
could not bear to think of her marrying
another. It was in vain he accuſed himſelf
of ſomething worſe than folly. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
his mind dwelt on that ſubject, he
found that folly irreſiſtible: and while he
determined that one of the firſt things he
would do on his return ſhould be to make a
proviſion for Celeſtina out of his remaining
fortune, he ſickened in recollecting that
ſuch a proviſion would probably but facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
her marriage with Montague Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold—and
of Montague Thorold he could
not think with patience.</p>
            <p>Of his own ſituation in regard to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of Fitz-Hayman, he thought with
equal bitterneſs. He was but too conſcious,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0206900204:42"/>
that to obtain the information he wanted
from Hannah Biſcoe, which he had flattered
himſelf would turn out very differently, he
had renewed his attendance at the houſe of
his uncle, and acted diſingenuouſly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
himſelf. However indifferent or averſe
he was to his couſin, his honour forbade
him any longer to trifle with thoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which ſhe evidently entertained in
his favour. What then ſhould he do?
This queſtion came continually before him;
and was continually debated without his
being able to form any reſolution on which
he could for a moment reſt without pain.</p>
            <p>He ſometimes thought, that ſince in
loſing the only woman whom he could
love, he had loſt all that could render his
life happy, it was immaterial what became
of him; and that ſince he muſt be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
it might as well be in following as in
flying from what he ſtill thought was in
ſome degree a duty—completing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
he had made to his mother on
her death bed. In doing this, he ſhould
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0206900204:43"/>
gratify all his ſurviving relations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve
his eſtate, which he muſt otherwiſe
ſell, as the mortgages upon it were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly
devouring it: and to do this was, as
he ſometimes tried to perſuade himſelf, to
pay a debt he owed his anceſtors. He had
been educated by his mother in high ideas
of the conſequence and reſpectability, not
only of her family but of that of his father;
but of theſe prejudices his natural good ſenſe
had ſuffered very little to remain; ſo that
if he now endeavoured to recall them in
ſupport of thoſe arguments which he ran
over in favour of his marriage, his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
immediately revolted againſt them.</p>
            <p>"I ſhall not-only retrieve," ſaid he,
"but augment my fortune: not only ſave
Alveſtone, but add to my preſent eſtates
the family poſſeſſions of my mother, which
will otherwiſe become the property of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
the honours too ſo long inherited by
her anceſtors will be mine."</p>
            <p>He frequently made efforts to fix his
mind on theſe advantages; but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0206900204:44"/>
he began ſeriouſly to inveſtigate their
value, he beheld them with contempt.</p>
            <p>"Ridiculous!" cried he. "My anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors!
What is this fooliſh family pride, for
which I am meditating to ſell my freedom,
in acquieſcence with narrow prejudice? I
ſhall have a large eſtate: but will it make
me happier in myſelf, or more reſpected by
thoſe whoſe reſpect can afford me any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?
I ſhall be called "my Lord"—a
mighty ſatisfaction truly! The vulgar—for
with ſuch empty ſounds the vulgar only
are delighted—will bow low to my Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and I ſhall take place at county
meetings above the neighbouring Eſquires
who are now my equals. I ſhall have
a bauble called a coronet painted on my
coach doors and my hall chairs, and
ſhall become one of the legiſlature,
qualified for it only by the poſſeſſion of
that bauble. Perhaps half a dozen or half
a hundred men and women of poor ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
may court the notice and boaſt of the
acquaintance of Lord Caſtlenorth, who
would have let Mr. Willoughby remain
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0206900204:45"/>
unmoleſted by their kindneſs, and by ſuch
friends my houſe will be infeſted and my
leiſure deſtroyed. But I ſhall go to Court,
and be named as having appeared at the
drawing room; that will be very delectable
certainly: and my wife's fine cloaths will
be deſcribed at full length, and the taſte of
my equipage be commended in all the
newſpapers. It will be there told of me,
that I am gone to this or that of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
houſes; and my ſix bays, or greys, or
blacks, will be celebrated in Hyde Park, or
be conſpicuous in the roads within twenty
miles of London; while a thouſand inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
inſipid beings, whom I neither
know nor deſire to know, ſhall ſay "what
a beautiful carriage, what a well appointed
equipage is that of my Lord Caſtlenorth."
All this felicity in the aggregate, and I
know of no more that belongs to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of a title, is certainly well worth the
ſacrifice I ſhall make to obtain it; and my
anceſtors, "from their airy clouds," will be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0206900204:46"/>
infinitely delighted by the glory of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant.</p>
            <p>But what will that deſcendant be in
reality? a mercenary, a miſerable wretch:
condemned to paſs his life with a woman,
whom, if he does not loath, he does not
love; to feel himſelf a purchaſed huſband;
and to have ſold, in ſad exchange, man's
beſt birth right, freedom, for a meſs of
pottage.</p>
            <p>To ſuch ſoliloquies as theſe, ſucceeded
determinations to carry no farther any ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of attention to Miſs Fitz-Hayman;
but to go even from his preſent journey and
without paſſing through London, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
abroad.</p>
            <p>To a mind unable to reſiſt miſery, there
frequently appears a poſſibility of flying
from it; and while Willoughby dreaded
the thoughts of returning to London, he
fancied that if he could croſs over from Hull
to the north of Europe, he ſhould leave
ſome part of his preſent unhappineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him. Unſettled and unhappy as he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0206900204:47"/>
was, theſe debates with himſelf, theſe vague
plans of quitting every thing and becoming
a wanderer on earth, became more uſual with him:
but ſtill he decided on nothing.
The idea of being compelled to ſell Alveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone
was the only one, however, that had
great weight with him. To think that the
place to which he had been ſo fondly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
ſhould become the property of ſome
upſtart man of ſudden fortune, was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by a ſenſation of acute uneaſineſs.
He imagined, thoſe beautiful woods, the
growth of centuries, fallen in compliance
with the improving taſte of a broker or a
warehouſeman; the park ploughed up to
be converted into farms; and the elegant
ſimplicity of his houſe and his grounds, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
by gothic windows or Chineſe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
the ſhrubberies where he had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with Celeſtina, that turf, where he
had ran by her ſide when ſhe was learning
to ride, and where they uſed to walk arm
in arm together; that houſe, where he had
hoped ſhe would preſide, and grace ſo
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0206900204:48"/>
lovely a ſcene with a miſtreſs yet more
lovely; all, all were to become the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of another! and the very name of
Willoughby, and what was yet more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
the name of Celeſtina, ſhould never
more, in thoſe ſcenes, be remembered.
Yet in a moment the cruel truth occurred to
him, that whether this place belonged to
him or to another, Celeſtina would never
again viſit it; that he ſhould never again
hear her voice calling him among the beech
woods, or trace her footſteps on the turf;
never liſten to her as ſhe read in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
dreſſing room, or hold her hand
within his as they ſat together on the woody
banks of the water-fall, and marked it's
ſparkling current leap from rock to rock.
And without her, what would Alveſtone be
but a place where every ſpot would be
haunted by melancholy images of departed
happineſs. How little the indulgence of
theſe painful contemplations would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted,
or put an end to, by any ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he could derive from the converſation
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0206900204:49"/>
of Miſs Fitz-Hayman, his ſick and reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
heart too plainly told him: and then he
again believed himſelf determined to ſell all
his eſtatesand quit England; if not for ever,
at leaſt till time, abſence, and the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of his changing it, had better recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
him to that deſtiny which condemned
him to give up Celeſtina, and to ſee her in
the arms of another.</p>
            <p>A deſultory and unſettled life, had within
the laſt year become habitual to him; and
while he was actually moving from one
place to another, his ſpirits preyed leſs
corroſively on themſelves. Since to live as
he wiſhed to have lived in his own country
was impoſſible, he thought he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
it leſs while he was wandering over
others: and ſince he could not now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
the face and character he ſo fondly
loved, he hoped that variety of characters
and variety of faces would divert his regret
if they could not cure his attachment.
There was too an idea of freedom and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence,
which accompanied his thus
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0206900204:50"/>
ſhaking off at once every incumbrance,
that was not without it's charms; and in
this diſpoſition he thought contemptuouſly
of mere local preference as unworthy a
ſtrong mind, and determined to become a
citizen of the world; and when in his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
he had ſettled his rout, through
Holland and France to Sicily, which he
had long wiſhed to ſee, and from thence
to the Archipelago, he breathed freer, and
felt himſelf more reconciled to exiſtence.</p>
            <p>He journeyed, however, ſlowly towards
London while theſe debates were carrying
on: and at York, whither he had ordered
his letters to be directed, he found one
from Cathcart which related ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
in regard to his affairs that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
him he could not, unleſs to the
material injury of ſome perſons who were
connected with him, quit England without
ſome regulation of thoſe pecuniary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
which he had ſo long neglected and
would now willingly have eſcaped from.
This letter determined him to return to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0206900204:51"/>
London; though another letter from his
ſiſter, in which ſhe mentioned, as an article
of news, that Celeſtina was either actually
married to Montague Thorold or on the
point of being ſo, threw him into a ſtate
of mind bordering on diſtraction: reaſon,
which had long fruitleſsly contended
againſt this fatal, and perhaps guilty attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
now ſeemed tired of a contention ſo
hopeleſs, and his mind became a chaos of
conflicting paſſions, all equally deſtructive
to his mental and bodily health.</p>
            <p>To return to London, however, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
neceſſary; and Farnham, his old
faithful ſervant, perſuaded him to take
poſt chaiſes for the reſt of his journey. He
arrived, after an abſence of above three
weeks, at the houſe of Lady Molyneux;
and there heard, that a few days before,
Lady Horatia Howard had publicly ſpoken
of Celeſtina's marriage with the young di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
as a ſettled thing; that his father had
bought for him a conſiderable living in
Glouceſterſhire, where they were to reſide,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0206900204:52"/>
and where a curate was ſettled till he was
himſelf qualified to take it; and thither,
as there was a very good houſe upon it,
they were going immediately after their
marriage. Willoughby heard all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being able to make any reply, and then
haſtened to his own lodgings, from whence
he diſpatched Farnham for intelligence
from the ſervants of Lady Horatia. The
coachman, with whom he had ſome time
before made an acquaintance and who was
a very talkative fellow, immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
him of all he knew, and much that
he imagined. He ſaid it was very true,
that Mr. Thorold lived almoſt always at
their houſe, "and my Lady," ſaid the
man—"my Lady loves him for all the
world as if he was her own ſon. There they
are all morning reading play books and,
ſuch together, as my fellow ſervants tell
me, that is, my Lady and Miſs and this
here young divine as is to be; and then
they goes out in my coach, all's one as if
they belonged to the ſame family; and I
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0206900204:53"/>
do underſtand as how my Lady is to give
her a portion and they be to be married
out of hand, that is in a little time, and I
believe that's the very truth of the thing,
for my Lady have bought another coach
horſe within theſe ten days, and told me—"Abraham,"
ſays ſhe, "I ſhall go early next
month into Glouceſterſhire, inſtead of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Matlock as I talked of, and I ſhall
go in the coach inſtead of the poſt chaiſe,
becauſe I have ſome friends with me."</p>
            <p>This account, which Farnham faithfully
repeated to Willoughby, confirmed almoſt
beyond a doubt all Lady Molyneux had
related to him. Some more recent intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
that he had received from Cathcart as
to the embroiled ſtate of his affairs in the
country, combined to render him deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:
and he had been ſo long harraſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his love and his intereſt, his honour
and his reluctance, that he ſuddenly took
the reſolution of putting it out of his own
power to undergo again ſuch variety of
torments: like a wretch who leaps from a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0206900204:54"/>
ſhip on fire into the ſea, though certain of
meeting death in another ſhape, he formed
the determination of making himſelf, ſince
he muſt be wretched, as completely
wretched as poſſible. He thought of Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
as his relation in vain; it abated no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that anguiſh with which he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
her as the wife of Montague Thorold;
and ſo hideous were the images that forced
themſelves upon him, that he found his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
had no power to ſubdue them, and
thought that nothing could ſo decidedly
oblige him to check them as his marriage;
and without giving himſelf time to conſider
how deſperate was the remedy, he went
immediately to the houſe of Lord Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north,
declared to him that he was ſatisfied
as to the object of his journey, and took
the moſt immediate opportunity after his
return of expreſſing his ſolicitude to avail
himſelf of his couſin's generous predilection
in his favour, and to fulfil the wiſhes of his
deceaſed mother and his ſurviving family.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0206900204:55"/>
The eager and tremulous manner in which
lie uttered all this, and which was in reality
the effect of deſpair and anguiſh, Lord
Caſtlenorth miſtook for the anxiety and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
of love. His nephew had never
ſpoke thus deciſively before; and ſeeing
thus what he had ſo long fondly wiſhed for
out of doubt, his firſt idea was, to proceed
inſtantly in ſecuring to Willoughby the
reverſion of thoſe titles on which he ſet ſo
high a value himſelf. While, therefore, he
ſat out in his chariot, ſupported by Mrs.
Calder, who always attended him, to ſolicit
the completion of a buſineſs which had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proceeded but ſlowly, and fancied the
happineſs of all parties would be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
advanced by his ſucceſs, Willoughby,
with ſuch ſenſations as a determined ſuicide
alone could envy, was making to Lady
Caſtlenorth the ſame declaration; and was
immediately afterwards allowed, or rather
deſired, to preſent himſelf at the feet of her
fair daughter.</p>

            <p>TO play the lover is not difficult to moſt
men, even where their hearts are not really
intereſted. A few fine ſpeeches, a little
common place declamation, are eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
and generally accepted: but Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
always a very poor diſſembler,
and who felt, in deſpite of every effort to
repreſs them, ſentiments towards Miſs Fitz-Hayman
bordering on antipathy, was very
conſcious that he ſhould ill anſwer her ideas
of a paſſionate lover, and this conſciouſneſs
deprived him of the little power he might
otherwiſe have had to diſſemble.</p>
            <p>He now, with encreaſed confuſion of
thought, repented that he had gone ſo far;
but to recede was impoſſible; and with a
countenance expreſſive rather of perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0206900204:57"/>
and wretchedneſs than of the pleaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſenſations inſpired by ſucceſsful love,
he entered the apartment where Miſs Fitz-Hayman
had been prepared by Lady Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north
to receive his tender profeſſions.</p>
            <p>He approached her, and took her hand;
muttered ſomething about the final ecclair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſement
of his doubts as to another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
(for he dared not truſt his voice with
the name of Celeſtina), and ſomething
about being, in conſequence of that ecclair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſement,
releaſed from his former engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
then in a ſtill more tremulous and
uncertain tone, he ſolicited her permiſſion
to dedicate his life to her ſervice, and to
haſten thoſe preparations for his happineſs,
which his former uncertainties and embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſments
had put it out of his power to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit
with that ardour which he ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
other circumſtances have evinced.</p>
            <p>The falſehood he was uttering died away
almoſt inarticulately on his lips, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting
heart reproached him for it, faint and
reluctantas it was. As he finiſhed his ſpeech,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0206900204:58"/>
Miſs Fitz-Hayman turned her large black
eyes, which had till then been modeſtly
caſt down, full upon him. She ſeemed to
have been trying to make them ſpeak ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs;
but to him they expreſſed nothing
but an imperious enquiry into the truth of
his profeſſions, from which he ſhrunk. In
a moment, however, thoſe eyes, ſo little
calculated for the ſoft parley of affection,
contrived to overflow with tears. She gave
him the hand he had juſt before let go, and
inclining her head tenderly towards him,
ſaid, in terms as gentle as ſhe could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand—"Oh!
Willoughby! you know
too well, you have long known my unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
partiality towards you—a partiality,
which, with reluctance and with regret I
own, not all your too evident coldneſs has
conquered. Alas! could I now believe
you ſincere!—"</p>
            <p>"Believe it I conjure you," cried he in
a hurried voice, and haſtening to put an
end to a dialogue which he found he could
ſo ill ſupport—"Believe it, dear Madam!
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0206900204:59"/>
and believe, (what is true alſo)—that I
have now no other engagement—no other
attachment—and cannot but be—be truly
ſenſible of your extraordinary merit."</p>
            <p>"I will believe it," anſwered ſhe: "I
will endeavour to believe it, for I find, that
even if I am deceived, the deceit is dear to
me."</p>
            <p>Willoughby then kiſſed her hand with
as much warmth as he could affect; and
running over, in the breathleſs tremor which
conſciouſneſs of his diſingenuous conduct
occaſioned, a few common place ſentences
about eternal gratitude and unalterable
love; ſpeeches which have probably been
repeated ten million of times with as little
ſincerity but ſeldom with ſo much ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
he led her to talk of preparations,
and equipages, and jewels; ſubjects on which
ſhe entered with ſuch eaſe as ſhewed that
her mind had been familiarized to conſider
them, and that they were not without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
in her opinion. Poor Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
who now felt his fate irretrievable, had
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0206900204:60"/>
very different ſenſations. Oppreſſed and
bewildered by a variety of ſufferings, yet
compelled, by the part he had thus raſhly
determined to act, to ſtifle them all, his
prevailing idea was, that ſince the Rubicon
was now paſſed, the ſooner this dreaded
marriage was over the better for him; ſince
his mind muſt then combat, with more force
than it could now do, thoſe wild eccentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
the offspring of deſpair, which were
crouding faſt upon him. He therefore
preſſed for an early day; not with the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
of love, but with that of a wretch
who knowing he muſt die, wiſhes to hear
his phyſician fix the period when his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are likely to end. Miſs Fitz-Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
however, either could not or would
not diſcover this; and though his inflamed
eyes, his ſhort ſighs, unſettled manner, and
broken ſentences, gave him altogether the
appearance rather of a man ſuffering under
ſome recent calamity than of a favoured and
fortunate lover on the point of obtaining his
happineſs, the lady, either from her confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0206900204:61"/>
in her own charms, or from ſome
other cauſe, was perfectly ſatisfied with his
behaviour; and before he left her, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
that ſhe would not oppoſe the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement
which ſhe underſtood to have
been made by her father—that in three
weeks he ſhould receive her hand.</p>
            <p>This then was determined without poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of recall; and Willoughby, too ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
already of the weight of thoſe chains
which he had thus haſtily forged for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
now diſengaged himſelf as ſoon as
poſſible, and ran out of the houſe, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
to be alone, and to contemplate in
the ſtillneſs of his own room the proſpect of
miſery into which he had thus raſhly bound
himſelf to ruſh. He walked very faſt, and
as if he was flying from himſelf, towards
his lodgings in Bond-ſtreet, where, as he
paſſed along it, a croud of paſſengers near
one of the croſſings impeded his paſſage.
He regarded them not; but made his way
eagerly among them, till he was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
between a footman who waited at
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0206900204:62"/>
the door of a coach, and a young lady who
was coming out of a ſhop to ſtep into it.
On his preſſing rather haſtily before her,
the ſervant put him back with his hand.
Willoughby, out of humour at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with himſelf and with all the world,
and fancying the action of the footman
impertinent, ſpoke to him very harſhly and
was almoſt provoked to ſtrike him, when
the lady, who had her foot on the ſtep, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
a good deal alarmed, and no ſooner
heard the ſound of his voice thus menacing,
than ſhe caught the ſervant's arm for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
and at the ſame moment Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
who had not till then ſeen her face, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the lovely but pale and terrified coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of Celeſtina!</p>
            <p>Thrown entirely off his guard, and not
knowing what he did, he took the hand
with which ſhe had ſupported herſelf againſt
the ſervant. "Celeſtina!" cried he—"Oh
God! is it you, Celeſtina?"</p>
            <p>She looked at him with eyes where ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
was ſoftened by tenderneſs, and tried
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0206900204:63"/>
to recover voice enough to utter more
than—"Willoughby!" which the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
emotion drew from her: but he gave
her not time; for fixing his eyes on her's,
all that ſhe had been to him, all that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
ſhe was now to another, and all
that he had juſt agreed to be himſelf,
ruſhed upon his recollection at once,
and in an agony of grief, remorſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
he threw her hand from him, and
turning away, he walked, or rather ran
towards his lodgings as if he had been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
by the furies, where, without giving
his ſervant time to open it, he rapped at
the door with violence enough to break it
down; ſo fearful he ſeemed of again ſeeing
Celeſtina as ſhe paſſed in the coach, which,
by the horſes being in that direction, would,
he thought, come that way.</p>
            <p>Farnham, his ſervant, who opened the
door, was amazed at his impatience ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
his uſual manner, and with ſtill more
ſurpriſe ſaw him, inſtead of ſpeaking and
enquiring for letters, as he always did when
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0206900204:64"/>
he came in, and was particularly likely now
to do after ſo long an abſence, ruſh by him
as if he had not ſeen him; and hurrying up
ſtairs by two ſteps at a time, ſhut the door
of the dining room with a violence that
ſhook the whole houſe, and turn the key.</p>
            <p>This faithful ſervant had lived with him
from the time of his leaving ſchool, and
was more attached to his maſter than to any
other perſon on earth. He had ſeen with
deep concern the ſad change that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in his health and in his temper, ſince
that unfortunate night when he ſo ſuddenly
left Alveſtone the year before, and had, in
all his journies and all his illneſs, watched
over him with aſſiduous and attentive care.
He had often known him dejected, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſinking under his uncertainties and his
diſappointments, but had never till now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
ſuch fury in his eyes and marks of
deſperation in his manner; and alarmed at
the circumſtance of his having locked the
door of his room, Farnham was immediately
beſet with numberleſs fearful conjectures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0206900204:65"/>
He was aware that his maſter's affairs were
far from being proſperous, and imagined it
poſſible that he might be purſued for debt:
and as he knew his pride would render ſuch
a thing almoſt inſupportable, he feared leaſt
in the ſudden agony to which it might ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
him, he might commit ſome violence
on himſelf. Willoughby's temper was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
very mild, and not eaſily inflamed
to anger; but when that did happen, his
anger was dreadful; and though Farnham
had only once or twice ſeen it excited dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his long ſervice, he knew how terrible
it was when thoroughly rouſed.</p>
            <p>The conjectures that Farnham enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
were not to be ſupported calmly;
and though he had always received ſtrict
orders never to enter the room where his
maſter was buſy, till he rang or called for
him, he was now ſtrongly tempted, yet
dared not determine to diſobey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
He could not, however, forbear
going to the door and liſtening. He heard
his maſter utter deep and convulſive ſighs:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0206900204:66"/>
he heard him walking by ſtarts in the room;
but, by the key's being left in the lock, he
could ſee nothing. He then went ſoftly
into the bed chamber; and from thence a
defect in the door, which opened from it
into the dining room, enabled him to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
that Willoughby now ſat by a table
on which his arms were thrown, and on
them he reſted his head; while his hair, all
in diſorder, concealed every part of his
face: then in a moment ſtarting up, he
traverſed the room with quick and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſteps, now claſping his hands together,
now throwing them wildly abroad. At
length he ſtopped, and ſtriking his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
ſaid, in a voice rather reſembling
groaning than ſpeaking—"Oh accurſed,
accurſed wretch!—what haſt thou done!"</p>
            <p>Still more alarmed by theſe words, and
by beholding the frantic geſtures with which
his maſter now leaned againſt the ſide of
the chimney, now flew to the other ſide of
the room, and now threw himſelf on a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,
Farnham again debated with himſelf
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0206900204:67"/>
whether he ſhould not go in at any event.
There was a <hi>couteau de chaſſe</hi> and a ſword
hung up in the room, and two brace of
piſtols in their caſes, which Farnham had
juſt put there, loaded as they were when his
maſter travelled; and the poor fellow fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
that on theſe, whenever he paſſed
them, his maſter looked wildly eager.
This might be ſome time fancy: but at
length, either from accident or from his
feeling at that inſtant ſome horrible tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to eſcape from the evils that juſt then
appeared quite intolerable, Willoughby
ſtopped with folded arms oppoſite to theſe
inſtruments of deſtruction, and while his
expreſſive countenance was marked with
the ſevereſt anguiſh, he murmured inarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culately
ſome words which Farnham inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
as a determination to put an end to
his ſufferings. Bent at any hazard to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his executing this fearful threat, the
affrighted ſervant now ſearched with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
hands for the lock, which he forgot
he could not open. His maſter demanded,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0206900204:68"/>
in a voice which ſtruck him with terror,
who was there? when luckily for him a
thundering rap at the ſtreet door gave him
hopes that ſome viſitors might be coming
who might more properly and effectually
interfere, and he flew down to let them in,
regardleſs of Willoughby, who, coming
out to the top of the ſtairs, called to him,
and peremptorily ordered him to admit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body.</p>
            <p>It was Sir Philip Molyneux; who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
juſt met Lord Caſtlenorth at the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
levee, had heard from him that Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
immediately on his arrival in
town, had agreed to the concluſion of his
marriage; and that in conſequence of it he
had himſelf been attending the levee to haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the affair of the reverſionary titles, which,
affair was likely to be ſpeedily concluded.
Sir Philip, therefore, having received this
intelligence, called as he went home to
congratulate his brother in law, and to take
him to dinner in Portman-ſquare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0206900204:69"/>
Little accuſtomed as Sir Philip was to
make remarks on any body's appearance,
and particularly on that of his inferiors, he
was not withſtanding ſtruck with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of Farnham, as, pale and aghaſt,
he opened the door to him; and as he went
before him up ſtairs, he enquired what ailed
him. "I hardly know indeed Sir," replied
Farnham: "but my maſter, who came
from Barnet only early this morning as you
know I ſuppoſe Sir, off his Yorkſhire jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
has been out ſomewhere ſince, and is
come home in ſuch a humour as I am ſure
I have never ſeen him in in all the years I
have lived with him: be ſo good, Sir,
however, as not to take notice that I ſpoke
about it."</p>
            <p>Sir Philip had no time to promiſe he
would not, before they were at the door of
the dining room, where Willoughby ſtood
and ſternly ſaid to his ſervant—"How dare
you, Sir, diſobey me in this manner? did
I not tell you, ſtupid hound, that I would
not be at home?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0206900204:70"/>
"Lord, Sir," cried Farmham in great
diſtreſs, for he was little accuſtomed and
could hardly bear to be thus harſhly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved—"Lord,
Sir—it is only Sir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip—and
I am ſure I thought—"</p>
            <p>"Curſe on your thoughts!" cried Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby.
"Blockhead—are you to think
for me?"</p>
            <p>"Hey day!" ſaid Sir Philip, "what's
all this? Don't be angry with poor Farn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.
I would come in, for I was impatient
to wiſh you joy."</p>
            <p>"Joy, Sir?—of what?"</p>
            <p>"Why I have this moment ſeen Lord
Caſtlenorth, who has told me that every thing
is ſettled at laſt. Come, I'm very glad to
hear it, for it muſt be owned that this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
George, has advanced but ſlowly.
Well! ſo now 'tis to be done directly?
The old peer was quite friſky upon it, and
forgot his aſthma and his gout to ſtand till
I was tired of hearing him, telling me of
the regulation he had made as to your
name: he becomes Earl and Viſcount Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenorth;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0206900204:71"/>
and you take, as your title, that
of Baron Ravenſburgh. I heard the hiſtory
too of how that came into the family.
Well, but George, you'll go dine with us.
Lady Molyneux will be glad, perhaps, to
hear about it, and to wiſh you joy."</p>
            <p>"Joy—damnation rather!" muttered
Willoughby, as, ſnatching away his hand,
he fled to the other end of the room: then
by an effort recovering himſelf a little, he
returned towards Sir Philip, and ſaid, with
forced calmneſs—"Prythee don't teize me
with theſe hateful common place congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
Surely it is bad enough for a fellow
to be forced to hear them afterwards, and
indeed bad enough to be married, without
having them rung in his ears for a month
before hand."</p>
            <p>Sir Philip, who now ſaw very plainly that
his reluctance was by no means ſubdued,
had no inclination to argue the matter with
him. He had no idea why he might not be
happy with Miſs Fitz-Hayman or any other
woman of equal fortune: but whether he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0206900204:72"/>
was ſo or no, his own ſolicitude went no
further than that his brother in law might
not be reduced either to a ſtate of indigence
ſuch as might diſgrace his alliance or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
him to borrow money of his relations;
and as Willoughby's marriage with Miſs
Fitz-Hayman would preclude the poſſibility
of any ſuch awkward circumſtances, he
heartily wiſhed it, and had of late forgot
his uſual apathy to join with his wife in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
it.</p>
            <p>There was, he thought, no occaſion for
argument in the preſent caſe, ſince the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
was now, whether Willoughby liked it
or no, irrevocably fixed upon. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſpared himſelf the fatigue of remarks or
remonſtrance on Willoughby's behaviour,
and only ſaid—"But you'll dine with us,
George, to-day—will you not?"</p>
            <p>"No, I cannot," replied Willoughby.</p>
            <p>"To-morrow then. We ſhall have a
large party, and dine exactly at ſeven o'clock.</p>
            <p>"I will if I can. But I can engage for
nothing. I hate to be fettered by engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0206900204:73"/>
but if I can come I will. Shall I
ring for your ſervants?"</p>
            <p>"They are at the door," ſaid Sir Philip,
who immediately went away, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any great reaſon to be ſatisfied with the
politeneſs of his brother in law. Of that,
however, he thought not; and if the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of Willoughby afterwards occurred to
him at all, it only created a momentary
ſurpriſe, mingled with ſome degree of pity,
which his abſurdity, and not his evident
unhappineſs, excited.</p>
            <p>His viſit, however, had the effect of
rouſing Willoughby from that dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of mind into which the ſtep he had
taken that morning in regard to Miſs Fitz-Hayman,
and the ſudden ſight of Celeſtina,
had thrown him. He now became able to
collect his thoughts; and was at once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of the general folly of his conduct,
and of his cruel behaviour to Farnham,
who was ſo hurt by having ſeen his maſter
in ſuch a ſtate, and by the unkind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
way in which he had ſpoke to him,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0206900204:74"/>
that when the poor fellow came up to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
if he would pleaſe to dreſs, the tears
were in his eyes, and he was hardly able to
ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Willoughby was of too noble a nature
not to apologiſe for his fault the moment
he felt it. He anſwered mildly that he
ſhould dreſs directly, and then ſaid—"Farnham,
I ſpoke angrily to you juſt
now, and I am ſorry for it. I was vexed,
and could not command my temper. You
were wrong too in letting in Sir Philip
Molyneux. Another time remember, that
when I give orders to be denied I except
nobody unleſs I particularly name them."</p>
            <p>Poor Farnham dared not ſay why he
then ventured to diſobey him; but in the
moſt humble terms begged his pardon and
ſaid he was very ſorry. "Well, well," cried
Willoughby, with a deep ſigh, "and I
am very ſorry, Farnham, that I was ſo
fooliſhly paſſionate. Let us think no more
of it." He then bade him get his things to
dreſs, and tried, by taking up a book, to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0206900204:75"/>
divert his thoughts from himſelf, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
at leaſt a reſpite from the corroſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
that purſued him; but it would not
do: he threw the book away, and felt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all his efforts, his wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and impatience returning: while Farn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
who as he dreſſed his hair watched
every turn of his countenance, ſaw but too
plainly that his maſter was half diſtracted
by ſomething into which he dared not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
This gave a ſort of unquiet flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to his manner, which Willoughby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
was on the point of relapſing into
that ſort of behaviour for which he had but
the moment before expreſſed his ſorrow,
and impetuouſly bade him mind what he
was about and make haſte: then hardly
ſuffering him to finiſh his hair, he ſtarted
up, and putting on his cloaths in the haſte
that denoted the unquietneſs of his mind,
he ſent for a hackney coach, and ordered it
to ſet him down at the hotel in Soho-ſquare.
Farnham ſtill apprehending that ſome fatal
event might follow all the agitation of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0206900204:76"/>
mind which he had witneſſed, now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
again, and aſked if he ſhould be
at home in the evening, or ſup at home?
To which Willoughby, no longer able to
check himſelf, anſwered—"no!" as he
drew up the glaſs, in an accent that terrified
poor Farnham; who, more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in his notion that ſomething was
about to befall his maſter, now concluded
that ſomething was a duel. The piſtols
and the ſword indeed were ſtill hanging up
in the dining room: but yet he could not
be eaſy; and, after ſome conſideration, he
determined to go and enquire among the
ſervants at Sir Philip Molyneux's and at
Lord Caſtlenorth's if they could at all
gueſs what was the matter; and with moſt
of the latter he was particularly acquainted,
by having been much with them at Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and Naples when his maſter was laſt
abroad.</p>

            <p>IF Willoughby was ſo deeply affected
by the ſight of Celeſtina, the ſudden ſhock
ſhe had received from their abrupt meeting,
and from his ſtrange behaviour, had on her
an equally painful though a different ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
That the impulſe of the moment had
urged him to take her hand, made her hope
that ſome remains of affection for her yet
lingered in his boſom, and that his former
regard was rather ſtifled by anger than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated
by indifference. She knew that
the firſt might be removed, and that ſhe
might be reſtored to his friendſhip; but
that if his heart had once become quite cold
towards her, nothing could ever renew even
that ſhare of tenderneſs with which ſhe could
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0206900204:78"/>
learn, if not to be happy, at leaſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>It was ſome time before ſhe could reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
from the agitation of ſpirits into which
this unexpected interview had thrown her:
but when ſhe at length became calm
enough to reflect on it, ſhe determined to
ſay nothing of having ſeen Willoughby to
Lady Horatia, as ſhe knew it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to her only a freſh inſtance of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
treatment of her; on which, how
ſeverely ſoever ſhe felt it, ſhe did not love
to hear any comments even from her beſt
friends. With all the reſolution ſhe could
collect, therefore, ſtifling her internal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
ſhe prepared to go with a large
party in the evening to Ranelagh.</p>
            <p>While ſhe was dreſſing for this purpoſe,
a ſervant brought up to her the following
letter:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>MADAM,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>That a ſtranger, and a ſtranger in my
ſituation of life, ſhould addreſs you,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0206900204:79"/>
would poſſibly appear, to any leſs gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
mind than your's, a liberty that
ſhould be repulſed with diſdain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by contempt: but I am perſuaded
that from you <hi>I</hi> may expect that liberal
candour with which true virtue and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
goodneſs conſiders even thoſe
whom the generality of the world agree
to condemn and deſpiſe.</p>
                  <p>You know, Madam, what I have
been and what I am. From Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone
you have probably learned
what were the circumſtances of my
early life; and Mr. Vavaſour, with that
ſincerity which deſerves to be ſo highly
valued, has told you how long I have
been under his protection.</p>
                  <p>He has ſince, Madam, expreſſed
ſomefears that this information may have
been prejudicial to his intereſt with you,
and leaſt it ſhould be ſo, allow me to
declare to you, that I know myſelf too
well to believe for a moment that I ought
to be in queſtion where you are beloved
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0206900204:80"/>
—too well to heſitate in declaring, that
attached as I am to Mr. Vavaſour, <hi>I</hi> can
never make him as happy as he deſerves
to be.</p>
                  <p>No, Madam; that happineſs depends
entirely on you. Such a paſſion as he
feels for you, I believe no other perſon
can deſerve; and I know him to have
ſo good a heart, I deſire his felicity ſo
ſincerely, that I hazard this ſtep in the
hope of promoting it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Vavaſour's generoſity has left me
nothing to fear for the reſt of my life,
were it even to be a long one: but I feel
that a very few months will bring it to
an end; and I feel it without concern;
for, thoughtleſs and unworthy as my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
has been, I have never found in
its moſt brilliant periods, that the glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
trappings beſtowed by mercenary
love, could quiet the throbbing heart
that beat beneath them: and now my
only wiſh is, to be forgiven and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by my family, and to paſs the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0206900204:81"/>
ſhort remainder of my days with them.
You can intercede with them ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
for they can refuſe you nothing.
Deign then, Madam, to intereſt your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for me, and at the ſame time be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
that it is my purpoſe to withdraw
myſelf for ever from Mr. Vavaſour,
whenever he will ſuffer me to go, which
ſhall, he ſays, be whenever you will give
him hopes of liſtening to him.</p>
                  <p>If generoſity, ſincerity, good nature,
and underſtanding, may be ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations
to your good opinion,
Mr. Vavaſour eminently deſerves it;
and whatever faults he may have, your
virtues will correct. He knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of my writing to you; but I am
conſcious that I owe <hi>him</hi> ſuch an effort
where the felicity of his future days is
concerned, and I feel that in addreſſing
<hi>you,</hi> my preſumption if not ſucceſsful
will be forgiven.</p>
                  <closer>I have the honour to be,
<salute>MADAM,</salute>
                     <signed>your moſt obedient ſervant,
EMILY CATHCART.</signed>

Celeſtina could not peruſe ſuch a letter
without a mixture of admiration and pity
for the amiable unhappy writer. Though
her reſolution in regard to Vavaſour could
not be changed, ſhe thought that ſhe ſhould
no longer delay acquainting Mrs. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
and Cathcart with the information ſhe
had obtained relative to their ſiſter; but it
required ſome conſideration, at leaſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to Cathcart. The circumſtance of
Emily's letter added to the flutter of ſpirits
which the meeting in the morning had
given her. Montague Thorold, who dined
with Lady Horatia, and was to be one of
their party at Ranelagh, contrived to be
more than uſually importunate with her
for more pity and favour than ſhe had lately
ſhewn him: while the ladies, and Mr.How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
who joined them in the evening, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted
her anguiſh and confuſion, by talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
of the marriage which was in a few days
to take place between Miſs Fitz-Hayman
and Mr. Willoughby. One of theſe was
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0206900204:83"/>
acquainted with Mrs. Calder, and had
heard from her that morning that every
thing was ſettled, the title arranged, the
equipages and liveries beſpoke, and the
jewels and cloaths concluded upon, all of
which ſhe detailed at great length; while
another ſaid, that <hi>ſhe</hi> underſtood that the
marriage was to take place at Caſtlenorth,
and that from thence all the family were to
proceed together to Italy, where they were
to paſs a twelvemonth. All, however,
agreed that it was certainly to be concluded
immediately, and Celeſtina could not any
longer entertain a doubt of it.</p>
            <p>Though her heart had always revolted
from the idea of Willoughby's union with
Miſs Fitz-Hayman, ſhe had been now ſo
long accuſtomed to think of it, that ſhe
felt leſs poignant concern on that account,
but if poſſible more than ever from his
continued coldneſs, and the cruel neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
he had been guilty of in not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her letter. "That he marries ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,"
cried ſhe, as ſhe reflected on it, "I
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0206900204:84"/>
might learn to ſubmit to without murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if it can contribute to his eaſe or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
in any way; but that he ſhould quite
deſert and forſake me after ſo many aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of eſteem and regard, even when
love was no longer in queſtion; that he
ſhould diſdain to own that connection by
blood, if he is ſure that it is ſo, which made
him, with ſo much apparent reluctance,
relinquiſh every other, that he ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pity leave me to a deſtiny which owes
its unhappineſs to him, ſeems ſo ſtrange,
ſo unnatural, ſo unlike him!—If I could
once ſee him, hear him talk to me with
friendly calmneſs, and tell me that he felt
for me fraternal affection, or even the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of long acquaintance, even what his
mother's ward might claim from him, I
think I ſhould be comparatively happy, and
ſhould have no farther wiſh than to hear
ſometimes from himſelf that he was happy
too. But to be thrown from him in this
unfeeling and unfriendly way, to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
and abandoned as if I had been
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0206900204:85"/>
found unworthy not only of his affection
but of his remembrance—oh! it is too
much."</p>
            <p>Theſe reflections, and the unintereſting
converſation of the company ſhe was with,
to which ſhe was compelled to attend in
order to eſcape the more irkſome importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Montague Thorold, ſerved but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to raiſe her ſpirits. They did not reach
Ranelagh till a late hour: but on their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
the firſt party they met was Lady
Caſtlenorth, her daughter, and Lady Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneux.
Captain Cavanaugh was on one
ſide between the two former; and in deep
conference with the latter was Captain Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold.</p>
            <p>The ladies, who could not avoid ſeeing
Celeſtina, paſſed her with averted and
haughty looks. Cavanaugh fixed his eyes
on her with a look of bold enquiry, and
Captain Thorold, as he paſſed his brother,
ſaid—"Ho! Montague, are you there? I
did not know you were in town my boy!"
He then gave a ſignificant nod, as much
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0206900204:86"/>
as to ſay—"Aye, aye, I ſee how you are
engaged," and paſſed on, renewing with
great ſeeming earneſtneſs his converſation
with Lady Molyneux.</p>
            <p>Though there was not in the world ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſet of people whom Celeſtina could be
ſo little pleaſed to meet, and though ſhe
heard throughout the room, and from every
group that paſſed them, the report of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby's
marriage, with various comments
and circumſtances, ſuch as every body
thought themſelves at liberty to adorn it
with, ſhe felt a ſort of ſatisfaction in ſeeing
that he was not with them; and while there
was not any thing ſhe really ſo ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
as his happineſs, yet ſo contradictory
is the human heart, that ſhe wiſhed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he married Miſs Fitz-Hayman reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly,
though a marriage under ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
muſt above all other things ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him miſerable.</p>
            <p>Montague Thorold, elated more than
ever by hope, and encouraged to perſevere
by Lady Horatia, having now too, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0206900204:87"/>
of the purchaſe his father had
made for him, more pretenſions to aſpire to
her than his unſettled fortune had before
given him; and ſanguinely interpreting her
gentle refuſals, her friendly admonitions to
deſiſt, as giving him all the encouragement
ſhe could do, while her fate in regard to
Willoughby was not abſolutely decided;
was on this evening particularly preſſing
and earneſt; while her languor and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the encouragement which ſhe was
conſcious ſhe ſeemed to have given him,
her pity and even her regard for him, with
the certainty of his ardent love for her, gave
her altogether the air of liſtening to him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably;
and while her mind was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
fixed on Willoughby, and ſhe
hardly recollected that Montague Thorold
was talking to her, ſhe ſeemed to be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the latter with complacency, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
of converſation which it was not
neceſſary for her to anſwer.</p>
            <p>At length the ſhort time Lady Horatia
meant to paſs at Ranelagh was over. She
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0206900204:88"/>
was fatigued, and Celeſtina rejoiced to
hear her ſay ſhe ſhould go home. As
Montague Thorold and Mr. Howard were
with them, the other gentlemen remained
with the ladies who intended to ſtay longer;
and Lady Horatia taking the arm of her
relation, left Celeſtina to the care of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague
Thorold; and they were in this order
proceeding towards the entrance, when
ſtanding near one of the niches, his hat
over his eyes, and his head leaning againſt
the wall, they ſaw themſelves cloſe to Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
who was, in that attitude, liſtening
to ſome very earneſt converſation from Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour,
who ſtood by him.</p>
            <p>The croud about the entrance was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable;
and Celeſtina, holding by the
arm of Montague Thorold, was ſo near
them, that they both at the ſame moment
ſaw her. Willoughby ſtarted as if he had
been croſſed by a ſpectre; and without
waiting to look a ſecond time, he puſhed
through the croud and diſappeared; but
Vavaſour came up to Celeſtina, and ſaid
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0206900204:89"/>
in his uſual way, taking abruptly the hand
that was at liberty—"You muſt give <hi>me</hi>
leave, Miſs De Mornay, to ſee you to your
carriage."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, dreading to give occaſion to
any thing like altercation between him and
Thorold, anſwered coldly but civilly, that
ſhe thanked him; but Thorold, who had
not forgotten or forgiven the mortification
ſhe received from him at York and on
other occaſions, could not now help reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what ſeemed to be a repetition of ſuch
inſulting behaviour. He therefore, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very haſtily on with Celeſtina, ſaid—"No,
Sir, there is no occaſion for you to
give yourſelf that trouble; for Miſs De
Mornay is under my care."</p>
            <p>"I did not mean, Sir," replied Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
fiercely, "to aſk your leave to wait on
this lady; and I beg you will not take the
liberty to addreſs yourſelf to me."</p>
            <p>"Pray, Mr. Vavaſour," ſaid Celeſtina,
trembling, "do not perſecute and terrify
me with this ſort of behaviour." She then
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0206900204:90"/>
ſaw by his countenance, and by the eager
way in which he graſped the hand he held,
that he was very far from being ſober, and
her terror encreaſed.</p>
            <p>"I did not mean to perſecute or terrify
you," cried he: "no, by heaven! But
damme if I can with any temper ſee that fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
always at your ear, and affecting to be
favoured. Come, come, leave the pedant
to his meditations, and don't forſake your
old friends. The petticoats that he is to
wear are his protection."</p>
            <p>"And this lady's preſence, Sir," ſaid
Thorold, "is your's, or be aſſured I ſhould
anſwer you in a very different way."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, now alarmed even to agony by
the menacing look of Vavaſour, who quitted
her hand and ſtepped before Thorold,
ſcreamed out to Mr. Howard and Lady
Horatia; but the croud had ſo far divided
them from her, that neither heard her, and
before ſhe could effectually interfere to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it, ſuch words had paſſed between
Vavaſour and Thorold, as nothing but blood
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0206900204:91"/>
is, by the laws of honour, ſupppoſed to
atone for. Celeſtina, who heard them in
affright not to be deſcribed, now diſengaged
herſelf from both of them, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what ſhe did, only having ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
idea that ſhe might meet Captain
Thorold in the room, ſhe ran back thither
alone.</p>
            <p>Her beauty and her terror, whether it
was thought real or affected, gave her, in
the opinion of the firſt groups ſhe met, the
appearance of ſome young creature deſirous
to attract attention. Three or four young
men ſurrounded her, and enquired what
ſervice they could do her. Breathleſs and
ready to faint, ſhe anſwered that ſhe was in
ſearch of Captain Thorold.</p>
            <p>"Egad," cried one of them, "Captain
Thorold is a deviliſh lucky fellow."</p>
            <p>"And a very taſteleſs one," ſaid ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
"to leave ſuch a lovely creature to
ſeek for him."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina now underſtood how entirely
they miſtook her; and collecting ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0206900204:92"/>
of mind, ſaid—"For heaven's ſake,
gentlemen, aſſiſt me to find him. His
brother is engaged in a quarrel: a quarrel,
I fear, on my account—and—"</p>
            <p>She would have gone on, but unhappily
for her the party of men who ſurrounded
her were all of that deſcription which are
called bucks, who fancy they diſtinguiſh
themſelves by ſhewing how little they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the character of men. One or two of
theſe hearing of a quarrel, found they had
no diſpoſition to engage where there might
be trouble or danger, and therefore walked
away; but three others had now time to
conſider the eminent beauty of Celeſtina,
and to have ſettled in their own minds that
ſhe was a girl without character, which her
being alone, and even what ſhe had told
them of a quarrel on her account, ſeemed
to authoriſe: they were therefore all deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
not to let her go; and far from
thinking of relieving the terror in which
they ſaw her, and which they indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to be a mere piece of acting, two
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0206900204:93"/>
of them took her arms within theirs, and
held with her ſuch diſcourſe as encreaſed
her alarm almoſt to diſtraction. She now
knew not what ſhe ſaid. Terror for herſelf
had ſo mingled itſelf with her fears of what
might happen between Vavaſour and Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
that ſhe ſometimes angrily entreated
her perſecutors to releaſe her, then humbly
beſought them to ſee for Captain Thorold,
till at length, as they led her again towards
the door, her fears were become inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
and ſhrieking, ſhe entreated them
rather to kill her than expoſe her to ſuch
horror as ſhe felt. At this moment, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
by a ſudden ſpring, ſhe diſengaged
herſelf: Willoughby was returning alone
along the paſſage: ſhe ſaw him, and threw
herſelf into his arms.</p>
            <p>"Save me, ſave me, Willoughby!" was
all ſhe could utter, before, quite overcome
with variety of terrors, ſhe became almoſt
ſenſeleſs; her head reſting on his ſhoulder,
and his arms ſupporting her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0206900204:94"/>
He looked ſternly on the young men,
and demanded the occaſion of the lady's
alarm. They replied that they knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than that ſhe had run into the
room alone, enquiring for a Captain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body,
and that they had endeavoured to
find the cauſe of her fright and to aſſiſt her.
Willoughby, who did not believe this, but
who was more ſolicitous to recover the
fainting Celeſtina than to puniſh theſe idle
boys, waved with his hand for them to be
gone, and they immediately obeyed; for
it was the defenceleſs only they had courage
to inſult. Willoughby then, by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of a gentleman whom he happened to
know, led Celeſtina, who was juſt ſenſible,
into the room where the ladies cloaks are
received; and while his friend ran to get
her a glaſs of water, Willoughby placed
himſelf by her, and with one hand round
her waiſt, ſupported her with the other;
nor could he forbear, as he gazed on her
pale but ſtill lovely countenance, preſſing
her to that heart which had been ſo long
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0206900204:95"/>
fondly devoted to her. In a very ſhort
time ſhe drew a deep ſigh; and recovering
recollection, begged his pardon, in a voice
hardly articulate, for the trouble ſhe had
given him. She remembered that to the
huſband, the lover of Miſs Fitz-Hayman,
it muſt be trouble, and ſhe withdrew her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from his arms before he could aſk her,
(ſo abſorbed was he in the mingled ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of pain and pleaſure,) what had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
the alarm in which he had ſeen her.
With a ſigh ſtill deeper than her's, he now
made this enquiry. She anſwered, but not
very diſtinctly, that high words had ariſen
between Mr. Vavaſour and Mr. Montague
Thorold, and that not able to check their
impetuoſity, nor to overtake Lady Horatia
and Mr. Howard, who were gone on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſhe had fooliſhly run back into the
room to find ſomebody who might part
them, when thoſe young men had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
and inſulted her, till in her fear ſhe
knew not what ſhe did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0206900204:96"/>
"And all this terror—all this exceſſive
apprehenſion, was for Mr. Montague Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold?"
ſaid Willoughby, in a faultering
but not a tender voice: then, as if he had
diſcovered nothing but what he had before
known enough of to be eaſy under, he
ſeemed at once to repreſs all appearance of
intereſt as far as it related to Celeſtina, and
ſaid, with forced coldneſs—"I dare ſay,
Madam, you have nothing to apprehend
for his precious life. However, I will ſeek
my friend Vavaſour, and take care at leaſt
for to-night that it goes no farther, if you
will tell me where I can find him, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I ſhall have the honour of conducting you."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina was heart ſtruck by the manner
in which this was uttered. She turned her
expreſſive eyes on his, to enquire whether
he could really behave thus cruelly towards
her; his eyes met her's; but as if he could
not bear her looks he turned them away
towards the door, where his friend now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
with the water, and almoſt at the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0206900204:97"/>
ſame moment Mr. Howard came in, and
told her that Lady Horatia had been in
great alarm at her not following her to the
coach, where ſhe now waited for her. She
did not give him time to finiſh the ſentence,
before ſhe eagerly aſked if he had ſeen Mr.
Montague Thorold.</p>
            <p>"Seen him," cried Mr. Howard; "no
certainly. Is he not with you?"</p>
            <p>Celeſtina would then have related what
had happened; but her returning appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
that ſomething fatal might have
already been the conſequence, and the look
with which Willoughby ſurveyed her, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
deprived her of the power of ſpeech;
and Willoughby himſelf in a few words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to Mr. Howard what ſhe had told
him. "I do not know," added he, "what
ground Miſs de Mornay has had for the
alarm ſhe has been in; but I know Vavaſour
was not ſober, and poſſibly may have been
wrong headed: it will therefore be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
perhaps for me to enquire after him;
and as you Madam, ſeem to be now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0206900204:98"/>
and are ſafe in the protection of
Mr. Howard, I will wiſh you good night."
Having hurried over theſe words, he bowed
to Mr. Howard, then with equal coolneſs
to Celeſtina, and diſappeared.</p>
            <p>A ſhower of tears, the firſt ſhe had been
able to ſhed, fell from the eyes of Celeſtina
as ſhe loſt ſight of him. Theſe tears how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and the water ſhe had drank, a little
relieved her; and Mr. Howard again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
the uneaſineſs in which he had
left Lady Horatia, ſhe collected ſtrength
enough to avail herſelf of the aſſiſtance he
offered her; and leaning on his arm,
reached the coach, where ſhe was compelled,
however unequal to the recital, to relate to
Lady Horatia what had happened within
the twenty minutes, (for more had not
elapſed,) that ſhe had loſt ſight of her.</p>
            <p>Lady Horatia expreſſed great apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
for Montague Thorold; and thought,
with great appearance of truth, that unleſs
he had gone immediately away with Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
to decide their difference that evening,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0206900204:99"/>
he would have ſought them again, and have
relieved them from the extreme apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
which he muſt imagine they muſt be
under on his account.—Theſe conjectures,
which were but too well founded, and which
they had no means of ſatisfying, kept Lady
Horatia and Celeſtina awake the whole night:
towards morning, the former, who was leſs
deeply intereſted; and more accuſtomed to
the painful events of life than Celeſtina,
found ſome repoſe; but Celeſtina herſelf
was up by break of day, liſtening to every
noiſe in the ſtreet, and trembling every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
leaſt ſhe ſhould hear of ſome fatal acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
and her reflections, which no longer
offered her any thing to hope, were buſy in
repreſenting and magnifying all the evils
which ſhe had to apprehend.</p>

            <p>THE cruel ſuſpenſe as to the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
diſappearance of Montague Thorold
with Vavaſour the evening before, laſted till
near ten o'clock; when, as Lady Horatia
and Celeſtina were ſitting at a breakfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
where the uneaſineſs they were both
under did not allow them to eat, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
announced Captain Thorold.—Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
turned pale as death at the name; but
there was no time to expreſs any part of the
fear ſhe felt before he entered.</p>
            <p>His air was aſſuming, confident, and what
the French call <hi>glorieux.</hi> But from that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
could judge nothing; for ſhe knew
he had too little regard for his brother to have
been much affected at any thing that might
have befallen him. He paid his compliments
in the common form to Lady Horatia, who
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0206900204:101"/>
was too much concerned to be able to anſwer
them; and then turning to the ſilent, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Celeſtina, he ſaid, with an unfeeling
ſmile, "Well, Madam, your young cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
is living."</p>
            <p>"Good God," cried Celeſtina, "has he
ever then been in danger?" "Yes," replied
the Captain, "he has been in all the danger
that a man can be who has a brace of piſtols
fired at him; and is now in as much as is
uſual to a man who has a ball lodged in his
ſhoulder."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina could not ſpeak; ſhe could with
difficulty breathe: but Lady Horatia now
eagerly enquired the particulars, and learned,
that in conſequence of violent language
that paſſed between Vavaſour and Montague
Thorold, after Celeſtina left them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
evening, a challenge had paſſed, and
a meeting been appointed in Chelſea Fields, at
ſeven o'clock in the morning;—that Thorold,
after quitting Vavaſour, had in vain endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to find out Lady Horatia and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
and meeting his brother, and relating
to him what had happened, was by him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
from attempting it, as he could not
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0206900204:102"/>
ſee them without informing them of what
had paſſed, and was yet to happen; that he
had therefore gone home with Captain Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
who had, at the appointed time, attended
him to the field, where Vavaſour was with a
friend; and where, the preliminaries being
ſoon ſettled, each fired without effect; but
neither declaring themſelves ſatisfied, they
fired again, and Montague Thorold received
a ball in his ſhoulder, which was not extracted
when his brother left him at his lodgings,
whither he was immediately conveyed, and
where he was attended by an eminent ſurgeon.
"And is he in danger, Sir," ſaid Celeſtina,
with all that tremulous tenderneſs in her
voice that her extreme ſenſibility gave her—"Is
he in danger? is he in pain?"</p>
            <p>Captain Thorold gave her a look which
ſeemed to ſay "Humph"—it <hi>is</hi> true, then, that
you are violently in love with this, brother of
mine: and then, anſwered—"The ſurgeon,
on whoſe ſkill I have great reaſon to rely,
does not ſeem to think him in danger; but
till the ball is extracted, which will be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with pain enough, it is not, I fancy, eaſy
to ſpeak very poſitively.—However, Miſs de
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0206900204:103"/>
Mornay, Montague wont complain of the
pain, let it be as ſevere as it will, while he
recollects that he ſuffers in your defence, and
hears, what I ſhall not fail to relate, how
dearly you are intereſted for him."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina could not ſay that this unlucky
affair did not originate about her; indeed,
ſhe had not at that moment ſtrength to enter
on any explanation; nor could ſhe deny, that
ſhe was extremely concerned, or make Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Thorold comprehend that for a ſtranger,
under the ſame circumſtances, ſhe ſhould have
been greatly, if not equally ſorry:—As to
Lady Horatia, who hoped that this accident
would operate deciſively on behalf of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,
ſhe rather encouraged than contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
the idea that his brother ſeemed to
entertain of Celeſtina's partiality towards him:
And now the Captain, with as much uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
as if nothing had happened, ſeemed only
deſirous of diſplaying his own conſequence
and his own perfections: as if to convince
them both, that for a woman, who had ever
ſeen him and his brother together, to prefer
the latter, was an inſtance of moſt terrible want
of diſcernment. Several times was Celeſtina,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0206900204:104"/>
who could hardly ſupport herſelf, on the point
of withdrawing; but ſhe thought, that were
ſhe to quit the room, it would look ſtill more
as if ſhe was ſinking under her apprehenſions;
and ſhe beſides feared, that were ſhe abſent,
the zeal of Lady Horatia would induce her
to explain to Captain Thorold more of her
wiſhes and projects in regard to her and his
brother than, feeling as ſhe did the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of their ever taking place, ought in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
or in juſtice to be talked of.</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons, wretched and diſtreſſed
as ſhe was, ſhe had yet reſolution enough to
remain in her place; till at length Captain
Thorold, having paraded about himſelf for
near half an hour, withdrew.</p>
            <p>Then it was, that, from the converſation
of her friend, Celeſtina underſtood how much
ſuch an event would be expected to affect her
ſentiments in favour of Montague Thorold;
and how impoſſible Lady Horatia conſidered it
for her, after all the ſufferings he muſt ſuſtain
on her account, to delay rewarding thoſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
and his long and ardent attachment to
her longer than till his recovery: of which,
notwithſtanding what Captain Thorold had
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0206900204:105"/>
ſaid of the poſſibility of danger, ſhe ſeemed
not to doubt; though ſhe expreſſed great
concern for the pain he muſt endure, and
great anxiety to be informed of his actual ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.
To all that ſhe ſaid, Celeſtina hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
anſwered a word—her heart was too much
oppreſſed; and ſhe could ſay nothing that
would not appear either like inſenſibility, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
or like the anxious ſolicitude of
love. She wiſhed to avoid either: ſhe wiſhed
to be alone; and though the determination
Lady Horatia almoſt immediately formed to
viſit Montague Thorold herſelf, was a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
which muſt ſtrongly confirm all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
that ſhe wiſhed to diſcourage, yet it
releaſed her to her own reflections, and ſhe
was glad at that moment to ſee her friend
depart.</p>
            <p>Her own reflections, to which ſhe was now
left, were moſt uneaſy—She knew that ſuch
an affair muſt unavoidably be much and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
talked of: ſhe knew how much it
would be miſrepreſented, and what conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
would be made upon it. The expreſſion
uſed by Willoughby the evening before ſtill
vibrated in her ears: "What! and is all this
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0206900204:106"/>
terror, all this apprehenſion, for Montague
Thorold." It was diſpleaſing then to him
that ſhe ſhould feel an intereſt for Montague
Thorold—and the little tenderneſs he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to ſhew her, was repreſſed the moment
he underſtood who was the ſubject of her
alarm—conſcious that hopeleſs as ſhe had long
been of his affection, and ſubmitting to the
neceſſity of their ſeparation, ſhe had yet never
beſtowed on another the heart he had reſigned,
ſhe could not bear to think how much every
circumſtance had contributed to make him
think, that ſhe had lightly given it to the
firſt candidate; nor could her mind dwell
without extreme concern, on the pain this
affair would give the elder Mr. Thorold,
whoſe hopes were, ſhe well knew, centered in
his youngeſt ſon, and who would not only
be diſtreſſed by the ſickneſs and danger to
which he had thus expoſed himſelf, but he hurt
at his having acted ſo contrary to thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
he had always endeavoured to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
as to giving or receiving a challenge.—Nor
were the ſufferings of Montague Thorold
himſelf the leaſt part of her concern: ſhe
apprehended he might be long confined in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0206900204:107"/>
great pain; he might perhaps loſe his arm,
or even his life: and while ſhe regretted the
raſhneſs which had been the occaſion of this
hazard, ſhe could not but acknowledge, that
it was impoſſible a young man of ſpirit could
otherwiſe have anſwered the unprovoked fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocity
of Vavaſour.</p>
            <p>Of him ſhe thought with terror; and
knowing that he was capable of any impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
in the humour he was now in, ſhe gave
immediate orders, that if he came ſhe ſhould
be denied.</p>
            <p>All the circumſtances of the preceding
evening, which the fear that had beſet her
during the latter part of it had for a while
driven from her recollection, now returned to
it; and the repeated intelligence ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
throughout the day of Willoughby's
marriage, all the particulars with which it had
been related, the happy looks of Miſs Fitz-Hayman,
the proud triumph that ſat on the
features of her mother, and the forced friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with which Lady Molyneux ſeemed to
have connected herſelf with perſons who were
ſo lately the objects of her averſion, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0206900204:108"/>
the reports that were in circulation, ſo
as to put their truth beyond a doubt.</p>
            <p>In a few days ſhe was to hear of their actually
being married: to liſten again to the detail of
their nuptial ſplendor, perhaps to witneſs them:
ſhe was to be ſurrounded by a thouſand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
people who would enquire and talk to
her about the duel; and, with an heart ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
muſt attend to them with patience,
and anſwer them with civility. The whole
proſpect before her was too unpleaſant; ſhe
fancied it impoſſible to be endured; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to attempt, though at the hazard of
appearing ungrateful, perhaps of diſobliging
her beſt and almoſt her only friend, to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit
leave to go down to Jeſſy, at leaſt till the
public converſation ſhould have been turned
to ſome other topic, and the public curioſity
no longer excited by the marriage of Miſs
Fitz-Hayman, or the rencontre of Vavaſour
and Thorold.</p>
            <p>The natural ſoftneſs of her heart made her,
among all theſe ſources of peculiar uneaſineſs,
really and tenderly intereſted for Montague
Thorold: and ſhe awaited the return of Lady
Horatia with as much ſolicitude as ſhe could
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0206900204:109"/>
have felt if a beloved brother had been in
ſuch a ſituation: perhaps ſhe would have felt
more for nobody but Willoughby himſelf.
It was, therefore, a great relief to her haraſſed
ſpirits, when ſhe heard, that while Captain
Thorold had been in Park-ſtreet, the bullet
had been extracted; that no bone had been
injured by it, and that he was in as good a
way as could be expected; his ſurgeon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
that from the nature of the wound,
and the good conſtitution of his patient, he.
thought him in no danger, and ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
at the end of a fortnight, diſmiſs him
with his arm in a ſling.</p>
            <p>The ſatisfaction Celeſtina expreſſed on this
account, was not however increaſed, when
Lady Horatia added, that far from complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his ſufferings, he exulted and rejoiced
in them; flattering himſelf that ſhe for whom
he could willingly have riſked an hundred
lives if he had poſſeſſed them, would feel
ſome pity for him; and knowing how much
power, in ſuch a heart as hers, that ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had to produce others ſtill more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0206900204:110"/>
Lady Horatia then went on to ſay very
ſeriouſly to Celeſtina, that ſhe ought no longer
to trifle with ſuch a man, but reſolve imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to give him her hand: not only as the
reward of his merit, but to preclude the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
pretenſions of Vavaſour: "to whoſe
perſeverance," ſaid ſhe, "no refuſal, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
ſeems to put an end."</p>
            <p>"Deareſt Madam," ſaid Celeſtina, <hi>did</hi> I
ever trifle with Mr. Thorold—ſurely I never
meant it—ſo far from it, I have an hundred
times regretted that your Ladyſhip's partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
towards him, and the influence you have
and ought to have over me, have combined
to keep him in an error, which all my candid
dealing with him has not had the power to
refute. I have told him, whenever he has
urged the ſubject, that he is in poſſeſſion of
my eſteem and of my friendſhip, but that
for my love I have it not to beſtow."</p>
            <p>"But he is content, my dear, with your
eſteem, with your friendſhip; and knows
that, in ſuch a heart as yours, love will follow
his attachment to you; eſpecially as you <hi>now</hi>
ſurely cannot alledge that any other perſon
poſſeſſes it."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0206900204:111"/>
Celeſtina, too conſcious of all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
that ought long ſince to have induced
her to withdraw it from Willoughby, yet
equally conſcious that ſhe could never feel for
another that degree of affection of which
ſhe had been ſenſible for him, was ſilent a
moment or two, and then ſaid, "Dear Lady
Horatia, why muſt I marry at all? while
you afford me your protection can I be
happier; and ſhould I be unhappy enough
to loſe it, ſhould I not be more likely to meet
content even with my ſmall and humble for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
if I remained ſingle, than if I gave my
hand where I have no power to beſtow my
heart."</p>
            <p>"I am amazed," replied Lady Horatia,
"that with ſuch very good ſenſe as you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs,
you would accuſton yourſelf to cheriſh
theſe childiſh and girliſh notions: what is this
love, without feeling all the violence of which,
you ſuppoſe it impoſſible to be happy?"</p>
            <p>"Dear Madam," cried Celeſtina, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
her, "have I not heard you ſay, that
you once was ſenſible of it yourſelf; and that
having been compelled to quit the man of
your choice, you conſidered ſuch a neceſſity
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0206900204:112"/>
as a heavy affliction, and that it rendered moſt
of the occurrences of your ſubſequent life
indifferent to you?"</p>
            <p>Yes, you have heard me ſay ſo—I merely
acknowledged a folly, a weakneſs, which I
pretended not to defend in myſelf, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
not to encourage in you.—What has
been the life of this man, whom I called, in
the romantic ſimplicity of ſixteen, my firſt
love? When my father parted us, and I was
compelled by his authority to give my hand
to General Howard, he was a younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with very little fortune. In a twelve-month
afterwards, the death of his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and an uncle gave him a very large for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
and he quitted the navy, where he had,
for ſo young a man, highly diſtinguiſhed
himſelf, and with his profeſſion he ſeemed to
reſign his virtues. He married a woman to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
whom he profeſſed himſelf indifferent;
and whoſe only recommendation was a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
nearly as large as his own. To her he
behaved with neglect, which ſhe repaid with
ſcorn and infidelity. They ſeemed to agree
in nothing but mutual extravagance; till at
length they parted, and he now lives in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0206900204:113"/>
France the greateſt part of the year; at other
times wanders about the world, to gratify his
taſte for variety, and fly from thoſe corroſive
reflections which muſt purſue him who has
ruined his health and his fortune by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery.
Can I, when I conſider all this, help
deſpiſing myſelf for the pain I felt at being
ſeparated from ſuch a man; and ought I not
rather to rejoice at what once appeared an
inſupportable misfortune?</p>
            <p>"Ah, Madam," ſaid Celeſtina, "it is well
if by theſe reflections you have been enabled
to conquer thoſe remains of uſeleſs regret
which might otherwiſe have embittered your
life: but give me leave to aſk, ſince there is
now no danger of renewing them, give me
leave to aſk, whether you ſincerely believe
that this gentleman, had he married you,
would have paſſed a life as blameable? You
have told me that he was paſſionately
attached to you: you now ſay, that to the
lady he married he was indifferent: ſurely to
that may be imputed all his errors.—His
mind became unhinged when he loſt her to
whom it was devoted, and he aggravated
himſelf the cruelty of his deſtiny. To you
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0206900204:114"/>
he might have been an excellent huſband,
becauſe he loved you; but loſing the poſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibility
of being happy, he loſt the wiſh to be
reſpectable; and ſince he could not live with
you, cared not with whom or how he
lived."</p>
            <p>"There may be ſome truth," ſaid Lady
Horatia, "in your remarks; but to be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
eaſy, Celeſtina, in this world, you
muſt learn to be more of an Optimiſt; and to
believe, that whatever happens, could not, nor
ought not to have been otherwiſe. Thus the
interference of Lady Caſtlenorth, whatever
might have been her motives, has ſaved you
from a marriage that might have been a hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
crime; thus, not to enumerate other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
that muſt occur to your recollection;
thus, the wild brutality of Vavaſour, and
even the wound of Montague, will all contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
finally to good, and produce that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
for you with him, which I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you would have found with any other
perſon."</p>
            <p>To this doctrine Celeſtina could not agree.
But the fear and fatigue ſhe had within the laſt
twenty-four hours undergone, diſqualified her
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0206900204:115"/>
for any farther diſcuſſion of the ſubject at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
or for the attempt ſhe meant to make to
prevail on Lady Horatia to allow her to go
down to Jeſſy for a few weeks; her eyes were
indeed ſo heavy, her complexion ſo pale in
conſequence of her long agitation, that now
the immediate fears for Montague Thorold's
life were over, Lady Horatia adviſed her to
take ſome repoſe; a propoſal which ſhe glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accepted; and in deſpite of the variety of
uneaſineſs ſhe ſtill laboured under, exhauſted
nature obtained for her a few hours reſpite in
ſleep: though ſhe was, in her previous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations,
ſo far from aſſenting heartily to
the reſigned philoſophy of Lady Horatia,
that ſhe thought with anguiſh of the fate of
Willoughby, who might, ſhe feared, by the
ſame diſappointments in the early part of his
life, become quite unlike what he once was;
and from his cruel neglect of her ſince he
had been in London, ſhe already fancied ſhe
ſaw that this change had begun.</p>
            <p>But could ſhe for one moment have ſeen
the real ſtate of that mind whoſe virtues ſhe
believed to be tarniſhed, ſhe would have found
it as worthy as ever of her tenderneſs, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0206900204:116"/>
entitled to all her pity. Tormented by an
affection which he could not indulge for one
woman, and entangled by a ſeries of perverſe
events in an engagement with another; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed
in his circumſtances, and diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with himſelf; his whole life paſſed in a
continual tumult of contending paſſions; and
whatever means he took to calm and mitigate
them ſeemed only to irritate his ſufferings.—Thus,
when he left his own lodgings on the
day of his interview with Miſs Fitz-Hayman
and his meeting Celeſtina, he went to the
hotel where Vavaſour uſually lived when he
was in town; and where it happened that a
party of their mutual acquaintance that day
dined: this prevented his having any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with Vavaſour, which, though it
might have contributed but little to relieve
his vexation as to Montague Thorold, would
have eaſed his heart by unburthening it to
his friend; and Vavaſour drank ſo much, that
there was afterwards no hopes of his hearing
him rationally. With him he was prevailed
upon, at a late hour, to go to Ranelagh;—where
he ſaw Celeſtina again with the very
man to whom he had been ſo repeatedly told
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0206900204:117"/>
ſhe had engaged herſelf; and there, though
Celeſtina happened not to ſee them together,
he was compelled to take ſeveral turns with
Lady Caſtlenorth, her daughter, and his
ſiſter; thus confirming, by his appearance in
public with the two former, what it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
too late to retract, though he had already
moſt bitterly repented it.</p>
            <p>The quarrel between Vavaſour and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague
Thorold, of which his ſuddenly quitting
the place where he met Celeſtina was partly
the occaſion (for had he ſtaid he might have
prevented it), added to the conviction he
now had that Thorold was very ſoon to be her
huſband; and increaſed his vexation, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
of all that reaſon could ſay to counteract
the effect of it. That reaſon repeatedly aſked
him—if Celeſtina had really been brought
up and acknowledged as his ſiſter, and had
with ſo ſmall a fortune been addreſſed by Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
and herſelf approved him, whether he
could in ſuch a caſe have made any reaſonable
objection? He was compelled to anſwer no!
yet his heart revolted againſt the aſſent which
common ſenſe urged him to give to a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
which differed in nothing from what
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0206900204:118"/>
would then have been the caſe, but in early
prejudice. He never could learn to conſider
Celeſtina as related to him by blood; nor did
all the pains he had taken to learn the truth
convince him of it; though he dared not act
as if he wholly diſbelieved it. Yet ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
is an heart under the influence of ſuch
paſſion as he felt, that while he had relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
her, and agreed to marry another, left
that relationſhip ſhould really exiſt, he deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Thorold for having, as he believed, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
himſelf of thoſe affections, which, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than as her brother, he had owned he
dared not claim.</p>
            <p>When he left Celeſtina under the care of
Mr. Howard at Ranelagh the preceding even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he had gone, as he promiſed, in ſearch
of Vavaſour; but not finding him any where
about the room, or in the avenues to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunda,
he had gone to his lodgings, and
waited there till near four in the morning.—He
then left orders with his ſervant to ſend
for him the moment his maſter came; but
Vavaſour, inſtead of returning to his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
at all that evening, ſlept ſomewhere elſe;
and only called there in a hackney-coach at
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0206900204:119"/>
half paſt five o'clock to take his piſtols; and
his ſervant being ordered to attend him,
with the ſurgeon, there was no poſſibility of
his man giving Willoughby notice; and of
courſe he could do nothing to ſtop a ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contre
of which he did not hear till after it
was over.</p>
            <p>Vavaſour, who then came to him, was not
ſober: and Willoughby ſaw, with more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
than ſurpriſe, that the habits his friend
had acquired ſince his laſt abſence were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
inveterate, and were ruining alike his
conſtitution, his fortune, and his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Though he himſelf deteſted Montague
Thorold, and curſed the hour when he had
put Celeſtina under the protection of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and by that means thrown him in her
way; he was; too generous, even to an enemy,
not to feel that Vavaſour had behaved
with unwarrantable brutality; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his long friendſhip for him, he felt
too, that had he been as ſucceſsful as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
Thorold to be, all that friendſhip
would have been cancelled.</p>
            <p>He was vexed, however, at the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which this fooliſh buſineſs muſt occaſion;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0206900204:120"/>
and in which he knew the name of Celeſtina
muſt be joined with that of Montague Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold:
and when Vavaſour ſpoke with ſome
triumph of his having chaſtiſed the young
pedant, Willoughby, with a peeviſhneſs very
unuſual with him, ſaid, he heartily wiſhed he
had let it alone.</p>
            <p>From the little converſation he had with
Lady Caſtlenorth the evening before, he
found ſhe expected him to wait on them the
next day. Reluctantly, and with an aching
heart, he had then given a ſort of promiſe, and
with ſtill more regret he recollected it. The
ſun now never roſe for him but to bring him
a renewal of miſery; and his dejection never
left him, but to give place to paroxyſms of
paſſion and fits of fruitleſs deſpair.</p>
            <p>As the hour approached when he knew
he was expected at the houſe of his uncle,
his unwillingneſs to go increaſed. Farn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
who now anxiouſly watched all his
looks, ſaw a deeper gloom come upon him:
he ſaw him take out ſeveral letters, read them,
replace them, then ſnatch up a pen, write a
few lines, and hurry a-croſs the room as if
undecided what to do. At length he wrote
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0206900204:121"/>
a few lines, ſealed the note, and put it in his
pocket. Farnham had heard a great deal of
the duel that had happened the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and knew it was about Miſs de Mornay,
and that a gentleman had been wounded dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly.
He had heard converſation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his maſter and Vavaſour, and ſuppoſed,
from their manner, that they parted in anger.
This circumſtance put it in his head, which
was rather an honeſt than a clear one, that
ſome other affair of honour, in which his
maſter was concerned, was ſtill in agitation;
and he ſo thoroughly perſuaded himſelf of
this, that he determined to obſerve narrowly
every thing that happened, and to take all
poſſible precautions againſt his maſter's hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch an accident beſal him as had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to Mr. Montague Thorold,</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe he attached himſelf very
cloſely to the hole in the door between the
dining-room and the bed-chamber; and when
he was ſummoned, by a furious ring, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him, he was under the neceſſity of firſt
ſlipping ſoftly down ſtairs, and then running
up to aſk his commands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0206900204:122"/>
Willoughby gave him two notes, and aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
if the groom was within. On hearing he
he was not: "Then go yourſelf," ſaid he,
"with theſe two notes: no anſwer is required
to either: return as ſoon as you can."—Farnham
promiſing to be expeditious, left
him; and reading the directions, found one to
be, to Miſs de Mornay, the other to Mr.
Vavaſour. This, with all he knew of his
maſter's former attachment and embarraſſing
doubts about Celeſtina, and all that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
that evening before, and that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
convinced him beyond a doubt, that
another duel would happen, which he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
it to be his peculiar duty to prevent.—He
was not very fertile in expedients: but it
occurred to him that the beſt way would be
to carry both theſe letters, and at the ſame
time communicate his fears, to Sir Philip and
Lady Molyneux.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip was not at home; but Lady
Molyneux, on hearing he wanted to ſpeak to
her; ordered him up.</p>
            <p>He opened his buſineſs with great gravity;
detailed all the cauſe he had for apprehenſion
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0206900204:123"/>
from his maſter's behaviour, and produced
the two notes.</p>
            <p>Lady Molyneux affected to agree with him
as to the juſtice of his fears, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
his prudence and fidelity; ſhe then told
him ſhe thought it would be the beſt way to
open the letters, which, as ſhe happened to
have a ſeal with the Willoughby arms, the
ſame as her brother's, ſhe could eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeal;
and ſend, if they contained nothing of
what they ſuſpected; and if they did, that it
would be proper to deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>Poor Farnham, trembling as he ſpoke, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to all this, only entreating her to take
care that his maſter might never know it. This
ſhe readily promiſed; and, taking all the
blame upon herſelf, bade him retire while
ſhe opened the letters, and come up again
when ſhe rang.</p>
            <p>She then read them.—That to Vavaſour
was merely to put off an appointment for the
evening, which Willoughby found himſelf
unable to attend.—That to Celeſtina ran thus:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <p>I ſhould have ſent to you, Madam, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
on my arrival in London: but ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

for ſome days prevented my being able
even to write, and in that interval I heard
that you were on the point of putting your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

deem ſuch an addreſs improper, and render
it needleſs.</p>
                  <p>That you have come to this reſolution
without conſulting any of thoſe who were once
honoured with your friendſhip, I can now no
longer doubt. I, however, feel it in ſome

This letter, cold and unlike his former
ſtyle to Celeſtina as it was, his ſiſter imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
reſolved to ſuppreſs. Her hatred to
Celeſtina was increaſed to a degree of inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
malignity of which it was difficult to
conceive her haughty <hi>indolence</hi> was capable;
and this aroſe chieſly from the admiration ſhe
every where ſaw her beauty excited, which
was a point in which ſhe could not bear to be
excelled. Convinced as ſhe internally was,
that Celeſtina was an orphan ſtranger, brought
up on her mother's charity, ſhe choſe rather to
leave the report of their relationſhip uncontra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
than to ſee her united to her brother,
and put on a footing with herſelf, to which
that equivocal relationſhip could give her no
claim: and ſince the ſuppreſſion of her letter to
Willoughby, which an interview now would
explain, ſhe was doubly ſolicitous to prevent
it—Her pride could not bear that her brother
ſhould become the humble and reduced coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
gentleman that he muſt ſubmit to be if he
married a woman without fortune; and her
avarice repreſented the poſſibility of his being,
in ſuch a caſe, a burthen on his affluent rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0206900204:126"/>
All theſe conſiderations determined
her to ſtifle it, and the ſentence with which
the letter concluded, aſſured her ſhe might do
it with impunity. She therefore called up
Farnham, on whoſe ſimplicity it was very eaſy
to impoſe, and told him that the letter to
Mr. Vavaſour was very immaterial, and that
he might carry that; but that the other to
Miſs de Mornay, was of a nature to involve
his maſter in great difficulties, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe would deſtroy it. She then put it
in the fire; and bide him carry the other,
which ſhe had carefully re-ſealed. This
Farnham immediately did; but being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to be guilty of a greater falſehood
than there ſeemed to be occaſion for, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
went to Park-ſtreet that he might tell
his maſter he had been there.</p>
            <p>On his return, Willoughby queſtioned him
who he ſaw at Lady Horatia's.—For this
queſtion the poor fellow was not prepared.—However
he anſwered—"I ſaw John, Sir,
my Lady's own footman."</p>
            <p>"Well—and was Miſs de Mornay at
home?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0206900204:127"/>
"No, Sir," replied Farnham, who had
now acquired courage; "but you know you
bade me not wait for an anſwer."</p>
            <p>"Well, but had you not the ſenſe to aſk
where ſhe was?"</p>
            <p>"No, Sir; to be ſure I did not think of
that: but, however, I fancy ſhe was viſiting,
Sir, the wounded gentleman in Oxford-ſtreet."</p>
            <p>Willoughby knew that Montague Thorold
lodged there, and that it muſt be him alone
who was deſcribed as the wounded gentleman.</p>
            <p>"And why do you think ſo, Sir," ſaid he,
fiercely, as if poor Farnham had been acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to it—"and what the devil have you
to do to think about it?"</p>
            <p>"Lord, Sir," cried Farnham, "only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
as I came along I ſaw my lady's coach
at the door where I knew young Mr. Thorold
lodges, and juſt nodded to Sam, who was
upon the box."</p>
            <p>"Curſed fool!" exclaimed Willoughby—"could
you not have aſked whether ſhe was
there or no: yet why ſhould I deſire to know;"
added he, riſing and walking about with his
hands clenched together—"what is it to me?
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0206900204:128"/>
and why do I torment myſelf?—Go, Sir, and
fetch my powdering gown and my things to
dreſs." Poor Farnham, convinced that Lady
Molyneux was right in what ſhe had done, yet
rendered doubly timid by the conſciouſneſs
of having committed a ſort of fraud on his
maſter, haſtily obeyed.</p>

            <p>THE ſituation of Celeſtina was rendered
infinitely more uneaſy to her by the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the laſt two or three days; and her
ſpirits could no longer ſupport her—The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of meeting Willoughby wherever ſhe
went, and of meeting him only to be more
and more convinced that he had ceaſed to
feel any degree of affection for her, made the
thoughts of continuing her preſent mode of
life, which had any charms in her opinion,
quite inſupportable to her. The converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about the duel—the queſtions ſhe ſhould
be aſked, and the impertinence ſhe muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to, encreaſed the averſion with which ſhe
thought of appearing again in public; and
ſhe determined, at any hazard, to propoſe to
Lady Horatia, that ſhe might go into the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0206900204:130"/>
country, and there wait, wherever ſhe pleaſed,
till ſhe ſhould herſelf quit London.</p>
            <p>She took, therefore, the firſt moment they
were alone together, to prefer and urge this
requeſt: and after making ſome objections,
which, however, the altered looks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
ſpirits of Celeſtina very forcibly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
Lady Horatia conſented to her going;
but as the houſe of Jeſſy was too near Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtone,
where it was ſuppoſed Willoughby and
his bride were immediately to go after their
marriage—it was ſettled that ſhe ſhould, with a
maid to attend her, go to Cheltenham, and wait
there till Lady Horatia could leave London,
which ſhe propoſed doing in a fortnight or
three weeks at fartheſt. This plan being
once arranged, Celeſtina was impatient till it
was executed; and ſo effectually ſet about the
little preparations ſhe had to make, that the
next day ſhe left London—and for the firſt
time ſince her quitting the Hebrides, enjoyed
the calm ſolitude ſhe loved.</p>
            <p>Wretched in the mean time was the ſtate of
Willoughby; he went to dine at Lord Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norths,
as he had been obliged to promiſe—where
a large company were aſſembled, as if
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0206900204:131"/>
to receive him, for the firſt time, as the heir
and acknowledged ſon-in-law of Lord Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north.
He had, however, no power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal,
under the common forms of life, the
miſery of his internal. feelings; his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
refuſed to wear the forced ſmile of
complaiſance; his emotion when the duel was
talked of, and the name of Celeſtina was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced,
was evident enough to all but thoſe
who did not chuſe to ſee it.</p>
            <p>Lord Caſtlenorth was, indeed, never very
much celebrated for diſcernment; but his
Lady, who highly piqued herſelf on her ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity—on
the facility with which ſhe read
characters, and penetrated the views of thoſe
with whom ſhe converſed—her blindneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was evidently wilful—and that of her
daughter, unleſs her love or her vanity inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
her right, was equally ſtrange—cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it was, that they either could not, or
would not, attend to the reluctant melancholy
of Willoughby, under which he with difficulty
concealed the bitter agonies of deſpair; and
they appeared perfectly ſatisfied with him and
with themſelves.</p>
            <p>There was one face, however, in the circle
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0206900204:132"/>
that, though it wore looks of feſtivity, yet was
now and then ſeen to ſurvey Willoughby with
indignant ſcorn; and then, as if checked for
indulging it, to reſume the ſmile of approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and complacency. Captain Cavanaugh
indeed did not very frequently addreſs himſelf
to him; but converſed chiefly with the
Ladies. But whenever he did ſpeak to him,
Willoughby himſelf, who had till now very
little noticed him, could not help remarking
that there was ſomething peculiar in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>When the Gentlemen were left together,
Lord Caſtlenorth, who could not drink, and
whoſe health obliged him to retire early,
called to his nephew, and bade him take his
place. This Willoughby, who had been all
day meditating how he might make an early
eſcape, was compelled to do, though he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
"that as Captain Cavanaugh uſually
took that ſeat when his Lordſhip retired, he
wiſhed him then to aſſume it." Lord Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north,
however, perſiſted; and Willoughby,
willing to get rid of an irkſome taſk as ſoon
as poſſible, made the wine circulate ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that, as he was never in habits of drinking,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0206900204:133"/>
he ſoon began to find himſelf looſing his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
in a kind of bewildering ſtupor: any
thing ſeemed better to him than the taſk of
entertaining Miſs Fitz-Hayman for the reſt of
the evening; and as he felt he by degrees
ceaſed to think of her, he found ſome ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in drinking, and was very ſoon complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intoxicated.</p>
            <p>He was no longer capable of judging for
himſelf, or he would not have gone up ſtairs
in ſuch a ſituation—he had juſt recollection
enough left to ſtay, without committing any
great extravagance, while tea was ſerved; and
then gladly followed a ſervant who whiſpered
to him that Lord Caſtlenorth deſired the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of ſeeing him in his own apartment.</p>
            <p>Thither he ſtaggered with very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs;
and being ſeated where his uncle
ſat oppoſite to him, in a great chair, while
ſeveral parchments lay open on a table, he
heard, but without the leaſt comprehenſion of
what was ſaid, a long harangue—on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and family, heraldry and genealogy,
titles and ſucceſſions;—the whole of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
by his informing him that the money
was ready to pay off all the incumbrances on
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0206900204:134"/>
his eſtate, which was to be immediately done;
that the ſettlements were in hand, and to be
finiſhed in a week; and that, that day fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
was fixed for the marriage. Willoughby,
between the verboſe confuſion of his uncle's
mode of delivery and his own incapacity of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
heard it all, but underſtood nothing;
he was not, however, ſo unconſcious of pain
and ſickneſs. Mrs. Calder, who for the
greater part of this converſation had ſat read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a treatiſe on bilious concretions, on the
oppoſite ſide of the room, with her ſpectacles
on, now finding Lord Caſtlenorth had done,
and that Willoughby looked very likely to
ſink out of his chair, very wiſely ended this
converſation, by ſending up Farnham to his
maſter, who had him conveyed home in a
chair.</p>
            <p>The next morning he was awakened to a
perfect recollection of all that had paſſed the
evening before; and became too certain, that
the means he had taken to obtain a temporary
releaſe from his fetters, had ſerved only to
rivet them more cloſely. Alas! he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
too—with poignant anguiſh remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered,
that ſo many hours had elapſed ſince he
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0206900204:135"/>
had written to Celeſtina; and that it was now
too certain ſhe would not anſwer his letter,
and wholly declined ſeeing him.</p>
            <p>Though he had ſo often determined never
to meet her again; ſo often perſuaded himſelf
not wiſh it; this cruel conviction of her total
eſtrangement from him, ſeemed to fall as
heavily as if he had never dreamed of their
ſeparation—ſhe might, however, be out of
town; ſhe might be engaged; ſomething
might have prevented her writing. To this
ſlender hope he clung for ſome hours of the
morning; but it inſenſibly became fainter as
his impatience encreaſed, and at length he
ordered Farnham to find the coachman of
Lady Horatia, with whom he was acquainted,
and try to diſcover any particulars he could.</p>
            <p>Farnham, dreading leſt his maſter ſhould
diſcover the impoſition he had ventured to
practice, dared not diſobey him—he ſat out
therefore for the ſtables, where, at that time
in the morning, he was ſure of finding his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance;
he found him indeed very buſy
in cleaning, with the aid of a poſtillion and a
helper, two of his horſes, which had been,
"poor things!" he ſaid, "the firſt ſtage to Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0206900204:136"/>
ham, with Miſs de Mornay and Rebecca the
maid, that my Lady ſent with her."—Farn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
made him repeat this intelligence; to
which he added, "Why, my Lady and all of
us be going down to Glouceſterſhire, in about
a fortnight; that is, as ſoon as young Mr.
Thorold is well enough to be moved, which,
the Doctor as tends him ſays, will be in that
time or leſs. My Lady takes his illneſs ſadly to
heart, and ſo does Miſs—and went out of
town ſadly down in the mouth; but, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
'tis well 'twas no worſe, you know;
and as he is like to do well—why there's no
great harm—and Miſs will be married all
one."</p>
            <p>The minuteſt article, of this account was
remembered by Farnham, and punctually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by him to his maſter—who now tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
convinced that all hope was at an end
of Celeſtina's retaining for him any affection;
and a certainty ſo dreadful; the aſſurance of
his being irrevocably engaged, and having
gone into Glouceſterſhire, there to wait the
recovery of Montague Thorold; the aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
that he ſhould never ſee her more—all
contributed, with his exceſs of the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0206900204:137"/>
to inflame his blood—and by four o'clock
he was in an high fever.</p>
            <p>His indiſpoſition was encreaſed by a viſit
from Vavaſour, who laughed at the vexation
and diſguſt he expreſſed at what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in regard to Montague Thorold; but
grew graver when he heard that, far from its
having put an end to his pretenſions to Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,
it had ſerved only to haſten their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.—The
wild and ill founded projects of
Vavaſour to prevent this, and to ſucceed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
which to Willoughby would have been
equally hateful, were but little calculated to
appeaſe his agitation, and quiet his boiling
blood; before Vavaſour went away, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
delirious—and Farnham, in a terrible
fright, went for Lady Molyneux and a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician—Lady
Molyneux was juſt ſtepping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her coach, when the affrighted face of Farn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
appeared before her—ſhe chid him for
the needleſs alarm he had given her; and ſaid,
that ſhe ſuppoſed it was nothing but a little
return of the fever her brother was ſubject
to—"I cannot," ſaid ſhe, "call now; but as
I come home this evening, I will ſee him."—The
phyſician, for whom Farnham then went,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0206900204:138"/>
directly attended; and found his patient,
though not in ſo high a fever as he had ſeen
him before, ill enough to require his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
aſſiſtance—which he ordered with ſo happy
an effect, that in a few hours the delirium en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ſubſided, and Willoughby, though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
languid, was at night almoſt free
from his fever.—Lady Molyneux who called
on him, ſoon after midnight, for a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
again blamed Farnham for his offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
apprehenſions; and being well convinced
that Willoughby would be glad of any excuſe
to keep back the preparations which were now
going on, ſhe endeavoured to perſuade him
that his illneſs was very triſling; and taking
occaſion to talk over what happened at Rane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagh,
told her brother, laughingly,—that ſhe
hoped he was now convinced of the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between young Thorold and Miſs de
Mornay—adding, "his brother, Captain Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
who is really an elegant and faſhionable
man, tells me they are to be married the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Montague is able to leave London."</p>
            <p>"Well, well," cried Willoughby, peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—"I
know it; and I do not deſire to hear
any more about it.—I thank you for calling
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0206900204:139"/>
on me; but it is very late, and my phyſician
deſires I will keep myſelf quiet."</p>
            <p>Lady Molyneux then withdrew, and poor
Willoughby, to whom ſhe had adminiſtered a
poiſon inſtead of a cordial, tried to find that
repoſe which he ſo greatly wanted: but to
him his eſtranged, his loſt Celeſtina, on one
hand, and on the other his intended bride,
ſeemed to cry—"ſleep no more."</p>
            <p>Farnham, who ſat up by him to adminiſter
the medicines he was to take, heard him ſigh
the greateſt part of the night without ceaſing;
and whenever he thought he might venture,
aſked him how he did.—"Pr'ythee, Farnham,"
ſaid he, after two or three of theſe queſtions,
"do not aſk me how I do—how ſhould a man
do, who is in a ſituation to envy every body
but the fellow juſt going to be hanged—you
know, that I am at this moment the moſt
miſerable fellow upon earth."</p>
            <p>"I am ſure I am very ſorry to hear it
anſwered his ſervant: but if I might be ſo
bold as to ſpeak, I ſhould ſay that I cannot
think what cauſe you can have to be miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able—nor....."</p>
            <p>He was going on, when Willoughby, eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0206900204:140"/>
catching aſide the curtain, ſaid, "What cauſe!—Have
I not loſt an angel—and am I not, have
I not condemned myſelf to marry—a woman
I cannot love—no, never; never, by Heaven."</p>
            <p>"To be ſure, Sir," ſaid Farnham, "to be
croſſed in love, as I may ſay, is very bad—as
I have heard tell—but in this here matter—all
things conſidered, I hope your honour's
mind will be ſettled about it; and as for the
two ladies, to be ſure beauty is all fancy—Miſs
Celeſtina, for certain, is a fine young
lady, and ſo good and gentle to ſervants,
that it was always a pleaſure to me to hear her
ſpeak to me, and to wait upon her; but then,
for certain, Miſs Fitz-Hayman, though ſhe is
higher and more ſtately, as ſhe ought to be,
being as ſhe is a lady of title and quality—is
a fine young lady too, and a very majeſtic
grand perſon—and then her great riches—"Curſe
on her riches," exclaimed Willoughby.
 "Aye, Sir;" ſaid Farnham, who was not a
little ſlattered by his confidence, and was now
got into one of his proſing humours—"Aye
Sir, it is very well for young, gentlemen to
cry curſe on this, and that, and t'other—but
as for riches—what can they do without them?
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0206900204:141"/>
Nobody is not reſpected the leaſt in the world,
if they don't make a ſhew, and a figure, and
the like of that—and can it be done without
money?—No—nor not without a pretty deal
on't—and, for my part, I own—I don't love
to ſee <hi>my</hi> maſter not able to vie with the beſt
lord of the land—as to be ſure he ought."</p>
            <p>"Thou art a fool, Farnham," cried Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby—"Do
have done with thy Lords of
the land, and give me twenty drops more of
the opiate"—"Yes, Sir," ſaid Farnham; and
prepared to obey him—but while he was
counting out the drops, he could not forbear
going on—"One, two—there are other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Sir,—three, four—about my Lord's
houſe, who, it's my notion—five, ſix, ſeven—are
not ſo apt to cry, curſe money—eight,
nine, ten—there is Captain Cavanaugh—eleven,
twelve, thirteen, fourteen"—"Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Cavanaugh," interrupts Willoughby—"What
of Captain Cavanaugh?" "Nay, Sir,—only
the Captain—as far as I can find—do'nt
hate money, nor cry, curſe it and damn
it—he has been long enough living about the
world, to know that nothing can be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, and—that is all, Sir."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0206900204:142"/>
"But that ſeems to me not to be all, Sir—pray,
tell me what Captain Cavanaugh has to
do with what we were talking of—with Miſs
Fitz-Hayman?"</p>
            <p>"Lord, nothing, Sir, I am ſure, that I know
of—only, if the young Lady was not engaged,
and in love with you, perhaps—the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
Sir, is reckoned, by the women, a very
handſome man, Sir—and Miſs Fitz-Hayman
may think ſo, as well as another." "Why
he is married—you booby—what ſtuff have
you got into your head; and who has been
talking to you of him and Miſs Fitz-Hayman;
let him be reckoned as handſome as he will
by the women—he can be nothing to Miſs
Fitz-Hayman—for I know he has been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
ſome years."</p>
            <p>"Aye, Sir, I dare ſay that may be—but
there is ſuch a thing as being un-married
again;—not that I ever heard, I am ſure, much
about the Captain; only Juſtina was laughing
one day, and laying, in her broken Engliſh—ſo
that I can't ſay I quite right underſtand
her—that if my Lord ſhould die, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſhould ever be able to get rid of his wife—ſhe
ſhould not be much ſurpriſed if he and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0206900204:143"/>
my Lady was to make a match of it; for that
never was ſuch a favourite as the Captain."</p>
            <p>"I ſhould not be much ſurpriſed at that
myſelf," anſwered Willoughby, "for I believe
the Captain <hi>has</hi> a good deal of intereſt there—ſo,
then, he has been trying to get rid of his
wife?"</p>
            <p>"Juſtina told me, Sir, one day, as a great
ſecret, that my Lord had helped him to money,
to try at it.—But, Sir, if Juſtina ſhould know
I ever mentioned it, I ſhould never be able to
get a word out of her again." "I promiſe
thee, ſhe never ſhall—ſo tell me, Farnham, all
thou haſt heard from her about Lady Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north
and the Captain."</p>
            <p>"Why, Sir, it was not much—but only
Juſtina was laughing t'other day about my
Lady's having ſuch a great friendſhip for him,
and there's no ſtopping her tongue when ſhe
begins—ſo ſhe told me—Lord, Sir! a great
many things that were odd enough to be ſure—but
only Ladies of quality, I reckon, don't
much care what people ſays of them.—She
ſaid, that my Lady knew well enough, that
my Lord could not hold it long—and that
ſhe was providing herſelf with a handſome
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0206900204:144"/>
young huſband, and making ſure of him, as
ſhe thought, before the old one hobbled off—but
let her take care, ſaid Juſtina, that ſhe
marries her daughter firſt, or I know what
will happen.—The Captain knows well
enough, that a young woman is better than
an old one; and beſides, that ſuch a great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
as my young lady will have, is better,
twenty to one, than her mother's jointure."</p>
            <p>This ſpeech at once opened Willoughby's
eyes, as to Lady Caſtlenorth's motives for the
extreme haſte and earneſtneſs ſhe had ſhewn
to conclude her daughter's marriage; feeling
as he did, in regard to Miſs Hayman, he was
ſenſible neither of jealouſy or mortification,
at the idea of any preference ſhe might enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
for Cavanaugh; but a hope, that, from this
circumſtance, ſomething might happen to
break off the connection for ever between him
and his couſin involuntarily aroſe in his mind.—In
any event, it ought to be attended to; he
bade Farnham therefore go the next day,
and ſee if he could ſet Juſtina goſſipping
again—"I have a notion, Farnham," ſaid he
"that you are very much in the good graces
of the little Neapolitan."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0206900204:145"/>
"Oh, no, Sir; finer fellows than I am have
all the chance there—and for my part, Sir, I
don't much fancy her, though ſhe is lively
and ſmart, and when I get her by herſelf will
tell the ſecrets of all the family."</p>
            <p>"Which thou loveſt to hear; therefore get
her by herſelf as ſoon as thou canſt, and make
her tell thee all ſhe knows."</p>
            <p>Willoughby then again tried to compoſe
himſelf—and by the help of the medicines he
had taken, obtained four or five hours ſleep.—He
was a great deal better in the morning;
as he breakfaſted, a note was brought him
from Lady Caſtlenorth, informing him that
his uncle had been ſeized in the night with a
violent return of that aſthmatic complaint
which ſo frequently had rendered his ſtay in
England impoſſible: that the ſpring, though
far advanced, was ſo cold and wet, that there
was no chance of his being better while he
remained there now; and that therefore he had,
by the advice of his phyſicians, and by his own
inclination, determined to ſet out that very
day for the continent. She added, "You
will come to us, of courſe, inſtantly, and if you
cannot go with us, ſettle when you will follow
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0206900204:146"/>
us; but your uncle wiſhes you to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
us."</p>
            <p>This intelligence was to Willoughby like
a reprieve from what to him was worſe than
death; ſince the longer he conſidered of his
marriage, the more diſhonourable now, and
the more certainly miſerable hereafter, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to him. He wrote an haſty note,
ſaying how ill he had been the whole night,
and how impoſſible he feared it would be for
him to ſee his uncle that day; but that, if his
phyſician, whom he every moment expected,
gave him leave to go out, he would certainly
wait upon him.</p>
            <p>This anſwer had not been diſpatched above
an hour, and his medical friend had juſt left
him, with a ſtrict injunction not to ſtir out
that day, when Lady Caſtlenorth and Mrs.
Calder entered his room.</p>
            <p>"So, my dear Sir," cried the former—"what
is to be done! Lord Caſtlenorth will
be wretched to leave you behind—and my
poor girl too!—What is this ſudden fever—you
really look ill—I cannot imagine what is
to be done—For my Lord to ſtay, he thinks
it death."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0206900204:147"/>
Willoughby muttered ſomething which he
meant ſhould expreſs concern at his uncle's
illneſs: but Mrs. Calder fortunately precluded
the neceſſity of his being very diſtinct in his
hypocriſy, by ſtepping up to him, and taking
his hand, "Come, come," ſaid ſhe, "let me
feel your pulſe." She then, gravely counting
its vibrations as ſhe held her ſtop-watch, ſaid,
"Why, really now, here is much leſs fever
than I expected from your appearance—let us
ſee your tongue.—Humph—'tis white to be
ſure—Where are your medicines—I ſhould
think, if you were well wrapped up and put
into a chair, you might go to your uncle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any danger—on ſuch an emergency, you
know, a little may be hazarded."</p>
            <p>"No," ſaid Lady Caſtlenorth, "by no
means; nothing muſt be hazarded—And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, my Lord may make himſelf eaſy, as I
dare ſay you will be able to overtake us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we get to Paris; where, if my Lord is
better, and finds that relief he generally does
from a change of air, we will ſtop till you
join us: I think you will be perfectly reſtored
in a week: but, however, I will go myſelf to
Dr. B—, and hear what he ſays."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0206900204:148"/>
"Oh, I can tell you," interrupted Mrs.
Calder, "that he'll be well, perfectly well, in
leſs than a week.—I have been taſting his
medicines, and underſtand clearly from them
what Dr. B—thinks of his fever—I was
a mere ephemeris—of that be aſſured.…"</p>
            <p>"Well," ſaid Lady Caſtlenorth, "my dear
Willoughby, what ſhall we ſay?"</p>
            <p>Willoughby was ready to anſwer—"No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, good Madam:" but ſighing from
a ſenſe of pain and reſtraint, he only replied,
"that he could only ſay that he was very
ſorry for his uncle's illneſs—and—"</p>
            <p>"That you will haſten after us?—that, I
think, I may venture to aſſure your uncle.—He
was ſettling this morning that you ſhould
be married in the Engliſh ambaſſador's chapel
at Paris; and I really don't ſee myſelf that,
upon the whole, theſe unlucky illneſſes of my
Lord's and of your's need impede the affair a
ſingle hour; all the difference will be, that
you will be married at Paris, inſtead of at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and we will paſs the reſt of the year in
Italy inſtead of Caſtlenorth."</p>
            <p>"But the dear young Lady," cried Mrs.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0206900204:149"/>
Calder, "our ſweet and lovely child, how
will ſhe bear even this tranſient ſeparation!"</p>
            <p>"Indeed, I don't know," ſaid Lady Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north,
affecting to be quite ſympathetic—"but
ſhe ſhall come, and bring the letter
my Lord will have directed to be written with
his laſt directions about the deeds and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages;
which our dear George muſt bring
with him: and" added ſhe, ſmiling, "I fancy,
upon the footing they are now, there will be
no great indecorum in her coming to his
lodgings."</p>
            <p>Willoughby found immediately his fever
returning, and that he ſhould have a terrible
headach: he put up his hand to his temples—"I am obliged to your Ladyſhip," ſaid he
in a languid voice; "and I wiſh this moſt
oppreſſive head-ach of mine would—"</p>
            <p>"What it aches now, does it?" ſaid Mrs.
Calder, "I wiſh Dr. B—was here, I am
ſure I could give him a hint or two on this
caſe which might be of uſe to him."</p>
            <p>"Let us go to him," interrupted Lady
Caſtlenorth, "and talk to him about this
ugly fever; and when we have found him, it
will be time to return to my Lord, and to ſend
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0206900204:150"/>
my daughter hither; for we think to ſleep at
Rocheſter to-night."</p>
            <p>Willoughby now bleſſing her for her haſte,
made his compliments in a low voice; and ſtill
complaining of his head—the Ladies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>They were no ſooner gone, than he tried to
diſcover by what means he might beſt avoid
receiving the favour of the viſit Lady Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north
had promiſed him from her daughter.
He was aſhamed of the part he was acting,
however ill and reluctantly he performed it.
For the firſt time in his life his conduct was
contrary to his ſenſe of honour, and, he was
conſcious, altogether unworthy of him; and
while he had thus betrayed himſelf, he was
become the dupe of Lady Caſtlenorth, and
perhaps was meant to be the dupe of Miſs
Fitz-Hayman and their mutual favourite.—His
pride, as well as his rectitude, revolted
from the idea of carrying on this odious farce,
which he now wondered what demon had
tempted him, in the moment of paſſion and
deſpair, to begin—and which he, however
late, thought he ſhould now act more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
in ending at once, than in ſuffering it
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0206900204:151"/>
it to proceed another day—He was, however,
by no means able to determine, at once, how
he ſhould do this; and what he had moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to conſider was, how he ſhould
eſcape the enquiry and adieu of the heireſs,
which he might now every moment expect.</p>
            <p>He at length determined to go to bed—and
ſending again for his phyſician, who was
very much his friend, acknowledged the truth
to him, and got an abſolute prohibition againſt
his ſeeing any body—He told Farnham,
therefore, that he again felt himſelf extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ill; and bade him immediately run for Dr.
B—. Fortunately he met him in the next
ſtreet; and in leſs than ten minutes he had
received Willoughby's confeſſion, that all his
illneſs, both before and ſince his return from
abroad, had been owing to diſtreſs of mind,
which he could now no longer hope would
abate, by the neceſſity he had thought of
putting himſelf under to conceal it—In ſhort,
he owned that his diſlike to Miſs Fitz-Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
as a wife, was unconquerable; and that
as he was determined at all events to break
the treaty off, however far it had gone, and
therefore entreated his friend to find ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0206900204:152"/>
for his evading an interview ſo uſeleſs and
ſo irkſome, when it was impoſſible for him to
continue acting a moment longer the part he
had ſo raſhly undertaken; and yet did not
mean, and eſpecially in the preſent condition
of his uncle's health, abruptly and rudely to
end it; but to ſoften, at leaſt to him, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment
which he had thus rendered
doubly heavy.</p>
            <p>Dr. B—entered at once into his meaning,—and,
ſmiling, ſaid, "It is a little unuſual,
my friend, for me to contrive an illneſs to
ſeparate a lady from her lover, though I have
been often aſked to make pretences for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them together.—However, the fact is,
that you really are unfit to entertain the lady,
for your fever is conſiderably increaſed ſince I
ſaw you in the morning; and we ſee very
plainly that any agitation is hazardous while
you continue in this irritable ſtate:—I will
therefore wait here and ſee Miſs Fitz-Hayman
myſelf; and ſo contrive as to bring you off
this time, and for the future you muſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it yourſelf."</p>
            <p>"I am ſure you deſpiſe me, Doctor,"—cried
Willoughby, "for the part I have acted
in this curſed affair."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:0206900204:153"/>
"No," anſwered he, "not exactly ſo—But
I own I think you wrong, inaſmuch as any
kind of diſſimulation is unworthy of you; and
above all, that which goes to rob a young
woman of her heart under falſe pretences."</p>
            <p>"But I hope I have not done that—for,
upon my honour, I ſhould never forgive my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
if I had."</p>
            <p>It looks very like it though, my friend,
from your own account of the matter—And
if it is ſo—</p>
            <p>"You think I ought, at all events, to
marry her?"</p>
            <p>"Indeed I do."</p>
            <p>"Alas, my dear Sir," ſaid Willoughby,
"it is ſurely better for me—even more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
to decline her hand now, than to
accept it and make her miſerable."</p>
            <p>"I don't believe you could make any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
miſerable," anſwered Dr. B—, "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you have good nature, honour, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity—but,
my dear Sir, I did not mean to
play the caſuiſt in ſuch an affair—and here—if
I am not miſtaken, is the lady herſelf at
the door."</p>
            <p>"Dear Doctor," cried Willoughby, "have
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0206900204:154"/>
the goodneſs to go down directly." He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
obeyed—and returning in a few
moments, ſaid, "Well, I have ſent away the
diſconſolate fair one—broken-hearted—for
fear of loſing her love."</p>
            <p>"Don't rally me, my friend,"—anſwered
Willoughby—"But, tell me, did my couſin
appear very much concerned?"</p>
            <p>"She endeavoured at leaſt to appear ſo."</p>
            <p>"Do you think then it was merely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour?"</p>
            <p>"Would you not be mortified, now, if I
ſaid it ſeemed ſo to me?"</p>
            <p>"No, upon my honour—I might perhaps
be mortified to find that I was believed to be
an eaſy ſubject of impoſition—but for the reſt—nothing
would be a greater relief to me, than to
be well aſſured that the partiality my couſin
ſhewed for me was either never real, or, having
been ſo, exiſts no longer."</p>
            <p>"I don't know her enough," replied Dr.
B—, "nor have I been long enough talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her now to be a very good judge.—The
honeſteſt of them, my friend, are not
eaſily underſtood—and I am much miſtaken
if your fair relation comes under that deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0206900204:155"/>
I mean, when I ſay honeſteſt—the moſt
candid—the moſt ſincere."</p>
            <p>"Well! but what do you judge, from her
behaviour juſt now, are Miſs Fitz-Hayman's
ſentiments towards me?"</p>
            <p>"She would have me believe, I think,
that they are thoſe of great attachment and
trembling apprehenſion for your health—But,
ſomehow, it was, I fancied, a ſort of concern
that had more ſtage effect for its object, than
real concern ever thinks about—and I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that if you <hi>do</hi> prove a perjured ſwain
after all, the heireſs of Caſtlenorth will not
add to the ſorrowful catalogue of damſels who
have died for love."</p>
            <p>Willoughby, glad to hear this, now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
promiſed a ready acquieſcence with his
friend's orders, which were to keep his mind
as quiet as he could, and to ſee nobody till
he had quite conquered his remaining indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;
and the Doctor then took his leave.</p>
            <p>In leſs than two hours, a large pacquet came
to him from Lord Caſtlenorth—which Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
ſent word down to the man who
brought it, that he was then too ill to open—On
Farnham's delivering this meſſage, the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0206900204:156"/>
ſervant ſaid, that no anſwer then was requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for that his lord and lady, their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Mrs. Calder, and Captain Cavanaugh,
had all departed, with the ſervants who were
immediately about them, the very moment he
came away, and were then, in two poſt coaches
and four, on their way to Rocheſter.</p>
            <p>Willoughby felt for a moment as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by this intelligence, as if half his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
had been removed by their departure.—Too
ſoon, however, this temporary reſpite
ended, by his recollecting how much he muſt
yet encounter before he could feel himſelf
free; and that whatever freedom he might
regain, Celeſtina would be another's.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="7" type="chapter">
            <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0206900204:157"/>
            <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
            <p>IN the mean time Celeſtina was alone at
Cheltenham, indulging that regret which
aroſe from the certain loſs of Willoughby's
friendſhip, and the aſſurance that ſhe ſhould
ſee him no more.—Every day ſhe expected to
ſee in the newſpapers, or to hear from Lady
Horatia, that he was married—and though
ſhe tried to reaſon herſelf into a calm acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence
with what was unavoidable, ſhe never
opened a paper or a letter without trembling.</p>
            <p>But her own unhappineſs prevented her not
from feeling for the unhappineſs of her friends.
The letter ſhe had received from Emily Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart
had made a great impreſſion upon her—though
ſhe knew not how it would be proper
to act to anſwer the views of the writer.—At
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0206900204:158"/>
length ſhe determined to write to Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone,
and encloſe the letter itſelf—and
this ſhe did a few days after ſhe was ſettled at
Cheltenham.</p>
            <p>Almoſt every poſt brought her accounts of
the amendment of Montague Thorold, from
Lady Horatia, who viſited him conſtantly—and
in almoſt every letter ſhe expreſſed, either
plainly or by implication, her expectations
that Celeſtina would attend to the wiſhes of
all her friends, and give him her hand imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
on his recovery.—This repeated im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
from a perſon to whoſe wiſhes,
and for whoſe opinion ſhe felt ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to be due, was infinitely painful to
her; but how to eſcape from it ſhe knew
not.—If ſhe quitted Lady Horatia ſhe had
no proper protection—no home to receive
her—and though her little income had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
more than ſufficed to ſupport her
while with ſuch a friend, and though ſhe had
received about an hundred pounds from
Cathcart, paid her by the direction of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
while he was abroad, which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
almoſt untouched, yet on ſuch a ſum,
and on the intereſt of fifteen hundred pounds,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0206900204:159"/>
ſhe could not with any degree of prudence
adopt the plan on which her imagination had
lately dwelt with peculiar pleaſure—that of
ſetting out alone, or with only a female ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and travelling through France. She
fancied that there ſhe might be enabled,
though ſhe had yet no clue to guide her, to
find ſome traces of her family.—An invincible
inclination, which ſhe ſometimes took for the
inſpiration of heaven, had been for ſome weeks
gaining on her imagination—and every thing
ſeemed to encourage it; but reaſon and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
both of which were perhaps decidedly
in favour of her accepting the proper eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
offered her, by a man who had
not only given ſo many proofs of his ſincere
and tender affection for her, but who was
the ſon of one of her beſt friends, and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
recommended to her by another—a man
too whom ſhe preferred to every other perſon
except Willoughby, and whom ſhe would
have choſen had Willoughby never been in
queſtion.</p>
            <p>For her it was very certain that he was in
queſtion no longer; he was in fact dead to
her—and no probability remained of his ever
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0206900204:160"/>
feeling for her even the regret that the loſs of
an agreeable acquaintance might have given
him.—But ſtill her heart and her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had been ſo long accuſtomed to conſider
him as their firſt object, that ſhe found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for her to transfer to another the
ſame attachment; and without being ſenſible
of love ſhe could not promiſe it—ſhe deſired
nothing but to be permitted to live ſingle;
and be miſtreſs of her time and herſelf—and
not to be importuned to undertake duties
which her heart told her ſhe could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly
fulfil.</p>
            <p>But ſhe foreſaw too evidently, that while
ſhe remained in her preſent ſituation, and
Lady Horatia continued ſo eager for the
match, her life muſt paſs in a continual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
between her wiſh to gratify her friend,
and her diſinclination to marriage. At her
time of life, profeſſions of a reſolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
ſingle were merely laughed at, and
never believed; and Montague Thorold had
never hitherto conſidered her gentle refuſals
and friendly admonitions to deſiſt, but as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in reality as much encouragement as ſhe
could give him, while her ſituation in regard
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0206900204:161"/>
to Willoughby remained ſoaukwardly undecid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—that
while he might renounce the name
of lover, he might ſtill aſſume that of a near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and have the power of controuling, or
at leaſt of directing her.</p>
            <p>Now that it was decided, beyond a doubt,
that he neither meant to avail himſelf of either
the one or the other, ſhe ſaw that ſhe had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to urge in ſupport of her refuſal which
would be liſtened to; and while her mind
dwelt on all the friendly but ſtill irkſome
controverſy in which ſhe muſt of neceſſity be
engaged when Lady Horatia and Thorold
came down, it of courſe adverted to the means
of relief, which could, ſhe thought, be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only by her quitting England—and for
her doing ſo, her natural deſire to diſcover
her parents was, ſhe thought, a ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</p>
            <p>In her preſent ſolitude ſhe found ſo much to
ſoothe and conſole her, that ſhe longed for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo much as the power of enjoying it, and
at the ſame time wandering through various
countries, and particularly through that which
ſhe had been taught to conſider as her own. The
longer ſhe thought of this plan, the more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0206900204:162"/>
it became to her imagination; and ſhe
paſſed many hours every day in reading travels
through France, Italy, and Switzerland, ſtill
humouring this viſionary idea till it had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the force of a <hi>preſentiment;</hi> a perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that could ſhe go to the South of France
ſhe ſhould find her family.</p>
            <p>Of this ſhe continually thought: of this ſhe
continually dreamed; and though one great
motive that would haveurged her to attempt it,
the poſſibility of being reſtored to Willoughby,
was at an end, ſhe ſtill determined to execute
this plan before the ſummer elapſed.</p>
            <p>She had indeed nothing but her gratitude
and attachment to Lady Horatia to detain
her in England—ſhe could not go to Jeſſy,
becauſe it was ſo near Alveſtone; nor enjoy
the friendly and inſtructive converſation of
Mr. Thorold, becauſe of the unfortunate par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
of his ſon.—The ſole remaining friend
of her childhood, Lady Molyneux, was not
merely eſtranged from her, but had invariably
treated her with negligence, ſcorn, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.—To
England therefore ſhe had at leaſt
no friends who attached her—the whole world
was her country; and with that reſtleſſneſs
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0206900204:163"/>
to which the unhappy are ſubject, ſhe fancied
that in any part of it ſhe ſhould find more
ſatisfaction than in her preſent ſituation.</p>
            <p>By her wandering continually alone in the
pleaſant country that ſurrounded the town
where ſhe reſided, at a ſeaſon too when the
face of nature was every day growing more
lovely, her talent for poetry, which ſometimes
remained for whole months unexerciſed, was
again called forth; but whatever were the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
really before her, whatever were preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to her mind by books, Willoughby was
ever the principal figure in the landſcape.—If

hours together, loſt in mournful yet not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
reverie, it was only to recollect ſcenes
that were paſſed; which the ſame ſounds ſhe
had then heard, the ſimple ſheep-bell, the
early ſong of birds; the ſame ſcents of freſh
turf and wild flowers, brought again moſt
forcibly to her recollection.</p>
            <p>If in her reading, ſhe was by the traveller's
lively deſcription of the countries he had

felt could ſhe in a progreſs through ſuch ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic
ſcenes have been the companion of
Willoughby; and it was in this diſpoſition of
mind, that after peruſing an account of a
cottage and its inhabitants overwhelmed by
the fall of an avalanche, a great body of ſnow
from the mountain above, ſhe compoſed the
following little lyric poem.</p>

            <p>While Celeſtina was thus, with more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
than diſcretion, cheriſhing the memory
of the friend ſhe had loſt, Willoughby was
very differently occupied from what her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
ſuggeſted.—Inſtead of being the gay
and fortunate lover, on the eve of marrying
one of the greateſt heireſſes in England, he
was ſuffering in his perſonal health, from the
anxiety of a mind at war with itſelf—and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of nothing but that for him the world no
longer contained any happineſs.—The intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
however vague, and like the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
goſſipping ſtories ſo uſual among ſervants,
that he had received from Farnham, had made
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0206900204:167"/>
a great impreſſion, which what he afterwards
gathered from the ſame quarter had increaſed.
Juſtina had told Farnham, as a ſecret however
of the firſt importance, that Captain Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naugh
had been of late in the habit of being
admitted to her young lady's dreſſing-room
after Lady Caſtlenorth and the family were
retired, however late the hour might be—that
her young lady was obliged to entruſt
her with theſe viſits, that they might be more
ſecurely concealed from the reſt of the family;
but that ſometimes ſhe had been diſmiſſed to
bed, and ſometimes ordered to wait till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.—That
on ſome of thoſe occaſions ſhe
obſerved her young lady had been crying, by
the redneſs of her eyes; and that then the
Captain had always left her with the air of a
man much offended.—That ſhe had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
heard them talk in voices as if they
were arguing upon ſomething, but could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
diſtinctly underſtand what their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was about.—"They were in ſad fright
always," ſaid Juſtina, "that Miladi hear
them.—Miladi knows not at all what goes on
in this houſe."—"And my lady, I ſuppoſe,"
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0206900204:168"/>
ſaid Farnham, "would be in a horrible paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
if ſhe heard of it?" "Oh, for me," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
ſhe, "I could not ſtay if ſhe did find
it out."—"But why," enquired Farnham,
"why, if your young lady likes the Captain
ſo as to have him keep company with her in
this manner, what does ſhe mean by marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my maſter?" Juſtina then, with an arch
look, anſwered, "Oh, my good friend, the
Captain has one wife already; and why ſhould
not my young lady have one huſband?—The
Captain will be her Ceciſbeo—cavalier
ſervante."—"I don't underſtand your French
out-of-the-way names," replied Farnham;
"but I am ſure, that if your lady marries
my maſter only to play ſuch pranks as ſome
other fine ladies do, ſhe will get into a bad
ſcrape—for he is not a man to be quiet when
ſuch fort of doings are a-going on, that I can
tell her—and if ſhe don't love him better than
any other man, I think ſhe had much better
ſay ſo."—"Oh, ſilly man,"—anſwered Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina—"as
if my young lady could not have
a regard for both of them!"—"Aye, aye,"
replied Farnham, "that may do well enough
in your country—but it will never do here."—
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0206900204:169"/>
Juſtina now, afraid that Farnham's zeal for
his maſter would perhaps urge him to reveal
the dangerous ſecret with which ſhe had thus
entruſted him, began to ſoften the harſheſt
features of it; by ſaying, that ſhe believed
there was no harm at all in the friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her young lady and Captain Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naugh—that
to be ſure, the Captain was a
ſweet handſome man, and very agreeable—and
therefore her young lady liked to talk with
him, which ſhe never could do when her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was by; as ſhe never ſuffered him to
ſpeak hardly to any body elſe—and that it
was natural enough for her lady to like the
Captain, and have a regard for him, becauſe
ſhe had known him ſo long.—She ended her
converſation with exacting from Farnham a
promiſe that he would never mention a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
to any body of what ſhe had told him;
a promiſe which he kept, however, only till
he could reveal it all to his maſter.</p>
            <p>Willoughby had, after receiving this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
no longer a doubt as to breaking
off inſtantly his propoſed alliance; but how,
without plunging a dagger in the heart of his
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0206900204:170"/>
uncle, to do this, required ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Lord
Caſtlenorth had ſent him full di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
as to paying off all the incumbrances
upon his eſtate, and depoſited the money at
a banker's, where he had alſo left a large ſum
for his own uſe; and expecting him to join
the family at Paris, if he did not overtake
them ſooner; and was now pleaſing himſelf
with the idea, that in a very few days the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
project of his life would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted;
and that in adopting the ſon of his
ſiſter, and uniting him with his daughter, he
ſhould tranſmit his name and his honours to
poſterity with little variation from lineal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent—It
was this hope, that ſeemed to have
ſuſtained his feeble exiſtence to its preſent pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
in ſpite of the numerous infirmities he
laboured under, and even of the preſcriptions
and nurſing of Mrs. Calder—And though it
was impoſſible for Willoughby either to love
or eſteem ſuch a man as Lord Caſtlenorth,
yet he felt for him ſome regard, as his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
brother, and ſome pity not only for his
real but his imaginary ſufferings, which he
knew muſt be dreadfully increaſed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0206900204:171"/>
become fatal, from ſo heavy a diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of all his expectations.</p>
            <p>He heſitated, then, how to act; whether to
write or go to him—or whether he ſhould not
rather addreſs himſelf to Lady Caſtlenorth or
her daughter; and for two days after their
departure, had been unable to reſolve on any
thing, when a porter, who immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared,
gave to the ſervant of the houſe a
letter for him.—It was evidently written in a
foreign hand, and in a foreign idiom—though
pains ſeemed to have been taken to diſguiſe
both—The contents were theſe:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>One who is and will be always a ſtranger
to you, takes the liberty to approach you
with this advice ſo important to you—and
fearing it may be ſoon too late—</p>
                  <p>You are, Sir, on the point of being
married, as the report goes, to the daughter
of Lord Caſtlenorth, Miſs Fitz-Hayman,
your relation—I have cauſe to know that her
heart is belonging to another perſon, and only
chagrin and inquietude will be the effect, if
you execute this marriage, whatever may have
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0206900204:172"/>
ſeemed to the contrary.—If there is any doubt
of the truth of this, a little obſervation, or
making enquiry among thoſe near her, will
explain what I would ſay: and if there is
queſtion of the perſon ſhe has a great friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
for, you have only to think of thoſe
who are always with her. A word they ſay
to the wiſe is enough for them to underſtand—I
have the honour to be,</p>
                  <closer>With profound reſpect,
<salute>Sir,</salute>

            </floatingText>
            <p>Willoughby had no ſooner read this letter,
than it ſtruck him that it was written, either
by Cavanaugh himſelf, or by ſome perſon
employed by him—and his motive evidently
was to prevent a marriage he now ſaw ſo
nearly concluded, and which would deſtroy
all his hopes of ſecuring to himſelf this opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
heireſs—rather than her mother, whoſe
laviſh fondneſs for him had enabled him—by
ſome means or other—it was probable they
were not very juſtifiable means, to releaſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0206900204:173"/>
himſelf from his former engagements—en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
which, with far other views, ſhe had
aſſiſted him to diſſolve.</p>
            <p>Many concurring circumſtances ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
the perſuaſion that this letter was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricated,
if not written, by Cavanaugh.—It
ſeemed to be the tranſlation of a letter firſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in French, and Willoughby heard that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanaugh
could not write Engliſh with facility
from long diſuſe.—It was certainly Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naugh's
intereſt, by any means, to ſtop the
marriage between him and Miſs Fitz-Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which perhaps no means could have
done more effectually; ſince from the tears
ſhe had frequently been obſerved by Juſtina
to ſhed in their long conferences, it was
probable his arguments had failed of their
effect.</p>
            <p>If Willoughby had before felt ſomething
like antipathy towards Miſs Fitz-Hayman,
which he never could wholly conquer, he
now found it amounting to abhorrence and
deteſtation.—The love ſhe had ſhewn towards
him muſt either have been the effect of art or
of vice—and both were to him equally odious.
That ſhe could hope to impoſe upon him by
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0206900204:174"/>
the one, or think him a proper object for the
indulgence of the other, were ideas equally
hateful and equally humiliating; and under
the firſt impulſe of indignation, he was tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to write to her, and, incloſing the letter
from his anonymous correſpondent, add to it
all the circumſtances Farnham had learned of
Juſtina, as reaſons why he renounced her with
contempt.</p>
            <p>But after a little reflection, his manly and
generous ſpirit inſpired him with far other
deſigns.—It was poſſible, that his couſin,
whom he now conſidered with as much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
but with more compaſſion, might yet
be ſaved from the artifices of a villain—and
he thought himſelf bound to attempt it by
every exertion, except the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in marriage. It was poſſible that his
uncle, though he could not make that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to gratify him, might yet be in ſome
degree preſerved from the dreadful ſhock
which his daughter's conduct muſt give him,
were it deſcribed to him in the horrid light he
himſelf now ſaw it in; or revealed to him by
any one leſs cautious than himſelf. Diſtreſſing,
therefore, as the ſcenes muſt be that he ſhould
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0206900204:175"/>
have to go through, when, inſtead of joining
the family, to complete his marriage, he ſhould
meet them with thoſe charges which put an
end to it for ever; he determined to follow
them immediately; and writing to Cathcart
ſuch inſtructions as were moſt requiſite, as to
the management of his affairs, and without
hinting how different the purpoſe of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was from what it was ſuppoſed to be,
he departed as ſoon as his phyſician diſmiſſed
him, for the Continent; which was in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than a week after the Caſtlenorths
had left London.</p>
            <p>Every body concluded that he was gone to
his bride; and every body's conjectures remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
uncontradicted—Lady Horatia, in her letters
to Celeſtina, told her that Lord Caſtlenorth's
illneſs having obliged him to quit England,
on a very ſhort notice, Willoughby and Miſs
Fitz—Hayman had been privately warned the
day before they ſet out; that ſome buſineſs,
as to his eſtates, detained him afterwards five
or ſix days in London; but that he was now
gone to the Caſtlenorth family at Paris, and
was to proceed with them to paſs the ſummer in
Italy. The ſame account found its way into the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0206900204:176"/>
public prints, and was received without any
doubt.—Celeſtina ſhed many tears over the
firſt information ſhe received, and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
herſelf of folly, tried to dry them, and
to detach her mind from thinking of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby—but
this no effort enabled her to
do; and though all anxiety was now loſt in
the moſt painful certainty, ſhe ſunk from
fruitleſs ſolicitude into hopeleſs dejection.</p>
            <p>In ſuch a frame of mind Lady Horatia
found her—when after a ſeparation of about
three weeks, ſhe rejoined her at Cheltenham.
With her arrived Montague Thorold, quite
recovered of his wound, deriving from it,
and from thus being allowed to attend Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
more hope than ever; while his love
ſeemed to have increaſed, if to increaſe
were poſſible; and while his ſufferings and
his merit certainly rendered him intereſting
to Celeſtina, and combined to entitle him
to her friendſhip, her pity, and eſteem;
ſhe felt, and felt with regret, that, decided
as ſhe believed her fate now to be in regard
to Willoughby—friendſhip, eſteem, and pity,
were yet all ſhe could give to Montague Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold.</p>

            <p>WlLLOUGHBY, with every ſenſation that
could render ſuch a journey unpleaſant, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to Paris, where he learned that his
uncle impatiently waited for him;—had he
gone immediately to him, he muſt have
cruſh'd at once, all the expectations his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
raifed: and the ſhock muſt have been
too great and too cruel. He determined at
firſt, therefore, to write to Lady Caſtlenorth—yet
after ſome reflection, doubted whether it
would not be better to give the letter he had
received to Miſs Fitz-Hayman; and leave it
to her to find the means of diſmiſſing him,
without his being compelled to aſſign the true
reaſon. It was ſtill poſſible that the charges
againſt her might be unfounded or exaggerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0206900204:178"/>
It is poſſible, that were they neither, he
might reſcue her from the abyſs to which ſhe
ſeemeed to be devoting herſelf.—But, from
the pride and violence of her temper, and
from that imperious ſpirit, which had never
yet borne to be told of an error, he not only
felt great uneaſineſs from the idea of the ſcene
that was before him, but doubted whether
the perſon for whoſe ſake he was willing to
encounter it, would not baffle all his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to reſcue her from evil, or conceal her
errors by clamour and reſentment.</p>
            <p>After ſome deliberation, however, as it was
neceſſary to fix on ſomething, he wrote a ſhort
note to Miſs Fitz-Hayman, deſiring ſhe would
favour him with a few moments converſation;
and entreating her, for reaſons which he would
then explain to her, not to inform Lord or
Lady Caſtlenorth of his arrival at Paris, till
after he had ſeen her.</p>
            <p>This note he ſent by Farnham to Juſtina,
to be delivered to her miſtreſs; and received
in a ſhort time an anſwer, that ſhe ſhould be
alone that evening at ten o'clock, and that
Juſtina ſhould conduct him to her, in her own
dreſſing room.</p>
            <p>

He found, her ſitting alone; and, under
the appearance of receiving him with pleaſure,
there was, he thought, a lurking apprehenſion
of the occaſion of this myſterious viſit.—He
felt himſelf extremely diſtreſſed how to open
ſuch a converſation; but the conſciouſneſs of
rectitude, and ſome degree of indignant reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
immediately reſtored that calmneſs and
reſolution, which on his firſt entrance he feared
he might fail of commanding.</p>
            <p>He began by apologizing for the liberty he
had taken in thus ſoliciting an interview with
her, before he ſaw the other parts of the
family. "But, I am perſuaded, Madam," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he, advancing towards her, with the
letter open in his hand, "that whatever
foundation there may befor the aſſertion which
this letter contains, it will be leſs uneaſy to
you to read it yourſelf—than to have any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
made on it to Lord and Lady Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north."—She
took the letter with an air of
mingled aſtoniſhment and indignation; but
Willoughby ſaw it tremble in her hand—"a
letter, Sir, in which mention is made of me!—I
am really quite at a loſs to know what
there can be in it, that I ſhould, in your
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0206900204:180"/>
opinion, wiſh to have it concealed"—"It is not
long, Madam," ſaid Willoughby, fixing his
eyes on her face; "and if you will have the
goodneſs to read it"—"Oh, certainly, Sir"—She
ran her eyes over it, and as he atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
watched her countenance, he ſaw pride
ſtruggling to conquer fear and ſhame, and
with ſome degree of ſucceſs; for having read
it, ſhe pauſed a moment, and then aſſuming
an air of haughty reſentment, ſhe threw the
letter on the table that was between her and
Willoughby—and ſaid, contemptuouſly, "I
know not whether moſt to deſpiſe, the Author
of ſuch a letter, or the man who—if indeed
he is not included in both deſcriptions—can
poorly make it a pretence for inſulting a
perſon, who has already been too much his
victim."—"Pardon me, Madam," ſaid Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
"for interrupting you; but I muſt
take leave to ſay, that I am included in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—a
moment's reflection will convince you
that I am incapable of the latter; and had the
former been my object, I ſhould not have
choſen this method of ſhewing this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
billet to you; nor thus put it in your
power to detect the author, without any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0206900204:181"/>
to yourſelf of having his charges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
Miſs Fitz-Hayman, I will be very
ingenuous with you:—the perſon here alluded
to, is Captain Cavanaugh—I know it: I know
that the partiality, whether real or affected,
with which you have appeared to favor me,
has been ſuperſeded by his more eminent merit;
and, though I am very willing to relinquiſh all
proſpect of an honor of which I am unworthy,—I
cannot feel much ſatisfaction, in reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the idea you ſeemed to have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
of my facility or blindneſs;—nor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
can I, without regret, ſee you likely
to—"</p>
            <p>"Say, rather, Sir," interrupted Miſs Fitz-Hayman—"Say,
rather, that you rejoice in
having found, or made, an excuſe to break
through the promiſes you have given—from
which, however, Sir, you would have been
releaſed without degrading yourſelf, by this
poor and unmanly artifice.—The daughter of
Lord Caſtlenorth need not, ſurely, ſolicit the
hand of any man." Pride and anger now choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her utterance; and Willoughby, taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of her want of words, again ſeized the
opportunity to ſpeak; he took her hand
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0206900204:182"/>
which ſhe would have ſnatched from him,
but he continued to detain it, while, in the
gentleſt accents of friendly remonſtrance, he
ſaid, "Come, come, my dear couſin—if I
am not your lover—at leaſt, I can never be
your enemy.—For Heaven's ſake, be not your
own; confide in me, and believe that I will
rather take the blame and inconvenience of
our ſeparation on myſelf, than ſuffer you to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
either with your father—you cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
I truſt you do not even wiſh, I ſhould
proceed farther in forming the alliance that
brought me hither, knowing what I know."</p>
            <p>"And what do you know, Sir; and from
whom have you obtained this knowledge."</p>
            <p>"From ſources, which render it impoſſible
that I ſhould be miſtaken—Captain Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naugh."</p>
            <p>He was proceeding; but, either from the
tone in which he ſpoke, or ſome other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
which at that moment ſtruck her, ſhe
was ſuddenly impreſſed with a fear that he had
been calling Cavanaugh himſelf to an account;
who, as it happened, had not that day dined
with them.—This idea threw her inſtantly
off her guard—ſhe turned pale, and aſked in
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0206900204:183"/>
an altered and tremulous tone—"what he
meant by theſe ſources of information?"</p>
            <p>Willoughby ſaw immediately what ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;
and the truth of the information he
had received from Juſtina was evident beyond
a doubt. Her fears for her own reputation,
or of the anger of her father, ſhe could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer;
but the moment ſhe apprehended that
the life of Cavanaugh either had been, or
might be hazarded, her fortitude failed her.
It was now the moment to purſue the truth,
which Willoughby, by ſoothing her, while he
kept the idea of her lover's danger in view,
at length, with great difficulty, obtained, by
her half indignant, half contrite avowal—that
Cavanaugh had been a too ſucceſsful candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
for her heart—and that her father and
her mother's eager wiſhes, together with ſome
other motives, which Willoughby diſcerned,
through the confuſion and agitation with
which ſhe attempted to palliate or conceal
them, had prompted her to affect for him a
paſſion ſhe had not felt ſince ſhe had been in
the habits of liſtening to Cavanaugh.</p>
            <p>Willoughby looked back with terror to the
danger he had eſcaped—and with infinite pity,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0206900204:184"/>
mingled with leſs gentle emotions, caſt his eyes
again on his couſin; he found her ſo deeply
entangled by the art of Cavanaugh, that to
ſave her from him, was no longer in his
power; but it was poſſible perhaps to take
upon himſelf the anger and indignation of
Lord and Lady Caſtlenorth, and give her time
to arrange her own plans, by immediately
withdrawing in ſilence; though, how any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
arrangement could be made for her,
with a man who was underſtood to be already
married, he knew not; nor how Lady Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north
would bear ſo cruel a blow, as the
preference thus given to her daughter by a
man whom ſhe certainly had intended as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
to her preſent huſband, whenever his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
ſhould releaſe her. When the firſt
tumult of thoſe paſſions, which fear, ſhame,
and love, had excited in the boſom of Miſs
Fitz-Hayman, ſubſided, by the kind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate
arguments of Willoughby, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
able to talk with ſome degree of calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
on the ſubject; and he found that from
the laſt renewal of their acquaintance with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Cavanaugh, this deſign had been certainly
entertained by Lady Caſtlenorth; but that, on
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0206900204:185"/>
his part, no other advantage had been taken
of her extreme partiality towards him, than
to obtain, by her means, money to enable
him to proſecute a divorce from his wife—a
young woman whom he had married ſome
years before for the ſake of ſome fortune, and
a great deal of beauty, which ſhe then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed.—Having
in two or three years diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
the former, he left her to make what
advantage ſhe could of the latter; and had
never troubled himſelf about her ſince, till
his reception in the family of Lord Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north
opened to him proſpects of carrying off
the rich heireſs—and made him deſirous of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a diſſolution of his marriage, for which
his wife's ill conduct, though entirely owing
to his deſertion of her, gave him a very
good pretence. Much of this Willoughby
learned from various little circumſtances
which eſcaped Miſs Fitz-Hayman in this
long converſation; for her repreſentation of
him was, that of the moſt amiable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
of men; married early in life to a
woman inſenſible of his merit; and now ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
unhappy by a paſſion for another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
whom he had long ſeen on the point of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0206900204:186"/>
being given to a rival, who ſaw her with very
different eyes.</p>
            <p>Willoughby could not, without aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
obſerve the blind infatuation of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
poſſeſſed of rather a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
but he found that the art of Cavanaugh,
to the ſucceſs of which his very handſome
figure had undoubtedly contributed, had ſo
completely attained the government of Miſs
Fitz-Hayman's mind, that ſhe no longer ſaw
but with his eyes; and that while, to prevent
any ſuſpicion on the part of her mother, ſhe
had been ſuffered to affect a degree of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Willoughby, which had long ſince
ceaſed—Cavanaugh truſted to his reluctance
to delay a marriage, which it was eaſy to ſee he
dreaded; and hoped that the divorce would be
obtained before that reluctance would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered—he
found, however, that Willoughby
ſuddenly agreed to haſten it; and then it was
that, in his conference with her, after the reſt of
the family were in bed, he urged her to find
delays; and to procraſtinate, herſelf, a period,
to the arrival of which Willoughby no longer
ſeemed averſe.—Her tears, and the alarm in
which Juſtina had obſerved her, were the effects
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0206900204:187"/>
of the earneſtneſs and impetuoſity with which
Cavanaugh now preſſed the neceſſity of her
doing this; and the alternative he ſometimes
offered her, of declaring to Willoughby him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
the footing upon which he was with her.—Her
father's illneſs, fortunately for her, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened;
and now Cavanaugh was every hour in
hopes that he ſhould be ſet free from his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial
engagements—and poſſeſs himſelf
of the prize ſo long the object of his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the end of all his deſigns.</p>
            <p>Miſs Fitz-Hayman and Willoughby now
were to diſcuſs the means by which, with
the leaſt prejudice to her, their intended
union could then be broken off.—The lady,
though ſhe did not ingenuouſly own it, had
many reaſons for accepting, unconditionally,
her couſin's generous offer, to take the whole
burthen of their diſpleaſure upon himſelf.—She
knew, hot only the extravagant and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
paſſions which any ſuſpicion of its real
cauſe would excite in her mother, but ſhe
was aware of the increaſing fondneſs of her
father for his nephew; and apprehended,
that if he appeared the injured and forſaken
perſon, that fondneſs might urge him to make
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0206900204:188"/>
him amends, by giving him a part of the
great ſums and eſtates that were in his own
power—and this, rich as ſhe would ſtill have
been, ſhe had not any diſpoſition to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.</p>
            <p>After ſome debate, then, in what way
Willoughby ſhould excuſe himſelf, and his
rejection (on account of their falſehood) of
ſome method which Miſs Fitz-Hayman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
he at length determined to write to
Lady Caſtlenorth, ſtating ſimply, that he
had changed his mind, and found it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to fulfil his engagements: and leave it to
her to break it to her Lord as ſhe thought
proper; for he imagined any letter from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
might be a ſtill ſeverer ſhock, unleſs he
could aſſign better reaſons than any it was
poſſible for him to offer.</p>
            <p>This point being ſettled, Miſs Fitz-Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
retired to recover herſelf from the effects
of the ſcene ſhe had paſſed through; and to
ſtudy her part in thoſe that were to come.—Willoughby
returned, unſeen by all but Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,
to his hotel; where he compoſed a ſhort
note to the purport they had agreed Upon;
and early the next morning he ſet out on
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0206900204:189"/>
horſeback for Lyons, from whence he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to proceed, along the coaſt of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,
to the Pyrenees, and to paſs ſome
weeks among thoſe mountains which he had
never yet ſeen.</p>
            <p>The recent and extraordinary events that
had befallen him, gave his mind ſufficient
ſubject for contemplation, during the firſt
part of his journey.—It was now very certain
that he was for ever releaſed, and that by
means which left him nothing to reproach
himſelf with, from his engagements with Miſs
Fitz-Hayman, and of courſe from that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to his mother, in conſequence of which
thoſe engagements were made.—One great
objection, then, to his union with Celeſtina
was thus removed; and never did her image
more tenderly occupy his thoughts than at
this moment: but, alas! it was no longer
cheriſhed with delight. The myſtery that
clouded her birth, and which he deſpaired of
ever removing, empoiſoned the pleaſure with
which he would have thought of her; and
with yet greater bitterneſs, he adverted to the
probability there was that ſhe was now the
wife of another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0206900204:190"/>
Very certain that he ſhould now never find
that happineſs of which her loſs had deprived
him, the leſſer evils—evils from which, a few
years before, he would have ſhrunk with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may,
ſeemed to have loſt their effect.—It was
almoſt impoſſible for him, without injuſtice
to others and uneaſineſs to himſelf, to keep ſuch
a place as Alveſtone, in the preſent ſhattered
ſtate of his fortune; and reſolving to diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs
himſelf from the neceſſity of returning
to England, for ſome years, he wrote from
Lyons, to Cathcart, giving him directions to
put the eſtate to ſale: and at the ſame time
informed the banker, in whoſe hands Lord
Caſtlenorth had left money for the diſcharge
of all his incumbrances, that he ſhould not
avail himſelf of it; but that it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
to his uncle's account.</p>
            <p>Having thus looſened almoſt every tie that
connected him with England, from which he
did not wiſh even to hear, left the inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of Celeſtina's marriage ſhould reach
him,
<q>The World was all before him where to chuſe;</q>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0206900204:191"/>
and his utmoſt hope was, to obtain, by change
of place, ſo much tranquillity of mind, as to
allow him to feel ſome ſatisfaction in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of the ſcenes it offered.</p>
            <p>He journeyed from Lyons to Avignon;
and then proceeded along the coaſt, by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zieres
and Mirepoix, into Rouſſillon: intereſted
by the grandeur and beauty of theſe remains
of Roman antiquity which he ſaw in his way;
ſtill more charmed by the ſublime views,
which, in this romantic line of country, every
where offered themſelves to his ſight; and
hearing, and <hi>but</hi> hearing, at a diſtance, the
tumults, with which a noble ſtruggle for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
at this time (the ſummer of 1789) agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
the capital, and many of the great
towns of France, till, among the wild and
ſtupendous ſcenes which he at length reached,
even this faint murmur died away.</p>
            <p>In one of the cottages ſcattered at the foot
of Montlouis, he found a young mountaineer,
acquainted with all the paſſes of the Pyrenees:
he was there only for a few days, on his way
back from Perpignan to his home, in the
Vallei de Douron; and on Willoughby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0206900204:192"/>
it to him, he moſt willingly undertook
to be his guide through the mountains.</p>
            <p>Willoughby had left his horſes at Perpig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,
and his preſent equipage conſiſted only
of Farnham, carrying a light portmanteau,
and a ſort of havreſac for proviſions, which
he took himſelf, ſtrapped over his ſhoulders.</p>
            <p>On the morning of his departure from the
foot of Montlouis, he travelled towards the
ſouth-eaſt, always aſcending, and was ſoon
in the very heart of the Pyrenees. In ſcenes
which had hardly ever been traverſed but by
the ſhepherds and goat-herds, and where no
veſtiges of man were ſeen, but here and there
a ſolitary cabin, ſerving them for ſhelter,
during a few weeks of ſummer, built of the
rough branches of pine or cheſnut, covered
with turf, and lined with moſs.—In theſe huts,
which were now ſome of them inhabited,
Willoughby found a wild, but ſimple and
benevolent people; always ready to ſupply
him with ſuch food as their flocks, among
thoſe deſert regions, afforded to themſelves;
and in one of them, on a temporary bed,
made of the ſkins of their ſheep, whom acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
had deſtroyed, after a deep ſigh, which
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0206900204:193"/>
was drawn from him by the memory of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
and with which every day concluded,
he obtained a few hours of refreſhing ſleep,
and with the dawn of the next day purſued
his journey towards the ſummit of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>Amid theſe paths that wound among the
almoſt perpendicular points of the cliffs, he
often ſat down; ſurveying with awe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
the ſtupendous works of the Divine
Architect, before whoſe ſimpleſt creation, the
laboured productions of the moſt intelligent
of his, creatures ſink into inſignificance.—Huge
maſſes of grey marble, or a dark gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
frowned above his head; whoſe crevices,
here and there, afforded a ſcanty ſubſiſtence
to lickens and moſs campion; while the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
barrenneſs of other parts, added to that
threatening aſpect with which they ſeemed
to hang over the wandering traveller, and to
bid him to fear, left even the light ſteps of
the Izard (the Chamois of the Pyrenees),
or the wild goats, who now and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared
ſuſpended amid the craggy fiſſures,
ſhouldd iſunite them from the mountain it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0206900204:194"/>
and bury him beneath their thundering
ruins.</p>
            <p>Daſhing down amongſt theſe immenſe piles
of ſtone, the cataracts, formed by the melting
of the ſnows, and the ice of the glacieres, in
the boſom of the mountains, fell roaring into
dark and abyſs-like chaſms, whither the eye
feared to follow them—yet, frequently, amidſt
the wildeſt horrors of theſe great objects, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
ſome little green receſs, ſhaded by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
pines, cedars, or mountain-aſh; and
the ſhort turf beneath them appeared ſpangled
with the Soldinella and fringed<note n="*" place="bottom">Dianthus ſuperbus.</note> pink, or
bluſhing with the ſcented wreaths of the
Daphne Cneorum—while through the cracks
and hollows of the ſurrounding wall of rock,
were filtered ſmall and clear ſtreams, that crept
away among the tufts of juniper, roſemary<note n="†" place="bottom">Rhododendron Alpina; dwarf roſehay. This plant ſupplies firing to the ſhepherds of the Pyrenees.</note>,
and the Rhododendron of the Alps, that
clothed the leſs-abrupt declivity; where, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted
by intervening crags, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſhelving gradually to its baſe, opened a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0206900204:195"/>
boſom more ſmiling and fertile; through
which the collected waters, no longer foaming
from their fall, found their way towards the
Mediterranean ſea; their banks feathered with
woods of cork trees, cheſnuts, and evergreen
oaks—while the eye, carried beyond them,
was loſt in the wide and luxuriant plains of
Languedoc.</p>
            <p>Never did ſuch a ſpot offer itſelf to the
eyes of Willoughby, but the figure of Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
was inſtantly preſent to his imagination—he
ſaw her ſitting by him, enjoying the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and romantic ſcenery; he heard her, in
thoſe accents which had, long ſuch power to
enchant him, expatiate on its charms, with
all that exquiſite taſte and feeling he knew
her poſſeſſed of; and remembering a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſcription given by Rouſſeau, in his
Julie, of a ſpot of this ſort among the rocks
of Meillerie.—"II ſembloit que ce lieu dé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,
dût être l'aſyle de deux amants; échappés
ſeuls au bouleverſement de la nature<note n="*" place="bottom">It ſeemed that this deſart ſpot was deſigned as an aſylum for two lovers, who had eſcaped the general wreck of nature.</note>."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0206900204:196"/>
For a moment or two he indulged ſuch a
delicious reverie, till the ſudden recollection
of the truth cruelly deſtroyed it.—Celeſtina
was not, never could be his—never could
ſhare with him the ſimple and ſublime de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
offered by the ſuperb ſpectacle of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—"with
all her great works about her."
Whether he was among the rude mountains
that ſhe has raiſed as a barrier, to divide two
powerful nations; or gratified with the more
mild beauties of his native country, never
could ſhe ſhare in his ſatisfaction, or heighten
his enjoyment—but her hours and her talents
were all deſtined to make the happineſs of
Montague Thorold.—At that idea he ſtarted
up, and hardly conſcious of the rugged pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices
beneath him, renewed his wandering
reſearches; and ſought, by activity of body,
to chaſe the fearful phantoms of loſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that haunted his mind.</p>
            <p>He had now paſſed three weeks among the
Pyrenees; had traverſed ſeveral Glaciers, and
deſcended on the Spaniſh ſide, and looked
over part of Catalonia.—Again he took his
way to their ſummits; again croſſed deep
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0206900204:197"/>
vallies of ice, and wandered over regions
where winter reigns in all its rigour, though
under a ſky of the deepeſt blue, illuminated by
the ardent ſun of July; a ſky ſo clear, that
not even a fleeting ſummer cloud, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
diverſifies its radiance.—One of the
talleſt of theſe ſtupendous points is, Le pie du
midi de Bagneus, which ſeems to be the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
of the inferior points around it:—from
its tall head he deſcended to Bagniers;
and there meaning to cloſe his reſearches, he
reſted ſome days, and then, by another route,
returned towards the country of Rouſſillon,
from whence he had firſt begun his journey.</p>
            <p>But when he arrived there, he had nothing
to do but to form ſome ſcheme of farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs;
and therefore, pleaſed as he was with
the variety and novelty offered him by this
long chain of immenſe mountains, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to lengthen his ſtay amongſt them.—His
guide, who had by this time acquired an
affection for him, delighted to carry him to
every place that he thought might offer either
novelty or amuſement—and he now converſed
with the ſmuggler, who conveyed, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremeſt
peril, prohibited articles of commerce
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0206900204:198"/>
between France and Spain; now joined the
ſolitary hunter of the Izard, or ſmaller Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mois;
and now ſhared the more dangerous
toils of thoſe who ſought the bear, the wild
boar, or the wolf, among the deep woods that
clothed the ſides of the mountains.</p>
            <p>It was in an excurſion with an hunter of
the Izard, that, Farnham having been left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
at the cabin of a ſhepherd where Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
intended to paſs the night, he and
Gaſton, his guide, were, by an accident, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated;
and he found himſelf alone—on one
of the moſt ſavage ſpots of the whole chain—above
him aroſe a point covered by eternal
ſnow; beyond which a Glacier ſpread its deſolate
and frozen ſurface for ſome miles, ſurrounded
every way by ſharp and barren rocks: on one
ſide, fed by this magazine of ice and ſnow, a
broad and thundering torrent threw itſelf; fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with deafening noiſe, into a rocky cauldron,
ſo far below that the eye could not fathom it.—A
dark and apparently inacceſſible wood of
firs was on the other ſide, where no tree or
plant could find its abode, that was not equally
able to endure the ſeverity of thoſe cold winds,
that, paſſing over theſe immenſe magazines of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0206900204:199"/>
ice, carry with them froſt and deſolation, even
into the rich vineyards and luxuriant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Gaſcony and Languedoc, and there
aſſume the name of the Bize-wind.</p>
            <p>Willoughby had lingered ſo long among
theſe mountains, that it was now the ſecond
week of Auguſt.—The evenings were, of
courſe, ſomewhat ſhortening; and the ſun was
viſible only by reflection from the ſnowy point
above him, when he found himſelf loſt on a
place where he knew not his way to any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
habitation, or was likely to hear the
ſound of a human voice.—Little accuſtomed,
however, to fear of any kind, he ſat himſelf
down on a piece of broken rock, to conſider
if, by any of thoſe remarks which Gaſton had
taught him to make, he could find his way
before, night-fall to rejoin his ſervant and his
guide, or to find at leaſt ſome place of ſhelter.</p>
            <p>Theſe obſervations, however, were impeded
by the clouds that ſeemed to ariſe from the
extenſive plains below him, and to gather
round the baſe of the mountains.—Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
every moment, and at length ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
him like waves; ſo that he no longer
diſtinguiſhed the objects beneath him, while
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0206900204:200"/>
immenſe volumes of white vapour were
poured like a ſea between him and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
precipices.—He heard louder than
ever, but he no longer ſaw the torrent that
threw itſelf down within a few yards of
him; and had apprehenſion ever been, under
any circumſtances, troubleſome to him, he now
might well have feared that, loſt in this chaos
of miſt, he ſhould at leaſt remain all night
where he was, and perhaps never regain his
companions at all.</p>
            <p>Life, however, had ſo few charms for him
at this moment, that his indifference for it,
added to his natural courage, when only him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was in queſtion, made him perfectly calm
and collected—though the thick clouds of
miſt continued to gather and darken round
the ſpot where he was now compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</p>
            <p>For a few moments the ſighing of the wind
which bore this floating vapour, the increaſed
hollow murmurs of the ruſhing waters of the
cataract, were interrupted only by the ſcream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vulture, and the deep hoarſe raven, who
ſeemed by their cries, as they failed above the
grey abyſs of miſt, to be warning their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0206900204:201"/>
of ſome approaching danger: thunder
was in fact gathered in the boſom of theſe
clouds, and Willoughby, as he ſat on his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
rock, heard it muttering at his feet;
and after ſome tremendous burſts, which
ſeemed to ſhake the mountains to their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
accompanied by blue and vivid
lightning, a violent wind aroſe, and diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the foggy clouds, drove them, with the
ſtorm generated in their boſom, to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
beneath.</p>
            <p>The laſt rays of the departed ſun were now
reflected from the ſummits of ſnow, the air
became perfectly ſerene and Willoughby ſaw
diſtinctly every object around him. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
at ſome diſtance to the left a croſs, in
an elevated ſituation, but far below the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremeſt
point of the cliffs; and he recollected,
that the day before Gaſton had ſhewn him
that croſs, and had told him that near it
was the reſidence of a ſhepherd; and that not
far from it a convent, near the foot of the
mountain.—Towards this, therefore, he now
endeavoured to find his way; and by the help
of a ſtick, with an iron fixed at the end of it,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0206900204:202"/>
and by his own activity, he at length paſſed
difficulties that to many people would have
ſeemed inſurmountable; and, attended only
by a terrier which had followed him from
England, and which had been the faithful
companion of all his wanderings, he reached
the pointed rock where the croſs was erected.</p>
            <p>It was now, however, ſo late, that he began
to deſpair of finding the hut which Gaſton had
told him was ſituated ſomething lower down.
The moon, indeed, was riſing in majeſtic
beauty behind him; but her light, he feared,
would hardly be ſufficient to guide him
among the woods and crags with which he
was ſurrounded, to an object, perhaps, entirely
concealed within them, and with which he
was wholly unacquainted.—He fat down,
however, till ſhe ſhould afford him more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
and to conſider what he ſhould do—when,
amidſt the ſilence of the night, the
ſound of a human voice, in ſlow cadence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by ſome muſical inſtrument, was
borne on the faint breeze that aroſe from
the low-lands.—He liſtened—it was not
the iiluſion of fancy, as he had for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0206900204:203"/>
ſuppoſed; and he involuntarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed—
<q>
                  <l>O, it came o'er mine ear, like the ſweet ſouth,</l>
                  <l>That breathes upon a bank of violets—</l>
                  <l>Stealing and giving odour<note n="*" place="bottom">Shakeſpeare.</note>.</l>
               </q>
His dog, too, gave evident ſigns of hearing
ſomething unuſual—ran from his maſter to
the brink of the precipice—then returned
jumping towards him, and ſeemed rejoiced
that they were once more within reach of a
human habitation.—His ſagacity aſſiſted his
maſter to follow the ſound; and deſcending
the, mountain, by an entangled and almoſt
overgrown ſheep-path, that led from one
pointed rock to another, he at length entered
one of thoſe woods of larch, pine, and cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut,
that fill many of the hollow boſoms of
the Pyrenees; and though the trees rendered
it entirely dark, the muſic, which ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
at ſhort intervals to float in the air,
led him on, till, in a ſmall glade, overſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by rocks clothed with bruſh-wood, he ſaw
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0206900204:204"/>
a ſmall cabin, or rather cottage, where he
had no doubt of finding an aſylum for the
night: his terrier now run gaily before him,
and was preſently ſaluted by the loud barking
of thoſe dogs which guard the Pyrenean flocks—but
on meeting, the animals courteouſly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
each other, and the ſhepherds dog ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
glad to ſhew the ſtrangers to his maſter.</p>

            <p>THE moon, though not yet riſen above
the trees, which on every ſide ſhaded the
rocks ſurrounding this ſolitary glen, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
general light enough for Willoughby
to perceive a groupe of peaſants aſſembled
round the door of a cottage, ſuperior in ſize
to any of the cabins of the ſhepherds which
he had yet viſited.—As he approached, the
founds which had guided him towards it
ceaſed; and a man advanced to meet him,
whoſe air and manner were very different
from the native, mountaineers whom he had
been accuſtomed to ſee, though his dreſs was
nearly the ſame. Willoughby accoſted him
in French, told him he was a ſtranger who
had loſt his guide, and deſired to be permitted
to remain in his cottage till the morning
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0206900204:206"/>
enabled him to find his companions.—The
man to whom he ſpoke hardly allowed him
to finiſh the ſentence, before, in language un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adulterated
with the Patois which is ſpoken in
that country, and is a coarſe mixture of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
and French, he expreſſed the utmoſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude
for his accommodation—and leading
him to the door of the cottage, preſented
him to his wife, to an old man her father,
and to ſeveral young people whom his muſic
had aſſembled round the cabin—and who
were inhabitants of a little group of cottages
diſperſed at ſhort intervals among the woods
on this part of the Vallée de Louſon.</p>
            <p>Every individual of this ſimple party was
eager to ſhew civility and attention to the
ſtranger.—"Louiſon," ſaid he, who appeared
to be the maſter of the houſe, and who had
met Willoughby—"Louiſon, go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
what our cottage affords, to refreſh this
gentleman, who may well have occaſion for
it, after ſuch fatigue as he has gone through."
Willoughby owned he was almoſt exhauſted—and
in a moment, milk, bread, and ſuch other
ſimple food as they themſelves lived upon,
were before him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0206900204:207"/>
With the ſame hoſpitable ſimplicity, Loui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
went again, at her huſband's requeſt, to
prepare him a bed, which one of the younger
brothers of his hoſt relinquiſhed to him; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he could find a lodging that night at a
neighbouring cottage.—Le Laurier, which he
found was the name of his hoſt, then preſſed
him to retire to his bed—but Willoughby,
refreſhed by what he had eaten, found his
curioſity ſo ſtrongly excited, by the manners
and language of this man, that it became more
powerful than fatigue—and he could not help
expreſſing a wiſh, to know how a man, who
poſſeſſed ſuch muſical talents, and whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
was certainly not that of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineer,
ſhould be found inhabiting a fequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
nook, in the boſom of the Pyrenees.</p>
            <p>"I inhabit it, Sir," replied Le Laurier,
"becauſe I was born in it; but it is true,
that I have alſo ſeen a great deal of other
parts of the world—and that it is not yet a
a month ſince I quitted the capital of France,
to return hither, after a very long abſence."—"Long,
indeed," ſaid his wife, who had now
rejoined them—"Alas! ſo long"—and ſhe
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0206900204:208"/>
ſighed deeply—"that I never expected, Sir,
to have ſeen him again."</p>
            <p>Let me hear", ſaid Willoughby, "not
only what you have to relate of yourſelf,
but what is now paſſing at Paris, which you
ſay you have ſo lately left—I have been
ſo long, wandering among theſe mountains,
that I am wholly ignorant of the conſequencs
of that fermentation which was evident there
among all ranks of men when I paſſed through
it?"</p>
            <p>"And I was in the midſt of it all, Sir,"
replied Le Laurier—"for my maſter, Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
de Bellegarde, was among the priſoners
who were releaſed from the caſtle of Mount
St. Michell—but our hiſtory is too long for
this evening:"—he gave, however, a brief
detail to. Willoughby, of what had paſſed at
Paris the preceding July—and then, gaily
turning the converſation, ſaid—"Well, Sir,
but here am I, after all this, returned to my
cottage in the Pyrenees, and here is Louiſon
and my family—we are all happy together—and
what is yet better, my dear maſter is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to his home here below us."—"And
where is his home?" "Oh, Sir, the Chateau
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0206900204:209"/>
of Rochemarte, where his family have lived
ſince the beginning of the world, I believe,
is juſt down in the valley—have you never
ſeen it?—to-morrow, pleaſe Heaven, you
ſhall—and you ſhall ſee my maſter—who is
now indeed the Count of Bellegarde—for his
father and brother are dead—you ſhall ſee him,
Sir; and ſee how a man enjoys liberty that
has been a priſoner ſo many years,—Not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that he is ſo happy as ſome people would
be, becauſe of the misfortunes in the beginning
of his life—which always hang upon his
mind—but now, I hope, in time, he will get
over them.—For my part, I think it folly to
lament what we cannot help, or regret what
cannot be recalled—and I wiſh the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
was of my diſpoſition."</p>
            <p>"'Tis a very fortunate one, at leaſt for
yourſelf," replied Willoughby—"and has
undoubtedly helped you gaily through the
world." "No, Sir, not gaily—but tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably;
amidſt the ſevereſt of thoſe misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
which I ſhared with the Chevalier, I
had always a perſuaſion that I ſhould reviſit
my cottage, and my Louiſon."—"Ah, thank
Heaven, your perſuaſion was a juſt one, my
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0206900204:210"/>
friend," replied his wife—and now that we
may not part with melancholy impreſſions
on our minds, let us have a little more
muſic."</p>
            <p>Le Laurier then began to play on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
Willoughby had before heard, and
which was ſomething between a lute and a
Spaniſh guitar—he touched it with uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
taſte, and ſang a ſimple ruſtic air; the
cadence was ſolemn and pathetic, and at every
cloſe, the female part of his auditory joined
their voices in uniſon.—Willoughby had now
time to obſerve the groupe before him by the
clear light of the moon, which caſt a mild
and unclouded radience around them—The
ſcene was ſimple and affecting—Le Laurier,
a fine manly figure, ſat on a feat of turf by
the ſide, of his door—His wife, a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
woman, ſtood leaning againſt the ſide of
it, her head inclined towards him; a girl,
twelve or thirteen years old, who was his
eldeſt daughter, leaned on the turf, and looked
up towards him, with a fort of innocent and
affectionate admiration; while a boy of ſeven,
the youngeſt of his children, had fallen aſleep
as he ſat at her feet, and reſted his head on
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0206900204:211"/>
her lap;—two or three young peaſants were
behind, liſtening to the muſic, and gazing at
the ſtranger; and, in a chair, before the door,
the venerable father of the family, ſat, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
the felicity ſo lately reſtored to
them all, by the return of Le Laurier—with
the mild reſignation of repoſing age.</p>
            <p>A thouſand fragrant ſmells floated in the
air, after the rain; and the lighteſt wind
whiſpered among the woods by which they
were every way ſurrounded.—Not a ſound
interrupted the plaintive paſtoral air, which
the performer now began to play, while
his wife and daughter alternately ſung a
ſtanza.—It was a kind of romance in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois—but
Willoughby underſtood it to
be the complaint of a mountain ſhepherd,
whoſe miſtreſs had forſaken him for a richer
eſtabliſhment.—There was nothing new in it,
but it was the language of nature, and brought
forcibly to the mind of Willoughby his own
misfortunes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0206900204:212"/>
The ſoothing melancholy which every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
around him ſeemed to breathe; the light
of the moon trembling among the waving
branches, of which Celeſtina had ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
the effect when they were wandering
together; the ſimple cadence of ruſtic muſic,
even the happineſs which he ſaw on the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances
of his hoſt and his family, combined
to raiſe in his mind regret and languor.—Never
could he now hope to enjoy ſuch a
ſcene with Celeſtina; never was he likely to
taſte the delight of being reſtored to all he
loved—Oh, no!—Celeſtina was the wife of
another—and the world had no happineſs for
him.—As he indulged theſe melancholy
thoughts, he ſat almoſt motionleſs, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be attending to the muſic of Le
Laurier—but on a ſudden they quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
him, and ſtriking his hands together,
he ſtarted up, and walked ſuddenly away
from the little aſſembly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0206900204:213"/>
His hoſt immediately ceaſed to play, and
following him, enquired with unaffected ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude,
if he was ill.—Willoughby immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
recovering himſelf, thanked him for his
kindneſs; and aſſured him, that his emotion
was occaſioned merely by the ſong he had
heard, which had brought ſome unpleaſing
recollections to his mind.—The man, inſtead
of attempting to conſole him by common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
ſpeeches, ſaid, he would then leave him
a moment; and hoped he would ſoon rejoin
them, and allow them to wiſh him a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.—Willoughby
walked on a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
towards the wood—he looked up to the
moon—"Even at this moment," ſaid he,
"perhaps the eyes of Celeſtina are fixed on
thee, mild and beautiful planet.—Thoſe fine
and expreſſive eyes, which I have ſeen fill
with tears of admiration and delight, as they
have contemplated the beauty of the univerſe,
and the wiſdom of its Creator—Ah, Celeſtina!—our
hearts were made for each other—but
yours—yours is perhaps changed, and to me
is loſt as well as your perſon."—he dared not
truſt himſelf with this train of thought; but
turning, walked ſlowly back towards the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0206900204:214"/>
cottage door, where only Le Laurier, and his
Louiſon, now waited to ſhew him to his bed.
As he walked ſilently along, the bells of a
convent below ſeemed to be calling its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
to their evening prayers; and from
an higher part of the mountain, which aroſe
very ſuddenly beyond the woods, a ſmall bell
anſwered, and was re-echoed among the rocks.—On
his reaching Le Laurier, he enquired
what theſe ſounds meant—"The bells, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,"
ſaid he," "are thoſe of the convent
of St. Benoit, about half a mile below us;
and the ſmaller one is that of Father Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
a hermit, who inhabits one of the rocks
above—he has lived there many years.</p>
            <p>"And where is the caſtle of Rochemarte?"
enquired Willoughby.</p>
            <p>"It is almoſt cloſe to the convent," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Le Laurier—"and if you wiſh to ſee
them both I will wait upon you thither to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow."</p>
            <p>Willoughby now repeated his acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for the courteſy he had received; and
retired to his ruſtic bed—where fatigue, in
deſpite of the depreſſion of ſpirits, which his
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0206900204:215"/>
laſt reverie had brought upon him, gave him
up to repoſe; and he, for a while, enjoyed
that
<q>Sweet forgetfulneſs of human care,</q>
without which the wretched would loſe the
power of enduring their wretchedneſs; and
the happy, that of enjoying their good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
            <p>BY the break of day, the following morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Willoughby had left his ruſtic couch,
and joining his hoſt and his family, partook
of their ſimple meal.—He felt ſome concern,
on reflecting on the panic poor Farnham muſt
have been in, when the guide returned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him to the place of rendezvous, the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evening.—He expreſſed his uneaſineſs on
this head to Le Laurier, who ſaid, he knew
the place deſcribed, perfectly; and would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſend thither the ſon of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
ſhepherd, who was then employed
about his cottage, and bring his ſervant and
the guide to him: in the mean time, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to ſhew Willoughby the chateau of his
maſter; a propoſal which his gueſt readily
accepted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0206900204:217"/>
Louiſon, however, on their being about to
depart, had, in her very expreſſive face, a
look of concern; and in her manner, an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of inquietude, for which Willoughby
wiſhed to account.—He was not long left in
ſuſpence: ſhe took her huſband's hand, and
ſaid, "My friend, you will not leave me
long."—"No, ſimpleton," replied he—and
then turning to Willoughby, he gaily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed—"Here
is a woman, who is afraid of
truſting her huſband to go half a mile!"</p>
            <p>"Ah, Monſieur,"—ſaid Louiſon—"you
would not blame me, if you knew how he
once left me—he went away only for a few
days, and he ſtaid near three years."</p>
            <p>"But not voluntarily, indeed," anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Le Laurier—"I met my maſter, my
dear maſter, who had been ſo kind to me—in
priſon—in diſtreſs—in a ſtate of mind bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
on inſanity—and I could not leave
him."</p>
            <p>"I do not blame you for that, my friend,"
ſaid Louiſon; "but I own I am afraid of its
happening again."</p>
            <p>"How happen again?—the Chevalier—
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0206900204:218"/>
or rather the Count, my maſter, is not now
as he was then?"</p>
            <p>"Ah, no!—But you have owned yourſelf,
that he is reſtleſs and unhappy; and though
he appears at times delighted with being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to his liberty, his eſtate, and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yet, that at times his mind is unſettled, and
his ſchemes wild and uncertain—and if he
ſhould take it into his head to travel again!"</p>
            <p>"You fear that I may be tempted to travel
with him."</p>
            <p>"Yes," ſaid his wife—"indeed I do."—Le
Laurier then tried to laugh away her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
and they left her; while Willoughby
felt his dialogue give new force to the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
he had to ſee the Count de Bellegarde.</p>
            <p>As their way was down through the woody
ſide of the mountain, they ſoon reached the
domain of the chateau; in which, the firſt
object that ſtruck Willoughby, in a ſpot which
had once been cleared of trees, but where the
underwood, and a ſmaller growth of wood
again, almoſt concealed it, was a pavilion, which
had once been magnificent, but was now in
ruins.—It was built of various-coloured mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0206900204:219"/>
found in the Pyrenees; was of Grecian
architecture, and ſeemed to have been a work
of taſte. The pillars of the portico, though
broken, yet ſupported its roof; and behind
it were three apartments, that had once been
richly furniſhed: one, as a banqueting room;
the other two as rooms, for the <hi>Sieſta</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Sieſta</hi>—repoſing for an hour or two after dinner, during the extreme heat; as was uſual in Spain, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, Italy, and the Weſt Indies.</note>, which
is uſually taken here as in Spain.—The cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of yellow damaſk, were fallen, and the
hangings of the rooms devoured by the moths,
and decayed by the damps from the windows;
which, having never been glazed, the ſhutters
had long ſince dropped down.—There was
ſomething particularly melancholy to the
mind of Willoughby in contemplating this
building, once the ſeat of gaiety, ſplendour,
and luxurious repoſe, thus deſerted—and he
enquired of Le Laurier, if the preſent Count
never intended to repair it.—"Sir," replied
he, "My Lord, the Count, has hardly had
time to think about that yet; for he has been
ſo little a while at his caſtle, that every thing
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0206900204:220"/>
there remains as it was—ruinous enough.—But,
as for this pavilion, I queſtion if ever it
will be put in order, though my lord has
ſuch an odd ſort of a liking to it, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
almoſt he got home, he came down to
look at it.—It was quite late in the evening;
but it was not dark—and he looked in at the
window, for that night I could not open the
door—the key was loſt—and the locks were
all ruſty—and by what he ſaid, I am ſure there
is ſome ſtory belongs to this place.—The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the caſtle, indeed, always had a notion
of its being haunted ever ſince the death of my
lord's ſiſter, whoſe heart, they ſay, was broke by
her father's ill uſage.—Certain it is, that the
old Count cauſed this place to be ſhut up,
and took away the fine glaſſes and pictures
that were in it once—but what you fee now
he left to fall to pieces.—There uſed to be
large trees all around it; and all manner of
flowers; and the ſtream, that now almoſt ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
among thoſe reeds and ruſhes, and with
difficulty finds its way to the moat of the
caſtle, was then brought into a bath, behind
the banqueting-houſe, and. into a baſon,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0206900204:221"/>
which is now grown over with weeds and
graſs, ſo that it can hardly be traced.</p>
            <p>Willoughby left this deſolate ſpot with a
ſigh, and as his companion led him through
the obſcure paths of the woods that ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, he enquired whether the caſtle itſelf had
equally ſuffered from time.—"Oh, yes, Sir,'
replied Le Laurier, "from time; and from
war, too.—It was formerly a place of great
ſtrength, and of great importance, as a paſs
into France, from the Spaniſh ſide of the
the Pyrenees; and held out a long ſiege
when the famous Count of Bellegarde, my
lord's anceſtor, defended it for Henry the
Fourth, <hi>our</hi> king; againſt the army of the
League."—"Perhaps," ſaid Willoughby,
"your Lord may not like the intruſion of a
ſtranger into his retirement?"—"Oh," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
his conductor, "we may not happen
to meet him; or, if we ſhould, it will be a
ſufficient introduction and recommendation,
for you, Sir, that you are an Engliſhman, for
he loves the Engliſh."</p>
            <p>Encouraged by this aſſurance, Willoughby
proceeded, and in a few moments, the woods
aſcending a little, as they reached the extreme
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0206900204:222"/>
baſe of the mountain, opened into what could
only be called a plain, when oppoſed to the
ſurrounding hills, for the ground was rugged
and uneven, ſcattered with maſſes of ruined
buildings, that had formerly been part of the
outward fortifications; but of which ſome
were fallen into the foſſe, and others over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
with alder, aſh, and arbeal. The gate
of the caſtle, and all beyond the moat, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
was yet entire, as were the walls within its
circumference, bearing every where the marks
of great antiquity, but of ſuch ponderous
ſtrength, as time alone had not been able to
deſtroy.—Where breaches had been made by
cannon, the walls had been repaired; but
this work being of leſs durability than the
original ſtructure, had gone to decay; and
the depredations of war were ſtill very viſible.
The whole was compoſed of grey ſtone; the
towers, at each end, roſe in frowning, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
above the reſt of the building; and
having only loops, and no windows, impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ideas of darkneſs and impriſonment, while
the moſs and wall-flowers filled the interſtices
of the broken ſtones; and an infinite number
of birds, made their neſts among the ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0206900204:223"/>
cornices, and half-fallen battlements,
filling the air with their ſhrill cries.</p>
            <p>Over the moat, which was broad and deep,
but now only half-full of water, which was
almoſt hidden by aquatic plants, ſheltering
ſeveral ſorts of water-fowls, that now lived
there unmoleſted; a draw-bridge, with maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
chains, led to the gate of the firſt court,
under an high arched gate-way, defended
by a double port-cullis: this court was where
the caſtle guard were, uſed to parade—It was
ſpacious, and the buildings that ſurrounded
it were gloomily magnificent; but now, no
warlike footſteps wore away the graſs which
grew over the pavement; no martial muſic
echoed among the arches and colonades—one
ſolitary figure alone, appeared ſlowly walking
with his arms croſſed, on the terrace that led
to the ſecond court.—"There is my Lord, the
Count," ſaid Le Laurier—"Speak to him,
then," replied Willoughby, "and apologize
for my intruſion." Le Laurier advanced,
with his hat in his hand, and at the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Count, who then firſt perceived him
and Willoughby, came towards them.—His
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0206900204:224"/>
military air, and dignified figure, were tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
by the mild and courteous manner with
which he moved forward to receive the
ſtranger whom Le Laurier announced to him.
He was greatly above the common height,
thin, and a little bent, as if from depreſſion
of ſpirit—but his face pale, ſallow, and ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated,
as it was, was marked with ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
expreſſion, that all the adventures of
his life ſeemed to have been written there.—When
he ſpoke, his dark eyes were full of
fire and vivacity, yet at times they were wild;
and at others, heavy and glazed—his brows
were a little contracted, and hollowneſs about
his temples and cheeks, and the ſtrong muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
lines of his whole face, ſeemed to bear
the harſh impreſſions of the hand of adverſity,
rather than of time: for though his hair was
grey, and he looked much older than he really
was, Willoughby did hot think him above
four or five-and-forty: at his breaſt was the
croſs of the order of St. Eſprit; and his dreſs,
that of a captain of cavalry, was not modern,
and apparently neglected—his whole appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
inſtantly announced him to be a man of high rank.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0206900204:225"/>
If Willoughby was pleaſed with his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and addreſs, he ſeemed equally, or even
more gratified by the curioſity expreſſed by
an Engliſhman, to viſit him. "You ſee me
here, Sir," ſaid he, "releaſed only a few
weeks ago from a long impriſonment, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
at my freedom, and a ſtranger in my
own houſe. To thoſe only, who have been
the victims of deſpotiſm, it would be eaſy to
comprehend my ſenſations on ſuch a ſudden
emancipation; and the triumph with which
I reflect that I owe it to the ſame noble efforts
which have given liberty to France—to my
country."</p>
            <p>"Ah!" continued he, pauſing—and loſing
at once all the vivacity with which he had, a
moment before, ſpoken—"ah! what ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of concern are mingled with this exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—I
regain my freedom—but where ſhall
I regain my happineſs?"</p>
            <p>He now fell into a deep muſing, which
laſted only a moment—while Willoughby
walked by his ſide, on the terrace—then ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
awaking from it, he cried—"But it is
too ſoon to trouble you with this ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation—we
ſhall have time enough—for I
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0206900204:226"/>
flatter myſelf, Sir, with a hope of your ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with me, as long as you remain in this
country—you muſt have no other home.—If
you knew the pleaſure I have in converſing
with the Engliſh!"—he pauſed again, as if
forgetting what he meant to ſay—and then
added—"I will introduce you to my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—to
my little Anzoletta—for I have ſaved
her—that one little gem is reſtored to me in
all its luſtre, amid the wreck of every thing
elſe that was dear to me—we will find her
now." He then entered through another
arched way, the ſecond court of the caſtle,
and Willoughby accompanied him in ſilence,
while Le Laurier, with his hat in his hand,
followed, as the Count bade him.</p>
            <p>They entered an immenſe hall; barbarouſly
magnificent; it was roofed with beams of oak,
and the ſides covered with ſtandards, and tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies
of armour, the periſhable parts of which
were dropping to pieces.—The narrow Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic
windows were filled, not with glaſs, that
admitted the light, but with glaſs, painted
with the atchievements of the family; mingled
with the heads of ſaints and martyrs, whoſe
names were now, no where to be found, but
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0206900204:227"/>
in the archives of the neighbouring convent.
But, in contemplating the innumerable coats
of arms that were blazoned on the windows,
and on the banner that hung in faded majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
between them, Willoughby could not
help recollecting what food they would afford
for the favourite ſpeculations of his uncle—and
his thoughts dwelt a moment on the
ſcene that might have paſſed in conſequence
of his abſence, in the family of Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north.</p>
            <p>Theſe reflections, however, he had neither
inclination nor time to indulge—for the Count
aſcending a broad, but ſteep ſtair-caſe of ſtone,
that led out of the hall, and wound within
one of the turrets, entered a gallery, and at
the end of it was his daughter's apartment,
the door of which was open, and Willoughby
was immediately introduced to a young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who ſat before a frame, working on a
piece of embroidery: a woman between fifty
and ſixty, who ſeemed to be a kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs,
was with her.</p>
            <p>Willoughby was pleaſed by the graceful
ſimplicity of her figure, and the beauty of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0206900204:228"/>
her face—but when ſhe ſpoke, in anſwer to
the compliment he made her, this pleaſure
was converted into amazement—he fancied
he heard the voice of Celeſtina!</p>
            <p>So ſtrikingly did its tones reſemble thoſe to
which his heart had been always tremblingly
reſponſive, that had he not ſeen who ſpoke,
he ſhould not have doubted of its being Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
herſelf.—He ſtarted—and felt the
blood ruſh into his cheeks—nor could he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
recollect himſelf enough to reply to
what Anzoletta ſaid; and again call forth
thoſe ſounds, to which, the ſecond time ſhe
ſpoke, he liſtened with increaſed aſtoniſhment
and more painful delight; for, not only the
ſimilarity of her voice, to that of Celeſtina,
was more evident, but he ſaw a reſemblance
to her in the air and manner of Anzoletta,
that aſſiſted the deluſion.</p>
            <p>Anzoletta ſeemed to be about the age of
Celeſtina, but her figure was leſs: her hair
and eyes were much darker, nor had ſhe that
dazzling and radiant complexion which made
it always difficult to believe of Celeſtina, that
ſhe was a native of the South of Europe—the
features of Anzoletta were, perhaps, more
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0206900204:229"/>
regular, and were not turned like Celeſtina—ſo
that the reſemblance conſiſted in that ſort
of air of family, which we ſometimes obſerve
among relations—a kind of flying likeneſs,
which we now detect, and now loſe.</p>
            <p>The Count ſeemed highly gratified by the
notice Willoughby took of his daughter—to
whom he now ſpoke, and bade her prepare
herſelf for dinner, for that his gueſt was to
remain with them—He then led Willoughby
back to the room where he uſually ſat him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and as they went, he ſaid—"Is not my
Anzoletta charming?"—"She is indeed," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Willoughby.—"Perhaps," added the
Count, "perhaps you would not believe that
ſhe is the child of the daughter of a man of
inferior rank, one of my father's vaſſals."—"Is
ſhe not <hi>your</hi> daughter, my Lord?" en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Willoughby.—"Yes," replied the
Count, "ſhe is my legitimate daughter; and
as ſuch, I glory to acknowledge her—but
her mother was <hi>rolurier</hi>—and, to my marrying
her, ſhe owed all her misfortunes; and I,
many of mine.—But if ever you think it
worth while to hear the incidents of a life,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0206900204:230"/>
that has, I think, been marked with ſome
ſingular occurrences, I ſhall have a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
pleaſure in relating them.</p>
            <p>"Nothing would oblige me ſo much,"
ſaid Willoughby, whoſe curioſity had been
every inſtant increaſing—eſpecially ſince he
had ſeen Anzoletta.—"May I, till I can be
ſo gratified, enquire where is the mother of
your lovely daughter?" "Yes," replied the
Count; "and you will hear a freſh inſtance
of the barbarous policy which deſpotiſm en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages
and protects. Her mother! ſhe was
compelled by my father, the laſt Count of
Bellegarde, to enter into a convent of Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
at Bayonne, and there to take the vows.
She was my wife, by the laws of God and
man—but I was abſent with my regiment—I
was unable to protect her—and the power of
the governor of the province, and of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
and tyrannic father, were united to tear
her from me.—Would to heaven, we had been
theonly victims—but there was yet another!—another,
who is gone whence there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn."—Here
he ſell into one of thoſe fits
of ſilent muſing, to which Willoughby had
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0206900204:231"/>
even during their ſhort acquaintance, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to be ſubject.—It laſted, however,
only a moment, and then recovering from it,
he claſped his hands eagerly together, and
cried, with energy—"But, for my wife—my
Jaquelina—Thanks to the generous, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſpirit of my country—I ſhall retrieve
her—ſhe yet lives—I have ſeen her through
the iron bars of her cloiſter—I have ſpoke to
her!—I have, in my boſom, a handkerchief
which ſhe gave me, bathed in her tears!—She
told me where to find our child—our
little Anzoletta—and I go to Paris to demand
and obtain her liberty: to claim her as my wife,
and to be enabled to bring her hither, to a
huſband, who, changed as ſhe is, by conſine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and affliction, ſtill adores her—to a
daughter, whoſe early excellence promiſes to
reward us both for many, many years of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
and ſorrow."</p>
            <p>The eyes of the Count were filled with
tears, as he ceaſed ſpeaking; and Willoughby,—whoſe
heart was as tender as it was manly,
was deeply affected.—"Heaven grant you all
your wiſhes, Sir!" cried he—"and that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0206900204:232"/>
your private happineſs may be one of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
bleſſings attending on public feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city."—The
Count wrung his hands—and
cried, with yet increaſed vivacity, "It will—it
will, my friend!"—There, was in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
a ſomething bordering on wildneſs, as
he continued this diſcourſe, which Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
remarked with ſome concern—he was not,
therefore, ſorry, when it was interrupted by
the entrance of Le Laurier, who told him,
that the meſſenger he had diſpatched, had
found his ſervant and the guide; and, reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them from their fears, for his ſafety,
which had been cruelly ſevere upon poor
Farnham, had brought them both to the
caſtle, whither his wife had directed them.</p>
            <p>Willoughby had been under a good deal
of concern for Farnham, who, he knew, muſt
have been dreadfully alarmed for the ſafety
of his maſter; his arrival, therefore, was
particularly welcome, and he was glad to
change his clothes; for which purpoſe, he
now begged leave to retire—The Count or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Le Laurier to ſhew them to an apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to take care he had every accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0206900204:233"/>
he deſired.—Willoughby, as he
marched gravely along, through the long gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries,
and acroſs the gloomy hall, fancied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a knight of romance; and, that ſome of
the ſtories of enchanted caſtles, and wandering
adventurers, of which he had been ſo fond,
in his early youth, were here realized.</p>

            <p>AFTER a repaſt, rather hoſpitable than
ſplendid, during which the looks of paternal
admiration, and tenderneſs with which the
Count obſerved every action of Anzoletta,
and her innocent and agreeable vivacity, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
them both more attractive to Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:
Monſieur de Bellegarde, finding that
Willoughby rather wiſhed to liſten to the
hiſtory he had promiſed, than to take any
repoſe, during the heat of the day, propoſed
retiring to the north gallery, and there begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this intereſting account. Willoughby
moſt readily agreed to the plan—and the
Count, diſmiſſing his daughter and her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs,
led him hither.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0206900204:235"/>
This room extended far on the north ſide
of the building—and looked over the moat to
a wood of fir and cypreſs, fringing the abrupt
aſcent of the mountain, which roſe almoſt
perpendicularly from the. plain. As this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity
commanded the caſtle, two ſtrong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts
were built on it, where, in hoſtile
times, parties were ſtationed to keep the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
from poſſeſſing poſts, whence the caſtle
might be annoyed. In the port-holes of theſe
fortreſſes, now faſt approaching to decay,
the cannon yet remained, though ruſty and
uſeleſs—and the ſtrong but treſſes, and circular
towers, mantled with ivy, were ſeen to aſpire
above the dark trees, on every ſide encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
them—while, a little to the weſt, from
a fractured rock, of yellow granite, which
ſtarted out amid the trees, a, boiling and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
ſtream ruſhed with violence, and pouring
down among the trees, was ſeen only at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals,
as they either crowded over it, or, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding,
left its foaming current to flaſh in the
ſays of the ſun.</p>
            <p>It was altogether one of the moſt ſublimely
beautiful landſcapes Willoughby had ever
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0206900204:236"/>
ſeen; and he contemplated the ſcenery with
penſive pleaſure, while the maſter of it thus
addreſſed him:</p>
            <p>Perhaps you are ſo well read in the hiſtory
of France, as to make it unneceſſary for me
to remark—that my family is ancient and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious.—My
father, the Count of Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde,
was educated with every prejudice that
could make him tenacious of his rank, and
anxious to ſupport it.—He was married early
by my grandfather to the heireſs of the houſe
of Ermenonville; and his eldeſt ſon, the
only iſſue of that marriage, inherited from his
mother the great property of that family.</p>
            <p>But ambition, which my father poſſeſſed
a great ſhare, both from his temper and his
education, ſaved him not entirely from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of ſoſter paſſions.—During the life of
his firſt wife, an indigent relation of his own,
was received into the family of one of his
ſiſters, as a dependant—ſhe was beautiful and
intereſting, and my father being releaſed, by
death, from an engagement, in which his
heart had never any ſhare, married her—and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0206900204:237"/>
thought himſelf overpaid, by the felicity of
his ſecond marriage, for the little ſatisfaction
he had found in the firſt.</p>
            <p>But though he had in one inſtance, ſuffered
his inclinations to conquer that aſpiring tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
which, under leſs-powerful influence,
would have led him to ſeek for a ſecond great
heireſs, he ſeemed determined to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with more aſſiduity to the attainment of
power and honour, by other means—He had
ſome capacity for buſineſs; was daring in
forming ſchemes, and obſtinate in adhering to
them—proud, vindictive, and violent; with
ſuch a portion of national pride, as made him
hold every other nation but his own in the
utmoſt contempt—and, whenever they ſeemed
likely to diſpute the ſuperiority of France, he
was tempted to wiſh, like Caligula, that the
people ſo preſumptuous, had but one neck,
than he might deſtroy them at a blow.</p>
            <p>With this diſpoſition, you will eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
the inveteracy with which he regarded
the Engliſh.—He held a high poſt in the
war-department of France, in 1755, when
thoſe hoſtilities commenced, in which, for a
ſeries of years, the Engliſh had almoſt always
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0206900204:238"/>
the advantage—events that added to national
hatred, or a kind of perſonal and peculiar
malignity—for of many of the operations in
which his country failed of ſucceſs, the Count
of Bellegarde was the projector.</p>
            <p>By a long courſe of defeat, however, his
maſter, Louis the Fifteenth, and his co-adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
grew weary of his influence; and, in
1759, after the loſs of Quebec, he was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
diſmiſſed in diſgrace.</p>
            <p>Nor was this mortification the only one he
was at that period fated to ſuſtain.—A violent
and infectious fever at the ſame time deprived
him of his wife—and, wounded thus deeply,
by public and domeſtic misfortune, he took
the ſudden reſolution of quitting the world,
and retiring to this caſtle, with my brother,
my ſiſter, and myſelf.</p>
            <p>Hither, then, he came—leaving, at Paris,
his eldeſt ſon, who had been ſome time in
poſſeſſion of his mother's fortune, and had
lived entirely independent of. his father, and
on no very friendly terms with him. To
the young, gay, and diſſipated D'Ermenon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville
(for he took the name of his mother)
the auſterity of a ſtateſman, and converſation
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0206900204:239"/>
of a politician, were alike repulſive; and he
had no feelings about him that diſpoſed him
to ſubmit to the authority of a parent, from
whom he had nothing to expect—for it was
well underſtood, that of all the Count de
Bellegarde either poſſeſſed from his anceſtors,
or acquired from his political advantages,
D'Ermenonville would inherit only that ſhare
which, by its being entailed, his father could
not deprive him.</p>
            <p>The error of which the Count thought he
had been guilty, in allowing to this eldeſt
ſon early independence, and boundleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
made him determine to adopt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to me and my brother, a conduct alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
contrary.—On his retirement from the
world, my brother, who was the eldeſt of the
two, and called the Baron de Rochemarte,
was near fifteen, and I was only fourteen
months younger—yet, though at that age,
we ſhould have been either purſuing our
ſtudies, or with the army, in which we had
both commiſſions, my father took us away
with him: and, with a governor whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
becauſe he was the moſt rigid pedant he
could find, he fixed us both in what we then
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0206900204:240"/>
thought the deſolate ſolitude of Rochemarte—a
place which he had fixed upon for his
own reſidence; not only becauſe it was ſo far
from the ſcene of his former elevation; but
becauſe it was the only one of his capital
houſes that was not entailed on D'Ermenon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.!</p>
            <p>The gloomy ſolitude in which he lived—the
power of life and death which he poſſeſſed
in his domain, and the proneneſs of his mind
to ſuperſtition, which was encouraged by the
Monks of the neighbouring convent, who
ſoon. found the advantage of having ſo liberal
a benefactor—at once darkened and ſoured a
temper, never very good. Accuſtomed to dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
and command, he could not now diveſt
himſelf of the habit: and his vaſſals, and his
ſons, being the only perſons over whom
he could now exert it, were the victims of
his harſh and imperious ſpirit—for in them
he delighted to diſcover, or to fancy faults,
only for the ſatisfaction of impoſing puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>It may be eaſily imagined, that to two lads
of our ages, and who had from temper and
conſtitution a keen reliſh for pleaſures of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0206900204:241"/>
every kind, the life we led was inſupportable.
The mild and ſoft-tempered Genevieve, our
ſiſter, who was then not more than twelve
years old, though from her ſex and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
more accuſtomed to, and able to endure
ſolitude and confinement, began to feel the
weight of thoſe chains, of which, however,
ſhe did not complain; but endeavoured, by
her ſoothing ſweetneſs, to make ours ſit more
eaſy.—She was my father's favourite, and her
influence had, for ſome time, the power to
aſſuage the harſhneſs of his temper—but, by
degrees, even that failed of its effect, and
his mortified pride, his loſt happineſs, and
his gloomy notions of religion, combined to
increaſe this ferocity, and irritate his aſperity,
till, at length, his children, though the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of a woman he ſo fondly loved, ſeemed
to afford him nothing but objects of anger
and tyranny, and he was left alone to the
influence of Father Ignatius, a Jeſuit, whom
he took into his houſe as the director of his
conſcience; and whoſe purpoſe, it ſeemed to
be, to eſtrange him from his family en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0206900204:242"/>
There is a point, beyond which, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance
of the moſt patient ſufferer, cannot
go—Genevieve, indeed, Was not yet arrived
at this point, but the Baron and I had long
ſince paſſed it, and determined to break the
ſetters, which, in their preſent form, we did
not think even paternal authority had a right
to impoſe. The Baron, therefore, wrote to
D'Ermenonville, repreſenting our ſituation,
and entreating his aſſiſtance to deliver us
from it.</p>
            <p>The Marquis D'Ermenonville had, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
no great affection for us; he could not
be totally indifferent to the repreſentation of
the Baron; and felt, perhaps, ſome pleaſure,
in being able to thwart his father, where it
ſeemed to be a ſort of duty to act in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to him. For this purpoſe, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
and by a way which we had pointed
out to him, ſent us a conſiderable ſupply of
money, and directed us both to quit the caſtle
in the night, and find our way to Perpignan,
where his ſervant and horſes ſhould attend to
conduct us to Paris.—He urged, not only the
cruelty the Count de Bellegarde was guitly of,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0206900204:243"/>
in thus obliging us to waſte the beſt of our days
in a deſart; but the appearance it muſt have
to the world, that when a war was carrying
on, two young men, enliſted in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's
ſervice, ſubmitted to be confined, like
monks, in a cloiſter.—This remark would
have been enough to have fired us with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and military ardor; but to the incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of honour, he added the allurements of
pleaſure—and every ſcruple that remained
(for I had ſtill ſome as to leaving my father
without his permiſſion) gave way before their
united influence.</p>
            <p>I could not, however, with equal ſucceſs,
conquer the regret I felt at leaving my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Genevieve, to whom, from our earlieſt
infancy, I had been particularly attached.—She
would, we were well aſſured, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to encounter all the fury and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Count, when our departure ſhould
be known; and when we ſaw her trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with the mere apprehenſion of it, we
would very fain have obviated every difficulty
that ſeemed. to forbid our taking her with us:
but, child as ſhe was, ſhe anſwered with firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and reſolution, of which her gentle tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0206900204:244"/>
ſeemed little capable; "No, my dear
brothers," ſaid ſhe, "it is fit you ſhould
go—but that I ſhould ſtay—no point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
no military duty calls me; and I will
not deſert my father—he is unhappy—and
has need of me—he muſt not be depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at once of all his children—and, if he
treats me with rigour, the conſciouſneſs of
not having deſerved it, will enable me to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it with patience."</p>
            <p>It was neceſſary, however, that ſhe ſhould
appear wholly ignorant of our flight—and
we dreaded that her reſolution would give
way, when ſhe was charged with having been
acquainted with it; inſomuch, that we ſhould
now have repented having made her a party
in our ſecret, could we have borne the
thoughts of leaving, abruptly and unkindly,
a ſiſter, whom we both ſo fondly loved.</p>
            <p>At length, the hour came for this cruel
parting.—My father, who ſince his reſidence
here, had affected all the ſtate of a feudal ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
and even many of the precautions of a
beſieged chief, though he had no enemies to
apprehend, but the wolves and bears of the
Pyrenees; not only had the draw-bridge
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0206900204:245"/>
taken up every night, but had a ſort of guard
parade, at ſtated hours, the courts of the
caſtle. Our deſire of liberty, however, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
all the difficulties by which our
eſcape ſeemed to be impeded; and, by means
of our ſiſter, and our own reſolution, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
in ſafety, from one of the lower win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows;
croſſed the moat, which was then full,
in our drawers, by ſwimming, and dreſſing
ourſelves on the oppoſite bank, we proceeded
on foot to Perpignan; and with hearts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting
in our ſucceſs, and the joy it gave
us, allayed only by our apprehenſions for
Genevieve.</p>
            <p>Our tutor had taken a fancy to wine, and
we took care liberally to ſupply him—in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of which, and of the increaſe of
pleaſure he found, from this eaſy indulgence
of his favourite paſſion, he had inſenſibly
abated of his former ſtrictneſs; ſuffered us
every evening to go to the apartment of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevieve;
and frequently took, in our abſence,
ſuch plentiful potations, that he was in bed,
and aſleep, before we returned to our apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which were within his. Thus, we
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0206900204:246"/>
were not miſſed till the morning; and, as we
left no traces on our way, and had not even
entruſted a ſervant with our ſecret, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
that was then made for us, was quite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.
We arrived ſafely at Perpignan;
in ſpirits too elevated to be affected with the
fatigue of our long walk.—We found that
D'Ermenonville had punctually adhered to
his promiſe; and, on his horſes, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his ſervants, we proceeded gaily to
Paris.</p>
            <p>D'Ermenonville received us with more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
friendſhip than I believed to be in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—he
furniſhed us with money to equip
us for joining our reſpective regiments, as
became the ſons of the Count of Bellegarde—and
aſſured us of his continued aſſiſtance, till
my father could be brought to reaſon—it is
not, therefore, wonderful, that his friendſhips
made us blind to his faults; and, that we ſaw
not the diſſolute libertine, in the kind and
generous brother.—In fact, he had many
virtues; and it was to him we owed our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
after the peace of 1763 reſtored us to the
pleaſures of Paris. Then, however, the Count
of Bellegarde, though he reſiſted every argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0206900204:247"/>
which could be brought by the other
parts of our family, to induce him to receive,
and forgive us; yet was ſo far averſe to our
owing any farther obligation to D'Ermenon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,
whom he held in abhorrence, and no
longer acknowledged as his ſon, that he
agreed to make us each an handſome allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>Peace being made, my brother, the Baron
de Rochemarte, went into Germany, where,
during the war, he had formed ſome attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and I was for ſeveral years in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
with my regiment, hearing nothing of
my family but what I learned from the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
my ſiſter contrived, by ſtealth, to ſend
me. After our elopement, ſhe had been, for
ſome years, more rigorouſly conſined—and
had ſuffered inconceivable harſhneſs and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from her father—but at the end of ſix
years, though his temper was far from being
ſoftened by age, the death of the Jeſuit, who
had been his confeſſor, ſeemed to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
ſome little alleviation to her ſufferings.
A younger, and leſs-auſtere director, of the
ſame order, had ſucceeded to the government
of his conſcience; and Genevieve now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0206900204:248"/>
me that, accuſtomed as ſhe had been,
almoſt from her infancy, to confinement, the
moderate ſeverity of that in which ſhe now
lived, was comparatively eaſy to her—that
her father admitted of her ſervices with more
pleaſure than he uſed to do; ſpoke to her with
greater kindneſs; ſometimes allowed her to
walk out, and had promiſed that the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of one of his vaſſals, for whom ſhe had
conceived a friendſhip, ſhould be allowed to
reſide with her at the caſtle, as her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
ſhe always added her vexation, that this
execution of his promiſe was, ſhe knew not
why, always delayed from time to time;
though her old governeſs was become quite
uſeleſs as a companion—but her greateſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs
ſeemed to ariſe from our long, and
as ſhe began to fear, endleſs ſeparation.</p>
            <p>This regret ſhe repeatedly dwelt upon, with
ſo much pathetic tenderneſs, that I at length
determined to go in ſecret, and in diſguiſe, to
Rochemarte, and embrace once more, this
beloved ſiſter; for whom, long as we had
been parted, I ſtill felt the warmeſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.—I
was at Paris when I made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
where, a ſhort time before, I had
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0206900204:249"/>
formed an intimate acquaintance with a young
Engliſhman, the ſecond ſon of a nobleman—he
was two or three years younger than I was;
in perſon, remarkably handſome; and in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
the moſt engaging man I ever met with.—Our
acquaintance ſoon became the ſincereſt
friendſhip—and as he communicated to me
every intereſting circumſtance that beſel him—ſo
my ſituation in regard to my father, and
my increaſing deſire to ſee my ſiſter, were no
ſecrets to him.—He entered into all my ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude,
and encouraged me to indulge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
I had to viſit Rochemarte in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe,
for the pleaſure of ſeeing Genevieve.</p>
            <p>A letter I at that period received from her,
determined me, to heſitate no longer.—She
intimated, that her ſituation was become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
unpleaſant, from the extraordinary
behaviour of the Spaniſh Jeſuit, who had
ſucceeded old Ignatius—that this man ſeemed
to have deſigns of the moſt improper nature,
in regard to her; and, that it was he, who
had hitherto oppoſed her having Jacquelina,
the young perſon to whom ſhe was attached,
with her; becauſe he foreſaw, he ſhould then
have leſs frequent opportunities of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0206900204:250"/>
her alone: finding, however, the Count
diſpoſed to indulge her, and being unable to
form any longer pretences to prevent it, he
had at laſt told her, that he would immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
influence the Count to oblige her, if ſhe
would conſent to aſk for the addition of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
member to the family, and receive, as
if at her own deſire, a ſiſter of his, who muſt
be a ſuperintendant over both her and her
friend, and replace the ſuperannuated go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs,
who was no longer capable of her
charge.—To this, my poor Genevieve told
me ſhe had conſented, rather than not have
the company of Jacquelina, to cheer her ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude—that
Jacquelina was conſequently ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,
and the other expected every day—but
that, notwithſtanding ſhe now had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
the Jeſuit continued to find but too
many opportunities to entertain her with
converſation which ſhe could not miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
            <p>My blood boiled with indignation, while I
read this letter, and I inſtantly communicated
the contents of it to my friend, Ormond.—"It
is not poſſible," ſaid he, "that you can
heſitate, my dear Chevalier, how to act—let us
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0206900204:251"/>
ſet out inſtantly for Rochemarte—you ſee a
friend ready, not only to attend you, but to
loſe his life in your ſervice." We departed
the next day, followed only by two ſervants,
and arriving at Perpignan, began to conſult
on the means of meeting Genevieve, without
the knowledge of my father, or the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the caſtle—and the propereſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that occurred to us was, to diſguiſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and our ſervants, as hunters, and to
watch, in that dreſs, till chance ſhould throw
my ſiſter in our way.</p>
            <p>I ſometimes thought of going openly to my
father, and making one effort to awaken his
paternal feelings; to obtain my own pardon, and
my ſiſter's liberty; but after conſulting with
Ormond, we agreed, that it was better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to ſee her firſt; for a failure in the
ſucceſs of this ſcheme would probably occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
her to be ſo cloſely confined, that we
might never have an opportunity of ſeeing her
at all.</p>
            <p>Equipped, therefore, as Izard hunters, we
reached this caſtle—and wandered about a
whole day in its neighbourhood without any
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0206900204:252"/>
ſucceſs—the weather was ſo intenſely warm, for
it was now autumn, that I believed my ſiſter
came out only early in the morning, or late in
the evening—and that the beſt probability of
meeting her, was at thoſe hours—to take up
our abode near the caſtle, therefore, was mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
and I recollected the banqueting-houſe
in the wood, which had then, I imagined, been
long neglected, and where our reſidence could
not be ſuſpected. But, on entering, I was
ſurpriſed to find it newly fitted up, and ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly
furniſhed with every article that could
contribute to luxury and repoſe—this had
been done by the Jeſuit's directions, and here
he now and then made little entertainments
for ſome favourite fathers of the convent
and their female penitents, which Apicius
or Marc Anthony might have beheld with
envy.</p>
            <p>Dread of the Count's power and ſeverity,
effectually ſecured every part of his domain
from the intruſion of any of the neighbouring
peaſants. The pavilion, therefore, furniſhed as
it was, was never locked—and, as I imagined
nobody had ſo good a right to it as myſelf, I
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0206900204:253"/>
took up my abode in it without much appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of being diſlodged.—My friend oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
the other room, and our ſervants
found a lodging in the deſerted cabin of a
ſhepherd, on the other ſide of the caſtle;
from whence they were ordered to watch for
the appearance of the ladies we deſired to ſee;
and immediately, on perceiving them, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
us.</p>
            <p>The whole of the ſecond day paſſed as the
firſt had done; we wandered about the woods
that ſkirt the caſtle—but all about it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the deſolate abode of ſullen deſpotiſm.—At
night, when we had no longer any thing
to fear from the obſervation of thoſe who
might belong to it, we approached its walls
more nearly, and watched the lights at the
windows, hoping that Genevieve might paſs
with a candle; though even then it would
have been very difficult, if not impoſſible, to
have apprized her of our being ſo near.</p>
            <p>If my friend had been eager for the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he was now more earneſt for its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.—The
wild and mountainous country,
around a caſtle ſuch as is deſcribed as the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
of enchanters, and monſters of fable,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0206900204:254"/>
was exactly ſuited to inflame his ardent and
romantic imagination—and when, to theſe
circumſtances, was added our purpoſe, to
ſave a young woman from the harſh ſeverity
of a father, and the wicked hypocriſy of a
Jeſuit, he became an abſolute enthuſiaſt; and
vowed, like a true knight errant, never to
leave the ſpot till our adventure was ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond night, however, we were ſlowly
retiring to our pavilion, and had almoſt
reached it, when we fancied that among the
trees, on one ſide of us, which were then cut
into alleys, we heard female voices talking low
and plaintively.—The evening was ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly
ſtill that we heard every leaf that
quivered in the ſcarcely-perceptible air; and
theſe voices we now loſt, now heard more
diſtinctly—till at length I was ſure that one
of them was the voice of Genevieve, though
it was ſo long ſince I had heard it. I would
have flown into her arms—but Ormond, for
once more conſiderate than I was, withheld me,
by repreſenting to me, that if the perſon with
her ſhould be the Jeſuit's ſiſter, we ſhould be
ruined by our raſhneſs. Inſtead, therefore, of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0206900204:255"/>
ſhewing ourſelves abruptly, we glided along
on the other ſide of a treillage of beech, which
entirely concealed us, and, liſtening attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
heard diſtinctly, that it was to her friend
Jacquelina, that my ſiſter addreſſed herſelf.</p>
            <p>I knew not whether my voice or the ſight
of me could alarm her leaſt; but at length
determined to walk from the banqueting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
and meet her. We both, therefore,
proceeded ſlowly down the walk in which ſhe
was, leaning on the arm of Jacquelina; but
neither of them immediately perceived us—and
I had time (for though it was evening,
every object was yet diſtinct) to obſerve the
wonderful alteration that time had made in
the perſon of my ſiſter.</p>
            <p>I had left her, a beautiful girl, of twelve
years old; her fine hair hanging looſe over
her face and neck; and her features, though
then lovely and expreſſive, not yet formed.—She
was now in her nineteenth year—with the
figure of a nymph, and a countenance beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with ſenſibility and ſweetneſs—with a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
that ſeemed to have no object, and
with ſweetneſs that had ſomething of patient
acquieſcence infinitely intereſting. Her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0206900204:256"/>
was ſo beautiful a woman, that at
any other time, I ſhould have been immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ſtruck with her charms; but at this
moment, I had no eyes but for Genevieve—and
Ormond, whoſe heart had been prepared
for any impreſſion, was ſo faſcinated, that
forgetting my injunctions of ſilence, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
"Heavens! Chevalier—you never
told me that your ſiſter was an angel!"</p>
            <p>At this exclamation, though not uttered in
a loud voice, Genevieve, whoſe eyes were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fixed on the ground, raiſed them, when
ſeeing two men approach, ſhe was extremely
alarmed, and taking Jacquelina by the arm,
ſhe cried—"Here are ſtrangers, my friend—let
us haſten back to the caſtle."</p>
            <p>"No," cried I—"No, Genevieve, it is
no ſtranger, but your brother, who comes to
defend and protect you." "My brother!
my dear brother!" ſaid ſhe—"what, both!
is it poſſible; can you be both ſo good?"</p>
            <p>I held her in my arms, for ſhe was unable
to ſupport herſelf—while Ormond paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exclaimed, "Oh, would to Heaven I were
your brother! but accept me, lovelieſt of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0206900204:257"/>
women, as your friend; and be aſſured, that
I will defend ſo glorious a title with my
life."</p>
            <p>She was ſoon ſo well recovered as to liſten
to what I related to her, and her beautiful
eyes were turned towards Ormond, full of
ſuch expreſſions as charmed his very ſoul—while
ſhe thanked him for having accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
her dear Chevalier. From her conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
and from that of her amiable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
I learned, that my infatuated father,
was not only entirely governed by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
but had lately ſhewn ſo much attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the ſiſter whom he had introduced,
that there was every reaſon to apprehend the
conſequence of the increaſing influence of
both. Genevieve, however, ſpoke of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
failings, and even of his unreaſonable
harſhneſs towards her, with reluctant ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that was bewitchingly intereſting; and
Ormond, in this ſhort converſation, was gone
whole ages in love.—His eyes watched every
turn of her countenance—his ears drank the
ſoft ſounds of her plaintive voice.</p>
            <p>I ſaw that the beauty, the ſimplicity of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevieve,
aided by the ſingularity of her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0206900204:258"/>
and the ſcene in which he ſaw her, had
effected an inſtance of what has often been
denied, and often ridiculed—love at firſt ſight.
Neither Ormond, nor my ſiſter, nor I, were
conſcious of the courſe of time; but Jacquelina
at length reminded her, that it would be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
to be longer abſent from the caſtle.
She inſtantly recollected herſelf, and ſaid with
a ſigh—"My Chevalier—we muſt part—when
ſhall we meet again?" It was agreed, that
by the earlieſt dawn of the following morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
we would wait for them in the wood,
near the pavilion: we attended them as far as
we dared, towards the approach to the caſtle,
and then ſlowly and unwillingly bade them
good-night.</p>
            <p>Ormond ſtood watching my ſiſter as ſhe
paſſed among the trees, and when he could
ſee her no longer, he hinted to me, and ſaid,
with an energy peculiarly his own, "Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde,
I am in love with your ſiſter to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction!"
"I am ſorry for it, my friend,"
ſaid I; "and why ſorry?" interrupted he—with
an air of diſpleaſure; "becauſe," replied
I, "this attachment, if it indeed becomes
permanent, though very honourable to her,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0206900204:259"/>
may be a ſource of miſery to you both.—My
father has ſo great an antipathy to an Engliſh-man
and a Proteſtant, that were a man, who is
both, to poſſeſs the world, I am convinced he
would refuſe him his daughter."—"Refuſe,"
cried Ormond: "Do you think I would aſk
him? or do you, Chevalier, mean to leave
your ſiſter—ſuch a ſiſter—here in his power?"—"I
hardly know what I mean yet, my dear
friend. Let us, however, do nothing raſhly,
leſt we injure the objects we wiſh to ſerve."—Alas!
at that time, I was cool and collected,
and could argue with the romantic enthuſiaſm
of my friend; but in a few days I was as
madly in love with Jacquelina, as Ormond was
with my ſiſter.</p>
            <p>The impediments between us, were as great
as thoſe between my friend and Genevieve—Jacquelina
was of inferior birth, the daughter
of one of my father's vaſſals; and to the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
pride of the Count of Bellegarde nothing
could be ſo repugnant as ſuch an alliance.
I was not yet of the age when ſons were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to diſpoſe of themſelves; and my al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
from my father would, I was well
aſſured, be inſtantly withdrawn, if I offended
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0206900204:260"/>
him anew—All theſe conſiderations, however,
weighed nothing againſt the violence of my
paſſion—and determined as I was to marry
Jacquelina, and to give Genevieve to my
friend, the only difficulty ſeemed to be to find
a Prieſt on whom we might depend; for, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of our affection as were the objects of our
love, they refuſed to leave their home unleſs
under the protection of their huſbands.</p>
            <p>While I was ſtudying how to find and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the fidelity of ſuch a man as we had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
for, Genevieve endured from the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Jeſuit, and the encroaching au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Mademoiſelle D'Aucheterre, his
ſiſter, inſults which ſhe dared not avow to us
in all their extent. But Jacquelina, when ſhe
was alone with me, ſpake with leſs reſerve,
and told me ſhe had no doubt but that it was
the plan of D'Aucheterre, the Jeſuit, to marry
his ſiſter to the Count: and that ſo entirely
was he governed by him, that there was no
doubt of his falling into the ſnare. This was
very unpleaſant intelligence; but I forgot it
when ſhe added, that ſhe dreaded every day
leſt the walks Genevieve was now allowed to
take ſhould be prohibited.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0206900204:261"/>
It was neceſſary immediately to hazard
ſomething. I contrived to make an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with one of the younger Monks of the
convent—he had never ſeen me as the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
de Bellegarde, and believed, for ſome time,
that I was an hunter, from Pau in Berne. At
length, when I believed myſelf tolerably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with him, I told him who I was, and
with what view I had ſo long lingered about
my father's abode, from whence I had been
many years exiled. From the manner of his
receiving this intelligence, I believed I could
truſt him—It was very hazardous; for the
Fathers of the Convent were for the moſt part
decidedly in the intereſt of the Jeſuit—But I
offered to this Monk the means of gratifying
ſome of thoſe paſſions which his poverty and
mode of life afforded him little opportunity of
indulging—and he agreed to do whatever I
pleaſed.</p>
            <p>The riſing ſun of the following morning
ſaw my friend Ormond the enraptured huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of the lovely Genevieve; and gave
me, in Jacquelina, the only woman who
ſeemed to me worthy to be her friend.—Trembling
at every breath of air, at every
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0206900204:262"/>
whiſper of the falling leaves, they hurried
back to the caſtle—where an unuſual degree
of tranquillity ſeemed on that day to reign.—The
Count ſpake kindly to his daughter—and
ſhe, encouraged by the certainty of now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the man ſhe loved, put a reſtraint
upon herſelf, and behaved with more civility
to D'Auchterre and his ſiſter than ſhe could
generally command. In the evening they
met us as uſual; but our felicity was embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by the apprehenſions for our ſafety that
had taken poſſeſſion of Jacquelina.—"Though
there is not a peaſant, or a ſhepherd, round
the domains of the caſtle," ſaid ſhe, "that
loves the Count well enough to do him any
kindneſs on his own account, yet fear may
have the influence which affection and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
have not. Some of them have been tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſervants that two ſtrangers have been
ſeen for many days among the mountains,
who call themſelves Izard hunters, though
they have no dogs with them; that nobody
knows where they ſleep, or how they live;
and that they are ſuſpected to belong to a
banditti who have for ſome time infeſted the
Vallée d'Aran, about the ſource of the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0206900204:263"/>
This whiſper," continued Jacquelina,
"terrifies me. It was only to-day I heard it,
and I have never had a tranquil moment ſince:
I figure to myſelf that your lodging in the
banqueting-houſe may be diſcovered; that
you may be taken up—impriſoned—puniſhed."—I
endeavoured to appeaſe the fears of my
angelic wife, though I felt that they were too
well founded. Ormond, intoxicated by love,
and knowing leſs of the manners of the people
than I did, treated them ſlightly—"Let them
come," ſaid he;—"are we not armed?" The
following day, however, Genevieve and Jac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelina
met us in increaſed alarm. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
among the ſervants gained ground—the
Jeſuit had heard of them, and had ſaid to
Genevieve and her friend, that if ſuch men
were lurking about the confines of the caſtle,
their early and late walks would become very
unſafe, and that he muſt ſpeak to the Count
to forbid them.</p>
            <p>To remain another night in the pavilion
was not ſafe. Our little council deliberated
what to do, and Love was the preſident.
Under his auſpices, the timid Genevieve
learned courage to propoſe what appeared a
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0206900204:264"/>
more hazardous meaſure than to remain where
we were. "The eaſtern ſide of the caſtle," ſaid
ſhe, "is never inhabited on that ſide: the
guard-room, and the rooms above and under
it, have not been opened for many years:—in
that quarter, you, my Chevalier, may recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
there was a conſiderable breach made in
one of the ſieges, and the windows are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled
and broken ſtill—as nobody ever
goes near that range of rooms, would there be
much danger in your remaining in them till
we can depart?"</p>
            <p>"The danger," cried Ormond; "is no
conſideration, but why ſhould we not depart
immediately? why ſhould you and Jacquelina
ever return to the caſtle?"</p>
            <p>To this my ſiſter anſwered, that unleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions
were taken, ſuch as ſhe feared we had
not thought of, our flight would undo us—"My
father," ſaid ſhe, "by the death of that
nobleman, who was the moſt powerful among
his enemies, has obtained the government of
Rouſſillon, and has even had offers of other
advantages which may awaken his dormant
and diſappointed ambition. Thus armed with
powers to detect our flight, conſider what
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0206900204:265"/>
would be the conſequence of our being miſſing,
if we are not ſure of getting out of his reach
before he can exert that power. Secure, if
poſſible, the means of an eſcape, and we will
fly: in the mean time, you muſt think of your
own ſafety till that can be done."</p>
            <p>We were too much in love to raiſe any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
to a plan which brought us nearer the
objects of our affections; and the remark
Genevieve made as to the difficulty of our
carrying her and Jacquelina with us, without
ſome quicker means of conveyance than their
delicate limbs afforded them, was perfectly
juſt. How to procure ſuch conveyance was
a matter that required more deliberation than
the preſent moment afforded, and it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
agreed that at night, when all about the
caſtle was quiet, Genevieve and Jacquelina
ſhould be at one of the loweſt windows on the
eaſtern ſide; and that we ſhould croſs the
moat, and by their aid aſcend to that window,
which we conſidered as a very eaſy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
            <p>As it was now late in the autumn, and
there was no moon, it was dark enough for
our purpoſe. We croſſed the moat with eaſe,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0206900204:266"/>
and found our lovely conductreſſes waiting
for us; with almoſt equal eaſe aſcended the
broken wall, and I was thus in my father's
houſe, unknown to him, and took poſſeſſion
of the paternal manſion of my anceſtors as if
I had been a robber and an aſſaſſin.</p>
            <p>Here, however, under ſuch circumſtances,
I paſſed the moſt fortunate period of my life—Ah!
ſhort and fleeting felicity—which never,
never can return again!</p>
            <p>We were not, however, ſo intoxicated with
our preſent happineſs, as to neglect the means
of its continuance; but nothing was ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
as to carry them into execution. It was
only of a night I could get out, for with ſuch
a commiſſion I was unwilling to entruſt the
daring and impetuous Ormond; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
I made for horſes at two or three
villages at hours ſo unreaſonable, raiſed
ſuch ſuſpicion of my intention, that I twice
narrowly eſcaped being ſeized by the peaſants
as one of the banditti; and once, on my return
to the caſtle, was watched and compelled, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of entering it by the window, as uſual,
to plunge into the woods, and conceal myſelf
till the following evening: while my wife, my
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0206900204:267"/>
ſiſter, and Ormond ſuffered the moſt cruel
anxiety and were almoſt dead with apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>After this unſucceſsful ſally, they entreated
me not to venture out again, and we continued
to live on ſome time longer in ſecurity. The
immenſe extent of the caſtle made our abode
in this uninhabited part of it attended with
very little riſh; for the paſſages were all ſtone,
and our footſteps could not be heard, even if
we had not taken all precautions againſt noiſe.
The appearance of complaiſance which Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieve
was compelled to aſſume towards
D'Aucheterre, obtained for her any little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
ſhe choſe to aſk of him: and he allowed
her frequently to dine in her own apartment,
while his ſiſter was thus enabled to carry on,
with more ſucceſs, her plan of operations
againſt the heart of the Count, in which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſhe had made a much greater progreſs
than we apprehended. Thus we were ſupplied
with food without raiſing any ſuſpicion, and
were ſo well content with our conſinement,
ſince it was the impriſonment of love, that
could we have been ſure of its continuance
with ſafety to the objects of that love, we
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0206900204:268"/>
ſhould never have regretted our loſs of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>To this moment I am ignorant of the
means by which we were diſcovered, though
I can impute it only to the treachery of the
Monk who married us. It was after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
near five weeks after our reſidence in
the caſtle, that I was awaked by a loud ſhriek
from Jacquelina, who at the ſame moment
threw her arms about me.—I ſtarted up, and
flew to a cutlaſs which I uſually placed in a
chair near the bed; and with which I defended
Jacquelina for ſome moments, till I was ſtunned
by a blow which one of the ruffians who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
me aimed at the back of my head,
and I recovered not my ſenſes till many hours
afterwards, when I awoke in a kind of litter,
in which two hideous figures guarded me, with
their ſwords drawn. I was confined by heavy
chains; and when I enquired why I was thus
fettered like a malefactor, I was ſhewn a Lettre
de Cachet, which directed me to be conveyed to
the Baſtile—and thither I was now travelling.
Oh, Sir, if you have ever loved! you may be
enabled to judge what were my feelings!—Yet,
who was ever ſo cruelly outraged—who
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0206900204:269"/>
was ever torn from ſuch a woman, unleſs it
was my unhappy friend, Ormond!—whoſe
fate I had reaſon to fear was yet ſeverer than
my own—becauſe I doubted whether my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſavage and inhuman as he was, could
exerciſe on me exactly the ſame degree of
cruelty, which he would feel himſelf diſpoſed
to inflict on one who, in addition to his being
the huſband of Genevieve, was an Engliſhman,
and an heretic. The anxiety I felt for his
fate, and for that of my ſiſter, and the dread
of what might have befallen Jacquelina, whoſe
ſhrieks, as they endeavoured to tear her from
me, yet vibrated in my ears, made me inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of my own ſufferings, notwithſtanding
my wounds and the inconveniences of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.
But my guards were obſtinately
ſilent, and neither threats nor entreaties could
procure for me the leaſt intelligence of what
was to be the fate of the beloved friends from
whom they had divided me.</p>
            <p>While any hope remained, I retained ſome
degree of compoſure and recollection: but at
length deſpair took poſſeſſion of me—I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
delirious—Furious, frantic, I was only
prevented by my chains from deſtroying, firſt
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0206900204:270"/>
my keepers, and then myſelf.—I knew nothing
of what happened for many days, during the
diſorder of my ſenſes: when I recovered them,
I was in a room in one of the towers of the
Baſtile, ſo much weakened with the loſs of
blood that they had taken from me during my
frenzy, that I could not leave my bed. My
head had been ſhaved, and I was under the
regimen appointed for thoſe who are decidedly
inſane.—Pardon me, if I here aſk your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
till to-morrow—the recollection of what
I then ſuffered is too painful for me to dwell
upon longer; and when I think that theſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
were inflicted by a father!—Here
the Count put his hand on his heart, and
ſighed deeply. Willoughby remarked in
his eyes that unſettled expreſſion that ſtill
bore teſtimony of the ſtate of mind into which
the ſufferings he had been relating had thrown
him; and extremely affected himſelf by the
Count's narrative, he was glad, powerfully as
his curioſity was excited, to delay hearing the
melancholy cataſtrophe, for melancholy he
feared it muſt be, till the next day.</p>

            <p>WHEN the Count de Bellegarde and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
met the next morning, the former
ſeemed perfectly compoſed, but penſive and
melancholy. It was early—he propoſed walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards the convent; "and as we go,"
ſaid he, "I will conclude, as briefly as I can,
my mournful hiſtory. I will not dwell upon
the nature of my ſufferings in the Baſtile: of
much of the time I paſſed there I have no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
recollection; and, for the reſt, ſuffice it
to ſay that, by the orders of my inflexible
father, I endured all the rigours of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
in its moſt hideous form for
ſeveral months, during which I made ſome
attempts to eſcape—Attempts, the failure of
which only ſerved to convince me of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0206900204:272"/>
of effecting it; and, in the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
of rage, I curſed my exiſtence, and,
I fear, reproached Heaven itſelf for permitting
ſuch horrors on earth. The idea of Jacque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,
abandoned to the inhuman vengeance
of a man capable of acting with ſuch malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
towards his own ſon; the thoughts of the
miſery in which I had probably been the
means of involving Ormond and Genevieve,
hardly ſuffered me to attend to my own wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edueſs,
when I was capable of feeling it; but
many weeks paſt in wild ravings about <hi>them,</hi>
and then for myſelf I felt nothing.</p>
            <p>"I thus loſt ſome of thoſe miſerable days, the
cauſe of which, when I was ſenſible, I marked
on the wall of my priſon. I had now, though
my reckoning was thus rendered defective,
paſt near two years in my priſon; when my
barbarous father, at the interceſſion of my
brother the Baron, ſent a prieſt to offer me
my releaſe on certain conditions: one of
which was, that I ſhould immediately, on leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my confinement, be conducted to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,
which was then in garriſon at Liſle,
and give my parole that I would not quit it
without the permiſſion of the commanding
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0206900204:273"/>
officer. Though I ſaw that this reſtriction was
intended to prevent my gaining any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of Jacquelina, of Ormond, or of my
ſiſter, I gave the promiſed deſire, as being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed
from my deteſted priſon always ſeemed
a ſtep towards them; and two days afterwards
the governor of the Baſtile delivered me to the
perſons whom my father had ſent for me; and
I was thus conducted, like a priſoner, to join
the regiment, where the colonel, a friend of
the Count's, took care to take the parole in
the ſtrongeſt manner; and believing, perhaps,
that under ſuch circumſtances I ſhould not
feel myſelf bound in honour to keep it, he
continued to have me watched ſo ſtrictly that
I was ſtill in fact a priſoner.</p>
            <p>"And thus, at the age of twenty-nine, was I
treated; my ſoul revolting againſt the tyranny,
without the means of eſcaping from it, and
conſuming itſelf in vain projects, to ſee or to
hear from the wife ſo adored—from friends
ſo tenderly beloved.</p>
            <p>"A few days, however, after my arrival at
Liſle, my brothers, D'Ermenonville and the
Baron De Rochemarte, came in diſguiſe to find
me. They hardly knew me, ſo greatly was
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0206900204:274"/>
I changed by deſpair and confinement; but
without giving them time to expreſs their
concern, I enquired for Jacquelina—for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
for our ſiſter.</p>
            <p>"Their countenances, particularly that of
the Baron, told me that I had only tidings
of ſorrow to expect; and knowing the ſtate
in which my mind had been, he ſtudied a
moment how to ſoften them; but the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of my fear would not give him time—"Tell
me," cried I, "tell me, where is Jac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelina,
where is Genevieve, where is my
friend Ormond? They are dead, I know they
are; that inhuman man, who calls himſelf
my father, has deſtroyed them all."</p>
            <p>"No," replied the Baron, "Ormond lives,
and is long ſince returned to England—Jac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelina
lives; but lives not for you; ſhe has
taken the veil.—As for our unfortunate ſiſter,
ſhe is, perhaps, happier; ſhe has been dead
ſome months."—This cruel intelligence—that
of the three beings deareſt to me on earth I
ſhould never again ſee either, was too much
for me.—Again I loſt the ſenſe of my miſery
in delirium; and it was many days before I
could attend to the conſolation offered me by
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0206900204:275"/>
the Baron, or the lighter arguments by which
D'Ermenonville attempted to wean me from
reflections which it could anſwer, he ſaid, no
purpoſe to indulge. The ſtate I then fell into
was only another ſpecies of madneſs. I no
longer raved or vented my ſury in cries and
execrations; but I became ſilent and ſullen:
never ſpoke but to the Baron, who ſtill at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
me with paternal pity, and got leave
of the commandant to do ſo; and whatever I
ſaid to him was only enquiries after ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
relative to Jacquelina and my ſiſter, in
which he could not ſatisfy me—all that he
knew being from my father, or Madame de
Bellegarde; for the ſiſter of the Jeſuit, D'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheterre
had long ſince been raiſed to that
title, and had brought the Count to Paris,
where he was again admitted to ſuch a ſhare
of power as had enabled him to execute more
ſecurely his unnatural vengeance.</p>
            <p>"As I was no longer capable of duty, and
my malady ſeemed to be incurably fixed:—as
Jacquelina had taken the vows, and was for
ever out of my reach, the Baron obtained
leave for me to go with him to a houſe he
had in Normandy; where the patient pity
with which he watched over me, gradually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0206900204:276"/>
me to my ſenſes! but I regained them
only to feel with keener anguiſh all the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of my deſtiny. The Count de Bellegarde,
now far advanced in life, and repenting, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
whenever his new wife gave him leave
to think, of his cruel treatment of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
expreſſed ſome inclination to ſee and to
forgive me; but I felt that it was <hi>I</hi> who had
much to forgive: and, alas! I felt, too, that
though he was my father I could not forgive
him.</p>
            <p>The firſt moment in which I enjoyed
both reaſon and liberty, I ſhould have uſed in
flying to Perpignan, where, with difficulty, I
learned that Jacquelina was confined; but I
had promiſed the Baron, that I could not yet
attempt it, and to him I held my word to be
ſacred, whatever it coſt me to keep it. All
my preſent ſatisfaction was in traverſing the
ſea coaſt, near which my brother's houſe was
ſituated, and looking towards England, whence
I every day expected to hear of Ormond, to
whom I had written. Impatiently I waited
month after month for an anſwer. I wrote
again; but ſtill I heard nothing. At length
I recollected the name of an Engliſh gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
with whom Ormond lived in habits of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0206900204:277"/>
intimacy while he was in France. I wrote to
him, and my letter was immediately anſwered.
He informed me, that Captain Ormond, who
had returned to England about ten months
before in a very bad ſtate of health, had been
ordered very ſoon afterwards to America, with
his regiment, which was ſent thither to quell
the troubles which about that time broke out
in the Engliſh colonies. Thus I had no
longer any hope of ſeeing my dear friend, who
was of a diſpoſition to have joined me in my
attempt, however hazardous, for the recovery
of Jacquelina, which I was at all events deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to try at.</p>
            <p>"Wild and impoſſible as the project was, it
had taken ſuch forcible hold of my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that reaſon was no longer heard. I
concealed my intentions, however, carefully
from my brother—affected compoſure, I was
far from feeling; and, as he began to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me reconciled to my deſtiny, he no
longer refuſed to talk of Jacquelina, when I
calmly led the diſcourſe to that ſubject: and
by degrees he told me all he knew, which was,
indeed, little more than the name of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
where ſhe had taken the veil, at Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pignan.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0206900204:278"/>
"Having gained all the inſtruction I could,
I left a letter to the Baron, who had long
ceaſed to inſiſt upon any parole; and telling
him that being now well enough to return to
my duty, I ſhould merely ſee Jacquelina, take
an eternal adieu, and then rejoin my regiment.
I ſat out alone in the night, and, taking bye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads,
arrived at Perpignan.</p>
            <p>"I found a brother of Jacquelina's, who was
ſettled there: he confirmed all I had heard
of the compulſion that had been uſed by the
Count to force my unhappy wife to take the
veil. He had threatened the deſtruction of
her whole family: he had impriſoned her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and aſſured her that I was dead. If I
ſhuddered at this relation, judge how my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
my regret, my rage was encreaſed
when this brother of my Jacquelina went on
to ſpeak of what he thought I had known.
That ſhe became a mother during this inhuman
perſecution; and that an infant daughter then
exiſted. My ſiſter, too, had given birth to a
daughter; and died in conſequence of the
anguiſh of mind ſhe ſuffered at having her
child taken from her. "Where are theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?"
cried I, in an agony it is impoſſible to
deſcribe;—"Oh, carry me inſtantly where I
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0206900204:279"/>
may claim them!" "Alas, Sir!" replied my
wife's brother, "my ſiſter's child was taken
by my mother, who, ill as ſhe could afford it,
would never part with it to the Count, who,
offered to provide for it; becauſe ſhe doubted
what were his deſigns. She doubted, indeed,
with reaſon, for the other baby was ſent away
to Bayonne, as was then ſaid; but every
thing relative to it was ſo ſecretly managed,
that nobody knew for a long time what was
become of it: and it was not till ſome time
afterwards that my ſiſter, who from her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
affection for Mademoiſelle Bellegarde, was
as anxious for it as for her own, perſuaded me
to enquire about it; for we all dreaded to
hear that the Count, under the influence of the
D'Aucheterres, had been very cruel indeed
to it!</p>
            <p>"Oh! Sir, reflect a moment on my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
at this detail. In the ſame breath, I
bade my informer go on with the account of
all he knew of Ormond's child, and carry me
to my own. The wildneſs of my impatience
frightened him; he endeavoured to ſoothe me
with aſſurances that my infant was living,
and well, and then told me as gently as
he could, that he had been guilty of a
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0206900204:280"/>
breach of promiſe in naming it, for that
the Count had made the whole family enter
into an agreement never to let me know any
thing about the child.—Irritated by this new
inſtance of barbarity, I ſwore, in a tranſport of
paſſion, that I would have my daughter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to me, or periſh in the attempt; and
that I would find the child of my murdered
ſiſter if I traverſed the world."—"Alas! my
dear Chevalier," ſaid my wife's brother, "there
will be danger enough for you even in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to ſee your own daughter; for the
Count has never ceaſed to have it watched: but
for that of your ſiſter, you will certainly never
recover it. All my reſearches, which I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you were not indolently nor feebly made,
traced it no farther than into the houſe of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Madame de Pellatier at Bayonne, a friend
of the preſent Madame de Bellegarde, who
undertook"—</p>
            <p>"Madame de Pellatier!" cried Willoughby,
"Oh! eternal Heaven, are you ſure—Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
God!—are you ſure it was Madame de
Pellatier?"</p>
            <p>Amazed at the vehemence and ſingular
manner of Willoughby, for which he could
ſo little account—the Count looked at him a
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0206900204:281"/>
moment, and then ſaid—"Am I ſure? Yes,
very ſure—Have you then any knowledge
of Madame de Pellatier?"—"Oh! if I could
tell you," cried Willoughby, in agitation that
deprived him of his breath—"but I cannot—'tis
impoſſible—yet thus much—Did you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the daughter of your ſiſter—was ſhe
ever reſtored to you?"—</p>
            <p>"No, never," anſwered the Count, "all the
intelligence I was long afterwards to obtain was,
that Madame de Pellatier had placed her in a
convent at Hiers; but her name was changed,
and before I could obtain, after my laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to France, even this information, the
people who had received her were dead, and
I could only gueſs from ſome memorandums
kept in the convent, 'that a child, whom I
gueſſed to have been the ſame, was taken from
thence by an Engliſh lady."—</p>
            <p>"It is Celeſtina," cried Willoughby, in the
wildeſt tranſport, "it is my own Celeſtina.
She is mine again—without a doubt, without
any impediment, mine!"—He was conſcious,
that at that moment he was not in poſſeſſion
of his ſenſes, ſo extravagant was his joy. The
Count, accuſtomed as he had been to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
of violent paſſions himſelf, was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0206900204:282"/>
at this phrenzy, becauſe he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
not what had produced it, nor could
Willoughby, for ſome moments, command
himſelf enough to explain it; till at length,
from this paroxyſm of agonizing joy he ſunk
at once with as deep dejection, for the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
had occurred to him, that, at the very
moment when he was exulting in having ſo
wonderfully and ſo unexpectedly diſcovered
the birth of Celeſtina, and thus recovered all
his loſſes—ſhe was, perhaps, married—and no
longer intereſted for him—nor ſolicitous to
enquire on his account to whom ſhe belonged.</p>
            <p>Then as every hour's delay might be fatal
if this had not already happened, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to ſet out inſtantly for England. The
wonder, however, with which he ſaw the Count
ſurvey him recalled his wandering and bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
ſenſes; and as well as he could, though
very incoherently and inarticulately, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
his hiſtory to the Count—</p>
            <p>Monſieur de Bellegarde had not a doubt
but that Celeſtina of Willoughby was his
niece; every circumſtance, as they became
cool enough to compare them, anſwered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly.
Convinced of this, and becoming every
inſtant more partial to his gueſt, the Count
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0206900204:283"/>
now entered with the warmeſt intereſt into all
his apprehenſions leſt he ſhould loſe her; and
approved of his haſtening inſtantly back to
England—Willoughby now intreated him to
return to the caſtle, that he might not waſte a
moment—for on the event of a moment, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
ſaid he, my life depends. As they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
however, the Count concluded his own
hiſtory, and Willoughby, ſince Celeſtina was
concerned in it, commanded that portion of
attention which, perhaps, no other ſubject,
however otherwiſe intereſting, could at that
moment have commanded.</p>
            <p>"I was not deterred," ſaid the Count de
Bellegarde, "by any of the threats that my
father had uttered; but I flew to the convent
where Jacquelina was. It was gueſſed by
my impatience and ardour who I was—and I
was refuſed admittance to the grate. I then
had recourſe to the diſguiſe of a female dreſs;
and, in deſpite of all the menaces that had
been thrown out againſt their family, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
on one of her ſiſters to accompany me."</p>
            <p>"I ſaw her!—but ſhe did not know me.—Her
eyes were caſt down; ſhe was pale and
thin—reſignation and patience ſeemed to have
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0206900204:284"/>
ſoftened the horrors of her deſtiny—but they
gave to her faded beauty an intereſt ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that I never loved her ſo ardently as that
moment—I would have forced myſelf through
the grate, which was one of thoſe that are ſo
narrow as ſcarcely to admit an hand.—I threw
myſelf againſt it—I ſpoke to her—ſhe then
knew me, and caught hold of the bars to ſave
herſelf from falling—I kiſſed her hand in the
wildeſt tranſ orts—I beſought her to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that her vows were not—could not be bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either in the ſight of God or man!—that ſhe
was my wife; and that againſt the infamousty.
ranny that had divided us, all nature revolted."
Thus I raved, while tears, ſuch as angels ſhed,
fell from her lovely eyes—"Oh! Bellegarde,"
ſaid ſhe, when ſhe was able to ſpeak, "This
is all vain and frantic rage!—learn, my dear,
dear friend, to ſubmit, as I do, to a fate,
which, cruel as it is, is inevitable—I am
dead to you!—for from hence, no power, no
force, can now releaſe me—ah! they told me
you were no more—or never, never would I
have taken thoſe vows, which my heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed!—But
it is done!—and this ſhort mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is the laſt we ſhall ever have!"—At this
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0206900204:285"/>
inſtant the ſuperior of the convent, and ſeveral
nuns appeared, and ſeverely reproaching her,
forced her from the grate—"Inhuman,"
ſaid ſhe,—"even this laſt moment is denied
me!—farewell, my dear Bellegarde—farewell
for ever—believe I am dead; and transfer
the tenderneſs you felt for your Jacquelina—to
her little Anzoletta—in her I ſtill live."
This ſentence was hardly articulate, amid the
efforts her perſecutors made to force her away—when
I loſt ſight of her, again I threw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
frantically againſt the grate that divided,
I beat my head againſt it—fury and deſpair
poſſeſſed me anew—and I became, for ſome
days, again inſenſible—or ſenſible to nothing
but the ſight of my little girl, whoſe innocent
ſmiles appeaſed my rage, and made me recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
that there was yet a being in the world for
whom I ought to live.</p>
            <p>"Every calm interval was employed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
more wild, perhaps, than my wildeſt
ravings; to force Jacquelina from her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
impriſonment. I talked about it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
to her brothers, and perſuaded my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
that nothing was impoſſible to a man ſo
injured, and ſo attached as I was. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0206900204:286"/>
however, was too powerful in a province,
where he was governor, and in a community
into which he had influence to get Jacquelina
received, notwithſtanding her reſiſtance, and
even her marriage. At this time, power did
every thing in France, and nature and juſtice
were ſilenced—thank God it is ſo no longer!"</p>
            <p>In this ejaculation, Willoughby moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
joined, and the Count proceeded:—</p>
            <p>"My father, as I was about to obſerve, was
too well ſerved to leave me any probability of
ſucceſs in this mad project; far from being
able to procure the liberty of my wife, I could
Rot preſerve my own—but was, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of my inſanity, carried away a priſoner
from Perpignan; and the only favor the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
could obtain for me was, that I might be
confined in his houſe in Normandy.—Here I
remained only a ſhort time, ſunk again into
the impotent fullenneſs of deſpair, when the
regiment, to which I belonged, was ordered to
America, and my father deſired I might go.
I wiſhed for death—and had I had any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to deſire life, my honour compelled me
not to heſitate. For America then I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked;
and on my arrival, my firſt care was
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0206900204:287"/>
to enquire for the Engliſh regiment, in which
my friend Ormond had a company. I heard,
from deſerters, that it had ſuffered greatly in
the beginning of the war, and was ordered
back to England. Even the mournful ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
which I had promiſed myſelf in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
my friend, the huſband of my beloved
unfortunate Genevieve, ſeemed thus to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
me; and every circumſtance contributed
to promote that deſperation, that impatience
of life, which is the effect of incurable cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>"Before I left France, I had recommended
my infant Anzoletta to the care of the Baron,
in caſe of my death, and ſecured to her all the
property that would be at my diſpoſal, on the
death of my father. I thought, that were
Jacquelina dead, I ſhould think of her with
leſs painful regret, than I did now; languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
within the walls of a monaſtery; of my
natural friends, only the Baron, and D'Erme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonville,
affected to feel any intereſt in my
fate: the former was now deeply engaged in
the duties of his profeſſion as a ſoldier; and for
the latter, he was decidedly a diſciple of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus—and
made it a rule of his life to enjoy
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0206900204:288"/>
every poſſible pleaſure, and avoid every poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pain—of courſe, my loſs would be but
ſlightly felt by either of my brothers—and
my father—for ſo many years my perſecutor
and tyrant, would rejoice at it. I continually
ſought death as my only refuge againſt the evils
he had inflicted upon me; and what was
called bravery, was, in fact, deſpair.</p>
            <p>"In one of the rencontres which our troops
and the revolted Americans had with the
Engliſh army, it was my chance to be ſtationed
to defend a ſmall poſt on the borders of an
immenſe wood, with a ſmall detachment of
French. The engagement was warm between
the main bodies; but the troops, under my
command, were not called into the action.
Impatient to be thus idle, I ſent one of my
aid-de-camps to the general, repreſenting,
that we were abſolutely uſeleſs where we were,
and entreating his leave to advance; when he
returned and told me, that the battle was
over with diſputed ſucceſs; that the Engliſh
had ſuffered greatly, particularly in their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers;
while the Americans and French,
hardly in a better condition, were making
their retreat, which I was directed to cover
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0206900204:289"/>
with my freſh troops. I advanced, therefore,
through the wood by the way I was directed;
and after proceeding half a mile, I met a party
of Indians, in the intereſt of the coloniſts, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
with them an Engliſh officer, who was,
they ſaid, mortally wounded. By his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
he appeared to be of rank—I approached
him, and ſpoke to him in French. Judge of
my ſenſations, when I ſaw in this dying pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
my friend, my Ormond!—Not even the
calls of duty were ſo preſſing as thoſe of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.—I
even deliberated a moment, whether
I ſhould not hazard every thing to attend him
myſelf—but when I expreſſed this, though he
could hardly ſpeak, he conjured me to go on,
and merely to take him out of the hands of
the Indians.—"I know I muſt die," ſaid the
gallant fellow, "but I would die in your hands—if
you can, without injury to your honour,
grant me ſuch an indulgence." I ordered a
guard to convey him, with the utmoſt care,
to the neareſt French quarters; and then
haſtening to obey the orders I had received, I
had the happineſs, ſucceſsfully, to execute
them; and having done ſo, hurried to my
friend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0206900204:290"/>
"I found he had received every aſſiſtance
which in the ſituation we then were, could be
given him: he was eaſy, and though his
wounds were mortal, his death was not likely
to happen immediately.</p>
            <p>"He thanked me, as ſoon as he again ſaw
me, for my attention to him—and then eagerly
aſked me after his wife—and his child—"but
ſhe is dead," cried he—"my Genevieve is
dead; I was but too certain of that before
I left Europe."—My ſilence, my tears, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
the ſad truth. "Well, my dear
Chevalier," cried he, clinging my hand, "I
am following her faſt—I knew what you would
tell me of my infant—of that dear pledge
of my Genevieve's affection. Your inhuman
father has eluded your ſearch, as he did mine.
Oh! I could curſe him!—but I will not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is your father. If ever your friendly
ſolicitude for the offspring of your ſiſter, and
your friend, ſhould enable you to diſcover
her, give her theſe pictures—they are thoſe of
her father—of his favourite ſiſter;—of her
mother—ſee," added he,—"this reſemblance
of Genevieve which ſhe gave me, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the dear avowal of her love; never till
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0206900204:291"/>
now has it left my boſom—and I conjure
you, Bellegarde, never to part with it, till
you place it on that of my daughter.</p>
            <p>"My noble friend lingered a few days longer—not
in great pain, however, and perfectly
ſenſible—and then, in my arms, he reſigned
his gallant ſpirit to his God.</p>
            <p>"This loſs added ſtrength to the gloomy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
I had before made to die. Among
my friend's papers, which, by his order, his
ſervant delivered to me, after his death, I
found a narrative of all he had done, after his
releaſe from impriſonment in the Baſtile, at
the demand of the Engliſh ambaſſador (for
he was there part of the time that I was,
though we never ſaw each other,) to gain ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
to his wife, and to have his child
reſtored to him—and ſuch an abhorrence did
this add to that I had already conceived
againſt my father, that I could not bear the
name of Bellegarde; nor endure to think of
returning to breathe the ſame air with a man
whom I conſidered as a monſter.</p>
            <p>"To France, however, I returned—without
even a wound in all the hazards to which I had
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0206900204:292"/>
voluntarily expoſed myſelf. This inhuman
father was ſtill living—but my brother, the
Baron de Rochemarte, had fallen at the head
of his regiment, at the attack made on the
iſland of Jerſey—and I ſucceeded to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune—a
fortune, which, ample as it was,
could make me no amends for the excellent
kind brother I had loſt.</p>
            <p>"Alas! I had loſt two brothers—and two
friends equally dear to me—they were not to
be recalled—but I ſtill found a gloomy kind
of ſatisfaction in complying with their laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.
That of my brother de Rochemarte
was, that I would take his name; and moſt
willingly I quitted that of Bellegarde—the
dying requeſt of my beloved friend I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured—ah!
how vainly endeavoured to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil—I
never could diſcover his daughter till
this fortunate day!</p>
            <p>"But my reſidence among the Americans,
had awakened in my mind a ſpirit of freedom.
The miſeries, the irreparable injuries I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from ill-placed and exorbitant power,
prompted me to aſſert it. I was now poſſeſſed
of conſiderable property—uſeleſs to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0206900204:293"/>
Jacquelina could not ſhare it—though
comparatively free myſelf, I was wretched.
In this diſpoſition, it may eaſily be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
that if I poſſeſſed the power, I was not
without inclination to add fewel to that fire,
which immediately after the end of the war in
America, was kindled, though it yet burnt
but feebly in France. I wrote—I acted upon
my newly-acquired principles, with the energy
of a ſufferer, and with the reſolution of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.
I <hi>was</hi> already the martyr of deſpotiſm,
and ruined in my happineſs for ever. I knew
that all the vengeance I could excite could
injure me no farther.</p>
            <p>"I now ſaw Jacquelina—but ſhe was ſtill
pining within her convent.—I ſaw my child—I
held her to the grate while her mother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed
her little hands with tears, which I
kiſſed off!—It was a ſcene to move every heart
but ſuch as inhabited the breaſt of my father!
Again, the hopeleſſneſs of reſcuing my wife
from her cruel bonds, gave him occaſion to
put other fetters on me. In the raſhneſs of
my deſperation, I ſaid, I wrote, I acted ſuch
things as made me be conſidered by govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0206900204:294"/>
as a dangerous perſon. My father took
advantage of my raſhneſs—he repreſented me
as being diſordered in my ſenſes, and obtained
an order for ſhutting me up in the fortreſs of
Mont St. Michel.</p>
            <p>"Between four and five years had I been a
captive in that gloomy priſon, when the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
flame of liberty, of which I only ſaw the
firſt feeble rays, burſt forth—I regained my
perſonal fredom, when my country became
free—I found my father dead!—Every thing
he could give away, his wife poſſeſſed, but
this, and ſome other of his eſtates, were mine—and
D'Ermenonville gave me, with the
hands which then gave the title of Bellegarde,
the name, which I abhor; and which, though
it is yet given me by the people, who have
been accuſtomed to give it to the head of my
family, I will not keep—but take that of
Montignac, which is my <hi>untitled</hi> name, the
original deſignation of our family.</p>
            <p>"The firſt uſe I made now of the general and
particular freedom, in which I rejoiced, was
to fly to Perpignan—but the moment is not
yet come, when I can deliver my impriſoned
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0206900204:295"/>
Jacquelina. I am, however, aſſured, that ſhe
will very ſoon be reſtored to me; in that hope
I came hither to attend to my long-neglected
affairs, and to enjoy the ſociety of my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Even greater happineſs has been the
conſequence of my abode here than I dared to
hope; for by you, my friend, towards whom,
the moment I ſaw you, I was impelled by an
invincible propenſity, I ſhall, I truſt, recover
the dear orphan child of Genevieve and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</p>
            <p>"In a few days I ſhall go back to Perpignan;
leave Anzoletta again in the care of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
family, and then haſten to aſſiſt in the
glorious buſineſs of ſecuring the liberty of
France—yes!—the immortal work of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
myriads yet unborn from ever ſuffering
the oppreſſions, under which I have groaned."</p>
            <p>Here the Count de Bellegarde ended his nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative;
and Willoughby, with an inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
contrariety of ſenſations—joy and hope—fear
and apprehenſion—being furniſhed with
every aſſurance he could wiſh, of the real pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of Celeſtina, took a tender leave of the
Count and Anzoletta, whoſe voice was to him
as the voice of a ſeraph, promiſing him feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0206900204:296"/>
to come, and he then departed, as had
been agreed upon between him and the Count,
for Perpignan: where he delivered, at the
grate, a letter to Jacquelina—of whom the
Count had deſired that ſhe would deſcribe to
Willoughby any particulars of the perſon of
his wife, which ſhe recollected—for in her
care, the infant Celeſtina had been left a few
weeks.</p>
            <p>With trembling impatience Willoughby
waited while the intereſting, and ſtill lovely
nun peruſed this letter—and heard her, while
his heart ſunk with apprehenſion, thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
the child of her unfortunate friend—</p>
            <p>"She was," ſaid Jacquelina, "fairer than
my child, and her features greatly reſembled
thoſe of her father.—On her neck, a little on
the left ſide, were three remarkable, though
diminutive, moles."—"It is enough," ſaid
Willoughby—"thoſe moles are on the lovely
neck of Celeſtina—a thouſand times have I
kiſſed them as we played together in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy—and
here on this portrait of her, drawn
when ſhe was about twelve years old, they are
deſcribed."</p>
            <p>Jacquelina kiſſed the picture,—"Little as
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0206900204:297"/>
can be judged from a likeneſs done ſo many
years afterwards, I feel an aſſurance," ſaid
ſhe, "that this is the picture of my Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieve's
child. May heaven grant her thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
which, in its unſearchable decrees, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to my lovely, luckleſs friend." Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
who would not have been a moment
détained by any interview leſs intereſting, or
leſs neceſſary, now took his leave, and with
the utmoſt expedition, though all he could
make, anſwered but ill to his impatience, he
haſtened on towards England.</p>

            <p>WHILE theſe things paſſed at Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marte,
Celeſtina, no longer doubting of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby's
marriage, and entire deſertion of
her, was trying to acquire once more that
calm reſignation, which ſhe had ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to adopt, and ſo often loſt.—Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague
Thorold accompanied Lady Horatia
to Cheltenham; where, as Celeſtina foreſaw,
his ardent entreaties, and the wiſhes of her
friend, ſo ſtrongly enforcing them, gave her
ſo much pain, that ſhe grew, hourly more
fond of the ſchcme ſhe had adopted, of
travelling. If ſhe found it difficult to evade
the importunities of her lover, and her bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factreſs,
ſhe dreaded yet more the arrival of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0206900204:299"/>
the elder Mr. Thorold; who, about ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weeks
after Montague's recovery, came with
him (after a ſhort viſit he had paid at home)
to Cheltenham.</p>
            <p>He ſoon found an opportunity of ſpeaking
to Celeſtina, alone, and then ſhe became more
than ever conſcious of the influence that
his ſolid underſtanding, his excellent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and his tender regard for her, gave
him over her ingenuous mind.—Though he
never complained, ſhe well knew, that he
was not happy in the other branches of his
family, and that his hopes were particularly
fixed on his younger ſon, whoſe attachment
to Celeſtina, which, had it been ſucceſsful,
might have ſecured, in one point, the felicity
of his father, had hither to produced for him
only anxiety and ſolicitude.</p>
            <p>He had ſeen his life once more in immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
hazard, from the fierce and impetuous
Vavaſour, and from his own raſhneſs, which
he could not but condemn; he had ſeen,
for many months, all his talents, and almoſt
all his affections, loſt and abſorbed in this
one predominant paſſion, and he knew not
what the effect might be on his intellects,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0206900204:300"/>
and on his health, ſhould he finally be refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
yet, while Willoughby was uncertain as
to his own ſituation, or unmarried, the elder
Mr. Thorold had been withheld from making
any efforts with Celeſtina, on behalf of his
ſon: now, thoſe impediments were removed,
he no longer thought himſelf reſtrained from
applying to her himſelf. So mildly and
rationally, however, he entered on this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
that Celeſtina retained more courage,
while ſhe heard him, than ſhe, at its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement,
had dared to expect; and when
he had recapitulated all the advantages which
might, he thought, be derived, from her
union with a man ſo paſſionately devoted to
her, of ſuitable age; of eaſy fortune—one
whoſe taſte was congenial to her own; whoſe
temper was remarkably good, and who had
a heart uncorrupted by vice, and unexhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a long courſe of intrigue; and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
who would conſider her admiſſion into it,
as the greateſt bleſſing that they could receive;
Celeſtina acknowledged it was all very true.
"I own too, Sir," ſaid ſhe, "that to many
people, and perhaps to you, I may have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to give your ſon ſuch encouragement,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0206900204:301"/>
as never ought to be given, unleſs it is meant
to end in marriage.—I have felt, without
having it in my power to avoid this ſeeming
impropriety—yet he will do me the juſtice
to ſay, I have always told him, that whatever
were my ſentiments in his favour, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I wiſhed to encourage thoſe ſentiments,
becauſe I was perſuaded he deſerved them,
yet, that my heart never felt for him that
decided preference, without which, I cannot
believe, he could be happy, were I to give
him my hand—I was too ſure, that from an
unfortunate prepoſſeſſion, in favour of another,
it never could feel this preference; and that,
therefore, though I ſhould always be happy
to be conſidered as his friend, I never would
be his wife. Allow me, dear Sir, to repeat
to you, a reſolution from which I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
I ſhall ever recede—you know how true
a love and veneration I have for you—there
is not on earth, a man whom I would ſo ſoon
chuſe to ſupply to me that ſacred and tender
relationſhip I have never known! and to call
by the endearing name of father! but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not—indeed
I cannot marry. I know not
why, but ſome invincible perſuaſion hangs
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0206900204:302"/>
over me, that if I do, I ſhall be miſerable,
and render my huſband miſerable, whatever
may be his merit or affection—and can I,
ought I, under ſuch a conviction, to wiſh it?
Be aſſured, that if time and reaſon conquer
this weakneſs—for perhaps it may be only
weakneſs—if ever I feel that I can give to
your ſon a heart, weaned from every other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment,
and worthy of his, I will ſay ſo—as
candidly, as I declare the impoſſibility of
my doing ſo now—and you are ſo liberal, that
you will forgive my weakneſs, and ſave me,
I am ſure, from importunity, which is the
more diſtreſſing, as it comes from thoſe I ſo
much eſteem, and whoſe wiſhes it would be,
on any other ſubject, my pride and my pleaſure
obey."</p>
            <p>Mr. Thorold, after this converſation, and
ſome other of the ſame nature, was convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that Celeſtina acted from motives of the
moſt delicate honour—the more he ſaw of her
heart and diſpoſition, the more fondly he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
attached to her; and the more ardently
deſired that ſhe might become the wife of his
ſon. He ſaw, that though her ideas were
what would be generally called romantic, they
were not cheriſhed merely becauſe they were
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0206900204:303"/>
ſo; but that a high ſenſe of the tender duty
ſhe wiſhed to pay to the man with whom ſhe
was to paſs her life, made it impoſſible for
her to enter into ſuch engagements till ſhe
was ſure of fulfilling them according to her
own ideas—and he hoped, that her entire ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from Willoughby; his unkindneſs
and neglect on one hand; and on the other,
the acknowledged merit of his ſon, would,
though almoſt inſenſibly, yet not ſlowly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
that change which ſhe allowed herſelf to
be poſſible, though at preſent it did not ſeem
probable. In this hope he was contented to
reſt; and promiſing Celeſtina, that if ſhe
would ſtill allow Montague to ſee her fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
he ſhould not teize her by importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity—he
threw himſelf entirely on her gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity
and ſincerity; and after a viſit of near a
week, he left Montague at Cheltenham, by the
deſire of Lady Horatia, and returned home.</p>
            <p>In a few days after his departure, Celeſtina
had another and more painful ſcene to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.
Cathcart arrived early one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and eagerly aſked to ſpeak to her—ſhe
went down to him immediately—but when
ſhe ſaw him, ſhe dared not aſk the purpoſe of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0206900204:304"/>
a viſit ſo little expected. He was pale—he
trembled and heſitated—he looked fatigued
and dejected.—Willoughby inſtantly recurred
to her—for he was always the firſt object of
her thoughts—"Is any thing the matter, dear
Cathcart," ſaid ſhe "with Willoughby?"—"Oh,
no," replied he; "nothing new—I
have not heard of him ſince he went, which
I think ſtrange."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina ſighed, and thought ſhe was able
too well to account for it—"but is Jeſſy"
well? "Yes, thank Heaven," replied he:
"but my ſiſter"—"what, Mrs. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone?"
"no my other—my unfortunate
ſiſter Emily—I have been ſent for to her at
Briſtol, where, you know I went to her ſome
time ſince, at your entreaty: ſhe has now, I
think, only a few days to live—my ſiſter
Elphinſtone is with her—poor Emily wiſhes
to ſee you—I know not how to aſk ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of you; but you are <hi>ſo</hi> good—will you—can
you oblige a family—who already owe
to you all the happineſs they poſſeſs?"</p>
            <p>"What will I not do to give any part of
it ſatisfaction," ſaid Celeſtina—"but do you,
can you gueſs the reaſon of your ſiſter's wiſhes
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0206900204:305"/>
to ſee me? ſurely Vavaſour is not there?—"He
was not, when I left her; but a few
days before, he had been at Briſtol, raving
like a madman at the fatal intelligence he had
then had confirmed—that Emily could not
live. If, however, he ſhould come, you can
have nothing to fear, for I will not leave you
a moment; and I know you ſo well, that I
am perſuaded, there are few diſagreeable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
which would not, to you, be
compenſated, by the reflection of having given
comfort to the laſt moments of my dying
Emily."</p>
            <p>This plea Celeſtina could not reſiſt: ſhe
went, therefore, by the conſent of Lady Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratia,
with Cathcart, to Briſtol; where a ſcene
awaited her, that for ſome time almoſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
even her thoughts of Willoughby
himſelf.</p>
            <p>The lovely, unhappy victim, to early ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
was in the laſt ſtage of a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—and,
unlike thoſe who are cut off by that
diſtemper, was perfectly aware, and perfectly
reconciled to her fate—her earneſt wiſhes had
been to be forgiven by Cathcart, and to die
in the arms of her ſiſter; they both now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0206900204:306"/>
her with the tendereſt affection, and
had even yielded to her requeſt, to be allowed
to ſee Vavaſour, towards whom all her anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was now turned, and for his happineſs ſhe
felt that concern, which ſhe no longer was
ſenſible of for herſelf.</p>
            <p>Her exhauſted heart was, from gratitude
and habit attached to Vavaſour; and ſhe ſaw
that her death would take away the only tie
that had been ſome reſtraint on his ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
licentiouſneſs: that his diſappointment
in regard to Celeſtina, had embittered his
temper; and given him a ſort of excuſe for
the libertiniſm in which he ſeemed reſolute to
perſevere; and while his good qualities, his
generoſity, and his candour, as well as his
attentive tenderneſs towards her, had made
her affection for him the laſt ſentiment ſhe was
capable of feeling: ſhe fancied it yet poſſible,
young as ſhe was, Celeſtina might be induced
to ſave a man who appeared ſo well worth the
attempt: and that, intereſting as he appeared
to her, he could not fail of having ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
with others, and particularly with one
who had learned from Willoughby an early
prejudice in his favour, which ſhe hoped all
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0206900204:307"/>
his ſubſequent raſhneſs had not yet wholly
deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Such were the views of Emily Cathcart, in
requeſting this viſit; and her beautiful eyes,
lit up with the fire that was conſuming her,
became yet more dazzlingly bright when her
lovely viſitor was led into the room by her
brother.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina entered trembling; and fearing
the ſight of Vavaſour, whom ſhe had never
met ſince the terrifying night at Ranelagh;
but the moment ſhe beheld Emily, ſhe no
longer thought of any thing but the affecting
object before her.</p>
            <p>Emily ſat in a great chair, ſupported by
pillows—the extreme beauty that had been
ſo fatal to its poſſeſſor, ſtill remained, though
its luſtre was gone—Emaciated, and of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
fairneſs, her hands and her face had a
tranſparency that gave an idea of an unembo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
ſpirit, and her dreſs was ſuch as favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the deception. The blood might almoſt
be ſeen to circulate in her veins, ſo plainly did
they appear; and her eyes had the dazzling ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diance
of ethereal fire, to which the hectic heat
of her glowing, though wafted countenance,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0206900204:308"/>
ſtill added.—A few locks of her fine light
hair had eſcaped from her head-dreſs; and
played like broken rays from a receding planet,
round a face, which only thoſe who had hearts
unhappily rigid, could behold, without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſenſe of her errors ſuſpended or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
by ſtrong emotions of the tendereſt
pity.</p>
            <p>She held out her hand to Celeſtina, as ſhe
entered, and in a voice faint and interrupted,
from the difficulty with which ſhe breathed,
ſaid—"Ah! deareſt madam, how good this
is; how worthy that tender and ſenſible heart,
of which I have heard ſo much"—ſhe ſtopped;
as if unable to ſpeak more at that moment,
and reſted her head againſt the chair—Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
affected to tears, ſat ſilently down near
her—Cathcart left the room.</p>
            <p>After a ſhort pauſe, ſhe recovered ſtrength
to ſay, "but a moment will be allowed
me, perhaps; let me then haſten to thank
you for this condeſcenſion, and to ſay,
how earneſtly it is my hope, that it will not
be made in vain; but that it will afford me
an opportunity of ſucceſsfully pleading—for
another penitent—for poor Vavaſour."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0206900204:309"/>
"I forgive him moſt willingly," cried Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina—"and
moſt ſincerely wiſh him
happy."</p>
            <p>"Ah, Madam!" ſaid Emily—"You muſt
then carry your generoſity farther—for you
only can make him ſo—I dared to repreſent
this in a letter to you—I now repeat it—vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,
as I am, even in the morning of my days,
I ſhould, however, die in peace, for I hope
my peace is made with Heaven—if I could
ſee any proſpect of Vavaſour's being happy;
reclaimed from that wild career where he is
now waſting his time, his fortune, and his
life. I owe him ſo many obligations! I know
him to have ſo good a heart! that it is terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to me to ſee him devoted as he is, and
plunging into an abyſs of miſery, from whence
it will ſoon be no longer in his power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.—It
has been a great conſolation to me,
that I have had ſome little influence in ſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the progreſs of the evil; but it is you
only who can ſave him from himſelf effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;
and how worthy would it be of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
of compaſſion like yours?"</p>
            <p>Celeſtina knew not what to anſwer.—To
promiſe what ſhe never, could perform, was
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0206900204:310"/>
little in her nature: yet did ſhe not love to
check the diſintereſted hope that thus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
the ſoft heart of the fair pleader. "I
believe," ſaid ſhe, after a ſhort pauſe, "I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you are miſtaken: and that I have no
ſuch power as you impute to me; be aſſured
that, though Mr. Vavaſour's conduct has
been to me a ſource of the moſt poignant
uneaſineſs, I not only will forget it, but ſhall
rejoice in ſeeing him happy—for his own
ſake—and for the ſake of that dear friend
through whoſe means we firſt became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted:
a friend"—her voice trembled, and
ſhe dared not attempt to name Willoughby,
leſt it ſhould wholly fail her—"a friend who
is ſtill, and who I dare believe will ever be
truly attached to him: and who, on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to England, will, I am ſure, uſe all the
influence that friendſhip gives him over Mr.
Vavaſour, to recal him from a way of life
you ſo much apprehend." She was proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to evade, as tenderly as ſhe could, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic
prayer ſhe had juſt heard, when Emily
was ſeized with one of thoſe ſpaſms which
announced her approaching death. Celeſtina,
terrified, called for Mrs. Elphinſtone; and,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0206900204:311"/>
unable to bear a ſcene in which ſhe could be
of no uſe, ſhe retired to another room, where
ſhe paſſed with Cathcart, two melancholy
hours, at the end of which, they heard that
the fair unhappy Emily was no more.</p>
            <p>Vavaſour, who was in another lodging at
the Hot-wells, no ſooner heard of this ſad
event, than the wildeſt frenzy poſſeſſed him:
nor did his having ſo long expected it, at all
mitigate the blow.—He ran to the houſe, and
regardleſs of Cathcart and Mrs. Elphinſtone,
who would have oppoſed theſe frantic ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of uſeleſs regret, he threw himſelf on
his knees by the bedſide—called to her, as
if ſhe were ſtill living—was ſure ſhe ſhould
not die—and now reproached Heaven that
ſhe was dead. From this ſtate of temporary
inſanity, nothing had the power to recal him—till
Cathcart, reproaching him very warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for the impropriety of his conduct, aſked
him, whether it was thus he meant to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the laſt wiſhes of his ſiſter, and obtain
the pardon of Miſs De Mornay? That name
had ſtill all its influence on the heart of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour:
by a ſtrange, though, perhaps, not
uncommon diviſion of his affections, at once
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0206900204:312"/>
vehemently loved the woman he had loſt, and
the woman he hoped to gain.—Starting from
his knees, he aſked where Celeſtina was? for
Cathcart had not yet told him of her arrival,
and had promiſed to prevent his diſtreſſing her.—"Miſs
De Mornay is below, Sir; but you
muſt not go to her." "Not go to her! who
ſhall prevent it?" was his anſwer—and he
haſtily went down ſtairs.</p>
            <p>When he entered the room where Celeſtina
ſat weeping with Mrs. Elphinſtone, he had
every appearance of a man out of his ſenſes:
but, at the ſight of her, he ſeemed ſubdued in
a moment; and while ſhe dreaded ſome wild
and frantic ſpeech, he threw himſelf on his
knees before her, and burſt into tears.</p>
            <p>His convulſive ſobs, as he eagerly caught
her hands, and preſſed them to his heart; and
the broken voice in which he attempted to
ſpeak, diſarmed her at once of all the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which ſhe had, till then, felt for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
behaviour, when they laſt met—and
ſo tenderly, in a voice of ſuch ſoothing
pity did ſhe ſpeak to him, that he ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
reaſonable—thanked her for her gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
attention; even bleſſing her, and calling
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0206900204:313"/>
her the reſtorer of his reaſon—while Celeſtina
availed herſelf of this diſpoſition of his mind,
to prevail on him to retire; which he did, on
her promiſe, that ſhe would ſee him again the
next day.</p>
            <p>After a mournful night, of which more
was paſſed in comforting and conſoling Mrs.
Elphinſtone than in ſleep, that day arrived,
on which Celeſtina was not only bound by
the promiſe which in the agitation of mind
ſhe was in the night before, ſhe had made to
Vavaſour, to ſee him; but induced to declare
to him again, how totally he was miſtaken
in ſuppoſing her engaged to Montague Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold.
Again he cheriſhed the hope which
ſhe never meant to revive; and at once to do,
what he knew would gratify her, while he
acquitted himſelf of the promiſe he had given
to his regretted Emily, he had a deed drawn
up and executed, by which he gave to Mrs.
Elphinſtone, and her children, two hundred
a year; and ſettled them at the houſe he had
in Devonſhire. On the moment of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
he gave this deed to Celeſtina, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
her not to open it till her arrival at
Cheltenham. "And whither are you going,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0206900204:314"/>
Mr. Vavaſour?" ſaid Celeſtina, who felt her
pity revive for him, now that ſhe ſaw him ſo
dejected and ſubdued. "Ah," replied he, "I
am careleſs whither—I cannot, however, go
back to my Staffordſhire houſe in the ſtate of
mind I am in now; for I ſhould infallibly
hang myſelf;—I believe I ſhall go to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don—for,
even at this time of year, a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
dog, ſuch as I am, may find ſomebody or
other to help them to get rid of themſelves;
and the gaming houſes are always open.—"The
gaming houſes!" ſaid Celeſtina.—"Aye,"
replied he, "I have been there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
of late when I have been curſedly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable—and
play has a momentary effect on
me, in making me forget other things. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
in wandering about London, I may
meet with ſome unſettled, unhappy fellow,
like myſelf, who may like to go abroad for
ſix or eight months: we may go find Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
perhaps, and my return may be the
more welcome to <hi>you,</hi> if I bring you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>him.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"Alas!" thought Celeſtina, "what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>him</hi> can I now hear with pleaſure;
unleſs indeed that he is well; that I always
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0206900204:315"/>
wiſh to hear! and I <hi>think,</hi>" added ſhe, her
heart ſwelling as ſhe ſaid it—"I think I ſhould
<hi>ſincerely</hi> rejoice to hear, that in his new ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—he
is happy with his <hi>wife!</hi>"</p>
            <p>Vavaſour, again feeling the renewal of that
hope which had almoſt eſcaped him, ſaw Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
depart with more calmneſs than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
Cathcart ſaw her ſafe in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of Lady Horatia, at Cheltenham; and
then returned to Briſtol, to perform the laſt ſad
offices to his loſt Emily; Vavaſour, at his
and Mrs. Elphinſtone's requeſt, leaving the
place before her remains were conſigned to
their early grave.</p>
            <p>The ſcenes which, during this period, paſſed
in the family of Lord Caſtlenorth, were more
turbulent, and to ſome of the parties equally
melancholy.</p>
            <p>The anxious peer, whoſe health was, as
uſual, a little amended by change of country,
waited at Paris the promiſed arrival of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
with extreme impatience: impatience
which had ſuch an effect upon his feeble frame,
that death, which had ſo long been laying in
wait for him, now ſeized him, and at a period,
when the blow ſaved him from knowing what
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0206900204:316"/>
could not have been concealed from him many
hours. Lady Caſtlenorth having enacted with
great dignity all that a mournful relict <hi>muſt</hi>
do on ſuch an occaſion: and Miſs Fitz-Hayman
having alſo performed her part ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably,
the will was opened in due form,
of which Lady Caſtlenorth thought herſelf
perfectly ſure of the contents; and ſhe had
indeed ſecured to herſelf a great deal of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and a ſplendid income, beſides her ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement.
The property deſcending to Miſs
Fitz-Hayman, immediately, was about eight
thouſand a year; but, in a codicil (made in
the immediate pleaſure he received when
Willoughby firſt declared himſelf reſolved to
marry his couſin) he had given him an eſtate
of five-and-twenty hundred a year; and ten
thouſand pounds in money, as a nuptial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
without, however, affixing any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the gift.</p>
            <p>The ſhort ceremony of reading the will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over, another was to be gone through
leſs eaſy to Miſs Fitz-Hayman; which was,
announcing to her mother her actual marriage
with Captain Cavanaugh—which ſhe thought
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0206900204:317"/>
muſt otherwiſe be revealed by ſomebody
elſe.</p>
            <p>The dialogue was ſhort, but deciſive—Miſs
Fitz-Hayman, or rather Mrs. Cavanaugh,
had more courage than tenderneſs; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now nothing to fear from her mother's
influence with her father; and ſecure of her
fortune, both at preſent and in reverſion, ſhe
aſſumed rather an air of triumph than of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition.
Lady Caſtlenorth would be but
faintly deſcribed by the ſtrongeſt of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
that have been given of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
woman, when ſhe has been compared
to a tygreſs robbed of her young.—Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naugh
had poſſeſſed the art to make her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that his admiration of her mental per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
was the foundation of that attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he felt for her; yet, that while he ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her beautiful mind, her fine perſon was an
object of tender admiration. To find that he
cared for neither the one nor the other; but
had availed himſelf of her credulity to obtain
a footing in the family; and money to get his
matrimonial fetters broken, that he might
marry her daughter, were convictions ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0206900204:318"/>
mortifying to her pride, that they,
for a while, ſuſpended the power of expreſſing
her rage—When, however, that power return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſhe raved like a lunatic—gave way to the
moſt extravagant ſallies of paſſion—and,
though her Lord was yet unburied, proteſted
that the ſame houſe ſhould no longer hold her
and her "pelican daughter." Mrs. Cavanaugh
was more calm, and retired to her room:
where Mrs. Calder, at length, perſuaded Lady
Caſtlenorth to let her ſtay till after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of her father were ſent forward to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
which they were in a few days; and
then Mrs. Cavanaugh ſet out, by the way of
Rouen, to England alſo, with her huſband,
who was impatient to take poſſeſſion of his
great acquiſitions, the price of ſo much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
perfidy.—Though he would willingly
have been excuſed giving to Willoughby even
the ſmall ſhare of the ample property which
his uncle had aſſigned to him; yet he knew
he muſt ſee the will, and finally obtain it. He
thought it better, therefore, to continue with
him the appearance of honour; and therefore
wrote to him, informing him of Lord Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north's
death; of his own marriage; and the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0206900204:319"/>
codicil in favour of Mr. Willoughby. But
not knowing whither to direct this letter; for
Willoughby had left no intimation of the
route he meant to purſue, when he quitted
Paris; he addreſſed it to Alveſtone; where,
with one on the ſame buſineſs from Lady
Caſtlenorth, it lay, while Willoughby was
wandering among the Pyrenian mountains,

            <p>UNCONSCIOUS of the good that awaited
him, and dreading the evil that might be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable,
Willoughby landed at Brighthelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
from Dieppe. Though it was eleven
o'clock when he got on ſhore, he ordered
poſt-horſes to be inſtantly ready; and uſed
the moment he waited for them to take a ſlight
refreſhment. On the table of the room he
was in, a newſpaper lay—it was long ſince he
had ſeen an Engliſh newſpaper—and he took
it up, where the firſt article that ſtruck him
was an account of the funeral of Lord Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north,
after his having lain in ſtate at his
houſe in town.</p>
            <p>Willoughby felt an immediate impreſſion
of concern for his uncle, and feared leſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment
ſhould have haſtened his death.
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0206900204:321"/>
On himſelf. or any advantage he might derive
from the event, he never beſtowed a thought;
but as the mind, under the influence of any
predominant paſſion, returns immediately to
its bias, however temporally diverted from it,
it almoſt inſtantly occurred to him, that if his
uncle had been ſo long dead without his
knowing it, Celeſtina might poſſibly have
been as long married. Trembling, he looked
among the marriages, but there were no
names there at all reſembling thoſe which he
dreaded to ſee united.—His chaiſe was ready,
and he departed for London; for it was there
only that he was likely to gain intelligence of
Lady Horatia Howard, and he knew of no
other clue to guide him to Celeſtina.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina had left Cheltenham with her
friend, and was now at Exmouth, where Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague
Thorold was continually with them.—Whether
he was preſent or abſent, Celeſtina
was equally penſive and melancholy; but it
was only in the latter caſe, that ſhe attempted
to indulge thoſe ſenſations in the ſolitary walks
which the ſea-ſhore afforded her: for ſhe
avoided as much as poſſible being quite alone
with him, becauſe her heart every day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0206900204:322"/>
her in the opinion that ſhe never could
love another man as ſhe had loved Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and it was diſtreſſing to her to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
under the neceſſity of repeating, what
it inflicted ſuch pain on her impaſſioned and
indefatigable lover to hear. It was now late
in September: the evenings ſoon ſhut in; and,
when there happened not to be a ſupply of
new books, Lady Horatia often engaged
Montague Thorold at piquet, while Celeſtina
ſat by them at work; or, if ſhe could be ſure
he was ſo occupied as not to be able to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
her, ſhe walked out alone, and as the
moon trembled on the waves, recollected the
nights when, with Willoughby and Matilda, in
the early days of their innocent friendſhip,
they uſed to mark and admire together this
beautiful appearance of the ſea illuminated by
the moon.—Here, on this very ſpot, ſhe had
with him beheld it—The waves had now the
ſame trembling brilliancy; the ſurrounding
objects were the ſame; but Willoughby was
changed: and happineſs and Celeſtina were,
ſhe thought, parted for ever.</p>
            <p>Such were her contemplations one evening<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
when, towards the end of the month, and of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0206900204:323"/>
Lady Horatia's intended ſtay at the place, ſhe
left the company who were aſſembled at the
lodgings; and who happened to be the elder
Mr. Thorold, his wife, their ſon Montague,
and Mr. and Mrs. Bettenſon, who being on a
viſit to the elder Mr. Thorold, when he was
ordered to the ſea for his health, had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
him all together to Exmouth, and were
ſhewn every attention by Lady Horatia, as the
relations of her favourite Montague.</p>
            <p>They were at cards; and Celeſtina, who
never played, took the opportunity of her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer's
being engaged at a whiſt table, from
which ſhe knew he could not immediately
eſcape, to go out—The wind was high, and
the ſea boiſterous; it was growing dark, and
ſhe fancied a particular gloom hung over every
object—ſtill, however, it was luxury to her
to be alone; ſhe was particularly wearied by
the converſation of Mr. Thorold; and found
nothing in that of Mrs. Bettenſon to make her
amends: Bettenſon was ignorant inſipidity it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and time, inſtead of adding to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his ideas, ſeemed to have rendered him,
if poſſible, more ſtupid—Amid ſuch ſociety,
ſhe could derive no pleaſure from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0206900204:324"/>
of Mr. Thorold and Lady Horatia;
and the unuſual weight ſhe felt on her ſpirits
ſeemed leſſened, when ſhe could ſigh at liberty—and
hear nothing around her but the wind,
or the ſea breaking againſt the ſhore.</p>
            <p>She had not, however, been out long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the chill and gloomy appearance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed;
and darkneſs coming on, ſhe ſlowly
and reluctantly returned to the houſe—She
heard, a little before ſhe quitted the road,
horſes behind her; but not attending to them,
ſhe did not even diſtinguiſh whether they were
the horſes of the people of the place, or thoſe
of travellers. She entered the parlour, and
ſat down by the card table, where Montague
Thorold, having performed his evening's taſk,
had juſt reſigned his place to Mr. Bettenſon.
Suddenly a voice was heard in the paſſage,
enquiring for Lady Horatia Howard of her
ſervant—"My lady is within, Sir," replied the
man—"And who are with her"—"Mr. and
Mrs. Thorold, and"—The ſervant was
going on—when the enquirer ſaid vehemently—"It
is enough—let me however ſee them."
Celeſtina, at the firſt ſound of this voice, had
ſtarted from her chair—The ſecond ſentence
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0206900204:325"/>
it uttered affected her ſtill more; but ſhe had
no time to anſwer the eager enquiry of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague
Thorold—"What is the matter?"—before
the parlour door opened; and pale,
breathleſs—with an expreſſion to which only
the pencil can do juſtice, ſhe ſaw before her
the figure of Willoughby.</p>
            <p>There was agony and deſperation in his
looks. He gaſped—he would have ſpoken,
but could not. The company all roſe in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
Lady Horatia, who hardly knew him
even by ſight, looked at Celeſtina for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation,
which ſhe was unable to give—At
length Willoughby, as if by an effort of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
phrenzy, approached Celeſtina—and
ſaid, in a hurried and inarticulate way, "I
would ſpeak to you, Madam—though—to—this
gentleman, I ſuppoſe," and he turned to
Montague Thorold, "I muſt apply for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion."</p>
            <p>His manner, his look, as wildly he caſt his
eyes around and ſaw all the family of the
Thorolds aſſembled, which confirmed his idea
of her being married, contributed to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
Celeſtina with terror and amazement.
She no more doubted of his marriage with his
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0206900204:326"/>
couſin, than he did of hers; and could not
conjecture why he came, or why he looked
ſo little in his ſenſes—She ſat down—for her
limbs refuſed to ſupport her—and faintly
ſaid, or rather tried to ſay, "I hope I ſee Mr.
Willoughby well."</p>
            <p>Lady Horatia then addreſſed herſelf to him—deſired
him to take a chair, and to do her
the honour of ſtaying ſupper with her.—He
heard or heeded her not—but, with fixed eyes,
gazing on Celeſtina, he ſtruck his hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and cried—while the violence of his
emotion choaked him.—"It is all over then—I
have loſt her—and have nothing to do
here—No, by heaven, I cannot bear it"—He
then turned away, and left the room as haſtily
as lie had entered it.</p>
            <p>"My dear Celeſtina," cried Lady Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
"what does all this mean? Do, Mr.
Montague—for Miſs De Mornay is, I ſee,
much alarmed—Do, ſpeak to Mr. Willoughby—I
am really concerned to ſee him in ſuch
a ſituation."</p>
            <p>"No;" ſaid Celeſtina, who would not for
the world have had Montague Thorold follow
him—"No; I will go myſelf after him"—
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0206900204:327"/>
Her fears now gave her reſolution, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
heeding Montague Thorold, who would
have prevented her, ſhe hurried after Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
and overtook him juſt as he was
quitting the houſe.</p>
            <p>"Dear Sir," ſaid ſhe, "dear Willoughby!"—At
thoſe well known ſounds, once ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to him, he turned round—She took his
hand—"I am very ſorry to ſee you," continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhe, "in ſuch agitations of ſpirits—I greatly
fear—perhaps—" ſome miſery between him
and his ſuppoſed wife occurred to her—"I
am afraid ſomething is wrong—"</p>
            <p>"Wrong!" cried he; "Wrong!—and
do you, Celeſtina, inhuman Celeſtina, inſult me
with ſuch an enquiry?—Wrong!—am I not
the moſt curſed of human beings?—"</p>
            <p>"I hope not," interrupted ſhe—"for your
happineſs"—She knew no longer what ſhe
meant to ſay; nor did he give her time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect;
for, eagerly rivetting his eyes on her
face, and graſping her hands between his—he
cried—"My happineſs!—and what of
my happineſs? Is it not gone, loſt, for ever—Have
you not deſtroyed it?—Damnation and
diſtraction—Why do I linger here?" He
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0206900204:328"/>
then plunged away, and ruſhed out of the
door, where Farnham waited with two poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſes—Celeſtina,
trembling, and attempting
to ſtop him, followed.</p>
            <p>He tried, however, to mount his horſe, but
could not: he deſiſted, leaned againſt it, with
his arm over the ſaddle, and reſting his head
on his arm: Farnham ſpoke, and Celeſtina
immediately recollected him. "What is the
matter with your maſter, Farnham?" ſaid ſhe,
"indeed he terrifies me to death!"—"Oh,
Ma'am," replied the honeſt fellow, ſorrowfully,
"my poor maſter! Come, Sir," added he,
interrupted by a look of anguiſh and horror
from Willoughby—"Come, dear Sir!—you
cannot ride any farther, I am perſuaded, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night;
let me lead you to the inn." Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
without reſiſtance, ſuffered Farnham
to lead him a ſtep or two; but he waved with
his hand for Celeſtina to leave him, and faintly
ſaid—"Go! go, Madam!—I wiſh you well!—I
wiſh you well!"—"Which is the way to
the inn?" cried Farnham.</p>
            <p>"Not to the inn—do not go to the inn,"
exclaimed Celeſtina; "you are very ill, dear
Willoughby; let us take care of you here;
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0206900204:329"/>
Lady Horatia requeſts it." Farnham led him
towards the door again; he leaned upon him,
and ſighed loudly and deeply. At length
he ſaid, "I am a fool!—I came hither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all I know <hi>now,</hi> and ought to have been
better prepared for it. But I am better: let
me then execute my laſt reſolution, and bid
her one long, one eternal adieu."</p>
            <p>There was a little vacant parlour near the
door; there Willoughby ſat down. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
who were aſſembled, brought candles:
Celeſtina ſtood ſilently by the table on which
they were placed; and Willoughby bid Farn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
leave the room.</p>
            <p>A ſhort ſilence enſued. Willoughby ſeemed
to be aſhamed of his weakneſs, and trying to
collect fortitude to bear like a man the cruelleſt
moment he had ever paſt, he aroſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
Celeſtina, ſaying in a low, grave,
and tremulous tone, "I have no right, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
to diſtreſs you—I have no juſt cauſe of
complaint againſt you—I am very miſerable—I
deſerve your pity—your prayers—I have
been deceived—you, I hope, will never have ſo
much cauſe to regret it, as I muſt have—you,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0206900204:330"/>
I hope, are happy—will be happy."—He
could ſay no more, but put his hand on his
heart, and looked at Celeſtina with eyes ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
of deſpair and grief, that all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
tenderneſs ſhe had ever felt for him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
at once; ſhe forgot that he was (as
ſhe believed) the huſband of Miſs Fitz-Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
but he was in a moment the beloved
Willoughby, the firſt and only poſſeſſor of
her heart. She threw her arms around him,
and, ſobbing on his boſom, became almoſt
ſenſeleſs from the violence and variety of emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that overwhelmed her.</p>
            <p>He ſhrunk, however, from her "Who is
it," ſaid he, "gracious Heaven! that I thus
hold in my arms?—Not my Celeſtina, my own
Celeſtina; but the wife of another—Go, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam—I
entreat you leave me—Go, or phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy
may overtake me, and I may attempt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities—to
tear you from your huſband."
"Huſband!" cried Celeſtina—"I have no
huſband."—"Are you not married then?—not
married to Montague Thorold?"—"No
indeed—indeed, I am not."—"Not married—nor
intending to be married?"—"Neither, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed."—"And
you are at liberty, then, to be
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0206900204:331"/>
mine."—"I am, if you know that we ought
not to be divided."</p>
            <p>Thoſe only who have loved like Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and who, by a ſudden tranſition, are raiſed
from the abyſs of deſpair to the height of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
can imagine what he felt at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If the fear of Celeſtina's being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
had, for a moment, bereft him of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
the certainty of her being not only free,
but as paſſionately attached to him as ever,
had, for a little time, an equally violent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
Amidſt her own tranſports, the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
of his terrified her. There was a wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in his joy which made her tremble for his
intellects. But, after a moment, her ſoft and
melting voice; the tender aſſurances ſhe gave
him, that ſhe lived only for him; that her
heart had never been eſtranged from him,
ſoothed and ſubdued the tumult of his beating
heart. As his arms fondly encompaſſed her;
as he reſted his head on her boſom, he ſhed
tears of tender gratitude; his ſpirits became
calmer, and the native ſerene dignity of his
mind returned.</p>
            <p>He was not, however, quite tranquil enough
to relate that night to Celeſtina the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0206900204:332"/>
ſeries of events, which had led to the
enchanting certainty he now poſſeſſed—that
ſhe was not his ſiſter, but the daughter of
Lady Horatia's brother; that regretted bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to whoſe picture ſhe had ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance.
The information, however, ſuch
as in his preſent agitated ſtate he was able to
give, convinced her, not only that the fatal
ſuppoſition of her being too nearly related to
Willoughby was for ever removed; but, that
ſhe was born of parents to whom it was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to belong: and that ſhe was nearly
allied by blood to her kind protectreſs.</p>
            <p>She deſired Lady Horatia might, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with this. "Not to night," ſaid
Willoughby—"I would to night ſee nobody
but you, my Celeſtina; hear no voice but
yours—to-morrow I will explain it all. But
now I <hi>feel</hi> my unexpected felicity too forcibly
to be able to talk about it."</p>
            <p>He could not, however, determine to quit
Celeſtina; nor were either of them conſcious
of the courſe of time, till Lady Horatia ſent to
let Celeſtina know ſupper was ready, and to
beg the honour of Mr. Willoughby's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:0206900204:333"/>
It was then that Celeſtina prevailed upon
him to go from her, promiſing to be ready to
walk with him by the dawn of the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
"And you muſt go with me," ſaid he,
"immediately to Alveſtone; for I will not
live another week without you." He then
recollected that Alveſtone might be ſold; for
he had never heard from Cathcart ſince he
had given directions to have it diſpoſed of
He pauſed a moment, and felt ſome uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the reflection: but the happineſs he
poſſeſſed was too great to allow him to feel
any concern long. He ſmiled, and added,
"If indeed Alveſtone is ſtill mine; and, if
it is not, my Celeſtina will <hi>create</hi> for me a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe
wherever ſhe is."</p>
            <p>"And wherever you are," replied ſhe,
while tears of tenderneſs filled her eyes, "Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
will <hi>find</hi> a paradiſe."</p>
            <p>He then once more bade her good night—again
returned—and again bade her adieu.
"You are going now to rejoin the company,"
ſaid he, "and there is Montague Thorold, of
whom, I know it is a weakneſs, I do not love
to think"—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:0206900204:334"/>
"It is indeed, Willoughby, a weakneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of your generous heart; and, I hope,
what I can never have deſerved that you
ſhould indulge."—"Well, well, my angel
I will not indulge it. But muſt you ſup with
them? They will fatigue you with queſtions—they
will diſtreſs you by enquiries." "No;
I had determined to ſend an excuſe; for, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
my heart, yet wondering at its unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
felicity, beats fearfully, and my trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
nerves have unfitted me for conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation."</p>
            <p>At length Willoughby withdrew; and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
with a pencil, told Lady Horatia, who
waited the event of this extraordinary inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
in the moſt uneaſy ſuſpenſe, that ſome
extraordinary converſation with Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
had agitated her ſo much, that ſhe
could not return to the company, but muſt
retire to her bed.</p>
            <p>Montague Thorold, who was the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
of the party, had ſuffered all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of anxious jealouſy while Celeſtina was
abſent. Every noiſe he heard in the paſſage,
every time the door opened, he hoped ſhe was
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0206900204:335"/>
coming. She came not. He went out, not
to liſten, but in hopes of meeting her. He
heard a low murmur of voices—the tones
were thoſe of tenderneſs—Willoughby then
was come to claim her: he was forgiven—and
he himſelf had loſt all hope.—He return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the parlour, pale and dejected—his lips
trembled; his eyes were ſtill eagerly turned to
the door. He heard nothing that was ſaid to
him; but unable to remain in his ſeat, again
aroſe, went out, and returned. At length he
he heard the door of the parlour open, where
Willoughby and Celeſtina were—he liſtened
attentively—he heard her ſay, "Good night,
dear Willoughby." Willoughby ſeemed, as
he anſwered, to kiſs her hand. Poor Thorold
could not bear it; but became more reſtleſs—again
went to the door—came back—opened
it to ſee if Celeſtina was coming—then helped
the ſervant to put the chairs round the ſupper
table, without knowing what he was doing—and
ſat down himſelf in one next to that
which he had placed for her. The ſupper was
announced, but no Celeſtina appeared. At
length the ſervant brought in the note ſhe had
written. Lady Horatia read it, while poor
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0206900204:336"/>
Montague anxiouſly followed her eyes. She
gave it to him acroſs the table: he ran it
over, and his ſolicitude becoming inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
he complained of being ill with the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,
and deſired permiſſion to go to his
lodgings.</p>
            <p>The eyes of his father were turned mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
towards him, as he went out of the room.
Mr. Thorold, however, did not ſpeak, but he
ſighed—and Lady Horatia underſtood him.
As for his wife, though ſhe had been extremely
averſe to the thoughts of her ſon's marrying
Celeſtina, while Celeſtina ſeemed to be no
more than a rejected dependent on the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
family; yet now, ſince Lady Horatia
Howard had adopted her, ſhe appeared to be
altogether as fond of the connection—ſo
eaſily are minds like her's changed by adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
circumſtances, and influenced by ſounds.
The notice Lady Horatia took of her, and her
daughter Bettenſon, delighted and elated
her; rendering her ſo diſguſtingly civil, that
only the regard Lady Horatia felt for Mr.
Thorold and Montague, would have induced
her to ſupport the awkward and offenſive
adulation of Mrs. Thorold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:0206900204:337"/>
The lady of the houſe was ſo anxious about
Celeſtina, that only her general politeneſs, or
what is uſually termed, l'uſage du monde, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
her to acquit herſelf in the uſual forms
towards her gueſts.</p>
            <p>The ſupper was ſhort and dull—the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
being divided between Captain Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſon,
who related a long ſtory of a duel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Jack Marſham, of his regiment, and
one Mr. Abberſley, an enſign in the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth;
the merits of which nobody under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood—and
for the event of which, nobody
cared—and Mrs. Thorold, who deſcribed a
dinner and ball given at Exeter, the week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by a banker of that place, on occaſion of
his daughter's marriage. With the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theſe diſſertations, the ſupper ended;
and Mr. Thorold, who had long been uneaſy
and impatient, withdrew with his family.</p>
            <p>Lady Horatia then haſtened to the chamber
of Celeſtina; ſhe was juſt in bed—but knowing
who it was tapped at the door, begged her to
Come in:—</p>
            <p>"Well, my dear child," ſaid Lady Horatia,
"and what is all this? I am impatient to
know."—"And I, Madam, impatient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0206900204:338"/>
though this evening I am quite unable to
undertake it, all the extraordinary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
recounted to me by Willoughby."
"You are then related to him?" "No, thank
Heaven, I am not—I thank Heaven too, that
I am related to you." "To me?" Celeſtina
then gave a brief account of her birth, and the
way by which Willoughby had learnt thoſe
particulars he had recounted: Lady Horatia
embraced her with tears of rapture. Every
circumſtance ſhe recollected of her brother's
viſits to France, confirmed the truth of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby's
ſtory; and ſhe very perfectly recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
the deſponding ſtate of mind in which
he went to America, after his laſt return from
thence. His impriſonment for a few weeks in
the Baſtile, which was imputed to ſome indiſcretion,
and that he himſelf never otherwiſe
explained—exactly correſponded with what
the Count de Bellegarde had related. But
while every concurrent, teſtimony evinced
the truth of that narrative, Lady Horatia
could not account for her brother's never
having mentioned his marriage, or his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.—"Perhaps,
however," ſaid ſhe, "he
might have reaſons for this, which I cannot
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0206900204:339"/>
penetrate. My father was harſh, obſtinate,
and avaricious; and always expected Ormond
would marry as his elder brother did, to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize
his family—this he uſed frequently
to be teazed to do, but always refuſed—and
for ſome years, his diſpoſition retained nothing
of its former vivacity, but an ardour for war,
in which he ſeemed, I often told him, deſirous
rather of death than of promotion: and he
anſwered me more than once, "That I gueſſed
right—for that he was weary of life." I own,
I not unfrequently ſuſpected, that ſome unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
attachment had ſo ſhaded his natural
gay and vigorous mind, with gloomy depreſſion.—I
have told him ſo—and he has replied,
"That whatever might have been the caſe, he
had no attachment then."</p>
            <p>At length, as Celeſtina extremely needed
repoſe, Lady Horatia left her, reflecting, with
infinite delight, on the kindneſs ſhe had ſhewn
her, as an orphan and a ſtranger, while ſhe
had, in fact, been protecting the daughter of
her beloved brother. With pleaſure too ſhe
now thought of Willoughby, ſince Celeſtina's
happineſs was to be reſtored by her union with
him. But poor Montague Thorold, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0206900204:340"/>
and in deſpair, relinquiſhing all thoſe
charming hopes, which, with more pity than
prudence, ſhe had herſelf encouraged him to
cheriſh preſented himſelf to her imagination,
and greatly abated the ſatisfaction, with which
ſhe thought of the approaching felicity of
Willoughby and her neice.</p>
            <p>She determined, however, to mitigate, as
much as ſhe could, the force of this cruel blow—and,
early the next morning, while Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
was walking with the happy and enrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
Willoughby, ſhe ſent for the elder Mr.
Thorold, and related to him all ſhe had learned
from Celeſtina the evening before.</p>
            <p>"I now blame myſelf, my good friend,"
ſaid ſhe, "for the part I have taken—but who
could foreſee this?—Yet, I own, I fear the
conſequences, and heartily wiſh I had never
given ſo many opportunities to your ſon, of
contemplating thoſe perfections of mind and
perſon, which he will never, I fear, be able to
forget."</p>
            <p>Mr. Thorold knew too well that this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
was juſt—and dreaded, leſt the: loſs
even of reaſon itſelf ſhould be the conſequence
of Celeſtina's marriage—he returned home,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0206900204:341"/>
however, immediately, to relate to Montague
the probability there was, that this event would
immediately happen. But, however tenderly
he communicated ſuch fatal intelligence, he
found his ſon more affected by it, than even
his paternal fears had repreſented.</p>
            <p>A ſilent and heavy deſpondence took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of him. He neither complained of,
nor reproached any one—but perſiſted in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he would fee Celeſtina—take a laſt
leave of her, and then try to reconcile himſelf
to his fate.</p>
            <p>But in his manner of ſaying this, there, was
ſomething more diſtreſſing to his father, than
he would have felt from the wildeſt ravings of
deſpair—he entreated him to relinquiſh his
project of ſeeing Celeſtina.—"Why ſhould
you ſee her, Montague," ſaid he; "to what
purpoſe?—You own, that while Willoughby
was in queſtion, you entertained no hope—That
Celeſtina has never afforded you any
ſince; but that in ſpite of her aſſurances that
ſhe could never feel a ſecond attachment—that
you have perſevered, and <hi>taken</hi> that hope
which ſhe refuſed to give—you have no one,
therefore, to blame; and if you have ſought
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0206900204:342"/>
pain, you muſt learn to bear it. But after all that
has paſſed, I cannot conſent to your inflicting
it on Celeſtina, or hazarding the poſſibility of
giving uneaſineſs to her huſband."</p>
            <p>"Huſband!" cried Montague Thorold—"he
is not her huſband yet—but if he were—can
my humble adoration offend him—when I
mean to bid her an everlaſtingadieu?—She will
conſole my ſick heart by tender pity—She will
bid me be at peace—and I may try then to
obey her—The ſound of her voice is to me ſo
ſoothing—that if ſhe does not refuſe it, I muſt
hear it once more ſpeak to me in accents of
kindneſs."</p>
            <p>Mr. Thorold, finding every thing he could
ſay to diſſuade Montague from indulging this
unhappy inclination quite ineffectual, became
extremely uneaſy; and dreaded, leſt ſome
alarming conſequence ſhould ariſe from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview,
which he thought Willoughby could
not approve, even if it were reaſonable or
proper in his ſon to aſk it.</p>
            <p>But Willoughby, now perfectly ſecure of
the affections of Celeſtina, was too generous,
and too noble-minded, not to feel pity for his
unfortunate rival. His own happineſs, great
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0206900204:343"/>
as it was, would have been more complete, if
he could have believed Montague Thorold leſs
unhappy.—"Would to Heaven," ſaid he,
as he ſpoke of him to Celeſtina, "Would to
Heaven that he could ſee Anzoletta, and
transfer to her that affection, which, while it
is fixed on you, can ſerve only to render him
miſerable."—Celeſtina joined moſt cordially
in this wiſh.—"He deſerves to be happy, I
believe," ſaid ſhe; "and the deſire you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
to ſee him ſo, is worthy of the heart of
my Willoughby."</p>
            <p>But however liberal and reaſonable Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
was in regard to a competitor, from
whom, though he had ſuffered much, he had
now nothing to fear; he was not ſo patient
under any circumſtance that was likely to
impede his union with Celeſtina.—All that
ſhe or Lady Horatia could urge to him on the
propriety and neceſſity of a ſhort delay, for
preparations and forms, he treated as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous—and
ſo vehemently inſiſted on the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of fulfilling the promiſe he had made
to the Count de Bellegarde, at parting with
him, to return to him immediately with Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
as his wife—that their oppoſition was
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0206900204:344"/>
to little purpoſe.—So totally engroſſed, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
had Willoughby been by his fears leſt
Celeſtina might be loſt to him, that he did not
even know whether he had a houſe to take her
to—but, as with him, all places were alike to
her, he ſent an expreſs that morning to Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart,
informing him, that he ſhould be at
Exeter the next day with Celeſtina, deſiring
him to meet him there with Jeſſy, and to go
with them to Alveſtone, if Alveſtone was yet
in his poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>He diſpatched another meſſenger to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for a ſpecial licence to be married at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtone,
or Exeter; and obviating every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
ſeruple, he prevailed on Celeſtina to
ſet out with him that evening for the latter
place, with the conſent of Lady Horatia, who
promiſed to follow them in a few days.</p>
            <p>The diſtance was ſo ſhort, that though it
was late in the day, after Willoughby's arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
at Exmouth, before this was determined
upon, they were at Exeter by ſeven in the
evening; and in an hour afterwards, Cathcart
and Jeſſy arrived alſo.</p>
            <p>Cathcart not only informed Willoughby
that his eſtate was ſtill his, but put into hands
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0206900204:345"/>
thoſe letters that brought the intelligence of
that acquiſition of fortune which came by the
death of Lord Caſtlenorth.—The ſatisfaction
of this intelligence, the pleaſure of meeting
Cathcart and Jeſſy, who were overwhelmed
with joy to ſee them—the certainty of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together to a place they both ſo fondly
loved, ſeemed to complete the happineſs of
the long divided lovers.—Early the next
morning they reached Alveſtone, where, in
the abſence of Mr. Thorold, his curate joined
the hands of Willoughby and Celeſtina, above
eighteen months after that period, when they
believed themſelves ſeparated for ever.</p>
            <p>In three days Lady Horatia arrived at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtone;
and the additional pleaſure her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
gave them, was checked only by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
ſhe gave of the ſituation of Montague
Thorold—who not having been allowed to ſee
Celeſtina, the time of whoſe departure from
Exmouth had been induſtriouſly concealed
from him, had ſunk into ſuch a ſtate of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence,
as made his father tremble for his
reaſon, if not for his life.</p>
            <p>For Vavaſour too, whom Willoughby had
always loved, he could not help feeling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0206900204:346"/>
—He knew not whither to direct to him;
but from all the accounts he was able to gain,
he feared that all the good qualities of his
heart and underſtanding were obſcured, if not
deſtroyed, by the diſſolute ſtile of life into
which he had plunged with ſuch avidity,
ſince their laſt parting.—He endeavoured,
however, to counteract the impreſſions of theſe
only alloys to ſupreme happineſs, by reflecting
on the probable felicity of other friends, and
particularly of the Count of Bellegarde; from
whom, ten days after his marriage, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a letter, informing him, that he was
then going to Perpignan; empowered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
his wife from her convent—and that they
ſhould go, together with their Anzoletta, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to Rochemarte—where he beſought
Willoughby to rejoin him, with Celeſtina—promiſing,
that if he would do ſo, they would
return with him, and paſs the winter all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in England.</p>
            <p>Though it was now late in the year, and
though Celeſtina would have preferred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
at Alveſtone, where ſhe had fixed all
her ideas of happineſs, yet the wiſhes of her
uncle, and the melancholy ſatisfaction of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0206900204:347"/>
the place where her mother had lived—and
where ſhe died a victim to parental harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and maternal grief; together with the
inclination Willoughby ſhewed to gratify the
Count, and introduce his wife to him and
Anzoletta, determined her to make no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to their immediate departure.—There
was, indeed, no time to loſe; as the winter
was ſo near.—Lady Horatia too, who waited
impatiently an interview with Monſieur de
Bellegarde, though ſhe had not health to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
ſuch a journey, haſtened them as
much as poſſible; and in ſomething leſs than a
month after Willoughby called Celeſtina his,
he preſented her, at Rochemarte, to her uncle
de Bellegarde, to Jacquelina, and Anzoletta.
To the two former ſhe appeared the precious
repreſentative of their two beloved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted
friends; the tender recollection of
of whom, added to her own merit, made her
to them an object almoſt of adoration—while
Anzoletta loved her as a ſiſter, to whom ſhe
became more tenderly attached, from taſte
and affection, than even that near tie of blood
alone could have attached her.</p>
            <p>With what melancholy pleaſure did the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0206900204:348"/>
Count tie round the neck of Celeſtina that
picture of her mother, which her father, as he
was dying, had taken from his own boſom—with
an injunction, never to part with it, but
to his daughter.—And how many tears did
Celeſtina ſhed, as, leaning on the arm of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
he pointed out to her the ſpot,
which the Count had ſhewn him, as the grave
of Genevieve.—Willoughby kiſſed thoſe tears
away, as they filled her eyes—and bade her
turn from the too frequent recollection of the
paſt, to thoſe ſcenes of future happineſs, which
love, friendſhip, and fortune, ſeemed to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for them.</p>
            <p>In the romantic and magnificent ſcenes
round the caſtle the poetical taſte of Celeſtina
Was highly gratified. Willoughby took her
the ſpot where he had been loſt in the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
night that eventually led him to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence
of the Count of Bellegarde. They
viſited together the humble cottage of Le
Laurier, whoſe family they loaded with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and traced with her the ſcenes which
were ſo many years before witneſſes to the
clandeſtine marriages of Genevieve and Jac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelina.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:0206900204:349"/>
Winter, however, put an end to theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
in the mountains; and the Count
de Bellegarde, having completed the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his affairs, agreed, at the earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of Willoughby and Celeſtina, to go with
his wife and daughter to England.</p>
            <p>On their journey thither, they met at Paris
Captain and Mrs. Cavanaugh. They found
the former become a man of the utmoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
and arrogantly enjoying the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of his new ſituation, in a country where
he had appeared in one ſo very different.
Mrs. Cavanaugh ſeemed to affect being happy—and
to diſdain all ſhe had relinquiſhed to
obtain that happineſs her own way. But,
from ſome ſtrange caprice, ſhe now appeared
ſo fond of Willoughby, that had Celeſtina
been liable to jealouſy—or had Cavanaugh
really cared for his wife, they might both, in
her manner, have found ſufficient cauſe of
diſcontent. Mrs. Cavanaugh related to Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
all the artifices her mother had uſed
to break off his marriage with Celeſtina; and
when he expreſſed his wonder that Lady
Caſtlenorth ſhould go ſuch lengths in an affair
in which her intereſt did not appear to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0206900204:350"/>
or particularly concerned, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
in her uſual ſneering way—"If you
could know my mother ſo well as I do—but
it is impoſſible by words to do her juſtice—you
would no longer wonder. Her ſcheme
lay much deeper than you were aware of."</p>
            <p>Lady Caſtlenorth, to conſole herſelf for the
defection of Captain Cavanaugh, had taken,
as her travelling companion, a young Abbé,
who, diſcontented with the prevailing politics
of his country, found in her at once an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer
of his perſon and character, and a ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
ſupporter of his ariſtocratic principles—and,
what was yet better than either, he found
himſelf ſharing a fortune beyond what he had
ever dreamed of poſſeſſing. This well aſſorted
pair were at Bruſſeis—and Mrs. Cavanaugh
diverted herſelf with ſome ſarcaſtic remarks
on the Director choſen by her mother—of
whom ſhe always ſpoke with a degree of ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
which made Celeſtina tremble, while
Willoughby ſhuddered to recollect how near
he once was becoming the huſband of one
who could thus expreſs herſelf towards her
mother.</p>
            <p>Captain and Mrs. Cavanaugh were going
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0206900204:351"/>
to Italy.—The happy party, who took leave
of them, haſtened to England, where, on their
arrival in London, Lady Horatia joined them,
and they were ſoon fixed at Alveſtone, in ſuch
perfect felicity as is ſeldom enjoyed, and ſtill
more rarely deſerved.—The firſt enquiry of
Celeſtina was for Mr. Thorold and his family.
She learned that Captain Thorold was the
great friend and favourite of Lady Molyneux,
with whom he was gone to Ireland to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
of his father, who had however no
influence over him, and whoſe diſappointment
in his eldeſt ſon was embittered by the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into which a hopeleſs and incurable
paſſion had thrown the youngeſt.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, who could not reflect, without
great pain, on the unhappineſs with which
the days of her excellent friend were thus
over-clouded, took an early opportunity, after
her being ſettled at Alveſtone, to deſire an
interview with the elder Mr. Thorold. He
came—and ſhe ſaw with redoubled concern,
the ravage which anxiety had made on his
manly face and figure, even in a few ſhort
months. He related to her, hardly refraining
from tears, the ſad change that had happened
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0206900204:352"/>
in the temper and talents of his ſon—"I have
ſometimes thought," ſaid he, "that you, my
dear Madam, and you only, can rouſe him
from theſe alienations of mind—I was averſe
to his ſeeing you before you went abroad—but
now I wiſh it: your reaſon may reconcile
him to his fate—you pity, ſoothe him—or, be
the event of your meeting what it may, no
change can, I think, be for the worſe." Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
promiſed to ſee him—and his father
contrived, with her, the means of procuring
this interview; for Montague now ſhunned
every body, and very frequently would not
appear, even to his own family.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina did not, however, mean to meet
him alone; but to ſhew him, in Anzoletta,
beauty, underſtanding, and ſweetneſs, with a
heart untouched by any former paſſion, and
worthy of his. Her generous intentions, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.—Montague
Thorold, ſtruck with the
reſemblance between them, and particularly
with the voice of Anzoletta, was ſoon as paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately
attached to her, as a man could be,
who had once loved Celeſtina herſelf. The
Count of Bellegarde, who intended to beſtow
her, with her ample fortune, on an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0206900204:353"/>
and a Proteſtant, heſitated not a moment,
in conſenting to an union which would, he
found, make his daughter happy; and, eight
months after the marriage of Willoughby and
Celeſtina, Anzoletta gave her hand, in the
chapel of Alveſtone, to Montague Thorold.</p>
            <p>Willoughby had now but one wiſh unful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled—for
every pecuniary difficulty, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of the Count de Bellegarde, and the
legacy of Lord Caſtlenorth, had removed—and
this one wiſh was, to ſee Vavaſour ſuch
as a reaſonable being, with every reaſonable
means of happineſs in his power, ought to be.
But in this, as he had no ſecond Anzoletta to
give him, and ſhould have feared his want of
ſteadineſs if he had, he almoſt deſpaired of
being gratified.</p>
            <p>Vavaſour, however, ſometimes viſited at
Alveſtone; and, unlike Montague Thorold,
he ſeemed to have conquered his extravagant
paſſion for Celeſtina, ſince it was become
hopeleſs. He had, unluckily for him, taken
up no permanent affection in its place; but
loſt his health, and his fortune in purſuits
which could not afford him even a temporary
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0206900204:354"/>
poſſeſſion of that happineſs for which he ſtill
declared himſelf to be in ſearch.</p>
            <p>When Celeſtina reflected on his kindneſs to
Mrs. Elphinſtone and her children, who now
lived in comfort on the proviſion he had made
for them; and on many other generous and
noble actions; ſhe could not but lament, with
Willoughby, that infelicity of which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
complained, even amid his wildeſt and
moſt determined perſeverance in the career of
diſſolute pleaſure. But for this ſource of regret,
as there ſeemed to be no remedy within her
power, ſhe did not ſuffer it to embitter the
ſatisfaction ſhe derived from almoſt every
other friend.</p>
            <p>Lady Horatia no longer complained of that
tedium which, at the beginning of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
ſeemed to have rendered life indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to her. She had now, in Willoughby,
and his lovely wife, objects of her affection;
and hoped to grow old amidſt their children.
Monſieur and Madam de Bellegarde, were
more acutely ſenſible of their preſent happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
from the poignancy of their paſt afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and their daughter, the object of their
tender ſolicitude, made the felicity of a worthy
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0206900204:355"/>
man, who deſerved the affection ſhe felt for
him. In Cathcart and Jeſſy, Celeſtina beheld
the earlieſt objects of her beneficence—enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all that affluence and mutual tenderneſs
could beſtow—And the widowed heart of Mrs.
Elphinſtone was at eaſe, not only by her
own preſent independence, but from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances
Willoughby had given her, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
for her boys, as ſoon as they were of
the age when they could be put to profeſſions.
The elder Mr. Thorold, too, her venerable
and reſpectable friend, was reſtored to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
in contemplating that of his ſon: and
above all, Celeſtina beheld in Willoughby,
the beſt and moſt affectionate of huſbands—whoſe
whole life was dedicated to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of making her happy—and whoſe only
apprehenſion ſeemed to be, that with all he
could do, he muſt fall infinitely ſhort of that
degree of merit towards either heaven or
earth, which that fortunate being ought to
poſſeſs, who was bleſſed with ſo lovely and
perfect a creature as Celeſtina.</p>
