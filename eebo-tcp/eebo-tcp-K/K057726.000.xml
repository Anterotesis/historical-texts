            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>GIL BLAS adviſed a friend who had written for the ſtage with ſucceſs, to publiſh his works, obſerving that as he had impoſed upon the public by the repreſentation of bad pieces, he ought to open their eyes in gratitude for the reception they had met. This Opera, I fear, like the works of the Spaniſh dramatiſt, tho' applauded on the ſtage, may fall under cenſure in the cloſet, where it muſt appear diveſted of that aid it received from your excellent muſical compoſitions, and the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable acting with which the characters were ſupported. The three principal ideas which combine the ſubject are not original, but bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the ballads of <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> the <hi>Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brown Maid,</hi> and the <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Hermit of the Dale</hi> is taken from a ballad called, the <hi>Friar of orders Grey,</hi> which is taken from an old ballad called the <hi>Herdſman.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Hermit of the Dale</hi>: I adopted them as being popular. It was my firſt intention to have taken all the ſongs from old ballads; thoſe I have ſelected are, I truſt, not ill choſen, or unapplicable to the piece. ROBIN HOOD and his merry Archers have often been upon the Stage. The <hi>Biographia Dramatica</hi> gives an account of ſix pieces in which this celebrated outlaw was the hero, excluſive of the <hi>Sad Shepherd</hi> by Ben Johnſon; but it does not appear that any of them met with ſucceſs. I addreſs theſe obſervations to you, as a tribute to your merit; happy in having an opportunity of publicly aſſuring you, that no man ſtands higher in my eſteem. Your friend,</p>

Noble Captain, this gentleman, who ſays he is my humble ſervant, deſires to ſpeak with you.</p>

It is my way to meet every man on equal terms; and if you come for a trial of ſkill, my bow-bearer will ſee fair play.</p>

                  <p>SO, after all my boaſting, I have loſt my way; but that is common with men of genius, and women of genius too. There is your great ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; he often leaves the plain road of truth, to wander in the labyrinth of falſehood. Then your prude, perhaps, after walking years in the ſtreight paths of virtue, trips in her gait, and, ſtumbling, falls upon a bed of thorns.
<q>Few people purſue the tract Nature deſigned them—therefore we find politicians without brains, magiſtrates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out juſtice, noblemen without honour, traders without honeſty, philoſophers without morality, and churchmen without religion.</q>—</p>

                  <p>That was pious; you cut the throats of the Pagans for the honour of Heaven, and the good of your own ſouls.</p>

                  <p>True; but it being our misfortune to be taken priſoner, we were carried to the houſe of a Muſti, where my maſter falling in love with the

Muſti's wife, and being diſcovered by him in the lady's apartment, to ſave himſelf, he ſtabbed the old fellow to the heart.</p>

                  <p>We fled of courſe; and, after long wandering, came to a ſea-port, where we took ſhipping, and at laſt arrived in Old England.</p>

                  <p>Certainly—I intrigued in the ſeraglio of a Janiſſary, who had a wife for every week, and a concubine for every day in the year.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Ruttek.</speaker>
                  <p>O, poor fellow! he had an almanack full of them. But I cannot help laughing at a fellow with ſuch a pigmy perſon and ſqueak-pipe voice getting among ſo many women.</p>
