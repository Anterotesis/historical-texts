            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I have often thought my childiſh Ambition for a <hi>ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Cloak,</hi> of the ſame Stamp as we often meet with in higher Life: It is the ſame Principle which ſwells the Hearts of the Great, as puff'd up mine, and if a due Regard to Nature be obſerved, it will be allow'd ſo.

Here the Reader ſees, in the <hi>Puris Naturalibus,</hi> that Dawn of Genius which <hi>baſhful Modeſty</hi> could never reſtrain from writing, and who ſtill makes ſuch <hi>Odes</hi> which all the poor <hi>Devils</hi> of <hi>Wits</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put him out of Conceit of . . . . But to <hi>myſelf . . . .</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot ſay that among my School-Fellows I made my great Figure, or raiſed their Envy by any learned Compoſitions; yet, I know not how it was, I had then an innate Kind of Propenſity to Scribbling; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any partial Flattery to myſelf, I can affirm I choſe, or rather accidentally ſtruck into one Species of Writing, in which I was not only then without an Equal, but have remained ſo ever ſince.</p>
            <p>Here, perhaps, I may again ſeem vain! But if the Facts are true, how can I help it? If I have a tolerable Feature, will not that as much belong to my Picture as my Imperfection? In a Word, the Story is this.</p>
            <p>While I was at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> there came ſome <hi>Prize-Fighters</hi> from the <hi>Bear-Garden</hi> at <hi>London;</hi> and as I was always fond of <hi>Heroes</hi> and martial Deeds, I intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced myſelf into the Company of theſe Knight-Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants of the Blade: It happen'd that however brave the Heroes were, they were not very learned: In truth they could neither write nor read. It was on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that they deſir'd me being a better Scholard, (Prize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fighters Language) to pen their <hi>Challenges,</hi> which they inſtructed me to indite. . . . . . Here I gave the firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of my Parts; for having been us'd at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to read Playhouſe Bills, and hear Tragedies, my Father being Maſter of a Playhouſe, I wrote their Bills of <hi>Challenge</hi> with ſuch Art, and expreſs'd the Heroes Thoughts in ſuch magnanimous Phraze, that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd the Soul of the Reader, and rouz'd up a greater Deſire for a Gladiatorial Spectacle than all the Drums in <hi>Chriſtondom. . . . .</hi> Theſe Challenges of my inditing had wonderful Succeſs; the People were amaz'd at the ſwelling Pompouſneſs of the Heroes Language, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0393400300:20"/>
conſequently imagined that thoſe who were terribly courageous with their <hi>Pen,</hi> muſt be very <hi>Lions</hi> at the <hi>Sword:</hi> But alas! it is one Thing <hi>Scribere,</hi> and another <hi>Agere:</hi> Their Valour did not near equal the Nobleneſs of my Deſcription; for the Battle they fought was a ſham one. . . . . However, they returned their grateful Acknowledgments to me, and I was Author of all their Challenges, which, with much Art, I diverſify'd during their whole Stay.</p>
            <p>Well ſays ſome grave Annotator, who has not heard ſome private Anecdotes of my Life, what do you infer from this Tale? . . . . Hear another, and take the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of them both together. . . . . Some Space of Time had elaps'd ſince my Heroes of the Blade left <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> when a Company of Hireling Actors arriv'd. I ſoon made myſelf known to them, and was accordingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Rehearſals: One Morning I caſually took up a Paper, which was a written Bill of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance they were to exhibit in the Evening. I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately found there was ſomething deficient, or at leaſt ſomething that might be alter'd to raiſe the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Populace, and bring a better Audience to the Houſe: I communicated my Thoughts very freely to the Maſter of the Company, and ſhew'd ſuch an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Genius</hi> for writing and compoſing a <hi>Play-houſe Bill,</hi> that, with a complaiſant Bow, he intreated me to write theirs. I comply'd with his Requeſt, and wrote them in ſuch a <hi>promiſſory Way,</hi> (a Way which has been ſince call'd <hi>Puffing)</hi> that they engroſs'd the Attention of the Town, and by an attractive Quality, brought them ſeveral good Audiences. . . . I cannot paſs by one Thing; the Maſter of the Company, and his <hi>Roxana,</hi> were of an ambitious Spirit, to indulge which, I ordered their Names to be printed <hi>ſix Times</hi> as large as any of the Reſt of the Performers: An Article of <hi>Stage-Vanity,</hi> which I have ſince moſt frequently practis'd with much Glee of Heart and Pomp-Magnificent.</p>
            <p>Now to apply theſe Stories: from ſuch ſmall Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, my Genius ſoar'd to an unequal Height; and I have had, for this Species of writing, no one hardy enough to become my Competitor in Fame. With a pleaſant Recordation of Mind I think what Praiſes were
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0393400300:21"/>
beſtowed on the Advertiſements, and the Bills of the <hi>Bear-Garden,</hi> while I had, for ſome Years, the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>writing</hi> them: They were attributed to my Pen, and the moſt partial Witling that ever pretended to be arch upon me, would allow that in this I was inimitable. . . . I ſhall not mention what Degree of Excellence I have arriv'd to in <hi>Theatrical Bills,</hi> and <hi>Advertiſements,</hi> and <hi>Puffs,</hi> and <hi>Paragraphs:</hi> My <hi>Modeſty</hi> will not ſuffer me to give to <hi>Poſterity,</hi> in theſe Memoirs, what the preſent Age ſays of them: Be it enough, that there is that <hi>Something</hi> in them which no one can hit but <hi>myſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what I have mention'd, I would obſerve this; that wherever there is Merit there is a heavy Tax laid on it; Envy and Malice will demand a conſiderable Share of the Praiſe which is due to you: However great my Succeſs has been in the Species of Writing, I have deſcrib'd above, yet it has rais'd me many Enemies; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who cannot bear to ſee any ſhining Parts in another, without endeavouring, by a Cloud of intervening Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to eclipſe them. The little Genius that I have, and which hereditarily deſcends to me from a paternal Source of Wit, has often occaſion'd me, in the very Spring-time of my Life, to become the But of witleſs Cenſure and Invective; and the ſame Reaſon makes me frequently the Object of Raillery in publick Coffee-houſes and publick News Papers. But as the greater Poll of Mankind would rather vote for Cenſure than Commendation; Satire has a thouſand Readers where Panegyrick has one; therefore when I ſee my Name, or Characteriſtick for my Name, in a Journal or Pamphlet, I look on it as an Artifice of the Author to get a Dinner: He conſiders that my Face and Name are more known than many thouſands of more Conſequence in the Kingdom; that therefore, right or wrong, a Lick at poor THE', or the <hi>Young Captain,</hi> or <hi>Ancient Piſtol,</hi> or by what other Name ſoever they pleaſe, to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify and diſtinguiſh me, will be a ſure Bait <hi>ad cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum Vulgus,</hi> to catch little Readers, and gratify the Unlearn'd. . . . In almoſt theſe very Words the <hi>Laureat Apologiſt</hi> makes his Complaint, on being ſatiriz'd with his Name at length by Mr. <hi>Pope. . . .</hi> And I muſt add, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0393400300:22"/>
as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> (for let him be as great a Satyriſt as he will I am not afraid to ſpeak out) for the Sake of the Pence, ſatyriz'd the inculpable Mr. <hi>C. Cibber.</hi> It was for that Reaſon, and that Reaſon only, that Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi>'s Son muſt be mention'd in his Rhymes. . . . What elſe could provoke him to ſay,</p>

            </p>
            <p>As no Wit or Criticiſm can make me worſe than I am, no ſerious Reply I can offer will make me better.

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0393400300:24"/>
of a <hi>Revolution,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>myſelf,</hi> that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt gave occaſion to ſeveral Pieces of Wit and ſatirical <hi>Flirts</hi> at the Conductor of the Enterprize. I was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd, as my Father had been before me, in the publick Papers and Journals; and the burleſque Character of <hi>Piſtol</hi> was attributed to me as a real one. Out came a Print of <hi>Jack Laquerres,</hi> repreſenting, in moſt vile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning, this Expedition of ours, under the name of the <hi>Stage Mutiny;</hi> in which, gentle Reader, <hi>your humble Servant,</hi> in the <hi>Piſtol</hi> Character, was the principal Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. This I laugh'd at, knowing it only a proper Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhment for one of theſe neceſſary Structures to which Perſons only out of Neceſſity repair.—But now comes the grand Attack; a Summer Company was at this Juncture performing at <hi>Covent-Garden Theatre;</hi> and our Tranſactions, and my Character, were thought worthy to be repreſented on the Stage. Accordingly a young Spark, who was juſt come from <hi>Trinity College</hi> at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to ſet up for an Author in Town, and who had juſt before wrote a Farce, call'd the <hi>Mock-Lawyer,</hi> thought this a proper Time to exerciſe his <hi>Genius.</hi> To work he went, and <hi>Piſtol</hi> was to be his Heroe: A Farce was wrote, and perform'd, and the Bent of it was to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule poor <hi>me:</hi> Tone of Elocution, my buskin Tread, my Elevation of Countenance, my Dignity of Geſture, and expreſſive Rotation of Eye-balls: In ſhort, all my Manner was burleſqu'd, and a mock Pomp of Words, which were a Parody of Tragedy Speeches, and <hi>Piſtol</hi>'s Bombaſt run through the Character.—This I will ſay, the <hi>Thing</hi> was ſo well tim'd, and the Perſon who mimick'd me did it ſo well, that it ſucceeded far beyond any the leaſt intrinſick Merit that was in it.—But where am I again digreſſing?—How d'ye think I behav'd on this Occaſion? I knew if there was any Thing ſmart upon me the Audience would very readily laugh at it, and indeed at a Rehearſal I thought ſome Things ſmart enough.—What then did I, but plac'd myſelf in one of the Side-boxes, in the full Front of the Houſe, and was reſolv'd, like <hi>Cibber</hi>'s ſelf,

Well, the Scene open'd, and on <hi>Piſtol</hi>'s appearing there was a thundering Clap, and all the Eyes in the Houſe converted on <hi>me;</hi> every Sentence that hit at <hi>me,</hi> the Joke was heighten'd by looking at me, who laugh'd as much at <hi>them,</hi> and the <hi>Poverty</hi> of the <hi>Author</hi>'s Wit, as the Author or the Audience could poſſibly do at me, but ſeem'd only to join the Chorus, and laugh for mere good Humour.

            </p>
            <p>My Father, as I before himed, had conceiv'd great Deſignations of me; but there was a Concatenation of Things, which occaſion'd me to follow the ſame Tract which he had trod in before.

               <q>NISUS <hi>amore pio pueri,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
However to this Day I cannot think the making a falſe <hi>Comment</hi> on a Paſſage in a <hi>Heathen</hi> Author, ſhould be a Diſqualification for Eccleſiaſtic Preferment.—Be that however as it will, it was, I think, about the Year 1720, when a Change of Miniſtry was happening at <hi>London,</hi> and the Right Honourable Sir <hi>R—W—</hi>was about to make that illuſtrious Figure in <hi>Europe,</hi> which we have ſince ſeen; while the Nation was in <hi>Labour</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Production,</hi> my Affairs alſo were in Labour of ſome Event, when I happen'd to be ſent up to <hi>London</hi> to my Father, to be turn'd looſe into the Buſtle of the World.—At this Juncture you cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the Fate of Sir <hi>R.

            <p>But notwithſtanding all I have ſaid, and my Father before me, the Profeſſion of a Player ſtill continues, as by his Memoirs I find it has always done, to be held by many Gentlemen and People of Quality in no great Eſteem; and many outrageous Inſults have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Perſons, who would be thought Gentlemen, on Actors, whom they dar'd not have uſed ſo in any other Place but a Theatre. But theſe Inſulters of <hi>Audiences,</hi> as well as <hi>Players,</hi> are not to be rul'd, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with them; they are all Patriots, Liberty and Property Men, who roar out to defend their <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> of doing what they will in a Theatre. This Uſage of Players, Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi> ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"keeps young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Senſe from coming on the Stage; they fear entering into a Society, whoſe Inſtitution if not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, is an excellent School of Morality: But alas! as <hi>Shakſpear</hi> ſays:</q>

And really the Abuſe of the Stage by the Actors, be it as great as it will, by acting indiſcreetly in their private Lives, it is not greater than the Abuſe that thoſe noiſy Rioters make of it by their publick Diſturbances: I cannot apprehend what rational Authority this <hi>Society for the Reformation of theatrical Manners</hi> can plead, to call an Actor to an Account on the Stage for what he has done off it: Would any Judge pay leſs Regard for a Counſellor's Argument at the Bar, becauſe he may be an indiſcreet, or even a bad Man at home?—But it is otherwiſe at our theatric Bar of Judgment; our <hi>Judges</hi> are alſo <hi>Jury,</hi> and likewiſe <hi>Executioners;</hi> and though you appear there not as your own Perſon, they make you the <hi>Culprit,</hi> put you immediately on your <hi>Trial,—</hi>and <hi>G—d ſend you a good Deliverance.—</hi>But I may ſay what I will againſt thſe unjuſt, unlimited In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, yet the Player who falls under ſuch a Caprice of publick Diſpleaſure, muſt be left <hi>adrift, and ride out the Storm as well as he is able.</hi>

But that Anecdote will fall under my Pen in a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Chapter: To conclude this; the View of riſing ſome Time or other to live in that modiſh Affluence, jovial Gaiety, and ſeeming Importance, in which my Father and ſome others I ſaw liv'd, was the flattering Light by which I ſteer'd my Courſe: Such Temptations were too ſtrong for ſo warm a Vanity as mine to reſiſt; on the Stage I came, being entered, according to my Merit, at a very low Salary; and now, gentle and moſt candid Reader, your Curioſity is from thence to expect a farther Account of me.</p>

                  <hi>Betterton</hi> was an Actor as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> was an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, both without Competitors, form'd for the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Aſſiſtance, and Illuſtration of each other's Genius: The one was born only to ſpeak what the other only knew to write: But to give a more clear Idea of him: You have ſeen a <hi>Hamlet,</hi> perhaps, who, on the firſt Appearance of his Father's Spirit, has thrown himſelf into all the ſtraining Vociferations requiſite to expreſs Rage and Fury, and the Houſe has thunder'd with Applauſe, though the miſguided Actor was <hi>tearing a Paſſion into Rags.</hi> Now <hi>Betterton</hi> threw this Scene into another Light: He open'd it with a Pauſe of mute Amuſement, then riſing ſlowly to a ſolemn trembling Voice, he made the Ghoſt equally terrible to the Spectator as to himſelf; and in the deſcriptive Part of the natural Emotions which the ghaſtly Viſion gave, the Boldneſs of his Expoſtulations were ſtill govern'd by Decency; manly, but not braving; his Voice never riſing into that ſeeming Outrage, or wild Defiance of what he naturally rever'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0393400300:47"/>
A farther Excellence <hi>Betterton</hi> had was, that he could vary his Spirit to the different Characters he acted: Thoſe wild impatient Starts, that fierce and flaſhing Fire which he threw into <hi>Hotſpur</hi> never came from the unruffied Temper of <hi>Brutus,</hi> (for I have ſeen, more than once, a <hi>Brutus</hi> as warm, as <hi>Hotſpur.)</hi> When the <hi>Betterton Brutus</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd in his Diſpute with <hi>Caſſius,</hi> his Spirit flew only to his Eye; his ſteady Look alone ſupply'd that Terror which he diſdain'd an Intemperance of Voice ſhould riſe to. Thus with a ſettled Dignity of Contempt, like an <hi>unheeding Rock</hi> he repell'd upon himſelf the Foam of <hi>Caſſius:</hi> Perhaps the Words of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> will better let you into my Meaning.</p>

               <p>And a little after:</p>

               <p>But with whatever Strength of Nature we ſee the Poet ſhow, at once the Philoſopher and the Hero, yet the Image of the Actor's Excellence, unleſs Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage could put Colours into our Words to paint the Voice with,<q>Et ſi vis Similem pingere, pinge Sonum,</q>is an Impoſſibility.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Characters, he ſhewed an <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Power</hi> in <hi>blowing</hi> ALEXANDER <hi>into a Blaze of Almi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>'d and quiet was an Applauſe which only Truth and Merit could arrive at. But if Truth and Merit were only applauded, how many noiſy Actors would ſhake their Plumes with Shame, who, from an injudicious Approbation of the Multitude, have ſtrutted and bawl'd in the Place of Merit. <hi>Betterton</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0393400300:48"/>
had a Voice of that Kind which gave more Spirit to Terror than to the ſofter Paſſions, of more Strength than Melody: The Rage and Jealouſy of <hi>Othello</hi> became him better than the Sighs and Tenderneſs of <hi>Caſtalio;</hi> for though in <hi>Caſtalio</hi> he only excell'd others, in <hi>Othello</hi> he excell'd himſelf. The Perſon of this excellent Actor was ſuitable to his Voice; more manly than ſweet; not exceeding the middle Stature; inclining to the Corpulent; of a ſerious, penetrating Aſpect; his Limbs nearer the athletick than the delicate Proportion; yet, however form'd, there roſe, from the Harmony of the Whole, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Mein of Majeſty, which the fairer-fac'd Darlings of his Time ever wanted ſomething to be Maſters of. The laſt Part he acted was <hi>Melantius</hi> in the <hi>Maid's Tragedy,</hi> for his own Benefit, when being ſuddenly ſeiz'd with the Gout, he ſubmitted, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Applications, to have his Foot ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that he might be able to walk on the Stage in a Slipper, rather than wholly diſappoint his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: He was obſerv'd that Day to have exerted a more than ordinary Spirit, and met with a ſuitable Applauſe; but the unhappy Conſequence of tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Diſtemper was, that it flew into his Head and kill'd him in three Days, in the 74th Year of his Age."</p>

            <p>This is the chief Account which Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi> gives of <hi>Betterton;</hi> he has indeed interſpers'd ſeveral Theatric Obſervations, which amount to no more than they who <hi>write</hi> can't <hi>read,</hi> and they who <hi>read</hi> can't <hi>act:</hi> Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> could not read his own <hi>Amphitrion;</hi> yet <hi>Nat.

In 1690 the Stage was under the Government of united Patentees, who had under them ſo compleat a Set of Actors as has been deſcribed: yet they were weak enough, or the Taſte of the Publick was ſo weak,

The ſame Author wrote a Second Part to his <hi>Beggars Opera,</hi> and tranſported his Heroe beyond Sea; but this was forbid to come on the Stage.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0393400300:68"/>
ſtrong Party would be made againſt it: A Report, it ſeems had ran againſt me, that to make Succeſs for my own Play, I had privately found Means or Intereſt that the Second Part of the <hi>Beggars</hi> Opera ſhould be ſuppreſs'd; as if I, a Comedian, had been of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence enough to influence a great Officer of State to rob the Publick of an innocent Diverſion <hi>(if it were ſuch)</hi> that none but that cunning Comedian might entertain them:—But againſt <hi>blind</hi> Malice, and <hi>ſtaring</hi> Inhumanity, whatever is upon the Stage has no Defence! There they knew I ſtood helpleſs and expos'd.—I had not conſider'd, <hi>poor Devil,</hi> that from the Security of a full Pit Dunces might become Wits, Cowards valiant, and Prentices Gentlemen. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch were concern'd in the Murder of my Play I am not certain; I never endeavour'd to diſcover any of my Aſſaſſins; I cannot afford them a better Name, from their unmanly Manner of deſtroying it: It faintly held up its wounded Head till the ſecond Day, and would have ſpoke for Mercy, but was not ſuffered: The Preſence of the Royal Heir appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent could not protect it. I therefore, to ſtop their Clamour, quitted the Actor for the Author, and told them, <hi>That ſince they were not inclined this Play ſhould go farther, I gave them my Word that after this Night it ſhould never be acted again; but that in the mean Time I hoped they would conſider in whoſe Preſence they were, and for that Reaſon at leaſt would ſuſpend what farther Marks of Diſpleaſure they might think I had deſerved.—</hi>After a dead Silence and ſome little Pauſe, ſome few Hands ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd their Approbation.—When the Play went on I obſerv'd about a dozen Perſons, of no extraordinary Appearance, ſullenly walk'd out of the Pit, after which every Scene of it met with Applauſe—But it came too late: <hi>Peace to its Manes.</hi> Now tho' this was the only Tumult that I had known to have been ſo effectually appeas'd, in fifty Years, by any Thing that could be ſaid to an Audience in the ſame Humour; yet it was no Merit in me, becauſe, when

like me you ſubmit to their doing you all the Miſchief they can, they will at any Time be ſatisfied."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have been more particular in the Length of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, as it contains a curious Anecdote on damning <hi>Love in a Riddle,</hi> and carries this Moral, that a <hi>Suſpicion</hi> of an Actor's doing a <hi>baſe Action,</hi> may lay him open to very <hi>ſevere</hi> and <hi>unjuſt</hi> Puniſhments from an <hi>Audience:</hi> This unjuſt Treatment, not three Seaſons ago, became a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Actor's Fortune to meet: The Affair was of a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Nature,</hi> and therefore was thought a <hi>publick Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> had no Right to take it under their Cognizance: The Affair was this.</p>
            <p>There was a certain Lady,—a very fine Lady,—to whom an Actor was once ſo fatally ally'd that the Law gave her a Privilege to call him Husband.—Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band!—O fatal Name! This Lady was young, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſenſible, and virtuous when this Actor fell in Love with her: She had appear'd on the Stage as a <hi>Singer,</hi> and was eſteem'd an admirable one. This Actor, who was at that Time at the Head of the theatric <hi>Revolution,</hi> which brought back the old <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> Actors to their old Houſe at <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> thought this young Woman had ſo much of the <hi>amiable</hi> and <hi>virtuous</hi> in her, that without any other Conſideration, made her his Wife. What connubial Love and Harmony ſubſiſted ſometime between them, thoſe only can judge of whoſe Hearts have felt the inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Delights of a ſincere and mutual Union.—But alas, how ſhort is all human Happineſs!—The Lady began to grow more cool in her Affections to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band than her Duty, her Honour, or her Intereſt, ought to have ſuffer'd her.—Her Heart was eſtrang'd, and foreign Inclinations contaminated her Soul.—What can be ſaid, when ſo much Innocence ſhould plunge ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and raſhly into Vice!—But alas!</p>
            <q>Frailty, thy Name is Woman!</q>
            <p>This domeſtic Unhappineſs of the Actor brought on others: Negligent of every Thing, his Affairs grew worſe, and he was at laſt compell'd to baniſh himſelf to another Kingdom, till Meaſures were taken to make his Creditors eaſy. During his Abſence this bad Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0393400300:70"/>
carried on a Correſpondence of the moſt criminal Nature, and ſpread every falſe Report to injure him in the tendereſt Point, his Honour, that witty Malice could invent, or the damnedſt Fiend perpetrate; it was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her <hi>Husband</hi> was not only <hi>privy</hi> to, but the <hi>willing, procuring, pandering Promoter</hi> of her Crimes, and <hi>his own</hi> Infamy.—Good God!—What will not Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſuggeſt, and Uncharitableneſs believe?—Although</p>

               </note> It is a Kind of Slander to truſt Rumour.</q>
            <p>Yet this vile Notion too far prevail'd, as you will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſee.—The Seaſon of acting was now pretty far advanc'd, and this Actor, as returned to his Employment, was to do his Duty, and get his Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood at the Theatre. The Night came on he was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; and tho' it had been bruited about the Town, that becauſe he was a <hi>willing Cuckold,</hi> there was a very <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Party</hi> form'd to drive him off the Stage, and not ſuffer him to appear again; he paid little Regard to this Rumour, conſcious of his Innocence. But the poor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil found himſelf miſtaken. The Houſe was very early crowded, and the harmonious diſcordant Concert of <hi>Catcals, Whiſtle, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> began to play before the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain drew up.—Well,—though the Actors were all frighten'd, the Play began with Calmneſs and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe; but this was only a Prelude to the Battle: When the Scene came in which he was to appear, there was a dead Silence, till he popp'd his poor Head from behind the Scenes, then at once the Hurley-Burley began, Volleys of Apples and Potatoes, and ſuch vile Traſh, flew about his Ears. He retir'd, the Storm ſubſided; he advanc'd, it began again.—In the moſt humble Geſture and Addreſs, he made a Motion to be heard; it was all in Vain, and he was once more pelted off.—But what can deſcribe, in thoſe dreadful Moments, the Anguiſh of his Heart? Who can conceive the various Agitations of his Soul?—Grief, Rage, Reſentment, Horror, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair mix'd with Reſolution, were all at once fermenting in his Boſom.—But determin'd to go through the Play, he went through it amidſt the greateſt Uproar that ever was heard ſo long a Space in a Theatre, and by a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0393400300:71"/>
confident Heart he ſurmounted what many of leſs Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution would have ſunk under.</p>
            <p>For ſome time after, every Joke in a Part he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſpoke, or if, when he was on the Stage, any Thing was ſaid that alluded to Cuckoldom, the Joke was made alluſive to him, and the Audience had their Laugh. This could be born, and he knew it would die away of itſelf. But on a Trial in Relation to his Wife's Infamy, ſomething gave Offence to a noble <note n="*" place="bottom">C.

            </p>
            <p>I muſt here add a living Inſtance of what Care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable Induſtry will do: The younger <hi>Mills,</hi> not to take from him the Merit he has, is not equal to the late Mr. <hi>Mills:</hi> When he was a young Actor he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Father's Steps, and being endow'd with a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Memory, would get Parts of very great Length, which then he had not a diſtant View of ever perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: This Talent, and his Application to his Buſineſs, made him, in a Courſe of Time, become <hi>uſeful,</hi> which in a Theatre is the beſt Recommendation. On his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to many of Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi>'s Parts, the Town look'd on him in a very indifferent Light; but his being always thoroughly perfect, and improving by Encouragement and Application, many Prejudices inſenſibly wore away, and now he is ſeen in Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi>'s Parts not without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
            <p>I muſt here ſpeak of <hi>myſelf:</hi> When I firſt came on the Stage the Town had very little Hopes of me, nor did I fling out the <hi>Proffer</hi> of any <hi>great Genius,</hi> yet I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and obſervant of my Buſineſs on the Stage, and did all in my Power to become any Way <hi>uſeful.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that for Want of a better Performer, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to be the <hi>Harlequin,</hi> and as few knew who it really was, I was received with more Applauſe than I could have imagin'd; ſufficient enough, if I had not had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Contempt for ſuch <hi>Mummery,</hi> to have rais'd my Vanity: Nor was this my only Succeſs in <hi>Pantomime;</hi> every one who remembers <hi>Doctor Fauſtus</hi> at <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> muſt remember the <hi>Statue:</hi> All the Pantomimical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this magic Statue had a good Effect in that Scene; they ſurpriz'd, they elevated, they pleas'd, and were applauded: I had the Honour to animate that <hi>Statue,</hi> yet as the Applauſe I receiv'd was falſe, I receiv'd it not as a Tribute to the Merit of an Actor, but the Tricks of a <hi>Scaramouch,</hi> or <hi>Sadler</hi>'s <hi>Wells Tumbler:</hi> As I had ſet my

the 20th of <hi>May,</hi> 1740, after hearing ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> of which you may hear more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. But to the Patentee-Actors let us turn our View: They had now gain'd all they wiſhed for, as to their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Management</hi> at <hi>Drury-Lane:</hi> But at the ſame Time the preſent Mr. <hi>Rich</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln's-Inn-Fields</hi> was opened, which not only terrified the Managers at <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> but was in fact, for a great Time, a Draw-back to their Profits; however, both Patents have ſince ſubſiſted a Company with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Fortune: I find nothing after of any Conſequence in the theatric Hiſtory worthy of Notice during the Triumvirate: They long went forward in a ſettled Courſe of Proſperity, which Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi> attributes to their <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<note n="*" place="bottom">

Diligence and Neglect were under an equal Eye, the one never fail'd of its Reward, and the other, by being rarely excuſed, was leſs frequently committed."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet ſure there muſt be ſome Partiality in theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers, and ſome Jealouſy of young Actors; for ſeveral whom they ſlighted became at the other. Stage good Actors, and were in high Eſteem with a great Part of the Town; and ſeveral in their own Houſe have ſince been thought excellent, who in their Menagement ſeldom or ever appear'd. But Appearance, as well as Applauſe, is the <hi>warm Weather</hi> of a <hi>Theatrical Plant.</hi> This Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and ſeveral others, will ſhow that I write as an Hiſtorian ought, without Favour or Affection.</p>
            <p>One Reformation which the <hi>Apologiſt.</hi> and his <hi>Co-Rulers</hi> introduced deſerves Attention, as the preſent Stages ſtand in need of ſuch another.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This Nuſance of having Crouds behind our Scenes is now as intolerable as ever, both to the judicious Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator and careful Player; and nothing but the <hi>Auri Sacra Fames</hi> of the <hi>Managers</hi> would induce them to indulge ſuch an Abuſe of the Stage: They may ſay indeed it has been ſo long a Cuſtom that young Gentlemen of Diſtinction will not be denied, nor is it their Intereſt to deny them.—Pray good Maſter Manager let me ask you a Queſtion:—Will a <hi>dozen Crowns</hi> compenſate the Affront given to a whole Audience of a hundred or a hundred and fifty Pounds?

            <p>Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi> complains juſtly of another Diſtreſs the Managers of a Theatre are under, which, as I have myſelf experienc'd when I was the deputed Manager for <hi>Summer</hi> Companies at <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> and a real one at the <hi>Theatre</hi> in the <hi>Hay-Market,</hi> I ſhall conſider this Particular There is no greater Perſecution in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Playhouſe, than the Perſecution of <hi>bad Authors:</hi> The Managers think their Caſe hard, and the Authors think ſo of theirs: Indeed it would move Pity when an ingenious Indigent has been labouring, <hi>invita Minerva,</hi> to heap up a Pile of Stuff which he calls Poetry, and to depend on it for more Months Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port than he has been ſcribbling it, yet after all to find it rejected. But though rejected in the mildeſt Manner,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0393400300:78"/>
and for the juſteſt Cauſe, yet the Manager muſt fall under ſevere Cenſure, and can have no Taſte for good Writing, nor knows what is Senſe: He muſt be a Blockhead convict: Out comes an Epigram or a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and we are ſtigmatiz'd as Fools, becauſe we will not exhibit a Piece which we are ſure we muſt looſe by. But, pray, if we have Pity for a Gentleman's Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, is our good Nature to carry us ſuch Lengths as will injure ourſelves? No. <hi>Charity begins at home;</hi> and I ſee no Reaſon why a theatrical Trader ſhould not have the ſame Privilege as his Majeſty's other Liege Subjects in Trade, to buy or refuſe what he pleaſes: The Managers ought to be allowed this Liberty of judging Plays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before they are brought on the Stage; for when they are brought on, the Audience will claim the Freedom of judging of them as they think proper: They damn many which are brought on, but they would have nothing elſe to do the Year throughout, were the Managers of a Theatre to exhibit all the theatrical Lumber which is brought to them: To give a Refuſal to theſe Sparks is difficult, and practiſed differently by different Perſons: Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> would ſhow the utmoſt Complaiſance on theſe Occaſions, and by paying the Author Compliments on his Piece, that there were many <hi>pretty Things</hi> in it, but it would not do as it ſtood then, or that it might be alter'd for the better: By this, I ſay, he ſooth'd the Poet's Anger, who though he went not away ſatisfy'd, did not go away enrag'd. Mr. <hi>C.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Theatre has, with Humour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety been compared to a Political State, but the Nature of its Government has never been fixed: Some affirm the natural Conſtitution of a Theatre is a Republick; ſome ſay it is a limited, others an unlimited Monarchy: What is the beſt, or what the original Form of Government was, or what future Kind of Government it may have, the moſt ſhrewd theatric Politician cannot affirm.

The Stage never ſucceded better than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Triumvirate; and as I can never be a ſole Monarch, this is the beſt Form I can think of, which would give me Power equal to a Monarch, though not the titular Honour; for my Co-partners in Empire ſhould be little more than Cyphers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Nothing. They might indeed be <hi>Triumvirs;</hi> but then, like Duke <hi>Trincalo</hi> in the Play, I would Triumvir over them. This may ſeem too vain a Conjecture of my own Parts, and too vain a Contempt of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others; but in the Sequel of this Story you will find, that as I was the Buſtle-maſter General, I was alſo the Commander-General, and Treaty-maſter Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; if with all theſe Commiſſions I could not ſecure to myſelf as much or more Power than moſt Monarchs in fact have, I ought to be ſtigmatiz'd for the erranteſt Dolt that ever pretended to <hi>Machiaveliſm.</hi>

            <p>From the little hopes which the Publick conceived of me as an Actor who would make any Figure, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, Application, and what join'd to them is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the All in All, <hi>Genius,</hi> I roſe into a gradual Eſteem of the Town: But leſt my Significance as an Actor ſhould not be glaring enough, I was reſolved, young as I was, at a Time when the whole Nation was in a Buſtle, to make my Share in it. In the Year 1720, when all Men thought of raiſing Eſtates, and bubbling the World out of what Money they could, I had a violent Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of getting much Money, and making much Noiſe. Would you think it, but I will confeſs the Simplicity of my Heart: I thought then that were I a <hi>South-Sea</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector,
<q>That I wou'd do—Ye Gods!—What I wou'd do!</q>
But as I was, reſolv'd I was to act ſomething <hi>adventrous</hi> within my Sphere; and, unlike the other Projectors, I built my Scheme on a valuable Foundation; and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to City Phraſe, I had the Credit of the beſt Man in <hi>England</hi> to make uſe of: In ſhort, as all were commencing great Men, I was reſolv'd to commence Author, and accordingly alter'd a Play of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s

brought it him, and read it: He told me it was a rough Pebble, yet might do with a little poliſhing; for it was a tolerable good firſt Play: In brief, it pleas'd him ſo much, that he lick'd the rude <hi>Poetic Cub</hi> into that Form in which it afterwards appear'd. On his Conſent it ſhould be brought on the Stage immediately, I could not help ruminating on the Happineſs of my Caſe as an Author; for there was not one Author then living could have brought a Performance on the Stage without infinite Trouble, Vexation, Charge and Intereſt. I took Care it ſhould get into Rehearſal at the Time the Managers had appointed, who were ſo civil as to compliment me with the prime Part of the Seaſon. <hi>It may ſmell pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical in the Noſtrils of Gravity,</hi> yet I cannot here help remarking what Ideas the Thirſt of <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> will raiſe in a generous Mind.

            <p>But as to my Play: When it began to <hi>mellow</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal, and was almoſt ripe enough for the Stage; a peſtilential Blaſt of Envy had like to have deſtroy'd it, and with it all my fair Hopes: A Rumour had gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that truly this Comedy was none of mine, but my Father's; and that he, not willing to ſtand the Bears any more, brought it out under my Name. As ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as this was, it gain'd Belief among many, therefore it was thought neceſſary that I ſhould make a previous Apology to the Town to ſet Matters in a true Light, and to take off Prejudice: Accordingly I wrote a <hi>Letter</hi> to the <hi>Town,</hi> and printed it in one or more of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Papers, in which I told them that, upon my Word and Credit, it was all <hi>my own Doings,</hi> and that my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther never wrote a Line of it, or ſaw it.

The Play liv'd nine Nights.—This being the chief Incident of my Life as an <hi>Author,</hi> I have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what prolix in the Account of it; and have yet ſome more Obſervations to make. I mention'd that I wrote a Letter to the Town previous to the Performance of my Play: Now there is a Parallel to this in the Conduct of Mr. <hi>Colley Cibber,</hi> which is not mention'd in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, his <hi>Apology</hi> not reaching to that Time. Every one muſt remember that three Years ago Mr. <hi>Colley Cibber</hi> brought to <hi>Drury-Lane Theatre</hi> his Play, alter'd from
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0393400300:90"/>
               <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> call'd <hi>King John:</hi> It was no ſooner in Rehearſal, but ſlap the Criticks were at him directly; Letters, Epigrams, Odes, Jokes, and all the Ribraldry of <hi>Grubſtreet</hi> flew about in the Papers, and it was ſaid the Templars, and their <hi>Poſſe Legiſlatus,</hi> were engag'd to damn it. On this Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi> wrote a Letter, directed, <hi>To the Students of the Inns of Court,</hi> and very handſomly and mighty civilly deſired them to do no ſuch Thing. This Letter was new Fuel to the Flame; they fell ſoul of the Letter immediately, from whence he might eaſily conjecture how they would uſe his Play: But what could he do; the Play was juſt ready to be perform'd, the Actors perfect, Scenes painted, and much Time had been ſpent which the Maſter of the Houſe would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have been uſing to his Intereſt, therefore he could not fairly withdraw it: However, he was reſolv'd it ſhould not be damn'd; and fearing the Maſter might inſiſt on its being play'd, what does he, but at a Rehearſal, ſeeing his Play lying on the Prompter's Table, he takes up the Copy, and puts it up into his Pocket <hi>ſnug,</hi> and decently walk'd off with it, reſolving he would not run the Riſque of ſo precarious a Fortune.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here, while I think of it, ſpeak of a Theatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Conduct lately practiſed, nor can I ſpeak of it in any Place more proper than in this: I mean that of Perſons belonging to a Theatre addreſſing the Town by Letters.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, that I and my Father firſt practiſed this Art, with the ſame Succeſs: It laid us open to the Criticiſm of Coffee-houſe Wits, who thought ſoberly on what we wrote haſtily: There was ſuch canvaſſing the Stile; this was not <hi>Grammar,</hi> and that was not <hi>Senſe;</hi> one Thing was <hi>falſe Engliſh,</hi> another a <hi>Cibberiſm:</hi> But beſides the Jokes, which if nothing elſe are nothing at a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l, they debated the Point over, and form'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Parties, which we experienc'd were not to our Advantage. I have, indeed, ſince the Time of my Play, addreſs'd the Town, and with the ſame Succeſs; for I find by our Theatric Squabbles and Altercations we make as much Amuſement to the Town in a Morning, as by our Performance in an Evening. The Contentions
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0393400300:91"/>
for the Part of <hi>Polly</hi> between Mr. <hi>Clive</hi> and my late—I was going to ſay <hi>Wife;—</hi>but a late <hi>Woman</hi> who was call'd by my Name: That Conteſt, I remark, furniſh'd a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Topic for Converſation, Argument, and Publication, and ended with Noiſe and Uproars in the Play-houſe: There has been the ſame Thing practiſed by <hi>Monſieur Denoyer</hi> and <hi>Madamoiſelle Roland,</hi> and before by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Poitier</hi> and <hi>Madamoiſelle Roland, verſus</hi> Meſſieurs <hi>Quin</hi> and <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> and yet another, which made not a little Noiſe, between the two <hi>Harlequins,</hi> Meſſieurs <hi>Philips</hi> and <hi>Woodward.</hi> The Conſequence of all theſe Addreſſes has been this; the Town is call'd into the Playhouſe, as the <hi>dernier Reſort,</hi> to judge of Things which the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the Houſe is only Judge of: When the Judges come to this mixt Court of Judicature, where all preſent may paſs Sentence, they are divided in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and then the Queſtion muſt be decided by Noiſe and Tumult, and they who are the greateſt Rioters carry it. I do not find that any of theſe epiſtolary Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the Town from theatric Performers have done them any Service, nor would I adviſe, on any Occaſion, to have Recourſe to ſuch Expedients: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, there is no Rule without Exception. Mr. <hi>Rich,</hi> who has never ſuffered his People to make Appeals, nor ever made them himſelf, was at laſt drawn in by meer Neceſſity.

Accordingly I got Leave from Mr. <hi>Wilks,</hi> and the other Maſters, to form a young Company, and, to play during the Vacation: This was no bad Thing for the Maſters, nor the inferior Players; for the firſt receiv'd a ſettled Payment for the Uſe of a few old Scenes and Cloaths, and the latter generally five or ſix Days pay <hi>per</hi> Week for two Days Performance.

Here I muſt diſcloſe a Secret; When Mr. <hi>Cibber, ſen.</hi> ſold out his Share in the Patent, I was deſperataly alarm'd, and look'd on it as a Piece of Injuſtice done to myſelf: For I thought his Share, or at leaſt the major Part of his Share, would have devolved upon me as an Inheritance; therefore I looked on myſelf as a <hi>diſinberited Son,</hi> and that <hi>Highmore</hi> had bought, clandeſſinely, my <hi>Birth-Right,</hi> or rather by ſiniſter Means <hi>deprived</hi> me of it.

Perhaps it may be objected we have no <hi>Exchequer,</hi> no <hi>Scenes,</hi> no <hi>Cloaths,</hi> with a long <hi>Et caetera.</hi> What then? You may have Credit enough. . . . Though ſome among you have not much Credit in a <hi>private Capacity,</hi> yet in a <hi>publick Capacity,</hi> as a Body cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, as it were, much Credit will be given: There are monied Men who will adventure Sums on ſuch a Proceeding: Therefore, <hi>Sirs,</hi> no longer ſhew this <hi>Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of <hi>Complaint;</hi> the Means of Freedom are in your own Poſſeſſion, which, if you refuſe, may you be

As we met with much Succeſs, and the Patentees with none at all, they thought to effect by Policy what they could not obtain by Force: They endeavour'd therefore to ſilence us, not by the Authority of the Lord Chamberlain, but that of an Act of Parliament, by which they would prove us Vagabonds.

Having carried this important Point, we had nothing to fear from the Patentees, knowing now that our Succeſs depended ſolely on our own good Conduct, and the Favour of the Publick. I cannot but confeſs that we had diſmal Apprehenſions of the Force of the Act, which would have ſo fix'd the Power of the Patent, that we muſt <hi>invitis animis</hi> have return'd to the Dominions of our former Maſters: We had indeed got a ſpecious Colour of a Licence, and put at the Top of our Bill, <hi>By Licence of the Maſter of the Revels;</hi> for which titular Honour we paid him handſomely; yet we did this rather to induce the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to think we play'd by a legal Authority and under the Sanction of the Court, than for any Right which we thought it conferr'd on us. We could not be ignorant that Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi>'s Company at <hi>Goodman</hi>'s <hi>Fields</hi> was then playing againſt all the Oppoſition that could be made to it, againſt the Power of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and even their Remonſtrances to the Court that it was a Nuſance. In ſhort, it was not then thought in the Power of the Crown to ſuppreſs a Playhouſe, though acting without Royal Licence and Permiſſion, becauſe it was not evidently an illegal Thing. But the Caſe is now alter'd by a late Act of Parliament, which has fix'd all Power in regard to Theatres and theatrical Affairs in the Lord Chamberlain for the Time being: As this Act is of ſuch Importance to the Theatres, and the paſſing it caus'd great Debates in both Houſes, it may be proper to conſider the Cauſe and Reaſons given for having it enacted; in relating which, I may give ſome curious Anecdotes, and State-Secrets, which Mr. <hi>C.

But to the Point. From theſe farcical Satires, a dainty Opportunity offer'd itſelf to the great Man, not only to ſuppreſs thoſe, but to bring all Stages, and all Stage-writings under ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, that nothing ſhould be exhibited for the future that ſhould give him the leaſt Uneaſineſs. Here was an admirable Proof of deep Policy and Sagacity, to make the Satire of his Enemies be the Tools of his Intereſt: A Scheme was laid to accompliſh his Deſign, it was put in Execution, and it ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>I muſt here enter the Verge of private Hiſtory, and by the following Anecdote ſhow, that I have that great Talent of an Hiſtorian, not to dare to ſpeak falſe, and not afraid to ſpeak Truth.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> had remov'd about this Time from <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Fields</hi> to <hi>Lincoln's-Inn Fields</hi> Houſe, which he had hir'd of Mr. <hi>Rich;</hi> His Removal had not anſwer'd his End, and his Affairs began to grow deſperate.

At this ſame Time, in a moſt vile Paper, call'd <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> there was a libellous Production call'd the <hi>Golden Rump,</hi> which the Town and the Mob were Fools enough to think Wit and Humour: Now as the hitting in with the Humour of the multitudinous Mob is very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to a Theatre, a Dramatick Piece was wrote on the <hi>Golden Rump</hi> Subject, and call'd the <hi>Golden Rump,</hi> which was given Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> to be perform'd; but before it was rehears'd it ſo happen'd, no Matter how or why, but ſo it happen'd, that Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> went to <hi>Downing-Street</hi> with this Satirical Farce in his Pocket, which was delivered to a <hi>great Man</hi> for his Peruſal; and it was found to be a ſcurrilous, ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, traiterous, ſcandalous, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> Libel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Majeſty itſelf.

What Secret is this?

            <p>But, laying aſide private Anecdotes of the obtaining the late Playhouſe Act, I muſt mention what was known to all: The Maſters of the two Houſes acting under the Patent made no Oppoſition to this Bill; they did all in their Power to promote it, becauſe it would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, for the preſent, all Theatres but their own: They were ſo full of this Proſpect, that they did not perceive they were at the ſame Time becoming ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Dependants on a M—r; for the Bill contain'd a Clauſe, that the Lord Chamberlain ſhould have a Power of licenſing other Theatres, if he ſo thought proper, within the City and Liberties of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> The Actors were indeed alarm'd, and imagin'd this Act would lay them under Oppreſſions, from which they
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0393400300:102"/>
could gain no proper Redreſs; for the conſtant imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial Way of redreſſing Grievances, in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Theatre, is to raiſe a Revolt, and bring about a Revolution: But the Security of the Maſters of the Playhouſes, and the Alarm of the Actors were both ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, as I ſhall, in the ſubſequent Narration, make appear. If the Lord Chamberlain can grant another Licence, why then ſhould not the Actors, who may be aggriev'd by the preſent Maſters, endeavour to gain one? I only ask that Queſtion here; I may explain it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Place.</p>

to think it the moſt prudent Method to make the beſt Retreat he could: Upon my Soul, though as an Enemy in the Field I could not be diſpleas'd with his Diſtreſs; yet, as he paid ſo many thouſand Pounds to my Father, my honeſt Heart could not but feel for his being plung'd in an Affair he knew nothing of. I cannot blame my Father for ſo advantageouſly ſelling out; and, was my hereditary Claim laid aſide, he acted prudently, and conſequently honeſtly.

            <p>I cannot but here obſerve to the Reader how different our Conduct was at the <hi>Hay-market:</hi> I muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, though we kept our ſimple Heads above Water, we had got out of our Depth; for after our firſt Run of Novelty and Intereſt was over, our Audiences grew thin, which Deficiency we ſupplied by Orders of our own; for in the Theatres, as in Shops, the Appearance of Buſineſs brings Cuſtomers. Nevertheleſs, we found large Deficiencies in the Office; and by the Accounts in our Books we had contracted a very conſiderable Debt; yet we conceal'd the State of our Caſe as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, reſolving to beat our Antagoniſts our of the Field, and by ſuch a Conqueſt ſet every Thing right. If the Patentees at <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> had either known our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or had Prudence and Courage enough to bear with their own for another Seaſon, I know not what the Conſequences might have been: I may ſay it now, I believe we ſhould have been forc'd to a Ceſſation of Arms, and capitulated on the beſt Terms we cou'd have got.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> had either gain'd better Intelligence of the State of our Affairs, or from the State of thoſe at <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> had found the Patentees were heartily
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0393400300:104"/>
tir'd of their expenſive inſtead of lucrative Offices: From one of theſe Reaſons, or both, he had formed a Scheme, which, had it been carried into Execution, muſt have proved very gainful to the Patentees, and very agreeable to the Town, as it would have given them the beſt Plays, play'd by the beſt Performers in <hi>England:</hi> But as well concerted as it was for theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, it was deſtructive of the natural and legal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Actors: They would have become mere Servants to two co-join'd Patentees; nor could have had, on any Diſguſt or Affront, any Power to revolt. The Scheme was for to have <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> Patent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed of the Patentees who were tired of it, at a cheap Rate, and then the Patentees of <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> and <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> to enter into a joint Partnerſhip, and engage the beſt Actors, who ſhould act occaſionally at both Houſes, performing always a Comedy at one Houſe and a Tragedy at the other. There were ſeveral other Conditions which would have prov'd beneficial to the Maſters, which are needleſs to enumerate.</p>
            <p>This Plan, though it has been long thought a new Fineſſe in theatric Policy, yet <hi>Cibber's Apology</hi> ſhows it is an old Stage-Cunning, practis'd, in ſome Meaſure, by Mr. <hi>R—h</hi>'s Father, and Mr. <hi>Owen Swinney.</hi> This Deſign, however, could not be carried into Execution by Mr. <hi>R—h</hi> alone: There was wanting the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> the <hi>Sine qua non;</hi> the Purchaſe Money: On this Occaſion he apply'd to Mr. <hi>Fl—t—d,</hi> who was his Friend, and propoſed <hi>his</hi> purchaſing the Patent, and to enter into a Sort of Partnerſhip: This Propoſal was ſet in ſo advantageous a Light, and ſuch fair Hopes offer'd themſelves, that Mr. <hi>Fl—t—d</hi> came into this Scheme, and purchaſed the Patent of Mr. <hi>Highmore</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Patentees.</hi> On this Turn in Affairs, We at the <hi>Hay-market</hi> were under a moſt terrible Conſternation; we look'd on ourſelves as Perſons who were never to enjoy that Liberty we had ſo ſtrenuouſly endeavour'd to obtain: For this Conjunction of the Patentee Maſters muſt have compell'd us to have returned under their Management, our Affairs being in a very ſad Poſture, and daily growing worſe: But, very happily for us, a Breach happen'd between Mr. <hi>R—h</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fl—t—d</hi> at
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0393400300:105"/>
a Time we could have leaſt ſuſpected it, and that gave us all we wanted, an Opportunity to make the beſt Terms with the latter, get rid of our Stock-Debt, and return to <hi>Drury-Lane:</hi> I ſhall not enter into the Reaſons for this Breach of Friendſhip between the two Maſters, as that Affair has been ſo differently repreſented; but Mr. <hi>R—h</hi> has been chiefly cenſured as having drawn a Gentleman into an Affair, which he would not otherwiſe have thought to have embarked in, and then leaving him to conduct his new Undertaking as he might: But let their Quarrel be what it would, it was advantageous to us; for Mr. <hi>Fl—t—d</hi> being work'd into the higheſt Reſentment, was reſolv'd to make up the beſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and to hurt <hi>R—h</hi> by getting from him his chief Actors, and moſt neceſſary People: Mr. <hi>Quin</hi> was ſoon gained, but on ſuch Terms as no <hi>hired Actor</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore received. At the ſame Time Mr. <hi>Fl—t—d</hi> had entered into a Treaty with us at the <hi>Hay-market,</hi> and agreed to allow all the managing Actors <hi>two hundred Pounds</hi> a Year each, and to ſome a clear Benefit, and to others a Benefit at a lower Rate than uſual. As in all the Tranſactions of that Affair I was <hi>Treaty-Maſter General,</hi> and negociated that important Peace with the Patentee, it may be expected I ſhould enter into a long detail on that Subject. My Conduct in this Reſpect may be ſomewhat ſingular, but I can give ſome Reaſons as an Apology for it: As this will be entering on a new Scene, I will halt a little as well to give my Reader a little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief as myſelf; for I don't know how it is, but I begin to perceive myſelf ſomewhat dull, and perhaps ſome People may have perceiv'd it a great while ago. If then, <hi>Sir Reader,</hi> your Patience and good Nature are worn out, fling down the Book, that you may, when you think proper, begin the next Chapter with a better Temper, and a Spirit more alert and lively,—and all that.</p>

            <p>A great Lawyer, who now makes one of the moſt illuſtrious Figures in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> was as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for his Amours as his Pleadings: What was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0393400300:108"/>
his Gallantry to any Body? Yet was he often cenſured and made the Object of Wit for this Foible. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd his <hi>Lady,</hi> his <hi>Chambermaid,</hi> and <hi>Couſin</hi> all lay-in at the ſame Time: A Friend of his took an Occaſion to ſpeak to him on this Subject by Way of Raillery, in this Manner: They ſay, my L—d, your <hi>Lady</hi> is brought to Bed.<hi>—She is ſo.—</hi>They ſay your <hi>Couſin</hi> and <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaid</hi> are alſo brought to Bed.<hi>—What's that to</hi> ME.—But they ſay you are the Father.<hi>—What's that to</hi> YOU.—Upon which, turning on his Heel, my L—d left Mr. <hi>Impertinent</hi> with a proper Indignation.<hi>—What's that to You,</hi> is the ſole Anſwer I ſhall give to any defamatory Scurrility, and if any Perſon is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with ſuch a Reply, he may get a more ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory one if he knows how.—After this Obſervation it may be proper to reſume my theatrical Story, which I left off at the Treaty with Mr. <hi>Fl—t—d,</hi> to return to <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> Houſe, and act under his Patent.</p>
            <p>As I had been the chief Perſon in raiſing our theatrical <hi>Revolt,</hi> and being of a daring puſhing Temper, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to have the principal Share in the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> of the Company to <hi>Drury-Lane:</hi> I accordingly got myſelf nominated as <hi>Plenipo',</hi> and began my Negociations with Mr. <hi>Fl—t—d:</hi> How happy I was in my Negociations the Event proved; and as I had to deal with a Perſon of Honour and Generoſity, I manag'd the Conduct of the whole Affair in ſuch a Manner as to make it turn out to <hi>myſelf.</hi> In ſhort, I got a good round Sum of Money out of him; for why ſhould I <hi>negociate</hi> and <hi>negociate</hi> and get nothing myſelf. Some People may ſmile to ſee me, on this Occaſion, compare myſelf to another great <hi>Negociator,</hi> and wonder how I and <hi>H—ce W—e</hi> can have any Analogy.

            <p>When I had concluded this Treaty with Mr. <hi>Fl—t—d,</hi> ſo advantageous for the Company, and more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a private Manner to myſelf, we remov'd Bag and Bagage from the <hi>Hay-Market</hi> and return'd to our old Camp at <hi>Drury-Lane:</hi> Our Government was then thought to be fixed in a peaceable Manner; every Thing went on with great Succeſs, and I took Care to be ſo much in the Maſter's Favour, that in the Direction of the Theat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When I found out this, I was not a little nettled; a Jealouſy raiſed various Sentiments in my Breaſt; for, like <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, my Soul diſdain'd the Thought of an Equal. Glory and Power are the darling Paſſions of my Heart; and not to enjoy either of them was, to ſo jealous an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, a meer Shade to my Laurels. My Competitor
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0393400300:110"/>
was the Perſon who had been concern'd for Mrs. <hi>Wilks,</hi> and who thought himſelf to have an admirable Talent for theatric Affairs. This Talent was to compoſe <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomimes,</hi> furbiſh up old Tricks, and make what he call'd Entertainments: As a Specimen of what Notion he had of the Dignity of the Stage, I muſt obſerve, that his Genius turn'd to the monſtrous and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous; for which Reaſon nothing could be brought to Town to be exhibited to the Vulgar, but he was for having it exhibited on the Stage: There was a Fellow of an enormous Height came from <hi>Germany</hi> to be ſhewn for a Sight, call'd <hi>Mynheer Cajanus:</hi> Such a Spectacle, proper enough for a <hi>Smithfield</hi> or <hi>Moorfields</hi> Booth, was thought a proper Perſonage to grace the Theatre Royal. Accordingly Negociations were begun; but to my Honour be it ſpoke, I had no Concern in them: I was kept out of the Secret, nor was I much affected that I was ſo. I and his Grace the Duke of <hi>A—le,</hi> in this Reſpect, may be ſaid to have the ſame Notion of Things: His late Speech on the State of the Nation ſhows that he was out of the Secret, in Regard to the Conduct of Affairs, and, as he thinks them wrong, was proud that none of them could be laid to his Charge: though I and that illuſtrious Perſon differ in other Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents in Regard to the preſent Miniſtry, yet I am proud that in this Point he agrees with me.—But to the Hiſtory: <hi>Mynheer</hi> ſoon agreed to ſome very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Terms propoſed to him; was with all Secrecy convey'd into <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> Theatre, and was ſoon ſhown ariſing from a Trap-Door, to the no ſmall Admiration of the Spectators, and the no ſmall Joy of my Co-Rival. Nothing could give me and my Brethren, both of the Buskin and the Sock, who had any Regard for that School of Honour and Virtue, the Stage, more ſecret Indignation than to ſee it proſtituted in ſo ignominious a Manner: And what ſtill added to our Reſentment was the conſummate Folly of the Town, who crouded to the Houſe a great Number of Nights to ſee the <hi>Tall Man.</hi> But I had yet other Reaſons to be no Friend to this <hi>Tall Man.</hi> It regretted my Soul, frequently and oft, when on Buskins a Foot and a half high I was to perſonate a great Heroe, and had my wavy Plume high o'er my

            <p>Now I was not hardy enough to make any publick Remonſtrances on this Occaſion; for I had a Point to carry, which was to fix my Wife's Character as an Actreſs, whoſe firſt Performance was to be cloſed with theſe <hi>Sadler</hi>'s <hi>Wells Tumblers:</hi> On this Account it was my Buſineſs to be as well with the <hi>Maſter</hi> as poſſible; and, though I from my Soul abhor'd ſuch Meaſures, yet no one was more buſtling and commendatory in the Deſign than myſelf: By this I not only ſhow'd an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to his Intereſt, but kept myſelf on good Terms with the other Miniſter: But had I thought it would have been any <hi>Gain</hi> to me, to have <hi>diſtreſs'd</hi> the Maſter by making any Remonſtrances, my Father's <hi>Hardineſs</hi> ſhould not have come up to mine; for I would not have gone ſneaking into the Pit in hugger-mugger: Not I truly; But bounce upon the Stage, with bluſtering Mood, have ſtalk'd and made a ſpeech, which, with pathetick Air in Words and Action, had repreſented our Diſaſters dire; and though they had hiſs'd again and yet again, I'd have ſtood 'em all till they had heard me out.—On this ingenuous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of how I did act or how I would have acted, ſome may ſay, <hi>Are theſe Principles honourable?

You muſt know, Reader, that even by the Time I had reach'd my eighth Year, my Papa ſaid I was a ſad <hi>young Dog,</hi> and upon ſome Prank I had play'd, I was in ſome Diſgrace: It happen'd I went into his Chamber, to endeavour a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation one Morning; and as he had gone to Bed in his Cups over Night, he had, I ſuppos'd, drop'd a couple of Guineas out of his Breeches; be that how it will, I ſaw the two pretty ſparkling Rogues lie at the Edge of the Carpet, by his Bed-ſide: What does I, but Slap runs to the happy Spot, fell on my Knees, and, like a good and dutiful Child, cried out, in a devout
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0393400300:114"/>
Tone, <hi>Pray, Father, bleſs me, and pray to G—d to bleſs me, and make me his true and faithful Servant for ever and ever,</hi> Amen.—He, ſurpris'd at ſuch a ſudden Strain of filial Duty, (for I don't believe I ever ask'd him Bleſſing twice before in my whole Life) ſtroak'd me down the Head, and bid me riſe, by which Time I had, by Slight of Hand, touch'd the Spankers, and convey'd them ſnug into my Pocket;—and he will never have heard of them ſince, till he reads this <hi>Apology</hi> for ſuch an Action; that, as I thought they would be a <hi>Convenience</hi> to me, my <hi>Conſcience</hi> was not too dainty to take them.<hi>—E minimis majora.—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this Harangue on my Philoſophy is neceſſary, though it may ſeem odd to many Readers, becauſe it is an <hi>apologetical</hi> Defence for every Action of my Life at once: I may indeed illuſtrate it by more Inſtances in the Sequel of my Story, but ſhall now return where this Digreſſion began.—The Company went on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mr. <hi>F—d</hi> with very great Succeſs, equal to the greateſt under <hi>Cibber, Wilks,</hi> and <hi>'Booth:</hi> As for me, I was occaſionally more or leſs in his Favour and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt as it ſuited my own Convenience; for he ſhow'd me many Inſtances of his Readineſs to ſerve me, and was on all Occaſions prompt and ready to do Acts of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> and <hi>good Nature.</hi> The Stage was then as well rul'd by <hi>my Aſſiſtance,</hi> as a Gentleman not brought up to it, cou'd rule it; yet as it was my Opinion, and ſeveral other Players, that <hi>no Gentleman</hi> is proper for the <hi>Maſter</hi> of a <hi>Theatre,</hi> we were not abſolutely contented, and we did not want for <hi>Grumbletonians</hi> in a <hi>theatric Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> We knew indeed that our <hi>Maſter</hi> had redeem'd us from a thouſand Inconveniencies we had labour'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, gave us our own Terms, but yet we did not look upon him with an equal Eye, and thought that Actors were the only proper and fit Perſons to rule over Actors, and receive all the Profits of a Theatre. Theſe, I ſay, were Maxims that the chiefeſt Actors embrac'd, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated into others, as the fundamental Rights of our Conſtitution: On this the Company became uneaſy, and form'd themſelves into little Factions, and Cabals, but which could not then have been attended with any ill Conſequences to the Patentee. But theſe little Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0393400300:115"/>
were greatly heighten'd by the following Event. On the late Act for licenſing the Number of Stages taking Place, Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi>'s Company acting then at <hi>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields,</hi> to whom Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> had let it, were oblig'd to break up, and provide for themſelves in the acting Companies as well as they could: Mr. <hi>F—d</hi> on this Occaſion took ſevera! into <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> and to make Way for them, diſmiſs'd ſeveral, who had long been appertaining to that Theatre. Mrs. <hi>Giffard</hi> and Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> were themſelves likewiſe afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd. This gave new Uneaſineſs to the old Stock, for we look'd on them in a contemptible Light; and when the Seaſon came on, and Parts were caſt to theſe <hi>exotic</hi> Actors, ſtill more and more murmuring Taunts and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies aroſe. The Maſter favour'd ſeveral of theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Recruits in a particular Manner, and ſeem'd to make them his Confidents and Favourites. This ſtill made more Faction in our State, till at laſt it was divided into two Parties, the <hi>Riff-Raffs,</hi> and the <hi>Scabs.</hi> The firſt were the Maſter's Party, the latter <hi>mine;</hi> his were as the preſent Courtiers, and mine as the <hi>Patriots.</hi> The Titles may ſeem coarſe to the Ears of Delicacy, but why not as good and ſignificant as the preſent Names of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction in <hi>Sweden,</hi> the <hi>Hats</hi> and the <hi>Night-Caps,</hi> or indeed as our own <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory.</hi> Another notable Mark of Diſtinction was, the Maſter's Party inſtituted a famous <hi>Club</hi> of <hi>Riff-Raffs,</hi> call'd the <hi>Ox-Cheek-Club;</hi> and this was erected on the Ruins of a Club, which the old <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> Company had formerly erected. Theſe Party-Diviſions are in a theatrical Government as prejudicial to the publick Good, as in a political one. The Buſineſs of the Stage was not follow'd with that Spirit and Alacrity as when Unanimity reigns in the Hearts of the People. I did, I frankly confeſs, what a theatrical Patriot ſhould do, foment all the Diſcord, raiſe all the Jealouſies, in order, at a proper Time and Seaſon, to raiſe a Rebellion, and bring about a new Revolution; and theſe Sentiments of <hi>Patriotiſm</hi> have been ſince very ſerviceable to me in another Reſpect, for in my <hi>political Eſſays,</hi> which I had the Honour to write in Defence of the <hi>Preſent Adminiſtration,</hi> I have charg'd all theſe Maxims home upon the Gentlemen in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0393400300:116"/>
the Country-Party, for my Father has prov'd the Rules for the <hi>Stage</hi> and <hi>State</hi> are the ſame in Parallel, ſo alſo muſt be thoſe of <hi>Patriotiſm.</hi> About this Time alſo I found the Wings of my Power clip'd in Relation of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding over Rehearſals, and brought on one Morning a round Quarrel between <hi>Q—n</hi> and <hi>Me;</hi> for I had long look'd on him as a proud imperious Blockhead, and he on me as a vain impertinent Coxcomb; and perhaps we might both be ſomewhat right in our Conjectures. In this Conteſt I valued nothing ſo much as his Contempt of <hi>Me;</hi> for on my ſmart cutting Repartees on him, he cry'd, with a <hi>Laugh, Quarrelling with ſuch a Fellow, is like ſh—t—g</hi> on a <hi>T—d,</hi> walking off as cool as a Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.—And that was the Sire of the Rencounter we afterwards had at the <hi>Bedſord</hi> Coffee-Houſe. All theſe Affairs happening, and my Trial not turning out to my Favour, my Soul became chagrin'd both with the Place and my Maſter: I was therefore reſolved to leave that Stage, and for ſuch Reaſons as you will meet with in the Sequel of my Story. Therefore as ſoon as my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit was over, I determin'd, according to an old Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice I had got, of being of no more Service to the Maſter that Seaſon, to appear no more that Year, and indeed no more at all, while he was concern'd there.—Retiring therefore from <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> into the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and convenient Air of <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> I flung off the <hi>Comedian,</hi> and commenc'd <hi>Politician;</hi> but as by entering on that Subject, I ſhall begin a new Farce, it would be more proper to let the Curtain of this Chapter drop here.</p>

In this I thought to kill two Birds with one Stone, as I could at the ſame Time take an Opportunity of revenging myſelf to the full on Mr. <hi>Fl—t—d,</hi> by <hi>ſatirizing</hi> him, not only as to his <hi>theatrical Affairs,</hi> but with Regard to his <hi>private Oeconomy.</hi> Accordingly I went to work and wrote a Pamphlet call'd the <hi>Country Correſpondent,</hi> in which I have ſhewn a Specimen of my moral, theatrical, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical, and gallant Character.

               <hi>Ja ne ſcai quoy</hi> would diſtinguiſh the Author. On my publiſhing the <hi>Country Correſpondent,</hi> and being known for its <hi>Sire,</hi> many were the Criticiſms upon it: Some called me a <hi>Coxcomb</hi> for writing ſo much upon <hi>myſelf:</hi> Some called me a <hi>baſe impudent Fellow</hi> for publiſhing ſuch Invectives againſt Mr. <hi>Fl—t—d,</hi> who had been my <hi>Friend:</hi> Others fell foul on me becauſe I had openly, boldly, and ſtrenuouſly eſpouſed the Cauſe of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</hi> As for being called a <hi>Coxcomb,</hi> I had been ſo long us'd to it that it ſeem'd as natural to me as my own Name; nor did the Accuſations againſt me for libelling Mr. <hi>Fl—t—d</hi> give me any Pain: They who had odd Notions of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Honeſty</hi> ſaid that I was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Raſcal, and this and that and t'other; but they might as well have ſung Pſalms to a Cow, for my <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> could <hi>away with it.</hi> What I did was conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently neceſſary, and if from being an obliged Friend I became a mortal Enemy, what more is it than what frequently happens among <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> of <hi>Empires. Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Antony</hi> had their fierce Conteſt for the World; and what was the Cauſe of the Quarrel between Sir <hi>R—t W—e</hi> and Mr. <hi>P—y,</hi> but Ambition in the one, and a Diſregard of his Claims in the other. In all theatrical as well as political Diviſions, to ſucceed in your Deſign you muſt go through <hi>thick</hi> and <hi>thin;</hi> the Sword of <hi>Defiance</hi> is drawn, and the Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard muſt be thrown away: Every one who has read <hi>Machiavel</hi> knows theſe Tenets are juſtifiable: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever <hi>Falſhood, Scandal, Infamy,</hi> and <hi>Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> my <hi>Country Correſpondent</hi> might have contain'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Fl—t—d,</hi> yet it being conſiſtent with my <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Views,</hi> no one who knows Men and Things can blame me; for I ſhall explain myſelf by giving ſome Reaſons which were then in Embrio, why I ſo acted. I had determined to be as well with the <hi>M—ſt—y</hi> as poſſible, and to merit ſomething from them, I undertook firſt to be a Kind of an <hi>Informer</hi> of what they call'd the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrical Secrets. Our Maſter had publickly eſpous'd the Party in Oppoſition to the <hi>M—ſt—r,</hi> and was firmly attach'd to the Intereſt of the P—of <hi>W—</hi>: This Conduct I heard was reſented by the <hi>M—ſt—r,</hi> with whom he had once been on very good Terms: I thought
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0393400300:119"/>
therefore any private Intelligence againſt the Maſter, if I could poſſibly make it a <hi>political</hi> Concern, would be an Introduction to his Favour, and aſſiſt my future Scheme. An Incident happen'd as favourable as I could wiſh: A certain <hi>Iriſh Author</hi> was writing a <hi>Tragedy,</hi> which was, by his Friends, who were reckon'd the tiptop Criticks in Town, ſaid to be a Performance of ſuch extraordinary Merit, that no Tragedy ſince <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Time could equal it, either for the <hi>Sublimity</hi> of the <hi>Ideas,</hi> the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>Stile,</hi> the <hi>Nobleneſs</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> and the <hi>Conduct</hi> of the <hi>Scene:</hi> That it was wrote in the Defence of <hi>Freedom,</hi> and had ſuch Speeches that at that <hi>Criſis</hi> of Time it would run as long as <hi>Cato</hi> had at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother particular <hi>Criſis.</hi> This <hi>dainty Tragedy</hi> was the much nois'd, much ſubſcrib'd for GUSTAVUS VASA, written by HENRY BROOKE, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> The Maſter had great Expectations from it; and though it had been often read in private Company before it was brought to the Houſe; yet I knew little of it till then, as I was look'd upon as a Malecontent to the Maſter, and conſequently out of the Secrets of the Miniſtry. But as ſoon as it had been read in the Green-Room, and the Parts deliver'd out to the Actors, and I was acquainted perfectly with the Play, I was determined I would take ſuch Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that it ſhould not be acted; which would ſhew to the Miniſter what Zeal I had for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and at the ſame Time, indulge that Spirit of Revenge which I had againſt the Maſter. Now what does I, but repreſented to Mr.—no Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for his Name—but it was the proper Perſon to make ſuch an <hi>Information</hi> to, that this ſame Tragedy of <hi>Guſtavus Vaſa</hi> was a ſcandalous Libel againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſome Lines in the Praiſe of Liberty were ſo introduc'd as to make ſtrong <hi>Inuendoes</hi> that the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>England</hi> was in Danger: This I repreſented with ſuch a Vehemence of Words and Action, that it gain'd Credit, and before it was ready to be perform'd, it was prohibited by my <hi>Lord Chamberlain.</hi> The Prohibition open'd the Mouths and Hearts of the Admirers of this Tragedy, and they talk'd roundly about the Injuſtice and Oppreſſion the Author and the Maſter of the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe met with, which they attributed to the Fear the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0393400300:120"/>
Miniſtry had of its being perform'd on the Stage. Now to give my own impartial Thoughts on this Affair, I avow that I believe there was no Harm in the Play, nor do I think it would have met with that great Succeſs as was expected from it; for on the Publication it was not judg'd near equal to the Character that had been given it. However I cannot but make this Obſervation, that from the Action on the Stage, and the Aſſiſtance of the Scenes and Actors, it might have received ſuch addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Strength, that it might, by the further Aid of a Party, have had a Run of ten Nights. And here I muſt obſerve again, that it was with great Policy and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the Miniſter obtain'd the <hi>Licenſing Act,</hi> for though the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Preſs</hi> allows a refus'd Play to be printed, yet the Reading of it in the Cloſet will not convey an adequate Idea to the Repreſentation on a Theatre: Mr. <hi>Colley Cibber,</hi> who is a moſt ſtrenuous <hi>Champion</hi> for the <hi>Licenſing Act,</hi> has fully conſider'd this Difference between a Performance <hi>printed</hi> only, and when it is acted.—Thus he argues <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>C. Cibber</hi>'s Apology, p. 169.</note>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"It was ſaid that this Reſtraint upon the Stage would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy the Evil complain'd of: That a Play refus'd to be licens'd would ſtill be printed with double Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, when it ſhould be inſinuated that it was refus'd for ſome Strokes of Wit, and would be more likely then to have its Effect among the People: However natural this Conſequence may ſeem, I doubt it will be very difficult to give a <hi>printed</hi> Satire, or Libel, half the Force or Credit of an <hi>acted</hi> one. The moſt artful or notorious Lye, or ſtrain'd Alluſion that ever ſlander'd a great Man, may be read by ſome People with a Smile of Contempt, or at worſt it can but impoſe on one Perſon at once. But when the Words of the ſame plauſible Stuff ſhall be repeated on a Theatre, the Wit of it among a Crowd of Hearers is liable to be overvalued, and may unite and warm a whole Body of the Malicious and Ignorant into a Plaudit: Nay, the, partial Claps of only twenty ill-minded Perſons among ſeveral hundred of ſilent Hearers, ſhall, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0393400300:121"/>
often have been miſtaken for a general Approbation, and frequently draw into their Party the Indifferent or the Inapprehenſive, who rather than not be thought to underſtand the Conceit, will laugh with the Laughers, and join in the Triumph! But alas! the quiet Reader of the ſame ingenious Matter, can only like for <hi>himſelf,</hi> and the Poiſon has a much ſlower Operation upon the Body of a People, when it is ſo retail'd out, than when told to a full Audience by Wholeſale: The ſingle Reader too may happen to be a ſenſible, unprejudic'd Perſon, and then the merry Doſe, meeting with the Antidote of a ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, perhaps may have no Operation at all: With ſuch a one the Wit of the moſt ingenious Satire will only, by its intrinſic Truth or Value, gain upon his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, or, if it be worth an Anſwer, a printed Falſhood may poſitively be confounded by printed Proofs againſt it. But againſt Contempt and Scandal heighten'd by the Skill of an Actor, ludicrouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing it into a Multitude, there is no immediate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to be made, or equal Reparation to be had, for it would be but a poor Satisfaction at laſt, after lying long patient under the Injury that Time only is to ſhew which would probably be the Caſe, that the Author of it was a deſperate Indigent, that did it for Bread: How much leſs dangerous and offenſive then, is the <hi>written</hi> than the acted Scandal? The Impreſſion the Comedian gives it, is a Kind of double Stamp in the Poet's Paper, that raiſes it ten Times to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic Value.<p>Upon the whole; if the Stage ought ever to have been reform'd; if to place a Power ſomewhere of reſtraining its Immoralities was not inconſiſtent with the Liberties of a civiliz'd People, (neither of which any moral Man of Senſe can diſpute) might it not have ſhewn a Spirit too poorly prejudic'd to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſo rational a Law, only becauſe the Honour and Office of a Miniſter might happen, in ſome ſmall Meaſure, to be protected by it."</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt annotate, that all that is ſaid here in Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to comic Satire, and the Comedian, is, <hi>vice verſa,</hi> equally applicable to the Tragedy and Tragedian: For
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0393400300:122"/>
when a mad brain'd tragic Author has ſtream'd into a Patriotic Stile, pompouſly rolling into vilifying Periods, ſignifying roundly nothing, but Invectives againſt a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, the pompous Buskins and Plumes of Tragedy, together with the Aſpect and Elocution of the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, ſo ſpeak and play with the Imagination, that they deceive the Judgment, and win over many Spectators who might have thought them ſcandalous Bombaſt, had they been read ſoberly in the Cloſet. This, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, was the Fate of <hi>Guſtavus Vaſa,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for after the Prohibition, the Author publiſh'd Advertiſements for a Subſcription, aad in thoſe Advertiſements made his Cauſe the Cauſe of the Publick, inſinuating it was refus'd for ſome Strokes of Liberty, which were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to People in Power: This indeed anſwer'd his Ends in point of Profit, for being the firſt Play re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd ſince the Commencement of the Act, People's Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity were rais'd not only by wanting to ſee the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Play, out of political Reaſons, but becauſe it was ſaid by common Rumour to be a moſt excellent Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy: The Profit of the Subſcription was equal to what his moſt ſanguine Hopes might have promis'd him from the Stage. As this may be the moſt proper Place for it, I muſt inſert another Remark on refus'd Plays. After this Succeſs of the Subſcription of <hi>Guſtavus Vaſa,</hi> all the tragic Bards who were under the Influence of Mr. <hi>L—tt—t—n,</hi> Prime Miniſter at <hi>N—rf—k</hi> Houſe, threw into bombaſt Scenes all the Patriot-Liberty Flights their own little Geniuſes could ſuggeſt, or their Patron and Court of Aſſiſtants could muſter up! Some indeed ſay they did not, on this Occaſion, inſert any Thing new, but that they had all from the firſt, wrote according to their Inſtructions, and had fill'd their Scenes with the worn-out, unfaſhionable Notions of Liberty and publick Spirit: The next refus'd Plays were the <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Eleonara,</hi> of Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> at <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and a Tragedy wrote by Mr. <hi>Pattiſon</hi> at <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> both of which were publiſh'd by Subſcription, and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd that they fell the Martyrs to Freedom, publick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Devil and all: But, as the homely Proverb ſays, Enough is as good as a Feaſt: The Publick had been cram'd by <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Guſtavus</hi> to Satiety; and Satiety,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0393400300:123"/>
from a natural Effect it has on the Generality of Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs of Mankind, will not allow an Avidity for more; for, as Mr. <hi>Colley Cibber</hi> philoſophically and beautifully obſerves <note n="*" place="bottom">

was ſo.—I will now draw the Back Scene of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and ſtill enlarge the Proſpect: It was in the Vacation of laſt Summer, when having retreated from <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> I retir'd to <hi>Charing-Croſs.</hi> My Enemies gave out, that I went there for ſome trifling Sums I had run in Debt for at Mrs. <hi>St—w—d</hi>'s, and ſome other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable reputable Bawdy-Houſes in <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> Piazzas. . . . Vile Inſinuation! How weak the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Man to account for Conduct of great Men, when they are ignorant upon what Principles they move.—What reflective Witticiſms and Inuendoes have been flung at Sir—about this ſecret Expedition, which has been ſo long fitting out: What Things have been ſaid about a Suſpenſion, or Ceſſation of Arms, and I don't know what, when, at the ſame Time, the great Man acts upon other Meaſures than they gueſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to proceed on other Motives than they imagine.—I was us'd in the ſame Manner as to my <hi>ſecret Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to <hi>Charing-Croſs:</hi> And as it is now over, and to put ſuch fruitleſs Revilers to the Bluſh, I will tell them my Motives to it: <hi>Imprimis,</hi> as I was going to commence M—al Writer, it was proper I ſhould live near the M—r, not only for more eaſily attending his Levees, but to be more readily ſent for to attend a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conference, and receive Inſtructions whom I was to laſh, what I was to defend, what gainſay, when to give the evaſive, and when the downright Lie: All which Things are neceſſary for a Writer to know, who has ſuch a Patron to defend.—As for the Frequency of my private Conferences, and the Nature of my Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall prudently be ſilent; Inſtructions given to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, tho' mov'd for by Members of the Houſe of C—s to be laid before them, are not to be revealed in ſuch a Manner: But as to my frequenting a <hi>Levee</hi> in <hi>Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſtreet,</hi> that is notoriouſly known; and I can ſay, with ſome Elevation of Heart, few in his Circle were more diſtinguiſh'd for their Senſe, Learning, Virtue, Honour, Policy, Ability, and Eloquence, than your little humble Servant <hi>T. C.—</hi>But beſides theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, my Printer and Publiſher lived at that Place, and it is beſt for an Author to confer with his Printer very often; as how the Sale goes on, and whether any Caſh

is become due, without mentioning the Neceſſity of correcting the Sheets from the Preſs; for what a ſad Figure an Author makes in Print who don't know how to make his Stops: I therefore  always ſtop my Works myſelf: though as for the Spelling I leave that to the Printer's Boy. Sure then theſe are ſufficient Reaſons to take off the Obloquy that was caſt on me, that vile <hi>Catchpoles</hi> drove me to a Place which I out of mere Policy retired to. — Well, there it was I compoſed my <hi>Country Correſpondents,</hi> in all which I continued my Attack on Mr. <hi>Fl—t—d;</hi> and in a miſcellaneous rhapſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Way defended the P— M—r Tooth and Nail: In Taverns I eat for him, drank for him, talk'd for him, and when I went home about Four o'Clock in the Morning I wrote for him.</p>

            <p>This ſtrenuous Attachment of mine to the <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</hi> drew on me the Abuſe of the <hi>Country Party;</hi> and I was libell'd under the Character of <hi>Piſtol</hi> in a ſcandalous Paper call'd <hi>Common Senſe.</hi> The Author of that Journal is a profligate forging Fellow; for he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted Letters from <hi>Piſtol,</hi> with an Inſinuation (as I go by the Name of <hi>Piſtol</hi>) that they came from me, which was as <hi>notorious</hi> a <hi>Fib</hi> as his Predeceſſor <hi>Miſt</hi> told of <hi>Colley Cibber;</hi> and I take this Opportunity to avow to the whole World that I never had any thing to do with <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> nor ever will: Fron my <hi>Soul</hi> I <hi>heartily</hi> deſpiſe it; and from this Moment, till <hi>Atropos</hi> with fatal Shears ſhall ſnip the ſpinning Thread of vital Life, <hi>Common Senſe</hi> and I are Enemies, and ſo, Mr. <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> your humble Servant.— But it ſeems my great Apologiſt himſelf was droll'd upon for his State-writings: I mean the Comedy of the <hi>Non-Juror,</hi> and <hi>Myn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The Compliment in the latter Part I confeſs I did not diſlike, becauſe it came from ſo impartial a Judge; and it really ſo happen'd that the former Part was very near true; for I had juſt that very Day crawl'd out, after having been ſome Weeks laid up with a Fever: However I ſaw no Uſe in being thought to be thoroughly dead before my Time, and therefore had a Mind to ſee whether the Town cared to have me alive again.

Now as he knew that I was a ſtrong Malecontent at <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> and was ſenſible what Torrents of Ambition roll'd tumultuouſly o'er my Soul, having deriv'd their Source from his own Spring, he was aſſured that I would come into any Scheme that would ſooth my Ambition, and put me at the Head of a Company <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſtirring up Revolts, heading Rebellions, and bringing about Revolutions, he thought proper to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to me a Deſign of gaining over to his Intereſt ſome principal Players of <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> Company, and then ſetting up a new Company under a Licenſe, which he did not doubt, for his great Merit and Services, he could eaſily obtain.—This Scheme jump'd with my own Way of Thinking, and I came into it with Heart and Hand; nor did he omit hinting to me that his only Motive to ſuch a Deſign, <hi>when it began to grow late in Life with him,</hi> was purely to retrieve the Honour of the <hi>Britiſh Theatre,</hi> and leave me handſomely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for. Now though I knew he did not care a Ruſh for me, nor would, out of pure Love, give me a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to keep me from the Gallows, yet I had learn'd Art enough to diſguiſe my real Opinion, and give his Propoſal the Turn he would have it take. Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on this Deſign, we did ſecretly all we could to bring it about; for your important Schemes cannot be executed as ſoon as plan'd, and therefore we were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to wait a proper Opportunity, which was, while the Articles of ſome of the principal Actors under Mr. <hi>Fl—t—d</hi> were expired. In the mean Time, laſt Summer, to deſerve ſomething from the M—y when I ſhould petition for any Favour, <hi>more Paterno,</hi> I took up my Pen, wrote <hi>Country Correſpondents</hi> and <hi>Gazetteers</hi> in Defiance of <hi>Common Senſe</hi> and all its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents.—So, Mr. <hi>Reader,</hi> you now know for what Reaſon I commenc'd <hi>Politician:—</hi>Well, methinks I hear ſome <hi>John Trot</hi> object and ſay,—Is writing <hi>Country Correſpondents,</hi> and <hi>Gazetteers</hi> of ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence?—Yes, Sir, to write as I did, and lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me like a <hi>Drawcanſir,</hi> and all that, Sir, is look'd on as meritorious; and Merit is to be rewarded.—All that Summer was chiefly ſpent in <hi>Politicks</hi> and <hi>Amours;</hi> for I, as well as Sir—, or—, muſt have my Relaxations and Divertiſements after the Concerns of a Nation have been pothering in my Brain:—I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the old Maxim:</p>

            </q>
            <p>A Maxim I always follow, when fatigued either with the Affairs of the <hi>State,</hi> or the <hi>Stage,</hi> and the Example of my Betters keep me in Countenance, when I make this publick Confeſſion of it.—To return:—That my Politicks would not ſupport me, I ſoon found out, though had a particular <hi>Right Honourable Gentleman</hi> taken me more particularly under his Patronage, it might have been worth <hi>his</hi> While, as well as <hi>mine;</hi> I might have been of great Service to him, for I could have made as good a <hi>Buſtle-Maſter-General</hi> in St. <hi>St—s</hi>'s <hi>Chapel,</hi> as behind the <hi>Scenes:</hi> Of this I gave him a Hint in one of my Pamphlets, and told him with what an Air the <hi>young Captain</hi> could Ioll in his <hi>Chariot,</hi> while it roll'd down to the Houſe, and that he could make Speeches to a <hi>Senate,</hi> as well as to an Audience.—But if People can't take a Hint, whoſe Fault is that?

new Maſter the getting up the <hi>Rehearſal.—</hi>Rehearſal, ſaid he,—umph! And who can do <hi>Bayes?</hi> O! Sir, ſays I, you need not have ask'd that Queſtion, when you have taken me into your Company.—Umph! ſays he,—and took a Pinch of Snuff, and remain'd ſilent.—I urg'd the Thing, and what Houſes it would bring, if I had the Management of getting it up. . . . His Anſwer came from him by half Sentences, and Inuendoes, and Pinches of Snuff, as, . . . <hi>No, . . . 'Twont do. . . .</hi> [Snuff] <hi>The Character. . . . The Character of Bayes ſupported it. . . . 'Twas a Hazard. . . . 'Twou'd be an Expence. . . . Wou'd adviſe me not to think of it. . . .</hi> [Snuff] <hi>My Father indeed to have play'd it might do ſomething. . . . The Town wou'd make Compariſons. . . . Perhaps not for my Advantage. . . . The Expences, in ſhort, wou'd be too conſiderable. . . .</hi> (Here it was eaſy to underſtand him) I therefore propos'd to him to add ſuch a ludicrous Spectacle, as, by his Advice and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, might bring great Audiences, though a Thing of a trivial Nature. . . . Here I knew I ſhould tickle him: In ſhort, I propos'd to reinforce <hi>Bayes's Troops,</hi> and, with a new Set of <hi>Hobby Horſes,</hi> raiſe two new Regiments, who ſhould Exerciſe in martial Order upon the Stage, and by their capering and prancing like me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd War-Horſes, divert the Multitude; and that the <hi>Captandum vulgus</hi> he knew was the <hi>ſine qua non</hi> in the Theatre. . . . This did all I wanted; he came into my Scheme, and was ſo very full of the additional Troops, that he undertook to <hi>raiſe</hi> them <hi>himſelf,</hi> which he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did, but attended at all their <hi>Exerciſes</hi> and <hi>Muſters,</hi> and <hi>Reviews,</hi> was <hi>Riding-Maſter, Adjutant-General,</hi> and <hi>Generaliſſimo. . . .</hi> When it was perform'd I met with an Applauſe might ſatisfy the greateſt Vanity; and my <hi>Hobby-Horſe Regiments</hi> had as great Applauſe as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: The remaining Part of the Seaſon went on with great Succeſs to the Maſter, by my Rehearſal, and my additional Troops had as many Spectators at <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> as his M—'s Houſhold Troops at a Review in <hi>Hyde-Park:</hi> This continu'd till the Maſter brought his <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Eurydice</hi> on the Stage, after which there was no Occaſion for Mr. <hi>Bayes;</hi> the <hi>Twinkum Twankum</hi> of Mr. <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and the <hi>Metamorphoſes</hi> of

               <hi>Monſieur Harlequin,</hi> put my Troops to the Rout. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever at the Cloſe of the Seaſon, I made a Rally, and brought myſelf and my Army for one Night more into the Field. . . . To explain; I prevail'd with Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> to let me have <hi>another Benefit</hi> the laſt Night but one of performing on the Theatre for this laſt Seaſon: I ſay <hi>another</hi> having had about <hi>four</hi> others within the Year.</p>
            <p>The Frequency of my having Benefits demands ſome Conſideration in this Apology, as ſome Perſons have given themſelves Airs to cenſure me for it, and beſides it may bring out ſome theatrical Anecdotes and Rules neceſſary for future and leſs experienc'd Actors. As the having Benefits is ſuppos'd to raiſe a Sum of Money to reward an Actor, and as it is raiſing it in an honeſt Way, what Crime is it if an Actor could get a Benefit-Play every Week? . . . O, but cries Mr. <hi>Oeconomiſt,</hi> who will buy but one Pit-Ticket in a Seaſon? <hi>This is an Impoſition on the Publick, and ſevere Tax on your Tradeſmen, your Acquaintance, and your Acquaintence's Acquaintance?</hi> Ay, it might ſeem ſo indeed, if they were all, as for <hi>myſelf,</hi> but I have more Modeſty to make unreaſonable Requeſts. . . In ſhort, Sir <hi>Wiſacre,</hi> there is an Art to conduct ſuch Things with a Gloſs, and an Art of which I am the original Inventor: I ſhall il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate this by Matters of Fact, as I practis'd them. . . . When I engag'd in that notorious Trial of my Cuckol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I ſtood in Need of the Eſſence of Law, for Money is the Sinews of Law, as well as War; and to raiſe it, the eaſieſt and only Way was by having a Benefit. I ask'd Mr. <hi>F . . . d</hi> this as a Favour, and a good natur'd Office, to enable me to obtain Juſtice for my Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracking Injuries: Though this was at a very good Part of the Seaſon, he, compaſſionating my Neceſſities, comply'd: Now comes the Thing; I thought at that Criſis, having a Benefit in my own Name might be not ſo proper, and without it, you'll ſay, how could you get a full Houſe? . . . . Why, I found out a Way to have a Benefit, and a full Houſe, and Nobody know it: Not to keep you in Suſpence, I got my Father to play for me, and Mr. <hi>F . . . d</hi> to let me have the Houſe, ſo it was done at once. . . . You'll ſay this was very friendly of the Maſter, . . . but that is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over. . . . Two Months after I had a Benefit in my own
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0393400300:132"/>
Name; that was mine by right, and I need ſay no more on it. . . . But about three Months after I wanted another Benefit, which was in the Summer-Seaſon. . . . Then I was engag'd to Mr. <hi>Rich,</hi> and got Leave for the Houſe, and ſome Brother-Actors, to play <hi>gratis. . . .</hi> But I did not tell the Publick it was my Benefit: No, I knew better; I touch'd them in a tender Point, and told them it was to ſupport my dear Infant Children which I had left by my firſt Wife <hi>Jenny . . .</hi> And ſo put at the Top of the Bills, <hi>For the Benefit of Miſs</hi> Betty <hi>and Miſs</hi> Molly, <hi>&amp;c. . . .</hi> Some indeed ſaw through this Artifice, but it paſs'd current enough with the Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. . . . At <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> I was to have had another, but the Weather prevented it: I have had <hi>another</hi> in my Courſe among the Actors, and <hi>another</hi> after them, becauſe I did not get enough by the former. . . . I muſt obſerve, that on theſe Occaſions I always find ſome Topick to diſplay my <hi>Oratory</hi> on, which I print at the Bottom of my Bills, either as Advertiſements or Remonſtrances, or Petitions, or ſomething or other, and circulate them, among the Gentry and Nobility, Tradeſmen, Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Strangers: Beſides which, I generally ſpeak an <hi>Epilogue</hi> of <hi>Jo. Haynes</hi>'s riding on an <hi>Aſs;</hi> and to ſhew how I can laugh at Perſons calling me by Mock-Names, I advertis'd it, <hi>to be ſpoke by the young Captain in his Regimentals, riding on an Aſs. . . .</hi> This may ſeem a trifling Story to the <hi>untheatrical Reader;</hi> but I write this to inſtruct Poſterity, who are engag'd in a Theatre, by what Means they may manage their Affairs; and I hope from theſe Hints ſome future Genius may find much Profit and Emolument.</p>
            <p>The Seaſon being clos'd, I again retir'd to <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> but not to write Politicks, if the Reader has any Curioſity to know what important Affair I went thither for, that I might ſafely negociate it, let him peruſe the Beginning of the ſubſequent Chapter.</p>

But, for my Part, I muſt again ſubmit to return to the Stage a Servant inſtead of a Manager; which had I known ſome Weeks ago, this Apology had not, as yet, have been wrote, nor my Father's would not, as yet, have been publiſh'd: But as I am drawn into this hiſtorical Narration of the Stage, which is, in fact, a true and neceſſary Appendix to his, I will make it as compleat as poſſible; for which Reaſon, I ſhall enter on another Chapter, that I may give the theatrical Characters of the principal Actors now living, not only as it will be in Mr. <hi>Colley Cibber</hi>'s Manner, which I promis'd to follow in my Title Page, but, in fact, as this Apology will not be, <hi>An Hiſtorical View of the</hi>

STAGE <hi>during my</hi> OWN TIME, without them: The drawing Characters is the moſt difficult Province of a Hiſtorian; and very few, either antient or modern, have ſucceeded in them: They who ſneer at <hi>Cibber</hi>'s <hi>Apology</hi> in general, approve of his characterizing his Co-temporaries; they own the Draught is maſterly, and the Colouring entertaining. I am ſenſible therefore how hard the Task muſt be to give the Pourtrait of living Players, when all the Town is acquainted with the Originals: However, as I am of a ſtrong Opinion this Apology, as well as the other, may live to late Poſterity, I am not willing my <hi>Co-temporaries</hi> ſhould be buried in Oblivion; and perhaps there may be no <hi>Apologiſt thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical</hi> hardy enough to ſucceed me: My Friends of the Stage will therefore excuſe my Manner, Partiality, and Expreſſions, and what they may not approve, as being too free, paſs over with a Smile of Contempt; for, to conclude, I ſhall be as free with Mr. <hi>C. Cibber</hi> and <hi>myſelf</hi> as any of them, whoſe Characters I ſhall draw up as Parallels to one another: As I have given you, Reader, the Bill of Fare of the next Chapter, it is in your own Option whether you will ſet down to the Meal.</p>

To draw Characters

            <p>In the Year 1740, the principal Actors, or whom I think the principal Actors, may be thus impartially and conciſely pourtray'd.</p>
            <p>As Tragedians claim, from their coſtly Plumes and Trappings, a Superiority of Merit over the Comedians, I ſhall begin with them; and taking the Liberty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating

            <p>
               <hi>Q—n</hi> at <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> Houſe, and <hi>D-l-ne</hi> at <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> are the <hi>Perſonae Dramatis</hi> which are without Competitors: They both play the chief Characters in the ſame Caſt, therefore I ſhall conſider their different Characters together. <hi>Q—n</hi> has been many Years on the Stage, and has gradually roſe up to that Height of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation he at preſent enjoys: When <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> Theatre was under the Direction of the late Mr. <hi>Rich,</hi> he was in the inferior Claſs; and the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the <hi>Tower</hi> in <hi>Cibber</hi>'s Alteration of <hi>Richard the Third</hi> was one of the principal Parts he perform'd: The Caſt of ſeveral Plays in Print fully prove his Abilities were then thought but very inſignificant; however, on a new Company ſetting up at <hi>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields,</hi> he was engag'd in it, and has ever ſince, but more eſpecially on the Death of <hi>Boheme,</hi> gradually roſe to a great Degree of Favour with the Publick: Mr. <hi>Booth</hi>'s quitting the Stage ſtill ſet him in a fairer Light, and indeed left him without a Rival: He had for ſome Time appear'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Competitor, when, all on a ſudden, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd at <hi>Goodman's-Fields</hi> a young Tragedian from <hi>Dublin:</hi> This was <hi>D. . l. . ne.</hi> Novelty, Youth, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Figure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> took off from any ſevere Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm on his Elocution and Action. In ſhort, though ſo far from the polite End of the Town, he drew to him ſeveral polite Audiences, and became in ſuch a Degree of Repute, that Compariſons were made between him and <hi>Q—n;</hi> nor was he without Admirers of both Sexes who gave him the Preference: He was not inſenſible of this, and determin'd to leave <hi>Goodman's-Fields,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his Ambition at one of the Theatres Royal: <hi>Q. . . n</hi> juſt at that Time left <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> for <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> and he engag'd with Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> at <hi>Covent-Garden;</hi> and in two or three Years on the Stage gain'd that Station on it, which moſt of the other Actors could not in many Years attain to. <hi>Q. . . n</hi> has the Character of a juſt Speaker, but then it is confin'd to the ſolemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamatory Way: He either cannot work himſelf into
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0393400300:146"/>
the Emotions of a violent Paſſion, or he will not take the Fatigue of doing it: The Partiality of his Friends ſays he can touch the Paſſions with great Delicacy <hi>if he will;</hi> but general Opinion affirms he has neither Power of Voice or Senſation to give Love or Pity, Grief or Remorſe their proper Tone and Variation of Features. <hi>D. . l. . ne</hi> is alſo eſteemed a juſt Player; and though he has often a more loud Violence of Voice, yet, either from an Imitation of <hi>Q. . . n,</hi> or his own natural Manner, he has a Sameneſs of Tone and Expreſſion, and drawls out his Lines to a diſpleaſing Length: But that loud Violence of Voice is uſeful to him when Anger, Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or ſuch enrag'd Paſſions are to be expreſs'd; for the ſhrill Loudneſs marks the Paſſion, which the ſweet Cadence of <hi>Q. . . n</hi>'s natural Voice is unequal to. In ſuch Parts, eſpecially <hi>Alexander, D. . l. . ne</hi> pleaſes many; for the Million, as <hi>C. C.</hi> ſays, are apt to be tranſported when the Drum of the Ear is ſoundly rattled: But on the contrary, <hi>Q. . . n</hi>'s ſolemn Sameneſs of Pronunciation, which conveys an awful Dignity, is charmingly affecting in <hi>Caio. D. . l. . ne</hi> is young enough to riſe to greater Perfection; <hi>Q. . . n</hi> may be ſaid now to be at the Height of his: If <hi>D. . l. . ne</hi> has the more pleaſing Perſon, <hi>Q. . . n</hi> has he more affecting Action: Both might ſoon appear with more Advantage if they were on the ſame Stage: The Rivalſhip of <hi>D. . l. . ne</hi> would give a ſpirited Jealouſy to <hi>Q. . . n,</hi> and force him to exert himſelf; and <hi>Q. . . n</hi>'s Judgment would improve the unfiniſh'd Action of <hi>D. . l. . ne;</hi> but they are the <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> of the Theatres, and one Stage would be incompatible with their Ambition; <hi>Q. . . n</hi> could bear no one on the Footing as an Equal, <hi>D. . l. . ne</hi> no one as a Superior.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M . . . lw. . . d</hi> is an Actor with all the Happineſs of Voice that can be imagin'd, and a Perſonage very well turn'd for the Lover or the Heroe; nor, when he is not indolently negligent, does he often betray a Want of Judgment: His Voice is ſweet, with an uncommon Strength; and in the Decadence of it, there is a Softneſs which adapts it to touch the Paſſions of Grief, Love, Pity, or Deſpair. In Comedy the Eaſineſs of his Dialogue in the genteel Characters ſeems very amiable; and though in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0393400300:147"/>
his Action and Speech he does not imitate that quick ſnip-ſnap Catch of the late Mr. <hi>Wilks,</hi> to expreſs Spirit and Vigour; yet his Voice and Geſture ſhow ſuch a Vivacity as are the juſt Effects of Nature: In low Comedy he has been ſeen to ſucceed beyond Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to ſpeak all in a Word, according to Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi>'s Deſcription of <hi>Mountford,</hi> he is, or might be, the true Repreſentative of him.</p>
            <p>Of Mr. <hi>William M . . . ls</hi> I have ſaid ſomething in a preceding Chapter; all I ſhall add here is, that he is not excellent in Tragedy, the Inanity of his Voice being unequal to the Swellings and Throws of the Sublime: In Comedy he ſucceded to Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi>'s Parts; has caught ſomething of his Catch in the Voice; is always very buſy on the Stage; and, what all Actors ought to value themſelves upon, very perfect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Griffin</hi> and <hi>Joe Miller</hi> being dead, I ſhall give no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of them, nor of thoſe who have ſucceded to their Parts; for if I ſhould ſpeak of their Excellencies, I ſhould be tempted to mention the comparative Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their Succeſſors.—Like the great <hi>Apologiſt</hi>'s Method of treating <hi>Verbruggen, Keen, Boheme, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> I ſhall paſs over the Reſt of the preſent Players as Princes of pett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mrs. <hi>Cl. . . e</hi> is eſteem'd by all an excellent Comic Actreſs; and as ſhe has a prodigious Fund of natural Spirit and Humour off the Stage, ſhe makes the moſt of the Poet's on it.

She has been, by Perſons who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member both, compared to Mrs. <hi>Mountſord;</hi> and, by their natural Talents for the Stage, I am apt to believe the Compariſon not unjuſt: I muſt however obſerve, Mrs. <hi>Mountford</hi> appear'd with great Succeſs, <hi>en Cavalier,</hi> and made an adroit pretty Fellow: Mrs. <hi>Cl. . . e</hi> does not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0393400300:148"/>
appear in theſe Characters, the concealing Petticoat better ſuiting with her Turn of Make than the Breeches: It is not from want of Spirit or Judgment to hit off the Fop or the Coxcomb, as ſhe has evidently prov'd in the Ballad ſhe Sings, call'd the <hi>Life of a Beau,</hi> in which her Action and Geſture is as pleaſing as in any Part ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms: I could wiſh ſhe would never attempt ſerious Characters in Comedy; and to reſign the Part of <hi>Ophelia</hi> in <hi>Hamlet,</hi> in which ſhe is very unequal to herſelf:—Yet all will allow, that <hi>take her all in all,</hi> ſhe has ſuch Talents as make her an excellent Actreſs.</p>
            <p>Though Mrs. <hi>Cl. . . e</hi> is by far the moſt excellent Actreſs of the <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> Company, and to ſpeak out the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Judgment of experienc'd Criticks, the only Actreſs who has any <hi>Excellence</hi> in it, yet ſhe has a Competitor in Fame at <hi>Covent-Garden:</hi> Mrs. <hi>H. . . t. . . n</hi> ſtands in the ſame Degree of Superiority on this latter Stage, as Mrs. <hi>Cl. . . e</hi> does on the former; but I muſt obſerve, that their Talents, Manner, Air, Geſture, and Caſt of Parts are very different.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>H. . . t. . . n,</hi> though paſt the <hi>heyday</hi> of her <hi>Beauty,</hi> yet betrays ſo little decay of Youth, that an <hi>inexpreſſible Somewhat</hi> in her Air, Face, and Mein throws out ſuch a Glow of Health and Chearfulneſs, that, on the Stage, few Spectators that are not paſt it, can behold her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Deſire;</hi> and, in the Fullneſs of my Heart I may venture to confeſs, that the <hi>Deſirable</hi> is ſo predominant in her that my Soul has a <hi>Taſte</hi> or <hi>Tendre</hi> for Mrs. <hi>H. . . t. . . n.</hi> To ſpeak critically of her as an Actreſs, in all Parts of a gay Impertinent, or the <hi>Coquette,</hi> ſhe has all the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Foppery that a giddy, lively, fantaſtick Creature can be affected with.—The Language, Dreſs, Motion, and Manners of a <hi>Millamant</hi> ſeem naturally her own; and I may ſay of her, what the great <hi>Apologiſt</hi> ſaid of Mrs. <hi>Bracegirdle</hi> in that Part; that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<note n="*" place="bottom">

Beauty."</q>—But beſides theſe Foibles of the Fair Sex, ſhe can riſe into the decent Dignity of a fine Lady, and charm with the innocent Reſerve of an <hi>Indiana,</hi> as by the fluttering <hi>Je ne ſcai quoy</hi> of a <hi>Millamant.</hi> In Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, ſince the Death of Mrs. <hi>Hallam,</hi> ſhe ſtands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any equal Competitor; for ſhe has that Grace in her Preſence, that clear Melody in her Voice, with Strength enough to expreſs the Violence of ſome Paſſions, and Softneſs to ſubſide into the Harmony of others, that no Actreſs now performing on either Stage can, in this Light, be compared to her.—There are ſome indeed, at both Houſes, who <hi>throw out ſome Proffers of a Genius,</hi> yet cannot be rank'd in any Degree of <hi>Perfection;</hi> for either they heavily drag the Sentiment along, with a long-ton'd Voice, abſent Eye, and Inanity of Geſture, or elſe with an impetuous Velocity of Voice, ſtaring Eye, and unmeaning Superfluity of Action, <hi>make the Performance come out odly diſguis'd, or ſomewhere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively unſurpriſing to the Hearer.—</hi>As I mention no particular Perſons, no particular Perſons can take Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: In Juſtice to my own Judgement I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that I unwillingly acquieſce in the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Judges, that the <hi>two Theatres</hi> never had, at any Time, ſo indifferent a Set of <hi>Actreſſes</hi> as at preſent; and among the younger Actreſſes I have not ſeen one who has ſhewn the leaſt Genius for the Stage, which may ever make its Way towards Perfection. It may ſeem a Matter of Wonder to ſome, why they who have been excellent in a Theatre, as <hi>Cibber, Wilks,</hi> and <hi>Booth,</hi> did not bring up young Actors to ſucceed them; and this was indeed objected to their Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"<note n="*" place="bottom">

one and the other the ſame, though their publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct was extremely different.—COLLEY had rather <hi>be</hi> immoral than be eſteem'd ſo; THE' thought it more Glory, the more he acquir'd the Character of being ſo.—The Reputation of the one was only founded on private Rumour, but that of the other is on publick Record.

            <p>Having brought the Hiſtory of the Stage down from the Time my Father left it to the preſent Vacation, 1740, I can only add, after my Exploits, Hopes, and Ambition, I muſt return to Mr. <hi>Rich,</hi> as an hired Actor, and wait in dudgeon ſome more favourable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make my Attempts on the theatric Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions more ſucceſsful: However thoſe Attempts occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd this Apology, which will tranſmit my Name and Character to late Poſterity; and I may conclude as <hi>Ovid</hi> does:</p>
