            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

None of this Money ſhall be carried out of the Kingdom, but laid out for Shipping, which is the Defence of it, and beſtow'd upon our own Men, who muſt be fed and maintain'd, tho' they ſtay at Home. For this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1214000900:13"/>
we ſhall reap the Fruit of whatſoever <hi>Benefit, Plantation, Traffick,</hi> or <hi>Purchaſe</hi> can procure us, beſides <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Security.</hi>'</p>
                           <p>'Now, let us a little conſider the Enemy we are to encounter, the King of  <note n="*" place="margin">Whatever was then ſaid of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> may, in the main, be now appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>French</hi> King.</note> 
                              <hi>Spain.</hi> They are not his great Territories which make him ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſo troubleſome to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom.

As for his other Territories, they lye divided and aſunder which is a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it ſelf. Beſides, they are held by Force, and maintain'd at an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Charge. Inſomuch, as altho' he be a great King, yet he is like that Gyant, who was ſaid to have a Hundred Hands, but he had 50 Bellies to feed, ſo that ratably, he had no more Hands than another Man.'</p>
                           <p>'No, Sir, they are his MINES in the WEST-INDIES, which Miniſter Fuell to feed his vaſt <hi>ambitious Deſire</hi> of UNIVERSAL MONARCHY: It is the Money he hath from thence, which makes him able to levy, and pay Soldiers in all Places; and to keep an Army continually on foot, ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade and indanger his Neighbours.'</p>
                           <p>'So that we have no other way, but

And this our Undertaking (if it pleaſe God to bleſs it) muſt needs effect it ſooner, and quicker; the whole Body of the Kingdom being United and concurring in a <hi>perpetual Supply</hi> to this Action; ſo that he will have no free Time given him to reſt.'</p>
                           <p>'Moreover, this will be a Means not only to ſave, but to fill his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Coffers, enabling the People to give him liberally, and often; the King's Ships will have little to do but to guard the Coaſts, for the Sea-War will chiefly be made at the Charge of the Subject. Thus (Sir <hi>Dudley Digs</hi>) I doubt not but that, in a ſhort Time, both King and People ſhall be ſafe at Home, and fear'd Abroad.

Tho' the Undertaking be Noble, Great, and Advantageous, yet ſuch is the Perverſneſs of Humane Nature; ſo prone are the Generality of Men to Cenſure, and find Fault, that 'tis no Wonder this Publick-Spirited Deſign has met with Contradiction and Oppoſition; either from a Jealouſie and Uneaſineſs of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, almoſt inſeparable from Money'd-Men, or from the Particular Diſguſts of ſome Perſons, who, like Waſpiſh and Sullen Patients, reject the moſt Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Phyſick, becauſe they are not pleas'd with the Hand that adminiſters it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Firſt Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>In the firſt Place, it is objected, That, conſidering what ſtrong Footing the <hi>French</hi> have got in the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies,</hi> the Attempt to remove them from thence is like to be attended with inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Difficulties; the rather, becauſe they are in Conjunction with the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> both at Land and Sea: And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing we could get ſome Settlement in the Continent of <hi>South-America,</hi> yet while the War laſts, we could Trade with no more of the Country than we poſſeſs, unleſs it be clandeſtinely; and after the Peace we muſt expect to have leſs Trade; whereas the <hi>French</hi> have an open unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Commerce with the whole Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1214000900:28"/>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer to the Firſt Branch of it.</note>As to the firſt Branch of this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I anſwer, That the Neceſſity of dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>French</hi> out of the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies</hi> being once laid down as a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Maxim, no Difficulties whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ought to deterr us from the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; whereas, on the contrary, the infinite Advantage and Benefit that will attend the Succeſs of the Attempt, ought to be a powerful Incentive to it. We have, in the Courſe of this War, with our Shipping, and a Handful of Land-Men, compaſs'd Things of far greater Difficulty; ſuch as the Taking of <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona, Gibraltar,</hi> and <hi>Port-Mahon:</hi> And to bring in a freſher Inſtance, did not Colonel <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> with inconſiderable Forces, make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> in <hi>Nova Scotia</hi>; which, we may well ſuppoſe, was in a better Poſture of Defence than ſeveral Places in <hi>South-America,</hi> in which the <hi>French</hi> are but newly ſettled.</p>
            <p>Beſides, can any Man of common Senſe entertain ſo mean an Opinion of thoſe who made this Project, and have thereby juſtly merited publick Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments and Rewards, as to think that they did not foreſee, and provide againſt all Difficulties that might attend it? There's no Doubt to be made, but the Miniſtry have had all the Lights and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1214000900:29"/>
Informations neceſſary to carry on ſo great an Undertaking with Probability of Succeſs: But the <hi>Scheme</hi> they have framed, with the Aſſiſtance of ſeveral Perſons, who are perfectly well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thoſe Countries, is, and ought to remain an abſolute Secret, till all Things be ready for Execution; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Enemy might take ſuch Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Precautions as might render the Deſign abortive.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer to the ſecond Branch of the Firſt Objection.</note>To the Second Part of the Firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection I anſwer, That by a Trade to the <hi>South-Seas,</hi> it is not to be underſtood, that we ſhall take Poſſeſſion of ſome Ports or Places on the Weſt-ſide of <hi>South-America,</hi> which being to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd as our Acquiſitions, purſuant to the Treaty of the Grand-Alliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mention'd, We ſhall poſſeſs the ſame after the Peace is made; and that, from theſe Places, we ſhall carry on a Free Trade with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Natives of <hi>America,</hi> throughout the reſt of their Plantations, as the <hi>French</hi> do now. To be ſure, to expect ſuch a <hi>Free Trade</hi> would be a fond Conceit: For, as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the War, the <hi>French,</hi> in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> will certainly endeavour to prevent it; ſo, after the Peace, <hi>Old-Spain</hi> will not eaſily conſent to it. The ſame Reaſons that induc'd
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1214000900:30"/>
them, notwithſtanding their inbred An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy to the <hi>French,</hi> rather to call the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> to the Throne, than to ſuffer a Partition of their Monarchy, will, undoubtedly, incline them not to acquieſce in a <hi>Partition of their Direct American</hi> Trade, which, as was hinted before, is the main ſpring of their Riches, and would, in Effect, be the ſame with a <hi>Partition of their Dominions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Trade intended to be carried on by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Corporation to the <hi>South-Seas,</hi> will be ſo far from being Prejudicial to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that as we may, with God's Bleſſing, during the War, deliver them from the intruding <hi>French,</hi> of whom (as I hinted before) they wiſh themſelves to be rid: So, in Time of Peace, our Settlements in the <hi>South-Seas</hi> will rather be an Advantage than a Detriment to <hi>Old-Spain.</hi> This Poſition may, at firſt Bluſh, look like a Paradox: But as 'tis moſt certain, That there's room enough on the Weſtern-Coaſt of <hi>South-America</hi> for us to plant and eſtabliſh a flouriſhing Trade in, without invading the Property, or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Original Commerce of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>; ſo, on the other Hand, we may aſſiſt them in carrying on the ſaid Trade, by ſupplying them with what they ſtand moſt in need of, for that Purpoſe,

               <hi>viz. Negroes</hi>; which we may eaſily do, with no finall Advantage to our ſelves; as was before mentioned. By this it appears, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have no Reaſon to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4+ letters">

            <p>And here we may curſorily take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, That beſides the Conceſſions made to us by the Treaty of the Grand Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, of ſuch Places as we ſhall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>

               <note place="margin">4th Objection.</note>But the loudeſt, moſt popular, and, indeed, moſt plauſible Clamour againſt this Undertaking, is the <hi>Cumpulſion</hi> put upon the Proprietors of Publick Debts to ſubſcribe thier Tallies, Debentures, Bills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into this New Company: As if the whole Debt was to be the Stock in Trade; and this Stock was to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd towards the Diſlodging the <hi>French</hi> out of the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Firſt Part of it anſwer'd.</note>As to the Firſt Part of this Objection, I anſwer, That, between Man and Man, to force a free Debtor to take an Intereſt for his Debt, and not receive the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal according to Contract, is certainly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard and unjuſt: But the Caſe is vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different between a Private Man and a Nation; for the firſt may fail, and prove inſolvent; the latter never can. It is too viſible that the Publick Debts, were too Great to be paid off in any Number of Years, while the Burden of an expenſive War lies heavy upon the Nation; and therefore, all that an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Parliament</hi> and <hi>Wiſe Miniſtry</hi> could do, was to ſecure thoſe Debts, by aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them, and putting them into one <hi>Lump,</hi> and by allowing an Intereſt of Six <hi>per Cent</hi>; that is, as large an Intereſt as was ever allow'd by Parliament, (except upon extraordinary Emergencies) and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1214000900:34"/>
One <hi>per Cent.</hi> more than ſome of thoſe Debts, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Army and Tranſport-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentures,</hi> had before. So far the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> of the Nation are clear and unblemiſh'd.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, the Parliament and Miniſtry, upon a Contemplation of the abſolute Neceſſity of Removing the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>South-America,</hi> in Order to attain a Safe, Honourable, and Laſting Peace; and of the other great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages (before-mention'd) that will reſult from a <hi>South-Sea Trade,</hi> reſolv'd to erect a Company for that Purpoſe; and thereupon <hi>incorporated</hi> the Proprietors of the Publick Debts, who, by reaſon of their large Stock, are, certainly, the moſt able to carry on this Undertaking with Probability of Succeſs. Now, if ever <hi>Compulſion</hi> can be juſtify'd, (and no Government can ſubſiſt without it) it is certainly in a Caſe not only of Neceſſity, but Viſible Benefit. The Forcing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Proprietors of Publick Debts, that is, a Multitude of Perſons of different Humours, Intereſts, and Views, to agree and meet in one Common Center, <hi>viz.</hi> the Publick Good, and their own Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Advantage, is certainly a very happy and commendable Violence. Not but that ſuch a Compulſion may occaſion Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences to ſeveral particular Perſons:

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer'd.</note>To this I anſwer, Firſt, That the Company ſhall be at no further Charge, than ſhall be thought neceſſary for their own Benefit and Advantage.</p>

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1214000900:36"/>Secondly, That their Capital-Stock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near Ten Millions Sterling, a Call of Five Pound upon very Hundred Pound will raiſe near 500000<hi>l.</hi> a Sum much greater than the Capital Joint-Stock with which the <hi>French</hi> King, his Grand-Son, and the Subjects of the Two reſpective Crowns, undertook and have Settled the Trade to the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> and which was only of Six Millions of <hi>French</hi> Livers, that is about 400000<hi>l.</hi> Sterling.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That, according to Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Charter, all the ſeveral Calls towards the <hi>South-Sea Trade</hi> are not to exceed Ten Pound upon every Hundred Pound.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, And in the laſt Place, That the Company being under the Conduct and Management of a Governor and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors, who ſhall have the largeſt Share in the Adventure, and conſequently be moſt concern'd in the Proſperity of the Whole; there's no Doubt to be made that, if after ſuch Tryals as are Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be made in all great and difficult Undertakings, they find that the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Trade will turn to no Account, they will fairly throw it up; and ſit down contented with an Intereſt of Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> for their Capital-Stock, till

the Parliament is in a Condition, and thinks fit to redeem it: For the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is only <hi>empower'd,</hi> and <hi>not compell'd</hi> to trade, excluſive of all others, to the South-Seas; which is ſo far from being a Hardſhip, that it really is, as it was meant, a diſtinguiſhing Favour.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Falſe Report about the Subſcription.</note>And here we may take Notice of a falſe Report, broach'd either through Miſtake, or a Siniſter Deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Fourth Part of the Subſcription into this Company was to be made in ready Money; which, being inſerted in one of the Publick Foreign Prints of the beſt Credit, has undoubtedly hindred ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Foreigners, who are Proprietors of Army-Debentures, or other Publick Debts, from Subſcribing.</p>

               <note place="margin">Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties Four Millions were ſubſcrib'd in Three Weeks</note>But notwithſtanding theſe falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and Surmizes; notwithſtanding the malicious Endeavours, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Suggeſtions of ſome <hi>diſguſted,</hi> on <hi>ill-deſigning Perſons</hi>; notwithſtanding all the great Trouble that has, unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably, attended the Subſcription; ſuch as the Examining the Title, and caſting up the broken Sums of every particular Bill, and Debenture, and other Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, yet 'tis very remarkable, That in the few Days the Books were open, which did not exceed Three Weeks, near Four Millions were Subſcrib'd.

               <note place="margin">Two Millions more ready to be ſubſcrib'd.</note>To this if we add above Two Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are to be Subſcrib'd for the Uſe of the Publick; but which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done till the Accounts of the ſeveral Offices are made up, it may be computed, that above Six Millions are as good as Subſcrib'd; and the greateſt Part of the Three Millions and a Half remaining would have alſo come in, had it not been for the Uncertainty of the Time, when the <hi>Transferr-Books</hi> will be open'd, which cannot be before the <hi>CHARTER</hi> of this Corporation has paſs'd the <hi>Seals</hi>; and the Remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from <hi>Great Britain</hi> of ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of the <hi>Publick Debts,</hi> who could not have Time to ſend Orders to their Correſpondents, while the Subſcription-Books were open'd: <note place="margin">This great Undertaking brought ſo near Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, one of the Wonders of this glorious Reign.</note>So that, the Bringing ſo great an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking ſo near Perfection, in ſo ſhort a Time, may well be reckon'd among the Wonders of Her Majeſty's glorious Reign.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Some Doubts that have ariſen, about ſome Clauſes in the Act of Parliament, for the erecting the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Corporation, have fill'd the Minds of ſome of the Proprietors of the Publick Debts with ill-grounded jealouſies; which may alſo have put ſome ſtop to the <hi>Subſcription.</hi> But, as
