            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT will be eaſily perceiv'd, why no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, by way of <hi>Dedication,</hi> cou'd be proper to this Poem: Yet, the Verſes ought perhaps to have been offer'd, before print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the View of One Great Family (leſt, among Ideas, of ſo complicated a Variety, there ſhou'd be ſome, wherewith it might not, as to Point of Delicacy, have been found eligible to aſſociate Names, of ſuch ſincere Diſtinction and Importance). But the Writer recollected, that the mere Omiſſion of an Act of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony cou'd not, equitably, be complain'd of, in a Poem where he has not arrogated, <hi>to Himſelf,</hi> the Freedom to give PRAISE, or CENSURE: All, that points at either One or Other, being narrative Recital only; and That, too, from the Voices of ſuch Speakers, as the Public daily <hi>hears,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0670002500:3"/>
more, upon both Subjects, than they are repreſented in this Place, as uttering.</p>
            <p>As to the general Diſpoſition of the Purpoſe, if Any too bold Strokes of Liberty ſhou'd chance to be ſuſpected in it, let it be remember'd in the Writer's Favour, that he is no better than an empty <hi>Viſionary!</hi> And This is not the firſt Time, that a Man, in a Dream, has been a very <hi>impertinent Fellow,</hi> who, in his waking Intervals, has kept within the Bounds of due <hi>Decorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning LUXURY eſpecially, none ought to make the Muſe accountable for what ſhe prattles in her <hi>Sleep:</hi> Since 'tis about a Power ſhe never correſponds with, <hi>but in Slumber.</hi> And, if TRADE is touchy, and won't bear to have it credited, that <hi>Daughters</hi> come by means of <hi>Mothers,—</hi>who could ſhun the Hazard of offending ſuch a choleric Petulance?—The Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had no Licence to reſtrain, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, Sentiments he but <hi>reports,</hi> from Perſonages, to whome his Country owes a Reverence that forbids the Boldneſs of curtailing their Ideas.—Neither has he given the captious <hi>Coquette</hi> above-nam'd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0670002500:4"/>
the leaſt Occaſion of Offence, without Hard-ſtraining and Partiality; for, Who can look upon it as an Undervaluing of <hi>Trade,</hi> that ſhe is repreſented as not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much diſpos'd to <hi>carry Arms</hi> Herſelf; nor over-fond, indeed, of Thoſe <hi>ſhe pays for carrying them?—</hi>Authorities enough might probably be found, to prove plain Truth no Slander. But he rather pleads the Merit of that propheſied <hi>Expedient,</hi> toward the End of the Vth Canto, for a perfect Reconciliation between the Drum, and Warehouſe.—If, notwithſtanding This, the waking Poet muſt be charg'd with the Vagaries of his dreaming Muſe, He can but borrow Comfort from this tit-for-tat Reflection:—That, ſince Trade is naturally diſpos'd to think, with Dulneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, of <hi>Poetry,</hi> the Poet in his Turn, may, by Right of Equivalent, aſſume the ſame dull Privilege; and prate, as fooliſhly, of <hi>Traffick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To paſs, at once, from Poetry,—to Proſe, and Truth, and ſerious <hi>Hiſtory:—</hi>The great, and nobly-judging, Lady, to whome, in the VIth Canto, an Advice of no ſmall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0670002500:5"/>
is offer'd, by a bold, tho' <hi>naked,</hi> Friend, (of whome ſhe never yet was known to be aſham'd, however bare, and out of Faſhion, ſhe approach'd her) will reflect, with ſome Attention, on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; after hearing what <hi>Foundation</hi> It was grounded on.</p>
            <p>About the Year 1735, a private Perſon, not worth <hi>naming,</hi> but an ardent Lover of his Country's Reputation, became dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd of a miſtaken Notion, (which had been at firſt imbib'd by Converſation with the <hi>Prejudic'd,</hi> but gradually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd and heighten'd, by much Reading, Speculation, and Reflection, upon military Subjects) that the moſt celebrated <hi>Engliſh Conqueror,</hi> of this laſt Age, (It might, I think, be added, without Flattery, above Any, of the Former) was not <hi>pre-medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively,</hi> and by Force of his ſuperior Skill, the Author of his own unprecedented Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories.—The Miſtaker grounded his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion on that Great General's <hi>Letters,</hi> written from the Fields of Battle, with the firſt Accounts of his Succeſſes.—It is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beyond Diſpute, that, <hi>there,</hi> one meets
<pb facs="tcp:0670002500:6"/>
with none of thoſe <hi>deſcriptive</hi> and <hi>expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory</hi> Circumſtances, whereby the skilful Captains, of all Ages, took ſuch cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Care to guard againſt unjuſt Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their Conduct; by unfolding it, in Plan, in Progreſs, and Accompliſhment: that, not their <hi>Fortune</hi> only, but their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and Superiority of Genius, might be noted, in their Victories. It is hence, that in ſo many of the Antient's, and in ſome great <hi>Modern's,</hi> written Narratives, we <hi>ſee,</hi> and underſtand, minutely, the whole Ground-plots, Diſpoſitions, Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and clear <hi>Out-break,</hi> of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Not in their bald <hi>Succeſs</hi> alone; but with their previous Motives, their impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Agitations, and eventual Over-balance, and Concluſion: Whereas, from all the publiſh'd Letters of our more than equal Executer of his own unequall'd Purpoſes, we gather nothing further, than that the Army He commanded was triumphant; and that He ſeems to think each Leader, in it, more deſerving his Remark, than the Elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidation of his own Deſigns, in their reported Execution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0670002500:7"/>
In a Viſit made, about the Time juſt mention'd, to another <hi>Engliſh</hi> General, a Noble Lord, ſince dead, at a ſmall Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Seat of his, near <hi>London,</hi> Theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations were inlarg'd upon, (as they had often been to others) in a Converſation on the military Character of our great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of Fortune: whome, it has been thought, the Lord here meant had, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, regarded with ſome Rival Pangs of Emulation. It were therefore an ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Coldneſs to his Memory, to conceal the noble Sentiments wherewith he clos'd the Converſation on this Subject!—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"You have (ſaid he) miſunderſtood His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and done it the ſame <hi>Wrong,</hi> that many Thouſands do, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to do, from but the natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his ſincere and modeſt <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence of Oſtentation.—</hi>He thought it, equally, His Duty to ſubdue the Enemy, and His own Senſibility of <hi>Triumph for ſubduing him.—</hi>He made, I think, but <hi>one</hi> Miſtake in his Field Conduct: But <hi>That</hi> was a Miſtake of ſuch unlucky Conſequence, that It has been able to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0670002500:8"/>
do more, <hi>againſt Himſelf,</hi> than Ten <hi>French Armies</hi> cou'd: for It obſcures (you ſee) the Luſtre of his Genius.—He truſted <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> for Explanations, which, He ſhou'd have known, It cou'd not make (but in a lame and ſuperficial manner) for want of Lights, which He alone had Power to furniſh, who was the only Perſon dis-inclinable to <hi>wiſh</hi> 'em furniſh'd."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Impreſſion which this truly noble Anſwer made, and the Reflections which It gave Occaſion to, have often, <hi>ſince,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to Imagination as a <hi>National</hi> Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, the Poſſibility of ſome deſtructive Accident, to thoſe invaluable Original Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which contain ('tis ſaid) ſufficient Matter, in His Family's Poſſeſſion, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalize, as well That Great Man's <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Wiſdom, Suavity, Skill,</hi> MODES, and MEANS, of Conqueſt, as the Reputation merely, of the Victories themſelves.—The <hi>Laſt,</hi> it muſt be own'd, is <hi>Glory:</hi> But it is a Glory of a barren and unpropagative Species: 'Tis the Glory of a <hi>Nimrod,</hi> a <hi>Seſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, Hercules, Arthur,</hi> and <hi>Pendragon:</hi> Names, of aweful Cloudineſsl but uneffectual
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0670002500:9"/>
Admiration!—becauſe heard of, more than <hi>ſhown:—</hi>Not Lights, of Living <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> by whoſe Help, the <hi>Caeſars</hi> and the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> are not only, in Themſelves, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; but by their Force of Emulative In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, have been, are, and will continue to the End of Time, the military <hi>Fathers,</hi> of new Sons of Glory, in all Nations, and throughout all Ages.</p>
            <p>Who, therefore, cou'd too much lament an Accident of ſuch ſevere Importance, ſhou'd it happen to the mention'd Papers, before That glorious <hi>Uſe</hi> has been drawn from them, which is hinted in the Cloſe of the laſt Canto? Where that the Writer may not ſeem impertinent, he has, here, aſſign'd his <hi>Reaſons,</hi> for conceiving it both a Domeſtic, and a Public Duty, on the Care of That illuſtrious Conqueror's <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives.—</hi>But where the Hand is to be found, in all Points, equal to an Undertaking of ſuch arduous Difficulty, is a Wiſh, that may be added to the Liſt of thoſe <hi>Deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata,</hi> rather hinted at, than hop'd for, by the boldeſt Enterprizers, in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Learning!</p>
