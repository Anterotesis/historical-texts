      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Editor's chief intention in making the following Collection was to bring into one point of view the beſt pieces which have appeared ſince the concluſion of Dodſley's collection; and he will venture to affirm, that whatever be the merit of that entertaining miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, this does not fall ſhort any ways of it, as ſome of the volumes in that are made up from the publications of a few years; whereas this contains whatever has been moſt applauded in a courſe of twenty. But he has not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined himſelf to that period only, but inſerted many pieces, in his opinion, of great merit, which the inattention of the public, or the obſcurity of the publication, had long ſuffered to remain unnoticed. To theſe are added many originals by writers of acknowledged merit; among which thoſe of Mr. Mendez, author of the Chaplet, and ſeveral admired poems in Dodſley's Miſcellany, make no mean figure. Mr. Mendez was reckoned among the moſt agreeable poets of his time, and, perhaps, he was the only one that was ever worth one hundred thouſand pounds.</p>

               <l>With ſtately ſteps approaching to the deep,</l>
               <l>The hardy hero ſwims the liquid tide;</l>
               <l>With joy he finds the dragon faſt aſleep,</l>

               <l>Though hard the taſk, like lightning faſt he flew,</l>

               <l>Then to the tree with manly ſteps he drew,</l>

               <l>He tears it up, and bears it in his hand.</l>

               <l>But long, alas! ere he could reach the ſhore,</l>
               <l>Or fix his footſteps on the ſolid ſand,</l>
               <l>The monſter follow'd with a hideous roar,</l>
               <l>And like a fury graſp'd him by the hand.</l>
               <l>Then, gracious God! what dreadful ſtruggling roſe!</l>
               <l>He graſps the dragon by th' invenom'd jaws,</l>

He groans through anguiſh of the grievous wound,</l>
               <l>And cries for help; but, ah! no help was found?</l>

            <lg>
               <l>At length the maid, now wond'ring at his ſtay,</l>

               <l>Alas! too late; yet gath'ring all his force,</l>
               <l>He drags, at laſt, his hiſſing foe to land.</l>
               <l>Yet there the battle ſtill grew worſe and worſe,</l>
               <l>And long the conflict laſted on the ſtrand.</l>
               <l>At length he happily deſcry'd a part,</l>
               <l>Juſt where the ſcaly neck and breaſt did meet;</l>
               <l>Through this he drove a well-directed dart,</l>

               <l>His tints to blend, to guide his hand.</l>
               <l>Each heightening ſtroke, each happy line,</l>

               <l>His pencil with his life, was loſt:</l>

            <lg>
               <l>FOR once, ye critics, let the ſportive Muſe</l>
               <l>Her fool's cap wear, ſpite of the ſhaking head</l>
               <l>Of ſtern-eyed Gravity—for, tho' the Muſe</l>

Immoral; nor one picture will ſhe hold,</l>
               <l>But Virtue may approve it with a ſmile.</l>
               <l>Ye ſylvan deities! awhile adieu!</l>
               <l>Ye curling ſtreams! whoſe banks are fring'd with flowers,</l>
               <l>Violet and hare-bell, or the king-cup bright,</l>
               <l>Farewell! for I muſt leave your rich perfumes</l>
               <l>To ſing the Pin in ever ſounding lays:</l>
               <l>But not that Pin, at whoſe circumference</l>
               <l>Rotund, the ſtrong-nerv'd ruſtic hurls the bowl</l>
               <l>Ponderous and vaſt: nor that which window bars</l>
               <l>From thief nocturnal: nor that other call'd</l>
               <l>A ſkittle; chiefly found where alehouſe ſnug</l>
               <l>Invites mechanic to the flowing cup</l>
               <l>Of Calvert's mild, o'er-canopied with froth.</l>
               <l>No—'tis the Pin ſo much by ladies us'd;</l>
               <l>Without whoſe aid the nymph of niceſt taſte,</l>
               <l>Of neateſt mould, a ſlattern would appear.</l>
               <l>Hail then, thou little uſeful inſtrument!</l>
               <l>Tho' ſmall, yet conſequential. For by thee</l>
               <l>Beauty ſets off her charms, as at the glaſs</l>
               <l>Lucy, or Phillis, beſt adapts thy point.</l>
               <l>Without thy ſervice would the ribband flaunt</l>
               <l>Looſe to the fanning gale, nor on the head</l>
               <l>Of belle would ſtand her whimſical attire.</l>
               <l>The kerchief from her neck of ſnow would fall</l>
               <l>With freedom bold, and leave her boſom bare.</l>
               <l>How would the ſempſtreſs trim thy want regret</l>
               <l>As ſhe her apron forms! And how the man</l>

               <l>On noſe reverted! frequent does he want</l>

Thy prompt aſſiſtance, to connect his ſcraps</l>

               <l>The miſer picks, as conſcious of thy uſe;</l>
               <l>With frugal hand, accompanied with brow</l>
               <l>Of corrugated bent, he ſticks thee ſafe,</l>
               <l>Interior on his coat; then creeps along,</l>
               <l>Well judging thy proportion to a groat.</l>
               <l>Thro' all thy different ſtorehouſes to trace</l>
               <l>Thy preſence, either in the ſculptur'd dome,</l>
               <l>Or tenement clay-built, would aſk a pen</l>
               <l>With points almoſt as various as thy heads.</l>
               <l>Where-e'er thou art, or in whatever form,</l>

            <head>PARODY ON THE CITY AND COUNTRY MOUSE.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>A Country vicar in his homely houſe,</l>
               <l>Pleas'd with his lot, and happy in his ſpouſe,</l>
               <l>With ſimple diet, at his humble board,</l>
               <l>Once entertain'd the chaplain of a lord;—</l>
               <l>He gave him (all he could) a little fiſh,</l>
               <l>With ſauce of oyſters, in no ſilver diſh;</l>
               <l>And, for the craving ſtomach's ſure relief,</l>
               <l>The glory of Old England, rare Roaſt-beef,</l>
               <l>Horſe-radiſh and potatoes, Ireland's pride;</l>
               <l>A pudding too the prudent dame ſupply'd:</l>
               <l>Their cheering beverage was a pint of port</l>
               <l>(Tho' ſmall the quantum) of the better ſort;</l>
               <l>But plenty of good beer, both ſmall and ſtout,</l>
               <l>With wine of elder to prevent the gout.</l>
               <l>The vicar hop'd, by ſuch a various treat,</l>
               <l>To tempt his ſcarf-embelliſh'd friend to eat;</l>
               <l>With niceſt bits provok'd his gueſt to dine,</l>
               <l>He carv'd the haddock, and he ſerv'd the wine:</l>
               <l>Content his own ſharp ſtomach to regale</l>
               <l>With plain, ſubſtantial roaſt-meat and mild ale.</l>
               <l>Our courtly chaplain, as we may ſuppoſe,</l>
               <l>At ſuch old-faſhion'd commons curl'd his noſe;</l>

                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0388401200:182"/>
He tried in vain to piddle, and, in brief,</l>
               <l>Piſh'd at the pudding, and declin'd the beef;</l>
               <l>At length, their homely dinner finiſh'd quite,</l>
               <l>Thus to the vicar ſpoke the prieſt polite:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>' How can my brother in this paltry town</l>
               <l>' Live undiſtinguiſh'd, to the world unknown?</l>
               <l>' And not exalt your towering genius higher,</l>
               <l>' Than here to herd with country clown—or ſquire;</l>
               <l>' Stunn'd with the diſcord of hoarſe cawing rooks,</l>
               <l>' The roar of winds, the diſſonance of brooks,</l>
               <l>' Which diſcontented thro' the valley ſtray,</l>
               <l>' Plaintive and murmuring at their long delay.</l>
               <l>' Come, come with me, nor longer here abide;</l>
               <l>' You've friends in town, and I will be your guide:</l>
               <l>' Soon great preferment to your ſhare will fall,</l>
               <l>' A good fat living, or perhaps—a ſtall.'</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Theſe weighty reaſons ſway'd the vicar's mind—</l>
               <l>To town he hied, but left his wife behind:—</l>
               <l>Next levee day he waited on his Grace,</l>
               <l>With hundreds more, who bow'd to get a place;</l>
               <l>Shov'd in the croud, he ſtood amaz'd to ſee</l>
               <l>Lords who to Baal bent the ſupple knee,</l>
               <l>And doctors ſage he could not but admire,</l>
               <l>Who ſtoop'd profoundly low—to riſe the higher.</l>
               <l>So much of ermine, lace, beaus, biſhops, young and old,</l>
               <l>'Twas like a cloud of ſable edg'd with gold:</l>
               <l>By turns his Grace the ſervile train addreſt,</l>
               <l>Pleas'd with a ſmile, or in a whiſper bleſt.</l>
               <l>Sick of the ſcene, the vicar ſought the door,</l>
               <l>Determin'd never to ſee London more;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0388401200:183"/>
But, as his friend had pleas'd the hour to fix,</l>
               <l>Firſt went to dinner to my Lord's at ſix;—</l>
               <l>He knock'd—was uſher'd to the room of ſtate,</l>
               <l>(My Lord abroad) and dinner ſerv'd in plate;</l>
               <l>Which, tho' it ſeem'd but common ſoup and haſh,</l>
               <l>Was really callipee and callipaſh,</l>
               <l>(The relicks of the gaudy day before)</l>
               <l>What Indians eat, and Engliſhmen adore;</l>
               <l>With bright champaign the courtier crown'd the feaſt,</l>
               <l>Sooth'd his own pride, and gratify'd his gueſt:</l>
               <l>All this conſpir'd our Stoic to controul,</l>
               <l>And warpt the ſteady purpoſe of his ſoul—</l>
               <l>When lo! the cry of fire creates amaze—</l>
               <l>" The next houſe, Lady Riot's, in a blaze"—</l>
               <l>Aghaſt the vicar ſtood, in wild affright,</l>
               <l>Then briefly thus addreſs'd the prieſt polite:</l>
               <l>" Adieu, my friend—your ſtate I envy not—</l>
               <l>" Beef, liberty, and ſafety be my lot."</l>

               <l>With an offer of fortune (and well-tim'd it was,</l>
               <l>For poets have ſeldom much rent from Parnaſs')</l>
               <l>Cried, my lord you'll excuſe me, but I have a reaſon</l>
               <l>Why even this offer becomes out of ſeaſon;</l>
               <l>I've a new book of ſonnets juſt ripe for the preſs,</l>
               <l>Upon the ſame plan as the laſt, you may gueſs;</l>
               <l>I have there, all along, made my Laura a goddeſs,</l>
               <l>And Venus, to pleaſe me, has lent her the boddice;</l>
               <l>While Hebe, Minerva, and twenty to boot,</l>
               <l>With gifts all celeſtial have trick'd me her out.</l>
               <l>Now marriage, my lord, the whole charm would deſtroy,</l>
               <l>And hurl her divinity quite from the ſky,</l>
               <l>To my coſt I ſhould find her no more than a woman,</l>
               <l>And my ſonnets, alas! would gain credit with no man.</l>

               <p>THE great character Maphaeus Vegius bore among the learned, may be a ſufficient reaſon for me to have attempted the following tranſlation; in which I was the more encouraged, as I do not know of any other verſion but one by Thomas Twine, doctor of phyſic, printed in the year 1584; and he, I am ſure, is no powerful antagoniſt. I ſhall not pretend to criticiſe upon my author; but ſhall only obſerve, by the way, that I think him too fond of repetitions, ſome of which I have hurried over, and others I have entirely ſtruck out.</p>
               <p>Maphaeus Vegius was born at Lodi, in the Milaneze, in the year 1407, and was ſecretary of the briefs to pope Martin the Fifth, and afterwards datary. He was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe endowed with a canonry of St. Peter's, with which he was ſo well contented, that he refuſed a rich biſhoprick. Pope Eugenius the Fourth, and Nicholas the Fifth, out of their regard for his learning, and affection to his perſon, continued him in his office of datary.</p>
               <p>He died at Rome in the year 1459.</p>

               <p>Turnus being ſlain by Eneas, the Rutuli ſubmit to the conqueror, and are ſuffered to carry off their dead leader with all his armour, except the belt of Pallas, which i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to be ſent back to Evander. Eneas ſacrifices to the gods. Latinus deplores the death of Turnus. So does Daunus his father, who likewiſe laments a great confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, that lays his city in aſhes, and is miraculouſly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into a bird called a heron. Latinus ſends meſſengers to Eneas with propoſals of peace, and a treaty of marriage with his daughter Lavinia, which are both accepted. He comes to Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum, marries the daughter of the king, and at his death ſucceeds him in the kingdom, having firſt founded a city of his own, which he names Lavinium. Venus interceeds with Jupiter to make her ſon a god, which he conſents to. She flies with him to heaven, and he is afterwards worſhipped by the Romans.</p>

               <l>Of new milk, made as warm as it comes from the cow.</l>

               <l>With the rum in a jar, and give 'em a ſtir up;</l>
