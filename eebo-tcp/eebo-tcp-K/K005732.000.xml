            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SHOULD any one be curious about the origin of this petty Drama, they will find the ſtory on which it is founded, among the twelve Exemplary Novels written by the celebrated Author of Don Quixote; under the title of The Jealous Huſband. Some little variation has been neceſſary in the ground-work, in order to render it dramatic; but the characters are untouched from the inimitable pencil of the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigner; unleſs the dialogue with which the Engliſh writer ſupplies them has done them an injury. The chief addition to the fable is the circumſtance of the padlock, and the four laſt lines of the opera ſufficiently mark the place from whence that is taken.</p>

                  <p>I dreamt laſt night that I was going to church with Leonora to be married, and that we were met on the road by a drove of oxen—oxen—I don't like oxen; I wiſh it had been a flock of ſheep.</p>

Fine feathers, they ſay, make fine birds; but, I am ſure they don't make happy ones; a ſparrow is happier in the fields than a gold-finch in a cage. There is ſomething makes me mighty uneaſy. While he was talking to me, I thought I never ſaw any thing look ſo ugly in my life—O dear now, why did I forget to aſk leave to go to maſs to-morrow?

                  <p>To deſperation, and I believe I am not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to her; for finding that her jealous guardian took her to the chapel of a neighbouring convent every morning before it was light, I went there in the habit of a pilgrim, planting myſelf as near her as I could; I then varied my appearance, continuing to do ſo from time to time, till I was convinced ſhe had ſufficiently remarked, and underſtood my meaning.</p>

                  <p>All dark, all quiet, gone to bed and faſt aſleep I warrant them; however I am not ſorry that I altered my firſt intention of ſtaying out the whole night; and meeting Leonora's father on the road, was at any rate a lucky incident. I will not diſturb them; but, ſince I have let myſelf in with my maſter key, go ſoftly to bed; I ſhall be able to ſtrike a light, and then I think I may ſay, my cares are over.</p>
                  <p>Good heavens! what a wonderful deal of uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may mortals avoid by a little prudence! I doubt not now, there are ſome men who would have gone out in my ſituation; and, truſting to the goodneſs of fortune, left their houſe and their honour in the care of an unexperienced girl, or the diſcretion of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary ſervant. While he is abroad, he is tormented with fears and jealouſies; and when he returns home, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably finds diſorder, and perhaps ſhame. But what do I do—I put a padlock on my door, and all is ſafe.</p>

                  <p>Young man, who are you, who have thus clandeſtinely, at an unſeaſonable hour, broke into my houſe? Am I to conſider you as a robber, or how?</p>

                  <p>As of one whom love has made indiſcreet; of one whom love taught induſtry and art to compaſs his deſigns. I love the beautiful Leonora, and ſhe me; but, farther than what you hear and ſee, neither one nor the other have been culpable.</p>

                  <p>Don Diego, you know my father well, Don Alphonſo de Luna; I am a ſcholar of this univerſity, and am willing to ſubmit to whatever puniſhment he, thro' your means, ſhall inflict; but wreak not your vengeance here.</p>

                  <p>Thus then my hopes and cares are at once fruſtrated; poſſeſs'd of what I thought a jewel, I was deſirous to keep it for myſelf; I rais'd up the walls of this houſe to a great height, I barr'd up my windows towards the ſtreet, I put double bolts on my doors; I baniſh'd all that had the ſhadow of man, or male kind; and I ſtood continually centinel over it myſelf, to guard my ſuſpicion from ſurprize; thus ſecur'd, I left my watch for one little moment, and in that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment——</p>

But, tho' I was too old to be wiſe, I am not too old to learn; and ſo, I ſay, ſend for a ſmith directly, beat all the grates from my windows, take the locks from my doors, let egreſs and regreſs be given freely.</p>
