            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The following ſheets are printed for the benefit of Mr.
Pſalmanazar's executrix; who thought it right to prefix his LAST WILL AND
TESTAMENT, as the beſt introduction to them. Mr. Pſalmanazar's firſt
intimation of giving this public ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of himſelf, may be found under the
article Formoſa, in the COMPLETE SYSTEM OF GEOGRAPHY<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. ii. p. 251. This work was publiſhed in 1747.</note>, in
which he aſſiſted as a writer<note n="†" place="bottom">Mem. p.
339.</note>. Where he was born, and who were his parents, do not yet appear for
certain; even in theſe poſthumous memoirs he has endeavoured to keep them
inviolable ſecrets. From circumſtances however there is little reaſon to
doubt, but that he was a native of France: indeed he ſpoke the French
lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſo well, beyond what is uſual when attained by grammar or travel
only, that we do not queſtion to ſay, He was a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. His
pronunciation had a ſpice of the Gaſcoin accent, and in that provincial 
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0401000300:4"/> dialect he was ſo maſterly, that none but thoſe born
in the country could equal, none though born there could excel him: for
notwithſtanding it may be eſteemed but a <hi>patois,</hi> or jargon, yet
foreigners find it imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable to be ſpoken with propriety, and with that
fluency and vivacity peculiar to thoſe people: and from this we preſume,
that ſome part of Languedoc may lay claim to his birth. The reverend Mr.
Villette, who was intimately acquainted with him for upwards of four and twenty
years, (and had many opportunities to obſerve him, and to know him well) has
communicated theſe conjectures, which the judicious reader, perhaps, will
ſee ſufficiently confirmed from ſeveral paſſages in the memoirs
themſelves.</p>

            <head>THE LAST WILL AND TESTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT OF ME A POOR SINFUL AND WORTHLESS
CREATURE COMMONLY KNOWN BY THE ASSUMED NAME OF GEORGE PSALMANAZAR</head>
            <p>Thy ever bleſſed and unerring Will, Oh moſt gracious, though
offended God! be done by me and all the world, whether for life or death.</p>
            <p>Into thy all-merciful hands I commit my ſoul, as unto a moſt
gracious Father, who, though juſtly provoked by my paſt vain, and wicked
life, but more eſpecially ſo during the youthful ſallies of a raſh and
unthinking part of it, has yet been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed, by thy
undeſerved grace and mercy, to preſerve me from the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing errors and
hereſies, and the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable apoſtacy and infidelity of the
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age, and enabled me to take a conſtant <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0401000300:6"/> and
ſtedfaſt hold on the only author of our ſalvation, thy ever adorable and
divine Son Jeſus Chriſt, our powerful and meritorious Redeemer, from
whoſe alone, and all-powerful interceſſion and merits (and not from any
the leaſt inherent righteouſneſs of my own, which I heartily abhor as
filthy rags in thine all purer eyes) I hope and beg for pardon and
reconciliation, and for a happy reſurrection unto that bleſſed
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to which we are redeemed by his moſt precious and ineſtimable
blood. I likewiſe bleſs and adore thy infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for preſerving
me from innumerable dangers of body and ſoul, to which this wretched life,
but more particularly by my own youthful raſhneſs and inconſideration,
might have expoſed me, had not thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence interpoſed in ſuch
a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner, as juſtly challenges my deepeſt admiration and
acknowledgment: particularly I am bound to bleſs thee for ſo timely nipping
that ambition and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, which had hurried me through ſuch ſcenes of
impiety and hypocriſy, and as the moſt effectual antidote againſt it,
next to thy divine grace, haſt brought me not only <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0401000300:7"/> to
prefer, but to delight in a ſtate of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and lowneſs of
circumſtances, as the ſureſt harbour of peace and ſafety; by which,
though the little I have left in my poſſeſſion be dwindled to ſo
little value as to be but a poor acknowledgment for the ſervices which I have
received from my friend hereafter named, to whom I can do no leſs than
bequeath it all, yet I hope the will may be accepted for the deed, and that the
Divine Providence will ſupply to her what is wanting in me. And now, O
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mercies, I beſeech thee for thy dear Son's ſake, ſo to direct
me by thy grace through all the future concerns of this life, that when, where,
or in what manner ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhall pleaſe thee to call me out of it, I
may be found ready and willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn my ſoul, worthleſs as it is of
itſelf, to thee who gaveſt it; and my death, as well as my latter end, may
be ſuch as may tend all poſſible ways to thy glory, the edification of
thy church, and my own eternal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. And in hopes there is nothing in this
my laſt will that is not agreeable to thine, I leave it to be executed after
my death by my worthy and pious friend Sarah Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walling, <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0401000300:8"/> of
this pariſh of St. Luke, in Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex, in the manner hereafter mentioned,
viz.</p>
            <p>I deſire that my body, when or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I die, may be kept
ſo long above ground, as decency or conveniency will permit, and afterwards
conveyed to the common burying-ground, and there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred in ſome obſcure
corner of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further ceremony or formality than is uſed to the
bodies of the deceaſed pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners where I happen to die, and about the
ſame time of the day, and that the whole may be performed in the loweſt and
cheapeſt manner. And it is my ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt requeſt, that my body be not
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in any kind of coffin, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently laid in what is called a
ſhell of the loweſt value, and without lid or other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering which may
hinder the natural earth from covering it all around.</p>
            <p>The books relating to the Univerſal Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and belonging to
the Proprietors, are to be returned to them according to the true liſt of
them, which will be found in a blue paper in my account book. All the reſt
being my own property, together with <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0401000300:9"/> all my houſhold
goods, wearing apparel, and whatever money ſhall be found due to me after my
deceaſe, I give and bequeath to my friend Sarah Rewalling above named,
together with ſuch manuſcripts as I had written at different times, and
deſigned to be made public, if they ſhall be deemed worthy of it, they
conſiſting of ſundry eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays on ſome difficult parts of the Old
Teſtament, and chiefly written for the uſe of a young Clergyman in the
country, and ſo unhappily acquainted with that kind of learning, that he was
likely to become the but of his ſceptical pariſhioners, but being, by this
means, furniſhed with proper ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, was enabled to turn the tables upon
them.</p>
            <p>But the principal manuſcript I thought my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in duty bound
to leave behind, is a faithful narrative of my education, and the ſallies of
my wretched youthful years, and the various ways by which I was in ſome
meaſure unavoidably led into the baſe and ſhameful impoſture of
paſſing upon the world for a native of Formoſa, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to
Chriſtianity, and backing it with a fictitious account of that iſland, and
of my <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0401000300:10"/> own travels, converſion, &amp;c. all or moſt of
it hatched in my own brain, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to truth and honeſty. It is true,
I have long ſince diſclaimed even publicly all but the ſhame and guilt of
that vile im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, yet as long as I knew there were ſtill two editions
of that ſcandalous romance remaining in England, beſides the ſeveral
verſions it had abroad, I thought it incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon me to undeceive the
world, by unravelling that whole myſtery of iniquity in a poſthumous work,
which would be leſs liable to ſuſpicion, as the author would be far out
of the influence of any ſiniſter motives that might induce him to deviate
from the truth. All that I ſhall add con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it is, that it was began
above twenty-five years ago with that view, and no other, during a long
receſs in the country, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a threatening diſeaſe, and
ſince then continued in my moſt ſerious hours, as any thing new
preſented itſelf; ſo that it hath little elſe to recommend it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
but its plainneſs and ſincerity, except here and there ſome uſeful
obſervations and innuendoes on thoſe branches of learning in which I had
been concerned, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0401000300:11"/> with ſuch excellent
improvements as might be made in the method of learning of Hebrew, and in the
producing a more perfect body of Univerſal Hiſtory, and more anſwerable
to its title than that which hath already paſſed a ſecond edition. And
theſe, I thought, might be more deſerving a place in that narrative, as the
uſefulneſs of them would in a great meaſure make amends for the ſmall
charge of the whole. If it therefore ſhall be judged worth printing, I
deſire it may be ſold to the higheſt bidder, in order to pay my arrears
for my lodgings, and to defray my funeral; and I further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt that it be
printed in the plain and undiſguiſed manner in which I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it,
and without alteration or embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I hope the whole is written in the
true, ſincere ſpirit of a perſon awakened by a miracle of mercy, unto a
deep ſenſe of his folly, guilt, and danger, and is deſirous, above all
things, to give God the whole glory of ſo gracious a change, and to ſhew
the various ſteps by which his Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence brought it about. The whole
of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count contains fourteen pages of Preface, and <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0401000300:12"/>
about ninety-three more of the ſaid relation, written in my own hand with a
proper title, and will be found in the deep drawer on the right hand of my
white cabinet. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if the obſcurity I have lived in, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a
ſeries of years, ſhould make it needleſs to revive a thing in all
likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ſo long ſince forgot, I cannot but wiſh, that ſo much of it
was publiſhed in ſome weekly paper, as might inform the world, eſpecially
thoſe who have ſtill by them the above-mentioned fabulous account of the
Iſland of Formoſa, &amp;c. that I have long ſince owned both in
converſation and in print, that it was no other than a mere forgery of my own
deviſing, a ſcandalous impoſition on the puclic, and ſuch, as I think
myſelf bound to beg God and the world pardon for writing, and have been long
ſince, as I am to this day, and ſhall be as long as I live, heartily
ſorry for, and aſhamed of.</p>

            <p>As the deſign of my leaving the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Memoirs, is at once
to undeceive the world with reſpect to that vile and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic account I
formerly gave of myſelf, and of the iſland of Formoſa, and to make all
the amends in my power for that ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful impoſition on the public, by
leaving behind me this faithful narrative of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of the remarkable
accidents of my wretched life that led me to it, as well as of thoſe that
deterred me from perſiſting in it; it will not be improper here to
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſome of the chief motives that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined me to write the
following ſheets, to be printed after my death.</p>
            <p>The religious education I had happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived during my tender

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0401000300:16"/> care and concern for me into the juſteſt abhorrence
and deteſtation of me.</p>
            <p>Under theſe pungent reflections, which were, however, but too
often ſmothered by various carnal conſiderations, and the violent hurry of
my paſſions, I was not without ſome hopes that the ſame divine
goodneſs, which had not ſuffered me to harden into an utter
inſenſibility of my guilt, might, in his own good time, enable me to
ſurmount all the dreadful difficulties which my carnal mind laid in my way,
and finiſh that good work which my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe gave me cauſe to hope was
begun by his undeſerved grace in me. I was not, however, without ſome
apprehenſions from a ſenſe of my extreme guilt, leſt that, which I
cheriſhed under the notion of hope, ſhould prove only a vain and
ill-grounded pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, at leaſt I began to fear I had reaſon to think
it ſo, whilſt I continued inactive, and depended merely on a few faint
wiſhes and prayers, inſtead of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ſtrong resolutions and
efforts, which might aſſure me of the divine grace co-operating with
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0401000300:17"/>In this fluctuating and wretched uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
I continued ſome years, not knowing which way to begin or go about the
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous and dreaded taſk, when a grievous and lingering fit of illneſs
did, in ſome meaſure, hurry me to it, and made me determine immediately to
ſet pen to paper, and employ all the time my diſtemper would allow me, to
undo as much as was in my power all the miſchief I had done, by leaving
behind me a faithful account of every thing I could recollect, and that had
been inſtrumental to ſo fatal and long a train of miſcarriages, in order
to ſet the whole impoſture in ſo true a light, that no part of the
ſhame may fall on the guiltleſs, but on the guilty; and that is chiefly on
my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>I ſet about it accordingly, and if I did not begin ſo
neceſſary and laudable a work, till driven as it were to it by pain and
ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by the fear of death, and of the divine diſpleaſure, I hope
it will be ſo far from leſſening the credit of the following narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
that it will rather add weight to it, ſeeing no time or circumſtances can
be <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0401000300:18"/> more apt to inſpire a man with the deepeſt
ſeriouſneſs and ſincerity, than thoſe I was in, when I wrote the
moſt conſiderable and mortifying part of it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore only add, that my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper was a lingering
every-other-day ague, which laſted me about ſix weeks, and that being then
in a ſweet place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement in the country, at a very good friend's
houſe, and taken ſufficient care of in all other reſpects, I had all the
time and opportunity I could wiſh for, joined with the propereſt
diſpoſition of mind for ſuch a taſk, ſo that through God's
bleſſing I was enabled to bring down the ſhameful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my former
unfortunate life through the moſt ſhocking and impious ſcenes of it, to
my arrival into England without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, and I hope in God with that
ſincerity and ſeriouſneſs as ſuch a relation could require, and my
bad ſtate of health could inſpire me with, ſtill taking care be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all
things to implore the divine aſſiſtance of the great ſearcher of all
hearts every time I ſat down to write, that he would direct me to go through
the arduous taſk with <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0401000300:19"/> ſuch a due regard to truth,
whatever ſhame reflected on me, as might in all reſpects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to his
glory, and entitle me to his pardon and mercy; and to him I give all the
praiſe, for having enabled me not only to go on ſo far with the wiſhed
for work during my retreat there, but to reſume it ſince at proper times,
till I had brought it to the deſired concluſion.</p>
            <p>For being, ſoon after my recovery, obliged to return to London,
and engaged in a work, which neceſſarily took up too much of my time and
thoughts, to permit me to go on with this, in the ſame regular manner I had
done in the country (though ſtill reſolved by God's aſſiſtance to go
through with it) I determined to ſet apart an hour at leaſt every
Wedneſday and Friday to reviſe what I had wrote, and to continue the
narrative as my memory ſerved; not doubting but the ſolemnity of the
faſt, joined to the prayers and other meditations I had appropriated for
theſe two days, in the method of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion I was through God's bleſſing
entered into, would prove effectual means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ſpirit of
ſincerity and ſeriouſneſs <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0401000300:20"/> which I earneſtly
wiſhed might go through the remainder, as I was conſcious it had done in
the former part, whilſt I laboured under my illneſs.</p>
            <p>I went on accordingly for ſome time with it, till the other
buſineſs I had in hand, and ſome other avocations, as well as ſometimes
an indiſpoſition of the mind, unhinged me from my method oftener than I
wiſhed; for at ſuch times I found myſelf ſo unfit to purſue it, that
I plainly ſaw it was better to diſcontinue it till I could recover my
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer frame. This occaſioned ſometimes an intermiſſion of two or more
weeks as to the writing part, though the matter was ſtill ſo preſſing
on my mind, that it only gave me an opportunity, either of recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting ſome
things I had omitted, or of gathering freſh materials for the ſequel.</p>
            <p>But as my aim was only to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what either chiefly
hurried me on through ſuch a long train of the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable follies
and vanities, or of what brought me to a ſenſe and abhorrence of them, I
have omitted a great number of the former, as rather apt to diſguſt than
entertain or inform a ſober reader, and <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0401000300:21"/> confined
myſelf to the latter, as the more likely to prove inſtructive and uſeful
to him. And I ſhall not be very ſolicitous what judgment thoſe will
paſs on this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, who are ſtrangers to religion and the various ways
of the Divine Providence in reclaiming ſinners, firſt by driving, and then
drawing them to himſelf, provided I can acquit myſelf to my own
conſcience that I have taken all poſſible care to write it with that
ſincerity and faithfulneſs that I would wiſh it to be done at my laſt
moments, and with no other view than that of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a full and ample
acknowledgment of my great folly and guilt, as my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience told me I ought
to do for having ſo long and ſo ſhamefully impoſed upon the world, as
well as of God's ſingular good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which inſpired me with the deſign,
and hath enabled me to go through it in the manner I have done.</p>
            <p>The reaſons of my not chuſing to have it publiſhed during my
life, beſides thoſe already hinted, will be ſeen in the ſequel, and I
hope will be thought ſolid and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, eſpecially as it hath given
me an opportunity of continuing the latter (and <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0401000300:22"/> as I hope
in God) the much better part of my life, and of adding to it ſeveral uſeful
particulars, which the reader will find there; ſuch as my eaſy and
expeditious method of ſtudying, and attaining to a fuller knowledge of the
Hebrew tongue; ſundry curious and inſtructive obſervations relating to
ſome of the works I have been engaged in, in the learned way, particularly in
that long and laborious one of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Hiſtory, of the deſign,
beginning, and purſuit, together with the difficulties, miſcarriages,
faults, and other matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to both editions of it; and I have been the
better able to give ſuch an account of the whole as may be of uſe to the
public, eſpecially to the purchaſers, as I have been concerned in it from
the beginning.</p>
            <p>The reader will likewiſe find the latter part of this narrative
interſperſed with many other particular accidents which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
contributed not only to keep me ſteady in my reſolutions and change of
life, but which have likewiſe inſenſibly led me into a more regular way
of thinking and acting; and, as true repentance begins in the change of the
heart, and ends at the reformation <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0401000300:23"/> of the ſinner's life,
I may humbly hope that I have not been negligent in finding out and uſing the
moſt effectual helps and means, nor failed of the divine bleſſing on
them, which are promiſed to all ſincere pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents. Though the fear I was
in, leſt too particular an account of them ſhould be deemed, by the
cenſorious, as oſtentatious and phariſaical, hath obliged me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
a great number of them, which might perhaps have otherwiſe proved very
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging to people in my condition; not doubting but to thoſe who are
ſincere in their repentance and reſolutions, the ſame Divine Providence
will ſuppeditate all the neceſſary helps and directions as their caſe
requires, even as it hath graciouſly done to me.</p>
            <p>All I would add by way of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perſons in my
unhappy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances (and worſe or more dangerous no man could hardly be
in than I was) is not to let the greatneſs of their guilt, or the
difficulties of the duties of repentance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but rather invite him to the
throne of mercy, through the merits of our Divine Redeemer; for how dark and
gloomy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0401000300:24"/> the proſpect of ſo extraordinary a
change may appear at firſt, as every thing doth to thoſe that are fled from
the broad ſun-ſhine into ſome dark place; yet thoſe thick and
diſcouraging miſts will gradually diſappear, and every object that at
firſt raiſed our fears will grow more hopeful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, when we
call to mind that there is mercy ſufficient in God, merits enough in
Chriſt, power more than ſufficient in the Divine Spirit, room enough in
heaven, ſcope enough in the evangelical promiſes, and the moſt endearing
invitations in the Goſpel, to bring the greateſt ſinners to God of
infinite mercy and compaſſion; ſo that there can be thenceforth no
condemnation to them that, with faith and repentance, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to him for pardon
and grace through the merits of his ever-bleſſed Son, and uſe all proper
means and helps to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a fit object of it.</p>
            <p>We muſt not however ſuppoſe that the bleſſed effects of
ſuch a repentance will be ſo ſoon felt by us as we could wiſh, or that
the duties of ſelf-denial, ſelf-abhorrence, faſting, ſolitude,
meditation, ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, &amp;c. will become eaſy and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0401000300:25"/> as ſoon as we are entered into a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious regimen: we
muſt, on the contrary, expect them to appear difficult and gloomy at the
beginning, in order to excite our faith and reliance on the Divine
aſſiſtance, which draws us not with an irreſiſtible force, but with
the cords of men, and the bands of love (Hoſ. xi. 4.) We muſt likewiſe
expect to meet with frequent foils and backſlidings in order to make us more
dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and watchful, more ſenſible of our own weakneſs, and more
intent on that help which comes from above. By this means, we ſhall
likewiſe be happily preſerved from that pride and preſumption, which is
but too apt to inſinuate itſelf into the minds of new converts; for
experience plainly ſhews, that thoſe two dangerous vices will be apt to
ſpring, not only out of our ſins and paſſions, but likewiſe out of
our very virtues and graces, if not duly kept down, by the ſenſe or
experience of our own infirmities and impotence.</p>
            <p>It was an excellent caution of a pious clergyman: 
<q rend="inline">"Don't preſume; you are not yet come to a
ſtate of Chriſtian perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: don't deſpair; you are in the way 
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0401000300:26"/> to it."</q> So that whatever difficulties or
diſcouragements we may meet with in our progreſs, how ſhort ſoever we
may come of our duty, or whatever frailties, or even vices we may ſtill be
prone to, which may either divert or retard our ſpeed, we may ſtill comfort
ourſelves with the hopes, that we are in a way of growing better, and that
the uſe of thoſe means hath not only preſerved us in a great meaſure
from grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great deal worſe, but enabled us to riſe after every fall,
if it hath not ſometimes made even thoſe falls rebound to a greater heighth
of grace, by teaching us, from every ſuch ſtep, to tread more ſure for
the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and what a comfortable proſpect muſt this yield to a man that
hath made any progreſs in this happy way, to ſee God's ſtrength magnified
in his own weakneſs, eſpecially when he adds thereto this bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
conſideration, that the ſame all-merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious blood which was ſhed to
expiate all his wilful, if truly repented, tranſgreſſions, will much more
effectually atone for all his involuntary defects.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought incumbent on me to ſay on this head,
becauſe whatever our <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0401000300:27"/> freethinkers may boaſt of the
ſufficient power of reaſon to reclaim a man from a long vicious courſe,
from the prevalency of evil habits and conſtitutional vices, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
powerful influence they may aſcribe to the notion of eternal rectitude,
&amp;c. to reduce a man that hath deflected ſo wide and far from it, without
any of thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural helps above-mentioned; yet I am well
aſſured, that the former, without the latter, would have proved (to me at
leaſt, if not to any man in my condition) rather a determent than an
effectual means; for what hopes or likelihood could there be that a wretch, who
had, by his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous paſſion, been hurried into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of
ſuch a ſeries of impieties againſt his own reaſon and conſcience,
ſhould ever be able to extricate himſelf from ſuch a ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh ſtate
by his own baſe natural power?</p>
            <p>What efficacious help could he expect from his own reaſoning
faculties, which, however cried up by others, he had found, by ſad
experience, ſo weak and impotent, that the moſt they could do for him, was
to make him condemn himſelf, without being able to rectify or reſiſt the
violent <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0401000300:28"/> impulſes of his predominant vice? Had, indeed,
his knowledge of mankind fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with any remarkable inſtance of the
prevalency of reaſon above a favourite vice, it might have given him ſome
encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; but when he ſees, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that theſe ſtrenuous
deſpiſers of all ſupernatural helps, equally enſlaved to ſome
favourite paſſion, and only differing from him perhaps in degree; the
moſt he could expect his reaſon to do for him, would be to keep his own
under ſome reſtraint and decorum, till time and indulgence had quite
exhauſted them.</p>
            <p>But what poor encouragement is this to one in my dangerous caſe?
how inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the change or remorſe? what poor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the
world for ſo vile an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and what likelihood that it would procure
a pardon from an offended God, or calm the ſtings of a wounded conſcience?
And how much happier was it for me that I was directed to look up for and
depend on a ſuperior aſſiſtance, and inſtead of truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch
a broken reed of my reaſon and ſtrength, to apply myſelf to that Supreme
Being, whoſe grace alone could work ſuch <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0401000300:29"/> an
extraordinary change in the heart, give an effectual bleſſing on my weak
efforts, and keep me ſteady in thoſe reſolutions which he had inſpired
me with, as well as in the uſe of thoſe means he hath provided and
preſcribed to us!</p>
            <p>I gladly repeat it, that nothing leſs than the hopes of his
promiſed grace could have induced me to endeavour after it, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but
a full reliance on the merits of a Divine Interceſſor could have invited me
to cry to him for pardon and acceptance; and, on the other hand, nothing but
the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it could have ſupported me under my doubts and fears, my
difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, nor enabled me to perſevere in, and
nothing leſs than the continuance and increaſe of it could have brought a
work of ſuch extraordinary and undeſerved mercy to perfection.</p>
            <p>I cannot therefore but think it the greateſt injury that can be
done, to perſons who have unhappily ſwerved from the paths of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and
religion, to make them depend ſolely on the ſtrength of their rational
faculties for an effectual change, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire them with a diſregard
for the more <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0401000300:30"/> powerful means and motives which the Goſpel
offers to them, and which, upon experience, will be found the only ones that
can bring it about. And may what I have here ſaid inſpire every awakened
ſinner, (who hath tried in vain the ſucceſs of the former) with the more
comfortable hope and ſtedfaſt confidence, in the never-failing efficacy of
the latter.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid thus much on the ſubject of the divine grace
offered to us in the Goſpel, it will doubtleſs be expected that I ſhould
give ſome farther account of my private be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief ſo far as relates to the
controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the church of Rome, in which I was educated, and that of
England, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of which I have lived, ever ſince my coming into
England. And here I muſt confeſs, to my very great ſhame, that though I
did for ſeveral years profeſs myſelf a zealous member of the latter, yet
the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of my education, and the general courſe of my ſtudies, did
ſtill ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline me in favour of the former; inſomuch that neither
the many books of controverſy I had read on that ſubject, nor my frequent
diſputes with prieſts and others of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0401000300:31"/>
(in which, however, I had ſtill va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity enough to give the preference to my
arguments againſt it) could fix my waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind, much leſs could I be
induced to think it ſo corrupt and dangerous, antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian and idolatrous
as it was with ſo much warmth maintained to be by moſt prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
writers and preachers; inſomuch that this uncharitable zeal of theirs made me
ſtill more doubtful whether the reaſons they urged were ſufficient to
juſtify their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from it.</p>
            <p>I was indeed ſincerely perſuaded, from all that I had read or
heard, that the church of England was by far the beſt and ſafeſt of all
the proteſtant churches; but that it was really more ſo than that of Rome,
I was far enough from being ſatisfied in my mind; ſo that there was
almoſt as little ſincerity in my pretended zeal for and conſtant
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with it, than in my pretended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to it: the truth of it
is, that I was too young and heedleſs, vain and conceited, to lie open to
conviction, and that I read and heard the arguments on both ſides, rather to
fill my head than to rectify my heart, or fix my belief; ſo that I muſt
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0401000300:32"/> that I acted at that time a very ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and inſincere part, in the preference I ſo ſtrenuouſly gave to the one
above the other, which, though ever ſo juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, did not appear
then in that light to me.</p>
            <p>In this careleſs, though impious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, ſuſpence I
continued ſome years (which, upon the whole, was but of a piece with the
other and more flagrant part of my impoſture) till I came to read a
treatiſe, intituled, THE CASE STATED BETWEEN A NOBLEMAN OF THE CHURCH OF
ROME, AND A GENTLEMAN OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND, in which I thought I found the
controverſy fully and clearly decided in favour of the latter. And I gave the
heed to the arguments on both ſides, not only as they appeared to me to be
ſtated with the greateſt clearneſs and impartiality, but as I had been
long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Mr. Charles Leſley, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted author of that book,
who was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally allowed to be one of the learnedeſt men in that
controverſy, and had moreover given the ſtrongeſt proofs of his probity
and ſincerity, as well as of his capacity and <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0401000300:33"/>
unbiaſſed judgment; of all which I was ſo fully appriſed, that no book
that I had read did ever contribute ſo much, if not to fix my wavering mind,
yet at leaſt to make me think more ſeriouſly on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and to
give myſelf up to a freſh and more cloſe application to that
controverſy, and the reading of all the beſt authors who had, or ſhould
afterwards write on either ſide; for I doubted not but we ſhould ſoon
hear of one or more anſwers from ſome of the beſt pens from that ſide,
againſt it. However, though I never could learn of any that was made to it,
it did not divert me from my purpoſe. And indeed I found myſelf ſo
ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed in favour of the author, that I had reaſon to
fear leſt the impreſſion which his book had made upon my mind, ſhould
be owing to that, rather than to the validity of his arguments, until I had
read over afreſh all that had been urged in favour of the oppoſite ſide.
But here again, though I went over them with the greateſt attention and
ſincerity, I found the diſpute ſo ſtrangely managed, and clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with
ſuch elaborate learning and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry, ſuch controverted quotations
from <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0401000300:34"/> the Scriptures and ancient fathers, ſuch
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian charges of forgery, and perverting the ſenſe of thoſe
authors, and other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable language, as rather bewildered than convinced
my mind; ſo that the only fruit I reaped from all my reading (beſides a
ſtrong prejudice againſt thoſe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſide, whom I obſerved
to deal moſt in that unfair way of diſputing) was, that there could be no
ſafety in truſting to my own judgment in a matter of ſuch vaſt concern;
and that it was next to impoſſible for men, frail as we are, and warped by
our own paſſions and prejudices, to wade through ſuch ſtormy ſeas of
controverſy, without an extraordinary aſſiſtance from the fountain of
all light and truth. I have accordingly made it my conſtant care ever
ſince, that is, for above theſe twenty-five years, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply myſelf
fervently, and to depend wholly upon that divine guide for a deliverance from
all errors of faith and practice, and for ſuch an increaſe of his light and
grace as may confirm me in the belief of all his ſaving truths, obedience to
all his commands, ſincere communion with his holy catholic church, and a
tender and charitable concern <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0401000300:35"/> for all thoſe who have
ſwerved from it. To theſe petitions (which I conſtantly offered up to
God, not only morning and night for a long ſeries of years, but in a more
copious and fuller form, ſuitable to my own exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, on more ſolemn, that
is, on faſt and feſtival days) I hope is owing, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſatisfaction
which I have ſince been bleſſed with, in my more ſteady and ſincere
communion with the church of England, and in the preference I now give it to
all other churches; and, as I hope in God, without the leaſt breach of
charity to any of the reſt. And indeed by all that I have read, or been able
to judge, I have been more and more convinced that theirs and ours are all in
an imperfect ſtate, though ſome more than others, and that they are like to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo till the riſing again of the ſun of righteouſneſs upon
us, whoſe brightneſs will then enlighten at once both hemiſpheres, and
who will then not only reform what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is amiſs in his myſtical body, but
bring the Jews, Turks, and Heathen into it; till then we can only in charity
bewail what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever errors we ſee in them, either in faith or practice, and pray
to God to reform them <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0401000300:36"/> in his own good time, and to be
merciful to thoſe whoſe hearts are ſincere towards him, whatever
involuntary miſtakes they may labour under.</p>
            <p> Infallibility in the church were a bleſſing as much to be
wiſhed for in this uncertain ſtate, as it is falſely challenged by the
church of Rome; but ſince reaſon and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhew it to be denied to
us, and many ſincere members of that church do pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately bewail the errors
that are crept into it, though loath to own them a ſufficient cauſe for our
ſeparation from it, it highly becomes us all to make the beſt uſe of that
guide which God hath given us, viz. his divine revealed Will and Word, without
breaking the bond of Charity with thoſe who interpret it in a different way
from us: for though, in that reſpect, we may juſtly enough acknowledge in
the words of our church's confeſſion, that 
<q rend="inline"> "we have" all, more or leſs, "erred and
ſtrayed like loſt ſheep,"</q> and that perhaps chiefly through our 
<q rend="inline">"following too much the devices and deſires of
our hearts;"</q> yet as God is the only judge how far every man is faulty in
that reſpect, ſhould we not be very <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0401000300:37"/> careful to paſs
ſuch a favourable judgment on them, as may entitle us to the ſame
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence from the judge of all hearts? Should it not at leaſt (ſeeing we
are all alike fallible, and ſtand in need of the ſame charitable allowance)
make us exceeding fearful how we do, by our anathemas and other unchriſtian
denunciations againſt thoſe that differ from us, expoſe ourſelves to
the ſame ſevere ſentence, and meet with the ſame meaſure at the
laſt day, as we have ſo freely dealt unto them? This unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
condemning ſpirit, which hath ſo long reigned among Chriſtians of all
denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I have long ſince looked upon as the moſt dangerous error a
man can fall into, as it is indeed the moſt open violation of the grand
characteriſtic of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I have been ready to ſhudder when I have heard ſome of our
preachers inveigh, in that uncharitable way, againſt their
Fellow-chriſtians, or even againſt our modern Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkers and Deiſts.
Some of them I have heard and read, who could not ſpeak or write of them
without ridicule and deriſion, inſtead of that pity and concern which is
due to perſons in that dangerous ſtate; and, <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0401000300:38"/> for that
reaſon, have always thought them the moſt unfit to teach others, who had
all the true ſpirit of Chriſtianity to ſeek, and can allow themſelves
to exult and droll over the errors and frailties of their fellow-creatures,
which even common humanity forbids us to think of or mention without the
utmoſt ſeriouſneſs and compaſſion.</p>
            <p>This uncharitable and untimely zeal, even in controverſies of
the higheſt nature, doth ſtill more miſchief in another way, by
mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying and aggravating the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the contending ſides,
which ſerves only to render them the more irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; whereas a true
chriſtian ſpirit will, from a ſenſe of its own infirmity, rather
chuſe to excuſe and palliate them, and will be extremely careful to
ſoften and ſmooth every thing that is offered in the oppoſition, in order
to render it leſs irkſome and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>
            <p>Had our divine Lawgiver deſigned that we ſhould have all
agreed, in the main points of religion, or had he ſeen any thing ſo
ſinful and dangerous in our diſagreement about it, his infinite wiſdom
and goodneſs would, doubtleſs, either have given us <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0401000300:39"/>
greater helps and brighter faculties, or would have taken care to have his
revelation made ſo plain and obvious, that none but the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and
perverſe could have erred from it. In either of which caſes, where would
there have been any room for that charitable and forbearing ſpirit which is
the peculiar cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of Chriſt's true diſciples, and is ſo
acceptable to him? not towards thoſe that agreed with us from the ſame
motives we agreed with them; nor yet much leſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that differ
from us, when it would have plainly appeared, that not their infirmity or
ignorance, but their pride and perveſeneſs made them do ſo. May we not
therefore ſafely conclude, that God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us to continue in this
imperfect and uncertain ſtate, and unavoidable diverſity of opinions, in
order to give us an opportunity of exerciſing a virtue, which is of all
others the moſt exalted and moſt acceptable to him, as being the neareſt
to its divine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>
            <p>God, who is emphatically ſtiled love, and hath been beyond all
poſſible conception diffuſive of it to us, hath, at the ſame time,
aſſured us, that the beſt returns we can make <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0401000300:40"/> to him
for it, or he expects from us, is to make our own as extenſive as we can to
all that bear his divine image: herein there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this moſt excellent
virtue, this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable ſpirit diſplayed in a manner moſt nearly
reſembling his own, when (inſtead of treating thoſe that differ from us
with contempt, ſourneſs, or impatience, which is baſe and ſelfiſh, or
with ill language, opprobrious names, unjuſt reflections, curſes, and
anathemas, which is truly diabolical) we think and look upon them with the
ſame candor, benevolence, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate concern, as we ſhould
wiſh to be ſhewn to us were their caſe our own; when we make the moſt
charitable allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances for their infirmities and miſtakes, and are ready to
aſcribe their errors to the weakneſs of their underſtanding, wrong
education, or any thing rather than to the perverſeneſs of their will;
when, by our behaviour, our prayers, and good wiſhes, we ſtrive to convince
them that all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to reclaim them from their errors, do really
ſpring from our tender ſenſe of their danger, and from ſuch a ſincere
and diſintereſted concern for their ſpiritual wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, 
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0401000300:41"/> as no oppoſition or obſtinacy on their part ſhall be
able to leſſen in the leaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that being a duty enjoined by
God, we cannot in any caſe diſpenſe with it, without danger of incurring
his diſpleaſure; and laſtly, when we can, in ſpight of all their
obſtinacy or untowardneſs, make them ſenſible, by our words and
deportment, that we wiſh their happineſs as heartily as ever; and that,
after having tried our beſt efforts in vain, we heartily recommend them
ſtill to that merciful God, whoſe equity and goodneſs will acquit and
approve every man who conſcientiouſly ſeeks for, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after
the beſt light, and is ready to obey it as far as he is able to obſerve
it.</p>
            <p>Could we once make this the aim and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of all our religious
differences and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, they would, inſtead of a bane, prove a ſtrong
cement and ſupport to Chriſtianity; we might then differ one from another
without breach of charity, as friends love one another, though of different
tempers, complexions, &amp;c. Our unbelievers would be ſo far from taking an
advantage from them to cry it down, that they muſt be forced to admire and
eſteem it for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0401000300:42"/> effects it produced in
mens hearts and lives, how wide ſoever their judgments differed in other
caſes; whereas, whilſt we make them the ſad occaſion of faction and
ſtrife, of ſelfiſhneſs and malignity, or of unreaſonable
impoſitions on the faith and practice, of ſlander, hatred, perſecution,
&amp;c. it can hardly be expected that our ſceptics and infidels will be
candid or ingenuous enough to perceive, or at leaſt to own, that all this
unchriſtian behaviour is diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>It is indeed much to be wiſhed, that ſome of the ancient
fathers had not mingled ſo much of this antichriſtian ſpirit with their
otherwiſe pious and learned writings, and had not done, as the great St.
Jerome owns himſelf, in his epiſtle to Pammachius; to have done againſt
Jovinian, that he had leſs regarded what was exactly to have been urged
againſt him, than what might be laid as a charge againſt him. How much of
our now reigning ſcepticiſm and infidelity may have been owing to ſuch an
unchriſtian ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, propagated and improved as it hath been in
ſubſequent ages, and how much ſuch uncharitable writers and preachers of 
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0401000300:43"/> controverſy will have to anſwer for it at the laſt
day, I will not preſume to determine; but thus much I may venture to infer
from it, that thoſe Boanerges did chuſe the moſt unlikely means of
recommending Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity to the unbelieving part of the world, (if ſuch
was their real deſign) when they ſtrove to propagate it in a way ſo
diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to the meek and benevolent ſpirit of its divine
author.</p>
            <p>This ſingle conſideration, joined to the ſenſe had of the
weakneſs of our underſtanding and incapacity of judging in matters of ſo
high a nature, hath long ago made me very careful of condemning or cenſuring
any church or ſect for holding any tenets which my conſcience could not
readily join in. We may indeed expoſe ourſelves to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer judgment,
by paſſing too raſh or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable a one on others, but can never run
the ſame riſk by the moſt candid and favourable allowance we can make for
them. And, after all, what have we to do to judge thoſe that differ from us,
ſince both they and we muſt ſtand accountable to him only who is the
unerring judge of all hearts?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0401000300:44"/>I cannot forbear adding, that the almoſt
unſurmountable difficulties I have found to come to the bottom of the greater
part of our diſputed points, and the little certainty or ſatisfaction I
have reaped from reading of moſt controverſies, clogged and diſguiſed
as they are with ſophiſtry and endleſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities, and managed with
ſo little appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of impartiality and charity, have made me ſuch a
Pyrrhonian in polemic divinity, that I have not dared to allow myſelf the
liberty of cenſuring thoſe who held what I thought an error in faith or
practice, or even to pronounce it to be ſuch, though I have been wanting in
neither zeal nor cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to oppoſe any ſuch on all proper occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and to give the beſt reaſon I could for my diſſenting from them; and I
much queſtion whether, in the imperfect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ſtate we are in,
reaſon or religion will permit us, much leſs require of us, to proceed
farther; and whether a more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive or categorical declaration doth not
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue ſomething worſe than prepoſſeſſion and narrowneſs of mind,
and will not be liable to be condemned as an unchriſtian warp of the
will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0401000300:45"/>The tranſubſtantiation of the church of
Rome, is a doctrine that appears the moſt ſhocking to ſenſe and
reaſon. That of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute predeſtination among the greater part of the
reformed churches, appears not only the moſt oppoſite to the divine
attributes of love, goodneſs, juſtice, &amp;c. but to ſtrike at the root
of the Chriſtian religion, which is founded on the love of God; for how is it
poſſible for a man to look upon ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary a being as that doctrine
repreſents him, but with the utmoſt awe and dread, even though he was ever
ſo fully perſuaded that himſelf was one of the predeſtinate? and how
much more ſo the more he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from ſuch a perſuaſion?
Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as I have all poſſible reaſon to believe that there are
myriads of men of learning and probity who behold thoſe two doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines in a
quite different light, and not only hold them as neceſſary articles of
their faith, but are ready to condemn all that do not, why ſhould I be ſo
partial to my own judgment, as to think it more infallible than theirs, or
venture to paſs the ſame uncharitable ſentence on them for believing
which I blame them in my conſcience for <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0401000300:46"/> pronouncing
againſt me for not believing them?</p>
            <p>With what juſtice can I charge the former with idolatry for
worſhipping what they ſincerely believe to be the real body of our divine
and adorable Redeemer? Or how can I tax the latter with impiety for
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing a doctrine, which I ought in charity to think they would abhor,
did it appear to them as derogatory of God's goodneſs and juſtice, as it
doth to me, eſpecially as the belief of both is founded on their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
belief, (and conſequently, and at the worſt, on a miſtaken
interpretation) of the Holy Scripture?</p>
            <p>Is it not therefore more ſafe and more chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian for me to
content myſelf with giving my reaſons in the ſtrongeſt manner I am
able, for my diſſent from them, than to charge them, even in thought, with
wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perverting the word of God, and with all the guilt and infamy of
impoſing damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able errors, under pain of damnation? It may be indeed truly
ſaid, that this kind of retaliation is what not only reigns too much in
moſt chriſtian churches, even to this day, but hath proved the frequent
occaſion <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0401000300:47"/> of the moſt horrid perſecutions and
anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian cruelties: But is it not therefore the more to be avoided and
abhorred by all true Chriſtians for the miſchief it hath done, and is
ſtill able to do, to the Goſpel, and for the ſcandal it reflects on the
beſt religion in the world?</p>
            <p>Ought it not to be a matter of the deepeſt grief and concern to
a good Chriſtian, to ſee the moſt gracious deſigns of heaven to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
mankind thus miſerably obſtructed and fruſtrated, and ſo great a part
of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind deprived of the ineſtimable benefits of it, by an untimely zeal,
the moſt oppoſite to the ſpirit of our meek and divine Redeemer, and the
moſt condemned, both by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and example? Doth not right reaſon
itſelf, as well as our natural ſelf-love, tell every man how careful he
ought to be not to be miſtaken in a matter of ſuch infinite concern? And
ſuppoſe we have ever ſo much reaſon to think thoſe that differ from
us are really ſo, muſt we therefore take upon us to cenſure and condemn,
to anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize and perſecute them, whom reaſon and charity ſhould
rather incline us to pity and pray for, whether their error be wilful or 
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0401000300:48"/> involuntary, which can only be known to God?</p>
            <p>I have choſen to inſtance in the doctrines of
tranſubſtantiation and predeſtination, as they appear the moſt
ſhocking and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural to every one, except thoſe who believe them;
nevertheleſs, from a ſenſe of my fallibility, as well as of the
weakneſs of human reaſon, I ſhould be very fearful of pronouncing them
abſolutely falſe (much leſs to call them anti-chriſtian, damnable,
&amp;c.) their appearing ſo to me is a ſufficient reaſon for my declaring
my diſſent from them, but doth not authorize me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce thoſe that
believe them to be guilty before God for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>Were I to indulge myſelf in the liberty of cenſuring or
condemning any chriſtian church, for any thing either in their faith or
practice, it would be that uncharitable authority they aſſume of
condemning, as hereticks, &amp;c. all thoſe who cannot believe as they
do.</p>
            <p>And yet I own it highly neceſſary that there ſhould be, in
every particular church (ſince it is not given to us in this imperfect
ſtate to be thus happily united in our belief) <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0401000300:49"/> a
ſtated rule of faith, a ſummary of what is to be principally believed and
practiſed by all its members; but then care ſhould be taken not to multiply
thoſe articles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what is abſolutely neceſſary, nor yet to
impoſe them with any ſuch damnatory clauſes againſt recuſants as are
commonly uſed by moſt churches, to the great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcredit of
Chriſtianity, and the intimidating and bewildering the ſincere and
well-meaning Chriſtians, who are inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of judging of the merit of
thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, and being commonly by far the moſt numerous, are
entitled to a more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and tender regard than to be obliged blindly to
believe and act as their church preſcribes, or be liable to be reſcinded
from it.</p>
            <p>Even in thoſe articles wherein our church is obliged to declare
its diſſent from any of the tenets of others, methinks they might and
ſhould in charity content themſelves with giving their reaſons, in the
plaineſt and conciſeſt manner, for their diſſent, and with ſuch
impartial candor and tenderneſs as ſhould rather inſpire its members with
pity and concern for, than prejudice and <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0401000300:50"/> hatred againſt,
thoſe that differ from them: and, above all things, they ſhould all be
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly fearful of charging their antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, and their tenets, with a
greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of guilt and danger than is conſiſtent with truth, and with
that ſpirit which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns and abhors all miſrepreſentation and
opprobrious language as the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, next to ill offices or
perſecution, of all errors that a Chriſtian can fall into.</p>
            <p>It is plainly the want of this meek chriſtian ſpirit, that
makes men to intermix ſo much deadly acrimony in all their diſputes and
differences, as ſerves only to deſtroy the ſmall ſparks of charity that
are left among us. But where the love of Chriſt unites our hearts in the
bonds of peace and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual benevolence, no difference in religion, however
greatly miſrepreſented or aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by untimely zeal, will ever be able
to diſſolve the tye, or create the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement or indifference
in their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>There are many things in the Greek, and Roman church, in that of
Geneva, and Augſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, &amp;c. which my conſcience will not permit me to
join with; but which I, at <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0401000300:51"/> the ſame time, firmly hope
and believe will not be laid to their charge by the merciful ſearcher of all
hearts, who rather pities than puniſhes the involuntary errors of his frail
creatures: and were there none better to be found in the chriſtan world than
thoſe, I ſhould think myſelf obliged to join com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with that which
appeared to me the freeſt from them, rather than to ſtand by myſelf, and
be deprived of the benefit of church-fellowſhip, provided nothing was
impoſed upon me by it that my conſcience thought ſinful. I look upon them
all (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſuch as deny the fundamental arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Chriſtianity,
eſpecially the merits and mediation of our divine Redeemer) as ſo many
branches of Chriſt's church; and tho' ſome are more corrupted than others,
yet all united into one body, of which he himſelf is the ſupreme head and
governor, and is acknowledged by them as ſuch.</p>
            <p>However, I own that the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land hath, in all
reſpects, appeared to me, ever ſince I have made myſelf more
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly acquainted with its faith and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, the beſt reformed and
freeſt from every thing that could reſtrain me from her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, 
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0401000300:52"/> eſpecially as I am a layman: for with reſpect to her
clergy, I think ſome of the injunctions ſhe lays them under to be ſuch as
I could by no means ſubmit to, and which the more conſcientious among them
would, I believe, be glad to be freed from, if it could be done
conſiſtently with the honour, and ſafety of its eſtabliſhment. I am
far from intending by this to caſt any blemiſh on the reverend order, or on
the firſt reformers; but as it hath given ſo much occaſion for cavil and
diſreſpectful reflections againſt both, I could heartily wiſh to ſee
it effectually removed. In other reſpects I have long ſince had a vaſt
eſteem and regard for her liturgy, ſacraments, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and other
ordinances, that it hath been, and is ſtill, a matter of regret to me,
whenever buſineſs or any other impediment hath deprived me of the benefit
of them.</p>
            <p>Her epiſcopacy, though ſo much diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by other
proteſtant churches, and cried down, as invalid, by that of Rome, hath long
ago been looked upon by me, not only as a ſingular bleſſing, but as a
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſtituent of a church, the divine inſtitution of which
hath been, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0401000300:53"/> as fully proved againſt the
former, as the validity of its ordination hath againſt the latter; and all I
have to wiſh for her ſake, is, that ſhe was as happy in the choice,
appointment, and promotion of her prelates; and that the Congès Delire
were ſomething more than a phraſe without meaning: however, that needs not
to debar us, in this imperfect ſtate, from enjoying the benefits of their
ſacred function to very good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; nor diſcourage us from wiſhing
and praying for a reformation of thoſe abuſes which worldly politicians
have introduced into it.</p>
            <p>Moſt people indeed, who look upon the evil to lie in human
nature itſelf, have little hopes to ſee any amendment to it, till we have a
new heaven and a new earth, eſpecially as thoſe in whoſe power the remedy
is, are moſt intereſted to ſuppreſs it: But a good Chriſtian will
look higher up than thoſe at the helm for ſo deſirable a change, ſince,
as I believe, we have much more reaſon to hope for it from the
interpoſition of heaven, than any of the neighbouring churches which labour
under the ſame difficulties. As for thoſe countries abroad, which have
ſecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0401000300:54"/> their biſhopricks, &amp;c. they will
hardly charge our church with abuſing hers worſe than they have done
theirs; ſo that, upon the whole, it appears in all reſpects to ſtand upon
a better and more hopeful foot than any other I know, with all its
imperfections and defects.</p>
            <p>I cannot diſmiſs this point without taking ſome notice of a
charge which ſome of our preſent Methodiſts have laid to it, viz. its
having departed from ſome of its ancient doctrines, particularly thoſe of
predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and free-grace, or imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. With reſpect
to the former, it doth not appear that the compilers of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth
article ever deſigned to impoſe the belief of it as neceſſary to
ſalvation, but only to define the term of predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as
ſtrenuouſly maintained by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed churches of Geneva, Switzerland,
Holland, &amp;c. leaving it to the option of every one either to aſſent or
diſſent from it: much leſs do they ſeem to have inſiſted upon the
belief of it in that full and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſenſe (and including abſolute
reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) in which the Supralapſarians explain it, which doctrine is now
juſtly rejected by <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0401000300:55"/> moſt divines and members of this
church. Mr. Whitefield's charge of innovation is therefore unjuſt; and it is
well known, that he did not think otherwiſe of it, till he was perſuaded
into that opinion upon his going to preach in America: however, could it be
ſuppoſed that the firſt reformers really deſigned it in that
ſupralapſarian ſenſe, I ſhould have commended any ſynod who
ſhould have ſince then ordered it to have been erazed, ſeeing the truth
of a chriſtian doctrine is not founded on the opinion or authority of any
men, but on the evidence of Holy Writ.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the other charge, viz. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent and imputed
righteouſneſs, it muſt be owned, that our ſermons and books of devotion
ſeem rather to run ſo much in commendation of good works, as to lead people
to lay a greater ſtreſs on the former than on the latter, and to confide
more on their good deeds than on the merits of Chriſt, which is certainly a
dangerous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, ſince our hope of acceptance and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation muſt be
chiefly founded upon the latter, without which our beſt duties could never be
acceptable from ſuch frail and <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0401000300:56"/> ſinful creatures to a
God of infinite holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>It were therefore to be wiſhed, that our preachers and divines
would take ſome more care to caution their hearers and readers, whenever they
inſiſt on the neceſſity of good works, againſt their putting their
chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on them, and to remind them that the alone merits and
interceſſion of our divine Redeemer can give them their ſaving efficacy.
But though this laſt point is not ſo frequently inculcated and inſiſted
upon as could be wiſhed, yet that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways underſtood and implied, is
certain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it always was, and is ſtill acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be a
fundamental article of the church of England; ſo that it is unjuſt to
charge it with having departed from it; and yet this is the common cry of
theſe modern enthuſiaſts, who are every where denouncing damnation
againſt all thoſe who inſiſt on or put any dependence on inherent
righteouſneſs: but how unjuſtly and falſely, let the apoſtle St. Paul
inform them, who expreſly tells us (1 Corinth. iii. 11-15.) that ſuch
men ſhall be ſaved, though with great difficulty; or, as he expreſſes
it, ſo <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0401000300:57"/> as by fire, though not one of their works
ſhould ſtand the fiery trial; for how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious ſoever the
ſuperſtructure be, whilſt Chriſt is the foundation, he cannot but be
ſafe that builds his hopes upon it, whatever ſtraw, ſtubble, or other
traſh he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix with it.</p>
            <p>However, I do not doubt but this falſe alarm of the Methodiſts
hath proved of ſome uſe to many Chriſtians, as I own it hath to me, and
hath awakened them into a better and humbler opinion of their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
righteouſneſs, than they perhaps had before. As to my own particular, tho'
I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways depended ſolely on the merits of a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Redeemer for pardon
and acceptance, and looked upon all our beſt ſervices to be deſtitute of
the leaſt worth, but what they receive from him; yet I have been warned, by
this late outcry, to put leſs ſtreſs and confidence in them, and to look
upon them rather as the evidence of our ſincerity and ſalvation, than as
the means or foundation of it, rather as our qualification for heaven (on which
account we may ſafely wiſh, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and pray that we may more and more
abound in them) than as things ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0401000300:58"/> to give us any
title to it, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can do but the imputed righteouſneſs of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought incumbent on me to declare concerning my
notions of religion in general, of the church of England in particular, and my
reaſon for preferring her communion to all other. I hope they are all
agreeable to the word of God, and that I have taken all poſſible care and
pains to have them chiefly founded on that, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reading and
conſulting the ſacred volumes in their original, and uſing all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
helps, as commentators, paraphraſts, books of controverſy, &amp;c. in order
to come at their true meaning. But above all, my chief dependence hath been
upon the guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and aſſiſtance of God's Holy Spirit, which, for a
great number of years, I have never failed daily to implore, as I was truly
ſenſible, how poor and inſignificant all other helps would be without it,
towards the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us through the vaſt mazes of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, which
reign all over Chriſtendom, to the wiſhed-for haven and ſalvation, to
which I earneſtly pray to God to bring every ſincere ſoul, that longs and
ſtrives for <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0401000300:59"/> it. I firmly rely on the ſame divine
good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to whom I owe ſo many mercies, and ſo wonderful a change, that
if there be yet any thing erroneous or amiſs, either in my belief and
practice, he will, in his own time, and by his all-ſufficient light and
grace, enable me to rectify it, that I may have nothing left to do but to
acknowledge and adore his infinite and undeſerved mercies to me, and
particularly for having enabled me to ſee ſo much of my own weakneſs and
inſufficiency, unworthineſs and miſery, as to put my whole truſt and
confidence in his all-powerful grace and unbounded goodneſs, through the
infinite merits of our bleſſed Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude this Preface, it will be likewiſe
neceſſary for me to give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that vaſt quantity of
laudanum I have been known to take for above theſe forty years, and my
motives for ſo doing, in order to undeceive ſuch perſons as may have
conceived too favourable an opinion of that dangerous drug, from any thing they
may have heard me ſay, heard at ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, or may have obſerved of the
ſmall <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0401000300:60"/> viſible hurt I have received from it, during
ſo long and conſtant a uſe of it.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all, as to the true occaſion of my taking it,
whatever pretence I may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore have made for it, ſuch as its eaſing
the pain of the gout, (which diſtemper, though I heretofore pretended to be
often troubled with, yet I never was, nor had the leaſt ſymptom or tendency
to in my conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution) or of its being a great help to ſtudy, a reviver of
the ſpirits, and the like, which qualities it in ſome meaſure hath; yet
my motive for taking it at firſt, and continuing it ſo long, was no other
than my vanity and ſenſeleſs affectation of ſingularity; and as that
was then my predominant paſſion, ſo I indulged it in this and many other
ſuch extravagant ways, at any hazard, as the following ſheets will more
fully ſhew.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as to the quantity, though it never came up to that
vaſt exceſs as I did then pretend; yet I own that I frequently took ſuch
large doſes, by way of oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as muſt have proved detrimental, if
not quite fatal, to any man that had had a leſs ſtrong and happy
conſtitution than I was bleſſed with; and I have been very 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0401000300:61"/> often ſurpriſed to find that I received ſo little
prejudice from it. And this it was that emboldened me to take ſuch large and
dangerous draughts of it, without the leaſt neceſſity or motive for it,
but to be taken notice and talked of; inſomuch that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued it during
ſuch a number of years, that I was become a perfect ſlave to, and could not
be eaſy without it, tho' I had for ſome time been ſenſible of the ill
conſequences attending the conſtant uſe of it, eſpecially as often as I
indulged my vanity with a larger doſe than uſual.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As to my vain pretence of having found an effectual way
of ſtripping the opium of all its pernicious qualities, though it was true in
part, and I had fallen upon a preparation of it (which was a kind of ſafe and
uſeful improvement on that which Dr. Jones gives us in his MYSTERY OF OPIUM)
by the help of ſome acids, particularly the juice of Seville oranges, which,
mixed with ſome alcalies, raiſed a kind of ferment in the infuſion, by
which ſome of the moſt viſcous and narcotic parts were either ſcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
off, or made to ſubſide; yet ſo far was it from being ſo inoffenſive
and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0401000300:62"/> as I gave it out, that I had frequent
occaſion to obſerve ſome of its ill effects in thoſe whom I
unadviſedly perſuaded to uſe it in ſome proper caſes, as I thought,
ſo that I was obliged to leave off preſcribing it to others; though, as to
myſelf, I was a long while before I found any inconvenience in taking it,
even in that large quantity; and I have great reaſon ſtill to think it
leſs dangerous by far than either that of Dr. Sydenham's, or any infuſion
exhibited by the apothecaries and common diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
            <p>However, when I began to feel the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient effects of it,
which was not till a good number of years uſing it, I thought it high time to
leſſen the uſual doſe (which was then about ten or twelve tea
ſpoonfuls morning and night, and very often more) as faſt as I conveniently
could, and in about ſix month's time had reduced myſelf to half an ounce
per day, and ſomewhat weaker than the common Sydenham. I ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
decreaſing; but ſuch was my fooliſh vanity, that, to conceal my
reduction, I added ſome other bitter tincture, eſpecially that of
hierapicra, or ſome other ſuch corrective, <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0401000300:63"/> among it,
to appear as ſtill taking my uſual quantity.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, I found that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, gradual as it
was, could not be continued without ſome affecting and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
inconveniences; ſuch as a great laſſitude and uneaſineſs of the mind,
an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence and incapacity for ſtudy, a diſlike to every thing I read or
wrote, to ſolitude and application; all which made me apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, that
if I did not ſlacken it, and go more warily on with it, I might bring
myſelf into a greater evil than that which I endeavoured to ſhun, and fling
myſelf at length into a kind of habitual torpor and inactivity, which might
prove at leaſt as detrimental to me: to prevent which, I was forced to take a
new method, and to inlarge or leſſen my doſe, according to the ſtate of
health I was in, ſometimes according as the weather was more or leſs
enlivening, or according as the courſe of my ſtudies required a greater or
leſſer degree of application. All this, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was rather owing to my
own natural indolence and want of reſolution to go on in ſpight of all
thoſe inconveniences, than to any danger there really was in the 
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0401000300:64"/> caſe, as I happily found reaſon afterwards to think;
for when the Divine Providence was pleaſed to bleſs me with a contrary turn
of mind, and to make me deteſt and abhor all my former follies, and this
among the reſt, to ſuch a degree, as to reſolve, by his aſſiſtance,
upon a thorough change, I then found both the taſk, and all the
inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences attending it, to grow more and more eaſy; and as this
reſolution was founded upon a much better principle than my former ones were,
ſo it was attended with ſuch a bleſſing at my laſt ſtay at Oxford,
anno — from July to the latter end of September, by which time I had made
a conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in my reduction, that I had quite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted the
conqueſt, and lived ſome weeks there without taking one drop, or even
wiſhing for it, although neither then nor ſince was I without ſome
employment which required a pretty cloſe application.</p>
            <p>In this pleaſing ſtate, as I juſtly thought it, I continued
for ſome months, when the ſeverity of the enſuing winter overturned all
my meaſures, and forced me, though much againſt my will, to have recourſe
to it again: neither could I think of any ſafer or <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0401000300:65"/> more
effectual remedy againſt that chilneſs of my blood, and lowneſs of
ſpirits, which I laboured under through the exceſſive cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the
ſeaſon. I reſolved, however, to reſume it in the ſmalleſt quantity
that I could find would anſwer my end; that is, what was, as near as I could
judge, equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to ten or twelve drops of Sydenham's, and with full
intention to leave it off as ſoon as the warm weather returned, and had
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly reduced myſelf to about half that quantity, though not without
ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, on account of a work I was ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in, and the
neceſſity we were under to keep time with the printers and publiſhers.
Finding it at length ſo neceſſary and pleaſant, as well as ſafe and
harmleſs, I reſolved to continue it, and have done ſo to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
time; that is, for ſeven or eight years, without the leaſt inconvenience
from it. On the contrary, I have reaſon to think that even that ſmall
quantity, though ſcarce equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to twelve drops of Sydenham's, hath been
of ſome ſervice to me to prevent that decay of ſpirits which old age,
(being now drawing near my ſeventieth) a ſedentary life, and cloſe
ſtudy, might otherwiſe proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0401000300:66"/> have brought upon me:
and it is to this ſmall doſe, which I take every night in a pint of very
ſmall punch, as ſoon as I leave off writing, that I attribute, next to the
bleſſing of God, that good ſhare of health I have hitherto enjoyed, and
my having been able, for ſo many years, to go through the fatigues and
applications of ſtudy, from ſeven in the morning to ſeven at night,
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſtill a good appetite and digeſtion, a clear head, and
tolerable flow of ſpirits, and enjoying a ſound ſleep of ſix or ſeven
hours, without indulging myſelf in any other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors than tea all the day,
and the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned quantity of punch, or ſomething equivalent to it at
night; and as I have not opportunity for much exerciſe, I take care to live
on the plaineſt diet at noon, and to obſerve the old adage at night,

            <head>MEMOIRS, OF GEORGE PSALMANAZAR.</head>
            <p>I cannot better begin this melancholy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my former life,
vile and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable as it hath been, and blended with ſuch mixture of the
moſt unaccountable pride, folly, and ſtupid villainy, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to
reaſon, religion, and all checks of conſcience, till almoſt to the
thirtieth year of my age, than by humbly acknowledging the infinite mercy of
God, not only in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving me ſo long from the many evils and
diſaſters which my own wicked raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt elſe unavoidably have
precipitated me into, as the ſequel will ſufficiently ſhow; but much more
ſo in that gradual and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible change which his grace wrought in me, by
enabling me frequently to retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect with ſhame and remorſe on a life
ſo baſely ſpent, to ſend up the moſt fervent wiſhes to heaven that
I might at length break off from ſo ſhameful and wicked a courſe of the
vileſt and moſt ſcandalous <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0401000300:68"/> impoſture, that a wild
and abandoned youth could be guilty of, and that I might but be bleſſed
with ſuch a ſteady reſolution as at once publickly to diſclaim all the
lies and forgeries I had formerly publiſhed in that monſtrous romance, and
at any rate or risk to take the ſhame to my ſelf, and make a free
confeſſion of the whole impoſture. But I had not only my pride to combat,
but the diſpleaſure which ſuch a declaration would give to all my
friends, who being very honeſt and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, could not but have taken it
much at heart, and, perhaps, been expoſed to the cenſure of the world for
their charitable opinion of me; to ſay nothing of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence they muſt
have conceived-againſt ſo deteſtable a cheat. As theſe therefore were
ſuch powerful determents to a man wholly deſtitute of any laudable way of
living, I could not expect that my earneſt wiſhes would be ſpeedily
anſwered; and my only hope was, that the ſame gracious God, who had thus
effectually awaked me to a ſenſe of my guilt and danger, would alſo in
his own time hear thoſe prayers which himſelf had inſpired me to make, 
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0401000300:69"/> eſpecially, as upon a retroſpection of my paſt
follies, I was apt to comfort myſelf with the thoughts, that the violence of
my favourite paſſion, pride, could never have hurried me ſo
irreſiſtibly through ſuch ſcenes of folly and danger, if there had not
been ſome ſad flaw in my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome unavoidable degree of
madneſs in my temper, which might in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure extenuate, if not
wholly excuſe, the atrocious guilt it had involved me in; and the hope that
it might ſtill be placed to that account, by a merciful Judge of all our
thoughts and intents, of our frail and corrupt nature, joined to the
ſtedfaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence I had in the promiſes of the Goſpel, and in the
infinite merits of a divine Saviour, preſerved me from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing of mercy
and pardon, of ſucceſs and bleſſing on thoſe happy beginnings, if
cloſely and earneſtly purſued.</p>
            <p>But as ſuch a hope, without a ſincere deſire of doing one's
part, to the beſt of one's power, and according to the degree of
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance given from above, would rather deſerve the name of raſh
and ſhameful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0401000300:70"/> ſo the next ſtep I
took, at leaſt in view, was to ſet about making all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
reparation to God and his church, and to the world, and my own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
for the ſcandal which ſuch a vile piece of hypocriſy muſt have given to
all, eſpecially to good men, and in ſpite of all reluctance from pride and
ſelf-love, which the greater it was, would the more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lead one to
the throne of mercy for a proportionable ſupply of Divine grace, and
patiently to wait for it in God's own proper time. I had not continued many
months in this hopeful diſpoſition, before I perceived all thoſe
difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to vaniſh by degrees, but more
eſpecially at the approach of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere diſeaſe, though lingering, and
the apprehenſions of death, which laſt, as it did not appear to be ſo
near at hand, gave me room to hope I might have time ſufficient granted me in
mercy, to go through this faithful narrative, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the world; ſo
that if the Divine Providence did think fit to drive me to the writing of it by
his afflicting hand, I hope it will rather add weight to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0401000300:71"/> of it, ſeeing no time is fitter than this to inſpire a
man with the deepeſt ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſincerity. But as to me, I
ſtill more rely on the aſſiſtance of that ſpirit of truth, to whoſe
ſpecial grace I am bound to aſcribe the abhorring ſenſe I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
conceived againſt my former guilt, as well as the earneſt deſire and
reſolution of tranſmitting to the world ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my paſt
guilty life, as might wholly contradict and explode that falſe and impious
one, which I had been induced to publiſh in the days of my abominable folly
and vanity. Under that Divine Guide therefore I ſet myſelf immediately
about it, and carried on daily, and with as much application as my diſeaſe
(a very violent ague and fever) would permit, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the ſincerity
which I reſolved, by God's aſſiſtance, ſhould reign through the
whole, would make ſome amends for the lowneſs of ſtile, and other
imperfections, which, conſidering my weakly condition both of mind and body,
were in ſome meaſure unavoidable. Thus far I thought neceſſary to
appriſe the reader concerning the (happy, I hope I have reaſon to call 
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0401000300:72"/> it) occaſion of my writing the following account, which
in the name, and under the direction of that ſame God of truth, I now hope to
live to ſee finiſhed, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be printed, if thought worthy of it,
after my death; and I ſhall only add, that I am at this preſent time of
writing (April 22, 1728) at a friend's houſe in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, free from all
ſtudy and buſineſs, or any other impediment, but what is cauſed by my
diſtemper, and ſhall dedicate all the time I have to ſpare in the writing
of it.</p>
            <p>But here I hope I ſhall be excuſed from giving an account
either of my real country or family, or any thing that might caſt a
reflection upon either, it being but too common, though unjuſt, to cenſure
them for the crimes of private perſons, for which reaſon I think myſelf
obliged, out of reſpect to them, to conceal both. Out of Europe I was not
born, nor educated, nor ever travelled; but continued in ſome of the
ſouthern parts of it till about the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of my age, when
neceſſity obliged me in ſome meaſure to remove into more northern ones,
though never farther northward than the Rhine in Germany, <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0401000300:73"/>
or Yorkſhire in England. And this I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely mention, becauſe I have
been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſuſpected to be a German, Swede or Dane by ſome; by
others, an Engliſh or Scotchman, as their fancy lead them, though I never
ſaw Germany till I was ſixteen, nor England till about two or three years
after. As for my parents and relations they were Roman Catholics, and moſt of
them very zealous in their way, and ſtrongly biaſſed againſt all
Proteſtants. My father was of an ancient, but decayed family, and had been
obliged to leave my mother before I was five years old, and to live near five
hundred miles from her, whilſt ſhe was left to live and breed me up upon
her ſmall fortune, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any aſſiſtance from him, his
miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes having put it quite out of his power to contribute any thing;
ſo that I was wholly left to her care. However, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that, nor the
narrowneſs of her cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, hindered her from giving me the beſt
education ſhe could, being then her only ſurviving child. She was a pious
good woman in her way, and though I was no ſmall favourite of hers, was yet 
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0401000300:74"/> kept with due ſtrictneſs whilſt I ſtaid with her,
which was however but a ſhort time, and do not remember that I had then any
the leaſt vicious inclination, nor in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood might have had, had I
ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued under her wing; whereas through the miſmanagement of
thoſe firſt perſons to whoſe tuition I was next committed, ſuch a
wrong foundation was laid, and ſo ſtrong a biaſs given me to vanity and
ſelf-conceit, as proved the unhappy ſource of all my ſad miſcarriages
ſince.</p>
            <p>One general remark here I cannot avoid making concerning the
ſchools of the Roman Catholics, viz. that all their ſtudents muſt learn
to read, and even pray, in Latin, before they are capable of underſtanding
one word of it; for this doth but inure them to read and pray without any
atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even when they are afterwards capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of underſtanding what they
read and pray for. This ill-timed method had been complained of by many a one
who have ſince felt the ſad effects of it, as well as the almoſt
inſurmountable difficulty of maſtering a defect ſo early contracted and
ſo deeply rooted, as it were, in our nature, <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0401000300:75"/> and none
hath had more reaſon to bewail it than I.</p>
            <p>But what did me in particular the moſt hurt, in my education
abroad, was the great admiration which my more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon readineſs at
learning whatever came in my way had gained me, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent fondneſs
and partiality which my maſters ſhewed to me on that account. I was hardly
turned of ſix years when I was ſent to a free-ſchool taught by two
Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can monks, the eldeſt of whom perceiving my uncommon genius for
languages, for till then I had only learned to read all ſorts of print and
writings, and was beſides very careleſs about writing a tolerable hand,
took it into his head to put me to the Latin form, though my mother and all my
friends thought me much too young for it, eſpecially as I was to be ranked
and claſſed among other boys of twice my years, and who had already been at
it a year or two, and ſome more; however he depended ſo much on his
judgment, about my genius and application, that he doubted not, he ſaid, but
to ſee me out-top all the reſt in leſs than a year or two.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0401000300:76"/>He was not miſtaken, and though it put me to
great difficulties and hard ſtudy to reach them, I began to feel ſuch
emotions of vanity at the quick progreſs I made, and the commendations he
gave me upon it, that I reſted not ſatisfied till I had gained the firſt
rank in the form, as well as in his affection, for as he ſpared nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
careſſes nor encouragement to me, I ſoon became ſenſible both by his
behaviour, as well as by the deference which the other boys paid to me, how
much I was got in his favour.</p>
            <p>Our ſchool was often viſited by prieſts, monks, gentlemen,
and other perſons that paſſed through our city, and though we had in it
ſeveral boys whoſe parents were in a much higher ſtation, yet I was
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſingled out as the flower of the flock, and as the moſt ready to
anſwer ſuch queſtions as were ſuitable to our form. Our monk had
likewiſe, by way of animating us, cauſed ſome curious nicknacks to be
made by the nuns of a neighbouring mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, which they were to wear
hanging to their button-holes, by a fine ribon, who held the firſt ſeats.
Theſe were of ſeveral <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0401000300:77"/> ſizes, and one of them much
larger than the reſt was for the foremoſt in rank. We were to be entitled
to theſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our merit, and this laſt fell to my lot from the
firſt exerciſe, and ſo proud was I become of this bauble, that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
loſt it for one ſingle day; for I had ſuch a ready and retentive memory,
and quick apprehenſion, as by the help of a moderate application, made it
impoſſible for my ſchool-fellows to wreſt it from me. This mark of
diſtinction did moreover en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title me to be head monitor and marſhal of that
whole ſchool. All which filled me with ſuch vanity and ambition to excel,
that I could not brook any ſuperiority or preference, and our monk was but
too fond of indulging, and even encouraging me in it, though to my no ſmall
detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he might eaſily perceive that it had given me ſuch a
ſtrong bias to pride, as a prudent man would have rather choſen to nip in
the bud, eſpecially as he eaſily perceived that it created no ſmall envy
in my ſchool-fellows, and a kind of diſſatisfaction in ſome of their
parents and relations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0401000300:78"/>He tried once indeed to thwart his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
to me, by giving our form a new kind of exerciſe, the price of which to the
beſt performer was to be a fine piece of nun's work, which he adjudged to
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, whom all the ſchool knew to be a dunce, but in point of quality the
head of us all. Had he given it to ſome others of our form, who were greater
proficients in learning, I might have thought they had ſucceeded better in
their performance than I at that time; and though it would have been a great
mortification to me, it might have only made me double my diligence; but here
the preference was ſo flagrant and viſible, that I could not forbear
expreſſing a deſire to know wherein he had outdone me, and a
ſuſpicion that he had been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted underhand by ſome monk or
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body elſe. When the good father found that I took the matter ſo to
heart, and, in ſome meaſure, threaten to bid adieu, if not to the Latin, at
leaſt to his ſchool; (and I believe I ſhould really have done it, ſo
highly I reſented what I called the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice done me) he thought fit to
pacify me by aſſuring me, that my competitor <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0401000300:79"/> had, upon
this occaſion, ſo far excelled himſelf, that he could not forbear
aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the prize by way of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though my performance
was far enough from being inferior to his; and ſo, to put an end to the
contention, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſent for another piece of the ſame curious work,
and gave it to me, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome great encomium on my uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diligence
and progreſs, and other to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of his ſingular regard, which ſent me
home ſo ſatisfied and full of myſelf, that, alas for me! every thing
ſeemed to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to ſwell my growing pride, and make me forget
myſelf.</p>
            <p>Many other ſuch inſtances of his partial fondneſs I could
name, which all tended to make me ſtill more aſſuming and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant; one
however I cannot paſs by, which ſhall ſerve as a ſpecimen: as I never
was guilty of a fault at ſchool, ſo let me do what I would out of it, I was
never pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for it, as the other boys were, but had, perhaps, a ſoft
reprimand or ſome eaſy taſk aſſigned me by way of penance, for I
cannot call to mind that I ever had a blow or croſs word from him. One day 
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0401000300:80"/> in particular, ſome ſtrangers, who viſited us after
dinner, obtained us a diſcharge for the reſt of the day. We were no
ſooner got out but I told my ſchool-fellows, that we ought to go and
procure the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe to the girls of another ſchool. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we
went and broke into the houſe, and drove the miſtreſs and ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
out, and then locked the doors, that they might not be obliged to come in
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſent her the key at night. On the next day a ſevere complaint
was brought againſt us for the aſſault, and I charged as the ringleader
of the reſt, upon which a ſuitable puniſhment was promiſed, and ſoon
after put in execution, in which I not only expected to have a ſhare, but to
be the firſt called down to it, and yet by what partial motive I know not, I
had no other puniſhment than a ſeeming ſevere reprimand, and ſome
eaſy task, whilſt all the reſt were forced to ſubmit to the
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline of the ſchool. This partiality they loudly complained of, not
only to him, but to their friends; but their reſentment upon it only gave me
new matter for triumph, as it did to them new cauſe for envy, 
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0401000300:81"/> which yet they dared not vent in any other way than
words.</p>
            <p>Thus I went on learning of Latin apace, I could tranſlate out of
it, write and ſpeak it with great readineſs, as far as I had been taught,
which was thought ſurpriſing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering I had hardly attained my ninth
year, and been but two years under his care. The misfortune was, that he made
us only converſant with common ſchool-books, and but with few of any of the
old claſſics either in proſe or verſe, ſo that I was quite
unacquainted with their ſtile till I came into better hands, as I ſoon
after did; for our good father being ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter choſen head, or, as
they ſtile it, guardian of another convent, about twenty-four miles from
this, and in an archiepiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal city, where was alſo a college of Jeſuits
for the education of youth, he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily prevailed upon my mother to let me go
with him thither, and to board at the monaſtery under his eye, whilſt I
went on with my ſtudies at the college, where he alſo promiſed to
recommend me to the care of thoſe fathers. He likewiſe promiſed her that
he would, in the evening, make <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0401000300:82"/> me repeat and explain what
I had learned in the day, and by that means puſh me ſo forward in my
learning that I ſhould out-top all my age, all which proved ſuch powerful
perſuaſives to my mother, that ſhe eaſily agreed to it, eſpecially as
he took four or five more youths with him to be on the ſame foot with me both
at the college and in the convent. We ſet out accordingly with him for the
place, and when I was introduced into the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits college, there was no
ſmall ſtrife what claſs I ſhould be admitted into at firſt. Here it
will be neceſſary to acquaint the reader that the Jeſuits diſtinguiſh
their forms, or, as they more properly ſtile them, claſſes, each of them
being kept in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate apartment, as follows, viz. 
<list>
                  <item>1. The vith, or loweſt, where they begin to learn the
Latin Grammar.</item>
                  <item> 2. vth, where they perfect themſelves in that, and begin
to learn ſome Latin books, and to make ſome wretched Latin.</item>
                  <item> 3. ivth, where they read Tacitus, Cicero's Epiſtles,
Ovid, and ſome other eaſy Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0401000300:83"/> authors, and begin to
make better Latin.</item>
                  <item> 4. iiid, where they read Curtius, Cicero's ſpeeches,
Virgil, and make pretty good Latin, and learn to make Latin verſes. They
likewiſe begin here to learn the Greek Grammar.</item>
                  <item> 5. Humanity. In this claſs they read Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, Cicero,
Terence, make good verſes, and compoſe ſome ſet ſpeeches on a
ſubject given, and if they have a genius for it, make ſome conſiderable
progreſs in the Greek tongue, though they only read ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the fathers,
and make verſions out of Latin into Greek. They likewiſe make ſome ſet
ſpeeches, or poetical works, before a full audience.</item>
                  <item> 6. Rhetoric. Here Homer and other Greek poets,
Demoſthenes and other Greek authors, are read; together with Cicero de
Oratore, Horace's Satyres, and de Arte poetica. Themes are compoſed on given
ſubjects, as much as can be, in the Ciceronian ſtile and method; and
likewiſe poems in imitation of the Greek and Latin poets, and other books,
compiled by ſome of the ſociety for the uſe of this claſs, as 
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0401000300:84"/> there are others for every claſs elſe, and every
branch of learning that is taught in them, the greateſt part of which is to
be learned by heart by the ſcholars, as well as ſeveral other perſons,
out of the claſſic authors, in order to exerciſe their memory, as is
pretended, but rather ſerves to clog it with a deal of unintelligible
ſtuff, which being ſooner forgot than learned, ſerves to little
purpoſe, except it be to take up ſo much of their time, to the neglect of
more uſeful things, and more adapted to their capacities; to which I may
ſafely add another great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, viz. that theſe leſſons being
to be repeated to the decurions or monitors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the regent comes in, and
an account to be given to him who hath, or who hath not learned them duely, in
order to be commended or reproved, both the ſcholar and the monitor are in
ſuch haſte to go through the drudgery, that thoſe are moſt approved of
who can repeat theirs with the greateſt ſpeed, or rather with
precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by which ſuch an habit is formed of ſpeaking and reading
with ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous quickneſs, as will require a great 
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0401000300:85"/> deal of trouble and pains, to break one's ſelf off
afterwards, if ever it is really rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and this I found long ſince to
my loſs, and no ſmall grief.</item>
                  <item> 7. The laſt is philoſophy, which they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide into
logic, phyſics, metaphyſics, and morality, each of which takes them a
quarter of a year in learning, or, at leaſt, in expounding. Every ſcholar
is obliged to ſpend a year at leaſt in each of the claſſes; and if, at
the year's end, when they are all to be ſeparately examined, any be found
tardy, either through dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or negligence, they are condemned to go
through the ſame ſtudies another year, whilſt the reſt, who are found
worthy, are promoted to the next claſs in rank.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>When I came therefore to be acquainted with the particular
ſtudies and books of each claſs, and came to reflect on my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a
ſtranger to the claſſics, I begged of my old maſter that I might be
offered only as candidate for the third claſs, where they began to be taught,
and this I ſhould have looked upon as a favour, conſidering that it was
then Midſummer, and that I <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0401000300:86"/> was herded as a beginner into
a claſs where the reſt had already ſtudied ſix months; ſo that I
thought I ſhould have ſtill enough to do to overtake them before the year
was out. But the good father would by no means agree to it, but inſiſted
upon my being examined as a candidate to huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. This, I complained, was
putting a double hardſhip upon me, being an utter ſtranger to the every
author that was read in this as well as in the other below it, and having, at
moſt, but ſeven months to maſter them all; he ſo far engaged, though
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my will, for my overcoming all thoſe difficulties by my genius and
application, that I was obliged to undergo the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a candidate for
humanity: and though my repugnance made me leſs ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous how I went
through it, as I was ſo deſirous to be ſent down to the claſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, yet whether the old monk's inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt prevailed, or my own merit gained
it, I was readily admitted into the claſs of humanity, and found it a very
hard tug to keep up my credit under thoſe diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages I laboured under.
I wondered indeed how my old maſter could be guilty <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0401000300:87"/> of
ſuch a neglect, and often preſſed him to give me his aſſiſtance,
which he trying to comply with, gave me but too fair an opportunity of
diſcovering the true cauſe of it, viz. his being as unacquainted with them
as I was. This therefore proved a very difficult claſs to me; and what was
ſtill more diſcouraging to me was, that our regent, ſo they call the
perſon that teaches in every claſs, inſtead of making any kind allowance
for my tender years, for my being entered ſo late, and under ſuch
diſadvantages, often charged me with neglect and indolence, and, in a
jocoſe manner, threatened to leave me <hi>inter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentes,</hi> that is,
inſtead of raiſing to the next claſs, to leave me in this for another
year. And though I was ſenſible that would have been more for my advantage,
yet the ſhame of it was what I could not have brooked; and I thought it a
mortification more than ſufficient to be ranked among the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of
his claſs, who had till then been uſed to be at the head. But this he did
rather to ſpur me on than to diſpirit me, that I might the more eaſily be
admitted into the claſs of rhetoric againſt the time <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0401000300:88"/>
of the yearly examination. This grand ceremony is performed a little before the
Chriſtmas holidays, and when the ſcholars have learned their doom, that is,
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go up or to ſtay in the old claſs, they break up for ten or
twelve days, and go to their reſpective homes. There were at this time four
or five of my own townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys, all of them not only much older, but who had
been at the college ſeveral years before me, and bore a kind of envy
againſt me for being admitted at once into the ſame claſs with them, and
would have been glad to have left me behind in it. This conſideration, joined
to the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſuch a piece of news would have been, not only to my
old maſter, but much more ſo to my mother, made me ſo much the more
diligent againſt the time of trial, and the more eaſily forego the
advantage of another year's humanity: for the pride and pleaſure of keeping
pace with, and following them into rhetoric. Accordingly, I exerted myſelf
ſo well, and gave ſuch ſatisfaction at my examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I was
nominated, as well as they, for that higher claſs. But tho' this 
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0401000300:89"/> gave me no ſmall joy, and made me go home with a lighter
heart, yet I have had ſince ſufficient reaſon to wiſh it had proved
otherwiſe; for our next regent, (the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits cuſtoms is to change them
every year, and to ſend new ones out of other colleges) proved a perſon
every way almoſt unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for that high claſs, ſo that we rather went
backwards than forward under him. He eſſayed at firſt to expound ſome
of the Greek poets and orators by the help of the Latin verſions annexed to
them, in doing which he ſo far betrayed his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of that tongue, that
every one of us ſoon became ſenſible of it, which obliged him to ſet it
quite aſide. He was not much happier in the Latin ones, though better
acquainted with them, and took at length ſuch a diſguſt to the college
method, that he may juſtly be ſaid to have diverted himſelf with teaching
us things quite op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to it, and altogether foreign to our claſs, but
which ſuited his genius better.</p>
            <p>It will not be amiſs to obſerve here, that the three main
qualifications that procure admiſſion into that ſociety, are quality, or
high rank, learning and riches. Our good <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0401000300:90"/> regent was one of
the laſt ſort, being the ſon of an overgrown citizen or tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who
brought money enough into the fraternity to make amends for his want of
learning; and as this college was but an obſcure one, in compariſon to
thoſe which they have in their great univerſities, he might be thought
perhaps good enough to teach here; at leaſt, if he was not fit to do ſo
here, he could be much leſs ſo any where elſe. He complied however ſo
far with the rules of the college, and of our claſs, as to oblige us now and
then to make verſes, themes, verſions, and ſuch low ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes; but I
ſoon found that he did not give himſelf the trouble of looking them over,
or even, for form's ſake, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending or diſcommending our perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
according to their merit. As he was of a facetious temper, he would often ſo
far indulge his vein, as to entertain us for a whole hour with ſtories, which
were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther calculated to improve our minds, nor to make us in love with our
books. At length, quite tired, as he ſeemed, with the drudgery of the
college, he took it into his head to teach us heraldry, geography, and 
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0401000300:91"/> fortification, inſtead of the proper leſſons of our
claſs; ſo that we were forced, in ſome meaſure, to exchange books for
maps, coats of arms, plans of cities, caſtles, &amp;c. and, at length, to
dabble with him in clay and dirt, in order to make a variety of fortifications,
with all their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances and proper colours; and theſe he took no
ſmall pride in ſhewing to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but with this ſalvo, that this
was our and his employment only between the ſchool hours, tho' we were but
too ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they took up likewiſe all our ſchool-time, ſo that
ſome days we did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but that, to the neglect of every other
branch of learning that was proper for our claſs. At length, after having
tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled away near two thirds of the year, to our no ſmall detriment, and to
my great regret, who was ſo far behind-hand in my my learning, I was timely
relieved, as I thought, by a letter from my mother, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming me, that the
rector of a ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Dominicans in our neighbourhood, was going to
teach philoſophy to as many young gentlemen as he could get, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting me
to make one of the number. <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0401000300:92"/> I readily agreed to it, the
convent being but a pleaſant walk out of my native city; and though I found I
muſt take my leave of the claſſics if I went, yet I thought the learning
of philoſophy would be both more creditable and uſeful, than the poor
ſtuff which our Jeſuit taught us; though had I been then as well acquainted
with the ſubtleties of Tho. Aquinas (or rather Ariſtotle, for that is the
philoſophy which the Dominicans teach) as I became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, I doubt
whether I ſhould ever have been one of his diſciples, at leaſt by my
conſent. However, I left the college without any further ceremony, and having
acquainted four or five of our claſs that were my townſboys with my
deſign, they ſoon followed me, and at our coming to the rector, we found
that he had already about twenty more, ſome, from a great univerſity about
ſixty miles off, others, from the neighbouring towns, ſeveral of them mere
dunces and ruſtics, with no other educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than a little ſmattering of
the Latin tongue, and not above five or ſix tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly qualified for the
ſtudy we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in. As for me, whatever my old <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0401000300:93"/>
Franciſcan maſter might depend upon as to the ſtrength of my genius and
cloſeneſs of application, for acquiring theſe branches of learning I was
ſtill wanting in, yet the diſcouragements which I had already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered
through his miſmanagement, in placing me in too high a form, as well as the
time we had trifled away in the claſs of rhetoric, had much abated my
thirſt after learning; and the much greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment I met with
under this new pretended teacher of philoſophy, quite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated my
misfortune, by turning it into a downright careleſſneſs and indifference
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. For tho' I was naturally quick enough, and aſſiduous at whatever
I could gain the maſtery of, and applauſe for ſo doing, yet, whenever the
caſe proved other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, no youth could be more naturally lazy and ſupine
than I; ſo that I cannot but think, on the ſtricteſt recollection I can
make, that theſe many diſcouragements ſo cloſely following one another,
were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cauſe of that deplorable indolence I ſince contracted for
all laudable applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtudy, than my own natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and genius,
which, had it been rightly <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0401000300:94"/> directed and encouraged by
proper motives, and eſpecially if kept under ſome ſtrict diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
might have eaſily been enabled to have overcome the greateſt difficulties
in almoſt every branch of learning: but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our Dominican
rector.</p>
            <p>He began as uſual with logic, and diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a pretty good
talent at explaining it to as many of us as had a genius for it; for as to the
reſt, which were near two-thirds of his ſchool, both he and we could
eaſily perceive that he was only wronging them of their time and money,
though little did I think how ſoon that was to be my caſe: for though I
took his logic with ſuch ſurpriſing quickneſs and delight, as to have
but one competitor, and was become a great favourite of his, by the free and
hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous way in which I uſed to put, now and then, ſome puzzling
queſtions to him; yet when we came to the ſecond branch, which was
Ariſtotle's phyſics, with Aquinas's comments, I found it ſuch an
unintelligible jargon, and him ſo little qualified to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it to us, that
I became quite tired with it; for ſome of us, eſpecially my competitor and
I, expected at leaſt that he <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0401000300:95"/> would have made every point
as clear and evident to us, as he had before in logical lectures, and have
anſwered ſuch objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as we were able to raiſe againſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the
doctrines, or his expoſitions; but, to our great ſurprize, we found that he
had undertaken to expound what himſelf did not underſtand, and that
Aquinas's ſubtilities and diſtinctions were as much above his reach as
above ours. Thus, for inſtance, Ariſtotle's account of the <hi>materia
prima,</hi> together with his ſubtile commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator's expoſitions on it, in
which our rector ſpent above a fortnight, including the rubs we threw into
his way, appeared to us ſuch an unintelligible heap of ſtuff, that, at our
taking leave of it, to paſs to another point, we made ourſelves very merry
about it, and owned ourſelves as much in the dark as when he began it;
inſomuch, that he was forced to own he never could thoroughly comprehend it,
and only delivered it to us on the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that philoſopher, and of his
many eminent diſciples of the Dominican order, ſuch as Albertus Magnus,
Aquinas, &amp;c. &amp;c. I have ſince, upon running over his leſſons 
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0401000300:96"/> more carefully, found reaſon to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a much
abler head than his, would not have been as much at a loſs to have beat it
into any man's brain, that would not be ſatisfied with words without a
meaning. However, as I plainly perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his chief view was to get our
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, without troubling himſelf whether our progreſs was anſwerable, I
contracted by degrees ſuch a habit of indolence and liſtleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to
all he ſaid (eſpecially as he had got a ſingular knack at extricating
himſelf, when cloſely preſſed, by ſome facetious joke or merry
ſtory) that I wrote his lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and heard his expoſitions, without any
attention, or offering any objection, unleſs it was in the jocund way, and to
enliven our drooping ſpirits, and without troubling myſelf whether what he
ſaid or anſwered was right or wrong.</p>
            <p>I know not whether it was not owing to his perceiving this
liſtleſſneſs in us, that he began to raiſe our expectation and hopes
that his metaphyſics, which was ſoon to follow, would prove more delightful
to us. We did indeed expect it, from the nature of the ſubjects it treats of,
and were not a little <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0401000300:97"/> impatient to have this quarter
finiſhed, that we might enter into a more entertaining field: but when we
found ourſelves no leſs diſappointed in this, it only damped our
ſpirits the more, and gave me a ſtill greater diſlike to the jargon of
the ſchool, ſo that by that time we entered into the laſt quarter, when
ethics were to be the new ſubject of his lectures, and might have otherwiſe
proved more uſeful and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining to us, if it had been handled by a more
proper perſon, we were grown ſo tired and out of conceit with him, that we
reaped no more benefit from it than we had from the reſt; and inſtead of
diverting ourſelves with repetitions and diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his leſſons,
as we uſed to do at firſt, we ſtudied to forget every ſubject he had
diſcuſſed to us, as ſoon as we were got out of his ſight. Thus having
murdered, as I may ſay, another year, we were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, not without
great applauſe and compliments to ſome of us, on account of our parts and
proficiency. But if I may judge of the reſt by myſelf, to whom he was
always pleaſed to allow the firſt rank, I am ſure his praiſes were ill
beſtowed as <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0401000300:98"/> to any benefit we had reaped from his pains
and ours: however, I was by that time become ſo great a favourite to him,
that he afterwards left no means nor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes untried to induce me to
enter into their order, and I believe, in the mind I then was in, he might
eaſily have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had not my mother ſtrenuouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it. I
was ſenſible of my deficiency in all the branches of learning I had
hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto gone through, by the miſconduct of thoſe under whom I had
learned, and could eaſily ſee what dunces both my old Franciſcan maſter
and this Dominican rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor were, though they paſſed for able men; and where
could I better conceal my own defects and ignorance than under a monk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
habit, which would, at leaſt, give one the reputation of learning? But this I
had taken care to conceal from her, partly out of pride, and partly to prevent
her taking it to heart, and our rector had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs enough to make her
believe I was a prodigy, conſidering how young I ſtill was, and to
perſuade her to ſend me to the next univerſity, and to learn theology
there, promiſing to give me ſuch a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0401000300:99"/> to
the Dominicans who taught it there, as well as the Jeſuits, that no pains
ſhould be ſpared to make me ſhine in the world. She eaſily conſented
to it, and he gave me a certificate directed to the prior of their convent at
that great city, teſtifying that I had gone thro' a courſe of philoſophy,
and was fit to be admitted a ſtudent in theology, to which he tacked ſome
farther commendations; all which could be of no ſervice to me, unleſs I
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go and learn under the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, for the Jeſuits would
hardly have admitted me to that claſs, before I had gone a new courſe
through their philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. It had been, indeed, much better for me to have
choſen the latter, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the little proficiency I had made in it;
but my pride, and the fear of diſobliging my mother, determined me to the
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and I offered myſelf accordingly, and was readily admitted a
ſtudent under two very reverend rectors, the one for the morning, and the
other for the afternoon; both very grave and learned, indeed, in their way;
but, upon my firſt admittance, the ſchool appeared to me like a new world, 
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0401000300:100"/> where I was looked upon as a little raw ſtrippling, too
young quite, in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to herd among the reſt of the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
ſome of whom were twice my age, and none by many years ſo young as I. What
was ſtill more diſcouraging was, that here was no diſtinction made
between thoſe who had already ſtudied near two years (for the whole
courſe of theology laſts two whole years) and thoſe who were but newly
admitted. The ſame lectures were read and expounded to all alike, and in the
uſual courſe, ſo that thoſe who came not at the very beginning, had no
other chance, but at the end, to put middle and both ends together as well as
they could, which made the old ſtanders aſſume ſuch an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing air
over the new ones, as was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether mortifying, at leaſt it proved ſo to
me, who never had, till then, ſeen my ſchool-fellows ſo much above
me.</p>
            <p>I may fairly date the completion of my ruin from the time of my
coming to this populous place, on more accounts than one: for firſt, the city
was a noble, great one, full of gentry and nobility, of coaches, and all kinds
of grandeur, all which did greatly <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0401000300:101"/> affect me, who had
never ſeen ſo much by far of the beau monde, neither in my native city, nor
in the archiepiſcopal one, where I had ſtudied under the Jeſuits. 2dly, I
had been already cloyed with Aquinas's philoſophy, when I had no ſuch
bright tempting objects dancing before my eyes, what likelihood could there be
that ſuch a ſchool as this, ſhould reconcile me to the more refined and
unintelligible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities of his theology, eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
diſadvantages we late comers were forced to labour under, and the high
ſtate which our two rectors took upon them? for here was no room for
objecting, or even deſiring a point or a term to be explained, and we had
nothing to do but to write what they dictated, and take their expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for ſound doctrine. Even thoſe who had ſtudied longeſt under them, and
were looked upon as the brighteſt, were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to ſtart a
difficulty, though the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion was ever ſo fair; all which damped my
ſpirits, who had never been uſed to ſuch a reſtraint, and had,
moreover, the mortification to ſee myſelf placed in the loweſt rank, who
had, till then, been <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0401000300:102"/> moſtly at the head, that I grew
by degrees quite out of conceit both with myſelf and with the ſchool. What
added ſtill more to my diſcontentedneſs was, that I boarded at ſome
near relations in one of the ſuburbs of the city, and at a great diſtance
from the convent, and theſe commonly dined ſo late, that I muſt either
take up with an irregular meal, or come near an hour after the reſt to the
ſchool. I did indeed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the firſt for ſome time, but grew by degrees
weary of it, as the ſtudy I was upon grew leſs engaging to me; ſo that
though I took up as little time as I could at my dinner, yet one half hour, at
leaſt, was loſt by it, and our rector had dictated ſome pages of matter
to the reſt, which, after ſchool was over, I uſed to copy out of the
manuſcripts of ſome of my ſchool-fellows. Our rector having more than
once obſerved what irregular hours I kept, was ſo kind as to give me a
civil repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and not expecting, perhaps, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to it, was going on with
his lecture, but I had been ſo little uſed to make anſwers to it in dumb
ſhow, as I obſerved many of his hearers were forced to do, that I 
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0401000300:103"/> bluntly told him the occaſion, aſſuring him, that
I had not influence enough in the family to prevail on them to alter their
hours.</p>
            <p>The good father not approving of my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, which plainly
ſhewed that I could not forego my dinner for his leſſons, and might be an
ill precedent to ſome of the reſt, ſeemed rather inclined to lay the
fault on my being better pleaſed with thoſe late hours of dining, or elſe
he thought I might eaſily perſuade my relations to alter their method on my
account. But whether ſo or not, he inſiſted, and reaſonably enough,
that I ſhould conform to the ſchool-hours, whatever inconveniency it might
put me as to my dinner. I was ſenſible of the juſtneſs of his reproof,
and after having been often at high words with my relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (for they were
fully paid for my board) to no purpoſe, and tried to conform to the
ſchool-hours for ſome time, I grew weary of it, and having nobody to
controul me, which proved my greateſt misfortune, I quite forſook the
afternoon lectures, and ſpent that time in ſauntring about the city and
country adjacent, viewing the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0401000300:104"/> and
ſometimes taking plans and viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes of ſuch places as pleaſed me, but
without any other deſign than to divert myſelf. I was, however,
ſurpriſed ſoon after, to find myſelf interrogated by our morning
profeſſor, about the reaſon of my not coming to the afternoon lectures.
Whether my quondam maſter of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy had wrote any thing particularly
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his expectation of getting me into their order or not, I knew not,
but I was in a genteel manner given to underſtand by this, that I ought to
look on it as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular favour that they ſo far concerned themſelves
about me. What anſwer I made him, beſides my thanking him for his care, I
cannot recollect; but though we parted good friends, I ſoon after forſook
his lecture alſo, and from that time minded little elſe but my own
pleaſures, which, though altogether of the innocent kind, ſometimes with
the fair ſex, at other times in viewing the curioſities of the place, or
making ſolitary excurſions, and the like; yet were not without ſome
pungent remorſe, as they tended to little elſe but to inure me to a habit
of indolence and careleſs <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0401000300:105"/> inactivity. At ſome
intervals, indeed, I tried to read over all my manuſcripts both in
philoſophy and theology, but ſtill ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted with them, that I
never had the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to go through them.</p>
            <p>I had before this ſent ſome complaining letters to my mother,
as well as meſſages by word of mouth by ſome of my townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had
been witneſſes of the bad hours we kept, and to whom I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the
inconveniency it had put to, with relation to my ſtudies; and ſhe, good
wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thinking that I took it more to heart than I did, ſent me a ſmall
ſupply to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey me to Avignon, where I was to meet an old rich counſellor
of our town, who was gone to ſpend ſome time in that famed city. He had no
children of his own, but ſome nephews, one of which he deſigned to breed up
a ſcholar under me, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of which I was to lodge and board
with the uncle, till I could better provide for myſelf. As this was likely to
be a kind of change for the better for me, as well as an eaſement to my
mother, whoſe ſtrait circumſtances could hardly permit her to be at
ſuch expence for my education, I <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0401000300:106"/> made no delay to go
down to Avignon, where I found the old gentleman ready to receive me, and, a
day or two after, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into my new office of tutor to his nephew, who had
already made ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the Latin Grammar. I had not been long there
before I got acquainted with a young abbé, or candidate for prieſtly
orders, a countryman of mine, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious young man, of ſome learning;
and he finding that I had ſtudied philoſophy and theology under the
Dominicans, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced me to one of their profeſſors in this city, by whom
I was courteouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and ſoon after admitted to be one of his
diſciples. This father, who was a man of ſingular modeſty and humanity,
and was reputed a ſaint, paid me an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common regard upon my firſt
admiſſion to his lectures, and made an apology to the reſt of his
ſcholars for recapitulating ſome of his former leſſons and
expoſitions, <hi>in gratiam,</hi> as he was pleaſed to word it,
<hi>chariſſimi noſtri novi diſcipuli,</hi> that I might the better
underſtand what he was then, and afterwards, to deliver to us. This great
condeſcenſion, which had not been <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0401000300:107"/> ſhewed to me by
either of the profeſſors of the laſt univerſity, and which I ſince
underſtood was not uſual among them, did highly oblige me, and I would have
been glad to have made ſuch a proficiency under him, as might have, in ſome
mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, anſwered his ſingular kindneſs to me, which he ſtill
continued to expreſs all the time I went to hear him, but my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was,
that I was ſtill ſo unacquainted as well as diſguſted at the
ſubtilities of the ſchool, and met with ſuch crampt diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and
technical terms I was ſtill a ſtranger to, and was aſhamed to aſk the
meaning of from any of the ſcholars, who were far enough from thinking me
ſo great a novice to the language of the Thomiſts, that I began again, in
ſpite of all his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes, and my own eager deſires, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of
ever becoming a theologian; and theſe difficulties added to the lazy and
unthinking habit I had ſo long indulged, made me at length forbear going any
more to hear him.</p>
            <p>I have already hinted that my mother's cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances were too
narrow for the expence I had already put her to, and my father 
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0401000300:108"/> was ſtill more unable to give her any
aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in it, though he was not a little pleaſed at the great
progreſs he was told I had made for my years. Her hopes and mine were,
indeed, that I might by that means introduce myſelf as a tutor into ſome
good family, and ſave her all farther charges. But I had been ſo far
neglected in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of my education, had ſo little addreſs or
politeneſs, and knew ſo little of the world, that I could not look upon
myſelf as fit for ſuch an employment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong perſons above the common
rank, and my pride would not let me aim at any thing below it; ſo that
inſtead of trying as I might, and ought to have done, I was rather become
careleſs and indifferent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and I was indeed both too young and too
naturally unfit for it. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, ſome of my acquaintance,
unknown or undeſired, got me into a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling family, where I was upon
ſomewhat better terms than with my old counſellor; but the overgrown youth,
who was put under my care, and was much older, and taller by the head and
ſhoulders than I, had, by that time, contracted ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, 
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0401000300:109"/> or rather averſeneſs, both to the Latin tongue, and
to other laudable ſtudies, that had I been ever ſo diligent in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, it would have been to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe, as I ſoon found, he
wanted parts as well as inclination for ſtudy; ſo that we ſpent more of
our time in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the violin and flute than at our books. His mother, who
heard us at it longer and oftner than ſhe thought was conſiſtent with the
progreſs ſhe expected him to make under me, complained more than once of it
to me; upon which I made no difficulty to tell her, that a greater degree of
application would rather confirm him in his averſeneſs, than reconcile him
to his ſtudy, as he had ſo ſmall a capacity for it. I left this ſoon
after for a better place with a perſon of diſtinction, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted two
ſons of his to my care, both very young, and ſpoiled by the mother, that
the eldeſt, above ſeven years of age, could but juſt read, and neither of
them inclined to learn. I tried what I could to bring them to it, but to little
purpoſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a little hiſtory, which the eldeſt took more freely to,
but the mother's indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0401000300:110"/> was not the only
obſtacle, and as ſhe was a ſprightly lady, and her ſpouſe ſomewhat
heavy, though not old, I ſoon found by her behaviour, and her parting beds
with him ſoon after my coming, that ſhe would have been better pleaſed I
had transferred my care from them to her; and as I was naturally fond of
ingratiating myſelf with the ſex, I indulged her in all her little foibles,
but without having the leaſt deſign of going farther than a bare
complaiſance, in order to gain her eſteem and admiration, rather than her
affection, and to ſatisfy my own vanity, rather than cheriſh a dangerous
paſſion for her. This made me to take frequent occaſions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
myſelf by falſe merit, ſince I had no real one that could do it, by
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to more virtue and religion than I had, and to palliate the low
circumſtances of my parents by ſome vain excuſes, and pretences, all
which I did with ſo little caution, and in ſo aukward a manner, as made me
appear rather more deſpicable in her eyes, conſidering the mean appearance
I made, and which was owing chiefly to my own negligence and bad oeconomy. 
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0401000300:111"/> All theſe diſadvantages, however, might have been
eaſily overlooked, and I might have been readily ſuffered to indulge my own
prevailing paſſion, if I could but have ſhewed more concern for hers.</p>
            <p>It is not my deſign to dwell on ſuch ſcenes as theſe, much
leſs to aſcribe my neglect and overlooking the ſeveral diſtant offers
made by ſo agreeable a perſon to my own virtue. I might more juſtly
impute it to my natural ſheepiſh baſhfulneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced youth;
however, after a ſix month's ſtay, and ſome viſible proofs that it was
not in my power to conquer it, I perceived a ſtrange coldneſs to ſucceed,
which made me think it would not be long before I was diſcharged. She was
ſoon after viſited by ſome relations, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded her to go and
ſpend ſome part of the ſummer with them about twenty miles off. They,
eſpecially the gentlemen, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the air of libertines, and all of them
expreſſed a ſingular contempt for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions of the church of
Rome, by which I gueſſed them to be concealed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, of whom there
were great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in Languedoc, Provence, Dauphinee, <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0401000300:112"/>
and I have had ſince reaſon to think, that my young lady was ſo
likewiſe, by her light behaviour at church, and on other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I had
ſome ſmall diſputes with them, being then very zealous for that church,
but they knowing that I had ſtudied divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and fearing, I ſuppoſe,
leſt too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger an oppoſition to what I urged againſt them ſhould
cauſe a diſcovery, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined entering the liſt with me any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and I then found, for the firſt time, that the Proteſtants had more to
ſay for themſelves than I had ever imagined; for the divinity we were
taught at the ſchools ſeldom meddled with the controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us
and the Proteſtants, ſo that had it not been for fear, thoſe gentlemen, I
found, might eaſily have foiled me, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all my theology. The
lady was preparing for her journey, and was to take her ſons with her, yet
kept me in ſuſpenſe whether I was to accompany her, or ſtay with her
huſband, or be diſcharged. I have had reaſon to think ſince, that ſhe
had an end in it; but finding my behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſtill aukward and unpromiſing,
not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome freſh eſſays, which I <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0401000300:113"/>
did not then ſo well comprehend, ſhe left it to her huſband, who was a
perſon that cared for nothing but his bottle, and left her to do as ſhe
pleaſed in every thing elſe, to acquaint me with the news that they
ſhould have no farther occaſion for me. I was more grieved than
ſurpriſed at it, which, ſhe perceiving, occaſioned one more ſnare to
be laid by means of the chambermaid, which proving ſtill unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful,
and this was the very night before they were to ſet out, I was deſpiſed
and laughed at, and given to underſtand, that I might thank myſelf if the
lady and I went different ways.</p>
            <p>I have already hinted that virtue and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had little or no
ſhare in my diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing her, but rather a vanity of being thought more
chaſte than I really was, which kept me ſo indeed, as to the act, not only
on this, but many other ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, though in heart and thought few men were
more ſtrangers to that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue than I, even at thoſe tender years; and
though religion, which, in all my fooliſh extravagancies, I never once loſt
ſight of, held ſtill ſome check on my mind, yet <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0401000300:114"/> it
could hardly turn even the ſcale againſt any favourite paſſion of mine,
farther than to make me condemn myſelf after having yielded to it; ſo that
it was rather the fear of a repulſe, or ſome other or worſe
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence that kept me from ſhewing an equal ardor for her, whatever
opinion my different behaviour might give her of me. The company and ſhe were
no ſooner gone than I took the road to Avignon, where I heard that my old
counſellor was gone home, with his nephews, to my no ſmall grief,
eſpecially as my pockets were then low; the widow where we had boarded very
poor, and I had ſo few acquaintance in that city; however, I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to
ſtay with her till I could write to my mother for a freſh ſupply, or till
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better fell in my way, though I had little reaſon to expect any
ſucceſs from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; being by this time become very ſhabby in cloaths
and linnen, and more indolent and inactive than ever. To ward off, as much as
poſſible, the pungent mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of my preſent circumſtances, I had
recourſe to my old ſtratagem, of cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf with ſome falſe
merit for want <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0401000300:115"/> of a great one, and of pretending to be a
ſufferer for religion for a too great attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the church, and laying
moſt of the blame on my own father, as uſing me the more ſeverely on that
account; all which, though abominably falſe in every reſpect, yet being too
eaſily liſtened to by ſome of my acquaintance, eſpecially among the
friars, did gain me ſo much pity and admiration, as ſoothed my vanity for
the preſent, though it did not anſwer the main end I propoſed, its
introducing me into ſome new family as a tutor, and at the ſame time
accounting, in ſome tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meaſure, for the mean appearance I then
made.</p>
            <p>I was about the ſame time informed that the famed fair of
Baucaire, a city in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc, on the Rhone, and one of the largeſt fairs in
Europe, was at hand, and that among the great concourſe at it, I might meet
with ſome of my own townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, from whom I might get a freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. I
went accordingly, and found there ſeveral merchants of my acquaintance, who
furniſhed me with as much money for the preſent, as would juſt ſerve,
but, on the <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0401000300:116"/> next day, when I expected to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a much larger ſum, I only met with a ſevere reprimand for my mean
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and for not having made a better uſe of the opportunities I had
had of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging my mother from all future ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences on my account. I
excuſed it as well as I could to them, they being no ſtrangers to the great
poverty, not to ſay univerſal miſery, that then reigned at A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignon,
where the ſtreets abounded with people, who, from living very comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and ſome of them richly, on the ſilk manufacture of the place, were, on the
decay of it, reduced to the loweſt degree of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary. They told me, that
though that was too truly the caſe of the tradeſmen, yet the prieſts and
monks lived in as much plenty as ever, and a lad of my parts and learning might
eaſily have found means to have recommended himſelf to ſome of them,
inſtead of appearing in ſuch a guiſe as I did, and which they ſaid made
them apprehenſive I had taken up ſome ill courſes. This cenſure, which
was no leſs unjuſt than ſevere, if they ſpoke what they thought, did
cut me to the heart; for no <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0401000300:117"/> youth could be more free
from the vices of drinking, gaming, intriguing, &amp;c. than I was. Happy it
would have been for me if I could have as eaſily diſculpated myſelf from
thoſe of indolence, vanity, and bad oeconomy; for theſe were the true
ſources of my misfortunes, inſomuch that I am perſuaded, if they had
ſupplied me with as great a ſum, as I could in reaſon have deſired, I
ſhould have been induced to have laid out the greateſt part of it in ſuch
curious nicknacks and trifles as that fair affords, eſpecially of the
muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal kind; for I had already, in that ſhort interval, agreed for a good
number of them; but whether they had ſet any body to watch my motions, and
gueſſed at the prepoſterous uſe I ſhould make of what money they
might lend me, or whatever other reaſon they might have, they abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
refuſed to let me have even ſo much as would bring me back to Avignon; ſo
that one may eaſily imagine the diſmal plight I was in all the way thither,
to ſay nothing of that mortification I ſhould meet with among my
acquaintance there at my ill ſucceſs. I found, however, a plauſible 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0401000300:118"/> excuſe for it, by pretending that I was come a day or
two too late, and that the merchants were, by that time, ſo ſhort of caſh
that they could not ſupply me, but that they would remit me what I wanted
ſoon after their return home. I likewiſe told my old landlady, to whom I
was hardly indebted for a quarter of a year's board and lodging, that I
expected two of them to be there ſhortly at an approaching fair, which was
actually true, and ſhe knew and dealt with one of them for ſome ſort of
goods, ſo that had I had the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to have ſtaid till then, my mother,
who had expreſſed no ſmall reſentment at their ungenerous refuſal,
would not have failed ſending me a freſh ſupply by them; whereas, hearing
that I had left the place, ſhe ſent only what would pay the poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whilſt I, unknown to her, or any one elſe, had taken a reſolution to
return home, bare as I was of money and cloaths.</p>
            <p>I lately took notice of my ſhameful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of being a kind of
ſufferer for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to ſome of my acquaintance, and tho' vanity and my
then ill plight was my only incentive to it, I began now to think 
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0401000300:119"/> it might be made a means of facilitating my long journey
homewards; I went ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly and furniſhed myſelf with a kind of paſs,
or certificate, at a proper office, ſignifying that I was a young ſtudent
in theology, of Iriſh extract, and that I had left the country for the ſake
of religion, by which is commonly implied the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholic, and that I was
then going on a pilgrimage to Rome. This abſurd and falſe aſſertion
coſt me ſince many a ſhameful lye to make it paſs for current,
eſpecially as often as I met with any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had any tolerable
knowledge of Iriſh affairs, to which I was an utter ſtranger. I did,
indeed, know ſeveral Engliſh and Iriſh, who had followed king James's
fortune, and were well reſpected in France, Italy, &amp;c. but my vanity
could not be ſatisfied with the credit of paſſing for the ſon of ſome
one of them; I wanted to have it thought my own voluntary act, that I forſook
that country and my parents, and fortune, for the ſake of religion. Had the
ſecretary, from whom I had procured that certificate, been ever ſo little
diffident, my very name, which had nothing of Iriſh <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0401000300:120"/> or
Engliſh, but which my pride would not let me forego, becauſe it had
ſomething of quality in it, would eaſily have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the roguery of
the pretence; and this I mention to ſhew my raſhneſs and ignorance, of
which I ſhall give a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance, in the method I took immediately
after obtaining the paſs, to equip myſelf in a pilgrim's garb; for I was
not in a condition to purchaſe one, tho' it conſiſted only of a long
ſtaff handſomely turned, and a ſhort leathern or oil-cloth cloak, not
unlike what the women call a pelerine. However, I had obſerved ſuch a one
in a chapel belonging to a pariſh-church, and dedicated to a miraculous
ſaint, which, I ſuppoſe, had been ſet up there as a monument of
gratitude by ſome wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering pilgrim come to the end of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The
chapel was never without a number of devotees, who prayed and burnt tapers
before the image of the ſaint; but this did not deter me from venturing in,
and taking both ſtaff and cloak away at noon-day; had I been examined about
it, I was only furniſhed with a juvenile pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that I looked upon it to
be ſet up <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0401000300:121"/> there to accommodate ſuch pilgrims as
could not otherwiſe provide themſelves with it. How far ſuch a poor
excuſe might have gone I know not, neither did I trouble my head about it;
however, I eſcaped without ſuch an enquiry, and carried it off
unmoleſted, and made what haſte I could to ſome private corner, where I
threw the cloak over my ſhoulders, and walked with a ſanctified gravity
with the ſtaff in my hand, till I was got out of the city.</p>
            <p>Being thus accoutred, and furniſhed with a paſs to my mind, I
began at all proper places to beg my way in a fluent Latin; accoſting only
clergymen, or perſons of figure, by whom I could be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and was
moſt likely to be relieved; and I found them moſtly ſo generous and
credulous, that had I had the leaſt propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to provide for hereafter, I
might eaſily have ſaved a good deal of money, and put myſelf into a much
more creditable garb, before I had gone through a ſcore or two of miles; but
ſuch was my vanity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, that as ſoon as I had got what I
thought a ſufficient viaticum, I begged no more, but viewed every thing worth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0401000300:122"/> ſeeing, then retired to ſome inn, where I ſpent my
money as freely as I got it, not without ſome ſuch aukward tokens of
generoſity, as better ſuited with my vanity than my preſent
circumſtances. The nearer I drew to my native place, the more irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute I
grew, whether I ſhould pay a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to my mother, or continue my journey to
Rome; the concern I knew ſhe muſt be in about me, ſtrongly inclined me to
the former, but my uncommon mean garb, which was become only more ſcandalous
by the length of the journey, made me ſo aſhamed to be ſeen either by
her, or any of my friends, that I fully reſolved on the latter. I had, in
order to it, wheeled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to the left, to leave the place at ſome twenty or
thirty miles diſtance, and was got into a ſmall town where I little
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be known, when venturing on the Sunday into the church, at the
time of high maſs, I was ſurpriſed to ſee ſome perſons,
eſpecially two or three gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, whoſe chief reſidence was at my
native city, but who it ſeems were ſpending part of the ſummer at that
place, and who, in ſpight of my being thus <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0401000300:123"/>
tranſmogrified, did eaſily recall me to mind, and gave me to underſtand
they did. I was ſo ſhocked at it, that I left the church at the moſt
ſolemn part of the ſervice, when they were moſt intent on their
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, not caring to ſtand an examen from them, and made the beſt of
my way through private paths, to avoid being caught if purſued. Whether I was
ſo I know not, but the ſight of them made ſuch a ſtrong impreſſion
on my mind, and raiſed ſuch an earneſt deſire in me of ſeeing once
more that beloved city, eſpecially conſidering that it was now
impoſſible to conceal either my way of travelling, or mean appearance from
my friends, that as ſoon as I thought myſelf out of the reach of a
purſuit, I took the direct road home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, with an intent to go and ſatisfy
my poor anxious mother, before ſhe got the intelligence from other hands, and
conſult with her, whether I ſhould purſue my journey to Rome, or get into
any other way ſhe liked better. And I only took care to enter the city in the
dusk of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and got to her houſe unperceived by any but thoſe of
the family.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0401000300:124"/>My poor mother was glad to ſee me, tho'
ſorry to behold the mean garb I was in, and failed not, though with her
uſual ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, to chide me, for having made ſo bad an uſe of the
opportunities, ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed I had had, of puſhing my fortune, which,
ſhe knew as well as I, was but too much owing to my indolence. Much more
reaſon would ſhe have had to chide me, had ſhe known how much of my time
I had trifled away during the laſt year and half I had been abſent from
her; but that I concealed from her, and the good woman was ſometimes inclined
to think, that my too great eagerneſs after my ſtudies had made me neglect
every thing elſe. But I was greatly ſurpriſed at the end of two or three
days, during which I had kept as much from ſight as I could, to hear her
propoſe to me, ſince I had found out ſo cheap, ſafe, and eaſy a way
of travelling, to go and pay a viſit to my father, who then lived ſome
hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of miles from her, and try what I could get him to do for me; and I
had the more reaſon to wonder at her propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, becauſe ſhe knew, as
well as I, that a <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0401000300:125"/> tradeſman of our town, who had been
with him about two or three years before, had brought us a very indifferent
account of his circumſtances. This made me ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that a couſin of
mine, and a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of hers, whoſe fortune was in no wiſe
ſuitable to his high ſpirit, had put that ſtrange project in her head,
that I might be far enough out of the way of obſtructing her kindneſs to
him. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was any real foundation for my ſuſpicion, I cannot
ſay, but the ſurprize ſhe obſerved me to be in at her propoſal, made
ſuch an impreſſion upon her, that ſhe forgot nothing that could
aſſure me of her maternal and unalterable tenderneſs, alledging that
ſhe only wanted to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfied of the condition my father was in,
than ſhe was from the report of the tradeſman above mentioned, and adding,
that in caſe I found it not to my liking, and him as tender as I might
expect, ſhe charged me expreſsly to leave him, and come back to her as
ſoon as poſſible, and by no means to ſtay longer than a year from her,
unleſs I could convince her that it was very much to my advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0401000300:126"/>Being thus far ſatisfied of her maternal
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I eaſily conſented to take the journey, having by that time
contracted an inclination to ramble and ſee new coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and as it was a
long and dangerous one, we thought it improper to alter my dreſs, the
meaneſs of which would rather be a ſafeguard; however, ſhe thought fit to
ſew up a ſmall quantity of gold to my cloaths, which, ſhe ſaid, would
ſerve to buy me ſome better ones, when I came near the end of my journey.
My ſtaff and cloak, with the addition of a long looſe gown, made of a light
kind of black buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram to cover the reſt from duſt, were ſent by a man to
a place on the road, about four miles off; and very early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I
took a ſorrowful leave of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhe of me, and ſhe repeated her
charge to me to return to her, if I did not find things to my ſatisfaction.
When I came to the place where my pilgrim's dreſs waited for me, I put it on,
and went on not without a heavy heart, tho' with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt doubt of my
mother's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant affection. My direct rout was thro' the firſt great
univerſity where I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0401000300:127" rendition="simple:additions"/> to ſtudy
theology, ſo that I was forced to wheel about to avoid it, for fear of being
known. All the reſt of the way I was an utter ſtranger to, and I met
frequently with ſome objects that made me ſhrink, tho' it was a
conſiderable high road; now and then at ſome lonely place lay the carcaſe
of a man rotting and ſtinking on the ground by the way-ſide, with a rope
about his neck, which was faſtened to a poſt about two or three yards
diſtance, and theſe were the bodies of highwaymen, or rather of
ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, ſailors, mariners, or even galley-ſlaves, diſbanded after
the peace of Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, who, having neither home nor occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, uſed to
infeſt the roads in troops, plunder towns and villages, and when ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken were
hanged at the county-town by dozens, or even ſcores ſometimes, after which
their bodies were thus expoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the highway <hi>in terrorem.</hi> At
other places one met with croſſes, either of wood or ſtone, the higheſt
not above two or three feet, with inſcriptions to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; 
<q rend="inline">"pray for the ſoul of A. B. or of a ſtranger
that was found murdered on this ſpot."</q> Theſe deterring objects made me 
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0401000300:128"/> willing to aſſociate myſelf to ſome
fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-travellers whom I met on the ſame road; but ſuch was my vanity,
that I never renewed the pilgrim's trade of begging whilſt any of my money
laſted, but was rather laviſh of it on ſome of them, tho' I know not how
ſoon I might feel the want of it; and I had not reſumed it long before I
met with ſuch a mortification as made me heartily repent of my folly. I was
to go through the celebrated city of Lyons, abounding with the fineſt
buildings and other curioſities, which I was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſee; and
when I came to one of the gates, was asked by an officer, in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very like our
beadles, whether I wanted a viaticum? Not knowing the conſequence of his
queſtion, I anſwered in the affirmative, and was bid immediately to follow
him. I was ſurpriſed at the length of the way he led me, and obſerved
ſeveral fine churches, palaces, ſquares, &amp;c. which I ſtood ſtill to
admire, but was not ſuffered to do ſo long; and at length, after about an
hour and half's good walking, was told, that that was the oppoſite gate at
which I was <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0401000300:129"/> to go out and purſue my journey; he then
clapped a couple of pence into my hand, and told me, that I muſt not venture
back into the city under ſome ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and left me quite
aſtoniſhed and unable to reply. As ſoon as I had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered myſelf, I
began to reflect on my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance and diſappointment in a moſt lively
manner, but thought it beſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to follow his advice, rather than
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe myſelf to ſome ſhameful treatment, if I attempted to return.
What increaſed my concern was, the fear of finding the ſame method
obſerved in every great city I came to, but, happily for me, it proved
otherwiſe, and I not only went through them all without moleſtation, but
ſtaid in ſome of them long enough to view every thing worth ſeeing, and
to converſe with men of learning and piety, from whom I received ſome
tokens of their generoſity.</p>
            <p>The misfortune was, that my raſhneſs and vanity would not
ſuffer me to keep within due bounds, but I muſt ſet myſelf off to the
higheſt advantage, by pretending to greater merit and learning than was
conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0401000300:130"/> even with common prudence, as it
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed me to the continual danger of a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſcovery. I took
notice heretofore how little progreſs I had made in the Greek tongue, rather
through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and neglect of ſome of my teachers, than want of
capacity or application, but now I pretended to be not only maſter of it, but
likewiſe in ſome meaſure of the Hebrew, though I knew not a ſingle
let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the latter, and had only ſeen ſome Hebrew books belonging to the
Jews of Avignon, by which I juſt could diſtinguiſh that from other
characters; the truth is, that neither that nor any of the oriental tongues,
nor even the Greek, were much ſtudied by the clergy; ſo I was not under any
great danger on that account, though I own I have been ſometimes foiled at
the latter, becauſe I commonly addreſſed myſelf to the prieſts, among
whom I met, now and then, with one who underſtood it. I muſt alſo
acknowledge that I found the generality of them very charitable, and ſome of
them even generous, though it the more redounds to my ſhame, ſeeing neither
the meanneſs of my garb, of <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0401000300:131"/> which yet I was not a
little aſhamed, nor the mortifying accidents that had happened to me could
prevail upon me to ſave a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling towards buying any thing better. I had
indeed ſome hopes to do ſo, as I came nearer to my father, but here I was
again juſtly diſappointed; the two or three laſt provinces I was to
paſs through, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been greatly impoveriſhed, and even laid waſte by
the late war, ſo that I found the clergy here leſs rich and generous, and
ſo great poverty reigned among the laity, that I had much ado to get
ſufficient ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance among them. I ſhould likewiſe obſerve
here, that every town, or even village I came through, had a number of
Lutherans and Calviniſts, who were ſtill in a worſe condition, inſomuch
that their miniſters were obliged to keep ſome poor inn or alehouſe for
ſubſiſtance; ſo that by that time I had reached my father I was quite
pennyleſs and threadbare. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, however, made myſelf known to
him, though to his great ſurpriſe, not only on that account, but as it was
ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected viſit, of which he had not had the leaſt notice given
him, nor did at all <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0401000300:132"/> dream of. The city where I met him
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about three or four miles from his houſe, he clapped a ſmall piece
in my hand, and directed me to a houſe where I might get ſome
refreſhment, and towards night conducted me to his own home, which I was not
a little ſurpriſed to find even meaner than our townſman had deſcribed
to my mother and me. Here he bid me a freſh and moſt tender welcome, and
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſuch a viſible concern that he was not able to give me at
leaſt as good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment as I had been uſed to with my mother, that I
was hardly able to make him a proper anſwer.</p>
            <p>And indeed the difference I found between the two places, the
forlorn condition I ſaw myſelf in, the mean figure I made in an obſcure
kind of village, my being now not only out of the way of any improvement, but
in danger of loſing what I had got, afforded me ſuch a diſmal proſpect,
that I could not eaſily conceal my uneaſineſs, and, in a little time, a
more than ordinary deſire of returning to my old home, ſince this new one
was in every reſpect ſo little inviting to me. He found it no leſs
diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0401000300:133"/> to conceal his diſlike of my returning to
my mother, and tried all he could to diſſuade me from it. He adviſed me
to try my fortune at two or three neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cities or univerſities, and I
complied with his deſire, but found much greater diſcouragements than I
could expect: firſt, the Jeſuits were the teachers in all of them, and I
had ſtudied with the Dominicans, between whom and them there never was a
right underſtanding, but rather quite the contrary. I was got into a new
country, (Germany) where the pronunciation of the Latin differed ſo much from
that I had been uſed to, that though no one could ſpeak it more fluently
than I, I neither could underſtand them, nor make myſelf underſtood by
them, without the greateſt difficulty. The country had been ſo ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by
the war, that thoſe few mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant ſcholars that remained in thoſe
uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities<note n="*" place="bottom">Moſt of the univerſities of Germany
have a number of theſe mendicant ſtudents, who, as ſoon as the
ſchool-hours are over, go along the ſtreets from houſe to houſe,
ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome pious Latin verſes to excite people's charity, and, in
ſome opulent cities, get enough to live well and comfortably, and to buy all
the books that are neceſſary for them, by which means ſome of them become
very learned men, and get to good preferment; but as it was quite otherwiſe
in theſe, and, indeed, every city along the Rhine, quite down below the great
city of Cologn (where the French forces had cauſed ſuch dreadful
delapidations as could not be ſeen without horror); theſe univerſities
had been long ſince forſaken by all thoſe mendicant ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, who
could no longer find means of ſubſiſting them. And this I afterwards
obſerved to be the caſe in every place where the French troops had been, as
I may have further occaſion to ſhew in the ſequel.</note>, might be
rather ſaid to ſtarve than <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0401000300:134"/> to ſubſiſt. My
youth and ignorance of the German tongue, as well as my foreign pronunciation
of the Latin and Greek, would likewiſe have diſqualified me for being a
tutor in any family, had there been any in a condition to have maintained one;
ſo that after all my efforts, which I rather tried out of obedience to my
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than any likely hopes I could have of ſucceſs, I returned to him
<hi>re infecta,</hi> all which only ſerved to revive my deſires of
returning to my mother. But he being ſtill as averſe to it as ever,
bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of a new way to diſſuade me from it, and with ſo
much art at the ſame time, that I could not diſcover his aim. He had ſeen
the greateſt part of Europe, and <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0401000300:135" rendition="simple:additions"/> could give an
extraordinary account of it; he underſtood ſeveral of its languages,
particularly the Italian, French, Spaniſh and German, and expatiated much on
the advantages he had gained by travelling; and expreſſed, at ſome
diſtance, a deſire that I ſhould viſit ſeveral of thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
I had not yet ſeen, particularly thoſe of Holland, Flanders, and Brabant,
which he highly commended for their opulence, and the great number of learned
men they produced, and expatiated much on their hoſpitality, generoſity,
and fondneſs for men of parts and genius, and how greatly I might be admired
and promoted there on account of my learning, knowledge of languages and
ſciences, and for having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready travelled through ſo many conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
parts of the world, all which he ſaid was the more ſurpriſing, as I was
ſtill ſo very young, for I was then hardly full ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old. He
could not indeed have found a more effectual way than that of ſoothing my
vanity, to make me give wholly into his views, and as to the objection of the
want of money, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how well acquainted I was with the 
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0401000300:136"/> way of travelling at free-coſt, he ſaid I could not
but promiſe myſelf much better ſucceſs through thoſe countries, where
the peoples generoſity was equal to their known opulence.</p>
            <p>I was now (unknown to him) to think of ſome more cunning,
ſafe, and effectual way of travelling than that I had followed in my two
former journies; and ſince I found that my paſſing for an Iriſhman and
a ſufferer for religion, did not only expoſe me to the danger of being
diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but came ſhort of the merit and admiration I had expected from
it, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on a new project, which, though equally hazardous, I had not
ſenſe enough to foreſee, and tho' ſtill more diſhoneſt, I had not
virtue enough to deter me from. I ſay, unknown to my father, for I had
carefully concealed all the vile indirect pretences I had already uſed, and
much more was I now obliged to do ſo, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be ſo upright and
religious a man, that I ſhould not only have incurred his utmoſt anger, but
that he would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have taken all poſſible means to have deterred me
from, or diſappointed me in <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0401000300:137"/> it. I recollected, that
whilſt I was learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humanity, rhetoric and geography with the Jeſuits, I
had heard them ſpeak of the Eaſt-Indies, China, Japan, &amp;c. and
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate much in praiſe of thoſe countries, and the ingenuity of the
inhabitants. The idea they had given us of them was indeed too general and
imperfect, at leaſt what I remembered of it, was by far too ſhort and
confuſed, for a perſon of the leaſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or forecaſt to have built
ſuch a wild project upon, becauſe all the notion they had given us of it,
was only from their maps and comments upon them, for they made uſe of
geographical books. However, I was raſh enough to think, that what I wanted
of a right knowledge of them, I might make up by the ſtrength of a pregnant
invention, in which I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered myſelf I might ſucceed the more eaſily,
as I ſuppoſed they were ſo little known by the generality of Europeans,
that they were only looked upon, in the lump, to be Antipodes to them in
almoſt every reſpect, as religion, manners, dreſs, &amp;c. This was my
crude notion of the matter, which I thought afforded a vaſt 
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0401000300:138"/> ſcope to a fertile fancy to work upon, and I had no
miſtruſt of myſelf on that head. I had likewiſe heard that their way of
writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing differed very much from ours, but how, and in what, I was altogether
igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or had quite forgot it, and ſo took it into my head, that like the
Hebrew, and other oriental tongues I had heard of, they muſt write from the
right to the left, and on this puerile ſuppoſition, I ſet about
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitating of an alphabet that might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer my purpoſe. Another thing
that ſhewed my inconſiderate folly was, that tho' I could not but know that
the Greeks and Hebrews had particular names for their letters, it never came
once into my head to imitate them in that, as I had in the figures, powers,
&amp;c. of ſome of the letters on a ſuppoſition, that as they might flow
originally from the ſame fountain, ſo they might be reaſonably imagined
to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtill ſome kind of reſemblance. The truth is, my time was
ſhort, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in what I went about ſo very ſmall and confuſed,
and what I did was by ſtealth, and fear of being detected by my father; that
I was ſoon after made ſenſible of my <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0401000300:139"/> want of
forecaſt, when I came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with proper judges, and found the
neceſſity not only of inventing names for the letters, but to make
ſeveral amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to my wild ſcheme, as I became better acquainted with
thoſe Eaſtern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>However, conſidering my tender years, ſmall experience, and
other ſuch diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, I have had ſince no ſmall cauſe to wonder
how I could excogitate not only ſuch an alphabet, and names of letters, but
likewiſe many other particulars e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually difficult, ſuch as a
conſiderable piece of a new language and grammar, a new diviſion of the
year into twenty months, a new religion, &amp;c. and all out of my own head, in
order to ſtuff them into that moſt abominable romance which I publiſhed
ſoon after my coming into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and which occaſioned ſuch variety of
opinions concerning it, and its ſhameleſs author; ſome thinking it above
the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of ſuch a young fellow to invent, and others believing it the
reſult of long thought and contrivance. Alas, for me, my fancy was but too
fertile and ready for all ſuch <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0401000300:140"/> things, when I ſet
about them, and when any queſtion has been ſtarted on a ſudden, about
matters I was ever ſo unprepared for, I ſeldom found myſelf at a loſs
for a quick anſwer, which, if ſatisfactory, I ſtored up in my retentive
memory. But to return to my alphabet, as ſoon as I had finiſhed it to my
mind, I began to inure my hand to write it with ſome readineſs, that it
might upon occaſion appear natural to me, which I found the more difficult,
as I never was expert at my pen, and was quite unuſed to this backward way of
writing; and this obliged me to alter the form of ſome of them, for the more
eaſy tracing them with the pen, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive ſome abreviations and
joining of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and other ſuch improvements for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, which done,
I thought myſelf ſufficiently prepared for paſſing for a Japaneſe
converted to Chriſtianity. The only difficulty was, how to reconcile this new
and vile aſſumption with my Avignon certificate, which was not to be done
but by copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it anew, and altering it where I ſaw fit, and clapping the
ſeal from the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal one to the counterfeit; but though I 
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0401000300:141"/> was ready enough at wording it to my mind, I wrote ſo
indifferent a hand, that it could never paſs for that of a ſecretary of a
vice-legate, and to have had it done by a better penman was too difficult and
hazardous for me to venture. At length I thought it ſafeſt to truſt to my
copying it as well as I could, with its flouriſhes and ornaments, though I
did it in ſuch a coarſe and clumſy manner, that it would hardly have
paſſed for a tolerable counterfeit. There was likewiſe another danger of
a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery from the different marks and make of the German and Avignon
paper, but that never came then in my head; ſo that having made what
alterations I thought proper in the tenor of the paſs, and clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the old
ſeal to it, I made no difficulty to truſt the reſt to fortune, and took a
melancholy leave of my poor father, who ſhed abundance of tears over me, and
wiſhed me all poſſible bleſſings and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, not dreaming how
little this new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of mine deſerved of either; and when I was got at
ſome diſtance from him, I put on my old pilgrim's habit, and began my
journey with a kind of heavy heart, <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0401000300:142"/> according to the
rout he had penned down for me, and which was quite oppoſite to that which
would have brought me to my own home. I had, indeed, taken care to write to my
anxious mother, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her with what had paſſed between my father
and me, and with my deſire of taking a tour into the Low Countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I
returned to her, but I had afterwards reaſon to fear, that the melancholy
ſtyle in which it was worded, did rather increaſe than mitigate her concern
for her now really worthleſs ſon; for, from that time, neither ſhe, nor
yet my father, ever heard of me more, nor I of them, and, in all likelihood,
both of them have bewailed my loſs at a much greater rate than I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
if it did not prove the means of ſhortening their days.</p>
            <p>The reader may ſee by all this, what a raſh and abandoned
fellow I was, how loſt to all ſenſe of religion, nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and how I expoſed myſelf to ſo many dangers, over head and ears, to
indulge a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite paſſion, and without the leaſt proſpect of reaping
any benefit from it, or even aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at it. However, this is nothing in
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0401000300:143"/> of what is to follow, and it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a
wonder that ſo bad a beginning, ſo ill concerted, and worſe followed,
hath not had a more dreadful ending, and I can only aſcribe it to the
undeſerved mercy of God, that it did not end in my total ruin of body and
ſoul. And I muſt deſire the reader to bear ſtill in mind the
conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of my tender years, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages of my wrong
education, if he intends to read what is to follow with any tolerable patience,
at leaſt till he comes to ſome more agreeable ſcenes: In the mean time,
as I am now entering into One of the blackeſt ſhame and guilt, I
ſincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, that it is the fartheſt from my heart to aggravate or
extenuate either, in order to render the following account more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
or agreeable, but to relate the whole with the ſame ſincerity, as I
ſhould be willing to do it, or wiſh it to have been done, at my laſt
moments. And I hope I ſhall be the more readily believed, as I do not
deſign to have it printed till after my death, when all ſiniſter views
will be quite taken away, and nothing be able to yield any ſatisfaction on
the other ſide of the <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0401000300:144"/> grave, but the
conſciouſneſs of its ſincerity, eſpecially conſidering that I
ſhall leave nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther children nor relations to reap any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from this
narrative. But to return to my propoſed rout:</p>
            <p>I was at firſt to viſit all the conſiderable cities on both
ſides of the Rhine, as they lay in my way to that of Cologn, whither I
pretended to go on a religious pilgrimage to the three kings, whoſe remains
are ſaid to be there interred in the cathedral<note n="*" place="bottom">Thoſe were the wiſe men that came to worſhip our Infant
Saviour, and are, by the church of Rome, ſtiled kings, and pretended to have
been only three, whom they call Gaſpar, Melchior and Balthazar; the legend
adds, that upon their being warned not to return to Jeruſalem, they took the
way to Cologn, and died, and were buried there. Their heads are expoſed in a
ſtately ſhrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the great altar every Wedneſday, and they ſhew
you the gate by the Rhine-ſide, at which it is pretended they came in by, and
which hath been ſince walled. This Cathedral doth likewiſe contain a number
of other relicks, and miraculous pictures to feed the devotion of the vulgar,
and bring a conſtant concourſe of people thither.</note>, to which there is
a great reſort of devotees almoſt all the year: for the Germans are equally
fond of pilgrims that come to any of their great ſaints, as the Italians are
of thoſe that come to Rome or Loretto, or <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0401000300:145" rendition="simple:additions"/> the
Spaniards to thoſe that go to St. Jago de Compoſtella; ſo that I did not
doubt of meeting with a kind reception wherever I came. I ſhall not take up
the reader's time in deſcribing the places I came through, that being much
better done in books of travels; but only obſerve, that I found them all in a
moſt diſmal plight, moſt of the fine buildings ruinated, noble palaces
with only the bare walls, half de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed, cathedrals, and other ſtately
churches, built of the fineſt marble and other coſtly ſtones finely
carved, battered half down, and nothing left fit for divine ſervice but the
choir or chancel, which in many places were quite unroofed, and only thatched
with ſtraw. All the reſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſtill more woeful condition,
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the conquering arms of Lewis XIV. had penetrated, for this was but a
few years after the peace of Reſwick, ſo that they had not had time to
recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from theſe dreadful ravages.</p>
            <p>An accident happened to me before I had gone far, which, had I
been leſs raſh and inconſiderate, might have deterred me from purſuing
my ſham pilgrimage farther. <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0401000300:146"/> It was at the city of
Landau, garriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the French, and commanded by an old experienced
officer, and was then a very ſtrong place, and the laſt town they had in
Alſace. The familiarity I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to carry on with ſome of the
infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior officers and ſoldiers of the garriſon, who were pleaſed with
the whimſical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I gave of myſelf and my pretended country, made me
ſuſpected of being a ſpy, and as ſuch I was accordingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by a
file of muſqueteers to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who, not being ſatisfied with my
account, ordered me to be ſent to gaol, where I was at firſt confined in a
noiſome place for ſome hours, but afterwards ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the liberty of
the priſon till the next day, when I was conducted in the ſame manner out
of the city, and forbid, under the ſevereſt penalties, to return into
it<note n="*" place="bottom">In that fabulous account I give of myſelf,
prefixed to the hiſtory of Formoſa, I pretended to have been ſeized here
for taking a plan of the fortifications of the place, which was abſolutely
falſe; for though I had done ſo more than once in my native country, where
I could give no umbrage, I was not ſo ſtupid as to do ſo in this; neither
was it conſiſtent with my ſcheme to pretend to any ſkill in drawing and
fortifications. However, as to the governor of the place it is moſt likely
that my youth and ſimplicity moved his pity more than any credit he could
give to what I ſaid for myſelf; for excepting my making a longer ſtay in
it than is uſual for pilgrims, there had been nothing ſaid or done by me
that could give the jealouſy of my being a ſpy.</note>. This dreadful
eſcape might, one <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0401000300:147"/> would think, have opened my eyes to
ſee the folly and danger of my ill-concerted ſcheme, as well as reminded me
of my promiſe of returning to my poor anxious mother, if I did not think fit
to ſtay with my father. But my religion and prudence were much of a piece,
juſt ſufficient to make me apply myſelf to heaven in time of danger,
which was no ſooner blown over, but I as quickly forgot what I owed to
either, except that I looked on myſelf as obliged to aſſiſt at the
church offices, ſuch as maſs, veſpers, &amp;c. as often as opportunity
offered, which I continued do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till a more wicked and abominable project
made me leave it off. Theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars may perhaps be thought too tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
to my readers to be worthy inſerting, but to me they appear in a quite other
light, and do but too plainly ſhew how naturally one miſcarriage draws on a
worſe, <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0401000300:148"/> where religion and reaſon have unhappily
loſt their influence, or yielded it to a predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant and ungovernable
paſſion, and how eaſily the indulging of it will, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, come to
quench all remorſe and conviction, and unleſs the Divine Grace
interpoſes, hurry a man into utter perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as no man hath more
ſenſibly felt the ſad effects of the one, as well as the bleſſed ones
of the other, what can I do leſs than acknowledge and adore that divine and
undeſerved mercy, to which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone I owe ſo great, and I hope effectual,
deliverance? And what cauſe have I not to be, to the higheſt degree,
thankful that I had ſuch early impreſſions of religion inculcated into my
mind, and which tho' ſuppreſſed and ſmothered for a long time, by the
violence of a favourite vice, did yet, in God's own time, bring me into a
ſenſe and abhorrence of my paſt follies, and, in ſome meaſure, drove
me from the moſt dreadful danger into the arms of a merciful and forgiving
Saviour, and that in ſo wonderful and unhoped for a manner, that it was
impoſſible for me to attribute <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0401000300:149" rendition="simple:additions"/> the
bleſſed change to any thing but to a ſupernatural grace and mercy?</p>
            <p>I ſhall, however, in the ſequel, be more ſuccinct,
eſpecially in my account of what happened to me from Landau, to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
time in which I was unwarily drawn into the moſt abandoned piece of
impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that of my pretended converſion to Chriſtianity by Dr. James,
then chaplain to a Scotch regiment garriſoned at Sluys; for to mention all
thoſe particulars would not only appear a moſt ſtupid and tedious, but an
almoſt incredible ſeries of the moſt unaccountable follies and
diſaſters that any raſh youth could fall into. It will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to ſay, that I travelled ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred leagues through Germany, Brabant
and Flanders, under the notion of a Japa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe converted to Chriſtianity by
ſome jeſuit miſſionaries, and brought to Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, by them to be
farther inſtructed, as well as to avoid the dreadful puniſhment inflicted
on all that turn Chriſtians in the dominions of the emperor of Japan. In
purſuance of which ſhameful pretence, I kept up an outward form or
religion, was frequent at church, and was ſometimes <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0401000300:150"/>
affected with thoſe duties, and, at other times, pinched with a tranſient
remorſe and ſhame at the conſciouſneſs of the wicked part I was then
acting. My fluency in the Latin tongue, and ſmattering of other branches of
learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eſpecially logic, philoſophy and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, of which my
tenacious memory ſtill preſerved ſome of the moſt curious parts, joined
to the flagrant account I gave of myſelf, procured me, indeed, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
and a greater ſhare of beneficence, than was commonly ſhewed to other
tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers or pilgrims, but my careleſſneſs and extravagance not
ſuffering me to lay out any money in dreſs, or even linnen, to keep me
clean and decent, I, by degrees, made ſo diſmal and ſhabby an appearance,
that I outdid the very common beggars, and this misfortune brought on worſe
upon me. For firſt, it gave ſuch an ill face and diſcredit to all my
pretences, as all my learning could not counterbalance; and 2dly, when I came
into ſome conſiderable cities, which I was deſirous to ſee, and where
they have hoſpitals for pilgrims and ſtrangers, with ſuitable
accommodations according to their rank, appearance, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, 
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0401000300:151"/> commendation, I ſhewed, in vain, my counterfeit
paſs, which, if I had been in a better trim, would, from the advantageous
manner in which I had dreſſed it, have procured a much better reception;
thoſe who attend on ſuch occaſions would ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom give themſelves the
trouble of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, though I begged of them ſo to do, but, taking it for
granted, that I was one of the loweſt rank, or deſerving to be treated as
ſuch, did generally herd me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the meaneſt, by which I ſaw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a ſhort time covered with rags and vermine, and infected with a moſt
virulent itch. This diſmal plight, one would have thought ſufficient, to
rouſe me from my ſenſeleſs lethargy, and make me follow the example of
the returning prodigal, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, as I found, to my great mortification,
that all my fair ſhew of learning, made me appear now only the more
deſpicable in the eyes of the ſoberer part; for how could even thoſe, who
gave any credit to what I told them, forbear ſuppoſing that I muſt have
been guilty of ſome great enormity, or elſe the Jeſuits, by whom I
pretended to have been brought out of Japan into <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0401000300:152"/>
Avignon, would never have given me up to ſo ſhameful a vagabond life; and
no doubt but the far greater part believed it all a forgery, though they did
not think it worth the while to have me called to an account for it. Thus did I
find my affairs grow from bad to worſe, inſomuch that I was often pinched
with want, and glad would I have been to have returned home to my mother; but
the thought of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition would not permit me to think of it, and,
perhaps, I could have preferred any death to ſo great a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication as it
would have been both to her and me. I have, however, had reaſon to think it a
mercy that I had ſuch an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate itch, added to all my other
misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, for I perceived that in ſeveral great cities of Brabant and
Flanders, there are a ſort of procureſſes, who wander about the ſtreets
under the character of Begines<note n="*" place="bottom">The true Begines are a
good ſort of unmarried wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who dedicate themſelves to works of charity;
but inſtead of being cloiſtered up like the nuns, viſit the houſes of
the poorer ſort, and procure them all proper relief from the charitable rich.
They likewiſe extend their care to the ſick, lame, priſoners and
ſtrangers, and are known by a particular plain dreſs, not unlike that of
the nuns. But there are alſo many vile women, who, under the cloak of that
dreſs and character, carry on the trade of procureſſes, and are but too
commonly encouraged and ſupported in it, by the profligate rich and
great.</note>, <pb n="151" facs="tcp:0401000300:153"/> and pick up all the likely fellows they
meet with, in order to make a lewd trade of them; and I being then very young,
ſanguine, and likely in perſon, have now and then been invited and led by
them in a ſeeming hoſpitable manner, to ſome cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable ladies to
receive, as was pretended, ſome token of their generoſity, but, in reality,
to return a leſs commendable one to the benefactreſs. But my diſtemper,
whether or no it was imagined to be of a worſe kind than it was, proved
ſuch a diſguſtful bar, that I never was put to the trial, otherwiſe I
am ſure neither my vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue nor prudence would have been proof againſt it;
for though I was then abſolutely innocent of any criminal commerce with any
of the ſex, yet, circumſtanced as I was, I have reaſon to believe I
ſhould eaſily have yielded at any hazard, and this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration
made me ſtill more weary of my wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0401000300:154"/>I was at length come to the celebrated city
of Liege, and ſtayed ſome time there, to view all the curioſities of the
place, and at night took up my lodging at the hoſpital, where we were
likewiſe allowed ſome kind of ſupper. There I was informed that an
officer was arrived at one of the ſuburbs belonging to the Dutch, who
inliſted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into the Dutch ſervice, and gave good encouragement to
ſuch vagrants as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fit to carry a muſket. I had no great hopes that
I ſhould paſs muſter with him, being both too young and ſhort, as I
thought, for his purpoſe: however, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to try, and ſoon
perſuaded half a dozen of my fellow ragamuffians to follow me; but as nobody
could have a greater averſion than I to a ſoldier's life, by what I had
ſeen at my native place, where was always kept a ſtrong garriſon, I began
to wiſh I might meet with a repulſe. The reſt were preſently inliſted
by the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed officer, for he only bought them to ſell them again; but
when he came to me, and had heard my patched up ſtory, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of
ſeeming diſcouraged from taking ſuch a raw and tender boy, he really, to 
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0401000300:155"/> my great ſurprize, ſhewed me an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon regard,
tho' I made the worſt figure of any of his recruits; and I could by no means
conceive the reaſon of it till near a month after, during which time we were
well entertained at an inn, wanting for neither victuals nor drink. He ſoon
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved me to be averſe to ſtrong liquors, and indulged me in it. At
length, having ſold away all his recruits but me, he began to tell me that he
had too great a regard for me, to ſend me with them to carry a brown
muſket, and that he deſigned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better for me, and more
ſuitable to my education; but that he muſt firſt try to get me cured of
the ſcabious diſeaſe, which by that time had ſpread itſelf all over
my ſkin. Accordingly he tried all proper medicines, got me phyſicked,
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, blooded, bathed, &amp;c. but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs. Being at length
obliged to return to his then home, he got me hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely equipt, and took me
to Aix-la-Chapelle, where I found he kept a grand coffee-houſe, and
billiards, and other games, in the moſt handſome part of the city, over
againſt the town-hall, and here I <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0401000300:156"/> was to wait on the
cuſtomers, and to teach a boy of his to read, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I had reaſon to believe that my new-maſter had conceived hopes
that I ſhould bring a good number of cuſtomers to his houſe; and, as for
myſelf, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to find no ſmall ſatisfaction in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen, and
ſuffered to diſplay my parts among them. But we found ourſelves both
diſappointed, in a great meaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, tho' it was then the heighth
of the ſeaſon for drinking the waters, and the town was full of people; yet
the greateſt part of them were ſeldom to be ſeen any where but at the
pump, and the walks about it, and theſe were at another and diſtant part of
the town; ſo that there was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any reſorted to his coffee-houſe,
except gentlemen that came thither to ſpend an hour or two at billiards,
backgammon, baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, or ſome other game, and theſe were men of little
or no taſte for learning, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept two or three French refugees, who appeared
to me to be profeſſed gameſters. Theſe, and now and then ſome German
gentlemen, that dropped in by chance, would condeſcend to divert themſelves
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0401000300:157"/> with my company, queſtion me about variety of things,
and hold an argument with me about ſome curious or inſtructing ſubject,
and at their going away commonly left ſome marks of their generoſity,
which, however, my maſter gave me to underſtand, I was to be contented with
ſuch a ſhare of as he ſhould pleaſe to allow me.</p>
            <p>Beſides his coffee-houſe, he furniſhed the balls, and other
places of that reſort, with lemonade, orgeat, and other cooling li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
proper for the ſeaſon, as well as with variety of drams for ſuch as liked
them. And here it was that I beheld the beau monde in ſuch extraordinary
ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, as was like to have been of the moſt fatal conſequence to me,
and to have drove me to the moſt deſperate piece of folly and madneſs
that a man in his ſenſes could have been guilty of, and which I ſhall
forbear mentioning, merely for the ill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion it might be apt to make
on ſome weak and ſceptical minds; but which, while I live, I ſhall never
forget, nor ceaſe bleſſing the divine mercy which kept me back from it.
And it was well for me that I was ſent thither but once more, tho' 
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0401000300:158"/> another man he kept, much older and fitter for the
buſineſs, was obliged to give daily attendance there; and I can only think
that my cuticular diſeaſe, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played itſelf too viſibly in my
hands, was the cauſe why I was ſo ſeldom ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Before the ſeaſon was over, my maſter, who had other irons
in the fire, was obliged to go to Spa, ſome German leagues from
Aix-la-Chapelle, for a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, during which time a great noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, at
leaſt one who paſſed for ſuch there, had run himſelf pretty deep in
his debt, by ſome grand entertainments he had given on ſeveral occaſions;
and it was now whiſpered about, that he was juſt on the point of
diſappearing. My miſtreſs, upon the firſt hint of it, told me I muſt
immediately ſet out and fetch her huſband. The time was ſo ſhort, and
the way ſo long and difficult, conſidering that I was to go on foot, that
there was ſcarcely any probability of my reaching the place time enough, and
much leſs ſo, conſidering I was a ſtranger to the road and to the
lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that I would have willingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0401000300:159"/>
myſelf from it, and have perſuaded her to have diſpatched a man and
horſe to him, but ſhe was a haughty dame, and above being adviſed, ſo
that I was forced to comply, though without any hopes of getting there time
enough, in which caſe it would be of no ſervice to him, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if I
ſhould chance to loſe my way, of which there was ſo much the more danger,
as it was very intricate, and I knew not a ſtep of it, nor how to be
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed about it, for want of the German tongue. And indeed, though I took
all the care I could, I found before I was got half way to the place, that it
would be impoſſible for me to avoid being ſo often out, through the
various windings and turnings, and croſs-roads I frequently met with, that I
deſpaired of reaching it in double the time. The anxiety and fear I was in
was ſo great, about the reception I ſhould meet with, both from him and her
for my ſucceeding ſo ill, that I began to think of preventing it, by giving
them both the ſlip. My heart, however, heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated a good while, and
upbraided me with the ingratitude and injuſtice I was <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0401000300:160"/>
going to be guilty of, as likewiſe with the danger I might incur, ſhould I
be caught afterwards by him; for in ſuch a caſe, I muſt have expected
nothing leſs than the higheſt marks of his reſentment. But when I
conſidered, on the other hand, that all my care and diligence could not bring
me to him time enough, and that I ſhould be ill treated for that which I
could not avoid, I preferred a diſtant danger to one ſeemingly at hand; and
being then juſt going to croſs a high road, which I was told led to the
city of Cologn, immediately took to it, with a reſolution to return to my
father, and then to my mother, by the ſame way I had formerly gone. This
laſt conſideration was then ſtrong with me, as it revived in my mind the
concern and grief they muſt be in about me, eſpecially my poor mother, who
had heard nothing from me ſince that melancholy letter I ſent to her upon
leaving my father. The thoughts of ſeeing again two ſuch dear pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, had
ſo enlivened me, that it had in a great meaſure effaced all other
reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, particularly the remorſe of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to my late
maſter. But here I <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0401000300:161"/> was again diſappointed, not only
of that happineſs, but even from the very proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and hopes of it, and
that juſtly too, and by my own ſtupid folly. And ſince the Divine
Providence had ſo wonderfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered me from the dangers and miſeries
of a ſoldier's life, by inſpiring my maſter with ſentiments, whether of
gain or pity, or both, and I had made ſuch ungrateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, both to God
and him, it was but juſt I ſhould plunge myſelf into the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and
danger I was ſo unworthy to eſcape.</p>
            <p>I had already paſſed through Cologn, and Bon the reſidence
of the elector of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logn, and got to another city of his elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torate
likewiſe on the Rhine, when upon my entering it at one of the gates, I was
accoſted by a perſon genteely dreſſed, who, among ſeveral other
queſtions, aſked me if I was willing to enter into that elector's
ſervice, and uſed ſome of the uſual topicks to induce me to it. I was
ſurpriſed at his queſtion, and readily enough anſwered in the negative,
but was ſoon after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by him to accept his offer, tho' without the
leaſt force or circumvention, <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0401000300:162"/> and merely by my own
weakneſs and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, or rather ſome judicial fatality, for nothing
leſs than that I ſhould think could have made me alter the laudable
reſolution I had taken, or ſo eaſily ſet aſide the thoughts of
reviſiting and reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two ſuch dear and afflicted parents once more,
after I was got ſo far in the way to it; but this was not the only misfortune
that attended this raſh and unnatural action, which rather proved the fatal
ſource of new ſcenes of miſeries and wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>The liberty that is commonly granted to ſoldiers to ſwear,
game, drink, whore, &amp;c. is very great among the Germans, and much more
among the French; theſe laſt may be juſtly affirmed to be the moſt
profligate of any I ever have known or read of. There is no crime or lewdneſs
they will not commit, no oaths or curſes ſo terrible they will not delight
in. They ſeem deſtitute of all ſenſe of religion and
ſhamefacedneſs, and ſo wholly careleſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a future ſtate, that I
have ſeen many of them go to the gallows for deſertion with as much
unconcern, and ſome of them <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0401000300:163"/> with a ſeeming
jocundity, as if they were mounting the guard; and not one of them did I ever
obſerve to ſhew the leaſt ſign or repentance, fear of death, or concern
about another life. Thoſe we had in this regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were, if poſſible,
ſtill worſe, being moſtly deſerters from the French ſervice, and to
the laſt degree profligate: and if there was any one among them that was more
ſoberly or religiouſly inclined, he was ſure to become the object of
their ſcorn and contempt, and to be baited like ſome wicked or monſtrous
creature, a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of which we had in this regiment; and theſe,
coming to be intermixed with a number of raw young German recruits, taken
ſome from the plough and cart, others from their trades, and ſome even from
the Univerſities, did debauch them into all manner of wickedneſs. This was
the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy herd I was now got among, and whoſe company and example
compleated my ruin, by extinguiſhing thoſe few faint traces of religion I
had left. I was indeed neither inclined to drinking nor gaming, and was not
hardened enough in impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to follow them in their lewdneſs; 
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0401000300:164"/> but was bad enough, nevertheleſs, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
myſelf, in order to appear as vile and abandoned as they, in a ſhameful
habit of uttering ſuch new and faſhionable oaths, and monſtrous curſes,
as I had lately rather heard with horror, than learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at Aix-la-Chapelle;
and as I was ſtill as ambitious as ever to paſs for a Japoneſe, choſe
to profeſs myſelf an unconverted or heatheniſh one, rather than what I
had then pretended to be, a convert to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. My vanity ſoon made
me begin to make an aukward jeſt and ridicule of the moſt ſolemn and
ſacred truths of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and to take a brutiſh delight at the
ſurprize which the more ſober people of the town I converſed with,
expreſſed at my blaſphemous and prophane expreſſions and objections,
as well as in the pleaſure I obſerved this gave to my fellow-ſoldiers, or
rather fellow-brutes.</p>
            <p>As the former had obſerved me to be, in all other reſpects, a
ſober young fellow, given to no vice; and found me likewiſe maſter of
ſome ſenſe and learning, they began to expreſs an uncommon
compaſſion for me, and, believing me a heathen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, 
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0401000300:165"/> propoſed to me to enter the liſts with ſome of
their learned prieſts or monks, who, they doubted not, would eaſily
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of my error and danger; tho' they themſelves had not been able
to do it. It can hardly be doubted, but ſuch a vain abandoned fellow as I
was, would readily accept the offer. To have declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would have betrayed a
diffidence I was not capable of; ſo that I pleaſed myſelf with having a
fair opportunity of diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my parts and learning againſt my
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts, and either to ſtand proof againſt all their arguments, or
yield myſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by them, according as I ſhould find it ſuit
beſt with my vanity or intereſt; for if I found it worth my while to
chuſe the latter, I thought I ſhould appear to the world as a convert of
uncommon ſize, and gain no ſmall applauſe by it. There was but one thing
could make me heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate about it, viz. the horrid guilt I ſhould plunge
myſelf into by ſuch a vile piece of hypocriſy, and I own it made ſome
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon my mind; but it proved ſhort-lived, and my own
ſanguine temper ſoon got the maſtery of it, and I at length 
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0401000300:166"/> conſented to be introduced to a Capuchin of that city,
who was eſteemed a man of great piety as well as learning, and who had been
appriſed before of the intended viſit, and the purport of it.</p>
            <p>When we came to the monaſtery, we found the good old capuchin
ſitting on a bench, in an outward room of it, facing the gate, with a luſty
young woman kneeling before him, barking like a dog, and making a great many
other antick noiſes and poſtures; upon which I was told that ſhe was
poſſeſſed, and that the good father was exorciſing the evil ſpirit
out of her. Whether ſhe was then ſent for on purpoſe, or came by
accident, I know not; but I remembred to have ſeen her at ſome
proceſſions, and once or twice at church, in the ſame unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
attitudes; and, as I was then weak enough to think it a real
poſſeſſion, from her extravagant actions and words, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fear,
ſo great is the power of guilt on ſome occaſions, that the devil might
either expoſe me for the vile part I was then acting, or perhaps do me ſome
other and worſe miſchief, as he had formerly <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0401000300:167"/> done to
thoſe vagabond exorciſts of whom we read Acts xix. 16. to avoid which I
withdrew as ſoon as I decently could, as if to leave him to go on with his
exorciſm. Whether he took it in this ſenſe or not, I know not; but at our
next meeting, when ſhe was out of the way, he took occaſion from thence to
prove the truth of the Chriſtian religion in general, and of the church of
Rome in particular; and that her prieſts alone have the power of caſting
out devils. I told him, with a ſmile, that it would be time enough to
inſiſt on the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, or enquire into the reality of it, when it was
actually performed; to which he replied, with an air of great pity and
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs, that God did frequently permit ſuch poor creatures to be
tormented for ſome time, before he vouchſafed them a deliverance; but that
tho' exorciſms and prayers would not avail till then, yet they were obliged
in charity to make uſe of them, in hopes that they would one time or other
prove ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>As we came to enter into other arguments, I found that the good
old Capuchin was better provided for a controverſy againſt 
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0401000300:168"/> Proteſtants than againſt heathens, which gave me no
ſmall advantage againſt him; and this I took with ſuch an aſſuming
air, and lightneſs of mind, that could not but be diſpleaſing to him;
this was ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to me, that I never could forbear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing it upon
all ſuch occaſions, and no wonder if it gave them great cauſe to think me
either not ſerious enough for the momentouſneſs of the diſpute, or
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps rather that I was nothing leſs than what I pretended to be. I cannot
indeed recollect, that any thing like this laſt was their real judgment of
me, from any thing that dropped from them, though it was but too viſible to
be the caſe, if their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity did not blind their judgment in my favour;
however, I could ſee plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from their uneaſineſs, that they
were not likely to be very forward in repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our conferences, and I was
vain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to impute it to my being an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match for them in the diſpute.
And it was in the ſame vain boaſting ſtrain, that I affirmed in that
fabulous account I gave of myſelf in England, that I was diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of
that ſervice for being a heathen, <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0401000300:169"/> and for refuſing
to yield to the arguments of thoſe who had attempted to convert me. The
aſſumption was abſolutely falſe, and I was diſcharged by order of the
colonel, becauſe I was not only below the ſtandard, but alſo too tender
for the fatigues of a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier's life. And indeed I cannot expreſs the
miſeries we underwent in the ſervice of that prince, who was then ſo
eminently poor, that great numbers of his troops pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed for want of
cloaths, fewel, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of bread; and had I not been treated with greater
care and tenderneſs than moſt of the reſt were, muſt inevitably have
pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in a very hard winter at Bon, where, beſides the want of all
other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, the greateſt part of the garriſon were quartered in
barracks open to all winds and weather, and forced to lie on the bare
boards.</p>
            <p>Being thus happily diſcharged from ſo dreadful a ſlavery, it
was natural for me to think once more of returning to my long-wiſhed-for
home, at any rate, and at all hazards; but here likewiſe my ill fate had laid
an unexpected obſtacle, which it was not in my power to remove; for my late 
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0401000300:170"/> captain, a ſordid wretch, who had been raiſed to his
poſt from that of a common centinel, by the baſeſt means, had taken
thoſe cloaths I had brought from Aix-la-Chapelle under his care, and, as he
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to prevent my ſelling them, and ſpending the money; but upon my
being diſcharged, refuſed to reſtore them to me, though he ſtripped me
of my ammunition ones, and had the conſcience to ſend me away in the heart
of a ſevere winter, with a bare looſe old frock of blue linnen, and without
waiſtcoat or ſhoes to my feet, for thoſe he gave me were
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o worn out that my feet touched the
ground, ſo that I could never have travelled far before the hardneſs of the
weather would have made an end of me. This made me reſolve to go back to
Cologn, and try how far my diſmal plight and fluent tongue would work upon
peoples charity; but it being then war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, I was ſtopped, as is uſual in
garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned cities, at the gate, and conducted to the main guard, to give an
account of myſelf to the officer then on duty. I did ſo, and lighted on a
perſon, who was really a gentleman, and took ſuch liking 
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0401000300:171"/> to me, that I liſted myſelf in his company, and was
preſently after ſupplied with cloaths fitter for the ſeaſon. I
paſſed to him for a Japoneſe and a heathen, and was entered in his
company under the name of Salmanazar, which, ſince my coming into England, I
altered, by the addition of a letter or two, to make it ſomewhat different
from that mentioned in the book of Kings, but whether my new captain believed
what I told him or not, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came no ſmall favourite of his. He was a man of
good ſenſe, ſpoke Latin and French well, and had ſome good ſcholars
in his company, one or two of them of the church of Rome, whereas the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
conſiſted moſtly of Lutherans, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the duke of Mecklenburg,
but was then in the Dutch pay, and garriſoned at Cologn.</p>
            <p>That great city is, perhaps, one of the moſt ſuperſtitious
in all Germany; every ſtreet and every houſe hath the ſtatue or image of
ſome ſaint or other, to which they light candles at night, but moſtly to
that of the Virgin Mary. Our Lutherans, in ſpight of all prohibitions from
the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0401000300:172"/> could not forbear ſhewing their
diſlike and contempt to theſe, and many other ſuperſtitious cuſtoms
they beheld, and were ſometimes puniſhed for it. Yet did not this deter me
from taking pride in outdoing them, though I was ſo far from having the
ſame laudable pretence for it, that in my heart I condemned them for their
untimely zeal, and myſelf for my impious vanity. We had likewiſe ſeveral
looſe gentlemen brought up in ſome of the beſt univerſities, who had
been prevailed upon to exchange their gowns and books for a musket; ſome of
them were Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, others Papiſts, and with theſe our chief officers
delighted to ſet me on diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, by which I had gained their ill will
ſo far, as I generally proved too hard for them, that they had ſtigmatized
me with the titles of heathen, infidel unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and the like; but theſe,
inſtead of giving me any uneaſineſs or remorſe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoothed my
pride, and made me now and then, upon a proper occaſion, take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to
remind them that I could give better reaſons for my being ſo, than they
could for themſelves. My captain think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0401000300:173"/> that our
chaplain, who had been brought up a regular clergyman in the Lutheran way,
might ſucceed better with me, propoſed a conference to him; but he being a
baſhful young gentleman, modeſtly declined it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf
with expoſing the folly and abſurdity of the heatheniſh religion in
ſome of his ſermons, where he had a large field to expatiate on, without
the danger of oppoſition. I was afterwards introduced to two others, one who
ſerved the Lutheran meeting at Cologn (for they tolerate Proteſtant
meetings in time of war for the uſe of the garriſon, though they ſhut
them up in time of peace) and the other a man of great learning, at a ſmall
diſtance from the city. Our diſputes proved but of ſhort duration, I
always attacking them upon ſuch points, as I knew they were the leaſt able
to defend, but by Scripture, which I pretended not to believe, but urged even
thoſe very points, ſuch as the Trinity, Conſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, &amp;c. as
arguments againſt it; and this, as well as my vain and aſſuming
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, might eaſily raiſe a diſlike, if not <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0401000300:174"/>
more likely, a miſtruſt of me. One thing I had occaſion to obſerve,
that where Papiſts and Proteſtants are ſo intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, their guides are
better ſtored with arguments againſt each other, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the common
enemies of the Chriſtian faith.</p>
            <p>From Cologn we were ordered into Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by the next ſpring,
and began to encamp as ſoon as the campaign began. The Lutherans and
Calviniſts had prayers morning and night at the head of every regiment, and a
ſermon on Sundays, and I was vain enough to go from one to the other to
obſerve their method of devotion, and ſinging of pſalms and hymns, at
which they both behaved with great ſeriouſneſs: but as for me, after
liſtening awhile to them, I was commonly driven by my raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and
vanity to turn my back to them, and turning my face to the riſing or
ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſun, to make ſome aukward ſhew of worſhip, or praying to it,
and was no leſs pleaſed to be taken notice of for ſo doing. This vain fit
grew up to ſuch a height, that I made me a little book with figures of the
ſun, moon and ſtars, <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0401000300:175"/> and ſuch other imagery as my
phrenſy ſuggeſted to me, and filled the reſt with a kind of gibberiſh
proſe and verſe, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in my invented character, and which I muttered or
chanted as often as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour took me.</p>
            <p>I have often juſtly wondered at the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar goodneſs of
God to ſuch a vile aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned wretch as I was become by this time, that in
neither regiment, in which I had continued, as I remember, about two years,
during which a ſharp and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere war was carried on with equal
fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it never was my lot to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to a ſiege, battle,
party, ſkirmiſh, or place of danger, in which I might have been ſuddenly
cut off in the midſt of a moſt impious career; or, what is equally
ſurpriſing, that the apprehenſion of ſo dreadful an end, ſhould not
have deterred me from ſo ſenſeleſs and wicked a courſe, and made me
feel the monſtrous ſtupidity of running ſuch deſperate hazards of body
and ſoul, for the ſake of a little popular admiration at the beſt; but,
inſtead of which, I have more frequently met with mortification and contempt.
But I was <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0401000300:176" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſtill very young, to the beſt of my
remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance not above eighteen, if quite ſo much; my mind miſguided by a
wrong education, as I have before obſerved; conſcious of my own want of any
real merit, and yet fond to exceſs for any kind of pretence to it; and ſo
deſirous of being admired and taken notice of, that, rather than have
foregone that favourite paſſion, I would have choſen to indulge it, I
verily believe at that time, at the hazard and expence of being looked upon as
the very vileſt fellow that ever lived. As for thoſe impreſſions of
religion which I had ſo ſtrongly imbibed in my youth, they gradually loſt
their influence in proportion to my giving way to that deſtructive
paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and, at the beſt, were more in my head than in my heart, till
it pleaſed the divine grace to tranſplant them thither, as the propereſt
ſoil for their fructifying; but this bleſſing did not come down to me
till after ſeveral years, and a variety of ſcenes of impiety and guilt. I
ſhall paſs by the other occurrences of my ſoldier's life, to come to that
fatal one which proved the <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0401000300:177"/> ſource of new and more
horrid offences againſt God and man.</p>
            <p>The laſt garriſon I came to was at Sluys, where was a French
and a Scotch regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Dutch pay. There I ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came acquainted with
ſeveral of the French officers, whoſe language I perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood;
but as I was wholly unacquainted with the Scotch and Engliſh, and few of them
could ſpeak Latin, I could not be ſo converſant with them. I found moſt
of thoſe French gentlemen very ſuperficial, and did not a little indulge my
vanity in ridiculing their tenets, whether they were Papiſts or
Proteſtants, for there was a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them, and had occaſion to
obſerve (tho' to my ſhame, had I had the leaſt ſenſe of the vile part
I played) that, tho' the greater number of them were given to ſuch flagrant
vices as are but too common among gentlemen of that profeſſion; yet they
all appeared ſo firmly attached to the tenets of their particular churches,
that they expreſſed much more uneaſineſs at thoſe ſarcaſms I
uſed to throw out, than they did at the moſt dreadful oaths they commonly
ſwore, or any vices that <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0401000300:178"/> reigned among them. And as I
ſtill kept myſelf untainted from the latter, and had long ago broke
myſelf of that horrid one of ſwearing, which I had taken up on my firſt
entrance into the ſoldier's life (not ſo much indeed out of a principle of
religion, as from an ambition I had of paſſing for a moral heathen) I
frequently uſed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to them the unreaſonableneſs of their
untimely zeal, which made them ſo readily condemn me for what they called my
irreligious ſarcaſms, which yet were but agreeable to my notions and
belief, whilſt they indulged themſelves in vices, ſuch as duelling,
wenching, ſwearing, and drinking, which were not only incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with
theirs, but ſuch as, bad as they thought me, I could not on any
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration be guilty of. Theſe kinds of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere rebukes ought, I
ſay, to have filled me with the deepeſt ſenſe of my own more vile and
abominable inconſiſtency; but as that did not ſo openly appear, the
applauſes I received from the ſober part, and even from ſome of the
miniſters, for ſo ſtrenuouſly pleading the cauſe of virtue, made me
quite blind to my more <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0401000300:179"/> odious vices; ſo that as long
as the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter or ſhadow of moral virtue procured me ſo much regard and
eſteem, I never troubled myſelf about the want of the real
ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>Brigadier Lauder, a Scottiſh gentleman, well reſpected, and
colonel of a regiment in that garriſon, was then governor, and, unhappily for
me, conceived a curioſity of ſeeing me at his own houſe, where were
aſſembled ſeveral officers, beſides the miniſter of the French
church, and Mr. Innes, chaplain to the Scottiſh regiment; and after dinner I
was admitted to have a kind of conference with them. I own, indeed, that the
account I gave of it in that publiſhed romance of mine, was far enough from
candid or impartial, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the French miniſter, who was the
chief manager in the diſpute, my uſual vanity having made me relate it too
much to his diſadvantage, and Mr. Innes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom and that gentleman
there was a great miſunderſtanding, added ſome other particulars, equally
miſrepreſented and mortifying; but, abating that, the reſt is the
trueſt part I can call to mind in that <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0401000300:180"/> forged
narrative of myſelf. However, Mr. Innes, ſince dubbed doctor by one of the
Scotch Univerſities, and a near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the governor, would not loſe
ſo fair an opportunity of triumphing over his rival, and finding that I had
nonpluſſed him at almoſt every argument, but more particularly againſt
that of abſolute predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, took occaſion to inform me that it was
a doctrine as much condemned by ſome, as it was ſtrenuouſly aſſerted
by other churches, and that conſequently Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, he would undertake
to prove, was not to be charged with it. He had a much ſmoother and leſs
overbearing way of ſpeaking than the other gentleman, and kindly invited me
to his lodgings, where we might, at our leiſure, diſcuſs that or any
other points in diſpute, not doubting but a perſon of my ſenſe,
learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſeeming candor (as he was pleaſed to compliment my vanity)
would eaſily yield to conviction, when the point was once cleared to my
ſatisfaction, as he did not doubt he ſhould ſhortly do.</p>
            <p>I readily accepted of his invitation, by which I found he
deſigned to exclude the <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0401000300:181"/> French miniſter from having
any ſhare in our future conferences, but did not then ſuſpect his farther
drift, which was, if he could, at any rate, or by any means, make a convert of
me, to recommend himſelf to the then worthy biſhop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, a perſon,
he knew, of ſuch ſingular candor, as not to be over ſuſpicious, and too
generous not to encourage what he thought a charitable, worthy action; ſo
that, as I eaſily found afterwards, the hopes of procuring ſome preferment
to himſelf, rather than any regard or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for me, was the main ſpring
of all his pretended zeal for my converſion. I am ſorry that I ſhall be
obliged, in the ſequel, to relate ſeveral very harſh truths concerning
his behaviour on this ſcandalous occaſion, though I will be ſtill careful
to mention no more of it than is barely neceſſary to ſet the matter in a
true light, and rather conceal than expoſe ſuch parts of it, as have not an
immediate relation to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I am upon; much leſs will I go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to
aggravate his faults, in order to extenuate my own. If he ſhould be ſtill
alive when theſe memoirs ſhall be publiſhed, <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0401000300:182"/> will
not be the firſt thing that has been publiſhed with truth and juſtice to
his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, and may all contribute to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire him with a true
remorſe and ſincere repentance: if dead, it can neither hurt him, nor any
that belong to him<note n="*" place="bottom">The doctor is long ſince dead,
and, I am ſorry to ſay, hath left a character behind him that reflects no
great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to his cloth, and may eaſily, among thoſe that knew him,
juſtify what I have already ſaid, and ſhall be farther obliged to mention
in the ſequel; he was not many years older than I when I firſt came
acquainted with him, and I ſoon perceived him to be a man of no ſmall
ambition, though he was ſo far from having any of the generous
diſpoſition which is moſtly known to accompany it, that he was no leſs
a ſlave to avarice: witneſs his arrogating to himſelf the credit as well
as advantage of that excellent treatiſe, intituled, A Modeſt Enquiry after
Moral Virtue, for which he obtained from the preſent biſhop of London a
very good living in Eſſex; but which the real and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy author, a poor
epiſcopal clergyman in Scotland, ſince obliged him publickly to diſown
and diſclaim in print, as well as to compromiſe with him for the profit of
the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This, together with his malverſation in ſundry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects in
the pariſh of St. Margaret, Weſtminſter, ſtill freſh in people's
memory, obliged him to retire to his new living, where, I am told, he lived
very private, and, I hope, made the beſt uſe of his ſolitude. As
therefore he had long ago loſt his character among all that knew him, or had
heard of his ſhameful actions, I thought myſelf leſs obliged to treat it
with that tenderneſs that I ſhould have done, had he taken more care to
conceal his vile actions from the world.</note>. He <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0401000300:183"/> was,
however, intent upon his purſuit, and ſo aſſiduous in ſending for me,
that ſome of the Dutch miniſters thought fit likewiſe to do the ſame,
and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, as I found afterwards, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile me to their
favourite article of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, by expounding it to me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to
what they call the infralapſarian ſyſtem, which is indeed leſs dreadful
and antiſcriptural; but Mr. Innes eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded me from going
amongſt them, that he might have me wholly to himſelf, and ſeldom failed
at our parting to clap a ſmall piece of Dutch ſilver into my hand, which
proved an effectual bait to me, who was ſtill ſo bad an oeconomiſt of my
poor ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier's pay, and then wanted ſeveral neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, with which
this ſupplied me.</p>
            <p>By this time I began not to be a little tired with a ſoldier's
life, the place was very cold and bleak, the duty hard, and the pay ſo
ſmall, that even they who could make the moſt of it, could but juſt make
ſhift to live on the plaineſt things; ſo that all things conſidered,
there was no likelihood I ſhould make any long oppoſition to his arguments,
eſpecially as he took care to <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0401000300:184"/> back them with very
large promiſes of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my diſcharge, and bringing me into England,
where he made me hope to meet with the greateſt encouragement, and I own that
the proſpect of ſuch a change of life made ſo great an impreſſion
upon me, that he rather found me more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to anſwer his deſign than
was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with prudence, and too ready to be wholly directed by him.
As ſoon as I had given him this aſſurance, he wrote a long letter to the
biſhop of London, wherein he told me he had ſaid ſo many things in my
favour, that he doubted not of my ſoon being ſent for by, and meeting with
the kindeſt reception from him. However, the wiſhed-for anſwer not
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till ſix or ſeven weeks afterwards, gave me an opportunity of
ſeeing farther into his temper, than I had been able to do; his meſſages
to me were gradually leſs frequent, our interviews more cold, as well as our
parting, when he likewiſe with-held his hand from making me the uſual
preſents. This latter I indeed ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed might be owing to his caſh
running lower than uſual; but I have ſeen ſo many <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0401000300:185"/>
inſtances of his nigardneſs, that I have more reaſon to impute it to
that, and partly to his deſpairing of the ſucceſs of his letter; for
whilſt he was in hopes of it, he had taken care to introduce me to ſome
learned gentlemen, miniſters and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, under pretence of examining
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I was capable of giving a ſatisfactory account of my pretended
converſion, and had obtained from ſome of them very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
certificates in my favour, which he took no ſmall pride to ſhew to the
brigadier and to his other acquaintance; but upon the unexpected delay of the
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, he behaved with more coldneſs and indifference, till a jealous
thought ſtarted in his mind, leſt that ſhould encourage ſome of theſe
miniſters, who had expreſſed themſelves in my favour, to take the
bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs out of his hand, and rob him of the credit of his new convert.
This ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion made him all at once alter his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and reſolve to
baptize me with ſuch haſte and ſo little warning, that my ſurprize gave
me no time to conſider what an abominable piece of irreligion I had engaged
myſelf in, though I muſt confeſs, <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0401000300:186"/> to my ſhame;
that had he given me more time to think upon it, yet I have but too much
reaſon to think, his fair promiſes and deluſive proſpects would
eaſily have ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up all my ſcruples and reluctance, upon his
firſt renewal of them.</p>
            <p>This, and ſome other parts of his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, had already
convinced me that a charitable deſign of converting a ſoul was the
fartheſt from his thoughts, and that he was ſo far from believing me to be
what I pretended, that he had ſome time before taken a moſt effectual way
to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince himſelf of the contrary, beyond all poſſibility of doubting.
His ſtratagem, if I may ſo call it, was to make me tranſlate a
paſſage in Cicero de <hi>naturâ deorum,</hi> of ſome length, into
my (pretended) For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſan language, and give it to him in writing; and this I
eaſily did, by means of that unhappy readineſs I had at invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of
characters, languages, &amp;c. But, after he had made me conſtrue it, and
deſired me to write another verſion of it on another paper, his propoſal,
and the manner of his exacting it, threw me into ſuch viſible confuſion,
having had ſo little <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0401000300:187"/> time to excogitate the firſt,
and leſs to commit it to memory, that there were not above one half of the
words in the ſecond that were in the firſt. His deſiring me to conſtrue
this likewiſe, confuſed me ſtill more; eſpecially, when he ſhewed me
the palpable difference. The ſerious air he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed upon it, made me
expect nothing elſe than a total rupture, and his expoſing the impoſture
in the manner I was conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous it deſerved. I was however agreeably (and,
to my ſhame, I ought to add) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and he finding, by this unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
trial, what a memory and readineſs I had, and how qualified I was to carry on
ſuch a cheat, began to clear his brow, and calm the diſorder he had thrown
me into, by a more chearful and friendly look; but did not forget, at the
ſame time, to give me to underſtand, tho' at a great diſtance, that I
ought to take care to be better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the future. I promiſed to take
his advice, and did ſo in part; but was become too indolent to go thro' the
fatigue of forming a whole language, at leaſt till I was convinced that it
would ſtand me in ſome ſtead; though, by what I have tried 
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0401000300:188"/> ſince I came into England, I cannot ſay but I could
have compaſſed it with leſs difficulty than can be conceived, had I been
capable of applying cloſely to it. However, his continuing his aſſiduity
and ſeeming regard for me, at leaſt till the delay of the biſhop's
anſwer, which made him ſuſpend it for ten or twelve days, gave me but too
much reaſon to think, that he had not one jot more of conſcience or
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion than I, tho' older, and a learned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, ſince he made no
ſcruple not only to join in, but to encourage and purſue ſo vile a cheat.
But if he had no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he had at leaſt more worldly pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than
I, in that he laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſome conſiderable preferment for
himſelf; whilſt I, like the ſtupid abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned wretch I had been
hitherto, looked no farther than a little vain ſatisfaction for the
preſent, or, at moſt, a deliverance from the ſoldier's life. For by that
time I could ſee ſo far thro' all his artifices, and different behaviours,
that I did not much depend on any of his other promiſes. And he ſoon after
gave me cauſe to think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not miſtaken in him. For when, upon 
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0401000300:189"/> his bringing me into England, he got him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the
poſt of chaplain-general of the Engliſh forces in Portugal, by the
intereſt of the good biſhop Compton, he not only left me to ſhift for
myſelf, and to bear the brunt of all objections, but was guilty of ſuch
other vile actions, as eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me that he was a more real convert
to Spinoziſm, than I was to him; for I obſerved him often reading that
au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's poſthumous works, tho' he was an utter ſtranger to his ſober
way of living. I had likewiſe a greater opinion of his parts and learning,
than I have ſince found cauſe for, which made me conclude, that I had no
reaſon to be more ſcrupulous than he, and this in a great meaſure quelled
all my ſlight and tranſitory qualms, at leaſt till it came to the
ſolemn puſh.</p>
            <p>I have already hinted, that his fear of being ſupplanted by
ſome other miniſter, made him reſolve to haſten the impious cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
for ſo I thought it, whatever he did; but of this he had appriſed me only
in general terms, and without fixing any time for it, or mentioning how he
deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to perform it, probably that I might <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0401000300:190"/> think
the leſs upon it. Accordingly ſome days paſſed without my ſeeing him,
or at leaſt hearing any thing about it, when one afternoon he ſent his man
to my lodgings, to acquaint me that he had fixed that evening about ſix of
the clock for it, and to deſire me to be ready againſt the time. As I had
hardly three hours to conſider of it, one may eaſily imagine the
ſurpriſe and hurry, the confuſion and dread, it threw me into; and,
indeed, I was ſo divided between the fear of bringing upon myſelf ſome
heavy judgment for ſo impious a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of that divine inſtitution,
and the thoughts, if I ſubmitted to it, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having with ſome proper
decency under all thoſe tumults with which my mind was then agitated, that I
began to wiſh I might have reſolution enough to avoid it, when the dreaded
time was come. But that not only failed me, when I ſaw the governor and
ſeveral other officers and gentlemen going to the chapel, where the mock
cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was to be diſpatched; but the devil, I believe, did then find a way
of calming my conſcience for the preſent, by putting it into my head that
it being to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0401000300:191"/> by a heretic, for ſuch I
then judged, if not all the Proteſtant miniſters, at leaſt ſuch a one
as I now knew my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly guide to be, it could be indeed no ſacrament, nor a
repetition of it. And this confuſed diſtinction I then called to mind from
what I had learned at the ſchools, tho' I was far enough from being
ſatisfied that it was right. What ſalvo he had for himſelf, I can only
gueſs; but, as far as I could perceive, he went thro' the ceremony with a
very compoſed counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and preſence of mind, and ſeeming devotion;
and tho' he only had his Engliſh common-prayer book before him, yet he read
the office all in a good Latin off-hand, as the ſaying is, and without any
heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſoleciſm, as thoſe obſerved who heard him with greater
attention than I was then capable of. For tho' I was a perfect maſter of the
Latin, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced it, as moſt of his countrymen do, in a very
intelligible manner; yet ſuch was my confuſion and hurry of ſpirits, that
I ſcarcely knew or could mind one word he ſaid. And a much greater one, I
dare affirm, I ſhould have been in, had I been <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0401000300:192"/> either
able to attend to the ſolemnity of the office, or had been made acquainted
with it before. But I was an utter ſtranger to every part of it; and it is my
opinion, that he choſe I ſhould be ſo, for he never once ſhewed, much
leſs explained, the leaſt part of it in any of the meetings I gave him at
his lodgings. All I could recollect of the whole, was that I kept up ſo much
preſence of mind, as to appear demure and ſerious all the while, which I
thought very long, and that I was very glad when it was over, and much more
ſo that my abominable hypocriſy had not been detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or rather
puniſhed, by ſome ſevere judgment.</p>
            <p>The name he gave me was that of George Lauder, which was that of
the governor, whom he had prevailed upon to paſs for my godfather; and it was
accordingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the muſter-roll, inſtead of that of Salmanazar,
which I had till then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to. This new name and ſurname, joined to
ſome congratulations then given me, and a preſent of a piſtole from the
governor, made me, for ſome time, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the heavy guilt I had plunged
myſelf <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0401000300:193"/> into. But this calm proved but ſhort, and the
delay of the biſhop's anſwer, and much more Mr. Innes's coldneſs and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, after he had once made ſure of me, ſoon brought me to repent
of my wicked compliance, as I then judged it, though not ſo much from a
ſenſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as becauſe I did not look upon my vanity and ambition
ſufficiently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed for the atrocious guilt I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; and
this the reader will the better judge by what follows.</p>
            <p>The long expected letter came at length; it was full of
commendations to Mr. Innes for his zeal, beſides a very kind invitation to me
from that worthy prelate, to come over into England. I was by that time ſo
weary of a ſoldier's life, that I ſhould have readily come upon a leſs
promiſing proſpect than that which he now began again to feed my ſanguine
hopes with. Some things he talked to me quite incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with what, as I
before hinted, he knew of me, and which of courſe could be no temptations to
me, unleſs I was baſe enough to add ſtill more weight to my guilt; of
this kind in particular was what <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0401000300:194"/> he mentioned to me of a
deſign of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to Oxford, to teach the Formoſan language to a
ſet of gentlemen, who were afterwards to go with me to convert thoſe people
to Chriſtianity, which, if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved any thing of, he muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon my inventing ſuch a language, and involving myſelf in ſtill deeper
guilt; and yet I own, to my ſhame, though I knew not with what view he could
men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuch a propoſal, nor looked upon it but with dread, yet I could
not forbear being much elevated with it, though I was ſtill in hopes that I
might find ſome pretence for ſetting it aſide, and being made uſeful
there in ſome other and more ſuitable way. How I might have behaved in
ſuch a caſe I know not, only I have reaſon to queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether I
ſhould have had integrity and reſolution to have confeſſed the truth,
rather than to have involved myſelf in a ſtill more ſhameful impoſture;
but, as I obſerved before, I knew him too well to rely on any of his fluent
and diſingenuous promiſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0401000300:195"/>The governor, at his requeſt, got me
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, or rather gave my captain ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man in my room, whilſt Mr.
Innes took care to procure a certificate ſigned by that gentleman and a
number of other officers of the garriſon, and even by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral miniſters,
much more in my commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation than I could poſſibly deſerve; after which,
having got all things in order for our departure, we ſet out for Rotterdam,
where he introduced me to ſome perſons of conſideration for piety and
learning, particularly the celebrated Mr. Baſnage, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the
Continuation of the Jewiſh Hiſtory, and likewiſe to ſome of the
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and gentlemen of the Engliſh church, and to ſome of the French
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants there; among whom I was ſo much careſſed, that I begun to
look upon myſelf in a very agreeable and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous light. There were,
however, two things that mortified me not a little, viz. the mean appearance I
made in ſome caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off cloaths, with which Mr. Innes had ſupplied me upon
my leaving off my regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ones, but which were both too big and too long
for me, and the ſhrewd queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0401000300:196"/> put to me by
ſeveral gentlemen, which convinced me that they did not give all the credit I
could have wiſhed, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I gave of myſelf and country. For as to
any real remorſe or concern for the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful part I was acting, I found it
ſit lighter on my mind, in proportion to the many things I met with that
flattered my vanity. The more effectually therefore to remove theſe two
obſtacles to it, I fell upon one of the moſt whimſical expedients that
could come into a crazed brain, viz. that of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon raw fleſh, roots
and herbs; and it is ſurpriſing how ſoon I habituated my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this
new, and, till now, ſtrange food, without receiving the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice in
my health; but I was bleſſed with a good conſtitution, and I took care to
uſe a good deal of pepper, or other ſpices, for a concocter, whilſt my
vanity, and the people's ſurprize at my diet, ſerved me for a reliſhing
ſauce.</p>
            <p>We embarked at the Brill for England in the packet-boat, and in
our paſſage had ſuch a dreadful ſtorm, that as many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
and among them Mr. Innes, got into the long boat, as it could well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. 
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0401000300:197"/> They all ſhewed an uncommon dread in their looks,
whilſt I, who ſtaid behind, beheld them with a kind of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid unconcern,
rather than a generous pity, every moment in danger of meeting with that
dreadful end they had endeavoured to avoid; yet, terrible as the ſight was,
it hardly raiſed in me one ſerious reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the more
dangerous deſign I was unhappily embarked in, or the more dreadful
ſhipwreck I had expoſed myſelf to, that of the ſoul; or if any ſuch
thoughts came then into my mind, they were ſoon diſpelled at our landing at
Harwich, and at the pleaſing proſpect with which Mr. Innes had flattered my
ambition and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. At my arrival at London, Mr. Innes, and ſome worthy
clergymen of his acquaintance, introduced me to the biſhop of London, by whom
I was received with great humanity, and got ſoon after a good number of
friends among the clergy and laity, moſt of them perſons of piety and
worth. But I had a much greater number of oppoſers to combat with, who put me
under a neceſſity of having my ſenſes and memory about me more than
ever, to avoid <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0401000300:198"/> a fatal detection; for I had been ſo
negligent, notwithſtanding Mr. Innes's caution of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared, againſt
exigencies, with a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and a prudent readineſs at reading and writing
my new invented character, that had I been attacked on that ſide, I muſt
have been infallibly foiled; but they took a contrary way, and though they
judged rightly of me in the main, yet I can ſafely affirm, that they have
been very far from being candid, or even juſt in the account of the
diſcoveries they pretended to have made, to my diſadvantage; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
Drs. Halley, Mead and Woodward; and as I had then ſeveral zealous patrons of
great candor and integrity, who made it their buſineſs to ſearch into the
bottom of thoſe reports, they found ſo much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry and
diſingenuity in them, that I cannot but obſerve here, that the too
viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eagerneſs of theſe gentlemen to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me, at any rate, for a
cheat, ſerved only to make the more ſerious and candid part think the
better of me, and to look upon me as a kind of confeſſor, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as
the three gentlemen abovementioned, but more particularly the firſt, were
known <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0401000300:199"/> to be no great admirers of the Chriſtian
revelation, to which my patrons thought I had given ſo ample a teſtimony.
My complexion, indeed, which was very fair, appeared an unanſwerable
objection againſt me; there being but few ſuch to be met with in thoſe
hot climates, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that of Formoſa, which lies under the tropic; but
by the help of what I had read or heard of ſome of thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, I
ſoon hatched a lucky diſtinction between thoſe whoſe buſineſs
expoſes them to the heat of the ſun, and thoſe who keep altogether at
home, in cool ſhades, or apartments under ground, and ſcarce ever feel the
leaſt degree of the reigning heat. And this diſtinction indeed is not only
very reaſonable, but was afterwards confirmed by perſons of candor and
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, who had been in thoſe countries, and affirmed that they had
ſeen perſons as fair as any northern Europeans, tho' not in ſo great a
number, that lived under the rays of a vertical ſun.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, my oppoſers were as much at a loſs how to
find out my real country, either by my idiom, or my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation 
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0401000300:200"/> of the Latin, French, Italian, or any other language I
was maſter of. For though this may appear an eaſy thing to be done, by
thoſe who are acquainted with the European languages, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
pronunciations peculiar to every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet both my idiom and pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were ſo mixed and blended, and I may ſay deſignedly ſo, by the many
lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages I had learned, and nations I had been converſant with, that it was
impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the moſt curious judge to diſcover in it any thing like
an uniform likeneſs to any other European one they knew of. Dr. Mead, indeed,
took upon him to be very poſitive from both, that I was of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther German or
Dutch extract; he could not have pitched upon a more unlikely one, ſeeing the
Dutch idiom and language were the only one I was the leaſt acquainted with,
and accordingly ſome of my friends, who were better judges of ſuch matters,
and could plainly ſee that mine was more oppoſite to them than to any
other, did freely cenſure him for it, and tell him he might as well have
affirmed me to be an Ethiopian from my complexion, as a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man 
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0401000300:201"/> from my pronunciation. But the truth was, I knew enough
of all of them to blend my diſcourſe more or leſs with any of them, as
either to put people up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wrong ſcent, whilſt I kept every one from
getting into the right one; for I can ſafely ſay that I never met with, nor
heard of any one, that ever gueſſed right, or any thing near it, with
reſpect to my native country.</p>
            <p>I might here add ſeveral viſible advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which my friends
might juſtly take in my defence, and among them a great number of
ſcandalous falſhoods diſperſed abroad from what quarter I know not, of
which thoſe, who were better acquainted with me, knew me to be wholly
innocent, as well as crimes. I was naturally averſe to, ſuch as drinking,
gaming, &amp;c. for, bating my vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous foible, which, though I could not
overcome, I took ſuch care to conceal from them by the moſt oppoſite
behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, my converſation was ſuch as the moſt cenſorious could not
have blamed, but which my friends highly admired in me. The plainneſs of my
dreſs and diet, <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0401000300:202"/> the little trouble I gave myſelf
about worldly wealth, preferment, or even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring or ſecuring a bare
competency, a good-natured and charitable diſpoſition, viſibly natural to
me, my averſeneſs to drinking, lewd women, &amp;c. and a great
reſervedneſs to ſuch of the fair ſex as had either loſt their
reputation, though they lived ſtill in credit and ſplendor, and even to
thoſe who betrayed too ſmall a regard for their character, the
converſation of whom I profeſſedly avoided, though againſt my own
intereſt, not indeed ſo much from a principle of virtue, as an affectation
of it; theſe, together with the warmth I natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally expreſſed for
religion, and the real delight I took in the public offices of it, appeared
ſuch convincing proofs of my ſincerity, that thoſe of my friends, to whom
I was moſt intimately known, were the moſt impatient, and diſpleaſed to
have it called in queſtion; for who could imagine, as they often urged, that
a youth of ſo much ſenſe and learning for his years, ſo ſeemingly
free from am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and other vices, could be abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enough to be guilty of
ſuch abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0401000300:203"/> an impoſture and impiety, for the
ſake of a little plain, homely food and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beyond which he neither
makes the leaſt effort, or ſeems to have the leaſt wiſh.</p>
            <p>I am aware that what I have ſaid in the laſt paragraph, will
ſo far carry the face of my once favourite vanity, that it will be
cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by ſeveral of my readers as a rank piece of oſtentation, rather
than a ſincere acknowledgment of my guilt; tho' a more candid one, who joins
both parts of it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, will rather ſee, that the diſplay of the one,
is only the greater aggravation of the other. But as neither was the motive of
what I have there ſaid, but rather to do juſtice to thoſe friends of mine
who ſo kindly took my part on that account, I had much rather undergo
cenſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt myſelf, than to have omitted any thing that can
vindicate their character, and convince the world that the zeal they
expreſſed for me, was really the effect of a moſt candid and charitable
conſtruction on a life ſo ſeemingly innocent and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted, and
not owing to any raſh or blind prepoſſeſſion, or to an unreaſonable
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0401000300:204"/> oppoſition againſt my cenſurers, much leſs to
diſhoneſt connivance with any views or deſigns of mine; when I am very
ſure, that if they had had any well-grounded ſuſpicion of my being what I
was, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, they would have been the firſt who would not only have
expoſed me to the world, but would have become my moſt irreconcileable
enemies. And I thought myſelf the more obliged, in juſtice as well as
gratitude, to ſay thus much in their vindication; becauſe ſome of them,
men of probity and learning, undertook to be my advocates in print, and not
only complained of thoſe aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo freely and unjuſtly caſt
upon me, but even challenged my accuſers, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral advertiſements
publiſhed in the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Gazzette, to prove any of them againſt me, or to
produce any one ſolid proof or objection againſt the account I had given of
myſelf. Notwithſtanding, which cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable efforts on my behalf, and the
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did vindication they printed ſome months after, both they and I had the
mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to find (and I have had ſince great reaſon to bleſs God
for it) that my fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0401000300:205"/> account was as much
diſcredited by the greateſt part of the world as ever; which proved an
effectual means, in time, to bring me, thro' his mercy, to a deeper ſenſe
of my folly and impiety, than I could have been, if that had gained a more
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral credit.</p>
            <p>There was likewiſe a variety of judgments formed about me, by
thoſe who thought me a cheat. Thoſe of the church of Rome believed I was
bribed to that impoſture by ſome Engliſh miniſters, on purpoſe to
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their church. The Proteſtants in Holland were much of the ſame
mind; but added, that I was farther hired to explode their doctrine of
predeſtination, and cry up the epiſcopacy of the church of England, in
derogation of their Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian government. Here ſome repreſented me as
a jeſuit or prieſt in diſguiſe, others as a tool of the nonjurors,
becauſe Mr. Innes had introduced me among a ſet of them, particularly the
famed Mr. Leſley, of whoſe writings, as well as inſtructive and facetious
company, I was very fond; and I may add, that their converſation had not a
little biaſſed me to their principles, <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0401000300:206"/> eſpecially
as I found them ſo conformable to the ſchool divinity I had learned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
ſea, tho' it never affected me ſo far as to go to any of their meetings.
How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the reader may ſee, by what I have ſaid hitherto, that all
theſe various opinions were but random ſhots, and without any foundation.
And indeed my caſe was ſo intricate and perplexing, that it was next to
impoſſible for the ableſt heads to have gueſſed what my motives were,
or for what, or by whom, I was induced thus to impoſe upon mankind. And I am
fully perſuaded, that my being wholly innocent of any ſuch vile deſigns,
either againſt the church or ſtate, or of being employed by the enemies of
either, was the cauſe of my diſappointment turning ſo much to my
advantage, which might otherwiſe have been attended with a more fatal and
ſhameful cataſtrophe; and that the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judge of all hearts, knowing
mine to be actuated only by mere youthful folly and vanity, without any other
dangerous or guilty deſign, than the indulging a wild and phrantic
paſſion (which was grown too powerful for me to reſiſt, with that 
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0401000300:207"/> little ſhare of reaſon and experience I was then
maſter of, and with theſe diſadvant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages and temptations I laboured
under) did, in his great pity, prevent my going on and periſhing under ſuch
a load of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented guilt, and I accordingly deſire to be ever thankful for
that great and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved inſtance of his divine mercy and goodneſs.
And, next to my humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of it, I do think myſelf bound to
declare thus ſolemnly, that I never was ſet upon, nor directly or
indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly inticed, by any ſet of men for any private ends, to act the part
I did, except what I have lately related of Mr. Innes's encouragements and
promiſes to me, in which I am very well ſatisfied he had no other ends to
ſerve, but that of his own private intereſt and advancement.</p>
            <p>I am far enough however from reflecting upon, or bearing any
reſentment againſt thoſe who looked upon me as a tool of ſome
deſigning ſet of men, engaged in ſome private deſign. It was not
natural to ſuppoſe that ſuch a young, and, in all appearance, as well as
reality, raw and unexperienced fellow, could of his own <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0401000300:208"/>
head have imbarked in ſuch an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and carried it on ſo long, and
with ſuch boldneſs and ſucceſs, as to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to himſelf ſo
many zealous patrons among men of character for learning and probity, unleſs
he had been privately ſet upon, inſtructed, and ſupported in it, by
ſome deſigning perſons of more years, diſcretion, and abilities, tho'
from what quarter was not eaſy to gueſs, either from my behaviour,
writings, or any view they could perceive me in purſuit of. As for thoſe
who took me for a jeſuit, prieſt, or emiſſary from Rome, they were
certainly the wideſt from the mark. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that church were always
my moſt ſtrenuous oppoſers, and not without cauſe, as they could be
very ſure that whatever deſign or errand I might be embarked in, it could
not be in favour of it; and had my fabulous account met with that credit which
it muſt be ſuppoſed was expected, it muſt have done their cauſe more
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice than any private deſign I might carry on could have done
good. Beſides, it was viſible I ſhunned their company as much as
poſſible, tho' my motive for it, <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0401000300:209"/> the
conſciouſneſs of my own guilt, was not ſo apparent. I never converſed
with any of them, but in the jarring and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſial way; and, tho' at
that time much againſt my conſcience, was a ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous oppoſer of their
particular doctrines, both in converſation and writing. I never once entered
into any of their chapels, (nor have ſince, all the time I have been in
England) neither did I ſhew the leaſt favour or partiality towards them.
This was indeed rather looked upon as an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, ſaid to be very uſual
and common amongſt them, it being urged as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a long
ſtanding, that thoſe diſguiſed emiſſaries affected to appear the
moſt outrageous enemies of that cauſe they were privately carrying on.
Whether the fact be true or not, I can only ſay, that I never knew of any
ſuch but by hearſay; neither am I any farther concerned about it, than to
ſay, that I was the fartheſt from being one of that ſort, and that
whatever I have ſaid or written againſt that church, was only with a view
of gaining credit to myſelf, without any view of ſerving or hurting it, or
indeed caring which of the <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0401000300:210"/> two was likely to be the
reſult. For tho' all the arguments I had heard or read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and in
which I was not a little verſed, had not yet been able to wipe off the
prejudices of my education, which I had imbibed under the jeſuits and
domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans, of its being, if not the only ſaving church as they affirm it to
be, yet, at leaſt, of its not being ſo bad and corrupt, ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and
damnable a one as ſome Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, with more zeal than charity, have
repreſented it, under the odious titles of Anti-chriſt, whore of Babylon,
&amp;c. never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, my youth and inconſiderate vanity would not ſuffer
me to enquire whether or no, or how far, I incurred a guilt in my oppoſing
and expoſing it.</p>
            <p>It was likewiſe from the ſame ſhameful motive of vanity that
I pretended, from my own knowledge, not only to confirm but aggravate the black
account which authors had publiſhed againſt the jeſuits and other
miſſionaries, eſpecially with regard to their boaſted converſions and
ſucceſs in the Eaſt-Indies, and more particularly concerning the cauſe
of the perſecution raiſed againſt the Chriſtians in Japan; when all
that I <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0401000300:211"/> knew of it was only from reading or hear-ſay.
And as to the Jeſuits, though I was then and am ſtill ſenſible that
ſome of their maxims, tenets, and politics, do juſtly deſerve to be
condemned; yet I was far enough from having ſuch diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous notions
of that ſociety, as the world ſeems generally to have of it, and much
leſs from any thing I had ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved among them, conſidering how
young I was when I left them, and how cloſe and recluſe they keep
themſelves from the reſt of the world. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they deſerve the
diſadvantageous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter they have, or not, which is beſt known to him,
to whom both they and every man is to give an account at the laſt great day,
it is incumbent upon me thus far to do them juſtice, as to own, that thoſe
reflexions I have caſt upon their miſſionaries in China and Japan, had no
other foundation than common report, without any enquiry whether that was true
or falſe; ſo far was I from having any juſt or real reaſon for
confirming or ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating it. As for the reſt of the prieſts of that
church, as far as I was capable of <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0401000300:212"/> judging of them, in
thoſe juvenile days in which I was more intimately converſant with
ſeveral of them, I can only ſay, with the common voice, that there are good
and bad among them, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to a much higher degree than I have had
occaſion to obſerve of thoſe of any other church. One thing I can truly
ſay, however, to their praiſe, that they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally take greater care to
inſtruct their youth in matters of religion, and to oblige them all to
aſſiſt at their catechetical lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on Sundays in the afternoon. The
misfortune was, that we had no books to learn them by heart beforehand, but the
prieſt was forced by repetitions to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them in our memories; whence
it followed, that thoſe who were wanting either in attention or memory, went
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way little the better for the pains he took with them. As for me, I never
failed coming, becauſe my memory being very tenacious, and my apprehenſions
pretty quick, I could carry an anſwer of any length at once or twice
repeating, ſo that I was moſtly the firſt interrogated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no
ſmall commendations from our <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0401000300:213"/> inſtructors,
eſpecially as I was one of the youngeſt, and was as ready at thoſe
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers on the next meeting, as if I had thought on nothing elſe all that
time. And as this uſed to make me to be much admired by the numerous
audience, ſo it of courſe failed not to feed me with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret pride, and a
natural fondneſs for all ſuch occaſions of ſhewing my talents.</p>
            <p>The ſame happened to me on my coming firſt into England, when
Dr. Innes, proud of his pretended proſelyte, introduced me into the company
of all the learned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of his acquaintance, that they might hear me
deſcant on the grounds of my converſion; and I was by that time ſo well
verſed in that kind of learning, more from the books I occaſionally read on
that ſubject, than from any pains he had taken to inſtruct me, that I
believe few people of my years, notwithſtanding I had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſo much of
my time, could have ſaid more in defence of the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; all
which was ſufficiently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged with no ſmall commendations and
congratulations, both by all that heard me, and by thoſe who have firſt
read theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0401000300:214"/> in the fictitious book
above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned; for that ſyſtem of religion, and defence of
Chriſtianity, was what I had moſtly extracted out of Limborch, and ſome
other divines, without Dr. Innes's help, or even knowledge, though what follows
there, with reſpect to Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, was wholly his, as may be
ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceived from the difference of ſtyle and method. However, when
all theſe kinds of converſations were ended, my doctor failed not to ſpur
my pride ſtill far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on, by telling me what thoſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſaid in
my commendation, which, whether or not exaggerated by him, gave me ſuch an
extraordinary notion of my parts, that I was proud of every opportunity of
ſhewing myſelf in all companies and public places, without any other view
than that of feeding my natural vanity, whilſt he was privately purſuing
what appeared to him more weighty, the advancing of his fortune, to which end
he ſtrove to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce me, and himſelf by my means, to all the great men
in church and ſtate, which he found no hard matter to do, becauſe, ere I
had been in London three <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0401000300:215"/> months, I had been ſo cried
up for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy, that they were all exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of ſeeing and
converſing with me; and not only the domeſtic, but even the foreign papers,
had helped to blaze forth many things in my praiſe, for which there was not
any foundation. Thus I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a remarkable article from London, printed in
the Dutch and French papers, that the young Japaner had been preſented to the
archbiſhop of Canterbury, who admired him chiefly for his readineſs in
ſpeaking a great variety of languages. Whereas I cannot call to mind that I
ſpoke any but the Latin, which his grace having either forgot, or being
unuſed to my fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign pronunciation, was forced to have interpreted to him,
by Dr. Innes, in Engliſh. So that I found I needed not to be very
ſolicitous to blow my own trumpet, when the common cry, and the public
papers, did it beyond my expectation for me. I had indeed a fluency of the
Latin, and a ſmattering of ſeveral modern lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, as well as a great
readineſs in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, had I applied myſelf to them; but I boaſted
of more knowledge in them <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0401000300:216" rendition="simple:additions"/> by far than I had,
eſpecially in the oriental ones; tho' at that time quite ignorant of
them.</p>
            <p>I had not been two months in London be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the doctor perſuaded
me to tranſlate the church catechiſm into my pretended Formoſan language;
and I, tho' much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my will, was forced, by his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing command,
not only to perform the odious taſk, but to preſent it afterwards to the
biſhop of London, who received and rewarded it with his uſual candor and
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, and laid it up among his other curious manuſcripts, tho' it
rather deſerved to have been condemned to the flames. However, the doctor had
his own views to ſerve, one of which was to confirm me in the good opinion of
that worthy prelate, and of as many other gentlemen as ſhould either ſee or
hear of it. And another, to make me exert my talents in inventing and
familiariſing myſelf to this pretended For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſan language and character,
for fear my want of it ſhould cauſe ſome unexpected diſcovery, at
leaſt before he had got the preferment he was in purſuit of. When I had
finiſhed the pretended verſion, he not <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0401000300:217"/> only examined
it himſelf carefully, but got other perſons to do the ſame, who all found
the language ſo regular and gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, as well as different from all
others they knew, both with reſpect to the words and idiom, that they gave it
as their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it muſt be a real language, and could be no
counterfeit, much leſs have been invented by ſuch a ſtripling as I; and
hence ſome of thoſe of my oppoſers, who thought me a Romiſh prieſt in
diſguiſe, imagined that I had been aſſiſted in, or taught it, by
ſome of the fraternity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ſea. I ſhould have obſerved, that I had
taken care to write it in one column in Roman character, with an interlineal
Latin verſion in Italick, and in my invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed character on the oppoſite
column.</p>
            <p>As he found me to ſucceed ſo well in this vile piece of
invention, he ſoon after pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon me to write the hiſtory of
Formoſa, and got ſeveral of his and my acquaintance to back the motion, as
a thing which would bring much credit and profit to me, and be very acceptable
to the public. One might have imagined, that a taſk ſo arduous and
dangerous would have ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0401000300:218"/> ſuch a raw young
fellow as I was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then ſcarce twenty years old, and ſo very great a
ſtranger to theſe countries. I had indeed got ſome imperfect notions from
a few books that had fallen in my way, as well as from converſation with
thoſe who had either been in thoſe parts, or had read more about them than
I, but was forced to hatch many things out of my own fertile fancy, to ſupply
the defects of my knowledge. One thing I found a great help and relief from,
that the accounts we then had of that iſland from Candidus, a Dutch
miniſter, who had reſided there, and from the reſt of the writers who had
in ſome meaſure copied him, were ſtuffed with ſuch monſtrous
abſurdities and contradictions, and that the place upon the whole was ſo
very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Europeans, even to thoſe who had been in China, Japan,
and other parts of that country, that I might the more eaſily make whatever I
ſhould ſay of it, to paſs current with the generality of the world. So
that without much he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation I undertook the work, and reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with
myſelf to give ſuch a deſcription <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0401000300:219"/> of it as
ſhould be wholly new and ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſhould in moſt particulars
claſh with all the accounts other writers had given of it; particularly that
it belonged to Japan, contrary to what all other writers and travellers have
affirmed of its being ſubject to China. And this I was left to hammer out of
my own brain, without any other aſſiſtance than that of Varenius's
deſcription of Japan, which Dr. Innes put into my hands, to get what I could
out of it. All this while both he and the book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers were ſo earneſt
for my diſpatching it out of hand, whilſt the town was hot in expectation
of it, that I was ſcarcely allowed two months to write the whole,
notwithſtanding the many avocations I had by frequent viſitors, and
invitations abroad. So that it is no wonder the thing came out ſo crude,
imperfect, and abſurd, and more ſo would it have been, had not the
perſon, who engliſhed it from my Latin, aſſiſted me to correct many
more and greater improbabilities, which I had not had time to diſcover: but
he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was hurried on by the bookſellers, and had the fewer
opportunities of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0401000300:220"/> me on that head.
Beſides, there was one maxim I could never be prevailed upon to depart from,
viz. that whatever I had once affirmed in converſation, tho' to ever ſo few
people, and tho' ever ſo improbable, or even abſurd, ſhould never be
amended or contradicted in the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Thus having once, inadvertently in
converſation, made the yearly number of ſacrificed infants to amount
eighteen thouſand, I could never be perſuaded to leſſen it, though I
had been often made ſenſible of the impoſſibility of ſo ſmall an
iſland loſing ſo many males every year, without becoming at length quite
depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, ſuppoſing the inhabitants to have been ſo ſtupid as to
comply with, or the prieſts inhuman enough to have exacted ſuch a number of
human victims. I muſt moreover obſerve here, that my friends found ſtill
a much weightier objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my account, viz. how ſuch a
ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as I muſt be when I left that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (for being then but near
twenty years of age I could not be ſuppoſed to have been above fifteen or
ſixteen, upon my pretended coming away) could give ſuch 
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0401000300:221"/> a large and particular account of it, as could hardly
have been expected from a man of twice my age. Many of them were hence inclined
to impute what was ſo liable to objection in my narrative to my want of years
and experience, which might make me the more liable to miſtake. This, though
a very candid excuſe for me, I was not inclined to admit of, and therefore,
to abate the wonder, was forced, by Dr. Innes's advice, to aſſume three
years more than I had, and to pretend I was nineteen years when I came away,
and between twenty-two and twenty-three at the writing of the book; more than
that had I pretended to be, my face, air, and behaviour would have given me the
lye, for in that only reſpect did I appear what I really was, a raw, young,
hot-headed and inconſiderate ſtripling. However, theſe monſtroſities,
as I may juſtly call them, which gave me ſo much trouble to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
afterwards, both in company and in a new preface to the ſecond edition of
that vile romance, have really, ſince I came to be in a better mind, proved
no ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to me, ſince they have been an effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual 
<pb n="22O" facs="tcp:0401000300:222"/> means of diſcrediting the whole rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſaved
me the trouble and ſhame of doing it in print, eſpecially during the life
of many of my worthy friends, who, from a real principle of candor and charity,
had publicly engaged in my quarrel, and to whom ſuch an open acknowledgment
muſt have given the greateſt mortification; ſo that though I was come by
that time to abhor the impoſture, yet I contented myſelf with owning it
only to ſome of my moſt intimate friends; and in other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, when
queſtioned about it, with turning the ſubject in ſuch manner as ſhould
give them to underſtand, that I was aſhamed to enter farther into it.</p>
            <p>The firſt edition had not been long pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed before it was
all ſold, and a new one demanded, with ſuch alterations and vindication of
the old one as might moſt likely promote the ſale, and ſatisfy at once
the curioſity of the public, and the avarice of the proprietor; for, as to
me, I had only the ſmall ſum of ten guineas for the copy of the firſt,
and twelve more for the improvements in the ſecond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſuch
preſents as were made me by <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0401000300:223"/> the generous few to whom I
preſented them. But before I ventured on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, I was ſent by the
good biſhop of London, and my other friends, to Oxford, to purſue ſuch
ſtudies as I was fit for, or inclined to, whilſt my oppoſers and
advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates were diſputing here about the merit or demerit of the firſt. And
when I came to the univerſity, I found many learned and worthy friends as
warmly engaged for, as others were againſt me; and with this ſeeming
advantage on my ſide, at which I have had frequent occaſion to bluſh,
that the former were men of the beſt character for candor and probity, as
well as learning and parts, and whom, for that very reaſon, I forbear, as I
ought, to name, their partiality for me being the mere effect of too
extenſive a charity and generoſity, and which only expoſed them to the
ſarcaſms and ridicule of my oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents.</p>
            <p>However that be, I had a convenient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment aſſigned me in
one of the moſt conſiderable colleges by the worthy head of it, a man in
high reputation for his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and univerſal skill in all polite
litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0401000300:224"/> and eſteemed one of the moſt
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed gentlemen of his age. I was not, indeed, immatriculated, for
reaſons ſcarce worth troubling the world with, but had all the other
advantages of learning which that college or the univerſity could afford me,
either by acceſs to the public and private libraries, or by acquaintance with
ſome of the learned in ſeveral other colleges as well as our own, and in
this laſt I had, moreover, a very worthy and learned tutor aſſigned me,
who not only gave me leave to aſſiſt at all the lectures he read to his
other pupils, ſome of whom were gentlemen of high birth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and
greatly advanced in learning, but allowed, and even invited me to make ſuch
objections as my mind ſuggeſted to me, or even to chuſe the ſubject of
our entertainment, whether the Newtonian phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, logic, poetry, or
divinity; which laſt was, of all others, my favourite one, as well as in a
great meaſure his, for he took orders ſoon after I left Oxford.</p>
            <p>As to the mathematics, in which he was alſo well ſkilled,
though I had a great opinion of that ſtudy, yet could I never 
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0401000300:225"/> be prevailed to go over the threſhold; and the
needleſs demonſtrations, as I then thought them, to many of Euclid's
propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, which appeared to me ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſuch as that the lines
that are drawn through a circle, are longer or ſhorter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their
nearneſs or diſtance from the centre, and others of the like nature,
ſeemed to me rather trifling than ſerious or uſeful, and I could never
have the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to be better informed. Hiſtory, eſpecially ancient
chronology, &amp;c. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo dark, intricate and liable to ſuch
unſurmountable difficulties, that I never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to meet with any
ſatisfaction in them, worth the time and pains they would coſt to learn,
ſo that I was a long while before I could be induced to read Scripture
hiſtory, neither did I begin to be converſant in it till I came to have a
taſte for the Hebrew tongue, which was not till many years after, and that by
mere accident, as I ſhall ſhew in the ſequel. Church muſic, which was
then in great perfection by the encouragement which the worthy dean of
Chriſt-Church gave it, as well as by ſeveral of his excellent
compoſitions in <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0401000300:226"/> that kind, was the main thing that
capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated my vain roving fancy, and took up moſt of my ſpare hours,
though I was not a little aſhamed to ſee what drunken, idle ragamuffians
compoſed almoſt every choir there, and with what indolence, to call it by
no worſe a name, they performed their parts, except on ſome more ſolemn
occaſions than ordinary, as when the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or ſome perſons of
diſtinction, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the Divine worſhip. The even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I commonly
ſpent with ſome ſelect company, but without drinking to exceſs, or even
to a degree of exhilaration, which I neither wanted nor was inclined to, and at
the uſual hour of nine retired to my apartment. But here to make a ſhew, at
leaſt, of retrieving the time I waſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the day-time in company,
mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, &amp;c. I uſed to light a candle, and let it burn the greateſt
part of the night in my ſtudy, to make my neighbours believe I was plying of
my books; and ſleeping in my eaſy chair, left the bed often for a whole
week as I found it, to the great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of my bed-maker, who could hardly
imagine how I could live with ſo little <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0401000300:227"/> ſleep, and
without the uſual benefit of bed refreſhment. Had I not been bleſſed
with a ſtrong conſtitution, ſeaſoned moreover by two years fatigues in
the army, and by my living moderate and low, I might perhaps have felt the
ſad effects of ſuch an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, and I don't know but my
appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of it might be one main motive that induced me to make a ſhew
of it, in order to give it the greater merit; for I began to pretend to have
ſwelled legs and feet, and a gouty kind of diſtemper, which my friends
failed not to attribute to that, and earneſtly intreated me to ſubmit to
more regular hours and method of reſt. They likewiſe prevailed upon me to
go and drink ſome medicinal waters at a ſmall diſtance from the city, it
being then the ſeaſon, and a good deal of company of both ſexes
reſorting to it; but as I knew myſelf to ſtand in no need of any of
thoſe helps, I went thither only twice or thrice, rather for the ſake of
the company, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and muſic; but as my pretended lameneſs gave me
a kind of gravity, which I was not willing to part with, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to
keep up to the one without the <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0401000300:228"/> other, I went ſtill
limping about like an old gouty fellow, though no man could enjoy a better
ſhare of health and flow of ſpirits than I did all the time I ſtaid
there.</p>
            <p>It were a ſhame for me to tell how idly I ſpent moſt of my
time, and how little progreſs I made in ſuch a place, company, and among
ſuch noble libraries, and learned acquaintance; for, excepting thoſe
lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which I heard from my tutor, moſt of what I got was by
converſation, but little or nothing by reading, except in books of
controverſy, almoſt the only ones that could captivate my roving mind.
Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it was during my ſhort abode here, (ſcarcely ſix months) that I
employed my leiſure hours in correcting and reviſing my romance of
Formoſa, and wrote the beſt anſwer I could to the objections that had
been made to the firſt edition, in a ſecond preface, which, all things
conſidered, met with much greater approbation than it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, from
thoſe few intimates I had ſhewed it to; after which, taking my leave of all
my friends there, I ſet out for London, where I ſoon after publiſhed that
ſecond <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0401000300:229"/> edition. At my coming to my old lodgings in
Pall-Mall, where Dr. Innes and I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly lodged, I was told that he was
gone over chaplain-general to the Engliſh forces in Portugal. I had no
reaſon to regret his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, for he had, before I went to Oxford, been
guilty of ſuch notorious and barefaced immoralities, as well in this as in a
former lodging in the Strand, both thoſe of ſober and reputable families,
that his character had greatly ſuffered by it, and he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, juſt time
enough to ſave himſelf the mortification of being ſhamefully turned out
of this laſt, as he had been out of the former. Had I been, indeed, a real
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert from heatheniſm to Chriſtianity, it might have been truly ſaid
of him, what our Divine Maſter ſaid of the Phariſees, compaſſing
ſea and land to gain a proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte, and making him ten times more wicked
than themſelves; and he hath been more than once ſeverely reproved by his
acquaintance, for the ſcandalous example he gave to me in particular, who was
admired by them for the contrary virtues. The truth is, he had an almoſt
inſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able propenſity to wine and women, and <pb n="228" facs="tcp:0401000300:230"/>
when fraught with the former, fell immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately foul on the latter, whether
maids or married, not ſcrupling to uſe even vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; which I particularly
mention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his behaviour in theſe, and ſeveral other reſpects,
to ſay nothing of what I have hinted in a former note, gave me but too much
cauſe to think that he had no real regard to religion, either natural or
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; ſo that had I not been happily reſtrained by Divine Grace, his
example would not have failed to have extinguiſhed all ſenſe of remorſe
which accompanied every indirect action I did, and confirmed me in downright
infidelity, in which caſe I might never have been ſo happily made
ſenſible of the error of my ways, as I have ſince been, nor ever repented
of them, till it had been too late. I have therefore great reaſon to
acknowledge it the greateſt mercy that could befal me, that I was ſo well
grounded in the principles and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Chriſtian religion, that
nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the converſation of the then free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkers, as they loved to ſtile
themſelves, and by many of whom I was ſeverely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked, nor the writings
of a Hobbs, Spinoſa, <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0401000300:231"/> Toland, Collins, Tindal, &amp;c.
againſt the truth of Divine revelation, could appear to me in any other light
than as the vain ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of a dangerous ſet of men to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn a religion,
the beſt founded, and moſt judiciouſly calculated to promote the peace
and happineſs of mankind, both tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eternal; I muſt own, that the
ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry which perpetually runs thro' their writings, like the warp
through the woof, gave me but too much cauſe to ſuſpect their
ſincerity, and that the inveteracy they ſhew againſt the nobleſt
ſyſtem of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that ever could be thought of, to which all their
united force could never ſubſtitute any thing better, or near ſo good, is
but a ſorry proof of their pretended love to truth, and to the good of
mankind, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when I conſidered how fully and frequently their
writings have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and exploded by better hands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other
viſible effect than that of their trumping up the ſame old trite argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in ſome new dreſs, and claiming a freſh victory from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0401000300:232"/>I hope that what I have now wrote will not
be deemed by the candid at leaſt, as deſigned to proclaim my own praiſe,
ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it rather aggravates my guilt that I could act ſuch a notorious
piece of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, contrary to the ſtrongeſt convictions I then felt,
that it was impious and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to God. What I chiefly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it here
for, is only to obſerve, that it was that very conviction (which his good
providence would not ſuffer to be quite extinguiſhed in me, though he
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to be ſo long kept under by the impetuoſity of my wild and
ungovernable vanity) that did at length co-operate with his grace to work in me
an utter abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence both againſt that vile and dangerous paſſion, and
the ſtill viler crimes it had involved me in: for if ſincerity is one of
the moſt eſſential virtues of the goſpel, how abominable muſt ſuch
a long-wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and multifarious diſſimulation appear to a guilty perſon,
when brought to a deep ſenſe of it, however light it might ſeem to him in
the more youthful and inconſiderate part of his life? Thoſe only who have
felt can judge of the ſmart and horror of it, <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0401000300:233"/> under
which nothing could well ſupport them but a ſure reliance on the death and
merits of a Divine Saviour, and a ſincere repentance for, and deteſtation
of it. For as ſuch a happy change can only be the work of Divine Grace, ſo
it gives one a moral and comfortable aſſurance of pardon and acceptance at
the throne of infinite mercy, through the efficacious interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our
common Redeemer and eternal High Prieſt.</p>
            <p>But though I occaſionally mention it here, I would not have it
inferred from thence, that I began ſo ſoon to give way to ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary
a remorſe. I was too young, vain, raſh and thoughtleſs to be any other
way influenced by it, than as it put me upon finding out the moſt
ſenſeleſs excuſes and palliatives, ſuch as every one may eaſily
gueſs at, that hath been, like me, a ſlave to youthful paſſions. So
that above half a ſcore or a dozen years were miſ-ſpent in a courſe of
the moſt ſhameful idleneſs, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and extravagance; ſome ſort of
gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry with the fair ſex, with many of whom, even perſons of fortune
and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of ſenſe, wit, and learning, I was <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0401000300:234"/>
become a great favourite, and might, if I could have overcome my natural
ſheepiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fear of a repulſe, have been more ſucceſsful
either by way of matrimony or intrigue; which I have ſince the more wondered
at, conſidering my great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to women was as ſtrong as my vanity,
and the opportunities ſo many and inviting, and I ſo little ſcrupulous
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the danger or guilt of them; yet I may truly ſay, that hardly any man
who might have enjoyed ſo great a variety, ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged himſelf in ſo
few inſtances of the unlawful kind as I have done. This I am far from hinting
by way of pretence to a greater degree of virtue, of which no man could then
have a leſs ſhare than I; for in thoſe few, wherein I was unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
engaged, but eſpecially one wherein my effection was captivated to an
immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate degree, no man purſued them with more eagerneſs and exceſs
than I did. But I am far enough from being inclined to entertain my reader with
a detail of my ſad irregularities and follies, either in this or other
reſpects, which I have long ſince looked back upon with ſhame and 
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0401000300:235"/> ſorrow; only, with regard to ſuch kind of unlawful
amours, I cannot recal to mind my ſtrong and vehement bias for them, without
thankfully acknowledging that there muſt have been ſome ſecret
provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that kept me from giving ſuch way as I might otherwiſe have
done to the ruin of my health, circumſtances, &amp;c. or my being unwarily
drawn into ſome unhappy marriage, or other ſnares, into which I have
obſerved many a one leſs raſh, extravagant, and inconſiderate than I,
have ſo unhappily fallen into.</p>
            <p>I was led into this ſenſe of God's divine providence towards
me, by ſome (I may ſay) unavoidable obſervations on his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
diſpenſations, in which it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to be miſtaken: one
was, my meeting with an almoſt conſtant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment in my moſt
pleaſing proſpects, my moſt ſanguine expectations and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
projects, whenever the end propoſed was the ſatisfaction of my predominant
paſſion, or the means to attain it were ſuch as my conſcience condemned
as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; ſo that I ſeldom failed of reaping ſome pungent ſhame,
mortification or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0401000300:236"/> where I expected
approbation and applauſe, or with loſſes and poverty, where I looked for
profit or gain. On the other hand, whenever I chearfully entered into any
laudable method of living that offered itſelf, or rather, which the ſame
good Providence threw in my way, I always met with ſurpriſing ſucceſs,
and with ſuch credit and approbation as made me ample amends for the
ſtruggles my pride made againſt it on account of its meanneſs. I ſhall
take the liberty of giving a ſignal inſtance, becauſe it hath an
immediate connection with the impoſture I was ſtill ſtriving to carry on,
and conſequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be expoſed.</p>
            <p>I had been about five or ſix years in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and lived in
ſuch an extravagant and careleſs manner (if not in expences, which were
rather moderate than laviſh, had I been in any laudable way of gaining a
competency, but which for want of that often run me into debt, without any
viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way of extricating myſelf) when a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible way was offered to
me, by one Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenden, of getting money, and credit too, by a white ſort of
Japan which he had <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0401000300:237"/> found out, and was then, in vain,
endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to recommend to the world, tho' it was really a curious ſort of
work. His propoſal was, that I ſhould father, and introduce it, under the
notion of my hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing learned and brought the art from Formoſa; on which
condition, and my putting now and then a hand to the painting, he offered me a
conſiderable ſhare in the profit. I readily agreed to his propoſal, not
only on account of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit we ſuppoſed it would bring, but much more
ſo as it would yield a kind of convincing proof to the fabulous account I had
given of myſelf. We accordingly advertiſed it under the name of White
Formoſan Work; and it was viewed and greatly admired by the curious for its
fine whiteneſs, ſmoothneſs, and hardneſs, and for the beauty of the
other colours painted upon it: notwithſtanding which, and all the extravagant
encomiums we gave it, by far beyond what it really deſerved, and our care and
artifice to conceal its real faults, for ſome it had, we could never make it
ſucceed ſo as to be gainers by it. And though our diſappointment might be
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0401000300:238"/> owing, in ſome meaſure, to the vaſt high price he
rated it at, contrary to my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet I have cauſe to bleſs God it ſo
happily miſcarried, and was forced to quit it; for had the project
ſucceeded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my ſanguine hopes, it would have hardened me only
the more irretrievably in my vile impoſture and ſelf-conceit, but its being
ſo unaccountably blaſted, in ſpite of all our endeavours to puſh it
forward, did not a little contribute to inſpire me with a diſlike to all
ſuch unlawful and diſhoneſt ways of getting of money, though this was not
the immediate reſult of my diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; on the contrary, I grieved at
it, and at ſome other of the like nature, for ſome years, till the
frequency of them made me ſee clearly into the true cauſe of them, and
fully perſuaded me that nothing but an honeſt and ſincere intention,
followed by the uſe of right and lawful means, could be attended with
ſucceſs; for I attempted ſince then ſeveral other means of getting of
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which, though not equally odious as this, were ſtill blameable in me,
by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my incapacity for them, ſuch as the <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0401000300:239"/>
practiſing a kind of empyrical phyſic, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome modern
languages, &amp;c. of which I neither was a ſufficient maſter, nor capable
of a competent application to make myſelf ſo. However, as I was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
diſappointed in them all, and as I had reaſon to think juſtly too, it
ſet me, at length, on a more honeſt and laudable ſcent; and it was not
long before Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence threw That in my way, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my pride nor my
reluctance to a cloſe application, would have ſuffered me to have ſought
after, or even thought of: for a counſellor of Lincoln's-Inn, who brought up
his three ſons and a daughter under his own eye, and had a better opinion of
me by far than I deſerved, ſent for me, and propoſed to me the
inſtructing his ſons in the Latin tongue, and ſuch other branches of
learning, as I ſhould think them capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, at his own chambers. I readily
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the offer, notwithſtanding the ſalary was rather too ſmall for
the charge, as I was to attend them twice a day, and ſpend, at leaſt, three
hours with them every day, and lived at ſome diſtance from him. I was, in
about a year's time, honourably <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0401000300:240"/> diſcharged, upon his
ſending them to be farther educated beyond ſea.</p>
            <p>Soon after this I was recommended to be tutor to a young
gentleman, about eight miles from London: his father, who was an officer in the
army, had kept him for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years at ſome conſiderable ſchools to
little purpoſe, for when I came to him, he could hardly tranſlate one line
out of the plaineſt Latin authors, which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing rather to the
remiſſneſs of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer maſters, than to his want of genius,
reſolved to give him a home education. I found him, however, ſo
unacquainted with every grammar rule, and ſo averſe to begin afreſh with
it, he being then near fifteen years of age, that I was obliged to acquaint his
father with the little hopes I had of him in the literary way, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
the teaching him ſome other branches of learning, for which he ſhewed a
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier genius, and particularly fortification, which, as I formerly hinted, I
had learned from our indolent Jeſuit, and of which I was become a pretty good
maſter, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the army, by ſeeing a good number of
conſiderable fortreſſes in ſeveral <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0401000300:241"/> parts of
Europe, and more particularly by reading Vauban, Cohorn, and other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
authors on the ſubject. My propoſal was readily agreed to both by father
and ſon, and the latter made a conſiderable progreſs in it in a little
time, inſomuch that we had not only gone through all the theory of it, and he
could take any plan of a place, but had likewiſe made a model in clay of a
large fortified city, in which I had contrived to have a ſpecimen of every
thing that related to the art of fortifying, both in the regular and irregular
way, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineering, &amp;c. and which, when finiſhed, was not a little
admired, not only as a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, but likewiſe as a compleat piece of
fortification. The misfortune was, that my ſalary was neither anſwerable,
as I thought, to the pains I took with my pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil (whom I ſtill made, at
proper times, apply himſelf to Latin, and other branches of literature) but
likewiſe, through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance of the father, very ill paid; which made
me ſo much the more uneaſy, as I had contracted ſome debts which I
ſhould have been glad then to have paid with it. This, at length, determined
me <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0401000300:242"/> before the year was quite out, to accept of an offer,
which not only appeared more advantageous, but likewiſe more ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to
my vanity, though it ſo far diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged the gentleman's father, that he
made no ſcruple to refuſe paying me what was ſtill due to me, and to let
me go from him with viſible tokens of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment.</p>
            <p>This happened juſt after the rebellion was broke out in
Lancaſhire and Scotland, anno 1715, on which account new troops were raiſed
every where, and he became ſo conſiderable and fluſh of money, that I
might have made my own terms to have ſtaid with him. But, by that time,
ſome of my friends had prevailed upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor of a regiment of dragoons,
to make me the offer of being clerk to the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as I knew him to be
by far a much finer, and more generous gentleman of the two, nothing could
diſſuade me from accepting it. He could not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, prevail on the other
captains to make me clerk to their troops, that being, as they ſaid, a
perquiſite belonging to the quarter-maſter; but it did not hinder 
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0401000300:243"/> him from retaining me to this, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch
additions to the common ſalary out of his own pocket, as made it near an
equivalent, and the friendſhip and regard he ſhewed me, made me be looked
upon as a fit companion to the reſt of the officers, ſeveral of whom having
had a liberal education at ſome of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, it was not long
before we came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a kind of intimacy; there was, beſides, another thing,
which procured me no ſmall eſteem among them, viz. my becoming very ſoon
acquainted with the clergy and other gentlemen in every place we came to,
eſpecially with the learned and curious, by which means I could introduce
ſuch of our officers to them as were men of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or character, as the
moſt part of them were. But what added ſtill more weight to the reſt was,
that my friend, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, who had often heard me called by the familiar
nick-name of Sir George, in ſome of the families where he had become
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with me, after the peace of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trecht, took it into his head not
only to continue the ſame ſtile to me, but even to give it out, that I had
been knighted by <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0401000300:244"/> queen Anne. This laſt I was indeed
wholly ignorant of, for a long while, and denied it as often as the queſtion
was put to me, but was, however, ſo fond of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the fool's cap,
that rather than fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go it, I uſed to lay a ſtronger claim to it, under
pretence of my birth and family, for I ſtill paſſed current for a
Formoſan, and was as proud as ever of being thought ſo, as it procured me
ſuch an acceſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong perſons of rank and learning, which I likewiſe
made a means of bringing our officers and them into a familiar and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
acquaintance, who might otherwiſe have been more than ordinarily ſhy of
each other at that critical juncture. I might add, that as I was likewiſe a
greater favourite of the fair ſex, than any of the red coats, whom they could
not but look upon with ſome dread at that time, I had frequent invitations
from them, even thoſe of rank and fortune, whoſe curioſity would not
permit them to ſuffer ſo great a ſtranger as I was to come, or even to
paſs ſo near them, without having the pleaſure of ſeeing and
converſing with him, and informing themſelves in all the 
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0401000300:245"/> particulars that related to him. And as I always took
care to behave in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as might gain their eſteem, as well as
admiration, ſo I could the more eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce ſuch of our gentlemen
as bore an unexceptionable character to them, by which means we had the
ſatisfaction of ſpending many a pleaſant day in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the
moſt innocent and agreeable manner, particularly in Lancaſhire, and, after
the ſuppreſſion of the rebellion, where we continued quarters, at Wigan,
War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington and Mancheſter, in which laſt I had, moreover, the opportunity
of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſiting a noble library belonging to the collegiate church,
and well furniſhed with all manner of books that could be purchaſed with
money: for it is endowed with 100l. per ann. to ſupply it with new ones as
they come out, and yet, when I was there, they had above 500l. in bank, and
ſcarce knew how to lay it out, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they were thinking of
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing of ſome of the moſt curious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts. This, I could not
but obſerve to them, was ill judged, conſidering the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of it,
chiefly among tradeſmen, who <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0401000300:246"/> have neither taſte nor
knowledge of ſuch valuable pieces, and the few learned men in that
neighbourhood that could reap any benefit from them, and rather adviſed them
to lay out that income in purchaſing ſuch valuable modern books, as were
yearly publiſhed both in England and out of it, and which, I thought, would
better anſwer the intention of the noble donor. They ſeemed to acquieſce
in what I ſaid; but whether they followed my advice or not, I never enquired
ſince.</p>
            <p>Theſe allurements, ſo ſoothing to my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural vanity, and
our often moving from one county to another, made me ſtay longer in the
regiment than I ought in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or conſcience (had I been capable of
liſtening to either) to have done, conſidering that I was of no ſervice,
but only a dead weight to my friend the major, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moreover as bad an
oeconomiſt as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, would have been glad enough to have been rid of me,
though he never, either in word or carriage, gave me the leaſt hint of it,
but rather the contrary; yet ſome of thoſe friends of mine, who had
recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended me to him at firſt, had more than <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0401000300:247"/> once
adviſed me to eaſe him of ſo expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive a load; yet ſo pleaſed was
I with this wandering and idle kind of life, which gave me an opportunity of
travelling through, and ſeeing, ſo many countries I ſhould otherwiſe
never have been able to ſee, that I could not prevail upon myſelf to leave
the regiment, till it was ordered into Ireland, and then marched as far as
Briſtol with them, and ſaw them embarked for that kingdom: ſo that I had
been, from firſt to laſt, ſomewhat above two years in this wandering kind
of amuſing life, without reaping any other advantage than the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
variety of places and people, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing here and there with ſome
learned men and books, though nothing ſo much with the latter as I might have
done, if my indolence, vanity and the variety of objects which danced before my
eyes, had not diverted me from it.</p>
            <p>Upon my return from Briſtol, I was at no ſmall loſs how to
diſpoſe of myſelf for ſome time, and having had time to rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate upon
my miſ-ſpent time and idle life, was eaſily induced, by ſome of my
friends, to alter my courſe, and, if poſſible, to get 
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0401000300:248"/> into a way of earning a competency by my own induſtry,
rather than live at other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's coſt, or, which was much worſe, on
their charity, which I could not now but look upon myſelf as a moſt
unworthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of; and, as I had a little ſmattering of painting and
drawing, and had I been capable of a proper application, might, with
aſſiſtance, have attained to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable proficiency in it, having
a ſtrong genius for, and no indifferent judgment in it. However, to go the
neareſt and eaſieſt way to work, I reſolved on that of fan painting,
which required leſs time and pains to learn; and had the profit been any
thing anſwerable to my aſſiduity, I could have been contented to have
drudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on with it ſtill. But that buſineſs was then at ſo low and
contemptible an ebb, that, though I lived with a good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily almoſt gratis,
and was early and late at work, yet I found it impoſſible to get a bare
competency by it; notwithſtanding the encouragement ſeveral of my friends
and acquaintance gave me. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, brought me acquainted with a worthy
clergyman; who, thinking the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0401000300:249"/> too mean for a
man of my education and parts, and that I might beſtow my time to much better
purpoſe in ſome kind of laudable ſtudy, particularly that of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
which I had always been moſt fond of and converſant in, engaged to raiſe
a ſubſcription among his acquaintance, by which I might be enabled to
follow my ſtudies with more eaſe. He did it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, to the amount of
between twenty and thirty pounds per ann. which, with the help of a ſmall
addition I got to it, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of a young gentleman in the Latin tongue
and ſome other branches of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, made it a comfortable competency,
eſpecially as I was become, by this time, a better oeconomiſt, and had
fallen into a more frugal way of living.</p>
            <p>But all this while this ſubſcription did lie ſomewhat heavy
on my conſcience, and at ſome particular times gave me no ſmall
unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, inaſmuch as it was founded on a belief of my being a
Formoſan, and a real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to the church of England, which thoſe pious
ſubſcribers had not any doubt of, that I could find, even to their dying
day; for whenever I waited on them, I always met <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0401000300:250"/> with
the kindeſt reception and civil treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that could be wiſhed. This
uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtill increaſed, as I now and then met with ſome people
at their houſes, whoſe behaviour and objections, though not in plain terms,
gave me but too much reaſon to think they had not the ſame charitable
opinion of me; and this put me upon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious indirect means to prevent my
friends being prevailed upon by them to withdraw their benevolence. This made
me often wiſh and pray, that I might but fall into ſome more honeſt way
of living without it, and free myſelf by it from that aggravated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe,
with which I was forced to receive it. But though I was fully perſuaded of
the guilt, yet I was not ſenſibly enough af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it to make an open
confeſſion of it, and how unworthy I was of their charitable opinion and
aſſiſtance; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented myſelf with making ſome reſolutions of
giving up the latter, at leaſt, as ſoon as I could get myſelf into a way
of living without it.</p>
            <p>I became, at length, providentially I may ſay, acquainted with a
perſon who was concerned in various branches relating to 
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0401000300:251"/> the printing trade, and in very good cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.
He was, moreover, a very generous and good-natured gentleman, and I became, in
a little time, ſo great a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, that he could ſcarce paſs a day
without ſeeing and conſulting me about ſome of his affairs; and by his
means I came at laſt to tranſlate books, and to get a comfortable living by
it. It was then I began to perceive, with no ſmall joy, how God bleſſed
my endeavours in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my diligence and honeſty, which made ſo
lively an impreſſion on my mind, that I reſolved never to be concerned in
any works, that were either prophane, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, or of a trifling nature or
ill ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and have accordingly refuſed them whenever they have been
offered to me. From tranſlating of other people's works, I came at length to
print ſome of my own, and with the ſame laudable view, and have found
ſtill more credit and comfort in it, and more cauſe to bleſs the Divine
mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for the wonderful and undeſerved ſucceſs I have ſince met with.
But of theſe I ſhall ſpeak in a more proper place; in the mean time I
ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0401000300:252"/> here, that my charitable
friends, dying one after another, as my buſineſs increaſed, I never
applied to the ſurvivors for a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of their benevolence, but
declined it where it was offered, as being then able to live without it: and I
can only add, that though I once looked upon theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions as no
leſs unworthily beſtowed upon, than baſely received by me, yet I have had
the comfort to obſerve ſince, that they proved the happy means of freeing
me from a more laborious and unprofitable life, and of enabling me to follow
thoſe ſtudies with more eaſe and chearfulneſs, which fitted me, in
time, for thoſe more arduous and beneficial taſks, which I have been
ſince engaged in; ſeeing it was during the greater part of that time, that
I applied myſelf to the Hebrew tongue, and to the more cloſe ſtudy of the
ſacred books; by which means I had an opportunity of making a large
collection of critical and other remarks, which, though deſigned then only
for my own information, came at length to have a place in one of thoſe works
I ſhall ſpeak of in the ſequel, where they have ſince met with the
approbation of the public, both in <pb n="251" facs="tcp:0401000300:253"/> England and abroad;
though even under thoſe encouragements, and with thoſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities I
had, I muſt own, to my ſhame, that I was ſtill fair enough from ſuch a
lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable application, as might have turned them to better advantage; and that
I ſtill miſ-ſpent a great deal of my time in a looſe, careleſs
manner, and that it was not till after a year or two that I diſengaged
myſelf from company, eſpecially of the fair ſex, though, one perſon
excepted, rather trifling than culpable, to follow my books more cloſely. I
ſhall therefore ſkip all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of my time, from the twentieth to
the thirty-ſecond year of my age, as a ſad blank to every thing that was
good or laudable, and fraught with a diſmal variety of folly, indiſcretion
and other miſcarriages, which would rather diſguſt than inform, or even
divert a ſober reader, to come to a more hopeful and inſtructive period;
and only obſerve, before-hand, that it was no ſmall happineſs to me,
(which, to whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever owing, I ought at leaſt to attribute to my own
diſcretion) that the many learned and pious perſons I was formerly, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill, acquainted with, (for it was <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0401000300:254"/> with
ſuch that I moſtly choſe to converſe) were never acquainted with, nor,
as I could perceive, ever ſuſpected me of being guilty of ſuch a
ſhameful, idle and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous way of living, but believed that I ſpent
moſt of my time to better purpoſe; elſe it is not to be doubted but I had
been diſcarded and ſhunned by them. In which caſe I ſhould have
entirely loſt the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means of coming into a better way of
thinking, which their converſation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and the many good books which
they lent me, did at length happily bring me to, and been left, like a
weather-cock, expoſed to all winds: for though I could talk, and, at ſome
ſerious intervals, think as ſeriouſly as they of religion and its moſt
important duties, and even comply with them in ſuch a manner, as ſeemed
very delightful and edifying to them; yet was my roving heart ſo far from
joining ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, or being affected with them, that I could eaſily forego
them, to indulge any new riſing ſatisfaction, though ever ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite.
And indeed, ſuch a frequent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety did offer itſelf naturally in my way,
as I was in no way able to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:0401000300:255"/>Thus, for inſtance, it was natural for
thoſe intimates to introduce or renew ſome old ſubject or topic relating
to my pretended country, travels, converſion, or other ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic part of my
life, which, however irkſome it was then become to me to repeat, and as it
were to confirm anew; yet there was no way for me to avoid it, unleſs I had
at once acknowledged the whole relation to have been a notorious and ſhameful
impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and what a deadly wound muſt have ſuch an unexpected
confeſſion given to my natural vanity? and what a mortification would it
have been, to ſuch ſincere honeſt people, to hear it from my own mouth?
ſo that, could I even have had courage enough to forego the former, as I have
more than once thought and even reſolved to do, yet how could I find it in my
heart to give ſo ſenſible a diſpleaſure to perſons that had ſhewn
ſo much friendſhip and zeal for me? to ſay nothing of the dreadful
apprehenſions of the conſequence of their charitable opinion being thereby
turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a juſt abhorrence and deteſtation. This was the ſad dilemma
I found myſelf in when I came to reflect ſeriouſly on my 
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0401000300:256"/> caſe, and which made me conclude it, all things
conſidered, altogether impoſſible for me to extricate myſelf out of,
without ſome miraculous power to aſſiſt me to overcome a paſſion,
which had hitherto eluded all the oppoſition which my reaſon and
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience had been able to raiſe againſt it. But what glimpſe of hope
of any ſuch Divine help could ſuch a wretch have, who, with his eyes open
to the guilt and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, had brought himſelf into ſuch a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
ſtate? But God's mercy, which is over all his works, is not to be judged of
by us according to our narrow apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but according to the gracious
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation he has given us of it in his goſpel; and as that
aſſurance gave me good grounds to hope, ſo that hope inſpired me with a
deſign to uſe all proper means to obtain it, and leave the iſſue of it
to his Divine Providence. To him, therefore, I thankfully give all the praiſe
for his unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and ſingular bleſſing on thoſe means which
himſelf directed me to, and what the chiefeſt of them were I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
mentioned, and ſhall take notice of ſome others in the ſequel, in hopes
they <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0401000300:257"/> may prove of ſervice to ſuch as may ſtand in
the ſame need of them as I did then.</p>
            <p>However, I muſt own, that the reſolution had ſomething awful
and deterring, when I conſidered it in its full extent, to exchange the
delights of variety and multiplicity of company (which had been ſo delightful
and inſnaring to me till then, that no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or obſtacle could keep me
from it) for ſolitude and retirement; their bewitching flatteries and
commendations, whether for a falſe merit I had aſſumed, or for ſome
valuable things they fancied in me, for a cloſer recollection and abhorrence
of my own vileneſs; to ſpending of ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious time in the gaities
and guilty vanities of life, for a more cloſe application and ſearch after
the propereſt and moſt effectual means of redeeming that invaluable jewel,
and the parcelling and beſtowing it to the moſt beneficial purpoſes; to
retrench not only all unneceſſary and unlawful expences, but even ſome of
the common and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ones, in order to make ſome amends for paſt
extravagancies, by ſupplying the wants of thoſe many objects, that uſed
to paſs by unobſerved and unpitied by me. <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0401000300:258"/> Theſe,
and other ſuch like indiſpenſable preparatives, to the deſired thorough
change, ſeemed to carry ſuch unſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able difficulties with them, that
neither my ſmall ſhare of reaſon nor philoſophy could have ſupported
me to any tolerable degree in the reſolutions I was daily ſtriving to make
after it. And indeed, nothing ſo effectually did it, as the conſideration
that that Divine Providence, which had inſpired me with that deſire, would
not fail of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating it, if I was not wanting to myſelf; for that at once
ſet me upon trying ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one, ſometimes another, of thoſe duties,
with ſucceſs enough at leaſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me to proceed.</p>
            <p>And here I was again providentially helped by a worthy clergyman
at Braintree in Eſſex; who, good man, had a much better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of me than
I deſerved, and preſented me with that excellent book called Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
devotions, and recommended by the late reverend Dr. Hicks. This excellent book,
though then unknown to me, and diſreliſhed by ſome weak Chriſtians, is
ſo well known to all the true devout ones, that I need ſay no more in
commendation <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0401000300:259"/> of it, than that it proved of ſuch vaſt
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to me, that I can never ſufficiently admire it, or the piety of the
compiler and reformer; for the many opportunities and invitations it gives one
of frequent and cloſer intercourſe with God, and of meditating, in the
moſt exalted manner, on his various works, infinite mercies, and on all the
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime truths and duties of Chriſtianity, did ſo effectually reconcile
me to that ſolitude and retirement I had formerly been ſo averſe to, and
afforded me a moſt noble refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeveral times a day, from my
cloſe application to other ſtudies I was then pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, ſome of which
being of the dry, others of the complex kind, might have gone but
ſluggiſhly on without it. The late pious Mr. Nelſon's Method of Devotion
falling likewiſe, ſoon after, into my hands, in order to be conveyed, by my
means, to a young gentlewoman lately recovered from a ſtate of deſpondency,
I had the curioſity to run through it, and found in it ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, yet
eaſy rules for the conquering of our natural vices, and recovering the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary virtues to them, that I made it one <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0401000300:260"/> of my
daily monitors, and with no ſmall ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>But that which gave me the greateſt help, was the learned and
pious Mr. Law's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Call to Devotion. This truly valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able treatiſe I
accidentally found on a cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman's table, who, nevertheleſs, ſoon took it
out of my hand, and gave ſuch a character of it, as might have diſcouraged
me from looking farther into it, had not the place I had opened given me a
quite different notion of it. However, as I could not prevail upon him to lend
it me, I went and bought me one, and read it over and over, from beginning to
end, with greater eagerneſs and ſatisfaction than any I had ever met with
on that ſubject. I was particularly much taken with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's motives, as
well as his method for the right uſe of our time, money, talents, &amp;c. not
to mention that his variety of characters and reaſonings upon them, which are
a continued appeal to the moſt unbiaſſed and ſoundeſt judgement,
which admit of neither cavil or objection, ſoon opened to me a much better
way of applying them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, than any I had hitherto, or could 
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0401000300:261"/> indeed have fallen into, without ſuch an excellent
guide. The directions he gives for the obtaining of thoſe Chriſtian
virtues, which he there recommends as the proper ſubject for the ſeveral
hours of prayer in the day, may indeed appear to have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too
technical (ſince it is no other than a daily renewing of thoſe very
deſires, till themſelves become the virtues we want) from which too much of
the ſucceſs may, by the light and thoughtleſs, be aſcribed to the
method, and too little to the grace of God accompanying it. For may not, ſome
will be apt to ſay, an honeſt heathen or deiſt, by the ſame method,
raiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up into a habit of ſobriety, chaſtity, &amp;c. without
any ſuch application to, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular aſſiſtance from, the Supreme
Being? yet let any ſerious perſon try the efficacy of it againſt any of
his favourite, eſpecially his conſtitutional vices, and he will find, at
length, that he hath been only trying to waſh a Blackmoor white, and muſt
do ſo to the end of the chapter, without the intervention of Divine grace. As
for me I ſhall always, I hope, look upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire itſelf, as well as
the ſucceſs of the <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0401000300:262"/> means uſed for the obtaining
any virtue, to be alike the work of God in the ſoul, let theſe be ſuch as
Mr. Law directs, or any other, which Providence puts into our hands.</p>
            <p>I had long before this, however, began to conſecrate part of my
time to the ſtudy of the ſacred books, tho' not in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and
uniform manner as I happily fell into after reading the excellent directory
above mentioned, and had made a pretty collection of criticiſms, and other
obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon them, ſuch as occurred on my reading of the various
commentators on them; and now it was that I became ſenſible, indeed, of my
own want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the original Hebrew, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the loſs of
ſeveral opportunities I had miſſed of gaining a more perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in that ſacred and uſeful tongue. For I had been ſo diſcouraged from
the purſuit of it, by the difficulties I met with at the very threſhold,
that is, in the gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars, that I never had the patience to go thro' one of
them, but contented myſelf with the interliniary verſions of Pagninus,
Arias Montanus, and other Interpreters; <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0401000300:263"/> chuſing rather
to rely on their honeſty and ſkill, than to be at the trouble of becoming a
proper judge of either. It was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed poſſible for me to go on long in
this groping way, before their various inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the text,
(eſpecially thoſe of ſome bold critics, which ſeemed calculated to
unhinge, rather than confirm our belief, by exploding ſeveral, till then,
acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged facts and doctrines, or interpreting them in their own artful
way) ſet me again upon making ſome freſh efforts, for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a more
perfect knowledge of the original, which were however ſoon damped by every
freſh difficulty I met with in the common way of learning it, till I
providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially ſtumbled, as it were, on the following eaſy method.</p>
            <p>I was then hammering at an exercitation on the 34th Pſalm,
printed at the end of the grammar that goes under the name of Bellarmine; in
which I found at almoſt every word ſome exceptions to the gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar rules,
and ſuch reaſons aſſigned for them as ſtill carried one farther from
the point in view; when a poor man came and offered me a pocket Hebrew
pſalter, with <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0401000300:264"/> Leuſden's Latin verſion, over
againſt each page. I greedily bought it, and finding the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion much more
eaſy and natural than thoſe literal ones of Pagninus and Montanus, quickly
went through every verſe in the book, without troubling myſelf about
grammar, or any thing but the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every word as they occurred. So
that by the time I had given it a ſecond reading, my memory being the beſt
faculty I could boaſt of, I had by that very rote, as I may call it, not only
gained a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable copia verborum, but by obſervation on the flexion of
nouns, verbs, &amp;c. got a tolerable inſight into the declenſions,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugations, and other parts of the grammar and ſyntax; and, whenever any
difficulty or doubt occurred, could eaſily turn to my Bellarmine or even
Buxſtorf, the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of all; becauſe, having then but one
point in view, I could, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing my mind with any more than that,
either ſatisfy myſelf about it, or at the worſt poſtpone it, till a
further reading and obſervation brought me to it: I became ſo fond of this
method, that having gone through a third reading of it, with little or 
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0401000300:265"/> no obſtacle, and in a very little time, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
thenceforth to confine myſelf to the pſalms of each day, as they are read
at church, and to begin with the hiſtorical books.</p>
            <p>Here, inſtead of perplexing myſelf with ſuch Bibles as had
the ſervile letters printed in a different kind of character, to
diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from the radicals, I pitched upon the firſt edition of
that of Munſter, which is far inferior to the ſecond, and, by the help of
his verſion on the oppoſite column, though often at ſeveral lines
diſtance from the original, had hardly gone through ſix or eight chapters
of the firſt book of Samuel, before the eaſe I found in it invited me to go
back to Geneſis, and take every chapter in its courſe. I reſolved at
firſt to run them over once, without taking notice of his notes, becauſe
the greateſt part of them were either of the Maſſoretic or of the
Cabbaliſtical kind, and would rather clog than aſſiſt; and even in
theſe of the gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſort he lays all along ſo great a ſtreſs on
the punctuation for the true meaning and import of each word, as made his
ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the leſs to be depended upon. For <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0401000300:266"/> though I
always did and do ſtill look upon the points to be of ſingular help to
learners, and conſequently on the method propoſed by ſome moderns of
teaching the Hebrew without them, as wild, intricate, and in ſome caſes
dangerous, yet from all I had been able to gather from the learned au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors who
have wrote on the controverſy, I was ſo far from thinking them of the
ſame authority with the text, they plainly appeared of too modern a date to
be uſed in any other ſhape than as an expeditious help; and as ſuch I
ſtill made uſe of them, without confining myſelf to them any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than they were ſupported by the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, by the ancient paraphraſes and
ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and other ſuch critical helps, but made no ſcruple to depart
from them whenever a ſmall change of them could afford one a clearer or
better ſenſe. And for that I ſhall refer the reader to what I have
ſince wrote on that ſo much controverted ſubject in the Jewiſh
hiſtory, which makes the ſeventh chapter of the Univerſal Hiſtory, and
eſpecially in the folio edition, where I had more room to expatiate upon it
than in the octavo one, in which our being confined <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0401000300:267"/> to
reduce the whole within the compaſs of twenty volumes, obliged us to be a
little more conciſe. I muſt therefore here own with pleaſure, that all
that I there advanced hath been ſo well received, and looked upon as ſo
well grounded, that it hath not, that I know of, been ſince cenſured or
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted; and that though the controverſy in favour of the antiquity and
authority of the points hath been of late revived with no ſmall warmth, I
have met with nothing in it, nor heard from either thoſe I converſe or
correſpond with, any thing that could give me cauſe to alter my mind. I
ſhall only beg leave to add, that my looking on the Hebrew points, both vowel
and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical only in that view, enabled me to make many uſeful
diſcoveries in the ſacred books, which have been highly approved by thoſe
who have ſince read them in the hiſtory abovementioned.</p>
            <p>But to return to my firſt reading of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal books, I ran
with eaſe through the Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euch, Joſhua, Judges, &amp;c. except the few
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical parts which occur in it, ſuch as Exod. xv. paſſ. Deut. xxxii.
Judges v. .1 Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0401000300:268"/> ii. 1-10. where the ſtile
is not only ſwoln and figurative, but where the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is harſh,
irregular, and to appearance truncated, and ſeveral terms which occur no
where elſe; ſo that finding them too hard for me to ſurmount, with all
the application I had, I poſtponed them to a future read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I found
likewiſe pretty near the ſame difficulty in the Proverbs, Eccleſiaſtes,
and the Song of Solomon, and much more ſtill in Job; and therefore contented
myſelf with catching as much as I could at one curſory reading, and leaving
the reſt for hereafter; yet did not this diſcourage me from going through
all the Prophets in courſe, though it proved an arduous taſk, and I went
but ſlowly on, becauſe in theſe I endeavoured to make myſelf as much
maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their meaning and ſtile, as well as of the new words and
phraſes peculiar to them: and as I ſpent generally ſome hours a day on
that ſtudy, I had quickly gone through all the ſacred books of the Old
Teſtament, excepting thoſe chapters in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, Ezra, &amp;c. which are in
the Chaldee, and where I contented myſelf at this firſt reading, with
examining as well as I was <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0401000300:269"/> able, the difference between
that and the Hebrew. And here I own I found ſuch a diſparity between them,
ſuch a noble ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and yet maſculine energy in the latter, and
ſuch an apparent ſoftneſs and effeminacy in the former, not unlike what
is juſtly obſerved between Latin and Italian, that I believe nothing could
have tempted me to become more acquainted with it, had it not been for the
vaſt helps which the Chaldee paraphraſe affords us, not only in fixing the
meaning of many obſcure words and expreſſions, but, what is ſtill more
va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, in diſcovering the ſentiments of the ancient Jews concerning
many pregnant prophecies of the Meſſiah, from which the Talmudic writers
have ſince departed out of diſlike to him.</p>
            <p>When I came to the ſecond reading of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis, by which time I
had likewiſe ran through the Pſalms five or ſix times, and was got again
into the hiſtorical ſtile, I found myſelf ſo unclogged, ſo acquainted
with the grammar and ſyntax, and maſter of ſuch a vaſt number of words,
that I began to think I might begin to read the Latin into Hebrew; that is, by
hiding the Hebrew <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0401000300:270"/> column with my hand, try how I could
make my own agree to it. This I found however too hard and tedious, except in
ſome eaſy places or chapters, and I found myſelf not only at a loſs for
the words, but moſtly in the conjugating and ſyntax, and though it might in
all likelihood have quitted coſt, had I proceeded regularly in that method,
yet I found it too tedious, as it took me above twice the time, ſo that I
contented myſelf with only trying it now and then, when the humour took, or
the ſubject invited me to it. At other leiſure times, I uſed likewiſe
to exerciſe myſelf in conjugating of verbs by dint of memory and
obſervation, and then to compare it with thoſe in the grammar, by which I
ſoon found out wherein I was deficient, and this I thought more expeditious,
diverting, and effectual, than the dull method of begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who, by dint of
hammering, learn them by heart, ſcarcely knowing what they are about. One
thing however I found would be a great help, viz. in all dubious words, as the

               </gap> in the former in

nor a brooding like that of the hen over her eggs, as ſome other
tranſlations intimate, but a lively agitation, ſuch as much better explains
the action of the ſpirit of God upon the face of the waters. This method,
which I preferred to the conſulting that variety of verſions we have, which
rather confound than fix the ſenſe, inabled me in my very ſecond going
through the ſacred books, to make a pretty large collection of ſuch kind of
criticiſms and obſervations, as have been ſince of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar uſe to
me in the progreſs of my ſtudy, and in ſome of thoſe works in which I
have been ſince engaged, though I little thought then <pb n="270" facs="tcp:0401000300:272"/>
either they, or thoſe which I made out of other authors that came in my way,
would ever come into public view.</p>
            <p>I had by this time made ſo great a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in the Hebrew,
tongue that I could have talked it pretty fluently, had I been as well
acquainted with the pronunciation of it. But as that could not be attained from
grammars, which differed almoſt as much in the rules they gave for it, as the
native languages of their authors differed from each other, I thought it might
be more eaſily attained by converſing with the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, going to
their ſynagogues, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures read by their chazans or
miniſters, who, I ſuppoſed, were perfect maſters of it. But here, to my
great ſurpriſe, I found that they not only greatly differed among
themſelves, that is, the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern from the ſouthern, or German, Poliſh,
Hungarian, &amp;c. from the Spaniſh, Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe, Italian, &amp;c. but that
every one of them pronounced it after the ſame manner as they did the
languages of the countries where they had been brought up, and, as it plainly
appeared to me, none of them right. And this was farther confirmed to me by
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0401000300:273"/> with ſome Morocco Jews, whoſe native
language being the Arabic, made me think they bid faireſt for having retained
the antient pronunciation in a greater degree at leaſt of purity; for ſome
of them whom I met with by chance in the Portugueſe ſynagogue, made a mere
ridicule of their way of reading and pronouncing it. And it was by converſing
with ſome of theſe, who were beſides well acquainted with the Hebrew,
that I took my rules for a more genuine way of ſpeaking it: and it was no
ſmall pleaſure to me to find, that I could be very readily underſtood by
all the ſouthern Jews, though I could not ſo eaſily underſtand them, on
account of their not ſufficiently diſtinguiſhing between the ſounding
of ſundry conſonants, aſpirations, gutturals, &amp;c. which ſeemed to
me to have originally differed very greatly; ſuch as the

However, after I had once been fully appriſed of all the defects of their
reading, which ſeveral of them I have converſed with have had the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity to own as ſuch, I could eaſily enough underſtand both their
lectures of the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament and their prayers. But as to the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Jews, I own I never could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them in that tongue, without an
interpreter, or ſome go-between, who, by the help of travelling into other
parts, had learned the way to accomodate their ſpeech to both ways of
pronouncing, ſo much wider and uncooth is theirs to that of the ſouthern;
and this was no ſmall grief to me, becauſe I always found the northern more
learned and communicative, as well as more fluent and ready at ſpeaking that
ſacred tongue; though that conſideration was never ſufficient to induce
me to be at the pains to accuſtom myſelf to their way. Thus much I thought
might be neceſſary to ſay with reſpect to the pronunciation of the
Hebrew, to which I ſhall only add, that my method for learning and
preſerving it <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0401000300:275"/> was by reading it aloud to myſelf, and
with the ſame exactneſs, as if I had been reading it to an
aſſembly.</p>
            <p>But what contributed moſt to this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary readineſs of
ſpeaking it, was a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I fell into at proper times, when I found myſelf
inclined to cloſe thinking, to cloath my ideas in that, inſtead of any
other language, or, as one may more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly word it, to think in Hebrew
rather than in Engliſh, or any other language I was uſed to. The Pſalter,
which at my firſt ſetting up for this ſtudy, I had read over for ſome
time, at leaſt three or four times a month, and afterwards conſtantly went
through once a month ever ſince, was become ſo familiar to me, that I had
got it by heart; and as that contains moſt of the radical words, as well as
idioms, which are moſt in uſe, I ſeldom was at a loſs for either in
theſe my ſoliloquies, or, if I was, I immediately endeavoured to call to
mind where I had read any thing like it, either in that or any other of the
ſacred books, and by turning to it, if I could not readily recover it by dint
of memory, ſeldom failed of fixing it there <pb n="274" facs="tcp:0401000300:276"/> indelibly.
By this means I ſoon acquired not only a ſurpriſing fluency in it, but
could ſpeak it in the pure and elegant ſtile of the ſacred writers, and
now and then, upon occaſion, raiſe it to the lofty ſtrain of the poetical
books. This I was the more admired for, becauſe it was what few, if any, of
the learned among the Jews could do, who commonly marred their own by an
heterogeneous mixture of the corrupt Talmudic and Rabbinic words and idioms, to
which I was then in a great meaſure a ſtranger, nor could ever be
reconciled to after I became more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them. One may, indeed,
obſerve almoſt the ſame difference between the former and the latter,
ſome few of theſe excepted, as there is between the Latin of the Auguſtin
age, and that which was in vogue after the inundation of the northern
barbarians into the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as the reader may ſee by what I have
ſaid of it in my Hiſtory of the Jews from their Diſperſion after the
deſtruction of Jeruſalem to this time.</p>
            <p>By what I have ſaid hitherto of my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of learning Hebrew,
any one may <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0401000300:277"/> ſee how eaſily men at years of maturity
may come to as perfect knowledge of it, as the thing will admit of, and without
the diſcouraging ſlavery of beginning at the grammar, and may even make
that a pleaſing relaxation from other ſtudies; and it is with a view of
leſſening, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together removing thoſe fancied difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and
diſcouragements which have been the cauſe of that ſacred tongue being
ſo much, and, I may add, ſo ſhamefully neglected, by the clergy
eſpecially, that I have ventured to write ſo far on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from my
own experience; for, let them think of or palliate it as they will, ſuch a
neglect muſt of neceſſity be condemned, by all who ſeriouſly
conſider how impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it is to come at a true knowledge, not only of
the Old, but I will be bold to ſay of the New Teſtament, without a
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient knowledge of the Hebrew: the firſt ſeems to me
ſelf-evident, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſecond, or New Teſtament, I need
only obſerve, that the writers of it, though inſpired, and endowed with the
gift of tongues, did viſibly adhere ſtill to the Hebrew idiom in which they
had been <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0401000300:278"/> brought up, St. Paul himſelf not excepted.
Hence, the vaſt quantity of Hebraiſms that occur more or leſs in the
Goſpels, Acts, and in the Epiſtles, and which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can be rightly
underſtood or explained, but by having recourſe to the Hebrew idiom; but
this hath been ſo fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played by much better pens, that I ſhall
ſay no more on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>I have often wiſhed, indeed, that we had ſome more inviting
helps to that ſtudy than we have, and ſuch as might more effectually
contribute to overcome the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or indifference, which our young clergy
ſeem to have for it. And in order to contribute ſomething more than a bare
wiſh towards it, I had once gone a good way in compoſing a tragi-comic
piece, intituled, David and Michol, in Hebrew verſe, wherein I introduced
this young princeſs, acknowledging with a ſuitable reluctancy and ſhame
to her confident, her new born affection for the young ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, after ſhe
had ſeen him unperceived from behind a curtain in her father's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion, and
heard ſome of theſe inimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtrains with which he was wont to 
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0401000300:279"/> enliven that deſponding monarch in his moſt
melancholy hours. The diſtreſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the apprehended rivalſhip
of her eldeſt ſiſter, who was ſoon after promiſed as a reward to that
brave youth, for kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vapouring champion of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines and
Morabs, being repreſented here as having already ſettled her affections on
Adriel the Meholathite, to whom Saul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually gave her ſoon after, contrary
to his promiſe (1 Sam. xviii. 19.) the different fears and emotions of the
two ſiſters, the means by which they came to underſtand each other's
caſe and inclinations, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular affection of Jonathan towards David,
and the kind offices he did him with Saul, in order to procure him his beloved
Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol, inſtead of her ſiſter; all theſe, I ſay, are repreſented
in divers affecting ſcenes, to which the energy of the Hebrew gives no
ſmall beauty and pathos. The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodes, the moſt conſiderable of which
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of ſeveral interviews and conferences between the prophet Samuel
and young David, as when he acquainted him with Saul's utter rejection, and his
being choſen by God to ſucceed him in the Iſraelitiſh 
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0401000300:280"/> kingdom, David's ſurpriſe, ſcruples and fears, his
dread of entertaining even the moſt diſtant hope of a crown, which he could
not obtain but by the moſt unnatural and blackeſt treaſon againſt his
father-in-law, and his moſt generous friend Jonathan, and the arguments by
which the prophet endeavours to ſatisfy his ſcrupulous mind, that he
ſhall enjoy the promiſed crown, without the leaſt ſtain to his loyalty,
and at length prevails on him to ſuffer himſelf to be anointed king;
theſe, and ſome others of leſs importance, are not improper inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes
to bring the piece to its happy cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe, his marrying the kind and
beloved Michol, and being juſtly raiſed to the command of the
Iſraelitiſh army. To this I had added a literal verſion, which I
deſigned to have illuſtrated with critical notes; but ſome avocations
obliged me to ſet it aſide for a conſiderable number of years, and when I
came to give it a freſh reading, I found it to fall ſo ſhort of the
elegance and loftineſs of the ſacred poets, with whom I was become by that
time much better acquainted, and a much greater admirer of, that I was quite
diſcouraged from <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0401000300:281"/> improving or even finiſhing,
eſpecially when I conſidered the little likelihood there was of its meeting
with encouragement anſwerable to the pains and coſt, at a time when one
might obſerve the ſtudy of that tongue to dwindle more and more viſibly
into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, among thoſe whoſe duty and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ought to have
been to cultivate and promote it.</p>
            <p>The ſame mortifying conſideration made me likewiſe ſet
aſide a deſign I had formed, of compiling ſome ſcriptural Hebrew
Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, in imitation of the Latin ones of Caſtalio, and a ſet of others
on more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſubjects, like thoſe of Corderius, tho' not ſo puerile,
for the encouragement and diverſion of young beginners; and a third between a
Jew, and a Chriſtian, on the moſt material points of controverſy between
us, together with a collection and expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a great number of texts,
both in the Old, and New Teſtament, plainly foretelling the future
reſtoration of the twelve tribes of Iſrael, to their own Land, and their
embracing Chriſtian religion at the ſecond coming of Chriſt, towards 
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0401000300:282" rendition="simple:additions"/> the cloſe of the ſixth, or in the beginning
of the ſeventh millenary of the world; for though that doctrine is, as the
Jews at Rome ſaid of Chriſtianity, every where ſpoken againſt, (Acts,
cap. ult. v. 22.) I never found it to be ſo but by men who, like theſe Jews
had never rightly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it; whilſt thoſe who really have, (among
whom I have known ſeveral emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent divines of the church of England, and
ſome among the Diſſenters who were thoroughly ſatisfied with it)
contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with owning their belief of it to their intimate
friends, without daring to preach or promote it, for fear of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
or ridiculed for it. But I have had frequent occaſion to obſerve ſince
(vide Jual un Heſtor, fol. edit. vol. i. p. 613, &amp;c. 8vo. edit. vol. iii.
p. 39. and above all, ſee the concluſion of their hiſtory, from the
diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to this preſent time) that the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians denying that
doctrine, is one of the moſt effectual means not only of hardening the Jews
in their unbelief, but of unhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the greateſt evidences of the
Chriſtian faith, ſince it cannot be proved in any ſenſe, that any of
thoſe glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0401000300:283"/> concerning the happy
ſtate of the Jews under the Meſſiah, which are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered through the
Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have been fulfilled; but that, on the contrary, they
have for the moſt part been hated, perſecuted and miſerable, in moſt
countries in the world, ever ſince the death of Chriſt. However, as I had
little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to hope that ſuch a ſubject, written in Hebrew, how
beneficial ſoever it might have proved, at leaſt to young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners,
eſpecially by the help of the Latin verſion, would reliſh with the
preſent age, I likewiſe poſtponed it for ſome happier time, which is
not yet come, if ever I ſhould live to ſee it.</p>
            <p>I therefore contented myſelf with preparing for the preſs a
new edition of the Pſalms, with Leuſden's Latin verſion over againſt
it, and ſome critical and other notes for the uſe of the learners,
interſperſed here and there, with others of a more curious nature, on
ſeveral defficient places of that book, and moſt of them new. To this I
deſigned a preface, that ſhould give an account of the method by which I
had, chiefly by the means of the pſalms, attained to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge 
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0401000300:284"/> of the Hebrew tongue, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I have lately
related. I deſigned to add ſome further directions than thoſe I have
mentioned, with reſpect to the more eaſy attaining a readineſs of
underſtanding and ſpeaking it, one of which was, in the frequent reading to
change the third into the ſecond perſon at proper places, and ſo turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the pſalm into a kind of prayer, which, by raiſing the attention, imprints
the words more in the mind, as well as familiarizes the conjugating of the
verbs, &amp;c. and this I found a great help to my progreſs, and was approved
by ſome judges, upon which I acquainted Mr. Palmer, of Bartholomew's Cloſe,
one of the beſt printers then in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, with my deſign, and was
ſurpriſed one day on my coming to talk further about it, to hear that the
reverend Dr. W— had been there juſt before, to treat with him about
printing a new edition of it, ſaid to have been compiled by Dr. Hare, ſince
biſhop of Chicheſter, who pretended to have found out the true metre of the
Pſalms, and by means of that to have made a great number of conſiderable
diſcoveries and emendations in the original. I knew <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0401000300:285"/>
but too well how many excellent critics had already ſplit upon that fatal
rock, and who, inſtead of correcting, had quite marred the Hebrew, by
diſtorting, tranſpoſing and altering it at pleaſure, in order to bring
it to their model, to expect any thing ſolid or ſatisfactory from that
quarter, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſpecially the character of the author. Nor was I
miſtaken, though this performance did not appear in print till ſeven or
eight years after, and then to my great ſurpriſe. For Mr. Palmer had
amuſed me with the belief that the deſign was ſet aſide, either on
account of its being found impracticable, or at leaſt too difficult and
dangerous; for that, upon his applying to Dr. W— to enquire further about
it, he had received ſuch evaſive anſwers, as plainly convinced him, that
the author did not deſign to go on with it, which ſtill confirmed me more
in my old opinion, that all attempts to recover the antient metre of the
ſacred poetical books, were fruitleſs and loſt labour. It appeared
however, as I ſhall ſhow here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that Mr. Palmer impoſed upon me, and
that he knew that the deſign was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in another printing-houſe,
though <pb n="284" facs="tcp:0401000300:286"/> with ſuch privacy, that I never heard or
dreamed of it, though I had been long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Mr. Bowyer, who was
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the printing of it. So far from it was I, that I began to think
Mr. Palmer had only invented that ſtory to divert me from printing my
propoſed edition, in order to ſet me upon another work, in which he was
more immediately concerned, and expected greater credit, as well as preſent
profit from. This was his hiſtory of print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which he had long promiſed
to the world, but for which he was not at all qualified. However, he deſigned
to have added a ſecond part, relating to the practical art, which was more
ſuited to his genius, and in which he deſigned to have given a full account
of all that relates to that branch, from the letter-founding to the moſt
ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant way of printing, impoſing, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. in which he had made
conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable improvements of his own, beſides thoſe he had taken from
foreign authors; but this ſecond part, though but then as it were in embryo,
met with ſuch early and ſtrenuous oppoſition from the reſpective bodies
of letter founders, printers, and book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binders, <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0401000300:287"/> under an
ill-grounded apprehenſion, that the diſcovery of the myſtery of thoſe
arts, eſpecially the two firſt, would render them cheap and contemptible
(whereas the very reverſe would have been the caſe, they appearing indeed
the more curious and worthy our admiration, the better they are known) that he
was forced to ſet it aſide. But as to the firſt part, viz. the hiſtory
of printing, he met with the greateſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, not only from them, but
from a very great number of the learned, who all engaged to ſubſcribe
largely to it, particularly the late earls of Pembroke and Oxford, and the
famous doctor Mead, whoſe libraries were to furniſh him with the nobleſt
materials for the compiling of it, and did ſo accordingly.</p>
            <p>The misfortune was, that Mr. Palmer, knowing himſelf unequal to
the taſk, had turned it over to one Papiat, a broken Iriſh bookſeller
then in London, of whom he had a great opinion, though ſtill more
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified for it than he, and only aimed at getting money from him, without
ever doing any thing towards it, except amuſing him with fair promiſes for
near three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <pb n="286" facs="tcp:0401000300:288"/> of a year. He had ſo long dallied
with him that they were come within three months of the time in which Mr.
Palmer had engaged to produce a compleat plan, and a number or two of the
firſt part, by way of ſpecimen of the work, viz. the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and
improvement of it by John Fauſt at Mentz; and theſe were to be ſhewn at a
grand meeting of learned men, of which Dr. Mead was preſident that year, and
being his ſingular friend and patron, was to have promoted a large
ſubſcription and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which Mr. Palmer ſtood in great need of at
that time. Whereas Papiat had got nothing ready but a few looſe and imperfect
extracts out of Chevalier la Caille, and ſome other French authors on the
ſubject, but which could be of little or no uſe, becauſe he frequently
miſtook them, and left blanks for the words he did not underſtand.</p>
            <p>Theſe however, ſuch as they were, Mr. Palmer brought to me,
and earneſtly preſſed me that I would ſet aſide all other things I
might be then about, and try to produce the expected plan and ſpecimen by the
time promiſed, ſince he muſt be ruined both in credit and pocket, if he
diſappointed his <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0401000300:289"/> friends of it. It was well for him
and me, that the ſubject lay within ſo ſmall a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs as the
conſulting of about twelve or fourteen principal authors, and the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy between Mentz and Harlem univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally decided in favour of the
former, ſo that I eaſily fell upon a proper plan of the work, which I
divided into three parts, the firſt which was, to give an account of the
inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the art, and its firſt eſſays by Fauſt at Mentz, and of
its improvement by fuſile or metal types, varniſh, ink, &amp;c. by his
ſon-in-law Peter Schoeffer. The ſecond was to contain its propagation and
further improvement, through moſt part of Europe, under the moſt celebrated
printers; and the third an account of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction and progreſs into
England. This, together with above one half of the firſt part, were happily
finiſhed, and produced by the time appointed, and met with more approbation
and encouragement from his friends than I feared it would, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
how much better it might have turned out, would time have permitted it. And
this I chiefly mention, not ſo much to excuſe the defects of ſuch a
horrid perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0401000300:290" rendition="simple:additions"/> as becauſe it hath given
me ſince frequent occaſion to obſerve how many much more conſiderable
works have been ſpoiled, both at home and abroad, through the impatience of
the ſubſcribers; though this is far enough from being the only, or even the
greateſt inconvenience that attends moſt of thoſe kinds of
ſubſcriptions.</p>
            <p>As to Mr. Palmer, his circumſtances were by this time ſo
unaccountably low and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, conſidering the largeneſs and
ſucceſs of his buſineſs, and that he was himſelf a ſober
induſtrious man, and free from all extravagance, that he could not extricate
himſelf by any other way, but by a ſtatute of bankrupt, which cauſed his
hiſtory to go ſluggiſhly on; ſo that notwithſtanding all the care and
kind aſſiſtance of his good friend Dr. Mead, a ſtubborn diſtemper,
which his misfortunes brought upon him, carried him off before the third part
of it was finiſhed. This defect, however, was happily ſupplied by the late
noble earl of Pembroke, who being informed by Mr. Pain the engraver, Mr.
Palmer's brother-in-law, what condition the remainder was left in, and that I
was the perſon who had <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0401000300:291"/> wrote the former parts, ſent
for me, and, with his uſual generoſity, enjoined me to compleat the work,
according to the plan; and not only defrayed all the charges of it, even of the
paper and printing, but furniſhed me with all neceſſary materials out of
his own library; and, when the work was finiſhed, his lordſhip reſerved
only ſome few copies to himſelf, and gave the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the
impreſſion to Mr. Palmer's widow, not without ſome farther tokens of his
liberality.</p>
            <p>Before I leave this ſubject, I muſt, in juſtice to that
noble peer, give an inſtance or two of his generoſity and ſingular
integrity. At my firſt coming into England, I had had the honour to be
introduced to him, and to dine with him and other great perſons in his
company, and had received no ſmall tokens of his regard, till he conceived a
juſt diſguſt at one abſurd fact I had affirmed in my fabulous hiſtory
of Formoſa, viz. the Greek tongue being taught there as a learned language,
which monſtrous abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity ſufficiently ſhewed my ignorance and
indiſcretion at the time of my writing it, and from that time his lordſhip
gave me up <pb n="290" facs="tcp:0401000300:292"/> for what I was, an impoſtor, and I ſaw
him no more, till above twenty-eight years after, when Mr. Pine brought me to
him, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to finiſh the book abovementioned. At my firſt coming into
his preſence, his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip preſently knew me again, and reminded me of
my having been often with him, and of the reaſon of his taking a diſlike to
me; upon which I readily owned the juſtneſs of the charge, and of his
reſentment, which I begged his lordſhip to look upon as the effect of a
raſh inconſiderate piece of youthful vanity, which I had long ſince
diſclaimed, and condemned myſelf for, and aſſured him, that I had
ſince then, I thanked God, fallen into ſo laudable a way of living, as I
doubted not his lordſhip, if he knew of it, would not but approve of. Mr.
Pine confirmed what I had ſaid; and his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with his uſual
affability and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, highly congratulated and commended me for
it, and was pleaſed to expreſs a more than ordinary pleaſure at it,
exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to continue in the ſame good mind and way, and aſſuring me
of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and encouragement; and from that time I cannot
ſufficiently acknowledge his <pb n="291" facs="tcp:0401000300:293"/> extreme benevolence and
condeſcenſion, in not only furniſhing me with all the books and other
helps I wanted, but in his generouſly rewarding me for what I did; and when I
was forced afterwards to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him that I was a perſon concerned in the
writing of the Univerſal Hiſtory, became a ſubſcriber and encourager of
it, as I ſhall preſently have occaſion to ſhew. It was a little before
Mr. Palmer's death, that this work, the project of which had been formed by Mr.
Crockat, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent plan by the late famed Mr. Sale, met with an
unexpected ſtop, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy quarrel between the proprietors and the
authors, at the head of whom was Mr. Sale abovementioned, when I was
recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the former as a proper perſon to ſupply the place of ſome
of the latter, who had abſolutely declined being farther concerned in it.
This rupture happened ſoon after the publication of the third number, anno
1730, when Mr. Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer brought me the three printed num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from the
proprietors, and deſired, if after having read them and the plan, I had a
mind to engage myſelf in the work, <pb n="292" facs="tcp:0401000300:294"/> I ſhould give
them and the reſt of the authors a meeting at a place and day appointed,
which I accordingly did, and after having informed myſelf with their terms,
method, and other previous particulars, readily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to write the
Jewiſh hiſtory, in which I was the moſt verſed, and for which I knew
myſelf already provided with a conſiderable quantity and variety of
mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, which I had been collecting for my private uſe for ſeveral
years; and as I have been one of the chief perſons concerned as an author,
not only in the firſt, but alſo in the ſecond edition, and ſo was
perfectly acquainted with every ſtep taken in the progreſs of the work, the
encouragements and difficulties it hath met with, as well as with the merit and
demerit of every part of it, I ſhall make no difficulty to inſert here a
faithful and impartial account of the whole, at leaſt ſo far as it may be
of ſervice to the public, and prove a means of making any future editions
more compleat, by pointing out the many falſe ſteps which I found were
impoſſible for us to avoid in the two former.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0401000300:295"/>And here I muſt obſerve, in the firſt
place, that though the deſign was publicly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be carried on by a
ſociety of learned gentlemen, yet in fact Mr. Sale was to be the ſole
conductor of it, by the aſſiſtance of ſuch ammanuenſes as he ſhould
think fit to employ in the work. And though, in point of learning, no man might
be better qualified than he, for ſuch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous and extenſive
undertaking, yet his known ſtrait circumſtances obliged him to have ſo
many other irons in the fire (to ſay nothing of his natural indolence, the
ſad effects of which, not only the proprietors of this work, but many others
of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion have ſufficiently felt) that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for him to give it that attention which a work of that nature deſerved, much
leſs the diſpatch he had engaged with them for, viz. the publiſhing
twenty ſheets per month. Accordingly upon enquiry I could not find that he
ever wrote more than the firſt number; which, though puffed up with the
ſpecious pretence of a ſecond edition, every reader verſed on the
ſubjects treated in it, might eaſily know where he had got all his
materials ready <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0401000300:296"/> gathered to his hand; yet ſo long was
he in publiſhing it, that his delay occaſioned the firſt
miſunderſtanding between him and the proprietors, which was however
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a greater.</p>
            <p>The ſecond and third numbers, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared afterwards to have
been written by his two ammanuenſes, till then unknown to the partners, came
out indeed more regularly; but the proprietors, who had already paid Mr. Sale
for them, were not a little ſurpriſed when the two young authors (whom I
forbear naming, becauſe they are both alive and make a good figure, the one
in a high poſt, and the other in the commonwealth of learning) came and
demanded the money for their copy. The propietors did indeed produce his
receipts for much greater ſums than the three numbers could amount to, but
though they knew that he was not in a capacity to pay them, they refuſed to
make a ſecond diſburſement for what they had more than payed for,
whilſt the ſufferers, on the other hand, refuſed to go on further with
the work, till they were ſatisfied for what they had done. The partners
ſtiffly refuſing to comply, the reſult was, that one of them 
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0401000300:297"/> not only quite declined all further meddling in the
work, but vented his reſentment by crying it down, and all the perſons
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, authors as well as proprietors. Mr. Sale was ſtill more
outrageous againſt them, of whom the latter had taken a note of 72 pounds,
payable on demand, for money overpaid, and the embezzlement of a conſiderable
number of books, which they had furniſhed him to carry on the deſign. This
note was probably taken with a view of keeping him in awe, but neither that nor
their threats could contain him within bounds, ſo that he became a moſt
inveterate enemy to the deſign, and did all he could to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit and
obſtruct it.</p>
            <p>This was the hopeleſs ſituation of the work at my firſt
being invited to it, and againſt which I cannot forbear mentioning an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
diſcouragement, viz. the freedom which the authors of the foregoing part had
taken in reflecting, as often as they had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, againſt the Moſaic
account, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the hiſtory of the antient Canaan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, where God
is recorded to have treated them with ſuch ſeverity in favour of the
Iſraelites, and where they made no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty <pb n="296" facs="tcp:0401000300:298"/> to
reflect upon that partiality, as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the divine juſtice
and goodneſs towards a favourite nation, who are there repreſented as by
far the worſe of the two: for, as I took the liberty to obſerve to them,
beſides that all the objections againſt the divine conduct in this
particular have been ſo often and ſo effectually anſwered by learned
divines, that there can be no juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reaſon given for reviving them
here, this manner of treating Moſes's writings is far below the regard that
ſuch an antient and celebrated author may challenge, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly even
from his being acknowledged an inſpired penman, by Jews, Turks and
Chriſtians. And therefore added, I will never engage in the work, unleſs
you will allow me to follow the oppoſite tract, and, inſtead of reflecting,
to vindicate both his character and writings, as often as occaſion offers,
either from the works of our beſt divines, or from ſundry new
obſervations I have had opportunity to make on the books of that divine
lawgiver. I much queſtion, if they had not been at ſuch a nonplus for a
hand to go immediately upon the Jewiſh hiſtory, whether they would have
ever <pb n="297" facs="tcp:0401000300:299"/> yielded to theſe terms, ſuch was their opinion
of Mr. Sale, whom they knew had no great regard for the Old Teſtament, and
who had long ago inſpired one, if not both of his ammanuenſes with a moſt
outrageous zeal againſt it. However, I got them with ſome trouble to
acquieſce, and let me take my own way, only Mr. Provoſt, then one of the
partners, begged it as a favour of me, that I <hi>would not be righteous over
much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I gave them ſoon after good cauſe to be ſatisfied with my
advice and conduct, and the unexpected encouragement which the work met with,
after the regular publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two or three numbers of the Jewiſh
hiſtory (to ſay nothing of the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given to it in print, by two
ſuch learned perſons as Dr. Chapman, chaplain to his grace of Canterbury,
and Dr. Pearce, rector of St. Martin's in the fields) raiſed it into ſuch
reputation and vogue, that they no longer doubted of its ſucceſs;
inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they began now to enlarge the edition from 750 to 1000. And
this I mention with pleaſure, becauſe the great call there was for it from
that time, to what they had found before, when the numbers 
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0401000300:300"/> were returned to them by dozens from other
bookſellers, plainly ſhewed how few encouragers it would have met with
among the freethinkers and unbelievers, to what it did among thoſe of a
different, and I may add, of a better way of thinking. There was indeed one
main objection made, viz. my claſhing with thoſe who had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me;
and I remember more particularly, that the late earl of Pembroke (who, as I
lately hinted, was an encourager of the work, and to whom I was obliged to
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my not waiting ſo often on him as he deſired, in order to
finiſh the third part of Mr. Palmer's hiſtory above mentioned, by
acquainting his lordſhip that much of my time was taken up with the
Univerſal Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, in which I was engaged) expreſſed no ſmall
diſlike at this contraſt, or, as he was pleaſed to call it, chequer-work
between the Jewiſh hiſtory, and ſome of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that preceded it;
the one expreſſing all along an unaccountable diſregard for the Moſaic
writings, whilſt the other took all proper occaſion to vindicate them, in a
manner which he was pleaſed to call ſo very laudable and juſt; upon which
I was <pb n="299" facs="tcp:0401000300:301"/> forced to acquaint his lordſhip, that the former
part had been printed ſome time before I was concerned in the work, and
written by perſons in a very different way of thinking from me, and which I
had publicly diſallowed; but as they had ſince declined the work, the
proprietors had left me wholly at my liberty to take my own way, which I was
fully determined to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue to the end, ſo that there would be no more
ſuch contradictions to be found in the ſequel, becauſe all that related
to the Jewiſh nation down to their diſperſion at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of
Jeruſalem, or even from that to the preſent time, if we were encouraged to
continue it, would fall to my ſhare; and that thoſe who were to write the
hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Aſſyrians, Medes, Perſians, and other nations which
had any connection with the Jewiſh, ſhould be obliged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame
tract, and acknowledge the divine authority of the Old Teſtament. This his
lordſhip highly approved, and as to the remaining difficulty, viz. the
reconciling what was already printed, and he thought paſt remedying, I told
his lordſhip, that the greateſt part of theſe early numbers having 
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0401000300:302"/> been miſlaid, and ſo bandied about and waſted that
there would be ſpeedily a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of reprinting them, I would engage
to reviſe and correct them, ſo as to make the whole uniform, which was
ſoon after done accordingly. But when, for the credit of the work, I
propoſed to the proprietors the calling in of the old numbers, and giving the
purchaſers the new ones in lieu of them, the greater part of them lent a deaf
ear to it, alledging, that they were ſo much out of pocket already, that they
could not afford to deſtroy ſo great a number of copies for the ſake of
uniformity, and that the work muſt take its chance without it.</p>
            <p>This was not the only inſtance in which they ſtood in their
own light; I ſhall beg leave to add one or two more. Before the ninth number
of the firſt volume had been publiſhed, they had received ſeveral letters
from the learned both at home and abroad, directed to the authors,
particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly two from Holland, the one from a perſon who tranſlated our
hiſtory into French, and the other into Dutch, and publiſhed them there
regularly every month, as we did here. Theſe, among other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations 
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0401000300:303"/> and encouragements, deſired us to ſend them the
ſheets as faſt as printed here, for the better diſpatch of their
ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and keeping time with us; offering to make any reaſonable
ſatisfaction for it, and to promote the credit and ſale of the Engliſh
original on the other ſide the water. The Dutch tranſlator in particular,
who was a man of learning and character, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted us, not without a
handſome and modeſt apology, with ſome alterations and deviations he had
taken the liberty to make from our printed copy, in the three or four firſt
numbers, and deſired us above all things to ſettle a correſpondence with
him, that we might freely communicate our thoughts to one another, promiſing
to ſend us, at the concluſion of each volume a copy, of his verſion, with
the alterations marked in the margin, and the ſentiments of the learned
beyond ſea; about the work which he accordingly did at the cloſe of his
firſt volume, though we had not been able to prevail upon the proprietors to
ſend them the ſheets in the manner above deſired, and were not willing to
do it without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they being all apprehenſive that theſe 
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0401000300:304"/> would hinder the ſale of the Engliſh original there.
We tried in vain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the contrary, by ſhewing them that it
would rather forward it, by making it more known and famed abroad; for that not
only the Engliſh there, but likewiſe thoſe who underſtood that
lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, would ſtill chuſe to read it in the original rather than in a
verſion. I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe tried to make them ſenſible how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and
uſeful ſuch a correſpondence would be to us, and how much it would in all
likelihood contribute to the credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the work, and what need
we ſtood in to uſe all proper helps, in a work of ſo arduous and
extenſive a nature. The only thing they would agree to, was that we might, if
we thought fit, ſtill correſpond with them, (and that they knew we could do
without their leave) but as to the ſending the ſheets as ſoon as printed,
they abſolutely refuſed; ſo that we were forced to put an end to the one
for want of being able to comply with the other.</p>
            <p>The next inſtance I ſhall give is ſtill of a more ſordid
nature. They were obliged to furniſh us with all neceſſary books 
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0401000300:305"/> for the work, and on my firſt going upon the Jewiſh
hiſtory, I ſent them a liſt of ſuch as were really wanted, though
ſome of them very conſiderable both in bulk and value, ſuch as the
Thalmuds, Polyglott, Opera Criticorum, &amp;c. and was ſurpriſed at the
difficulties they made, and objections they raiſed againſt both the number
and charge of them, alledging on the one hand the vaſt number of them that
had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly embezzled and loſt, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to amount to
near 200<hi>l.</hi> and on the other, the vaſt expence they had already been
at, and the little returns made for it in the four firſt numbers; ſo that
if I would not diſpenſe with a good number of the deareſt ſort, they
were afraid they muſt deſiſt from proceeding farther. It was well for
them, as well as me, that I had then a free acceſs to Sion College library,
by an order from the preſident and ſome of the heads of that ſociety, and
which I had made uſe of for ſome years, whenever I ſtood in need of it;
ſo that I readily engaged to ſtrike out all thoſe that I ſhould find
there, provided they would promiſe to find me all the reſt. By which means,
as well as by the <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0401000300:306"/> kind aſſiſtance of my good
friend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Mr. Reading, the late worthy library-keeper, who having
the goodneſs to bring me all the books I called for, without the trouble of
my looking out for them in their reſpective ſhelves, to my writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſk
at the farther end of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, I could with eaſe conſult all my
au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, make what extracts I wanted out of them, after which he took the
pains of returning them to their proper places.</p>
            <p>Now as this ſaved the bookſellers the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of near, if not
more than 100<hi>l.</hi> worth of books, and me a great deal of trouble, (for
Mr. Reading did moſt frequently enquire of me what part of a book I
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to conſult, and being well acquainted with moſt of them,
brought them to me opened at the very place I wanted, which enabled me to make
more diſpatch, and to keep up to the time of publication) I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted at
one of our meetings, and I thought juſtly too, that they ſhould, by way of
acknowledgement, preſent either the library, or the worthy keeper of it, with
a ſet of volumes, as ſoon as they come out, which, I told them, might
likewiſe be a means of <pb n="305" facs="tcp:0401000300:307"/> recommending the work to
thoſe divines and others that frequented that place. They all ſeemed
readily to agree to the propoſal, and I acquainted Mr. Reading, who was not a
little pleaſed with it, and told me, that, for his part, he was very ready to
do all he could to promote our deſign, without any ſuch view, though he
ſaid that he ſhould be glad to ſee it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the library, as it
was a work which he much approved as far as we had gone, the chronology
excepted, to which he thought that of the learned Uſher vaſtly preferable.
I told him I was wholly of his opinion, and was ſorry Mr. Sale had ever fixed
upon this, but that it was done before I was concerned in the work, and could
not now be retrieved, at leaſt in this firſt edition, but by the readers
making up the difference either in their mind or with the pen. I added, that I
had reaſon to believe, that if the work came ever to be reprinted, we
ſhould exchange it for that of Archbiſhop Uſher, as we have actually
done. However, as ſoon as the firſt part of the Jewiſh hiſtory was
printed off, I took a little receſs among ſome of my <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0401000300:308"/>
friends in Hampſhire, where I compleated my next taſk, viz. the hiſtory
of the Celtes and the Scythians, and as I had the free uſe of ſeveral
libraries there, I ſaved the proprietors the charge of buying thoſe books I
was ſure to find in any of them, and as ſoon as I found by the public
papers, that the firſt volume was publiſhed, wrote a letter to put them in
mind of their promiſe of preſenting one of them to Sion College library;
but I was much ſurpriſed at my coming to town, to find that they had
abſolutely reſolved againſt it, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that it might hinder many
clergymen from buying it, if they could have the reading of it there. I tried
in vain to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn them that I ſhould want moſt of the ſame ſcarce
and chargeable books, beſides a number of others, for the writing the
ſecond part of the Jewiſh hiſtory, in a ſubſequent volume, in which
caſe they could not expect that I ſhould again have recourſe to my good
friend Mr. Reading, but muſt of neceſſity be at the expence of buying
them; they choſe to run the hazard of it, and I took care not to ſpare them
in one of them, when it came to the point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0401000300:309"/>From theſe few inſtances, the reader may
eaſily gueſs that the then partners were not quite ſo ſolicitous for
the credit of the work, as might have been wiſhed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how well it
took by this time. But I muſt in juſtice to them acquaint him, that
(beſides the great difficulties they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured under to procure proper hands
to go on with it, and for which I refer him to what I have ſaid in the
dedication and preface to the laſt volume of the folio edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) they had met
with many unexpected and conſiderable loſſes; ſome of the newly engaged
authors, for inſtance took up pretty round ſums before-hand, and never
wrote a line of the part they had undertaken; others, even among the old ones,
wrote theirs in ſuch a careleſs manner as not to be fit to appear in print,
when they came to be examined by the reſt, and yet were paid the ſame to
the full as if their copy had paſſed muſter, though the whole was to be
done again <hi>de novo,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarding of the work was an additional
loſs to the proprietors. I will add, that I have ſince known near twenty
ſheets of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Byzantine hiſtory, done by 
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0401000300:310" rendition="simple:additions"/> a judicious hand, and printed off, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to waſte paper chiefly becauſe it was ſpun to too great a length, which
was ſtill a much greater loſs. The truth is, that the author of the Roman
hiſtory, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wire-drawn it to above three times the length it was to have
been, there was an abſolute neceſſity of curtailing that of the
Conſtantinopolitan emperors, to prevent the work ſwelling into an enormous
bulk; and he himſelf hath abridged it in ſuch a manner as hath quite marred
it, ſince the reader will find moſt reigns contained in as many ſhort
paragraphs as they would have required ſheets, which is ſo much the greater
loſs to the public, inaſmuch as the Roman hiſtory being ſo well known,
and written by ſo many hands, was the fitteſt to have been thus
epitomiſed; whereas the Byzantine, though equally curious and inſtructive,
is ſo little known, that it ought to have been written in a more copious
manner, eſpecially as it abounds with the moſt intereſting incidents to
the church as well as the ſtate. So that the author hath done in both
reſpects <pb n="309" facs="tcp:0401000300:311"/> the very reverſe of what he ought to have
done.</p>
            <p>The reader may, from the inſtances above mentioned, ſuppoſe
perhaps, that we the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors kept conſtantly to our meetings and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
each part in a body, as we uſed to do at firſt ſetting out, a method of
the greateſt conſequence towards the carrying on ſuch a work, and which
the proprietors were not wanting in generoſity to promote; but we ſoon
found the new comers ſo averſe to continue it, or ſubmit the review of
their copy to the old ones, that they either abſented themſelves from our
meetings, or elſe condeſcended only to anſwer ſuch queſtions as were
aſked them by the old ones concerning their fixing any point of hiſtory,
which had a connection with that of another nation; as the Macedonians and
Greeks, for inſtance, done by two or three hands, to prevent our claſhing
with each other about uncertain or controverted facts; in every reſpect, they
inſiſted on going on each in his own way, as they were, they told us,
ſufficiently acquainted with the ſubject they had in hand. By this means it
was that they indulged themſelves in the <pb n="310" facs="tcp:0401000300:312"/> liberty of
going beyond their bounds, and ſwelling each part to double the bulk agreed
on, by often repeating the ſame common facts in each ſeparate hiſtory,
which we had agreed ſhould be related at length but in its proper place,
whilſt every other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that offered for freſh mention of them, was
to be only referred to that, either as promiſcua to follow in the ſequel,
or as a reference to what hath already been ſaid.</p>
            <p>For we had from the beginning agreed upon this method, that
nothing ſhould be related at length concerning the hiſtory of any nation or
country, but what was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted within the boundaries of it; and that the
wars, conqueſts, &amp;c. which were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on abroad, ſhould be mentioned
chiefly in the hiſtory of thoſe countries where they were made; to do
otherwiſe, would be, as was hinted at the beginning of the firſt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
treating thoſe conquered nations with the ſame arbitrary contempt and
neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect as their conquerors had formerly done. Thus, for inſtance, it was
reſolved that Alexander's hiſtory ſhould be confined to Macedonia, and
his other conqueſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <pb n="311" facs="tcp:0401000300:313"/> to that of thoſe
nations he ſubdued; that that of the Romans, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within the
limits of Italy, and their new lawleſs acquiſitions referred to the
hiſtory of the Gauls, Germans, Spaniards, Carthaginians, &amp;c. that were to
follow. This would at once have effectually cut off all needleſs repetitions,
with which the work hath been ſwelled beyond its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned length, without
docking the hiſtory of any nation, as we have been ſince forced to do, to
avoid falling into the ſame fault in which the writers of the ſeveral Greek
hiſtories have fallen, where the reader may ſee the ſame facts related
over and over in the hiſtories of the Macedonians, Athenians, Spartans,
&amp;c. not without ſome viſible and unjuſtifiable variations, all which
might eaſily have been avoided, had the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors kept within the rules
abovementioned. But no one hath ſhewn a greater diſregard to them, than the
author of the Roman hiſtory, who hath ſwallowed up all the unhappy nations
that fell into thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors clutches without diſtinction, and
expatiated with the ſame diffuſeneſs on their hiſtory without, as he
hath in that within <pb n="312" facs="tcp:0401000300:314"/> their territories, which though
ſome of our readers have approved of, as it gives a more connected hiſtory
of that nation, a thing ſo much the leſs needful in a work of this
extenſive nature, as we have it written in a body by ſo many different
hands, yet hath been highly diſliked by the far greater, and I may add the
more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious part of them, as contrary to our plan and engagements to the
public, and to the nature of an Univerſal Hiſtory, wherein that of every
nation, ſhould be found fully diſplayed, and every fact confined to its
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſcene of action. It was to the neglect of attending to, or rather
keeping up to this original deſign, that we muſt aſcribe two
conſiderable defects in the work, againſt which our readers have juſtly
complained. The one, that ſome hiſtories, as for inſtance, that of the
Carthaginians, had been fraught with an unneceſſary repetition of all their
wars with the Romans, or which had been already fully related in the Roman
hiſtory, to the ſwelling of the work beyond its due limits; the other, that
to avoid that inconveniency and charge to the purchaſers, thoſe of the
Gauls, Germans and Spaniards <pb n="313" facs="tcp:0401000300:315"/> are truncated, and their
wars with, and reduction by the Romans are barely referred to what hath been
ſaid in the Roman hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, where they are ſcattered and ſo
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed with that of other nations, that it cannot be called a
regular and compleat hiſtory of them. And what is this but abſorbing all
theſe brave nations by the lump, into that of their tyrannic conquerors; and
how could I, to whoſe lot the hiſtory of thoſe three ancient nations
fell, avoid it by any other way, but that of recapitulating all afreſh, in
the moſt compendious manner I could, to avoid ſwelling the work and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the reader to the volume and page of the Roman hiſtory, where the
facts are mentioned at length. And there was by that time the more cauſe to
abridge all theſe needleſs repetitions, becauſe the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers, and
after them the bookſellers, had juſtly complained, how vaſtly the work
was already ſwelled beyond the bounds to which we had promiſed to confine
it. But this was not ſo readily complied with by the reſt, who having
finiſhed each their reſpective hiſtories, according to the plan and
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod agreed upon, and mentioned above, <pb n="314" facs="tcp:0401000300:316"/> and either did
not dream that the writer of the Roman hiſtory would go contrary, or when
they found he had, did reſent it too much to ſuffer their own to be
truncated on his account, inſiſted upon their being printed at full length,
and with all their repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. And this the bookſellers were forced to
ſubmit to, for fear not only of diſoblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authors, but likewiſe of
retarding the regular publication of the volumes.</p>
            <p>But what will eaſily convince the reader, as it hath me long
ſince, how much more earneſt the writer of the Roman hiſtory was to
promote his own ignoble intereſt, at the expence of the proprietors as well
as the credit of the work, is, that when he came afterwards to write the
ſecond part of the hiſtory of the Perſians, he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated at length
all their wars with the eaſtern emperors, together with all the other facts
and incidents that paſſed between them, at full length, inſtead of
referring to what he had formerly ſaid in the Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine hiſtory; for this
plainly ſhews that the <hi>dulcis odor lucri,</hi> more effectually
influenced him than all the complaints of the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors and purchaſers,
which laſt were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0401000300:317"/> ſo rife that we thought it
neceſſary to publiſh ſomething by way of excuſe for this exceſs of
bulk, and at the ſame time to make the beſt appology we could for that and
other deviations from our original plan, without diſcovering the cauſes
they were owing to, which would have rather helped to diſcredit the work in
the eye of the world, which did not dream how little unanimity there was in our
proceedings, and how impoſſible it was for the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined of us to
keep ſuch ſelfiſh ſpirits as were then employed, within the bounds
preſcribed. I ſhall now give a farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, and ſuch a
pregnant one, as will convince the reader that ſuch a work as this could
never be carried on fairly, and according to our promiſe, notwithſtanding
all our care and precaution, even in the ſecond impreſſion of the work;
how much leſs poſſible muſt it have been, to have done ſo in the
firſt.</p>
            <p>But there was ſtill a greater inconvenience reſulting from
theſe repetitions, and the monſtrous bulk of the Roman hiſtory, and by
that time the ſeventh volume was <pb n="316" facs="tcp:0401000300:318"/> finiſhed, the
public began to think we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſpin the work to nine or ten, for
there were ſtill a great number of ancient kingdoms and countries to be
deſcribed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our original deſign, ſuch as the Mohammedan
hiſtory, and other nations interwoven with it, conſiſting of above twenty
articles in Mr. Sale's plan, moſt of them of ſuch hard names as few readers
were acquainted with, beſides the kingdoms of the great Mogul and other parts
of India, thoſe of Siam, China, Japan, Tartary, Ruſſia both in Europe and
Aſia, the Turkiſh empire in both, and the whole country of America; all
which could hardly be contained in leſs than two volumes at the leaſt.
However, by that time the ſeventh volume was publiſhed, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors
met with ſo little encouragement to go on from the purchaſers, and were
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuch conſiderable loſers, that they thought fit to ſtop there,
and leave the work thus maimed and imperfect; but what not only determined, but
in ſome meaſure forced them to it, was their having the mortification
ſoon after, to ſee their property invaded by three different pyratical 
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0401000300:319"/> bookſellers of Dublin, who, as they were not at any
other charge than printing and paper, both which are much cheaper in Ireland
than here, could well enough afford it to the public for half the price that
ours ſold for at London, and unknown to each other reprinted the work there
word for word, two of them in folio and the third in oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavo, and when each of
them came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the like pyracy had been committed by the other
two, fell foul againſt each other in their advertiſements, in ſuch
language and opprobrious names as all three juſtly deſerved. As therefore
ſuch a piece of flagrant injuſtice could not but greatly affect the
original proprietors, who were already ſo conſiderably loſers, it could
not be expected that they ſhould run the manifeſt hazard of throwing away
more money in purſuit of their plan. We were therefore obliged to frame
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind of excuſe for their dropping it, viz. that thoſe countries
and kingdoms not ſpoken of in the foregoing volumes, being of later
diſcovery, ſuch as India, China, &amp;c. in Aſia, a great part of Africa,
and the new American world, they would <pb n="318" facs="tcp:0401000300:320"/> be more properly
deſcribed, and their hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries begun and continued in the modern part,
which they were however no farther reſolved to go on with, than as they found
a probability of its meeting more encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement than the old had hitherto
done. So that they had now time to think on ſome proper means of
ſuppreſſing the three pyrated impreſſions as far as poſſible, by
expoſing them to the public as they juſtly deſerved, and propoſing to
give the world a new and more correct edition of the whole in octavo, together
with additions of ſuch material points as had been omitted in the former.</p>
            <p>When this ſecond impreſſion came to be reſolved on, both
the authors and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, ſenſible of the many miſcarriages of the
former, for want of our following our firſt plan, did unanimouſly agree
among other things, that every one of us in the reviſing, correcting, and
improving each our reſpective parts, ſhould oblige ourſelves, ſo far to
ſtick cloſe to it for the future, that all the unneceſſary repetitions
ſhould be reſcinded, and every historical fact be confined to the hiſtory
of that country in <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0401000300:321"/> which it was tranſacted, and no
where mentioned at length but there; as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Sicily in the
hiſtory of that Iſland, of Carthage in that of the Republic, of the
Spaniards, Gauls, &amp;c. in that of thoſe nations, which was the only way of
mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one of them compleat, and at the ſame time ſhorten the work,
by the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all needleſs repetitions. And this we not only promiſed,
but bound ourſelves in writing to perform; however to make the point ſtill
more ſure, as I had reaſon to doubt an unanimous compliance to the
agreement from one quarter, I further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that no part ſhould go to
the preſs, till it had been examined and approved by the reſt. This was
accordingly oppoſed by the party I ſuſpected under ſeveral ſpecious
pretences, ſuch as taking up too much time, as we lived at ſome diſtance
from each other, the danger of miſlaying or loſing ſome of the copy, and
having now and then ſome alteration in controverted points, all which might
retard if not hinder the work; upon which the proprietors thought fit to give
it up, and to depend upon our honour for the exact performance of our 
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0401000300:322"/> agreement. However, as he hath hardly in one ſingle
inſtance kept up to it, but hath reprinted, not only his own Roman hiſtory,
but ſeveral other parts done for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by other hands, and now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to
his care by the bookſellers, almoſt verbatim from the firſt edition, to
the no ſmall trouble of, and damage to the other authors who had filled up
theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary chaſms in their reſpective parts, which he
ſhould have ſtruck out of his own, and have been ſince obliged to eraſe
all thoſe additions; he hath ſufficiently convinced every one of us what
his views were in ſo ſtrenuouſly oppoſing my propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and
conſequently how impoſſible it is for ſuch a deſign as this to be
rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, unleſs the whole care and reviſal be left to one
ſingle perſon of ability equal to it. The thing is now paſt all remedy
with reſpect to this ſecond edition, though it may be eaſily rectified in
every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in a future one, if any ſuch may ever find encouragement.
But the wrong done to the public in this ſecond, is the more conſiderable,
through the unfairneſs of the author above mentioned, in as much as, 
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0401000300:323"/> though he is the only one concerned, that hath not
complied with our articles, he has by his ſubdulous artifice had the far
greater ſhare in the work committed to him. And I think I have the greater
right to complain of his breach of promiſe, and the diſcredit he hath
brought on us and the work, as I can make it appear that neither in the firſt
nor ſecond edition, I have ever departed from our original plan, in any of
thoſe parts I have been engaged in, nor inſerted any thing in them except
by way of promiſſum or reference, that properly belonged to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And
for the truth of this I ſhall only appeal to theſe parts, a liſt of which
I ſhall, in juſtice to my own character, now give to the reader.

            <p>In the ſecond edition, wherein we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſupply all
the material omiſſions in the firſt, the following parts came to my
ſhare, viz. 
<list>
                  <item>1. The ſequel of the Theban, and Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt here obſerve with reſpect to the laſt of theſe,
that it had been promiſed in our plan from the very beginning, but had been
deferred, as more properly belonging to the modern hiſtory; upon which
ſeveral of our ſubſcribers and correſpondents complained of the
omiſſion, as it is a ſubject not only curious and inſtructive, but
likewiſe little known, and therefore much wanted; upon which we had agreed to
ſatisfy their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and to have inſerted it at the end of the ſecond
part of the Jewiſh or the Roman hiſtory, and I had accordingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it
for the preſs againſt that time, and <pb n="323" facs="tcp:0401000300:325"/> beſtowed full
ſix months in the writing of it, beſides what I had ſpent before in
col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting ſuch curious materials as fell in my way; ſo that the copy,
which will make about fifteen or ſixteen ſheets of the octavo edition, hath
been a good while in the hands of the proprietors, and as I had reaſon to
expect, would have been printed before now in the fifteenth or ſixteenth
volume, of which I had appriſed ſeveral of my correſpondents, as well as
thoſe of my acquaintance who enquired after it. But to my ſurpriſe, the
proprietors have ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to poſtpone it till the Modern Hiſtory
comes out, as it brings the hiſtory of the Jewiſh nation down to the
preſent time, which no other in the work doth, and can have no place in the
Antient. But the real cauſe was the want of room, the work being like to
ſwell beyond the number of volumes promiſed in their propoſals.</p>
            <p>The truth is they being in ſome meaſure obliged to include it
within the compaſs of twenty, or at moſt twenty-one volumes, in order to
ſuppreſs the pyratical Iriſh edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which was promiſed to be
contained <pb n="324" facs="tcp:0401000300:326"/> within that number, though without any
probability (or perhaps deſign) of their ſo doing, if one may gueſs by
the bulk of each of thoſe volumes that have been publiſhed) there was a
neceſſity of reducing matters within a narrower com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. And this upon a
ſtrict computation might have been eaſily done, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
ſeveral additions that were to be made to the work, had all the needleſs
repetitions been reſcinded, the ſtyle made more conciſe, and a great
number of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous facts, circumſtances, diſquiſitions, and
controverſies, moſt of them uſeleſs and incompatible with the nature of
ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive a work, been ſtruck out of both the text and notes, as we
had agreed ſhould be done by every one in his reſpective parts, and hath
been actually done by all but one, and him the perſon who had the largeſt
ſhare in the reviſing and contracting of the work; ſo that through his
neglect and noncompliance, the work hath ſwelled not only much beyond our
computation, but would have done much more ſo, had not the proprietors from a
laudable deſire of keeping up as much as could poſſibly 
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0401000300:327"/> be done to the firſt propoſals, not only
generouſly thrown in five or ſix ſheets ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary into every volume,
but likewiſe enlarged every page both in the length and number of the lines,
by which each volume from the fourth downwards, may be juſtly ſaid to
contain between ſix or ſeven ſheets more of matter than was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
propoſed, or than the third or fourth contained. And this I am bound to
men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in juſtice to them, becauſe though they were conſiderable
loſers by the firſt edition, they yet choſe to put themſelves to this
extraordinary expence, rather than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the charge of impoſing upon the
public, by the unexpected addition of three or four volumes more than they had
engaged to compriſe the whole work in. However, I cannot but be ſorry that
theſe conſiderations ſhould be looked upon as a ſufficinet pretext for
their ſuppreſſing that ſequel of the Jewiſh hiſtory I have been
ſpeaking of, contrary to the original plan of the work, and the expectation
of ſo many of its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragers. And I do purpoſely take notice of it, that
in caſe I can not prevail upon them to print it at the end of the work, 
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0401000300:328"/> and leave it at the option of ſubſcribers, either to
buy or leave it, the public may know where the fault lies, and that my friends
may not lay it at my door.</p>
            <p>Thus much may ſuffice for the hiſtory of this work, and to
account for the great imperfections of the firſt edition, and for the
ſecond not turning out better than it hath; and I doubt not, when the reader
conſiders all theſe things he will be apt rather to wonder, as I have often
done, that it is come out ſo well as it is. I have no intention, much leſs
any cauſe to reflect on the proprietors of the work, eſpecially thoſe who
are become ſo ſince the deaths or failure of moſt of the old ones. They
have ſpared neither pains nor coſt towards its improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor been
wanting in generoſity to the authors. They never once diſputed with me
about the price I ſet upon my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, nor refuſed to ſupply me with
ſuch ſums as I drew upon them for. This is indeed more than I can or ought
to ſay of the old ſet of them, ſome of whom often put us to great
difficulties by their ſordidneſs and mutual jealouſies and
miſunderſtandings, all which I with pleaſure obſerved to vaniſh 
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0401000300:329"/> upon the coming in of this new ſet. It is true that as
far as related to me, they always found me diligent and punctual; I performed
the parts I undertook to the beſt of my abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and being content with a
moderate gain, could beſtow the more time and labour upon them, and always
took care to have them finiſhed at the time required; and ſo wholly, and I
may add cordially, was I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon the work in general, that I would never
engage in any other whilſt that laſted. And this they were ſo far
ſatisfied of, and ſo entirely relied on me, that whether in town or
country, I have been allowed to drawn upon Mr. Millar, for ſome ſcores of
pounds before hand, which were punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally anſwered by him, though neither he
nor any of the partners, ever ſaw any of my copy till it went to the preſs;
and when printed off paid the ſurplus with uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon generoſity, for I
always took care to keep within compaſs. This may look like vanity for me to
ſay of myſelf, but as it will not be made public till after my death, when
I ſhall be out of the way of reaping any ſatifaction from it, but the
conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of having acted an honeſt part; and 
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0401000300:330"/> as this hath been my conſtant method with all the
bookſellers with whom I have been concerned, and for this I dare appeal to
all who have employed me, I am the leſs ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous about any ſiniſter
conſtruction a cenſorious reader may put upon it; thoſe who have known me
and my converſation for much above theſe twenty years, will I hope paſs a
more candid judgment upon it.</p>
            <p>However, with reſpect to the management of the partners about
this ſecond edition, I cannot but obſerve that they were guilty of two
fatal errors. The firſt in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſo great a ſhare of the work, as
well as the reviſal of the whole to a man, who they had all reaſon to
believe aimed chiefly at gain and diſpatch, and to agree with him by the lump
as they did, which would only prove a temptation to him to hurry it off as
faſt as he could, and as he accordingly did, to their no ſmall
mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as hurt to themſelves and the work. I might add, that
as he was and owned himſelf quite unacquainted with the eaſtern languages,
he was the moſt unqualified for ſeveral parts that fell to 
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0401000300:331"/> his lot of any and if care had not been taken would have
committed ſuch miſtakes in the very ſpelling of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per names, as would
quite have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited it.</p>
            <p>The other was their engaging to publiſh a volume monthly, and
beginning to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh before they had a ſufficient number ready printed
before hand, to have enabled them to keep up to their time; the want of which
precaution hath ſince obliged them to have ſeveral volumes on the anvill at
different preſſes at once, and to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched with ſuch
precipitation that the compoſitors have overlooked many litteral errors which
had been corrected by the authors, and which is ſtill worſe, this hath
likewiſe made it impoſſible for us to make the proper and neceſſary
references from one volume to the other as they were printed at the ſame
time, and not regularly one after another, as they ſhould have done, ſo
that in ſome caſes we could hardly refer to the volume much leſs to the
page; but the reader will find many inſtances of this laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:0401000300:332"/>I ſhall now give ſome few uſeful hints
how this work may be made compleat in a future edition by one ſingle hand, if
equal to the taſk; firſt, let whoever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes it read it all over again
attentively and regularly, one volume after another, and as he reads,
common-place every thing, perſon, fact, &amp;c. as if he deſigned it for a
compleat and copious index. Let him not depend upon that general one which is
ready made to his hand, at the end of the work, and where all theſe
needleſs repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, inconſiſtences, and contradictions may be artfully
omitted or concealed, but either make a full and exact one <hi>de novo,</hi> or
at leaſt conſult the printed one upon every point he reads over, and mark
down every ſuch omiſſion or concealment; though were it my caſe I
ſhould rather prefer the former, becauſe there will be the leſs labour
loſt, as it will ſtand ready for ſuch when the work comes to be
reprinted, and he will have afterwards nothing to do but add the printed pages
to every article as they come in courſe, only if it ſhould be deemed too
full, he may ſtrike out afterwards ſuch as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of leſs moment. But he
will find <pb n="331" facs="tcp:0401000300:333"/> this ſingular benefit by ſuch an exact
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-placing of every thing, that it will diſcover to him at once every
needleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, every inconſiſtency and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction as he reads
on, which he may at the ſame time mark down in the margin of the book, in
order to correct them on the ſecond reading. He may then ſet down
likewiſe in the margin, the volume and page where the ſame thing is told
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where it is differently related or ſet in a different light, and in
caſes that admit a diſpute, by conſulting the original au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, be able
to judge which is right or moſt probable. Thus for inſtance, when he finds
the very ſame facts related in the hiſtories of Sicily, Rome and Carthage,
he will eaſily know where they ought to have been ſet down at length,
namely, where the ſcene of action happened, and where only to be referred to
it, viz. in the other two. So that whatever either the Romans or Carthaginians
tranſacted in Sicily, ſhould be only promiſed or referred to in their
hiſtory, and only related at full length in that of the Sicilians; and ſo
of the reſt. He will likewiſe by ſuch an index find <pb n="332" facs="tcp:0401000300:334"/> out where any facts or tranſactions have been differently related
or repreſented by each of their writers, who muſt of courſe be
ſuppoſed, and will upon trial be found to claſh often, for want of
frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring with each other, or duly conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and examining, or
perhaps ſome times of rightly underſtanding the original authors they
pretend to follow.</p>
            <p>By this means he will likewiſe be able to diſcover many facts
related in one place, which more properly belong to, or might be more
conveniently transferred to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and place them ſo accordingly in his
marginal notes. By that time he hath common-placed the whole ſet of volumes,
he will be likewiſe able to diſcover every material omiſſion under
every article, either from his own memory and reading, or by turning to the
index of ſuch books as treat of the ſame ſubject, and be able to ſupply
every ſuch defect from them. Thus in the articles of nations, as Jews,
Egyptians, Romans, &amp;c. or of cities, as Jeruſalem, Alexandria, Rome,
&amp;c. if he finds any thing material, which not being in his common-place
book, makes him conclude <pb n="333" facs="tcp:0401000300:335"/> it was omitted in the work, he
will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe eaſily ſupply from thoſe authors and their indexes, and
the ſame may be done by the articles of names of kingdoms, provinces,
monarchs, &amp;c. by furniſhing himſelf with the beſt modern authors who
have wrote of them, and ſupplying each with every thing he finds wanting in
his own common-place book, as well as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change ſome leſs material trifles
that are in this, for more momentous ones he will find in them, all which may
be done with little trouble, and he will ſtill reſerve to himſelf the
liberty of the difference in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted points he will meet with among
thoſe moderns, by having recouſe to the original ones; for he muſt make
it a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rule to himſelf, not to rely on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer which are more
copious than exact, without conſulting the latter, and where thoſe differ
among themſelves as they often do, to uſe all proper helps either to
recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them, or to chuſe the more probable ſide.</p>
            <p>This would have been the method I ſhould have taken, had I had
any ſhare in the reviſing any other but my own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar 
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0401000300:336"/> parts in the work; tho' I muſt ſtill have thought it
too much for any one to have reviſed the whole, and ſhould have thought it
neceſſary to have imparted the above mentioned rules to the reſt, in
order to have enabled them to have rectified every miſtake, contraſt, and
jarring, between their parts. For as I knew that all the hopes of the
proprietors, was in a ſecond, and more correct edition, to reimburſe the
loſſes they had ſuſtained by the firſt; I had their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to
compoſe the index to each of the volumes, (the firſt excepted, which was
done by the ſame hand that wrote the Roman hiſtory, and juſtly condemned
for its unneceſſary length and verboſity) by which I could obſerve as I
read along, and marked in the margin of the leaves, every needleſs
repetition, ſuperfluity, contrariety, omiſſion, tranſpoſition,
&amp;c. that would be neceſſary to make the next impreſſion more
compleat, eſpecially when I came to make the general one to the whole; and
was the better inabled by it, to reſcind and alter what I found amiſs or
ſuperfluous in thoſe parts that came more immediately under my care, though
I have had ſince <pb n="335" facs="tcp:0401000300:337"/> reaſon to think I have gone too far
in it, and out of complaiſance to the proprietors, who complained that my
Jewiſh hiſtory was too diffuſe for a work of this nature, have been
prevailed on to ſtrike out in this ſecond edition many curious things,
which I have ſince found had been very well liked and approved of in the
firſt. But without ſuch reſciſions it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring the
whole within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs propoſed, eſpecially as they were ſo much
neglected in ſeveral other parts of the work, which would at leaſt as
conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently admit of them, ſuch as the Dyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes of the Egyptians, the
hiſtory of Perſia from the oriental writers, and many other ſuch fabulous
abſurdities. However, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accuſe myſelf of having ſuppreſſed
any thing that was of moment in that hiſtory; though ſeveral perhaps, and
to my no ſmall regret, which would have been acceptable to the curious in
that kind of learning. As for all the other parts within my province, I have
rather enlarged and improved them with new proofs, obſervations and curious
additions, as may be eaſily found by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the two editions
together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:0401000300:338"/>With relation to the deſiderata in both
editions, I cannot forbear taking notice that the ancient hiſtory of the
northern nations, ſuch as Moſcovy, Poland, Sweden, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, Norway,
&amp;c. hath been altogether omitted except ſome few hints that have been
given in that of the Scythians and Celtes, intimating only that the former were
originally deſcended from the latter. It is indeed commonly believed that
theſe remote nations have no records of their ancient times, but I had a
ſingular oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of being convinced of the contrary, by a learned
gentleman who was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of hiſtory, &amp;c. in the univerſity of
Abbo in Norway, but came to London moſtly every ſummer as an agent from the
king of Sweden, and among other new books, uſed to buy ſeveral ſetts of
the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Hiſtory for that Prince, for count Coningſegg, and other
great perſons in that kingdom. This gentleman having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a
deſire to Mr. Symons his book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller, and one of the proprietors, of
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with one of the authors, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with that of the Jewiſh
hiſtory, we ſoon came acquainted together, and upon <pb n="337" facs="tcp:0401000300:339"/>
my enquiring of him after ſuch records or monuments of thoſe northern
nations on which one might compile their ancient hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, gave me ſuch a
ſatisfactory account, as made me perſuade Mr. Symon, and the other
partners, to engage him to undertake it, which he, with ſome difficulty,
agreed to do, notwithſtanding his other avocations. I had the pleaſure of
ſeeing him every time he came to London, and to hear how well he proceeded in
the work; and accordingly in about three years he brought a large and elaborate
account of all the northern nations and countries, their origin, ancient
ſettlements, hiſtory, &amp;c. with many curious obſervations on their
geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, natural hiſtory, and the whole backed with ſuch good
authorities and proofs, as one would hardly have expected from ſuch barren
climes, and was recommended by ſeveral of the moſt learned men in Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and Norway, who had the peruſal, or even contributed to ſome part or other
of it.</p>
            <p>This chapter, which, according to our ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal plan, was to have
preceded the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Huns, Goths, Vandals, Suevi 
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0401000300:340"/> and into the ſouthern parts of Europe, would have
given a much better and clearer account of theſe barbarous nations, than that
which hath been given in the hiſtory of their new ſettlements in Hungary,
Italy, France, Spain, &amp;c. The misfortune was, that it proved too bulky
(though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be ſaid to be ſuperfluous or impertinent in it) it
being computed to amount to above ſeventy folio ſheets, for which they
could not find room, our work being already ſwolen vaſtly beyond its bulk;
ſo that Dr. Sidenius, that was the learned author's name, had the
mortification of having that curious part refuſed by the proprietors, and
returned upon his hands, the old ones, as Meſs. Symon and Batley, being dead,
and the reſt, except Mr. Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne in Grays-Inn, being gone off, and the new
ones not looking upon themſelves concerned in the agreement. And this I
mention with no ſmall regret, becauſe it was a conſiderable loſs to the
learned world, as well as to the author, and ſuch as I much fear will hardly
be ever recovered.</p>
            <p>In the interval between the concluſion of the firſt, and the
reſolution of printing the <pb n="339" facs="tcp:0401000300:341"/> ſecond, I was invited
into a ſhare of the new Syſtem of Geography, in which though the Public
found juſt fault with the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant length of that which related to Great
Britain and Ireland, I yet found the authors concerned in it, ſo well
qualified for the work, ſo communicative and punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual in their regular
meetings once a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, that I readily came into it, and found with
pleaſure the work carried on with more unanimity, exactneſs, and to the
ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the proprietors, as well as of the public. The parts I did
in that work were thoſe that follow. 1. Spain, Portugal and the iſlands
belonging to them. 2. Italy, Savoy, Piedmont, and the iſlands of Sicily,
Sardinia, Corſica, &amp;c. 3. Muſcovy both in Europe and Aſia. 4. Turky
in Aſia. 5. In Aſia, China, Japan, Jetzo, and the iſlands along thoſe
coaſts, particularly that of Formoſa, which part I choſe, that I might
take occaſion publickly to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as it were by a third hand, the
falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and impoſture of my former account of that iſland. 6. In
Africa, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Egypt, Abyſſinia, Lybia, Barbary, Tripoli, Tunis,
Morocco, Fez, with an <pb n="340" facs="tcp:0401000300:342"/> account of the Mediterranean Sea,
and the famed river of Sanaga. 7. The Azores iſlands. 8. In America, the
countries of Braſil, Magellan, Terra del Fuego, Canada, Louiſiana, and the
Bahamas and Bermudas iſlands. And by the time I had concluded theſe laſt,
I was called upon to prepare my reſpective parts of the Univerſal
Hiſtory, for the ſecond impreſſion mentioned above. I have however
found ſufficient reaſon to complain of the wrong management of this work in
ſeveral reſpects, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe carried on with greater exactneſs
and unanimity than that of the Univerſal Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and I ſhall now take
the liberty of mentioning ſome of the moſt conſiderable ones, becauſe
they have been the cauſe of ſome unavoidable errors and blunders, not only
in the two above mentioned works, but in moſt others that have been
publiſhed in the ſame or near the ſame way. The firſt is the authors
being tied to produce ſuch a number of ſheets in ſo ſhort a time as is
almoſt incompatible with their deſire, if any ſuch they have, of
performing their reſpective parts with any exactneſs; for, though the
publiſhers ſeldom fail of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting <pb n="341" facs="tcp:0401000300:343"/> the public
that the work is either already, or pretty near finiſhed and ready for the
preſs, ſo that there is no danger of its meeting with any delay or
impediment, yet that is ſeldom if ever the caſe, and with reſpect to the
works I am ſpeaking of, I found it quite the reverſe, and that they have
frequently been ſent to the preſs, under the promiſe of being regularly
pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, by ſuch a number of ſheets every week or month, when
ſcarcely a fourth part of it was written. So that, to prevent the retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the work, they have been obliged to call in for new helps, whom they have
obliged to engage to perform their part in leſs than half the time, that it
would have reaſonably required; conſidering that they not only had it all
to begin and go through in that ſhort ſpace, as was the caſe in this new
Syſtem of Geography, but that ſome of them were likewiſe engaged in
ſome other work, between which and this, they were forced to divide their
time and diligence, though either of them did more than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it all; and
how could it be poſſible for either to be performed as it ought?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:0401000300:344"/>Another miſmanagement from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
was, the interlarding every fourth or fifth number with a ſet of maps which
indeed gave ſome breathing time to the authors, but then it confined them to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all their directions concerning the limits, ſituation, longitude,
latitude, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, &amp;c. from thoſe maps, which being ſuch as the
engraver rather than the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors had made choice of, as the moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic
in his opinion, were not always ſo judiciouſly choſen as could have been
wiſhed. This made many errors remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and irretrievable, becauſe the
greateſt part of thoſe maps had been publiſhed in ſuch numbers,
ſeveral months before the authors were called upon to begin the geography of
thoſe countries. This I often complained of to the proprietors from the
beginning, both as a great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and a hardſhip upon the authors, who,
inſtead of being allowed to direct the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graver in the choice or compiling
of them, were obliged to follow him implicitly, and often contrary to their own
opinion and liking, in thoſe which he had thought fit to pitch upon for our
guide. Thus in the <pb n="343" facs="tcp:0401000300:345"/> map of Japan, for inſtance, the
land of Jetzo is affirmed to be the ſame with Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchatta, though contrary
to fact, it not being ſo much as part of it. I might add likewiſe, that
thoſe maps confined us to the orthography of places, though very often
erroneous, or being of foreign extract, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed a wrong ſound of the name
to an Engliſh ear.</p>
            <p>But the moſt conſiderable miſmanagement was in the choice of
ſuch printers as bore indeed the greateſt ſway and intereſt, and who
conſequently had ſuch a glut of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that every thing was
diſpatched with the utmoſt hurry and precipitation, in order to keep up to
their time. This never failed cauſing a great deal of confuſion and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correctneſs in the printing, particularly in the othography of proper
names, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authors a great deal of trouble in correcting the
proofs, which, however, was but too often of no ſervice, through the hurry
the compoſitors were in, which made them overlook and often neglect thoſe
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. It frequently happened likewiſe, that they required ſuch a
quick diſpatch of the author, in correcting the ſheets, that 
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0401000300:346"/> they had not time enough to read them over with that
carefulneſs they would otherwiſe have done; ſo that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
could not avoid overlooking even ſome material errors in the ſpelling, but
moſt chiefly in the numbers and figures. As for me, it being my conſtant
rule not to be engaged in two works at once, I never would let a proof go out
of my hands, without a ſecond, and, in ſome caſes, a third reading, but I
have often found that I might as well have ſaved myſelf that labour,
ſince the correctors or compoſitors had not time enough left to make the
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per emendations, and ſometimes have ſent the ſheet to the preſs
before the proof hath been returned.</p>
            <p>To prevent this unfair dealing, as I may juſtly call it, or at
leaſt to lay the blame at the right door, I had taken a method of
inſiſting upon having two proofs, of each ſheet, ſent me from the
preſs; under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of keeping one of them by me, to refer to when it was
requiſite, but in fact by correcting both proofs alike in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, to be
able to produce that which I kept by me, againſt both the compoſitor, 
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0401000300:347"/> and corrector, when ever they were guilty of any ſuch
neglect. But as ſoon as my deſign was found out by them, ſome
plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible excuſes were made, for not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſend duplicates, and
I was forced to give up that point, unleſs I had a mind to diſoblige the
very maſter printers, who were ſome of the richeſt, and bore the
greateſt ſway with the proprietors, and had already deprived us, under the
pretence of diſpatch, of the privelege of reviſing our copy, after our
firſt correction. This laſt indeed was denied us, on account of the
unreaſonable trouble, which one of the authors too frequently gave them, in
thoſe reviſes at the firſt ſetting out? who did often require three or
four of them, and every one loaded with new, and moſtly needleſs
alterations, which took up ſo much of the compoſitors time that they were
obliged to complain of it. This was, though true with reſpect to one author,
but a poor pretence for depriving the reſt of the liberty of one ſingle
reviſe, which they chiefly inſiſted on, not ſo much to make any
neceſſary alterations, as only to be ſatisfied that none of their
corrections were <pb n="346" facs="tcp:0401000300:348"/> overlooked. However, the point was
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by the printers; and that material check being taken off from the
compoſitors, the literal errors multiplied ſo faſt upon us, eſpecially
in the words and quotations out of the eaſtern languages, that we were
obliged to take notice only of ſuch as were of the greateſt moment in the
table of errata of the firſt edition, and to curtail as many of thoſe
foreign words as we could in the ſecond, eſpecially thoſe of the Arabic,
Hebrew, and Syriac kind.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the principal cauſes of that
incorrectneſs which commonly, I had almoſt ſaid unavoidably, happen in
theſe kinds of works, let an author be ever ſo deſirous and careful to
avoid them, unleſs he hath ſo great a ſway over the printers, that they
dare not refuſe him the liberty of reviſing his own work as often as he
ſees it needful. And the leaſt that he can inſiſt on, for his own
credit and ſatisfaction, is a reviſal of every proof after it hath been
corrected by him.</p>
            <p>I did take occaſion to mention a little higher the wrong
information which Mr. Palmer gave me concerning Biſhop Hare's Metrical 
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0401000300:349"/> Pſalter, which was, unknown to me, put into Mr.
Bowyer's hands to print, whilſt I was writing the firſt part of the
Jewiſh hiſtory, and as there had elapſed ſeveral years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the
time, in which Mr. Palmer was applied to by Dr. Waſhburn, and that of my
becoming in courſe to write on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Hebrew poetry, which had
confirmed me in the opinion that the biſhop's deſign was quite ſet
aſide; I made no difficulty to affirm after the generality of the learned
writers on that ſubject, that the metre of the Hebrew Pſalms and other
poetical pieces in the Old Teſtament, was looked upon as irretrievably
loſt, notwithſtanding the efforts of ſome, and the pretences of others,
who vainly imagined they had or were in the way of recovering it. I backed my
opinion with ſome new arguments which had occurred to me during my
fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſearch after it, and which appeared to me to carry no ſmall
force. This part, which was contained in the ninth number of the firſt
volume, was ſcarcely publiſhed, before the biſhop's Pſalter came out.
It may be eaſily imagined that my curioſity would not permit me to be long
without <pb n="348" facs="tcp:0401000300:350"/> examining that performance, which ſeemed to
overthrow all that I had ſaid on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ſadly was I vexed
that my part was publiſhed before I had ſeen this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected piece. Had I
dreamed of any ſuch being ſo near coming out, I would doubtleſs have
ſuppreſſed mine till I had thereby examined it. What ſurpriſed me
moſt, and made me entertain ſome higher notion of that enterprize, was the
long inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val which had paſſed between the time of its being finiſhed
and offered to Mr. Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and that of its being publiſhed, which I reckon
to have been about ſix or ſeven years, and which I therefore ſuppoſed
the biſhop and his learned friend Dr. W—, had ſpent in the reviſing
and poliſhing it; but, upon ſtricter enquiry, I found the cauſe of that
delay to have been of a different nature, and was as follows.</p>
            <p>His lordſhip had excepted againſt Mr. Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's Hebrew types,
which were of Athias's font, and a little battered, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon his
having a new ſett from Mr. Caſlon, which greatly exceeded it in beauty. But
Mr. Palmer was ſo deep in debt to him, that he knew not well how to 
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0401000300:351"/> procure it from him without ready money, which he was
not able to ſpare. The biſhop likewiſe inſiſted upon having ſome
Roman and Italic types caſt with ſome diſtinguiſhing mark, to direct
his readers to the Hebrew letters they were deſigned to anſwer, and theſe
required a new ſett of punches and matrices before they could be caſt, and
that would have delayed the work, which Mr. Palmer was in haſte to go about,
that he might the ſooner finger ſome of his lordſhip's money. This put
him upon ſuch an unfair ſtratagem, which when diſcovered, quite
diſguſted his lordſhip againſt him, viz. repreſenting Mr. Caſlon as
an idle, dilatory work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who would in all probability make them wait
ſeveral years for thoſe few types, if ever he finiſhed them. That he was
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the only artiſt that could ſupply him with thoſe types, but that
he hated work, and was not to be depended upon, and therefore adviſed his
lordſhip to make ſhift with ſome ſort which he could ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute;
and would anſwer the ſame purpoſe, rather than run the riſk of
ſtaying ſo long, and being perhaps diſappointed. The 
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0401000300:352"/> biſhop, however, being reſolved, if poſſible, to
have the deſired types, ſent for Mr. Bowyer, and aſked him whether he
knew a letter founder that could caſt him ſuch a ſett out of hand, who
immediately recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended Mr. Caſlon; and, being told what a ſad and
diſadvantageous character he had heard of him, Mr. Bowyer not only
aſſured his lordſhip that it was a very falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt one, and
engaged to get the above-mentioned types caſt by him, and a new font of his
Hebrew ones, in as ſhort a time as the thing could poſſibly be done. Mr.
Caſlon was accordingly ſent for by his lordſhip, and having made him
ſenſible of the time the new ones would require to be made ready for uſe,
did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them according to his promiſe, and the book was ſoon after put
to the preſs; and this it was that had ſo long retarded its
publication.</p>
            <p>I was not long without it, and muſt own that his preface, in
which his lordſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, with uncommon learning and keeneſs, all the
ſyſtems that hitherto appeared in public, raiſed my expectation to a high
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. For if the metre of the ſacred book <pb n="351" facs="tcp:0401000300:353"/> could but
be ſuppoſed to come up to the loftineſs and dignity of the thoughts and
expreſſions, (and who could ever have doubted of it, that conſiders how
much greater genius the latter requires than the former?) it muſt I thought
have greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled that of Homer and Virgil. But how great was my
ſurpriſe, when upon reading on I found that his lordſhip had reduced it
to a poor low, crawling humdrum, bitony of trochaics and iambics, or <hi>vice
verſa</hi> as the reader pleaſed, and into which he might with eaſe, and
with much leſs than half the variations, maiming and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion of the
text, have reduced any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon proſe out of any language! How much more
ſtill to find in almoſt every line, words, and ſometimes whole verſes
mutilated, ſtretched out or lopped off, tranſpoſed or exchanged <hi>ad
libitum,</hi> in order to bring them to his ill contrived ſtandard! To hear a
learned prelate, with all the ſeeming gravity imaginable, affirm that the
Hebrew poetry, (which by the way was arrived to ſuch prodigious heights, with
reſpect to the grandeur and loftineſs of its figures and imagery, even ſo
early as <pb n="352" facs="tcp:0401000300:354"/> Moſe's time) was even ſo low as in David's
time, ſo crude, imperfect and vague, as not to have ſo much as a
determinate dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between long and ſhort ſyllables, eſpecially
conſidering to what a heighth of perfection that monarch had improved the art
of muſic; and, what is ſtill more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing than all the reſt, to
ſee his lordſhip, in conſequence of this his low conceit of the Hebrew
poetry, take ſuch pains to marr, deface, and deſtroy ſome of the moſt
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, lofty and complicated figures and alluſions in that ſacred
book, and ſuch as far excel all that is to be met with in the Greek and Latin
poets. But for theſe I muſt refer the reader to what I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of
the Hebrew poetry, and on that abſurd performance, in the Univerſal
Hiſtory (ſee vol. iv. of folio edition p. 710 <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> and
notes, and in the octavo one, vol. x. p. 202 <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> and note
(E). The occaſion of my being obliged to make thoſe animadverſions on it,
was as follows.</p>
            <p>I was ſo ſhocked at the freedom which that prelate took to
depreciate, muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and vilify ſo ſublime a ſet of the nobleſt and
moſt divine poems, that I <pb n="353" facs="tcp:0401000300:355"/> thought myſelf obliged to
write againſt him, and to expoſe, as they deſerved, all his unfair
criticiſms on it, all his forced emendations, and, above all, the abſurdity
of his new-diſcovered metre; but withal, in ſuch a reſpectful manner, as
was due to a perſon of his character. And in order to that, retired for three
months into Surry and Hampſhire, where I had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to conſult,
upon proper occaſions, ſome of my friends, who were no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to that
kind of learning. I found the taſk the leſs difficult, as I preſently
fell in among ſome of them, who not only condemned his performance, but had
raiſed already ſome very material objections againſt it, which they
readily communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to me as ſoon as they were appriſed of my deſign.
One of them among the reſt had (by way of expoſing his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
contemptible metre) reduced the Engliſh Lord's Prayer, Creed, Ten
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> into the ſame crawling meaſure;
whilſt I, who wholly confined myſelf to the Hebrew, had already done the
ſame by the firſt chapter of Geneſis, and the laſt chapter of 
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0401000300:356"/> Malachi, both which I had likewiſe turned into the
ſame dull verſe, without half the deviations from the text, which his
lordſhip had been forced to make in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Pſalm. Some of his very
pretended emendations proved ſuch, that the frequency of them directed me to
the diſcovery of a more elegant metre than he had ever dreamed of, and which
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me, as they have ſince many more Hebraiſts, that there was in
the metre of the Pſalms, not only a real and ſettled diſtinction between
the long and the ſhort ſyllables, but that two of the latter were
equivalent, in the conſtituting of a foot or verſe, to one of the former;
ſo that they had at leaſt three different kinds of feet, viz. long
monoſyllables, biſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, conſiſting of two long, and
triſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, conſiſting of two ſhort and one long, or <hi>vice
verſa;</hi> but which in the metre an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to a ſpondee, or two long
ſyllables. Of this I gave ſo many inſtances, as made me think, contrary
to what I had done till then, that the Hebrew metre was not ſo irrecoverably
loſt as I had imagined, and that a little more application than I 
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0401000300:357"/> had time then, or have had ſince to beſtow upon it,
might go near to recover moſt, if not all, the various kinds of it.</p>
            <p>However, as ſoon as I had finiſhed what I, and ſome of my
friends as well as I, thought a ſufficient confutation of the biſhop's
performance, and in the ſame, tho' not ſo florid and elegant a Latin, I
ſent to deſire one of my bookſellers to enquire of Mr. Bowyer, whether
the new types, caſt for his lordſhip, were ſtill in his
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion? and whether I might be permitted the uſe of them, in the
anſwer I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the preſs? I was anſwered in the affirmative;
but one bookſeller took it into his head to aſk at the ſame time, what
number of copies his lordſhip had cauſed to be printed of his Pſalter?
and was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered only five hundred; one half of which had been preſented
by his Lordſhip to his learned friends, both in and out of England, and
moſt of the reſt were ſtill unſold, there being but few among the
learned, that were curious in ſuch matters; the performance having been
diſapproved by all that had ſeen it. This news ſo cooled the
bookſellers eagerneſs after my anſwer, <pb n="356" facs="tcp:0401000300:358"/> that, upon
my coming to town, and their acquainting me with the ſtate of the caſe, I
was quite diſcouraged from printing it. For they concluded from what Mr.
Bowyer had ſaid, that it would be dangerous to print above three hundred of
mine, the charge of which being deducted, the profit, upon a ſuppoſition
that they were all ſold, would be ſo ſmall, that they could not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
me above two or three guineas for my copy (which would have made about ſeven
or eight ſheets of a middling octavo) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being loſers. This was their
way of computing the matter, againſt which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to object, I
locked up the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in my cabinet, where they have lain ever ſince. They
did indeed offer me better terms, and to print a greater number of copies, if I
would be at the trouble of print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in Engliſh, which they thought would
be more univerſally read, out of diſlike to the biſhop; but, beſides
that I cared not to be at the pains of Engliſhing it, I thought it below the
ſubject to print it in any other language, but that in which his was wrote,
and ſo wholly declined it.</p>
            <p>I lodged then with the curate of the <pb n="357" facs="tcp:0401000300:359"/>
pariſh<note n="*" place="bottom">St. Luke's, Old-ſtreet.</note>, who, upon my
coming from Hampſhire, told me the following ſtory, which I give on his
authority, for I never enquired farther into it—That his rector, the
reverend Dr. Nichols, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the biſhop, that he had a gentleman in his
pariſh, who deſigned ſhortly to publiſh a confutation of his Hebrew
metre. The biſhop aſked whether he was equal to the taſk? and was
anſwered, that he was thought ſo by all that knew him, and that he was the
perſon who had wrote the Jewiſh hiſtory, wherein he had given a greater
character of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew poetry than his lordſhip ſeemed to do in his book,
and that he was one of the perſons concerned in the writing of the
Univerſal Hiſtory. The biſhop then aſked his name, and being told that
he called himſelf Pſalmanazar, expreſſed himſelf with ſome warmth
to the company, that there was never a Jew of them all that underſtood any
thing of Hebrew, much leſs of the ſacred poetry; and being told that I was
no Jew, but in all appearance an honeſt and ſtrict churchman, who would
doubtleſs uſe his lordſhip with the reſpect due to 
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0401000300:360"/> his character; he appeared a little better
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied, and willing to ſuſpend his judgment, till he ſaw what I
had to ſay againſt him.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot forbear making an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, or two, on his
lordſhip's ſpeech, taking the ſtory for true, which I am the more
inclined to believe to be ſo, becauſe he was always known to have a
ſingular contempt of the Jews, ſo far as related to their knowledge of the
Hebrew tongue. The one is, that his mean opinion of them muſt be owing to his
ſmall acquaintance with them; otherwiſe he might have found in London
ſeveral of them very learned in that tongue, (beſides a much greater
num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber abroad, eſpecially among the northern ones) and who, bating their
different interpretations of thoſe main prophecies which relate to the
Meſſiah, could have diſplayed to him a much greater and deeper ſkill in
that ſacred tongue, than he appears to have had, by any thing one can find in
his book. The other is, how his lordſhip came to take Salmanazar for a
Jewiſh, inſtead of an Aſſyrian name; for as the monarch ſo called,
was one of thoſe monarchs who carried away part of Iſrael 
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0401000300:361"/> captives into Aſſyria; a Jew would as ſoon call a
ſon of his Beelzebub, as Salmanazar, or Nabuchadnezzar.</p>
            <p>However, the abovementioned ſtory, as well as the expectation
which my friends in Hampſhire, Surry, and London, were in, to ſee my
anſwer to him, gave me no ſmall regret, leſt my not publiſhing it
ſhould be interpreted in favour of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, or as my yielding the
point to him, as not being able to confute him. And could I have afforded it, I
would have run the hazard of printing it at my own charge; for I was above
doing it by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, it being ſo ſmall a thing as a pamphlet of
at moſt eight octavo ſheets; and much more loth was I, all the above things
conſidered, to let a work ſeemingly calculated to depreciate the excellence
of the ſacred poetry of the Old Teſtament, to go uncenſured; eſpecially
as I had ſo many ſtrong objections ready levelled againſt it. At length a
thought came into my mind, as I was then preparing new materials for the
ſecond part of the Jewiſh hiſtory, to reſume that ſubject there. And
this I thought, I was ſo much better intitled to <pb n="360" facs="tcp:0401000300:362"/> do,
if it were but in defence of what I had ſaid in the firſt part in praiſe
of the Hebrew poetry, and which was, in moſt caſes, quite oppoſite to the
character, which his lordſhip gave of it in his book. The collecting, and
compleating of the canon of the ſacred books by Ezra, and other inſpired
writers, and their appointing of the proper leſſons, pſalms, &amp;c. for
the divine worſhip, gave me a fair opportunity for it, which I was the more
ready to take, as I knew that it would be read by many more people in ſuch a
work as that, than in a Latin pamphlet, and would of courſe more effectually
expoſe the abſurdity of his pretended new-found metre, as well as the
unſeemly freedom he hath given himſelf in altering and mutilating the
ſacred text for the ſake of it. I therefore reſolved to take notice, in
juſtice to his lordſhip, of all juſt, laudable, and uſeful
diſcoveries he had made on that ſubject in the text, and to throw the main
part of my objections againſt the reſt of his book in a long note, in the
moſt ſuccinct and impartial manner I could, in hopes that the ſetting
both forth, as it were, in one view, might probably <pb n="361" facs="tcp:0401000300:363"/>
excite ſome who had more learning and leiſure than I, to follow the hints
there given, as the moſt likely means for compleating the deſired
diſcovery, to which his lordſhip had in a great meaſure opened the way,
though he had ſo unhappily miſcarried in the end. The difficulty was how to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract my materials ſo as not to over-ſwell that part of the work, as it
muſt have done if I had brought every thing into it, which I had wrote on
that ſubject, and this obliged me to ſtrike off near two thirds of them,
and to confine myſelf to the moſt material points, ſuch as would moſt
effectually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the two main ends I had in view, viz. the exploding the
biſhop's new metre, and giving the curious reader, that would go about it, a
clue to find out the original one of the ſacred books; for as to what I
deſigned to have ſaid in praiſe of the Hebrew poetry, had the ſubject
been printed ſeparately, it was the leſs neceſſary here, as I had
already expatiated ſo much upon it in the firſt volume. Some of the
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors and authors were indeed againſt my deſign, not only as it
would ſwell the chapter beyond its length, but likewiſe as 
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0401000300:364"/> the ſubject in queſtion appeared to them, foreign to
the reſt of its contents; but I had the pleaſure not only to carry my point
againſt them, but likewiſe to have the performance commended by ſeveral
learned men as well as by all my friends; inſomuch that upon my conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeveral of them, whether I might not in the ſecond or octavo edition (in
which we were obliged to contract our materials, in order to reduce the whole
within the propoſed limits) either wholly omit or content myſelf with a
ſhort men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what I had done more at large in the folio; they adviſed
me by no means to curtail the main ſubject, though I might, they thought,
eraze here and there an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planatory or critical note, which I readily complied
with.</p>
            <p>Soon after I had concluded my laſt part of the Ancient
Hiſtory, the proprietors and authors had ſome meetings together to
conſult upon the going on with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, and ſeveral plans were
propoſed by different perſons of learning and capacity. The misfortune was,
that this part likewiſe was to be confined within the compaſs of 
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0401000300:365"/> twenty volumes, of the ſame bulk with the Ancient, and
theſe gentlemen differed ſo much in the proportion they allowed to each
reſpective country or kingdom, that we could ſee but little likelihood of
mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any tolerable computation, either of what the whole might reaſonably
amount to, or of what number of ſheets might be properly allowed to each
hiſtory. As for me, the more I conſidered the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the work,
and the number of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and kingdoms which had not ſo much as been touched
upon in the Ancient part, ſuch as Turkey, India, the great Mogul, Tartary,
China, Japan, &amp;c. the greateſt part of Africa, and the whole tract of
America, to ſay nothing of Ruſſia and ſeveral other northern countries
in Europe; the more I was perſuaded of the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of reducing the
whole within ſo ſmall a number of volumes, unleſs it was done rather by
way of epitome, than of compleat, though ever ſo ſuccinct, a hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.
But though this appeared ſtill more viſible by the ſmall number of
ſheets which theſe plans, however different, allotted to moſt parts of
the work, and muſt have <pb n="364" facs="tcp:0401000300:366" rendition="simple:additions"/> received by almoſt
every reader, at the firſt view, yet the proprietors who had their particular
reaſons for fixing upon that number of volumes, would by no means conſent
to have it exceeded. This how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever occaſioned ſome demur, during which
ſome of the beſt judges in this kingdom, and out of it, were conſulted,
as well as about the propereſt method of beginning and purſuing this modern
part.</p>
