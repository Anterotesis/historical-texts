            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Turky</hi> Company wou'd
be but ill Charg'd with ſo
much Art in the Conduct of
their Trade, if they were
capable of uſing no Art in the
Defence of it.</p>
            <p>No Man can charge them with want
of Cunning in what they now puſh at,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0665600300:3"/>
and had they us'd as much Honeſty
in their Argument as they ſhew Art in
their Deſign, ſome plain Queſtions and
Anſwers wou'd bring us all to the
End of the Diſpute; and the Houſe of
Lords had not had the Trouble of this
Act.</p>
            <p>The Papers they have hitherto pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd,
have generally aim'd at two
Things, and both of them ſeem to be
unfair, and ſomething ſophiſtical:
I am loth to call it Shuffling, with
reſpect to the Perſons of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
concern'd; but Neceſſity obliges
me to ſay, That what they offer, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
looks one Way but means ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the ſpecious Pretences they make
for the publick Good of Trade, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of Manufactures, and the
like, are only Covers to conceal the
grand End of ſeparate Intereſt; which,
'tis manifeſt, is the Thing they aim
at.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. They pretend in their Papers, to
advocate for the Good of their
Country, againſt the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given by the <hi>Italian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
to the <hi>French,</hi> to ſell their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0665600300:4"/>
Cloth in <hi>Turky,</hi> by taking off the
Raw Silk, which is the Return;
whereas really, they are in their
Capacity as a Company, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of all the Encouragement the
<hi>French</hi> meet with in the <hi>Turky</hi>
Trade; and if it were not for the
ill Conduct of the <hi>Turky</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the <hi>French</hi> wou'd have no
Silk to ſell, nor vend any Cloth
in <hi>Turky</hi> worth naming.</item>
               <item>2. They pretend, that the ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Turky</hi> Company is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Trade; whereas their
being a Company, in the Senſe of
their preſent Management, is the
great Obſtruction of the Trade;
and will, if not reſtrain'd, be the
Ruin of it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>In their Papers, therefore, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
they aim (1.) at ſuppreſſing the
<hi>Italian</hi> Merchant's Trade to <hi>Turky;</hi>
and (2.) at engroſſing the Trade of
ſelling Cloth in <hi>Turky,</hi> and of Silk in
<hi>England,</hi> in order to impoſing their
own Price upon the Buyers of Cloth
Abroad, and the Manufacturers of
Silk at Home. Both which would, if
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0665600300:5"/>
obtain'd, effectually declare them a Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly,
in the groſſeſt Senſe of that Word.</p>
            <p>Their Oppreſſions Abroad, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
Dealings with the Merchants, who
from <hi>Leghorn</hi> interfere, as they call it,
with their Trade; their By-Laws, their
arbitrary Proceedings upon them, and all
the reſt of their ill Conduct, they give
up, and ſeem to plead Guilty to them all,
ſo they can but get this Bill.</p>
            <p>With ſo much Eagerneſs they puſh for
this Bill, that they not only manag'd
their Introduction into it with the utmoſt
Art, and puſh'd it on with unweary'd
Application, to hinder their Books being
look'd into, but they ſaid they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to conſent to any future Laws, to
limit, nay, even to puniſh their Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
ſo they may but be indulg'd with
the Advantages they drive at in this Bill.</p>
            <p>In a Word, they were in ſuch a Paſſion
for this darling Bill, that they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to give up their Reputation as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
ſubmit to all the Parliament may
think fit to do with them, or all the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
that may be inflicted upon them,
provided they may but ſave THIS BILL.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0665600300:6"/>
It is their own Expreſſion in one of
their Caſes: <hi>Poſſibly the</hi> Turky <hi>Company
may have committed Faults, and made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
By-Laws: If they have done both,
yet</hi> THIS BILL <hi>may be neceſſary.</hi> And
in another Place, <hi>All that can be objected
against the</hi> Turky Company, <hi>may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy'd
by a</hi> BILL <hi>in another Parliament,
and they may take</hi> ANOTHER TIME <hi>for
the remedying of it. If a Company op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes,
the Parliament may curb and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
it by</hi> FUTURE LAWS. And the
like.</p>
            <p>I wou'd not treat the Company with
Indecency, but this ſeems to me to be
little more than that of a Man detected of
a grievous Treſpaſs, craving Leave for an
immediate Power to oppreſs and injure
his Neighbour, and putting off the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
and Puniſhment of his own
Crime to another Seaſon; as if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying
the Grievance on one ſide, had
not the ſame Juſtice in it, and did not
call for the ſame Concern of the Publick
to rectify, as the other. I might have
illuſtrated this by a more ſevere Simily,
if I were willing to carry Things to the
heighth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0665600300:7"/>
But let us take theſe Gentlemen in their
own Way, and uſe their own Words, as
above: <hi>Poſſibly the Company have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Faults, and made unfitting By-Laws:</hi>
It is moſt certain they have, (and I inter
what I believe every one will grant, <hi>viz.</hi>)
Therefore it is not reaſonable, thoſe that
have already abus'd their Power, ſhou'd
be now enabled to abuſe it farther. And
I humbly hope that the Nature of the
Companies By-Laws and Orders may be
inſpected.</p>
            <p>What they now aſk, is neither more
or leſs, than to have a Power granted
them to oppreſs and injure the Traders
to <hi>Turky</hi> by way of <hi>Italy;</hi> who, they grant
already, they have injur'd and oppreſs'd.
As to the Bill they demand, the Nature
of it ſhall preſently appear, when the
Fraud of the Deſign is more effectually
laid open. Something extraordinary muſt
ſure be the Caſe, that theſe Men are ſo
very earneſt to have the Examination of
the Conduct of the <hi>Turky</hi> Company put
off; it is a ſhrewd Suſpicion of Guilt,
when Men are ſo extraordinary ſhy of
coming to an Examination; ſee how it
runs thro' all their Arguings: <hi>If the Bill
paſſes,</hi> ſay they again, <hi>the Conduct of the</hi>
Turky Company, <hi>all their</hi> By-Laws, <hi>and</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0665600300:8"/>
               <hi>even their</hi> Charter, <hi>if lyable to any juſt
Exceptions, may be examin'd afterwards
by Parliament.</hi> Very good, and why not
now? Why muſt not the Parliament be
allow'd to examine Now into their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
their By-Laws, their Oppreſſions,
their arbitrary Proceedings, and their
Charter, if lyable to Exceptions, as there
is ſome Reaſon to believe they all are?</p>
            <p>Nor is the examining into theſe Things
ſo incongruous to the Bill depending as
they would inſinuate: I alledge, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to make it appear, that the Bill
they ſeek cannot be rational, if the other
Conduct of the Company is fully examin'd
into; and therefore it is not at all unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to demand, that both be enter'd
into together; 'tis a great Miſtake to ſay,
that the Conduct of the Company has no
Relation to this Bill. On the contrary,
if the Company have miſbehav'd, if they
have oppreſs'd and injur'd the Fair-Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
if their by-Laws are unjuſt, and
they are a real Monopoly, and ablove all,
if they ſeek to be able to act as a Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly
by Virtue of this Bill, then 'tis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
neceſſary to examine their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
before this Bill ſhould paſs. <hi>As for
Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0665600300:9"/>
If this Bill in its Nature tends to
making the Company a Monopoly; if it
is evident, that in ſoliciting <hi>this Bill,</hi>
they aim at a Power to monopolize; if
it appears, that <hi>this Bill,</hi> if paſs'd, will
put that Power into their Hands: Then,
with humble Submiſſion to the Houſe, it
is abſolutely neceſſary to examine into
the Abuſe of the Power they have, and
the Reaſon of the Power they ſeek, and
of their ſeeking it, and all before this
Bill be ſuffer'd to paſs.</p>
            <p>And what can it be, but this plain
Dependance of theſe Things, one upon
another, that makes theſe Men ſo back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to have their Conduct examin'd?
But that they are ſenſible, that if the
Houſe ſhould ranſack their Behaviour and
the Uſe they have made of the Powers
and Privileges which they have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
with, they would ſee very good
Reaſon to conſider well of it before they
entruſted them any farther.</p>
            <p>Nor is this an unjuſt or an unfair Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
becauſe we that are oppreſs'd by
the Company, and have Reaſon, feelingly,
to mention the Abuſe of the Powers they
have been entruſted with, have much
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0665600300:10"/>
more Reaſon than other Men to conclude
what Uſe they would make of it, if far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Powers were committed to them as
a Company.</p>
            <p>And here, becauſe I am neceſſarily to
enter with Plainneſs and Freedom upon
the Detecting a general Scheme of Fraud
and Injuſtice, which evidently ſeems to
run thro' the whole Courſe of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that, as above, much leſs Honeſty
than Art ſhews itſelf in the earneſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations
which are and have been made
for this Bill, I muſt be allow'd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
between the Gentlemen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in their perſonal and private Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,
and in their Capacities as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>In
their former Capacities, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the leaſt to ſay; here is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Satyr intended, nor do I direct any
Reflection, in this Affair, to this or that
particular Man. There are, without
Doubt, many worthy and honourable
Perſons in the <hi>Turky</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>But their Conduct, as a Company, is
another Thing; and no Man's private
Reputation is concern'd in it; and yet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0665600300:11"/>
I muſt acknowledge my ſelf to be of the
ſame Mind which King <hi>Charles</hi> IId gave
as his Opinion to a certain Lord Mayor
of <hi>London,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>) That it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for a Man to act in a Society with
the ſame Honeſty and Juſſice as in their
ſeparate and private Capacities; but that
all Societies and Companies were Tyrants
and Oppreſſors by the Nature of the
Thing.</p>
            <p>Having made theſe Poſtulata with the
Gentlemen-Members of the Company, as
private Perſons, I ſhall, with the more
Freedom, ſpeak to their Behaviour as a
Company.</p>
            <p>I have mention'd how ſtrange it is that
theſe Gentlemen ſhould be ſo very Earneſt
for this Bill, and for its paſſing, without
enquring into their Conduct. I ſhall now
unravel this Myſtery, and lay it open to
the World; and when I have done ſo,
the Wonder will ceaſe.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The firſt Reaſon is, becauſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
into their paſt Conduct,
will neceſſarily diſcover the True,
but conceal'd Deſign of <hi>the Bill.</hi>
               </item>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0665600300:12"/>
               <item>2. It will diſcover the Reaſon for
endeavouring to obtain it.</item>
               <item>3. It will diſcover the Conſequences
of it, if obtain'd.</item>
            </list>
            <p>That the Diſcovery of any, or of all
theſe Things, would moſt effectually o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
the Bill, ſeems reaſonable for
me to conclude, from the Knowledge I
have of the certain Application of the
Houſe of Peers, to detecting all clandeſtine
Meaſures, Projects, and Attempts, couch'd
under the ſpecious Pretence of Right,
Property, Publick Good, and the like;
by which the Subjects are frequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
upon, the Publick abus'd, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Perſons injur'd.</p>
            <p>It will be impoſſible the Houſe can ſee
the exact Connection that there is between
the former Conduct of that Company and
the Attempt couch'd under the Cover of
<hi>this Bill,</hi> and not ſee how artfully they
ſeek to protect their paſt ill Conduct, by
obtaining an Authority for worſe; and
to ſupport the Oppreſſions of their former
Meaſures, by enlarging them in thoſe
they ſhould now get Power to act by.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0665600300:13"/>
To bring this Home to the Point in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
that is to ſay, <hi>the Bill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pretences of the Bill are ſpecious,
(<hi>viz.</hi>)
<list>
                  <item>1. That the Raw Silk which the

<hi>Leghorn,</hi> is <hi>French,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
for their <hi>French</hi> Cloths ſold
in <hi>Turky.</hi>
                  </item>

The chiefeſt Evidence they bring of it,
is, That in the Years 1714 and 1715, a
very great Quantity of Raw Silk was
bought in <hi>France,</hi> brought to <hi>Leghorn,</hi>
and ſhipp'd to <hi>England.</hi> Now, tho' I
ſhould grant this, that in thoſe two Years
a great deal of <hi>French</hi> Raw Silk was brought
from <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> yet that will neither prove
that it has been ſo in other Years, or that
it can ever happen ſo again: Nor if it were
to happen again, can they argue from it
any Advantage to the <hi>French</hi> Trade, or
Diſadvantage to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but juſt the
contrary, as will appear in the following
Heads:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. From the Reaſon and Occaſion of the
<hi>French</hi> Merchants having that great
Quantity of Raw Silk upon their
Hands at that Time (<hi>viz.</hi>) That they
had a Proſpect of an open Trade with
<hi>England</hi> for their Wrought Silks,
<hi>the Treaty of Commerce being then on
foot here;</hi> Which failing, and the
Alteration of their Coin happening
at the ſame Time, they were oblig'd
to ſell off the Silk Raw at a very
great Loſs; ſo that half the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiers
of <hi>Paris,</hi> half the Banquiers
of <hi>Lions,</hi> and almoſt all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0665600300:15"/>
at <hi>Marſeilles</hi> were ruin'd by
it, and became Bankrupt, having loſt
above one third of the Value of their
Capital Stock. If this be the Way
that the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
encourage the <hi>French</hi> Trade,
the <hi>French</hi> will have little to boaſt
of, and the <hi>Levant</hi> Company little
to complain of.</item>
               <item>2. It is well known that the <hi>French</hi>
did not receive that great Quantity
of Silk, which was then upon their
Hands, in Return for Cloth, or any
Manufactures; all the Cloth that
cou'd have been in <hi>France</hi> cou'd not
have purchas'd it; but they ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Ready Money, and bought up
ſuch a Quantity, <hi>upon the Proſpect</hi>
of Advantage by the Treaty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
in <hi>England, as above;</hi> the
Diſappointment of which was the
Ruin of ſo many Merchants there.</item>
               <item>3. When the Raw Silk in <hi>France</hi> was
thus cheap, and bought by us ſo
much to their Loſs, it was greatly
wanted in <hi>England;</hi> and the Price
in <hi>January</hi> 17 14/15, refus'd by <hi>Turky</hi>
Merchants here was 30<hi>s.</hi> and 32<hi>s.</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0665600300:16"/>
                  <hi>per lb.</hi> and there was not Silk enough
to be had in <hi>England</hi> to employ our
Weavers, or to carry on our own Silk
Manufacture; <hi>ſo that</hi> at this Time,
which theſe Men dwell ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Importation of <hi>French Turky</hi>
Silk, was infinitely the Advantage
of our Trade, and in Proportion
ruinous to <hi>France.</hi> And the Silk ſo
Imported was about <hi>June</hi> 1715 ſold
to our Manufacturers in <hi>London,</hi> at
23 <hi>s.</hi> And the Price will be always
kept low, ſo long as there can be
two Importations.</item>
            </list>
            <p>This ſufficiently anſwers the great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
in the Years 1714, 1715, on
which theſe Men inſiſt ſo much; and
proves that it was a Circumſtance of Trade
which can never happen again; and if
ever it ſhou'd, wou'd, every Bale of it, be
an incredible Advantage to <hi>England,</hi> and
a Diſadvantage to <hi>France.</hi> And 'tis hop'd
that an extraordinary Caſe, which can
never in the ordinary Courſe of Trade
happen again, will not be look'd upon a
ſufficient Reaſon to break into an Act,
which is the ſupport of our Navigation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0665600300:17"/>
That it cannot be thus now, is plain,
and the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants have made it
appear ſo, by the Calculation of the Price
of Silk at <hi>Leghorn</hi> and at <hi>London;</hi> which
generally is, and for the laſt three Years
has been, from 1 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> to 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per lb.</hi>
cheaper in <hi>London</hi> than at <hi>Leghorn;</hi>
which is a ſure Rule to judge by, why
this Importation cannot be conſiderable;
for that Merchants never extend or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
a Trade that they cannot carry on
but to Loſs. Nor, indeed, can there ever
be any conſiderable Importation of Raw
Silk from <hi>Leghorn,</hi> but when the <hi>Turky</hi>
Company, by their oppreſſive Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and other monopolizing Arts, reſtrain
or with-hold the Importation of a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
ſufficient for the Market, on purpoſe
to advance the Price for their private
Gain. And this Engroſſing is ſo eaſy to
them, ſuch a Grievance to Trade, and ſo
injurious to our Manufactures in <hi>England,</hi>
that even the Poſſibility of their doing ſo
is an unanſwerable Reaſon againſt their
Bill, and proves, that it not only is not
NECESSARY, as they pretend, but that
it is abſolutely neceſſary their Power of
impoſing upon the Market, as above,
ſhould be reſtrain'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0665600300:18"/>
The <hi>ſecond Head,</hi> is the Quantity
which they pretend is Imported, to which
the <hi>Turky</hi> Merchants have annex'd no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
expecting to be taken upon their
Words. This Quantity they alledge to
be about an hundred Bales a Year; but
this the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants deny, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to the Cuſtom-Houſe Books for their
Proof: Alſo they have prov'd, at the Houſe
of Commons, that in the current Year, all
the Raw Silk imported at <hi>Leghorn</hi> from
<hi>France,</hi> amounts to no more than thirty
ſix Bales: And that <hi>Italy,</hi> for expence of
their own Silk Manufacture, annually
uſes two or three hundred Bales of <hi>Turky</hi>
Raw Silk.</p>
            <p>The laſt is, That this is injurious to
the <hi>Turky</hi> Trade; and this they explain
two Ways:
<list>
                  <item>1. That it is the Return of the <hi>French</hi>
Cloths ſold in <hi>Turky,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
aſſiſts the <hi>French</hi> in their
Sale of Cloth in <hi>Turky.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That it ruins the Market for the
<hi>Turky</hi> Raw Silk here at <hi>London,</hi> by
ſinking the Price of it ſo, as to make
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0665600300:19"/>
the Merchant loſe by his Goods, or
keep them on his Hands unſold.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is incumbent on the <hi>Levant</hi>
Company to prove, which they only bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſſerted; when, on the contrary, the
<hi>Italian</hi> Merchants prov'd, that from <hi>Leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,</hi>
according to the conſtant courſe of
Trade, all the <hi>Turky</hi> Raw Silk imported
from <hi>Italy,</hi> was the Return of <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Manufactures: And to this they offer'd to
call Merchants who had reſided there for
theſe Forty Years laſt paſt.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>ſecond,</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants
ſay, That the affording all Commodities
to our Manufactures cheap, is a General
Benefit; and the Importing them dear,
will make our Neighbours under-ſell us.</p>
            <p>Now, neither of theſe being true, as
above, how will it appear that this Trade
is injurious to the <hi>Turky</hi> Trade from and
to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Appearance of theſe Things being
thus, and all theſe Pretences for the Bill
being thus repeal'd and expos'd, it leads
me to the original Deſign of the <hi>Turky</hi>
Merchant's puſhing this Affair ſo warmly,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0665600300:20"/>
and to enquire what muſt be the true
Reaſons for their deſiring the Bill to ſtop
the Importation of ſo ſmall a Quantity
of Raw Silk, as, <hi>communibus annis,</hi> is
brought into <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Leghorn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Queſtion neceſſarily carries
me back to view the State of the <hi>Turky</hi>
Trade, which I ſhall ſtudy to do as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and with as much Brevity as I have
done the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Trade to <hi>Turky</hi> is carry'd on in a
Company; their Charter, their Privileges,
their Manner of carrying on their Trade
is known. The Number of Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in their Trade, or Free of their
Company, is great; they tell us, they are
above Two Hundred; and others may,
and indeed all, even the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants
themſelves, may be Free of this Company,
paying the uſual Fine at their Admiſſion,
and taking the Freedom of the City alſo.</p>
            <p>But, I ſuppoſe, it will not be contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Groſs of the Trade to <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky</hi>
is carry'd on by a very few Men, and
even of thoſe few, a yet fewer Number
have the governing Influence of the Trade,
and can go far, very far, to limit the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0665600300:21"/>
reſt by their Intereſt, to Ship or not to
Ship, Trade or not to Trade, as their
Quantities of Goods, Abroad or at Home,
want a Market, or want a Price.</p>
            <p>And as this is an Article which renders
the Company a moſt effectual Monopoly,
when they make Uſe of it; ſo it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that it is but a little while ſince
they did effectually make Uſe of it, to
the great Injury of the Trade; and this
Power, together with an Oath every Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
muſt take, if he will come in to be
Free of this Company, and which ſubjects
him to be ſubject to ſuch monopolizing
Arts as thoſe, is the Reaſon why the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Merchants have always declin'd the
Company, and carry'd on their Trade to
<hi>Turky</hi> by the Way of <hi>Leghorn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Favour of this Trade, which, as it
is a fair and juſt Branch of Commerce,
and was found to be very conſiderable;
but above all, as it was found to be a
juſt Check upon the <hi>Turky</hi> Company,
and calculated to prevent the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they were always apt to run into
for their private Ends, to the Injury of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade and Art of Navigation,
a Law particularly calculated for the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0665600300:22"/>
Encouragement of Trade, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of our Shipping, thought fit, by a
Clauſe on Purpoſe, to make Proviſion for
the Trade of the ſaid <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants,
and that they ſhou'd be allow'd to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Goods by Way of <hi>Leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And
here, I muſt ſay, lies the whole
Streſs of the Bill now depending: It is
this Trade to <hi>Turky,</hi> by the Way of
<hi>Leghorn,</hi> that the <hi>Turky</hi> Merchants puſh
at. The bringing ſome <hi>French</hi> Raw Silk
by Accident, and on an extraordinary Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
when it may be very cheap in
<hi>France,</hi> and very dear in <hi>England;</hi> this is
made the ſpecious Pretence, but is nothing
in the Caſe; it is the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchant's
Trading to <hi>Turky, Viâ Leghorn,</hi> that is
the Grievance. This is that they ſhoot
at, tho' they ſet up the other as a Blind.</p>
            <p>To clear themſelves of this, and if
they would have the Houſe believe them
to be as good Patriots as they pretend,
why do they not declare openly, that
they deſire nothing but to prevent the
bringing in <hi>Turky</hi> Raw Silk bought of
the <hi>French,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> may not be
encourag'd to carry on the <hi>Turky</hi> Trade
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0665600300:23"/>
to their Diſadvantage, and to ſend greater
Quantities of <hi>French</hi> Cloth to <hi>Turky,</hi> and
the like?</p>
            <p>Had this been the real and only Thing
they had ſought, what Need had they to
ſtrike at the Root of the <hi>Italian</hi> Trade,
which is ſo much more conſiderable and
advantageous than their own? Why Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
for the Repeal of a Clauſe, which
admits them to bring Home the Returns
of their Trade to <hi>Turky?</hi> Why had they
not only pray'd, that an ACT might
paſs to prohibit Raw Silk from <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
imported by Way of <hi>Leghorn?</hi> in
which all the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants would
readily have concurr'd, and are ſtill ready
to do it.</p>
            <p>Or, on the other hand, if they were
not aſham'd at thus publickly aiming to
monopolize both the Cloth Trade in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky,</hi>
and the Silk Trade in <hi>England;</hi> I
ſay, if they were not aſham'd of ſuch an
open Attempt to engroſs an excluſive
Trade, and that they could think a Houſe
of Commons, the Guardians of Liberty,
could be capable of being brought into
ſuch an Invaſion of the Liberties of Trade,
why did they not petition fairly, That
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0665600300:24"/>
the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants might not carry
<hi>Engliſh;</hi> Cloths, and Tin into <hi>Turky Viâ
Leghorn;</hi> or, in a Word, that, if they
did, they ſhould not be allow'd to bring
back the Returns of it into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This had been, indeed, to have acted
with leſs Cunning, but with more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,
than to aim and ſtrike fairly at
this Prohibition, under Pretence of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
bringing in <hi>French Turky</hi> Silk;
a Thing, which, as it is prov'd, is ſeldom
done, ſo it is plain it can never be done,
but to our Advantage, and the Loſs of
the <hi>French</hi> Merchants; <hi>unleſs it be,</hi> as
above, <hi>when the</hi> Turky <hi>Merchants have
put the Dice upon</hi> the Market, <hi>and rais'd
the Price to an unreaſonable and injurious
Heighth;</hi> and then the Refuge of a <hi>French</hi>
Market, or of any other Market, would
be but a Juſtice to the Manufactures, and
a juſt Check upon the Engroſſers.</p>
            <p>It ſeems neceſſary, in the next Place,
to give a ſhort State of this <hi>By-Trade,</hi> as
they would call it, from <hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Turky,</hi>
or from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Turky,</hi> by Way of
<hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0665600300:25"/>
The <hi>Turky</hi> Merchants take much Pains
to repreſent this Article as very ſmall and
inconſiderable; but why then do they
not propoſe to the Parliament, that in the
Bill they ſolicit for, a Clauſe be reſerv'd
for leaving this little, ſmall, inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Trade entirely free, and its Returns
free to be brought Home? If it be ſmall,
the Damage to them muſt likewiſe be
ſmall: Why is it ſo hotly oppos'd and
attack'd, if it were really ſo ſmall and
inconſiderable, as they repreſent it? I can
anſwer for the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants, that
they would not have ſtruggled with them
for the preſerving it; and even the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
made to them by the <hi>Italian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
is an Evidence to all the World,
that it is very far from being a ſmall and
inconſiderable Trade.</p>
            <p>By this very Thing the whole Quarrel
may be decided: If the <hi>Turky</hi> Merchants
aim only at, and deſire only the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the bringing <hi>French Turky</hi> Silk hither,
and are willing to leave the <hi>Italian</hi> Trade
to <hi>Turky,</hi> and back to <hi>England,</hi> by the
Way of <hi>Leghorn,</hi> open, as it always was,
let them ſay ſo; aſk for that, and the
<hi>Italian</hi> Merchants will heartily join with
them; but, while they thus puſh at one
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0665600300:26"/>
Thing, under Pretence of another, they
moſt plainly diſcover what they endeavour
to conceal.</p>
            <p>It is meet, therefore, to put this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
in a clear Light. The <hi>Italian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Trade to <hi>Turky</hi> by Way of <hi>Leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,</hi>
is far from being ſmall or inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable;
they export and ſell in <hi>Turky</hi>
from 40 to 50 Thouſand Pounds a Year
in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth, and in Tin, Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
a conſiderable Sum, and they bring back
the Returns of it to <hi>Leghorn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great Part of those Returns being ſold
in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Produce of which muſt be
clear Gain to the Publick Stock of <hi>Great
Britain,</hi> it would be very hard, if they
ſhould be deny'd the Privilege of <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Men, and of bringing Home the reſt to
ſell in their own Country, as Markets
may preſent.</p>
            <p>Except in the Caſes already mention'd,
they bring no Silk from <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and
nothing but the Exorbitances of the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky</hi>
Company impoſing upon the Markets,
as before, can make it practicable. If the
Houſe thinks fit, even to prevent it under
thoſe Exorbitances, they ſubmit it wholly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0665600300:27"/>
to the Wiſdom of Parliament; but they
humbly hope they have a Right of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
in common with the reſt of his
Majeſty's faithful Subjects, to bring back,
and vend in open Market, the Returns of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen Cloths, and other
Products of their own Country, which
they export, and without which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
carry on their Trade.</p>
            <p>While the Company oppoſe ſo juſt a
Requeſt, how can they take it ill, that
we ſay they are a dangerous Monopoly?
and how can they clear themſelves of
the Charge, while they ſeek to be the
only Exporters of Cloth to the whole
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, and the only Importers
of Raw Silk to the King's Dominions?
Is it not plain, that in this Caſe they would
conſult their own Advantages rather than
the Demands or Occaſions of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers?</p>
            <p>This
is the Article the Company viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
preſs for; and it cannot be deny'd but
it is of great Conſequence to them, that
is to ſay, to them perſonally, and as a
Company: but the more it is ſo, of the
more fatal Conſequence would it be to
the Trade in general, ſeeing they would,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0665600300:28"/>
as above, put their own Price upon their
Woollen Cloth at home, to the Impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing,
if not Deſtruction of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturer;
and their own Price upon their
Silk at Home: Nor would it weigh with
them, that by this Conduct they would
leſſen the Conſumption of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth
in <hi>Turky;</hi> and, to hold it up to a Price,
for their private Gain, keep it always
ſcarce at Market, forbidding their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in <hi>England</hi> to ſhip but in general
Ships, ſometimes once a Year, ſometimes
once in two Years, or more, as they think
fit; without regarding, that by this
Means there would be many Thouſands
of Cloths leſs exported than the Markets
would otherwiſe carry off, to the irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Damage and Diſcouragement of
Woollen Manufactures, and the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of the <hi>French;</hi> and the Ruin
of the Clothiers, who, when they had
made large Quantities of Cloth for the
<hi>Turky</hi> Trade, muſt be oblig'd to keep
them on Hand, or, perhaps, ſell them
under Price to two or three rich money'd
Men, who make Uſe of the Neceſſities
of the poor Clothiers for that very Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
all which ſtill proclaims them
a Sett of Monopolizers, in the worſt
Senſe of the Word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0665600300:29"/>
And this very Practice throws another
Charge back upon them, which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
can get off from, and which they now
endeavour to put upon the <hi>Italian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
<hi>viz.</hi> That whereas they alledge,
that the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants are the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter
of the <hi>French</hi> Trade to <hi>Turky,</hi> (the
contrary of which is manifeſt,) the <hi>Turky</hi>
Company, by not duly ſupplying the
Markets, by laying Mulcts and Reſtraints
upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth which comes there
by Way of <hi>Leghorn,</hi> by ſwearing their
Factors and Servants not to ſell any of
their Goods, but for preſent Payment;
whereas the <hi>French</hi> give Credit, where
there is any Certainty or Security of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paid. By theſe, I ſay, and many ſuch
like Methods, they are themſelves the
Encouragers, and, indeed, the Supporters
of the <hi>French</hi> Trade to <hi>Turky,</hi> who, on
the contrary, were the Markets conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fully ſupply'd, and proper Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
for Trade purſu'd, as would be, if
the Trade were open'd, as it might be,
would not be able to vend one quarter
Part of the Cloth which they now ſell
there. I do not mean by this, totally to
lay open the <hi>Turky</hi> Trade, but humbly
hope your Lordſhips, in your great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
will put it on the foot the <hi>Ruſſia</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0665600300:30"/>
Company was, by an Act of the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and I do
believe ſuch an Act would effectually drive
the <hi>French</hi> out of the <hi>Turky</hi> Trade, and
have the ſame effect that had, <hi>viz.</hi> That
inſtead of ſix or ſeven Sail of Ships the
then <hi>Ruſſia</hi> Company annually employ'd,
and the now <hi>Turky</hi> Company annually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys,
the next Year the <hi>Ruſſia</hi> Merchants
ſent 40 Sail of Ships, and do now annually
employ above a hundred and twenty, and
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactories are now carry'd
to Places where before they were never ſo
much as heard of: And this would be
the Caſe of the <hi>Turky</hi> Trade, were the
<hi>Levant</hi> Company regulated by a like
Act of Parliament; and the Honour
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation kept up with a
much leſs Charge on our Manufactures
than it now is; for the Trade being more
diffuſive, half <hi>per Cent.</hi> inſtead of two,
would be ſufficient to defray the neceſſary
National Charge.</p>
            <p>So that, in a Word, it is the <hi>Turky</hi>
Company who encourage the <hi>French;</hi> and
many Ways this may be made out: As
for Example, the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1707, by
laying a Mulct of five Dollars <hi>per</hi> Cloth
on all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth, which comes thither
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0665600300:31"/>
from <hi>Leghorn,</hi> when the <hi>French</hi> Cloth
comes in Free, forbidding <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth
from <hi>Leghorn</hi> to come in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships;
but permitting <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships to bring
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Cloth Free, as above.
They tell us, if we <hi>ſtop the</hi> French <hi>Silk
from coming hither, we deſtroy them at
once.</hi> How can they impoſe this upon
Mankind, when 'tis known, that all the
Cloth the <hi>French</hi> Merchant can ſend to
<hi>Turky,</hi> will not ſupply the Demand they
have for Silk in <hi>France?</hi> But they buy
a great deal with ready Money, as was
the Caſe thoſe two Years 1714 and 1715,
when they loſt ſo much Money by it, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ruin'd them all. And what muſt our
poor Manufacturers have done in <hi>England</hi>
in thoſe two Years, had they not been
ſupply'd by the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchant's buying
that Silk cheap? Is it not evident their
Goods muſt have coſt them here 40 <hi>l.
per Cent.</hi> more than the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
cou'd have imported them at; the
Conſequence of which muſt have been,
that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufacturers muſt have
been ſtarv'd, and Wrought Silks, from
all our neighbouring Manufactories, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of <hi>Turky</hi> Raw Silks, wou'd have
been run in upon us from Abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0665600300:32"/>
It is deny'd and has already been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
that <hi>Turky</hi> Raw Silk ever did or
ever can come from <hi>France</hi> hither, by
Way of <hi>Leghorn,</hi> in the ordinary Courſe
of Trade: 'Tis plain, it can never come
but when their Markets in <hi>France</hi> are ſo
full, and ſo low, as that they muſt ſell
it to great Loſs; or when our Markets,
ſtarv'd by the Cunning of the Company,
are ſo extravagantly dear, that to reduce
the Price will be our Gain; ſo that, in
ſhort, to bring the <hi>Turky</hi> Silk in either
of thoſe two Junctures, will be always to
our Gain, and to the Loſs of the <hi>French.</hi>
And in which of theſe two lies the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to <hi>France,</hi> I would fain have theſe
Gentlemen anſwer.</p>
            <p>But let us examine next, what Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
the <hi>Turky</hi> Company can pretend
to ſuffer from the <hi>Italian</hi> Trade: Can any
Merchants complain of the Competitors,
who cannot trade under them, but at a
Diſadvantage of 10 or 12 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and,
if they pleaſe, 20 or 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> unleſs
Means can be found to evade the Force of
their Impoſitions; it cannot be, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
muſt lie ſomewhere elſe, and it
is manifeſt it does ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> in the having
Power, by an excluſive Trade, to impoſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0665600300:33"/>
other Rates and Prices upon the Markets
Abroad and at Home, than they have ever
yet been able to do: This it is they aim
at, and this they find they can come at
no other Way, but by putting a Stop to
the Merchants ſending Cloth to <hi>Turky,</hi> by
Way of <hi>Leghorn,</hi> and bringing back the
Silk to <hi>London;</hi> and this they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
but by perſwading the World to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
than which <hi>nothing can be more
falſe,</hi> that this Silk comes from <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, to prove the Inconſiſtence of
this Pretence, I would deſire thoſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
to calculate the Price which this
Silk coſts the <hi>French</hi> Merchants in <hi>Turky,</hi>
whether it be bought for Cloth or for
Money; let them add to it the Charges
of carrying firſt to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> then bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
from <hi>Marſeilles</hi> to <hi>Leghorn,</hi> then ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
it again for <hi>England,</hi> Commiſſion in
all thoſe Places, and Charges of ſundry
Sorts, alſo Inſurance, and the like; and
then let them take the Price in <hi>France</hi> and
at <hi>London,</hi> at the ſame Time, and tell
us if the <hi>French</hi> gain, or loſe, by the
Trade: If the <hi>firſt,</hi> let them prevent it,
by ſuch legal Methods as they ſhall think
fit; If the <hi>laſt,</hi> which I affirm is true,
what can be the Meaning of ſo warmly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0665600300:34"/>
engaging againſt a Trade which the <hi>French</hi>
loſe Money by.</p>
            <p>I obſerve, in ſeveral of the Caſes given
out by the <hi>Turky</hi> Company, they would
be thought very popular, and claim it of
the World, that they are the great Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers
of the Woollen Manufacture, and
that they not only export great Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but that they take all proper Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
to encourage the Conſumption of it
in the Country whither they carry it.</p>
            <p>But, were this true, how comes it, that
there are ſo many By-Laws for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
any one to bring it thither but
themſelves; ſuch as laying a Mulct, or
Duty, of 25 Dollars <hi>per</hi> Bale, upon all
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth that ſhall come by Way
of <hi>Leghorn,</hi> not allowing it to be brought
in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, when, at the ſame Time,
<hi>as before,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Cloth, <hi>as
I have obſerv'd already,</hi> may come in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Bottoms; alſo forbidding their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
there to ſell any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth, but
for the Company, and the like.</p>
            <p>Let any indifferent Perſon judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this is encouraging, or whether it is
not rather a viſible Combination to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0665600300:35"/>
and deſtroy the Trade of our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Cloth in <hi>Turky.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With what Aſſurance can theſe Men
bring a Rabble of Packers and Cloth-Dreſſers,
Clothiers, and Dyers, and other
Mechanicks, up to the Door of the Houſe
to ſolicit in their Cauſe, as if the whole
Manufacture was concern'd? which is
making the poor ignorant Clothworkers
and Manufacturers ſo many Soliciters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
themſelves, and bringing them to
be Parties to their own Deſtruction, as
Manufacturers.</p>
            <p>So alſo they bring the Pewterers and
Dealers in Tin; inſinuating, that they
are great Benefactors to the Tin-mines;
ſuppoſing, perhaps, that this may have
ſome Influence on ſuch Members as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the Stannary Towns, and who are
ſuppos'd to have Eſtates in the Mines of
Tin in the Counties of <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal:</hi>
But are they ſo ignorant as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that the <hi>Corniſh</hi> Gentlemen do not
know that the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants are
much greater Exporters of Tin than the
<hi>Turky</hi> Merchants, even to above double
the Quantity, and that as well to <hi>Turky</hi>
as <hi>Italy?</hi> Which Things if duly known,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0665600300:36"/>
and if the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants were as much
enclin'd to make themſelves popular, and
needeed it as theſe Men do, would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
bring the Manufacturers, Dyers,
Dealers in Tin, and the like, to appear
on their Side, rather than on the other.</p>
            <p>But I leave all theſe little Things, as
Artifices too mean to be taken Notice of,
and fit only to aſſiſt a bad Cauſe. I come
next to enter into the Merit of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
with Regard to the Navigation. It
muſt be of ſome Concern to let the World
ſee how many Ways this Company, who
value themſelves ſo highly, are an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
and Diſcouragement to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,
and to the employing both Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and Seamen, even in this very Trade,
in which they would pretend to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
themſelves.</p>
            <p>They were indeed enquir'd of at the
Bar of the Houſe, how many Ships they
employ'd to <hi>Turky</hi> in a Year, and tho'
I hear they anſwer'd falſly, and ſaid,
Ten; which is more than they employ,
and in ſome Years ſend none at all; yet,
at beſt, what Number of Ships is this
to boaſt of, or to give them any Claim
to be Encouragers of Navigation?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0665600300:37"/>
On the other hand, the <hi>Italian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
alledge, That they hinder, by
their Limitations upon the Trade, ten
times more Ships being employ'd than all
the Trade they carry on employs. Tho'
they have all the Grand Seigniors Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
for their Trade, the others only <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi>
they employ 6 or 7 Ships a Year,
the <hi>Italian</hi> Trade near 150, to 200, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of which lie mouldring in Port, while
the <hi>French</hi> and other foreign Veſſels
(Thanks to the Company's By Laws and
Reſtrictions) run away with all the
Freights to <hi>Turky,</hi> whilſt our Ships, for
want of Employ as uſual in the <hi>Levant,</hi>
are oblig'd to return home Empty.</p>
            <p>Which Way ſhall theſe Men be diſcours'd
with? Let impartial Men but hear their
Argument: How incoherent! How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with itſelf! If they talk of our
Importation to <hi>England,</hi> 'tis exceeding
great. On the other hand, if they talk
of our Exportation from <hi>England,</hi> 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ſmall, tho' we vend and ſend 40
or 50000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth to
<hi>Turky,</hi> by Way of <hi>Leghorn,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we ſpeak of our Trade to <hi>Turky,</hi>
they tell us, one Ship a Year will bring
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0665600300:38"/>
all our Returns, and there is not above
500 Cloths a Year brought into <hi>Turky;</hi>
and yet, at the ſame Time, ſpeak of our
Returns as a Thing fatal to their Trade.
To avoid the Abſurdity of theſe Things,
they inſiſt and affirm, That the Silk we
import, is from <hi>France;</hi> offering nothing
to prove it, but their affirming poſitively,
that it is ſo; the Credit of which the
<hi>Italian</hi> Merchants deſire to be excus'd, as
to their giving any Weight to, and as
poſitively deny it.</p>
            <p>But there is a Way how the <hi>Turky</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
may obtain all that they aſk'd, and
which, if it may be obtain'd, no Cloth
will be carry'd to <hi>Turky, Viâ Leghorn,</hi> any
more; and no Raw Silk be brought from
<hi>France, Viâ Leghorn,</hi> any more; no Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
againſt the <hi>Turky</hi> Company's being
a Monopoly, will be made any more; no
Interruption to our Navigation will be
made by the Company more; but the
Trade will flouriſh, the Company will be
enrich'd, and the Nation alſo: And this
is but by <hi>laying open the Trade</hi> to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
on the foot of the <hi>Ruſſia</hi> Company,
to trade freely and unconfin'd; to ſend
out Ships when they will, and by what
Ways they will; and every body being
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0665600300:39"/>
left to puſh their own Trade, there is no
doubt but the Grand Seignior's Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the Kingdoms and Countries of
<hi>Perſia, Georgia, Armenia,</hi> and the <hi>Caſpian</hi>
Sea, might, if Encouragement was given
them, conſume much more <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth
than is now ſold among them.</p>
            <p>This, and no other, is the Way effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to encreaſe the Trade, to Ruin the
<hi>French</hi> Manufactories of Cloth, and to
encourage both the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufacture
and Navigation; and, in this Caſe, a few
Years wou'd bring the <hi>Turky</hi> Trade not to
employ ſeven Ships a Year, but ſeventy,
and perhaps, ſevenſcore Ships.</p>
            <p>For then wou'd all the Trade be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
together, and thoſe Ships that
had a Hundred, and perhaps two Hundred
Bales of Cloth on Board, wou'd run away,
take in Freight for other Places, as for
<hi>Genoa, Leghorn, Naples, Meſſina,</hi> and ſo
to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and thus,
inſtead of few Ships; there wou'd be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sail in a Year employ'd.</p>
            <p>And then the Trade wou'd appear, as it
indeed is, very conſiderable; whereas now
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0665600300:40"/>
tis contracted, 'tis limited; and indeed by
thoſe Limitations 'tis almoſt quite loſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Company is an Inſtance of
this, who, while they were under the like
Limitations as the <hi>Turky</hi> Company, ſent
uſually 6 or 7 Ships a Year to <hi>Archangel,</hi>
whereas they now employ above 120 Sail
of large Ships a Year, one Year with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and they export infinitely more
Woollen Manufactures to that Country,
than ever they did before; and thus puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Trade on with all the Art, and
with the utmoſt Diligence, they have
brought Infinite Numbers more of People
to uſe the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufacture, than ever
uſed it before.</p>
            <p>The like is before us, and the like Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
offer themſelves; for by this one
Act, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>of laying the Trade open,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
wou'd have her Hands at liberty,
to ſtruggle and to puſh the Trade into
Countries, and among Inhabitants that
were never heard of before. Methods
wou'd then be uſed by the vigilant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
to ſend his Goods, and to ſell his
Goods, without exacting ready Money
where Payment was ſure; leaving the
Factor a diſcretionary Power to act as for
himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0665600300:41"/>
As The Trade wou'd thus be better'd,
ſo the Encouragement to Shipping, the
Encreaſe of Seamen, and above all, the
Conſumption of our Manufactures wou'd
be enlarg'd, and then the Mock-Complaint
of the Importation of Raw Silk from <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi>
wou'd be at an End; neither wou'd
there be any Occaſion of a Bill to prevent
the Importation of <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Goods from
<hi>Leghorn;</hi> every Merchant having a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
in the Courſe of his own Buſineſs,
to bring away the Returns directly.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe as a far greater Number of
Ships wou'd go to <hi>Turky,</hi> having but Part
of their Loading thither, from <hi>England,</hi> and
having the Liberty, to take in Goods for
<hi>Leghorn, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Meſſina,</hi> in their
Way to <hi>Turky;</hi> ſo, in their Return, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Part of their Loading for <hi>Italy</hi> or
<hi>England,</hi> there being a conſtant Trade to
and from <hi>Turky</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> the Freight of
which is conſiderable, they will be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to take the reſt of their Loading in
<hi>Italian</hi> Goods at <hi>Meſſina, Naples,</hi> or <hi>Leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſn,</hi>
as Opportunity preſents, or as their
Employers direct. So that in this Caſe,
the End of the Act of Navigation, which,
as I ſaid before, was to encreaſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Seamen and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0665600300:42"/>
eſpecially Ships of Force, wou'd
much better be anſwer'd, than by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on a narrow contracted Trade, as
now they do, manag'd by about thirty
Merchants only; and thoſe Thirty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagd
again by Two or Three, by which
the whole Commerce is ſtraighten'd, the
Conſumption of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth hinder'd,
and the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> encourag'd to
carry Cloth to <hi>Turky,</hi> and worm us out
of the Trade.</p>
            <p>This laying open the Trade may with
Eaſe be ſo regulated, as that the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors,
Conſuls, and other Officers neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to act there, may be ſtill maintain'd,
and all the neceſſary Expences of the
Trade be ſupply'd, either by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
itſelf, or by the Publick, for which
ſuitable Proviſion may be made, as to the
Wiſdom of the Parliament ſhall ſeem meet.
And for the compleat and eaſy Direction
Whereof, a Scheme of ſuitable Meaſures
ſhall be preſented to the Houſe, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſuch a Thing ſhall come upon the
Stage; nor is there any Doubt to be made
but that the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants will be
able to anſwer all the Objections that can
be juſtly brought againſt ſuch a Change
of the Company's Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0665600300:43"/>
By the aforeſaid Caſe (which I think
I have ſtated impartially) it is humbly
hop'd that the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants, as <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen,</hi>
have a natural Right to the
Trade to the Grand Seignier's Dominions.
I ſhall only give the Heads of ſome few
reſtrictive Orders, and inſtance others,
whereby they have Tax'd our Woollen
Manufactures and Navigation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
even their own Members from
Trading in ſuch Manner and at ſuch
Times as they thought proper, and your
Lordſhips may then judge, whether a
