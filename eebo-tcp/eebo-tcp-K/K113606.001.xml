            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>NATURAL HISTORY, conſidered in its utmoſt extent, comprehends
two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Firſt, that of diſcovering, aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, and naming all
the various pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of nature. Secondly, that of deſcribing the
properties, manners, and relations, which they bear to us, and to each other.
The firſt, which is the moſt difficult part of this ſcience, is
ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tematical, dry, mechanical, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete. The ſecond is more
amuſing, exhibits new pictures to the imagination, and improves our reliſh
for exiſtence, by widening the proſpect of nature around us.</p>
            <p>Both, however, are neceſſary to thoſe who would underſtand
this pleaſing <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0823800101:3"/> ſcience, in its utmoſt extent. The
firſt care of every enquirer, no doubt ſhould be, to ſee to viſit and
examine every object, before he pretends to inſpect its habitudes or its
hiſtory. From ſeeing and obſerving the thing itſelf, he is moſt
naturally led to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate upon its uſes, its delights, or its
inconveniences.</p>
            <p>Numberleſs obſtructions, however, are found in this part of
his purſuit, that fruſtrate his diligence and retard his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity. The
objects in nature are ſo many, and even thoſe of the ſame kind are
exhibited in ſuch a variety of forms, that the enquirer finds himſelf
loſt, in the exuberance before him, and, like a man who attempts to count the
ſtars unaſſiſted by art, his powers are all diſtracted in the barren
ſuperfluity.</p>
            <p>To remedy this embarraſment, arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial ſyſtems have been
deviſed, which grouping into maſſes thoſe parts of nature more nearly
reſembling each other, refer the enquirer for the name of the ſingle 
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0823800101:4"/> object he deſires to know to ſome one of thoſe
general diſtributions, where it is to be found by further examination.</p>
            <p>If, for inſtance, a man ſhould, in his walks, meet with an
animal, the name, and conſequently the hiſtory of which, he deſires to
know, he is taught by ſyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic writers of natural hiſtory, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
its moſt obvious qualities, whether a quadrupede, a bird, a fiſh, or an
inſect. Having determined it, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation ſake, to be an inſect, he
exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines whether it has wings; if he finds it poſſeſſed of theſe, he
is taught to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether it has two or four; if poſſeſſed of four,
he is taught to obſerve, whether the two upper wings are of a ſhelly
hardneſs, and ſerve as caſes to thoſe under them; if he finds the wings
compoſed in this manner, he is then taught to pronounce, that this inſect
is one of the beetle kind: of the beetle kind, there are three different
claſſes, diſtinguiſhed from each other by their feelers; he examines
the inſect before <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0823800101:5"/> him, and finds that the feelers are
clavated or knobbed at the ends; of beetles, with feelers thus formed, there
are ten kinds; and among thoſe, he is taught to look for the preciſe name
of that which is before him. If, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the knob be divided at the
ends, and the belly be ſtreaked with white, it is no other than the Dor or
the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bug; an animal, the noxious qualities of which give it a very
diſtinguiſhed rank in the hiſtory of the inſect creation. In this
manner a ſyſtem of natural hiſtory may, in ſome meaſure, be compared
to a dictionary of words. Both are ſolely intended to explain the names of
things; but with this difference, that in the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary of words we are led
from the name of the thing to its definition; whereas in the ſyſtem of
natural hiſtory, we are led from the definition to find out the name.</p>
            <p>Such are the efforts of writers, who have compoſed their works
with great labour and ingenuity, to direct the learner in his <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0823800101:6"/> progreſs through nature, and to inform him of the name of every
animal, plant, or foſſil ſubſtance, that he happens to meet with; but
it would be only deceiving the reader, to conceal the truth, which is, that
books alone can never teach him this art in perfection; and the ſolitary
ſtudent can never ſucceed. Without a maſter, and a previous knowledge of
many of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in nature, his book will only ſerve to confound and
diſguſt him. Few of the individual plants or animals, that he may happen to
meet with, are in that preciſe ſtate of health, or that exact period of
vegetation, from whence their deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were taken. Perhaps he meets the
plant only with leaves, but the ſyſtematic writer has deſcribed it in
flower. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he meets the bird before it has moulted its firſt feathers,
while the ſyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic deſcription was made in its ſtate of full
perfection. He thus ranges with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an inſtructor, confuſed and with
ſickening curioſity from ſubject to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, till at laſt he gives
up the purſuit, <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0823800101:7"/> in the multiplicity of his
diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Some practice therefore, much inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diligent reading
are requiſite to make a ready and expert naturaliſt, who ſhall be able,
even by the help of a ſyſtem, to find out the name of every object he meets
with. But when this tedious, though requiſite part of ſtudy is attained,
nothing but delight and variety attend the reſt of his journey. Wherever he
travels, like a man in a country where he has many friends, he meets with
nothing but acquaintances and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements in all the ſtages of his way. The
meer uninformed ſpectator paſſes on in gloomy ſolitude; but the
naturaliſt, in every plant, in every inſect, and every pebble, finds
ſomething to entertain his curioſity, and excite his ſpeculation.</p>
            <p>From hence it appears, that a ſyſtem may be conſidered as a
dictionary in the ſtudy of nature. The ancients, however, who have all
written moſt delightfully on this ſubject, ſeem entirely to have rejected
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0823800101:8"/> thoſe humble and mechanical helps to ſcience. They
contented themſelves with ſeizing upon the great outlines of hiſtory, and
paſſing over what was common, as not worth the detail; they only dwelt upon
what was new, great, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, and ſometimes even warmed the
imagination at the expence of truth. Such of the moderns as revived this
ſcience in Europe undertook the taſk more methodically, though not in a
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo pleaſing. Aldrovandus, Geſner, and Johnſon, ſeemed
deſirous of uniting the entertaining and rich deſcriptions of the ancients
with the dry and ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tematic arrangement, of which they were the firſt
projectors. This attempt, however, was extremely imperfect, as the great
variety of nature was, as yet, but very inadequately known. Nevertheleſs, by
attempting to carry on both objects at once; firſt, of directing us to the
name, of the thing; and then, giving the detail of its hiſtory, they drew out
their works into a tedious and unreaſonable length; <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0823800101:9"/> and
thus mixing incompatible aims they have left their labours, rather to be
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally conſulted than read with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light by poſterity.</p>
            <p>The later moderns, with that good ſenſe which they have
carried into every other part of ſcience, have taken a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent method in
cultivating natural hiſtory. They have been content to give, not only the
brevity, but alſo the dry and diſguſting air of a dictionary to their
ſyſtems. Ray, Klin, Briſſon, and Linnaeus, have had only one aim, that
of pointing out the object in nature, of diſcovering its name, and where it
was to be found in thoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that treated of it in a more prolix and
ſatisfactory manner. Thus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural hiſtory at preſent is carried on, in
two diſtinct and ſeparate channels, the one ſerving to lead us to the
thing, the other conveying the hiſtory of the thing, as ſuppoſing it
already known.</p>
            <p>The following Natural Hiſtory is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, with only ſuch an
attention to ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem as ſerves to remove the reader's
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſments, <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0823800101:10"/> and allure him to proceed. It can
make no pretenſions in directing him to the name of every object he meets
with; that belongs to works of a very different kind, and written with very
different aims. It will fully anſwer my deſign, if the reader, being
already poſſeſt of the name of any animal, ſhall find here a ſhort,
though ſatisfactory hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of its habitudes, its ſubſiſtence, its
manners, its friendſhips and hoſtilities. My aim has been to carry on
juſt as much method, as was ſufficient to ſhorten my deſcriptions by
generalizing them, and never to follow order where the art of writing, which is
but another name for good ſenſe, informed me that it would only contribute
to the reader's embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Still, however, the reader will perceive, that I have formed a
kind of ſyſtem in the hiſtory of every part of animated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
directing myſelf by the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious diſtinctions that ſhe herſelf
ſeems to have made, which, though too few to <pb n="x" facs="tcp:0823800101:11"/> point
exactly to the name, are yet ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to illuminate the ſubject, and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the reader's perplexity. Mr. Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon, indeed, who has brought greater
talents to this part of learning than any other man, has almoſt entirely
reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed method in claſſing quadrupedes. This, with great deference to
ſuch a character, appears to me running into the oppoſite extreme; and, as
ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns have of late ſpent much time, great pains, and ſome
learning, all to very little purpoſe, in ſyſtematic ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, he
ſeems ſo much diſguſted by their trifling, but oſtentatious efforts,
that he deſcribes his animals, almoſt in the order they happen to come
before him. This want of method ſeems to be a fault; but he can loſe little
by a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm which every dull man can make, or by an error in arrangement,
from which the dulleſt are the moſt uſually free.</p>
            <p>In other reſpects, as far as this able philoſopher has gone, I
have taken <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0823800101:12"/> him for my guide. The warmth of his ſtyle,
and the brilliancy of his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are inimitable. Leaving him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without a rival in theſe, and only availing myſelf of his information, I
have been content to deſcribe things in my own way; and though many of the
materials are taken from him, yet I have added, retrenched, and altered, as I
thought proper. It was my intention at one time, whenever I differed from him,
to have mentioned it at the bottom of the page; but this occured ſo often,
that I ſoon found it would look like envy, and might perhaps, convict me of
thoſe very errors which I was wanting to lay upon him. I have therefore, as
being every way his debtor, concealed my diſſent, where my opinion was
different; but wherever I borrow from him, I take care at the bottom of the
page to expreſs my obligations. But though my obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to this writer are
many, they extend but to the ſmalleſt part of the work, as he has hitherto
compleated only the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0823800101:13"/> of quadrupedes. I was
therefore left to my own reading alone, to make out the hiſtory of birds,
fiſhes and inſects, of which the arrangement was ſo difficult, and the
neceſſary information ſo widely diffuſed and ſo obſcurely related
when found, that it proved by much the moſt laborious part of the
undertaking. Thus having made uſe of Mr. Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon's lights in the firſt part
of the work, I may, with ſome ſhare of confidence, recommend it to the
public. But what ſhall I ſay to that part, where I have been entirely left
without his aſſiſtance? As I would affect neither modeſty nor
confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it will be ſufficient to ſay, that my reading upon this part
of the ſubject has been very extenſive; and that I have taxed my ſcanty
circumſtances in procuring books which are on this ſubject, of all others,
the moſt expenſive. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this induſtry, I here offer a
work to the public, of a kind, which has never been attempted in ours, or any
other modern language, that I know <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0823800101:14"/> of. The ancients,
indeed, and Pliny in particular, have anticipated me, in the preſent manner
of treating natural hiſtory. Like thoſe hiſtorians who deſcribe the
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of a campaign, they have not conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to give the private
particulars of every individual that formed the army; they were content with
characterizing the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and deſcribing their operations, while they
left it to meaner hands to carry the muſter-roll. I have followed their
manner, rejecting the numerous fables which they adopted, and adding the
improvements of the moderns, which are ſo numerous, that they actually make
up the bulk of natural hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The delight which I found in reading Pliny, firſt inſpired me
with the idea of a work of this nature. Having a taſte rather claſſical
than ſcientific, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but little employed myſelf in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over
the dry labours of modern ſyſtem-makers, my earlieſt intention was to
tranſlate this agreeable writer, and by the help of a commentary to make 
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0823800101:15"/> my work as amuſing as I could. Let us dignify natural
hiſtory never ſo much with the grave appellation of a uſeful ſcience,
yet ſtill we muſt confeſs that it is the occupation of the idle and the
ſpeculative, more than of the buſy and the ambitious part of mankind. My
inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore was to treat what I then conceived to be an idle
ſubject, in an idle manner; and not to hedge round plain and ſimple
narratives with hard words, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated diſtinctions, oſtentatious
learning, and diſquiſitions that produced no convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Upon the
appearance however of Mr. Buffon's work, I dropped my former plan, and adopted
the preſent, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by his manner, that the beſt imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
the ancients was to write from our own feelings, and to imitate nature.</p>
            <p>It will be my chief pride therefore, if this work may be found an
innocent amuſement for thoſe who have nothing elſe to employ them, or who
require a relaxation from labour. Profeſſed natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts will, no doubt,
find it ſuperficial; <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0823800101:16"/> and yet I ſhould hope that even
theſe will diſcover hints, and remarks, gleaned from various reading, not
wholly trite or elementary. I would wiſh for their approbation. But my chief
ambition is to drag up the obſcure and gloomy learning of the cell to open
inſpection; to ſtrip it from its garb of auſterity, and to ſhew the
beauties of that form, which only the induſtrious and the inquiſitive have
been hitherto permitted to approach.</p>

         <div n="1" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. I. A Sketch of the Univerſe.</head>
            <p>THE world may be conſidered as one vaſt manſion, where man has
been admitted to enjoy, to admire, and to be grateful. The firſt deſires of
ſavage nature are merely to gratify the importunities of ſenſual
appetite, and to neglect the contemplation of things, barely ſatisfied with
their enjoyment: the beauties of nature, and all the wonders of creation, have
but little charms for a being taken up in obviat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wants of the day, and
anxious for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0823800101:20"/>Our philoſophers, therefore, who have
teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſuch ſurprize at the want of curioſity in the ignorant,
ſeem not to conſider that they are uſually employed in making
proviſions of a more important nature; in providing rather for the
neceſſities than the amuſements of life. It is not till our more
preſſing wants are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſupplied, that we can attend to the
calls of curioſity; ſo that in every age ſcientific refinement has been
the lateſt effort of human induſtry.</p>
            <p>But human curioſity, though, at firſt, ſlowly excited, being
at laſt poſſeſſed of leiſure for indulging its propenſity,
becomes one of the greateſt amuſements of life, and gives higher
ſatisfactions than what even the ſenſes can afford. A man of this
diſpoſition turns all nature into a magnificent theatre, replete with
objects of wonder and ſurprize, and fitted up chiefly for his happineſs and
entertainment: he induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly examines all things, from the minuteſt
inſect to the moſt finiſhed animal; and, when his limited organs can no
longer make the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, he ſends out his imagination upon new
enquiries.</p>
            <p>Nothing, therefore, can be more auguſt and ſtriking than the
idea which his reaſon, aided by his imagination, furniſhes of the
univerſe <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0823800101:21"/> around him. Aſtronomers tell us, that this
earth which we inhabit forms but a very minute part in that great
aſſemblage of bodies of which the world is compoſed. It is a million of
times leſs than the ſun, by which it is enlightened. The planets alſo,
which, like it, are ſubordinate to the ſun's influence, exceed the earth
one thouſand times in magnitude. Theſe, which were at firſt ſuppoſed
to wander in the heavens without any fixed path, and that took their name from
their apparent deviations, have long been found to perform their circuits with
great exactneſs and ſtrict regularity. They have been diſcovered as
forming with our earth a ſyſtem of bodies circulating round the ſun, all
obedient to one law, and impelled by one common influence.</p>
            <p>Modern philoſophy has taught us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that, when the great
Author of nature began the work of creation, he choſe to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by ſecond
cauſes; and, that, ſuſpending the conſtant exertion of his power, he
endued matter with a quality by which the univerſal oeconomy of nature might
be continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his immediate aſſiſtance. This quality is called
<hi>attraction</hi>; a ſort of approximating influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which all bodies,
whether terreſtrial or celeſtial, are found to poſſeſs; and which in
all <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0823800101:22"/> encreaſes as the quantity of matter in each
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes. The ſun, by far the greateſt body in our ſyſtem, is, of
conſequence, poſſeſt of much the greateſt ſhare of this attracting
power; and all the planets, of which our earth is one, are, of courſe,
entirely ſubject to its ſuperior influence. Were this power, therefore,
left uncontrolled by any other, the ſun muſt quickly have attracted all the
bodies of our celeſtial ſyſtem to itſelf; but it is equably
counteracted by another power of equal efficacy; namely, a progreſſive
force which each planet received when it was impelled forward, by the divine
architect, upon its firſt formation. The heavenly bodies of our ſyſtem
being thus acted upon by two oppoſing powers; namely, by that of
<hi>attraction,</hi> which draws them towards the ſun; and that of
<hi>impulſion,</hi> which drives them ſtrait forward into the great void of
ſpace; they purſue a track between theſe contrary direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and each,
like a ſtone whirled about in a ſling, obeying two oppoſite forces,
circulates round its great centre of heat and motion.</p>
            <p>In this manner, therefore, is the harmony of our planetary
ſyſtem preſerved. The ſun, in the midſt, gives heat, and light, and
circular motion to the planets which ſurround it: Mercury, Venus, the Earth,
Mars, Jupiter, <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0823800101:23"/> and Saturn, perform their conſtant
circuits at different diſtances, each taking up a time to compleat its
revolutions proportioned to the greatneſs of the circle which it is to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. The leſſer planets alſo, which are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants upon ſome
of the greater, are ſubject to the ſame laws; they circulate with the
ſame exactneſs; and are, in the ſame manner, influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by their
reſpective centres of motion.</p>
            <p>Beſides thoſe bodies which make a part of our peculiar
ſyſtem, and which may be ſaid to reſide within its great circumference;
there are others, that frequently come among us, from the moſt diſtant
tracts of ſpace, and that ſeem like dangerous intruders upon the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
ſimplicity of nature. Theſe are comets, whoſe appearance was once ſo
terrible to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the theory of which is ſo little underſtood at
preſent: all we know, is, that their number is much greater than that of the
planets; and that, like theſe, they roll in orbits, in ſome meaſure,
obedient to Solar influence. Aſtronomers have endeavoured to calculate the
returning periods of many of them; but expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has not, as yet, confirmed
the veracity of their inveſtigations: indeed, who can tell when thoſe
wanderers have made their excurſions into other worlds and diſtant
ſyſtems, what <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0823800101:24"/> obſtacles may be found to oppoſe
their progreſs, to accelerate their motions, or retard their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn?</p>
            <p>But what we have hitherto attempted to ſketch, is but a ſmall
part of that great fabric in which the Deity has thought proper to manifeſt
his wiſdom and omnipotence. There are multitudes of other bodies diſperſt
over the face of the heavens that lie too remote for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination: theſe have
no motion, ſuch as the planets are found to poſſeſs, and are,
therefore, called fixed ſtars; and from their extreme brilliancy and their
immenſe diſtance, philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have been induced to ſuppoſe them to
be ſuns reſembling that which enlivens our ſyſtem: as the imagination
alſo, once exited, is ſeldom content to ſtop, it has furniſhed each
with an attendant ſyſtem of planets belonging to itſelf, and has even
induced ſome to deplore the fate of thoſe ſyſtems, whoſe imagined
ſuns, which ſometimes happens, have become no longer viſible.</p>
            <p>But conjectures of this kind, which no reaſoning can aſcertain,
nor experiment reach, are rather amuſing than uſeful. Though we ſee the
greatneſs and wiſdom of the Deity in all the ſeeming worlds that
ſurround us, it is our chief concern to trace him in that which 
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0823800101:25"/> we inhabit. The examination of the earth, the wonders of
its contrivance, the hiſtory of its advantages, or of the ſeeming defects
in its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, are the proper buſineſs of the <hi>natural
hiſtorian.</hi> A deſcription of this earth, its <hi>animals,
vegetables,</hi> and <hi>minerals,</hi> is the moſt delightful entertainment
the mind can be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with, as it is the moſt intereſting and
uſeful. I would beg leave, therefore, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude theſe common-place
ſpeculations, with an obſervation, which, I hope, is not entirely ſo.</p>
            <p>An uſe, hitherto not much inſiſted upon, that may reſult
from the contemplation of celeſtial magnificence, is, that it will teach us
to make an allowance for the apparent irregularities we find below. Whenever we
can examine the works of the Deity at a proper point of diſtance, ſo as to
take in the whole of his deſign, we ſee nothing but uniformity, beauty, and
preciſion. The heavens preſent us with a plan, which, though
inexpreſſibly magnificent, is yet regular beyond the power of invention.
Whenever, therefore, we find any apparent defects in the earth, which we are
about to conſider, inſtead of attempting to reaſon ourſelves into an
opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they are beautiful, it will be wiſer to ſay, that we do not
behold them at the proper <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0823800101:26"/> point of diſtance, and that our
eye is laid too cloſe to the objects to take in the regularity of their
connexion. In ſhort, we may conclude, that God, who is regular in his great
produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, acts with equal uniformity in the little.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. A ſhort Survey of the Globe, from the Light of
Aſtronomy and Geography.</head>
            <p>ALL the ſciences are in ſome meaſure linked with each other,
and before the one is ended the other begins. In a natural hiſtory,
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of the earth, we muſt begin with a ſhort account of its
ſituation and form, as given us by aſtronomers and geographers: it will be
ſufficient, however, upon this occaſion, juſt to hint to the imagination,
what they, by the moſt abſtract reaſonings, have forced upon the
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. The earth which we inhabit is, as has been ſaid before, one
of thoſe bodies which circulate in our ſolar ſyſtem; it is placed at an
happy middle diſtance from the centre; and even ſeems, in this reſpect,
privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged beyond all other planets that depend upon our great luminary for
their ſupport. Leſs diſtant from the ſun than Saturn, Jupiter, 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0823800101:27"/> and Mars, and yet leſs parched up than Venus and Mercury,
that are ſituate too near the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of its power, the earth ſeems in a
peculiar manner to ſhare the bounty of the Creator: it is not, therefore,
without reaſon that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind conſider themſelves as the peculiar objects
of his providence and regard.</p>
            <p>Beſides that motion which the earth has round the ſun, the
circuit of which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a year, it has another upon its own axle,
which it performs in twenty-four hours. Thus, like a chariot-wheel, it has a
compound motion; for while it goes forward on its journey, it is all the while
turning upon itſelf. From the firſt of theſe two ariſe the grateful
viciſſitude of the ſeaſons; from the ſecond, that of day and
night.</p>
            <p>It may be alſo readily conceived, that a body thus wheeling in
circles will moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be itſelf a ſphere. The earth, beyond all
poſſibility of doubt, is found to be ſo. Whenever its ſhadow happens to
fall upon the moon, in an eclipſe, it appears to be always circular, in
whatever poſition it is projected: and it is eaſy to prove, that a body
which in every poſition makes a circular ſhadow, muſt itſelf be round.
The rotundity of the earth may be alſo proved from the meeting of two ſhips
at ſea: the top <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0823800101:28"/> maſts of each are the firſt parts
that are diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by both, the under parts being hidden by the convexity
of the globe which riſes between them. The ſhips in this inſtance may be
reſembled to two men who approach each other on the oppoſite ſides of an
hill: their heads will firſt be ſeen, and gradually as they come nearer
they will come entirely into view.</p>
            <p>However, though the earth's figure is ſaid to be ſpherical, we
ought only to conceive it as being nearly ſo. It has been found in the laſt
age to be rather flatted at both poles, ſo that its form is commonly
reſembled to that of a turnep. The cauſe of this ſwelling of the equator
is aſcribed to the greater rapidity of the motion with which the parts of the
earth are there carried round; and which, conſequently, endeavouring to fly
off, act in oppoſition to central attraction. The twirling of a mop may
ſerve as an homely illuſtration; which, as every one has ſeen, ſpreads
and grows broader in the middle as it continues to be turned round.</p>
            <p>As the earth receives light and motion from the ſun, ſo it
derives much of its warmth and power of vegetation from the ſame beneficent
ſource. However, the different parts of the globe participate of theſe
advantages in very <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0823800101:29"/> different proportions, and accordingly
put on very different appearances; a polar proſpect, and a landſcape at the
equator, are as oppoſite in their appearances as in their ſituation.</p>
            <p>The polar regions, that receive the ſolar beams in a very oblique
direction, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for one half of the year in night, receive but
few of the genial comforts that other parts of the world enjoy. Nothing can be
more mournful or hideous than the picture which travellers preſent of thoſe
wretched regions. The ground<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Crantz's hiſtory
of Greenland, p. 3.</bibl>
               </note>, which is rocky and barren, rears itſelf in
every place in lofty mountains and inacceſſible cliffs, and meets the
mariner's eye at even forty leagues from ſhore. Theſe precipices, frightful
in themſelves, receive an additional horror from being conſtantly covered
with ice and ſnow, which daily ſeem to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulate and to fill all the
vallies with encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſolation. The few rocks and cliffs, that are
bare of ſnow, look at a diſtance of a dark brown colour, and quite naked.
Upon a nearer approach, however, they are found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with many different
veins of coloured ſtone, and here and there ſpread over with a little
earth, and a ſcanty portion of graſs and heath. The internal parts of the
country are <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0823800101:30"/> ſtill more deſolate and deterring. In
wandering this ſolitude, ſome plains appear covered with ice, that, at
firſt glance, ſeem to promiſe the traveller an eaſy journey<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Crantz's hiſtory of Greenland, p. 22.</bibl>
               </note>, But
theſe are even more formidable and more unpaſſable than the mountains
themſelves, being cleft with dreadful chaſms, and every where abounding
with pits that threaten certain deſtruction. The ſeas that ſurround
theſe inhoſpitable coaſts, are ſtill more aſtoniſhing, being
covered with flakes of floating ice, that ſpread like extenſive fields, or
that riſe out of the water like enormous mountains. Theſe, which are
compoſed of materials as clear and tranſparent as glaſs<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ibid. 27.</bibl>
               </note>, aſſume many ſtrange and
phantaſtic appearances. Some of them look like churches or caſtles, with
pointed turrets; ſome like ſhips in full ſail; and people have often
given themſelves the fruitleſs toil to attempt piloting the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
veſſels into harbour. There are ſtill others that appear like large
iſlands, with plains, valleys, and hills, which often rear their heads two
hundred yards above the level of the ſea; and although the height of theſe
be amazing, yet their depth beneath is ſtill more ſo; ſome of them being
found to ſink three hundred fathom under water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0823800101:31"/>The earth preſents a very different
appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at the equator, where the ſun-beams, darting directly downwards,
burn up the lighter ſoils into extenſive ſandy deſarts, or quicken all
the moiſter tracts with incredible vegetation. In theſe regions, almoſt
all the ſame inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies are felt from the proximity of the ſun, that
in the former were endured from its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The deſarts are entirely
barren except where they are found to produce ſerpents, and that in ſuch
quantities, that ſome extenſive plains ſeem almoſt entirely covered
with them<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>.</p>
            <p>It not unfrequently happens alſo that this dry ſoil, which is
ſo parched and comminuted by the force of the ſun, riſes with the
ſmalleſt breeze of wind; and the ſands being compoſed of parts almoſt
as ſmall as thoſe of water, they aſſume a ſimilar appearance, rolling
onward in waves like thoſe of a troubled ſea, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming all they
meet with inevitable deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. On the other hand, thoſe tracts which
are fertile, teem with vegetation even to a noxious degree. The graſs riſes
to ſuch an height as often to require burning; the foreſts are
impaſſable from underwoods, and ſo matted above, that even the ſun,
fierce as it is, can ſeldom penetrate<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Linnaei Amaenit. vol. vi. p. 67.</bibl>
               </note>. Theſe are
ſo thick as <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0823800101:32"/> ſcarce to be extirpated; for the tops
being ſo bound together by the climbing plants that grow round them, though
an hundred ſhould be cut at the bottom, yet not one would fall, as they
mutually ſupport each other. In theſe dark and tangled foreſts, beaſts
of various kinds, inſects in aſtoniſhing abundance, and ſerpents of
ſurprizing magnitude, find a quiet retreat from man, and are ſeldom
diſturbed except by each other.</p>
            <p>In this manner the extremes of our globe ſeem equally unfitted for
the comforts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of life; and, although the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may
find an awful pleaſure in contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the frightful precipices of
Greenland, or the luxurious verdure of Africa, yet true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can only
be found in the more moderate climates, where the gifts of nature may be
enjoyed without incurring danger in obtaining them.</p>
            <p>It is in the temperate zone, therefore, that all the arts of
improving nature, and refining upon happineſs, have been invented: and this
part of the earth is, more properly ſpeaking, the theatre of natural
hiſtory. Although there be millions of animals and vegetables in the
unexplored foreſts under the line, yet moſt of theſe may for ever
continue unknown, as <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0823800101:33"/> curioſity is there repreſſed by
ſurrounding danger. But it is otherwiſe in theſe delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful regions
which we inhabit, and where this art has had its beginning. Among us there is
ſcarce a ſhrub, a flower, or an inſect, without its particular hiſtory;
ſcarce a plant that could be uſeful that has not been propagated; nor a
weed that could be noxious which has not been pointed out.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. A View of the Surface of the Earth.</head>
            <p>WHEN we take a ſlight ſurvey of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of our globe, a
thouſand objects offer themſelves, which, though long known, yet ſtill
demand our curioſity. The moſt obvious beauty that every where ſtrikes
the eye is the verdant covering of the earth, which is formed by an happy
mixture of herbs and trees of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious magnitudes and uſes. It has been often
remarked that no colour refreſhes the ſight ſo well as green; and it may
be added, as a further proof of the aſſertion, that the inhabitants of
thoſe places where the fields are continually white with ſnow, generally
become blind long before the uſual courſe of nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0823800101:34"/>This advantage, which ariſes from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
of the fields, is not a little improved by their agreeable inequalities. There
is ſcarce two natural landſcapes that offer proſpects en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
reſembling each other; their riſings and depreſſions, their hills and
valleys, are never entirely the ſame, but always offer ſomething new to
entertain and refreſh the imagination.</p>
            <p>But to encreaſe the beauties of the face of nature, the
landſcape is enlivened by ſprings and lakes, and interſected by rivulets.
Theſe lend a brightneſs to the proſpect; give motion and coolneſs to
the air; and, what is much more important, furniſh health and
ſubſiſtence to animated nature.</p>
            <p>Such are the moſt obvious and tranquil objects that every where
offer: but there are others of a more awful and magnificent kind; the
<hi>Mountain</hi> riſing above the clouds, and topt with ſnow; the
<hi>River</hi> pouring down its ſides, encreaſing as it runs, and loſing
itſelf, at laſt, in the ocean; the <hi>Ocean</hi> ſpreading its immenſe
ſheet of waters over one half of the globe, ſwelling and ſubſiding at
well-known intervals, and forming a communication between the moſt diſtant
parts of the earth.</p>
            <p>If we leave thoſe objects that ſeem to be natural to our earth,
and keep the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0823800101:35"/> tenor, we are preſented
with the great irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities of nature. The burning mountain; the abrupt
precipice; the unfathomable cavern; the headlong cataract; and the rapid
whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool.</p>
            <p>If we carry our curioſity a little further, and deſcend to the
objects immediately below the ſurface of the globe, we ſhall there find
wonders ſtill as amazing. We firſt perceive the earth for the moſt part
lying in regular beds or layers, every bed growing thicker in proportion as it
lies deeper, and its contents more compact and heavy. We ſhall find, almoſt
wherever we make our ſubterranean en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, an amazing number of ſhells
that once belonged to aquatic animals. Here and there, at a diſtance from the
ſea, beds of oyſter-ſhells, ſeveral yards thick, and many miles over;
ſometimes teſtaceous ſubſtances of various kinds on the tops of
mountains, and often in the heart of the hardeſt marble. Theſe, which are
dug up by the peaſants, in every country, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded with little
curioſity; for being ſo very common, they are conſidered as
ſubſtances entirely terrene. But it is otherwiſe with the enquirer after
nature, who finds them, not only in ſhape but in ſubſtance, every way
reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thoſe that are bred in the ſea; and he, <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0823800101:36"/>
therefore, is at a loſs to account for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval.</p>
            <p>Yet not one part of nature alone, but all her productions and
varieties, become the object of the ſpeculative man's enquiry: he takes
different views of nature from the inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive ſpectator; and ſcarce an
appearance, how common ſoever, but affords matter for his contemplation: he
enquires how and why the ſurface of the earth has come to have thoſe
riſings and depreſſions which moſt men call natural; he demands in what
manner the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were formed, and in what conſiſt their uſes; he
aſks from whence ſprings ariſe; and how rivers flow round the convexity
of the globe; he enters into an examination of the ebbings and flowings, and
the other wonders of the deep; he acquaints himſelf with the irregularities
of nature, and he will endeavour to inveſtigate their cauſes; by which, at
leaſt, he will become better verſed in their hiſtory. The internal
ſtructure of the globe becomes an object of his curioſity; and, although
his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries can fathom but a very little way, yet, if poſſeſt with a
ſpirit of theory, his imagination will ſupply the reſt. He will endeavour
to account for the ſituation of the marine foſſils that are found in the
earth, and for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0823800101:37"/> of the different beds of
which it is compoſed. Theſe have been the enquiries that have ſplendidly
employed many of the philoſophers of the laſt and preſent age<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, Woodward, Burnet, Whiſton, Kircher, Bourquat,
Leibnitz, Steno, Ray, &amp;c.</bibl>
               </note>; and, to a certain degree, they
muſt be ſerviceable. But the worſt of it is, that, as ſpeculations
amuſe the writer more than facts, they may be often carried to an extravagant
length; and that time may be ſpent in reaſoning upon nature, which might be
more uſefully employed in writing her hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Too much ſpeculation in natural hiſtory is certainly wrong; but
there is a defect of an oppoſite nature that does much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice;
namely, that of ſilencing all enquiry, by alledging the benefits we receive
from a thing, inſtead of inveſtigating the cauſe of its production. If I
enquire how a mountain came to be made, ſuch a reaſoner, enumerating its
benefits, anſwers, becauſe God knew it would be uſeful. If I demand the
cauſe of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, he finds ſome good produced by it, and alledges
that as the cauſe of its exploſion. Thus ſuch an enquirer has
conſtantly ſome ready reaſon for every appearance in nature, which
ſerves to ſwell his periods, and give ſplendour <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0823800101:38"/> to
his declamation: every thing about him is, on ſome account or other, declared
to be good; and he thinks it preſumption to ſcrutinize into its defects, or
to endeavour to imagine how it might be better. Such writers, and there are
many ſuch, add very little to the advancement of knowledge; and it is finely
remarked by Bacon, that the inveſtigation of final cauſes<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                  <q rend="inline">Inveſtigatio cauſarum finalium ſterilis
eſt, et veluti virgo Deo dedicata, nil parit.</q>
               </note> is a barren ſtudy;
and, like a virgin dedicated to the Deity, brings forth nothing. In fact,
thoſe men who want to compel every appearance and every irregularity in
nature into our ſervice, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate on their benefits, combat that very
morality which they would ſeem to promote. God has permitted thouſands of
natural evils to exiſt in the world, becauſe it is by their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
that man is capable of moral evil; and he has permitted that we ſhould be
ſubject to moral evil, that we might do ſomething to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve eternal
happineſs by ſhewing that we had rectitude to avoid it.</p>

and they ſend out immagination to deſcribe it in its primaeval ſtate of

            <p>Of thoſe who have written theories deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner of the
original formation of the <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0823800101:40"/> earth, or accounting for its
preſent appearances, the moſt celebrated are Burnet, Whiſton, Woodward,
and Buffon. As ſpeculation is endleſs, ſo it is not to be wondered that
all theſe differ from each other, and give oppoſite accounts of the
ſeveral changes, which they ſuppoſe our earth to have undergone. As the
ſyſtems of each have had their admirers, it is, in ſome meaſure,
incumbent upon the natural hiſtorian to be acquainted, at leaſt, with their
out-lines; and, indeed, to know what others have even dreamed, in matters of
ſcience, is very uſeful, as it may often prevent us from indulging
ſimilar deluſions ourſelves, which we ſhould never have adopted, but
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we take them to be wholly our own. However, as entering into a
detail of theſe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories, is rather furniſhing an hiſtory of opinions
than things, I will endeavour to be as conciſe as I can.</p>
            <p>The firſt who formed this amuſement of earth-making into
ſyſtem was the celebrated Thomas Burnet, a man of polite learning and rapid
immagination. His <hi>Sacred Theory,</hi> as he calls it, deſcribing the
changes which the earth has undergone, or ſhall hereafter under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, is well
known for the warmth with which it is immagined, and the weakneſs with which
it <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0823800101:41"/> is reaſoned, for the elegance of its ſtyle, and the
meanneſs of its philoſophy. The earth, ſays he, before the deluge, was
very differently formed from what it is at preſent: it was at firſt a fluid
maſs; a chaos compoſed of various ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, differing both in
denſity and figure: thoſe which were moſt heavy ſunk to the center, and
formed in the middle of our globe an hard ſolid body; thoſe of a lighter
nature remained next; and the waters, which were lighter ſtill, ſwam upon
its ſurface, and covered the earth on every ſide. The air, and all thoſe
fluids which were lighter than water, floated upon this alſo; and in the
ſame manner encompaſſed the globe; ſo that between the ſurrounding
body of waters, and the circumambient air, there was formed a coat of oil, and
other unctuous ſubſtances, lighter than water. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as the air was
ſtill extremely impure, and muſt have carried up with it many of thoſe
earthly particles with which it once was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately blended, it ſoon began
to defecate, and to depoſe theſe particles upon the only ſurface already
mentioned, which ſoon uniting together, the earth and oil formed that
cruſt, which ſoon became an habitable ſurface, giving life to vegetation,
and dwelling to animals.</p>
            <p>This immaginary antideluvian abode was <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0823800101:42"/> very
different from what we ſee it at preſent. The earth was light and rich; and
formed of a ſubſtance entirely adapted to the feeble ſtate of incipient
vegetation: it was an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form plain, every where covered with verdure; without
mountains, without ſeas, or the ſmalleſt inequalities. It had no
difference of ſeaſons, for its equator was in the plain of the ecliptic,
or, in other words, it turned directly oppoſite to the ſun, ſo that it
enjoyed one perpetual and luxuriant ſpring. However, this delightful face of
nature did not long continue the ſame, for, after a time, it began to crack
and open in fiſſures; a circumſtance which always ſucceeds when the
ſun dries away the moiſture from rich or marſhy ſituations. The crimes
of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had been for ſome time preparing to draw down the wrath of
Heaven; and they, at length, induced the Deity to defer repairing theſe
breaches in nature. Thus the chaſms of the earth every day became wider, and,
at length, they penetrated to the great abyſs of waters; and the whole earth,
in a manner, fell in. Then enſued a total diſorder in the uniform beauty of
the firſt creation, the terrene ſurface of the globe being broken down: as
it ſunk the waters guſhed out into its place; the deluge became
univerſal; all mankind except eight perſons <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0823800101:43"/> were
puniſhed with deſtruction, and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity condemned to toil upon
the ruins of deſolated nature.</p>
            <p>It only remains to mention the manner in which he relieves the earth
from this univerſal wreck, which would ſeem to be as difficult as even its
firſt formation. 
<q rend="inline">"Theſe great maſſes of earth falling into the
abyſs, drew down with them vaſt quantities alſo of air; and by daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt each other, and breaking into ſmall parts by the repeated violence
of the ſhock, they, at length, left between them large cavities filled with
nothing but air. Theſe cavities, naturally offered a bed to receive the
influent waters; and in proportion as they filled, the face of the earth became
once more viſible. The higher parts of its broken ſurface, now become the
tops of mountains, were the firſt that appeared; the plains ſoon after came
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and, at length, the whole globe was delivered from the waters, except
the places in the loweſt ſituations; ſo that the ocean and the ſeas are
ſtill a part of the ancient abyſs that have not had a place to return.
Iſlands and rocks are fragments of the earth's former cruſt; kingdoms and
continents are larger maſſes of its broken ſubſtance; and all the
inequalities that are to be found on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the preſent earth, are
owing to the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0823800101:44"/> confuſion into which both earth
and waters were then thrown.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next theoriſt was Woodward, who, in his Eſſay towards a
Natural Hiſtory of the Earth, which was only deſigned to precede a greater
work, has endeavoured to give a more rational account of its appearances; and
was, in fact, much better furniſhed for ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking than any of
his predeceſſors, being one of the moſt aſſiduous naturaliſts of
his time. His little book, therefore, contains many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant facts, relative
to natural hiſtory, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his ſyſtem may be weak and
groundleſs.</p>
            <p>He begins by aſſerting that all terrene ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are
diſpoſed in beds of various natures, lying horizontally one over the other,
ſomewhat like the coats of an onion; that they are replete with ſhells, and
other productions of the ſea: theſe ſhells being found in the deepeſt
cavities, and on the tops of the higheſt mountains. From theſe
obſervations, which are warranted by experience, he proceeds to obſerve,
that theſe ſhells and extraneous foſſils are not produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the
earth, but are all actual remains of thoſe animals which they are known to
reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that all the beds of the earth lie under each other, in the order
of their ſpecific gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; and that they are diſpoſed as if they had
been left there by ſubſiding waters. All theſe <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0823800101:45"/>
aſſertions he affirms with much earneſtneſs, although daily experience
contradicts him in ſome of them; particularly we find layers of ſtone often
over the lighteſt ſoils, and the ſofteſt earth under the hardeſt
bodies. However, having taken it for granted, that all the layers of the earth
are found in the order of their ſpecific gravity, the lighteſt at the top,
and the heavieſt next the centre, he conſecquently aſſerts, and it will
not improbably follow, that all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of which the earth is
compoſed, were once in an actual ſtate of diſſolution. This univerſal
diſſolution he takes to have happened at the time of the flood. He
ſuppoſes that at that time a body of water, which was then in the center of
the earth, uniting with that which was found on the ſurface, ſo far
ſeparated the terrene parts as to mix all together in one fluid maſs; the
contents of which afterwards ſinking according to their reſpective
gravities, produced the preſent appearances of the earth. Being aware,
however, of an objection that foſſile ſubſtances are not found
diſſolved, he exempts them from this univerſal diſſolution, and, for
that purpoſe, endeavours to ſhew that the parts of animals have a
ſtronger coheſion than thoſe of minerals; and that, while even the
hardeſt rocks may be diſſolved, bones and ſhells may ſtill continue
entire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0823800101:46"/>So much for Wooodward; but of all the
ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems which were publiſhed reſpecting the earth's formation, that of
Whiſton was moſt applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and moſt oppoſed. Nor need we wonder; for
being ſupported with all the parade of deep calculation, it awed the
ignorant, and produced the approbation of ſuch as would be thought
otherwiſe, as it implied a knowledge of abſtruſe learning, to be even
thought capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending what the writer aimed at. In fact, it is not
eaſy to diveſt it of its mathematical garb; but thoſe who have had
leiſure, have found the reſult of our philoſopher's reaſoning to be
thus. He ſuppoſes the earth to have been originally a comet; and he
conſiders the hiſtory of the creation, as given us in ſcripture, to have
its commencement juſt when it was taken by the hand of the Creator, to be
more regularly placed as a planet in our ſolar ſyſtem. Before that time,
he ſuppoſes it to have been a globe without beauty or proportion; a world
in diſoſder; ſubject to all the viciſſitudes which comets endure;
ſome of which have been found, at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times, a thouſand times hotter
than melted iron; at others, a thouſand times colder than ice. Theſe
alternations of heat and cold, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually melting and freezing the ſurface
of the earth, he ſuppoſes to have produced, to a certain 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0823800101:47"/> depth, a chaos entirely reſembling that deſcribed by
the poets, ſurrounding the ſolid contents of the earth, which ſtill
continued unchanged in the midſt, making a great burning globe of more than
two thouſand leagues in diameter. This ſurrounding chaos, however, was far
from being ſolid: he reſembles it to a denſe though fluid atmoſphere,
compoſed of ſubſtances mingled, agitated, and ſhocked againſt each
other; and in this diſorder he deſcribes the earth to have been juſt at
the eve of creation.</p>
            <p>But upon its orbit's being then changed, when it was more regularly
wheeled round the ſun, every thing took its proper places; every part of the
ſurrounding fluid then fell into a ſituation, in proportion as it was light
or heavy. The middle, or central part, which always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unchanged,
ſtill continued ſo, retaining a part of that heat which it received in its
primaeval approaches towards the ſun; which heat, he calculates, may continue
for about ſix thouſand years. Next to this fell the heavier parts of the
chaotic atmoſphere, which ſerve to ſuſtain the lighter: but as in
deſcending they could not entirely be ſeparated from many watery parts,
with which they were intimately mixed, they drew down a part of theſe alſo
with them; and theſe could not mount again after the <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0823800101:48"/>
ſurface of the earth was conſolidated: they, therefore, ſurrounded the
heavy firſt deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts, in the ſame manner as theſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
the central globe. Thus the entire body of the earth is compoſed moſt
internally of a great burning globe: next which, is placed an heavy terrene
ſubſtance, that encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes it; round which alſo is circumfuſed a
body of water. Upon this body of waters, the cruſt of earth on which we
inhabit is placed: ſo that, according to him, the globe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of a
number of coats, or ſhells, one within the other, all of different
denſities. The body of the earth being thus formed, the air, which is the
lighteſt ſubſtance of all, ſurrounded its ſurface; and the beams of
the ſun darting through, produced that light which, we are told, firſt
obeyed the Creator's command.</p>
            <p>The whole oeconomy of the creation being thus adjuſted, it only
remained to account for the riſings and depreſſions on the ſurface of
the earth, with the other ſeeming irregularities of its preſent appearance.
The hills and vallies are conſidered by him as formed by their preſſing
upon the internal fluid, which ſuſtains the outward ſhell of earth, with
greater or leſs weight: thoſe parts of the earth which are heavieſt,
ſink into the ſubjacent fluid more <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0823800101:49"/> deeply, and become
vallies: thoſe that are lighteſt, riſe higher upon the earth's ſurface,
and are called mountains.</p>
            <p>Such was the face of nature before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge; the earth was then
more fertile and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous than it is at preſent; the life of man and animals
was extended to ten times its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent duration; and all theſe advantages
aroſe from the ſuperior heat of the central globe, which ever ſince has
been cooling. As its heat was then in its full power, the genial prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple was
alſo much greater than at preſent; vegetation and animal encreaſe were
carried on with more vigour; and all nature ſeemed teeming with the ſeeds
of life. But theſe phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical advantages were only productive of moral evil;
the warmth which invigorated the body encreaſed the paſſions and
appetites of the mind; and, as man became more powerful, he grew leſs
innocent. It was found neceſſary to puniſh his depravity; and all living
creatures, except the fiſhes, who living in a cold element were not ſubject
to a ſimilitude of guilt, were overwhelmed by the deluge in univerſal
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>This deluge, which ſimple believers are willing to aſcribe to a
miracle, philoſophers have long been deſirous to account for by 
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0823800101:50"/> natural cauſes: they have proved that the earth could
never ſupply from any reſervoir towards its center, nor the atmoſphere by
any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from above, ſuch a quantity of water as would cover the
ſurface of the globe to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain depth over the tops of our higheſt
moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Where, therefore, was all this water to be found? Whiſton has
found enough, and more than a ſufficiency, in the tail of a comet; for he
ſeems to alot comets a very active part in the great operations of
nature.</p>
            <p>He calculates, with great ſeeming preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the year, the
month, and the day of the week on which this comet (which has paid the earth
ſome viſits ſince, though at a kinder diſtance) involved our globe in
its tail. The tail he ſuppoſed to be a vaporous fluid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
exhaled from the body of the comet, by the extreme heat of the ſun, and
encreaſing in proportion as it approached that great luminary. It was in this
that our globe was involved at the time of the deluge; and, as the earth
ſtill acted by its natural attraction, it drew to itſelf all the watery
vapours which were in the comet's tail; and the internal waters being alſo at
the ſame time let looſe, in a very ſhort ſpace the tops of the
higheſt mountains were laid under the deep.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0823800101:51"/>The puniſhment of the deluge being thus
compleated, and all the guilty deſtroyed, the earth, which had been broken by
the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the internal waters, was alſo enlarged by the ſame; ſo
that upon the comet's receſs, there was found room ſufficient in the
internal abyſs for the receſs of the ſuperfluous waters; whither they all
retired, and left the earth uncovered, but in ſome reſpects changed,
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in its figure, which, from being round, was now become oblate. In
this univerſal wreck of nature Noah ſurvived, by a variety of happy
cauſes, to re-people the earth, and to give birth to a race of men ſlow in
believing ill-imagined theories of the earth.</p>
            <p>After ſo many theories of the earth, which had been publiſhed,
applauded, anſwered, and forgotten, Mr. Buffon ventured to add one more to
the number. This philoſopher was, in every reſpect, better qualified than
any of his predeceſſors for ſuch an attempt, being furniſhed with more
materials, having a brighter imagination to find new proofs, and a better
ſtyle to cloath them in. However, if one ſo ill qualified, as I am, may
judge, this ſeems the weakeſt part of his admirable work; and I could
wiſh, that he had been content with giving us facts inſtead of ſyſtems;
that, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0823800101:52"/> of being a reaſoner, he had contented
himſelf with being merely an hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>He begins his ſyſtem by making a diſtinction between the
firſt part of it and the laſt; the one being founded only on conjecture,
the other depending entirely upon actual obſervation. The latter part of his
theory may, therefore, be true, though the former ſhould be found
erroneous.</p>
            <p>The planets, ſays he, and the earth, among the number, might have
been formerly (he only offers this as conjecture) a part of the body of the
ſun, and adherent to its ſubſtance. In this ſituation, a comet falling
in upon that great body might have given it ſuch a ſhock, and ſo ſhaken
its whole frame, that ſome of its particles might have been driven off like
ſtreaming ſparkles from red hot iron; and each of theſe ſtreams of
fire, ſmall as they were in compariſon of the ſun, might have been large
enough to have made an earth as great, nay many times greater than ours. So
that in this manner the planets, together with the globe which we inhabit,
might have been driven off from the body of the ſun by an impulſive force:
in this manner alſo they would continue to recede from it for ever, were they
not drawn back by its ſuperior power of attraction; and <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0823800101:53"/>
thus, by the combination of the two motions, they are wheeled round in
circles.</p>
            <p>Being in this manner detached at a diſtance from the body of the
ſun, the planets, from having been at firſt globes of liquid fire,
gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually became cool. The earth alſo having been daſhed obliquely
forward, received a rotatory motion upon its axis at the very inſtant of its
formation, and this motion being greateſt at the equator, the parts there
acting againſt the force of gravity, they muſt have ſwollen out, and
given the earth an oblate or flatted figure.</p>
            <p>As to its internal ſubſtance, our globe having once belonged to
the ſun, it continues to be an uniform maſs of melted matter, very
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably vitrified in its primaeval fuſion. But its ſurface is very
differently compoſed. Having been in the beginning heated to a degree equal
to, if not greater than what comets are found to ſuſtain; like them it had
an atmoſphere of vapours floating round it, and which cooling by degrees,
condenſed and ſubſided upon its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. Theſe vapours formed,
according to their different denſities, the earth, the water, and the air;
the heavier parts falling firſt, and the lighter remaining ſtill
ſuſpended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0823800101:54"/>Thus far our philoſopher is, at leaſt, as
much a ſyſtem maker as Whiſton or Burnet; and, indeed, he fights his way
with great perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ingenuity through a thouſand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that
naturally ariſe. Having, at laſt, got upon the earth, he ſuppoſes
himſelf on firmer ground, and goes forward with greater ſecurity. Turning
his attention to the preſent appearance of things upon this globe, he
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces from the view that the whole earth was at firſt under water. This
water he ſuppoſes to have been the lighter parts of its former evaporation,
which, while the earthy particles ſunk downwards by their natural gravity,
floated on the ſurface, and covered it for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpace of
time.</p>

revolution; ſince that would be to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that all the rocks in which
they are found, were, at that inſtant, in a ſtate of diſſolution; which
would be abſurd to aſſert. The ſea, therefore, depoſited them
whereſoever they are now to be found, and that by ſlow and
ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive degrees. 
<p>It will appear, alſo, that the ſea covered the whole earth,
from the appearance of its layers, which lying regularly one above the other,
ſeem all to reſemble the ſediment formed at different times by the ocean.
Hence, by the irregular force of its waves, and its currents driving the bottom
into ſand-banks, mountains muſt have been gradually formed within this
univerſal <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0823800101:56"/> covering of waters; and theſe
ſucceſſively raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their heads above its ſurface, muſt, in time,
have formed the higheſt ridges of mountains upon land, together with
continents, iſlands, and low grounds, all in their turns. This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion will
receive additional weight by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that in thoſe parts of the earth
where the power of the ocean is greateſt, the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities on the ſurface
of the earth are higheſt: the ocean's power is greateſt at the equator,
where its winds and tides are moſt conſtant; and, in fact, the mountains at
the equator are found to be higher than in any other part of the world. The
ſea, therefore, has produced the principal changes in our earth: rivers,
volcanoes, earthquakes, ſtorms, and rain, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made but ſlight
alterations, and only ſuch as have affected the globe to very
inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able depths.</p>

            <p>This is but a very ſlight ſketch of Mr. Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon's Theory of the
Earth; a theory which he has much more powerfully ſupported, than happily
invented; and it would be needleſs to take up the reader's time from the
purſuit of truth in the diſcuſſion of plauſibilities. In fact, a
thouſand queſtions might be aſked this moſt ingenious philoſopher,
which he would not find it eaſy to anſwer; but ſuch is the lot of 
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0823800101:57"/> humanity, that a ſingle Goth can in one day deſtroy
the fabric which Caeſars were employed an age in erecting. In fact, we might
aſk, how mountains, which are compoſed of the moſt compact and ponderous
ſubſtances, ſhould be the firſt whoſe parts the ſea began to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move? We might aſk, how foſſil-wood is found deeper even than
ſhells? which argues, that trees grew upon, the places he ſuppoſes once
to have been covered with the ocean. But we hope this excellent man is better
employed than to think of gratifying the petulance of incredulity, by
anſwering endleſs objections.</p>

            <p>WE may affirm of Mr. Buffon, that which has been ſaid of the
chymiſts of old: though he may have failed in attaining his principal aim, of
eſtabliſhing a theory, yet he has brought together ſuch a multitude of
facts relative to the hiſtory of the earth, and the nature of its

            <p>Before, therefore, I enter upon the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe parts

not be improper to give a ſhort hiſtory of thoſe animal productions that
are found in ſuch quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, either upon its ſurface, or at different
depths below it. They demand our curioſity, and, indeed, there is nothing in
natural hiſtory that has afforded more ſcope for doubt, conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and
ſpeculation. Whatever depths of the earth we examine, or at whatever
diſtance within land we ſeek, we moſt commonly find a number of
foſſil-ſhells, which being compared with others from the ſea, of known
kinds, are found to be exactly of a ſimilar ſhape and nature<note n="*" place="bottom">

the moſt retired and inward parts of the moſt firm and ſolid rocks, upon
the tops of even the higheſt hills and mountains, as well as in the valleys
and plains: and this not in one country alone, but in all places where there is
any digging for marble, chalk, or any <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0823800101:59"/> other terreſtrial

            <p>Theſe marine ſubſtances, ſo commonly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and ſo

            <p>With this plauſible ſolution mankind were for a long time
content; but upon cloſer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, they were obliged to alter their opinion.
It was found that theſe ſhells had, in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the properties of
animal and not of mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nature. They were found exactly of the ſame weight
with their fellow ſhells upon ſhore. They anſwered all the chymical
trials in the ſame manner as ſea ſhells do. Their parts, when
diſſolved, had the ſame appearance to view, the ſame ſmell and
taſte. They had the <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0823800101:60"/> ſame effects in medicine when
inwardly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered; and, in a word, were ſo exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to
marine bodies, that they had all the accidental concretions growing to them,
(ſuch as pearls, corals, and ſmaller ſhells) which are found in ſhells
juſt gathered on the ſhore. They were, therefore, from theſe
conſiderations, again given back to the ſea; but the wonder was, how to
account for their coming ſo far from their own natural element upon land<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Woodward, p. 43.</bibl>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>As this naturally gave riſe to many conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is not to be
wondered that ſome among them have been very extraordinary. An Italian,
quoted by Mr. Buffon, ſuppoſes them to have been depoſited in the earth
at the time of the cruſades, by the pilgrims who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from Jeruſalem;
who gathering them upon the ſea-ſhore, in their return carried them to
their different places of habitation. But this conjecturer ſeems to have but
a very inadequate idea of their numbers. At Touraine, in France, more than an
hundred miles from the ſea, there is a plain of about nine leagues long, and
as many broad, from whence the peaſants of the country ſupply themſelves
with marle for <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0823800101:61"/> manuring their lands. They ſeldom dig
deeper than twenty feet, and the whole plain is compoſed of the ſame
materials, which are ſhells of various kinds, without the ſmalleſt
portion of earth between them. Here, then, is a large ſpace, in which are
depoſited millions of tons of ſhells, which pilgrims could not have
collected though their whole employment had been nothing elſe. England is
furniſhed with its beds, which though not quite ſo exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, yet are
equally wonderful.

            <p>From all theſe inſtances we may conclude, that theſe

they afford no ſmall entertainment to obſerve them as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the

of the ſea ſhells which are known, and many others to which we are entirely

exactly expreſſing all the lineaments of animals, as having been wholly

very ſlow degrees, and the matter having nicely and exactly filled all the
cavities within, this matter, <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0823800101:64"/> after the ſhells have
periſhed, has preſerved exactly and regularly the whole print of their
internal ſurface Of theſe there are various kinds found in our pits; many
of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling thoſe of our own ſhores; and many others that are
only to be found on the coaſts of other countries. There are ſome ſhells
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling thoſe that are never ſtranded upon our coaſts<note n="*" place="bottom">Littorales.</note>, but that always remain in the deep<note n="†" place="bottom">Pelagii.</note>: and many more there are which we can
aſſimilate with no ſhells that are known amongſt us. But we find not
only ſhells in our pits, but alſo fiſhes and corals in great abundance;
together with almoſt every ſort of marine production.</p>
            <p>It is extraordinary enough, however, that the common red coral,
though ſo very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent at ſea, is ſcarce ſeen in the foſſil
world; nor is there any account of its hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever been met with. But to
recompence for this, there are all the kinds of the white coral now known; and
many other kinds of that ſubſtance with which we are unacquainted. Of
animals there are various parts; the vertebrae of whales, and the mouths of
leſſer fiſhes; theſe, <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0823800101:65"/> with teeth alſo of various
kinds, are found in the cabinets of the curious; where they receive long Greek
names, which it is neither the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention nor the province of this work to
enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate. Indeed, few readers would think themſelves much improved,
ſhould I proceed with enumerating the various claſſes of the
Conicthyodontes, Polyleptoginglimi, or the Orthoceratites. Theſe names, which
mean no great matter when they are explained, may ſerve to guide in the
furniſhing a cabinet; but they are of very little ſervice in furniſhing
the page of inſtructive hiſtory.</p>
            <p>From all theſe inſtances we ſee in what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance theſe
petrefactions are to be found; and, indeed, Mr. Buffon, to whoſe accounts we
have added ſome, has not been ſparing in the variety of his quotations,
concerning the places where they are moſtly to be found. However, I am
ſurprized that he ſhould have omitted the mention of one, which, in ſome
meaſure, more than any of the reſt, would have ſerved to ſtrengthen his
theory. We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by almoſt every traveller<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Haſſelquiſt, Sandys.</bibl>
               </note>, that has
deſcribed the pyramids of Egypt, that one of them is entirely built of a kind
of free-ſtone, <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0823800101:66"/> in which theſe petrified ſhells are
found in great abundance. This being the caſe, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, as we
have accounts of theſe pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids among the earlieſt records of mankind, and
of their being built ſo long before the age of Herodotus, who lived but
fifteen hundred years after the flood, that even the Egyptian prieſts could
tell neither the time nor the cauſe of their erection; I ſay it may be
conjectured that they were erected but a ſhort time after the flood. It is
not very likely, therefore, that the marine ſubſtances found in one of
them, had time to be formed into a part of the ſolid ſtone, either during
the deluge, or immediately after it; and, conſequently, their petrefaction
muſt have been before that period. And this is the opinion Mr. Buffon has all
along ſo ſtrenuouſly endeavoured to maintain; having given ſpecious
reaſons to prove, that ſuch ſhells were laid in the beds where they are
now found, not only before the deluge, but even antecedent to the formation of
man, at the time when the whole earth, as he ſuppoſes, was buried beneath a
covering of waters.</p>
            <p>But while there are many reaſons to perſuade us that theſe
extraneous foſſils have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited by the ſea, there is one fact
that will <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0823800101:67"/> abundantly ſerve to convince us that the earth
was habitable, if not inhabited, before theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine ſubſtances came to
be thus depoſited. For we find foſſil trees, which no doubt once grew
upon the earth, as deep, and as much in the body of ſolid rocks, as theſe
ſhells are found to be. Some of theſe fallen trees alſo, have lain at
leaſt as long, if not longer, in the earth, than the ſhells as they have
been found ſunk deep in a marly ſubſtance, compoſed of decayed
ſhells, and other marine productions. Mr. Buffon has proved that foſſil
ſhells could not have been depoſited in ſuch quantities all at once by
the flood; and I think, from the above inſtance, it is pretty plain, that,
howſoever they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited, the earth was covered with trees before
their depoſition; and, conſequently, that the ſea could not have made a
very permanent ſtay. How then ſhall we account for theſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
appearances in nature? A ſuſpenſion of all aſſent is certainly the
firſt, although the moſt mortifying conduct. For my own part, were I to
offer a conjecture, and all that has been ſaid upon this ſubject is but
conjecture, inſtead of ſuppoſing them to be the remains of animals
belonging to the ſea, I would conſider them rather as bred in the numerous
freſh-water lakes <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0823800101:68"/> that, in primaeval times, covered the
face of uncultivated nature. Some of theſe ſhells we know to belong to
freſh waters: ſome can be aſſimilated to none of the marine ſhells
now known<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Hill's Foſſils, p.

               </note>; why, therefore, may we not as well aſcribe the production
of all to freſh waters, where we do not find them, as we do that of the
latter to the ſea only, where we never find them? We know that lakes, and
lands alſo, have produced animals that are now no longer exiſting, why,
therefore, might not theſe foſſil productions be among the number? I
grant that this is making a very harſh ſuppoſition; but I cannot avoid
thinking, that it is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſo many embarraſſments as ſome
of the former, and that it is much eaſier to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that theſe ſhells
were bred in freſh water, than that the ſea had for a long time covered the
tops of the higheſt mountains.</p>

indeed, have been carried but to a very little depth below its ſurface, and

us, at the ſame time, ſhew our conſciouſneſs, that all theſe are
but ſuppoſitions.</p>
            <p>Upon examining the earth, where it has been opened to any depth, the
firſt thing that occurs, is the different layers or beds of which it is
compoſed: theſe all lying horizontally one over the other like the leaves
of a book, and each of them compoſed of materials that encreaſe in weight
in proportion as they lie deeper. This is, in general, the diſpoſition of
the different ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials where the earth ſeems to have remained unmoleſted;
but this order is frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; and we cannot tell whether from its
ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal formation, or from accidental cauſes. Of different ſubſtances,
thus diſpoſed, the far greateſt part of our globe conſiſts, from its
ſurface downwards to the greateſt depths we ever dig or mine<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Woodward, p. 9.</bibl>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>The firſt layer that is moſt commonly found at the ſurface, is
that light coat of blackiſh mold, which is called, by ſome, garden earth.
With this the earth is every where inveſted, unleſs it be waſhed off by
rains, or removed by ſome other external violence. This ſeems to have been
formed from animal and vegetable <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0823800101:71"/> bodies decaying, and thus
turning into its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. It alſo ſerves again as a ſtore-houſe,
from whence animal and vegetable nature are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and thus are all vital
bleſſings continued with unceaſing circulation. This earth, however, is
not to be ſuppoſed entirely pure, but is mixed up with much ſtony and
gravelly matter from the layers lying immediately beneath it. It generally
happens, that the ſoil is fertile in proportion to the quantity that this
putrified mold bears to the gravelly mixture; and as the former predominates,
ſo far is the vegetation upon it more luxuriant. It is this external covering
that ſupplies man with all the true riches he enjoys. He may bring up gold
and jewels from greater depths; but they are merely the toys of a capricious
being, things upon which he has placed an imaginary value, and for which fools
alone part with the more ſubſtantial bleſſings of life. It is this
earth, ſays Pliny<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Plinii Naturalis
Hiſtoria, lib. 2, cap. 63.</bibl>
               </note>, that, like a kind mother, receives
us at our birth, and ſuſtains us when born. It is this alone, of all the
ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments around us, that is never found an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to man. The body of waters
deluge him with rains, oppreſs him with hail, and drown him with inundations.
The air ruſhes in ſtorms, <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0823800101:72"/> prepares the tempeſt, or
lights up the volca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no; but the earth, gentle and indulgent, ever
ſubſervient to the wants of man, ſpreads his walks with flowers, and his
table with plenty; returns with intereſt every good committed to her care;
and, though ſhe produces the poiſon, ſhe ſtill ſupplies the antidote;
though conſtantly teized more to furniſh the luxuries of man than his
neceſſities, yet, even to the laſt, ſhe continues her kind indulgence,
and, when life is over, ſhe piouſly covers his remains in her boſom.</p>
            <p>This external and fruitful layer which covers the earth, is, as was
ſaid, in a ſtate of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual change. Vegetables, which are naturally
fixed and rooted to the ſame place, receive their adventitious nouriſhment
from the ſurrounding earth and water: animals, which change from place to
place, are ſupported by theſe, or by each other. Both, however, having for
a time enjoyed a life adapted to their nature, give back to the earth thoſe
ſpoils, which they had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed for a very ſhort ſpace, yet ſtill to
be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened again into freſh exiſtence. But the depoſits they make are
of very diſſimilar kinds, and the earth is very differently enriched by
their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. Thoſe countries that have for a long time ſupported men
and other animals, having been obſerved to become every day more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, 
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0823800101:73"/> while, on the contrary, thoſe deſolate places, in
which vegetables only are abundantly produced, are known to be poſſeſt of
amazing fertility.

                  </note>"In regions which are uninhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed," ſays Mr. Buffon,
"where the foreſts are not cut down, and where animals do not feed upon the
plants, the bed of vegetable earth is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly encreaſing. In all woods,
and even in thoſe which are often cut, there is a layer of earth of ſix or
eight inches thick, which has been formed by the leaves, branches and bark,
which fall and rot upon the ground. I have frequently obſerved on a Roman way
that croſſes Burgundy for a long extent, that there is a bed of black
earth, of more than a foot thick, gathered over the ſtony pavement, on which
ſeveral trees, of a very conſiderable ſize, are ſupported. This I have
found to be nothing elſe than an earth formed by decayed leaves and branches,
which have been converted by time into a black ſoil. Now as vegetables draw
much more of their nouriſhment from the air and water than they do from the
earth, it muſt follow, that in rotting upon the ground, they muſt give more
to the ſoil than they have taken from it. Hence, therefore, in woods kept a
long time without cutting, the ſoil below <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0823800101:74"/> encreaſes to
a conſiderable depth; and ſuch we actually find the ſoil in thoſe
American wilds where the foreſts have been undiſturbed for ages. But it is
otherwiſe where men and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals have long ſubſiſted; for as they make
a conſiderable conſumption of wood and plants, both for firing and other
uſes, they take more from the earth than they return to it: it follows,
therefore, that the bed of vegetable earth, in an inhabited country, muſt be
always dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing; and muſt, at length, reſemble the ſoil of Arabia
Petrea, and other provinces of the Eaſt, which having been long inhabited,
are now become plains of ſalt and ſand; the fixed ſalt always remaining
while the other vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile parts have flown away."</q>
            </p>
            <p>If from this external ſurface we deſcend deeper, and view the
earth cut perpendicularly downwards, either in the banks of great rivers, or
ſteepy ſea-ſhores; or, going ſtill deeper, if we obſerve it in
quarries or mines, we ſhall find its layers regularly diſpoſed in their
proper or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. We muſt not expect, however, to find them of the ſame kind
or thickneſs in every place, as they differ in different ſoils and
ſituations. Sometimes marle is ſeen to be over ſand, and ſometimes
under it. The moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſpoſition is, that under the firſt earth 
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0823800101:75"/> is found gravel or ſand, then clay or marle, then chalk
or coal, marbles, oars, ſands, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and thus an alternation of theſe
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, each growing more denſe as it ſinks deeper. The clay, for
inſtance, found at the depth of an hundred feet, is uſually more heavy than
that found not far from the ſurface. In a well which was dug at Amſterdam,
to the depth of two hundred and thirty feet, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſubſtances were
found in ſucceſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>In a well dug at Marly, to the depth of an hundred feet, Mr. Buffon
gives us a ſtill more exact enumeration of its layers of earth. 
<q rend="inline">Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of a reddiſh gravel, two of gravel

and fifteen of reddiſh vitrifiable ſand."</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this manner the earth is every where found in beds over beds;
and, what is ſtill remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, each of them, as far as it extends, always
maintains exactly the ſame thickneſs. It is found alſo, that, as we
proceed to conſiderable depths, every layer grows thicker. Thus in the
adduced inſtances we might have obſerved, that the laſt layer was fifteen
feet thick, while moſt of the others were not above eight, and this might
have gone much deeper, for aught we can tell, as before they got through it the
workmen ceaſed digging.</p>
            <p>Theſe layers are ſometimes very extenſive, and often are found
to obtain over a ſpace of ſome leagues in circumference. But it muſt 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0823800101:77"/> not be ſuppoſed that they are uniformly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
over the whole globe without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: on the contrary, they are ever,
at ſmall intervals, cracked through as it were by perpendicular fiſſures;
the earth reſembling, in this reſpect, the muddy bottom of a pond, from
whence the water has been dried off by the ſun, and thus gaping in ſeveral
chinks, which deſcend in a direction perpendicular to its ſurface. Theſe
fiſſures are many times found empty, but oftener cloſed up with
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious ſubſtances, that the rain, or ſome other accidental
cauſes, have conveyed to fill their cavities. Their openings are not leſs
different than their contents, ſome being not above half an inch wide, ſome
a foot, and ſome ſeveral hundred yards aſunder. Theſe laſt form
thoſe dreadful chaſms that are to be found in the Alps, at the edge of
which the traveller ſtands dreading to look down at the immeaſurable gulph
below. Theſe amazing clefts are well known to ſuch as have paſt theſe
mountains, where a chaſm frequently preſents itſelf ſeveral hundred
feet deep, and as many over, at the edge of which the way lies. It often
happens alſo, that the road leads along the bottom, and then the ſpectator
obſerves on each ſide frightful precipices ſeveral hundred 
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0823800101:78"/> yards above him; the ſides of which tally ſo exactly
with each other, that they evidently ſeem torn aſunder.</p>
            <p>But theſe chaſms to be found in the Alps, are nothing to what
Ovalle tells us are to be ſeen in the Andes. Theſe amazing mountains, in
compariſon of which the former are but little hills, have their fiſſures
in proportion to their greatneſs. In ſome places they are a mile wide, and
deep in proportion; and there are ſome others, that running underground, in
extent reſemble a province.</p>
            <p>Of this kind alſo is that cavern called Elden-hole, in
Derbyſhire; which, Dr. Plot tells us, was ſounded by a line of eight and
twenty hundred feet, without finding the bottom, or meeting with water: and yet
the mouth at the top is not above forty yards over<note n="*" place="bottom">

im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable cavern runs perpendicularly down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and the ſides of it
ſeem totally ſo plainly as to ſhew that they once were united. Thoſe
who come to viſit the place, generally procure ſtones to be thrown into its
mouth; and theſe are heard for ſeveral minutes, falling and ſtriking
againſt the ſides of the cavern, producing a ſound that reſembles
diſtant thunder, dying away as the ſtone goes deeper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0823800101:79"/>Of this kind alſo is that dreadful cavern

<q rend="inline">"In the country of the Arrian Indians, is to be
ſeen an amazing chaſm, which is called, The Gulph of Pluto. The depth, and
the receſſes of this horrid place, are as extenſive as they are unknown.
Neither the natives, nor the curious who viſit it, are able to tell how it
firſt was made, or to what depths it deſcends. The Indians continually
drive thither great multitudes of animals, more than three thouſand at a
time, of different kinds, ſheep, horſes and goats; and, with an abſurd
ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, force them into the cavity, from whence they never return.
Their ſeveral ſounds, however, are heard as they deſcend; the bleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſheep, the lowing of oxen, and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of horſes, iſſuing up
to the mouth of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern. Nor do theſe ſounds ceaſe, as the place is
continually furniſhed with a freſh ſupply."</q>
            </p>
            <p>There are many more of theſe dreadful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular fiſſures
in different parts of the earth; with accounts of which, Kircher, Gaffarellus,
and others who have given hiſtories of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the ſubterranean
world, abundantly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply us. The generality of readers, however, will
conſider them with leſs aſtoniſhment, when they are informed of their
being common all <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0823800101:80"/> over the earth: that in every field, in
every quarry, theſe perpendicular fiſſures are to be found; either
ſtill gaping, or filled with matter that has accidentally cloſed their
interſtices. The inattentive ſpectator neglects the enquiry, but their
being common is partly the cauſe that excites the philoſopher's attention
to them; the irregularities of nature he is often content to let paſs
unexamined; but when a conſtant and a common appearance preſents itſelf,
every return of the object is a freſh call to his curioſity; and the chink
in the next quarry becomes as great a matter of wonder as the chaſm in
Elden-hole. Philoſophers have long, therefore, endeavoured to find out the
cauſe of theſe perpendicular fiſſures, which our own countrymen,
Woodward and Ray, were the firſt that found to be ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and
univerſal. Mr. Buffon ſuppoſes them to be cracks made by the ſun, in
drying up the earth immediately after its emerſion from the deep. The heat of
the ſun is very probably a principal cauſe; but it is not right to
aſcribe to one only, what we find may be the reſult of many. Earthquakes,
ſevere froſts, burſting waters, and ſtorms tearing up the roots of
trees, have, in our own times, produced them: and to this variety of cauſes,
we muſt, at preſent, be content to aſſign thoſe that have happened
before we had opportunities for obſervation.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VIII. Of Caves and ſubterraneous Paſſages that
ſink, but not perpendicularly, into the Earth.</head>
            <p>IN ſurveying the ſubterranean wonders of the globe, beſides
thoſe fiſſures that deſcend perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly downwards, we frequently
find others that deſcend but a little way, and then ſpread themſelves
often to a great extent below the ſurface. Many of theſe caverns, it muſt
be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, may be the production of art and human induſtry; retreats
made to protect the oppreſſed, or ſhelter the ſpoiler. The famous
labyrinth of Candia, for inſtance, is ſuppoſed to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely the work
of art. Mr. Tournefort aſſures us, that it bears the impreſſion of
human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and that great pains have been beſtowed upon its
formation. The ſtone-quarry of Maeſtricht is evidently made by labour:
carts enter at its mouth, and load within, then return and diſcharge their
freight into boats that lie on the brink of the river Maeſe. This quarry is
ſo large, that forty thouſand people may take ſhelter in it: and it in
general ſerves for this purpoſe, when armies march that way; becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then
an impregnable retreat to the people <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0823800101:82"/> that live thereabout.
Nothing can be more beautiful than this cavern, when lighted up with torches;
for there are thouſands of ſquare pillars, in large level walks, about
twenty feet high; and all wrought with much neatneſs and regularity. In this
vaſt grotto there is very little rubbiſh; which ſhews both the goodneſs
of the ſtone, and the carefulneſs of the workmen. To add to its beauty,
there alſo are in various parts of it, little pools of water, for the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of the men and cattle. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able alſo, that no droppings
are ſeen to fall from the roof, nor are the walks any way wet under foot,
except in caſes of great rains, where the water gets in by the air ſhafts.
The Salt mines in Poland are ſtill more ſpacious than theſe. Some of the
catacombs, both in Egypt and Italy, are ſaid to be very extenſive. But no
part of the world has a greater number of artificial caverns than Spain, which
were made to ſerve as retreats to the Chriſtians, againſt the fury of the
Moors, when the latter conquered that country. However, an account of the works
of art, does not properly belong to a natural hiſtory. It will be enough to
obſerve, that though caverns be found in every country, far the greateſt
part of them have been faſhioned only by the hand of Nature. Their ſize is
found beyond the <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0823800101:83"/> power of man to have effected; and their
forms but ill adapted to the conveniences of an human habitation. In ſome
places, indeed, we find mankind ſtill make uſe of them as houſes;
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in thoſe countries where the climate is very ſevere<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Phil. Tranſ. vol. ii. p. 368.</bibl>
               </note>; but in
general they are deſerted by every race of meaner animals, except the bat;
theſe nocturnal ſolitary creatures are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the only inhabitants; and
theſe only in ſuch whoſe deſcent is ſloping, or, at leaſt, not
directly perpendicular.</p>
            <p>There is ſcarce a country in the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its natural
caverns; and many new cries are diſcovered every day. Of thoſe in England,
Oakey-hole, The Devil's-hole, and Penpark-hole, have been often deſcribed.
The former, which lies on the ſouth ſide of Mendip-hills<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ibid.</bibl>
               </note>, within a mile of the town of Wells, is
much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to by travellers. To conceive a juſt idea of this, we muſt
imagine a precipice of more than an hundred yards high, on the ſide of a
mountain which ſhelves away a mile above it. In this is an opening not very
large, into which you enter, going along upon a rocky uneven pavement,
ſometimes aſcending, and ſometimes deſcending. The roof of it, as you
advance, grows higher; and, in ſome places, is fifty feet <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0823800101:84"/> from the floor. In ſome places, however, it is ſo low that a man
muſt ſtoop to paſs. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends itſelf, in length, about two hundred
yards; and from every part of the roof, and the floor, there are formed
ſparry concretions of various figures, that by ſtrong imaginations have
been likened to men, lion, and organs. At the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt part of this cavern
riſes a ſtream of water, well ſtored with fiſh, large enough to turn a
mill, and which diſcharges itſelf near the entrance.</p>
            <p>Penpark-hole, in Glouceſterſhire, is almoſt as remarkable as
the former. Captain Sturmey deſcended into this by a rope, twenty-five
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms perpendicular, and at the bottom found a very large vault in the
ſhape of an horſe-ſhoe. The floors conſiſted of a kind of white
ſtone enamelled with lead ore, and the pendent rocks were glazed with ſpar.
Walking forward on this ſtony pavement, for ſome time, he came to a great
river, twenty fathoms broad, and eight fathoms deep; and having been informed
that it ebbed and flowed with the ſea, he remained in this gloomy abode for
five hours, to make an exact obſervation. He did not find, however, any
alteration whatſoever in its appearance. But his curioſity was ill
requited; for it coſt this unfortunate gentleman his life: immediately 
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0823800101:85"/> after his return, he was ſeized with an unuſual and
violent head-ach, which threw him into a fever, of which he died ſoon
after.</p>
            <p>But of all the ſubterraneous caverns now known, the grotto of
Antiparos is the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, as well for its extent, as for the beauty
of its ſparry incruſtations. This celebrated ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern was firſt
diſcovered by one Magni, an Italian traveller, about an hundred years ago, at
Antiparos, an inconſiderable iſland of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipelago<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Kircher Mund. ſub. 122.</bibl> I have tranſlated a part
of Kircher's deſcription, rather than Tournefort's, as the latter was written
to ſupport an hypotheſis.</note>. The account he gives of it is long and
inflated, but upon the whole amuſing. 
<q rend="inline">"Having been informed," ſays he, "by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of Paros, that in the little iſland of Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros, which lies about two miles
from the former, of a gigantic ſtatue that was to be ſeen at the mouth of a
cavern in that place, it was reſolved that we (the French conſul and
himſelf) ſhould pay it a viſit. In purſuance of this reſolution,
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had landed on the iſland, and walked about four, miles thro' the
midſt of beautiful plains, and ſloping woodlands, we at length came to a
little hill, on the ſide of which yawned a moſt horrid cavern, that with
its gloom at firſt ſtruck us with terror, and almoſt repreſt
curioſity. Recovering <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0823800101:86"/> the firſt ſurprize, however,
we entered boldly; and had not proceeded above twenty paces, when the
ſuppoſed ſtatue of the giant preſented itſelf to our view. We quickly
perceived, that what the ignorant natives had been terrified at as a giant, was
nothing more than a ſparry concretion, formed by the water dropping from the
roof of the cave, and by degrees hardening into a figure that their fears had
formed into a monſter. Incited by this extraordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, we were
induced to proceed ſtill far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in queſt of new adventures in this
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean abode. As we proceeded, new won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders offered themſelves; the
ſpars, formed into trees and ſhrubs, preſented a kind of petrified grove;
ſome white, ſome green; and all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding in due perſpective. They
ſtruck us with the more amazement, as we knew them to be mere productions of
Nature, who, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in ſolitude, had, in her playful moments, dreſſed
the ſcene, as if for her own amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 
<p>"But we had as yet ſeen but a few of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the
place; and we were introduced as yet only into the portico of this amazing
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. In one corner of this half illuminated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, there appeared an
opening of about three feet wide, which ſeemed to lead to a place to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0823800101:87"/> dark, and that one of the natives aſſured us contained
nothing more than a reſervoir of water. Upon this we tried, by throwing down
ſome ſtones, which rumbling along the ſides of the deſcent for ſome
time, the ſound ſeemed at laſt quaſhed in a bed of water. In order,
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to be more certain, we ſent in a Levantine mariner, who, by the
promiſe of a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, with a flambeaux in his hand, ventured into this
narrow aperture. After continuing within it for about a quarter of an hour, he
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, carrying ſome beautiful pieces of white ſpar in his hand, which
art could neither imitate nor equal. Upon being informed by him that the place
was full of theſe beautiful incruſtations, I ventured in once more with
him, for about fifty paces, anxiouſly and cautiouſly deſcending by a
ſteep and dangerous way. Finding, however, that we came to a precipice which
led into a ſpacious amphitheatre, if I may ſo call it, ſtill deeper than
any other part, we returned, and being provided with a ladder, flambeaux, and
other things to expedite our deſcent, our whole company, man by man, ventured
into the ſame opening, and deſcending one after another, we at laſt ſaw
ourſelves all together in the moſt magnificent part of the cavern.</p> 
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0823800101:88"/>"Our candles being now all lighted up, and
the whole place completely illuminated, never could the eye be preſented with
a more glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or a more magnificent ſcene. The roof all hung with
ſolid iſicles, tranſparent as glaſs, yet ſolid as marble. The eye
could ſcarce reach the lofty and noble cieling; the ſides were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
formed with ſpars; and the whole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the idea of a magnificent
theatre, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with an immenſe profuſion of lights. The floor
conſiſted of ſolid marble; and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, magnificent columns,
thrones, altars, and other objects appeared, as if nature had deſigned to
mock the curioſities of art. Our voices, upon ſpeaking or ſinging, were
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled to an aſtoniſhing loudneſs; and upon the firing of a gun, the
noiſe and reverberations were almoſt deafening. In the midſt of this
grand amphitheatre roſe a concretion of about fifteen feet high, that, in
ſome meaſure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled an altar; from which, taking the hint, we
cauſed maſs to be celebrated there. The beautiful columns that ſhot up
round the altar, appeared like candleſticks; and many other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural objects
repreſented the cuſtomary orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this ſacrament.</p> 
                  <p>"Below even this ſpacious grotto, there ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another
cavern; down which I ventured with <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0823800101:89"/> my former mariner, and
deſcended about fifty paces by means of a rope. I at laſt arrived at a
ſmall ſpot of level ground, where the bottom appeared different from that
of the amphithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, being compoſed of ſoft clay, yielding to the
preſſure, and in which I thruſt a ſtick to about ſix feet deep. In
this, however, as above, numbers of the moſt beautiful chryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals were
formed; one of which, particularly, reſembled a table. Upon our egreſs from
this amazing cavern, we perceived a Greek inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon a rock at the
mouth, but ſo oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by time, that we could not read it. It ſeemed to
import that one Antipater, in the time of Alexander, had come thither; but
whether he penetrated into the depths of the cavern, he does not think fit to
inform us."</p> 
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Such is the account of this beautiful ſcene, as communicated in a
letter to Kircher. We have another, and a more copious deſcription of it by
Tournefort, which is in every body's hands; but I have given the above, both
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was communicated by the firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, and becauſe it
is a ſimple narrative of facts, without any reaſoning upon them. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Tournefort's account, indeed, we might conclude, from the rapid growth of
the ſpars in this grotto, that it muſt every year be growing 
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0823800101:90"/> narrower, and that it muſt, in time, be choaked up with
them entirely; but no ſuch thing has happened hitherto, and the grotto at
this day continues as ſpacious as we ever knew it.</p>
            <p>This is not the place for an enquiry into the ſeeming vegetation
of thoſe ſtony ſubſtances with which this and almoſt every cavern are
incruſted. It is enough to obſerve, in general, that they are formed by an
accumulation of that little gritty matter which is carried thither by the
waters, and which in time acquires the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of marble. What in this
place more imports us to know is, how theſe amazing hollows in the earth came
to be formed. And I think, in the three inſtances above-mentioned, it is
pretty evident, that their excavation has been owing to waters. Theſe finding
ſubterraneous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages under the earth, and by long degrees hollowing
the beds in which they flowed, the ground above them has ſlipt down cloſer
to their ſurface, leaving the upper layers of the earth or ſtone ſtill
ſuſpended. The ground that ſinks upon the face of the waters forming the
floor of the cavern; the ground, or rock that keeps ſuſpended, forming the

            <p>THE caverns, which we have been deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, generally carry us
but a very little way below the ſurface of the earth. Two hundred feet, at
the utmoſt, is as much as the loweſt of them is found to ſink. The
perpendicular fiſſures run much deeper; but few perſons have been bold
enough to venture down to their deepeſt receſſes: and ſome few who have
tried, have been able to bring back no tidings of the place, for unfortunately
they left their lives below. The excavations of art have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced us much
further into the bowels of the globe. Some mines in Hungary are known to be a
thouſand yards perpendicularly down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and I have been informed, by good
au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, of a coal mine in the north of England, an hundred yards deeper
ſtill.</p>
            <p>It is beſide our preſent purpoſe to enquire into the peculiar
conſtruction and contrivance of theſe, which more properly belongs to the
hiſtory of foſſils. It will be ſufficient to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in this place,
that as we deſcend into the <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0823800101:92"/> mines, the various layers of
earth are ſeen, as we have already deſcribed them; and in ſome of theſe
are always found the metals or minerals, for which the mine has been dug. Thus
frequently gold is found diſperſed and mixed with clay and gravel<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ulloa, vol. ii. p. 470.</bibl>
               </note>; ſometimes it
is mingled with other metallic bodies, ſtones, or bitumens; and<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ulloa. ibid.</bibl>
               </note> ſometimes united
with that moſt obſtinate of all ſubſtances, platina, from which
ſcarce any art can ſeparate it. Silver is ſometimes found quite pure<note n="‡" place="bottom">

               </note>, ſometimes mixed with other ſubſtances and minerals.
Copper is found in beds mixed with various ſubſtances, marbles, ſulphurs,
and pyrites. Tin, the ore of which is heavier than that of any other metal, is
generally found mixed with every kind of matter:

                  <bibl>Hill's Foſſils, p.

               </note>lead is alſo equally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and iron we well know can be
extracted from all the ſubſtances upon earth.</p>
            <p>The variety of ſubſtances which are thus found in the bowels of
the earth, in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtate, have a very different appearance from what
they are afterwards taught to aſſume by human induftry. The richeſt
metals are very often leſs glittering and ſplendid than the moſt 
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0823800101:93"/> uſeleſs marcaſites, and the baſeſt ores are in
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral the moſt beautiful to the eye.</p>
            <p>This variety of ſubſtances, which compoſe the internal parts
of our globe, is productive of equal varieties, both above and below its
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. The combination of the different mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals with each other, the
heats which ariſe from their mixture, the vapours they diffuſe, the fires
which they generate, or the colds which they ſometimes produce, are all
either noxious or ſalutary to man; ſo that in this great elabra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of
nature, a thouſand benefits and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are forging, of which we are
wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious; and it is happy for us that we are ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Boyle, vol. iii. p.
232.</bibl>
               </note>Upon our deſcent into mines of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able depth, the
cold ſeems to encreaſe from the mouth as we deſcend; but after
paſſing very low down, we begin, by degrees, to come into a warmer air,
which ſenſibly grows hotter as we go deeper, till, at laſt, the labourers
can ſcarce bear any covering as they continue working.</p>
            <p>This difference in the air was ſuppoſed by Boyle to proceed from
magazines of fire that lay nearer the centre, and that diffuſed their heat to
the adjacent regions. But we now <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0823800101:94"/> know that it may be
aſcribed to more obvious cauſes. In ſome mines, the compoſition of the
earth all around is of ſuch a nature, that upon the admiſſion of water or
air, it frequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes hot, and often burſts out into eruptions.
Beſide this, as the external air cannot readily reach the bottom, or be
renewed there, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable heat is perceived below, without the
neceſſity of recurring to the central heat for an explanation.</p>
            <p>Hence, therefore, there are two principal cauſes of the warmth at
the bottom of mine: the heat of the ſubſtances of which the ſides are
compoſed; and the want of renovation in the air below. Any ſulphureous
ſubſtance mixed with iron, produces a very great heat, by the admiſſion
of water. If, for inſtance, a quantity of ſulphur be mixed with a
proportionable ſhare of iron filings, and both kneaded together into a ſoft
paſte, with water, they will ſoon grow hot, and at laſt produce a flame.
This experiment, produced by art, is very commonly effected within the bowels
of the earth by nature. Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs and irons are intimately blended together,
and want only the mixture of water of air to excite their heat; and this, when
once raiſed, is communicated to all bodies that lie within the ſphere of
their operation. Thoſe beautiful <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0823800101:95"/> minerals, called
marcaſites and pyrites, are often of this compoſition; and wherever they
are found, either by imbibing the moiſture of the air, or having been by any
means combined with water, they render the mine conſiderably hot<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Kircher Mund. Subt. vol. ii. p. 216.</bibl>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>The want of freſh air, alſo, at theſe depths, is, as we have
ſaid, another reaſon for their being found much hotter. Indeed, without the
aſſiſtance of art, the bottom of moſt mines would, from this cauſe,
be inſupportable. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this inconvenience, the miners are often obliged
to ſink, at ſome convenient diſtance from the mouth of the pit where they
are at work, another pit, which joins the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and which, in
Derbyſhire, is called an air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaft. Through this the air circulates; and
thus the workmen are enabled to breathe freely at the bottom of the place;
which becomes, as Mr. Boyle affirms, very commodious for reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration; and
alſo very temperate as to heat and cold<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Boyle, vol. iii. p. 238.</bibl>
               </note>. Mr. Locke, however,
who has left us an account of the Mendip mines, ſeems to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a
different picture. 
<q rend="inline">"The deſcent into theſe is exceeding difficult
and dangerous; for they are not ſunk like wells, perpendicularly, 
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0823800101:96"/> but as the crannies of the rocks happen to run. The
conſtant method is to ſwing down by a rope, placed under the arms, and
clamber along, by applying both feet and hands to the ſides of the narrow
paſſage. The air is conveyed into them through a little paſſage that
runs along the ſides from the top, where they ſet up ſome turfs, on the
lee-ſide of the hole, to catch and force it down. Theſe turfs being removed
to the windy ſide, or laid over the mouth of the hole, the miners below
preſently want breath, and faint; and if ſweet ſmelling flowers chance to
be placed there, they immediately loſe their fragrancy, and ſtink like
carrion."</q> An air ſo very pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying can never be very commodious for
reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if we examine the complexion of moſt miners, we ſhall be
very well able to form a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the unwholſomneſs of the place where
they are confined. Their pale and ſallow looks ſhew how much the air is
damaged by paſſing through thoſe deep and winding ways, that are rendered
humid by damps, or warmed with nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious exhalations. But although every mine is
unwholſome, all are not equally ſo. Coal-mines are generally leſs noxious
than thoſe of tin; tin than thoſe of copper; but of all, none are ſo
dreadfully deſtructive as thoſe of quickſilver. <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0823800101:97"/> At
the mines near the village of Idra, nothing can adequately deſcribe the
deplorable infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of ſuch as fill the hoſpital there: ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated and
crippled, every limb contracted or convulſed, and ſome in a manner
tranſpiring quickſilver at every pore. There was one man, ſays Dr.
Pope<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Phil. Tranſ. vol. ii. p.
578.</bibl>
               </note>, who was not in the mines above half a year, and yet whoſe
body was ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with this mineral, that putting a piece of braſs
money in his mouth, or rubbing it between his fingers, it immediately became as
white as if it had been waſhed over with quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver. In this manner all
the workmen are killed, ſooner or later; firſt becoming paralytic, and then
dying conſumptive: and all this they ſuſtain for the trifling reward of
ſeven-pence a day.</p>
            <p>But theſe metalic mines are not ſo noxious from their own
vapours, as from thoſe of the ſubſtances with which the ores are
uſually united, ſuch as arſenic, cinnabar, bitumen, or vitriol. From the
fumes of theſe, variouſly combined, and kept encloſed, are produced
thoſe various damps that put on ſo many dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful forms, and are uſually
ſo fatal. Sometimes thoſe noxious vapours are perceived by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
fragrance of their ſmell<note n="§" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ibid. p.

               </note>, ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the pea-bloſſom in bloom, from
whence <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0823800101:98"/> one kind of damp has its name. The miners are not
deceived, however, by its flattering appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances; but as they thus have timely
notice of its coming, they avoid it while it continues, which is generally
during the whole ſummer ſeaſon. Another ſhews its approach by the
burning of the candles, which ſeem to collect their flame into a globe of
light, and thus gradually leſſen, till they are quite extinguiſhed. From
this alſo, the miners frequently eſcape; however, ſuch as have the
misfortune to be caught in it, either ſwoon away, and are ſuffocated, or
ſlowly recover in exceſſive agonies. Here is alſo a third, called the
fulminating damp, much more dangerous than either of the former, as it
ſtrikes down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, like a flaſh of gunpowder, without giving any
warning of its approach. But there is ſtill another, more deadly than all the
reſt, which is found in thoſe places where the vapour has been long
confined, and has been, by ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſet free. The air ruſhing out
from thence, always goes upon deadly errands; and ſcarce any eſcape to
deſcribe the ſymptoms of its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>Some colliers in Scotland, working near an old mine that had been
long cloſed up, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened inadvertently to open an hole into it, from the pit
where they were then employed. <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0823800101:99"/> By great good fortune, they
at that time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their error, and inſtantly fled for their lives. The
next day, however, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to renew their work in the ſame pit,
and eight of them ventured down, without any great apprehenſions; but they
had ſcarce got to the bottom of the ſtairs that led to the pit, but coming
within the vapour, they all inſtantly dropped down dead, as if they had been
ſhot. Amongſt theſe unfortunate poor men, there was one whoſe wife was
informed that he was ſtifled in the mine; and as he happened to be next the
entrance, ſhe ſo far ventured down as to ſee where he lay. As ſhe
approached the place, the ſight of her huſband inſpired her with a
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to reſcue him, if poſſible, from that dreadful ſituation;
though a little reflection might have ſhewn her it was then too late. But
nothing could deter her; ſhe ventured forward, and had ſcarce touched him
with her hand, when the damp prevailed, and the miſguided, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
creature, fell dead by his ſide.</p>
            <p>Thus, the vapours found beneath the ſurface of the earth, are very
various in their effects upon the conſtitution: and they are not leſs in
their appearances. There are many kinds that ſeemingly are no way prejudicial
to health, but in which the workmen breathe freely; and yet 
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0823800101:100"/> in theſe, if a lighted candle be introduced, they
immediately take fire, and the whole cavern at once becomes one furnace of
flame. In mines, therefore, ſubject to damps of this kind, they are obliged
to have recourſe to a very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar contrivance to ſupply ſufficient
light for their operations. This is by a great wheel; the circumference of
which is beſet with flints, which ſtriking againſt ſteels placed for
that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at the extremity, a ſtream of fire is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, which
affords light enough; and yet which does not ſet fire to the mineral
vapour.</p>
            <p>Of this kind are the vapours of the mines about Briſtol: on the
contrary, in other mines, a ſingle ſpark ſtruck out from the colliſion
of flint and ſteel, would ſet the whole ſhaft in a flame. In ſuch,
therefore, every precaution is uſed to avoid a colliſion ; the workmen
making uſe only of wooden inſtruments in digging; and being cautious before
they enter the mine, to take out even the nails from their ſhoes. Whence this
ſtrange difference ſhould ariſe, that the vapours of ſome mines catch
fire with a ſpark, and others only with a flame, is a queſtion that we
muſt be content to leave in obſcurity, till we know more of the nature both
of mineral vapour and of fire, This only we may obſerve, that gunpowder will
readily fire <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0823800101:101"/> with a ſpark, but not with the flame of a
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: on the other hand, ſpirits of wine will flame with a candle, but not
with a ſpark; but even here the cauſe of this difference, as yet, remains a
ſecret.</p>
            <p>As from this account of mines, it appears that the internal parts of
the globe are filled with vapours of various kinds, it is not ſupriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they ſhould at different times reach the ſurface, and there put on
various appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. In fact, much of the ſalubrity, and much of the
unwholſomeneſs of climates and ſoils, is to be aſcribed to theſe
vapours, which make their way from the bowels of the earth upwards, and
refreſh or taint the air with their exhalations. Salt mines being naturally
cold<note n="*" place="bottom">

comfort and refreſh it: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, metallic mines are known, not only
to warm it with their exhalations, but often to deſtroy all kinds of
vegetation by their volatile corroſive fumes. In ſome mines denſe vapours
are plainly perceived iſſuing from their mouths, and ſenſibly warm to
the touch. In ſome places, neither ſnow nor ice will continue on the ground
that covers a mine; and over others <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0823800101:102"/>

               </note>. The inhabitants,
alſo, are rendered dreadfully ſenſible of theſe ſubterraneous
exhalations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affected with ſuch a variety of evils pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
entirely from this cauſe, that books have been profeſſedly written upon
this claſs of diſorders.</p>
            <p>Nor are theſe vapours which thus eſcape to the ſurface of the
earth, entirely unconfined; for they are frequently, in a manner,
circumſcribed to a ſpot: the grotto Del Cane, near Naples, is an inſtance
of this; the noxious effects of which have made that cavern ſo very famous.
This grotto, which has ſo much employed the attention of travellers, lies
within four miles of Naples, and is ſituated near a large lake of clear and
wholeſome water<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Kircher Mund. Subt. vol.
i. p. 191.</bibl>
               </note>. Nothing can exceed the beauty of the landſcape
which this lake affords; being ſurrounded with hills covered with foreſts
of the moſt beautiful ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and the whole bearing a kind of
amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatrical appearance. However, this region, beautiful as it appears, is
almoſt entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited; the few peaſants that neceſſity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
to reſide there, looking quite conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ghaſtly, from the
poiſonous exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0823800101:105"/> that riſe from the earth. The
famous grotto lies on the ſide of an hill, near which place a peaſant
reſides, who keeps a number of dogs for the purpoſe of ſhewing the
expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment to the curious. Theſe poor animals always ſeem perfectly
ſenſible of the approach of a ſtranger, and endeavour to get out of the
way. However, their attempts being perceived, they are taken and brought to the
grotto; the noxious effects of which they have ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently experienced.
Upon entering this place, which is a little cave, or hole rather, dug into the
hill, about eight feet high and twelve feet long, the obſerver can ſee no
viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble marks of its peſtilential vapour; only to about a foot from the
bottom, the wall ſeems to be tinged with a colour reſembling that which is
given by ſtagnant waters. When the dog, this poor philoſophical martyr, as
ſome have called him, is held above this mark, he does not ſeem to feel the
ſmalleſt inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but when his head is thruſt down lower, he
ſtruggles to get free for a little; but in the ſpace of four or five
minutes he ſeems to loſe all ſenſation, and is taken out ſeemingly
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life. Being plunged in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lake, he quickly recovers,
and is permitted <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0823800101:106"/> to run home ſeemingly without the
ſmalleſt injury.</p>
            <p>This vapour, which thus for a time ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, is of the humid
kind, as it extinguiſhes a torch, and ſullies a looking-glaſs; but there
are other vapours perfectly inflamable, and that only require the approach of a
candle to ſet them blazing. Of this kind was the burning well at Broſely,
which is now ſtopped up; the vapour of which, when a candle was brought
within about a foot of the ſurface of the water, caught flame like ſpirits
of wine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued blazing for ſeveral hours after. Of this kind,
alſo, are the perpetual fires in the kingdom of Perſia. In that province,
where the worſhippers of fire hold their chief myſteries, the whole
ſurface of the earth, for ſome extent, ſeems impregnated with inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
vapours. A reed ſtuck into the ground continues to burn like a flambeaux; an
hole made beneath the ſurface of the earth, inſtantly becomes a furnace
anſwering all the purpoſes of a culinary fire. There they make lime by
merely burying the ſtones in the earth, and watch with veneration the
appearances of a flame that has not been extinguiſhed for times immemorial.
How different are men in various <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0823800101:108"/> climates! This deluded
people worſhip theſe vapours as a deity, which in other parts of the world
are conſidered as one of the greateſt evils.</p>

ſize, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged to many miles diſtance; ſo that the force of the
moſt powerful artillery, is but as a breeze agitating a feather in
compariſon. In the deluge of fire and melted matter which runs down the

con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. Thoſe rivers of liquid fire are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two hundred feet
deep; and, when they harden, frequently form conſiderable hills. Nor is the
danger of theſe confined to the eruption only: but the force of the internal
fire ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling for vent, frequently produces earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes through the whole
region where the volcano is ſituated. So dreadful have been theſe
appearances, that men's terrors have added new horrors to the ſcene, and they
have regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as prodigies, what we know to be the reſult of natural

               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0823800101:112"/>But if we regard this aſtoniſhing ſcene
of terror with a more tranquil and inquiſitive eye, we ſhall find that
theſe conflagrations are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by very obvious and natural cauſes. We
have already been apprized of the various mineral ſubſtances in the boſom
of the earth, and their aptneſs to burſt out into flames. Marcaſites and
pyrites, in particular, by being humefied with water, or air, contract this
heat, and often endeavour to expand with ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible exploſion.
Theſe, therefore, being lodged in the depths of the earth, or in the boſom
of mountains, and being either waſhed by the accidental influx of waters
below, or fanned by air, inſinuating itſelf through per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
fiſſures from above, take fire at firſt by only heaving in earthquakes,
but at length by burſting through every obſtacle, and making their dreadful
diſcharge in a volcano.</p>
            <p>Theſe volcanoes are found in all parts of the earth: in Europe
there are three that are very remarkable; Aetna in Sicily, Veſuvius in Italy,
and Hecla in Iceland. Aetna has been a volcano for ages immemorial. Its
eruptions are very violent, and its diſcharge has been known to cover the
earth ſixty-eight feet deep. In the year 1537, an eruption of this mountain
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an earthquake through the whole iſland, <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0823800101:113"/> for
twelve days, overturned many houſes, and at laſt formed a new aperture
which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed all within five leagues round. The cinders thrown up were
driven even into Italy, and its burnings were ſeen at Malta at the diſtance
of ſixty leagues. There is nothing more awful, ſays Kircher, than the
eruptions of this mountain, nor nothing more dangerous than attempting to
examine its appearances, even long after the eruption has ceaſed. As we
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to clamber up its ſteepy ſides, every ſtep we take upward, the
feet ſink back half way. Upon arriving near the ſummit, aſhes and ſnow,
with an ill aſſorted conjunction, preſent nothing but objects of
deſolation. Nor is this the worſt, for, as all places are covered over,
many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns are entirely hidden from the ſight, into which, if the enquirer
happens to fall, he ſinks to the bottom, and meets inevitable deſtruction.
Upon coming to the edge of the great crater, nothing can ſufficiently
repreſent the tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous magnificence of the ſcene. A gulph two miles
over, and ſo deep that no bottom can be ſeen; on the ſides pyramidical
rocks ſtarting out between apertures that emit ſmoke and flame; all this
accompanied with a ſound that never ceaſes, louder than thunder, ſtrikes
the bold with horror, and the religious with vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0823800101:114"/>
for him that has power to controle its burnings.</p>
            <p>In the deſcriptions of Veſuvius, or Hecla, we ſhall find
ſcarce any thing but a repetition of the ſame terrible objects, but rather
leſſened, as theſe mountains are not ſo large as the former. The crater
of Veſuvius is but a mile acroſs, according to the ſame author; whereas
that of Aetna is two. On this particular, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we muſt place no
dependance, as theſe caverns every day alter; being leſſened by the
mountains ſinking in at one eruption, and enlarged by the fury of another. It
is not one of the leaſt remarkable particulars reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Veſuvius, that
Pliny the naturaliſt was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated in one of its eruptions; for his
cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity impelling him too near, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf involved in ſmoke
and cinders when it was too late to retire; and his companions hardly eſcaped
to give an account of the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. It was in that dreadful eruption that
the city of Herculaneum was overwhelmed; the ruins of which have been lately
diſcovered at ſixty feet diſtance below the ſurface, and, what is
ſtill more remarkable, forty feet below the bed of the ſea. One of the
moſt remarkable erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this mountain was in the year 1707, which is
finely deſcribed by Valetta, a part of <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0823800101:115"/> whoſe
deſcription I ſhall beg leave to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"Towards the latter end of ſummer, in the year
1707, the mount Veſuvius, that had for a long time been ſilent, now began
to give ſome ſigns of commotion. Little more than inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal murmurs at
firſt were heard, that ſeemed to contend within the loweſt depths of the
mountain; no flame, nor even any ſmoak was as yet ſeen. Soon after ſome
ſmoak appeared by day, and a flame by night, which ſeemed to brighten all
the campania. At intervals alſo it ſhot off ſubſtances with a ſound
very like that of artillery, but which, even at ſo great a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as we
were at, infinitely exceeded them in greatneſs. Soon after it began to throw
up aſhes, which becoming the ſport of the winds, fell at great diſtances,
and ſome many miles. To this ſucceeded ſhowers of ſtones, which killed
many of the inhabitants of the valley, but made a dreadful ravage among the
cattle. Soon after a torrent of burning matter began to roll down the ſides
of the mountain, at firſt with a ſlow and gentle motion, but ſoon with
encreaſed celerity. The matter thus poured out, when cold, ſeemed, upon
inſpection, to be of vitrified earth, the whole united into a maſs of more
than ſtony hardneſs. But what <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0823800101:116"/> was particularly
obſervable was, that upon the whole ſurface of theſe melted materials, a
light ſpongy ſtone ſeemed to float, while the lower body was of the
hardeſt ſubſtance, of which our roads are uſually made. Hitherto there
were no appearances but what had been often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked before; but on the third
or fourth day, ſeeming flaſhes of lightening were ſhot forth from the
mouth of the mountain, with a noiſe far exceeding the loudeſt thunder.
Theſe flaſhes, in colour and brightneſs, reſembled what we uſually
ſee in tempeſts, but they aſſumed a more twiſted and ſerpentine
form. After this followed ſuch clouds of ſmoak and aſhes, that the whole
city of Naples, in the midſt of the day, was involved in nocturnal
darkneſs, and the neareſt friends were unable to diſtinguiſh each other
in this frightful gloom. If any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon attempted to ſtir out without
torch-light he was obliged to return, and every part of the city was filled
with ſupplications and terror; at length, after a continuance of ſome
hours, about one o'clock at midnight, the wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the north, the
ſtars began to be ſeen; the heavens, though it was night, began to grow
brighter; and the eruptions, after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of fifteen days, to
leſſen. The tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of melted matter was ſeen to extend from 
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0823800101:117"/> the mountain down to the ſhore; the people began to
return to their former dwellings, and the whole face of nature to reſume its
former appearance."</q>

                  </note>"In the year 1717, and the middle of April, with much
difficulty I reached the top of mount Veſuvius, in which I ſaw a vaſt
apperture full of ſmoak, which hindered me from ſeeing its depth and
figure. I heard within that horrid gulph cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain extraordinary ſounds, which
ſeemed to proceed from the bowels of the mountain, a ſort of murmuring,
ſighing, daſhing ſound, and between whiles a noiſe like that of thunder
or cannon, with a clattering like that of tiles falling from the tops of
houſes into the ſtreets. Sometimes, as the wind changed, the ſmoak grew
thinner, diſcovering a very ruddy flame, and the circumference of the crater
ſtreaked with red and ſeveral ſhades of yellow. After an hour's ſtay,
the ſmoak being moved by the wind, gave us ſhort and partial proſpects of
the great hollow; in the flat bottom of which I could diſcern two furnaces
almoſt contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; that on the left ſeeming about three yards 
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0823800101:118"/> over, glowing with ruddy flame, and throwing up red hot
ſtones, with an hideous noiſe, which, as they fell back, cauſed the
clattering already taken notice of. May 8, in the morning, I aſcended the top
of Veſuvius a ſecond time, and found a different face of things. The
ſmoak aſcending upright, gave a full proſpect of the crater, which, as I
could judge, was about a mile in circumference, and an hundred yards deep. A
conical mount had been formed ſince my laſt viſit in the middle of the
bottom, which I could ſee was made by the ſtones, thrown up and fallen back
again into the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In this new hill remained the two furnaces already
mentioned. The one was ſeen to throw up every three or four minutes, with a
dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſound, a vaſt number of red hot ſtones, at leaſt three
hundred feet higher than my head, as I ſtood upon the brink; but as there was
no wind, they fell perpendicularly back from whence they had been diſcharged.
The other was filled with red hot liquid matter, like that in the furnace of a
glaſs-houſe; raging and working like the waves of the ſea, with a ſhort
abrupt noiſe. This matter would ſometimes boil over, and run down the
ſide of the conical hill, appearing at firſt red hot, but changing colour
as it hardened and cooled. Had the <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0823800101:119"/> wind driven in our
faces, we had been in no ſmall danger of ſtifling by the ſulphureous
ſmoak, or being killed by the maſſes of melted minerals, that were ſhot
from the bottom. But as the wind was favourable, I had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of
ſurveying this amazing ſcene for above an hour and an half together. On the
fifth of June, after an horrid noiſe, the mountain was ſeen at Naples to
work over; and about three days after, its thunders were renewed ſo, that not
only the windows in the city, but all the houſes ſhook. From that time it
continued to overflow, and ſometimes at night were ſeen co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns of fire
ſhooting upward from its ſummit. On the tenth, when all was thought to be
over, the mountain again renewed its terrors, roaring and raging moſt
violently. One cannot form a juſter idea of the noiſe, in the moſt
violent fits of it, than by imagining a mixed ſound, made up of the raging of
a tempeſt, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur of a troubled ſea, and the roaring of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and
arillery, confuſed all together. Though we heard this at the diſtance of
twelve miles, yet it was very terrible. I therefore reſolved to approach
nearer to the mountain; and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, three or four of us got into a boat,
and were ſet aſhore at a little town, ſituated at the foot of the
mountain. From thence we rode <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0823800101:120"/> about four or five miles,
before we came to the torrent of fire that was deſcending from the ſide of
the volcano; and here the roaring grew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding loud and terrible as we
approached. I obſerved a mixture of colours in the cloud, above the crater,
green, yellow, red, blue. There was likewiſe a ruddy diſmal light in the
air, over that tract where the burning river flowed. Theſe circumſtances,
ſet off and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the horror of the night; made a ſcene the moſt
uncommon and aſtoniſhing I ever ſaw; which ſtill encreaſed as we
approached the burning river. Imagine a vaſt torrent of liquid fire, rolling
from the top, down the ſide of the mountain, and with irreſiſtible fury
bearing down and conſuming vines, olives, and houſes; and divided into
different channels, according to the inequalities of the mountain. The
largeſt ſtream ſeemed half a mile broad at leaſt, and five miles long.
I walked ſo far before my companions up the mountain, along the ſide of the
river of fire, that I was obliged to retire in great haſte, the ſulphureous
ſteam having ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized me, and almoſt taken away my breath. During our
return, which was about three o'clock in the morning, the roaring of the
mountain was heard all the way, while we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it throwing up huge
ſpouts of fire and <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0823800101:121"/> burning ſtones, which falling,
reſembled the ſtars in a rocket. Sometimes I obſerved two or three
diſtinct columns of flame, and ſometimes one only that was large enough to
fill the whole crater. Theſe burning columns, and fiery ſtones, ſeemed to
be ſhot a thouſand feet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular above the ſummit of the volcano:
and in this manner the mountain continued raging for ſix or eight days after.
On the eighteenth of the ſame month the whole appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ended, and the
mountain remained per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly quiet, without any viſible ſmoke or
flame."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The matter which is found to roll down from the mouth of all
volcanoes in general, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the droſs that is thrown from a ſmith's
forge. But it is different, perhaps, in various parts of the globe; for, as we
have already ſaid, there is not a quarter of the world that has not its
volcanoes. In Aſia, particularly in the iſlands of the Indian ocean, there
are many. One of the moſt famous is that of Albouras, near Mount Taurus, the
ſummit of which is continually on fire, and covers the whole ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
country with aſhes. In the iſland of Ternate there is a volcano, which
ſome tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers aſſert, burns moſt furiouſly in the times of the
equinoxes, becauſe of the winds which <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0823800101:122"/> then contribute
to encreaſe the flames. In the Molucca iſlands there are many burning
moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; they are alſo ſeen in Japan, and the iſlands adjacent; and in
Java and Sumatra, as well as in other of the Philippine iſlands. In Africa
there is a cavern, near Fez, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſends forth either ſmoke or
flames. In the Cape de Verde iſlands, one of them, called the Iſland del
Fuogo, continually burns; and the Portugueſe, who frequently attempted a
ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement there, have as often been obliged to deſiſt. The Peak of
Teneriffe is, as every body knows, a volcano that ſeldom deſiſts from
eruptions. But of all parts of the earth, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica is the place where thoſe
dreadful irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities of nature are the moſt conſpicuous. Veſuvius,
and Aetna itſelf, are but mere fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, in compariſon to the burning
moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Andes; which, as they are the higheſt mountains of the
world, ſo alſo are they the moſt formidable for their eruptions. The
mountain of Arequipa in Peru, is one of the moſt celebrated; Caraſſa, and
Malahallo, are very conſiderable; but that of Cotopaxi, in the province of
Quito, exceeds any thing we have hitherto read or heard of. The mountain of
Cotopaxi, as deſcribed by Ulloa<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ulloa, vol. i.

               </note>, is more <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0823800101:123"/> than three miles
perpendicular from the ſea; and it became a volcano at the time of the
Spaniards firſt arrival in that country. A new eruption of it happened in the
year 1743, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ſome days preceded by a continual roaring in its
bowels. The ſound of one of theſe mountains is not like that of the
vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canoes in Europe, confined to a province, but is heard at an hundred and
fifty miles diſtance<note n="*" place="bottom">

<q rend="inline">"An aperture was made in the ſummit of this
immenſe mountain; and three more about equal heights, near the middle of its
declivity, which was at that time buried under prodigious maſſes of ſnow.
The ignited ſubſtances ejected on that occaſion, mixed with a prodigious
quantity of ice and ſnow, melting amidſt the flames, were carried down with
ſuch aſtoniſhing rapidity, that in an inſtant the valley from Callo to
Lata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunga was overflowed; and beſides its ravages in bearing down the
houſes of the Indians, and other poor inhabitants, great numbers of people
loſt their lives. The river of Latacunga was the channel of this terrible
flood; till being too ſmall for receiving ſuch a prodigious current, it
overflowed the adjacent country, like a vaſt lake, near the town, and carried
away all the buildings within its reach. The inhabitants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired 
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0823800101:124"/> into a ſpot of higher ground behind the town, of which
thoſe parts which ſtood within the limits of the current were totally
deſtroyed. The dread of ſtill greater devaſtations did not ſubſide
for three days; during which, the vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano ejected cinders, while torrents of
melte ice and ſnow poured down its ſides. The erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laſted ſeveral
days, and was accompanied with terrible roarings of the wind, ruſhing through
the volcano ſtill louder than the former rumblings in its bowels. At laſt
all was quiet, neither fire nor ſmoke to be ſeen, nor noiſe to be heard;
till in the enſuing year, the flames again appeared with recruited violence,
forcing their paſſage through ſeveral other parts of the mountain, ſo
that in clear nights the flames being reflected by the tranſparent ice,
formed an awfully magnificent illumination."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such is the appearance and the effect of thoſe fires which proceed
from the more inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the earth; for that they generally come
from deeper regions than man has hitherto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored, I cannot avoid thinking,
contrary to the opinion of Mr. Buffon, who ſuppoſes them rooted but a very
little way below the bed of the mountain. We can never ſuppoſe, ſays this
great naturaliſt, that theſe ſubſtances are ejected 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0823800101:125"/> from any great diſtance below, if we only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the great force already required to fling them up to ſuch vaſt heights
above the mouth of the mountain; if we conſider the ſubſtances thrown up,
which we ſhall find upon inſpection to be the ſame with thoſe of the
mountain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; if we take into our conſideration, that air is always
neceſſary to keep up the flame; but, moſt of all, if we attend to one
circumſtance, which is, that if theſe ſubſtances were exploded from a
vaſt depth below, the ſame force required to ſhoot them up ſo high,
would act againſt the ſides of the volcano, and tear the whole moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in
pieces. To all this ſpecious reaſoning, particular anſwers might eaſily
be given; as that the length of the funnel encreaſes the force of the
exploſion; that the ſides of the funnel are actually often burſt with the
great violence of the flame; that air may be ſuppoſed at depths at leaſt
as far as the perpendicular fiſſures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend. But the beſt anſwer is
a well-known fact; namely, that the quantity of matter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from Aetna
alone, is ſuppoſed, upon a moderate computation, to exceed twenty times the
original bulk of the mountain<note n="*" place="bottom">

what is ſtill more remarkable, the walls of theſe very houſes have been
built of materials evidently thrown up by the mountain. The inference from all
this is very obvious; that the matter thus exploded cannot belong to the

            <p>HAVING given the theory of volcanoes, we have in ſome meaſure
given alſo that of earthquakes. They both ſeem to proceed from the ſame
cauſe, only with this difference, that the fury of the volcano is ſpent in
the eruption, that of an earthquake ſpreads wider and acts more fatally by
being confined. The volcano only affrights a province, earthquakes have laid
whole kingdoms in ruin.</p>
            <p>Philoſophers<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ariſtotle,

between the various kinds of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, ſuch as the tremulous, the
pulſative, the perpendicular, and the inclined; but theſe are rather the
diſtinctions of art than of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, mere accidental differences ariſing
from the ſituation of the country or of the cauſe. If, for inſtance, the
confined fire acts directly under a province or a town, it will heave the earth
perpendicularly upward, and produce a <hi>perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular</hi> earthquake. If it
acts at a diſtance, it <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0823800101:128"/> will raiſe that tract
obliquely, and thus the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants will perceive an <hi>inclined</hi>
one.</p>
            <p>Nor does it ſeem to me that there is much greater reaſon for Mr.
Buffon's diſtinction of earthquakes. One kind of which he ſuppoſes<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. ii. 328.</bibl>
               </note> to be produced by fire
in the manner of vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canoes, and confined to but a very narrow cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference.
The other kind he aſcribes to the ſtruggles of confined air, expanded by
heat in the bowels of the earth, and endeavouring to get free. For how do
theſe two cauſes dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer? Fire is an agent of no power whatſoever without
air. It is the air, which being at firſt compreſt, and then dilated in a
cannon, that drives the ball with ſuch force. It is the air ſtruggling for
vent in a volcano, that throws up its contents to ſuch vaſt heights. In
ſhort, it is the air confined in the bowels of the earth, and acquiring
elaſticity by heat, that produces all thoſe appearances which are generally
aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the operation of fire. When, therefore, we are told that there
are two cauſes of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, we only learn, that a greater or ſmaller
quantity of heat produces thoſe terrible effects; for air is the only active
operator in either.</p>
            <p>Some philoſophers, however, have been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give the air as
great a ſhare in produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0823800101:129"/> theſe terrible efforts
as they could; and magnifying its powers have called in but a very moderate
degree of heat to put it in action. Although experience tells us that the earth
is full of inflamable materials, and that fires are produced wherever we
deſcend; although it tells us that thoſe countries, where there are
volcanoes, are moſt ſubject to earthquakes, yet they ſtep out of the way,
and ſo find a new ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Theſe only allow but juſt heat enough to
produce the moſt dreadful phoenomena, and backing their aſſertions with
long calculations, give theory an air of demonſtration. Mr. Amontons<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Memoires de l' Accademie de Sciences, An.
1703.</bibl>
               </note> has been particularly ſparing of the internal heat in
this reſpect; and has ſhewn, perhaps accurately enough, that a very
mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate degree of heat may ſuffice to give the air amazing powers of
expanſion.</p>
            <p>It is amazing enough, however, to trace the progreſs of a
philoſophical fancy let looſe in immaginary ſpeculations. They run thus: 
<q rend="inline">"A very moderate degree of heat may bring the air
into a condition capable of producing earthquakes; for the air at the depth of
forty-three thouſand five hundred and twenty-eight fathom below the ſurface
of the earth, becomes almoſt as heavy as quick-ſilver. 
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0823800101:130"/> This, however, is but a very ſlight depth in
compariſon of the diſtance to the center, and is ſcarce a ſeventieth
part of the way. The air, therefore, at the center muſt be infinitely heavier
than mercury, or any body that we know of. This granted, we ſhall take
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, and ſay, that it is very probable there is nothing but air
at the center. Now let us ſuppoſe this air heated, by ſome means, even to
the degree of boiling water, as we have proved that the denſity of the air is
here very great, its elaſticity muſt be in proportion: an heat, therefore,
which at the ſurface of the earth would have produced but a ſlight
expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive force, muſt at the center produce one very extraordinary, and,
in ſhort, be perfectly irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible. Hence this force may with great
eaſe produce earthquakes; and if encreaſed it may convulſe the globe; it
may (by only adding figures enough to the calculation) deſtroy the ſolar
ſyſtem, and even the fixed ſtars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves."</q> Theſe reveries
generally produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for, as I have ever obſerved, encreaſed
calculations, while they ſeem to tire the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, give the reaſoning
faculty perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>However, as earthquakes are the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable miniſters of
nature, it is not to be <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0823800101:131"/> wondered that a multitude of
writers have been curiouſly employed in their conſideration. Woodward has
aſcribed the cauſe to a ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of the waters below the earth's
ſurface by ſome accident. Theſe being thus accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and yet acted
upon by fires, which he ſuppoſes ſtill deeper, both contribute to heave
up the earth upon their boſom. This he thinks accounts for the lakes of water
produced in an earthquake, as well as for the fires that ſometimes burſt
from the earth's ſurface upon thoſe dreadful occaſions. There are others
ſtill who have ſuppoſed that the earth may be itſelf the cauſe of its
own convulſions. When, ſay they, the roots or baſis of ſome large tract
is worn away by a fluid underneath, the earth ſinking therein, its weight
occaſions a tremor of the adjacent parts, ſometimes produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a noiſe,
and ſometimes an inundation of water. Not to tire the reader with an
hiſtory of opinions inſtead of facts, ſome have aſcribed them to
electricity, and ſome to the ſame cauſes that produce thunder.</p>
            <p>It would be tedious, therefore, to give all the various opinions
that have employed the ſpeculative upon this ſubject. The activity of the
internal heat ſeems alone ſufficient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for every appearance that
attends theſe <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0823800101:132"/> tremendous irregularities of nature. To
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this diſtinctly, let us ſuppoſe at ſome vaſt diſtance
under the earth, large quantities of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamable matter, pyrites, bitumens, and
mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſites diſpoſed, and only waiting for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion of water,
or the humidity of the air, to put their fires in motion: at laſt, this
dreadful mixture arrives; waters find their way into thoſe depths, through
the perpendicular fiſſures; or air inſinuates itſelf through the ſame
minute apertures: ſtrait new appearances enſue: thoſe ſubſtances,
which for ages before lay dormant, now conceive new apparent qualities; they
grow hot, produce new air, and only want room for expanſion. However, the
narrow apertures by which the air or water had at firſt admiſſion, are
now cloſed up; yet as new air is continually generated, and as the heat every
moment gives this air new elaſticity, it at length burſts, and dilates all
round; and, in its ſtruggles to get free, throws all above it into ſimilar
convulſions. Thus an earthquake is produced, more or leſs extenſive,
according to the depth or the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the cauſe.</p>
            <p>But before we proceed with the cauſes, let us take a ſhort view
of the appearances which have attended the moſt remarkable earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes. By
theſe we ſhall ſee how far the <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0823800101:133"/> theoriſt
correſponds with the hiſtorian. The greateſt we find in antiquity, is
that mentioned by Pliny<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Plin. lib. ii. cap.
86.</bibl>
               </note>, in which twelve cities in Aſia Minor were ſwallowed up
in one night: he tells us alſo of another, near the lake Thraſymene, which
was not perceived by the armies of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians and Romans, that were
then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged near that lake, although it ſhook the greateſt part of Italy.
In another place<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ibid. lib. iii. cap.
85.</bibl>
               </note> he gives the following account of an earthquake of an
extraordinary kind. 
<q rend="inline">"When Lucius Marcus, and Sextus Julius, were
conſuls, there appeared a very ſtrange prodigy of the earth, (as I have
read in the books of Aetruſcan diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline) which happened in the province
of Mutina. Two mountains ſhocked againſt each other, approaching and
retiring with the moſt dreadful noiſe. They, at the ſame time, and in the
midſt of the day, appeared to caſt forth fire and ſmoke, while a vaſt
number of Roman knights and travellers from the Aemilian way, ſtood and
continued amazed ſpectators. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral towns were deſtroyed by this ſhock;
and all the animals that were near them were killed."</q> In the times of
Trajan, the city of Antioch, and a great part of the adjacent country, was
buried by an earthquake. About <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0823800101:134"/> three hundred years
after, in the times of Juſtinian, it was once more deſtroyed, together with
forty thouſand inhabitants: and, after an interval of ſixty years, the
ſame ill-fated city was a third time overturned, with the loſs of not
leſs than ſixty thouſand ſouls. In the year 1182, moſt of the cities
of Syria, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Jeruſalem, were deſtroyed by the ſame
accident. In the year 1594, the Italian hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians deſcribe an earthquake
at Puteoli, which cauſed the ſea to retire two hundred yards from its
former bed.</p>
            <p>But one of thoſe moſt particularly deſcribed in hiſtory, is
that of the year 1693; the damages of which were chiefly felt in Sicily, but
its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perceived in Germany, France, and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. It extended to a
circumference of two thouſand ſix hundred leagues; chiefly affecting the
ſea-coaſts, and great rivers; more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable alſo upon the mountains
than in the valleys. Its motions were ſo rapid, that thoſe who lay at their
length, were toſſed from ſide to ſide, as upon a rolling billow<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Phil. Tranſ.</bibl>
               </note>. The walls were daſhed
from their foundations; and no leſs than fifty-four cities, with an
incredible num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of villages, were either deſtroyed or greatly damaged. The
city of Catanea, in particular, <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0823800101:135"/> was utterly overthrown.
A traveller, who was on his way thither, at the diſtance of ſome miles,
perceived a black cloud, like night, hanging over the place. The ſea, all of
a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, began to roar; Mount Aetna to ſend forth great ſpires of
flame; and ſoon after a ſhock en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, with a noiſe as if all the
artillery in the world had been at once diſcharged. Our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, being
obliged to alight inſtantly, felt himſelf raiſed a foot from the ground;
and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes to the city, he with amazement ſaw nothing but a thick
cloud of duſt in the air. The birds flew about aſtoniſhed; the ſun was
darkened; the beaſts ran howling from the hills; and, although the ſhock
did not continue above three minutes, yet near nineteen thouſand of the
inhabitants of Sicily periſhed in the ruins. Catanea, to which city the
deſcriber was tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, ſeemed the principal ſcene of ruin; its place
only was to be found; and not a footſtep of its former magnificence was to be
ſeen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining.</p>
            <p>The earthquake which happened in Jamaica, in 1692, was very
terrible, and its deſcription ſufficiently minute. 
<q rend="inline">"In two minutes time it deſtroyed the town of
Portugal, and ſunk the houſes in a gulph forty fathoms deep. It was
attended with an hollow rumbling noiſe, like <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0823800101:136"/> that of
thunder; and, in leſs than a minute, three parts of the houſes, and their
inhabitants, were all ſunk quite under water. While they were thus
ſwallowed up on one ſide of the ſtreet, on the other, the houſes were
thrown into heaps; the ſand of the ſtreet riſing like the waves of the
ſea, lifting up thoſe that ſtood upon it, and immediately overwhelming
them in pits. All the wells diſcharged their waters with the moſt vehement
agitation. The ſea felt an equal ſhare of turbulence, and, burſting over
its mounds, deluged all that came in its way. The fiſſures of the earth
were, in ſome places, ſo great, that one of the ſtreets appeared twice as
broad as formerly. In many places, however, it opened and cloſed again, and
continued this agitation for ſome time. Of theſe openings, two or three
hundred might be ſeen at a time; in ſome whereof the people were
ſwallowed up; in others, the earth cloſing, caught them by the middle, and
thus cruſhed them inſtantly to death. Other openings, ſtill more dreadful
than the reſt, ſwallowed up whole ſtreets; and others, more formidable
ſtill, ſpouted up whole cataracts of water, drowning ſuch as the
earthquake had ſpared. The whole was attended with the moſt noiſome
ſtench; while the thundering of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant falling mountains, the whole
ſky overcaſt <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0823800101:137"/> with a duſky gloom, and the cruſh
of falling ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, gave unſpeakable horror to the ſcene. After this
dreadful calamity was over, the whole iſland ſeemed converted into a
ſcene of deſolation; ſcarce a planter's houſe was left ſtanding;
almoſt all were ſwallowed up; houſes, people, trees, ſhared one
univerſal ruin; and, in their places appeared great pools of water, which,
when dried up by the ſun, left only a plain of barren ſand, without any
veſtige of former inhabitants. Moſt of the rivers, during the earthquake,
were ſtopt up by the falling in of the mountains; and it was not till after
ſome time that they made themſelves new channels. The mountains ſeemed
particularly attacked by the force of the ſhock; and it was ſuppoſed that
the principal ſeat of the concuſſion was among them. Thoſe who were
ſaved, got on board ſhips in the harbour; where many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained above two
months, the ſhocks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing during that interval with more or leſs
violence every day."</q>
            </p>
            <p>As this deſcription ſeems to exhibit all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances that
uſually make up the catalogue of terrors belonging to an earthquake, I will
ſuppreſs the detail of that which happened at Liſbon, in our own times,
and which is too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to require a deſcription. In fact, there are 
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0823800101:138"/> few particulars in the accounts of thoſe who were
preſent at that ſcene of deſolation, that we have not more minutely and
accurately tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us by former writers, whoſe nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives I have
for that reaſon preferred. I will, therefore, cloſe this deſcription of
human cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, with the account of the dreadful earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake at Calabria, in
1638. It is related by the celebrated Father Kircher, as it happened while he
was on his journey to viſit Mount Aetna, and the reſt of the wonders that
lie towards the ſouth of Italy. I need ſcarce inform the reader that
Kircher is conſidered, by ſcholars, as one of the greateſt prodigies of
learning.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"Having hired a boat, in company with four more, two
friars of the order of St. Francis, and two ſeculars, we launched, on the
twenty-fourth of March, from the harbour of Meſſina, in Sicily, and
arrived, the ſame day, at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory of Pelorus. Our deſtination was
for the city of Euphaemia, in Calabria, where we had ſome buſineſs to
tranſact, and where we deſigned to tarry for ſome time. However,
Providence ſeemed willing to croſs our deſign; for we were obliged to
continue for three days at Pelorus, upon account of the weather; and though we
often put out to ſea, yet we were as often driven back. At length, however,
wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0823800101:139"/> with the delay, we reſolved to proſecute
our voyage; and, although the ſea ſeemed more than uſually agitated, yet
we ventured forward. The gulph of Charybdis, which we approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeemed
whirled round in ſuch a manner as to form a vaſt hollow, verging to a point
in the center. Proceeding onward, and turning my eyes to Aetna, I ſaw it
caſt forth large volumes of ſmoke, of mountainous ſizes, which entirely
covered the whole iſland, and blotted out the very ſhores from my view.
This, together with the dreadful noiſe, and the ſulphureous ſtench, which
was ſtrongly perceived, filled me with apprehenſions that ſome more
dreadful cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity was impending. The ſea itſelf ſeemed to wear a very
unuſual appearance; thoſe who have ſeen a lake in a violent ſhower of
rain co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all over with bubbles, will conceive ſome idea of its
agitations. My ſurprize was ſtill encreaſed by the calmneſs and
ſerenity of the weather; not a breeze, not a cloud which might be
ſuppoſed to put all Nature thus into motion. I therefore warned my
companions that an earthquake was approaching; and, after ſome time, making
for the ſhore with all poſſible diligence, we landed at Tropaea, happy
and thankful for having eſcaped the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dangers of the ſea. 
<p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0823800101:140"/>"But our triumphs at land were of ſhort
du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for we had ſcarce arrived at the Jeſuits College in that city,
when our ears were ſtunned with an horrid ſound, reſembling that of an
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of chariots driven fiercely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the wheels rattling, and
the thongs cracking. Soon after this, a moſt dreadful earthquake enſued;
ſo that the whole tract upon which we ſtood, ſeemed to vibrate, as if we
were in the ſcale of a balance that continued wavering. This motion, however,
ſoon grew more violent; and being no longer able to keep my legs, I was
thrown proſtrate upon the ground. In the mean time, the univerſal ruin
round me, redoubled my amazement. The craſh of falling houſes, the
tottering of towers, and the groans of the dying, all contributed to raiſe my
terror and deſpair. On every ſide of me I ſaw nothing but a ſcene of
ruin; and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger threatening wherever I ſhould fly. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended myſelf to
God as my laſt great refuge. At that hour, O how vain was every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary
happineſs! wealth, honour, empire, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, all mere uſeleſs ſounds,
and as empty as the bubbles in the deep. Juſt ſtanding on the threſhold
of eternity, nothing but God was my pleaſure; and the nearer I approached, I
only loved him the more. After ſome time, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0823800101:141"/>
finding that I remained unhurt, amidſt the general concuſſion, I
reſolved to venture for ſafety, and running as faſt as I could, reached
the ſhore, but almoſt terrified out of my reaſon. I did not ſearch long
here till I found the boat in which I had landed, and my companions alſo,
whoſe terrors were even greater than mine. Our meeting was not of that kind
where every one is deſirous of telling his own happy eſcape; it was all
ſilence, and a gloomy dread of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending terrors.</p> 
                  <p>"Leaving this ſeat of deſolation, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted our
voyage along the coaſts; and the next day came to Rochetta, where we landed,
although the earth ſtill continued in violent agitations. But we were
ſcarce arrived at our inn, when we were once more obliged to return to the
boat; and, in about half an hour, we ſaw the greateſt part of the town, and
the inn at which we had ſet up, daſhed to the ground, and burying all its
inhabitants beneath its ruins.</p> 
                  <p>"In this manner, proceeding onward in our little veſſel,
finding no ſafety at land, and yet, from the ſmallneſs of our boat,
having but a very dangerous continuance at ſea, we at length landed at
Lopizium, a caſtle midway between Tropaea and Euphemia, the city to which, as
I <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0823800101:142"/> ſaid before, we were bound. Here, wherever I turned
my eyes, nothing but ſcenes of ruin and horror appeared; towns and caſtles
levelled to the ground; Strombalo, though at ſixty miles diſtance, belching
forth flames in an unuſual manner, and with a noiſe which I could
diſtinctly hear. But my attention was quickly turned from more remote to
contiguous danger. The rumbling ſound of an approaching earthquake, which we
by this time were grown acquainted with, alarmed us for the conſequences; it
every moment ſeemed to grow louder, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach more near. The place on
which we ſtood now began to ſhake moſt dreadfully, ſo that being unable
to ſtand, my companions and I caught hold of whatever ſhrub grew next us,
and ſupported ourſelves in that manner.</p> 
                  <p>"After ſome time, this violent paroxyſm ceaſing, we again
ſtood up, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute our voyage to Euphaemia, that lay within
ſight. In the mean time, while we were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for this purpoſe, I
turned my eyes towards the city, but could ſee only a frightful dark cloud,
that ſeemed to reſt upon the place. This the more ſurprized us, as the
weather was ſo very ſerene. We waited, therefore, till the cloud was paſt
away: then turning to look for the city, it was totally ſunk. Wonderful to
tell! <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0823800101:143"/> nothing but a diſmal and putrid lake was ſeen
where it ſtood. We looked about to find ſome one that could tell us of its
ſad cataſtrophe, but could ſee none. All was become a melancholy
ſolitude; a ſcene of hideous deſolation. Thus proceeding penſively
along, in queſt of ſome human being that could give us ſome little
information, we at length ſaw a boy ſitting by the ſhore, and appearing
ſtupified with terror. Of him, therefore, we enquired concerning the fate of
the city; but he could be got to give us no anſwer. We entreated him with
every expreſſion of tenderneſs and pity to tell us; but his ſenſes
were quite wrapt up in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the danger he had eſcaped. We
offered him ſome victuals, but he ſeemed to loath the ſight. We ſtill
perſiſted in our offices of kindneſs; but he only pointed to the place of
the city, like one out of his ſenſes; and then running up into the woods,
was never heard of after. Such was the fate of the city of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaemia: and as
we continued our melancholy courſe along the ſhore, the whole coaſt, for
the ſpace of two hundred miles, preſented nothing but the remains of
cities; and men ſcattered, without an habitation, over the fields.
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding thus along, we at length ended our diſtreſsful voyage by
arriving at Naples, after <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0823800101:144"/> having eſcaped a thouſand
dangers both at ſea and land."</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The reader, I hope, will excuſe me for this long tranſlation
from a favourite writer, and that the ſooner, as it contains ſome
particulars relative' to earthquakes not to be found elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. From the
whole of theſe accounts we may gather, that the moſt concomitant
cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are theſe:</p>
            <p>A rumbling ſound before the earthquake. This proceeds from the
air, or fire, or both, forcing their way through the chaſms of the earth, and
endeavouring to get free, which is alſo heard in volcanoes.</p>
            <p>A violent agitation, or heaving of the ſea, ſometimes before and
ſometimes after that at land. This agitation is only a ſimilar effect
produced on the waters with that at land, and may be called, for the ſake of
perſpicuity, a ſea-quake; and this, alſo, is produced by vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canoes.</p>
            <p>A ſpouting up of waters to great heights. It is not eaſy to
deſcribe the manner in which this is performed; but volcanoes alſo perform
the ſame, Veſuvius being known frequently to eject a vaſt body of
waters.</p>
            <p>A rocking of the earth to and fro, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a perpendicular
bouncing, if it may be <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0823800101:145"/> ſo called, of the ſame. This
difference chiefly ariſes from the ſituation of the place with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the ſubterranean fire. Directly under, it lifts; at a farther diſtance,
it rocks.</p>
            <p>Some earthquakes ſeem to travel onward, and are felt in different
countries at different hours the ſame day. This ariſes from the great
ſhock being given to the earth at one place, and that being communicated
onward by an undulatory motion, ſucceſſively affects different regions in
its progreſs. As the blow given by a ſtone falling in a lake is not
perceived at the ſhores till ſome time after the firſt
concuſſion.</p>
            <p>The ſhock is ſometimes inſtantaneous, like the exploſion of
gunpowder; and ſometimes tremulous, and continuing for ſeveral minutes. The
nearer the place where the ſhock is firſt given, the more inſtantaneous
and ſimple it appears. At a greater diſtance the earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubles the
firſt blow with a ſort of vibratory continuation.</p>
            <p>As waters have generally ſo great a ſhare in producing
earthquakes, it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that they ſhould generally follow
thoſe breaches made by the force of fire, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the great chaſms
which the earthquake has opened.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the moſt remarkable <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0823800101:146"/>
phoenomena of earthquakes, preſenting a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſſemblage of the
moſt terrible effects of air, earth, fire, and water.</p>
            <p>The valley of Solfatara, near Naples, ſeems to exhibit, in a
minuter degree, whatever is ſeen of this horrible kind on the great theatre
of Nature. This plain, which is about twelve hundred feet long, and a
thouſand broad, is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſomed in mountains, and has in the middle of it a
lake of noiſome blackiſh water, covered with a bitumen, that floats upon
its ſurface. In every part of this plain, caverns appear ſmoking with
ſulphur, and often emitting flames. The earth, wherever we walk over it,
trembles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the feet. Noiſes of flames, and the hiſſing of waters,
are heard at the bottom. The water ſometimes ſpouts up eight or ten feet
high. The moſt noiſome fumes, foetid water, and ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous vapours,
offend the ſmell. A ſtone thrown into any of the caverns, is ejected again
with conſiderable violence. Theſe appearances gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prevail when the
ſea is any way diſturbed; and the whole ſeems to exhibit the appearance
of an earthquake in miniature. However, in this ſmaller ſcene of wonders,
as well as in the greater, there are many appearances for which perhaps we
ſhall never account; and many queſtions may be aſked, which no
conjectures <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0823800101:147"/> can thoroughly reſolve. It was the fault
of the philoſophers of the laſt age, to be more inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive after the
cauſes of things, than after the things themſelves. They ſeemed to think
that a confeſſion of ignorance cancelled their claims to wiſdom: they,
therefore, had a ſolution for every demand. But the preſent age has grown,
if not more inquiſitive, at leaſt more modeſt; and none are now aſhamed
of that ignorance which labour can neither remedy nor remove.</p>

            <p>HITHERTO we have taken a ſurvey only of the evils which are
produced by ſubterranean fires, but we have mentioned nothing of the
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits they may poſſibly produce. They may be of uſe in warming and
cheriſhing the ground, in promoting vegetation, and giving a more
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite flavour to the productions of the earth. The imagination of a
perſon who has never been out of our own mild region, can ſcarcely reach to
that luxuriant beauty with which all Nature appears cloathed in thoſe very
countries that we <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0823800101:148"/> have but juſt now deſcribed as
deſolated by earthquakes, and undermined by ſubterranean fires. It muſt
be granted, therefore, that though in thoſe regions they have a greater

of Nature.</p>
            <p>But there is another advantage ariſing from ſubterranean fires,
which, though hitherto diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded by man, yet may one day become
ſerviceable to him; I mean, that while they are found to ſwallow up cities

iſlands in another. We have many inſtances of iſlands being thus formed

afterwards become fruitful ſeats of happineſs and induſtry.</p>
            <p>New iſlands are formed in two ways; either ſuddenly, by the

mariners, as they were employed in <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0823800101:149"/> another purſuit.
Pliny aſſures us, that thirteen iſlands in the Mediterranean appeared at
once emerging from the water; the cauſe of which he aſcribes rather to the
retiring of the ſea in thoſe parts, than to any ſubterraneous elevation.
However, he mentions the iſland of Hiera, near that of Theraſia, as formed
by ſubterraneous exploſions; and adds to his liſt ſeveral others,
formed in the ſame manner. In one of which he relates that fiſh in great
abundance were found, and that all thoſe who eat of them died ſhortly
after.</p>

year 1707, a ſlight earthquake was perceived at Santorin; and the day
following, at ſun-riſing, an object was ſeen by the inhabitants of that
iſland, at two or three miles diſtance at ſea, which appeared like a
floating rock. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, deſirous either of gain, or incited by
cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, went there, and found, even while they ſtood upon this rock,
that it ſeemed to riſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath their feet. They perceived alſo, that its
ſurface was covered with pumice ſtones, and oyſters, which it had
raiſed from the bottom. Every day after, until the fourteenth of June, this
rock ſeemed conſiderably to encreaſe; and then was found to be half a
mile round, and <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0823800101:150"/> about thirty feet above the ſea. The
earth of which it was compoſed, ſeemed whitiſh, with a ſmall portion of
clay. Soon after this the ſea again appeared troubled, and ſteams aroſe,
which were very offenſive to the inhabitants of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torin. But on the
ſixteenth of the ſucceeding month, ſeventeen or eighteen rocks more were
ſeen to riſe out of the ſea, and at length to join together. All this was
accompanied with the moſt terrible noiſe, and fires that proceeded from the
iſland that was newly formed. The whole maſs, however, of all this
new-formed earth, uniting, encreaſed every day, both in height and breadth,
and, by the force of its exploſions, caſt forth rocks to ſeven miles
diſtance. This continued to bear the ſame dreadful appearances till the

riſing up by its ſide, and joining to it, ſo as ſcarce at preſent to

            <p>A new iſland was formed, in the year 1720, near that of Tercera,
near the continent of Africa, by the ſame cauſes. In the beginning of
December, at night, there was a terrible earthquake at that place, and the top
of a new iſland appeared, which caſt forth ſmoke in vaſt quantities.
The pilot of a ſhip, who approached it, ſounded on one ſide of this
iſland, and could not find ground at ſixty fathom. At the other ſide the
ſea was totally tinged of a different colour, exhibiting a mixture of white,
blue, and green; and was very ſhallow. This iſland, on its firſt
appearance, was larger than it is at preſent; for it has, ſince that time,
ſunk in ſuch a manner, as to be ſcarce above water.</p>

earthquakes in general. We are not more to be ſurprized that inflammable
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhould be found beneath the bottom of the ſea, than at
ſimilar depths at land. Theſe <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0823800101:153"/> have all the force of
fire giving expanſion to air, and tending to raiſe the earth at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the ſea, till it at length heaves above water. Theſe marine volcanoes
are not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; for, if we may judge of the uſual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure of
Nature, it muſt very often happen that, before the bottom of the ſea is
elevated above the ſurface, a chaſm is opened in it, and then the water
preſſing in, extinguiſhes the vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano before it has time to produce its
effects. This extinction, however, is not effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very great
reſiſtance from the fire beneath. The water, upon daſhing into the

ſome of thoſe amazing water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouts are ſeen, which have ſo often
aſtoniſhed the mariner, and excited curioſity.—But of theſe in

            <p>Beſides the production of thoſe iſlands by the action of fire,
there are others, as was ſaid, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by rivers or ſeas carrying mud,
earth, and ſuch like ſubſtances, along with their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and at
laſt depoſiting them in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place. At the mouths of moſt
great rivers, there are to be ſeen banks, thus formed by the ſand and mud
carried down with the ſtream, which have reſted at that place, where the
force of the current is diminiſhed by its junction with the ſea. Theſe
banks, by ſlow <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0823800101:154"/> degrees, encreaſe at the bottom of
the deep; the water, in thoſe places, is at firſt found by mariners to grow
more ſhallow; the bank ſoon heaves up above the ſurface; it is
conſidered, for a while, as a tract of uſeleſs and barren ſand; but the
ſeeds of ſome of the more hardy vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables are driven thither by the wind,
they take root, and thus binding the ſandy ſurface, the whole ſpot is
cloathed in time with a beautiful verdure. In this manner there are delightful
and inhabited iſlands at the mouths of many rivers, particularly the Nile,
the Po, the Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi, the Ganges, and the Senegal. There has been, in
the memory of man, a beautiful and large iſland formed in this manner, at the
mouth of the river Nanquin, in China, made from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of mud at its
opening: it is not leſs than ſixty miles long, and about twenty broad. La

began its appearance at low water, for the ſpace of a few hours; and was
buried again till the next tide's retreat. Thus, ſucceſſively, it lived
and died, until the year 1666, when it began to maintain its ground againſt
the inſult of the waves; and then firſt invited the aid of human
induſtry. A bank was thrown about its riſing grounds; and being thus
defended from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of the ſea, it became firm and ſolid, and,
in a ſhort time, afforded good paſturage for cattle. It is about nine miles
in circumference, and is worth to the proprietor about eight hundred pounds a
year."</q> It would be endleſs to mention all the iſlands that have been
thus formed; and the advantages that have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from them. However, it
is frequently found, that new iſlands thus formed, may often be conſidered
as only turning the rivers from their former beds; ſo that, in proportion as
land is gained at one part, it is loſt by the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome
other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0823800101:156"/>Little, therefore, is gained by ſuch
acceſſions. Nor is there much more by the new iſlands which are
ſometimes formed from the ſpoils of the continent. Mariners aſſure us,
that there are ſometimes whole plains unrooted from the main lands, by floods
and tempeſts. Theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried out to ſea, with all their trees and
animals upon them, are frequently ſeen float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ocean, and exhibiting
a ſurprizing appearance of rural tranquillity in the midſt of danger. The
greateſt part, however, having the earth at their roots at length waſhed
away, are diſperſed, and their animals drowned; but now and then ſome are
found to brave the fury of the ocean, till being ſtuck either among rocks or
ſands, they again take firm footing, and become permanent iſlands.</p>
            <p>As different cauſes have thus concurred to produce new iſlands,
ſo we have accounts of others that the ſame cauſes have contributed to
deſtroy. We have already ſeen the power of earthquakes exerted in ſinking
whole cities, and leaving lakes in their room. There have been iſlands, and
regions alſo, that have ſhared the ſame fate; and have ſunk with their
inhabitants, never more to be heard of. Thus Pauſanias<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Pauſanias, I.8, in Arcad. p. 509.</bibl>
               </note> tells us
of an iſland, called Chryſes, that was <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0823800101:157"/> ſunk near
Lemnos. Pliny mentions ſeveral; among others, the iſland Cea, for thirty
miles, having been waſhed away, with ſeveral thouſands of its
inhabitants. But of all the noted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations of this kind, the total
ſubmerſion of the iſland of Atalantis, as mentioned by Plato, has been
moſt the ſubject of ſpeculation. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in general, now conſider the
whole of his account as an ingenious fable; but when fables are grown famous by
time and authority, they become an agreeable, if not a neceſſary part of
literary information.</p>
            <p>About nine thouſand years are paſſed, ſays Plato<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Plato in Critia.</bibl>
               </note>, ſince the iſland of
Atalantis was in being. The prieſts of Egypt were well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it;
and the firſt heroes of Athens gained much glory in their wars with the
inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. This iſland was as large as Aſia Minor and Syria united; and
was ſituated beyond the pillars of Hercules, in the Atlantic ocean. The
beauty of the buildings, and the fertility of the ſoil, were far beyond any
thing a modern ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination can conceive; gold and ivory were every where
common; and the fruits of the earth offered themſelves without cultivation.
The arts, and the courage of the inhabitants, were not inferior to the
happineſs of their ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0823800101:158"/> and they were
frequently known to make conqueſts, and overrun the continent of Europe and
Aſia. The imagination of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical philoſopher riots in the
deſcription of the natural and acquired advantages, which they long enjoyed
in this charming region. If, ſays he, we compare that country to our own,
ours will appear a mere waſted ſkeleton, when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to it. Their
mountains to the very tops were cloathed with fertility, and poured down rivers
to enrich the plains below.</p>
            <p>However, all theſe beauties and benefits were deſtroyed in one
day by an earthquake ſinking the earth, and the ſea overwhelming it. At
preſent, not the ſmalleſt veſtiges of ſuch an iſland are to be
found; Plato remains as the only authority for its exiſtence; and
philoſophers diſpute about its ſituation. It is not for me to enter into
the controverſy, when there appears but little probability to ſupport the
fact; and, indeed, it would be uſeleſs to run back nine thouſand years in
ſearch of difficulties, as we are ſurrounded with objects that more
cloſely affect us, and that demand admiration at our very doors. When I
conſider, as Lactantius ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, the various viciſſitudes of
nature; lands ſwallowed by yawning earthquakes, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in the deep;
rivers and lakes diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0823800101:159"/> or dried away;
mountains levelled into plains; and plains ſwelling up into moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; I
cannot help regarding this earth as a place of very little ſtability; as a
tranſient abode of ſtill more tranſitory beings.</p>

            <p>HAVING at laſt, in ſome meaſure, emerged from the deeps of the
earth, we come to a ſcene of greater ſplendour; the contemplation of its
external appearance. In this ſurvey, its moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are the firſt objects
that ſtrike the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and excite our curioſity. There is not,
perhaps, any thing in all nature that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes an unaccuſtomed
ſpectator with ſuch ideas of awful ſolemnity, as theſe immenſe piles
of Nature's erecting, that ſeem to mock the minuteneſs of human
magnificence.</p>
            <p>In countries where there are nothing but plains, the ſmalleſt
elevations are apt to excite wonder. In Holland, which is all a flat, they
ſhew a little ridge of hills, near the ſea-ſide, which Boerhaave
generally marked out to his pupils as being mountains of no ſmall
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0823800101:160"/> What would be the ſenſations of
ſuch an auditory, could they at once be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with a view of the
heights and precipices of the Alps, or the Andes! Even among us in England, we
have no adequate ideas of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-proſpect; our hills are generally
ſloping from the plain, and cloathed to the very top with verdure; we can
ſcarce, therefore, lift our imaginations to thoſe immenſe piles whoſe
tops peep up behind intervening clouds, ſharp and precipitate, and reach to
heights that human avarice or curioſity have never been able to aſcend.</p>
            <p>We, in this part of the world, are not, for that reaſon, ſo
immediately intereſted in the queſtion which has ſo long been agitated
among philoſophers, concerning what gave riſe to theſe inequalities on
the ſurface of the globe. In our own happy region, we generally ſee no
inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities but ſuch as contribute to uſe and beauty; and we, therefore,
are amazed at a queſtion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring how ſuch neceſſary inequalities
came to be formed, and ſeeming to expreſs a wonder how the globe comes to
be ſo beautiful as we find it. But though with us there may be no great
cauſe for ſuch a demand, yet in thoſe places where mountains deform the
face of Nature, where they pour down cataracts, or give fury 
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0823800101:161"/> to tempeſts, there ſeems to be good reaſon for
enquiry either into their cauſes or their uſes. It has been, therefore,
aſked by many, in what manner mountains have come to be formed; or for what
uſes they are deſigned?</p>
            <p>To ſatisfy curioſity in theſe reſpects, much reaſoning has
been employed, and very little knowledge propagated. With regard to the firſt
part of the demand, the manner in which mountains were formed, we have already
ſeen the conjectures of different philoſophers on that head. One
ſuppoſing that they were formed from the earth's broken ſhell, at the
time of the deluge: another, that they exiſted from the creation, and only
acquired their deformities in proceſs of time: a third, that they owed their
original to earthquakes: and ſtill a fourth, with much more plauſibility
than the reſt, aſcribing them entirely to the fluctuations of the deep,
which he ſuppoſes in the beginning to have covered the whole earth. Such as
are pleaſed with diſquiſitions of this kind, may conſult Burnet,
Whiſton, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or Buffon. Nor would I be thought to decry any mental
amuſements, that at worſt keep us innocently employed; but, for my own
part, I cannot help wondering how the oppoſite demand has never come to be
made; and why <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0823800101:162"/> philoſophers have never aſked how we
come to have plains? Plains are ſometimes more preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to man than
mountains. Upon plains, an inundation has greater power; the beams of the ſun
are often collected there with ſuffocat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fierceneſs; they are
ſometimes found deſert for ſeveral hundred miles together, as in the
country eaſt of the Caſpian ſea, although other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fruitful, merely
becauſe there are no riſings nor depreſſions to form reſervoirs, or
collect the ſmalleſt rivulet of water. The moſt rational anſwer,
therefore, why either mountains or plains were formed, ſeems to be, that they
were thus faſhioned by the hand of Wiſdom, in order that pain and
pleaſure ſhould be ſo contiguous as that morality might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
either in bearing the one, or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating the other.</p>
            <p>Indeed, the more I conſider this diſpute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the
formation of mountains, the more I am ſtruck with the futility of the
queſtion. There is neither a ſtrait line, nor an exact ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, in
all nature. If we conſider a circle, even with mathematical preciſion, we
ſhall find it formed of a number of ſmall right lines, joining at angles
together. Theſe angles, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, may be conſidered in a circle as
mountains are upon our globe; and to demand the reaſon <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0823800101:163"/>
for the one being mountainous, or the other angular, is only to aſk why a
circle is a circle, or a globe is a globe. In ſhort, if there be no ſurface
without inequality in Nature, why ſhould we be ſurprized that the earth has
ſuch? It has often been ſaid, that the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of its ſurface are
ſcarce diſtinguiſhable, if compared to its magnitude; and I think we have
every reaſon to be content with the anſwer.</p>
            <p>Some, however, have avoided the difficulty by urging the final
cauſe. They alledge that mountains have been formed merely becauſe they are
uſeful to man. This carries the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer but a part of the way; for no one
can affirm that in all places they are uſeful. The contrary is known, by
horrid experience, in thoſe valleys that are ſubject to their influence.
However, as the utility of any part of our earthly habitation, is a very
pleaſing and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpeculation to every philoſopher, it is not to
be wondered that much has been ſaid to prove the uſefulneſs of theſe.
For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, many conjectures have been made that have received a
degree of aſſent even beyond their evidence; for men were unwilling to
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more miſerably wiſe.</p>
            <p>It has been alledged, as one principal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage 
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0823800101:164"/> that we derive from them, that they ſerve, like hoops
or ribs, to ſtrengthen our earth, and to bind it together. In conſequence
of this theory, Kircher has given us a map of the earth, in this manner hooped
with its moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; which might have a much more ſolid foundation, did it
entirely correſpond with truth.</p>
            <p>Others have found a different uſe for them, eſpecially when they
run ſurrounding our globe; which is, that they ſtop the vapours that are
continually travelling from the equator to the poles; for theſe being urged
by the heat of the ſun, from the warm regions of the line, muſt all be
accumulated at the poles, if they were not ſtopped in their way by thoſe
high ridges of mountains which croſs their direction. But an anſwer to this
may be, that all the great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in America lie lengthwiſe, and
therefore do not croſs their direction.</p>
            <p>But to leave theſe remote advantages, others aſſert, that not
only the animal but vegetable part of the creation would periſh for want of
convenient humidity, were it not for their friendly aſſiſtance. Their
ſummits are, by theſe, ſuppoſed to arreſt, as it were, the vapours
which float in the regions of the air. Their large inflexions, and channels,
are conſidered as <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0823800101:165"/> ſo many baſons prepared for the
reception of thoſe thick vapours, and impetuous rains, which deſcend into
them. The huge caverns beneath are ſo many magazines or conſervatories of
water for the peculiar ſervice of man: and thoſe orifices by which the
water is diſcharged upon the plain, are ſo ſituated as to enrich and
render them fruitful, inſtead of returning through ſubterraneous channels
to the ſea, after the performance of a tedious and fruitleſs
cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>However this be, certain it is that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all our great rivers
find their ſource among mountains; and, in general, the more extenſive the
mountain, the greater the river: thus the river Amazons, the greateſt in the
world, has its ſource among the Andes, which are the higheſt mountains on
the globe; the river Niger travels a long courſe of ſeveral hundred miles
from the mountains of the Moon, the higheſt in all Africa; and the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube
and the Rhine proceed from the Alps, which are probably the higheſt mountains
of Europe.</p>
            <p>It need ſcarce be ſaid that, with reſpect to height, there are
many ſizes of mountains, from the gently riſing upland, to the tall craggy 
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0823800101:166"/> precipice. The appearance is in general differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in
thoſe of different magnitudes. The firſt are cloathed with verdure to the
very tops, and only ſeem to aſcend to improve our proſpects, or ſupply
us with a purer air: but the lofty mountains of the other claſs have a very
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent aſpect. At a diſtance their tops are ſeen, in wavy ridges, of
the very colour of the clouds, and only to be diſtinguiſhed from them by
their figure, which, as I have ſaid, reſembles the billows of the
ſea<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>. As we approach, the mountain
aſſumes a deeper colour; it gathers upon the ſky, and ſeems to hide
half the horizon behind it. Its ſummits alſo are become more diſtinct,
and appear with a broken and perpendicular line. What at firſt ſeemed a
ſingle hill, is now found to be a chain of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued mountains, whoſe tops
running along in ridges, are emboſomed in each other; ſo that the
curvatures of one are fitted to the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences of the oppoſite ſide, and
form a winding valley between, often of ſeveral miles in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and all the
way continuing nearly of the ſame breadth. Nothing can be finer, or more
exact than Mr. Pope's deſcription of a traveller ſtraining up the Alps.
Every mountain he comes to he thinks will be the laſt; he finds, 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0823800101:167"/> however, an unexpected hill riſe before him; and that
being ſcaled, he finds the higheſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit almoſt at as great a
diſtance as before. Upon quitting the plain, he might have left a green and a
fertile ſoil, and a climate warm and pleaſing. As he aſcends, the ground
aſſumes a more ruſſet colour; the graſs becomes more moſſy; and
the weather more moderate. Still as he aſcends, the weather becomes more
cold, and the earth more barren. In this dreary paſſage, he is often
entertained with a little valley of ſurprizing verdure, cauſed by the
reflected heat of the ſun collected into a narrow ſpot on the ſurrounding
heights. But it much more frequently happens that he ſees only frightful
precipices beneath, and lakes of amazing depths; from whence rivers are formed,
and fountains derive their original. On thoſe places next the higheſt
ſummits, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation is ſcarcely carried on; here and there a few plants of
the moſt hardy kind appear: The air is intolerably cold; either continually
refrigerated with froſts, or diſturbed with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts. All the ground
here wears an eternal covering of ice, and ſnows that ſeem conſtantly
accumulating. Upon emerging from this war of the elements, he aſcends into a
purer and a ſerener region, where vegetation is entirely 
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0823800101:168"/> ceaſed; where the precipices, compoſed entirely of
rocks, riſe perpendicularly above him; while he views beneath him all the
combat of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; clouds at his feet; and thunders darting upward from
their boſoms below<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>Such are, in general, the wonders that preſent themſelves to a
traveller in his journey either over the Alps or the Andes. But we muſt not
ſuppoſe that this picture exhibits either a conſtant or an invariable
likeneſs of thoſe ſtupendous heights. Indeed, nothing can be more
capricious or irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular than the forms of many of them. The tops of ſome run
in ridges for a conſiderable length, without interruption; in others, the
line ſeems notched by great vallies to an amazing depth. Sometimes a
ſolitary and a ſingle moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain riſes from the boſom of the plain; and
ſometimes extenſive plains, and even provinces, as thoſe of Savoy and
Quito, are found embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed near the tops of mountains. In general, 
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0823800101:169"/> however, thoſe countries that are moſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous,
are the moſt barren and uninhabitable.</p>
            <p>If we compare the heights of mountains with each other, we ſhall
find that the greateſt and higheſt are found under the Line<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon. Paſſim.</bibl>
               </note>. It is thought by ſome,
that the rapidity of the earth's motion in theſe parts, together with the
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the tides there, may have thrown up thoſe ſtupendous
maſſes of earth. But, be the cauſe as it may, it is a remarkable fact,
that the inequalities of the earth's ſurface are greateſt there. Near the
Poles, the earth, indeed, is craggy and uneven enough; but the heights of the
mountains there, are very inconſiderable. On the contrary, at the Equator,
where Nature ſeems to ſport in the amazing ſize of all her productions,
the plains are extenſive; and the mountains remarkably lofty. Some of them
are known to riſe three miles perpendicular above the bed of the ocean.</p>
            <p>To enumerate the moſt remarkable of theſe, according to their
ſize, we ſhall begin with the Andes, of which we have an excellent
deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Ulloa, who went thither by command of the king of Spain, in
company with the French Academicians, to meaſure a degree of the meridian.
His journey up theſe <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0823800101:170"/> mountains is too curious not to
give an extract from it.</p>
            <p>After many incommodious days ſailing up the river Guayaquil, he
arrived at Caracol, a town ſituated at the foot of the Andes. Nothing could
exceed the inconveniencies which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in this voyage, from the flies
and moſchitoes (an animal reſembling our gnat). 
<q rend="inline">"We were the whole day," ſays he, "in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
motion to keep them off; but at night our torments were exceſſive. Our
gloves, indeed, were ſome defence to our hands; but our faces were entirely
expoſed; nor were our cloaths a ſufficient defence for the reſt of our
bodies; for their ſtings penetrating through the cloth, cauſed a very
painful and fiery itching. One night, in coming to an anchor near a large and
handſome houſe that was uninhabited, we had no ſooner ſeated
ourſelves in it, than we were attacked on all ſides by ſwarms of
moſchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes, ſo that it was impoſſible to have one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's quiet.
Thoſe who had covered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with cloaths made for this purpoſe,
found not the ſmalleſt defence; wherefore, hoping to find ſome relief in
the open fields, they ventured out, though in danger of ſuffering in a more
terrible manner from the ſerpents. But both places were equally obnoxious. On
quitting <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0823800101:171"/> this inhoſpitable retreat, we the next night
took up our quarters in an houſe that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited; the hoſt of which
being informed of the terrible manner we had paſt the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he
gravely told us, that the houſe we ſo greatly complained of, had been
forſaken on account of its being the purgatory of a ſoul. But we had more
reaſon to believe that it was quitted on account of its being the purgatory
of the body. After having journeyed for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of three days, through boggy
roads, in which the mules at every ſtep ſunk up to their bellies, we began
at length to perceive an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the climate; and having been long
accuſtomed to heat, we now began to feel it grown ſenſibly colder. 
<p>"It is remarkable, that at Tariguagua we often ſee inſtances
of the effects of two oppoſite temperatures, in two perſons happening to
meet; one of them leaving the plains below, and the other deſcending from the
mountain. The former thinks the cold ſo ſevere, that he wraps himſelf up
in all the garments he can procure; while the latter, finds the heat ſo
great, that he is ſcarce able to bear any cloaths whatſoever. The one
thinks the water ſo cold, that he avoids being ſprinkled by it; the other
is ſo delighted with its warmth, that he uſes it <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0823800101:172"/> as
a bath. Nor is the caſe very different in the ſame perſon, who
experiences the ſame diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſenſation upon his journey up, and
upon his return. This difference only proceeds from the change naturally felt
at leaving a climate to which one has been accuſtomed, and coming into
another of an oppoſite temperature.</p> 
                  <p>"The ruggedneſs of the road from Tarigua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua, leading up the
mountain, is not eaſily deſcribed. In ſome parts, the declivity is ſo
great, that the mules can ſcarce keep their footing; and in others, the
acclivity is equally difficult. The trouble of having people going before to
mend the road, the pains ariſing from the many falls and bruiſes, and the
being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly wet to the ſkin, might be ſupported, were not theſe
inconveniences augmented by the ſight of ſuch frightful precipices, and
deep abyſſes, as muſt fill the mind with ceaſeleſs terror. There are
ſome places where the road is ſo ſteep, and yet ſo narrow, that the
mules are obliged to ſlide down, without making any uſe of their feet
whatſoever. On one ſide of the rider, in this ſituation, riſes an
eminence of ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yards; and on the other, an abyſs of equal
depth; ſo that if he in the leaſt checks his mule, ſo as to deſtroy the
equilibrium, they both muſt unavoidably periſh.</p> 
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0823800101:173"/>"After having travelled about nine days in
this manner, ſlowly winding along the ſide of the mountain, we began to
find the whole country covered with an hoar froſt, and an hut, in which we
lay, had ice on it. Having eſcaped many perils, we at length, after a journey
of fifteen days, arrived upon the plain, on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of which ſtands
the city of Quito, the capital of one of the moſt charming regions upon
earth. Here, in the center of the torrid zone, the heat is not only very
tolerable, but in ſome places the cold alſo is painful. Here they enjoy all
the temperature and advantages of perpetual ſpring; their fields being always
covered with verdure, and enamelled with flowers of the moſt lively colours.
However, although this beautiful region be higher than any other country in the
world, and although it took up ſo many days of painful journey in the
aſcent, it is ſtill overlooked by tremendous mountains; their ſides
covered with ſnow, and yet flaming with volcanoes at the top. Theſe ſeem
piled one upon the other, and riſe to a moſt aſtoniſhing height, with
great coldneſs. However, at a determined point above the ſurface of the
ſea, the congelation is found at the ſame height in all the mountains.
Thoſe parts which are not ſubject to a continual froſt, 
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0823800101:174"/> have here and there growing upon them a ruſh,
reſembling the geniſta, but much more ſoft and flexible. Towards the
extremity of the part where the ruſh grows, and the cold begins to
encreaſe, is found a vegetable, with a round bulbous head, which, when dried,
becomes of amazing elaſticity. Higher up the earth is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely bare of
vegetation, and ſeems covered with eternal ſnow. The moſt remarkable
moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are, that of Cotopaxi, (already deſcribed as a volcano)
Chimborazo, and Pichincha. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topaxi is more than three geographical miles
above the ſurface of the ſea: the reſt are not much inferior. On the top
of the latter was my ſtation for meaſuring a degree of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian; where
I ſuffered particular hardſhips, from the intenſeneſs of the cold, and
the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſtorms. The ſky around was, in general, involved in
thick fogs, which, when they cleared away, and the clouds, by their gravity,
moved nearer to the ſurface of the earth, they appeared ſurrounding the
foot of the mountain, at a vaſt diſtance below, like a ſea,
encompaſſing an iſland in the midſt of it. When this happened, the
horrid noiſes of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts were heard from beneath, then diſcharging
themſelves on Quito, and the neighbouring <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0823800101:175"/> country. I
ſaw the lightenings iſſue from the clouds, and heard the thunders roll
far beneath me. All this time, while the tempeſt was raging below, the
mountain top, where I was placed, enjoyed a delightful ſerenity; the wind was
abated; the ſky clear; and the enlivening rays of the ſun moderated the
ſeverity of the cold. However, this was of no very long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for the
wind returned with all its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and with ſuch velocity as to dazzle the
ſight; whilſt my fears were encreaſed by the dreadful concuſſions of
the precipice, and the fall of enormous rocks; the only ſounds that were
heard in this frightful ſituation."</p> 
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Such is the animated picture of theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as given us by
this ingenious Spaniard: and I believe the reader will wiſh that I had made
the quotation ſtill longer. A paſſage over the Alps, or a journey
acroſs the Pyrenees, appear petty trips or excurſions, in the compariſon;
and yet theſe are the moſt lofty mountains we know of in Europe.</p>
            <p>If we compare the Alps with the mountains already deſcribed, we
ſhall find them but little more than one half of the height of the former.
The Andes, upon being meaſured by the baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, are found above three
thouſand, one <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0823800101:176"/> hundred and thirty-ſix toiſes or
fathoms above the ſurface of the ſea<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ulloa,
vol. i. p. 442.</bibl>
               </note>. Whereas the higheſt point of the Alps is not
above ſixteen hundred. The one, in other words, is above three miles high;
the other, about a mile and a half. The higheſt mountains of Aſia are,
Mount Taurus, Mount Immaus, Mount Caucaſus, and the mountains of
Japan.—Of theſe, none equals the Andes in height; although Mount
Caucaſus, which is the higheſt of them, makes very near approaches. Father
Verbieſt tells of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in China, which he meaſured, and found a mile
and a half high<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Verbieſt, alla
Chine.</bibl>
               </note>. In Africa, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Moon, famous for giving
ſource to the Niger, and the Nile, are rather more noted than known. Of the
Pike of Teneriffe, one of the Canary Iſlands that lie off this coaſt, we
have more certain information. In the year 1727, it was viſited by a company
of Engliſh merchants, who travelled up to the top, where they obſerved its
height, and the volcano on its very ſummit<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Phil. Tranſ. vol. v.</bibl>
               </note>. They found it an heap
of mountains, the higheſt of which riſes over the reſt like a
ſugar-loaf, and gives a name to the whole maſs. It is computed to be a mile
and an half perpendicular from the ſurface of the <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0823800101:177"/>
ſea. Kircher gives us an eſtimate of the heights of moſt of the other
great mountains in the world; but as he has taken his calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, in
general, from the ancients, or from modern travellers, who had not the art of
mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring them, they are quite incredible. The art of taking the heights of
places by the baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, is a new, and an ingenious invention. As the air
grows lighter as we aſcend, the fluid in the tube riſes in due proportion:
thus the inſtrument being properly marked, gives the height with a tolerable
degree of exactneſs; at leaſt enough to ſatisfy curioſity.</p>
            <p>Few of our great mountains have been eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in this manner;
travellers having, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, been deterred, by a ſuppoſed impoſſibility
of breathing at the top. However, it has been invariably found, that the air in
the higheſt that our modern travellers have aſcended, is not at all too
fine for reſpiration. At the top of the Pike of Teneriff, there was found no
other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience from the air, except its coldneſs; at the top of the
Andes, there was no difficulty of breathing perceived. The accounts, therefore,
of thoſe who have aſſerted that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to breathe, although at
much leſs heights, are greatly to be ſuſpected. In fact, it is very
natural for mankind to paint thoſe obſtacles as <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0823800101:178"/>
inſurmountable, which they themſelves have not had the fortitude or
perſeverance to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount.</p>
            <p>The difficulty and danger of aſcending to the tops of mountains,
proceeds from other cauſes, not the thinneſs of the air. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
ſome of the ſummits of the Alps have never yet been viſited by man. But
the reaſon is, that they riſe with ſuch a rugged and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
aſcent, that they are utterly inacceſſible. In ſome places they appear
like a great wall of ſix or ſeven hundred feet high; in others, there
ſtick out enormous rocks, that hang upon the brow of the ſteep, and every
moment threaten deſtruction to the traveller below.</p>
            <p>In this manner almoſt all the tops of the higheſt mountains are
bare and pointed. And this naturally proceeds from their being ſo
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually aſſaulted by thunders and tempeſts. All the earthy
ſubſtances with which they might have been once covered, have for ages been
waſhed away from their ſummits; and nothing is left remaining, but
immenſe rocks, which no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt has hitherto been able to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, time is every day, and every hour, making
depredations; and huge frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſeen tumbling down the precipice,
either looſened from the ſummit by froſt or <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0823800101:179"/> rains,
or ſtruck down by lightening. Nothing can exhibit a more terrible picture
than one of theſe enormous rocks, commonly larger than an houſe, falling
from its height, with a noiſe louder than thunder, and rolling down the
ſide of the mountain. Doctor Plot tells us of one in particular, which being
looſened from its bed, tumbled down the precipice, and was partly ſhattered
into a thouſand pieces. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, one of the largeſt fragments of
the ſame, ſtill preſerving its motion, travelled over the plain below,
croſſed a rivulet in the midſt, and at laſt ſtopped on the other
ſide of the bank! Theſe fragments, as was ſaid, are often ſtruck off by
lightening, and ſometimes undermined by rains; but the moſt uſual manner
in which they are diſunited from the mountain, is by froſt: the rains
inſinuating between the interſtices of the mountain, continue there until
there comes a froſt, and then, when converted into ice, the water ſwells
with an irreſiſtible force, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the ſame effect as gun-powder,
ſplitting the moſt ſolid rocks, and thus ſhattering the ſummits of
the mountain.</p>
            <p>But not rocks alone, but whole mountains are, by various cauſes,
diſunited from each other. We ſee, in many parts of the Alps, 
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0823800101:180"/> amazing clefts, the ſides of which ſo exactly
correſpond with the oppoſite, that no doubt can be made of their having
been once joined together. At Cajeta<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol.
ii. p. 364.</bibl>
               </note>, in Italy, a mountain was ſplit in this manner by
an earthquake; and there is a paſſage opened through it, that appears as if
elaborately done by the induſtry of man. In the Andes theſe breaches are
frequently ſeen. That at Thermopyle, in Greece, has been long famous. The
mountain of the Troglodytes, in Arabia, has thus a paſſage through it: and
that in Savoy, which Nature began, and which Victor Amadeus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, is an
inſtance of the ſame kind.</p>
            <p>We have accounts of ſome of theſe diſrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, immediately
after their happening. 
<q rend="inline">"In the month of June<note n="†" place="bottom">

1715.</bibl>
                  </note>, in the year 1714, a part of the mountain of Diableret, in
the diſtrict of Valais, in France, ſuddenly fell down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two and
three o'clock in the afternoon, the weather being very calm and ſerene. It
was of a conical figure, and deſtroyed fifty-five cottages in the fall.
Fifteen perſons, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with about an hundred beaſts, were alſo
cruſhed beneath its ruins, which covered an extent of a good league ſquare.
The duſt it occaſioned, inſtantly covered all the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0823800101:181"/> in darkneſs. The heaps of rubbiſh were more than
three hundred feet high. They ſtopped the current of a river that ran along
the plain, which now is formed into ſeveral new and deep lakes. There
appeared, through the whole of this rubbiſh, none of thoſe ſubſtances
that ſeemed to indicate that this diſruption had been made by means of
ſubterraneous fires. Moſt probably, the baſe of this rocky mountain was
rotted and decayed; and thus fell, without any extraneous violence."</q> In the
ſame manner, in the year 1618, the town of Pleurs, in France, was buried
beneath a rocky mountain, at the foot of which it was ſituated.</p>
            <p>Theſe accidents, and many more that might be enumerated of the
ſame kind, have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by various cauſes: by earthquakes, as in the
mountain at Cajeta; or by being decayed at the bottom, as at Diableret. But the
moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way is, by the foundation of one part of the mountain being
hollowed by waters and, thus wanting a ſupport, breaking from the other. Thus
it generally has been found in the great chaſms in the Alps; and thus it
almoſt always is known in thoſe diſruptions of hills, which are known by
the name of land-ſlips. Theſe are nothing more than the ſliding down of
an higher piece of ground, diſrooted from its <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0823800101:182"/>
ſituation by ſubterraneous inundations, and ſettling itſelf upon the
plain below.</p>
            <p>There is not an appearance in all nature that ſo much
aſtoniſhed our anceſtors, as theſe land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlips. In fact, to behold a
large upland, with its houſes, its corn, and cattle, at once looſened from
its place, and floating, as it were, upon the ſubjacent water; to behold it
quitting its ancient ſituation, and travelling forward like a ſhip, in
queſt of new adventures; this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly one of the moſt extraordinary
appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances that can be imagined; and to a people, ignorant of the powers of
Nature, might well be conſidered as a prodigy. Accordingly, we find all our
old hiſtorians mentioning it as an omen of approaching calamities. In this
more enlightened age, however, its cauſe is very well known; and, inſtead
of exciting ominous appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions in the populace, it only gives riſe to
ſome very ridiculous law-ſuits among them, about whoſe the property
ſhall be; whether the land which has thus ſlipt, ſhall belong to the
original poſſeſſor, or to him upon whoſe grounds it has encroached
and ſettled. What has been the determination of the judges, is not ſo well
known; but the circumſtances of the ſlips themſelves have been minutely
enough, and exactly deſcribed.</p>

               </note>, in the
kingdom of Ireland, there ſtood a declivity, gradually aſcending for near
half a mile. In the year 1713, and on the 10th of March, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
perceived a crack on its ſide, ſomewhat like a furrow made with a plough,
which they imputed to the effects of lightening, as there had been thunder the
night before. However, on the evening of the ſame day, they were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
to hear an hideous confuſed noiſe iſſuing all round from the ſide of
the hill; and their curioſity being raiſed, they reſorted to the place.
There, to their amazement, they found the earth, for near five acres, all in
gentle motion, and ſliding down the hill upon the ſubjacent plain. This
motion continued the remaining part of the day, and the whole night; nor did
the noiſe ceaſe during the whole time; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, probably, from the
attrition of the ground beneath. The day following, however, this ſtrange
journey down the hill ceaſed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely; and above an acre of the meadow
below, was found covered with what before compoſed a part of the
declivity.</p>
            <p>However, theſe ſlips, when a whole moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's ſide ſeems to
deſcend, happen but very rarely. There are ſome of another kind, 
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0823800101:184"/> ever, much more common; and, as they are always
ſudden, much more dangerous. Theſe are ſnow-ſlips, well known, and
greatly dreaded by travellers. It often happens, that when ſnow has long been
accumulated on the tops and on the ſides of mountains, it is borne down the
precipice, either by means of tempeſts, or its own melting. At firſt, when
looſened, the volume in motion is but ſmall; but it gathers as it continues
to roll; and, by the time it has reached the habitable parts of the mountain,
it is generally grown of enormous bulk. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it rolls, it levels all
things in its way; or buries them in unavoidable deſtruction. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of
rolling, it ſometimes is found to ſlide along from the top; yet even thus
it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as fatal as before. Nevertheleſs, we have had an inſtance,
a few years ago, of a ſmall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in Germany, that lived for above a
fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night beneath one of theſe ſnow-ſlips. Altho' they were buried,
during that whole time, in utter darkneſs, and under a bed of ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
feet deep, yet they were luckily taken out alive; the weight of the ſnow
being ſupported by a beam that kept up the roof; and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being
ſupplied them by the milk of an aſs, if I remember right, that was buried
under the ſame ruin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0823800101:185"/>But it is not the parts, alone, that are thus
found to ſubſide, whole mountains have been known totally to diſappear.
Pliny<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Plin. I, 2, cap. 93.</bibl>
               </note> tells
us, that in his own time, the lofty mountain of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botus, together with the
city of Eurites, were ſwallowed by an earthquake. The ſame fate, he ſays,
attended Phlegium, one of the higheſt mountains in Aethiopia; which, after
one night's concuſſion, was never ſeen more. In more modern times, a very
noted mountain in the Molucca iſlands, known by the name of the Peak, and
remarkable for being ſeen at a very great diſtance from ſea, was
ſwallowed by an earthquake; and nothing but a lake was left in the place
where it ſtood. Thus, while ſtorms and tempeſts are levelled againſt
mountains above, earthquakes and waters are undermining them below. All our
hiſtories talk of their deſtruction; and very few new ones (if we except
Mount Cenere, and one or two ſuch heaps of cinders) are produced. If
moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, therefore, were of ſuch great utility as ſome philoſophers
make them to mankind, it would be a very melancholy conſideration that ſuch
benefits were diminiſhing every day. But the truth is, the valleys are
fertilized by that earth which is waſhed from their ſides; 
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0823800101:186"/> and the plains become richer, in proportion as the
mountains decay.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIII. Of Water.</head>
            <p>IN contemplating nature, we ſhall often find the ſame
ſubſtances poſſeſſed of contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and producing
oppoſite effects. Air, which liquifies one ſubſtance, dries up another.
That fire which is ſeen to burn up the deſart, is often found, in other
places, to aſſiſt the lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriance of vegetation; and water, which, next
to fire, is the moſt fluid ſubſtance upon earth, nevertheleſs, gives
all other bodies their firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and durability; ſo that every element
ſeems to be a powerful ſervant, capable either of good or ill, and only
awaiting external direction, to become the friend or the enemy of mankind.
Theſe oppoſite qualities, in this ſubſtance in particular, have not
failed to excite the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and enquiry of the curious.</p>
            <p>That water is the moſt fluid penetrating body, next to fire, and
the moſt difficult to confine, is inconteſtibly proved by a variety of
experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. A veſſel through which water cannot paſs, may be ſaid to
retain any thing. It may <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0823800101:187"/> be objected, indeed, that
ſyrups, oils, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, leak through ſome veſſels that water can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
paſs through; but this is far from being the reſult of the greater tenuity
and fineneſs of their parts; it is owing to the roſin wherewith the wood of
ſuch veſſels abounds, which oils and ſyrups have a power of
diſſolving; ſo that theſe fluids, inſtead of finding their way, may
more properly be ſaid to eat their way through the veſſels that contain
them. However, water will at laſt find its way even through theſe; for it
is known to eſcape through veſſels of every ſubſtance, glaſs only
excepted. Other bodies may be found to make their way out more readily indeed;
as air, when it finds a vent, will eſcape at once; and quickſilver,
becauſe of its weight, quickly penetrates through what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever chinky veſſel
confines it: but water, tho' it operates more ſlowly, yet always finds a more
certain iſſue. As, for inſtance, it is well known that air will not
paſs through leather; which water will very readily penetrate. Air alſo may
be retained in a bladder; but water will quickly ooze through. And thoſe who
drive this to the greateſt degree of preciſion, pretend to ſay, that it
will paſs through pores ten times ſmaller than air can do. Be this as it
may, we are very certain that its parts are ſo ſmall that they have 
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0823800101:188"/> been actually driven through the pores of gold. This has
been proved by the famous Florentine experiment, in which a quantity of water
was ſhut up in an hollow ball of gold, and then preſſed with an huge
force by ſcrews, during which the fluid was ſeen to ooze out through the
pores of the metal, and to ſtand, like a dew, upon its ſurface.</p>
            <p>As water is thus penetrating, and its parts thus minute, it may
eaſily be ſuppoſed that they enter into the compoſition of all bodies,
both vegetable, animal, and foſſil. This every che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt's experience
convinces him of; and the mixture is the more obvious, as it can always be
ſeparated, by a gentle heat, from thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances with which it had
been united. Fire, as was ſaid, will penetrate where water cannot paſs; but
then it is not ſo eaſily to be ſeparated. But there is ſcarce any
ſubſtance from which its water cannot be divorced. The parings or filings
of lead, tin, and antimony, by diſtillation, yield water plentifully: the
hardeſt ſtones, ſea ſalt, nitre, vitriol, and ſulphur, are found to
conſiſt chiefly of water; into which they reſolve by force of fire. 
<q rend="inline">"All birds, beaſts, and fiſhes," ſays Newton,
"inſects, trees, and vegetables, with their parts, grow from water; and, by
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, return to water again."</q> In ſhort, <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0823800101:189"/>
almoſt every ſubſtance that we ſee, owes its texture and firmneſs to
the parts of water that mix with its earth; and, deprived of this fluid, it
falls away, into a maſs of ſhapeleſs duſt and aſhes.</p>
            <p>From hence we ſee, as was above hinted, that this moſt fluid
body, when mixed with others, gives them conſiſtence and form. Water, by
being mixed with earth or aſhes, and formed into a veſſel, when baked
before the fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a copel, remarkable for this, that it will bear the
utmoſt force of the hotteſt furnace that art can contrive. So the Chineſe
earth, of which porcelane is made, is nothing more than an artificial
compoſition of earth and water, united by heat; and which a greater degree of
heat could eaſily ſeparate. Thus we ſee a body, extremely fluid of
itſelf, in ſome meaſure aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming a new nature, by being united with
others; we ſee a body, whoſe fluid and diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing qualities are ſo
obvious, giving conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and hardneſs to all the ſubſtances of
the earth.</p>
            <p>From conſiderations of this kind, Thales, and many of the ancient
philoſophers, held that all things were made of water. In order to confirm
this opinion, Helmont made an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, by diveſting a quantity of earth
of all its oils and ſalts, and then putting this earth, <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0823800101:190"/> ſo prepared, into an earthen pot, which nothing but rain-water
could enter, and planting a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low therein; this vegetable, ſo planted, grew
up to a conſiderable heighth and bulk, merely from the accidental
aſperſion of rain-water; while the earth in which it was planted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
no ſenſible dimunition. From this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, he concluded, that water was
the only nouriſhment of the vegetable tribe; and that vegetables, being the
nouriſhment of animals, all organized ſubſtances, therefore, owed their
ſupport and being only to water. But this has been ſaid by Woodward to be
all a miſtake: for he ſhews, that water being impregnated with earthy
particles, is only the conveyer of ſuch ſubſtances into the pores of
vegetables, rather than an encreaſer of them, by its own bulk: he ſhews,
that water is ever found to afford ſo much leſs nouriſhment, in
proportion as it is purified by diſtillation. A plant in diſtilled water
will not grow ſo faſt as in water not diſtilled: and if the ſame be
diſtilled three or four times over, the plant will ſcarce grow at all, or
receive any nouriſhment from it. So that water, as ſuch, does not ſeem
the proper and only nouriſhment of vegetables, but only the vehicle thereof,
which contains the nutritious particles, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them through all parts of
the plant. Water, <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0823800101:191"/> in its pure ſtate, may ſuffice to
extend or ſwell the parts of a plant, but affords vegetable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a
moderate proportion.</p>
            <p>However this be, it is agreed on all ſides, that water, ſuch as
we find it, is far from being a pure ſimple ſubſtance. The moſt
genuine, we know, is mixed with exhalations and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of various
kinds; and no expedient that has been hitherto diſcovered, is capable of
purifying it entirely. If we filter and diſtill it a thouſand times,
according to Boerhaave, it will ſtill depoſe a ſediment: and by repeating
the proceſs, we may evaporate it entirely away, but can never totally remove
its impurities. Some, however, aſſert, that water, properly diſtilled,
will have no ſediment<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Hill's Hiſtory of
Foſſils.</bibl>
               </note>; and that the little white ſpeck which is found at
the bottom of the ſtill, is a ſubſtance that enters from without. Kircher
uſed to ſhew, in his Muſaeum, a phial of water, that had been kept for
fifty years, hermetically ſealed<note n="†" place="bottom">Hermetically
ſealing a glaſs-veſſel, means no more than heating the mouth of the
phial red hot; and thus when the glaſs is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pliant, ſqueezing the
mouth together with a pair of pincers, and then twiſting it ſix or ſeven
times round, which effectually cloſes it up.</note>; during which time it
depoſed no ſediment, but continued as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0823800101:192"/>
as when firſt it was put in. How far, therefore, it may be brought to a
ſtate of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by diſtillation, is unknown; but we very well know, that
all ſuch water as we every where ſee, is a bed in which plants, minerals,
and animals, are all found confuſedly floating together.</p>
            <p>Rain-water, which is a fluid of Nature's own diſtilling, and which
has been raiſed ſo high by evaporation, is, nevertheleſs, a very mixed
and impure ſubſtance. Exhalations of all kinds, whether ſalts,
ſulphurs, or metals, make a part of its ſubſtance, and tend to increaſe
its weight. If we gather the water that falls, after a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-clap, in a
ſultry ſummer's day, and let it ſettle, we ſhall find a real ſalt
ſticking at the bottom. In winter, however, its impure mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are fewer;
but ſtill may be ſeparated by diſtillation. But as to that which is
generally caught pouring from the tops of houſes, it is particularly foul,
being impregnated with the ſmoak of the chimnies, the vapour of the ſlates
or tiles, and with other impurities that birds and animals may have depoſited
there. Beſides, though it ſhould be ſuppoſed free from all theſe, it
is mixed with a quantity of air, which, after being kept for ſome time, will
be ſeen to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0823800101:193"/>Spring-water is next in point of purity. This,
according to Doctor Halley, is collected from the air itſelf; which being
ſated with water, and coming to be condenſed by the evening's cold, is
driven againſt the tops of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, where being condenſed, and
collected, it trickles down by the ſides, into the cavities of the earth; and
running for a while under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, bubbles up in fountains upon the plain. This
having made but a ſhort cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, has generally had no long time to
diſſolve or imbibe any foreign ſubſtances by the way.</p>
            <p>River-water is generally more foul than the former. Wherever the
ſtream flows, it receives a tincture from its channel. Plants, minerals, and
animals, all contribute their ſhare to add to its impurities: ſo that
ſuch as live at the mouths of great rivers, generally are ſubject to all
thoſe diſorders which contaminated and unwholſome waters are known to
produce. Of all the river<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water in the world, that of the Indus, and the
Thames, are ſaid to be moſt light and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
            <p>The impureſt freſh water that we know, is that of ſtagnating
pools and lakes, which, in ſummer, may be more properly conſidered as a
jelly of floating inſects, than a collection of <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0823800101:194"/> water.
In this, millions of little reptiles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed by any current, which
might cruſh their frames to pieces, breed and engender. The whole teems with
ſhapeleſs life; and only grows more fruitful by encreaſing
putrefaction.</p>
            <p>Of the purity of all theſe waters, the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not the
tranſparency, ought to be the teſt. Water may be extremely clear and
beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to the eye, and yet very much impregnated with mineral principles.
In fact, ſea-water is the moſt tranſparent of any, and yet is well known
to contain a large mixture of ſalt and bitumen. On the contrary, thoſe
waters which are lighteſt, have the feweſt diſſolutions float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in
them; and may, therefore, be the moſt uſeful for all the purpoſes of
life. But, after all, though much has been ſaid upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and
although waters have been weighed with great aſſiduity, to determine their
degree of ſalubrity, yet neither this, nor their curdling with ſoap, nor
any other philoſophical ſtandard whatſoever, will anſwer the purpoſes
of true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Experience alone ought to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the uſeful, or
noxious qualities, of every ſpring; and experience aſſures us, that
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds of water are adapted to different conſtitutions. An
inconteſtible proof of this, are the many medicinal ſprings throughout the 
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0823800101:195"/> world, whoſe peculiar benefits are known to the
natives of their reſpective countries. Theſe are of various kinds,
according to the different minerals with which they are impregnated; hot,
ſaline, ſulphureous, bituminous, and oily. But the account of theſe will
come moſt properly under that of the ſeveral minerals by which they are
produced.</p>
            <p>After all, therefore, we muſt be contented with but an impure
mixture for our daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verage. And yet, perhaps, this very mixture may often
be more ſerviceable to our health than that of a purer kind. We know that it
is ſo with regard to vegetables: and why not, alſo, in general, to man? Be
this as it will, if we are deſirous of having water in its greateſt purity,
we are ordered, by the curious in this particular, to diſtill it from ſnow,
gathered upon the tops of the higheſt mountains, and to take none but the
outer and ſuperficial part thereof. This we muſt be ſatisfied to call
pure water; but even this is far ſhort of the pure unmixed philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
element; which, in reality, is no where to be found.</p>
            <p>As water is thus mixed with foreign matter, and often the
repoſitory of minute animals, or vegetable ſeeds, we need not be
ſurprized that, when carried to ſea, it is always found to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefy. 
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0823800101:196"/> But we muſt not ſuppoſe that it is the element
itſelf, which thus grows putrid, and offenſive, but the ſubſtances with
which it is impregnated. It is true, the utmoſt precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are taken to
deſtroy all vegetable and animal ſubſtances that may have previouſly
been lodged in it, by boiling: but, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, there are ſome
that will ſtill ſurvive the operation; and others, that find their way
during the time of its ſtowage. Seamen, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, aſſure us, that their
water is generally found to putrefy twice, at leaſt, and ſometimes three
times, in a long voyage. In about a month after it has been at ſea, when the
bung is taken out of the caſk, it ſends up a noiſome and dangerous
vapour, which would take fire upon the application of a candle<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Phil. Tranſ. vol. v. part ii. p. 71.</bibl>
               </note>.
The whole body of the water then is found replete with little worm-like
inſects, that float, with great briſkneſs, through all its parts. Theſe
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally live for about a couple of days; and then dying, by depoſiting
their ſpoils, for a while encreaſe the putrefaction. After a time, the
heavier parts of theſe ſinking to the bottom, the lighter float, in a
ſcum, at the top; and this is what the mariners call, the water's purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
itſelf. There are ſtill, however, another <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0823800101:197"/> race of
inſects, which are bred, very probably, from the ſpoils of the former; and
produce, after ſome time, ſimilar appearances: theſe dying, the water is
then thought to change no more. However, it very often happens, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in hot climates, that nothing can drive theſe nauſeous inſects from the
ſhip's ſtore of water. They often encreaſe to a very diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and
frightful ſize, ſo as to deter the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner, though parching with thirſt,
from taſting that cup which they have contaminated.</p>
            <p>This water, as thus deſcribed, therefore, is a very different
fluid from that ſimple elementary ſubſtance upon which philoſophical
theories have been founded; and concerning the nature of which there have been
ſo many diſputes. Elementary water is no way compounded; but is without
taſte, ſmell, or colour; and incapable of being diſcerned by any of the
ſenſes, except the touch. This is the famous diſſolvent of the
chymiſts, into which, as they have boaſted, they can reduce all bodies; and
which makes up all other ſubſtances, only by putting on a different
diſguiſe. In ſome forms, it is fluid, tranſparent, and evaſive of the
touch; in others, hard, firm, and elaſtic. In ſome, it is ſtiffened by
cold; in others, diſſolved by fire. Accord-to them, it only aſſumes
external ſhapes from <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0823800101:198"/> accidental cauſes; but the
mountain is as much a body of water as the cake of ice that melts on its brow;
and even the philoſopher himſelf, is compoſed of the ſame materials
with the cloud or meteor which he contemplates.</p>
            <p>Speculation ſeldom reſts when it begins. Others, diſallowing
the univerſality of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, will not allow that in a ſtate of
nature there is any ſuch thing as water at all. What aſſumes the
appearance, ſay they, is nothing more than melted ice. Ice is the real
element of Nature's making; and when found in a ſtate of fluidity, it is then
in a ſtate of violence. All ſubſtances are naturally hard; but ſome
more readily melt with heat than others. It requires a great heat to melt iron;
a ſmaller heat will melt copper: ſilver, gold, tin, and lead, melt with
ſmaller ſtill: ice, which is a body like the reſt, melts with a very
moderate warmth; and quickſilver, melts with the ſmalleſt warmth of all.
Water, therefore, is but ice kept in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fuſion; and ſtill returning
to its former ſtate, when the heat is taken away. Between theſe oppoſite
opinions, the controverſy has been carried on with great ardour; and much has
been written on both ſides: and yet, when we come to examine the debate, it
will probably terminate in this queſtion, whether cold or heat 
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0823800101:199"/> firſt began their operations upon water? This is a
fact of very little importance, if known; and what is more, it is a fact we can
never know.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if we examine into the operations of cold and heat upon
water, we ſhall find that they produce ſomewhat ſimilar effects. Water
dilates in its bulk, by heat, to a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree; and, what is
more extraordinary, it is likewiſe dilated by cold, in the ſame
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>If water be placed over a fire, it grows gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually larger in bulk,
as it becomes hot, until it begins to boil; after which, no art can either
encreaſe its bulk, or its heat. By encreaſing the fire, indeed, it may be
more quickly evaporated away; but its heat, and its bulk, ſtill continue the
ſame. By the expanding of this fluid by heat, philoſophers have found a way
to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the warmth, or the coldneſs of other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: for if put into a
glaſs tube, by its ſwelling and riſing therein, it ſhews the quantity
of heat in the body to which it is applied; by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, and ſinking,
it ſhews the abſence of the ſame. Inſtead of uſing water in this
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, which is called a thermometer, they now make uſe of ſpirit
of wine, which is not apt to freeze, and which is endued even with a 
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0823800101:200"/> greater expanſion, by heat, than water. The
inſtrument conſiſts of nothing more than a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ball of glaſs, with
a long tube growing out of it. This being partly filled with ſpirits of wine,
tinctured red, ſo as to be ſeen when it riſes, the ball is plunged into
boiling water, which making the ſpirit within expand and riſe in the tube,
the water marks the greateſt height to which it aſcends; at this point the
tube is to be broken off, and then hermetically ſealed, by melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
glaſs with a blow-pipe: a ſcale being placed by the ſide, completes the
thermometer. Now as the fluid expands or condenſes with heat or cold, it will
riſe and fall in the tube in proportion; and the degree or quantity of
aſcent or deſcent will be ſeen in the ſcale.</p>
            <p>No fire, as was ſaid, can make water hotter, after it begins to
boil. We can, therefore, at any time be ſure of an equable certain heat;
which is that of boiling water, which is invariably the ſame. The certainty
of ſuch an heat is not leſs uſeful than the inſtrument that meaſures
it. It affords a ſtandard, fixed, degree of heat over the whole world;
boiling water being as hot in Greenland, as upon the coaſts of Guinea. One
fire is more intenſe than another; of heat there are various degrees; but
boiling water is an heat every where the ſame, and eaſily procurable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0823800101:201"/>As heat thus expands water, ſo cold, when it
is violent enough to freeze the ſame, produces exactly the ſame effect, and
expands it likewiſe. Thus water is acted upon in the ſame manner by two
oppoſite qualities; being dilated by both. As a proof that it is dilated by
cold, we have only to obſerve the ice which floats on the ſurface of a
pond, which it would not do were it not dilated, and grown more bulky, by
freez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than the water, which remains unfroze. Mr. Boyle, however, put the
matter paſt a doubt, by a variety of experiments<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Boyle, vol. i. p. 610.</bibl>
               </note>. Having poured a proper
quantity of water into a ſtrong earthen veſſel, he expoſed it,
uncovered, to the open air, in froſty nights; and obſerved, that
continually the ice reached higher than the water, before it was frozen. He
filled alſo a tube with water, and ſtopped both ends with wax: the water,
when froze, was found to puſh out the ſtopples from both ends; and a rod of
ice appeared at each end of the tube, which ſhewed how much it was ſwollen
by the cold within.</p>
            <p>From hence, therefore, we may be very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the cold's
dilating of the water; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience alſo ſhews that, the force of this
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion has been found as great as any which <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0823800101:202"/> heat
has been found to produce. The touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole of a ſtrong gun-barrel being
ſtopped, and a plug of iron forcibly driven into the muzzle, after the barrel
had been filled with water, it was placed in a mixture of ice and ſalt; the
plug, though ſoldered to the barrel, at firſt gave way, but being fixed in
more firmly, within a quarter of an hour the gun-barrel burſt with a loud
noiſe, and blew up the cover of the box wherein it lay. Such is its force in
an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary experiment. But it has been known to burſt cannons, filled with
water, and then left to freeze; for the cold congealing the water, and the ice
ſwelling, it became irreſiſtible. The burſting of rocks, by froſt,
which is frequent enough in the Northern climates, and is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen
in our own, is an equal proof of the expanſion of congealed water. For
having, by ſome means inſinuated itſelf into the body of the rock, it has
remained there till the cold was ſufficient to affect it by congelation. But
when once frozen, no obſtacle is able to confine it from dilating; and, if it
cannot otherwiſe find room, the rock muſt burſt aſunder.</p>
            <p>This alteration in the bulk of water, might have ſerved as a proof
that it was capable of being compreſſed into a narrower ſpace than it
occupied before; but, till of late, water was <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0823800101:203"/> held to be
incompreſſible. The general opinion was, that no art whatſoever could
ſqueeze it into a narrower compaſs; that no power on earth, for inſtance,
could cruſh a pint of water into a veſſel that held an hair's breadth
leſs than a pint. And this, ſaid they, appears from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Florentine
experiment; where the water, rather than ſuffer compreſſure, was ſeen
to ooze out through the pores of the ſolid metal; and, at length, making a
cleft in the ſide, ſpun out with great vehemence. But later trials have
proved that water is very compreſſible, and partakes of that elaſticity
which every other body poſſeſſes in ſome degree. Indeed, had not
mankind been dazzled by the brilliancy of one inconcluſive experiment, there
were nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous reaſons to convince them of its having the ſame properties
with other ſubſtances. Ice, which is water in another ſtate, is very
elaſtic. A ſtone flung ſlantingly along the ſurface of a pond, bounds
from the water ſeveral times; which ſhews it to be elaſtic alſo. But
the trials of Mr. Canton have put this paſt all doubt; which being ſomewhat
ſimilar to thoſe of the great Boyle, who preſſed it with weights
properly applied, carry ſufficient conviction.</p>
            <p>What has been hitherto related, is chiefly applicable to the element
of water alone; but its ſluidity is a property that it poſſeſſes in
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0823800101:204"/> with ſeveral other ſubſtances, in other
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects greatly differing from it. That quality which gives riſe to the
definition of a fluid, namely, that its parts are in a continual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine
motion, ſeems extremely applicable to water. What the ſhapes of thoſe
parts are, it would be vain to attempt to diſcover. Every trial only ſhews
the futility of the attempt; all we find is, that they are extremely minute;
and that they roll over each other with the greateſt eaſe. Some, indeed,
from this property alone, have not heſitated to pronounce them globular; and
we have, in all our hydroſtatical books, pictures of theſe little globes in
a ſtate of ſliding and rolling over each other. But all this is merely the
work of imagination; we know that ſubſtances of any kind, reduced very
ſmall, aſſume a fluid appearance, ſomewhat reſembling that of water.
Mr. Boyle, after finely powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſifting a little dry powder of
plaiſter of Paris, put it in a veſſel over the fire, where it ſoon
began to boil like water, exhibiting all the motions and appearances of a
boiling liquor. Although but a powder, the parts of which we know are very
different from each other, and juſt as accident has formed them, yet it
heaved in great waves, like water. Upon <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0823800101:205"/> agitation, an
heavy body will ſink to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and a light one emerge to the top. There
is no reaſon, therefore, to ſuppoſe the figure of the parts of water
round, ſince we ſee their flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idity very well imitated by a compoſition,
the parts of which are of various forms and ſizes. The ſhape of the parts
of water, therefore, we muſt be content to continue ignorant of. All we know
is, that earth, air, and fire, all conduce to ſeparate the parts from each
other.</p>
            <p>Earthy ſubſtances divide the parts from each other, and keep
them aſunder. This diviſion may be ſo great, that the water will entirely
loſe its fluidity thereby. Mud, potter's clay, and dried bricks, are but ſo
many different combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of earth and water; each ſubſtance in which
the parts of water are moſt ſeparated from each other, appearing to be the
moſt dry. In ſome ſubſtances, indeed, where the parts of water are
greatly divided, as in porcelane, for inſtance, it is no eaſy matter to
recover and bring them together again; but they continue in a manner fixed and
united to the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured clay. This circumſtance it was, which led Doctor
Cheney into a very peculiar ſtrain of thinking. He ſuſpected that the
quantity of water, on the ſurface of the earth, was daily decreaſing. For,
ſays he, ſome parts of it are <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0823800101:206"/> continually joined to
vegetable, animal, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſubſtances, which no art can again recover.
United with theſe, the water loſes its fluidity; for if, continues he, we
ſeparate a few particles of any fluid, and faſten them to a ſolid body,
or keep them aſunder, one from another, they will be fluid no longer. To
produce fluidity, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of ſuch particles are required;
but here they are cloſe, and deſtitute of their natural properties. Thus,
according to him, the world is growing every day harder and harder, and the
earth firmer and firmer; and there may come a time when every object around us
may be ſtiffened in univerſal frigidity! How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we have cauſes enough
of anxiety in this world already, not to add this prepoſterous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to
the number.</p>
            <p>That air alſo contributes to divide the parts of water, we can
have no manner of doubt of; ſome have even diſputed whether water be not
capable of being turned into air. However, though this muſt not be allowed,
it muſt be granted, that it may be turned into a ſubſtance which greatly
reſembles air (as we have ſeen in the experiment of the oeolpile) with all
its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties; except that, by cold, this new made air may be condenſed
again into water.</p>
            <p>But of all the ſubſtances which tend to divide 
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0823800101:207"/> the parts of water, fire is the moſt powerful. Water,
when heated into ſteam, acquires ſuch force, and the parts of it tend to
fly off from each other with ſuch violence, that no earthly ſubſtance we
know of, is ſtrong enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine them. A ſingle drop of water,
converted into ſteam, has been found capable of raiſing a weight of twenty
tons; and would have raiſed twenty thouſand, were the veſſel confining
it ſufficiently ſtrong, and the fire below en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in proportion.</p>
            <p>From this eaſy yielding of its parts to external preſſure,
ariſes the art of determining the bulk of bodies by plunging them in water;
with all the other uſeful diſcoveries in that part of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
philoſophy, called hydroſtatics. The laws of this ſcience, which
Archimedes firſt began, and Paſcal, with ſome other of the moderns,
brought to perfection, rather belongs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental than to natural
hiſtory. However, I will take leave to mention ſome of the moſt
ſtriking paradoxes in this branch of ſcience, which are as well confirmed
by experiment, as rendered univerſal by theory. It would, indeed, be
unpardonable, while diſcourſing on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of water, to omit giving
ſome account of the manner in which it ſuſtains ſuch immenſe bulks as
we ſee floating upon its ſoft and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurface: how ſome bodies,
that are known <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0823800101:208"/> to ſink at one time, ſwim with
eaſe, if their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face be enlarged: how the heavieſt body, even gold
itſelf, may be made to ſwim upon water; and how the lighteſt, ſuch as
cork, ſhall remain ſunk at the bottom: how the pouring in of a ſingle
quart of water, will burſt an hogſhead hooped with iron: and how it
aſcends, in pipes, from the valley, to travel over the mountain: theſe are
circumſtances that are at firſt ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but, upon a ſlight
conſideration, loſe their wonder.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">In the above ſketch, the manner of
demonſtrating uſed by Monſieur D'Alambert is made uſe of, as the moſt
obvious, and the moſt ſatisfactory. 
<bibl>Vide Eſſai ſur, &amp;c.</bibl>
               </note>In order to
conceive the manner in which all theſe wonders are effected, we muſt begin
by obſerving that water is poſſeſſed of an invariable property, which
has not hitherto been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that of always keeping its ſurface level
and even. Winds, indeed, may raiſe it into waves; or art ſpurt it up in
fountains; but ever, when left to itſelf, it ſinks into a ſmooth even
ſurface, of which no one part is higher than another. If I ſhould pour
water, for inſtance, into the arm of a pipe of the ſhape of the letter U,
the fluid would riſe in the other arm juſt to the ſame height; becauſe,
otherwiſe, it would not find its level, which it invariably maintains. A pipe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0823800101:209"/> bending from one hill down into the valley, and riſing
by another, may be conſidered as a tube of this kind, in which the water,
ſinking in one arm, riſes to maintain its level in the other. And upon this
principle all water-pipes depend; which can never raiſe the water higher than
the fountain from which they proceed.</p>
            <p>Again, let us ſuppoſe for a moment, that the arms of the pipe
already mentioned, may be made long or ſhort at pleaſure; and let us
ſtill further ſuppoſe, that there is ſome obſtacle at the bottom of
it, which prevents the water poured into one arm, from riſing in the other.
Now it is evident, that this obſtacle at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom will ſuſtain a
preſſure from the water in one arm, equal to what would make it riſe in
the other; and this preſſure will be great, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the arm
filled with water is tall. We may, therefore, generally conclude, that the
bottom of every veſſel is preſſed by a force, in proportion to the
height of the water in that veſſel. For inſtance, if the veſſel
filled with water be forty feet high, the bottom of that veſſel will
ſuſtain ſuch a preſſure as would raiſe the ſame water forty feet
high, which is very great. From hence we ſee how extremely apt to burſt our
pipes that convey water to the city are; for deſcending from an hill of more
than <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0823800101:210"/> forty feet high, they are preſſed by the water
contained in them, with a force equal to what would raiſe it more than forty
feet high; and that this is ſometimes able to burſt a wooden pipe, we can
have no room to doubt of.</p>
            <p>Still recurring to our pipe, let us ſuppoſe one of its arms ten
times as thick as the other; this will produce no effect whatſoever upon the
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle below, which we ſuppoſed hindering its riſe in the other arm;
becauſe, how thick ſoever the pipe may be, its contents would only riſe
to its own level; and it will, therefore, preſs the obſtacle with a force
equal thereto. We may, therefore, univerſally conclude, that the bottom of
any veſſel is preſſed by its water, not as it is broad or narrow, but
in proportion as it is high. Thus the water contained in a veſſel not
thicker than my finger, preſſes its bottom as forcibly as the water
contained in an hogſhead of an equal height; and, if we made holes in the
bottoms of both, the water would burſt out as forceful from the one as the
other. Hence we may, with great eaſe, burſt an hogſhead with a ſingle
quart of water; and it has been often done. We have only<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Nollet's Lectures.</bibl>
               </note>, for this, to place an
hogſhead on one end, filled with water: we then bore an hole in its top, into
which we plant a narrow <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0823800101:211"/> tin pipe, of about thirty feet
high: by pouring a quart of water into this, at the top, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to
riſe higher in the pipe, it will preſs more forcibly on the bottom and
ſides of the hogſhead below, and at laſt burſt it.</p>
            <p>Still returning to our ſimple inſtrument of demonſtration. If
we ſuppoſe the obſtacle at the bottom of the pipe to be moveable, ſo as
that the force of the water can puſh it up into the other arm; ſuch a body
is quickſilver, for inſtance. Now, it is evident, that the weight of water
weighing down upon this quickſilver in one arm, will at laſt preſs it up
in the other arm; and will continue to preſs it upwards, until the fluid in
both arms be upon a par. So that here we actually ſee quickſilver, the
heavieſt ſubſtance in the world, except gold, floating upon water, which
is but a very light ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>When we ſee water thus capable of ſuſtaining quickſilver, we
need not be ſurprized that it is capable of floating much lighter
ſubſtances, ſhips, animals, or timber. When any thing floats upon water,
we always ſee that a part of it ſinks in the ſame. A cork, a ſhip, a
buoy, each buries itſelf a bed on the ſurface of the water; this bed may be
conſidered as ſo much water diſplaced; the water will, therefore, loſe 
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0823800101:212"/> ſo much of its own weight as is equal to the weight of
that bed of water which it diſplaces. If the body be heavier than a ſimilar
bulk of water, it will ſink; if lighter, it will ſwim. Univerſally,
therefore, every body that is plunged in water, loſes as much of its weight
as is equal to the weight of a body of water of its own bulk. Some light
bodies, therefore, ſuch as cork, loſe all their weight, and therefore
ſwim, becauſe their bulk of water is heavier than they; other more
ponderous bodies ſink, becauſe they are heavier than their bulk of
water.</p>
            <p>Upon this ſimple theorem entirely depends the art of weighing
metals hydroſtatically. I have a guinea, for inſtance, and deſire to know
whether it be pure gold: I have weighed it in the uſual way with another
guinea, and find it exactly of the ſame weight, but ſtill I have ſome
ſuſpicion, from its greater bulk, that it is not pure. In order to
determine this, I have nothing more to do than to weigh it in water with that
ſame guinea that I know to be good, and of the ſame weight; and this will
inſtantly ſhew the difference; for the true ponderous metal will ſink,
and the falſe bulky one will be ſuſtained in proportion to the
greatneſs of its ſurface. Thoſe whoſe buſineſs it is to examine the
purity of metals, have a balance made for this purpoſe, <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0823800101:213"/> by which they can preciſely determine which is moſt ponderous,
or, as it is expreſſed, which has the greateſt ſpecific gravity.
Seventy-one pound and an half of quickſilver is found to be equal in bulk to
an hundred pound weight of gold. In the ſame proportion, ſixty of lead,
fifty-four of ſilver, forty-ſeven of copper, forty-five of braſs,
forty-two of iron, and thirty-nine of tin, are each equal to an hundred pound
of the ſame moſt ponderous of all metals.</p>
            <p>This method of preciſely determining the purity of gold, by
weighing in water, was firſt diſcovered by Archimedes, to whom mankind have
been indebted for many of the moſt uſeful diſcoveries. Hiero, king of
Sicily, having ſent a certain quantity of gold to be made into a crown, the
workman, it ſeems, kept a part for his own uſe, and ſupplied the
deficiency with a baſer metal. His fraud was ſuſpected by the king, but
could not be proved; till applying to Archimedes, he weighed the crown in
water; and, by this method, directly informed the king of the quantity of gold
which was taken away.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid, that all fluids endeavour to preſerve their
level; and, likewiſe, that a body preſſing on the ſurface, tended to
deſtroy that level. From hence, therefore, it will eaſily be 
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0823800101:214"/> inferred, that the deeper any body ſinks, the greater
will be the reſiſtance of the depreſſed fluid beneath. It will be
aſked, therefore, as the reſiſtance encreaſes in proportion as the body
deſcends, how comes the body, after it is got a certain way, to ſink at
all? The anſwer is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious. From the fluid above it preſſing it down
with almoſt as great a force as the fluid beneath preſſes it up. Take
away, by any art, the preſſure of the fluid from above, and let only the
reſiſtance of the fluid from below be ſuffered to act, and after the body
is got down very deep, the reſiſtance will be inſuperable. To give an
inſtance: a ſmall hole opens in the bottom of a ſhip at ſea, forty feet
we will ſuppoſe below the ſurface of the water; through this the water
burſts up with great violence; I attempt to ſtop it with my hand, but it
puſhes the hand violently away. Here the hand is, in fact, a body attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſink upon water, at a depth of forty feet, with the preſſure from
above taken away. The water, therefore, will overcome my ſtrength; and will
continue to burſt in till it has got to its level: if I ſhould then dive
into the hold, and clap my hand upon the opening, as before, I ſhould
perceive no force acting againſt my hand at all, for the water above
preſſes the hand as much down againſt the hole, as the water without 
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0823800101:215"/> preſſes it upward. For this reaſon, alſo, when
we dive to the bottom of the water, we ſuſtain a very great preſſure
from above, it is true, but it is counteracted by the preſſure from below;
and the whole acting uniformly on the ſurface of the body, wraps us cloſe
round without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
            <p>As I have deviated thus far, I will juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one or two
properties more, which water, and all ſuch like fluids, is found to
poſſeſs. And firſt, their aſcending in veſſels which are emptied
of air, as in our common pumps for inſtance. The air, however, being the
agent in this caſe, we muſt previouſly examine the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of that,
before we undertake the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The other property to be mentioned is,
that of their aſcending in ſmall capillary tubes. This is one of the moſt
extraordinary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutable appearances in nature. Glaſs tubes may be
drawn, by means of a lamp, as fine as an hair; ſtill preſerving their
hollow within. If one of theſe be planted in a veſſel of water, or
ſpirit of wine, the liquor will immediately be ſeen to aſcend; and it
will riſe higher, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the tube is ſmaller; a foot, two feet,
and more. How does this come to paſs? Is the air the cauſe? No: the liquor
riſes, although the air be taken away. Is attraction the cauſe? 
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0823800101:216"/> No: for quickſilver does not aſcend, which it
otherwiſe would. Many have been the theories of experimental philoſophers
to explain this property. Such as are fond of travelling in the regions of
conjecture, may conſult Hawkſbee, Morgan, Jurin, or Watſon, who have
examined the ſubject with great minuteneſs. Hitherto, however, nothing but
doubts inſtead of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege have been the reſult of their enquiries. It
will not, therefore, become us to enter into the minuteneſs of the enquiry,
when we have ſo many greater wonders to call our attention away.</p>

world with fertility and verdure; has been variouſly conſidered; and
divided the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of mankind, more than any other topic in natural
hiſtory.</p>
            <p>In this conteſt, the various champions may be claſſed under
two leaders, Mr. De La Hire, who contends that rivers muſt be ſupplied from
the ſea, ſtrained through the pores of the earth; and Doctor Halley, who
has endeavoured to demonſtrate, that the clouds alone are ſufficient for
the ſupply. Both ſides have brought in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics to their aid; and have
ſhewn, that long and laborious calculations can at any time be made, to

               </note> begins his proofs, that rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, evaporated from the
ſea, is inſufficient for the production of rivers; by ſhewing, that rain
never penetrates the ſurface of the earth above ſixteen inches. From thence
he infers, <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0823800101:218"/> that it is impoſſible for it, in many
caſes, to ſink ſo as to be found at ſuch conſiderable depths below.
Rain-water, he grants, is often ſeen to mix with rivers, and to ſwell their
currents; but a much greater part of it evaporates away. In fact, continues he,
if we ſuppoſe the earth every where covered with water, evaporation alone
would be ſufficient to carry off two feet nine inches of it in a year: and
yet, we very well know, that ſcarce nineteen inches of rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water falls in
that time; ſo that evaporation would carry off a much greater quantity than
is ever known to deſcend. The ſmall quantity of rain-water that falls is
therefore but barely ſufficient for the purpoſes of vegetation. Two leaves
of a fig-tree have been found, by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, to imbibe from the earth, in
five hours and an half, two ounces of water. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the great quantity
of fluid that muſt be exhauſted in the maintainance of one ſingle plant.
Add to this, that the waters of the river Rungis will, by calculation, riſe
to fifty inches; and the whole country from whence they are ſupplied, never
receives fifty inches, in the year, by rain. Beſides this, there are many
ſalt ſprings, which are known to proceed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the ſea, and
are ſubject to its flux and reflux. In ſhort, wherever we dig beneath 
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0823800101:219"/> the ſurface of the earth, except in a very few
inſtances, water is to be found; and it is by this ſubterraneous water,
that ſprings and rivers, nay, a great part of vegetation itſelf, is
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. It is this ſubterraneous water, which is raiſed into ſteam,
by the internal heat of the earth, that feeds plants. It is this
ſubterraneous water that diſtills through its interſtices; and there
cooling, forms fountains. It is this that, by the addition of rains, is
encreaſed into rivers; and pours plenty over the whole earth.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide of the queſtion<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Phil. Tranſ. vol. ii. p. 128.</bibl>
               </note>, it is
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that the vapours which are exhaled from the ſea, and driven by
the winds upon land, are more than ſufficient to ſupply not only plants
with moiſture, but alſo to furniſh a ſufficiency of water to the
greateſt rivers. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, an eſtimate has been made of the
quantity of water emptied at the mouths of the greateſt rivers; and of the
quantity alſo raiſed from the ſea by evaporation; and it has been found,
that the latter by far exceeds the former. This calculation was made by Mr.
Mariotte. By him it was found, upon receiving ſuch rain as fell in a year, in
a proper veſſel, fitted for that purpoſe, that, one year with another,
there might fall about twenty inches of water upon <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0823800101:220"/> the
ſurface of the earth, throughout Europe. It was alſo computed, that the
river Seine, from its ſource to the city of Paris, might cover an extent of
ground, that would ſupply it annually with above ſeven billions of cubic
feet of this water, formed by evaporation. But, upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the quantity
which paſſed through the arches of one of its bridges in a year, it was
found to amount only to two hundred and eighty millions of cubic feet, which is
not above the ſixth part of the former number. Hence, therefore, it appears,
that this river may receive a ſupply brought to it by the evaporated waters
of the ſea, ſix times greater than what it gives back to the ſea by its
current; and, therefore, evaporation is more than ſufficient for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the greateſt rivers; and ſupplying the purpoſes alſo of vegetation.</p>
            <p>In this manner the ſea ſupplies ſufficient hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity to the
air for furniſhing the earth with all neceſſary moiſture. One part of
its vapours fall upon its own boſom, before they arrive upon land. Another
part is arreſted by the ſides of mountains, and is compelled, by the
riſing ſtream of air, to mount upward towards the ſummits. Here it is
preſently precipitated, dripping down by the crannies of the ſtone. In
ſome places, entering into the caverns of the <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0823800101:221"/>
mountain, it gathers in thoſe receptacles, which being once filled, all the
reſt overflows; and breaking out by the ſides of the hills, forms ſingle
ſprings. Many of theſe run down by the vallies, or guts between the ridges
of the mountain, and coming to unite, form little ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets or brooks; many of
theſe meeting in one common valley, and gaining the plain ground, being grown
leſs rapid, become a river: and many of theſe uniting, make ſuch vaſt
bodies of water as the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube.</p>
            <p>There is ſtill a third part, which falls upon the lower grounds,
and furniſhes plants with their wonted ſupply. But the circulation does not
reſt even here; for it is again exhaled into vapour by the action of the
ſun; and again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to that great maſs of waters whence it firſt
aroſe. This, adds Doctor Halley, ſeems the moſt reaſonable
hypotheſis; and much more likely to be true, than that of thoſe who derive
all ſprings from the filtering of the ſea waters through certain imaginary
tubes or paſſages within the earth; ſince it is well known, that the
greateſt rivers have their moſt copious foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the moſt remote from
the ſea<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>This ſeems the moſt adopted opinion; and yet, after all, it is

is ſtill room to look out for a better theory. The perpetuity of many
ſprings, which always yield the ſame quantity when the leaſt rain or
vapour is afforded, as well as when the greateſt, is a ſtrong objection.
Derham<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Derham Phyſico Theol.</bibl>
               </note>
mentions a ſpring at Upminſter, which he could never perceive by his eye to
be diminiſhed, in the greateſt droughts, even when all the ponds in the
country, as well as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining brook, have been dry for ſeveral months
together. In the rainy ſeaſons alſo, it was never overflowed; except
ſometimes, perhaps, for an hour or ſo, upon the immiſſion of the
external rains. He, therefore, juſtly enough concludes, that had this
ſpring its origin from rain or vapour, there would be found an encreaſe or
decreaſe of its water, correſponding to the cauſes of its production.</p>
            <p>Thus the reader, after having been toſſed from one hypotheſis
to another, muſt at laſt be contented to ſettle in conſcious ignorance.
All that has been written upon this ſubject, affords him rather ſomething
to ſay, than ſomething to think; ſomething rather for others than for
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Varenius, indeed, although he is at a loſs for the origin of
rivers, is by no means ſo as to their formation. He is pretty poſitive that
all <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0823800101:223"/> rivers are artificial. He boldly aſſerts, that
their channels have been originally formed by the induſtry of man. His
reaſons are, that when a new ſpring breaks forth, the water does not make
itſelf a new channel, but ſpreads over the adjacent land. Thus, ſays he,
men are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to direct its courſe; or, otherwiſe, Nature would never
have found one. He enumerates many rivers, that are certainly known, from
hiſtory, to have been dug by men. He alledges, that no ſalt-water rivers
are found, becauſe men did not want ſalt-water; and as for ſalt, that was
procurable at a leſs expence than digging a river for it. However, it coſts
a ſpeculative man but a ſmall expence of thinking to form ſuch an
hypotheſis. It may, perhaps, engroſs the reader's patience to detain him
longer upon it.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, though philoſophy be thus ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, as to the
production of rivers, yet the laws of their motion, and the nature of their
currents, have been very well explained. The Italians have particularly
diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this reſpect; and it is chiefly to them
that we are indebted for the improvement<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>All rivers have their ſource either in moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, or elevated
lakes; and it is in their deſcent <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0823800101:224"/> from theſe, that
they acquire that velocity which maintains their future current. At firſt
their courſe is generally rapid and headlong; but it is retarded in its
journey, both by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual friction againſt its banks, by the many
obſtacles it meets to divert its ſtream, and by the plains generally
becoming more level as it approaches towards the ſea.</p>
            <p>If this acquired velocity be quite ſpent, and the plain through
which the river paſſes is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely level, it will, notwithſtanding,
ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to run from the perpendicular preſſure of the water,
which is always in exact proportion to the depth. This perpendicular
preſſure is nothing more than the weight of the upper waters preſſing
the lower out of their places, and, conſequently, driving them forward, as
they cannot recede againſt the ſtream. As this preſſure is greateſt
in the deepeſt parts of the river, ſo we generally find the middle of the
ſtream moſt rapid; both becauſe it has the greateſt motion thus
communicated by the preſſure, and the feweſt obſtructions from the
banks on either ſide.</p>
            <p>Rivers thus ſet into motion are almoſt always found to make
their own beds. Where they find the bed elevated, they wear its ſubſtance
away, and depoſit the ſediment in the next hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0823800101:225"/>
ſo as in time to make the bottom of their channels even. On the other hand,
the water is continually gnawing and eating away the banks on each ſide; and
this with more force as the current happens to ſtrike more directly againſt
them. By theſe means, it always has a tendency to render them more ſtrait
and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to its own courſe. Thus it continues to rectify its banks, and
enlarge its bed; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, to diminiſh the force of its ſtream,
till there becomes an equilibrium between the force of the water, and the
reſiſtance of its banks, upon which both will remain without any further
mutation. And it is happy for man that bounds are thus put to the eroſion of
the earth by water; and that we find all rivers only dig and widen themſelves
but to a certain degree<note n="*" place="bottom">

the river is uſually lower than any part of the valley. But it often
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the ſurface of the water is higher than many of the grounds
that are adjacent to the banks of the ſtream. If, after inundations, we take
a view of ſome rivers, we ſhall find their banks appear above water, at a
time that all <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0823800101:226"/> the adjacent valley is overflown. This
proceeds from the frequent depoſition of mud, and ſuch like ſubſtances,
upon the banks, by the rivers frequently overflowing; and thus, by degrees,
they become elevated above the plain; and the water is often ſeen higher
alſo.</p>
            <p>Rivers, as every body has ſeen, are always broadeſt at the
mouth; and grow narrower towards their ſource. But what is leſs known, and
probably more deſerving curioſity, is, that they run in a more direct
channel as they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately leave their ſources; and that their
ſinuoſities and turnings become more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous as they proceed. It is a
certain ſign among the ſavages of North America, that they are near the
ſea when they find the rivers winding, and every now and then changing their
direction. And this is even now become an indication to the Europeans
themſelves, in their journies through thoſe trackleſs foreſts. As
thoſe ſinuoſities, therefore, encreaſe as the river approaches the
ſea, it is not to be wondered at, that they ſometimes divide, and thus
diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogue by different channels. The Danube diſembogues into the Euxine
by ſeven mouths; the Nile, by the ſame number; and the Wolga, by

               </note> of rivers are to be eſtimated very differently from the
manner in which thoſe writers who have given us mathematical the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories on
this ſubject, repreſent them. They found their calculations upon the
ſurface, being a perfect plain, from one bank to the other: but this is not
the actual ſtate of Nature; for rivers, in general, riſe in the middle; and
this convexity is greateſt in proportion as the rapidity of the ſtream is
greater. Any perſon, to be convinced of this, need only lay his eye as nearly
as he can on a level with the ſtream, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acroſs to the oppoſite
bank, he will perceive the river in the midſt to be elevated conſiderably
above what it is at the edges. This riſing, in ſome rivers, is often found
to be three feet high; and is ever encreaſed, in proportion to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
of the ſtream. In this caſe, the water in the midſt of the current
loſes a part of its weight, from the velocity of its motion; while that at
the ſides, for the contrary reaſon, ſinks lower. It ſometimes, however,
happens, that this appearance is reverſed; for when tides are found to flow
up with violence againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural current of the water, the greateſt
rapidity is then found at the ſides of the river, as the 
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0823800101:228"/> water there leaſt reſiſts the influx from the
ſea. On thoſe occaſions, therefore, the river preſents a concave rather
than a convex ſurface: and, as in the former caſe, the middle waters roſe
in a ridge; in this caſe, they ſink in a furrow.</p>
            <p>The ſtream in all rivers is more rapid in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as its
channel is diminiſhed. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it will be much ſwifter where it is
ten yards broad, than where it is twenty; for the force behind ſtill
puſhing the water forward, when it comes to the narrow part, it muſt make
up by velocity what it wants in room.</p>
            <p>It often happens that the ſtream of a river is oppoſed by one of
its jutting banks, by an iſland in the midſt, the arches of a bridge, or
ſome ſuch obſtacle. This produces, not unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a back current; and
the water having paſt the arch with great velocity, puſhes the water on
each ſide of its direct current. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a ſide current, tending to
the bank; and not unfrequently a whirlpool; in which a large body of waters are
circulated in a kind of cavity, ſinking down in the middle. The central point
of the whirlpool is always loweſt, becauſe it has the leaſt motion: the
other parts are ſupported, in ſome meaſure, by the violence of theirs;
and, conſequently, riſe higher as their motion is greater; ſo that
towards the extremity of the <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0823800101:229"/> whirlpool muſt be higher
than towards the center.</p>
            <p>If the ſtream of a river be ſtopped at the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and yet
be free below; as for inſtance, if it be laid over by a bridge of boats,
there will then be a double current; the water at the ſurface will flow back,
while that at the bottom will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with encreaſed velocity. It often
happens that the current at the bottom is ſwifter than at the top, when, upon
violent land-floods, the weight of waters towards the ſource, preſſes the
waters at the bottom, before it has had time to communicate its motion to the
ſurface. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in all other caſes, the ſurface of the ſtream is
ſwifter than the bottom, as it is not retarded by rubbing over the bed of the
river.</p>
            <p>It might be ſuppoſed that bridges, dams, and other obſtacles
in the current of a river, would retard its total velocity. But the difference
they make is very inconſiderable. The water, by theſe ſtoppages, gets an
elevation above the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; which, when it has ſurmounted, it gives a
velocity that recompences the former delay. Iſlands and turnings alſo
retard the courſe of the ſtream but very inconſiderably; any cauſe
which diminiſhes the quantity of the water, moſt ſenſibly diminiſhes
the force and the velocity of the ſtream.</p>

of water in the bed of the river, always encreaſes its rapidity; except in
caſes of inundation. The inſtant the river has overflowed its banks, the
velocity of its current is always turned that way, and the inundation is
perceived to continue for ſome days; which it would not otherwiſe do, if,
as ſoon as the cauſe was diſcontinued, it acquired its former

            <p>A violent ſtorm, that ſets directly up againſt the courſe of

its width or depth. This, which at firſt view ſeems a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, is yet very
eaſily accounted for. The little river, in this caſe, only goes towards
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the ſwiftneſs of the larger, and putting its dormant waters
into motion. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0823800101:231"/> the Venetian branch of the

            <p>A river tending to enter another, either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly, or in an

conſpiring with the ſtream of the former.</p>
            <p>The union of two rivers into one, makes it flow the ſwifter;
ſince the ſame quantity of water, inſtead of rubbing againſt four
ſhores, now only rubs againſt two. And, beſides, the current being
deeper, becomes of conſequence more fitted for motion.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the places from whence rivers proceed, it may be
taken for a general rule, that the largeſt

               </note> and
higheſt mountains ſupply the greateſt and moſt extenſive rivers. It
may alſo be remarked, in whatever direction the ridge of the mountain runs,
the river takes an oppoſite courſe. If the mountain, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
ſtretches from north to ſouth, the river runs from eaſt to weſt; and
ſo contrariwiſe. Theſe are ſome of the moſt generally received
opinions with regard to the courſe of rivers; <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0823800101:232"/> however,
they are liable to many exceptions; and nothing but an actual knowledge of each
particular river can furniſh us with an exact theory of its current.</p>
            <p>The largeſt rivers of Europe are, firſt, the Wolga, which is
about ſix hundred and fifty leagues in length, extending from Reſchow to
Aſtrachan. It is remarkable of this river, that it abounds with water during
the ſummer months of May and June: but all the reſt of the year is ſo
ſhallow as ſcarce to cover its bottom, or allow a paſſage for loaded
veſſels that trade up its ſtream. It was up this river that the Engliſh
attempted a trade into Perſia, in which they were ſo unhappily
diſappointed, in the year 1741. The next in order is the Danube. The courſe
of this is about four hundred and fifty leagues, from the mountains of
Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to the Black Sea. It is ſo deep between Buda and Belgrade, that
the Turks and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have fleets of men of war upon it; which frequently
engaged, during the laſt war between the Ottomans and the Auſtrians:
however, it is unnavigable further down, by reaſon of its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taracts, which
prevent its commerce into the Black Sea. The Don, or Tanais, which is four
hundred leagues from the ſource of that branch of it called the Soſna, to
its mouth in the Euxine <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0823800101:233"/> ſea. In one part of its
courſe, it approaches near the Wolga; and Peter the Great had actually begun
a canal, by which he intended joining thoſe two rivers; which he did not live
to finiſh. The Nieper, or Boriſthenes, which riſes in the middle of
Muſcovy, and runs a courſe of three hundred and fifty leagues, to empty
itſelf into the Black Sea. The Old Coſſacks inhabit the banks and
iſlands of this river; and frequently croſs the Black Sea, to plunder the
maritime places on the coaſts of Turky. The Dwina; which takes its riſe in
a province of the ſame name in Ruſſia, then runs a courſe of three
hundred leagues, and diſembogues into the White Sea, a little below
Archangel.</p>
            <p>The largeſt rivers of Aſia are, the Hoanho, in China, which is
eight hundred and fifty leagues in length, computing from its ſource at Raja
Ribron, to its mouth in the Gulph of Changi. The Jeniſca of Tartary, about
eight hundred leagues in length, from the Lake Selinga, to the Icy Sea. This
river is, by ſome, ſuppoſed to ſupply moſt of that great quantity of
drift wood which is ſeen floating in the ſeas, near the Artic circle. The
Oby, of five hundred leagues, running from the lake of Kila into the Northern
ſea. The Amour, in Eaſtern Tartary, whoſe courſe is about five hundred
and ſeventy-five leagues, from its ſource to its <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0823800101:234"/>
entrance into the ſea of Kamtſkatka. The Kiam, in China, five hundred and
fifty leagues in length. The Ganges, one of the moſt noted rivers in the
world, and about as long as the former. It riſes in the mountains which
ſeparate India from Tartary; and running through the dominions of the Great
Mogul, diſcharges itſelf by ſeveral mouths into the bay of Bengal. It is
not only eſteemed by the Indians for the depth, and pureneſs of its
ſtream, but for a ſuppoſed ſanctity which they believe to be in its
waters. It is viſited annually by ſeveral hundred thouſand pilgrims, who
pay their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions to the river as to a god; for ſavage ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity is
always known to miſtake the bleſſings of the Deity, for the Deity
himſelf. They carry their dying friends from diſtant countries, to expire
on its banks; and to be buried in its ſtream. The water is loweſt in April
or May; but the rains beginning to fall ſoon after, the flat country is
overflowed for ſeveral miles, till about the end of September; the waters
then begin to retire, leaving a prolific ſediment behind, that enriches the
ſoil, and, in a few days time, gives a luxuriance to vegetation, beyond what
can be conceived by an European. Next to this may be reckoned the ſtill more
celebrated river Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates. This riſes from two ſources, north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward 
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0823800101:235"/> of the city Erzerum, in Turcomania; and unites about
three days journey below the ſame; from whence, after performing a courſe
of five hundred leagues, it falls into the Gulph of Perſia, fifty miles below
the city of Baſſora in Arabia. The river Indus is extended from its
ſource to its diſcharge into the Arabian ſea, four hundred leagues.</p>
            <p>The largeſt rivers of Africa are, the Senegal, which runs a
courſe of not leſs than eleven hundred leagues, comprehending the Niger,
which ſome have ſuppoſed to fall into it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, later accounts ſeem
to affirm that the Niger is loſt in the ſands, about three hundred miles up
from the weſtern coaſts of Africa. Be this as it may, the Senegal is well
known to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable for more than three hundred leagues up the country; and
how much higher it may reach is not yet diſcovered, as the dreadful fatality
of the inland parts of Africa, not only deter cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, but even avarice,
which is a much ſtronger paſſion. At the end of laſt war, of fifty
Engliſh men that were ſent to the factory at Galam, a place taken from the
French, and nine hundred miles up the river, only one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to tell the
fate of his companions, who were killed by the climate. The celebrated river
Nile is ſaid to be nine hundred and ſeventy <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0823800101:236"/> leagues,
from its ſource among the mountains of the Moon, in Upper Aethiopia, to its
opening into the Mediterranean ſea. The ſources of this river were
conſidered as inſcrutable by the ancients; and the cauſes of its
periodical inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation were equally unknown. They have both been aſcertained
by the miſſionaries who have travelled into the interior parts of
Aethiopia. The Nile takes its riſe in the kingdom of Gojam<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Kircher, Mund. Subt. vol. ii. p. 72.</bibl>
               </note>, from a
ſmall aperture on the top of a mountain, which, though not above a foot and
an half over, yet was unfathomable. This foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, when arrived at the foot of
the mountain, expands into a river; and, being joined by others, forms a lake
thirty leagues long, and as many broad; from this, its channel, in ſome
meaſure, winds back to the country where it firſt began; from thence,
precipitating by fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cataracts, it travels through a variety of
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart regions, equally formidable, ſuch as Amha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Olaca, Damot, and
Xaoa. Upon its arrival in the kingdom of Upper Egypt, it runs through a rocky
channel, which ſome late travellers have miſtaken for its cataracts. In the
beginning of its courſe, it receives many leſſer rivers into it; and
Pliny was miſtaken, in ſaying that it received none. In the beginning
alſo of its courſe, it <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0823800101:237"/> has many windings; but, for
above three hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red leagues from the ſea, it runs in a direct line. Its
annual overflowings ariſe from a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious cauſe, which is almoſt
univerſal with all the great rivers that take their ſource near the Line.
The rainy ſeaſon, which is periodical in thoſe climates, flood the
rivers; and as this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways happens in our ſummer, ſo the Nile is at that
time overflown. From theſe inundations, the inhabitants of Egypt derive
happineſs and plenty; and, when the river does not ariſe to its
accuſtomed heights, they prepare for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different harveſt. It begins to
overflow about the ſeventeenth of June; it generally continues to augment for
forty days, and decreaſes in about as many more. This time of encreaſe and
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, however, is much more inconſiderable now than it was among the
ancients. Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus informs us, that it was an hundred days riſing, and as
many falling; which ſhews that the inundation was much greater at that time
than at preſent. Mr. Buffon<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. ii. p.

               </note> has aſcribed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diminution, as well to the
leſſening of the mountains of the Moon, by their ſubſtance hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo
long been waſhed down with the ſtream, as to the riſing of the earth in
Egypt, that has for ſo many ages received this extraneous ſupply. 
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0823800101:238"/> But we do not find, by the buildings that have remained
ſince the times of the ancients, that the earth is much raiſed ſince
then. Beſides the Nile in Africa, we may reckon the Zara, and the Coanza,
from the greatneſs of whoſe open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings into the ſea, and the rapidity of
whoſe ſtreams, we form an eſtimate of the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from whence
they come. Their courſes, however, are ſpent in watering deſerts and

of this river is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to its vaſt length; and, where its width is
moſt contracted, its depth is augmented in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. So great is the body
of its waters, that other rivers, though before the objects of admiration,
themſelves are loſt in its boſom. It proceeds, after their junction, with
its uſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, without any viſible change in its breadth or
rapidity; and, if we may ſo expreſs <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0823800101:239"/> it, remains
great without oſtentation. In ſome places it diſplays its whole
magnificence, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding into ſeveral large branches, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing a
multitude of iſlands; and, at length, diſcharging itſelf into the ocean,
by a channel of an hundred and fifty miles broad. Another river, that may
almoſt rival the former, is the St. Lawrence, in Canada, which riſing in
the lake Aſſiniboils, paſſes from one lake to another, from
Criſtinaux to Alempigo, from thence to lake Superior; thence to the lake
Hurons; to lake Erie; to lake Ontario; and, at laſt, after a courſe of nine
hundred leagues, pours their collected waters into the Atlantic ocean. The
river Miſſiſippi is of more than ſeven hundred leagues in length,
beginning at its ſource near the lake Aſſiniboils, and ending at its
opening into the Gulph of Mexico. The river Plate runs a length of more than
eight hundred leagues from its ſource in the river Parana, to its mouth. The
river Oroonoko is ſeven hundred and fifty-five leagues in length, from its
ſource near Paſto, to its diſcharge into the Atlantic ocean.</p>
            <p>Such is the amazing length of our greateſt rivers; and even in
ſome of theſe, the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſources very probably yet continue
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. In fact, if we conſider the number of <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0823800101:240"/> rivers
which they receive, and the little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance we have with the regions
through which they run, it is not to be wondered at that geographers are
divided concerning the ſources of moſt of them. As among a number of roots
by which nouriſhment is conveyed to a ſtately tree, it is difficult to
determine preciſely that by which the tree is chiefly ſupplied; ſo among
the many branches of a great river, it is equally difficult to tell which is
the original. Hence it may eaſily happen, that a ſmaller branch is taken
for the capital ſtream; and its runnings are purſued, and delineated, in
prejudice of ſome other branch that better deſerved the name and the
deſcription. In this manner<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note> in Europe, the Danube is known to receive thirty leſſer
rivers: the Wolga, thirty-two or thirty-three. In Aſia, the Hohanno receives
thirty-five; the Jeniſca above ſixty; the Oby as many; the Amour about
forty; the Nanquin receives thirty rivers; the Ganges twenty; and the Euphrates
about eleven. In Africa, the Senegal receives more than twenty rivers; the Nile
receives not one for five hundred leagues upwards, and then only twelve or
thirteen. In America, the river Amazons receives above ſixty, and thoſe
very conſiderable; the river <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0823800101:241"/> St. Lawrence about forty,
counting thoſe which fall into its lakes; the Miſſiſippi receives
forty; and the river Plate above fifty.</p>
            <p>I mentioned the inundations of the Ganges and the Nile, but almoſt
every other great river whoſe ſource lies within the tropics, have their
ſtated inundations alſo. The river Pegu has been called, by travellers, the
Indian Nile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſimilar overflowings of its ſtream: this it
does to an extent of thirty leagues on each ſide; and ſo fertilizes the
ſoil, that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants ſend great quantities of rice into other
countries, and have ſtill abundance for their own conſumption. The river
Senegal has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe its inundations, which cover the whole flat country of
Negroland, beginning and ending much about the ſame time with thoſe of the
Nile; as, in fact, both rivers riſe from the ſame mountains. But the
difference between the effects of the inundations in each river, is
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable: in the one, it diſtributes health and plenty; but in the other,
diſeaſes, famine, and death. The inhabitants along the torrid coaſts of
the Senegal, can receive no benefit from any additional manure the river may
carry down to their ſoil, which is, by nature, more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
luxuriant; or, even if they could, they have not induſtry to turn it to any
advantage. <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0823800101:242"/> The banks, therefore, of the rivers, lie
uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, overgrown with rank and noxious her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, and infeſted with
thouſands of animals of various malignity. Every new flood only tends to
encreaſe the rankneſs of the ſoil, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide freſh ſhelter for
the creatures that infeſt it. If the flood continues but a few days longer
than uſual, the improvident inhabitants, who are driven up into the higher
grounds, begin to want proviſions, and a famine enſues. When the river
begins to return into its channel, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity and heat of the air are
equally fatal; and the carcaſes of infinite numbers of animals, ſwept away
by the inundation, putrefying in the ſun, produce a ſtench that is almoſt
inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. But even the luxuriance of the vegetation itſelf, becomes a
nuiſance. I have been aſſured, by perſons of veracity that have been up
the river Senegal, that there are ſome plants that grow along the coaſt,
the ſmell of which is ſo powerful, that it is hardly to be endured. It is
certain, that all the ſailors and ſoldiers who have been at any of our
factories there, aſcribe the unwholſomeneſs of the voyage up the
ſtream, to the vegetable vapour. However this be, the inundations of the
rivers in this wretched part of the globe, contribute ſcarce any advantage,
if we except to the beauty of <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0823800101:243"/> the proſpects which they
afford. Theſe, indeed, are finiſhed up beyond the utmoſt reach of art: a
ſpacious glaſſy river, with its banks here and there fringed to the very
ſurface by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove-tree, that grows down into the water, preſents
itſelf to view. Lofty foreſts of various colours, with openings between,
carpeted with green plants, and the moſt gaudy flowers; beaſts and animals,
of various kinds, that ſtand upon the banks of the river, and, with a ſort
of wild curioſity, ſurvey the mariners as they paſs, contribute to
heighten the ſcene. This is the ſketch of an African proſpect; which
delights the eye, even while it deſtroys the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Beſide theſe annually periodical inundations, there are many
rivers that overflow at much ſhorter intervals. Thus moſt of thoſe in
Peru and Chili have ſcarce any motion by night; but upon the appearance of
the morning ſun, they reſume their former rapidity: this proceeds from the
mountain ſnows, which melting with the heat, encreaſe the ſtream, and
continue to drive on the current while the ſun continues to diſſolve
them. Some rivers alſo flow with an even ſteady cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, from their
ſource to the ſea; others flow with greater rapidity, their ſtream being
poured down in a cataract, or ſwallowed by the ſands, before they reach the
ſea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0823800101:244"/>The rivers of thoſe countries that have been
leaſt inhabited, are uſually more rocky, uneven, and broken into
water-falls or cataracts, than thoſe where the induſtry of man has been
more prevalent. Wherever man comes, nature puts on a milder appearance: the
terrible and the ſublime, are exchanged for the gentle and the uſeful; the
cataract is ſloped away into a placid ſtream; and the banks become more

have been taught to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire with the deſires of her controller. Every
one's experience muſt have ſupplied inſtances of rivers thus being made
to flow more evenly, and more beneficially to mankind; but there are ſome
whoſe currents are ſo rapid, and falls ſo precipitate, that no art can
obviate; and that muſt for ever remain as amazing inſtances of incorrigible
nature.</p>
            <p>Of this kind are the cataracts of the Rhine; one of which I have
ſeen exhibit a very ſtrange appearance; it was that at Schathauſen, which

had formerly fallen. The Nile, as was ſaid, has its cataracts. The 
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0823800101:245"/> river Vologda, in Ruſſia, has two. The river Zara,
in Africa, has one near its ſource. The river Velino, in Italy, has a

               </note>, in Sweden, the river there ruſhes down from a prodigious
high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, into a deep pit, with a terrible noiſe, and ſuch dreadful
force, that thoſe trees de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the maſts of ſhips, which are
floated down the river, uſually are turned upſide down in their fall, and
often are ſhattered to pieces, by being daſhed againſt the ſurface of
the water in the pit; this occurs if the maſts fall ſideways upon the
water; but if they fall end ways, they dive ſo far under water, that they
diſappear for a quarter of an hour, or more: the pit into which they are thus
plunged, has been often ſounded with a line of ſome hundred fathoms long,
but no ground has been found hitherto. There is alſo a cataract at
Powerſcourt, in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in which, if I am rightly informed, the water falls
three hundred feet perpendicular; which is a greater deſcent than that of any
other cataract in any part of the world. There is a cataract at Albany, in the
province of New York, which pours its ſtream fifty feet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular. But
of all the cataracts in the <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0823800101:246"/> world, that of Niagara, in
Canada, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the great body of water that falls, muſt be allowed
to be the greateſt, and the moſt aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing.</p>
            <p>This amazing fall of water is made by the river St. Lawrence, in its
paſſage from the lake Erie into the lake Ontario. We have already ſaid
that St. Lawrence was one of the largeſt rivers in the world; and yet the
whole of its waters are here poured down, by a fall of an hundred and fifty
feet perpendicular. It is not eaſy to bring the imagination to correſpond
with the greatneſs of the ſcene; a river, extremely deep and rapid, and
that ſerves to drain the waters of almoſt all North America into the
At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic ocean, is here poured precipitately down a ledge of rocks, that
riſe, like a wall, acroſs the whole bed of its ſtream. The width of the
river, a little above, is near three quarters of a mile broad; and the rocks,
where it grows narrower, are four hundred yards over. Their direction is not
ſtreight acroſs, but hollowing inwards like an horſe-ſhoe; ſo that
the cataract, which bends to the ſhape of the obſtacle, round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwards,
preſents a kind of theatre the moſt tremendous in nature. Juſt in the
middle of this circular wall of waters, a little iſland, that has braved the
fury of the current, preſents one <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0823800101:247"/> of its points, and
divides the ſtream at top into two; but it unites again long before it has
got to the bottom. The noiſe of the fall is heard at ſeveral leagues
diſtance; and the fury of the waters at the bottom of their fall, is
inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The daſhing produces a miſt that riſes to the very
clouds; and that produces a moſt beautiful rainbow, when the ſun ſhines.
It may eaſily be conceived, that ſuch a cataract quite deſtroys the
navigation of the ſtream; and yet ſome Indian canoes, as it is ſaid, have
been known to venture down it with ſafety.</p>
            <p>Of thoſe rivers that loſe themſelves in the ſands, or are
ſwallowed up by chaſms in the earth, we have various information. What we
are told by the ancients, of the river Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus, in Arcadia, that ſinks into
the ground, and riſes again near Syracuſe, in Sicily, where it takes the
name of Arethuſa, is rather more known than credited. But we have better
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation with reſpect to the river Tigris being loſt in this manner
under Mount Taurus; of the Guadalquiver, in Spain, being buried in the ſands;
of the river Greatah, in Yorkſhire, running underground, and riſing again;
and even of the great Rhine itſelf, a part of which is no doubt loſt in the
ſands, a little above Leyden. But it ought to be obſerved of this 
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0823800101:248"/> river, that by much the greateſt part arrives at the
ocean. For, although the ancient channel which fell into the ſea, a little to
the weſt of that city, be now entirely choaked up, yet there are ſtill a
number of ſmall canals, that carry a great body of waters to the ſea: and,
beſides, it has alſo two very large openings, the Lech, and the Wal, below
Rotterdam, by which it empties itſelf abundantly.</p>
            <p>Be this as it will, nothing is more common in ſultry and ſandy
deſerts, than rivers being thus either loſt in the ſands, or entirely
dried up by the ſun. And hence we ſee, that under the Line, the ſmall
rivers are but few; for ſuch little ſtreams as are common in Europe, and
which with us receive the name of rivers, would quickly evaporate, in thoſe
parching and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive deſerts. It is even confidently aſſerted, that
the great river Niger itſelf is thus loſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it reaches the ocean; and
that its ſuppoſed mouths, the Gambia, and the Senegal, are diſtinct
rivers, that come a vaſt way from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior parts of the country. It
appears, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the rivers under the Line are large; but it is
otherwiſe at the Poles<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Krantz's Hiſtory of
Greenland, vol. i. p. 41.</bibl>
               </note>, where they muſt neceſſarily be
ſmall. In that deſolate <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0823800101:249"/> region, as the mountains are
covered with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ice, which melts but little, or not at all, the
ſprings and rivulets are furniſhed with a very ſmall ſupply. Here,
therefore, men and beaſts would periſh, and die for thirſt, if Providence
had not ordered, that in the hardeſt winter, thaws ſhould intervene, which
depoſit a ſmall quantity of ſnow-water in pools under the ice; and from
this ſource the wretched inhabitants drain a ſcanty beverage.</p>
            <p>Thus, whatever quarter of the globe we turn to, we ſhall find new
reaſons to be ſatisfied with that part of it in which we ourſelves
reſide. Our rivers furniſh all the plenty of the African ſtream, without
its inundation; they have all the coolneſs of the Polar rivulet, with a more
conſtant ſupply; they may want the terrible magnificence of huge cataracts,
or extenſive lakes, but they are more navigable, and more tranſparent;
though leſs deep and rapid than the rivers of the torrid zone, they are more
manageable, and only wait the will of man to take their direction. The rivers
of the torrid zone, like the monarchs of the country, rule with deſpotic
tyranny, profuſe in their boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ungovernable in their rage. The
ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Europe, like their kings, are the friends, and not the
oppreſſors of the people; bounded by known limits, abridged in the 
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0823800101:250"/> power of doing ill, directed by human ſagacity, and
only at freedom to diſtribute happineſs and plenty.</p>

            <p>IF we look upon a map of the world, we ſhall find that the ocean
occupies conſiderably more of the globe, than the land is found to do. This
immenſe body of waters is diffuſed round both the Old and New Continent, to
the ſouth; and may ſurround them alſo to the north, for what we know, but
the ice in thoſe regions has ſtopped our enquiries. Although the ocean,
properly ſpeaking, is but one extenſive ſheet of waters, continued over
every part of the globe, without interruption, and although no part of it is
divided from the reſt, yet geographers have diſtinguiſhed it by different
names; as the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic or Weſtern Ocean, the Northern Ocean, the Southern
Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. Others have divided it
differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and given other names; as the Frozen Ocean, the Inferior Ocean,
or the American Ocean. But all theſe being arbitrary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, and not

rivers of the earth ultimately terminate; nor do ſuch great ſupplies ſeem
to encreaſe its ſtores; for it is neither apparently ſwollen by their
tribute, nor diminiſhed by their failure; it ſtill continues the ſame.
Indeed, what is the quantity of water of all the rivers and lakes in the world,
compared to that contained in this great recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 70.</bibl>
               </note>? If we ſhould offer
to make a rude eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, we ſhall find that all the rivers in the world,
flowing into the bed of the ſea, with a continuance of their preſent
ſtores, would take up at leaſt eight hundred years to fill it to its
preſent height. For, ſuppoſing the ſea to be eighty-five millions of
ſquare miles in extent, and a quarter of a mile, upon an average, in depth,
this, upon calculation, will give above twenty-one millions of cubic miles of
water, as the contents of the whole ocean. Now, to eſtimate the quantity of
water which all the rivers ſupply, take any one of them; the Po, for
inſtance, the quantity of whoſe diſcharge into the ſea, is known to be
one cubic mile of water in twenty-ſix days. Now it will be found, upon a rude
computation, from the quantity of ground the Po, with its influent ſtreams,
covers, that all the rivers of the world furniſh about <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0823800101:252"/>
two thouſand times that quantity of water. In the ſpace of a year,
therefore, they will have diſcharged into the ſea about twenty-ſix
thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand cubic miles of water; and not till eight hundred years, will they
have diſcharged as much water as is contained in the ſea at preſent. I
have not troubled the reader with the odd numbers, leſt he ſhould imagine I
was giving preciſion to a ſubject that is incapable of it.</p>
            <p>Thus great is the aſſemblage of waters diffuſed round our
habitable globe; and yet, immeaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as they ſeem, they are moſtly
rendered ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the neceſſities and the conveniencies of ſo
little a being as man. Nevertheleſs, if it ſhould be aſked whether they
be made for him alone, the queſtion is not eaſily reſolved. Some
philoſophers have perceived ſo much analogy to man in the formation of the
ocean, that they have not heſitated to aſſert its being made for him
alone. The diſtribution of land and water<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>, ſay they, is
admirable; the one being laid againſt the other ſo ſkilfully, that there
is a juſt equipoiſe of the whole globe. Thus the Northern ocean balances
againſt the Southern; and the New Continent is an exact counter-weight to the
Old. As to any objection from the ocean's occupying too large a ſhare of 
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0823800101:253"/> the globe, they contend, that there could not have been
a ſmaller ſurface employed to ſupply the earth with a due ſhare of

               </note> what ſeems defects to us, may be real beauties to
ſome wiſer order of beings. They obſerve, that multitudes of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are
concealed in the ocean, and but a ſmall part of them are known; the reſt,
therefore, they fail not to ſay, were certainly made for their own benefit,
and not for ours. How far either of theſe opinions be juſt, I will not
preſume to determine; but of this we are certain, that God has endowed us
with abilities to turn this great extent of waters to our own advantage. He has
made theſe things, perhaps, for other uſes; but he has given us faculties
to convert them to our own. This much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated queſtion, therefore, ſeems
to terminate here. We ſhall never know whether the things of this world have
been made for our uſe; but we very well know, that we have been made to enjoy
them. Let us then boldly affirm, that the earth, and all its wonders, are ours;
ſince we are furniſhed with powers to force them into <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0823800101:254"/> our ſervice. Man is the lord of all the ſublunary creation; the
howling ſavage, the winding ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, with all the untamable and rebellious
off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Nature, are deſtroyed in the conteſt, or driven at a
diſtance from his habitations. The extenſive and tempeſtuous ocean,
inſtead of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting or dividing his power, only ſerves to aſſiſt his
induſtry, and enlarge the ſphere of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments. Its billows, and its
monſters, inſtead of preſenting a ſcene of terror, only call up the
courage of this little intrepid being; and the greateſt dangers that man now
fears on the deep, is from his fellow creatures. Indeed, when I conſider the
human race as Nature has formed them, there is but very little of the habitable
globe that ſeems made for them. But when I conſider them as accumulating
the experience of ages, in commanding the earth, there is nothing ſo great,
or ſo terrible. What a poor contemptible being is the naked ſavage,
ſtanding on the beach of the ocean, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at its tumults! How little
capable is he of converting its terrors into benefits; or of ſaying, behold
an element made wholly for my enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! He conſiders it as an angry deity,
and pays it the homage of ſubmiſſion. But it is very different when he
has exerciſed his mental <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0823800101:255"/> powers; when he has learned
to find his own ſuperiority, and to make it ſubſervient to his commands.
It is then that his dignity begins to appear, and that the true Deity is
juſtly praiſed for having been mindful of man; for having given him the
earth for his habitation, and the ſea for an inheritance.</p>
            <p>This power which man has obtained over the ocean, was at firſt
enjoyed in common; and none pretended to a right in that element where all
ſeemed intruders. The ſea, therefore, was open to all till the time of the
emperor Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian. His ſucceſſor Leo granted ſuch as were in
poſſeſſion of the ſhore, the ſole right of fiſhing before their
reſpective territories. The Thracian Boſphorus was the firſt that was
thus appropriated; and from that time it has been the ſtruggle of moſt of
the powers of Europe to obtain an excluſive right in this element. The
Republic of Venice claims the Adriatic. The Danes are in poſſeſſion of
the Baltic. But the Engliſh have a more extenſive claim to the empire of
all the ſeas, encompaſſing the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of England, Scotland, and
Ireland; and altho' theſe have been long conteſted, yet they are now
conſidered as their indiſputable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. Every one knows that the great
power <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0823800101:256"/> of the nation is exerted on this element; and that
the inſtant England ceaſes to be ſuperior upon the ocean, its ſafety
begins to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious.</p>
            <p>It is in ſome meaſure owing to our depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon the ſea,
and to our commerce there, that we are ſo well acquainted with its extent and
figure. The bays, gulphs, currents, and ſhallows of the ocean, are much
better known and examined than the provinces and kingdoms of the earth
itſelf. The hopes of acquiring wealth by commerce, has carried man to much
greater lengths than the deſire of gaining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation could have done. In
conſequence of this, there is ſcarce a ſtrait or an harbour, ſcarce a
rock or a quickſand, ſcarce an inflexion of the ſhore, or the jutting of
a promontory, that has not been minutely deſcribed. But as theſe preſent
very little entertainment to the imagination, or delight to any but thoſe
whoſe purſuits are lucrative, they need not be dwelt upon here. While the
merchant and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner are ſolicitous in deſcribing currents and
ſoundings, the naturaliſt is employed in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving wonders, though not
ſo beneficial, yet to him of a much more important nature. The ſaltneſs
of the ſea ſeems to be the foremoſt.</p>
            <p>Whence the ſea has derived that peculiar bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh ſaltneſs
which we find in it, appears, by <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0823800101:257"/> Ariſtotle, to have
exerciſed the curioſity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts in all ages. He ſuppoſed (and
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were for ages content with the ſolution) that the ſun continually
raiſed dry ſaline exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations from the earth, and depoſited them upon
the ſea; and hence, ſay his followers, the waters of the ſea are more
ſalt at top than at bottom. But, unfortunately for this opinion, neither of
the facts is true. Sea ſalt is not to be raiſed by the vapours of the
ſun; and ſea water is not ſalter at the top than at the bottom. Father
Bohours is of opinion that the Creator gave the waters of the ocean their
ſaltneſs at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; not only to prevent their corruption, but to
enable them to bear greater burthens. But their ſaltneſs does not prevent
their corruption; for ſtagnant ſea-water, like freſh, ſoon grows
putrid: and, as for their bearing greater bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, freſh water anſwers
all the purpoſes of navigation quite as well. The eſtabliſhed opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
therefore, is that of Boyle<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Boyle, vol. iii. p.
221.</bibl>
               </note>, who ſuppoſes, 
<q rend="inline">"that the ſea's ſaltneſs is ſupplied not
only from rocks or maſſes of ſalt at the bottom of the ſea, but alſo
from the ſalt which the rains and rivers, and other waters, diſſolve in
their paſſage thro' many parts of the earth, and at length carry with them
to the ſea."</q> But as there is a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0823800101:258"/> in the
taſte of rock-ſalt found at land, and that diſſolved in the waters of
the ocean, this may be produced by the plenty of nitrous and bituminous bodies
that, with the ſalts, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe waſhed into that great receptacle.
Theſe ſubſtances being thus once carried to the ſea, muſt for ever
remain there; for they do not riſe by evaporation, ſo as to be returned
back from whence they came. Nothing but the freſh waters of the ſea riſe
in vapours; and all the ſaltneſs remains behind. From hence it follows,
that every year the ſea muſt become more and more ſalt; and this
ſpeculation Doctor Halley carries ſo far as to lay down a method of finding
out the age of the world by the ſaltneſs of its waters. 
<q rend="inline">"For if it be obſerved<note n="*" place="bottom">

"what quantity of ſalt is at preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a certain weight of
water, taken up from the Caſpian Sea, for example, and, after ſome
centuries, what greater quantity of ſalt is contained in the ſame weight of
water, taken from the ſame place; we may conclude, that in proportion as the
ſaltneſs has encreaſed in a certain time, ſo much muſt it have
encreaſed before that time; and we may thus, by the rule of proportion, make
an eſtimate of the whole time wherein the water would acquire the degree 
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0823800101:259"/> of ſaltneſs it ſhould be then poſſeſſed
of."</q> All this may be fine; however, an experiment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in this century,
which is not to be completed till ſome centuries hence, is rather a little
mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying to modern curioſity: and, I am induced to think, the inhabitants
round the Caſpian ſea, will not be apt to undertake the enquiry.</p>
            <p>This ſaltneſs is found to prevail in every part of the ocean;
and as much at the ſurface, as at the bottom. It is alſo found in all
thoſe ſeas that communicate with the ocean; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a leſs
degree.</p>
            <p>The great lakes, likewiſe, that have no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets nor communication
with the ocean, are found to be ſalt; but ſome of them in leſs
proportion. On the contrary, all thoſe lakes through which rivers run into
the ſea, however extenſive they be, are, notwithſtanding, very freſh:
for the rivers do not depoſit their ſalts in the bed of the lake, but carry
them, with their currents, into the ocean. Thus the lakes Ontario and Erie, in
North America, although for mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude they may be conſidered as inland
ſeas, are, nevertheleſs, freſh water lakes; and kept ſo by the river
St. Lawrence, which paſſes through them. But thoſe lakes that have no
communication with the ſea, nor any rivers going out, although they be leſs
than the <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0823800101:260"/> former, are, however, always ſalt. Thus, that
which goes by the name of the Dead Sea, tho' very ſmall, when compared to
thoſe already mentioned, is ſo exceedingly ſalt, that its waters ſeem
ſcarce capable of diſſolving any more. The lakes of Mexico, and of
Titicaca, in Peru, though of no great extent, are, nevertheleſs ſalt; and
both for the ſame reaſon.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are willing to turn all things to the beſt, have not
failed to conſider this ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſea, as a peculiar
bleſſing from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in order to keep ſo great an element ſweet
and wholſome. What foundation there may be in the remark, I will not pretend
to determine; but we ſhall ſhortly find a much better cauſe for its being
kept ſweet, namely by its motion.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, there have been many who have conſidered the
ſubject in a different light, and have tried every endeavour to make
ſalt-water freſh, ſo as to ſupply the wants of mariners in long
voyages, or when exhauſted of their ordinary ſtores. At firſt it was
ſuppoſed ſimple diſtillation would do; but it was ſoon found that the
bitter part of the water ſtill kept mixed. It was then tried by uniting
ſalt of Tartar with ſea-water, and diſtilling both: but here the expence
was greater than the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Calcined bones were next thought 
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0823800101:261"/> of; but an hogſhead of calcined bones, carried to
ſea, would take up as much room as an hogſhead of water, and was more hard
to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. In this ſtate, therefore, have the attempts to ſweeten
ſea-water reſted; the chymiſt ſatisfied with the reality of his
invention; and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner convinced of its being uſeleſs. I cannot,
therefore, avoid mentioning a kind of ſucceda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum which has been lately
conceived to anſwer the purpoſes of freſh-water, when mariners are quite
exhauſted. It is well known, that perſons who go into a warm bath, come out
ſeveral ounces heavier than they went in; their bodies having imbibed a
correſpondent quantity of water. This more particularly happens, if they have
been previouſly debarred from drinking, or go in with a violent thirſt;
which they quickly find quenched, and their ſpirits reſtored. It was
ſuppoſed, that in caſe of a total failure of freſh-water at ſea, a
warm bath might be made of ſea-water, for the uſe of mariners; and that
their pores would thus imbibe the fluid, without any of its ſalts, which
would be ſeen to cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallize on the ſurface of their bodies. In this
manner, it is ſuppoſed, a ſufficient quantity of moiſture may be
procured to ſuſtain life, till time or accident furniſh a more copious
ſupply.</p>
            <p>But, however this be, the ſaltneſs of the ſea 
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0823800101:262"/> can by no means be conſidered as a principal cauſe
in preſerving its waters from putrefaction. The ocean has its currents, like
rivers, which circulate its contents round the globe; and theſe may be ſaid
to be the great agents that keep it ſweet and wholſome. Its ſaltneſs
alone would by no means anſwer this purpoſe: and ſome have even imagined,
that the various ſubſtances with which it is mixed, rather tend to promote
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſence than impede it. Sir Robert Hawkins, one of our moſt enlightened
navigators, gives the following account of a calm, in which the ſea
continuing for ſome time without motion, began to aſſume a very
formidable appearance. 
<q rend="inline">"Were it not," ſays he, "for the moving of the
ſea, by the force of winds, tides, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, it would corrupt all the
world. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of this I ſay in the year 1590, lying with a fleet
about the iſlands of Azores, almoſt ſix months; the greateſt part of
which time we were becalmed. Upon which all the ſea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo
repleniſhed with ſeveral ſorts of gellies, and forms of ſerpents,
adders, and ſnakes, as ſeemed wonderful: ſome green, ſome black, ſome
yellow, ſome white, ſome of divers colours, and many of them had life; and
ſome there were an yard and an half, and two yards long; which had I not
ſeen, I could hardly have <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0823800101:263"/> believed. And hereof are
witneſſes all the company of the ſhips which were then preſent: ſo
that hardly a man could draw a bucket of water clear of ſome corruption. In
which voyage, towards the end thereof, many of every ſhip fell ſick, and
began to die apace. But the ſpeedy paſſage into our country, was a remedy
to the craz'd, and a preſervative for thoſe that were not touched."</q>
            </p>
            <p>This ſhews, abundantly, how little the ſea's ſaltneſs was
capable of preſerving it from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction: but to put the matter beyond all
doubt, Mr. Boyle kept a quantity of ſea-water, taken up in the Engliſh
channel, for ſome time barrelled up; and, in the ſpace of a few weeks, it
began to acquire a foetid ſmell<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Boyle, vol.
iii. p. 222.</bibl>
               </note>: He was alſo aſſured, by one of his
acquaintance who was becalmed for twelve or fourteen days in the Indian ſea,
that the water, for want of motion, began to ſtink; and that had it continued
much longer, the ſtench would probably have poiſoned him. It is the motion,
therefore, and not the ſaltneſs of the ſea, that preſerves it in its
preſent ſtate of ſalubrity; and this, very probably, by daſhing and
breaking in pieces the rudiments, if I may ſo call them, of the various
animals that would otherwiſe breed there, and puterfy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0823800101:264"/>There are ſome advantages, however, which
are derived from the ſaltneſs of the ſea. Its waters being evaporated,
furniſh that ſalt which is uſed for domeſtic purpoſes; and, although
in ſome places it is made from ſprings, and, in others, dug out of mines,
yet the greateſt quantity is made only from the ſea. That which is called
bay-ſalt, (from its coming to us by the Bay of Biſcay) is a ſtronger
kind, made by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration in the ſun: that called common ſalt, is
evaporated in pans over the fire, and is of a much inferior quality to the
former.</p>
            <p>Another benefit ariſing from the quantity of ſalt diſſolved
in the ſea, is, that it thus becomes heavier, and, conſequently, more
buoyant. Mr. Boyle, who examined the difference between ſea-water and
freſh, found that the former appeared to be about a forty-fifth part heavier
than the latter. Thoſe, alſo, who have had opportunities of bathing in the
ſea, pretend to have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced a much greater eaſe in ſwimming there,
than in freſh water. However, as we ſee they have only a forty-fifth part
more of their weight ſuſtained by it, I am apt to doubt whether ſo minute
a difference can be practically per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable. Be this as it may, as ſea-water
alters in its weight from freſh, ſo it is found alſo to differ from
itſelf in different parts of the ocean. <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0823800101:265"/> In general, it
is perceived to be heavier, and, conſequently, ſalter, the nearer we
approach the Line<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>.</p>
            <p>But there is an advantage ariſing from the ſaltneſs of the
waters of the ſea, much greater than what has been yet mentioned; which is,
that their congelation is thus retarded. Some, indeed, have gone ſo far as to
ſay, that 
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Macrobius.</bibl>
               </note>
ſea-water never freezes: but this is an aſſertion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by
experience. However, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that it requires a much greater degree of
cold to freeze it, than freſh water; ſo that, while rivers and ſprings
are ſeen converted into one ſolid body of ice, the ſea is always fit for
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, and no way affected by the coldneſs of the ſevereſt winter.
It is, therefore, one of the greateſt bleſſings we derive from this
element, that when at land all the ſtores of Nature are locked up from us, we
find the ſea ever open to our neceſſities, and patient of the hand of
induſtry.</p>
            <p>But it muſt not be ſuppoſed, becauſe in our temperate
climate we never ſee the ſea frozen, that it is in the ſame manner open
in every part of it. A very little acquaintance with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of mariners,
muſt have informed us, that at the polar regions it is embarraſſed with
moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0823800101:266"/> and moving ſheets of ice, that often
ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it impaſſable. Theſe tremendous floats are of different
magnitudes; ſometimes riſing more than a thouſand feet above the
ſurface of the water<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>; ſometimes diffuſed into plains of
above two hundred leagues in length; and, in many parts, ſixty or eighty
broad. They are uſually divided by fiſſures; one piece following another
ſo cloſe, that a perſon may ſtep from one to the other. Sometimes
mountains are ſeen riſing amidſt theſe plains, and preſenting the
appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a variegated landſcape, with hills and valleys, houſes,
churches, and towers. Theſe are appearances in which all naturaliſts are
agreed; but the great conteſt is reſpecting their formation. Mr. Buffon

91.</bibl>
               </note>, that they are formed from freſh water alone; which
congealing at the mouths of great rivers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulate thoſe huge maſſes
that diſturb navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. However, this great naturaliſt ſeems not to
have been aware that there are two ſorts of ice floating in theſe ſeas;
the flat ice, and the mountain ice: the one formed of ſea-water only; the
other, of freſh<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Krantz.</bibl>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>The flat, or driving ice, is entirely compoſed 
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0823800101:267"/> of ſea-water; which, upon diſſolution, is found to
be ſalt; and is readily diſtinguiſhed from the mountain or freſh-water
ice, by its whiteneſs, and want of tranſparency. This ice is much more
terrible to mariners than that which riſes up in lumps: a ſhip can avoid
the one, as it is ſeen at a diſtance; but it often gets in among the other,
which ſometimes cloſing, cruſhes it to pieces. This, which manifeſtly
has a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent origin from the freſh-water ice, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been
produced in the Icy Sea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Pole; or along the coaſts of
Spitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, or Nova Zembla.</p>
            <p>The mountain-ice, as was ſaid, is different in every reſpect,
being formed of freſh water, and appearing hard and tranſparent; it is
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of a pale green colour, though ſome pieces are of a beautiful
ſky blue; many large maſſes, alſo, appear grey; and ſome black. If
examined more nearly, they are found to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated with earth, ſtones,
and bruſh-wood waſhed from the ſhore. On theſe alſo, are ſometimes
found, not only earth, but neſts with birds eggs, at ſeveral hundred miles
from land. The generality of theſe, though almoſt totally freſh, have,
nevertheleſs, a thick cruſt of ſalt-water frozen upon them, probably from
the power that ice has ſometimes to produce ice. <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0823800101:268"/> Such
mountains as are here deſcribed, are moſt uſually ſeen at
ſpring-time, and after a violent ſtorm, driving out to ſea, where they at
firſt terrify the mariner, and are ſoon after daſhed to pieces by the
continual waſhing of the waves; or driven into the warmer regions of the
ſouth, there to be melted away. They ſometimes, however, ſtrike back upon
their native ſhores, where they ſeem to take root at the feet of mountains;
and, as Martius tells us, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times higher than the mountains
themſelves. Thoſe ſeen by him were blue, full of clefts and cavities made
by the rain, and crowned with ſnow, which alternately thawing and freezing
every year, augmented their ſize. Theſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of materials more
ſolid than that driving at ſea, preſented a variety of agreeable figures
to the eye, that, with a little help from fancy, aſſumed the appearance of
trees in bloſſom; the inſide of churches, with arches, pillars, and
windows; and the blue coloured rays, darting from within, preſented the
reſemblance of a glory.</p>
            <p>If we enquire into the origin and formation of theſe, which, as we
ſee, are very different from the former, I think we have a very
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory account of them in Krantz's Hiſtory <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0823800101:269"/> of
Greenland; and I will take leave to give the paſſage, with a very few
alterations. 
<q rend="inline">"Theſe mountains of ice," ſays he, "are not
ſalt, like the ſea-water, but ſweet; and, therefore, can be formed no
where except on the mountains, in rivers, in caverns, and againſt the hills
near the ſea-ſhore. The mountains of Greenland are ſo high, that the
ſnow which falls upon them, particularly on the north ſide, is, in one
night's time, wholly converted into ice: they alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain clefts and
cavities, where the ſun ſeldom or never injects his rays: beſides
theſe, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, or landing-places, on the declivities of the
ſteepeſt hills, where the rain and ſnow-water lodge, and quickly congeal.
When now the accumulated flakes of ſnow ſlide down, or fall with the rain
from the eminences above, on theſe prominences; or, when here and there a
mountain-ſpring comes rolling down to ſuch a lodging place, where the ice
has already ſeated itſelf, they all freeze, and add their tribute to it.
This, by degrees, waxes to a body of ice, that can no more be overpowered by
the ſun; and which, though it may indeed, at certain ſeaſons, diminiſh
by a thaw, yet, upon the whole, through annual acquiſitions, it aſſumes
an annual growth. Such a body of ice is often prominent far over 
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0823800101:270"/> the rocks. It does not melt on the upper ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, but
underneath; and alſo cracks into many larger or ſmaller clefts, from whence
the thawed water trickles out. By this it becomes, at laſt, ſo weak, that
being overloaded with its own ponderous bulk, it breaks looſe, and tumbles
down the rocks with a terrible craſh. Where it happens to overhang a
precipice on the ſhore, it plunges into the deep with a ſhock like
thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and with ſuch an agitation of the water, as will overſet a boat
at ſome diſtance, as many a poor Greenlander has fatally experienced."</q>
Thus are theſe amazing ice mountains launched forth to ſea, and found
floating in the waters round both the Poles. It is theſe that have hindered
mariners from diſcovering the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive countries that lie round the South
Pole; and that probably block up the paſſage to China by the North.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this chapter with one effect more, produced by the
ſaltneſs of the ſea; which is, the luminous appearance of its waves in
the night. All who have been ſpectators of a ſea by night, a little ruffled
with winds, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fail of obſerving its fiery brightneſs. In 
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Boyle, vol. i. p. 294.</bibl>
               </note>
ſome places it ſhines as far as the eye can reach; <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0823800101:271"/>
at other times, only when the waves boom againſt the ſide of the
veſſel, or the oar daſhes into the water. Some ſeas ſhine often;
others more ſeldom; ſome, ever when particular winds blow; and others,
within a narrow compaſs; a long tract of light being ſeen along the
ſurface, whilſt all the reſt is hid in total darkneſs. It is not eaſy
to account for theſe extraordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances: ſome have ſuppoſed
that a number of luminous inſects produced the effect, and this is in reality
ſometimes the caſe; in general, however, they have every reſemblance to
that light produced by electricity; and, probably, ariſe from the agitation
and daſhing of the ſaline particles of the fluid againſt each other. But
the manner in which this is done, for we can produce nothing ſimilar, by any
experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hitherto made, remains for ſome happier accident to diſcover.
Our progreſs in the knowledge of nature is ſlow; and it is a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
conſideration, that we are hitherto more indebted for ſucceſs to chance
than induſtry.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XVII. Of the Tides, Motion, and Currents of the Sea; with
their Effects.</head>
            <p>IT was ſaid in the former chapter, that the waters of the ſea
were kept ſweet by their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; without which they would ſoon putrefy,
and ſpread univerſal infection. If we look for final cauſes, here,
indeed, we have a great and an obvious one that preſents itſelf before us.
Had the ſea been made without motion, and reſembling a pool of ſtagnant
water, the nobler races of animated nature would ſhortly be at an end.
Nothing would then be left alive but ſwarms of ill formed creatures, with
ſcarce more than vegetable life; and ſubſiſting by putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Were
this extenſive bed of waters entirely quieſcent, millions of the ſmaller
reptile kinds would there find a proper retreat to breed and multiply in; they
would find there no agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, no concuſſion in the parts of the fluid to
cruſh their feeble frames, or to force them from the places where they were
bred: there they would multiply in ſecurity and eaſe, enjoy a ſhort life,
and, putrefying, thus again give nouriſhment to numberleſs others, as
little <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0823800101:273"/> worthy of exiſtence as themſelves. But the
motion of this great element, effectually deſtroys the number of theſe
viler creatures; its currents, and its tides, produce continual agitations, the
ſhock of which they are not able to endure; the parts of the fluid rub
againſt each other, deſtroy all viſcidities; and the ocean, if I may ſo
expreſs it, acquires health by exerciſe.</p>
            <p>The moſt obvious motion of the ſea, and the moſt generally
acknowledged, is that of its tides. This element is obſerved to flow for
certain hours, from ſouth towards north; in which motion or flux, which
laſts about ſix hours, the ſea gradually ſwells; ſo that entering the
mouths of rivers, it drives back the river waters to their heads. After a
continual flux of ſix hours, the ſea ſeems to reſt for a quarter of an
hour; and then begins to ebb, or retire back again, from north to ſouth, for
ſix hours more; in which time the waters ſinking, the rivers reſume their
natural courſe. After a ſeeming pauſe of a quarter of an hour, the ſea
again begins to flow as before: and thus it has alternately riſen and fallen,
twice a day, ſince the creation.</p>
            <p>This amazing appearance did not fail to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the curioſity, as
it did the wonder of the ancients. After ſome wild conjectures of the 
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0823800101:274"/> earlieſt philoſophers, it became well known, in the
times of Pliny, that the tides were entirely under the influence, in a ſmall
degree, of the ſun; but in a much greater of the moon. It was found that
there was a flux and reflux of the ſea, in the ſpace of twelve hours fifty
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, which is exactly the time of a lunar day. It was obſerved, that
whenever the moon was in the meridian, or, in other words, as nearly as
poſſible over any part of the ſea, that the ſea flowed to that part,
and made a tide there; on the contrary, it was found, that when the moon left
the meridian, the ſea began to flow back again from whence it came; and there
might be ſaid to ebb. Thus far the waters of the ſea ſeemed very
regularly to attend the motions of the moon. But as it appeared, likewiſe,
that when the moon was in the oppoſite meridian, as far off as poſſible
on the other ſide of the globe, that there was a tide on this ſide alſo;
ſo that the moon produced two tides, one by her greateſt approach to us,
and another by her greateſt diſtance from us: in other words, the moon, in
once going round the earth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced two tides, always at the ſame time; one
on the part of the globe directly under her; and the other, on the part of the
globe directly oppoſite.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0823800101:275"/>Mankind continued for ſeveral ages content
with knowing the general cauſe of theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, hopeleſs of
diſcovering the particular manner of the moon's operation. Kepler was the
firſt who conjectured that attraction was the principal cauſe;
aſſerting, that the ſphere of the moon's operation extended to the earth,
and drew up its waters. The preciſe manner in which this is done, was
diſcovered by Newton.</p>
            <p>The moon has been found, like all the reſt of the planets, to
attract, and to be attracted by the earth. This attraction prevails throughout
our whole planetary ſyſtem. The more matter there is contained in any body,
the more it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts: and its influence decreaſes in proportion as the
diſtance, when ſquared, encreaſes. This being premiſed, let us ſee
what muſt enſue upon ſuppoſing the moon in the meridian of any tract of
the ſea. The ſurface of the water im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately under the moon, is nearer
the moon than any other part of the globe is; and, therefore, muſt be more
ſubject to its attraction than the waters any where elſe. The waters will,
therefore, be attracted by the moon, and riſe in an heap; whoſe eminence
will be the higheſt where the attraction is greateſt. In order to form this
eminence, it is obvious that <pb n="253" facs="tcp:0823800101:276"/> the ſurface, as well as
the depths, will be agitated; and that wherever the water runs from one part,
ſucceeding waters muſt run to fill up the ſpace it has left. Thus the
waters of the ſea, running from all parts, to attend the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the
moon, produce the flowing of the tide; and it is high tide at that part
wherever the moon comes over it, or into its meridian.</p>
            <p>But when the moon travels onward, and ceaſes to point over the
place where the waters were juſt riſen, the cauſe here of their riſing
ceaſing to operate, they will flow back by their natural gravity, into the
lower parts from whence they had travelled; and this retiring of the waters
will form the ebbing of the ſea.</p>
            <p>Thus the firſt part of the demonſtration is obvious; ſince, in
general, it requires no great ſagacity to conceive that the waters neareſt
the moon are moſt attracted, or raiſed higheſt by the moon. But the other
part of the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, namely, how there come to be high tides at the
ſame time, on the oppoſite ſide of the globe, and where the waters are
fartheſt from the moon, is not ſo eaſy to conceive. To comprehend this,
it muſt be obſerved, that the part of the earth, and its waters, that are
fartheſt from the moon, are the parts of all others that 
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0823800101:277"/> are leaſt attracted by the moon: it muſt alſo be
obſerved, that all the waters, when the moon is on the oppoſite ſide of
the earth, muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by it in the ſame direction that the earth
itſelf attracts them; that is, if I may ſo ſay, quite through the body of
the earth, towards the moon itſelf. This, therefore, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, it is
plain that thoſe waters which are fartheſt from the moon, will have leſs
weight than thoſe of any other part, on the ſame ſide of the globe;
becauſe the moon's attraction, which conſpires with the earth's attraction,
is there leaſt. Now, therefore, the waters fartheſt from the moon, having
leſs weight, and being lighteſt, will be preſſed on all ſides, by
thoſe that, having more attraction, are heavier: they will be preſſed, I
ſay, on all ſides; and the heavier waters flowing in, will make them
ſwell and riſe in an eminence directly oppoſite to that on the other
ſide of the globe, cauſed by the more immediate influence of the moon.</p>
            <p>In this manner the moon, in one diurnal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, produces two
tides; one raiſed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately under the ſphere of its influence, and the
other directly oppoſite to it. As the moon travels, this vaſt body of
waters rears upward, as if to watch its motions; and purſues the ſame
conſtant rotation. However, in this great work <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0823800101:278"/> of
raiſing the tides, the ſun has no ſmall ſhare; it produces its own
tides conſtantly every day, juſt as the moon does, but in a much leſs
degree, becauſe the ſun is at an immenſely greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Thus
there are ſolar tides, and lunar tides. When the forces of theſe two great
lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries concur, which they always do when they are either in the ſame, or
in oppoſite parts of the heavens, they jointly produce a much greater tide,
than when they are ſo ſituated in the heavens, as each to make peculiar
tides of their own. To expreſs the very ſame thing technically; in the
conjunctions and oppoſitions of the ſun and moon, the attraction of the
ſun conſpires with the attraction of the moon; by which means the high
ſpring-tides are formed. But in the quadratures of the ſun and moon, the
water raiſed by the one is depreſſed by the other; and hence the lower
neap tides have their production. In a word, the tides are greateſt in the
ſyzigies, and leaſt in the quadratures.</p>
            <p>This theory well underſtood, and the aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical terms
previouſly known, it may readily be brought to explain the various
appearances of the tides, if the earth were covered with a deep ſea, and the
waters uninfluenced by ſhoals, currents, ſtraits, or tempeſts. But in
every part of the ſea, near the ſhores, the geographer 
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0823800101:279"/> muſt come in to correct the calculations of the
aſtronomer. For, by reaſon of the ſhallowneſs of ſome places, and the
narrowneſs of the ſtraits in others, there ariſes a great diverſity in
the effect, not to be accounted for without an exact knowledge of all the
circumſtances of the place. In the great depths of the ocean, for inſtance,
a very ſlow and imperceptible motion of the whole body of water will
ſuffice to raiſe its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face ſeveral feet high; but if the ſame
encreaſe of water is to be conveyed through a narrow channel, it muſt
ruſh through it with the moſt impetuous rapidity. Thus in the Engliſh
channel, and the German ocean, the tide is found to flow ſtrongeſt in
thoſe places that are narroweſt; the ſame quantity of water being, in
this caſe, to be driven through a ſmaller paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. It is often ſeen,
therefore, pouring through a ſtreight with great force; and, by its rapidity,
conſiderably raiſed above the ſurface of that part of the ocean into
which it runs.</p>
            <p>This ſhallowneſs and narrowneſs in many parts of the ſea,
give alſo riſe to a peculiarity in the tides of ſome parts of the world.
For in many places, and in our own ſeas in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the greateſt
ſwell of the tide is not while the moon is at its meridian height, and
directly over the place, but ſome time after it <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0823800101:280"/> has
declined from thence. The ſea, in this caſe, being obſtructed, purſues
the moon with what diſpatch it can, but does not arrive with all its waters
till long after the moon has ceaſed to operate. Laſtly, from this
ſhallowneſs of the ſea, and from its being obſtructed by ſhoals and
ſtreights, we may account for the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the Black
Sea, having no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible tides. Theſe, though to us they ſeem very
extenſive, are not however large enough to be affected by the influence of
the moon; and as to their communication with the ocean, that is through ſuch
narrow inlets, that it is impoſſible in a few hours time that they ſhould
receive and return water enough to raiſe or depreſs them in any
conſiderable degree.</p>
            <p>In general, therefore, we may obſerve, that all tides are much
higher, and more conſiderable in the torrid zone, than in the reſt of the
ocean; the ſea in thoſe parts being generally deeper, and leſs affected
by changeable winds, or winding ſhores<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon,
vol. ii. p. 187.</bibl>
               </note>. The greateſt tide we know of, is that at the
mouth of the river Indus, where the water riſes thirty feet in height. How
great, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, muſt have been the amazement of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander's ſoldiers at
ſo ſtrange an appearance! They who always before had been accuſtomed 
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0823800101:281"/> only to the ſcarcely perceptible riſings of the
Mediterranean, or the minute intumeſcence of the Black Sea, when made at once
ſpectators of a river riſing and falling thirty feet in a few hours, muſt
no doubt have felt the moſt extreme awe, and, as we are told<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Quintius Curtius.</bibl>
               </note>, a mixture of
curioſity and apprehenſion. The tides are alſo remarkably high on the
coaſts of Malay, in the ſtreights of Sunda, in the Red Sea, at the mouth of
the river St. Lawrence, along the coaſts of China and Japan, at Panama, and
in the gulph of Bengal. The tides at Tonquin, however, are the moſt
remarkable in the world. In this part there is but one tide, and one ebb, in
twenty-four hours; whereas, as we have ſaid before, in other places there are
two. Beſides, there, twice in each month there is no tide at all, when the
moon is near the equinoctial, the water being for ſome time quite ſtagnant.
Theſe, with ſome other odd appearances attending the ſame phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena,
were conſidered by many as inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; but Sir Iſaac Newton, with
peculiar ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity, adjudged them to ariſe from the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of two
tides, one from the South Sea, and the other from the Indian Ocean. Of each of
theſe tides there come ſucceſſively two every day; two at one time
greater, and two at another <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0823800101:282"/> that are leſs. The time
between the arrival of the two greater, is conſidered by him as high tide;
the time between the two leſſer, as ebb. In ſhort, with this clue, that
great mathematician ſolved every appearance, and ſo eſtabliſhed his
theory as to ſilence every oppoſer.</p>
            <p>This fluctuation of the ſea from the tides, produces another, and
more conſtant rotation of its waters, from the eaſt to the weſt, in this
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect following the courſe of the moon. This may be conſidered as one
great and general current of the waters of the ſea; and although it be not
every where diſtinguiſhable, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs every where exiſtent,
except when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by ſome particular current or eddy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by
partial and local cauſes. This ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the ſea towards the weſt, is
plainly perceivable in all the great ſtreights of the ocean; as, for
inſtance, in thoſe of Magellan; where the tide running in from the eaſt,
riſes twenty feet high, and continues flowing ſix hours; whereas the ebb
continues but two hours, and the current is directed to the weſt. This proves
that the flux is not equal to the reflux; and that from both reſults a motion
of the ſea weſtward, which is more powerful during the time of the flux
than the reflux.</p>
            <p>But this motion weſtward has been ſenſibly 
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0823800101:283"/> obſerved by navigators, in their paſſage back from
India to Madagaſcar, and ſo on to Africa. In the great Pacific Ocean
alſo, it is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable: but the places where it is moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
are, as was ſaid, in thoſe ſtreights which join one ocean to another. In
the ſtreights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Maldivia iſlands, in the gulph of Mexico,
between Cuba and Jucatan. In the ſtreights of the gulph of Paria, the motion
is ſo violent that it hath received the appellation of the Dragon's Mouth.
Northward, in the ſea of Canada, in Waigat's ſtreights, in the ſtreights
of Java, and, in ſhort, in every ſtreight where the ocean on one part pours
into the ocean on the other. In this manner, therefore, is the ſea carried
with an unceaſing circulation round the globe; and, at the ſame time that
its waters are puſhed back and forward with the tide, they have thus a
progreſſive current to the weſt, which, though leſs obſervable, is
not the leſs real.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe two general motions of the ſea, there are others
which are particular to many parts of it, and are called currents. Theſe are
found to run in all directions, eaſt, weſt, north, and ſouth; being
formed, as was ſaid above, by various cauſes; the prominence of the
ſhores, the narrowneſs of the ſtreigths, the variations of 
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0823800101:284"/> the wind, and the inequalities at the bottom. Theſe,
though no great object to the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, as their cauſes are generally
local and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, are nevertheleſs of the moſt material con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to
the mariner; and, without a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which, he could never ſucceed. It
often has happened, that when a ſhip has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowingly got into one of
theſe, every thing ſeems to go forward with ſucceſs, the mariners
ſuppoſe themſelves every hour approaching their wiſh'd-for port, the
wind fills their ſails, and the ſhip's prow ſeems to divide the water;
but, at laſt, by miſerable experience they find, that inſtead of going
forward, they have been all the time receding. The buſineſs of currents,
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, makes a conſiderable article in navigation; and the direction of
their ſtream, and their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, has been carefully ſet down. This ſome
do by the obſervation of the ſurface of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; or by the driving of
the froth along the ſhore; or by throwing out what is called the log-line,
with a buoy made for that purpoſe, and by the direction and motion of this,
they judge of the ſetting, and the rapidity of the current.</p>
            <p>Theſe currents are generally found to be moſt violent under the
equator, where indeed all the motions of the ocean are moſt perceivable. 
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0823800101:285"/> Along the coaſts of Guinea, if a ſhip happens to
overſhoot the mouth of any river it is bound to, the current prevents its
return; ſo that it is obliged to ſteer out to ſea, and take a very large
compaſs, in order to correct the former miſtake. Theſe ſet in a
contrary direction to the general motion of the ſea weſtward; and that ſo
ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a paſſage which with the current is gone in two days, is
with difficulty performed in ſix weeks againſt it. However, they do not
extend above twenty leagues from the coaſt; and ſhips going to the
Eaſt-Indies, take care not to come within the ſphere of their action. At
Sumatra, the currents, which are extremely rapid, run from ſouth to north:
there are alſo ſtrong cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents between Madagaſcar and the Cape of Good
Hope. On the weſtern coaſts of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, the current always runs from the
ſouth to the north, where a ſouth wind, continually blowing, moſt
probably occaſions this phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena. But the currents that are moſt
remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, are thoſe continually flowing into the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean ſea,
both from the ocean by the ſtreights of Gibraltar, and at its other
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, from the Euxine ſea by the Archipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lago. This is one of the
moſt extraordinary appearances in nature, this large ſea receiving not only
the numerous rivers that fall into it, <pb n="263" facs="tcp:0823800101:286"/> ſuch as the
Nile, the Rhone, and the Po, but alſo a very great influx from the Euxine
ſea on one part, and the ocean on the other. At the ſame time, it is ſeen
to return none of thoſe waters it is thus known to receive: outlets run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from it there are none; no rivers but ſuch as bring it freſh ſupplies; no
ſtreights but what are conſtantly pouring their waters into it: it has
therefore been the wonder of mankind in every age, how, and by what means this
vaſt concourſe of waters are diſpoſed of; or how this ſea, which is
always receiving, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, is no way fuller than before. In order
to account for this, ſome have ſaid, that the water was re-conveyed by
ſubterraneous paſſages into the Red Sea<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Kircher Mund. Subt. vol. i.</bibl>
               </note>. There is a
ſtory told of an Arabian califf, who caught a dolphin in this ſea,
admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beauty of which, he let it go again, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing previouſly marked
it by a ring of iron. Some time after a dolphin was caught in the Red Sea, and
quickly known by the ring to be the ſame that had been taken in the
Mediterranean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Such, however, as have not been willing to found their
opinions upon a ſtory, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to account for the diſpoſal of the
waters of the Mediterranean by evaporation. For this purpoſe they have
entered into long calculations <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0823800101:287"/> upon the extent of its
ſurface, and the quantity of water that would be raiſed from ſuch a
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face in a year. They then compute how much water runs in by its rivers
and ſtreights in that time; and find, that the quantity exhauſted by
evaporation, greatly exceeds the quantity ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by rivers and ſeas. And
this ſolution, no doubt would be ſatisfactory, did not the ocean, and the
Euxine, evaporate as well as the Mediterranean: and as theſe are ſubject to
the ſame drain, it muſt follow, that all the ſeas will in this reſpect
be upon a par; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there muſt be ſome other cauſe for this
unperceived drain, and continual ſupply. This ſeems to be ſatisfactorily
enough accounted for by Doctor Smith, who ſuppoſes an under current running
through the ſtreights of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar to carry out as much water into the
ocean, as the upper current continually carries in from it. To confirm this, he
obſerves, that nearer home, between the north and ſouth foreland, the tide
is known to run one way at top, and the ebb another way at bottom. This double
cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent he alſo confirms by an experiment commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to him by an able
ſeaman, who being with one of the king's frigates in the Baltic, found he
went with his boat into the mid-ſtream, and was carried violently by the
current; upon which a baſket was ſunk, with a large cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball, 
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0823800101:288"/> to a certain depth of water, which gave a check to the
boat's motion; as the baſket ſunk ſtill lower, the boat was driven, by
the force of the water below, againſt the upper current; and the lower the
baſket was let down, the ſtronger the under current was found, and the
quicker was the boat's motion againſt the upper ſtream, which ſeemed not
to be above four fathom deep. From hence we may readily infer, that the ſame
cauſe may operate at the ſtreights of Gibraltar; and that while the
Mediterranean ſeems repleniſhing at top, it may be emptying at bottom.</p>
            <p>The number of the currents at ſea are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be
recounted, nor indeed are they always known; new ones are daily produced by a
variety of cauſes, and as quickly diſappear. When a regular current is
oppoſed by another in a narrow ſtreight, or where the bottom of the ſea
is very uneven, a whirlpool is often formed. Theſe were formerly conſidered
as the moſt formidable obſtructions to navigation, and the ancient poets
and hiſtorians ſpeak of them with terror; they are deſcribed as
ſwallowing up ſhips, and daſhing them againſt the rocks at the bottom:
apprehenſion did not fail to add ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary terrors to the deſcription, and
placed at the center of the whirlpool a dreadful den, <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0823800101:289"/>
fraught with monſters whoſe howlings ſerved to add new horrors to the
daſhings of the deep. Mankind at preſent, however, view theſe eddies of
the ſea with very little apprehenſion; and ſome have wondered how the
ancients could have ſo much overcharged their deſcriptions. But all this is
very naturally accounted for. In thoſe times when navigation was as yet but
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and the ſlighteſt concuſſion of the waves generally ſent
the poor adventurer to the bottom, it is not to be wondered at that he was
terrified at the violent agitations in one of theſe. When his little ſhip,
but ill fitted for oppoſing the fury of the ſea, was got within the vortex,
there was then no poſſibility of ever returning. To add to the fatality,
they were always near the ſhore; and along the ſhore was the only place
where this ill provided mariner durſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſail. Theſe were,
therefore, dreadful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to his navigation; for if he attempted to
paſs between them and the ſhore, he was ſometimes ſucked in by the
eddy; and if he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to avoid them out at ſea, he was often ſunk by
the ſtorm. But in our time, and in our preſent improved ſtate of
navigation, Charyb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, and the Euripus, with all the other irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular currents
of the Mediterranean, are no longer formidable. Mr. Addiſon not attending 
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0823800101:290"/> to this train of thinking, upon paſſing through the
ſtreights of Sicily, was ſurpriſed at the little there was of terror in
the preſent appearance of Sylla and Charybdis; and ſeems to be of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that their agitations are much diminiſhed ſince the times of antiquity. In
fact, from the reaſons above, all the wonders of the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean ſea are
deſcribed in much higher colours than they merit, to us who are acquainted
with the more magnificent terrors of the ocean. The Mediterranean is one of the
ſmootheſt and moſt gentle ſeas in the world; its tides are ſcarce
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, except in the gulph of Venice, and ſhipwrecks are leſs known
there than in any other part of the world.</p>
            <p>It is in the ocean, therefore, that theſe whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pools are
particularly dangerous, where the tides are violent, and the tempeſts fierce.
To mention only one, that called the Maelſtroom, upon the coaſts of Norway,
which is conſidered as the moſt dreadful and voracious in the world. The
name it has received from the natives, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the navel of the ſea,
ſince they ſuppoſe that a great ſhare of the water of the ſea is
ſucked up and diſcharged by its vortex. A minute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the
internal parts is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, ſince none who were there ever
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to bring back information. The body <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0823800101:291"/> of the
waters that form this whirlpool, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in a circle above thirteen miles
in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Kircher Mund. Subt. vol. i. p.
156.</bibl>
               </note>. In the midſt of this ſtands a rock, againſt which the
tide in its ebb is daſhed with inconceivable fury. At this time it
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſwallows up all things that come within the ſphere of its
violence, trees, timber, and ſhipping. No ſkill in the mariner, nor
ſtrength of rowing, can work an eſcape: the ſailor at the helm finds the
ſhip at firſt go in a current op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to his intentions; his
veſſel's motion, tho' ſlow in the beginning, becomes every moment more
rapid; it goes round in circles ſtill narrower and narrower, till at laſt
it is daſhed againſt the rocks, and inſtantly diſappears: nor is it
ſeen again for ſix hours: till the tide flowing, it is vomited forth with
the ſame violence with which it was drawn in. The noiſe of this dreadful
vortex ſtill farther contributes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe its terror, which with the
daſhing of the waters, and the dreadful valley, if it may be ſo called,
cauſed by their circulation, makes one of the moſt tremendous objects in
nature.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XVII. Of the Changes produced by the Sea upon the
Earth.</head>
            <p>FROM what has been ſaid, as well of the earth as of the ſea,
they both appear to be in continual fluctuation. The earth, the common
promptuary that ſupplies ſubſiſtence to men, animals, and vegetables,
is continually furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its ſtores to their ſupport. But the matter
which is thus derived from it, is ſoon reſtored and laid down again to be
prepared for freſh mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. The tranſmigration of ſouls is no doubt
falſe and whimſical; but nothing can be more certain than the
tranſmigration of bodies: the ſpoils of the meaneſt reptile may go to the
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a prince; and, on the contrary, as the poet has it, the body of
Caeſar may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſtopping a beer barrel. From this, and other
cauſes, therefore, the earth is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual change. Its internal fires, the
deviation of its rivers, and the falling of its mountains, are daily altering
its ſurface; and geography can ſcarce recollect the lakes and the vallies
that hiſtory once deſcribed.</p>
            <p>But theſe changes are nothing to the inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility 
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0823800101:293"/> of the ocean. It would ſeem that inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etude was as
natural to it as its fluidity. It is firſt ſeen with a conſtant and
equable motion going towards the weſt; the tides then interrupt this
progreſſion, and for a time drive the waters in a contrary direction;
beſide theſe agitations, the currents act their part in a ſmaller
ſphere, being generally greateſt where the other motions of the ſea are
leaſt; namely, neareſt the ſhore: the winds alſo contribute their
ſhare in this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal fluctuation; ſo that ſcarce any part of the
ſea is wholly ſeen to ſtagnate.</p>

            <p>As this great element is thus changed, and continually labouring
internally, it may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſuppoſed that it produces correſpondent
changes upon its ſhores, and thoſe parts of the earth ſubject to its
influence. In fact, it is every day making conſiderable alterations, either
by overflowing its ſhores in one place, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting them in others; by
covering over whole tracts of country, that were cultivated and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, at
one time; or by leaving its bed to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the purpoſes of
vegetation, and to ſupply a new theatre for human induſtry at another.</p>

ſea for dominion, the greateſt number of our ſhores ſeem to defy the
whole rage of the waves, both by their height, and the rocky materials of which
they are compoſed. The coaſts of Italy, for inſtance<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 199.</bibl>
               </note>, are bordered with
rocks of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of different kinds, the quarries of which may eaſily be
diſtinguiſhed at a diſtance from ſea, and appear like perpendicular
columns, of the moſt beautiful kinds of marble, ranged along the ſhore. In
general, the coaſts of France, from Breſt to Bourdeaux, are compoſed of
rocks; as are alſo thoſe of Spain and England, which defend the land, and
only are interrupted here and there to give an egreſs to rivers, and to grant
the conveniences of bays and harbours to our ſhipping. It may be in general
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that wherever the ſea is moſt violent and furious, there the
boldeſt ſhores, and of the moſt compact materials, are found to oppoſe
it. There are many ſhores ſeveral hundred feet perpendicular, againſt
which the ſea, when ſwollen with tides or ſtorms, riſes and beats with
inconceivable fury. In 
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Idem, vol. ii. p.
191.</bibl>
               </note> the Ork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, where the ſhores are thus formed, it
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when agitated by a ſtorm, riſes two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred feet
perpendicular, and daſhes up its ſpray, <pb n="272" facs="tcp:0823800101:295"/> together
with ſand, and other ſubſtances that compoſe its bottom, upon land,
like ſhowers of rain.</p>
            <p>From hence, therefore, we may conceive how the violence of the
ſea, and the boldneſs of the ſhore, may be ſaid to have made each
other. Where the ſea meets no obſtacles, it ſpreads its waters with a
gentle intumeſcence, till all its power is deſtroyed, by its wanting depth
to aid its motion. But when its progreſs is checked in the midſt, by the
prominence of rocks, or the abrupt elevation of the land, it daſhes with all
the force of its depth againſt the obſtacle, and forms, by its repeated
violence, that abruptneſs of the ſhore which confines its impetuoſity.
Where the ſea is extremely deep, or very much vexed by tempeſts, it is no
ſmall obſtacle that can confine its rage; and for this reaſon we ſee
the boldeſt ſhores projected againſt the deepeſt waters; all leſs
impediments having long before been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted and waſhed away. Perhaps of
all the ſhores in the world, there is not one ſo high as that to the weſt
of St. Kilda, which, upon a late admeaſurement<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Deſcription of St. Kilda.</bibl>
               </note>, was found to be
ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fathom perpendicular above the ſurface of the ſea. Here
alſo, the ſea is deep, turbulent, <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0823800101:296"/> and ſtormy; ſo
that it requires great force in the ſhore to oppoſe its violence. In many
parts of the world, and particularly upon the coaſts of the Eaſt Indies,
the ſhores, though not high above water, are generally very deep, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the waves roll againſt land with great weight and
irregularity. This riſing of the waves againſt the ſhore, is called by
mariners, the ſurf of the ſea; and in ſhipwrecks is generally fatal to
ſuch as attempt to ſwim on ſhore. In this caſe, no dexterity in the
ſwimmer, no float he can uſe, neither ſwimming girdle nor cork jacket
will ſave him; the weight of the ſuperincumbent wave breaks upon him at
once, and cruſhes him with certain ruin. Some few of the natives, however,
have the art of ſwimming and of navigating their little boats near thoſe
ſhores, where an European is ſure of inſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>In places where the force of the ſea is leſs violent, or its
tides leſs rapid, the ſhores are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſeen to deſcend with a more
gradual declivity. Over theſe, the waters of the tide ſteal by almoſt
imperceptible degrees, covering them for a large extent, and leaving them bare
on its receſs. Upon theſe ſhores, as was ſaid, the ſea ſeldom beats
with any great violence, as a large wave has not depth ſufficient to float it
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0823800101:297"/> onwards, ſo that here only are to be ſeen gentle
ſurges making calmly towards land, and leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they approach. As
the ſea, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer deſcription, is generally ſeen to preſent
proſpects of tumult, and uproar, here it more uſually exhibits a ſcene of
repoſe and tranquil beauty. Its waters, which when ſurveyed from the
precipice, afforded a muddy greeniſh hue, ariſing from their depth and
poſition to the eye<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Newton's Optics, p.
163-167.</bibl>
               </note>, when regarded from a ſhelving ſhore, wear the
colour of the ſky, and ſeem riſing to meet it. The deafening noiſe of
the deep ſea, is here converted into gentle murmurs; inſtead of the water's
daſhing againſt the face of the rock, it advances and recedes, ſtill
going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but with juſt force enough to puſh its weeds and ſhells,
by inſenſible approaches, to the ſhore.</p>
            <p>There are ſtill other ſhores, beſide thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
deſcribed, which either have been raiſed by art to oppoſe the ſea's
approaches, or from the ſea's gaining ground, are threatened with imminent
deſtruction. The ſea's being thus ſeen to give and take away lands at
pleaſure, is, without queſtion, one of the moſt extraordinary
conſiderations in all natural hiſtory. In ſome places it is ſeen to
obtain the ſuperiority by ſlow and certain approaches; or to burſt in at
once, <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0823800101:298"/> and overwhelm all things in undiſtinguiſhed
deſtruction; in other places it departs from its ſhores, and where its
waters have been known to rage, it leaves fields covered with the moſt
beautiful verdure.</p>
            <p>The formation of new lands by the ſea's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually bringing its
ſediment to one place, and by the accumulation of its ſands in another, is
eaſily conceived. We have had many inſtances of this in England. The
iſland of Oxney, which is adjacent to Romney-marſh, was produced in this
manner. This had for a long time been a low level, continually in danger of
being overflown by the river Rother; but the ſea, by its depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, has
gradually raiſed the bottom of the river, while it has hollowed the mouth;
ſo that the one is ſufficiently ſecured from inundations, and the other
is deep enough to admit ſhips of conſiderable burthen. The like alſo may
be ſeen at that bank called the Dogger-ſands, where two tides meet, and
which thus receive new increaſe every day, ſo that in time the place
ſeems to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe fair for being habitable earth. On many parts of the
coaſts of France, England, Holland, Germany, and Pruſſia, the ſea has
been ſenſibly known to retire<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol.

               </note>. Hubert Thomas aſſerts, in his Deſcription of
the Country of Liege, that the <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0823800101:299"/> ſea formerly
encompaſſed the city of Tongres, which, however, is at preſent
thirty-five leagues diſtant from it: this aſſertion he ſupports by many
ſtrong reaſons; and among others, by the iron rings fixed in the walls of
the town, for faſtening the ſhips that came into the port. In Italy there
is a conſiderable piece of ground gained at the mouth of the river Arno; and
Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna, that once ſtood by the ſea-ſide is now conſiderably removed
from the ſame. But we need ſcarce mention theſe, when we find that the
whole kingdom of Holland ſeems to be a conqueſt upon the ſea, and in a
manner reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued from its boſom. The ſurface of the earth, in this
country, is below the level of the bed of the ſea; and I remember, upon
approaching the coaſt, to have looked down upon it from the ſea, as into a
valley; however, it is every day riſing higher by the depoſitions made upon
it, both by the ſea, the Rhine, and the Meuſe; and thoſe parts which
formerly admitted large men of war, are now known to be too ſhallow to
receive ſhips of very moderate burthen<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon,
vol. vi. p. 424.</bibl>
               </note>. The province of Jucatan, a peninſula in the
gulph of Mexico, was formerly a part of the ſea: this tract, which
ſtretches out into the ocean an hundred leagues, and which is above thirty 
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0823800101:300"/> broad, is every where, at a moderate depth below the
ſurface, compoſed of ſhells, which evince that its land once formed the
bed of the ſea. In France, the town of Aigues Mortes was a port in the times
of St. Louis, which is now removed more than four miles from the ſea.
Pſalmodi, in the ſame kingdom, was an iſland in the year 815, but is now
more than ſix miles from the ſhore. All along the coaſts of Norfolk, I am
very well aſſured, that in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of man, the ſea has gained fifty
yards in ſome places, and has loſt as much in others.</p>
            <p>Thus numerous, therefore, are the inſtances of new lands having
been produced from the ſea, which, as we ſee, is brought about two
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ways: firſt, by the waters raiſing banks of ſand and mud where
their ſediment is depoſited; and ſecondly, by their relinquiſhing the
ſhore entirely, and leaving it unoccupied to the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of man.</p>
            <p>But as the ſea has been thus known to recede from ſome lands,
ſo has it, by fatal experience, been found to encroach upon others: and,
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, theſe depredations on one part of the ſhore, may account for
their dereliction from another; for the current which reſted upon ſome
certain bank, having got an egreſs in ſome other place, it no longer
preſſes upon its former bed, <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0823800101:301"/> but pours all its
ſtream into the new entrance, ſo that every inundation of the ſea may be
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſome correſpondent dereliction of another ſhore.</p>
            <p>However this be, we have numerous hiſtories of the ſea's
inundations, and its burying whole provinces in its boſom. Many countries
that have been thus deſtroyed, ſtill bear melancholy witneſs to the truth
of hiſtory; and ſhew the tops of their houſes, and the ſpires of their
ſteeples, ſtill ſtanding at the bottom of the water. One of the moſt
conſiderable inundations we have in hiſtory, is that which happened in the
reign of Henry I. which overflowed the eſtates of the Earl Godwin, and forms
now that bank called the Goodwin ſands. In the year 1546, a ſimilar
irruption of the ſea deſtroyed an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand perſons in the
territory of Dort; and yet a greater number round Dullart. In Friezland, and
Zealand, there were more than three hundred villages overwhelmed; and their
remains continue ſtill viſible at the bottom of the water in a clear day.
The Baltic ſea has, by ſlow degrees, covered a large part of Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rania;
and, among others, deſtroyed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed the famous port of Vineta. In
the ſame manner, the Norwegian ſea has formed ſeveral little iſlands
from the main land, and ſtill <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0823800101:302"/> daily advances upon the
continent. The Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſea has advanced upon the ſhores of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, near
Catt, ſo that the ruins of an ancient citadel of the Romans, which was
formerly built upon this coaſt, are now actually under water. To theſe
accidents ſeveral more might be added; our own hiſtorians, and thoſe of
other countries, abound with them; almoſt every flat ſhore of any extent,
being able to ſhew ſomething that it has loſt, or ſomething that it has
gained from the ſea.</p>
            <p>There are ſome ſhores on which the ſea has made temporary
depredations; where it has overflowed, and after remaining perhaps ſome ages,
it has again retired of its own accord, or been driven back by the induſtry
of man<note n="*" place="bottom">

There are many lands in Norway, Scotland, and the Maldivia iſlands, that are
at one time co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with water, and at another free. The country round the
Iſle of Ely, in the times of Bede, about a thouſand years ago, was one of
the moſt delightful ſpots in the whole kingdom. It was not only richly
cultivated, and produced all the neceſſaries of life, but grapes alſo
that afforded the moſt excellent wine. The accounts of that time are copious
in the deſcription of its verdure and fertility; its rich paſtures, covered
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0823800101:303"/> with flowers and herbage; its beautiful ſhades, and
wholſome air. But the ſea breaking in, upon the land, overwhelmed the whole
country, took poſſeſſion of the ſoil, and totally deſtroyed one of
the moſt beautiful vallies in the world. Its air, from being dry and
healthful, from that time became moſt unwholſome, and clogged with vapours;
and the ſmall part of the country that, by being higher than the reſt,
eſcaped the deluge, was ſoon rendered uninhabitable, from its noxious
vapours. Thus this country conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued under water for ſome centuries; till,
at laſt, the ſea, by the ſame caprice which had prompted its invaſions,
began to abandon the the earth in like manner. It has continued for ſome ages
to relinquiſh its former conqueſts; and although the inhabitants can
neither boaſt the longevity, nor the luxuries of their former pre-occupants,
yet they find ample means of ſubſiſtence; and if they happen to ſurvive
the firſt years of their reſidence there, they are often known to arrive at
a good old age.</p>
            <p>But although hiſtory be ſilent as to many other inundations of
the like kind, where the ſea has overflowed the country, and afterwards
retired, yet we have numberleſs teſtimonies of another nature, that prove
it beyond the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of doubt: I mean thoſe numerous trees that are
found buried at conſiderable depths <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0823800101:304"/> in places where
either rivers, or the ſea, has accidentally overflown<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 403.</bibl>
               </note>. At the mouth of the
river Neſs, near Bruges, in Flanders, at the depth of fifty feet, are found
great quantities of trees lying as cloſe to each other as they do in a wood:
the trunks, the branches, and the leaves, are in ſuch perfect preſervation,
that the particular kind of each tree may inſtantly be known. About five
hundred years ago, this very ground was known to have been covered with the
ſea; nor is there any hiſtory or tradition of its having been dry ground,
which we can have no doubt muſt have been the caſe. Thus we ſee a country
flouriſhing in verdure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing large foreſts, and trees of various
kinds, overwhelmed by the ſea. We ſee this element depoſiting its
ſediment to an heighth of fifty feet; and its waters muſt, therefore, have
riſen much higher. We ſee the ſame, after it has thus overwhelmed, and
ſunk the land ſo deep beneath its ſlime, capriciouſly retiring from the
ſame coaſts, and leaving that habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table once more, which it had formerly
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. All this is wonderful; and perhaps, inſtead of attempting to
enquire after the cauſe, which has hitherto been inſcrutable, it will
beſt become us to reſt ſatisfied with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0823800101:305"/>At the city of Modena in Italy, and about four
miles round it, wherever it is dug, when the workmen arrive at the depth of
ſixty-three feet, they come to a bed of chalk, which they bore with an augre
five feet deep: they then withdraw from the pit, before the augre is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and upon its extraction, the water burſts up through the aperture with great
violence, and quickly fills this new made well, which continues full, and is
affected neither by rains nor droughts. But that which is moſt remarkable in
this operation, is the layers of earth as we deſcend. At the depth of
fourteen feet, are found the ruins of an ancient city, paved ſtreets,
houſes, floors, and different pieces of Moſaic. Under this is found a
ſolid earth, that would induce one to think had never been removed; however,
under it is found a ſoft oozy earth, made up of vegetables; and at
twenty-ſix feet depth, large trees entire, ſuch as walnut-trees, with the
walnuts ſtill ſticking on the ſtem, and their leaves and branches in
exact preſervation. At twenty-eight feet deep, a ſoft chalk is found, mixed
with a vaſt quantity of ſhells; and this bed is eleven feet thick. Under
this, vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are found again, with leaves, and branches of trees as
before; and thus alternately chalk and vegetable earth to the depth of
ſixty-three <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0823800101:306"/> feet. Theſe are the layers wherever the
work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men attempt to bore; while in many of them, they alſo find pieces of
charcoal, bones, and bits of iron. From this deſcription, therefore, it
appears, that this country has been alternately overflowed and deſerted by
the ſea, one age after another: nor were theſe overflowings and retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of trifling depth, or of ſhort continuance. When the ſea burſt in, it
muſt have been a long time in overwhelming the branches of the fallen
foreſt with its ſediment; and ſtill longer in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a regular bed of
ſhells eleven feet over them. It muſt have, therefore, taken an age, at
leaſt, to make any one of theſe layers; and we may conclude, that it muſt
have been many ages employed in the production of them all. The land alſo,
upon being deſerted, muſt have had time to grow compact, to gather freſh
fertility, and to be drained of its waters before it could be diſpoſed to
vegetation; or before its trees could have ſhot forth again to maturity.</p>
            <p>We have inſtances nearer home of the ſame kind, given us in the
Philoſophical Tranſactions; one of them by Mr. Derham. An inundation of the
ſea, at Dagenham, in Eſſex, laying bare a part of the adjacent paſture,
for above two hundred feet wide, and, in ſome places, twenty deep, it
diſcovered a number of trees that had <pb n="284" facs="tcp:0823800101:307"/> lain there for
many ages before; theſe trees, by lying long under ground, were become black
and hard, and their fibres ſo tough, that one might as eaſily break a wire,
as any of them: they lay ſo thick in the place where they were found, that in
many parts he could ſtep from one to another: he conceived alſo, that not
only all the adjacent marſhes, for ſeveral hundred acres, were covered
underneath with ſuch tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but alſo the marſhes along the mouth of the
Thames, for ſeveral miles. The meeting with theſe trees at ſuch depths,
he aſcribes to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment of the river, and the tides, which
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly waſhing over them, have always left ſome part of their
ſubſtance behind, ſo as, by repeated alluvions, to work a bed of
vegetable earth over them, to the height at which he found it.</p>
            <p>The levels of Hatfield-Chace, in Yorkſhire, a tract of above
eighteen thouſand acres, which was yearly overflown, was reduced to arable
and paſture-land, by one Sir Cornelius Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſden, a Dutchman. At the
bottom of this wide extent, are found millions of the roots and bodies of
trees, of ſuch as this iſland either formerly did, or does at preſent
produce. The roots of all ſtand in their proper poſtures; and by them, as
thick as ever they could <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0823800101:308"/> grow, the reſpective trunks
of each, ſome above thirty yards long. The oaks, ſome of which have been
ſold for fifteen pounds a piece, are as black as ebony, very laſting, and
cloſe grained. The aſh-trees are as ſoft as earth, and are commonly cut
in pieces by the workmen's ſpades, and as ſoon as flung up into the open
air, turn to duſt. But all the reſt, even the willows themſelves, which
are ſofter than the aſh, preſerve their ſubſtance and texture to this
very day. Some of the firs appear to have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getated, even after they were
fallen, and to have, from their branches, ſtruck up large trees, as great as
the parent trunk. It is obſervable, that many of theſe trees have been
burnt, ſome quite through, ſome on one ſide, ſome have been found
chopped and ſquared, others riven with great wooden wedges, all
ſufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting, that the country which was deluged, had formerly
been inhabited. Near a great root of one tree, were found eight coins of the
Roman emperors; and, in ſome places, the marks of the ridge and furrow were
plainly perceivable, which teſtified that the ground had formerly been
patient of cultivation.</p>
            <p>The learned naturaliſt who has given this deſcription<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Phil. Tranſ. vol. iv. part ii. p. 214.</bibl>
               </note>, has
pretty plainly evinced, that <pb n="286" facs="tcp:0823800101:309"/> this foreſt, in
particular, muſt have been thus levelled by the Romans; and that the falling
of the trees, muſt have contributed to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation of the waters. 
<q rend="inline">"The Romans," ſays he, "when the Britons fled,
always purſued them into the fortreſſes of low woods, and miry foreſts:
in theſe, the wild natives found ſhelter; and, when opportunity offered,
iſſued out, and fell upon their invaders without mercy. In this manner, the
Romans were at length ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed, that orders were iſſued out for
cutting down all the woods and foreſts in Britain. In order to effect this,
and deſtroy the enemy the eaſier, they ſet fire to the woods, compoſed
of pines, and other inflamable timber, which ſpreading, the conflagration
deſtroyed not only the foreſt, but infinite numbers of the wretched
inhabitants who had taken ſhelter therein: When the pine-trees had thus done
what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they could, the Romans then brought their army nearer, and,
with whole legions of the captive Britons, cut down moſt of the trees that
were yet left ſtanding; leaving only here and there ſome great trees
untouched, as monuments of their fury. Theſe, unneedful of their labour,
being deſtitute of the ſupport of the underwood, and of their neighbouring
trees, were eaſily overthrown by the winds, and, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, 
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0823800101:310"/> remained on the places where they happened to fall. The
foreſt, thus fallen, muſt neceſſarily have ſtopped up the currents,
both from land and ſea; and turned into great lakes, what were before but
temporary ſtreams. The working of the waters here, the conſumption and
decay of rotten boughs and branches, and the vaſt encreaſe of water-moſs
which flouriſhes upon marſhy grounds, ſoon formed a covering over the
trunks of the fallen trees, and raiſed the earth ſeveral feet above its
former level. The earth thus every day ſwelling, by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual encreaſe
from the ſediment of the waters, and by the lightneſs of the vegetable
ſubſtances of which it was compoſed, ſoon overtopt the waters by which
this intumeſcence was at firſt effected; ſo that it entirely got rid of
its inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, or only demanded a ſlight aſſiſtance from man for
that purpoſe."</q> And this may be the origin of all bogs whatſoever, which
are formed by the putrefaction of vegetable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, mixed with the mud
and ſlime depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by waters, and at length acquiring a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
conſiſtency.</p>
            <p>From this we ſee what powerful effects the ſea is capable of
producing upon its ſhores, either by overflowing ſome, or deſerting
others; by <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0823800101:311"/> altering the direction of theſe, and
rendering thoſe craggy and precipitate, which before were ſhelving. But the
influence it has upon theſe, is nothing to that which it has upon that great
body of earth which forms its bottom. It is at the bottom of the ſea that the
greateſt wonders are performed, and the moſt rapid changes are produced; it
is there that the motion of the tides and the currents have their whole force,
and agitate the ſubſtances of which their bed is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. But all
theſe are almoſt wholly hid from human curioſity: the miracles of the
deep are performed in ſecret; and we have but little information from its
abyſſes, except what we receive by inſpection at very ſhallow depths,
or by the plummet, or from divers, who are known to deſcend from twenty to
thirty fathom<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>The eye can reach but a very ſhort way into the depths of the
ſea; and that only when its ſurface is glaſſy and ſerene. In many
ſeas it perceives nothing but a bright ſandy plain at bottom, extending for
ſeveral hundred miles, without an intervening object. But in others,
particularly in the Red Sea, it is very different: the whole bottom of this
extenſive bed of waters is, literally ſpeaking, a foreſt of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine 
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0823800101:312"/> plants, and corals formed by inſects for their
habitation, ſometimes branching out to a great extent. Here are ſeen the
madrepores, the ſponges, moſſes, ſea muſhrooms, and other marine
productions, covering every part of the bottom; ſo that ſome have even
ſuppoſed the ſea to have taken its name from the colour of its plants
below. However, theſe plants are by no means peculiar to this ſea, as they
are found in great quantities in the Perſian gulph, along the coaſts of
Africa, and thoſe of Provence and Catalonia.</p>
            <p>The bottom of many parts of the ſea near America, preſents a
very different, though a very beautiful appearance. This is covered with
vegetables, which make it look as green as a meadow, and beneath are ſeen
thouſands of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and other ſea animals, feeding thereon.</p>
            <p>In order to extend our knowledge of the ſea to greater depths,
recourſe has been had to the plummet; which is generally made of a lump of
lead of about forty pounds weight, faſtened to a cord<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. ii. p. 5.</bibl>
               </note>. This, however, only
anſwers in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate depths; for when a deep ſea is to be ſounded, the
matter of which the cord is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, being lighter than the water, floats
upon <pb n="290" facs="tcp:0823800101:313"/> it, and when let down to a conſiderable depth,
its length ſo encreaſes its ſurface, that it is often ſufficient to
prevent the lead from ſinking; ſo that this may be the reaſon that ſome
parts of the ſea are ſaid to have no bottom.</p>
            <p>In general, we learn from the plummet, that the bottom of the ſea
is tolerably even where it has been examined; and that the farther from the
ſhore, the ſea is in general the deeper. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, now and then,
in the midſt of a great and unfathomable ocean, we often find an iſland
raiſing its head, and ſingly braving its fury. Such iſlands may be
conſidered as the mountains of the deep; and, could we for a moment imagine
the waters of the ocean re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, or dried away, we ſhould probably find the
inequalities of its bed reſembling thoſe that are found at land. Here
extenſive plains; there valleys; and, in many places, mountains of amazing
height. M. Buache has actually given us a map of that part of its bottom, which
lies between Africa and America, taken from the ſeveral ſoundings of
mariners: in it we find the ſame uneven ſurface that we do upon land, the
ſame eminences, and the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. In ſuch an imaginary
proſpect, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, there would be this difference, that as the tops of land
mountains appear the moſt barren <pb n="291" facs="tcp:0823800101:314"/> and rocky, the tops
of ſea-mountains would be found the moſt verdant and fruitful.</p>
            <p>The plummet, which thus gives us ſome idea of the inequalities of
the bottom, leaves us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally in the dark as to every other particular;
recourſe, therefore, has been had to divers: theſe, either being bred up in
this dangerous way of life, and accuſtomed to remain ſome time under water
without breathing, or aſſiſted by means of a diving-bell, have been able
to return ſome confuſed and uncertain accounts of the places below. In the
great diving-bell improved by Doctor Halley, which was large enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
five men, and was ſupplied with freſh air by buckets, that alternately
roſe and fell, they deſcended fifty fathom. In this huge machine, which was
let down from the maſt of the ſhip, the doctor himſelf went down to the
bottom, where, when the ſea was clear, and eſpecially when the ſun
ſhone, he could ſee perfectly well to write or read, and much more to take
up any thing that was underneath: at other times, when the water was troubled
and thick, it was as dark as night below, ſo that he was obliged to keep a
candle lighted at the bottom. But there is one thing very remarkable, which is,
that the water which from above was uſually ſeen of a green colour, when
looked at from below, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <pb n="292" facs="tcp:0823800101:315"/> to him of a very
different one, caſting a redneſs upon one of his hands, like that of

56.</bibl>
               </note>.—A proof of the ſea's taking its colour not from any
thing floating in it, but from the different reflexions of the rays of light.
Upon the whole, the accounts we have received from the bottom, by this
contrivance, are but few. We learn from it, and from divers in general, that
while the ſurface of the ſea may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by tempeſts, it is
uſually calm and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate below<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Boyle,
vol. iii. p. 242.</bibl>
               </note>; that ſome divers who have gone down when the
weather was calm, and came up when it was tempeſtuous, were ſurprized at
their not perceiving the change at the bottom. This, however, muſt not be
ſuppoſed to obtain with regard to the tides, and the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as they are
ſeen conſtantly ſhifting their bottom; taking their bed with great
violence from one place, and depoſiting it upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We are informed,
alſo, by divers, that the ſea grows colder in proportion as they deſcend
to the bottom; that as far as the ſun's rays pierce, it is influenced by
their warmth; but lower, the cold becomes almoſt intolerable. A perſon of
quality, who had been himſelf a diver, as Mr. Boyle informs us, declared,
that though he ſeldom deſcended above three or four <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0823800101:316"/>
fathoms, yet he found it ſo much colder than near the top, that he could not
well endure it; and that being let down in a great diving-bell, although the
water could not immediately touch him, he found the air extremely cold upon his
firſt arrival at the bottom.</p>
            <p>From divers alſo we learn, that the ſea in many places is filled
with rocks at bottom; and that among their clifts, and upon their ſides,
various ſubſtances ſprout forward, which are either really vegetables, or
the neſts of inſects, encreaſed to ſome magnitude. Some of theſe
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the ſhape of beautiful flowers; and, tho' ſoft, when taken up,
ſoon harden, and are kept in the cabinets of the curious.</p>
            <p>But, of all thoſe divers who have brought us information from the
bottom of the deep, the famous Nicola Peſce, whoſe performances are told us
by Kircher, is the moſt celebrated. I will not ſo much as pretend to vouch
for the veracity of Kircher's account, which he aſſures us he had from the
archives of the kings of Sicily; but it may ſerve to enliven an heavy
chapter. 
<q rend="inline">"In the times of Frederic, king of Sicily, there
lived a celebrated diver, whoſe name was Nicolas, and who, from his amazing
ſkill in ſwimming, and his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance under water, was ſurnamed the
fiſh. <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0823800101:317"/> This man had, from his infancy, been uſed to
the ſea; and earned his ſcanty ſubſiſtence by diving for corals, and
oyſters; which he ſold to the villages on ſhore. His long acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the ſea, at laſt, brought it to be almoſt his natural element. He
frequently was known to ſpend five days in the midſt of the waves, without
any other proviſions than the fiſh which he caught there, and ate raw. He
often ſwam over from Sicily into Calabria, a tempeſtuous and dangerous
paſſage, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying letters from the king. He was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently known to
ſwim among the gulphs of the Lipari iſlands, no way apprehenſive of
danger. 
<p>"Some mariners out at ſea one day obſerved ſomething at
ſome diſtance from them, which they regarded as a ſea-monſter; but upon
its approach, it was known to be Nicolas, whom they took into their ſhip.
When they aſked him whither he was going in ſo ſtormy and rough a ſea,
and at ſuch a diſtance from land, he ſhewed them a packet of letters,
which he was carrying to one of the towns of Italy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly done up in a
leather bag, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as that they could not be wetted by the ſea.
He kept them thus company for ſome time on their voyage, converſing, and
aſking queſtions; <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0823800101:318"/> and after eating an hearty meal
with them, he took his leave, and jumping into the ſea, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his voyage
alone.</p> 
                  <p>"In order to aid theſe powers of enduring in the deep, nature
ſeemed to have aſſiſted him in a very extraordinary manner; for the
ſpaces between his fingers and toes were webbed, as in a gooſe; and his
cheſt became ſo very capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that he could take in at one
inſpiration, as much breath as would ſerve him for an whole day.</p> 
                  <p>"The account of ſo extraordinary a perſon did not fail to
reach the king himſelf; who, actuated by the general curioſity, ordered
that Nicolas ſhould be brought before him. It was no eaſy matter to find
Nicolas, who generally ſpent his time in the ſolitudes of the deep; but at
laſt, however, after much ſearching, he was found, and brought before his
majeſty. The curioſity of this monarch had been long excited by the
accounts he had heard of the bottom of the gulph of Charybdis; he now,
therefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that it would be a proper opportunity to have more
certain information. He therefore commanded our poor diver to examine the
bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of this dreadful whirlpool; and, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement to his obedience,
ordered a golden <pb n="296" facs="tcp:0823800101:319"/> cup to be flung into it. Nicolas was
not inſenſible of the danger to which he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; dangers beſt
known only to himſelf; and he therefore preſumed to remonſtrate: but the
hopes of the reward, the deſire of pleaſing the king, and the pleaſure of
ſhewing his ſkill, at laſt prevailed. He inſtantly jumped into the
gulph, and was ſwallowed as inſtantly up in its boſom. He continued for
three quarters of an hour below; during which time, the king and his attendants
remained upon ſhore, anxious for his fate; but he at laſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
buffeting upon the ſurface, holding the cup in triumph in one hand, and
making his way good among the waves with the other. It may be ſuppoſed he
was received with applauſe, upon his arrival on ſhore: the cup was made the
reward of his adventure; the king ordered him to be taken proper care of; and,
as he was ſomewhat fatigued and debilitated by his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, after an hearty
meal, he was put to bed, and permitted to refreſh himſelf by
ſleeping.</p> 
                  <p>"When his ſpirits were thus reſtored, he was again brought,
to ſatisfy the king's curioſity with a narrative of the wonders he had
ſeen; and his account was to the following effect. He would never, he ſaid,
have obeyed the king's commands, had he been apprized of half the 
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0823800101:320"/> dangers that were before him. There were four things, he
ſaid, that rendered the gulph dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, not only to men, but even to the
fiſhes themſelves: firſt, the force of the water burſting up from the
bottom, which require great ſtrength to reſiſt; ſecondly, the
abruptneſs of the rocks, that on every ſide threatened deſtruction;
thirdly, the force of the whirlpool, daſhing againſt thoſe rocks; and
fourthly, the number and magnitude of the polypous fiſh, ſome of which
appeared as large as a man, and which every where ſticking againſt the
rocks, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected their fibrous arms to entangle him. Being aſked how he was
able ſo readily to find the cup that had been thrown in, he replied, that it
happened to be flung by the waves into the cavity of a rock, againſt which he
himſelf was urged in his deſcent. This account, however, did not ſatisfy
the king's curioſity: being requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to venture once more into the gulph
for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcoveries, he at firſt refuſed; but the king, deſirous
of having the moſt exact information poſſible of all things to be found
in the gulph, repeated his ſollicitations; and, to give them ſtill greater
weight, produced a larger cup than the former, and added alſo a purſe of
gold. Upon theſe conſiderations, the unfortunate Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacola once again
plunged into the whirlpool, and was never heard of more."</p>

            <head>CHAP. XVIII. A ſummary Account of the Mechanical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of
Air.</head>
            <p>HAVING deſcribed the earth and the ſea, we now aſcend into
that fluid which ſurrounds them both; and which, in ſome meaſure,
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and ſupplies all animated nature. As upon viewing the bottom of
the ocean from its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, we ſee an infinity of animals moving therein,
and ſeeking food; ſo were ſome ſuperior being to regard the earth at a
proper diſtance, he might conſider us in the ſame light: he might, from
his ſuperior ſtation, behold a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of buſy little beings, immerſed
in the aerial fluid, that every where ſurrounds them, and ſedulouſly
employed in procuring the means of ſubſiſtence. This fluid, though too
fine for the groſs perception of its inhabitants, might, to his nicer organs
of ſight, be very viſible; and, while he at once ſaw into its operations,
he might ſmile at the varieties of human conjecture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it: he might
readily diſcern, perhaps, the height above the ſurface of the earth to
which this fluid atmoſphere reaches: he might exactly determine that peculiar
form of its parts which gives it the ſpring or elaſticity with which it is
endued: he might diſtinguiſh which of its <pb n="299" facs="tcp:0823800101:322"/> parts were
pure incorruptible air, and which only made for a little time to aſſume the
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, ſo as to be quickly returned back to the element from whence it
came. But as for us, who are immerſed at the bottom of this gulph, we muſt
be contented with a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined knowledge; and, wanting a proper point of
proſpect, remain ſatisfied with a combination of the effects.</p>
            <p>One of the firſt things, therefore, that our ſenſes informs us
of, is, that although the air is too fine for our ſight, it is very obvious
to our touch. Although we cannot ſee the wind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a bladder, we can
very readily feel its reſiſtance; and though the hurricane may want colour,
we often fatally experience that it does not want force. We have equal
experience of the air's ſpring or elaſticity: the bladder, when
preſſed, returns again, upon the preſſure being taken away; a bottle,
when filled, often burſts, from the ſpring of air which is included.</p>
            <p>So far the ſlighteſt experience reaches; but, by carrying
experiment a little farther, we learn, that air alſo is heavy: a round
glaſs veſſel being emptied of its air, and accurately weighed, has been
found lighter than when it was weighed with the air in it. Upon computing the
ſuperior weight of the full veſſel, a cubic foot <pb n="300" facs="tcp:0823800101:323"/>
of air is found to weigh ſomething more than an ounce.</p>
            <p>From this experiment, therefore, we learn, that the earth, and all
things upon its ſurface, are every where covered with a ponderous fluid,
which riſing very high over our heads, muſt be proportionably heavy. For
inſtance, as in the ſea, a man at the depth of twenty feet, ſuſtains a
greater weight of water than a man at the depth of but ten feet; ſo will a
man at the bottom of a valley have a greater weight of air over him, than a man
on the top of a mountain.</p>
            <p>From hence we may conclude, that we ſuſtain a very great weight
of air; and although, like men walking at the bottom of the ſea, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
feel the weight which preſſes equally round us, yet the preſſure is not
the leſs real. As in morals, we ſeldom know the bleſſings that
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round us till we are deprived of them, ſo here we do not perceive the
weight of the ambient fluid till a part of it is taken away. If, by any means,
we contrive to take away the preſſure of the air from any one part of our
bodies, we are ſoon made ſenſible of the weight upon the other parts.
Thus, if we clap our hand upon the mouth of a veſſel from whence the air
has been taken away, there will thus be air on one ſide, and none on the
other; upon which, we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0823800101:324"/> find the hand
violently ſucked inwards, which is nothing more than the weight of the air
upon the back of the hand that cruſhes it into the ſpace which is empty
below.</p>
            <p>As by this experiment, therefore, we perceive that the air
preſſes with great weight upon every thing on the ſurface of the earth,
ſo by other experiments we learn the exact weight with which it preſſes.
Firſt, if the air be exhauſted out of any veſſel, a drinking-glaſs
for inſtance<note n="*" place="bottom">This may be done by burning a bit of
paper in the ſame, and then quickly turning it down upon the water.</note>,
and this veſſel be ſet with the mouth down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in water, the water will
riſe up into the empty ſpace, and fill the inverted glaſs; for the
external air will, in this caſe, preſs up the water, where there is no
weight to reſiſt; as, one part of a bed being preſſed, makes the other
parts, that have no weight upon them, riſe. In this caſe, therefore, as was
ſaid, the water being preſſed without, will riſe in the glaſs; and
would continue to riſe (if the empty glaſs were tall enough) thirty-two
feet high. In fact, there have been pipes made purpoſely for this
expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, of above thirty-two feet high; in which, upon being exhauſted,
the water has always riſen to the height of thirty-two feet: there it 
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0823800101:325"/> has always reſted, and never aſcended higher. From
this, therefore, we learn, that the weight of the air which preſſes up the
water, is equal to a pillar or column of water, which is thirty-two feet high;
as it is juſt able to raiſe ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, and no more. In other words,
the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the earth is every where covered with a weight of air, which
is equivalent to a covering of thirty-two feet deep of water; or to a weight of
twenty-nine inches and an half of quickſilver, which is known to be juſt as
heavy as the former.</p>
            <p>Thus, therefore, we ſee that the air at the ſurface of the earth
is juſt as heavy as thirty-two feet of water, or twenty-nine inches and an
half of quickſilver; and it is eaſily found, by computation, that to
raiſe water thirty-two feet, will require a weight of fifteen pounds upon
every ſquare inch. Now, if we are fond of computations, we have only to
calculate how many ſquare inches are in the ſurface of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary human
body, and allowing every inch to ſuſtain fifteen pounds, we may amaze
ourſelves at the weight of air we ſuſtain. It has been computed, and
found, that our ordinary load of air amounts to within a little of forty
thouſand pounds: this is wonderful! but wondering is not the way to grow
wiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0823800101:326"/>Notwithſtanding this be our ordinary load,
and our uſual ſupply, there are at different times very great variations.
The air is not, like water, equally heavy at all ſeaſons; but ſometimes
is lighter, and ſometimes more heavy. It is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more compreſt, and
ſometimes more elaſtic or ſpringy, which produces the ſame effects as
an encreaſe of its weight. The air which at one time raiſes water
thirty-two feet in the tube, and quickſilver twenty-nine inches, will not at
another raiſe the one to thirty feet, or the other to twenty-ſix inches.
This makes, therefore, a very great difference in the weight we ſuſtain;
and we are actually known, by computation, to carry at one time four thouſand
pounds of air more than at another.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this ſurprizing difference in the weight of air,
is either owing to its preſſure from above, or to an encreaſe of vapour
floating in it. Its encreaſed preſſure is the conſequence of its
ſpring or elaſticity, which cold and heat ſenſibly affect, and are
continually changing.</p>
            <p>This elaſticity of the air is one of its moſt amazing
properties; and to which it ſhould ſeem nothing can ſet bounds. A body of
air that may be contained in a nut-ſhell, may eaſily, with heat, be dilated
into a ſphere of unknown dimenſions. On the contrary, the air contained 
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0823800101:327"/> in an houſe, may be compreſſed into a cavity not
larger than the eye of a needle. In ſhort, no bounds can be ſet to its
confinement or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion; at leaſt, experiment has hitherto found its
attempts indefinite. In every ſituation, it retains its elaſticity; and the
more cloſely we compreſs it, the more ſtrongly does it reſiſt the
preſſure. If to the encreaſing the elaſticity on one ſide by
compreſſion, we encreaſe it on the other ſide by heat, the force of
both ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes irreſiſtible; and a certain French phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
ſuppoſed<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Monſieur Amontons.</bibl>
               </note>,
that air thus confined, and expanding, was ſufficient for the exploſion of
a world.</p>
            <p>Many inſtruments have been formed to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and determine
theſe different properties of the air; and which ſerve ſeveral uſeful
purpoſes. The barometer ſerves to meaſure its weight; to tell us when it
is heavier, and when lighter. It is compoſed of a glaſs tube or pipe, of
about thirty inches in length, cloſed up at one end; this tube is then filled
with quickſilver; this done, the maker clapping his finger upon the open end,
inverts the tube, and plunges the open end, finger and all, into a baſon of
quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, and then takes his finger away: now the quickſilver in the
tube will, by its own weight, <pb n="305" facs="tcp:0823800101:328"/> endeavour to deſcend
into that in the baſon; but the external air, preſſing on the ſurface
of the quickſilver in the baſon without, and no air being in the tube at
top, the quickſilver will continue in the tube, being preſſed up, as was
ſaid, by the air, on the ſurface of the baſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. The height at which
it is known to ſtand in the tube, is uſually about twenty-nine inches, when
the air is heavy; but not above twenty-ſix, when the air is very light. Thus,
by this inſtrument we can, with ſome exactneſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the weight of
the air; and, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, tell before-hand the changes of the weather.
Before fine dry weather, the air is charged with a variety of vapours, which
float in it unſeen, and render it extremely heavy, ſo that it preſſes
up the quickſilver; or, in other words, the barometer riſes. In moiſt,
rainy weather, the vapours are waſhed down, or there is not heat ſufficient
for them to riſe, ſo that the air is then ſenſibly lighter, and
preſſes up the quickſilver with leſs force; or, in other words, the
barometer is ſeen to fall. Our conſtitutions ſeem alſo to correſpond
with the changes of the weather-glaſs; they are braced, ſtrong, and
vigorous, with a large body of air upon them; they are languid, relaxed, and
feeble, when the <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0823800101:329"/> air is light, and refuſes to give our
fibres their proper tone.</p>
            <p>But although the barometer thus meaſures the weight of the air
with exactneſs enough for the general purpoſes of life, yet it is often
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a thouſand irregularities, that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs in the
inſtrument can remedy, nor no theory account for. When high winds blow, the
quickſilver generally is low: it riſes higher in cold weather, than in
warm; and is uſually higher at morning and evening, than at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: it
generally deſcends lower after rain than it was before it. There are alſo
frequent changes in the air, without any ſenſible alteration in the
barometer.</p>
            <p>As the barometer is thus uſed in predicting the changes of the
weather, ſo it is alſo ſerviceable in meaſuring the heights of
mountains, which mathematicians cannot ſo readily do: for, as the higher we
aſccend from the ſurface of the earth, the air becomes lighter, ſo the
quickſilver in the barometer will deſcend in proportion. It is found to
ſink at the rate of the tenth part of an inch for every ninety feet we
aſcend; ſo that in going up a mountain, if I find the quickſilver fallen
an inch, I conclude, that I am got upon an aſcent of near nine hundred feet
high. In this there has been found ſome variation; into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail 
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0823800101:330"/> of which, it is not the buſineſs of a natural
hiſtorian to enter.</p>
            <p>In order to determine the elaſticity of air, the wind gun has been
invented, which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument variouſly made; but in all upon the
principle of compreſſing a large quantity of air into a tube, in which
there is an ivory ball, and then giving the compreſſed elaſtic air free
power to act, and drive the ball as directed. The ball thus driven, will pierce
a thick board: and will be as fatal, at ſmall diſtances, as if driven with
gunpowder. I do not know whether ever the force of this inſtrument has been
aſſiſted by means of heat; certain I am, that this, which could be very
eaſily contrived by means of phoſphorus, or any other hot ſubſtance
applied to the barrel, would give ſuch a force as I doubt whether gunpowder
itſelf could produce.</p>
            <p>The air-pump is an inſtrument contrived to exhauſt the air from
round a veſſel adapted to that purpoſe, called a receiver. This method of
exhauſting, is contrived in the ſimple inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by a piſton, like
that of a ſyringe, going down into the veſſel, and thus puſhing out its
air; which, by means of a valve, is prevented from returning into the
veſſel again. But this, like all other complicated inſtruments, will be
better underſtood by a minute inſpection, than <pb n="308" facs="tcp:0823800101:331"/> an
hour's deſcription: it may ſuffice here to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that by depriving
animals, and other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of all air, it ſhews us what the benefits
and effects of air are in ſuſtaining life, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting vegetation.</p>
            <p>The digeſter is an inſtrument of ſtill more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
effects than any of the former; and ſufficiently diſcovers the amazing
force of air, when its elaſticity is augmented by fire. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tea-kettle,
if the ſpout were cloſed up, and the lid put firmly down, would ſerve to
become a digeſter, if ſtrong enough. But the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment uſed for this
purpoſe, is a ſtrong metal pot, with a lid to ſcrew cloſe on, ſo
that, when down, no air can get in or return: into this pot, meat and bones are
put, with a ſmall quantity of water, and then the lid ſcrewed cloſe: a
lighted lamp is put underneath, and, what is very extraordinary, (yet equally
true) in ſix or eight minutes the whole maſs, bones and all, are
diſſolved into a jelly; ſo great is the force and elaſticity of the air
contained within; ſtruggling to eſcape, and breaking in pieces all the
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances with which it is mixed. Care, however, muſt be taken not to
heat this inſtrument too violently; for then, the incloſed air would
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come irreſiſtible, and burſt the whole, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a fatal
exploſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:0823800101:332"/>There are numberleſs other uſeful
inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made to depend on the weight, the elaſticity, or the fluidity
of the air, which do not come within the plan of the preſent work; the
deſign of which is not to give an account of the inventions that have been
made for deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the nature and properties of air, but a mere narrative of
its effects. The deſcription of the pump, the forcing pump, the fire engine,
the ſteam engine, the ſyphon, and an hundred others, belong not to the
naturaliſt, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental philoſopher: the one gives an hiſtory
of Nature, as he finds ſhe preſents herſelf to him; and he draws the
obvious picture: the other, purſues her with cloſe inveſtigation,
tortures her by experiment to give up her ſecrets, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures her latent
qualities with laborious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. Much more, therefore, might be ſaid of
the mechanical effects of air, and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures that have been made
reſpecting the form of its parts; how ſome have ſuppoſed them to
reſemble little hoops, coil'd up in a ſpring; others, like fleeces of wool;
others, that the parts are endued with a repulſive quality, by which, when
ſqueezed together, they endeavour to fly off, and recede from each other. We
might have given the diſputes relative to the <pb n="310" facs="tcp:0823800101:333"/> height
to which this body of air extends above us, and concerning which there is no
agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We might have enquired how much of the air we breathe is
elementary, and not redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to any other ſubſtance; and of what
den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity it would become, if it were ſuppoſed to be continued down to the
center of the earth. At that place we might, with the help of figures, and a
bold imagination, have ſhewn it twenty thouſand times heavier than its bulk
of gold. We might alſo prove it millions of times purer than upon earth, when
raiſed to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the atmoſphere. But theſe ſpeculations do
not belong to natural hiſtory; and they have hitherto produced no great
advantages in that branch of ſcience to which they more properly
appertain.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIX. An Eſſay towards a Natural Hiſtory of the
Air.</head>
            <p>A Late eminent philoſopher has conſidered our atmoſphere as
one large chymical veſſel, in which an infinite number of various
operations are conſtantly performing. In it all the bodies of the earth are
continually ſending up a part of their ſubſtance by evaporation, to mix
in this great alembic, and to float a-while in common. Here minerals, from
their loweſt depths, aſcend in noxious, or in warm vapours, to make a part
of the general maſs; ſeas, rivers, and ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous ſprings,
furniſh their copious ſupplies; plants receive and return their ſhare;
and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, that by living upon, conſume this general ſtore, are found to
give it back in greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, when they die<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Boyle, vol. ii. p. 593.</bibl>
               </note>. The air, therefore,
that we breathe, and upon which we ſubſiſt, bears very little
reſemblance to that pure elementary body which was deſcribed in the laſt
chapter; and which is rather a ſubſtance that may be conceived, than
experienced to exiſt. Air, ſuch as we find it, is one of the moſt
compounded bodies in all nature. Water may be reduced to <pb n="312" facs="tcp:0823800101:335"/>
a fluid every way reſembling air, by heat; which, by cold, becomes water
again. Every thing we ſee, gives off its parts to the air, and has a little
floating atmoſphere of its own round it. The roſe is encompaſſed with a
ſphere of its own odorous particles; while the night-ſhade in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the air
with ſcents of a more ungrateful nature. The perfume of muſk flies off in
ſuch abundance, that the quantity remaining, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſenſibly lighter by
the loſs. A thouſand ſubſtances that eſcape all our ſenſes, we
know to be there; the powerful emanations of the load-ſtone, the effluvia of
electricity, the rays of light, and the inſinuations of fire. Such are the
various ſubſtances through which we move, and which we are conſtantly
taking in at every pore, and returning again with imperceptible
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.</p>
            <p>This great ſolution, or mixture of all earthly bodies, is
continually operating upon itſelf; which, perhaps, may be the cauſe of its
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing motion: but it operates ſtill more viſibly upon ſuch
groſſer ſubſtances as are expoſed to its influence; for ſcarce any
ſubſtance is found capable of reſiſting the corroding qualities of the
air. The air, ſay the chymiſts, is a chaos, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all kinds of
ſalts and menſtruums; and, therefore, it is capable of diſſolving all 
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0823800101:336"/> kinds of bodies. It is well known, that copper and iron
are quickly covered, and eaten with ruſt; and that in the climates near the
equator, no art can keep them clean. In thoſe dreary countries, the
inſtruments, knives and keys, that are kept in the pocket, nevertheleſs are
quickly encruſted; and the great guns, with every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution, after ſome
years, become uſeleſs. Stones, as being leſs hard, may be readily
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be more eaſily ſoluble. The marble of which the noble
monuments of Italian antiquity are compoſed, although in one of the fineſt
cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates in the world, nevertheleſs ſhew the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which have
been made upon them by the air. In many places they ſeem worm-eaten by time;
and, in others, they appear crumbling into duſt. Gold alone ſeems to be
exempted from this general ſtate of diſſolution; it is never found to
contract ruſt, though expoſed never ſo long: the reaſon of this ſeems
to be, that ſea-ſalt, which is the only menſtruum capable of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon, and diſſolving gold, is but very little mixed with the air; for
ſalt being a very fixed body, and not apt to volatilize, and riſe with
heat, there is but a ſmall proportion of it in the atmoſphere. In the
elaboratories, and ſhops, however, where ſalt is much uſed, and the air 
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0823800101:337"/> is impregnated with it, gold is found to ruſt as well
as other metals.</p>
            <p>Bodies of a ſofter nature are obviouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the
air<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. iii. p. 62.</bibl>
               </note>. Mr.
Boyle ſays, that ſilks brought to Jamaica, will, if there expoſed to the
air, rot even while they preſerve their colour; but if kept therefrom, they
both retain their ſtrength and gloſs. The ſame happens in Braſil, where
their cloaths, which are black, ſoon turn of an iron colour; though, in the
ſhops, they preſerve their proper hue<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ibid, vol. iii. p. 68.</bibl>
               </note>. In theſe tropical
climates alſo, ſuch are the putreſcent qualities of the air, that white
ſugar will ſometimes be full of maggots. Drugs and plaiſters loſe their
virtue, and become verminous. In ſome places they are obliged to expoſe
their ſweetmeats by day in the ſun, otherwiſe the night air would quickly
cauſe them to putrefy. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in the cold arctic regions, animal
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, during their winter, are never known to putrefy; and meat may
be kept for months, without any ſalt whatſoever. This experiment happily
ſucceeded with the eight Engliſhmen that were accidentally left upon the
inhoſpitable coaſts of Greenland, at a place where ſeven Dutchmen had
periſhed but a few years before; for killing ſome rein-deer for their
ſubſiſtence, <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0823800101:338"/> and having no ſalt to preſerve
the fleſh, to their great ſurprize, they ſoon found it did not want any,
as it remained ſweet during their eight months continuance upon that
ſhore.</p>
            <p>Theſe powers with which air is endued over unorganized
ſubſtances, are exerted in a ſtill ſtronger manner over plants, animals
of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior nature, and, laſtly, over man himſelf. Moſt of the
beauty, and the luxuriance of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is well known to be derived from the
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign influence of the air: and every plant ſeems to have its favourite
climate, not leſs than its proper ſoil. The lower ranks of animals alſo,
ſeem formed for their reſpective climates, in which only they can live. Man
alone ſeems the child of every climate, and capable of exiſting in all.
However, this peculiar privilege does not exempt him from the influences of the
air; he is as much ſubject to its malignity, as the meaneſt inſect or
vegetable.</p>
            <p>With regard to plants, air is ſo abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for
their life and preſervation, that they will not vegetate in an exhauſted
receiver. All plants have within them a quantity of air, which ſupports and
agitates their juices. They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually imbibing freſh nutriment from
the air, to encreaſe this ſtore, and to ſupply the wants which they
ſuſtain from evaporation. When, <pb n="316" facs="tcp:0823800101:339"/> therefore, the
external air is drawn from them, they are no longer able to ſubſiſt. Even
that quantity of air which they before were poſſeſſed of, eſcapes
through their pores, into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted receiver; and as this continues to
be pumped away, they become languid, grow flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, and die. However, the plant
or flower thus ceaſing to vegetate, is kept, by being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from the
external air, a much longer time ſweet than it would have continued, had it
been openly expoſed.</p>
            <p>That air which is ſo neceſſary to the life of vegetables, is
ſtill more ſo to that of animals; there are none found, how ſeemingly
torpid ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that do not require their needful ſupply. Fiſhes
themſelves will not live in water from whence the air is exhauſted; and it
is generally ſuppoſed that they die in frozen ponds, from the want of this
neceſſary to animal exiſtence. Many have been the animals that idle
curioſity has tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in the priſon of a receiver, merely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the manner of their dying. We ſhall, from a thouſand inſtances, produce
that of the viper, as it is known to be one of the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacious reptiles
in the world; and as we ſhall feel but little compaſſion for its
tortures. Mr. Boyle took a new caught viper, and ſhutting it up into a
ſmall receiver, began to pump away <pb n="317" facs="tcp:0823800101:340"/> the air<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Boyle's Phico. Mechan. Exper. Paſſim.</bibl>
               </note>. 
<q rend="inline">"At firſt, upon the air's being drawn away, it
began to ſwell; ſome time after he had done pumping, it began to gape, and
open its jaws; being thus compelled to open its jaws, it once more reſumed
its former lankneſs; it then began to move up and down within, as if to
ſeek for air, and after a while foamed a little, leaving the foam ſticking
to the inſide of the glaſs; ſoon after the body and neck grew
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly tumid, and a bliſter appeared upon its back; an hour and an
half after the receiver was exhauſted, the diſtended viper moved, and gave
manifeſt ſigns of life; the jaws remained quite diſtended; as it were
from beneath the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glottis, came the black tongue, and reached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it;
but the animal ſeemed, by its poſture, not to have any life: the mouth
alſo was grown blackiſh within; and in this ſituation it continued for
twenty-three hours. But upon the air's being re-admitted, the viper's mouth was
preſently cloſed, and ſoon after opened again; and for ſome time
thoſe motions continued, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued the remains of life."</q> Such is the
fate of the moſt inſignificant or minute reptile that can be thus included.
Mites, fleas, and even the little eels that are found ſwimming in vinegar,
die for want of air. Not only theſe, but the eggs <pb n="318" facs="tcp:0823800101:341"/> of
theſe animals, will not produce in vacuo, but require air to bring them to
perfection.</p>
            <p>As in this manner air is neceſſary to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
ſo alſo it muſt be of a proper kind, and not impregnated with foreign
mixtures. That factitious air which is pumped from plants or fluids, is
generally, in a ſhort time, fatal to them. Mr. Boyle has given us many
expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments to this purpoſe. After having ſhewn that all vegetable, and
moſt mineral ſubſtances, properly prepared, may afford air, by being
placed in an exhauſted receiver, and this in ſuch quantities, that ſome
have thought it a new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, made by the alteration which the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
or plant has undergone by the texture of its parts being looſened in the
operation—hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhewn, I ſay, that this air may be drawn in great
quantities from vegetable, animal, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſubſtances, ſuch as
apples, cherries, amber burnt, or hartſhorn<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Boyle's Phyſic. Mechan. vol. ii. p.
598.</bibl>
               </note>—he included a frog in artificial air, produced from
paſte; in ſeven mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes ſpace it ſuffered convulſions, and at laſt
lay ſtill, and being taken out, recovered no motion at all, but was dead. A
bird encloſed in artificial air, from raiſins, died in a quarter of a
minute, and never ſtirred more. A ſnail was put into the receiver, with air
of paſte; in four <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0823800101:342"/> minutes it ceaſed to move, and was
dead, altho' it had ſurvived in vacuo for ſeveral hours: ſo that
factitious air proved a greater enemy to animals than even a vacuum
itſelf.</p>
            <p>Air alſo may be impregnated with fumes that are inſtantly fatal
to animals. The fumes of hot iron, copper, or any other heated metal, blown
into the place where an animal is confined, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deſtroy it. We have
already mentioned the vapours in the grotto Del Cane ſuffocating a dog. The
ancients even ſuppoſed, that theſe animals, as they always ran with their
noſes to the ground, were the firſt that felt any infection. In ſhort, it
ſhould ſeem that the predominance of any one vapour, from any body, how
whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſoever in itſelf, becomes infectious; and that we owe the
ſalubrity of the air to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of its mixture.</p>
            <p>But there is no animal whoſe frame is more ſenſibly affected
by the changes of the air than man. It is true, he can endure a greater
va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of climates than the lower orders generally are able to do; but it is
rather by the means which he has diſcovered of obviating their effects, than
by the apparent ſtrength of his conſtitution. Moſt other animals can bear
cold or hunger better, endure greater fatigues in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and are
ſatisfied with ſhorter repoſe. <pb n="320" facs="tcp:0823800101:343"/> The variations of
the climate, therefore, would probably affect them leſs, if they had the
ſame means or ſkill in providing againſt the ſeverities of the change.
However this be, the body of man is an inſtrument much more nicely
ſenſible of the variations of the air, than any of thoſe which his own
art has produced; for his frame alone ſeems to unite all their properties,
being invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorated by the weight of the air, relaxed by its moiſture,
enfeebled by its heat, and ſtiffened by its frigidity.</p>
            <p>But it is chiefly by the predominance of ſome peculiar vapour,
that the air becomes unfit for human ſupport. It is often found, by dreadful
experience, to enter into the conſtitution, to mix with its juices, and to
putrefy the whole maſs of blood. The nervous ſyſtem is not leſs
affected by its operations; palſies and vertigoes are cauſed by its damps;
and a ſtill more fatal train of diſtempers by its exhalations. In order
that the air ſhould be wholeſome, it is neceſſary, as we have ſeen,
that it ſhould not be of one kind, but the compound of ſeveral
ſubſtances; and the more various the compoſition, to all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance the
more ſalubrious. A man, therefore, who continues in one place, is not ſo
likely to enjoy this wholeſome variety, as he who changes his ſituation;
and, if I may ſo expreſs it, inſtead <pb n="321" facs="tcp:0823800101:344"/> of waiting
for a renovation of air, walks forward to meet its arrival. Thus mere motion,
inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent even of the benefits of exerciſe, becomes wholſome, by thus
ſupplying a greater variety of that healthful fluid by which we are
ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>A thouſand accidents are found to encreaſe theſe bodies of
vapour, that make one place more or leſs wholſome than another. Heat may
raiſe them in too great quantities; and cold may ſtagnate them. Minerals
may give off their effluvia in ſuch proportion as to keep away all other kind
of air; vegetables may render the air unwholſome by their ſupply; and
animal putrefaction ſeems to furniſh a quantity of vapour, at leaſt as
noxious as any of the former. All theſe united, generally make up the maſs
of reſpiration, and are, when mixed together, harmleſs; but any one of
them, for a long time ſingly predominant, becomes at length fatal.</p>
            <p>The effects of heat in producing a noxious quality in the air, are
well known. Thoſe torrid regions under the Line are always unwholſome. At
Senegal, I am told, the natives conſider forty as a very advanced time of
life, and generally die of old age at fifty. At Carthagena<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ulloa, vol. i. p. 42.</bibl>
               </note>, in America, where the
heat of the hotteſt day ever <pb n="322" facs="tcp:0823800101:345"/> known in Europe is
continual, where, during their winter ſeaſon, theſe dreadful heats are
united with a continual ſucceſſion of thunder, rain, and tempeſts,
ariſing from their intenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the wan and livid complexions of the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants might make ſtrangers ſuſpect that they were juſt recovered
from ſome dreadful diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; the actions of the natives are conformable
to their colour; in all their motions there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what relaxed and languid;
the heat of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate even affects their ſpeech, which is ſoft and
ſlow, and their words generally broken. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers from Europe retain their
ſtrength and ruddy colour in that climate, poſſibly for three or four
months; but afterwards ſuffer ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays in both, that they are no longer
to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the inhabitants by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. However,
this languid and ſpiritleſs exiſtence is frequently drawled on
ſometimes even to eighty. Young perſons are generally moſt affected by
the heat of climate, which ſpares the more aged; but all, upon their arrival
on the coaſts, are ſubject to the ſame train of fatal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. Few
nations have experienced the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of theſe coaſts, ſo much as our
own: in our unſucceſsful attack upon Carthagena, more than three parts of
our army were deſtroyed by the climate alone; and thoſe that returned from 
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0823800101:346"/> that fatal expedition, found their former vigour
irretrievably gone. In our more fortunate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, which gave us the
Havannah, we had little reaſon to boaſt of our ſucceſs; inſtead of a
third, not a fifth part of the army were left ſurvivors of their victory, the
climate being an enemy that even heroes cannot conquer.</p>
            <p>The diſtempers that thus proceed from the cruel malignity of
thoſe climates, are many: that, for inſtance, called the Chapotonadas,
car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries off a multitude of people; and extremely thins the crews of European
ſhips, whom gain tempts into thoſe inhoſpitable regions. The nature of
this diſtemper is but little known, being cauſed in ſome perſons by
cold, in others by indigeſtion. But its effects are far from being obſcure;
it is generally fatal in three or four days: upon its ſeizing the patient, it
brings on what is there called the black vomit, which is the ſad ſymptom
after which none are ever found to recover. Some, when the vomit attacks them,
are ſeized with a delirium, that, were they not tied down, they would tear
themſelves to pieces, and thus expire in the midſt of this fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
paroxyſm. This diſorder, in milder cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, takes the name of the bilious
fever, and is attended with milder ſymptoms, but very dangerous in all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:0823800101:347"/>There are many other diſorders incident to
the human body, that ſeem the offspring of heat; but to mention no other,
that very laſſitude which prevails in all the tropical climates, may be
conſidered as a diſeaſe. The inhabitants of India<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>, ſays a
modern philoſopher, ſuſtain an unceaſing languor, from the heats of
their cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; and are torpid in the midſt of profuſion. For this
reaſon, the great Diſpoſer of Nature has cloathed their country with
trees of an amazing height, whoſe ſhade might defend them from the beams of
the ſun; and whoſe continual freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might, in ſome meaſure,
temperate their fierceneſs. From theſe ſhades, therefore, the air
receives refreſhing moiſture, and animals a cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing protection. The whole
race of ſavage ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals retire, in the midſt of the day, to the very center
of the foreſts, not ſo much to avoid their enemy man, as to find a defence
againſt the raging heats of the ſeaſon. This advantage which ariſes
from ſhade in torrid climates, may probably afford a ſolution for that
extraordinary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance related by Boyle, which he imputes to a different
cauſe. In the iſland of Ternate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Dutch, a place that had
been long celebrated for its beauty and healthfulneſs, the clove trees grew
in ſuch plenty, that they in <pb n="325" facs="tcp:0823800101:348"/> ſome meaſure
leſſened their own value: for this reaſon, the Dutch reſolved to cut
down the foreſts, and thus to raiſe the price of the commodity: but they
had ſoon reaſon to repent of their avarice; for ſuch a change enſued,
by cutting down the trees, that the whole iſland, from being healthy and
delightful, having loft its charming ſhades, became extremely ſickly, and
has actually continued ſo to this day. Boerhaave conſidered heat ſo
prejudicial to health, that he was never ſeen to go near a fire.</p>
            <p>An oppoſite ſet of calamities are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, in
climates where the air is condenſed by cold. In ſuch places, all that train
of diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which are known to ariſe from obſtructed perſpiration,
are very common<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Krantz's Hiſtory of Greenland,
vol. i. p. 235.</bibl>
               </note>; eruptions, boils, ſcurvy, and a loathſome
leproſy, that covers the whole body with a ſcurf, and white putrid ulcers.
Theſe diſorders alſo, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious; and, while they thus baniſh the
patient from ſociety, they generally accompany him to the grave. The men of
thoſe climates ſeldom attain to the age of fifty; but the women, who do not
lead ſuch laborious lives, are found to live longer.</p>
            <p>The autumnal complaints which attend a wet <pb n="326" facs="tcp:0823800101:349"/>
ſummer, indicate the dangers of a moiſt air. The long continuance of an
eaſt wind alſo, ſhews the prejudice of a dry one. Mineral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations,
when copious, are every where known to be fatal; and although we probably owe
the encreaſe and luxuriance of vegetation to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate degree of their
warmth, yet the natives of thoſe countries where there are mines in plenty,
but too often experience the noxious effects of their vicinity. Thoſe trades
alſo that deal in the preparations of metals of all kinds, are always
unwholſome; and the workmen, after ſome time, are generally ſeen to
labour under palſies, and other nervous complaints. The vapours from ſome
vegetable ſubſtances, are well known to be attended with dangerous effects.
The ſhade of the machinel tree, in America, is ſaid to be fatal; as was
that of the juniper, if we may credit the ancients. Thoſe who walk through
fields of poppies, or in any manner prepare thoſe flowers for making opium,
are very ſenſibly affected with the drowſineſs they occaſion. A
phyſician of Mr. Boyle's acquaintance, cauſing a large quantity of black
hellebore to be pounded in a mortar, moſt of the perſons who were in the
room, and eſpecially the perſon who pounded it, were purged by it, and
ſome of them ſtrongly. He alſo gathered a certain plant in Ireland, which
the perſon who beat in a mortar, and the <pb n="327" facs="tcp:0823800101:350"/> phyſician
who was ſtanding near, were ſo ſtrongly affected by, that their hands and
faces ſwelled to an enormous ſize, and continued tumid for a long time
after.</p>
            <p>But neither mineral nor vegetable ſteams are ſo dangerous to the
conſtitution, as thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from animal ſubſtances, putrefying
either by diſeaſe or death. The effluvia that comes from diſeaſed
bodies, propagate that frightful catalogue of diſorders which are called
infectious. The parts which compoſe vegetable vapours, and mineral
exhalations, ſeem groſs and heavy, in compariſon of theſe volatile
vapours, that go to great diſtances, and have been deſcribed as ſpreading
deſolation over the whole earth. They fly every where; pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate every
where; and the vapours that fly from a ſingle diſeaſe, ſoon render it
epidemic.</p>
            <p>The plague is the firſt upon the liſt in this claſs of human
calamities. From whence this ſcourge of man's preſumption may have its
beginning, is not well known; but we well know that it is propagated by
infection. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the general ſtate of the atmoſphere, we learn, from
experience, that the noxious vapours, though but ſingly introduced at
firſt, taints the air by degrees: every perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, tends to add to
the growing malignity; <pb n="328" facs="tcp:0823800101:351"/> and, as the diſorder becomes
more general, the putreſcence of the air becomes more noxious, ſo that the
ſymptoms are aggravated by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. When it is ſaid that the origin of
this diſorder is unknown, it implies, that the air ſeems to be but little
employed in firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it. There are ſome countries, even in the
midſt of Africa, that we learn have never been inſected with it; but
continue, for centuries, unmoleſted. On the contrary, there are others, that
are generally viſited once a year, as in Egypt, which, nevertheleſs,
ſeems peculiarly bleſſed with the ſerenity and temperature of its
climate. In the former countries, which are of vaſt extent, and many of them
very populous, every thing ſhould ſeem to diſpoſe the air to make the
plague continual among them. The great heats of the climate, the
unwholſomeneſs of the food, the ſloth and dirt of the inhabitants, but,
above all, the bloody battles which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually fought among them, after
which heaps of dead bodies are left unburied, and expoſed to putrefaction.
All theſe one might think would be apt to bring the plague among them; and
yet, nevertheleſs, we are aſſured by Leo Africanus, that in Numidia the
plague is not known once in an hundred years; and that in Negroland, it is not
known at all. This dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſorder, therefore, muſt have its riſe, not
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0823800101:352"/> from any previous diſpoſition of the air, but from
ſome particular cauſe, beginning with one individual, and extending the
malignity, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, till at laſt the air becomes actually tainted
by the generality of the infection.</p>
            <p>The plague which ſpread itſelf over the whole world, in the year
1346, as we are told by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeray, was ſo contagious, that ſcarce a village,
or even an houſe, eſcaped being infected by it. Before it had reached
Europe, it had been for two years travelling from the great kingdom of Cathay,
where it began by a vapour moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridly fetid; this broke out of the earth
like a ſubterranean fire, and upon the firſt inſtant of its eruption,
conſumed and deſolated above two hundred leagues of that country, even to
the trees and ſtones.</p>
            <p>In that great plague which deſolated the city of London, in the
year 1665, a pious and learned ſchoolmaſter of Mr. Boyle's acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
who ventured to ſtay in the city, and took upon him the humane office of
viſiting the ſick and the dying, who had been deſerted by better
phyſicians, averred, that being once called to a poor woman who had buried
her children of the plague, he found the room where ſhe lay ſo little that
it ſcarce could hold any more than the bed whereon ſhe was ſtretched.
However, in this <pb n="330" facs="tcp:0823800101:353"/> wretched abode, beſide her, in an
open coffin, her huſband lay, who had ſome time before died of the ſame
diſeaſe; and whom ſhe, poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſoon followed. But what ſhewed
the peculiar malignity of the air thus ſuffering from animal putrefaction,
was, that the contagious ſteams had produced ſpots on the very wall of
their wretched apartment: and Mr. Boyle's own ſtudy, which was contiguous to
a peſt-houſe, was alſo ſpotted in the ſame frightful manner. Happily
for mankind, this diſorder, for more than a century, has not been known in
our iſland; and, for this laſt age, has abated much of its violence, even
in thoſe countries where it is moſt common. Diſeaſes, like empires,
have their revolutions; and thoſe which for a while were the ſcourge of
mankind, ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of, to give place to new ones, more dreadful, as being
leſs underſtood.</p>
            <p>For this revolution in diſorders, which has employed the
ſpeculation of many, Mr. Boyle accounts in the following manner. 
<q rend="inline">"Since," ſays he, "there want not cauſes in the
bowels of the earth, to make conſiderable changes amongſt the materials
that nature has plentifully treaſured up in thoſe magazines, and as thoſe
noxious ſteams are abundantly ſupplied to the ſurface, it may not ſeem
improbable, that in this <pb n="331" facs="tcp:0823800101:354"/> great variety, ſome may be
found capable of particularly affecting the human frame in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
manner, and thus of producing new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. The duration of theſe may be
greater or leſs, according to the laſtingneſs of thoſe ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
cauſes that produced them. On which account, it need be no wonder that ſome
diſeaſes have but a ſhort duration, and vaniſh not long after they
appear; whilſt others may continue longer, as having under ground more
ſettled and durable cauſes to maintain them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>From the recital of this train of miſchiefs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the air,
upon minerals, plants, animals, and man himſelf, a gloomy mind may be apt to
dread this indulgent nurſe of nature as a cruel and an inexorable
ſtep-mother: but it is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and, although we are ſometimes
injured, yet almoſt all the comforts and bleſſings of life ſpring from
its propitious influence. It would be needleſs to obſerve, that it is
abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ſupport of our lives; for of this, every
moment's experience aſſures us. But how it contributes to this ſupport,
is not ſo readily comprehended. All allow it to be a friend, to whoſe
benefits we are conſtantly obliged: and yet, to this hour, philoſophers are
divided as to the nature of the obligation. The diſpute is, whether the air
is only uſeful by its weight to <pb n="332" facs="tcp:0823800101:355"/> force our juices into
circulation<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Keil. Robinſon.</bibl>
               </note>; or,
whether, by containing a peculiar ſpirit, it mixes with the blood in our
veſſels, and acts like a ſpur to their induſtry<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Whytt upon vital and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary
Motions.</bibl>
               </note>. Perhaps it may exert both theſe uſeful offices at
the ſame time. Its weight may give the blood its progreſſive motion,
through the larger veſſels of the body; and its admixture with it, cauſe
thoſe contractions of all the veſſels, which ſerve to force it ſtill
more ſtrongly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, through the minuteſt channels of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.
Be this as it may, it is well known, that that part of our blood which has
juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the influx of the air in our bodies, is of a very different
colour from that which has almoſt performed its circuit. It has been found,
that the arterial blood which has been immediately mixed with the air in the
lungs, and, if I may ſo expreſs it, is juſt beginning its journey through
the body, is of a fine florid ſcarlet colour; while, on the contrary, the
blood of the veins that is returning from having performed its duty, is of a
blackiſh crimſon hue. Whence this difference of colour ſhould proceed, is
not well underſtood: we only know the fact, that this florid colour is
communicated by the air; and we are well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, <pb n="333" facs="tcp:0823800101:356"/>
that this air has been admitted into the blood for very uſeful
purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Beſides this vital principle in animals, the air alſo gives life
and body to flame. A candle quickly goes out in an exhauſted receiver; for
having ſoon conſumed the quantity of air, it then expires, for want of a
freſh ſupply. There has been a flame contrived that will burn under water;
but none yet has been found, that will continue to burn without air. Gunpowder,
which is the moſt catching and powerful fire we know, will not go off in an
exhauſted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver; nay, if a train of gunpowder be laid, ſo as that one
part may be fired in the open air, yet the other part in vacuo will remain
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, and unconſumed. Wood alſo ſet on fire, immediately goes out;
and its flame ceaſes upon removing the air; for ſomething is then wanting
to preſs the body of the fire againſt that of the fuel, and to prevent the
too ſpeedy dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the flame. We frequently ſee cooks, and others,
whoſe buſineſs it is to keep up ſtrong fires, take proper precautions
to exclude the beams of the ſun from ſhining upon them, which effectually
puts them out. This they are apt to aſcribe to a wrong cauſe; namely, the
operation of the light: but the real fact is, that <pb n="334" facs="tcp:0823800101:357"/> the
warmth of the ſun-beams leſſen and diſſipate the body of the air that
goes to feed the flame; and the fire, of conſequence, languiſhes for want
of a neceſſary ſupply.</p>
            <p>The air, while it thus kindles fire into flame, is notwithſtanding
found to moderate the rays of light, to diſſipate their violence, and to
ſpread an uniform luſtre over every object. Were the beams of the ſun to
dart directly upon us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſing through this protecting medium,
they would either burn us up at once, or blind us with their effulgence. But by
going through the air, they are reflected, refracted, and turned from their
direct courſe, a thouſand different ways; and thus are more evenly
diffuſed over the face of nature.</p>
            <p>Among the other neceſſary benefits the air is of to us, one of
the principal is its conveyance of ſound. Even the vibrations of a bell,
which have the loudeſt effect that we know of, ceaſes to be heard, when
under the receiver of an air-pump. Thus all the pleaſures we receive from
converſation with each other, or from muſic, depend entirely upon the
air.</p>
            <p>Odours likewiſe are diffuſed only by the means of air; without
this fluid to ſwim in, they would for ever remain torpid in their
reſpective <pb n="335" facs="tcp:0823800101:358"/> ſubſtances; and the roſe would affect
us with as little ſenſations of pleaſure, as the thorn on which it
grew.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are willing to augment the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the benefits we
receive from this ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, aſſert alſo, that taſtes themſelves would
be inſipid, were it not that the air preſſes their parts upon the nerves
of the tongue and palate, ſo as to produce their grateful effects. Thus,
continue they, upon the tops of high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as on the Pike of Teneriff,
the moſt poignant bodies, as pepper, ginger, ſalt, and ſpice, have no
ſenſible taſte, for want of their particles being thus ſent home to the
ſenſory. But, we owe the air ſufficient obligations, not to be ſtudious
of admitting this among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: in fact, all ſubſtances have their
taſtes, as well on the tops of mountains, as in the bottom of the valley; and
I have been one of many, who have ate a very ſavoury dinner on the Alps.</p>
            <p>It is ſufficient, therefore, that we regard the air as the parent
of health and vegetation; as a kind diſpenſer of light and warmth; and as
the conveyer of ſounds and odours. This is an element of which avarice will
not deprive us; and which power cannot monopolize. The treaſures of the
earth, the verdure of the fields, <pb n="336" facs="tcp:0823800101:359"/> and even the
refreſhments of the ſtream, are too often ſeen going only to aſſiſt
the luxuries of the great; while the leſs fortunate part of mankind ſtand
humble ſpectators of their encroachments. But the air no limitations can
bound, nor any land-marks reſtrain. In this benign element, all mankind can
boaſt an equal poſſeſſion; and for this we all have equal obligations
to Heaven. We conſume a part of it, for our own ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, while we
live; and, when we die, our putrefying bodies give back the ſupply, which,
during life, we had accumulated from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral maſs.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XX. Of Winds, irregular and regular.</head>
            <p>WIND is a current of air. Experimental philoſophers produce an
artificial wind, by an inſtrument called an aeolipile. This is nothing more
than an hollow copper ball, with a long pipe; a tea kettle might be readily
made into one, if it were entirely cloſed at the lid, and the ſpout left
open; through this ſpout it is to be filled with water, and then ſet upon
the fire, by which means it produces a violent blaſt, like wind, which
continues while there is any water remaining in the inſtrument. In this
manner water is converted into a ruſhing air; which, if caught as it goes
out, and left to cool, is again quickly converted into its former element.
Beſides this, as was mentioned in the former chapter, almoſt every
ſubſtance contains ſome portions of air. Vegetables, or the bodies of
animals left to putrefy, produce it in a very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious manner. But it is not
only ſeen thus eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping from bodies, but it may be very eaſily made to
enter into them. A quantity of air may be compreſſed into water, ſo as to
be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately blended with it. It finds a much eaſier admiſſion into
wine, or any fermented <pb n="338" facs="tcp:0823800101:361"/> liquor; and an eaſier ſtill,
into ſpirits of wine. Some ſalts ſuck up the air in ſuch quantities,
that they are made ſenſibly heavier thereby, and often are melted by its
moiſture. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, moſt bodies, being found either capable of
receiving or affording it, we are not to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at thoſe ſtreams
of air that are continually fleeting round the globe. Minerals, vegetables, and
animals, contribute to encreaſe the current; and are ſending off their
conſtant ſupplies. Theſe, as they are differently affected by cold or
heat, by mixture or putrefaction, all yield dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent quantities of air at
different times; and the loudeſt tempeſts, and moſt rapid whirlwinds, are
formed from their united contributions.</p>
            <p>The ſun is the principal inſtrument in rarefying the juices of
plants, ſo as to give an eſcape to their impriſoned air; it is alſo
equally operative in promoting the putrefaction of animals. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
exhalations are more frequently raiſed by ſubterranean heat. The moon, the
other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, the ſeaſons, are all combined in producing theſe effects
in a ſmaller degree. Mountains give a direction to the courſes of the air.
Fires carry a current of air along their body. Night and day alternately chill
and warm the earth, and produce an alternate current of its vapours. Theſe,
and an hundred other cauſes, may be <pb n="339" facs="tcp:0823800101:362"/> aſſigned for
the variety, and the activity of the winds, their continual change, and
uncertain duration.</p>
            <p>With us on land, therefore, as the wind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from ſo many
cauſes, and meets ſuch a variety of obſtacles, there can be but little
hopes of ever bringing its motions to conform to theory; or of foretelling how
it may blow a minute to come. The great Bacon, indeed, was of opinion, that by
a cloſe and regular hiſtory of the winds, continued for a number of ages
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the particulars of each obſervation reduced to general maxims,
we might at laſt come to underſtand the variations of this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious
element; and that we could foretell the certainty of a wind, with as much
eaſe as we now foretell the return of an eclipſe. Indeed, his own
beginnings in this arduous undertaking, ſeem to ſpeak the poſſibility
of its ſucceſs; but, unhappily for mankind, this inveſtigation is the
work of ages, and we want a Bacon to direct the proceſs.</p>
            <p>To be able, therefore, with any plauſibility, to account for the
variations of the wind upon land, is not to be at preſent expected; and to
underſtand any thing of their nature, we muſt have recourſe to thoſe
places where they are more permanent and ſteady. This uniformity 
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0823800101:363"/> and ſteadineſs we are chiefly to expect upon the
ocean. There, where there is no variety of ſubſtances to furniſh the air
with various and inconſtant ſupplies, where there are no moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to
direct the courſe of its current, but where all is extenſively uniform and
even; in ſuch a place, the wind ariſing from a ſimple cauſe, muſt
have but one ſimple motion. In fact, we find it ſo. There are many parts of
the world where the winds, that with us are ſo uncertain, pay their ſtated
viſits. In ſome places, they are found to blow one way by day, and another
by night; in others, for one half of the year, they go in a direction contrary
to their former courſe: but what is more extraordinary ſtill, there are
ſome places where the winds never change, but for ever blow the ſame way.
This is particularly found to obtain between the tropics in the Atlantic and
Aethiopic oceans; as well as in the great Pacific ſea.</p>
            <p>Few things ſurely can appear more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary to a perſon who
has never been out of our variable latitudes, than this ſteady wind, that for
ever ſits in the ſail, ſending the veſſel forward; and as effectually
preventing its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. He who has been taught to conſider that nothing in
the world is ſo variable as the winds, muſt certainly be ſurprized to
find a place where <pb n="341" facs="tcp:0823800101:364"/> there is nothing more uniform. With
us their inconſtancy has become a proverb; with the natives of thoſe
diſtant climates, they may talk of a friend or a miſtreſs as fixed and
unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as the winds, and mean a compliment by the compariſon. When our
ſhips are once ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived into the proper latitudes of the great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific
ocean, the mariner forgets the helm, and his ſkill becomes almoſt
uſeleſs: neither ſtorms nor tempeſts are known to deform the glaſſy
boſom of that immenſe ſheet of waters; a gentle breeze, that for ever
blows in the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, reſts upon the canvas, and ſpeeds the
navigator. In the ſpace of ſix weeks, ſhips are thus known to croſs an
immenſe ocean, that takes more than ſo many months to return. Upon
returning, the trade-wind, which has been propitious, is then avoided; the
mariner is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally obliged to ſteer into the northern lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and to
take the advantage of every caſual wind that offers, to aſſiſt him into
port. This wind, which blows with ſuch conſtancy one way, is known to
prevail not only in the Pacific ocean, but alſo in the Atlantic, between the
coaſts of Guinea and Brazil; and, likewiſe, in the Aethiopic ocean. This
ſeems to be the great univerſal wind, blowing from the eaſt to the 
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0823800101:365"/> weſt, that prevails in all the extenſive oceans
where the land does not frequently break the general current. Were the whole
ſurface of the globe an ocean, there would probably be but this one wind, for
ever blowing from the eaſt, and purſuing the motions of the ſun
weſtward. All the other winds ſeem ſubordinate to this; and many of them
are made from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations of its current. To form, therefore, any
conception relative to the variations of the wind in general, it is fitteſt
to begin with that which never varies.</p>
            <p>There have been many theories to explain this invariable motion of
the winds; among the reſt, we cannot omit that of Doctor Lyſter, for its
ſtrangeneſs. 
<q rend="inline">"The ſea," ſays he, "in thoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, is
generally covered over with green weeds, for a great extent; and the air
produced from the vegetable perſpiration of theſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the
trade-wind."</q> The theory of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſius was not quite ſo abſurd. He
alledged, that the earth went round faſter than its atmoſphere at the
equator; ſo that its motion, from weſt to eaſt, gave the atmoſphere an
imaginary one from eaſt to weſt; and thus an eaſt-wind was eternally
ſeen to prevail. Rejecting thoſe arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinions, conceived without
force, and aſſerted without proof, Doctor Halley has given 
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0823800101:366"/> one more plauſible; which ſeems to be the reigning
ſyſtem of the day.</p>
            <p>To conceive his opinion clearly, let us for a moment ſuppoſe the
whole ſurface of the earth to be an ocean, and the air encompaſſing it on
every ſide, without motion. Now it is evident, that that part of the air that
lies directly under the beams of the ſun, will be rarefied; and if the ſun
remained for ever in the ſame place, there would be a great vacuity in the
air, if I may ſo expreſs it, beneath the place where the ſun ſtood. But
the ſun moving forward, from eaſt to weſt, this vacuity will follow too,
and ſtill be made under it. But while it goes on to make new vacuities, the
air will ruſh in to fill up thoſe the ſun has already made; in other
words, as it is ſtill travelling forward, the air will continually be
ruſhing in behind, and purſue its motions from eaſt to weſt. In this
manner, the air is put into motion by day; and by night, the parts continue to
impel each other, till the next return of the ſun, that gives a new force to
the circulation.</p>
            <p>In this manner is explained the conſtant eaſt-wind that is found
blowing round the globe, near the equator. But it is alſo known, that as we
recede from the equator on either ſide, we come into a trade-wind, that
continually blows <pb n="344" facs="tcp:0823800101:367"/> from the poles, from the north on one
ſide, or the ſouth on the other, both directing towards the equator. This
alſo proceeds from a ſimilar cauſe with the former; for the air being
more rarefied in thoſe places over which the ſun more directly darts its
rays, the currents will come both from the north and the ſouth, to fill up
the intermediate vacuity.</p>
            <p>Theſe two motions, namely, the general one from eaſt to weſt,
and the more particular one from both the Poles, will account for all the
phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of trade-winds; which, if the whole ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the globe were
ſea, would undoubtedly be conſtant, and for ever continue to blow in one
direction. But there are a thouſand circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to break theſe
air-currents into ſmaller ones; to drive them back againſt their general
courſe; to raiſe or depreſs them; to condenſe them into ſtorms; or to
whirl them in eddies. In conſequence of this, regard muſt be often had to
the nature of the ſoil, the poſition of the high mountains, the courſe of
the rivers, and even to the luxuriance of vegetation.</p>
            <p>If a country lying directly under the ſun, be very flat and
ſandy, and if the land be low and extenſive, the heats occaſioned by the
reflection of the ſun-beams, produces a very great rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the air.
The deſarts of Africa, which <pb n="345" facs="tcp:0823800101:368"/> are conformable to this
deſcription, are ſcarce ever fanned by a breath of wind by day; but the
burning ſun is continually ſeen blazing in intolerable ſplendor above
them. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, all along the coaſts of Guinea, the wind is always
perceived blowing in upon land, in order to fill up the vacuity cauſed by the
ſun's ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. In thoſe ſhores, therefore, the wind blows in a
contrary direction to that of its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral current; and is conſtantly found
ſetting in from the weſt.</p>
            <p>From the ſame cauſe it happens, that thoſe conſtant calms,
attended with deluges of rain, are found in the ſame part of the ocean. For
this tract being placed in the middle, between the weſterly winds blowing on
the coaſt of Guinea, and the eaſterly trade-winds that move at ſome
diſtance from ſhore, in a contrary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, the tendency of that part of
the air that lies between theſe two oppoſite currents, is indifferent to
either, and ſo reſts between both in torpid ſerenity; and the weight of
the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent atmoſphere, being diminiſhed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual contrary
winds blowing from hence, it is unable to keep the vapours ſuſpended that
are copiouſly borne thither; ſo that they fall in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual rains.</p>
            <p>But it is not to be ſuppoſed, that any theory 
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0823800101:369"/> can account for all the phaenomena of even thoſe winds
that are known to be moſt regular. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead, therefore, of a complete
ſyſtem of the trade-winds, we muſt rather be content with an imperfect
hiſtory. Theſe<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. ii. p.

               </note>, as was ſaid, being the reſult of a combination of
effects, aſſume as great a variety as the cauſes producing them are
various.</p>
            <p>Beſides the great general wind abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, in thoſe parts
of the Atlantic that lie under the temperate zone, a north wind pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
conſtantly during the months of October, November, December, and January.
Theſe, therefore, are the moſt favourable months for embarking for the
Eaſt-Indies, in order to take the benefit of theſe winds, for croſſing
the line: and it has been often found, by experience, that thoſe who had
ſet ſail five months before, were not in the leaſt farther advanced in
their voyage, than thoſe who waited for the favourable wind. During the
winter of Nova Zembla, and the other arctic countries, a north wind reigns
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt continually. In the Cape de Verde iſlands, a ſouth wind prevails
during the month of July. At the Cape of Good Hope, a north-weſt wind blows
during the month of September. There are alſo regular winds, produced by
various cauſes, upon land. The ancient Greeks were the <pb n="347" facs="tcp:0823800101:370"/>
firſt who obſerved a conſtant breeze, produced by the melting of the
ſnows, in ſome high neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring countries. This was perceived in Greece,
Thrace, Macedonia, and the Aegean ſea. The ſame kind of winds are now
remarked in the kingdom of Congo, and the moſt ſouthern parts of Africa.
The flux and reflux of the ſea alſo produces ſome regular winds, that
ſerve the purpoſes of trade; and, in general, it may be obſerved, that
wherever there is a ſtrong current of water, there is a current of air that
ſeems to attend it.</p>
            <p>Beſide theſe winds that are found to blow in one direction,
there are, as was ſaid before, others that blow for certain months of the
year one way, and the reſt of the year the contrary way: theſe are called
the Monſoons, from a famous pilot of that name, who firſt uſed them in
navigation with ſucceſs<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Varenii Geographia
Geurculis, cap. 20.</bibl>
               </note>. In all that part of the ocean that lies
between Africa and India, the eaſt winds begin at the month of January, and
continue till about the commencement of June. In the month of Auguſt, or
September, the contrary direction takes place; and the weſt winds prevail for
three or four months. The interval between theſe winds, that is to ſay,
from the end of June to the beginning of <pb n="348" facs="tcp:0823800101:371"/> Auguſt, there
is no fixed wind; but the ſea is uſually toſſed by violent tempeſts,
proceeding from the north. Theſe winds are always ſubject to their
greateſt variations, as they approach the land; ſo that on one ſide of
the great penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula of India, the coaſts are, for near half the year,
harraſſed by violent hurricanes, and north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern tempeſts; while, on the
oppoſite ſide, and all along the coaſts of Coromandel, theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
tempeſts are wholly unknown. At Java, and Ceylon, a weſt wind begins to
reign in the month of September; but at fifteen days of ſouth latitude, this
wind is found to be loſt, and the great general trade-wind from the eaſt,
is perceived to prevail. On the contrary, at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, in China, the weſt wind
begins at March; ſo that theſe Monſoons prevail, at different
ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, throughout the Indies. So that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner takes one part of the
year to go from Java to the Moluccas; another from Cochin to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucca; another
from Molucca to China; and ſtill another to direct him from China to
Japan.</p>
            <p>There are winds alſo that may be conſidered as peculiar to
certain coaſts; for example, the ſouth wind is almoſt conſtant upon the
coaſts of Chili and Peru; weſtern winds almoſt conſtantly prevail on
the coaſt of Terra Magellanica; and <pb n="349" facs="tcp:0823800101:372"/> in the environs of
the Streights le Maire. On the coaſts of Malabar, north and north-weſt
winds prevail continually; along the coaſt of Guinea, the north-weſt wind
is alſo very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; and, at a diſtance from the coaſts, the
north-eaſt is always found prevailing. From the beginning of November to the
end of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a weſt wind prevails on the coaſts of Japan; and, during
the whole winter, no ſhips can leave the port of Cochin, on account of the
impetuoſity of the winds that ſet upon the coaſt. Theſe blow with
ſuch vehemence that the ports are entirely choaked up with ſand, and even
boats themſelves are not able to enter. However, the eaſt winds that
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail for the other half of the year, clear the mouths of their harbours
from the accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the preceding winter, and ſet the confined ſhips
at liberty. At the Streights of Babelmandel there is a ſouth wind that
perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically returns, and which is always followed by a north-eaſt.</p>
            <p>Beſide winds thus peculiar to certain coaſts, there are others
found to prevail on all the coaſts, in warm climates; which, during one part
of the day, blow from the ſhore, and, during another part of it, blow from
the ſea. The ſea-breeze, in thoſe countries, as Dampier 
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0823800101:373"/> obſerves, commonly riſes in the morning, about nine,
proceeding ſlowly, in a fine ſmall black curl, upon the ſurface of the
water, and making its way to refreſh the ſhore. It is gentle at firſt,
but encreaſes gradually till twelve, then inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſinks away, and
is totally huſhed at five. Upon its ceaſing, the land-breeze begins to take
its turn, which increaſes till twelve at night, and is ſucceeded, in the
morning, by the ſea-breeze again. Without all doubt, nothing could have been
more fortunate, for the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the warm countries, where thoſe
breezes blow, than this alternate refreſhment, which they feel at thoſe
ſeaſons when it is moſt wanted. The heat, on ſome coaſts, would be
inſupportable, were it not for ſuch a ſupply of air, when the ſun has
rarefied all that which lay more immediately under the coaſt. The
ſea-breeze temperates the heat of the ſun by day; and the land-breeze
corrects the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the dews, and vapours, by night. Where theſe
breezes, therefore, prevail, and they are very common, the inhabitants enjoy a
ſhare of health, and happineſs, unknown to thoſe that live much farther
up the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or ſuch as live in ſimilar latitudes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this
advantange. The cauſe of theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly ſeems to ariſe from the
rarefaction of <pb n="351" facs="tcp:0823800101:374"/> the air by the ſun, as their duration
continues with its appearance, and alters when it goes down. The ſun, it is
obſerved, equally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing his beams upon land and ſea, the land, being
a more ſolid body than the water, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a greater quantity of heat, and
reflects it more ſtrongly. Being thus, therefore, heated to a greater degree
than the waters, it, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, drives the air from land out to ſea;
but, its influence being removed, the air re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to fill up the former
vacuity. Such is the uſual method of accounting for this phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena; but,
unfortunately, theſe ſea and land breezes are viſitants that come at all
hours. On the coaſts of Malabar<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol.
ii. p. 252.</bibl>
               </note>, the land-breezes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at midnight, and continue
till noon; then the ſea-breezes take their turn, and continue till midnight
again. While, again, at Congo, the land-breezes begin at five, and continue
till nine the next day.</p>
            <p>But, if the cauſe of theſe be ſo inſcrutable, that are, as
we ſee, tolerably regular in their viſitations, what ſhall we ſay to
the winds of our own climate, that are continually ſhifting, and incapable of
reſt? Some general cauſes may be aſſigned, which nothing but particular
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience can apply. And, in the firſt place, it <pb n="352" facs="tcp:0823800101:375"/> may
be obſerved, that clouds, and heat, and, in ſhort, whatever either
encreaſes the denſity or the elaſticity of the air, in any one place,
will produce a wind there: for the encreaſed activity of the air thus
preſſing more powerfully on the parts of it that are adjacent, will drive
them forward, and thus go on, in a current, till the whole comes to an
equality.</p>
            <p>In this manner, as a denſer air produces a wind, on the one hand;
ſo will any accident, that contributes to lighten the air, produce it on the
other: for, a lighter air may be conſidered as a vacuity, into which the
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring air will ruſh: and hence it happens, that when the barometer
marks a peculiar light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the air, it is no wonder that it foretells a
ſtorm.</p>
            <p>The winds upon large waters are generally more regular than thoſe
upon land. The wind at ſea generally blows with an even ſteady gale; the
wind at land puffs by intervals, encreaſing its ſtrength, and remitting it,
without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent cauſe. This, in a great meaſure, may be owing to the
many mountains, towers, or trees, that it meets in its way, all contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
either to turn it from its courſe, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt its paſſage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:0823800101:376"/>The eaſt wind blows more conſtantly than
any other, and for an obvious reaſon: all other winds are, in ſome
meaſure, deviations from it, and partly may owe their origin thereto. It is
generally, likewiſe, the moſt powerful, and for the ſame reaſon.</p>
            <p>There are often double currents of the air. While the wind blows one
way, we frequently ſee the clouds move another. This is almoſt ever the
caſe before thunder; for it is well known that the thunder cloud always moves
againſt the wind: the cauſe of this ſurprizing appearance has hitherto
remained a ſecret. From hence we may conclude, that weathercocks only inform
us of that current of the air, which is near the ſurface of the earth; but
are often erroneous with regard to the upper regions; and, in fact, Derham has
often found them erroneous.</p>
            <p>Winds are generally more powerful on ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſituations than on
the plain, becauſe their progreſs is interrupted by fewer obſtacles. In
proportion as we aſcend the heights of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the violence of the
weather ſeems to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, until we have got above the region of ſtorms,
where all is uſually calm and ſerene. Sometimes, however, the ſtorms
riſe even to the tops of the higheſt mountains; as we learn from thoſe
who have been on the Andes, and <pb n="354" facs="tcp:0823800101:377"/> as we are convinced by
the deep ſnows that crown even the higheſt.</p>
            <p>Winds blowing from the ſea are generally moiſter, and more
attended with rains, than thoſe which blow over extenſive tracts of land:
for the ſea gives off more vapours to the air, and theſe are rolled forward
upon land, by the winds blowing from thence<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Derham's Phiſico Theol.</bibl>
               </note>. For this reaſon
our eaſterly winds, that blow from the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, are dry, in compariſon
of thoſe that blow from the ſurface of the ocean, with which we are
ſurrounded on every other quarter.</p>
            <p>In general the winds are more boiſterous in ſpring and autumn,
than at other ſeaſons: for, that being the time of high tides, the ſea
may communicate a part of its motions to the winds. The ſun, and moon,
alſo, which then have a greater effect upon the waters, may alſo have
ſome influence upon the winds; for, there being a great body of air
ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the globe, which, if condenſed into water, would cover it to
the depth of thirty-two feet, it is evident that the ſun and moon will, to a
proportionable degree, affect the atmoſphere, and make a tide of air. This
tide will be ſcarce perceivable, indeed; but, without doubt, it actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
exiſts; and may contribute to encreaſe the <pb n="355" facs="tcp:0823800101:378"/> vernal
and autumnal ſtorms, which are then known to prevail.</p>
            <p>Upon narrowing the paſſage through which the air is driven, both
the denſity and the ſwiftneſs of the wind is encreaſed. For as
cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of water flow with greater force and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity by narrowing their
channels, ſo alſo will a current of air, driven through a contracted
ſpace, grow more violent and irreſiſtible. Hence we find thoſe dreadful
ſtorms that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the defiles of mountains, where the wind, puſhing
from behind through a narrow chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, at once encreaſes in ſpeed and
denſity, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, or tearing up, every obſtacle that riſes to
obſtruct its paſſage.</p>
            <p>Winds reflected from the ſides of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and towers, are often
found to be more forceful than thoſe in direct progreſſion. This we
frequently perceive near lofty buildings, ſuch as churches or ſteeples,
where winds are generally known to prevail, and that much more powerful than at
ſome diſtance. The air, in this caſe, by ſtriking againſt the ſide
of the building, acquires additional denſity and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, blows with more
force.</p>
            <p>Theſe differing degrees of denſity, which the air is found to
poſſeſs, ſufficiently ſhew that the force of the winds do not depend
upon their velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city <pb n="356" facs="tcp:0823800101:379"/> alone; ſo that thoſe
inſtruments called <hi>anemometers,</hi> which are made to meaſure the
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity of the wind, will by no means give us certain information of the
force of the ſtorm. In order to eſtimate this with exactneſs we ought to
know its denſity; which alſo theſe are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to diſcover. For
this reaſon we often ſee ſtorms, with very powerful effects, that do not
ſeem to ſhew any great ſpeed; and, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, we ſee theſe
wind meaſurers go round, with great ſwiftneſs, when ſcarce any damage
has followed from the ſtorm.</p>
            <p>Such is the nature, and the inconſtancy, of the irregular winds
with which we are beſt acquainted. But their effects are much more formidable
in thoſe climates, near the tropics, where they are often found to break in
upon the ſteady courſe of the trade-winds, and to mark their paſſage
with deſtruction. With us the tempeſt is but rarely known, and its ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages
are regiſtered as an uncommon calamity; but, in the countries that lie
between the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics, and for a good ſpace beyond them, its viſits are
frequent, and its effects anticipated. In theſe regions the winds vary their
terrors; ſometimes involving all things in a ſuffocating heat; ſometimes
mixing all the elements of fire, air, earth, and water together; ſometimes,
with a momentary ſwiftneſs, paſſing over the face <pb n="357" facs="tcp:0823800101:380"/> of the country, and deſtroying all things in their paſſage;
and ſometimes raiſing whole ſandy deſerts in one country, to depoſit
them upon ſome other. We have little reaſon, therefore, to envy theſe
climates, the luxuriance of their ſoil, or the brightneſs of their ſkies.
Our own muddy atmoſphere, that wraps us round in obſcurity, though it fails
to gild our proſpects with ſun-ſhine, or our groves with fruitage,
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs anſwers the calls of induſtry. They may boaſt of a
plentiful, but precarious harveſt; while, with us, the labourer toils in a
certain expectation of a moderate, but an happy return.</p>
            <p>In Egypt<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. ii. p.
258</bibl>
               </note>, a kingdom ſo noted for its fertility, and the brightneſs
of its atmoſphere, during ſummer, the ſouth winds are ſo hot, that they
almoſt ſtop reſpiration; beſides which, they are charged with ſuch
quantities of ſand, that they ſometimes darken the air, as with a thick
cloud. Theſe ſands are ſo fine, and driven with ſuch violence, that
they penetrate every where; even into cheſts, be they ſhut never ſo
cloſely. If theſe winds happen to continue for any length of time, they
produce epidemic diſeaſes; and are often followed by a great mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. It
is alſo found to rain but very ſeldom in that country; however, the want of
ſhowers <pb n="358" facs="tcp:0823800101:381"/> is richly compenſated by the copiouſneſs
of their dews, which greatly tend to promote vegetation.</p>
            <p>In Perſia, the winter begins in November, and continues till
March. The cold at that time is intenſe enough to congeal the water; and
ſnow falls, in abundance, upon their mountains. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the months of March
and April, winds ariſe, that blow with great force, and ſeem to uſher in
the heats of ſummer. Theſe return again, in autumn, with ſome violence;
without, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, producing any dreadful effects. But, during their ſummer,
all along the coaſts of the Perſian Gulph, a very dangerous wind pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails,
which the natives call the Sameyel, ſtill more dreadful and burning than that
of Egypt, and attended with inſtant and fatal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. This terrible
blaſt, which was, perhaps, the peſtilence of the ancients, inſtantly
kills all thoſe that it involves in its paſſage. What its malignity
conſiſts in, none can tell, as none have ever ſurvived its effects, to
give information. It frequently, as I am told, aſſumes a viſible form;
and darts, in a kind of bluiſh vapour, along the ſurface of the country.
The natives, not only of Perſia, but Arabia, talk of its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects with
terror; and their poets have not failed to heighten them, with the
aſſiſtance of imagination. They have deſcribed it as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0823800101:382"/> the conduct of a miniſter of vengeance, who governs
its terrors, and raiſes, or depreſſes it, as he thinks proper<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Herbelot. Bibliotheque Oriental.</bibl>
               </note>. Theſe
deadly winds are alſo known along the coaſts of India, at Neca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patan,
Maſulipatan, and Petapoli. But, luckily for mankind, the ſhortneſs of
their duration diminiſhes the injuries that might enſue from their
malignity.</p>
            <p>The Cape of Good Hope, as well as many iſlands in the
Weſt-Indies, are famous for their hurricanes, and that extraordinary kind of
cloud which is ſaid to produce them. This cloud, which is the fore-runner of
an approaching hurricane, appears, when firſt ſeen, like a ſmall black
ſpot, on the verge of the horizon; and is called, by ſailors, the bull's
eye, from being ſeen ſo minute at a vaſt diſtance. All this time, a
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect calm reigns over the ſea and land, while the cloud grows gradually
broader as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. At length, coming to the place where its fury is to
fall, it inveſts the whole horizon with darkneſs. During all the time of
its approach, an hollow murmur is heard in the cavities of the mountains; and
beaſts and animals, ſenſible of its approach, are ſeen running over the
fields, to ſeek for ſhelter. Nothing can be more terrible than its violence
when it begins. The houſes in thoſe countries, <pb n="360" facs="tcp:0823800101:383"/> which
are made of timber, the better to reſiſt its fury, bend to the blaſt like
oſiers, and again recover their rectitude. The ſun, which, but a moment
before, blazed with meridian ſplendor, is totally ſhut out; and a midnight
darkneſs prevails, except that the air is inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly illuminated with
gleams of lightening, by which one can eaſily ſee to read. The rain falls,
at the ſame time, in torrents; and its deſcent has been reſembled to what
pours from the ſpouts of our houſes after a violent ſhower. Theſe
hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes are not leſs offenſive to the ſenſe of ſmell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo;
and never come without leaving the moſt noiſome ſtench behind them. If
the ſeamen alſo lay by their wet cloaths, for twenty-four hours, they are
all found ſwarming with little white maggots, that were brought with the
hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane. Our firſt mariners, when they viſited theſe regions, were
ignorant of its effects, and the ſigns of its approach; their ſhips,
therefore, were daſhed to the bottom at the firſt onſet; and numberleſs
were the wrecks which the hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane occaſioned. But, at preſent, being
fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned of its approach, they ſtrip their maſts of all their ſails,
and thus patiently abide its fury. Theſe hurricanes are common in all the
tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical climates. On the coaſts of Guinea they have frequently three, or
four, in a day, that thus ſhut out the heavens, for a little ſpace; 
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0823800101:384"/> and when paſt leave all again in former ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.

coaſt, in the intervals of the trade winds; the approach of which clears the
air of its meteors, and gives theſe mortal ſhowers that little degree of

the months of April and May; they are known, at Loango, from January to April;
on the oppoſite coaſt of Africa, the hurricane ſeaſon begins at May;
and, in general, whenever a trade wind begins to ceaſe, theſe irregular
tempeſts are found to exert their fury.</p>
            <p>All this is terrible; but there is a tempeſt, known in thoſe
climates, more formidable than any we have hitherto been deſcribing, which is
called, by the Spaniards, a Tornado. As the former was ſeen arriving from one
part of the heavens, and making a line of deſtruction; ſo the winds in this
ſeem to blow from every quarter, and ſettle upon one deſtined place, with
ſuch fury, that nothing can reſiſt their vehemence. When they have all
met, in their central ſpot, then the whirlwind begins with circular rapidity.
The ſphere, every moment widens, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to turn, and catches every
object that lies within its attraction. This, alſo, like the former, is
preceded by a flattering calm; the air is every where huſhed; and the ſea
is as <pb n="362" facs="tcp:0823800101:385"/> ſmooth as poliſhed glaſs: however, as its
effects are more dreadful than thoſe of the ordinary hurricane, the mariner
tries all the power of his ſkill to avoid it; which, if he fails of doing,
there is the greateſt danger of his going to the bottom. All along the
coaſts of Guinea, beginning about two degrees north of the line, and ſo
downward, lengthwiſe, for about a thouſand miles, and as many broad, the
ocean is unnavigable, upon account of theſe tornados. In this torpid region
there reigns unceaſing tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nados, or continual calms; among which, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſhip is ſo unhappy as to fall, is totally deprived of all power of
eſcaping. In this dreadful repoſe of all the elements, the ſolitary
veſſel is obliged to continue, without a ſingle breeze to aſſiſt
the mariner's wiſhes, except thoſe whirlwinds, which only ſerve to
encreaſe his calamity. At preſent, therefore, this part of the ocean is
totally avoided; and, although there may be much gold along the coaſts of
that part of Africa, to tempt avarice, yet there is ſomething, much more
dreadful than the fabled dragon of antiquity, to guard the treaſure. As the
internal parts of that country are totally unknown to travellers, from their
burning ſands and extenſive deſarts, ſo here we find a vaſt tract of
ocean, lying off its ſhores, equally unviſited by the mariner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:0823800101:386"/>But of all thoſe terrible tempeſts that
deform the face of Nature, and repreſs human pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, the ſandy
tempeſts of Arabia and Africa, are the moſt terrible, and ſtrike the
imagination moſt ſtrongly. To conceive a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per idea of theſe, we are by
no means to ſuppoſe them reſembling thoſe whirlwinds of duſt that we
ſometimes ſee ſcattering in our air, and ſprinkling their contents upon
our roads, or meadows. The ſand-ſtorm of Africa, exhibits a very different
appearance. As the ſand of which the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind is compoſed, is
exceſſively fine, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt reſembles the parts of water, its motion
entirely reſembles that of a fluid; and the whole plain ſeems to float
onward, like a ſlow inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. The body of ſand thus rolling, is deep
enough to bury houſes and palaces in its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom: travellers who are
croſſing thoſe extenſive deſerts, perceive its approach at a
diſtance; and, in general, have time to avoid it, or turn out of its way, as
it generally extends but to a moderate breadth. However, when it is extremely
rapid, or very extenſive, as ſometimes is the caſe, no ſwiftneſs, no
art, can avail; nothing then remains, but to meet death with fortitude, and
ſubmit to be buried alive with reſignation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:0823800101:387"/>It is happy for us of Britain, that we have no
ſuch calamity to fear; for, from this, even ſome parts of Europe are not
entirely free. We have an account given us, in the Hiſtory of the French
Academy, of a miſerable town in France, that is conſtantly in danger of
being buried under a ſimilar inundation; with which I will take leave to
cloſe this chapter.

which before the year 1666 was inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, but now lies deſerted, by reaſon
of the ſands which cover it, to the height of twenty feet; and which every
year advance more and more in land, and gain ground continually. From the time
mentioned above, the ſand has buried more than ſix leagues of the country
inward; and it is now but half a league from the town of St. Paul; ſo that,
in all appearance, the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants muſt be obliged to abandon it entirely.
In the country that has been overwhelmed, there are ſtill to be ſeen the
tops of ſome ſteeples peeping through the ſand, and many chimnies that
ſtill remain above this ſandy ocean. The inhabitants, however, had
ſufficient time to eſcape; but being deprived of their little all, they had
no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource <pb n="365" facs="tcp:0823800101:388"/> but begging for their
ſubſiſtence. This calamity chiefly owes its advancement to a north, or an
eaſt-wind, raiſing the ſand, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fine, in ſuch great
quantities, and with ſuch velocity, that M. Deſlands, who gave the account,
ſays, that while he was walking near the place, during a moderate breeze of
wind, he was obliged, from time to time, to ſhake the ſand from his cloaths
and his hat, on which it was lodged in great quantities, and made them too
heavy to be eaſily borne. Still further, when the wind was violent, it drove
the ſand acroſs a little arm of the ſea, into the town of Roſcoff, and
covered the ſtreets of that place two feet deep; ſo that they have been
obliged to carry it off in carts. It may alſo be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that there are
ſeveral particles of iron mixed with the ſand, which are readily affected
by the loadſtone. The part of the coaſt that furniſhes theſe ſands,
is a tract of about four leagues in length; and is upon a level with the ſea
at high-water. The ſhore lies in ſuch a manner as to leave its ſands
ſubject only to the north and eaſt winds, that bear them farther up the
ſhore. It is eaſy to conceive how the ſame ſand that has at one time
been borne a ſhort way in land, may, by ſome ſucceeding and ſtronger 
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0823800101:389"/> blaſt, be carried up much higher; and thus the whole
may continue advancing forward, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luging the plain, and totally deſtroying
its fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility. At the ſame time, the ſea, from whence this deluge of
ſand proceeds, may furniſh it in inexhauſtible quantities. This unhappy
country, thus overwhelmed in ſo ſingular a manner, may well juſtify what
the ancients and the moderns have reported concerning thoſe tempeſts of
ſand in Africa, that are ſaid to deſtroy villages, and even armies, in

            <head>CHAP. XXI. Of Meteors, and ſuch Appearances as reſult from a
Combination of the Elements.</head>
            <p>IN proportion as the ſubſtances of nature are more compounded
and combined, their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances become more inexplicable and amazing. The
properties of water have been very nearly aſcertained. Many of the qualities
of air, earth, and fire, have been diſcovered, and eſtimated; but when
theſe come to be united by Nature, they often produce a reſult which no
artificial combinations can imitate; and we ſtand ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, that although
we are poſſeſſed of all thoſe ſubſtances which Nature makes uſe
of, ſhe ſhews herſelf a much more various operator than the moſt
ſkilful chymiſt ever appeared to be. Every cloud that moves, and every
ſhower that falls, ſerves to mortify the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's pride, and to
ſhew him hidden qualities in air and water, that he finds it difficult to
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. Dews, hail, ſnow, and thunder, are not leſs difficult for being
more common. Indeed, when we reflect on the manner in which Nature performs any
one of theſe operations, our wonder encreaſes. To ſee water, which is
heavier than air, riſing in air, and then falling in <pb n="368" facs="tcp:0823800101:391"/> a
form ſo very different from that in which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> roſe; to ſee the ſame fluid at one time deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the
form of hail, at another in that of ſnow; to ſee two clouds, by daſhing
againſt each other, producing an electrical fire, which no watery
compoſition that we know of can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; theſe, I ſay, ſerve
ſufficiently to excite our wonder; and ſtill the more, in proportion as the
objects are ever preſſing on our curioſity. Much, however, has been
written concerning the manner in which Nature operates in theſe productions;
as nothing is ſo ungrateful to mankind as hopeleſs ignorance.</p>
            <p>And firſt, with regard to the manner in which water evaporates,
and riſes to form clouds, much has been advanced, and many theories
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed. All water<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>, ſay ſome, has a quantity of air mixed with it; and
the heat of the ſun dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, diſengages the particles of this air
from the groſſer fluid: the ſun's rays being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected back from the
water, carry back with them thoſe bubbles of air and water which, being
lighter than the condenſed air, will aſcend till they meet with a more
rarefied air; and they will then ſtand ſuſpended. Experience, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
proves nothing of all this. Particles of air or fire, are not thus known to
aſcend with a thin coat of water; and, in fact, we know that 
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0823800101:392"/> the little particles of ſteam are ſolid drops of
water. But beſides this, water is known to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate more powerfully in the
ſevereſt froſt, than when the air is moderately warm<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Memoires de l'Accademie des Sciences, an.
1705.</bibl>
               </note>. Doctor Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton, therefore, of the univerſity of
Dublin, rejecting this theory, has endeavoured to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh another.
According to him, as aqua fortis is a menſtruum that diſſolves iron, and
keeps it mixed in the fluid; as aqua regia is a menſtruum that diſſolves
gold; or as water diſſolves ſalts to a certain quantity; ſo air is a
menſtruum that corrodes and diſſolves a certain quantity of water, and
keeps it ſuſpended above. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ingenious this may be, it can hardly
be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; as we know, by Marriotte's experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Mariotte, de la Nature de l'Air, p. 97, 106.</bibl>
               </note>,
that if water and air be encloſed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inſtead of the air's acting as
a menſtruum upon the water, the water will act as a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum upon the
air, and take it all up. We know alſo, that of two bodies, that which is
moſt fluid and penetrating, is moſt likely to be the menſtruum of the
other; but water is more fluid and penetrating than air, and, therefore, the
moſt likely of the two to be the menſtruum. We know that all bodies are
more ſpeedily acted upon, the more their parts are brought into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact 
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0823800101:393"/> with the menſtruum that diſſolves them: but water,
incloſed with compreſt air, is not the more diminiſhed thereby<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>See Boyle's Works, vol. ii. p. 619.</bibl>
               </note>. In
ſhort, we know, that cold, which diminiſhes the force of other
menſtruums, is often found to promote evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. In this variety of
opinion, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of conjecture, I cannot avoid thinking that a theory
of evaporation may be formed upon very ſimple and obvious principles, and
embarraſſed, as far as I can conceive, with very few objections.</p>
            <p>We know that a repelling power prevails in nature, not leſs than
an attractive one. This repulſion prevails ſtrongly between the body of
fire and that of water. If I plunge the end of a red hot bar of iron into a
veſſel of water, the fluid riſes, and large drops of it fly up in all
manner of directions, every part bubbling and ſteaming until the iron be
cold. Why may we not, for a moment, compare the rays of the ſun, darted
directly upon the ſurface of the water, to ſo many bars of red hot iron;
each bar, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, infinitely ſmall, but not the leſs powerful? In this
caſe, wherever a ray of fire darts, the water, from its repulſive quality,
will be driven on all ſides; and, of conſequence, as in the caſe of the
bar of iron, a part of it will riſe. The <pb n="371" facs="tcp:0823800101:394"/> parts thus
riſing, however, will be extremely ſmall; as the ray that darts is
extremely ſo. The aſſemblage of the rays darting upon the water in this
manner, will cauſe it to riſe in a light thin ſteam above the ſurface;
and as the parts of this ſteam are extremely minute, they will be lighter
than air, and, conſequently, float upon it. There is no need for
ſuppoſing them bubbles of water, filled with fire; for any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
even gold itſelf, will float on air, if its parts be made ſmall enough; or,
in other words, if its ſurface be ſufficiently encreaſed. This water,
thus diſengaged from the general maſs, will be ſtill farther attenuated
and broken by the reflected rays, and, conſequently, more adapted for
aſcending.</p>
            <p>From this plain account, every appearance in evaporation may be
eaſily deduced. The quantity of heat encreaſes evaporation, becauſe it
raiſes a greater quantity of ſteam. The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of wind encreaſes
evaporation; for, by waving the ſurface of the water, it thus expoſes a
greater ſurface to the evaporating rays. A dry froſt, in ſome meaſure,
aſſiſts the quantity of evaporation; as the quantity of rays are found to
be no way diminiſhed thereby. Moiſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone prevents evaporation;
for the rays being abſorbed, refracted, and broken, by the 
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0823800101:395"/> intervening moiſture, before they arrive at the
ſurface, cannot produce the effect; and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour will riſe in a ſmall
proportion.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have accounted for the aſcent of vapours; but to
account for their falling again, is attended with rather more difficulty. We
have already obſerved, that the particles of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, diſengaged from the
ſurface of the water, will be broken and attenuated in their aſcent, by the
reflected, and even the direct rays, that happen to ſtrike upon their minute
ſurfaces. They will, therefore, continue to aſcend, till they riſe above
the operation of the reflected rays, which reaches but to a certain height
above the ſurface of the earth. Being arrived at this region, which is cold
for want of reflected heat, they will be condenſed, and ſuſpended in the
form of clouds. Some vapours that aſcend to great heights, will be frozen
into ſnow; others, that are condenſed lower down, will put on the
appearance of a miſt, which we find the clouds to be, when we aſcend among
them, as they hang along the ſides of a mountain. Theſe clouds of ſnow
and rain, being blown about by winds, are either entirely ſcattered and
diſperſed above, or they are ſtill more condenſed by motion, like a
ſnow-ball, that grows more large and ſolid as it continues to roll. At
laſt, therefore, they will <pb n="373" facs="tcp:0823800101:396"/> become too weighty for the
air which firſt raiſed them, to ſuſtain; and they will deſcend, with
their exceſs of weight, either in ſnow or rain. But as they will fall
precipitately, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to deſcend, the air, in ſome meaſure,
will reſiſt the falling; for, as the deſcending fluid gathers velocity in
its precipitation, the air will encreaſe its reſiſtance to it, and the
water will, therefore, be thus broken into rain; as we ſee, that water which
falls from the tops of houſes, though it begins in a ſpout, ſeparates
into drops before it has got to the bottom. Were it not for this happy
interpoſition of the air, between us and the water falling from a
conſiderable height above us, a drop of rain might fall with dangerous force,
and an hail-ſtone might ſtrike us with fatal rapidity.</p>
            <p>In this manner, evaporation is produced by day; but when the ſun
goes down, a part of that vapour which his rays had excited, being no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
broken, and attenuated by the reflecting rays, it will become heavier than the
air, even before it has reached the clouds; and it will, therefore, fall back
in dews, which differ only from rain in deſcending before they have had time
to condenſe into a viſible form.</p>
            <p>Hail, the Carteſians ſay, is a frozen cloud, half melted, and
frozen again in its deſcent. <pb n="374" facs="tcp:0823800101:397"/> An hoar-froſt is but a
frozen dew. Lightening we know to be an electrical flaſh, produced by the
oppoſition of two clouds: and thunder to be the ſound proceeding from the
ſame, continued by an echo reverberated among them. It would be to very
little purpoſe, to attempt explaining exactly how theſe wonders are
effected: we have as yet but little inſight into the manner in which theſe
meteors are found to operate upon each other; and, therefore, we muſt be
contented with a detail rather of their effects than their cauſes.</p>
            <p>In our own gentle climate, where Nature wears the mildeſt and
kindeſt aſpect, every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor ſeems to befriend us. With us, rains fall
in refreſhing ſhowers, to enliven our fields, and to paint the landſcape
with a more vivid beauty. Snows cover the earth, to preſerve its tender
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables from the inclemency of the departing winter. The dews deſcend
with ſuch an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible fall as no way injures the conſtitution.
Thunder itſelf is ſeldom injurious; and it is often wiſhed by the
huſbandman, to clear the air, and to kill numberleſs inſects that are
noxious to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation. Hail is the moſt injurious meteor that is known in
our climate; but it ſeldom viſits us with violence, and then its fury is
but tranſient.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:0823800101:398"/>One of the moſt dreadful ſtorms we hear
of<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>,
was that at Hertfordſhire, in the year 1697. It began by thunder and
lightening, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome hours, when ſuddenly a black cloud
came forward, againſt the wind, and marked its paſſage with
devaſtation. The hail-ſtones which it poured down, being meaſured, were
found to be many of them fourteen inches round, and, conſequently, as large
as a bowling-green ball. Wherever it came, every plantation fell before it; it
tore up the ground, ſplit great oaks, and other trees, without number; the
fields of rye were cut down, as if levelled with a ſcythe; wheat, oats, and
barley, ſuffered the ſame damage. The inhabitants found but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious
ſhelter, even in their houſes, their tiles and windows being broke by the
violence of the hail-ſtones, which, by the force with which they came,
ſeemed to have deſcended from a great height. The birds, in this
univerſal wreck, vainly tried to eſcape by flight; pidgeons, crows, rooks,
and much more of the ſmaller and feebler kinds, were brought down. An unhappy
young man, who had not time to take ſhelter, was killed; one of his eyes was
ſtruck out of his head, and his body was all over black with the bruiſes:
another had juſt time to eſcape, but not <pb n="376" facs="tcp:0823800101:399"/> without the
moſt imminent danger, his body being bruiſed all over. But what is moſt
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, all this fell within the compaſs of a mile.</p>
            <p>Mezeray, in his Hiſtory of France, tells us of a ſhower of hail
much more terrible, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the year 1510, when the French mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
invaded Italy. There was, for a time, an horrid darkneſs, thicker than that
of midnight, which continued till the terrors of mankind were changed to
ſtill more terrible objects, by thunder and lightening breaking the gloom,
and bringing on ſuch a ſhower of hail, as no hiſtory of human calamities
could equal. Theſe hail-ſtones were of a bluiſh colour; and ſome of
them weighed not leſs than an hundred pounds. A noiſome vapour of ſulphur
attended the ſtorm. All the birds and beaſts of the country were entirely
deſtroyed. Numbers of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race ſuffered the ſame fate. But what is
ſtill more extraordinary, the fiſhes themſelves found no protection from
their native element; but were equal ſufferers in the general cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>Theſe, however, are terrors that are ſeldom exerted in our mild
climates. They only ſerve to mark the page of hiſtory with wonder; and
ſtand as admonitions to mankind, of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtores of puniſhment in
the hands of the <pb n="377" facs="tcp:0823800101:400"/> Deity, which his power can treaſure
up, and his mercy can ſuſpend.</p>
            <p>In the temperate zones, therefore, meteors are rarely found thus
terrible; but between the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics, and near the poles, they aſſume very
dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and various appearances. In thoſe incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment regions, where cold
and heat exert their chief power, meteors ſeem peculiarly to have fixed their
reſidence. They are ſeen there in a thouſand terrifying forms,
aſtoniſhing to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, yet diſregarded by the natives, from their
frequency. The wonders of air, fire, and water, are there combined, to produce
the moſt tremendous effects; and to ſport with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and
apprehenſions of mankind. Lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that flaſh without noiſe;
hurricanes, that tear up the earth; clouds, that all at once pour down their
contents, and produce an inſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge; mock ſuns; northern lights, that
illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate half the hemiſphere; circular rainbows; halo's; fleeting balls of
fire; clouds, reflecting back the images of things on earth, like mirrors; and
water-ſpouts, that burſt from the ſea, to join with the miſts that hang
immediately above them. Theſe are but a part of the phaenomena that are
common in thoſe countries; and from many of which, our own climate is, in a
great meaſure, exempted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:0823800101:401"/>The meteors of the torrid zone, however, are
different from thoſe that are found near the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar circles: and it may
readily be ſuppoſed, that in thoſe countries where the ſun exerts the
greateſt force in raiſing vapours of all kinds, there ſhould be the
greateſt quantity of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors. Upon the approach of the winter months, as
they are called, under the line, which uſually begin about May, the ſky,
from a fiery brightneſs, begins to be overcaſt, and the whole horizon
ſeems wrapt in a muddy cloud. Miſts and vapours ſtill continue to riſe;
and the air, which ſo lately before was clear and elaſtic, now becomes
humid, obſcure, and ſtifling: the fogs become ſo thick, that the light of
the ſun ſeems in a manner excluded; nor would its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence be known, but
for the intenſe and ſuffocat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat of its beams, which dart through the
gloom, and, inſtead of diſſipating, only ſerve to encreaſe the
miſt. After this preparation, there follows an almoſt continual
ſucceſſion of thunder, rain, and tempeſts. During this dreadful
ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the ſtreets of cities flow like rivers; and the whole country
wears the appearance of an ocean. The inhabitants often make uſe of this
oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to lay in a ſtock of freſh water, for the reſt of the year;
as the ſame cauſe which pours <pb n="379" facs="tcp:0823800101:402"/> down the deluge at one
ſeaſon, denies the kindly ſhower at another. The thunder which attends
the fall of theſe rains, is much more terrible than that we are generally
acquainted with. With us, the flaſh is ſeen at ſome diſtance, and the
noiſe ſhortly after enſues; our thunder gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally rolls on one quarter
of the ſky, and one ſtroke purſues another. But here it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
the whole ſky, all around, ſeems illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with unremitted flaſhes of
lightening; every part of the air ſeems productive of its own thunders; and
every cloud produces its own ſhock. The ſtrokes come ſo thick, that the
inhabitants can ſcarce mark the intervals; but all is one unremitted roar of
elementary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. It ſhould ſeem, however, that the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of
thoſe countries is not ſo fatal, or ſo dangerous, as with us; ſince, in
this caſe, the torrid zone would be uninhabitable.</p>
            <p>When theſe terrors have ceaſed, with which, however, the natives
are familiar, meteors of another kind begin to make their appearance. The
intenſe beams of the ſun, darting upon ſtagnant waters, that generally
cover the ſurface of the country, raiſe vapours of various kinds. Floating
bodies of fire, which aſſume different names, rather from their accidental
forms, than from any real difference between them, are ſeen 
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0823800101:403"/> without ſurprize. The draco volans, or flying dragon,
as it is called; the ignis fatuus, or wandering fire; the fires of St. Helmo,
or the mariner's light, are every where fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; and of theſe we have
numberleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions. 
<q rend="inline">"As I was riding in Jamaica," ſays, Mr. Barbham,
"one morning from my habitation, ſituated about three miles north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt from
Jago de la Bega, I ſaw a ball of fire, appearing to me of the bigneſs of a
bomb, ſwiftly falling down with a great blaze. At firſt I thought it fell
into the town; but when I came nearer, I ſaw many people gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
a little to the ſouthward, in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah, to whom I rode up, to enquire
the cauſe of their meeting: they were admiring, as I found, the ground's
being ſtrangely broke up and ploughed by a ball of fire; which, as they
ſaid, fell down there. I obſerved there were many holes in the ground; one
in the middle of the bigneſs of a man's head, and five or ſix ſmaller
round about it, of the bigneſs of one's fiſt, and ſo deep as not to be
fathomed by ſuch implements as were at hand. It was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, alſo, that
all the green herbage was burnt up, near the holes; and there continued a
ſtrong ſmell of ſulphur near the place, for ſome time after."</q>

<q rend="inline">"About nine at night," ſays he, "a globe of fire
appeared to riſe from the ſide of the mountain Pichinca, and ſo large,
that it ſpread a light over all the part of the city facing that mountain.
The houſe where I lodged, looking that way, I was ſurprized with an
extraordinary light, darting through the crevices of the window-ſhutters. On
this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and the buſtle of the people, in the ſtreet, I haſtened
to the window, and came time enough to ſee it, in the middle of its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer;
which continued from weſt to ſouth, till I loſt ſight of it, being
intercepted by a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that lay between me and it. It was round; and its
apparent diameter about a foot. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it to riſe from the ſides of
Pichinca; although, to judge from its courſe, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind that mountain
where this congeries of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable matter was kindled. In the firſt half of
its viſible courſe it emitted a prodigious effulgence, then it began
gradually to grow dim; ſo that, upon its diſappearing behind the
intervening mountain, its light was very faint."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Meteors, of this kind, are very frequently ſeen between the
tropics; but they ſometimes, alſo, viſit the more temperate regions of
Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. We have the deſcription of a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary 
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0823800101:405"/> one, given us by Montanari, that ſerves to ſhew to
what great heights, in our atmoſphere, theſe vapours are found to aſcend.
In the year 1676, a great globe of fire was ſeen at Bononia, in Italy, about
three quarters of an hour after ſun-ſet. It paſt weſtward, with a
moſt rapid courſe, and at the rate of not leſs than a hundred and ſixty
miles in a minute, which is much ſwifter than the force of a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-ball,
and, at laſt, ſtood over the Adriatic ſea. In its courſe it croſſed
over all Italy; and, by computation, it could not have been leſs than
thirty-eight miles above the ſurface of the earth. In the whole line of its
courſe, wherever it approached, the inhabitants below could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
hear it, with a hiſſing noiſe, reſembling that of a fire-work. Having
paſt away to ſea, towards Corſica, it was heard, at laſt, to go off
with a moſt violent exploſion, much louder than that of a cannon; and,
immediately after, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noiſe was heard, like the rattling of a great
cart, upon a ſtony pavement; which was, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, nothing more than the echo
of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſound. Its magnitude, when at Bononia, appeared twice as long
as the moon, one way; and as broad the other; ſo that, conſidering its
height, it could not have been leſs than a mile long, and half a mile broad.
From the height <pb n="383" facs="tcp:0823800101:406"/> at which this was ſeen, and there
being no vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano, on that quarter of the world, from whence it came, it is
more than probable that this terrible globe was kindled on ſome part of the
contrary ſide of the globe, in thoſe regions of vapours, which we have been
juſt deſcribing; and thus, riſing above the air, and paſſing, in a
courſe oppoſite to that of the earth's motion, in this manner it acquired
its amazing rapidity.</p>
            <p>To theſe meteors, common enough ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we will add one more
of a very uncommon kind, which was ſeen, by Ulloa, at Quito, in Peru; the
beauty of which will, in ſome meaſure, ſerve to relieve us, after the
deſcription of thoſe hideous ones preceding. 
<q rend="inline">"At day-break," ſays he, "the whole mountain of
Pambamarca, where we then reſided, was encompaſſed with very thick
clouds; which the riſing of the ſun diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed ſo far, as to leave
only ſome vapours, too fine to be ſeen. On the ſide oppoſite to the
riſing ſun, and about ten fathoms diſtant from the place where we were
ſtanding, we ſaw, as in a looking-glaſs, each his own image; the head
being, as it were, the center of three cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular rainbows, one without the
other, and juſt near enough to each other as that the colours of the internal
verged upon thoſe more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; while round all was a circle of white, 
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0823800101:407"/> but with a greater ſpace between. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
theſe circles were erected, like a mirror, before us; and as we moved, they
moved, in diſpoſition and order. But, what is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, though we
were ſix in number, every one ſaw the phenomenon, with regard to
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not that relating to others. The dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the arches
gradually altered, as the ſun roſe above the horizon; and the whole, after
continuing a long time, inſenſibly faded away. In the beginning, the
diameter of the inward iris, taken from its laſt colour, was about five
degrees and a half; and that of the white arch, which ſurrounded the reſt,
was not leſs than ſixty-ſeven degrees. At the beginning of the
phenomenon, the arches ſeemed of an oval or eliptical figure, like the diſk
of the ſun; and afterwards became perfectly circular. Each of theſe was of
a red colour, bordered with an orange; and the laſt bordered by a bright
yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which altered into a ſtraw colour, and this turned to a green; but,
in all, the external colour remained red."</q> Such is the deſcription of one
of the moſt beautiful illuſions that has been ever ſeen in nature. This
alone ſeems to have combined all the ſplendours of optics in one view. To
underſtand the manner, therefore, how this phaenomena was produced, 
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0823800101:408"/> would require a perfect knowledge of optics; which it is
not our preſent province to enter upon. It will be ſufficient here,
therefore, only to obſerve, that all theſe appearances ariſe from the
denſity of the cloud, together with its uncommon and peculiar ſituation,
with reſpect to the ſpectator and the ſun. It may be obſerved, that but
one of theſe three rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows was real, the reſt being only reflections
thereof. It may alſo be obſerved, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ſpectator ſtands
between the ſun and a cloud of falling rain, a rainbow is ſeen, which is
nothing more than the reflection of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent coloured rays of light from
the boſom of the cloud. If, for inſtance, we take a glaſs globe, filled
with water, and hang it up before us, oppoſite the ſun, in many
ſituations, it will appear tranſparent; but if it is raiſed higher, or
ſideways, to an angle of forty-five degrees, it will at firſt appear red;
altered a very little higher, yellow; then green, then blue, then violet
colour; in ſhort, it will aſſume ſucceſſively all the colours of
the rainbow; but, if raiſed higher, ſtill it will become tranſparent
again. A falling ſhower may be conſidered as an infinite number of theſe
little tranſparent globes, aſſuming dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent colours, by being placed
at the proper heights. The reſt of the ſhower will appear 
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0823800101:409"/> tranſparent, and no part of it will ſeem coloured;
but ſuch as are at angles of forty-five degrees from the eye, forty-five
degrees upward, forty-five degrees on each ſide, and forty-five degrees
downward, did not the plain of the earth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent us. We, therefore, ſee only
an arch of the rainbow, the lower part being cut off from our ſight by the
earth's interpoſition. However, upon the tops of very high mountains,
circular rainbows are ſeen, becauſe we can ſee to an angle of forty-five
degrees downward, as well as upward, or ſideways, and therefore we take in
the rainbow's complete circle.</p>
            <p>In thoſe forlorn regions, round the poles, the meteors, though of
another kind, are not leſs numerous and alarming. When the winter begins, and
the cold prepares to ſet in, the ſame miſty appearance which is produced
in the ſouthern climates by the heat, is there produced by the contrary
extreme<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Paul Egede's Hiſtory of
Greenland.</bibl>
               </note>. The ſea ſmokes like an oven, and a fog ariſes,
which mariners call the froſt ſmoke. This cutting miſt moſt commonly
raiſes bliſters on ſeveral parts of the body; and, as ſoon as it is
wafted to ſome colder part of the atmoſphere, it freezes to little icy
particles, which are driven by the wind, and create ſuch a cutting cold on
land, that <pb n="387" facs="tcp:0823800101:410"/> the limbs of the inhabitants are ſometimes
frozen, and drop off.</p>
            <p>There alſo, halos, or luminous circles round the moon, are oftener
ſeen than in any other part of the earth, being formed by the froſt
ſmoke; although the air otherwiſe ſeems to be clear. A lunar rainbow
alſo, is often ſeen there, though ſomewhat different from that which is
common with us; as it appears of a pale white, ſtriped with grey. In theſe
countries alſo, the aurora borealis ſtreams, with peculiar luſtre, and
variety of colours. In Greenland it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ariſes in the eaſt, and
darts its ſportive fires, with variegated beauty, over the whole horizon. Its
appearance is almoſt conſtant in winter; and, at thoſe ſeaſons when
the ſun departs, to return no more for half a year, this meteor kindly
riſes to ſupply its beams, and affords ſufficient light for all the
purpoſes of exiſtence. However, in the very midſt of their tedious night,
the inhabitants are not entirely forſaken. The tops of the mountains are
often ſeen painted with the red rays of the ſun; and the poor Greenlander
from thence begins to date his chronology. It would appear whimſical to read
a Greenland calendar, in which we might be told, that one of their chiefs,
having lived forty days, died, at laſt, of a good old age; and 
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0823800101:411"/> that his widow continued for half a day, to deplore his
loſs, with great fidelity, before ſhe admitted a ſecond huſband.</p>
            <p>The meteors of the day, in theſe countries, are not leſs
extraordinary than thoſe of the night: mock ſuns are often reflected upon
an oppoſite cloud; and the ignorant ſpectator fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that there are often
three or four real ſuns in the firmament at the ſame time. In this
ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did appearance the real ſun is always readily known by its ſuperior
brightneſs, every reflexion being ſeen with diminiſhed ſplendour. The
ſolar rainbow there is often ſeen different from ours. Inſtead of a
pleaſing variety of colours, it appears of a pale white, edged with a
ſtripe of duſky yellow; the whole being reflected from the boſom of a
frozen cloud.</p>
            <p>But, of all the meteors which mock the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with an
appearance of reality, thoſe ſtrange illuſions that are ſeen there, in
fine ſerene wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are the moſt extraordinary and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 
<q rend="inline">"Nothing," ſays Krantz, "ever ſurprized me more,
than, on a fine warm ſummer's day, to perceive the iſlands that lie four
leagues weſt of our ſhore, putting on a form quite different from what they
are known to have. As I ſtood gazing upon them, they appeared, at firſt,
infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater than what they naturally are; and ſeemed as if I viewed
them through a large <pb n="389" facs="tcp:0823800101:412"/> magnifying glaſs. They were not
thus only made larger, but brought nearer to me. I plainly deſcried every
ſtone upon the land, and all the furrows filled with ice, as if I ſtood
cloſe by. When this illuſion had laſted for a while, the proſpect
ſeemed to break up, and a new ſcene of wonder to preſent itſelf. The
iſlands ſeemed to travel to the ſhore, and repreſented a wood, or a
tall cut hedge. The ſcene then ſhifted, and ſhewed the appearance of all
ſorts of curious figures; as ſhips with ſails, ſtreamers, and flags;
antique elevated caſtles, with decayed turrets; and a thouſand forms, for
which fancy found a reſemblance in nature. When the eye had been ſatisfied
with gazing, the whole groupe of riches ſeemed to riſe in air, and at
length vaniſh into nothing. At ſuch times the weather is quite ſerene and
clear; but compreſt with ſuch ſubtle vapours, as it is in very hot
weather; and theſe appearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the eye and the object, give it all
that variety of appearances which glaſſes of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent refrangibilities
would have done."</q> Mr. Krantz obſerves that, commonly a couple of hours
afterwards, a gentle weſt wind and a viſible miſt follows, which puts an
end to this <hi>luſus naturae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were eaſy to ſwell this catalogue of meteors 
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0823800101:413"/> with the names of many others, both in our own climate
and in other parts of the world. Such as falling ſtars, which are thought to
be no more than unctuous vapours, raiſed from the earth to ſmall heights,
and continuing to ſhine till that matter which firſt raiſed, and
ſupported them, being burnt out, they fall back again to the earth, with
extinguiſhed flame. Burning ſpears, which are a peculiar kind of aurora
borealis; bloody rains which are ſaid to be the excrements of an inſect,
that at that time has been raiſed into the air. Showers of ſtones,
fiſhes, and ivy-berries, at firſt, no doubt, raiſed into the air by
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, in one country, and falling at ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance,
in the manner of rain, to aſtoniſh another. But omitting theſe, of which
we know little more than what is thus briefly mentioned, I will conclude this
chapter with the deſcription of a water-ſpout; a moſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
phenomenon; not leſs dreadful to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners than aſtoniſhing to the
obſerver of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſpouts are ſeen very commonly in the tropical ſeas,
and ſometimes in our own. Thoſe ſeen by Tournefort, in the
Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean, he has deſcribed as follows. 
<q rend="inline">"The firſt of theſe," ſays this great
botaniſt, "that we ſaw, was about a muſket-ſhot from our ſhip. 
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0823800101:414"/> There we perceived the water began to boil, and to
riſe about a foot above its level. The water was agitated and whitiſh; and
above its ſurface there ſeemed to ſtand a ſmoke, ſuch as might be
imagined to come from wet ſtraw before it begins to blaze. It made a ſort
of a murmuring ſound, like that of a torrent, heard at a diſtance, mixed,
at the ſame time, with an hiſſing noiſe, like that of a ſerpent:
ſhortly after we perceived a column of this ſmoke riſe up to the clouds,
at the ſame time whirling about with great rapidity. It appeared to be as
thick as one's finger; and the former ſound ſtill continued. When this
diſappeared, after laſting for about eight minutes, upon turning to the
oppoſite quarter of the ſky, we perceived another, which began in the
manner of the former; preſently after a third appeared in the weſt; and
inſtantly beſide it ſtill another aroſe. The moſt diſtant of
theſe three could not be above a muſket-ſhot from the ſhip. They all
continued like ſo many heaps of wet ſtraw ſet on fire, that continued to
ſmoke, and to make the ſame noiſe as before. We ſoon after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
each, with its reſpective canal, mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in the clouds, and ſpreading
where it touched; the cloud, like the mouth of a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, making a figure, to
expreſs it intelligibly, <pb n="392" facs="tcp:0823800101:415"/> as if the tail of an animal
were pulled at one end by a weight. Theſe canals were of a whitiſh colour,
and ſo tinged, as I ſuppoſe, by the water which was contained in them;
for, previous to this, they were apparently empty, and of the colour of
tranſparent glaſs. Theſe canals were not ſtraight, but bent in ſome
parts, and far from being perpendicular, but riſing in their clouds with a
very inclined aſcent. But what is very particular, the cloud to which one of
them was pointed happening to be driven by the wind, the ſpout ſtill
continued to follow its motion, without being broken; and paſſing behind
one of the others, the ſpouts croſſed each other, in the form of a St.
Andrew's croſs. In the beginning they were all about as thick as one's
finger, except at the top, where they were broader, and two of them
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared; but ſhortly after, the laſt of the three encreaſed
conſiderably; and its canal, which was at firſt ſo ſmall, ſoon became
as thick as a man's arm, then as his leg, and at laſt thicker than his whole
body. We ſaw diſtinctly, through this tranſparent body, the water, which
roſe up with a kind of ſpiral motion; and it ſometimes diminiſhed a
little of its thickneſs, and again reſumed the ſame; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
widening at top, and ſometimes at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; <pb n="393" facs="tcp:0823800101:416"/> exactly
reſembling a gut filled with water, preſſed with the fingers, to make the
fluid riſe, or fall; and I am well convinced, that this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the
ſpout was cauſed by the wind, which preſſed the cloud, and impelled it
to give up its contents. After ſome time its bulk was ſo diminiſhed as to
be no thicker than a man's arm again; and thus, ſwelling and diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it at laſt became very ſmall. In the end, I obſerved the ſea which was
raiſed about it to reſume its level by degrees, and the end of the canal
that touched it to become as ſmall as if it had been tied round with a cord;
and this continued till the light, ſtriking through the cloud, took away the
view. I ſtill, however, continued to look, expecting that its parts would
join again, as I had before ſeen in one of the others, in which the ſpout
was more than once broken, and yet again came together; but I was
diſappointed, for the ſpout appeared no more."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Many have been the ſolutions offered for this ſurprizing
appearance. Mr. Buffon ſuppoſes the ſpout, here deſcribed, to proceed
from the operation of fire, beneath the bed of the ſea; as the waters at the
ſurface are thus ſeen agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated. However, the ſolution of Dr. Stuart is
not diveſted of probability; who thinks it may <pb n="394" facs="tcp:0823800101:417"/> be
accounted for by ſuction, as in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a cupping-glaſs to the
ſkin.</p>
            <p>Wherever ſpouts of this kind are ſeen they are extremely dreaded
by mariners; for if they happen to fall upon a ſhip they moſt commonly
daſh it to the bottom. But, if the ſhip be large enough to ſuſtain the
deluge, they are at leaſt ſure to deſtroy its ſails and rigging, and
render it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for ſailing. It is ſaid that veſſels of any force
uſually fire their guns at them, loaden with a bar of iron; and, if ſo
happy as to ſtrike them, the water is inſtantly ſeen to fall from them,
with a dreadful noiſe, though without any further miſchief.</p>
            <p>I am at a loſs whether we ought to reckon theſe ſpouts called
typhons; which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen at land, of the ſame kind with thoſe
ſo often deſcribed by mariners, at ſea. as they ſeem to differ in
ſeveral reſpects. That, for inſtance, obſerved at Hatfield, in
Yorkſhire, in 1687, as it is deſcribed by the perſon who ſaw it,
ſeems rather to have been a whirlwind than a water-ſpout. The ſeaſon in
which it appeared was very dry, the weather extremely hot, and the air very
cloudy. After the wind had blown for ſome time, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable force,
and condenſed the black clouds one upon another, a great whirling of the air 
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0823800101:418"/> enſued; upon which the center of the clouds, every now
and then, darted down, in the ſhape of a thick long black pipe; in which the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator could diſtinctly view a motion, like that of a ſcrew, continually
ſcrewing up to itſelf, as it were, whatever it happened to touch. In its
progreſs it moved ſlowly over a grove of young trees, which it violently
bent, in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular motion. Going forward to a barn, it in a minute ſtript
it of all the thatch, and filled the whole air with the ſame. As it came near
the relator, he perceived that its blackneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a gyration of
the clouds, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winds, meeting in a point, or a center; and where the
greateſt force was exerted, there darting down, like an Archimedes's ſcrew,
to ſuck up all that came in its way. Another which he ſaw, ſome time
after, was attended with ſtill more terrible effects; levelling, or tearing
up great oak trees, catching up the birds in its vortex, and daſhing them
againſt the ground. In this manner it proceeded, with an audible whirling
noiſe, like that of a mill; and, at length, diſſolved, after having done
much miſchief.</p>
            <p>But we muſt ſtill continue to ſuſpend our aſſent as to
the nature even of theſe land ſpouts; <pb n="396" facs="tcp:0823800101:419"/> ſince they
have been ſometimes found to drop, in a great column of water, at once upon
the earth, and produce an inſtant inundation<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Phil. Tranſ. vol. iv, p. 2, 108.</bibl>
               </note>, which
could not readily have happened had they been cauſed by the gyration of a
whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind only. Indeed, every conjecture, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe meteors, ſeems
to me entirely unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory. They ſometimes appear in the calmeſt
weather at ſea, of which I have been an eye-witneſs; and, therefore,
theſe are not cauſed by a whirlwind. They are always capped by a cloud;
and, therefore, are not likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from fires at the bottom. They
change place; and, therefore, ſuction ſeems imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable. In ſhort, we
ſtill want facts, upon which to build a rational theory; and, inſtead of
knowledge, we muſt be contented with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. To be well acquainted with
the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Nature, even though we are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of their cauſes,
often conſtitutes the moſt uſeful wiſdom.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXII. The Concluſion.</head>
            <p>HAVING thus gone through a particular deſcription of the earth,
let us now pauſe for a moment, to contemplate the great picture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.
The univerſe may be conſidered as the palace in which the Deity reſides;
and this earth as one of its apartments. In this, all the meaner races of
animated nature mechanically obey him; and ſtand ready to execute his
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, without heſitation. Man alone is found refractory; he is the only
being endued with a power of contradicting theſe mandates. The Deity was
pleaſed to exert ſuperior power in creating him a ſuperior being; a being
endued with a choice of good and evil; and capable, in ſome meaſure, of
co-operating with his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. Man, therefore, may be conſidered as a
limited creature, endued with powers imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of thoſe reſiding in the
Deity. He is thrown into a world that ſtands in need of his help; and has
been granted a power of producing harmony from partial confuſion.</p>
            <p>If, therefore, we conſider the earth as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for our
habitation, we ſhall find, that much has been given us to enjoy, and much 
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0823800101:421"/> to amend; that we have ample reaſons for our
gratitude, and ſtill more for our induſtry. In thoſe great outlines of
nature, to which art can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach, and where our greateſt efforts muſt
have been ineffectual, God himſelf has finiſhed theſe with amazing
grandeur and beauty. Our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent Father has conſidered theſe parts of
nature as peculiarly his own; as parts which no creature could have ſkill or
ſtrength to amend: and therefore, made them incapable of alteration, or of
more perfect regularity. The heavens, and the firmament, ſhew the wiſdom,
and the glory of the Workman. Aſtronomers, who are beſt ſkilled in the
ſymmetry of ſyſtems, can find nothing there that they can alter for the
better. God made theſe perfect, becauſe no ſubordinate being could
correct their defects.</p>
            <p>When, therefore, we ſurvey nature on this ſide, nothing can be
more ſplendid, more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, or amazing. We there behold a Deity reſiding
in the midſt of an univerſe, infinitely extended every way, animating all,
and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vacuity with his preſence! We behold an immenſe and
ſhapeleſs maſs of matter, formed into worlds by his power, and
diſperſed at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, to which even the imagination cannot travel! In
this great theatre of his glory, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuns, like our own, animate
their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <pb n="399" facs="tcp:0823800101:422"/> ſyſtems, appearing and
vaniſhing at divine command. We behold our own bright lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, fixed in the
center of its ſyſtem, wheeling its planets in times proportioned to their
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and at once diſpenſing light, heat, and action. The earth
alſo is ſeen with its twofold motion; producing, by the one, the change of
ſeaſons; and, by the other, the grateful viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of day and
night. With what ſilent mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence is all this performed! with what
ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſe! The works of art are exerted with inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted force; and
their noiſy progreſs diſcovers the obſtructions they receive: but the
earth, with a ſilent ſteady rotation, ſucceſſively preſents every
part of its boſom to the ſun; at once im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibing nouriſhment and light
from that parent of vegetation and fertility.</p>
            <p>But not only proviſions of heat and light are thus ſupplied, but
its whole ſurface is covered with a tranſparent atmoſphere, that turns
with its motion, and guards it from external injury. The rays of the ſun are
thus broken into a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial warmth; and, while the ſurface is aſſiſted,
a gentle heat is produced in the bowels of the earth, which contributes to
cover it with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. Waters alſo are ſupplied in healthful abundance, to
ſupport life, and aſſiſt vegetation. Mountains ariſe, to diverſify
the proſpect, and <pb n="400" facs="tcp:0823800101:423"/> give a current to the ſtream. Seas
extend from one continent to the other, repleniſhed with ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, that may
be turned to human ſupport; and alſo ſerving to enrich the earth with a
ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of vapour. Breezes fly along the ſurface of the fields, to
promote health and vegetation. The coolneſs of the evening invites to reſt;
and the freſhneſs of the morning renews for labour.</p>
            <p>Such are the delights of the habitation that has been aſſigned
to man; without any one of theſe, he muſt have been wretched; and none of
theſe could his own induſtry have ſupplied. But while many of his wants
are thus kindly furniſhed, on the one hand, there are numberleſs
inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to excite his induſtry on the other. This habitation, though
provided with all the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of air, paſturage, and water, is but a
deſert place, without human cultivation. The loweſt animal finds more
conveniencies in the wilds of nature, than he who boaſts himſelf their
lord. The whirlwind, the inundation, and all the aſperities of the air, are
peculiarly terrible to man, who knows their conſequences, and, at a
diſtance, dreads their approach. The earth it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, where human art has not
pervaded, puts on a frightful gloomy appearance. The foreſts are dark and
tangled; the meadows over-grown with rank weeds; and the brooks ſtray without
a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined <pb n="401" facs="tcp:0823800101:424"/> channel. Nature, that has been kind to
every lower order of beings, has been quite neglectful with regard to him; to
the ſavage uncontriving man the earth is an abode of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, where his
ſhelter is inſufficient, and his food precarious.</p>
            <p>A world thus furniſhed with advantages on one ſide, and
inconveniences on the other, is the proper abode of reaſon, is the fitteſt
to exerciſe the induſtry of a free and a thinking creature. Theſe evils,
which art can remedy, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience guard againſt, are a proper call for
the exertion of his faculties; and they tend ſtill more to aſſimilate him
to his Creator. God beholds, with pleaſure, that being which he has made,
converting the wretchedneſs of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſituation into a theatre of
triumph; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the headlong tribes of nature into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his
will; and producing that order and uniformity upon earth, of which his own
heavenly fabric is ſo bright an example.</p>
