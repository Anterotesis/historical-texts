            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0095100803:4"/>But in order to avoid Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, on Account of

            <p>To expatiate, Sir, on the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Points in which you excel,
would be a Task more fittly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to the Accuracy of a <hi>Plutarch,</hi> or
the Perſpicuity of a <hi>Rapin,</hi> than a Pen ſo unſkill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as mine, in

            <p>Since to diſplay your Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity in the Field, Wiſdom 
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0095100803:5"/> in the Council, ſingular Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and univerſal

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>LEST the World ſhould imagine I publiſh'd this Volume, in
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to diſpleaſe my Father, or any other Perſon, the 
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0095100803:8"/> Reflection of which, would give me the utmoſt
Uneaſineſs, I thought it quite neceſſary, in this Place, to declare the
Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it lay ſo long in Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and why it is at this Time made
publick.</p>
            <p>My Mother, before her Death, had taken in a Number of
Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and after her Departure from Life, as I
was left quite deſtitute of Money or Friends, I was obliged to purſue the
Deſign of Printing the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume; to which I was encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſeveral
Perſons of real Worth and Diſtinction: but tho' I became indebted to the
Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, it was never in my power, <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0095100803:9"/> to raiſe a
ſufficient Sum to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the Expence of Printing; but on the contrary, thro'
the Reſentment of thoſe, whom my Mother had formerly deſcrib'd, I was not
only baſely traduc'd in my Reputation, but plung'd into a World of
Calamities, which I may, perhaps, at ſome Time hereafter relate, together
with the various Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of my Life. However, amongſt many
Accuſations, that fell heavy on me, one was, that I had defrauded the
Publick, by taking Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions to a Work, which I not only had not a
Deſign of Printing, but one that never exiſted, except in my Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
as they were kind <pb n="x" facs="tcp:0095100803:10"/> enough to declare, that my Mother never
wrote ſuch a Book.</p>
            <p>Yet ſhould I have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to have ſtood all this
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and much more, nay, as the Subſcribers were Perſons of Fortune
and Humanity, whoſe Contributions proceeded more from a Deſire of ſerving
me, than a Curioſity to ſee the Book, I would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd their Debtor
for ever, ſooner than have brought ſuch an Affair over; but, that having a
Wife and Family to ſupport, and finding it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to obtain from my
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſmalleſt Succour, <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0095100803:11"/> though I applied to him
in the moſt ſubmiſſive and pathetick Manner: On the contrary, when I
found him endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hurt me in the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of 
<note n="*" place="bottom">Particularly the Lord Biſhop of
<hi>Derry,</hi> to whom I am much obliged.</note>thoſe, with whom I had
ſome Intereſt; I thought it but prudent, to acquit my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Charge
of Diſhoneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by delivering the Books to my Benefactors, and at the
ſame Time, to endeavour to make as much as poſſible by it. To this end I
came to <hi>London</hi> laſt <hi>October,</hi> but had not brought the
Manuſcript with me, which was in the <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0095100803:12"/> Hands of Mr.
<hi>Powel,</hi> Printer in <hi>Dublin.</hi> I thought it prudent, not being
over-ſtocked with Caſh, to try how a Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would take in
<hi>London.</hi> before I ventured to pay a Sum, which was due to
<hi>Powel.</hi> I therefore printed Propoſals, and communicated my Plan to
Mr. <hi>Foote,</hi> who had, when in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> profeſs'd a great
Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for me, (not without ſome Cauſe) as will be ſeen
hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He highly approv'd my Project, and aſſured me I might make a
conſiderable Sum by it; and that for his own Part, he would get me at leaſt
a hundred Subſcribers, all which, not knowing the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's 
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0095100803:13"/> real Diſpoſition, I ſincerely believed. His Farce
of the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> was at this Time acting; and I
ventured to write the following Lines upon it, which I ſent to him in a
Letter, and beg'd his Permiſſion, to inſert them in the Daily

            <head>MEMOIRS OF Mrs. Letitia Pilkington.</head>
            <p>A Third Volume of Memoirs is really a bold Undertaking, as they
are generally light, frothy, and vain; yet I have met with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop'd
Succeſs, that I am quite encouraged to proceed; more eſpecially as my Word
is paſs'd to the Publick; and my Word I have ever held ſacred. I cannot,
like a certain Female Writer, ſay, I hope if I have done nothing to pleaſe,
I have done nothing to offend; for truly I mean to give both Pleaſure and
Offence: Lemon and Sugar is very pretty. I ſhould be ſorry to write a
Satire which did not <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0095100803:25"/> ſting, nor will I ever write a
Panegyrick on an Undeſerver: If a Rogue ſhould happen to be mine honeſt
Friend, I owe him Silence; but that is the moſt he can expect.</p>
            <p>Many indeed are glad to become Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers of it. Perſons whom
I know nothing of, come and beg I may not put them into the Third Volume; and
they will ſubſcribe: Surely then they ſhould knock at their own Hearts;
and if it confeſs a natural Guiltineſs, 
<q> 
                  <l>Let it not breathe a Thought upon their Tongue</l> 
                  <l>To my Diſhonour—</l> 
                  <bibl>Shakeſpear.</bibl>
               </q> I threaten not any, nor did I ever
do it; but Characters are my Game, who 
<q> 
                  <l>Eye Nature's Walks, ſhoot Folly as it flies,</l> 
                  <l>And catch the Manners living as they riſe.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould now be glad to know how I could proſecute my own
Hiſtory without intermingling that of others; I have not lived in Deſarts,
where no Men abide, nor in a Cave, like <hi>Eccho</hi>; therefore it 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0095100803:26"/> is no more in my power to grant ſuch unreaſonable
Requeſts, when a Book is requir'd of me, than it is in that of an
hiſtorical Painter to give a good Piece, when he is poſitively commanded
never to draw the Likeneſs of any thing in Heaven or on Earth.</p>
            <p>But, Oh my dear LADIES, why are you ſo frightened? Why ſo many
Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a Perſon unacquainted with you? Have you all then a ſore
Place, which you are afraid I ſhould touch? But now<note n="*" place="bottom">Taken from the Play of <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thisbe,</hi> in
<hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s <hi>Midſummer Nights Dream.</hi>
               </note>, I ſay this
to you, or to the ſame Defect: Ladies, or moſt fair Ladies, I would
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt you not to fear, not to tremble; my Life for yours, if you think I
come as a Lion, 'twere Pity of my Life: No, no, I am no ſuch thing; I am a
Woman, as other Women are—</p>
            <p>But, after all, it does not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe me, that every
Perſon who ſuffers a Panick, leſt their own Reputations ſhould be
attack'd, has not a little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for that of another: No, no! let 
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0095100803:27"/> them find a Flaw in a Brilliant, and by the Help of their
magnifying Talents, they ſhall dim it all over: If they look upon this as a
Virtue, 'tis one I ſhall never be emulous of.</p>
            <p>I remember Doctor <hi>Swift</hi> told me, he once dined at a
Perſon's Houſe, where the Part of the Table-Cloth, which was next to him,
happened to have a ſmall Hole in it, which, ſays he, I tore as wide as I
could; then aſked for ſome Soop, and fed myſelf through the Hole. The
Dean, who was a great Friend to Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery, did this to mortify the Lady of
the Houſe; but, upon my Word, by the general Love of Scandal and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
in <hi>Dublin,</hi> one might reaſonably imagine they were all to feed
themſelves through the Holes, which they had made in the Characters of
others: 
<q>But 'tis of no Conſequence to me; as Treaſon and Malice now
have done their worſt. 
<bibl>Shakeſpear.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Reputation once gone is never to be retriev'd: The Wiſe ſay,
it is as often <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0095100803:28"/> gain'd without Merit, as loſt without a
Crime; ſo I muſt comfort myſelf the beſt I can. The Fable of
<hi>Reputation, Fire,</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> is too well known to want a
Recital; and, to quote a Paragraph from a late Letter of Mr. CIBBER'S to me, in
Anſwer to one of mine, wherein I had acquainted him, that a Gentleman who had
formerly been prejudiced againſt him, was now his very ſincere Admirer; as
his Lines may in ſome Meaſure be applicable to me, I ſhall inſert them
as follows: 
<q>It is now growing too late in Life, to be much concerned about
whatever Good or Evil the World may think it worth their while to ſay of me.
All I have to do, is to fix a Conſciouſneſs of my own Integrity, and then
let the Devil do his worſt. Truth has a ſtrong Arm, and in that the
weakeſt Perſon living, with an honeſt Heart, may truſt for their
Protection.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So let this ſerve by way of <hi>Preface,</hi> while I proceed in
my <hi>Narrative,</hi> or, 
<q>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0095100803:29"/> 
                  <l>Take the ſprightly Reed, and ſing and play,</l> 
                  <l>Careleſs of what the cenſuring World may
ſay.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And here, before I proceed, to give Eaſe to every Heart, which
may poſſibly ſuffer any Anxiety, on Account of what might be ſaid of
them, I proclaim Peace to all, but thoſe who have directly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted me.
'Tis but a mean Piece of Cowardice to inſult a Woman, and as ſome Gentlemen
have had the Courage to challenge me, by the known Laws of Chivalry, I have a
right to chuſe the Weapons; a <hi>Pen</hi> is mine, let them take up another,
and may-hap they will meet their Match.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Hibernian</hi> Writers are evermore threatened, not with
the Wit of their Antagoniſts, but the Arm of the Fleſh; and truly that is
ſuch a knock-down Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as I, at leaſt, am utterly unable to
reſiſt.</p>
            <p>Upon my Word, were any Folly of mine to produce real Wit in
another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0095100803:30"/> I ſhould not be diſpleaſed to be
roundly rallied.</p>
            <p>I was very well diverted with Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi>'s<note n="*" place="bottom">When this Gentleman exhibited at <hi>Dublin,</hi> in Oppoſition
to Mr. <hi>Foote</hi>'s Tea.</note> Coffee, and humorous Deſcription of me,
crying, 
<q> 
                  <l>Subſcribe, or elſe I'll paint you like the Devil.</l>
               </q>
Though how I, who never either was a dramatick Writer, or a Player, came to
have ſuch extraordinary Marks of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction paid me from the Theatre, is
more than I can readily account for.</p>
            <p>However I enjoy'd the Jeſt, and the worſt Mark of Reſentment
I ſhew'd, was to ſend him a Crown for a Box Ticket, which he graciouſly
accepted; and in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, got his Friend in the College to add ſix Couplets
of Scurrility to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Encomium on me.</p>
            <p>No marvel, for I remember the Dean told me, he paid a Man's Debt
on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his having wrote ſomething tollerably good; and the next Proof
he gave of his Talents, as ſoon as he was <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0095100803:31"/> releas'd from
Jail, was to write a Satire on his Benefactor and Deliverer. I told this
Paſſage to Mr. <hi>Cibber,</hi> who aſſured me he had been juſt
ſerv'd in the ſame Manner.</p>
            <p>Gratitude is, of all Virtues, the moſt ſeldom practis'd; the
Cauſe of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, I take to be our innate Pride; few Perſons can bear
to be under the Weight of an Obligation, not conſidering that, 
<q> 
                  <l>The grateful Heart by paying owes not,</l> 
                  <l>But ſtands at once indebted and diſcharged.</l> 
                  <bibl>MILTON.</bibl>
               </q> Doctor <hi>Swift</hi> very well
obſerves, that many Perſons have done a <hi>juſt,</hi> many a
<hi>generous,</hi> but few a <hi>grateful</hi> Act.</p>
            <p>I have indeed experienced Gratitude, even to painful Extaſy;
eſpecially, when you my dear, and honoured Lord <hi>Kingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
vouchſafe to cheer my Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the Muſes, Loves, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in
your Train; with all the Virtues that adorn the <hi>Good,</hi> and every
ſhining Excellence which diſtinguiſhes the <hi>fine</hi> 
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0095100803:32"/> Gentleman: So <hi>Cyrus</hi> deigned to viſit
<hi>Zoroaſter,</hi> and bleſs his ſolemn Grotto.</p>
            <p>You have, my Lord, another Talent, which as Leiſure and Fortune
give you a Power of exerting it, I hope you will; and which, by the Honour you
have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me, of being your Correſpondent, I have diſcovered, and, like
a true Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, cannot bear the Pain of keeping a Secret. Amongſt all the
Letters I have yet ſeen publiſhed, I never ſaw any ſo truly elegant,
learned, and polite, as thoſe with which your Lordſhip has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended
to honour your poor Servant: Invoke then, my Lord, the ſacred Nine; not one
of the beauteous Virgins can be coy to ſuch a Lover, reſembling ſo much
their own <hi>Apollo.</hi> I am very certain they have all beſtow'd their
Favours, though you are too much the Man of Honour to reveal it.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Britannia</hi> boaſt her <hi>Shafteſburys, Dorſets,
Mulgraves</hi>; and let us tell her in Return, we have our
<hi>Kingsborough.</hi> And here I muſt vindicate the Learning, as well as the
Politeneſs of the Nobility; <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0095100803:33"/> though it be in Oppoſition

            <p>ONE Day as I was ſitting in my Shop,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide the 2d Vol. of theſe Memoirs.</note> a Woman who though
very badly dreſt, had a Dignity in her Air which diſtinguiſh'd her from
the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, ſtood reading the Paper I had ſtuck up, with Regard to writing
Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Petitions. At length ſhe came in, and begg'd of me to write a
Petition for her, to his Majeſty, from whom, as ſhe ſaid, ſhe hop'd for
a Penſion. I <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0095100803:38"/> aſked her what Title ſhe had to it? She
ſaid, if I could have Patience to hear her Story, ſhe was certain I would
think ſhe had a very juſt one. As I was fond of Novelties, I aſſured
her ſhe could not oblige me more; ſo to avoid Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I took her
into the Parlour, when ſhe began her Hiſtory as follows: 
<q> 
                  <p> I am, ſaid ſhe, Grandaughter to the Marquis of
<hi>Vendoſme</hi>; my Mother, whoſe Name was <hi>Margaretta de
Tia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ange,</hi> was one of the moſt celebrated Beauties in the Court of
<hi>France.</hi> The late Electreſs of <hi>Hanover</hi> (poor Lady, though
her Huſband was crown'd King of <hi>England,</hi> ſhe never was
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd as Queen) had ſo fond an Affection for her, that ſhe could
not think of parting with her; but when ſhe was married, entreated ſhe
would accompany her to <hi>Hanover</hi>; their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prayers prevailed on my
Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to give his Aſſent, and the Electreſs plac'd her in Quality
of the firſt Lady of her Bedchamber, that <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0095100803:39"/> ſhe might
ever have her near her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,—</p> 
                  <p> Whatever Regret my Mother felt, at the ſtrange Difference
ſhe found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Court of <hi>Paris</hi> and the Houſe of
<hi>Herenhauſen,</hi> yet being happy in the Favour of her Royal
Miſtreſs, young and chearful, ſhe made herſelf quite eaſy; and ſhe
and Count <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningſmark</hi> uſed to ſet their Heads to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to
ſtudy what might be moſt amuſing to the lovely Lady.</p> 
                  <p> But alas! while they thought only of Innocence, the Princeſs
<hi>Sophia,</hi> and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Munſter,</hi> a diſcarded
Miſtreſs of the <hi>Elector</hi>'s, had other Schemes in their Heads, which
not long after they put in Practice, to the Deſtruction of the
<hi>Count,</hi> the Diſgrace of the <hi>Electreſs,</hi> and the
Baniſhment of every Perſon, whom ſhe honoured with her Confidence.</p> 
                  <p> I have frequently heard my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declare, that ſhe believ'd
there was not in the World a more virtuous Perſon than the Electreſs, and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0095100803:40"/> her Conduct from the Time of her Separation from
the late King, to the Hour of her Death, ſufficiently convinced the World of
her unſpotted Purity.</p> 
                  <p> Well, in the general Ruin my Mother, as her firſt Favourite,
was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably involv'd: She was order'd to return home to <hi>France</hi>;
and as ſhe was a Woman of Quality, a Man of War was fitted out for that
Purpoſe.</p> 
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I could not here avoid interrupting her, to ſay I wonder'd that
the Princeſs <hi>Sophia</hi> ſhould enter into any Scheme which might in
the leaſt reflect on the Honour of her own illuſtrious Family; ſhe
anſwer'd, the Princeſs lov'd nothing ſo well as Dominion, and as the
Ladies of <hi>France</hi> had a natural Turn to Politicks, ſhe was afraid the
Electreſs might inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere, ſo as to injure her Power, which was almoſt
abſolute. Oh! Ambition! by what cruel Means doſt thou compaſs thy Ends? I
deſired her to proceed, which ſhe did as follows. 
<q>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0095100803:41"/> 
                  <p> My Mother return'd home ſafe, though much dejected at a
Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from her Miſtreſs, with whom had ſhe been permitted, ſhe
would willingly have embraced an Exile from the gay World. But as Time
inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly wears off Affliction, and leſſens the Object, by removing
it to a greater Diſtance, ſo ſhe began to reſume her native
Chearfulneſs, and once more ſhone at Court.</p> 
                  <p> The firſt Night ſhe appeared there, an <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Nobleman, for as ſuch he paſs'd himſelf, (neither did his good Mien or
Politeneſs, in the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict this generally received Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) paid
his Addreſſes to her. Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry and Complaiſance are ſo much the Mode
at <hi>Paris,</hi> that my Mother took all he ſaid of <hi>his</hi>
Paſſion, and <hi>her</hi> Charms, meerly as Words of Courſe, and told him
ſo; he anſwered that he found ſhe was unacquainted with the Temper of the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> who, above all other People, particularly valued
themſelves on Sincerity, and ſcorned <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0095100803:42"/> Deceit or
Hypocriſy even to the Fair, to whom moſt Men practiſe it. She anſwer'd,
the Ladies in his Country muſt certainly be very happy; he ſaid, the moſt
convincing Proof he could give of the Reality of his Paſſion, was, that,
provided her Heart and Hand were diſengaged, he would uſe his utmoſt
Endeavours to merit both. She aſſured him ſhe was intirely at her
Father's Diſpoſal, and that if he was ſerious in his Declaration, he
muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Marquis of <hi>Vendoſme.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, next Day he
paid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis a Viſit, and brought ſuch Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials, of his being a
Man of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Quality in <hi>England,</hi> that the Marquis had but one
Objection, which was an Unwillingneſs to part with my Mother; however, my
Father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed they would once a Year pay the Marquis a Viſit: So all
Things being agreed on, the Marriage was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with great Pomp and
Feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p> 
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0095100803:43"/> No ſooner were the Rejoicings end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than it was whiſper'd my Father was not a Man of Quality, but an Impoſtor.
This greatly afflicted both the Marquis and my Mother; they mentioned it to my
Father, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them it was a malicious Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood, rais'd by ſome
Perſons who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy'd his Happineſs. As it was too late to retract what was
done, they could only hope the beſt. Shortly after, my Father urg'd a
Neceſſity of his returning to <hi>London,</hi> to which the Marquis
reluctantly conſented.</p> 
                  <p> At <hi>Dover</hi> my Father's Chariot met them, carried them
to a very handſome Houſe, where there were a Number of Servants in rich
Liveries, waiting the Commands of the Bride and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom.</p> 
                  <p> But after all, not to hold you longer in Suſpenſe, my
Father was a Limner; but ſo excellent in his Art, that he could well afford
to keep his Wife like a Man of Quality. However, as there is no Country where
Perſons ſet <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0095100803:44"/> a higher Value on noble Blood than
<hi>France</hi>; my Mother was cruelly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to find herſelf impoſed
upon, and fell into a deep Melancholy, which preying on the very Pith of Life,
ſhe languiſh'd in a Conſumption for three Years and died, leaving me and
another Daughter deſolate Orphans.</p> 
                  <p> After this Loſs, which I was too young to regret, my Father
brought in a Woman, whom it ſeems he had ſome Time kept as a Miſtreſs,
to order his Houſhold, and take care of us, which ſhe did ſo well, that
at length my Father married her.</p> 
                  <p> Here happened a moſt ſtrange Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of Fortune to us:
For no ſooner did this Woman attain her Ends, than ſhe altered her Conduct,
and from a fawning Servant, turned a haughty and deſpotick Tyrant. My Father
was oblig'd to turn off all his old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, becauſe they did not pay
Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect enough to her Ladyſhip, for he had the Honour of Knighthood
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him by King <hi>William.</hi>
                  </p> 
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0095100803:45"/> This Step-Dame now continually
endeavour'd to ſet my Father againſt us; till at length, wearied out with
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, I hired myſelf as a Servant to the Governor's Lady of <hi>St.
Chriſtophers</hi>; and ſhe being informed who I was, treated me with the
utmoſt Kindneſs.</p> 
                  <p> This unhealthful Climate ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived me of her, who with
her dying Breath, recommended me to the Care of the Governor; he called me up,
told me her Requeſt, and kindly ſaid, whoever was dear to her, it ſhould
be his particular Care to protect, even for her Sake.</p> 
                  <p> I kneeled down by the Bedſide, to bleſs them both for
their Goodneſs, my Miſtreſs took my Hand, graſp'd it very hard, and
inſtantly expir'd.</p> 
                  <p> I fainted away, and my Maſter, as I was afterwards
informed, quitted the Chamber, bidding the Servants take care of the poor
Child.</p> 
                  <p> When the Funeral was over, and that the firſt Tranſports
of my Maſter's Sorrow were abated, he deſired to ſee <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0095100803:46"/>
me, and renew'd his kind Aſſurances of Protection and Favour to me. He made
me dine at his Table, ſaying, that my innocent Prattle diverted his
Melancholly; and I, ſtudious to pleaſe him, did it ſo effectually, that
inſtead of my being his Servant, he became mine; and as he was too humane and
generous, to entertain a diſhonourable Thought, he propoſed Matrimony to
me, an Offer too conſiderable for me to reject.</p> 
                  <p> The Evening before the Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for our Nuptials, my
dear Maſter, Friend, and Lover, was taken very ill, on which they were
deferred. But his Illneſs increaſing, he thought proper to have the
Marriage Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny performed, made his Will, and as he had no Children, left me
all his Fortune, and died the next Day.</p> 
                  <p> Though I cannot ſay I was in Love with this Gentleman, yet
Gratitude made me a ſincerely ſorrowful Widow; though I was young, rich,
and, as the World ſaid, handſome.</p> 
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0095100803:47"/> When my Year of Mourning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, I had
ſeveral Matches propoſed to me, of which I made Choice of the worſt. He
was an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> but to ſay the Truth had nothing but his
Perſon to recommend him. He was addicted to every Vice, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſoon ſquandered the plentiful Fortune I had brought him.</p> 
                  <p> And at laſt, one Day when I was abroad, he robbed the
Houſe of every thing it contained that was valuable, and he, with a Negro
Woman Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant I had, got on board a Veſſel bound for <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p> I was now plung'd into not only the Extremity of Sorrow, but
alſo of Want. However, being very expert at my Needle, particularly in
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery, and alſo very curious in Shell Work; I ſet up a School, and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed young Ladies. Money is very eaſy to be got there, and ſo it
ought, for the Iſland is productive of nothing for the Service of Life,
nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0095100803:48"/> Fruit nor Herbage, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there are no
Cattle, but what they have either from the Continent, or ſalted from
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </p> 
                  <p> Well; bad as the Place was, I lived there thirty Years after
the Departure of my ſecond Huſband, tolerably eaſy; till at length I
received, from an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captain of a Ship, a Letter from the
Siſter I have mentioned, who was extremely well married in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and gave me a kind Invitation to come and paſs the Remainder of my Life with
her.</p> 
                  <p> Accordingly I embraced the firſt Opportunity of returning
to my dear native Country; all the Ladies entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to ſtay, but finding
me deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to the contrary, they gave me ſignal Marks of their Favour:
Each making me a Preſent, and aſſuring me that if ever I returned, I
ſhould be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately received.</p> 
                  <p> We had a tolerable Voyage, even till we were in Sight of the
Engliſh Shore; when a furious Tempeſt aroſe, <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0095100803:49"/> which
ſet us almoſt beſide ourſelves. The Goods were thrown over Board, ſo
that I loſt all my Cloaths; and a few Minutes after, we ſtruck upon a Rock,
but by God's Providence, not a Soul periſhed. All that I ſaved was a
Baſket of Curioſities, ſuch as the Iſland afforded.</p> 
                  <p> But not to detain you with trivial Circumſtances, I got to
<hi>London,</hi> and went to my Siſter's Houſe, which I found hung with
black, ſhe in her Coffin, and the Hearſe ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey her to the
Grave.</p> 
                  <p> This was a dreadful Diſappointment to me, for I was quite a
Stranger, moneyleſs, and could not reaſonably hope for much Favour from a
Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law, whom I had never ſeen, eſpecially as the Link of the Chain
which united us, was now diſſolv'd.</p> 
                  <p> The next Day I went to him; and, upon telling him the
Circumſtances of my Life, exactly as my Siſter had done, he had the
Goodneſs to give me <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0095100803:50"/> her Cloathes; a ſeaſonable
Relief, as my own were loſt.</p> 
                  <p> The following Day I went into a Broker's Shop, to know if the
Perſon who kept it would buy ſome of my Merchandize: He deſired me to
come in, and ſeemed ſurpris'd at the Variety and Beauty of my Collection;
and perceiving me very faint, for indeed I was all almoſt famiſh'd, he
offered me a Dram; which I refus'd, as I was ſenſible it muſt have got
the better of one ſo weak as I was.</p> 
                  <p> However, I accepted of ſome Toaſt and Ale, which, I
really think, ſaved my Life: After this Act of Civility I told my
Diſtreſs to him, and he kindly gave me a Lodging, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended me to
you.</p> 
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I wrote a Petition for this unhappy Stranger; which had no manner
of Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on his Majeſty: I afterwards wrote to her Brother-in-law; who gave
her Five Guineas, with which Sum ſhe again ſet out for <hi>St.
Chriſtophers</hi>; and, as I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0095100803:51"/> learne, the
Ship, with all the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, were loſt.</p>
            <p>I think this poor Lady's Life was but a continual Scene of Storms
and Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, as if Heaven had 
<q> 
                  <l>Bar'd her Boſom to the Thunderſtone.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! how ſhall we poor Reptiles preſume to judge the Ways
of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; all things are ordered with Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Beauty; though, like a
Fly, our feeble Ray ſees but an Inch around, yet dares diſlike the
Structure of the Whole.</p>
            <p>As well might a Mariner, in the midſt of the wide World of
congregated Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, hope, with his Line, to ſound the deep Abyſs, as our
finite Minds to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Ways of Deity. 
<q> 
                  <l>Here then let us reſt,</l>
               </q> Whatever is, is right;
Wiſdom and Goodneſs govern all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0095100803:52"/>Reader, have Patience with my Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophick
Whimſies, which I muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indulge: 'Tis frequent, in
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, to ſay, of thoſe that are drown'd, That they are gone to
the Bottom of the Sea; but, with due Deference to better Judges, I cannot
conceive the Ocean to have any Bottom, except near the Shore. I have obſerved
every ſingle Drop of Water to be an intire Globe; put an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to it, they
unite by Adheſion of Parts, like Quickſilver, to form a larger: Thus the
tributary Streams pour in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Chryſolites, to form that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
Maſs of Waters, which we term the Ocean, and which, no Doubt, goes quite
through the Center of the Earth, without any middle Way to ſtop it.</p>
            <p>I know it may be here objected, that a Ship loſt on one Side
ought, by this Rule, to riſe at the oppoſite Place: Not at all; the
Preſſure of the Atmoſphere is every-where equal, nor is there any ſuch
thing as up or down in Nature: As many Stars beſpread the Firmament beneath
us, as above us: As Travellers, ſuch as have <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0095100803:53"/> ſailed
round the World, ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and did not the ſtrong Laws of
Gravitation hold all in firm Union, the Sea, no Doubt, would tumble on our
Heads.</p>
            <p>Oh! thou rever'd Spirit of NEWTON, who couldſt take the
Dimenſion of each Planet in our Solar Syſtem, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to

            <p>I always find in myſelf a ſtrong Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Criticiſm,
and, if I live to finiſh this Volume, I ſhall certainly indulge it: For my
Part, let the World ſay what they pleaſe of Criticks, I eſteem them as
very uſeful Members of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Learning. Whatever is well
written will ſtand the Teſt of ſtrict Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, ay, and of Ridicule
too; and when that is paſt, the Work appears like Gold from the Furnace, with
ten-fold Luſtre: Therefore I fairly invite the whole Body of Criticks to
canvas my Writings; if they point out an Error I ſhall eſteem them as
Friends, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to amend: If they make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious 
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0095100803:56"/> Criticiſm, for ſome ſuch I have ſeen publiſh'd
againſt me, they prove their own Ignorance, and cannot give me a greater
Triumph: I only wiſh I may have a <hi>Longinus,</hi> not a <hi>Zoilus,</hi>
to judge me.</p>
            <p>Well now, Mrs. <hi>Pilkington,</hi> ſays, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, my Reader,
What, in the Name of Wonder have we to do with all this?</p>
            <p>Why, truly, no more, I think, than with a Buff Jerkin, or mine
Hoſteſs at <hi>St. Albans</hi>; but I am no Methodiſt either in Writing
or Religion; ſometimes Irregularities pleaſe; ſhapeleſs Rock, or
hanging Precipice, preſent to the poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Imagination more inſpiring
Dreams than could the fineſt Garden: Where 
<q> 
                  <l>Grove nods at Grove, each Alley has a Brother,</l> 
                  <l>And half the Platform juſt reflects the other.</l>
               </q> I am,
in ſhort, an Heteroclite, or irre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gular Verb, which can never be declined, or
conjugated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0095100803:57"/>But however, conſidering it was a Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of myſelf, I promiſed to the World, I now proceed in it thus:</p>
            <p>Two very fine young Gentlemen, whom I did not know, came to buy
ſome Prints, and obſerving a large Book in Manuſcript, open before me,
one of them demanded, Was that my Account-Book? I aſſured the Gentlemen, my
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue was eaſily caſt up, and that I was but a bad Arithmetician, though
I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently dealt in Figures and Numbers.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman, whom I preſently after found was an Earl, by his
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions calling him by his Title, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on ſeeing the Subject of
my Amuſement. This was the Firſt Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of my Work, which when once he had
began, he went quite through with, and gave it more Applauſe than ever an
Author's dear Partiality to their own Offspring could poſſibly make me
believe it deſerved.</p>
            <p>However, his Lordſhip made a juſt Remark, That I was very fond
of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0095100803:58"/> the Sun by way of Simile, in all my Poems,
and ſaid, he had a Mind to cut it out where-ever he met it.</p>
            <p>I told his Lordſhip, he would then leave my Book in the Land of
Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Shadow of Death.</p>
            <p>The Earl then aſked me, if I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to print it? I ſaid I
would, if I could get Subſcribers to it, otherwiſe it muſt, like many
other valuable things, be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Oblivion. He gave me a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
and, as it was Dinner-time, took his Leave, with a Promiſe of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Coffee with me the next Evening; when, as it was <hi>Sunday,</hi> I ſhould be
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged from Buſineſs; which Promiſe, however, he did not fulfil;
and having vainly expected him till Eight, I then went up Stairs, to ſit with
the Counteſs of <hi>Yarmouth</hi>'s Steward's Wife; and, on my Return, found
my Shop broke open, and every Article of my Wearing Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel taken away: This
was a dreadful Mortification, and a ſad Loſs! All my Comfort was, that the
Thieves had taken nothing but what belonged to me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0095100803:59"/>This Robbery quite ruin'd me, as I was obliged
to lay out my Money for Neceſſaries to appear decent; my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord ſeiz'd
for a Quarter's Rent, though he was my Countryman, and profeſs'd great
Friendſhip for me.</p>
            <p>I was once more in doleful Plight; however, I got a
ready-furniſh'd Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, juſt tolerable.</p>
            <p>One Evening, when I came Home from a Friend's, my Landlady told
me, there was a young Woman to viſit me, who wept ſadly that I was abroad.
I aſk'd her what ſort of a Perſon ſhe was? She told me, ſhe thought
ſhe greatly reſembled me, and that ſhe would be with me early in the
Morning: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſhe came, and I knew her, at firſt Sight, to be my
Daughter: The Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize made me faint away; not but I was very glad to ſee
her, but Joy is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming as Grief; and when I conſider'd how little it was
in my Power to help her, it quite ſurk my Spirits. She was in a Garb which
beſpoke Poverty, and gave me <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0095100803:60"/> a long Account of her
Father's Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to her, and his youngeſt Son.</p>
            <p>A few Days after her Arrival came the Son I have now with me, from
on board a Privateer, as ragged as a Prodigal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from keeping Swine;
but, poor Child, I wonder how he ſubſiſted at all, conſidering the
Hardſhips he had ſuffer'd, and what to do with them both I could not tell:
Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Author of
<hi>Clariſſa.</hi>
               </note> was ſo kind to give my Son a new Suit of
Clothes, which put him in a Capacity of going amongſt my Friends, from whom I
received a tranſient Relief.</p>
            <p>At length the Girl, finding how Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were, went to wait on a
Lady, and Captain <hi>Meade</hi> took my Son with him on board a Man of War,
with which a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Tranſports, and others, then went on a ſecret
Expedition, but were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in their Deſign, by having their Intentions
betray'd to the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, this was a little Reſpite to me: I heard
<hi>Worſdale</hi> was in <hi>London,</hi> and wrote to him, but receiv'd no
Anſwer; a Day <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0095100803:61"/> or two after, as I was going through
<hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> pretty early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who ſhould I ſee but
the very iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Man, ſtanding at a Coffee-Houſe Door!</p>
            <p>I ſtop'd, and look'd at him, when he immediately recollected me,
and ſeem'd over-joy'd to ſee me: He invited me to Breakfaſt, and told me,
he was upon his Keeping; ſo that he had been obliged to quit a pretty
ready-furniſh'd Houſe, he had in <hi>Mount-Street, Berkley-Square,</hi> and
leave it to the Care of a Servant, to retire to this privileg'd Place.</p>
            <p>After Breakfaſt he deſired I would write a Letter for him to
the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Ambaſſador, and to two others, whom I have now
forgot, to beg their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; which accordingly he obtain'd, though not
directly. He made me dine with him, and promiſed to reward me when he
ſhould be at Liberty to purſue his Work; and, in the mean time, he ſaid,
I ſhould be welcome to his Houſe in <hi>Mount-Street</hi>; an Offer which I
readily <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0095100803:62"/> accepted, as well for the fine Air, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rent-free.</p>
            <p>He allow'd me a Shilling a Day to live on, which I could very well
do: But he came every Morning to know how much I had wrote. He would give me
Fifteen Subjects at once, and expected I ſhould compoſe ſomething
excellent on every one of them: In ſhort, there was no End to my Labour, nor
any Relaxation from it, except ſometimes a kind of troubled Sleep; for,
amongſt other Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, I was not able to make my Bed, nor light the
Fire; and the old Woman, his Houſe-keeper, proud, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and inſolent
beyond Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſk'd me, Where the Devil I was bred, that I could not
ſweep Rooms, light Fires, and make Beds, as well as other Servants; and that
truly Mr. <hi>Worſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> was a Fool to hire me, who did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but
write all Day long.</p>
            <p>Though I conceiv'd a good deal of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at being thought
the Servant of a Colour-grinder's Son, yet I could not <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0095100803:63"/>
forbear laughing at the Ideas of this good Creature.</p>
            <p>Never did any Soul lead a more ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Life than poor
<hi>Laetitia</hi>; for <hi>Worſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> had poſitively order'd the old
Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man not to let any human Creature come near me; and ſhe punctually obey'd
him, more out of Malice than Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.</p>
            <p>In this Sequeſtration from the World I wrote three Ballad
Operas, one of them plan'd on the Story of the old Song, <hi>A Pennyworth of
Wit</hi>; where I have ſo exalted the Wife over the Harlot, that at laſt,
as <hi>Worſdale</hi> is a profeſt Libertine, I began to think it was quite
neceſſary to apologize for his writing any thing to the Honour of Virtue,
or expoſing of Vice; ſo I wrote the following Epilogue, to be ſpoke by a
Woman: 
<q> 
                  <lg>
                     <head>EPILOGUE to <hi>Virtue Triumphant.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <l>DUce on't, I wonder what the Author means,</l>
                     <l>To peſter thus the Stage with moral Scenes!</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0095100803:64"/>The Fool! He ſent me hither to
excuſe him;</l>
                     <l>Faith I'll be even with him, and abuſe him.</l>
                     <l>I hope he liſtens, while I ſpeak my Thoughts</l>
                     <l>And tell, what he muſt bear to hear, his Faults.</l>
                     <l>Firſt he endeavours, in a free-born Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</l>
                     <l>To bring the wearing Fetters into Faſhion,</l>
                     <l>Nor would have loving Couples go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</l>
                     <l>Till they are yok'd by matrimonial tether.</l>
                     <l>Here he does plainly Liberty invade,</l>
                     <l>And is, beſides an Enemy to Trade:</l>

                     <l>And, when her Looks no longer Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire,</l>
                     <l>Does wiſely to a Nunnery retire:</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0095100803:65"/>But here ſhould pretty Females leave

                     <l>What muſt they do? betake themſelves to Spinning!</l>
                     <l>Why, ſure, 'twou'd vex the Heart of <hi>Jew,</hi> or

                     <l>To ſee the pretty playful Creatures work.</l>
                     <l>Well, after all his railing thus at Harlots,</l>

            </p>
            <p>I am ſorry I have not the Opera, but <hi>Worſdale</hi> was too
cunning for me, and ſeiz'd it, ſheet by Sheet, as faſt as I wrote it: And
having now Liberty, by means of the Protection, and a good deal of Work
beſpoke in the City, he took a Floor near the <hi>Royal-Exchange,</hi> in a
large old-faſhion'd Houſe, with very antique Furniture; and there he gave
me a little Room to myſelf; but, as it was within-ſide of his
Painting-room, I was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner all the Morning, and might faſt and write
till Three o'Clock in the Day; then I was called to Dinner, of Beef-ſteaks,
or Mutton-chops, cook'd by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: The manner of our eating I muſt
deſcribe.</p>
            <p>We had four Play-bills laid for a Table-cloth, Knives, Forks, or
Plates, had we none; no matter for that—
<q>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0095100803:67"/> 
                  <l>I had a Blade,</l> 
                  <l>With which my tuneful Pens were made—</l> 
                  <l>And, ſo to make my Dinner ſure,</l> 
                  <l>I for a Fork employ'd a Skewer.</l>
               </q> The Butter, when we
had any, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in the cool and fragrant Receſs of an old Shoe, a
Coffee-pot of mine ſerved for as many Uſes as ever <hi>Scrub</hi> had, for
ſometimes it boil'd Coffee, ſometimes Tea, it brought ſmall Beer,
ſtrong Beer, and I am more than half afraid it has been applied to leſs
noble Uſes; but be that as it may, I've done the Man ſome Service, and he
knows it—No more of that.</p>
            <p>He happened to paint, as he told me, the young Chevalier's
Picture, at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter.</hi> As he went to <hi>Richmond</hi> he left all
his Pictures in my Care, when, one Morning, a very beautiful young Lady, of
about Sixteen, and her Brother, a fine young Gentleman, came to the Houſe: I
was called down, and they walk'd up Stairs; when, after a little Heſitation, 
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0095100803:68"/> the Lady aſk'd me, could ſhe ſee the Picture of the
Highlander? I anſwered, yes, and brought it to her: She kiſs'd the Face,
Feet, and every Bit of it; and judging from this that ſhe was a Roman
Catholick, a Religion that 
<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord <hi>Lucan,</hi> eldeſt Son to the
Earl of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malock.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Patrick Sarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>'s Neice can
never hate, let who will take Offence at it; for he was generous, noble, and
humane; and, in God's Name, let every one of his Creatures be as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and
juſt as he, (and no Doubt but he will look down well pleas'd, and bleſs the
fair Variety).</p>
            <p>The young Lady repeated two Lines of a Poem of Lady <hi>Mary
Wortley Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> on ſeeing this Picture: 
<q> 
                  <l>In ev'ry Linament of which we trace</l> 
                  <l>The injur'd Saint, and Royal Martyr's Face.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Their Curioſity being ſatisfied, the Lady would have given me
ſome Money: I told her, I was not a Servant, but that, as I lodged in the
Houſe, Mr. <hi>Worſdale</hi> left the Pictures in my Care: Madam, 
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0095100803:69"/> ſays ſhe, I beg Pardon; but how can I make you a
Recompence for your Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? By giving me, Madam, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Poem:
She repeated it; and, finding I had ſomething like Taſte, ſhe kindly
embraced me, giving me a Direction where to wait on her; and we parted, I
believe, delighted with each other; but I only ſpeak for myſelf.—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Worſdale</hi> came to Town, and called on this Lady, and
Gentleman: They were ſo kind to praiſe me highly, and aſk him, who I was?
He declared he did not know; he left, he ſaid, an old Chairwoman to look
after his Houſe, perhaps it was ſhe.—</p>
            <p>This Anſwer did not ſatisfy them, they were ſo
unreaſonable as to inſiſt on it, that I was a Gentlewoman, that they knew
it by my Speech, and Hands, by my refuſing Money, and begging Poetry: But
<hi>Worſdale</hi> renounced me more heartily than ever he did the Devil,
whoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant he is.—</p>
            <p>He came home very angry, abuſed me at an unmerciful rate, and
told me, I <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0095100803:70"/> ſhould not ſtay in his Houſe, to ſhew
my Wit and Breeding, forſooth, when I had neither; and boaſt of my Family,
when it would have been better for me to have been the Daughter of a Cobler. As
this Fellow always boaſted of his being Sir <hi>Godfrey Kneller</hi>'s
Baſtard, I could not avoid telling him, that ſome People were ſo fond of
Family, that, to keep it up, they would prove themſelves Sons of Whores.</p>
            <p>The Hour of my Deliverance, from this worſe than
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage, now approach'd; a young Woman, for whom I had wrote
ſeveral Love-Letters to a Gentleman who had, it ſeems, kept her till he
married, and then forſook her, as indeed he ought, found me out.</p>
            <p>The Scheme was to perſuade him, that at the Time he
diſmiſſed her, ſhe was with Child by him, though ſhe in Reality
confeſt ſhe was never in that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in her Life: But, Bite the
Biter was fair enough; if he cheated her out of Innocence (a Loſs never to be
retriev'd) I think ſhe had a juſt Title to ſome of <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0095100803:71"/>
his Money, of which he had more than he knew how to uſe.</p>
            <p>I was writing a melancholy Epiſtle for her, when in came
<hi>Worſdale</hi>; he gave me a furious Look, and withered all my Strength
before he ſpoke; then he went out of the Chamber, and ſent for me,
demanding of me, whether I intended to neglect his Buſineſs, and turn
Secretary for the Whores. I was really ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that he of all Men,
ſhould fall ſo hard on kind Females; and as their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was honeſtly
earn'd by me, and they are generally liberal, I never thought I did any thing
amiſs, in helping them out with a ſoft Epiſtle: He ſtorm'd at me, ſhe
heard him, and finding his Wrath was raiſed on her Account, was very much
troubled, and ſlipping a Guinea into my Hand ſoftly, whiſpered me to come
to her Houſe in <hi>Golden-ſquare,</hi> and ſhe would make me full amends
for my Vexation.—Of all Men I ever ſaw, <hi>W—e</hi> has the
ſtrongeſt Appearance of Charity and Compaſſion, and the leaſt of it
in reality. He would take any curious <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0095100803:72"/> Artiſt out of
trouble, provided their Work, which he appropriated to himſelf, would yield
him ten-fold Intereſt. Love, Favour, or even common Decency, no Perſon ever
met with from him, except on terms of becoming his Slave. I have often
reflected with Wonder, on the vaſt Propenſity that appears in Perſons of
Quality, to provide for the ſpurious Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Beggars, Vagrants,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving themſelves of the Enjoyments of Life, to
amaſs vaſt Treaſure, and when that tremendous Hour arrives, in which all
earthly Glories, Honours, Wealth, and Titles, cannot give a Moment's Eaſe, or
prolong frail Life, the Queſtion is, 
<q rend="inline">"How ſhall I diſpoſe of this, to appeaſe
that God, at whoſe Tribunal I expect ſhortly to appear? Oh! I'll leave it
all to the Poor."</q>—As if the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent could not ſee through the
ſhallow Device, or that his eternal Kingdom was to be purchaſed with their
Leavings.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved, that moſt of thoſe, who have choſen to be
publick ſpirited after their Death, have in their Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time 
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0095100803:73"/> been meer unhoſpitable narrow hearted Souls; and if a
Perſon of Birth and polite Education, had by any Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune fallen into
Diſtreſs, and made an Application to them, ſuch would not fail of meeting
with an Affront, and having their Letter ſent back open, with the Civil
Meſſage, that truly my Lord or my Lady did not know any Thing of it, and
had Dependants enough of their own to provide for.</p>
            <p>And pray now let us enquire, who are theſe Poor, that the
publick and private are eternally providing for; are there not Collections
daily in Churches, beſides the vaſt Legacies left to Pariſhes,
Hoſpitals, &amp;c. and yet to Appearance no Soul the better.</p>
            <p>Are not the Streets infeſted with Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars of all Denominations?
and in the Houſes, Objects that would raiſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in any humane,
well-judging Perſon?</p>
            <p>Here we ſhall find a poor Wretch, for a few Shillings a Week,
ſlaving to ſupport a Wife and Children, and perhaps <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0095100803:74"/> at
the End of the Quarter, is ſtripped by a cruel Landlord, and torn
relentleſly from the Relief of his Family, while they are expoſed to the
ſharpeſt Pangs of Want, Cold and Nakedneſs.</p>
            <p>And where ſhall they apply for Relief? if to the Pariſh,
perhaps they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a few Half-penee, but no real Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</p>
            <p>If to a beneficent Lady, who diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes herſelf, by
giving a Gown once in the Year to ſome particular old Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Women, and
Six-pence a Week for their Support, to give them a Taſte of Life, (as the
ſame Woman muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be ſerv'd two Years ſucceſſively)
Why, truly my Lady <hi>Bountifull</hi> is not at home, or the Servant durſt
not carry up any Letter or Petitions: So the poor Sufferer may return, loaden
with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and ſwollen with Sorrow.</p>
            <p>And yet this Lady expects to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deified for her
Munificence, and Patriotiſm; ſhe laid out her Money on a Houſe, not to
ſatisfy her Vanity, but to employ her diſtreſſed Countrymen; 
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0095100803:75"/> ſhe never ſaw the Naked, but ſhe cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; nor
the Sick, but ſhe viſited them; nor the Hungry or Thirſty but ſhe
relieved them, whilſt the Rich ſhe ſent empty away. In which charitable
Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of her own Virtues, ſhe expects to go directly to Heaven; but now
hear the Opinion of Impartiality.</p>
            <p>Indeed ſhe never ſaw her Fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Diſtreſs,
but ſhe being of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Temper, found it neceſſary for her
own Quiet, to relieve them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhe always choſe a back Room to
ſit in, that ſhe might not view ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable Objects; and in
order to ſave her Money for ſome great laſt Stroke, if Perſons of Rank
dine or ſup with her, they muſt take ſuch as the Houſe affords, by
which Means the Rich are always ſent empty away.</p>
            <p>If no body knows this Picture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out writing the Name under it,
I will confeſs myſelf to be as bad a Painter as <hi>W—e.</hi>

            <p>Dean SWIFT's excellent Scheme for building an Hoſpital for
Lunaticks and <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0095100803:76"/> Idiots, was of a different Caſt from
thoſe of moſt other Men, as it was not a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter utter'd with his laſt
Breath, but ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, calculated, and determined for many Years before, as
the following Lines in his Elegy on his own Death ſufficiently evince. 
<q> 
                  <l>He left the little Wealth he had,</l> 
                  <l>To build a Houſe, for Fools and Mad,</l> 
                  <l>And ſhew'd by one Satyrick Touch,</l> 
                  <l>No Nation wanted it ſo much.</l>
               </q> And according to his
uſual Wiſdom, he committed the Regulation of it to Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of real
Worth, Honour, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, in which, would others follow ſo great, ſo
laudable an Example, perhaps the many Sums that were deſigned for good

<hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </note>Uſes, but are now appropriated to the purchaſing
Eſtates, and ſplendid Equipages for ſome particular People, might have
the wiſh'd Effect of being a univerſal Benefit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0095100803:77"/>The <hi>Dean</hi> could not abide the thought
of being like other Mortals, forgot as ſoon as his venerable Duſt was
convey'd to the Earth; and therefore he always endeavour'd to render himſelf
worthy of a grateful Remembrance in the Hearts of the People; yet how true are
his own Lines!</p>
            <q> 
               <l>And now the Dean no more is miſs'd,</l> 
               <l>Than if he never did exiſt;</l> 
               <l>Except amongſt old-faſhioned Folks,</l> 
               <l>Who now and then repeat his Jokes.</l>
            </q>
            <p>A remarkable Inſtance of his whimſical Diſpoſition, which
I omitted in my firſt Volume, as I find 
<q> 
                  <l>His ſacred Name remains ſtill dear,</l> 
                  <l>To every juſt Hibernian Ear;</l>
               </q> I will here inſert,
and muſt ſay, 'tis with infinite Pleaſure, I find that my weak Attempts
to delineate his inimitable Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, have met with ſuch unhoped
Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, both here and in <hi>England</hi>; <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0095100803:78"/> not ſo
much for the Vanity of an Author, as the Pleaſure I feel at ſeeing ſo
vaſt a Reſpect paid to his Memory.</p>
            <p>I believe the <hi>Dean</hi> on his firſt coming to
<hi>Ireland,</hi> was very melancholy, and indeed it was not to be wonder'd at,
as he was then ſeparated from thoſe whom he lov'd, Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> Lord
<hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> &amp;c. and in one of his Poems, he ſeems to deſpair
of meeting with Friendſhip in a ſtrange Country, or that, 
<q> 
                  <l>Not a Judas could be found,</l> 
                  <l>To ſell him for three Hundred Pound.</l>
               </q> I one Day
aſk'd him how he came to write that Poem; he told me he had three Times like
to have been hang'd, 
<q rend="inline">"and, Pox take me, ſaid he, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the
People thought I could bring the Pretender in my Hand, and place him on the
Throne."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I remember a worthy Gentleman, who had the Honour of his
Acquaintance, told me, that the Dean and ſome other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Taſte,
whom I do not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0095100803:79"/> came to a Reſolution to
have a Feaſt once a Year, in imitation of the <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> which, in
heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> was held about the Time we keep our
<hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> whereat the Servants perſonated their Maſters, and
the Maſters waited as Servants.</p>
            <p>The firſt Time they put this Scheme in Practice, was at the
Deanery Houſe. When all the Servants were ſeated, and every Gentleman
placed behind his own Man, the Dean's Servant took an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of finding
Fault with ſome Meat that was not done to his Taſte, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up in
his Hand, he threw it in his Maſter's Face, and mimick'd him in every other
Foible which he had ever diſcover'd in him.</p>
            <p>At this the Dean flew in a violent Rage, beat the Fellow, and put
every Thing into ſuch Diſorder, that the Servants affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fled the
Room; and here ended the Feaſt of <hi>Saturnalia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stella,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mrs. <hi>Johnſon,</hi>
ſaid to be his own Siſter.</note> whom he has ſo beautifully praiſed
through his Writings, was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0095100803:80"/> his Wife, though they
never, I am convinced, taſted even the chaſte Joys which Hymen allows.</p>
            <p>It is certain, they retain'd for each other, a moſt tender Love;
and though they did not indulge the Deſires of the Body, yet their Souls were
united by the ſtricteſt Bonds of divine and ſocial Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>He, in the latter Part of his Life, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to acknowledge her as
the Partner of his Heart; but ſhe wiſely declin'd it, knowing that while
ſhe continued only as a Viſitor, he would treat her with Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; which
would ceaſe, as his Temper was unpaſſive, if ſhe lived intirely with
him; and every Fault of his Servants would be attributed to her. I am certain
he muſt have tenderly loved that Lady, as I have been a Witneſs, that the
bare mention of her Name has drawn Tears from him, which it was not eaſy to
ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>I remember he ſent for me one Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very early, to
Breakfaſt; and as I always drank Tea or Coffee, I expected 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0095100803:81"/> to have found one of theſe ready; but after he had
detained me two Hours, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing on his Houſhold Oeconomy, and other
Matters, amongſt which one was, that a Piece of his Garden Wall had fallen
down; and 
<q rend="inline">"ſo ſaid he,"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"one of my Fellows forſooth, muſt needs get a
Trowel and Mortar, and undertake to mend the Breach.</q>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"I happened, continued the Dean, to ſpy him out
of my Window at this Employment, and call'd to him to know why he did that? he
told me he had been bred a Bricklayer, and that his doing it, would ſave me
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; ſo I let him finiſh it, which he did very compleatly in about an
Hour's time. I gave him a Moidore; and Pox take me, but the Fellow inſtead of
going as he ought, to the Alehouſe or a Whore, went and bought Silver
Buckles, and is grown very proud upon it."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I think, Sir, ſaid I, the Man made a good Hour's Work of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0095100803:82"/> 
               <q rend="inline">"Come ſaid he, ſhall we go to Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, I
know you were once <hi>Bermudas</hi> mad; now I'll give you ſome of that
Country Cheer; <hi>open</hi> that Drawer and reach me a flat Bottle you'll find
there."</q> I ran to obey him, and as the Drawer was low, kneeled down to
it.</p>
            <p>I no ſooner attempted to unlock the Drawer, but he flew at me
and beat me moſt immoderately; I again made an Effort, and ſtill he beat
me, crying, 
<q rend="inline">"Pox take you, <hi>open</hi> the Drawer."</q> I
once more tried, and he ſtruck me ſo hard, that I burſt into Tears, and
ſaid, Lord, Sir, what muſt I do?</p>
            <p>Pox take you for a Slut, ſaid he, 
<q rend="inline">"would you ſpoil my Lock, and break my Key?"</q>
Why, Sir the Drawer is lock'd. 
<q rend="inline">"Oh! I beg Pardon, ſaid he, I thought you were
going to pull it out by the Key; well, open it and do what I bid you."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I did ſo, and found the Bottle. 
<q rend="inline">"Now ſaid he,"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"you muſt know I always breakfaſt between my
own Houſe and the Church, and I carry my Proviſion <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0095100803:83"/> in
my Pocket,"</q> upon this he pulled out a Piece of Gingerbread, and offered me
ſome.</p>
            <p>As I was terribly afflicted with the Heart-burn, the very thoughts
of any thing ſo dry, made me ten times worſe, which I told him, and begged
he would excuſe me. He poſitively inſiſted on my eating a Piece of it,
which I was, on Penalty of another Beating, obliged to comply with.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"Now, ſaid he, you muſt take a Sup out of my
Bottle."</q> I juſt held it to my Mouth, and found it ſo ſtrong, that I
intreated he would not aſk me to taſte it: He endeavoured to perſuade me;
but finding that would not avail, he threw me down, forced the Bottle into my
Mouth, and pour'd ſome of the Liquor down my Throat, which I thought would
have ſet my very Stomach on Fire. He then gravely went to Prayers, and I
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, not greatly delighted, but, however, glad to come off no
worſe. I went the enſuing. Evening to pay a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to my Kinſman Doctor
<hi>S—ge,</hi> 
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0095100803:84"/> then lately conſecrated Lord
B—p of ****. This Gentleman, and his Family, were extremely fond of my
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and always pleaſed when I did my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Honour to call on them;
and received me with that Eaſe and Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, peculiar to well bred
People. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated the Biſhop on his Preferment: He modeſtly told me,
that his Honours did not ſit eaſy on him, and that he would willingly
diſpence with his Friends not ſaluting him by his Title of Lord, as it
always made him uneaſy. He then aſked me, as he ſaw my Father's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
at the Door, where I intended to go? I told him, to the Dean. Well, ſaid he,
I beg you'll give my Compliments to him, and tell him, That, as 'tis to his
Recommendation I owe my preſent Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, I am ſurpriſed I never had
the Pleaſure of ſeeing him ſince he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred ſo great a Favouron me:
While I was plain Doctor <hi>S—ge,</hi> continued he, the Dean uſed to
ſend his Wine and Bread before him, and frequently take a Dinner with me; but
now, I believe, he is <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0095100803:85"/> aſham'd to own me: Pray ſpeak to
him, and let me know his Anſwer. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed I would, and then
departed.</p>
            <p>I found the Dean at home, and alone, which gave me an immediate
Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of delivering the B—p's Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. He liſten'd to me
very attentively, and then ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"Oh, I remember ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it: L—d
<hi>C—t</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to me for a Perſon to make a Biſhop of, whom I
knew was not an honeſt Man; and, as I wanted the Living of
<hi>W—b</hi>'s for <hi>D—y,</hi> I recommended <hi>S—ge</hi>
to the Biſhoprick, with an Aſſurance, that he would anſwer his
Excellency's Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and Pox take me if I ever thought him worth my
Contempt, till I had made a Biſhop of him."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Dean then told me, that as he had no Company, and did not know
how to diſpoſe of his time, I ſhould have the Honour to ſup with him;
and, ſaid he, I will give you a moſt kingly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0095100803:86"/>I accordingly waited, in Expectation of ſome
extraordinary Repaſt, till about Nine o'Clock, in which Interval, my Readers
may be aſſured, I wanted not Amuſements for the Mind: However, at length,
the Cloth was laid on a ſmall Table, and, to my great Surprize, the Servant
brought up four blue Eggs, on a China Plate: 
<q rend="inline">"Here, Huſſey, ſaid he, is a Plover's Egg;
King <hi>William</hi> uſed to give Crowns apiece for them, and thought it
Prophanation in a Subject to eat one of them; as he was, amongſt his other
immortal Perfections, an Epicure, a Glutton, and a—Hold, ſaid he, I had
like to have ſpoken Treaſon: But how do you like the Eggs?"</q> Sir, I have
eat none yet. 
<q rend="inline">"Well, eat like a Monarch then, and tell me your
Opinion."</q> I did eat, and told him, I had not that elevated Notion of his
Banquet, which he might poſſibly have, from ſo great a Precedent. 
<q rend="inline">"Well, ſaid he, theſe Eggs coſt me Six-pence
apiece, which is a little extravagant, conſidering a Herring will coſt but
a <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0095100803:87"/> Halfpenny; but I never exceed two; and this is the only
Article in which I am luxurious."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt here again apologize to my Reader for my frequent
Digreſſions, in which, however, 'tis poſſible, they will find more
Entertainment than a ſimple Narrative will afford.</p>
            <p>I believe there never was any Set of People ſo happy in
ſincere and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Friendſhip, as the Dean, Doctor <hi>Delany,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Pilkington,</hi> and myſelf; nor can I reflect, at this Hour, on any
thing with more Pleaſure, than thoſe happy Moments we have enjoyed! 'Tis
for this Reaſon I am fond of mentioning Matters; which bring the pleaſing
Ideas to my Mind. I have obſerved, that the Scent of a Flower, or the Tune of
a Song, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways conveys to Remembrance the exact Image of the Place in which
they were firſt noticed. Well, therefore, in the Relation of a Story, where
one Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance inſenſibly brings on another, may a Writer, who
ſcorns to deal in Romance, be led, like me, to digreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0095100803:88"/>Mrs. <hi>Barber,</hi> whoſe Name, at her
earneſt Requeſt, I omitted in my firſt Volume, and who was the Lady I
mentioned to have been with me, at my firſt Interview with the Dean at Dr.
<hi>Delany</hi>'s Seat, was at this time writing a Volume of Poems, ſome of
which I fanſy might, at this Day, be ſeen in the Cheeſemongers,
Chandlers, Paſtry-cooks, and Second-hand Book-ſellers Shops: However, dull
as they were, they certainly would have been much worſe, but that Doctor
<hi>Delany</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently held what he called a <hi>Senatus Conſultum,</hi>
to correct theſe undigeſted Materials; at which were preſent ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Dean, (in the Chair) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Mrs. <hi>Grierſon,</hi> Mr.

for this Purpoſe, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him the following Lines, which, as they
contain a Compliment to me, from ſo eminent a Hand, I muſt inſert: Take
notice, that as we were both diminutive in Size, Mr. <hi>Pilkington</hi> was

               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0095100803:90"/>We obeyed the Summons, and had a very elegant
Entertainment; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards proceeded to our Buſineſs, which we
completed, to the Satisfaction of all Parties.</p>
            <p>Of all the Gentlemen I ever knew, this I muſt ſay, that Doctor
<hi>Delany</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels in one Point particularly; which is, in giving an
elegant Entertainment, with Eaſe, Chearfulneſs, and an Hoſpitality, which
makes the Company happy.</p>
            <p>Lord <hi>Carteret,</hi> in his Lieutenancy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very fond of
this Gentleman, who is indeed worthy of univerſal Eſteem, came one Day,
quite unattended, and told the Doctor he was come to dine with him. He thank'd
his Excellency for the Honour he confer'd on him, and invited him to walk into
his (beautiful) Gardens; which his Excellency did, with great good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
They took a Turn or two, when the Servant came to inform them, that Dinner was
on the Table. The Doctor had generally ſomething nice, in the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for
himſelf and his Mother, to whom he behaved with true filial Tenderneſs 
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0095100803:91"/> and Reſpect; for which, no Doubt, his Days will be long
in the Land, which the Lord hath given him.</p>
            <p>The Doctor made the old Lady do the Honours of his Table; for
which, nor for the Entertainment, he never made the leaſt Apology, but told
his Lordſhip, that 
<q> 
                  <l>To Stomachs cloy'd with coſtly Fare,</l> 
                  <l>Simplicity alone was rare.</l>

            <p>This Demeanor of his was infinitely agreeable to Lord
<hi>C—t,</hi> who, tho' a Courtier, hated Ceremony when he ſought
Pleaſure, which is indeed incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with it. And what Reſpect
ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our Nobility may think is owing to the <hi>French</hi> Mode of
cringing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimenting, I muſt confeſs I never ſee it practiſed,
without a peculiar Pain, which I can compare to nothing but the
Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions I am under at the Sight of Tumblers, Rope-dancers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch as, I believe, all rational Creatures ſhare, at
ſeeing Men deform their Viſages by a <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0095100803:92"/> thouſand
aukward Grimaces, and their Bodies like jointed Babies, only becauſe it is
Alamode Francoiſe: Neither do we often ſee any but the moſt illiterate
Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs practiſe it.</p>
            <p>His Excellency, after the Cloth was taken away and the Bottle
introduced, (when conſequently, the Lady departed) told the Doctor, 
<q rend="inline">"that he always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him a moſt well-bred
Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but never had ſo clear a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it, as he had this
Day ſeen. Others, ſaid he, whom I have tried the ſame Experiment on, have
met me in as much Confuſion as if I came to arreſt them for High-Treaſon;
nay, they would not give me a Moment of their Converſation; which, and not
their Dinner, I ſought, but hurry from me; and then, if I had any Appetite,
deprive me of it by their fulſome Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies for Defects. This, ſaid his
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, is like a Story I heard the Dean tell of a Lady, who had given him
an Invitation to Dinner: As ſhe heard he was not eaſily pleaſed, ſhe
had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0095100803:93"/> a Month to provide for it. When the Time came,
every Delicacy which could be purchaſed, the Lady had prepared, even to
Profuſion, (which you know <hi>Swift</hi> hated.) However, the Dean was
ſcarce ſeated, when ſhe began to make a ceremonious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue; in which
ſhe told him, that ſhe was ſincerely ſorry ſhe had not a more
tolerable Dinner, ſince ſhe was apprehenſive there was not any thing
there fit for him to eat; in ſhort, that it was a bad Dinner: <hi>Pox take
you for a B—,</hi> ſaid the Dean, <hi>why did you not get a better?
Sure you had Time enough! but ſince you ſay it is ſo bad, I'll e'en go
Home and eat a Herring.</hi> Accordingly he departed, and left her juſtly
confuſed at her Folly, which had ſpoilt all the Pains and Expence ſhe had
been at."</q>
            </p>
            <p>And here, if it will not be thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent in me, to intrude
into ſuch Company, I alſo have a Story, which I ſomewhere heard, not
unapplicable to the above.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0095100803:94"/>A certain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobleman, who had
the Honour to be ſent Embaſſador to <hi>France,</hi> was ſaid to be one
of the moſt polite accompliſhed fine Gentlemen in <hi>Europe.</hi> This
reached the Ears of the <hi>French</hi> King, who thought ſuch a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
due to none but himſelf; but as every thing is proved by Trial, his
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty took this Method of informing his Curioſity. One Morning that the
Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador had a private Audience, the King told him he ſhould be glad
of his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency's Company, to take an airing with him; the Ambaſſador
did not heſitate on accepting the Offer; but told his Majeſty, he was ready
to wait on him; the King's Chariot was at the Door, which he very careleſsly
deſired the Nobleman to ſtep into: <hi>No, Sir,</hi> replied the
Ambaſſador, <hi>not before your Majeſty</hi>; at which the King burſt
out a Laughing, and ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"No, no, my Lord, you are not the beſt bred Man
in the World; otherwiſe you would have done what I deſired, ſince you
might well know, that if it was not agreeable to me, I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver 
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0095100803:95"/> have paid you the Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</q>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed I have heard thoſe who ought to be the beſt Judges
of Manners, declare, that in Company with Superiors, to act implicitly
according to their Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is the moſt effectual Method of being always
acceptable; which leads me to another little Circumſtance related by Mrs.
<hi>Percival.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Lady, with a Company of very agreeable Perſons, reſolved
in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-time to take a Trip to the <hi>Hague</hi>; they accordingly
ſet out, and landed at ſome Place in <hi>Holland,</hi> the Name of which I
have now forgot: However, on their firſt Day's Journey, they ſtopp'd at an
Inn to dine, and enquired what they could have to eat; they were told there was
nothing in the Houſe but a Neck of Veal; which, tho' inſufficient, they
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be dreſſed, as there was not an Inn for ſome Miles forward;
therefore they made it up with ſome of their Sea Proviſions, which the
Servants had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately brought in. After Dinner they <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0095100803:96"/>
called a Bill, and amongſt other Articles of Extortion, they were charged for
Meat One Pound Four Shillings, which was ſo palpable an Impoſition, that
tho' each of the Company had Fortune and Liberality enough, yet they called for
the Man, and told him they abſolutely would not pay ſo extravagant a Price;
ſooner than which, as they came meerly for Pleaſure, they would ſtay a
Month and ſpend a hundred Pounds a Piece in Law; the Booriſh Fellow told
them that it was the common Price in this Place; which if they doubted, he was
willing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Magiſtrate. This they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily agreed to, and were
all preparing for a ſerious Trial of the Matter, when Minheer told them, in
an ironical Tone, that he was himſelf the Ruling-Officer and Diſpenſer of
Law and Juſtice in that Place. Finding this to be the Fact, and that the
Defendant muſt be the Judge in this Cauſe, the Plaintiffs thought proper to
ſubmit, and pay'd him.</p>
            <p>If the Reader thinks this little Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is not quite in Point;
which, now it is related, I begin to find out myſelf, <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0095100803:97"/> he
may blot it out of his Book if he pleaſes, but he ſhall not blot it out of
my Manuſcript, for that would be to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of a Page, that is worth a
Crown to me: Nay, and as it is <hi>Truth,</hi> who knows but it may prove worth
two Crowns to the Reader, if he ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to make the ſame Tour.</p>
            <p>My dear Mr. <hi>Cibber,</hi> to whom, for his Amuſement, I
uſed to relate ſuch little Incidents, would frequently admire what a Fund
of Matter for Entertainment my Brain contained, and he bad me write it all;
ſince, if it pleaſed him, it might poſſibly have the ſame Effect on
others. This Gentleman's frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the Great, gave him a
bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opportunity of knowing their Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (as he had infinite
Penetration) than moſt others: In Conſequence of which, he adviſed me,
when I ever had Occaſion to ſollicit a Favour from any Perſons of
Diſtinction, to take Care to Time it properly; for Inſtance, ſaid he,
"Never write to him or her, of a dark foggy froſty Morning; particularly
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Breakfaſt, at which Time it is Ten <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0095100803:98"/> to One, they
are out of Temper; nor though you ſend at any Time, and even received an
unmannerly Anſwer, do not let a raſh Pride drive you to return the Affront,
ſince it is impoſſible for you to know what at that Inſtant had
chagrin'd their Temper. He who will not be your Friend at one Time, may at
another; and tho' you never can bring him to do you any Service, yet do not
provoke him to be your Enemy; a Man may have had ill Succeſs at Play,
miſſed an Appointment with a fine Woman, or twenty ſuch Accidents; which
may for the preſent ſour his Diſpoſition; whereas if you continue your
Aſſiduities, in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Time he might do you more Service than you
could hope. Theſe are Truths which I have ſince experienced, and I ſhould
be wanting in Gratitude as well as Sincerity, if I did not make it publick.
Here follows an Inſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicholas Loftus Hume,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> whom I mentioned
in my ſecond Volume, that came to ſee me in <hi>London,</hi> but declined
ſubſcribing to me, becauſe he was going to the Duke of
<hi>Dorſel</hi>'s to Dinner, has <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0095100803:99"/> ſince my being in
this Kingdom, been kind enough to ſend me Five Guineas as a Subſcription;
for which I reſt his moſt obliged Servant.</p>
            <p>I remark'd to Mr. <hi>Cibber,</hi> upon this Converſation, that
though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility were outdone by none in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and
Liberality; yet I could by no Means conceive, that their Buildings were the
leaſt expreſſive of it; ſince there was ſcarcely one fine Houſe in
<hi>London,</hi> which was not obſcured by a monſtrous high Wall, that
intirely intercepted the Proſpect, and took much from the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence the
Streets might poſſibly have. He told me, it was the Method in
<hi>Italy,</hi> from whence our Peers, and others, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted it as a
great Beauty, becauſe the Surpriſe has a vaſt Effect. Sir, ſaid I, in
<hi>Italy</hi> thoſe Walls are requiſite, to keep off the extreme Heat of
the Sun; and if poſſible to ſhut out the Eye of God from their abominable
Pollutions; but as we enjoy a mild and temperate Region, and are I hope,
untainted with their beaſtly Vices, I ſee no Reaſon for our Peers to
affect it; there is beſides, generally at <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0095100803:100"/> theſe
Gates, a moſt avaricious Cerberus, who, ſhould a Stranger happen to ſtand
and gaze at any occaſion of the Gates being opened, would very judiciouſly
ſlap it in their Faces, as if our Eyes, like the Sphynx of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
could penetrate Stone Walls. If you have the ſmalleſt Suit to make to his
Maſter, the Fellow will be as dull of Apprehenſion as the Mock Doctor, till
you tip him the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; which when you have given him, he prevails on the
Valet to deliver it, which muſt alſo be accompanied by a Daub in the
Fiſt. I have computed the Expence of Writing to a Great Man, as under,

communicate, as I am perſuaded ſome of the Nobility of <hi>England,</hi>
will be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enough to read this Work, and I do aſſure them, nothing
ſo much dims their Luſtre, as the Arrogance and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury of their
Vaſſals; which, when they know, perhaps they may reclaim. Dean
<hi>Swift</hi> diſcharged a Servant only for rejecting the Petition of a poor
old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; ſhe was very ancient, and on a cold Morning, ſat at the Deanery
Steps a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Time, during which the Dean ſaw her through a Window,
and no doubt commiſerated her deſolate Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His Footman happened to
come to the Door, and the poor Creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him in a piteous Tone, to
give that Paper to his Reverence. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant read it, and told her with
infinite Scorn, his Maſter had ſomething elſe to mind than her Petition. 
<q rend="inline">"What's that you ſay, Fellow, ſaid the Dean,
look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out at the Window, come up here.'</q> 
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0095100803:102"/> The Man
trembling obey'd him: he alſo deſired the poor Woman to come before him,
made her ſit down, and ordered her ſome Bread and Wine; after which he
turned to the Man, and ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"At what time, Sir, did I order you to open a
Paper directed to me? or to refuſe a Letter from any one? Hark ye, Sirrah,
you have been admoniſh'd by me for Drunkenneſs, idling, and other Faults,
but ſince I have diſcovered your inhuman Diſpoſition, I muſt
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs you from my Service: So pull off my Cloaths, take your Wages, and
let me hear no more of you."</q>—The Fellow did ſo, and having vainly
ſollicited a Diſcharge, was compelled to go to Sea, where he continued five
Years; at the end of which time, finding that Life far different from the
Eaſe and Luxury of his former Occupation, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and humbly
confeſſing, in a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to the Dean, his former manifold Crimes; he
aſſured him of his ſincere Reformation, which the Dangers he had 
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0095100803:103"/> undergone at Sea, had happily wrought, and begg'd the
Dean would give him ſome Sort of Diſcharge, ſince the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of having
liv'd with him, would certainly procure him a Place. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, the Dean
call'd for Pen, Ink and Paper, and gave him a Diſmiſſion, with which, and
no other Fortune, he ſet out for London.</p>
            <p>Among others he applied to me, who had known him at his late
Maſter's, and produc'd his Certificate; which for its Singularity, I
tranſcribed, and believe it may not be diſpleaſing to the Reader.

my Eſcape, to viſit Mr. <hi>Cibber,</hi> and met, according to Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, a
very kind Reception: For his Friendſhip to me was inviolable. He was writing
the <hi>Character and Conduct of</hi> CICERO conſider'd; and did me the
Honour to read it to me: I was infinitely pleaſed to find, by the many lively
Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Wit in it, that the good Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Spirits were undepreſs'd
with Years;—Long may they continue ſo. This gave me an Opportunity of
writing a Poem to him, which <hi>W—e</hi> had the Confidence to aſk
from me; but I did not chuſe to compliment him with it: [The Editor has
applied to Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi> for a Copy of this Poem, but he having
diſpoſed of them all, we are obliged to omit it].</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi> was exceeding well pleas'd when I waited on
him with it, and ſaid, he would give it a Place, but that it wanted
Correction, which he promiſed to beſtow on it: This I readily agreed to,

            <p>I waited on him next Morning, and found he had greatly improved my

            <p>Well, Madam, ſaid he, there are two Guineas for your Flattery,

wander? Who <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0095100803:108"/> but the Almighty can account for them? I
went, when in <hi>London,</hi> to be electrified, when finding the Motion given
to a glaſs Globe not only made Sparks of Fire come out of my Arm, but alſo
ſet a Bowl of Sand under it a boiling, I could not help thinking, that the
Earth revolving each Day on its own Axis, muſt of courſe take Fire, as I
have ſeen a Chariot-wheel do: Our Globe may then become a Comet, and the
Inhabitants of others gaze on it with Surprize and Admiration. I think no
Philoſopher has yet been able to tell us, by all their mathematical Rules,
what Comets are. I have been told many Stars, which once adorn'd the blue
etherial Space, have diſappear'd; Worlds perhaps loſt in a Conflagration,
which no more fill the wide Expanſe.</p>

            <p>To all this noble Family my Reſpect and Gratitude are due; 'tis

may they flouriſh like the Cedars of <hi>Libanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return: I was now able to quit my Confinement; for
<hi>Worſdale</hi> made his Houſe a ſevere one to me: Oh how I rejoiced at
my Deliverance, and took a little decent Lodging; but my Joys were periſhable
as the baſeleſs Fabrick of a Viſion: Captain <hi>Meade,</hi> with whom I
mentioned my Son's going on the ſecret <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0095100803:113"/> Expedition, came
to tell me, that the Boy and he landed the Day before; that my Son was ſeized
with all the Symptoms of a violent Fever, and wanted to ſee me. I went to the
Captain's Lodgings, in <hi>Scotland-Yard,</hi> and found my poor Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
quite light-headed. The Captain ſent a Phyſician and a Surgeon to him, with
Orders to the Miſtreſs of the Houſe to provide for him whatever was
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and he would anſwer the Expence For many Days we deſpair'd
of his Life, till at length God's Mercy reſtor'd him to my Prayers and Tears.
When he came perfectly to himſelf he told me, they had been in a violent
Tempeſt, where, the Waves rolling Mountains high, he was wet to his Skin, and
the Ship in imminent Danger of being loſt: Captain <hi>Meade,</hi> he ſaid,
begged of God, that he might juſt ſee his Wife and Children, and then he
ſhould die without the ſmalleſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance; his Prayer was heard, the
Storm abated, and all got ſafe on Shore.</p>
            <p>As he was impatient to ſee his Family, he had left Directions
for my Son to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0095100803:114"/> him to <hi>Teddington,</hi> if it
pleaſed God he recover'd. As I knew nothing could be a greater Reſtorative,
after a Fit of Sickneſs, than a pure Air, I recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſovereign
Elixir to him: He went the Moment he was able, and ſent me the next Day the

               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0095100803:115"/>My Son's Prognoſtick happened to prove
true, the Captain expir'd about four the next Morning, of which the Boy was
firſt inform'd by the diſmal Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry of the Widow and Children. This
Woman's Character has ſomething in it ſo far ſurpaſſing any thing I
have yet met with, that I hope it may at once divert and inſtruct my Readers;
the Story is genuine.</p>
            <p>She was the Daughter of Mr. <hi>Wh—f—ld,</hi> of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> an ancient and honourable Family, many of whom had Seats
in Parliament; but it ſeems he had ſtray'd from the Wiſdom and Virtue of
his Anceſtors, and devoted himſelf intirely to <hi>Belial.</hi> Women and
Wine were all his Joy, till he broke his Lady's Heart: And, Oh ſtrange to
hear, ſhocking to human Nature! had the the Cruelty to attempt his Virgin
Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters! one of whom, to protect herſelf from ſuch devilliſh
Solicitations, ran away with his Coachman. 
<q>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0095100803:116"/> 
                  <l>She thought it neither Shame nor Sin,</l> 
                  <l>For <hi>John</hi> was come of honeſt Kin.</l> 
                  <bibl>Swift.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Heroine of our Story, being left alone, was ſo tormented by
his inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous infernal Fire, that ſhe fled to her younger Brother, who
was an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, and lived at <hi>W—d—r.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he was a Batchelor, he was very glad of her, to over-ſee his
domeſtick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which, I dare ſay, ſhe did very well, as ſhe was a
good Houſewife, eſpecially in the frugal Part of Management: It happened
another Apothecary fell in love with her, but nothing could prevail on her to
accept of him as a Huſband, tho' her Brother tried every Art he could to
perſuade her to it.</p>
            <p>Things were in this Situation when Captain <hi>Mead</hi> was
commanded on Duty to <hi>W—d—r,</hi> and as he had often been
there, was well acquainted with the Town, and as well eſteem'd: Miſs
<hi>Wh—f—d</hi> and her Brother, with ſome young Ladies, were
walking on the Terraſs, <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0095100803:117"/> when Captain <hi>Meade</hi>
accoſted them. They fell into Chat, and Mr. <hi>Wh—f—ld</hi>
invited the Captain to Supper; after which the young Lady retir'd.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wh—f—ld</hi> then acquainted the Captain with
his Siſter's obſtinate Refuſal of an advantageous Match. 
<q rend="inline">"She has,</q> ſaid he, 
<q rend="inline">"ſeem'd to pay a particular Deference to every
Word you ſpoke to-night, and, I am certain, if you undertake the Lover's
Cauſe, you will bring my Siſter to Reaſon."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Captain ſaid it would be too abrupt to pretend to adviſe a
Lady he had never ſeen before, in ſo delicate a Point as that of Matrimony,
wherein many Circumſtances ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, in order to a Union
firm and laſting. It may be, ſaid he, the young Lady's Heart is
pre-engaged; in that Caſe, how cruel would it be to force her into a hateful
Wedlock, the Conſequence of which is Miſery?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wh—f—ld</hi> then aſſured him, he had no
ſuch Intention, all he aimed at was her Happineſs: 
<q rend="inline">"Cultivate, added he, <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0095100803:118"/> a
Friendſhip with her; you may eaſily do it, and diſcover the true Cauſe
of her Averſion toward an honeſt good Man, who loves her, and is in
Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to maintain her in Eaſe and Plenty."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Mead</hi> promiſed all in his Power, and when, by
frequenting the Houſe, he had got into a little Intimacy with her, he in a
paternal Stile, when they were alone, expoſtulated with her, to no
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: She ſaid, ſhe was determined never to marry, as ſhe was
certain ſhe ſhould never have the Man ſhe only could love.</p>
            <p>He preſſed very hard to know who it was; aſſuring her of
his Friendſhip; and, at the ſame time, laying hold of her Hand, ſaid, he
muſt be inſenſible indeed, who did not, above all other Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
regard ſo much Tenderneſs and Beauty.</p>
            <p>He perceiv'd ſhe trembled, bluſh'd, and ſeem'd quite
confounded: 
<q rend="inline">"Would to God, Madam, ſaid he, that I was the
happy Occaſion of all thoſe tender Emotions which ſwell your fair
Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0095100803:119"/> how bleſt ſhould I think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?"</q>
And are you, ſaid ſhe, in a fault'ring Voice, are you in earneſt, or do
you only trifle with a Weakneſs, which your Penetration muſt have
obſerved, even from the firſt Moment I beheld you?</p>
            <p>Altho' this Declaration was very plain, yet it was ſo
unexpected, that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was for ſome Moments at a Loſs how to make a
ſuitable Return: But, recovering himſelf, he told her, Joy had made him
ſpeechleſs, but from that Hour he was intirely devoted to her for Life.</p>
            <p>He then aſk'd her in Marriage of her Brother, who abſolutely
refuſed her to him, on account of his being in the Army.</p>
            <p>But as the Lady was willing to be the kind Companion of his
Flight, he hired a Chariot and Six, and took her with him.</p>
            <p>This Story Captain <hi>Meade</hi> told me before her: Nor did
ſhe in the leaſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to deny it; but ſaid, ſhe had 
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0095100803:120"/> gain'd a good Huſband by her Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Indeed, while I was with them, they ſeemed to me perfect
Patterns of conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Love; but her Fondneſs ſeem'd to ſurpaſs all
things, for ſhe would kiſs her Husband's Linen, ſaying, they ſmelt of
Violets and Roſes; but truly, though I lov'd my dear Relation very well, I
was grown ſo delicate I did not like a <hi>dirty</hi> Shirt (for that was
ſometimes the Caſe) to be offered to me as a Noſegay.</p>
            <p>Her Piety was ſo great, that <hi>Whitſunday</hi> Morning, when
we were going to Church, which was near half a Mile from Captain
<hi>Meade</hi>'s Houſe, a young Lady called to us, to know, did the Bell
ring? Mrs. <hi>Meade</hi> anſwered, yes, but finding even the Church-yard
Door not open'd, ſhe ſaid, ſhe would not receive the Sacrament that
Morning: I aſked her, why ſhe ſhould not? Becauſe, ſaid ſhe, I have
told a Lye, in ſaying the Bell rang: I told her Scruple to Doctor
<hi>Hales</hi>; who join'd us, and preſently diſpelled her 
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0095100803:121"/> Fears, by aſſuring her, an innocent Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take could
never be deemed a Lye.</p>
            <p>Upon this we both ventured to receive the bleſſed Euchariſt,
adminiſtered to us by a truly holy Hand; for, aſſuredly, Doctor
<hi>Hales,</hi> yours is ſuch. And let no Perſon ſay, I do not reverence
the Clergy, for I really do; but not any one of them, who does not, as near as
Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity can go, aim at the Perfection of their Maker and Redeemer.</p>
            <p>As I have already related the Manner of Captain <hi>Meade</hi>'s
Death, let us ſee how his pious Widow behav'd herſelf on the Occaſion;
after having yell'd and ſcream'd to ſave Appearances, ſhe lock'd up his
Body, and had him next Day buried.</p>
            <p>She deſired my Son, who remained diſconſolate in the
Houſe, to go to the Tower, and bring home whatever of the Captain's was
there; but he being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive that, perhaps, on Account of his Youth, and
his not having a Line with him, they might be refuſed to him, begg'd of me to
accompany him; which, as I was truly deſirous of rendering any 
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0095100803:122"/> Service I could to his Family, I readily did. When we
arrived at his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, for the Officers keep one in every Place where
they are obliged to be on Guard, and told the Miſtreſs of the Houſe my
melancholly Errand, ſhe gave me the Keys of his Bureau, Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manteau, Trunk,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I took out his Regimentals, his Saſh, and many other things
appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, in which I had ſo often ſeen him array'd, I could not
refrain burſting into Tears, to think the dear Wearer of them was now no
more. Amongſt other things we found two Guineas, which was a ſeaſonable
Relief to the Widow. The Soldiers on Duty wept like Children at his Death's
ſad Story. My Son convey'd all things ſafe; but the Sight of them did not
take the ſame Effect on his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lict that they had done on me; for ſhe only
ſaid, ſhe was very glad to get them.</p>
            <p>My Boy, who colours Prints beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, was employed by Mr.
<hi>Millan,</hi> ſo that he was innocently and elegantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. 
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0095100803:123"/> The Sweets of getting Money made him doubly diligent;
and, to be quite undiſturbed, which it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he ſhould be
with me, ſo many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons coming for Letters, Petitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
he took a Lodging for himſelf. I was one Day exceedingly ſurpriſed when
the Penny-poſt brought a Letter, directed to my Son; as it was marked
<hi>Teddington</hi> I open'd it, judging it was ſome Buſineſs that Mrs.
<hi>Meade</hi> wanted to have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted; when, O ſhameful! it was a
Love-letter to the Child, who was but ſixteen Years of Age, and ſhe is four
Years older than I am, with a Direction to him to meet her at a Coffee-houſe
in <hi>London,</hi> and an Offer of Marriage to him.</p>
            <p>I really could ſcarce believe the true and credible Avouchment
of my own Eyes. Bleſs me! ſhe amaz'd me! yet, thinking this might be a
Counterfeit, I ſhew'd it to the Boy, and deſired he would go, and ſee
into this Matter, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us being acquainted with her Hand, which was a
deſperate bad one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0095100803:124"/>He went accordingly, and ſtay'd moſt
Part of the Evening abroad: When he return'd, he ſaid he had inquired after
her every-where, and could not learn any Tidings of her; ſo I conceived this
Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was either wrote by ſome Enemy of hers, or elſe for Sport, by
ſome of the Girls at <hi>Teddington,</hi> in order to ſend him on a
Wild-gooſe Chaſe.</p>
            <p>About ſix Weeks after the Captain's Death an Officer inquired
for me; as I did not know him I aſked, what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands he had for me? He
deſired to know of me, whether I was not a near Relation to Captain
<hi>Meade:</hi> To which, anſwering in the Affirmative, I deſired the
Gentleman to ſit, for he looked as if he had ſomething of Importance to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver. Pray, Madam, ſaid he, can you inform me what is become of the
Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Widow; my Reaſon for inquiring is this; a prior Wife has ſet up
a Claim to the Penſion, and produced a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, which we believe to be a
Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, as it is dated twenty Years ago, and 'tis but reaſonable to
think ſhe would, <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0095100803:125"/> in that time, have aſſerted her
juſt Rights. But this is not all, the Officers have made a Collection for the
Lady he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, and the Children: But there is a Report ſpread, that
ſhe is married to a Boy, young enough to be her Son, who was a Helper in the
Captain's Stable. This has damped the Charity of thoſe who, had ſhe even
been deceived by the Captain, would have aſſiſted her.</p>
            <p>I told him I had often heard the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain relate that, in his
younger Days, he got in a League with one Mrs. <hi>Meadows,</hi> who, after
having been divorced from her Huſband, ſet up a Coffee-houſe, where he
boarded and lodg'd: He found her in every Reſpect ſo unfaithful to him,
that he quitted her. Not long after ſhe broke; and, being in Diſtreſs,
applied to Captain <hi>Meads,</hi> who, in Conſideration of former
Friendſhip, agreed to give her annually 20 <hi>l.</hi> provided ſhe
retired; which ſhe agreed to.</p>
            <p>I can't, Sir, ſaid I, help thinking this is ſome Piece of her
Contrivance: 'Tis very poſſible, Madam, return'd he; and 
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0095100803:126"/> if you will be ſo kind to inquire into it, that
theſe Reports may be confuted, it will be of the utmoſt Conſequence
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the future Welfare of the Widow and Orphans of your deceaſed
Relation. I ſhall pay my Reſpects to you again in two or three Days. The
Gentleman left me, and, after a good deal of Search amongſt Mrs.
<hi>Meade</hi>'s Acquaintance, I learned ſhe lodged in the <hi>Strand.</hi>
There I went, and found her in a very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Lodging; the Children were
in deep Mourning, but Madam herſelf was deck'd out very gay. After
cuſtomary Compliments, I told her I was ſurpriſed to ſee her out of
Mourning: Why, <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan,</hi> for that was her manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, I
am married. What, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, return'd I, e'er the Man you ſeem'd to doat on,
even to Extravagance, is cold in his Grave. Cold, ſays ſhe, aye, he's cold
enough, and rotten too, by this time. May be you made him ſo before Death.
Why ſhould you think ſo? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſeem to have thrown of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Decency: And is this all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0095100803:127"/> you pay to ſo
good a Huſband? In anſwer to this, and to my great Surprize, ſhe
aſſured me, ſhe never was married to the Captain in her Life.</p>
            <p>Here was Hypocriſy! (that ſly Fiend who 'ſcapes all but the
piercing Eye of GOD) in its utmoſt Perfection; if one may make uſe of
ſuch an Epithet to ſuch a deviliſh Sin. To live in Fornication, yet go to
the Communion without the leaſt Purpoſe of Amendment of Life, and to
pretend ſuch ſtrong Affection to a Man, whoſe very Memory ſhe ſhewed
ſhe hated; I ſhall ever after this ſuſpect the Sincerity of ſuch an
over-acted Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>I told her my Errand, and that I was really ſorry ſhe had put
it out of my Power to vindicate her Conduct; which, cut of Regard to the poor
Children, I would gladly have done. She told me, Doctor <hi>Hales</hi> approved
of her Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and ſo ſhe did not care what I thought. Though I am
certain this muſt have been falſe, for the Doctor had ſuch high Notions
of conjugal Fidelity, that <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0095100803:128"/> he was true to the
<hi>Aſhes</hi> of his Spouſe, whom he loſt when he was but a very young
Man, and having an agreeable Perſon, a ſweet Temper, and unbounded
Learning, might no Doubt have raiſed his Fortune by a ſecond Marriage.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other Inſtances of her Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, this Woman uſed
to pretend, that even ſmall Beer got into her Head, and would ſeverely
cenſure any Lady who drank a Glaſs of Wine; yet now, though it was but nine
o' Clock in the Morning ſhe called for a Dram, drank it off, and would have
had me follow her Example, but I had no Inclination to ſuch a Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt:
Beſides, having no other Eſtate but my Head, on which were hourly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
it was by no other means my Intereſt to deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>I took my Leave; and, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated this to my Son, the Boy
laughed exceſſively; and, as he then had no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Reſpect for her,
he told me, he had gone to her according to her Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; that ſhe had
treated him with two Bottles of Mountain, and preſs'd: <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0095100803:129"/>
him hard to marry her: Indeed I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, when he came home, I ſaw he had
been drinking, but he ſaid ſome young Gentlemen of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whom
he met, gave him a Bottle of Wine.</p>
            <p>However, ſome time after, ſhe made him pay for his Liquor, for
ſhe opened a Punch-houſe, which I believe ſhe ſtill keeps, at leaſt
ſhe did when I left <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; ſhe wrote a Letter to my Son, to
deſire to ſee him; accordingly he went; and Madam Temperance carried him
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Dining-room, and ordered her Husband, who ſerved in Quality of
Waiter, to bring up a Bowl of Arrack-Punch, and half a Dozen Glaſſes of
Jelly. The Boy was well pleaſed with this ſumptuous Fare; but when the good
Chear was ended, ſhe demanded Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he was obliged to part with his
Week's Earning, which he had juſt received. What could the moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
Proſtitute have done worſe?</p>
            <p>But I believe ſhe is ſufficiently pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, for I was well
aſſured the Groom <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0095100803:130"/> took the Liberty of correcting
her, and no-body pitied her.</p>
            <p>I think the Philoſopher was in the wrong who wiſhed for
Windows in the human Breaſt; how miſerable muſt we have been, when we
beheld thoſe whom we eſteem'd Friends, under ſpecious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
plotting our Deſtruction; the Object of our Love, even in the midſt of
well-feign'd Rapture, wiſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Arms of another: The Son
who bows his Knee in filial Reverence to his hoary Sire, curſing the Gout,
Pitargo, and the Rheum, for ending him no ſooner. In ſhort, the Scenes
would be too ſhocking; they would quite imbite Life.</p>
            <p>Thoſe philoſophical Gentlemen, who have ſearched into the
Secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have admired the Wiſdom of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in kindly
concealing from us many things, which known, would make us wretched: I am
ſure it was well for poor Captain <hi>Meade</hi> this Woman's Breaſt was
not tranſparent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0095100803:131"/>They have farther obſerved, that were our
Perceptions ſtronger than they are, the Senſes, which convey Pleaſure to
us, would become the Inſtruments of intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Pain. 
<q> 
                  <l>The Touch, if tremblingly alive all o'er,</l> 
                  <l>Would ſmart and agonize at ev'ry Pore.</l> 
                  <l>Or quick Effluvia darted to the Brain,</l> 
                  <l>Die of a Roſe, in aromatic Pain.</l> 
                  <l>Shou'd Nature thunder in our open'd Ears,</l> 
                  <l>And ſtun us with the Muſic of the Spheres,</l> 
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Pope</hi>'s Eſſay on Man.</bibl>
               </q> How terrible
muſt be our Condition?</p>
            <p>Moſt married Perſons, even in the happieſt Wedlock, which
is, at beſt, but tolerable, look back with ſecret Regret on the ſweet
Hours of Freedom, when no Anxiety reign'd, ſuch as the Care of a Family, the
Sickneſs, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of Children, the total Loſs of them, and a
thouſand Troubles which perplex the married Life; and yet no 
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0095100803:132"/> ſooner are they ſingle, but they run into the ſame
Toils again, hardly affording time for a decent Mourning: Strange In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation!
In which, I think, the Ladies more excuſable than the Men, ſince their
Weakneſs may make them want a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector; yet they who can have Reſolution
enough to know no ſecond Bride-bed but the Grave, certainly claim a higher
Degree of Reſpect and Veneration.</p>
            <p>In this aimable Light ſhines the preſent Lady Dowager
<hi>Meade,</hi> who, tho' left a Widow, in the Bloom of her Youth and Beauty,
the Widow of a Gentleman old enough to be her Father, who loſt her ſole
Guardian to their Offſpring, turn'd all her Thoughts to the Improvement of
her Childrens Minds, and Fortunes, in both of which Heaven crown'd her
Goodneſs with Succeſs, and the World with Honour.</p>
            <p>I could mention another great Lady, not unallied to her, who
though ſhe has many Virtues, as I have acknowledged in my firſt Volume,
being left exactly in the ſame Situation, was ſo faithful a 
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0095100803:133"/> Steward for her Son, that with his Rents, which ſhe
received during his Minority, ſhe purchaſed an Eſtate for herſelf; a
thouſand Pounds a Year Jointure not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient for her, neither
would ſhe ever come to any Account with him for the Produce of his Eſtate.
The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had too high a Senſe of filial Piety to commence any Suit in
Law againſt his Mother, though ſhe was married to a ſecond Husband, much
younger than her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and has been 
<q> 
                  <l>Like to a Step-dame, or a Dowager,</l> 
                  <l>"Long withering out a young Man's Revenue."</l> 
                  <bibl>Shakeſpear.</bibl>

            </p>
            <p>I am ſure, Mr. <hi>Pilkington,</hi> I pray heartily for your
Life, leſt I ſhould ever be ſuch a Fool as to engage in new Scenes of
Trouble; for if I could not keep your Heart, properly due to me, at a Time when
the flattering World called me agreeable, 
<q>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0095100803:134"/> 
                  <l>Much leſs would my declining Age,</l> 
                  <l>A ſecond Husband's Love engage;</l> 
                  <l>Nor from the Dregs of Life could I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</l> 
                  <l>What the firſt ſprightly Running could not

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And now, to convince you, that I bear no Malice to you, I will
tell you an authentic Truth, true as the Goſpel; for one Truth is, even by
mathematical Demonſtration, adequate to another.</p>
            <p>I was, ſince I came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> invited to a Widower's
Houſe to Dinner: As his Buſineſs called him out, he had left Orders for
my Reception; your youngeſt Son was with me, and we were ſhewn into a
Parlour, where a Gentleman ſat reading my firſt Volume. I did not
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt him, as he ſeem'd to be deeply engaged. The Maſter of the
Houſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and ſaying, 
<q rend="inline">"Mrs. <hi>Pilkington,</hi> I am very glad to ſee
you, and your Son;"</q> made the Gentleman look at us attentively: After
Dinner, he told us, he had a Bond and Judgment entered on <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0095100803:135"/> it againſt you, at the Suit of Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> the Brewer;
that hitherto he had been compaſſionate, ſuppoſing us to be ſuch

convinced of my Error, I ſhall ſhew him no farther Mercy: My Boy ſtarting

            <p>Mr <hi>Edward</hi> ſeem'd ſurpriſed, as judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no doubt,
we ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in your Calamity, as you had done in ours; yet being
of a generous, humane Diſpoſition, he was touch'd with our Sorrows, and
granted that Liberty you now enjoy to our Interceſſion: You know the

            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0095100803:136"/>Upon my Word, I muſt contradict the witty
Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> who ſays, 
<q> 
                  <l>Heaven has no Rage, like Love to Hatred turn'd,</l> 
                  <l>Nor Hell a Fury like a Woman ſcorn'd.</l>
               </q> For I do not
hate you. I am in an Apathy, a cool Suſpence from Pleaſure, and from Pain,
both of which I muſt acknowledge I received from you; but that was when you
wrote in my Praiſe; and, at the very ſame time, ſaid every thing
diſagreeable to me: Was not this done to deceive the World? 
<q rend="inline">"I will make them believe I love her; and, as

            </p>
            <p>I can't indeed ſay, but Miſs <hi>S—d—s</hi>'s
Father owed a Favour to Mr. <hi>Pilkington,</hi> who kindly taking
Compaſſion on his Neceſſities, when his Lady was not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with
his keeping a Miſtreſs in the <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0095100803:137"/> Houſe with her, and
inſiſted on her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſmiſs'd: Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> ever hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
received her to his Habitation with open Arms, gave the old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man free
Ingreſs and Egreſs, for which he gratefully permitted the Parſon to go to
bed to his Daughter; indeed I ſhould have pitied her, had ſhe been deceived
by the Report of my Death, ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſpread, into Marriage; but
ſhe had it under my own Hand, that I was living, for I did the Creature the
Honour, S—t as ſhe is, to write to her, in order to prevent her being
impoſed on. I think the Form of Matrimony really wants an Explanation, if we
go according to the ſtrict Letter of the Law. What a happy State muſt a
young Woman imagine her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf entering into, where ſhe is to be lov'd,
honour'd, cheriſh'd, nay, even worſhipped; ſhe has a Protector till the
Hour of Death, who is to forſake all, even his Parents, for her, if it be
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, who endows her with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and promiſes all this ſolemnly
at the Altar.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0095100803:138"/>Then follow the Words, <hi>Thoſe whom</hi>
GOD <hi>hath joined, let no Man put aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us ſee how this is really to be interpreted, at leaſt
how far this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is uſually kept.</p>
            <p>No ſooner is the Honey-moon expir'd but the fawning Servant
turns a haughty Lord: Inſtead of honouring his Wife, 'tis Odds if he treats
her with common Civility; he ſhall tell her, to her Face, he wiſhes her
Death, in order to marry another. The Cuſtom authorizes this free way of
ſpeaking; yet I never knew it agreeable to any Wife, nor did I ever doubt but
the Huſband ſpoke in the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his Heart.</p>
            <p>As for our being endow'd with the worldly Goods of our Husbands,
'tis known they are ſo little apt to ſhare with us, that it has always been
found neceſſary, in a Marriage-Settlement, to ſtipulate for Pin-money, a
very uſeful Clauſe even to the Husband, and it is much better his Wife
ſhould have a Share of his Fortune, than be obliged to a 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0095100803:139"/> Gallant for a Trifle, which Gratitude may make her repay
in too tender a manner.</p>
            <p>Indeed the laſt Article againſt Divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I intirely
diſapprove of; and am glad it has ſeem'd good to the Wiſdom of the Church
to act in direct Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to it: This has made Numbers eaſy, and, as
they tell us, 'tis not lawful to ſeparate on any Cauſe, ſave that of

I'll tell him a Story.</p>
            <p>The Counteſs of <hi>Eglantine,</hi> one of the greateſt

no other <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0095100803:140"/> Cauſe but having brought him ſeven
Daughters, all charming as this fair Northern Laſs, and never a Son: On this
his Lordſhip aſſured her, he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſue for a Divorce. The
Lady told him, ſhe would readily agree to a Separation, provided he gave her
back what he had with her. He, ſuppoſing ſhe meant pecuniary Affairs,
aſſured her ſhe ſhould have her Fortune to the laſt Penny. Nay, nay,
my Lord, ſaid ſhe, 
<q rend="inline">"that winna do; return me my Youth, Beauty, and
Virginity, and diſmiſs me as ſoon as you pleaſe:"</q> His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
being unable to anſwer this Demand, ſpoke no more of parting with his Lady,
and, e'er the Year expired, ſhe made him the glad Father of a lovely Boy,
whoſe Birth reſtored Love and Harmony to his noble Parents. This was
related to me by the late Lord <hi>Primroſe</hi>; and therefore I believe
it.</p>
            <p>But now, Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> tho' I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented you with this

Years he had ſpent in attaining it; the Fellow being willing to inhance his
own Merit, aſſured the Monarch he had ſpent thirty Years in it; on which
the Emperor ordered him thirty Baſtinadoes on the Soals of his Feet, for
having ſo much miſſpent his Time.</p>
            <p>And, my dear Huſband, if you have your Deſert, you merit
juſt ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for miſapplying Time in Trifles. 
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0095100803:144"/> Writing one good Sermon, or uſeful Book, both of which
when I knew you, you were as capable of as moſt young Men, would have tended
more to your Reputation, than any merely mechanical Art.</p>
            <p>But in ſhort, I ſincerely pity you, and if ever you want a
Shilling, let me but know it, and if I have the good Fortune to have a Guinea
Subſcription, for Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ſeldom ſend me any ſmaller Coin, you
ſhall not go without one.</p>
            <p>The dignified Clergy indeed have been niggardly to me. Yet not
againſt them all do I bring this Accuſation, many of them have even a
bleeding Humanity for the Diſtreſſes of their Fellow Creatures; and have
not only pitied, but aſſiſted me; and while I can in that noble Liſt
inroll the ſacred Names of <hi>Berkley</hi> and <hi>Delany,</hi> Patterns of
Virtue in their Lives, really apoſtolick in their Doctrine, winning
ſtraying Souls with Goodneſs and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, learned as far as Humanity can
ſoar; ſurely no other of the Clergy need ſend me a Meſſage when they
ſubſcribe, not to <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0095100803:145"/> divulge ſo terrible a Secret: I
always in this Caſe judge there is more Fear than Charity in their
Contributions. But here I muſt remember a certain croſs Dean, to whom, as
my Father was Phyſician, I took the Liberty of applying. My Son went with the
Letter; he came out, and cried, "Boy, opening his ponderous and toothleſs
Jaws, what do you want? An Anſwer, Sir, ſaid he; why, then my Anſwer is,
I won't. My Son proteſted he was quite ſtartled at his ferocious Features
and ſtentorian Voice. Yet, after all, we laugh'd away our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, as he
was really not worth it.</p>
            <p>This admirable Orator ought to have a larger Roſtrum than the
narrow Limits of a Pulpit to diſplay his graceful Action, and never-enough to
be admired Grimace. A Theatre would ſuit his Genius; a Puppet one I mean,
where glorious Punch himſelf muſt yield the Prize.</p>
            <p>I remember once to have ſeen this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Flamen, in his
lengthened Dreſs, aſcend St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Pulpit; where, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0095100803:146"/> the enormous Iniquities of the Congregation, he of
ſudden gave ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Toſs to his Head, like a metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Horſe
hard rein'd, that back fell his Wig and down flew his Sermon; which not being
well ſecured, fluttered in nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Leaves about the Church, ſcattered
like the Ungodly, as Chaff before the Wind; the Sleepers awoke, the old Men who
dream'd Dreams, and the Virgins who ſaw Viſions, ſtarted from their
dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Trance; and he, willing at leaſt, to give us his Benediction, cried
aloud, 
<q rend="inline">"Depart ye curſed into everlaſting Fire, which
that ye may all do, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>The late Lady <hi>Rawden,</hi> not long after ſhe became a
Widow, invited the Dean as her Pariſh Miniſter, to Dinner; the Lady went to
take the Air, and Sir <hi>John,</hi> then a Child, was in the Parlour; the Dean
fell into Chat with the ſweet Boy, and amongſt other Queſtions ſaid, do
you know me? No, Sir; why I am Dean C—, your Pariſh Miniſter. Poor
Maſter innocently verified the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0095100803:147"/> that
Children ſpeak Truth, for he cried out, O indeed, I heard my Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma ſay,
you were the worſt Preacher in <hi>Dublin:</hi> His Reverence's Wrath was
hereupon ſo rais'd, that he failed not to reproach the Lady, who, to pacify
him, corrected the poor Child: However, ſhe could not avoid relating the
Story; which I heard from Lady <hi>Rawden,</hi> at Mrs. <hi>Percival</hi>'s, to
the infinite Laughter of the Auditors, and which I from henceforth conſign to
Fame in theſe my immortal Labours.</p>
            <p>I was much obliged to Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in
<hi>London,</hi> which I gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. But there is one great Man I
cannot paſs over; great, according to Serjeant <hi>Kite</hi>'s Definition of
one, for he is full ſix Foot high; his Fortune rais'd from the noble Spirit
of Malt; for I do remember, like Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> that poor Creature's
Small-Beer, which his Father ſold to mine; and from the golden Grains aroſe
a princely Fortune; from the humbly Dray appeared a Coach, ſuch as
Ambaſſadors uſe when on public <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0095100803:148"/> Occaſions, they
by their State give us a Picture of the Grandeur of the Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate they
repreſent. 
<q> 
                  <l>For if the Man ſuch Honour have,</l> 
                  <l>What muſt be his, who keeps the Knave?</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Not that I would hence infer all Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to be Rogues,
farther than ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little for the Good of their King and Country.</p>
            <p>It was this worthy Gentleman who told them at <hi>White</hi>'s
that I had nothing to publiſh: I had quick Intelligence of his Favour; after
which Obligation he came to viſit me, and would have been very kind to me
becauſe I was a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a Perſon he could depend on; and he was then
in Diſtreſs, being at a Diſtance from his Lady and native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; to be
ſure I ought to have been cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, but that I always ſtood in the Way
of my own Preferment; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlucky Circumſtance for my Swain was,
that I remembered the deplorable <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0095100803:149"/> Condition to which he
reduced his firſt Wife, who died of his Love, as did alſo his Child, the
Nurſe it was given to, and her Huſband. Noble Atchievements worthy of your
illuſtrious Birth and Lineage. For, 
<q> 
                  <l>'Tis you can taint the ſweeteſt Joy,</l> 
                  <l>And in the Shape of Love deſtroy.</l>
               </q> However, I
ſhould have paſs'd you over in Silence, but that you told a Nobleman here,
I had been quite compliant to your Deſire: Why then you prove yourſelf a
generous Lover, in ſending me Five Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Shillings for a Book. A
wondrous Bounty really; why your Neighbour the B— always pays a Moidore
Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for Adultery; and ſure you ought to give more than a Man, who by
the Power committed to him from above, is entitled to give himſelf
Abſolution.</p>
            <p>Your hoary canting Sire was a Votary to <hi>Venus,</hi> even in
old Age. When a certain Widow, and her dancing Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lodged at
<hi>Glaſnevin,</hi> a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0095100803:150"/> who was much
enamoured of the younger Dame, uſed to viſit her every Evening; as he did
not care to have it known, he went in thro' a low Window to Miſs's
Bedchamber: It happened that Miſs being abroad, the venerable Pair made
Choice of that Place, to indulge the gentler Paſſions: The young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
came according to Cuſtom, and without Ceremony threw up the Saſh, flew in,
and unfortunately ſtarted from their downy Couch the reverend Elder and the
chaſte Matron.</p>
            <p>Miſs following her Mother's Example, reſigned her Virgin
Charms to you, and loſt at once her Health and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>This might have been my unhappy Lot; but that however careleſs I
have been about Reputation, I was always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to put my own precious
Perſon into any Peril.</p>
            <p>Now ſays my Reader, if he be a Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how this prating old
Woman, who certainly never had any Temptation, boaſts of Chaſtity: Ay, 'tis
no Matter, I <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0095100803:151"/> have had ſo many amorous Epiſtles,
Odes, Songs, Anacreonticks, Saphics, Lyricks, and Pindaricks, in Praiſe of my
Mind and Perſon too, ſent to me ſince I came to <hi>Ireland</hi>; that I
believe ſome Gentlemen, tho' I cannot, have found me out to be a marvellous
proper Woman. 
<q> 
                  <l>I'll get my Room hung round with Looking-Glaſſes,</l> 
                  <l>And entertain a ſcore or two of Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors;</l> 
                  <l>And ſtudy Faſhions to adorn my Body.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And ſome time or other, as I find it is the Mode in
<hi>London,</hi> for the Ladies to publiſh the Triumphs of their Eyes, and
how many Men fell a Prey to their Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury; or, as Dr. <hi>Young</hi> ſays, 
<q> 
                  <l>Had ever Nymph ſuch Reaſon to be glad?</l> 
                  <l>In Duel fell three Lovers, two ran mad.</l>
               </q> 
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0095100803:152"/> Though I cannot indeed produce ſuch dreadful Proofs of
my Beauty as ſome of them; nor chuſe I to have my Print ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited before
my Work, but Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Authors with Regard to it, I hope I may be
allowed. The ſame Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſhews in the Vindication of his
Wit, Learning and Humanity may be pardoned in a Female, in the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of
that far nobler Part, external Lovelineſs; for a Mind in a Woman is of little
Conſequence. Dr. <hi>Young</hi> ſeems of a different Mind; but great
Authors ſometimes vary: As it is now my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to be of his Side the
Queſtion, I ſhall give his Opinion, and who knows if it ſhould chance to
be true, but my Admirers may be real ones. 
<q> 
                  <l>What's Female Beauty but an Air divine,</l> 
                  <l>Thro' which the Mind's all gentle Graces ſhine;</l> 
                  <l>They like the Sun irradiate all between,</l> 
                  <l>The Body charms, becauſe the Soul is ſeen.</l> 
                  <l>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0095100803:153"/>Hence ſome we ſee are Captives of a
Face,</l> 
                  <l>They know not why, of no peculiar Grace.</l>
               </q> And ſo much
for what I never had, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept according to his Judgment. There as a Proof of my
Humility, I put in my Claim, and will, like 
<note n="*" place="bottom">See Zenophon's
Banquet.</note>
               <hi>Socrates,</hi> diſpute the Prize even with
<hi>Alcibiades.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I have mentioned this ſmall but inimitable well wrote Book,
which was recommended to me by Dr. <hi>Swift,</hi> and which I in return
commend to all ſuch of my fair Readers as have a Taſte for real Wit, in
which the divine <hi>Socrates</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly ſhone, as he did in
Purity of Life and Conſtancy in Martyrdom; that they peruſe it with Care,
as it will refine their Ideas and improve their Judgments, poliſh their
Stile, ſhew them true Beauty, and lead them gently and agreeably to its 
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0095100803:154"/> prime Origin and Source; here they will find 
<q> 
                  <l>Divine Philoſophy,</l> 
                  <l>Not ſo harſh and rugged as ſome falſely think,</l> 
                  <l>But muſical as is <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Lute;</l> 
                  <l>And a perpetual Feaſt of nectar'd Sweets,</l> 
                  <l>Where no crude Surfeit reigns.</l> 
                  <bibl>Milton.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt here obſerve in my tracing Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors thro' each other,
<hi>Zenophon</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> borrowed from <hi>Socrates,</hi> whoſe
Diſciples they were. <hi>Zenophon</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges it as freely as I do the
Inſtructions I received from Dr. <hi>Swift.</hi> Lord <hi>Shaftſ:
bury</hi>'s Search after Beauty, is copied from <hi>Socrates</hi>; Mr.
<hi>Pope</hi>'s Ethics ſtolen from both; and the learned Mr.
<hi>Hutcheſon</hi>'s Beauty and Harmony, an Imitation of the great
Philoſophers and excellent Moraliſts firſt mentioned.</p>
            <p>Had Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> ſtop'd at this Book, by which he
had acquired ſome Degree of Reputation, both as a Writer, a Divine, 
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0095100803:155"/> and a Mathematician, he had done wiſely; but O! his
Eſſay on the Paſſions over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned his ſcarce eſtabliſhed
Praiſe; if it has any Meaning, it is like dark veil'd <hi>Cotyto,</hi> in her
Ebon Chair, cloſe curtained round, impenetrably obſcure, or from his
Flames, 
<q> 
                  <l>No Light, but rather Darkneſs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</l>
               </q> I really
thought it was the Defect of my Head that made me not comprehend this Piece,
till I heard the preſent Lord Biſhop of <hi>Elphin,</hi> whoſe Learning
or Judgment were never yet doubted, declare he did not underſtand it. After
all, whether the Defect lay in the Book or the B—p let the Reader
determine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wollaſton</hi>'s Religion of Nature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated, tho'
frequently intermingled with Mathematical Proofs, is yet ſo plain, that it
demonſtrates the Author's Thoughts clearly; which whoever does, can never
fail to write with equal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity. But Learning ſeems encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered 
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0095100803:156"/> with Words or technical Terms ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying nothing; and
our Schoolmaſters, leſt our Children ſhould attain it too ſoon if they
ſhould lead them to the Fountain from whence the Streams of Knowledge flow
copious to quench or rather to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe that Deſire of it which we
obſerve from their firſt prattling Infancy, chuſe rather to make them
begin at the Bottom of ſome Rivulet, from whence, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Difficulty,
when they have waded about half Way, they are obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire by the Command
of another, then begin at another, till wearied they give over, and hate the
fruitleſs, endleſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Toil. I believe that formerly they had a
better Method of inſtructing than what is now practiſed. I judge this by
the Eloquence ſhewn by the Youth of thoſe Ages, and the beautiful Pieces of
Poetry ſtill extant, ſome of them ſtiled the minor Poets; perhaps to
diſtinguiſh them from the venerable Antients, or on Account of the juvenile
Years of the Authors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0095100803:157"/>Perhaps Nature in her prime Creation was
productive of more Strength and Beauty even in the Mind, than at this Time,
when Luxury and Exceſs pull down our ros'd-cheek'd Youth, emaciate their
Bodies, and enervate their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings; for Mind and Body are ſo
cloſely united, that whatever affects the one, muſt of Conſequence affect
the other.</p>
            <p>I hope my Reader will pardon my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the Works of
thoſe valuable Writers I have mentioned, for I mean no Diſreſpect to
their ſacred Memories; but as I am accuſed of being a Plagiary my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
which I own I am; my Intention is to prove all Writers to be Thieves as well as
their humble Servant, <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> alone excepted.</p>
            <p>Some of my learned Correſpondents ſend me Word I do not write
theſe my own Memoirs; why I fancy were I to publiſh their Epiſtles, the
World would not believe that any of them were my Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants; but their
Modeſty makes them <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0095100803:158"/> conceal their Names, and I have no
Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to diſcover them.</p>
            <q> 
               <l>With ſuch all Authors ſteal their Works or buy,</l> 
               <l>
                  <hi>Garth</hi> did not write his own Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</l> 
               <bibl>Pope.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>But Authors are a little too fond of Fame to let any one run away
with it from them, or a tolerable Performance paſs for the Work of another; I
ſpeak from Experience; I have wrote for Num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers, and do ſtill, but no
Human Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ever helped me out with a ſingle Line; if they did let it
appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and my Writings be torn to Fragments, or condemned to
Flames.</p>
            <p>And talking of burning, puts me in mind of dear Lord
<hi>Kingsborough,</hi> who becauſe he ſaw that I endeavour'd to do but
barely Juſtice to his inimitable Pen, bid me burn all his Letters, upon which

               </q> But, perhaps all
things are ordered for the beſt, on which Hope, I relate what I know to be
Truth.</p>
            <p>A Captain of a Man of War took a Fancy to deſpiſe his Wife,
and engage with another Woman: The Wife took it patiently, till at laſt he
had the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to tell her, he would either bring his Harlot to live with
her, or ſhe and his three Children ſhould turn out: The Lady was confounded
at ſo ſtrange a Propoſal, and begg'd three Days time to conſider of it;
and then ſhe would give him a determinate Anſwer: He agreed: She told her
Affliction to a Friend, and begg'd her Advice; on which they reſolved to
conſult Doctor <hi>Potter,</hi> late Lord Archbiſhop of
<hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury:</hi> Accordingly they took a Boat, and went to
<hi>Lambeth</hi>: The good Prelate propoſed an Invocation to the Almighty 
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0095100803:163"/> to direct their Counſels: After Prayers he deſired
the Lady not, by any means, to quit her Houſe, but to acquieſce in her
Husband's Deſire, and let him bring the Woman home; and, depend on it, ſaid
he, God will aſſiſt you, and what at preſent appears an Evil, will turn
out a Bleſſing to you: So, giving them his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, they departed full
of Hope of an happy Iſſue.</p>
            <p>The Husband, who flatter'd himſelf that the Wife would quit the
Houſe, was not a little aſtoniſh'd to find her quite ſubmiſſive to
his Commands, and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to live with his Miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he ordered his Chariot, bade his Wife prepare Dinner,
and went for his Harlot, whom he brought home triumphant, and handed into the
Dining-room; the Wife received her with a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility that confounded and enraged
her; ſhe brought her a Glaſs of <hi>Lisbon</hi> Wine, and then left her
with the Captain, who, in a few Minutes came down, and ſeeing all things
ready for Dinner, ordered his Wife to go and bring the Lady down: 
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0095100803:164"/> She obey'd, but Madam called her a hundred Names, flew
at the Captain, beat him, and put herſelf in ſuch a Rage, that ſhe fell
into Fits, was ſeiz'd with a Fever, and died.</p>
            <p>After this Cataſtrophe, the Captain ſeriouſly reflecting on
the Submiſſion and Virtue of his Wife, thus addreſs'd her: My Dear, if I
thought there was a Poſſibility of your pardoning my paſt Errors, and
never reproaching me with them, I do aſſure you, I wou'd never fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them again, but make a faithful tender Huſband to you. The Lady burſt into
joyful Tears at this happy Change, and kindly aſſured him, ſhe would
never even think of what was paſt: She told him it was by the Archbiſhop's
Advice ſhe had acted with the Moderation ſhe now found to be ſo happy in
the Event; and they both went to thank the venerable Prelate, who truly partook
in their Joy. The Captain died about a Year after, and left his whole Fortune
to his Lady, who lives an honourable Widow at <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0095100803:165"/>Thus we may ſee, if we perſevere in our
Duty, the Almighty is not ſlow to hear, nor reward;

            <p>I was told a pretty Circumſtance of his Grace, when he was at
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> School: It ſeems he ſtood terribly in awe of the
Rod, and having committed ſome Miſtake that deſerved Chaſtiſement,
which Doctor <hi>Busby</hi> was very liberal in beſtowing, he was ready to
die with the Apprehenſion of it; when a good bold-ſpirited Lad, taking
Compaſſion on him, own'd the Fault, and took the Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for which his
timid Friend pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be grateful, if ever it came in his way to ſerve
him: They both took holy Orders, but met not till many Years after, when his
Grace was an Archbiſhop, his Friend remained a Curate; but Time, which brings
all things about, ſo order'd it, that the Archbiſhop and the Curate 
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0095100803:166"/> met at a Nobleman's Houſe: His Grace, hearing him
named, recollected both the Gentleman, the Whipping, and his own Promiſe of
Gratitude; and finding the Curate had no Preferment, he gave him a very good
Living.</p>
            <p>I hope theſe Incidents will not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to my

more than moſt of our modern Memorialiſts can ſay, who preſent us with
Heaps of Improbabilities, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect implicit Faith from us; and if what
ſome of them have told us be genuine, though it may redound to their Profit,
it never can to their Honour; for their Actions are neither worthy being

aſſured no Part of my Work can be half ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or entertaining to
the Publick, as that which relates to him, I ſhall, as far as in my Power,
preſent them with his lively Portraiture. The moſt minute Circumſtances
relating to ſo great a Man cannot, I hope, be deem'd trivial; ſince we find
by Experience, that the Night-Scene, ſo beautifully drawn by
<hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> between <hi>Brutus</hi> and his Domeſticks, ſleeping
in his Tent, the little Incident of his taking the Lute out of the Boy's Hand,
and ſaying, when he fell aſleep,

            <p>Do we not love him more in this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able View of him, than in all
his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts; or that ſad Act whereby he thought to give his Country
Liberty? The World are ſufficiently acquainted with the Dean's publick
Character, be it then my Taſk to trace him in private Life; for there only it
is we can frame a true Judgment of any Perſon, the reſt is frequently mere
Outſide.</p>
            <p>When the Dean was at <hi>Bellcamp,</hi> at the Houſe of the
Reverend Doctor <hi>Grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> he wrote to Doctor <hi>Delany,</hi> to come
and dine with him, mighty <hi>Thomas Thumb,</hi> and her ſerene Highneſs of
<hi>Lilly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put,</hi> meaning my Husband and me: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we went; the Dean
came out <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0095100803:169"/> to meet us, and I, by Agreement, hiding my
Face, Mr. <hi>Pilkington</hi> told him they had picked up a Girl on the Road,
and deſired to know whether they might bring her in? He, gueſſing who it
was, ſaid, let her ſhew her Face, and if ſhe be likely, we'll admit her.
On this I took down my Fan, and ſaid, O, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Sir, I am: Well then,
ſaid he, give me your Hand. He led me into a Parlour, where there were twelve
Clergy men, and ſaid, thoſe Fellows coming in had brought a Wench with
them; but, added he, we'll give her a Dinner, poor Devil! and keep the Secret
of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:—As moſt of the Gentlemen knew me, we were very merry
on this odd Introduction.</p>
            <p>Pox on you, you Slut, ſaid the Dean, you gave me a Hint for my
polite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which I have purſued: You ſaid, it would be better
to throw it into Dialogue; and ſuppoſe it to paſs amongſt the Great; I
have improved by you: O dear Sir, ſaid I, 'tis impoſſible you ſhould do
otherwiſe. Matchleſs Saucineſs! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0095100803:170"/> he:
Well, but I'll read you the Work; which he did with infinite Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, to our
high Entertainment.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> time, and froze very hard: The Dean,
meditating Revenge, ſet the Wine before a great Fire, the Corks of the Wine
being ſecured with Pitch and Roſin; which began, in a little while, to
melt: No ſooner did the Dean perceive they were fit for his Purpoſe, but he
ſlyly rubbed his Fingers on them, and daubed my Face all over. Inſtead of
being vexed, as he expected I would, I told him he did me great Honour in
ſealing me for his own. Plague on her, ſaid he, I can't put her out of
Temper; yet he ſeemed determined to do it, if poſſible, for he aſked
the Company, if they had ever ſeen ſuch a Dwarf? and inſiſted, that I
ſhould pull off my Shoes till he meaſured me: To this I had no Inclination
to ſubmit, but he was an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Prince, and Reſiſtance would have
little availed me; ſo when I obey'd, he ſaid, Why, I ſuſpected you had
either <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0095100803:171"/> broken Stockings, or foul Toes, and in either
Caſe ſhould have delighted to have expoſed you.</p>
            <p>He then made me ſtand up againſt the Wainſcot, leaned his
Hand as heavy as he could upon my Head, till I ſhrunk under the Weight, to
almoſt half my Proportion; then making a Mark with his Pencil, he affirmed, I
was but three Foot two Inches high.</p>
            <p>Dinner was brought up, and I being, like Mrs. <hi>Qualmſick</hi>
the Curate's Wife, always a breeding, could not eat any; the Gentlemen
gueſſing at my Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, by my decreaſing Face, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
Waſte, were ſo over-obliging to know what I liked beſt; that at laſt I
told the Dean, I wiſh'd I was a Man, that I might be treated with leſs
Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: Why, ſaid the Dean, it may be you are: I wiſh, Sir, ſaid I,
you would put the Queſtion to the Company, and accordingly to their Votes,
let my Sex be determined. I will, ſaid he; <hi>Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kington,</hi> what ſay
you? A Man, Sir: they all took his Word; and, in Spite <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0095100803:172"/>
of Petticoats, I was made a Man of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner: I was obliged to put a
To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco-pipe in my Mouth; but they ſo far indulged me, as to let it be an
empty one; as were the Dean's, Doctor <hi>Delany</hi>'s, and my Husband's.</p>
            <p>The Dean aſked me, could I play Crib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidge? I ſaid, I could:
Upon which he called for Cards; but, upon Recollection, ſaid, he would not
play with a Beggar, for he ſhould ſtand no Chance; for if he won, he would
not take the Money, and if he loſt, he muſt in Honour pay. But why a
Beggar, Mr. Dean, ſaid Doctor <hi>Delany?</hi> A married Curate muſt of
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence be a Beggar, return'd he, and you are another; and Pox on me, if
I can ever get acquainted with any Perſons but Beggars; and I don't think but
this Woman, or Man here, is in the way of producing another. Then, Sir, I hope
you will be ſo kind to ſtand Godfather, which will ſecure it from ſo
hard a Fate. So! ſaid he, more Demands upon me! Well, if it be a Boy, I don't
much care <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0095100803:173"/> if I do; but if it be a little Bitch I'll
never anſwer for her.</p>
            <p>A Day or two after this the Dean came to Town, and ſummoning a
<hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Conſultum,</hi> as he called thoſe few Friends whom he
peculiarly regarded; he placed us round a great Table, where he told us, we
were an empannell'd Jury; and he placed himſelf at the Head of it, where he
ſat as Judge. He then told us, the Reaſon why we were ſummoned, Mr.
<hi>Gratton</hi>'s favourite Hen was put to Death by an unlucky Stroke of a
Whip, by one of my Fellows, as I ſuppoſe: I accuſed them, and they denied
the Fact; but as Murder always will come to light, I found the Hen's Head and
Neck in the Seat of my Chaiſe-box; and now I want to convict the Criminal:
Accordingly he ordered his three Men Servants to come before us, and related
the following Story to them: When Doctor <hi>Donne,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Dean of
<hi>St. Paul's, London,</hi> took Poſſeſſion of the firſt Living he
ever had, being a ſpeculative Man, he took a Walk into the Church-yard, where
the Sexton <pb n="151" facs="tcp:0095100803:174"/> was digging a Grave, and throwing up a Skull,
the Doctor took it up, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template thereon; and found a ſmall Sprig, or
headleſs Nail ſticking in the Temple, which he drew out ſecretly, and
wrapt it up in the Corner of his Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief; he then demanded of the
Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digger, whether he knew whoſe Skull that was? He ſaid he did, very
well; declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was a Man's who kept a Brandy-ſhop, an honeſt drunken
Fellow, who one Night taking two Quarts of that comfortable Creature, was found
dead in his Bed the next Morning: Had he a Wife, ſaid the Doctor? Yes, Sir:
Is ſhe living? Yes: What Character does ſhe bear? a very good one; only
indeed the Neighbours reflected on her, becauſe ſhe married the Day after
her Husband was buried; though, to be ſure, ſhe had no great Reaſon to
grieve after him. This was enough for the Doctor, who under Pretence of
viſiting all his Pariſhioners, called on her; he aſked her ſeveral
Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and amongſt others, What Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs her firſt Husband died
of? She giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0095100803:175"/> him the ſame Account he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
received, he ſuddenly opened the Handkerchief, and cried, in an
authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Voice, <hi>Woman, do you know this Nail?</hi> She was ſtruck
with Horror at the unexpected Demand, and inſtantly owned the Fact: And ſo,
Fellow, ſaid Dean <hi>Swift,</hi> do you know this Head? The Criminal
confeſſed his Fault, and the Jury brought him in guilty of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,
in his own Defence, for he declared he was hungry, and did eat it, having no
Malice prepenſe to it, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Love. On Account of his Sincerity, and our
Interceſſion, the Dean pardon'd him.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gratton</hi> had preſented the Dean with a ſmall
Caſk of fine Ale, of which he was very choice; good Malt-Liquor not being
eaſily purchaſed even in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> On <hi>Sunday</hi> Evening the
Dean's Set of Intimates came as uſual, to paſs it with him, and he being in
high good Humour, ſaid, he would treat us with a Pot of this Ale. I had the
Honour of being intruſted with the Key of the Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0095100803:176"/>
with a particular Order to hold the Candle in ſuch a Poſition, that it
might drop into the Tankard; as alſo not to put the Spiggot faſt in, but
let the Drink run about. After receiving his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which I promiſed
punctually to obey, I went down, but had ſcarce open'd the Door, when Doctor
<hi>Delany</hi> and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Sheridan</hi> were with me. O Breach of
Truſt, unpardonable! We ſat down on a Bench, and each of us drank; but we
laughed ſo heartily at cheating the Dean, that he ſtole down, having ſome
Suſpicion, that where there was a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and two Clergymen, there might be a
Plot, and ſurpriſed us: I, in Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Servant, told him, the
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſeduced me, and I did drink: Pox choke you all, ſaid he.</p>
            <p>In vain did I, with all the moving Eloquence of a female Orator,
plead for Pardon: The Key was taken from me, and Mr. <hi>Rochford</hi> was,
before my Face, inveſted with my Honours; and I, Oh fatal Sentence! condemn'd
to be Sock-waſher <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0095100803:177"/> to the blackguard Boy, who wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the under Butler's under Butler.</p>
            <p>I would have perſuaded Mr. <hi>Rochford</hi> to plead in my
Behalf, but he was obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as Adamant; eſpecially as by my Diſgrace he
roſe. However, not long after, I preſented him with an humble Petition,
wherein I failed not to extol the Neatneſs of the Boy's Feet, ſince they
came into my Hands, inſomuch 
<q> 
                  <l>—that not the niceſt Noſe</l> 
                  <l>Cou'd, in the Dog-days, ſmell his Toes.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And, as a Reward, I was made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectoreſs-general of all the
drinking Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; but no more intruſted with the Key of the Cellar: To
ſay the Truth, I could not well vindicate my Conduct in that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Point.</p>
            <p>The Dean had twenty of thoſe agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Whims, which kept us all
chearful, as was his Intent; for I ſuppoſe my Readers will believe, that
neither he nor we valued the Ale, but for the Jeſt's ſake.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0095100803:178"/>No Man living told a Story to more Advantage
than the Dean; there never was a Word too little or too much in it, it was
always apt, full, clear, and conciſe, truly epigrammatick.</p>
            <p>It would be well for their Readers, if ſome of our Writers had
learn'd this happy Art; but they draw out their Tales to a tireſome Length,
dwelling on every trivial Circumſtance, and omitting things of greater
Conſequence, and when they would ſeem wiſe, they grow obſcure. 
<q> 
                  <l>Thus the ſmall Silk-worm ſpins her ſlender Store,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Dean told me, he did remember that he had not laugh'd above
twice in his Life; once at ſome Trick a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank's Merry-Andrew play'd;
and the other time was at the Circumſtance of <hi>Tom Thumb</hi>'s killing
the Ghoſt; and, I can aſſure Mr. <hi>Fielding,</hi> the Dean had a high
Opinion of his Wit, which muſt <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0095100803:179"/> be a Pleaſure to him,
as no Man was ever better qualified to judge, poſſeſſing it ſo
eminently himſelf.</p>
            <p>Yet was he ſo free from any vain Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation of it, that
he could ſuit his Converſe to the Talents of his Company; inſomuch that,
I believe, had they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to play Puſh-pin, or talk Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, he
would have complied even with the latter, if it had been in his Power.</p>
            <p>I have known him fill up Rhymes, given after the manner of the
<hi>French,</hi> though he had found it true muſical Rhythm, ſo eſteem'd
by the Antients; nay, he could deal in the 
<q> 
                  <l>Pun ambiguous, or Conundrum quaint.</l>
               </q> Which ſome
book-learned Blockheads, for ſuch I have ſeen, with each a Store of Lumber,
crude and undigeſted in their Brains, would no doubt have ſcorn'd: But, as
<hi>Horace</hi> obſerves, there is a Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſometimes mingling
Folly with Wiſdom; and I am well convinced no Perſon, without a good
Underſtanding, can even play the Fool agreeably.

            </p>
            <p>One Night, that I had the Honour to be in as polite a Set of
Company as ever <hi>Europe</hi> bred, they took a Fancy that each of them would
imitate the Voice of a different Animal, either Bird or Beaſt, each having
fixed on what ſuited their Inclination; they began the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort at once:
Would not any one, who had refuſed to join in the Frolick, have ſeem'd
ridiculous? 'Tis true, indeed, this was attended with one mortifying
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; for the Servants, ſcar'd at the hideous Yelling, and
concluding we were all fighting, ran haſtily in to part us; but finding all
was right, they left us; however, we heard them laugh heartily at our
Entertainment.</p>
            <p>As I have often mentioned the Dean's Charity, one ill conferr'd
Inſtance of it cannot, I believe, but make my Readers ſmile:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0095100803:181"/>He obſerved a Woman, whoſe whole
Eſtate was a Sieve of Fruit, which ſhe had in a Stall, where ſhe ſat
footing worn-out Stockings. Seeing the Woman very decent, and always at work,
he judged her to be a proper Perſon for him to aſſiſt; eſpecially as,
by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of her Neighbours, ſhe was a very honeſt Woman. The Dean
aſked her, why ſhe did not try to borrow twenty Pounds, and ſet up a
handſome Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. Alas-a-day, Sir, ſaid ſhe, who would truſt a
poor Creature like me with ſuch a Sum? Why, ſaid he, if I thought you would
improve it, I would lend it you. The Woman promiſed fair, and the Dean lent
her the Money; and, at the ſame time, wrote down the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular kinds of
Fruit he would have her furniſh herſelf with. She was to let him know when
ſhe was ſtock'd, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to recommend her to Cuſtomers.</p>
            <p>The Woman, overjoy'd at her good Fortune, went about five o'Clock
next Morning to a Gardener's, produced her Bill of Fare, on which they, judging
by her <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0095100803:182"/> Appearance ſhe could not pay for ſuch a
Cargo, laugh'd at her. This provok'd the Pride of the new-rais'd Beggar; who,
to convince them of her Wealth, produced it to their aſtoniſh'd View; upon
which they alter'd their Note, and as it was a cold Morning, ſaid, That 
<q rend="inline">"Bargains were never made with dry Lips."</q> They
drew in the poor Woman to drink plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully of 
<note n="*" place="bottom">Brandy and Ale mixt.</note>Hotpot, which
ſoon left her ſtupid in the Ale-houſe; but not till they had firſt done
her the Favour to rob her.</p>
            <p>When ſhe came a little to herſelf, the Woman of the Houſe
demanded Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Fellows being gone. She was going to pay the Reckoning,
but alas! her Money was gone too: It was in vain for her to enquire for it,
every-body diſavowed the Fact; but the Gardener, out of his great Charity,
gave her a Baſket of Windfalls, with which ſhe was obliged, ſeeing no
Remedy, to return to her origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Poverty.</p>
            <p>The Dean vainly look'd for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Charity; he could
neither <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0095100803:183"/> ſee Shop, nor Woman, for ſhe kept out of his
way; at length he happened in Church to be ſeiz'd with the Cholick, and went
out in the middle of Service; and who ſtood at the Church-door, but the very
Perſon? He ſtopp'd, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, why he had not heard from her, and how
ſhe proceeded? Upon this the Woman flew into a Rage, abuſed him all the Way
to his own Houſe, told him, that his curſed Money had bewitch'd her; that
all the Neighbours knew ſhe was a modeſt, virtuous, ſober Woman, and that
he had made her turn Whore and Drunkard; the Dean ran in, clap'd the the Door
upon her, and begged the Protection of his Domeſticks againſt the mad
Woman.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt obſerve, that as the Dean was very juſtly
ſatirical on the Vices of human Kind, yet when he fell on Infirmities, he
ſeem'd to have done a diſpleaſing Act to Heaven, inaſmuch as he was
puniſhed with them all in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable manner; he lived to be a 
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0095100803:184"/> 
               <hi>Struldbrugg,</hi> helpleſs as a Child, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to aſſiſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>I ſay not this as any Reflection to his ſacred Memory, Heaven
forbid I ſhould; but with all the Reverence I have for the Dean, I really
think he ſometimes choſe Subjects unworthy of his Muſe, and which could
ſerve for no other End ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of turning the Reader's Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, as it
did my Mother's, who, upon reading the <hi>Lady's Dreſſing-room,</hi>
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly threw up her Dinner.</p>
            <p>Here I digreſs, oddly enough, on a whimſical Circumſtance.
Having once had the Honour of being known to Lady ******, I took the Liberty of
applying to her for a Subſcription; her Neice came out, and miſtaking the
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who brought the Letter for me, ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"Her Lady wondered at my Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to apply to
her, when I knew how I had uſed Sir ******:"</q> But if ever I uſed him, or
he me, then am I no two-legged Creature; for, to my Knowledge, I never even
ſaw him; if the Man did dare to contradict me, I <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0095100803:185"/> wou'd
make him eat a Piece of my Pen: But how uſed him? not unlawfully, I hope. Did
your Ladyſhip ever ſee me lewdly lolling on a Love-bed with him? No, if we
ever met, he was ſupported by two reverend Prelates, proper Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters for a
Chriſtian Hero; but I never heard that the Gentleman was addicted to Women;
ſo that I hope I may reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſured by him, and alſo by your
L—p.</p>
            <p>I do this, Madam, in regard to the Gentleman's Character, for my
own is of no Conſequence. 
<q> 
                  <l>'Tis Bare-bit, and knawn by Treaſon's Canker-Tooth.</l> 
                  <bibl>Shakeſpear.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And pray now, Sir <hi>C—,</hi> for to thee I call, but with
no friendly Voice. What time? what Day? what Hour did I ever diſoblige you?
the Injuries you have done me, I freely forgive, and 
<q> 
                  <l>If you pleaſe,</l> 
                  <l>Will honour you with Panegyrick Lays.</l>
               </q> 
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0095100803:186"/> But then take notice you muſt come down handſomely;
you are not Lord <hi>Kingsborough,</hi> nor will my Verſe flow ſpontaneous.

            <p>So now, for ever and for ever farewel, <hi>Brutus!</hi> if we do
meet again, why we ſhall laugh, if not, why ſurely we ſhall never weep; a
more inſpiring Theme demands my Attention: So, Sir Knight of the Oracle,
adieu, if thou dyeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, as you ſhould, ſince you ſtept into
the World thirty Years e'er my dim Speck of Entity was animated; I have wrote
your Epitaph, which I beg you may have engrav'd on your Tomb-ſtone; leſt

            <p>I preſume, by the Information of your Boots, you have read

                  <l>Here lies the greateſt Man that e'er was born,</l> 
                  <l>All Womankind ſincerely did he ſcorn,</l> 
                  <l>And kept the good old Proverb in his Mind,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This, Sir, I give you as a farther Proof of my Impudence, in which
I own your Family to have far the Superiority to mine; for though ſome of
them did Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution in the well-fought Field, yet none of them were condemn'd
to ſuffer one: So read this, and then to Breakfaſt with what Appetite you

            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0095100803:188"/>But after all I have ſaid, I bear you no
Ill-will; but you began with me this Tennis-game, and I have match'd my Racquet
to the Balls; and, depend on't, whoever begins with me, I bear the Motto of the

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Hour now came, when the Dean's Promiſe was to be claim'd; as
I brought forth a Son, I wrote to him, but he was in the Country, and in five
Days the Boy died: The Dean did not return till I was a Fortnight brought to
Bed.</p>
            <p>He came directly to viſit me: Mr. <hi>Pilkington</hi> open'd the
Door for him, and brought him up to me. After wiſhing me Joy, he aſked,
where was his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-elect? I told him in Heaven: The Lord be praiſed,
ſaid he, I thought there was ſome good News in the way, your Husband look'd
ſo briſk: Pox take me, but I was in Hopes you were dead your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but
'tis pretty well as it is, I have <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0095100803:189"/> ſav'd by it, and I
ſhould have got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by you.</p>
            <p>He drank a little Caudle with me, and then went away; about an
Hour after his Servant brought me a Letter, and a great Bundle of brown Paper,
ſealed with the utmoſt Care, and twiſted round with I know not how many
Yards of Pack-thread; my Curioſity led me to read the Letter before I
examined the Contents of the Paper, which, to the beſt of my Knowledge, was
this:

wrapt in white Paper, on the Outſide of each was wrote Plumb.</p>
            <p>I ſent the Dean a real Piece of Pumb cake, with this Anſwer:

            <p>Juſt when he had fix'd Mr. <hi>Pilkington</hi> to be Chaplain to
Alderman <hi>Barber,</hi> the Dean received from <hi>Spain,</hi> from one Mr.
<hi>Wogan,</hi> a green Velvet Bag, in which was contained the Adventures of
<hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>; as alſo an Account of the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Marriage of
the Chevalier, to the Princeſs <hi>Sobieſky,</hi> wherein he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents 
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0095100803:191"/> himſelf to have been a principal Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiator. It was
wrote in the Novel Stile, but a little heavily: There was alſo ſome of the
Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> paraphras'd in <hi>Miltonick</hi> Verſe, and a
Letter to the Dean, with Remarks on the <hi>Beggar's Opera</hi>; in which he
ſays he believes the People of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> had
quite loſt all Remains of Elegance and Taſte, ſince their top
Entertainments were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Scenes of Highwaymen, and Proſtitutes, who
all remain unpuniſh'd and triumphant in their Crimes: He concluded with
paying the Dean the Compliment of intreating him to correct the Work.</p>
            <p>The Dean ſaid, he did not care to be troubled with it, and bid
Mr. <hi>Pilking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> take it to <hi>London,</hi> and look it over at his
Leiſure, which accordingly he did.</p>
            <p>He was ſcarce gone, when the Dean came to me for the Bag; I told
him my Huſband had; according to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, taken it with him. He
proteſted he never gave him any ſuch Permiſſion; <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0095100803:192"/>
that I was impudent to ſay it, and my Husband more ſo to do it; the
Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which was; that he ordered me to write to him to return it
immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; and, leaſt I ſhould forget it, he gave me a very good
Beating. Well; I writ Mr. <hi>Pilkington</hi> an Account of the Dean's Wrath,
and he ſent me the fatal Bag by a Clergyman: I directly carried it to the
Dean, and hoped he would be pleaſed, by my punctual and ready Obedience to
his Will; but far otherwiſe it fell out, for the Dean flew into a
Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for my daring to preſume to write for it, and gave me another
Beating.</p>
            <p>But did not this more reſemble the Actions of a Lunatick than of
a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of ſuperior Wit and Knowledge? Indeed, I believe too much
Learning had turn'd his Head, or too deep a Search into the Secrets of Nature;
as nothing could eſcape his Obſervation. And this wrong Turn in his Brain,
I fancy had poſſeſſed him a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was taken notice of,
as number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Proofs might be produced; and even <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0095100803:193"/>
amongſt the Facts that I have related there are ſome ſtrong Inſtances
of it; had he been leſs witty, it would ſooner have been taken notice of;
but, as the Poet obſerves, 
<q> 
                  <l>Great Wit to Madneſs ſure is near allied,</l> 
                  <l>And thin Partitions do their Bounds di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Proof he gave of his Incivility was affronting the
Lord Lieutenant, at the Lord Mayor's Table; who, becauſe he had not paid his
Compliments to him in due Form, he very civilly accoſted, by the
extraordinary Title of, you, Fellow with the blue String. Some little time
after this, he invited two Clergymen to take the Air with him, and when he got
them into a Coach, he did ſo belabour them and knock their Heads together,
that they were obliged to cry out for Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>From this he fell into a deep Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, and knew no body; I
was told the laſt ſenſible Words he uttered, were on this Occaſion: Mr.
<hi>Handel,</hi> when <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0095100803:194"/> about to quit <hi>Ireland,</hi>
went to take his leave of him: The Servant was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Time, e'er he
could make the Dean underſtand him; which, when he did, he cry'd 
<q rend="inline">"O! A <hi>German,</hi> and a Genius! A Prodigy!
admit him."</q> The Servant did ſo, juſt to let Mr. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> behold
the Ruins of the greateſt Wit that ever liv'd along the Tide of Time, where
all at length are loſt.</p>
            <p>If ought elſe relating to him, ſhould occur to my Remembrance,
I will faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully relate it; as I am certain it cannot but be acceptable to
the Public, whoſe Intereſt he had evermore at Heart, and whoſe Liberties
on all Occaſions, he warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and nobly aſſerted.</p>
            <p>'Tis mine, O honoured Shade, to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate thy Goodneſs, without
extenuating thy Faults; I deal impartially, which is the true Taſk of an
Hiſtorian, and I would inſcribe thy Tomb-Stone, were I permitted; but
without Characters, Fame lives long. Thine will laſt, while Wit or Genius are
admired in this ſublunary Globe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0095100803:195"/>However diſagreeable it may be to me, I
find I muſt proſecute my own Hiſtory, till my leaving <hi>London,</hi> to
which Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis I never intend to return, as has been inſinuated, in order
to hurt my Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: While ever I can find Means of ſubſiſting in
my native Country, where I have received more Favour, than I could reaſonably
hope for, I ſhould eſteem my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not only ungrateful, but unjuſt to
raiſe Contributions on the Public, and carry the Money from this poor
Iſland, to ſpend it in a rich and opulent City.</p>
            <p>Beſides my Days of Vanity are over. The Woods, Groves,
Fountains, ſacred Receſſes, dear to the Muſes, would be my Choice, even
had I a Fortune to entitle me to enjoy the Splendor of a Court in its utmoſt
Magnificence. O how I languiſh for Retirement; even as the Heart pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
after the Water Brooks, ſo longeth my Soul after it; where I might ſit upon
ſunleſs Side of ſome Romantic Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Foreſt crown'd. I wiſh my
beſt and deareſt Friend, would take this into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and in
ſome Part of his wide <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0095100803:196"/> extended Domains, afford his
Muſe an humble Hermitage.</p>
            <p>I ſhould not then be diſtracted with Fears of an imperious
Landlord's Threats. No; your happy Tenant would pay her Debt in Weeds, which,
when I once told your Lordſhip, you very politely anſwered, that ſuch
Verſes as mine were the fineſt Flowers in the Garden of the Muſes.</p>
            <p>I muſt here relate to your Lordſhip, a little Circumſtance
which happened to me lately. I took a Lodging in <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condra-lane</hi>; the
two Ladies, (Siſters) who keep the Houſe, kindly invited me to Dinner; it
was very natural for me to enquire what Perſons of Diſtinction lived in our
Neighbourhood; they told me Lord <hi>Kingsborough</hi> had lately purchaſed a
Houſe in it, a moſt worthy fine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. I happened to expreſs ſo
much Pleaſure, at hearing this agreeable piece of News, and at the ſame
time ſo warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joined in their Sentiments, that one of the Ladies ſaid:
Well, Madam, though you have made a Myſtery of your Name, 
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0095100803:197"/> I am certain you are Mrs. <hi>Pilkington</hi>; I am
ſure you are the Perſon; becauſe you ſpeak of his Lordſhip, in the
very ſame Stile you have wrote of him. I have the two Volumes.</p>
            <p>As I found they were prepoſſeſſed in Mrs.
<hi>Pilkington</hi>'s Favour, I confeſs'd they had gueſs'd right. But
whenever I want Concealment, if your Lordſhip is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I will take Care
to be ſilent. Otherwiſe I ſhall ſoon betray myſelf, as out of the
Abundance of the Heart, the Mouth ſpeaketh. Though I am afraid, that like
holy David, it would be Grief, and Pain to me, and while I ſat muſing the
Fire would kindle; the Sacred Fire of Friendſhip and Gratitude, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
my Tongue and give me Utterance, even though I had been born dumb.</p>
            <p>Why, my dear Lord, were but a few Perſons of Diſtinction, in
your Way of thinking, Earth itſelf would become a Paradiſe: no more would
the ſorrowful Sighing of the Priſoner, nor the Voice of Lamentation be
heard in our Streets, and 'tis with infinite Pleaſure, I ſee our long 
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0095100803:198"/> ſtain'd Nobility, <hi>who were only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for
undoing,</hi> and built their <hi>Characters on Rapes and Ruin,</hi> now
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to a Man, not only juſt, but bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent; not only learned
themſelves, but Encouragers of Science in others. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our Country's
Worthies, I name you Lord <hi>Moleſworth,</hi> who have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
yourſelf in Fields and Senates, in the Seats of the Muſes, and Academic
Groves; whoſe well try'd Valour has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved itſelf; not in Raſhneſs,
but a noble Intrepidity and Scorn of Death, whenever your God, your King, or
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, requir'd your Service; I hope it will not offend you, to ſay, may
your God, your King, and Country, make you as happy, as my much obliged, and
moſt truly grateful Heart ſincerely wiſhes, ſhall ever be my ardent
Prayer.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip has kindly viſited the Virtues of my Father on
his Daughter. I am ſure I had no other Claim, to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours or Honours for
which I am indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your Lordſhip, and for which I reſt your faithful
Servant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0095100803:199"/>At length, through ſtrange
Viciſſitudes, and Variety of Misfortunes, finding I could get no Relief
from <hi>Ireland,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, with my Son, to reviſit it; and though
late in Life, try my Fortune in <hi>Hibernia.</hi> But how to compaſs a
Journey and a Voyage without Money, was really a difficult Taſk; to this End
I ſet my Wits to Work, to find out whether any Perſons of my own Country
were in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> from whom, by revealing my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, I could
hope for Relief. At length I learned, that Dr. <hi>Delany</hi> was there, who
never rejected the Petition of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, even though they had no other
Merit to recommend them, but that of Anguiſh. My Suit was granted in the
moſt compaſſionate and obliging Manner; accompanied by his Tears for my
Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and Prayers for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Soul and Body. And

               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0095100803:200"/>How different was the Reception I met with,
at the Hands of this worthy Man, from the rough Return made to my
Sollicitations, for a Subſcription from Lady ****; who, 
<q rend="inline">"wondered at my <hi>Impudence</hi> in applying to
her."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Ladies, let me entreat you will drop that naſty paw Word
<hi>impudent,</hi> at leaſt don't annex it to my Name, who never yet had the
Aſſurance to appear in any publick Place, ſince I came laſt to this
Kingdom; nor ever to apply in Perſon for a Favour. But a Woman who has
ſuffered in Reputation, knows not what to do; 'tis all Impudence, though her
Betters have more; for that in the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is but a Choleric Word, which in
the Soldier is flat Blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>Upon my Word, if inſtead of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence I am charged with;
you would call me a deſolate afflicted Wretch, you would ſpeak the Truth;
for poor <hi>Laetitia</hi> is become the Foot-ball of Fortune; but why ſhould
I complain? when the Son of Man ſays, that the Foxes had Holes, and he
himſelf had no Place to lay his Head <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0095100803:201"/> in! Anſwer me
ſome of ye great, learned, and pious Divines; why is our Bleſſed Redeemer
ſtiled the Son of Man? When we are told, that a Virgin ſhould conceive;
that the Power of the higheſt ſhould over-ſhadow her! How was he then the
Son of Man? We are all order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to apply to our Heavenly Father, and therefore
may ſtile ourſelves the Children of God; why then is there any Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made in this Caſe?</p>
            <p>I hardly dare allow myſelf the Liberty of thinking, leſt I
ſhould do it too deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Reaſon be my Diſeaſe; and yet I believe
it was given me to follow and ſearch after Truth; where then ſhall I find
it? not on Earth, no more than Peace or Juſtice, who are long fled from
theſe lower Regions. Boldly then let me purſue them, even to the high
Place, from whence they ſprung; the Seat of Calms and Eaſe, the Manſions
of the Bleſt, where holy Hope and conſtant Faith, ſhall be loſt in
Fruition of that Happineſs, which hath not yet entered into the Heart of Man
to conceive.</p>

I wrote, in order to gain Relief, to a Prelate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> then
reſident in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0095100803:207"/> I ſent the Letter by
the Daughter of a diſſenting Clergyman, of whoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Virtue I was
confident. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her civilly, read over my Letter, and declared he did
not know me; but as he had ſome ſlight Knowledge of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, there was a
Guinea for me. This anſwered no End: But yet he gave me ſome Comfort, by
bidding her call again, and he would think of ſomething for my Service:
Accordingly, in a Week's Time ſhe went again, and again; till at length his
Lordſhip vouchſafed to ſend out a very rough Anſwer, not in the leaſt
befitting his Function or Dignity, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to one whom he knew from her
Infancy, to be a Woman of good Birth, and Education.</p>
            <p>But I reſolving to be as chuffy as he, ſent him in reality
another Epiſtle, not over-courteous I own; yet it wrought a better Effect,
than my complaining one produced, for his Gentleman came to me early next
Morning, with a very civil Letter; and produced ten Guineas, to my
unſpeakable Joy; but there was a Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0095100803:208"/> on my
Happineſs, for I was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to return ten Shillings Change, which I very
reluctantly complied with.</p>
            <p>With this Sum my Son and I quitted <hi>London,</hi> and being on
the ſaving Scheme, took Places in the Waggon. A moſt tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Way of
travelling! <hi>May</hi> Morning we ſet forth, our Slow-pac'd Cattle were
adorned with Ribbands and Flowers, and till then, I never underſtood the
meaning of the vulgar Expreſſion, of being as fine as a Horſe, for it
ſeems it is cuſtomary on this Month, to preſent the Waggoners with a
Ribband, at every Inn; till our Flea-bitten Nags, were almoſt blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the
tawdry party-coloured flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Honours of their Heads. I was really almoſt
fatigued to Death, for I was called up at three o'Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though
perhaps you don't ſet out till five. Tea or Coffee, none to be had, unleſs
in ſome of the Towns: Indeed, if I could, like our Driver, have eat a
Breakfaſt of Salt Beef and Cabbage at that ſqueamiſh Hour, it was laid
there ready. They bait not all Day; ſo one <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0095100803:209"/> might have
an Appetite by Evening, but it happened not ſo to me. The Heat and Duſt
quite depriv'd me of any Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Food, and eſpecially to the rough
Fare provided.</p>
            <p>My chief Delight was liſtening to the Nightingale, who then
warbled forth her love-laboured Song, to indulge the Pleaſure of hearing the
ſoft Warbler, pour forth her plaintive and harmonious Lay: I uſed when we
were near our reſting Place, to alight and walk through the flower-enamell'd
Meads, filled with Cowſlips, Primroſes, and wild Violets, for 
<q> 
                  <l>In rural Scenes the Soul of Beauty reigns,</l> 
                  <l>The Soul of Pleaſure lives in rural Scenes.</l> 
                  <bibl>POPE.</bibl>
               </q> My Son and I found out a ſweet Place,
canopy'd with Wood-bine, which had enringed itſelf in Plats about a large
Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Tree, whoſe Bloſſoms ſhed Perfumes, while the whole Seaſon
warbled round our <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0095100803:210"/> Heads; we ſeated ourſelves under
the wide ſpreading Shade, liſtening with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to thoſe wild
Muſicians. Suddenly the Boy cry'd out, O Mamma what ſhall I do? What is the
Matter, Child? Look at my Leg: I did ſo, and behold a Snake had twiſted up
it; I, though heartily ſtartled, had Preſence of Mind ſufficient, to beg
he would not ſtrike it; he took my Advice, though indeed both he and I were
ready to faint, and the evil Worm crawled away, without doing him any
Prejudice. But not being well aſſured that all the Serpent Race, ſworn
Foe to Man, might be ſo complaiſant, I was never after tempted to ſit
down in Albion's fruitful Fields.</p>
            <p>We lodged this Night at a ſtrange old Village, whoſe Name I
have forgot; I believe the Inn had formerly been a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, by the numerous
little Cells and Cloyſters, ſmall Windows, almoſt dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened with
Jeſſamine and Vines; it had a moſt romantic melancholy Air, fit for
ſtudious Contemplation, but not reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with rich Repaſt, or
chearful <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0095100803:211"/> Wine. The next Day being Sunday, a Day of
Reſt, we took up our Quarters at another Inn, where we got a Chicken and a
Pint of Wine, and lived ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
            <p>We then walk'd out to ſee what kind of Curioſity this Place
afforded, worth Remark; but finding none, we ſtrayed out on a Common, when
the firſt Object which ſtruck my Sight, was that of a Man ſuſpended
high in the Air, hanging in Chains on a Gibbet; ſhocking as it was, it
engaged my Attention; I concluded he muſt have been a moſt undutiful Son,
when the Birds of Prey had devoured him, and the Ravens picked out his Eyes.
Suddenly I was ſurprized with the Voice of a Man, who cried, O my dear
Coſhen Paddy, I wiſh thoſe who put you there for noting, were there
themſelves. I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about, and ſaw fifteen or twenty Men and Women lying
in a dry Ditch; I would have fled, but conſidering that might not be ſafe,
I rather choſe to walk at an eaſy Pace: One of the Fellows made up to us,
and aſked where we were <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0095100803:212"/> going; I told him to our
Country, <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Arah, ſaid he, are you a Catolic? I ſaid I was!
Upon I which he ſaid, Faith poor Paddy <hi>Lawler,</hi> who hangs there was a
good one. And what, Sir, brought him to ſo unfortunate an End? Why, ſaid
he, he was in Love with a proud ſcornful Huſſey, and ſhe ſlighted
him, ſo he met her in this Plaiſh, and becauſe ſhe would not accept of
his Shivility, he lent her a Nock on the Head, and ſo he got his Will of her.
She died the next Day, after ſhe had given Information againſt him; to be
ſure her Skull was broke, but he did not deſhine that.</p>
            <p>While he was telling me this Story, I trembled, but made the
beſt Speed I could to the Village, being infinitely more frightened at him,
than I had been at the Snake. He accompanied us there, for which I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him Thanks; how ſincerely my Readers may judge. But I made a Virtue of
Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and gave him fair Words. Now ſaid he, are not all theſe
Heretics damn'd Rogues? Ay, ſaid I, and I hope our <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0095100803:213"/>
true King will put all Villains to Death. Arrah, give me your Fiſt for that;
I was obliged to comply. When I got to the Inn I told him, I ſhould be glad
of his Company, but that I had a jealous Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who would certainly kill
me, if he found any Man in my Company. Damn the Rogue, ſaid he, if I was as
you, I would make him a Cuckold in a crack. I deſired he would pleaſe to
accept of a Pot of Drink, which he did, and making a Leg, walk'd off leaving us
unmoleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I bleſt God I had purchaſed Life at ſo cheap a
Rate.</p>
            <p>That ſoft Anſwers turn away Wrath, is moſt aſſured; for
I remember ſome Years ago, when the <hi>Cavan</hi> Rabble were up in Arms, my
Mother, Siſter, and I, went to pay a Viſit at <hi>Rathfarnam,</hi> to the
Lady of our excellent 
<note n="*" place="bottom">Eaton Stannard, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who
reſigned.</note>Recorder. On our return home, we were ſurrounded by a Pack
of theſe Wretches, who ordered my Father's Coachman to pull off his Hat to
them, which he refuſing, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0095100803:214"/> all armed
with ſhort thick Oak Tree Clubs, they ſwore we ſhould not ride in a
Coach, and they walk; my Mother, with ſurprizing Preſence of Mind, ſaid
Gentlemen, you are very welcome to the Coach, my Daughter and I will walk, to
oblige you with it; which, Villains, Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians, and Murtherers as they were,
they would not permit, but only deſired we might Huzza for them, this
notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our Terror, we chearfully did; and my Mother ſaid,
Gentlemen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you are dry, and gave them a Crown, with which they were
ſo well pleaſed, that they huzza'd for us, offering to guard us ſafe to
Town; but ſhe alledging that would be too much trouble, they left us with a
kind Aſſurance, that they would drink our Healths, and fight for us any
Time we ſtood in need of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
            <p>Nothing material happened to us till we got to <hi>Cheſter</hi>;
we took a Survey of the Cathedral Church, which had nothing like Beauty to
recommend it, any more <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0095100803:215"/> than the old black Walls which
environ Part of the City.</p>
            <p>Next Day we ſet out for <hi>Parkgate,</hi> which was crowded
with Nobility and Gentry, waiting for a fair Wind; here we were ſo long
detained, that my Purſe was quite exhauſted, even my laſt Shilling gone;
this was a ſad Situation, we were fixed to a Point without any Power of
Moving one way or another, wanting the neceſſary Agent Money. There was but
one Way left, which was even to apply to Lady <hi>Kildare,</hi> who was there;
but being aſhamed to do it in my Name, I e'en did it in my Son's, who waited
on her Ladyſhip with it, met a favourable Reception, and brought home a
Guinea. The Wind ſprung up fair and we embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on board the Race Horſe.
As I am always deadly Sick at Sea, I choſe to keep on Deck, as long as I
poſſibly could. My Son being well inured to the wat'ry Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſkipped
about, and ſung Marine Songs. Moſt of the Paſſengers went to their
Cabbins, when Mr. <hi>Hudſon,</hi> the Clergyman, ſeeing my Boy ſpeak to
me, <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0095100803:216"/> aſked me, was not that young Lad's Name
<hi>Pilkington?</hi> I ſaid Yes! I thought ſo ſaid he, for he is very
like Mr. <hi>Pilking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> the Clergyman; he has ſome Cauſe to be ſo,
Sir, for he is his Son. How can you anſwer for that, Madam? Why in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Sir,
I have ſome Cauſe of Knowledge of it, for I am that worthy Divine's Wife,
and the Boy's Mother. The Gentleman confeſſed the Force of my Plea, and
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed great Compaſſion for us both; and I do verily believe, had
he known our Circumſtances, he would have added Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to Pity.</p>
            <p>He ſeemed to be a learned and worthy Gentleman, which I had the
better Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of diſcovering, as he, my Son, myſelf, and a Gentleman
whom I did not know, ſat all Night in Lady <hi>Kildare</hi>'s Coach, which
was laſh'd upon Deck. We there were becalm'd, and amongſt other things, Mr.
<hi>Hudſon</hi> ſaid, that had he ever been ſo unfortunate to take a
common Woman, and ſhe had brought forth a Son ſo like him, as mine was to 
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0095100803:217"/> my Huſband, he would at leaſt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that
to be his own.</p>
            <p>Upon which I related to him a true Story. A Servant Maid who had
lived with Mr. <hi>Pilkington</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> enquired of the
Perſons who kept the next Houſe, who were the new Lodgers they had got; the
Name made her but more inquiſitive, and ſhe begg'd I would permit her to
ſee me, but as I had met with many a Trick in Life, I bid my Son and Daughter
ſit behind the Bed Curtain, and then deſir'd her to come up; I aſked her,
did ſhe know me; ſhe ſaid no indeed! but ſhe had lived with one Mr.
<hi>Pilkington</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who had turn'd his Wife out of Doors;
and that he lived on <hi>Lazer</hi>'s <hi>Hill.</hi> And what ſaid I were the
Names of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Why, returned ſhe, there was Maſter <hi>Billy,</hi>
Miſs <hi>Betty,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Jack!</hi> And how came you to leave
him? Why, indeed he was beating Miſs and Maſter ſadly, and I aſked him
why he did it? he ſaid becauſe they were none of his! <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0095100803:218"/> Oh, Sir, ſaid I, ſure Maſter Jack is yours, for he is your own
Picture. Ay, ſaid he, the Mother was thinking of me when he was got. In
troth, Sir, ſaid ſhe, I don't doubt that, for I believe you were the
neareſt Perſon to her; for which Offence, ſhe was directly
diſmiſſed: And could he have found Matter againſt her Life, he would
have proſecuted her.</p>
            <p>The Children knew her, and whatever little Favours ſhe had by
Stealth done for them in my Exile, I did my utmoſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to her. A
Benefit is ſeldom loſt.</p>
            <p>At length the Day broke and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered us my native Earth; I
hail'd the Mother Land which gave me Birth, but knowing how little Money I had,
did not chuſe to Land at <hi>Dunlary,</hi> which muſt be attended with more
Expence, than I had any Poſſibility of anſwering: The other
Paſſengers all went aſhore; 'twas about three o'Clock, and my Boy and I
waited in the Ship, not doubting but we ſhould be ſoon at
<hi>Ringſend</hi>; but it happened <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0095100803:219"/> otherwiſe, for we
were becalm'd; we once more took our Seats in the Coach, and found there the
Hammer Cloth, in which I wrapt myſelf, and fell faſt aſleep. In the Night
I was awaked by the terrible Curſes of the Captain of the Ship, who ſwore
dreadfully we ſhould be that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment loſt. I dropt the Glaſs, and aſked
him what was the Matter; he ſaid he had fallen aſleep, and truſted the
Ship to one who had directly thrown us on the <hi>North Bull.</hi> And are we
then to be loſt? I ſee no Remedy, we ſhall ſtrike in a Minut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> I pulled my Son, who laughed at my
Fears, which really were very great. The Ship ſtruck upon a Sand-Bank, with
ſuch Force, that it rebounded on another, and beat it almoſt to Pieces.
However, the Morn aroſe, that gilded all the flowery Plains, and preſented
to our View a moſt agreeable Proſpect, both of Land and Water; the Tide
left our Ship on the Strand, ſo that without Expence or Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, we
walked to <hi>Ringſend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we took a little decent Lodging, till I could be able to
remove to <hi>Dublin</hi>; <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0095100803:220"/> and I immediately
diſpatched my Son, with a Letter to a Nobleman, whom I had formerly ſeen at
my Father's; who obligingly ſent me a Guinea: This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me to diſmiſs
my Lodging; my Son brought me a Coach, in which we put our Portmanteau, and
remov'd to an Apartment he had taken for me at a ſmall Rent in
<hi>Aungier-ſtreet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, Reader, I have now brought you with me to <hi>Hibernia</hi>;
where you will ſuppoſe the Daughter of a Gentleman ſo univerſally
eſteemed, as Doctor <hi>Van Lewin,</hi> would, after ſo long an Exile, have
ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found ſome Friends.</p>
            <p>I wrote a very mannerly Epiſtle to my beloved Spouſe, in which
I ſlightly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned his mercileſs Treatment of me, and his poor Children;
and told him, that if he would pay me the Sixty five Pounds, for which I had
his Bond in Counſellor <hi>Smith</hi>'s Hands, I would not only forego the
Intereſt, which amounted to a conſiderable Sum, but alſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
leave the Kingdom; provided alſo, he would give me Aſſurance, that he 
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0095100803:221"/> would take Care of his youngeſt Son. I leave every
Perſon of Candour, to judge whether or not this was a fair Propoſal: And I
moſt ſolemnly proteſt to Almighty God, that I had no other intention, as
there was not at that Time, above forty Pages of my Firſt Volume wrote;
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſcorned to ſend me an Anſwer of any kind. Well, I wrote
again, yet ſtill his Reverence was ſilent as the Grave.</p>
            <p>This I confeſs a little incenſed me; and firſt determined me
in the Deſign, of publickly vindicating my Innocence, and laying open, for
univerſal Benefit, his unparallel'd Character; in which, if I have err'd,
'tis through Tenderneſs, as his Actions, 
<q> 
                  <l>Call Virtue Hypocrite,</l> 
                  <l>Pluck the fair Roſe from a young inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Love,</l> 
                  <l>And plant a Bliſter there.—</l> 
                  <bibl>SHAKESPEAR.</bibl>
               </q> I wrote to Counſellor
<hi>Smith,</hi> and told him how Mr. <hi>Pilkington</hi> had treated me, 
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0095100803:222"/> and withal informed him, that if he had too much Lenity
to ſue him for my law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Right, I inſiſted on his delivering me the
Bond, that I might put it in Force, for the Relief of myſelf and my
Child.</p>
            <p>The Counſellor was at a Loſs how to act in ſo critical a
Point. He knew Mr. <hi>Pilkington</hi>'s Talent, of traducing every Perſon,
who did not act in Compliance to his Inclination; and, on the other Hand,
Juſtice compell'd him to think I had a Right to be paid, what had ſo long
and ſo unlawfully been withheld from me; and by which I was drove to ſuch
Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He therefore wrote to him, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe acquainted him, how
much it was out of his Power, as an honeſt Man, to defend him from the
Conſequences of that Bond. Mr. <hi>Pilkington</hi> finding all his Policy of
no Effect in this particular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, condeſcended to honour the
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor with a moſt ſtupid Epiſtle, in which he inſinuated, 
<q rend="inline">"that his Motive for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Bond, was in
order to make me live virtuouſly for the future, which <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0095100803:223"/>
he could ſufficiently prove I had not done."</q> [Produce your Evidence Mr.
Parſon.] 
<q rend="inline">"That if he was allow'd only ſuch Time to pay
it, as his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would not allow, he would try what Remedy he could
obtain from a Court of Equity, when a full State of the Caſe was laid before
them."</q> Theſe are pretty near the Words; I wiſh you had my dear
Spouſe, as it muſt have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Pleaſure to any Court, to ſee you look
CONSCIENCE in the Face.</p>
            <p>But not to be tedious, after much Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Vexation of Spirit,
I procured from him twenty Pounds at one Payment, with which I took a little
rural Habitation near <hi>Bow-Bridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wrote a Letter to my dear old Friend, Mr. <hi>Cibber,</hi> and
told him, that however improbable it might ſeem to him, I had actually Twenty
Pounds in my Pocket; and added, that I had 
<q> 
                  <l>A little Room to lodge a Friend,</l> 
                  <l>A River at my Garden's End,</l>
               </q> 
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0095100803:224"/> and
wanted nothing, but the Delights of his Converſation, to make my Situation
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly agreeable. I believe Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi> had not till then heard of
my Expedition, ſo that my Letter muſt have ſurpriz'd him. By the return
of the Poſt, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from his dear Hand the following humorous Epiſtle.

<floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>To Mrs. <hi>Laetitia Pilkington,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>THOU frolickſome Farce of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: What! is there then
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Act to come of you yet? I thought you had ſome Time ago, made your
final Exit. Well, but without Wit or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment, I am glad to hear you are
ſo tolerably alive. I have your agreeable Narrative from <hi>Dublin</hi>
before me, and ſhall, as you deſire, anſwer every Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph in its Turn,
without once conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Importance or Connection. In the firſt Place,
you ſay I have for many Years been the kind Preſerver of your Life. In
this, I think I have no great Merit, as you ſeemed to ſet ſo little
Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue on it yourſelf, otherwiſe you would <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0095100803:225"/> have
conſidered, that Poverty was the moſt helpleſs Handmaid, that ever
wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a high ſpirited Lady. You ſeem to have a Glimpſe of a new
World before you; think a little how you are to ſqueeze through the Crowd,
with ſuch a Bundle at your Back, and do not ſuppoſe it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, you
can have a Grain of Wit, till you have twenty Pounds clear in your Pocket; with
half that Sum, a greater Sinner than you, may look the Devil in the Face.</p>
                     <p>Few People of Senſe will turn their Backs on a Woman of Wit,
that does not look as if ſhe came to borrow Money of them; but when Want
brings her to her Wit's End, every Fool will have Wit enough to avoid her.</p>
                     <p>I am not ſure your Spouſe's having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken another Wife,
before you came over, might not have proved the only Means, of his becoming a
better Huſband to you; for had he pick'd up a Fortune, the Huſh of your
Prior Claim to him, might have been worth a better ſeparate 
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0095100803:226"/> Maintenance, than what you are now like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to get out of
him.</p>
                     <p>As to my Health and Spirits, they are as uſual, and full as
ſtrong as any body's that has enjoy'd them the ſame Number of Years.</p>
                     <p>If the Value I have for you, gives you any Credit in your own
Country, pray ſtretch it as far as you think it can be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to you;
for under all the Rubbiſh of your Misfortunes, I could ſee your Merit
ſparkle like a loſt Jewel. I have no greater Pleaſure, than in placing my
Eſteem on thoſe, who can feel and value it. Had you been born to a large
For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, your ſhining Qualities might have put half the reſt of your Sex
out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. If any of them are uncharitable enough to call this
Flattery, tell them what a poor Devil you are, and let that ſilence them.</p>
                     <p>I hope you have but one Volume of your Works in the Preſs,
becauſe if it meets with any Succeſs, I believe I could give you ſome
natural Hints, which, in <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0095100803:227"/> the eaſy Dreſs of your Pen,
might a good deal enliven it.</p>
                     <p>You pay your Court very ill to me, by depreciating the natural
Bleſſings on your Side the Water: Pray what have we to boaſt off, that
you want, but Wealth and inſolent Dominion? Are not the Glory of God's
Creation there?—Woman, lovely Woman there, in their higheſt Luſtre! I
have ſeen ſeveral and frequent Samples of them here; and have heard of
many, not only from yourſelf, but others, who for the agreeable
Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of ſocial Life, have not their equal Play-Fellows in <hi>Old
England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And pray what would Life be worth without them? Dear ſoft
Souls, for now too they are laviſh of Favours, which in my Youth, they would
have trembled to truſt me with. In a Word, if inſtead of the Sea, I had
only the dry Ground <hi>Alps</hi> to get over, I ſhould think it but a Trip
to <hi>Dublin</hi>; in the mean time, we muſt even compound for ſuch
Interviews, as the Poſt or Packet can bring or ſend, to</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0095100803:228"/>I communicated this Letter to Lord Chief
Baron <hi>Bowes,</hi> the Hon. <hi>Arthur Hill,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and
ſeveral Perſons of Taſte, who were infinitely delighted with it, as they
were with many others, which I had from Mr. <hi>Cibber,</hi> and which would
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably have embeliſhed my Work, had I not the Misfortune to loſe
them, by lending them to a Man of Diſtinction, who by ſome Accident
miſlaid them; ſo I muſt e'en entertain you, with the neat Product of my
own Brain.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Victor,</hi> whom I have mentioned in my Second Volume,
and who is now Treaſurer of the Theatre Royal in <hi>Smock-Alley,</hi> came
to viſit me ſeveral Times, and frequently favoured us with an Order to
ſee the Play, as we were upon a very friendly and familiar Footing. My Son
uſed, when he had an Inclination, to call on my Friend for a Paſs; one
Night he ſent once or twice for that Purpoſe, when the Gentleman was
abroad? What does the giddy Creature do, but aukwardly counterfeits his Hand in
an Order for two. He told me of it, and ſaid he was <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0095100803:229"/>
ſure Mr. <hi>Victor</hi> would not deny it, when he was informed who had
taken that Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with his Name: I laugh'd at the Reflection of the Jeſt,
when it came to be known, as Mr. <hi>Victor</hi> had had the Boy in his Arms
when an Infant. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we took a Coach, went to the Play, and the Forgery
ſeem'd to paſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well. The firſt Act was ſcarce begun, when a
Perſon entered, and as the Houſe was thin of Company, tapt my Son on the
Shoulder. I did not apprehend the Cauſe of it, but began to grow uneaſy
when I found him ſtay a full Hour; at length he returned, and informed me,
that he had been, at the Inſtigation of Mr. <hi>Sh—n,</hi> arreſted
by two Conſtables, from whom he was only delivered by the Sollicitations of
Mr. <hi>Victor.</hi> This greatly aſtoniſhed me, as I thought Mr.
<hi>Sh—n</hi> ought to have had a little more Reſpect for the Son of a
Clergyman, eſpecially as he was well convinced, that as I knew his Father,
(whom <hi>the Dean</hi> entertained more as a Buffoon, than a Friend or
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion) and his Mother, I had a Power <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0095100803:230"/> of
furniſhing the World with ſome Anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes, which were hitherto unrevealed;
but the Scheme of letting my Son eſcape was not any Lenity in him, but a Bait
to catch me going out, whom they imagined they ſhould diſcover by the Boy;
but it happened that a Gentleman handed me me out, by which this generous
Intent was fruſtrated.</p>
            <p>His little deformed Brother had the Aſſurance to tell my Son
ſome Nights after, that Mr. <hi>S—n</hi> would eſteem any Satire I
wrote on him a Panegyrick; which when I heard, in order to oblige him with a
Compliment to his Taſte, I inclos'd to Mr. <hi>Victor</hi> the following
Lines, to be forwarded to his Mightineſs.

               </q> This, Sir, I moſt humbly beg your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of, as
'tis indeed the only thing which I could without Diſſimulation ſay of
you.</p>
            <p>I was told, that this worthy Gentleman, in a Letter to the
inimitable Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"We ſhine like <hi>Caſtor</hi> and
<hi>Pollux,</hi> 
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0095100803:233"/> you adorn <hi>Great Britain,</hi> while
I illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate <hi>Hibernia.</hi>"</q> Nothing ſure, but his matchleſs
Ignorance, could have drawn ſo diſproportionate a Parrallel. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the firſt time I had the Pleaſure of ſeeing Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> perform,
it was the Character of King <hi>Lear</hi>; I was in one of the Boxes, and when
he came to the mad Scene, I was ſo much affected at it, that I got up
inſenſibly, and was going out, till I was wak'd, like one from a Trance, by
the Lady who accompanied me, pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me by the Sleeve, and demanding where I
was going? and to ſay the Truth, 
<q> 
                  <l>He made me Marble, with too much conceiving.</l> 
                  <bibl>MILTON.</bibl>
               </q> I am certain no Perſon was ever
capable of making the Audience feel a Part, which they did not ſincerely do
themſelves; and I'm convinced, Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> never play'd a Part,
wherein he did not, through the whole Performance, believe himſelf the Man;
whereas <hi>Pollux,</hi> as <hi>Sh—n</hi> 
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0095100803:234"/>
modeſtly ſtiles himſelf, is no other than Tom <hi>Sh—n,</hi> though
he change Dreſs and Perriwig twenty Times a Night; he is indeed, <hi>Semper
Eadem, worſe</hi> and <hi>worſe,</hi> as my Countryman has it.</p>
            <p>This brings to my Memory, a Story of a very eminent Player, who
was to perform the Part of <hi>Hannibal.</hi> A Nobleman behind the Scenes,
took the Liberty to give a Twitch to one Tye of his Peruke. The enraged Hero
turned on his Heel, and with his martial Trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon, ſmote the Peer over the
Cheek. 
<q> 
                  <l>A Blow, by Heaven! and from an Actor's Hand!</l> 
                  <l>He did not ſtab him, for that were poor Revenge.</l>
               </q> But
when he came off the Stage, my Lord told him, he believed he thought himſelf
really <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when he could give with Impunity, ſuch an
Indignity, to a Man of his Conſequence. My Lord, ſaid the Player, if I did
not think myſelf <hi>Hannibal,</hi> I ſhould never be able to make 
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0095100803:235"/> the Audience do ſo.—So much for Theatrical
Affairs.</p>
            <p>I now began ſeriouſly to reſolve on Publiſhing my
Writings, and to that End had Propoſals printed. Perſons were at firſt a
little timorous, leſt I ſhould print a Liſt of Subſcribers, and by that
Means they might unwittingly give Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; but when I declared no Names
ſhould be inſerted, I had a numerous Contribution, from all the Nobility,
Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and Gentry; amongſt whom, when I name our excellent <hi>Lord
Chancellor,</hi> in whom Titles and Honours had made no Alteration, but that of
increaſing his Politeneſs, Munificence, and Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to every
Individual; our Patriot <hi>Speaker</hi>; and worthy Recorder <hi>Eaton
Stannard</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> I believe no Perſon of Diſtinction, will
bluſh to have their Names mentioned.</p>
            <p>Well, at length my firſt Volume was finiſhed, and I wrote a
bantering Letter to Sir <hi>J—n F—ke,</hi> to whom I have the
Diſhonour to be allied, to tell him, that I intended to dedicate it to him, 
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0095100803:236"/> 
               <hi>Nemine Con.</hi> He, whoſe Mind is truly pictured
in his ill-favoured Face, told my Son, that for himſelf, every Body would
take it as a thing done to make him ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, ſince he had not any
Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that might merit an Encomium, which indeed was true, except
'tis his matchleſs Impudence, in keeping Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of an Eſtate,
which his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Lady —, told him he had no more Right to, than
to the Dukedom of <hi>Burgundy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When his ſuppoſed Father, Sir <hi>B—ph F—ke</hi>
died, this young Spark was an Enſign in the Army, and ſtepping at once into
Affluence, he being naturally of a covetous Diſpoſition, refuſed to pay
his Mother the Jointure which ſhe claim'd, and was going to commence a Suit
with her; when one Morning ſhe called on him and ſaid, Hark ye, Sir
<hi>John,</hi> do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to go to Law with me for what's my Right? He
begg'd to be excuſed, but told her, Self-Preſervation was the firſt Law
of Nature; ſo it is Sir, ſaid ſhe, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by his real Father's
Name; then <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0095100803:237"/> you are no longer Sir <hi>J—n
F—ke</hi> which I will go inſtantly and make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p>He fell dutifully on his Knees, entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Pardon for his
Diſobedience, and promis'd for the future to pay all proper Reſignation to
her ſuperior Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—This, Sir <hi>John,</hi> you and many
others know to be Fact.</p>
            <p>He pointed out to me, as a ſubject for everlaſting Praiſe,
my beloved Lord <hi>Kingsborough,</hi> then Sir <hi>Robert King,</hi> and
though I had not the Felicity I have ſince experienced of a perſonal
Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, yet the Character pleaſed me, and accordingly I wrote
a trifling Dedication, far inferior to his Merit, which notwithſtanding he
kindly accepted, and ſent me the following Letter:

               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0095100803:239"/>But alas, how vain, how fleeting were all
the Joys I ever propoſed to myſelf. This Nobleman, in whoſe Eſteem I
ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined myſelf to be ſo deeply riveted, that not Fortune, Time, or Fate,
could ever diſplace me, was, as I have ſince learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the
Inſinuations of one <hi>Clancy,</hi> an old blind Beggar, whoſe Wants I had
often ſupplied, both in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> perſuaded to
believe, that I had ſpoken diſreſpectfully of his Lordſhip; and that my
Son ſaid he would print his Letters, and ſell them for Halſpence a-piece;
all which was moſt notoriouſly falſe: However, it had ſuch an Effect,
that his Lordſhip came to me, and giving me ten Guineas in a ſort of
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Tone, deſired me to give him his Letters; I burſt into Tears,
and told him, I would reſign them, (or even any thing, if poſſibly
dearer) to his Pleaſure. I went to my Drawer, took as many as I could find,
and delivered them as I would, 
<q> 
                  <l>The ruddy Drops that viſit my ſad Heart.</l>
               </q>

            <p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0095100803:240"/>He took them abruptly, and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, told
me he would ſend in the Morning for the Remainder of them; he left me in a
Condition which I am utterly incapable of deſcribing. A Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ſo
unlook'd for, ſunk me into a Train of the moſt gloomy Reflections, which
might have been attended with fatal Conſequences, had not the Entrance of
ſome agreeable Company diſſipated my preſent Reflections.</p>
            <p>The next Morning before I was up a Chairman came and knock'd at
the the Door; the Servant aſked who he wanted: He ſaid he came from Lord
<hi>Kingsborough,</hi> and muſt ſee Mrs. <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kington</hi> herſelf; he
told him I was not up; but he ſwore and ſtormed, ſaying he would not
leave the Place till he had his Lord's Letters from me. I happened to overhear
him, and deſired the Maid to tell the Chairman, I would ſend to his
Lordſhip preſently; I accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aroſe, and piqued at the Uſage I had
received from the Fellow, I muſt confeſs with Shame, I wrote a little 
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0095100803:241"/> warmly on the Subject to my Lord, and without allowing
myſelf time for Thought diſpatched it off. 
<q> 
                  <l>For I bear Anger as the Flint bears Fire,</l> 
                  <l>Which much enforced, ſhews a haſty Spark,</l> 
                  <l>And ſtrait is cool again.</l> 
                  <bibl>SHAKESPEAR.</bibl>
               </q> The fatal Epiſtle had ſcarce
left my Hand, e'er my Heart was agitated with the moſt ſenſible
Remorſe. I in vain diſpatched a Meſſenger after the firſt, 
<q> 
                  <l>'Twas paſt, 'twas gone, 'twas irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable;</l>
               </q> It
reach'd his Hands, and he only ſent for Anſwer, "'Tis very well:"</p>
            <p>I believe the judicious Part of my Readers, muſt have
apprehended that the Sin of Ingratitude is not amongſt the Number of mine,
ſince I have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through my Work, if poſſible, to make the
contrary conſpicuous, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0095100803:242"/> due Praiſe to
all my Benefactors. Yet what could my beloved Lord ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, but that he had
beſtow'd all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours on an unworthy Perſon?</p>
            <p>I did not believe that after all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Mind I had
ſuſtained through my Life, any thing could move my Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, (which
had made me determine never to be overjoyed or ſurprized, at any Advancement
in Life, nor deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or caſt down at any Adverſity on this Side Futurity)
ſo much as this.</p>
            <p>Downy Repoſe was a Stranger to my Pillow, and I fell a Prey to
the greateſt Languor and Heavineſs of Soul. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever as I knew his
Lordſhip was filled with the Milk of human Pity, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, by apologizing
for the raſh Act, I ſhould be bleſt with his forgiveneſs, and a Renewal
of his Friendſhip to me, to which End I wrote the following Lines:

ſhews the Inſtability of human Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
            <p>And here, gentle Reader, my Story and my Life draw to a Period. I
am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, from the preſent Situation of my Health, that I ſhall never

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>I Promiſed in my Propoſals for print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Volume by
Subſcription, to give the Readers a Key to the firſt, ſecond, and third
Volumes, in this Place; but having been adviſed by ſome judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Friends,
that ſuch a thing would only tend to create ill Blood, and excite a
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment too powerful to be withſtood by ſo inconſiderable a
Perſon as myſelf, it has been thought expedient to furniſh them with an
Account of my Mother's Death; which I am the more capable of doing, as I
remained with her to her laſt Moments.</p>
            <p>She had been a long time in a declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing State of Health, having
an extreme bad Stomach, and Digeſtion: Nor did <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0095100803:248"/> ſhe
imagine that Nature could have held out as long as it did.</p>
            <p>She never ſeemed in the leaſt uneaſy at the Knowledge of her
approaching End; often declaring, that if ſhe could take me with her to
Felicity, ſhe would leave this World without Reluctance.</p>
            <p>And indeed, I am not ſurprized, that her maternal Love extended
ſo far, as ſhe even then foreſaw the Calamities which I have ſince
ſuſtained; and knew, that if the World, at her firſt ſetting out as a
Writer, with her extraordinary Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, ſcarce afforded her Bread, my Fate
muſt be even harder, except I met the Patronage of ſome illuſtrious
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>And Providence ſeemed inclinable to comply with her Wiſh; for,
in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter End of <hi>June,</hi> 1751, I was ſeized with a moſt violent
Pleuretic Fever, which I got by an extreme Cold, I ſent for Doctor
<hi>Fergus,</hi> a moſt eminent Phyſician, and worthy Gentleman; my Mother
was at this time ſo weak as to be obliged to keep her Bed: When the Doctor
ſaw me, and <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0095100803:249"/> heard the Symptoms of my Diſorder, he
told me I was a dead Man; that I ſhould have applied ſome Days ſooner,
ſince he was now of Opinion it had got too far the Aſcendency over me for
any Cure to be effected: However, he ordered me to be blooded four times that
Day, and then went up to my Mother's Apartment.</p>
            <p>She aſked him his Advice upon her own Caſe and mine; and he
told her a little too frankly, that Nature might do ſomething for my
Recovery, but that her Death was inevitable; ſhe ſmiling, ſaid to him,
That the Worms would have but a poor Feaſt of her, ſhe being quite worn
away.</p>
            <p>Well, I was blooded according to his Order, and the Fever abated
conſiderably. I had the next Night an exceſſive Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which
carried off all the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms except a little Weakneſs.</p>
            <p>In the Morning a young Lady, who honour'd me with a particular
Regard, came to ſee me. She was ſo exceſſively delighted at my ſpeedy
and unexpected Recovery, that ſhe reſolved to ſpend the 
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0095100803:250"/> Day with me; and my poor Mother, ever willing to
contribute to my Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, told the Nurſe-keeper that ſhe found
herſelf much better, and deſired ſhe might be brought to my Apartment;
accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſhe lifted my dear Mother like a Child, in her Arms, and placed
her in an Elbow-chair by my Bed-ſide: She affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in order to pleaſe me,
to be extremely chearful; and the young Lady kneeled down, and aſked her
Bleſſing; telling her ſhe wanted to have a Wedding in the Houſe
inſtead of a Burying from it. My Mother, who retained her Spirits and good
Humour to the laſt, gave us both her Bleſſing very devoutly, and her
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Permiſſion to marry. I had a ſmall Chicken dreſſed for my
Dinner, of which my Mother partook, but her Stomach was too weak to keep it, or
a Glaſs of Wine, which ſhe drank after it; ſo ſhe was obliged to be
carried to Bed.</p>
            <p>After her Departure, as the Weather was vaſtly warm, I ordered
the Maid to open the Saſh-window; and, in the mean time, comes the Doctor; we
were juſt <pb n="228" facs="tcp:0095100803:251"/> going to drink Tea: This Gentleman is a
little near-ſighted; but ſeeing the Saſh up, and Company in the Room,
What, ſaid he, this poor Boy's gone; I thought ſo! And was going out: No,
Sir, ſaid I, I am ſtill alive: Alive! ſaid he, And what are all theſe
People doing here? He immediately went and darkened the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, taking the
Company by the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and turning them out; he then charged the
Nurſe-keeper, not to open the Window, nor let any Perſon talk to me for a
Week.</p>
            <p>I thought this Preſcription a little hard, as I imagined
myſelf quite well: Accordingly the next Morning I ſent the Nurſe out, got
up, dreſſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and went to my poor Mother; ſhe was agreeably
ſurprized to ſee me, but upon opening the Curtains, I found ſhe had a
great Caſt in her Eyes, which ſhocked me extremely, and ſhe told me, that
every thing appeared double to her; I did not give her to underſtand, that I
perceived it, but told her, ſhe looked better than I had known her do a long 
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0095100803:252"/> Time. She ſaid the Doctor had given her over: Why ſo
he did me, Madam, and yet you ſee I am alive; and if you will take my
Preſcription, I dare ſay you will make a Fibber of him.</p>
            <p>She ſaid ſhe would, and I propoſed, that my Spouſe as I
call'd Miſs <hi>C—m,</hi> and ſhe, and I, ſhould the next Morning
go to <hi>Chapel Izod,</hi> a Place about three Miles from Dublin, and ſpend
the Day. She ſeemed quite pleaſed with my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and ſent to have a
Landau beſpoke for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>In the Morning ſhe was up and dreſſed before me, and was as
ſprightly as I had ever ſeen her, tho' quite weak, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſhe
was obliged to be carried into the Machine and out again.</p>
            <p>We ſet out before Breakfaſt, and went thro' the
<hi>Phoenix</hi> Park, it was a fine Day, and we had the Landau opened; the
freſh Air vaſtly revived her, and ſhe repeated a good many Lines of the
Poem on <hi>Windſor-Foreſt</hi>; ſhe even complained of being hungry.
When we came to the Tavern, I ordered ſome Tea; and to <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0095100803:253"/>
my infinite Surprize, my Mother called for a Plate of Ham, and ſome Oil and
Vinegar, eat very hearty, and drank two Glaſſes of White-wine.</p>
            <p>The Readers may judge that I was overjoyed at ſeeing ſo fair a
Proſpect of her Recovery; ſhe after made a Shift to walk down into the
Flower-Garden, and ſeemed to enjoy the balmy Fragrance with great inward
Satisfaction. I then went in, and beſpoke Dinner, which was young Ducks, and
Green Peaſe; my Mother lay down and ſlept 'till 'twas ready, at which Hour
ſhe roſe, and eat very hearty: There happened to be a Couple of Gentlemen
in the Houſe of our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who after Dinner joined Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with us;
and my Mother told them that the Doctor had given her over, but ſhe-was
reſolved to outlive the whole Faculty. In ſhort, ſhe related twenty
agreeable Stories to our infinite En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.</p>
            <p>Little did I imagine, that our preſent Joy was only the Prologue
to the Grief I too ſoon after received. We did not leave <hi>Chapel Izod</hi>
till Ten at Night, <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0095100803:254"/> when we all ſet out in the Landau;
I know not whether the Air might not have been very fatal to her, for no
ſooner were we got a hundred Yards, but ſhe began to cough, and continued
ſo all that Night, during which I ſat up with her.</p>
            <p>We lodged at this Time in the Houſe of one <hi>Sheil,</hi> in
<hi>Phraper-Lane, Dublin:</hi> We had a firſt and ſecond Floor, for which
we conſtantly paid Ten Shillings and Six-pence a Week; the Man of the Houſe
had been a Pariſh-Clerk, and had held that Dignity under my Father for ſome
Years; he afterwards turned Farrier, or Horſe-Doctor, in which meeting with
no Succeſs, he came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> took a Houſe which he let to
Lodgers, except the Parlours and Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen, and commenced a famous Quack; I
queſtion whither the moſt eminent of that Profeſſion in
<hi>London,</hi> which I take to be <hi>R—k,</hi> ever tried more
ſalutary Methods to deſtroy the human Species, than this profound
<hi>Eſculapius</hi> had done, nor with more Succeſs; whom we ſhall 
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0095100803:255"/> hereafter diſtinguiſh by the Title of Doctor
<hi>Sheil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Wretch, who was ignorant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Conception, was a Compound
of Pragmataciſm and Hypocriſy, his Eyes were eternally bent to Heaven, with
the moſt ſolemn and auſtere Aſpect, while his Heart was perpetrating
the Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all who had the Misfortune to be thrown into his
Houſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt Inſtance which convinced me of it, was this; the
light Guineas were now cried down, ſo that People would ſcarcely accept
them on any Account. This Doctor was very particular every <hi>Saturday</hi> to
call for his Money; being the moſt avaricious Mortal I had ſeen. It
happened one Evening, that we had no Money in the Houſe but theſe Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,
one of which was very remarkable and wanted Six Shillings. This I gave him, and
allowed him the Deficiency. In a few Days after, every light Guinea which my
Mother had, ſhe ſold, and took current Guineas for them. She had exactly
five Weight ones in her Purſe. <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0095100803:256"/> One Morning that I went
out, ſhe left her Pocket hanging on a Chair; as ſhe was never
ſuſpicious of any one. When I returned, ſhe was going to ſend me to pay
ſome Caſh; when what ſhould I ſee but the light Guinea I had ſome
Days before given <hi>Sheil.</hi> The Thing aſtoniſhed me; I aſked if
<hi>Sheil</hi> had been in the Room, ſhe ſaid no, nor any Perſon
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Nurſe; this Nurſe, under the Roſe, was much addicted to
Liquor, I called her, and examined her cloſely about the Matter, ſhe
ſtrenuouſly denied her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of it; at length, by Threats and
Entreaties, ſhe confeſſed that <hi>Sheil</hi> had given her Half a Pint
of Rum to change them in her Pocket, he aſſuring her it was the ſame
Thing.</p>
            <p>I now beſought my Mother's Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to lay the old
canting R—l in Newgate, but ſhe begged, that I would let her die in
Peace, and not cauſe her laſt Moments to be diſturbed with Contention;
ſhe farther conjured me not to mention it till ſhe was either dead, or in
ſome <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0095100803:257"/> other Lodging. In Compliance to her Requeſt, I
dropt the Affair.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding her Deſire of Quietneſs, this
Blood-hound, for ſuch alone I can ſtile him, reſolved to haſten her
Exit; for the next Day watching his Opportunity, when I was out, he came up,
and with an auſtere Countenance demanded three Weeks Rent, which was that Day
due to him, ſhe told him in a faint Voice, that I was gone for Money, and
would pay him at my Return; but he ſwore he would not be trifled with any
longer; and if ſhe did not inſtantly pay him, he would turn her into the
Street.</p>
            <p>Imagine what a Shock this Behaviour muſt be to one in her feeble
Condition; ſhe could make no Anſwer, but burſt into Tears. Come, Madam,
ſaid the inhuman Cannibal, theſe Arts won't paſs on me; give me either my
Money, or Value for it, or by G—d you ſhall go out of this Lodging.</p>
            <p>She gave him the Keys of her Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and deſired him to take
any Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0095100803:258"/> he thought proper for his Security, and
intreated for Chriſtian Charity he would leave the Room, as his Preſence
was baneful to her.</p>
            <p>This was all he aimed at, ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry modeſtly helped himſelf
to every Thing that was valuable, and left the Room.</p>
            <p>I returned ſoon after, and was greatly ſurprized, to ſee my
poor Mother trembling, and pale, ſo that ſhe ſcarce ſeemed to live;
ſhe faintly looked up at me, and ſaid my dear Child, that Villain
<hi>Sheil</hi> has been the Death of your Mother; I knew I had not long to
exiſt, but ſure it was cruel to ſtab at Half an Hour of my frail
Life.</p>
            <p>I could ſcarce contain the various Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions riſing in my
Breaſt; Love, Pity, Horror, and Reſentment, reciprocally took Place, and I
ſhould doubtleſs have gone and taken his Life, but that filial Duty
withheld me from adding to my dear Mother's Affliction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0095100803:259"/>I prevailed on her to take a little mull'd
Wine, after which ſhe went to Bed; and I found on the Table theſe Lines,
which were the laſt ſhe ever wrote; 
<q> 
                  <l>My Lord, my Saviour, and my God,</l> 
                  <l>I bow to thy correcting Rod;</l> 
                  <l>Nor will I murmur or complain,</l> 
                  <l>Tho' ev'ry Limb be fill'd with Pain;</l> 
                  <l>Tho' my weak Tongue its Aid denies,</l> 
                  <l>And Day-light wounds my wretched Eyes.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſat up with her all this Night, during which ſhe ſlept
little for the heavy Cough on her Lungs; but ſhe retained her Senſes ſo
well, that ſhe entertained me with many Stories, and repeated Part of a Poem
written on Mrs. <hi>Waller.</hi> I believe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid I, ſhe's a
Subſcriber to you; Yes, ſaid ſhe, ſhe paid the Money to my Father. I
now found her Brain begin to grow defective; which gave the moſt piercing
Anguiſh to my Heart I had ever received.</p>
            <p>She doz'd a little about four o'Clock in the Morning; and when
ſhe awoke, <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0095100803:260"/> told me, ſhe had a mighty agreeable
Dream; which was, that her Father came to her in a Mourning Coach and Six; and
told her he was very angry ſhe had been ſo long ill, and yet never ſent
for him whom ſhe knew was always ready to aſſiſt her: I am come,
continued he, to bring you out of all your Troubles; and with that, took her in
his Arms, like a Child, and carried her away in the Coach.</p>
            <p>My boding Heart readily interpreted this Dream, as indeed did her
own; my Dear, ſaid ſhe, you know the Uſage I have received from your
Father, together with the Knowledge I have that there are but few good
Clergymen to be found, have ever made me declare that I would permit none of
them to viſit me in my laſt Hours, except dear Doctor <hi>Delany:</hi>
However, ſince he is from Town, and the World would add Impiety to all they
have ſaid of me, if I don't have ſome one of them, pray ſend for the
Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of this Pariſh; I accordingly did, and we all joined in Prayer; after
which ſhe fell into a good deal of Diſcourſe with <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0095100803:261"/>
him, and they drank a Glaſs of Wine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: He aſked her if ſhe
forgave my Father; and ſhe related the following Story to him.</p>
            <p>There was an honeſt <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt, on his Death-bed,
and when the Prieſt was going to give him Abſolution, he aſked the ſick
Man, If he freely forgave all his Enemies? Otherwiſe he could not
admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter that Sacrament to him; the Man replied, Arah faith, Father, I do
forgive every one, only <hi>Teddy Brenan,</hi> that poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my Cow. Nay, but,
ſaid the Prieſt, you muſt forgive him alſo, or I cannot abſolve you;
Well, ſaid he, Father, if I die, I will forgive him; but if I live, I never
can. Will that do, ſaid the ſick Man? Arah faith, ſaid the Prieſt, if
it won't do, it muſt do; and accordingly proceeded.</p>
            <p>So, Sir, ſaid ſhe, if I die I do forgive him; and I wiſh the
God whom he has offended may do the ſame; but if I live, mark you that,
Maſter Parſon, I never will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0095100803:262"/>The Clergyman departed, and in about an
Hour's time came a great long Letter, written, I ſuppoſe, at the Deſire
of Doctor <hi>Sheil,</hi> by ſome of the enthuſiaſtical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts, of
which <hi>Dublin</hi> is now the chief Receptacle in his Majeſty's
Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; it was written in their whining Stile, declaring that ſhe, my
Mother, was damned beyond Redemption; that ſhe was now on the Brink of Hell;
and that not the Blood of the Lamb could inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept her.</p>
            <p>We both laughed at this fantaſtic Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, and ſhe only
wiſhed for Strength to be able to anſwer it properly; but alas, that ſhe
never had.</p>
            <p>This Day ſhe retained her Senſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably till Evening, when
ſhe began to talk incoherently. I ſat up till Four in the Morning, at which
time I grew very heavy: What, ſaid ſhe, can't you watch and pray a Moment,
till this bitter Cup paſſes from me; a Moment, and I ſhall be no more:
Come, ſaid ſhe, kneel down, and take my Bleſſing, and the laſt Adieu.
With a Heart rent in twain, I complied, <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0095100803:263"/> and ſhe laid
her Hand on my Head, and ſaid, very devoutly, the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> bleſs you; the Father, the Son, and Holy
Ghoſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and guard you, and bring you ſafe to everlaſting Peace,
where I go a little before you; for, ſurely, my dear Child, I believe,
through Chriſt, I ſhall be happy hereafter.</p>
            <p>The Words made ſo deep an Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on my Soul, that I
could not help repeating them; and I do it more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, becauſe ſome
People have been cruel enough to ſay, ſhe died an Atheiſt; but ſurely
ev'ry Perſon, who examines her Writings, will find that ſhe was a
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Believer in the Doctrines of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianity, as taught by the
Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; the perpetual Benefit of which I hope ſhe now
enjoys. I remember in the Beginning of her Illneſs, ſhe called me to her;
and ſaid, I have a thing to requeſt, and you muſt by no means deny me,
but promiſe on your Life, your Honour, and your Soul, to perform it; I told
her, as I had not often diſobeyed her, ſhe need <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0095100803:264"/> not
be ſo particular in charging me; 'tis this, ſaid ſhe, in a few Days
you'll loſe your poor little Mother; and as you know I have no Money, your
Father un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly will bury me, and, perhaps, may propoſe putting my
Remains in his Family Burial Place; but if you ſuffer that, you have my heavy
Curſe; nay, if it's poſſible, I will come from the Grave to reſent it.
Lay me by my dear Father, and let our kindred Aſhes mingle toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for,
were I put in the Ground with your Father,<note n="*" place="bottom">She and her
Father are buried in <hi>St. Anne's</hi> Church,

            </p>
            <p>I ſincerely promiſed to obey her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. But to
return:—Between Five and Six her Breath grew ſhort, and her Eye-Sight
failed her, I went, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing her Hand, which was now almoſt lifeleſs,
aſked her if ſhe knew me: Yes, ſaid ſhe, you are my eldeſt Son, come
from the College for my Bleſſing; you might have called before, but God
bleſs you. It ſeemed as if her not being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſee him
diſturbed her laſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. She then deſired me to kneel down and pray
by her, which I did, ſtill keeping her Hand in mine, I found it grow cold,
and heavy, and looking up juſt ſaw her expire with a Sigh.</p>
            <p>I now beheld the moſt tender and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing Mother departed from
me: My only Prop and Succour gone: While I ſaw myſelf ready to be expoſed
to all the Malice of Fortune. I too well before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the obdurate
Temper of my <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0095100803:266"/> Father, to hope any Favour from him.
However, ſummoning up all my Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and repoſing my intire
Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in divine Providence, I left that Scene of Sorrow and Lamentation,
and retired to take a little Repoſe.</p>
            <p>I had ſome few Days before this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured all my Mother's
Manuſcripts in the Hands of a Friend, which was very fortunate for me,
ſince the Moment old <hi>Sheil</hi> heard ſhe was dead, he ran into the
Dining-Room, and ſecured every Thing he could lay Hands on; after which he
went to inform my Father of the long wiſhed and joyful News. He could
ſcarce credit it at firſt; but when the pious Mr. <hi>Sheil</hi>
aſſured him on the Word of a Chriſtian, that he ſpoke Truth, my Father,
with great Compoſure, ſaid it had been well for her, to have died ſome
Years ago; old <hi>Sheil</hi> aſſured him, that he believed ſhe would not
have died this Bout, but for the Fright he gave her in her Sickneſs; for
which kind Office my Father could not but thank him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0095100803:267"/>He gave immediate Orders for her Funeral,
which you may depend on it was not profuſe; he allowed her, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a decent
Oak Coffin and Shrowd, and the Nurſe-keeper told me, that <hi>Sheil</hi> was
ſo unparalleled a Wretch, that ſhe could ſcarce keep him out of the Room
while ſhe ſtripped the Corpſe, which the Moment ſhe had done, and put
her Shrowd on, he came and took the Linen in which ſhe died, and ſecured
that alſo.</p>
            <p>When I aroſe in the Morning, the old Hypocrite aſked me to
Breakfaſt with him, and endeavoured to comfort me, by ſaying my Father was
too good a Chriſtian to let me want; and that as the Cauſe of his Anger to
me was now removed, by the Death of my Mother, the Effect would undoubtedly
ceaſe.</p>
            <p>I told him I expected nothing from him, nor ſhould I, tho'
infinitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, make any Application to him; that Nature
inſtructed me to love and protect my Mother, whoſe Cauſe my Duty prompted
me to eſpouſe, of which <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0095100803:268"/> I could not be aſhamed,
ſince I would do it, were it to be done again.</p>
            <p>He ſaid I ought to ſubmit to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and write to him;
and, ſaid he, thoſe Papers and Letters you have, ſend them to him, which
will prove your Reſpect, and I will engage to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Matters ſo well
between you, that he ſhall allow you Twenty Pounds a Year, tho' he won't
ſee you.</p>
            <p>As I am too apt to be credulous, had any Perſon, but this Man,
whom my Soul abhorred, made ſuch Overtures, I ſhould have thought there was
ſomething in it; but if the Harmony of Angels proceeded from his Lips, whom I
looked on as the Murderer of my dear Mother, it would to me be hateful as the
Hiſſing of Serpents.</p>
            <p>However, I liſtened to him, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that thoſe Papers
would certainly obtain Money for me, and Promiſes were often broke; that as
to Twenty Pounds a Year, my Father would as ſoon give Twenty of his Teeth;
but if the officious Mr. <hi>Sheil</hi> would prevail <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0095100803:269"/> on
my Father to give me Fifty Pounds, I would not only reſign them, but would go
to ſome Part of the World, where he ſhould never hear of me.</p>
            <p>The latter Part of this my Father would readily agree to, nay have
given me his Bleſſing at my Departure, <hi>but not a Word of the Nine and
Forty Pieces.</hi> Indeed another <hi>pious Divine</hi> offered me a Sum of
Money to go to <hi>America,</hi> which becauſe I did not conſent to, he has
ſince utterly rejected me; but a little Time will ſhew the World his
Motives for that, and open a very <hi>unexpected Scene to the Publick</hi>; and
tho' I have not kept my Promiſe to him in making the Affair known before now,
yet I take this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of informing his Reverence that I have not forgot
him.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the Doctor (<hi>Sheil</hi> I mean) went to my Father,
and told my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; but he only laughed, and ſaid I had not my Mother's
Genius, and muſt quickly fall into Contempt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he very fairly ſet
me at Defiance; and ſhould I dare to print any Thing <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0095100803:270"/>
againſt him, he had Intereſt enough to ſend me over the Water. I am
ſorry for the diſagreeable Neceſſity I am under of ſpeaking or
writing any Thing to diſpleaſe him, but Facts may be related, I hope,
without Offence.</p>
            <p>The next Day Mr. <hi>Faulkner</hi> inſerted the following
Paragraph in his Paper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yeſterday Morning died Mrs.</hi> Letitia Pilkington. And the
Author of <hi>Pue's Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences,</hi> one of the worſt Papers pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
there, (I ſuppoſe by my Father's Direction) inſerted a very falſe and
ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Paragraph; while Mr. <hi>Eſdall,</hi> who is a Gentleman of

            <p>A few Days after I wrote the following little Piece, which, as it

                        <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0095100803:273"/>Taught me to pour my Supplications
forth.</l>
                     <l>May that tranſcendant Pow'r, which call'd you hence,</l>
                     <l>Be ſtill my Shield, my Refuge, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</l>
                     <l>Till the grim Tyrant kindly ends my Pain,</l>
                     <l>And we, enraptur'd, meet in Heav'n again.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I never communicated theſe Lines to any one; and now
tranſcribe them only from my Memory.</p>
            <p>Since, by writing this little Account, I have obtained the Honour
of ſpeaking to the Public, it gives me an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſaying
ſomething in Favour of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who I am convinced have been
miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented to them, and for which, I hope, I ſhall be excuſed, as
Self-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is the firſt Law of Nature. There are many Perſons of
ſome Note in Life, who have, on hearing me mentioned, cried, Oh, horrid Dog,
ſhocking Fellow, &amp;c. Pray, Gentlemen and Ladies, for 
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0095100803:274"/> what? Where are my Accuſers; let them name the
particular Crimes for which I deſerve thoſe Epithets, or elſe not
men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion me at all.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> I think, is the only Inſtance which
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory furniſhes us with, of a Perſon being condemn'd
for accumulated Treaſon; nay, even he had a fair Hearing for his Life: But
theſe People are for condemning me unheard, for no particular Fault, only
that ſuch and ſuch People ſay ſo and ſo.</p>
            <p>A Conſciouſneſs of this has made me reſolve to write my
own Life, by which means only I ſhall have a Power of ſetting Things in a
clear Light, and of adjuſting many preſent Ambiguities; and, though I
confeſs the Public are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with Things of this kind already, many of
which have no Tendency to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Manners of the Age, but rather vitiate
them; yet I flatter myſelf, among the Variety of real Incidents, and
whimſical Revolutions I have met with, they may find as well Entertainment,
as Matter, to moralize on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0095100803:275"/>As I do by no means aſſume the Name of a
Writer, ſo the Public may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured I ſhall never attempt Satyr; if
my Betters have Faults, that's no Affair of mine; I am to purſue my own
Story. A Man who can't put up with a Tweak by the Noſe, and a Foot in the
Rump, is not fit to live in this faſhionable World; I therefore aſſure
the Public, before hand, that I will be quite paſſive; and tho' I name the
Error, not the Man; by which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Proceeding, 'tis not improbable that by
the time I am fourſcore, I may have an Annuity of forty Pounds a Year; upon
the Hopes of which I may reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably ſubſiſt and keep up my Spirits.
And in this I ſtrictly follow the Advice of a certain great Man in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe Place of Abode is not remote from the
<hi>Phenix-Park</hi>; and whoſe Acquirements have juſtly raiſed him from
Obſcurity to Opulence; his extenſive Plans in Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have excited an
univerſal Admiration of his Taſte in Architecture. This worthy Perſon I
applied to, after the Death of my Mother; and informed him, that I 
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0095100803:276"/> was poſſeſſed of ſome Letters, which he had in
her Life-time been pleaſed to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour her with; and that as her Papers would,
undoubtedly, fall into the Hands of a Printer, I thought proper, leſt the
Publication of them might be offenſive to him, to give him this
Information.</p>
            <p>He ſent his Compliments by the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, and deſired to
ſee me the next Morning; I accordingly waited on him; and tho' my
Circumſtances were not in the flow, yet, in order to convince him that I had
no lucrative Motive in addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, I put the Letters under a Cover,
and ſent them in before me.</p>
            <p>I was then introduced to his Preſence; he received me with the
utmoſt good Manners, deſiring me to ſit: Young Man, ſaid he, I have had
a Letter from you lately, concerning ſome Writings of mine to your Mother;
ſhe was a Lady whom I regarded, on account of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Family, whom I
well knew; and therefore I correſponded with, and aſſiſted her, my
Letters you have here ſent me; and, young Man, I'll <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0095100803:277"/>
keep them; and will give you a Piece of Advice better than Gold, if you'll
follow it.</p>
            <p>There has been lately at my Houſe his G—ce the P—te
*****, and ſeveral other Perſons of the moſt eminent Stations in this
Kingdom, and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of your Mother's Writings, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced you; and
it was ſaid, that you had taken the Liberty to write to ſeveral great Men,
very much in the Stile of your Mother; they imagined, when ſhe was dead, they
ſhould have heard no more of the Matter; but you ſeem'd to keep her Spirit
alive. Now, young Man, ſaid he, conſider you are not a Woman, from whom
ev'n a Blow cannot hurt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: We tollerated thoſe Things in her, which, in
you, would be culpable in the higheſt degree; in ſhort, if you have any
Talents, as I am told you have, apply them to make Friends, inſtead of
troubling your Head about the Follies of Mankind; find out their Virtues, and
make that your Theme. Indeed, Sir, that, ſaid I, will be a difficult Matter. 
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0095100803:278"/> In ſhort, Sir, continued he, if you do not apply your
Genius, according to the Will of your Superiors, Care will be taken to ſend
you out of the Kingdom before you are aware of it.</p>
            <p>I thanked him ſincerely for his Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, which I determined
from that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to eſtabliſh as my Principle; and, on my Return thro' the
Park, upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the Affair, found it more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to ſuppoſe, that
I ſhould live by writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Panygeric than Satyr, I reſolved to try the
Experiment, and, at the ſame time, determined to beſtow random Praiſe, no
matter to me tho' the Perſon I addreſſed was tainted with the moſt
diabolical Vices, I was to form the ſuppoſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Graces from my
own copious Idea. The firſt I exerted my Talent on, was the <hi>Son of a
Baſhaw,</hi> then reſident in theſe <hi>Dominions</hi>; and one whoſe
<hi>wiſe Interpoſition</hi> in the <hi>S—te</hi> Matters of that
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> have made him ſo much the Darling of the <hi>grateful</hi>
People, and ſo far raiſed Envy on this Side the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that on his Return,
inſtead of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0095100803:279"/> he is accoſted with Sneers
and Hiſſes, where-ever he appears; while he, conſcious of his innate
Worth, ſheds a contemptuous Smile on the ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Idiots, who are
weak enough to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his ſuperior Abilities.</p>
            <p>I remembered to have heard him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Applauſe of the
Senate-houſe, for telling Mr. S—r, that as the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was far
advanced, and the Gentlemen deſirous of returning to their Seats, he thought
it beſt to p—ge the P—t till <hi>April</hi> enſuing.</p>
            <p>This ſublime Piece of Elocution was Matter enough for me, who,
from my preſent Syſtem, you'll allow was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Sycophant; I
accordingly wrote ſome Lines on the Occaſion, which were not of
Conſequence enough to ſubſiſt till this time; therefore cannot be here
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited. I waited on his L—p, and put them into his Hand as he ſtept
into his Chariot; he received them, and drove off; the next Morning I waited at
the ſame Place, till he was going out, and had the Honour of a gracious
Smile; <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0095100803:280"/> upon which, I liv'd elegantly that Day. The
ſucceeding Morning I receiv'd, What? a familiar Nod! Upon which I
ſubſiſted tollerably, till five that After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. At that Time indeed,
ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Emotion in my Stomach, gave me to underſtand, that Nods
and Smiles though conferr'd by the Sons of Baſhaws, will not fill the
Belly.</p>
            <p>The indifferent Succeſs of my firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize made me
almoſt determine, never to attempt any Thing more in that Way; though an
Affair of like Nature, which happened ſome Time before, might, if I had
common Senſe, have been ſufficient to deter me.</p>
            <p>As I was walking one Day, penſive and pennyleſs through
<hi>Henry-ſtreet,</hi> I ſaw ſome Footmen and Chairmen with White Gloves
and Cockades; and on en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the Occaſion, was told that L—d
<hi>H—th,</hi> was that Day married to Miſs <hi>K—g</hi>; I
immediately ran to a Coffee-Houſe, call'd for Pen, Ink, and Paper, and wrote
a flaming Epithalamium, which I as ſuddenly diſpatch'd, reſolving to 
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0095100803:281"/> have the Start of all <hi>Grub-ſtreet.</hi> His
L—dſhip came out and told the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, that when Mr.
<hi>Pilkington</hi> wrote better Verſes, he would ſend him a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>I was at this Time in a Window op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to his Lordſhip, who
ſaw the Man come over and deliver me the Anſwer; I took a Pen, and before
his Face, wrote Extempore the following Truth: 
<q> 
                  <lg>
                     <head>To the Right Hon. the Lord <hi>H—th.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <l>In a Coffee-Houſe hurried, and preſt by my Fate,</l>
                     <l>I wrote a few Lines to get ſomething to eat;</l>
                     <l>Perhaps, though the Subject, a Dunce might inſpire,</l>
                     <l>The want of Subſiſtence has ſlackened my Fire;</l>
                     <l>But if your kind Lordſhip, that Want will ſupply,</l>
                     <l>No Man ſhall write faſter, nor better than I.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0095100803:282"/>His Lordſhip ſent Word it was very well:
It may be ſo, thought I, but Faith I found it very ill.</p>
            <p>I could not avoid repeating the Story, in ſome Companies I after
fell into, and whether they reſented the Reception I met, or had ſome
former Pique to that N—n, I ſhall not pretend to ſay, but ſhortly
after, the following Epigram was handed about; 
<q> 
                  <l>When in proper Terms, we Dulneſs would cloath,</l> 
                  <l>We ſay you'r as dull as the Hill that's in
<hi>H—th</hi>;<note n="*" place="bottom">'Tis frequent in <hi>Dublin,</hi>
to ſay you are as ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid as the Hill of <hi>Hoath.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </l> 
                  <l>But would you give Dulneſs the Force of Record,</l> 
                  <l>Say that every Thing ſtupid reſembles my
L—d.</l>
               </q> I ſhould be ſorry, by producing theſe Pieces, to be
thought to harbour the leaſt Reſentment, for the Fate of my 
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0095100803:283"/> Marriage Poem; the Judgment of a P—r muſt ever
be Superior to that of the Inſect, called a Scribbler, whoſe Views extend
no farther than a Dinner, or a Shilling; and I only relate theſe little
Anecdotes, to ſhew that I am quite incapable of reſenting any Thing my
Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors are pleas'd to do.</p>
            <p>As this is the firſt Time I have been bleſſed with an
Opportunity, of addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the polite World, I find myſelf much inclin'd
to prate, though I already begin to fear I ſhall be cenſur'd for this
impertinent Intruſion, where I am an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Stranger; yet as I have got ſo
far, and my Publiſher, who is a Man of real Taſte, and diſtinguiſhed
Abilities, neither of which, my Printer is deſtitute of; as they I ſay,
have not yet rejected any Part of this Appendix as Nonſenſe, I have a
ſtrange Inclication to venture upon a Page or two more.</p>
            <p>I remember to have ſeen amongſt my Mother's Papers, an
Advertiſement which ſhe intended to have publiſhed in <hi>London</hi>;
and as it contains ſome Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0095100803:284"/> I here recite it as
well as I can recollect. 
<q> 
                  <p> Since it is become cuſtomary with every Perſon, to
advertiſe the Talents, they either in Reality or Imagination poſſeſs; I
have been told I have a Stock on my Hands, which is of no manner of uſe to
me, and having ſold every Thing, but the Gift of God to me, if any Simon will
purchaſe I will diſpoſe of it as follows:</p> 
                  <p> If any illiterate Divine, from <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> or
<hi>Oxford,</hi> has a Mind to ſhew his Parts in a <hi>London</hi> Pulpit,
let him repair to me, and he ſhall have a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, not ſtolen from
<hi>Barrow, Tillot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> or other eminent Preachers, as is frequently the
Practice, with thoſe who have Senſe enough to do it; but Fire-new from the
Mint. If any Painter has a Mind to commence Bard without Wit, and join the
Siſter Arts, I alſo will aſſiſt him. If any Author wants a Copy of
Commendatory Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to prefix to his Work, or a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Dedication, to
a worthleſs Great <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0095100803:285"/> Man; any poor Perſon, a Memorial
or Petition, properly calculated to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Walls of Stone and Flint
which invir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the Hearts of rich
Men, P—tes in particular; any Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller, Lines to put under his
humor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, comic, or ſerious Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; any Player an occaſional
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue or Epilogue; any Beau a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>Billetdoux,</hi> from a fair
Incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita; any old Maid, a Copy of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in her Praiſe; any Lady, of
high Dreſs, and low Quality, ſuch as are generally the Ladies of the Town,
an amorous melting delicate Epiſtle; any Projector a Paragraph in Praiſe of
his Scheme; any extravagant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, a Letter of Recantation to his Honoured
Father; any Miniſter of St—te, an Apology for his Conduct, which
thoſe Gentlemen frequently want; any Undertaker a Funeral Elegy; or any
Stone-Cutter an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph; or in ſhort, any Thing in the Poetical Way; ſhall
be diſpatched in the moſt private, eaſy, and genteel 
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0095100803:286"/> Manner by applying to me, and that at the moſt
reaſonable Rates.</p> 
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I think this Advertiſement may ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly now ſerve for
me, ſince I find I have no Means of ſubſiſting, but by a ſmall
Smattering of Wit, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>how inherent to me, to which I do aſſure
the Readers, nothing but Neceſſity could make me have Recourſe. I too
well know, that the greateſt Genius's in that Way, have been ſcarce able to
keep a Coat to their Backs; therefore if ſome generous, noble, or humane
Perſon, would beſtow on me a ſmall Annuity, which might barely ſet me
above Want, I would reſign all Pretenſions to the Pen, into the Hands of
thoſe, who by Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and native Endowments, are better qualified to
uſe it. Some Perſons of Rank who are inclined to banter, tell me they would
by no Means deprive the World of their Entertainment, by giving me a
Proviſion; but if they will pleaſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that one
leiſure-well-finiſhed Line, is of more Importance, than Volumes 
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0095100803:287"/> written in a Hurry, they will be of another Mind. If the
great Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> had been poſſeſſed of an eaſy affluent
For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, his Works, which are now almoſt buried in Oblivion, would have been
had in much greater Eſteem than they are; ſince 'tis impoſſible to
think, but a Perſon of ſo extenſive a Capacity, muſt at one Time or
other have produced ſomething excellent.</p>
            <p>And ſince I have ſaid ſo much, one Thing more, Truth,
Gratitude, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, compels me to ſay, which is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Mr.
<hi>James Worſdale,</hi> ſo often mentioned in theſe Memoirs. I'm ſorry
I'm oblig'd to confeſs, that I think my Mother carried her Reſentment too
far, in deſcribing the Character of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; but all Perſons who
have any ſuperior Qualification, have generally ſome Imperfection adequate
to it, which is done by Providence, to ſhew us, that none are perfect on
Earth. Thus we ſee, an <hi>Apollo</hi> in Muſick, a Swine in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite:
Thus <hi>Swift,</hi> unrival'd in Wit, was a Slave to Peeviſhneſs and ill
Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0095100803:288"/> which obſcur'd his Merit, in the moſt
ſocial Hour; and my Mother, who poſſeſt a pretty Manner of Writing, was
apt to fall too hard, on thoſe whom ſhe imagined herſelf injured by.</p>
            <p>However, I'm convinced Mr <hi>Worſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> never did, nor
intended Injury to her, or any other Perſon, as he is good-natur'd to a
Fault, and as he has ſaid himſelf, 
<q> 
                  <l>Anxious to gain, but not to keep his Pelf,</l> 
                  <l>A Friend to ev'ry Creature but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</l>
               </q> And this is
a Truth that I can aſſert, having liv'd ſome Years in his Houſe, which
was truly hoſpitable to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent Perſon that fell in his Knowledge,
but particularly ſuch as had any Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to Merit.</p>
            <p>What my Mother has ſaid of him proceeded from ſome little
Pique, and therefore I hope People who read it, will only laugh at her Humour,
but not ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0095100803:289"/> reflect on it, to the
Diſadvantage of a Perſon, who is incapable of acting, but with Honour,
Juſtice, and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which will be more fully in my Power to
demonſtrate, in the little Account I intend to give of my own Life.</p>
            <p>And though it would exceed the ſmall Limits I am preſcrib'd,
to apologize to every particular Perſon, pointed at in this Volume, yet I
hope they will be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane enough, to harbour no Reſentment againſt me, for
any Thing it contains, ſince I have before ſpecified the Neceſſity I
was under of publiſhing it; and as many Characters are there, of which I am
really ignorant; ſo it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to break in upon the
Connection of one Part with another, by making Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, or leaving any
Part out.</p>
            <p>There were ſome Perſons, whom my Mother was highly obliged to,
and to whom, had ſhe lived to compleat this Work, ſhe would have returned
her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments publickly; one of them was the Earl of
<hi>Clanrickarde,</hi> a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0095100803:290"/> of moſt
illuſtrious Deſcent, and one who conſpicuouſly retains the united
Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of his Anceſtors. My Mother hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrote his Lordſhip a Letter
for a Subſcription, he ſent her in Return a moſt polite Epiſtle, which
I have now the Honour to poſſeſs, in which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip promiſed
ſhortly to favour her with a Viſit, and in ſome Time he came. After
having ſat about half an Hour chatting, he told her, he had promiſed to
ſubſcribe to her Works, but that he imagined a Poem in her Praiſe,
written by himſelf, would be of infinitely more Service to her; upon which he
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered her a Sheet of Paper, and ſhe really believing him ſerious, was
about to open it. Pardon me, Madam, ſaid my Lord, you muſt not read my
Verſes while I am preſent, or you'll offend my Modeſty. She laid the
Paper down, and ſhortly after my Lord took has Leave. When ſhe
opened it, ſhe found a Draft on <hi>Dillon</hi> and Company for twenty
Pounds. I hope I ſhall obtain his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Forgiveneſs for the Freedom
I <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0095100803:291"/> here take of mentioning his Name; but I think ſuch
Actions, and ſuch alone compoſe his Life, ought not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured; and
tho' doubtleſs this is but a trivial Inſtance of the Munificence and Honour
of that worthy Nobleman, yet as my Mother was an intire Stranger, and that his
Lordſhip did it purely in Compaſſion to her Sufferings and Regard to her
Talents, ſhe ever eſteemed both the Gift, and the Manner it was given in,
as the genteeleſt Thing that could poſſibly be done: and as ſhe did not
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive to ſpeak her Sentiments on that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, I hope I ſhall be
pardoned for attempting it.</p>
