         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Talents are unequal to ſupport the Character they have
aſſumed, or whether it proceeds from an idea, that
(as of Poetical Merit all the world <hi>are,</hi> or <hi>pretend</hi> to
be, Judges) the utmoſt appearance of diffidence is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to defend the Candidates for the Laurel from
the Vengeance of Criticiſm. The Man who publiſhes
a Treatiſe in Theology, or an Eſſay on Farriery, comes
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0761700600:10"/>
boldly forward, and delivers his opinion without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
apprehenſions. But ſuch is not the caſe with
the Poet; he generally thinks himſelf obliged to ſtate,
<q rend="inline">"that the following Poems were never intended for
the Public Eye—that they were written for the
entertainment of a ſelect Circle, or (how felfiſh!)
merely to amuſe himſelf—that either the earneſt
intreaties of friends, or a dread leſt their zeal
might have tempted them to circulate incorrect
copies of his works, are his ſole motives for
appealing to the Tribunal of Public Criticiſm."</q>—Such is the general Prelude to Poems. But the
Author of this Volume is much at a loſs how he
may properly deprecate the Public Vengeance, for
having aſpired to the title of a Poet; as he confeſſedly
comes forward, neither urged by the intreaties of
Friends, nor terrified by the threats of Creditors; and
he certainly entertains no apprehenſions that his ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſtock of Fame may be injured by the publication
of ſpurious Copies, for none ſuch exiſt.—He has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0761700600:11"/>
nothing to plead in his own excuſe, but that the
Publick having without diſguſt received his humble
attempts in Proſe, he is encouraged by the Protection
he has already experienced, to appear once more as
an Author, hoping, that thoſe whom he may fail to
pleaſe, will pardon his having attempted it.</p>
            <p>To many the Peruſal of theſe Trifles will reſtore
the recollection of times long paſt. They will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered
with pleaſure, though mingled with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
which ever attends the recollection of happy days
that are to return no more.</p>
            <p>In extenuation of any Errors that may occur in
theſe Poems, the Author has only to ſay, that they
were moſtly written from the age of Seventeen (when
he commenced his Literary Career) to Twenty-four;
that at that time of life the Imagination is more
active than the Judgement; and that at preſent
he is ſo reduced by a long and tedious illneſs, as to
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0761700600:12"/>
be incapable of improving whatever he has written.
For the laſt four years of his life, thoſe hours that
have not been marked with diſeaſe have been devoted
to ſtudies of a ſeverer nature, in order to qualify him
for the practice of a profeſſion, which a Conſtitution
debilitated by diſeaſe obliges him now, for ever, to
relinquiſh<note n="*" place="bottom">Had it pleaſed the all-wiſe Diſpoſer of all events to have ſpared Mr. B's life, he hoped to have obtained ſome appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Diplomatic line, for which, as well as for the Bar, nature and education had excellently qualified him. Mr. B. never had, at any moment of his life, an idea of going into the Miniſtry—he ſaying to his friend about a month before his death, <q rend="inline">"Nothing <hi>this</hi> world has to offer could ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to go into orders whilſt it pleaſes GOD to ſpare me my underſtanding."</q> Mr. B. had from early youth been <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated</hi> to read with deep attention the thirty-third chapter of the Prophet Ezekiel, and St. Paul's Epiſtles to Timothy and Titus; and Mr. B. firmly believed, that <q rend="inline">"ALL Scripture was given by inſpiration."</q>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>From a mind exhauſted by pain and ſickneſs, ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of ſplendor cannot be expected. Had the
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0761700600:13"/>
Author ſtill poſſeſſed that ſhare of health, which once
conſtituted his firſt felicity, he might have rendered
his performances leſs deſerving of cenſure: but, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be the reſult of their publication, the writing of
them has occupied many an hour that might have
been worſe employed; and he may add, that his
having a Literary turn of mind has procured him the
acquaintance and friendſhip of many, whoſe ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Talents he readily acknowledges, and from
whoſe Converſation he has derived at once Pleaſure
and Inſtruction. Neither has an Attachment to Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as is too often the caſe, prevented his purſuing
Studies of a different caſt. From the Works of his
Friend Doctor Reid (and thoſe of other able Writers
in the ſame line), he has derived a pleaſure more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
than Poetry can beſtow. Poetry may charm with
the power of Fancy; but it is Philoſophy alone that
can ſtrengthen the mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0761700600:14"/>
As the Author's preſent ſtate of health renders it
probable that this may be his laſt Addreſs to the
Publick, he will not lay down his pen without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
to the Reviews. Thoſe Channels of Literary
Intelligence are often cenſured, as both partial and
ſevere. How far theſe charges may be juſt, he will
not pretend to determine: but he wishes thoſe who
bring the charge to recollect, that Reviewers are
men; that ſome degree of partiality is inſeparable
from humanity; and that therefore, till we are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with Reviews from above, they, like every other
human invention, muſt have their imperfections.
However, in matters of Religion, the Reviewers may
have improper biaſſes; in matters of Belles Lettres,
their opinion will in general be found to be impartial,
and by appeals from their deciſion little is now to be
gained. We live in an age when Literary Merit is
throughly underſtood; and the Volumes that are
now condemned, will derive little advantage from the
award of Poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0761700600:15"/>
Having ſaid thus much on the ſubject of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views,
he thinks it right to declare, that he has not
the leaſt perſonal acquaintance with any of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who compile them. Of his connections with
the Reviewers, in his literary capacity, he has no
right to complain. Where he has merited cenſure,
they have inflicted it fairly; and they have often
cheered him with approbation.</p>
            <p>Whatever be the reſult of their Deciſion with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to this Work, he promiſes to ſubmit without
any appeal. With reſpect to the Trifles that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
this Volume, he has only farther to obſerve, that,
inſtead of inſcribing the whole to one perſon, he has
inſcribed the ſeparate Poems to different people, as
ſlight tokens of his eſteem. For this mode of Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
though now he does not think himſelf bound
to offer any apology, poſſibly his plan may recall
to the memory of his Readers the fable of the Hare
and many Friends; and ſhould the Author fail of
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0761700600:16"/>
ſucceſs in his preſent attempt, he, like the Hare, may
experience the inutility of Friendſhip. But, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be the ſucceſs of his Volume, he will ſtill have
the ſatisfaction to reflect, that he has never written a
line, which,
<q>"dying, he might wish to blot."</q>

            <head>CHARACTER OF MR. MONCK BERKELEY;</head>
            <byline>WRITTEN BY ONE OF THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESENT
TIME.</byline>
            <p>MY firſt knowledge of Mr. Berkeley was at Oxford.
He was then a Gentleman Commoner of Magdalen Hall in
that Univerſity; and though many very reſpectable names
were at the ſame time on the liſt of its members, yet Mr.
Berkeley was ſo pre-eminently noble in his manners, ſo
faithful in his friendſhips, and ſo benevolent to his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates,
that perhaps not one of the ſociety envied his high
reputation as a man, or thought themſeves leſſened by the
acknowledged ſuperiority of his talents as a ſcholar. His
delight was in ſearching out merit; and, well knowing that
it fled from the glare of day, and ſhould be ſought after in
the ſhade of retirement, he there looked for that humble,
but valuable plant, and, having found it, tranſplanted it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
into the richeſt ſoil he had acceſs to. The ſoul of
the great Biſhop Berkeley ſeemed in every thing to have
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:21"/>
animated the body of his Grandſon, and, like him, to have
equally deſerved the juſt tribute of praiſe recorded by the
ſweet Poet of his day:
<q>"To Berkeley every virtue under Heaven."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Genius marked him in his earlieſt years for a child of her
own adoption; and had not Providence, for ſome good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
hidden from our eyes, recalled his ſpirit from the
abodes of men, when it was verging upon the years where
youth ends and manhood begins, he would not have needed
the impartial pen to have told the admiring world that he
poſſeſſed every power,
<q>
                  <l>"Whether, by various rules of art,</l>
                  <l>"To touch the ſoul, or warm the heart;</l>
                  <l>"To pleaſe the eye, delight the mind,</l>
                  <l>"With objects ſimple, pure, refin'd:</l>
                  <l>"To ſound ſublime the epic ſtrain,</l>
                  <l>"Like Falccus charm, or with the rage</l>

                  <l>"Sweet as the prophet's viſion to unfold</l>
                  <l>"What ſainted breaſts have felt, but never told:</l>
                  <l>"What Bards to us with ſparing hand have given,</l>
                  <l>"Of lib'ral gifts beſtow'd on them by Heaven."</l>

               <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0761700600:22"/>Through a long and oppreſſive illneſs, he ſupported with
unabated vigour the ſoul of the Chriſtian, the ties of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and the benevolence of the man. Pious without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation,
gay without licentiouſneſs, a poet without envy,
a man without guile. Such was George Monck Berkeley,
Eſq. now happier far in the region of his kindred ſpirits,
than all the vain purſuits of this earthly globe could beſtow
upon him.</p>

Two of Mrs. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's paternal grandſires were killed in one day at the Iſle of Rhée. Sir John Heidon and Sir George Blundell, Baronets; and the ſon of the former was highly favoured by Providence to <hi>eſcape</hi> an untimely death, by the wretched Lord Bruce's objecting to <hi>his</hi> being ſecond in that tremendous duel fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and Sir Edward Sackville, anceſtor to the preſent worthy Duke of Dorſet. Some years ago, when Mr. Berkeley viſited France, and got a letter of introduction to his Grace, then Ambaſſador at Paris, containing a very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent requeſt that Mr. Berkeley might have particular attention, his Father, laughing, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"You may plead your grandſire's <hi>merits</hi> in croſſing the ocean to prevent his Grace's grandſire's being <hi>butchered</hi> by that <hi>wretch</hi> Lord Bruce."</q> All who have read that tragical tale related by Mr. Addiſon in "The Guardian," and in the ſecond volume of Collin's Peerage, p. 196, muſt rejoice that poor Lord Bruce died poſſeſſed of a very different ſpirit from that which influenced him in life; that he, like the thief on the croſs, was called into the vineyard at the eleventh hour and a half, or rather <hi>three quarters,</hi> juſt before the <hi>final</hi> cloſe of the day of MERCY and GRACE; for his ſoul paſſed into the region of ſpirits within the hour.</note>).</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xx" facs="tcp:0761700600:28"/>
Mr. Berkeley was born at Bray, in the county of Berks,
on Tueſday, February 8, 1763, at half paſt two in the
morning.</p>
               <p>It is frequently ſaid by Biographers, that nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
occurred during childhood. Of Mr. Berkeley this
cannot be aſſerted; for, throughout childhood, youth, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and till within a <hi>very</hi> few months of his death, the
hair-breadth eſcapes of loſing life were almoſt innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
an all-gracious Providence conſtantly interpoſing, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
very remarkably, to reſcue him from death, until he
was enabled, by free Sovereign Grace, through Redeeming
Mercy, to meet that King of Terrors with joy; for he died
triumphing in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>A little before the birth of Mr. Berkeley, Dr. Cadogan's
"Eſſay on the Nurſing of Children" made its appearance,
when the depoſiting children in cradles was exploded; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
a large eaſy chair during the day was appropriated
to his uſe. When he was about ſix weeks old, a perſon
going into the nurſery in the duſk, before the ſervant had
lighted candles, ſat down on this chair; but providentially
did not ſit quite to the back, it being very deep. She ſoon
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:0761700600:29"/>
felt ſomething move; the infant, finding itſelf incommoded,
began to ſtruggle with its arms and legs. Mr. Berkeley,
from his birth, ſhewed the very uncommon ſtrength of
limbs, which, as he grew up, increaſed; and he was
eſteemed the ſtrongeſt man in England, by thoſe who were
judges. Some of his intimate friends have owed their lives,
in a tumultuous crowd, to the ſtrength of his arm, joined
to his true reſolute cool courage, where he did not wiſh to
have recourſe to his ſword. Mr. Berkeley's ſtrength was
muſcular, as his bones were remarkably ſmall; his wriſt,
ſome time before his death, meaſuring little more than ſix
inches.</p>
               <p>When he was about three months old, his mother was
attacked by ſo deſperate an ague, that it was ſuppoſed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fit muſt have proved fatal to her; yet ſo unwilling was
ſhe, that her darling, her idol (alas) from his cradle to his
coffin, ſhould be indebted for his early nouriſhment to any
but herſelf, that ſhe reſolved to attempt the bringing him
up by hand; but he had very nearly loſt his life in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
before a nurſe could be procured.</p>
               <p>At a very early period of his life he began to ſhew ſigns
of that uncommon brilliancy of parts, quickneſs of wit, and
ſoundneſs of judgement, which ſo remarkably diſtinguiſhed
him through life, even to its lateſt period. To relate wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms
of a child to any but a fond parent would be ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:30"/>
one or two inſtances, it is hoped, may, however,
be pardoned. When about three years old, he was ſearching
the houſe for his mother, whom from his earlieſt infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
he paſſionately loved. Unable to find her, he walked
from room to room, calling her. A lady, who was ſtaying
in the family, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"My dear child, what a bleating thou
doſt make!"</q> He inſtantly turned round, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"To
be ſure I do, for I am <hi>bleating for my Dam.</hi>"</q> When he
was little more than three years and a half old, he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
himſelf in the garden. A beggar came to the gate,
and, ſeeing the hall doors and windows all open, and no
one in ſight, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"My pretty little Maſter, what are you
doing here alone?"</q> He replied, <q rend="inline">"I am watering ſome
flowers for the gardener."</q> The old fox ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I think I
muſt come in and help you;"</q> on which Mr. Berkeley
flew to the gate, and bolted it, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"No, I thank you,
I can do it very well by myſelf."</q> On his maid's aſking
him why he bolted the gate, he replied, <q rend="inline">"Why, if he had
got into the houſe now that the men are out with the
coach, perhaps the maids and I could not have got him out
again."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Generoſity and compaſſion are indeed very rarely found
until inſtilled into the breaſts of very young children: in
Mr. Berkeley they were certainly indigenous. When a
child in arms, if he was aſked to give a piece of cake out
of his hand, he would inſtantly break off three-fourths of it,
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:0761700600:31"/>
reſerving only a very ſmall piece for himſelf, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
if the petitioner did not take and eat it. On re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
his orange after dinner, when it was peeled, he
would retire to the window ahd carefully ſeparate the quills,
then go out into the ſervants' hall, and force one upon
every ſervant, eight in number. One evening his mother
obſerving that he kept his left hand cloſed, enquired whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had hurt it; the ſervant replied, that he had not,
but that he had kept ſince dinner, full four hours, a quill
of his orange to give to the coachman, who had been ſent
to Windſor on a meſſage, and that no promiſes of care
could prevail on Maſter Berkeley to entruſt her with it,
adding, that he aſſured her, <q rend="inline">"it would <hi>comfort</hi> him after
his ride."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley had been told, as all children ſhould be,
that the poor had a right to a ſhare of all his money; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
the firſt bright ſixpence of which he was maſter,
he procured a hammer, and attempted to break it. On his
ſervant's aſking him what he was about, he replied, <q rend="inline">"Why
Mamma ſays, the poor muſt have their ſhare of it, ſo I
am going to break it for them."</q> This attended him to
his lateſt hour; for the diſtreſſed ever ſhared largely indeed
in every guinea he poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley's underſtanding was ſuch as often, when a
child, to occaſion his Mother to ſay, ſhe hoped he would
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:32"/>
not, in other inſtances, reſemble the famous Marquis de
Bedmar, of whom, in his Memoires, it is ſaid, he had the
power of appearing to be entirely taken up with bagatelles,
when he was liſtening to every thing that was ſaying by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
perſons, and when he was plotting the deſtruction of
Venice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley, when only five years old, would ſtand at
the window ſeat, and hum a tune, and three weeks after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
would relate two different converſations carried on at
the ſame time, and not only relate them verbatim, but take
off exactly the action and tone of voice of every ſpeaker.
Of this dangerous, however diverting amuſement, Mr.
Berkeley was early broke by his Mother.</p>
               <p>The firſt eight years and a half of his life Mr. Berkeley
had no other inſtructor than his Mother; and ſuch was the
extreme volatility of his genius, the wonderful <hi>ſtrength</hi>
of his underſtanding, and the <hi>natural</hi> wilfulneſs of his
temper, that the difficulty of teaching him to read was an
Herculean labour, ſo much as often to occaſion him to ſay,
when grown up, that <q rend="inline">"he was <hi>reſolved</hi> not to learn to
read; that he did verily believe his Mother was the only
<hi>human</hi> being who could have accompliſhed it until he
was old enough to feel the neceſſity of it<note n="*" place="bottom">A brother of the late Sir Thomas Stapleton, of Gray's Court, perſiſted in a like reſolution, ſaying it was nonſenſe to learn, until he, at thirteen, was ſent to ſea on board a ſhip commanded by Sir John Norris, who, on learning the young gentleman's ſentiments, aſſured him, that he ſhould be flogged every day until he could read. The Chaplain was appointed his Tutor. He was, after this declaration, a very apt ſcholar. This acute, worthy, young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man died at the age of twenty-two. It is ſometimes a misfortune to children to be too clever.</note>;"</q>—adding,
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:33"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"I think my dear Mother ſeemed to have been ſent into
this world on purpoſe to <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> me, as I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to, nor cared for any one but herſelf; finding that
<hi>ſhe</hi> alone had that <hi>invincible</hi> perſeverance requiſite to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
me."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Before he attained his ſixth year, he read incomparably;
and his comments on what he read, and what he ſaw, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
occaſioned the late George Lord Lyttelton, when ſtaying
at his father's on a viſit, to declare <q rend="inline">"he had the <hi>ſtrongeſt,</hi> as
well as the <hi>moſt brilliant</hi> powers of mind he had ever
ſeen;"</q> often exclaiming, as did the late learned Dr. Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Harrow School, and many other great men, <q rend="inline">"What
a <hi>man</hi> this <hi>very extraordinary child</hi> muſt become!"</q> and
Mr. Berkeley more than anſwered the expectations of his
childhood, as all the learned and great men who had ſhare
in his education bore teſtimony. His beloved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
tutor at Eton, the Reverend Dr. Norbury, too
well known in the learned world to need any eulogium
from a feeble pen, uſed to ſay, that there were wonderful
traits of originality in all Mr. Berkeley's exerciſes. On this
being mentioned one day by a friend to his Father, Mr.
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:34"/>
Berkeley, then a young man, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Ah! my <hi>dear Tutor</hi>
(as, to the time of his death, he ever termed Dr. Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury)
I do pity him. He uſed to ſtorm, and ſay, 'I
have thirty <hi>dolts,</hi> that <hi>cannot</hi> do any thing; and I have three
or four, with that idle varlet Berkeley at their head, that
<hi>can do every thing,</hi> and that <hi>will</hi> do nothing."</q> And when
Dr. Berkeley uſed to complain of his ſon's idleneſs to Dr.
Norbury, his reply was, <q rend="inline">"Sir, if your ſon would apply at
<hi>all,</hi> he muſt carry the world before him; but I muſt tell
you fairly, ſuch is his genius, that I do not believe that
<hi>man lives,</hi> who can make him apply regularly, until he
comes <hi>himſelf</hi> to ſee the neceſſity of it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The very learned Dr. Hill, profeſſor of Greek at the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of St. Andrew's, (now Dean of the Chapel Royal at
Edinburgh,) where Mr. Berkeley <hi>did</hi> apply, uſed to ſay, that
he would engage to ſelect Mr. Berkeley's exerciſe from
amongſt a thouſand, without any other mark than what
the French term <q rend="inline">"<hi>le marque</hi> d'ouvrier."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley, although he could not be called a
<hi>man</hi> of buſineſs, might with propriety be termed a <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of buſineſs, from ſeven years old; for he always felt
himſelf, as he thought, equal to tranſact any thing that he
offered his ſervices to perform. The following little inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
may ſerve to illuſtrate this: before he was ſeven years
old, his Mother, being alarmed leſt one of his front teeth
ſhould grow uneven from the old one not being removed,
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:35"/>
had ſent him to town to Hemmet, who very honeſtly ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"All would be right if let alone;"</q> and he proved that his
judgement was as great as his honeſty; for, when Mr.
Berkeley grew up, and ſometimes went to him for his tooth
powder, he often ſaid, that Mr. Berkeley had the fineſt and
ſtrongeſt ſet of teeth he ever ſaw in any head. He returned
home with a gentleman who was coming on a viſit to his
Father's. A lady of very large fortune happened to be in
the machine, going on a viſit to a friend at Taplow. Finding
that he lived in the neighbourhood, ſhe aſked him how far
it was from Maidenhead Bridge to Taplow? He replied, that
it was about ten minutes drive. She ſaid, ſhe muſt walk,
as her friends, not knowing the day of her arrival, could
not ſend their carriage. He replied, that ſhe certainly
ſhould not do that; for that his Father's coach would be
ſent to convey the gentleman and himſelf; and that he
would certainly have the pleaſure of taking her up the hill
to her friend's houſe. The inſtant he got out of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine
he enquired of Mr. March if his Father's coach was
come, and had the mortification to hear, that the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
had called to ſay, that the carriage was gone on to
carry ſome gentlemen over Maidenhead Thicket, and would
call for him in an hour. Mr. Berkeley, not then ſeven
years old, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Madam, it is very <hi>improper that a lady</hi>
ſhould walk on the high road <hi>alone;</hi> ſo <hi>I</hi> will have the
honour of walking up with you. I can borrow a <hi>ſtick</hi> of
Mr. March."</q> This <hi>protection</hi> was, as will naturally be
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:36"/>
ſuppoſed, politely declined; and the lady ordered a chaiſe.
As ſoon as ſhe alighted, her firſt queſtion was, <q rend="inline">"Do you
know Dr. Berkeley of Cookham?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Yes, intimately."</q>
                  <q rend="inline">"Do you know his little boy? If you do not, you do not
know, I very believe, the moſt ſenſible little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the world, and the politeſt;"</q> adding, <q rend="inline">"there was a
tall young man (of, I ſuppoſe, near thirty) with him; but
the dear child has twenty times his ſenſe, and forty times
his politeneſs."</q> The gentleman was a learned man, who
laughed at that pleaſing accompliſhment, politeneſs: he
was <hi>then</hi> what <hi>fine</hi> men are <hi>now.</hi> Mr. Berkeley was almoſt
idolized by the family to whom the lady was going; ſo it
appeared not ſo wonderful to them.</p>
               <p>In the May after he had completed his eighth year, Dr.
Berkeley went to reſide at his prebendal houſe in the Oaks
at Canterbury, where he was immediately ſent to the
King's ſchool, under the care of thoſe two eminent maſters,
the learned, accompliſhed, elegant Dr. Beauvoir, and
the reverend, learned, and worthy Mr. Tucker. In Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,
a gentleman's family going to France to place a
ſon at St. Quintin, to learn the language; his Mother ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
to his Father the advantage of ſending Mr. Berkeley,
who, although ſhe had taught him to read French well, yet
found it impoſſible, with an houſe full of Engliſh ſervants,
to make him ſpeak it; and as it never was the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a moment with his parents, whether any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:0761700600:37"/>
their children's education was to coſt one guinea or
one hundred, immediately determined to ſend him. Young
as he was, he was the only one of the party who knew any
thing of French; and the ſenſible amiable lady, whoſe ſon
was going to learn the French language, at her return, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that they ſhould have been half ſtarved at the inns
and hotels, had not Mr. Berkeley been with them, ſaying,
<q rend="inline">"That lovely little creature ſeemed quite inſpired; for he
began in French telling the waiters it was a ſhame to let
Engliſh ladies and gentlemen ſit there without their tea
and chocolate."</q> He uſed to run to the bar, and drive
them in before him with whatever was wanted. In his
own language, it may with ſtricteſt truth be aſſerted,
that even at that early period of life he was a great profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;
for there is not a word in the Engliſh language which,
at the age of ſeven years, he could not ſpell without book;
and of moſt of the difficult words, he perfectly underſtood
their ſenſe, and uſed them with the ſtricteſt propriety;
which occaſioned the ſenſible Sir J. Temple, brother of
the abovenamed amiable lady, who accompanied her to
France, repeatedly to ſay, <q rend="inline">"I never ſaw ſo ſenſible a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

One day, when Mr. Berkeley was about three years and a half old, after dinner he being at play in the window, a gentleman who had dined at Dr. Berkeley's ſpeaking of the unfortunate Captain B<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Roman catholic <hi>negociant</hi> of the name of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jole,
under the kind inſpection of the truly amiable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
family of Fitzou. The unfeigned affection he ever
retained for the French friends of his early youth appeared
when, at the age of ſeventeen, he publiſhed his <q rend="inline">"Maria,

his actors in that beautiful little volume from the families
with whom he lived, and thoſe by whom he was careſſed
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:0761700600:39"/>
and delighted, indeed almoſt idolized, for he had ever moſt
engaging attracting manners. His heroine took her name
from the ſervant of Monſieur and Madame Montjole, who
loved him ſo tenderly, that when he was to quit St. Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
at the age of between nine and ten, ſhe was obliged
to be ſent by her miſtreſs for two or three days to viſit her
parents, while <hi>le petit général Angloiſe,</hi> as he was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally

boys a little older than himſelf, and exerciſing them every

muſic about the town, after which he uſed frequently
to entertain them with fruit, cakes, &amp;c. His <hi>ſéjour</hi> in
France fully anſwered, as perhaps very few Engliſhmen
were ever more throughly maſters of the French language,
ſpeaking and writing it as correctly as he did his mother
tongue. On being thanked by a gentleman, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
him to take up his pen, for his elegant tranſlation
of "Nina," inſcribed to the Honourable Mr. Hobart, he
replied, <q rend="inline">"Sir, the favour was very trifling, for (excepting

               </p>
               <p>When a child at the King's School at Canterbury, his
mother uſed to riſe at ſix o'clock in ſummer, to walk with

declared that had ſhe been offered fifty thouſand
pounds not to have heard that early ebullition of that (through
life) lovely heart, ſhe would have rejected it. The ſame ſweet
ſpirit attended him amidſt all his torturing illneſs. Not many
days before his death, a poor family in diſtreſs being named,
he turned on the ſofa on which he was lying, and, not finding
in his pocket what he thought ſufficient to ſend them, eagerly
deſired his ſervant might be called, to take his keys to get
him ſome more money, to ſend to them; and, when his
mother aſſured him that they had been already relieved by
his father and aunt, he replied, <q rend="inline">"that a <hi>little</hi> more would
comfort them!"</q>

When Mr. Berkeley was between ten and eleven years
old, a melancholy affair happened at Canterbury. One of
thoſe unfortunate orphans who are ſaid to be <hi>happy</hi> in
having CAREFUL guardians, had, in the ſummer vacation,
ſtepped over from London to Paris, had there ſpent more
than his ſcanty allowance, had repeatedly applied to his
<hi>careful</hi> guardians (one, I think, his maternal uncle) for a
little of his <hi>own</hi> money. His humble ſuit was rejected.
He, however, reached Dover without a guinea; he again
applied, but in vain. Utterly unable to reach London, this
unfortunate youth, not yet nineteen, ſallied forth on
the high road between Dover and Canterbury. He unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
met with an <hi>amiable</hi> farmer and his <hi>compaſſionate
cara-ſpoſa</hi> in what is called an hurdy-gurdy. From the
former he took a ſilver-pewter watch with a greaſy leather
chain, and a fox's head ſet in braſs; from the other, about
ſeventeen ſhillings. This worthy pair drove with all ſpeed
to raiſe an hue and cry after their <hi>foot</hi> highwayman.
The poor youth returned to the alehouſe whence he ſallied
out, borrowed a petticoat of the maid ſervant, got a cork,
blacked his face, and eſcaped into a wood, where he was
taken, and in this wretched diſguiſe brought to Canterbury.
The news of ſo extraordinary a figure was ſoon ſpread; the
children belonging to the King's School went beyond their
bounds to ſee him. Mr. Berkeley ſoon returned, and told
his Mother the lamentable tale. She, of courſe, moralized
on the ſubject. Soon a violent noiſe was heard; Mr.
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:42"/>
Berkeley ſtarted to the window; then, ſitting down, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
<q rend="inline">"Good God! how can our boys be ſuch brutes!"</q>
and looked as pale as death. His Mother, who is ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted,
aſked him what it was? He replied, <q rend="inline">"The juſtices
are ſitting, and this poor creature is going to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and our boys are hallooing after him, as if
he were a mad dog."</q> It being one of thoſe days on
which the ſchool hours permit the gentlemen's ſons who
board at home to dine with their families, Mrs. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
obſerved, that her ſon did not eat at all, but leaned
back in his chair. She enquired if he was ill; he replied,
<q rend="inline">"No."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"What ails you then, that you do not eat? Eat
your dinner, I deſire you."</q> He replied, <q rend="inline">"<hi>I cannot eat
a morſel,</hi> for thinking of this poor creature, juſt gone to
St. Dunſtan's gaol<note n="*" place="bottom">At his examination ſeveral queſtions were aſked him, the anſwering of which tended to his crimination. Dr. Berkeley, who, although in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for Kent, Berks, and Middleſex, never acted, called out aloud, <q rend="inline">"Young man, do not anſwer any queſtion that is aſked you. Thank God the laws of England do not oblige any man to accuſe himſelf."</q> The youth took his advice. The farmer and his odious dame ſwore ſo <hi>readily</hi> and ſo <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> through every thing, that he was committed, and took his trial at Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and was tranſported for three years. He lived, however, to return, and enjoy a good fortune, and, no doubt, thank his careful guardians.</note>."</q> He accordingly went without his
dinner. The next day, when he came in from ſchool at
twelve o'clock, he repaired, as uſual, to his Mother's
dreſſing-room. He gently approached his Mother, and
began as follows: <q rend="inline">"My dear Mamma, I am ſure I ſhould
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:43"/>
be very ſorry to aſk <hi>you</hi> to do <hi>any thing improper</hi> for a lady
to do; but could there be any impropriety in your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
John<note n="*" place="bottom">The very worthy Mr. Wrightſon, now maſter of the workhouſe at Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, who lived with Dr. Berkeley near thirty years, and married from his ſervice, was in the houſe when Mr. Berkeley was born. He ever took the moſt tender, judicious, and reſpectful care of him in infancy and youth. A very ludicrous little anecdote might be repeated, of Mr. Wrightſon's bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a bargeman, to buy Mr. Berkeley, then ſix years old, which entirely cured Mr. Berkeley of a <hi>moſt dangerous</hi> trick, of which had Mr. Wrightſon told his Mother, the little man would have received a heavy chaſtiſement indeed.</note> to carry that <hi>poor</hi> young man a few bottles
of wine to the gaol? for my heart bleeds for him, and <hi>I</hi>
have not money enough to buy him wine."</q> His Mother
told him ſhe would mention it at dinner to his Father, who,
ſhe was very certain, would give orders concerning it.
Perhaps the poor young man owed the preſervation of his
life to Dr. Berkeley's philanthropy.</p>
               <p>At the age of twelve, he loſt his only brother, near four
years younger than himſelf, of whom he was moſt paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
fond, and whoſe death he ever lamented till he
was going to rejoin him in the realms of bliſs. As children
this was remarkable. The exquiſite beauty of his brother
attracted the eyes of all beholders, drew perſons to their
doors and windows to look at him, which, ſo entirely void
of envy was Mr. Berkeley through life, that he uſed to
come home in extacies, telling his mother how every body
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:44"/>
admired his <hi>brother's</hi> beauty. When he was about ſix years
old, a lady meeting him one day, who admired him much,
aſked him if his little brother was like him. He inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<q rend="inline">"O dear, Madam, not at all; he is a vaſt deal hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer
than I am: every body wonders at his beauty that
meets him in the ſtreet."</q> When one was about eight,
the other rather more than four years old, the celebrated
George Lord Lyttelton, ſtaying ſome time on a viſit at Dr.
Berkeley's, ſaid to a gentleman, <q rend="inline">"that he did really think,
that, mind and perſon, they were the very fineſt children
he had ever ſeen during the courſe of his life."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The death of Mr. Berkeley's younger brother, cauſed
by a dreadful fever which raged at that time in Canterbury,
occaſioned his being removed to Eton ſchool ſome months
ſooner than was intended by his Father; but his Mother,
trembling for her darling, the moment the phyſician pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
his brother's fever infectious, begged he might
be ſent away immediately, which he was within the hour,
under the care of a faithful tender ſervant, who lived at his
Father's family at the time of his birth, and until within
about four years of Mr. Berkeley's death, when he married.
For this worthy man Mr. Berkeley ever retained the moſt
grateful regard and affection, as did his Parents, for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
unwearied attention paid by him to the health, the
manners, the morals, of their ever-to-be-lamented ſon. To
this worthy perſon's care was he conſtantly confided, from
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:45"/>
the time that he began to run alone, until after he quitted
Eton ſchool, and had a ſervant of his own. Mr. Berkeley
uſed frequently to ſay, <q rend="inline">"It is not eaſy to expreſs the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
I feel towards John, for his wonderfully judicious
method of managing ſuch a refractory chap as I was,
eſpecially when I was from home, and he had not my
Mother to call in to his aid."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley, with perhaps as amiable, as lovely a nature
as ever God beſtowed on any fallen child of Adam, had a
very high ſpirit, and a very uncommonly wilful temper.
Mr. Wrightſon, by civility, gentleneſs, and ridicule, as a
child and youth could prevail on Mr. Berkeley to give up
any project to do any thing. Mr. Berkeley had a very
affectionate regard for him; and, when viſiting at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
from Oxford or the Temple, if it were but from
Saturday to Monday, he uſed conſtantly to ſay, <q rend="inline">"I muſt
go and ſit half an hour with my old friend John in his
pantry, and talk over old times, or he will think me
unkind;"</q> adding, <q rend="inline">"I am ſure I owe it to him, for the
<hi>judicious</hi> care he took of me in childhood and youth."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley's behaviour to ſervants, as ſervants, was, from
early youth, very remarkably kind; and he never had any
ſervant who would not have riſqued almoſt every thing to
ſerve and oblige him, excepting one Italian, whom he took
for a few weeks, after an old ſervant of his married. This
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:46"/>
execrable villain threatened to murder him, for having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
him to go a journey on the top of a ſtage-coach,
Mr. Berkeley having a friend in the poſt-chaiſe with him.
Such are foreign ſervants more frequently than is imagined
by the <hi>wiſe</hi> perſons who confide in them in preference to
their own countrymen, who are ſeldom tempted to rob
or murder a maſter, having no foreign tongue to ſecure
them a <hi>ſafe</hi> retreat on the Continent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley's tutor at Eton was, as mentioned above,
the learned and reſpectable Dr. Norbury, under whoſe tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he had been placed by his Father, at the <hi>earneſt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of his Mother, who knew his merits as a tutor,
having reſided at Windſor four years before her marriage,
and conceived him particularly calculated to direct <hi>ſuch</hi> a
ſpirit as her darling ſon. The event proved that ſhe was
not miſtaken; for, volatile and idle as Mr. Berkeley was,
it is certain Dr. Norbury contrived to make him apply more
than ever any one before had done, excepting his Mother,
who often regretted, that, finding what caſt of genius her
eldeſt ſon had, ſhe had not ſet about learning Latin and
Greek, that ſhe might have <hi>made</hi> him apply more cloſely
in his youth. As a proof of Mrs. Berkeley's inflexible
ſteadineſs, in teaching her ſon and correcting his perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of temper, ſhe once made him ſay the word "Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus"
<hi>thirty</hi> times, when he was about five years old,
which he either could not, or would not, pronounce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly.
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:0761700600:47"/>
When grown up, he uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"Oh! my dear
Mother, it was <hi>would not;</hi> for it was one of my numerous
trials of ſkill with you;"</q> adding, <q rend="inline">"but you were <hi>very
wiſe</hi> to do it, or God knows what muſt have become
of me!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Berkeley's grand object was to ſee his ſon as great a
ſcholar as his father Biſhop Berkeley. Never having been
at any ſchool himſelf, but coming immediately from the
palace of Cloyne to Chriſt Church in Oxford, he had
conceived that Eton collegers, if they had talents, muſt
neceſſarily be excellent ſcholars; and, after his ſon had been
a conſiderable time at Eton, boarding at the houſe of the
worthy Mrs. Tyrrell, and her truly amiable niece Mrs.
Brookland, whom Mr. Berkeley, through his life, termed
<q rend="inline">"that angelic-tempered woman,"</q> he dutifully ſubmitted
to go into the long chamber, to the extreme affliction of
his Mother, who conjured his Father, with many tears,
not to remove him; but he conſulted, and followed the
advice of, the then provoſt of Eton, Dr. Barnard, although
he had, by his accompliſhed, worthy friend, the late Dr.
Sumner, of Harrow, been cautioned againſt his wiles, in
theſe remarkable words: <q rend="inline">"Never truſt that man: he has a
<hi>black</hi> heart: I had myſelf been head maſter of Eton, my
friends in power having ſecured it for me; but, on my
aſking if Dr. Barnard was to be provoſt, and being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
in the affirmative, I, for that <hi>ſole</hi> reaſon, begged
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:0761700600:48"/>
to decline it."</q> The ſubſequent conduct of Dr. Barnard
fully juſtified the truth of the character Dr. Sumner had
given of him. Could any man but Dr. Barnard have treated
the firſt ſchool in England, over which he had ſo long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided,
and which he had, upon the whole<note n="*" place="bottom">Upon the <hi>whole</hi> ſo well; for certainly, in ſome inſtances, he was tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, even cruel, which the following well-known fact muſt prove to all impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial perſons. The late General Brudenell, deputy governor of Windſor Caſtle, being with his regiment in Germany, one day, as his lady was ſitting at dinner, her ſon from Eton came in. She naturally enquired what could bring him up at that hour on a whole ſchool day. The youth (aged between thirteen and fourteen) replied, <q rend="inline">"Why, I am expelled."</q> Mrs. Brudenell (the knife and fork dropping from her hand) exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Good God! child, what have you done? Have you killed a boy?"</q> 
                     <q rend="inline">"No, I have done nothing but called my dame's upper maid a thief."</q> 
                     <q rend="inline">"That is impoſſible, child: you muſt have done ſomething worſe than that, or I am ſure Dr. Barnard would not have expelled you."</q> The boy related the whole tranſaction, which appeared to her ſo utterly incredible, that ſhe inſtantly ſent a ſervant to requeſt a gentleman of large fortune, her near neighbour, to call on her immediately; when the youth related to him the following facts, as they proved to be: <q rend="inline">"That, having loſt his Dictionary, he borrowed one, for two or three days, of ſome boys; but, finding that inconvenient, he and two of his friends went to the ſecond-hand bookſeller's in Eton, to try to buy one. A Dictionary was immediately produced, when one of his friends ſaid, 'It is exactly like your own.' The other ſaid, 'I verily believe it is your own.' Young Brudenell aſked of whom he bought it. The man without heſitation ſaid, 'Of dame <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                           <desc> _____ </desc>
                        </gap>'s upper maid. She told me, a boy, who had left ſchool, had given it to her.' On a cloſe inſpection, there appeared a paper paſted over the inſide of the cover. This being removed, Maſter Brudenell's name, and the date of the year when it was bought at Mr. Pote's, appeared. They carried it off; and, as ſoon as they arrived there, ſhewed it to the reſt of the boys of the houſe, who unanimouſly agreed to interrogate the woman, how it came into her poſſeſſion. She coloured, and replied, that ſhe picked it up in their gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. They aſked her, if ſhe could not read writing. She ſaid, 'No.' This they knew to be falſe; but one of the larger boys ſaid, 'You muſt naturally have ſuppoſed that it belonged to ſome of us, and you are a thief; ſo they agreed to call her thief for a week. This ſo exaſperated her, that ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to her Miſtreſs, who inſtantly ſhewed Brudenell up to Dr. Barnard, the boy refuſed to be flogged until Dr. Barnard had heard his caſe; and if he did not find it true, he would ſuffer any thing he pleaſed to inflict. This he utterly refuſed, and inſtantly expelled him."</q> The gentleman immediately went down to Eton, and, on examination, every tittle of Brudenell's account appeared to be literally true; but Dr. Barnard poſitively refuſed to re-admit him—Dr. Barnard ſhewed of what <hi>materials</hi> his heart was compoſed, by his <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap> conduct to ſeveral amiable worthy young ladies in the neighbourhood.</note>, ſo well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
with ſuch marked contempt as he did, by not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:0761700600:49"/>
his ſon to be educated at that ſchool, but keeping
him at home in his own houſe, and introducing ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to teach him there, never permitting him to aſſociate
or play with the fine youths of the ſchool. A few inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
boys were now and then introduced to play with
Maſter Barnard. Could five hundred youths and boys,
ſome of them ſons of the firſt <hi>nobleſſe</hi> of theſe three king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
others ſons of the firſt ſcholars in thoſe kingdoms,
degenerate in a <hi>few days</hi> after the <hi>famous</hi> Dr. Barnard
ceaſed to govern them, that he could prefer all the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
inconveniences of an home-education</hi> for his only
child? Had Dr. Barnard been removed to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſtſhip
of King's College, <hi>ſomething</hi> might have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in excuſe for this cruel conduct to the new Maſter,
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:0761700600:50"/>
a man of profound erudition, and, before he became maſter<note n="*" place="bottom">He was well known to the Writer before he became Maſter; ſhe meeting him often at the houſe of her learned, ſenſible, throughly agreeable, lively, friend, the late H. B. Buckeridge, Eſquire; where ſome of the moſt joyous even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings—mornings of her life, alas for poor Mr. Buckeridge—were (what, as with every body, late-early hours) ſadly injured, in company with many amiable old friends and neighbours, now no more. It uſed to be ſaid, that the party would laſt a week round, but for the agreeable, amiable Dr. Boſtock, father of Sir C. Rich, and the Writer; who jointly agreed, that they could not live without ſleep.</note>,
of amiable diſpoſition and gentle manners; but Dr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,
the world at that time ſaid, meant to have a foil, as
he never could ſhew his wit without a <hi>but;</hi> which occaſioned
his bringing in that poor weak creature, Teddy Betham,
fellow of Eton.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley, being ever a moſt obedient ſon, went into
college; but he ſoon found very different treatment from
what he had a right to expect from ſome of thoſe in
power. Dr. Barnard promiſed Dr. Berkeley, that he would
ſend for him frequently, and pay every attention to the
grandſon of the great Biſhop Berkeley. Mr. Berkeley never
entered the provoſt's houſe after he became <q rend="inline">"<hi>a poor col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leger</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">The ſtyle of Dr. Barnard for the younger ſons of many gentlemen of good family.</note>."</q> His father, in order to remedy the evil, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him to ſpend two hundred pounds a year during

               <p>
                  <pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:0761700600:51"/>
It was evident, that Mr. Berkeley <hi>never</hi> eſcaped pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
when it could at any rate be contrived to inflict
it; and as a colleger, he became more liable to it. His
Father, learning this from other young men, as well as
from his ſon, offered to take him from college; but, with
that fortitude, which attended him through life, through
his torturing illneſs for the laſt three years of it to his lateſt
breath, he declined it, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"It was but for a few
years."</q> However, when he was a little turned of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
his Father, inſtead of letting him remain until nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
which was his original intention, took him home to
his houſe at Cookham, determining to become his tutor
for two years, until he went to Oxford, whither he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to remove his family during Mr. Berkeley's <hi>ſéjour</hi>
at that univerſity; and the refuſal of a houſe in St. Giles's
was ſecured to Dr. Berkeley, which was occupied by the
very ſenſible R. Harcourt, Eſquire, for the ſame wiſe and
kind purpoſe; and it happily ſucceeded.</p>
               <p>On Mr. Berkeley's quitting ſchool, in order to atone for
the want of cricket at dear Eton, Mr. Berkeley had a
fine hunter kept for him by his Father, and he generally
hunted twice a week with the buck hounds. Mr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
rode remarkably well.</p>
               <p>The village and neighbourhood of Cookham, it ſhould be
obſerved, though a very fluctuating one, happened, very
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:0761700600:52"/>
lukily for Mr. Berkeley, juſt at that time, to abound with
ſenſible, cultivated, poliſhed families; had his Parents ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
them, they could not have done it more in general
to their wiſh. Theſe families, viz. the polite Lord Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyngham's;
the learned, accompliſhed Daniel Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus's,
Eſquire; the very ſenſible Thomas Forſter's, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire;
Thomas Parry's, Eſquire; and thoſe of two
very ſenſible Ladies, in two ſmall houſes; lived in the
ſtricteſt harmony, perpetually meeting at each other's
houſes; which occaſioned Mr. Berkeley's Mother one day
to aſk, <q rend="inline">"Where is our next PARISH meeting to be held?"</q>
and they ever after retained the name. In the ſummer,
parties on the water to different parts of the banks of that
beautiful river the Thames; in the winter evenings, muſic,
little dances, and that moſt amuſing of all round games,
Pope Joan.</p>
               <p>To the above may be added, the large and agreeable
ſociety at Taplow; the politeſt of men, Lord Inchiquin,
and the Honourable, Reverend, ſenſible, and truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Mr. Hamilton, with his agreeable family, the ſenſible,
and worthy relict of General Leighton, with her accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed

Mr. Berkeley could not quit ſuch <hi>very</hi> agreeable ſociety
without a pang<note n="*" place="bottom">The "Farewell to the Banks of the Thames" was written about this time.</note>, eſpecially when part of it was compoſed
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:0761700600:53"/>
of more than half a ſcore ſuch young ladies, of whom it
may, without flattery or compliment, be aſſerted, were

laughingly to tell him, <q rend="inline">"that HE really did not know a
beautiful woman from a plain one;"</q> ſo that it became a
kind of cant expreſſion amongſt his young friends, if any
ſenſible, plain, young woman was named, <q rend="inline">"that ſhe was
one of BERKELEY's beauties."</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to return. When the time of Mr. Berkeley's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
drew near, he, very humbly and ſenſibly, requeſted
his Father to permit him to paſs three years at the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of St. Andrew in Scotland; by which time, to uſe
his own words, <q rend="inline">"All my <hi>dear</hi> idle Eton friends will have
quitted Oxford, and <hi>I</hi> ſhall not be tempted to go out
twice a week with Lord Abingdon's hounds."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When Mr. Berkeley took his laſt farewell of his amiable
friends at the Ferry-houſe, he could not articulate, went
out, mounted his horſe, and followed the carriage over
the Ferry. It was a long, and not a very pleaſant journey,
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:54"/>
to quit a beautiful native country, to adopt the language
of the poet, ſpeaking of the ſoul entering the world of
ſpirits,
<q>
                     <l>— to go,</l>

               <p>His parents accompanied him to the land of kind hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
as it muſt ever be termed by the Writer of this Preface,
where Mr. Berkeley paſſed three years and an half moſt
happily; where he formed a friendſhip with ſome of the
firſt characters in that kingdom, with many perſons of rank,
and alſo amongſt the literati, which ended <hi>but with his life.</hi>
Mr. Berkeley had the honour, the <hi>happineſs,</hi> to be <hi>enfant
de famille</hi> at Melvil Houſe; and he, with heart-felt gratitude,
termed the exquiſitely pious Earl and Counteſs of Leven
his <hi>Scottiſh parents.</hi> The goodneſs of that illuſtrious pair
not only invited him to viſit there for weeks himſelf, but
alſo to carry any Engliſh or Scotch ſtudent he pleaſed with
him. Mr. Berkeley was too judicious, and too well-bred,
to make an improper uſe of this condeſcending goodneſs,
having never introduced any but two or three Engliſhmen,
ſons of men of rank or faſhion, conſtantly ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Lord
Leven <hi>muſt</hi> know the characters of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of young
Scottiſh gentlemen too well for <hi>me</hi> to introduce them."</q>
With what delight would he often talk of the happy hours
ſpent at Melvil Houſe, and his gratitude to his honoured
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:55"/>
friend for inviting him attend him to Edinburgh, when his
lordſhip was appointed by his Majeſty lord high commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner
of Scotland, as alſo one of his introduced-friends,
the ſon of an Engliſh Peer, and his lordſhip's giving
<hi>expreſs</hi> orders, that Mr. Berkeley ſhould never dine any
one day at the purſe bearer's table, but always at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner's!
It is impoſſible to diſmiſs this article without
attempting to celebrate the wonderful condeſcending amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the <hi>nobleſſe</hi> of Scotland particularly, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with the ancient gentry of that kingdom, to ſtrangers
of any degree of faſhion, and decent character. It was a
common remark of Dr. Berkeley, <q rend="inline">"Were a Scotch gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to ſettle for ſome time in any <hi>ſouthern</hi> or <hi>eaſtern</hi>
county of England, I wonder how many peers, or men
who in <hi>fortune</hi> equal peers, would viſit him?"</q> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every peer and man of fortune in Fife have done us
that honour; which muſt ever be remembered with the
moſt heart-felt gratitude by the Writer of this Preface.
<q rend="inline">"Oh! ſhame to our <hi>Engliſh pride!</hi>"</q> uſed to exclaim Dr.
Berkeley. Although born in London, he ſpent the firſt
eighteen years of his life under the roof of his noble illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious-minded
Father in the <hi>next</hi> hoſpitable country in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope
to Scotland: for the Scotch do certainly exceed even
the Iriſh. As Mrs. Wedderburn uſed to ſay to the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of theſe pages, <q rend="inline">"The Iriſh give you an excellent dinner
and ſupper, and let you go out to <hi>ſeek</hi> a bed; <hi>we</hi> always
find one."</q> The remark was juſt, and worthy the great
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:56"/>
good ſenſe of that throughly hoſpitable polite lady, who,
having heard that Dr. Berkeley's family, none of whom
ſhe had ever then ſeen, were travelling near her houſe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ordered her beds to be prepared, and moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely
viſited them at their inn, telling them that every
thing was ready for their reception. This, and numberleſs
other almoſt ſimilar attentions from numerous other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of rank and faſhion has, for the laſt fifteen years,
cauſed the writer of this to term Scotland the Land of
polite <hi>kind</hi> Hoſpitality. Such may it long continue; and
they meet a more grateful return than they often do, when
they viſit England; than did the amiable <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<hi>hid</hi> himſelf when he ſaw the equipage of his noble hoſt in
his park—one is tempted to wonder that he ever could
emerge from his hiding place. One of the amiable ſons of
Lord Leven, coming from abroad, went to an inn at Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury
before he went to Dr. Berkeley's. He reproached
him, on Mr. Leſlie's ſaying, <q rend="inline">"He feared being trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome."</q>
Dr. Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"My dear Sir, if a <hi>dog</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Monck Berkeley uſed often to be accuſed of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
to Scotland, and to his Scottiſh friends. Indeed he
had one of the moſt amiable hearts that ever beat in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:0761700600:57"/>
breaſt. It muſt have been a <hi>very cold</hi> heart that had
not felt ſuch amiable, ſuch reſpectful, attentions as Mr.
Berkeley received in his ſeven hundred miles tour through
the unfrequented parts of the Highlands; which was chiefly
performed on foot, although Mr. Berkeley had three horſes
and two ſervants, but he often went where they could not
follow him; and at Edinburgh, where he generally paſſed
the firſt part of the St. Andrew's vacation, until the grouſe
ſhooting ſeaſon commenced. Although greatly his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
in learning, Mr. Berkeley had the honour to
rank amongſt his literary friends, Lord Buchan, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly
learned, highly poliſhed, all-accompliſhed Lord
Monboddo, Mr. M'Kenzie, and Dr. Reid. It is hoped
that the introducing here a <hi>bon mot</hi> of Mr. Berkeley's
may be pardoned. Lord Monboddo, when viſiting Dr.
Berkeley at St. Andrew's, with his uſual exquiſite po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs,
preſſed the Doctor and his family to viſit him at
Monboddo, and invited Mr. Berkeley to paſs the next vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there. Mrs. Berkeley ſaid to her ſon, <q rend="inline">"Surely you
will go: it will be a wonderful advantage to you, to paſs
ſo many weeks under the roof of <hi>ſuch</hi> a man as Lord
Monboddo<note n="*" place="bottom">Mrs. George Berkeley, from its firſt publication, was an enthuſiaſtic ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of Lord Monboddo's "Ancient Metaphyſics," ſo as to occaſion Mr. Monck Berkeley's always ſtyling it his Mother's <hi>ſecond</hi> Bible. The firſt volume
then only publiſhed, Lord Monboddo did Mrs. Berkeley the honour to ſend
her the ſecond, ſaying, he found ſhe underſtood it, with a note by the hand of the very deeply learned, worthy Profeſſor Hunter, a very ſincerely highly reſpected friend of Mr. Monck Berkeley. One of the moſt ſtriking likeneſſes ever produced by the pencil is a portrait of this wonderful genius, now in the poſſeſſion of Mrs. George Berkeley, in his robes of a throughly upright juſt Judge. It inſtantly, on en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the room, catches the eye of every ſtranger who has any ſkill in painting, and very often of thoſe who are honeſt enough to declare they have not any ſkill.</note>."</q> Mr. Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"My dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,

I am convinced, that if I do go, I ſhall return home
the beſt Greek ſcholar in the univerſity; but I have great
doubts, whether my <hi>heart</hi> may not be more injured than
my <hi>head</hi> benefited;"</q> alluding to that lovelieſt of women,
Miſs Burnett, his Lordſhip's truly angelic darling daughter,
no longer an inhabitant of this ſublunary world, but gone
to join her kindred ſpirits. That lovely young lady can be
only a <hi>very</hi> little more angelic in mind than when on
earth. Shakſpeare's beautiful diſtich on a young woman
in a country church-yard in Glouceſterſhire might have
been inſcribed on the monument of Eliza Burnett, rather
than on that of Eleanor Freeman:
<q>
                     <l>"Reſt here, bleſt Maid, and wait th' Almighty's will;</l>
                     <l>"Then riſe unchang'd, and be an Angel ſtill."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps very few females, in any age or country, have
united ſo much beauty, good ſenſe, and amiableneſs of

the lovely Miſs Burnett. She poſſeſſed all her honourable

delicacy and genuine humility of her very lovely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
She ſaw, ſhe could not <hi>but ſee,</hi> herſelf the idol of
all the young men; yet not one air of ſuperiority, not a
grain of affectation, ever appeared in her conduct. A va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of diverting little anecdotes of the univerſal deſire of
the young gentlemen ſtudents of St. Andrew's to appear
agreeable, at leaſt not diſagreeable, to Miſs Burnett, might
be related by the writer, to the amuſement of the reader.</p>

                  </gap>, Eſquire, one of thoſe few Laymen, as
Dr. Berkeley uſed to obſerve, who kept up their claſſical
learning after they had quitted the univerſity, (for he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
redde Greek from four to ſix hours every day,) was
a great admirer of the riſing genius of Mr. Berkeley, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he became ſincerely attached to him; and Mr.
Berkeley ever retained a moſt affectionate grateful regard
for this gentleman's condeſcenſion, as he termed it, in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
a youth from ſchool to enjoy ſo much of his ſociety,
who had children elder than Mr. Berkeley.</p>
               <p>As the families lived in the greateſt intimacy, in the
happieſt friendſhip, they generally met three or four times a
week. One evening, at Dr. Berkeley's, the barenneſs of newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers
was, as was <hi>then</hi> uſual, I think, everywhere lamented;
<q rend="inline">"nothing worth reading in them."</q> Mr. Berkeley reached
out his arm, and taking Dr. Berkeley's conſtant paper, the
St. James's Chronicle, ran his eye over it, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I think

there is ſomething in this to-day;"</q> and began reading
ſomething, which laſted about ten minutes, that every body

                  </gap> deſired
permiſſion to take it home, ſaying, he would return it in

Berkeley's, telling him, <q rend="inline">"that he believed he had taken

read the evening before."</q> Mrs. Berkeley ſhewed him all
the laſt papers, but in vain. At dinner, Mrs. Berkeley aſked
her ſon, <q rend="inline">"out of what paper he had read the evening before;

It muſt, however, be obſerved, in order to do juſtice to
Mr. Berkeley's gratitude for the numberleſs polite, amiable,
friendly attentions received from every rank in that land
of kind hoſpitality during his three years and a half <hi>ſéjour</hi>
there, that he was almoſt broken-hearted at quitting it,
and twice after reviſited it, and would have continued to
do ſo had his life been ſpared. Dr. Berkeley being at that
time in an indifferent ſtate of health, the journey was about
ſix weeks in performing, as he reſted ſome time at York;
where Mr. Berkeley had, what he ever eſteemed an honour,
young as he was, of commencing an acquaintance with
the truly learned and pious Dr. Burgh, by the polite atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Mother's reſpected friends, Mrs. Moritts<note n="*" place="bottom">Every perſon of any faſhion, who viſits York, endeavours to obtain an introduction to thoſe ſenſible cultivated ladies; the many only to gratify their eyes with a ſight of the exquiſitely fine <hi>paintings in needle-work</hi> of the eldeſt Mrs. Morritt; thoſe who are capable of reliſhing refined converſation, to feaſt their minds: the houſe of thoſe excellent ladies being the general rendezvous of every one who can reliſh the charms of refined converſation. Mr. Berkeley lamented that his <hi>living</hi> idol, as Gray was his dead one, amongſt poets, Mr. Maſon, was abſent from York at that time.</note>,
whoſe beautifully adorned houſe is admired by all perſons
who have any ſkill in painting. By the very polite atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Dean of York, his Lady, and ſeveral other
families of faſhion, which were ever moſt gratefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered,
Mr. Berkeley and the family paſſed their time
moſt agreeably in that antient city, to which the library of
the very civil Mr. Todd contributed in no ſmall degree,
one of the delights of Mr. Berkeley's life being to read in
<pb n="liv" facs="tcp:0761700600:62"/>
a library; a happineſs he enjoyed in his Father's houſe,
Biſhop Berkeley's library being valued at two thouſand
pounds at the time of his death. Dr. Berkeley, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed,
reſted ſome time at Newcaſtle.</p>
               <p>In their road to Edinburgh, they paſſed through the town
of Lauder. A very little way out of the town ſtands Lauder
Caſtle, one of the ſeats of the late worthy Earl of Lauderdale.
As the horſes were to bait at leaſt two hours, Mr. Berkeley,
after dinner, went down to the caſtle; the family being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
he requeſted the porter to permit him to enter, and look
at the pictures. He had from his childhood a wonderfully fine
eye for painting. It is probable he owed it to the ſo often
hearing the merits and demerits of his grandfather's col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of pictures talked over. The man, who was a tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
and hard at work, ſaid he would call his <hi>gewd weef</hi> to
ſhew him the caſtle.</p>
               <p>It is hoped the reader will pardon the introducing a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue

               <p>During this dialogue a young woman entered, with her

enquiry, and was very civilly informed. The young woman,
having diſpatched her buſineſs with the tailor, went away;

               <p>About three years after, Mr. Berkeley accompanied his

returned by Lauder, when they, together with their learned
lively tutor, Mr. Bruce, whom they agreed to treat with a

aſked the <hi>gewd weef,</hi>

<q rend="inline">"Aye, that I have; and he gave me <hi>half a croon.</hi>"</q> Mr.
Berkeley, at his ſecond viſit, doubled the bounty, and uſed
frequently to laugh with his friends, and ſay, that he had

caſtle, he made a ſong, entitled, "The Laſs of Lauder,"
and had it ſet to muſic by Mr. Jenkins, the muſic-maſter
at St. Andrew's, but now a teacher of that ſcience in
London. Mr. Berkeley uſed jocularly to remark, <q rend="inline">"It is
very certain, that I had not made ſo <hi>favourable</hi> an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
on the <hi>laſſey</hi> as I had on the <hi>gewd weef</hi> at Lauder;
for ſhe ſtayed only to ſettle her buſineſs with the tailor,
and then went off."</q> Some years after, Mr. Berkeley,
being on a viſit at Peten-Weem, and going with his friend
to drink tea at a gentleman's houſe, was aſked, <q rend="inline">"If he had
not once been at Lauder caſtle?"</q> He replied, <q rend="inline">"I have
been twice there."</q> The female who aſked the queſtion
ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I had the honour of ſeeing you there, Sir; and I

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley, from his youth, from his Mother, was an <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary</hi>
admirer and ſtrenuous advocate for the unfortunate
INJURED Mary, and a deteſter of her cunning, cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor
Elizabeth, requeſted his Father to go to St. Andrew's
by the road of Kinroſs, that he might viſit the caſtle of
Loch-Leven; and he ſpent ſome time in wandering about
the ruins; ſo much as occaſioned his and his ſervant's being
benighted on a heath, to the extreme diſtreſs of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was then unacquainted with the exquiſite, the
amiable hoſpitality of the Scottiſh nation, high and low,
rich and poor; for Mr. Berkeley could with difficulty force
a ſhilling into the hand of a man who went a quarter of a
mile over the heath to put him in the road to Cupar-in-Fife,
where his family were to ſleep that night, and it was
very late before he and his ſervant arrived there.</p>
               <p>The next morning they all ſet out for St. Andrew's, about
eight miles diſtant; and enjoyed, the proſpect from the top of
the hill, of the <hi>ſtill</hi> magnificent cathedral, and the tower

On entering the city at the Argyle Port, your
eye is greeted with a noble wide ſtreet, one mile in
length, and at the lower end of a noble breadth, with ſtone
houſes, moſt of them disfigured by what is termed a <hi>fore
ſtair,</hi> that is, an open ſtair caſe, on the outſide, in a zigzag
manner acroſs the front of the houſe, and an huge <hi>ſmidie,</hi> a
not inelegant name for a filthy thing, a dunghill; no court,
no paliſade, no breaſt-wall or railing, before even the beſt
houſes, excepting only what was once the palace of James
the Firſt of England; but it is not meant here to give an
imperfect deſcription of this once beautiful magnificent city,
which has been ſo well done by Boſwell and Pennant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
John Knox <hi>preached</hi> it into ruins, by removing an
archbiſhop, dean, and eight reſident prebendaries, who fed
the hungry, clothed the naked, and adminiſtered to the
wants of the ſick and needy, who are all now ſtarving. On
a full ſight of this dreary deſerted city, Mr. Berkeley wept
to think that he was to remain, if God ſpared his life, three
long years in it. The houſe taken for Dr. Berkeley's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
the beſt then to be had in the town, was without
even a back door, the covetous wretch who owned it having
ſold a little ſpot behind it to a gentleman at the next houſe;
ſo the door was ſtopped up. Dr. Berkeley, ſeeing Mr.
Berkeley ſo deeply affected, and Principal Watſon, whoſe
learning had induced him to prefer St. Andrew's to a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
univerſity, having died a very few days before, made
Mr. Berkeley the offer of returning to England the next
<pb n="lxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:70"/>
day; for which he felt great gratitude, but, with his wonted
ſtrength of mind, declared, that, let him ſuffer what he
might, he would remain his three years. It is but juſtice
to ſay, that Mr. Berkeley ſhed more tears at leaving St.
Andrew's, than he drew ſighs at entering it.</p>
               <p>So deeply was ſubmiſſion to <hi>lawful</hi> authority engraven
on Mr. Berkeley's mind, that during the three years and a
half he was a ſtudent at the univerſity of St. Andrew, he
never would go out for even two or three nights to his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
truly amiable friend the Earl of Leven's, at Melvil
Houſe, without going to <hi>aſk leave out,</hi> as it is termed, of
the Principal Dr. M'Cormick, whom Mr. Berkeley always
called, <q rend="inline">"our polite, amiable Principal;"</q> or, in his abſence,
of the Profeſſor, who uſed politely to ſay, that, <q rend="inline">"he living
in his Father's houſe, it was needleſs to trouble himſelf."</q>
His conſtant reply was, that <q rend="inline">"the ſtatutes, which he had
promiſed to obſerve, <hi>enjoined</hi> it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is hoped that the relation of a little adventure which
Mr. Berkeley met with during his reſidence at St. Andrew's
may be pardoned. A very few days before the term began
in autumn, Mr. Berkeley, who was at that time a very
keen ſportſman, was told by the ſon of the Profeſſor of
Medicine, a very ſenſible young man, now ſettled in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,
that, if he wiſhed it, he could lead him to a place
where Ptermagants abounded. The youths ſet out,
<pb n="lxiii" facs="tcp:0761700600:71"/>
marched ſeveral miles; night overtook them, and they
wandered in a very dark evening, unable to find the road.
At length the moon began to appear, and preſented to
their view a figure all in white. Mr. Berkeley ſoon learnt
to ſpeak Scotch ſo perfectly, as at any time throughout his
life, to be miſtaken, whenever he wiſhed it, for a true
Scot; which often amuſed his friends, or ſtrangers, of that
country, which his Mother ever termed <q rend="inline">"<hi>The Land of kind
Hoſpitality;</hi>"</q> a proof whereof will ſoon appear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley accoſted the young woman with, <q rend="inline">"Laſſey,
whither gang ye?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Laſſey.—<q rend="inline">"To yonder houſe, Laddie.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"Can we get lodging there to night?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Laſſey.—<q rend="inline">"Hoo can ye aſk that queſtion with theſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
in your hands? They <hi>muſt</hi> lodge ye.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"God forbid that we ſhould attempt to <hi>force</hi>
any one to lodge <hi>us;</hi> and, to convince you how harmleſs
we are, I will inſtantly diſcharge my piece."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley immediately fired off a fine double-barreled
gun, and requeſted his friend to follow his example. They
then eſcorted the nymph about a quarter of a mile to the
houſe; where Mr. Berkeley refuſed to enter until permiſſion
was obtained by their kind guide, who went in alone. In
a minute out ruſhed <q rend="inline">"a bevey of fair nymphs,"</q> more than
<pb n="lxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:72"/>
twenty, with a matron in the rear, who very wiſely began
examining them, how they came on that wild heath at
that hour; who, and what they were. Mr. Berkeley, being
ſpokeſman, aſſured them that they were honeſt young men,
ſtudents of St. Andrew's. Still they were diſtruſted.</p>
               <p>At length, fortunately for them, a young woman eſpied a
youth in the highland dreſs, and, going up to him, aſked
<q rend="inline">"Who he was?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Servant.—<q rend="inline">"Who? why I am ſervant to that tall gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Young Woman.—<q rend="inline">"And who is he?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Servant.—<q rend="inline">"Who? why Mr. Berkeley, ſecondary at St.
Andrew's.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Young Woman.—<q rend="inline">"Where does he come from, to keep
a ſervant at college?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Servant.—<q rend="inline">"Why, from England."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Young Woman.—<q rend="inline">"From what part of England?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Servant.—<q rend="inline">"Why, from Canterbury. My Maſter's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is one of the Prebendaries there, and is a gentleman
of <hi>great</hi> family."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley uſed to laugh when relating this converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſay, <q rend="inline">"All M'Nicoll's account of my Father's <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
in the <hi>church</hi> availed <hi>me no more</hi> than they will do in
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:73"/>
the world of ſpirits."</q> But luckily ſome one aſked Mr.
Berkeley's highlander, <q rend="inline">"Who was his maſter's companion?"</q>
to which he, being irritated, replied, <q rend="inline">"What does that
ſignify? He is ſon to Dr. Flint of St. Andrew's."</q> The
magical name of Flint, as Mr. Berkeley uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"acted
like a charm."</q> Dr. Flint is a moſt incomparable phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.
Mr. Flint was immediately examined and <hi>croſs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;</hi>
and it was determined to admit them, they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
up their guns to the nymphs. Mr. Berkeley, with
his uſual elegant gallantry, inſtantly delivered his into the
hands of their kind guide. They then went into the
houſe, being almoſt ſtarved with cold, and ſadly tired. Plenty
of food, and a good fire, ſoon re-animated them. Still
they ſaw nothing but females, all clothed in white. No
male appeared. The men were attending the corn. At
length, they all agreed, that it was time to ſet off—me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
news, as Mr. Berkeley uſed to ſay, to a couple of
young men. Whither were they to go? <q rend="inline">"Could not the
beaux eſcort them,"</q> they replied, <q rend="inline">"to a neighbouring har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt-home,
to a dance?"</q> Mr. Berkeley, who was a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
fine dancer, and loved it exceedingly, jumped up, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
all the fatigues of the day, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"that he and his
friend would attend them."</q> Their hoſpitable and very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
hoſteſs replied, <q rend="inline">"Oh, Sir! it is not ſuch a ball as you
have been uſed to in England; there will be only far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'
daughters. I will have the pleaſure of endeavouring
to entertain you and Mr. Flint here."</q> Mr. Berkeley,
<pb n="lxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:74"/>
with his uſual engaging politeneſs, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"There will be
<hi>your</hi> daughters, Madam, and our kind conductreſs to your
hoſpitable roof."</q> The young men went and danced in
the barn till four in the morning; ſlept ſoundly, as may be
gueſſed, until near noon; took an excellent <hi>Scotch</hi> break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,
(even Dr. Johnſon liked the <hi>breakfaſts</hi> in Scotland;)
and, after inviting his kind hoſteſs and her ſon to dine at
his Father's houſe in St. Andrew's, when either buſineſs
or pleaſure called them to that ancient city, took their
leave. The young man went once or twice to Dr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's.
Mr. Berkeley, who was born with what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
but often falſely, called a princely ſpirit, although
not to a princely fortune, did not think a few grateful
ſpeeches an adequate return for being reſcued from ſleeping
among the heather on the heath; but ſent his worthy landlady
ſome fine prints, elegantly framed and glazed, to adorn her
parlour, with which he had great pleaſure in finding ſhe
was much delighted. Some of Mr. Berkeley's intimates
among the ſtudents laughed at him, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Now, Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
<hi>you</hi> have lain out a night without leave."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The great Charles Leſlie, the famous controverſial writer,
uſed to ſay of Mr. Berkeley's maternal great-grandfather,
the celebrated Francis Cherry, Eſquire, of Shotteſbrooke
Houſe, in Berkſhire, that he believed him to have the moſt
accurate, the ſoundeſt judgement, that God had, in theſe
latter days, beſtowed on man. A multitude of inſtances
<pb n="lxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:75"/>
might be adduced to prove, that although Mr. Berkeley in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited
but little of Mr. Cherry's immenſe fortune, he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
did of a better portion than money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley, on his return from his highland tour, told
his family, that he might, he believed, have lived ſeven
years there, on the merits of the ring ſent by the old Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
de St. George to Mr. Cherry, when he ſent Mr. Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
at his own expence, to Rome, to try to convert him
from Popery. Mr. Leſlie wrote Mr. Cherry word from
Rome, that an attempt to make the ſun riſe in the WEST
would be equally ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He felt a <hi>little</hi> aſhamed, that the
ring ſhould be <hi>ſo</hi> well known in the Highlands, and that
<hi>he, the preſumptive heir to it,</hi> had never ſeen it more than
once or twice in his life."</q> He requeſted his Mother and
Aunt to gratify him with a ſight of it, that he might be
able in future to give a <hi>better</hi> account of the famous relic.</p>
               <p>It has been already obſerved<note n="*" place="bottom">See before, p. xix.</note>, that one of Mr. Berkeley's
friends uſed to tell him, <q rend="inline">"that he was as extraordinarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
by his Mother's ſide<note n="†" place="bottom">William Cherry, Eſquire, known by the name of the Great Lawyer, ſon of Sir Francis Cherry, eſteemed the acuteſt counſellor of his time, as the learned Earl of Clarendon bears teſtimony in his Papers and Letters publiſhed by Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney about thirty years ago. In one of the letters he ſays, <q rend="inline">"I have had the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the attorney and ſolicitor general on my cauſe; but I <hi>cannot reſt</hi> ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied till I hear what old Cherry ſays about it."</q> Mr. Cherry was at law with King James when he fled. A conſiderable part of Shotteſbrooke eſtate lies in Windſor Foreſt. Mr. Cherry had planted ſome young trees, and was incloſing them. The King rode by, and aſked the labourer, <q rend="inline">"Who bid him do it."</q> He anſwered, <q rend="inline">"My Maſter, pleaſe your Majeſty."</q> 
                        <q rend="inline">"It does <hi>not</hi> pleaſe me,"</q> replied the King; <q rend="inline">"and <hi>I</hi> order you to throw up the incloſure directly."</q> He did ſo. Mr. Cherry's old ſteward informed his Maſter immediately of it; who ordered that the ſame labourer ſhould directly ſet about incloſing it again. The next hunting-morning his Majeſty found him at work, and aſked, <q rend="inline">"How he dared to do what he had forbidden him to do?"</q> He replied, <q rend="inline">"His Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had ordered it."</q> The King commanded him to undo his work at his peril; which the poor fellow did; and Mr. Cherry, who when in the country acted as a juſtice of the peace, committed him to Reading gaol, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced a ſuit againſt the King. Luckily for this poor man, he could not only read, but write; being clerk of the pariſh of White Waltham, where, and in many ſurrounding pariſhes, Mr. Cherry had large farms, and always found and made his tenants find work for the induſtrious labourers. When the poor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent culprit reached the gaol, he wrote a long and intereſting letter to the King, telling his Majeſty, that as his good old Maſter had now turned him off from his work for obeying him, he hoped his Majeſty would be pleaſed, in his <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> to ſend him ſome money to keep him <hi>comfortably</hi> in gaol; and, after much more curious matter, ſubſcribed himſelf <q rend="inline">"his Majeſty's poor, pitiful, patient, lamentable ſervant, JOHN HONE."</q> This letter reached the King about three weeks before he left the kingdom, when Mr. Cherry immediately liberated honeſt John, and took care that he had every comfort during his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment; Mr. Cherry having ſent the man to gaol only to teach the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch what he might <hi>not</hi> do. Mr. Berkeley had for ſome years been writing a treatiſe on "The Prerogatives of the Crown;" and one volume was ready for the preſs at the time of his death. How far he would have approved his anceſtor's conduct in this matter is uncertain. This tranſaction is ſomewhat differently told in the old ballad of "The King and Mr. Cherry." This gentleman was killed by the overturning of his chariot as he was going down a hill in Kent, near the ſeat of the grandfather of the late worthy Sir Sidney Stafford Smythe, by whom, and his lady, every humane, amiable attention was paid him that his deſperate ſituation would admit of. His death was the more to be lamented by his excellent ſon, as, on the coroner's inqueſt, it appeared to have happened through roguery, the verdict being, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Killed by the footboard having been mended with old ruſty nails.</hi>"</q> On going down the hill, the coachman of courſe preſſing more on the footboard than on even ground, it gave way, and he fell down among the horſes; who immediately ran away in half a dozen different direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, threw off the poſtillion, and broke the chariot entirely to pieces. When they ſtopped, it was a quarter of an hour before Mr. Cherry's valet de chambre, who was attending his Maſter on horſeback, could diſcover life either in his Maſter, Mr. Partridge, of the Iſle of Ely, to whom Mr. cherry was guardian, or any of the ſervants. The moment he found his Maſter was not dead, he rode off to town, to carry down the Queen's ſerjeant-ſurgeon, and ſent off from London an expreſs to Mr. Cherry at Shotteſbrooke. On the arrival of the ſurgeon, he aſked Mr. Cherry, <q rend="inline">"Where he felt pain?"</q> He replied, <q rend="inline">"Ah! Sir! where do I <hi>not</hi> feel pain?"</q> A piece of the plate glaſs of the chariot was taken out of his head as large as the palm of a man's hand. Mr. Cherry lived only four days after the accident, the ſurgeon ſaying, <q rend="inline">"He is the nobleſt ruin I ever ſaw. I never beheld ſuch a man of eighty-three: but for this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, he would probably have attained to the age of old Parr."</q> Mr. Cherry's ſtrength of body and mind were equal at eighty-three to what they were at thirty-three. This account of Mr. Cherry's death, and Mr. Partridge's almoſt miraculous eſcape, is very differently and very erroneouſly related in a work printed about ſeventy years ago, by a gentleman of fortune in Devonſhire. Mr. Cherry's lady's father, John Whitefield, Eſquire, of Ives Place, near Maidenhead, was thrown from his horſe, and drowned in the Thames, when taking an airing one evening near his own houſe, at an advanced age. Mr. Berkeley's Mother's paternal grandfather was killed by a fall from his horſe, as he was riding one morning near his own houſe, at the age of eighty-one. The lady of the celebrated Francis Cherry, Eſquire, the patron of Thomas Hearne, one of his under-footmen, was the eldeſt of the five co-heireſſes of John Finch, Eſquire, of Fienes Court, Berks. In the cloaths of this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was King Charles the Second dreſſed, when he eſcaped with Lady Jane Lane.

not to call on any friend, Engliſh or Scottiſh, whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
it might injure, the certain conſequence being expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from the univerſity; went to Mr. Price, who owed no

<q rend="inline">"He was entirely at Mr. Berkeley's ſervice; but hoped
the matter might be accommodated without fighting."</q>
Mr. Berkeley aſſured him, <q rend="inline">"<hi>that was impoſſible.</hi>"</q> They
therefore proceeded to the place, where this wiſe young
gentleman again urged the matter ſo ſenſibly, ſo eloquently,
that Mr. G<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap> offered to make any ſubmiſſion that Mr.
Berkeley ſhould require. Mr. Berkeley from his infancy,
although a little fury, was ſurely the moſt ready to pardon
of all the fallen children of Adam; inſomuch that his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"That if any one murdered him, and he
lived only three minutes, he would <hi>freely</hi> forgive them;"</q>
conſtantly adding, <q rend="inline">"Alas! he does not inherit that from

brutal raſcality of, <q rend="inline">"I may ſay whatever I pleaſe, for you
DARE not fight,"</q> &amp;c. that for once he appeared inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The ground was meaſured, the piſtols were delivered,
and the ſwords laid ready, when Mr. Price, inſtead of
giving the word to fire, ſtepped in between the combatants,

this frightful affair ended. But not the gratitude of Mr.

Berkeley and his parents. Providence had placed Mr.
Price in a ſituation to render other return than polite and
friendly attentions out of the queſtion. When Mr. Price
went to France, they felt unfeigned pleaſure in giving him
letters of introduction to ſeveral very worthy French fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies

               <p>It may, perhaps, be aſked by ſome, <q rend="inline">"With all theſe

                     <p>It is impoſſible here to avoid relating an anecdote of Mr. Berkeley's celebrated learned grandfather.</p>
                     <p>Biſhop Berkeley, walking down Pall Mall, with his darling friend Biſhop Benſon (whom he uſed to call Titus, <q rend="inline">"the delight of human kind,"</q>) there ruſhed out of the Star and Garter four or five <hi>very witty bucks</hi> of that day. One exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"A brace of Biſhops!" (the biſhops then wore purple coats:) "let us put them up."</q> Biſhop Benſon, being a much lighter man than Biſhop Berkeley, inſtantly ran off to the oppoſite ſide of the way. The Wits immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately made a circle, and incloſed poor Biſhop Berkeley, whom they thus <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily</hi> accoſted, <q rend="inline">"Pray, my Lord, what does your Lordſhip think of King Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid? David loved a pretty girl, my Lord."</q> 
                        <q rend="inline">"Gentlemen, I think that King David was a <hi>very great ſinner,</hi> as <hi>you</hi> and <hi>I</hi> are; but God gave him grace to repent of his ſin, as, <hi>I ſincerely hope,</hi> he will to YOU and ME."</q> They all ſlank off, like <hi>pitiful fools,</hi> excepting one, who ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I humbly, heartily be your Lordſhip's pardon."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame very ready and pointed wit Mr. Berkeley ſhewed on a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent occaſion. When introduced to the late Lord Mansfield by his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's deſire, he eyed him about half a minute; when Mr. Berkeley expected him to ſay, what many lords and learned men had often ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"that they were happy to ſee the grandſon of their excellent old Friend,"</q> Lord
Mansfield ſaid,
<q>"To Berkeley every virtue under heaven."</q>
Mr. Berkeley inſtantly replied,<q>"How ſweet an Ovid was in Murray loſt."</q>
Lord Mansfield ſaid, <q rend="inline">"You are, Sir, a very polite young gentleman, indeed. Aye, Sir, Mr. Pope was very partial to me;"</q> took Berkeley under the arm, and walked off with him. All Tunbridge talked of Mr. Berkeley's ready wit. Some of Mr. Berkeley's friends, on hearing it, ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"Berkeley, we are afraid the old Prelate was a Foreſtaller, and has left none of theſe VIRTUES to you."</q>
                     </p>

grace <pb n="lxxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:84"/> to repent, and mercy to conſole his throughly
humbled, penitent, contrite ſpirit. Mr. Berkeley had not ſufficiently
attended to that admonition of the Wiſe King,
<q rend="inline">"Uſe not much the company of a woman that is a

Mr. Berkeley, reflecting on his thoroughly pious education and many other
advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, conſidered himſelf as a much greater ſinner than any of his
young friends, who had not been ſo favoured by Providence, could poſſibly
be. But it pleaſed the God of Mercy to ſpeak peace to his wounded ſpirit;

Iſaiah xxxviii. 5; and, for ſome weeks before his death, to pour the balm

But to return. To ſay that Mr. Berkeley's ſervants
loved him, is too feeble an expreſſion. His own, and the
ſervants of his Father's family, in general old in his ſervice,
almoſt idolized him. His generoſity, his condeſcending
goodneſs to the meaneſt ſervant in the houſe, was ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging,
that joy enlivened every countenance whenever he
viſited at his Father's. He had been very early taught,
that, although it had pleaſed Providence to place him in a
different ſtation of life from his Father's ſervants, yet that
he muſt ever treat them with kind civility. He and his
brother were always made, whilſt children, to take off their
hat to the loweſt peaſant and waſher-woman who paſſed
them in the village: and ſo habitual was it to Mr. Berkeley
to be <q rend="inline">"<hi>courteous to all men,</hi>"</q> that when he gave orders to
his ſervant, a ſtranger to him would not have ſuppoſed he
had been ſpeaking to his own domeſtic; yet, wonderful to
relate, he had one ſervant, who actually had a deſire to
lie in wait to murder him: but he was an Italian<note n="*" place="bottom">See above, p. xxxvii.</note>. This
may be a warning to Engliſh and Iriſh gentlemen to be leſs
fond of foreign ſervants. Mr. Berkeley, wanting a ſervant
at a time when few were in London; a perſon who owed
Mr. Berkeley much gratitude earneſtly recommended this
villain. Mr. Berkeley objected, wiſhing either an Engliſh
or Scotchman; always thinking it wrong to employ fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
to the detriment of our own countrymen, he how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
yielded. Dr. Berkeley, at his return from viſiting
his ſon in town, ſaid to Mrs. Berkeley, <q rend="inline">"I think your ſon
<pb n="lxxxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:90"/>
ſeems to have got a Devil in the form of a fine tall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low."</q>
                  <q rend="inline">"What does he do?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Nothing, I believe.
But ſuch a pair of diabolical eyes I never ſaw before in
my life."</q> Mrs. Berkeley, ever anxious for her idol, wrote
to her ſon, who, with his uſual benignity, replied, <q rend="inline">"The
poor fellow, to be ſure, is not handſome; nor has he a
very benign countenance; which made my Father think
him diabolical: but he does every thing that I want,
although he is not like Ritchie, or M'Nicol."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When Mr. Berkeley was once ordered to the ſea, a day
or or two before he ſet out, accompanied by his excellent
unwearied friend H. Grimſton, Eſquire, he told this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
that, <q rend="inline">"as he wiſhed to lounge and change his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
frequently, and as he could not accommodate
three in the chaiſe, it being ſummer time, he ſhould
go down on the top of the coach."</q> This <hi>Signor</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
as <hi>ſuch</hi> an indignity, that, on his arrival, he
utterly refuſed to act at all; ſo that, but for Mr. Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton's
ſervant, Mr. Berkeley muſt have been exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
diſtreſſed. His ill humour increaſing daily, Mr.
Berkeley at length diſcharged him without the leaſt anger
or reproach. The ſweetneſs of his nature never ſuffered
his anger to riſe againſt an inferior. My ſuperiors, he uſed
ever to ſay, ſhall <hi>feel</hi> it if <hi>they</hi> treat me improperly. This
wretch, inſtead of returning to London the next morning,
ſtayed the whole of the next day, and when he did ſet off,
ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He had waited all that day to murder his maſter,
<pb n="lxxxiii" facs="tcp:0761700600:91"/>
but he found it was in vain, for that he kept cloſe."</q> It
providentially happened, that Mr. Berkeley's horſe had
picked up a nail, and he could not ride into the country,
as was his conſtant cuſtom, to drink milk from the cow,
morning and evening; neither did he go to the library or
rooms that day; which Mr. Berkeley, when mentioning it,
looked upon as the mercy of an all-gracious, over-ruling,
particular Providence, in which he ever believed, ever
truſted, and was never diſappointed. Mr. Berkeley, not
having any Italian blood in his veins, could form no idea
of this villain's ſpirit of revenge. He was immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
by a very worthy honeſt Engliſhman, Mr. William
Morfey, for whoſe attentive, inceſſant care Mr. Berkeley
felt himſelf ſo much indebted, that ſome little time before
his lamented death, he requeſted of his Father and Mother,
<q rend="inline">"that he might remain in their family as long as ſervice
ſhould be agreeable to him,"</q> although he had a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
without it.</p>
               <p>It is almoſt impoſſible to avoid relating here a little
circumſtance, that will ſhew the contraſt between the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman
and the Italian. For ſome time before Mr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's
diſſolution, finding himſelf unable to fit up through
the day, he roſe not until after the family had dined, that
he might enjoy the ſociety of his friends in the afternoon.
He conſtantly diſmiſſed his ſervant to eat his dinner in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
ordering him not to hurry himſelf, and not to return
until he rang his bell. One day his bell rang, and Mr.
<pb n="lxxxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:92"/>
Berkeley's Mother, conceiving that the ſervant had not
dined, went to the top of the kitchen ſtairs, and told the
ſervant, ſhe would go up and ſee what his Maſter wanted,
and if ſhe could not get it, ring for him. He replied,
<q rend="inline">"No, Madam, I muſt go myſelf."</q> The houſekeeper and
the other ſervants urged him to ſtay, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"You have
but <hi>one ſingle</hi> mouthful to finiſh; do pray eat it; Mr.
Berkeley is never impatient, he will wait."</q> He replied,
<q rend="inline">"<hi>No; I will not ſtay to eat it.</hi>"</q> His Mother once recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
to his care a moſt affectionate, tender-hearted
ſervant, her old houſekeeper, who came into the family
when Mr. Berkeley was a lad, to keep in his family, if it
pleaſed God to ſpare him to ſettle; he lifted up his fine
eyes, and replied, in the tendereſt tone of voice, <q rend="inline">"My
deareſt Mother, there is no occaſion for <hi>you</hi> to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
Mrs. Marſh to <hi>me.</hi>"</q> When Mr. Berkeley's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely
fine picture, preſented to his Mother by his
beloved friend Mr. Peters, arrived at Dr. Berkeley's, this
amiable-hearted woman haſtened to aſſiſt at the unpacking
it, and, on ſeeing it, ſunk motionleſs upon it. Heartfelt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
forces the Writer of this Preface to celebrate the inceſſant
unwearied attention of the two above named ſervants, as
alſo of the very worthy Mrs. Jane Godwin, who has for
many years been the happy domeſtic of Mr. Berkeley's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
kind, generous, excellent Aunt, Mrs. Frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham,
for the delightful alacrity, and unwearied aſſiduity,
with which they endeavoured inceſſantly to alleviate Mr.
Berkeley's intolerable, <hi>all but inſupportable,</hi> bodily ſufferings,
<pb n="lxxxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:93"/>
as indeed did every other ſervant in the family: for all
which ſufferings Mr. Berkeley repeatedly returned hearty
thanks to God, frequently ſaying to his Mother, <q rend="inline">"I would
not have been without them for all this world has to
give, as, I am perſuaded, nothing ſhort of what I have
ſuffered could have brought <hi>me,</hi> as I <hi>ought,</hi> to come to
Chriſt"</q> Such univerſal benevolence may tempt the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor
to feel leſs need of the atonement.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to omit here my moſt grateful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements
to many amiable-hearted perſons in the inferior
ſtations in life, to whom Mr. Berkeley was only known by
his almoſt divine philanthropy, and by his ſevere ſufferings—at
Haſtings, at Dover, and at Cheltenham—who ſeemed to
vie with each other, who ſhould be moſt active in <hi>endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to lighten the diſtreſs of a poor miſerable ſtomach, that
for many months regurgitated every delicacy of every kind<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Berkeley frequently, for days together, did not retain any thing taken into his ſtomach for one minute; which occaſioned one of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Phyſicians to pronounce poſitively, that the paſſage into the ſtomach was ſtopped, and muſt be opened by a method known to medical gentlemen. This was not the caſe; as ſometimes, for two or three days ſucceſſively, plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. Mr. Berkeley was one of the moſt temperate of men, never, from the age of fifteen, taſting a morſel of any food between his meals; no ſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich; no ſoup; nor any thing elſe, even if he did not dine until ſix o'clock; and very rarely ate any ſupper when he dined at the old-faſhioned hour of three at his Father's houſe.</note>.
Perſons are often puniſhed in kind.—<q rend="inline">"By what things a
man ſinneth, by the ſame alſo ſhall he be tormented,"</q>
ſpeaks the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="lxxxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:94"/>
Mr. Berkeley never was an epicure a moment of his life;
frequently, when the family dined out, and he did not
chooſe to accompany them, Mrs. Berkeley would aſk him,
<q rend="inline">"What ſhe ſhould order for his dinner?"</q> His conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
was, <q rend="inline">"Oh! my dear Madam, whatever they have in
the ſervants' hall will do for me."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"But, my dear, they
have not any thing yet ordered."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Well, then, if it is
quite convenient, a neck of mutton and broth, and ſuet
dumplings, and turnips;"</q> of which he conſtantly ate the
abſolute ſcrag; which often occaſioned his mother's telling
him, <q rend="inline">"However you may torment your wife, if ever you
marry, it will not be as an epicure."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley wiſhed exceedingly to have gone to Dover
immediately, on his being ordered the third time to the
ſea, that, together with ſea bathing, he might have enjoyed
the delightful ſociety of his old, his beloved, his ſincerely
reſpected friends, the excellent Sir Robert and Lady Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and their throughly amiable ſon and daughter; but
his father wiſhed him to make choice of Haſtings; and Mr.
Berkeley was the <hi>moſt</hi> obedient of ſons. As the autumn
advanced, the want of a warm ſea-bath obliged him to quit
Haſtings, and he repaired to Dover, accompanied by his
excellent relation above named, Mrs. Frinſham; where he
received ſuch amiable, ſuch inceſſant attentions, from the
lovely family of Laurie, the angelic Mrs. Firebrace, and
the very worthy Mrs. and Miſs Payne—although it were
<pb n="lxxxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:95"/>
impoſſible, even if poſſeſſed of the mines of Peru and
Mexico, to repay their kindneſs, yet muſt it ever be, whilſt
poſſeſſed of life, regiſtered in the retentive grateful memory
of the Editor; and may HE who rewardeth <hi>every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to, although not for,</hi> their good works, reward theſe
amiable friends an hundred, a thouſand fold, in TIME, and
through the countleſs ages of ETERNITY, is a prayer offered
<hi>daily</hi> at the throne of that God who <hi>hears</hi> and <hi>anſwers</hi> prayer,
as is often happily experienced by thoſe who <hi>believe</hi> and
<hi>truſt</hi> HIS gracious promiſes, revealed in the Holy Scriptures.
The mention of theſe particular kind, old, intimate friends
of Mr. Berkeley and his family, does not prevent the
Writer from feeling the ſincereſt gratitude to numberleſs
other of the wonderfully amiable inhabitants of Dover,
who, high and low, ſeemed to ſtudy who ſhould be moſt
forward in ſhewing every <hi>poſſible</hi> attention to Mr. Berkeley,
ſo much as frequently at this time to occaſion the above
named worthy domeſtics to ſay, <q rend="inline">"they never ſaw ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
people as the inhabitants of Dover."</q> It has been
repeatedly aſſerted many years ago by the Writer, who
has often bathed in the ſea at Dover, that the inhabitants,
even the very loweſt ranks, were certainly the moſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
people in Europe, and attributed it to their vicinity
to their once amiable, delightfully courteous neighbours
on the other ſide of the water. The ſtreets of Dover are
narrow, of courſe the pavement cannot be wide; and ſo
<hi>very</hi> attentive are they, that you never ſee an inferior
<pb n="lxxxviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:96"/>
take the wall of a ſuperior, or a charity-ſchool child of an
elder perſon. If, looking on the other ſide, a bricklayer's
labourer in a leathern apron ſtumble on any lady or gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
he inſtantly ſteps off the narrow pavement with, <q rend="inline">"I
aſk your pardon, Sir, or Madam, for not ſeeing you
were coming."</q> Mr. Berkeley's father uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"They
remind me of the days of my youth, ſpent in Ireland,
where the inferior people are moſt remarkably reſpectful
to their ſuperiors."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It would be a vain effort to attempt doing juſtice to Mr.
Berkeley's gratitude to the excellent Mr. Brydges, of
Wootton Court, and his accompliſhed lady; at Dover, at
the time Mr. Berkeley was there. He uſed to exclaim,
<q rend="inline">"How often have they driven over to Wootton Court, to
fetch me ſome fine fruit, as if I had been only brother
to both."</q> Fruit fit to eat, indeed any fruit, cannot be
procured for any ſum at Dover: and on fruit, ſweetmeats,
and old hock, did Mr. Berkeley long ſubſiſt. After his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
at Cheltenham, how many fervent prayers did he pour
forth to the Almighty, to reward the throughly amiable
relations of his Mother, Sir John and Lady Guiſe; when a
ſervant arrived loaded with the fine fruits of Highnam Court,
as alſo the amiable highly reſpected old friend of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Mr. De la Bere, of Cheltenham, in whoſe pleaſing
converſation Mr. Berkeley much delighted, during the few
weeks of his life after his arrival at Cheltenham; whither
<pb n="lxxxix" facs="tcp:0761700600:97"/>
he went, in compliance with the wiſhes of his Mother, to
enjoy the advice of the celebrated Dr. Cheſtern, of Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter.
But, alas! Mr. Berkeley fell a victim to duty! He
had for near two years before been under the hands of an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical
IGNORAMUS<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The Editor wiſhes for the pen of a Johnſon, or a Burke, to endeavour to do juſtice to her gratitude to that moſt amiable of men, her reſpected friend, William Sharp, Eſquire, of Fulham, who having, as it appeared, <hi>wrenched</hi> himſelf from his patients, from his extenſive practice, has the goodneſs to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the maladies of his friends. Dr. Berkeley being from home for a few nights, Mrs. Berkeley inſtantly diſpatched a letter to Mr. Sharp, conjuring him to permit her Son to wait on him, ſhe being convinced that he was in a very dangerous ſituation. The permiſſion was, in the politeſt manner, more than granted. Mr. Sharp, moſt amiably writing to Mrs. Berkeley, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I will not give Mr. Berkeley the trouble of coming to Fulham; but, if he will be pleaſed to appoint any place, day, and hour, in town, I will punctually attend."</q> Mr. Berkeley was too well bred, and felt this amiable goodneſs too ſtrongly, to accept it: he ſet out for Fulham; and, on his arrival there, ſent his ſervant to beg to know at what hour it would be agreeable to Mr. Sharp to admit him. On preſenting to Mr. Sharp a ſhort letter of introduction from his Mother (Mr. Berkeley having never before ſeen him) good Mr. Sharp politely exclaimed, from Mrs. Berkeley's letter, <q rend="inline">"Do all I can to reſcue you from the grave, Sir! If I had <hi>no</hi> friendſhip for Mrs. Berkeley, I would certainly exert all the ſkill I am maſter of to reſcue from death the fineſt young gentleman I ever ſaw."</q> Alas, it was too late! That healing art, as divine Hervey ſays of Dr. Ston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, to which myſelf and ſo many others have been indebted, failed <hi>here.</hi> See Meditations among the Tombs.</p>
                     <p>On examining Mr. Berkeley, Mr. Sharp exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Into the hands of what ignorant Brute can you have fallen, Sir? Dr. Berkeley reſides within thirty miles of town. I did not conceive that, in theſe days, in the remoteſt village in England there they had not better medical aid. One fortnight more, and all the men in the world could not have reſcued you, and a moſt direful cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity muſt have inevitably come upon you."</q> For ever bleſſed be the mercy of God on the great ſkill of good Mr. Sharp, and the eminent Surgeon, an <hi>elève</hi> of his own for fourteen years, under whoſe care he adviſed Mr. Berkeley to put himſelf; that tragical <hi>maiming</hi> of his fine perſon was averted, although his dear life could only be lengthened, not preſerved.</p>
                     <p>Some years ago, the late amiable, pious Mrs. Wadham Knatchbull, having a diſorder that baffled the ſkill of ſeveral very good Canterbury ſurgeons, her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſon, Wyndham Knatchbull, Eſquire, prevailed on Mr. Sharp to viſit her, after he had retired from practice. During his ſtay at the houſe of his excellent rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Dr. Dering, Prebendary of Canterbury, he very obligingly wrote a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription for a ſnuff for Mrs. George Berkeley's eyes. To that gentleman's great ſkill, when in practice fifteen years before, ſhe, under God, owes it, that, after having nurſed a child too long, ſhe has ſtill, through mercy, one eye left, to ſcribble her grateful acknowledgement to her kind benefactors, her ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing friends. Mrs. Berkeley, one morning, carried the preſcription herſelf to Dr. Berkeley's reſpected ſurgeon, Mr. Loftie, deſiring him to make it up himſelf, mentioning from whom ſhe had it, acknowledging, as above, that ſhe owed to that gentleman's ſkill that ſhe had ſtill <hi>one</hi> eye. Mr. Loftie exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Then, Madam, <hi>you</hi> know Mr. Sharp."</q> I never in my life beheld ſuch another man. Good God! with what tenderneſs, eaſe, and ſkill, did he did perform the operation on Mrs. Knatchbull! I never, never ſaw his equal. <q rend="inline">"Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Madam, he is as well-bred a gentleman, as he is an excellent ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon."</q>
                     </p>
                  </note>, in whom his Father placed great <pb n="xc" facs="tcp:0761700600:98"/> confidence.
His Mother ſaw through the wretch; and what added to her anguiſh was, that
two, perhaps, as ſkilful me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical men as any in England reſided at the
ſame town; one of whom always attended Mr. Berkeley's Mother when ill, as
ſhe frequently declared to Dr. Berkeley that to <hi>the third</hi> ſhe
would not truſt the life of her Angola cat.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xci" facs="tcp:0761700600:99"/>
God's ways are unſearchable; but they are all well or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dered

                  <q rend="inline">"All thy ways are Mercy and Truth,"</q> &amp;c. Perhaps
few ſituations have been more diſtreſſing than that of Mr.
Berkeley's Mother for many weeks. Juſt at the time when
ſhe ſhould have ſet out to attend her Son at Dover,
her tenderly beloved Partner was ſeized at Cheltenham
with a moſt tremendous diſorder, that threatened almoſt
immediate diſſolution. Every poſt brought more alarming
accounts from Dover—<q>
                     <l>—"Dreadful poſt of obſervation,</l>
                     <l>"Darker every hour,"</l>
                  </q>
ſays Dr. Young, when relating his own ſufferings during
Lady Betty's laſt illneſs. Her agonies every time the poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy's
horn notified his arrival may, by thoſe who have
feeling hearts, be more eaſily imagined than deſcribed,
and eſpecially as they were obliged to be ſuppreſſed. It,
however, pleaſed the mercy of God to grant a reprieve—a ſhort one, alas! to theſe two, <hi>too</hi> dear objects. Mr.
Berkeley languiſhed to ſee once more his Mother; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
no Mother ever did love a Son quite ſo ſincerely; and
it was ſuppoſed by thoſe who knew him well, that no man
ever did love even a Mother ſo exceedingly as Mr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley<note n="*" place="bottom">The Holy Spirit certainly holds out the love between Mother and Son as the higheſt love without paſſion. Solomon, ſpeaking of Wiſdom, ſaith, <q rend="inline">"She ſhall love thee more than thy Mother doth;"</q> and David ſays, <q rend="inline">"I went hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily, as one that mourneth for his Mother."</q> And again, the Holy Spirit, deſcribing the <hi>bittereſt</hi> mournings, ſays, <q rend="inline">"It ſhall be as the mourning for an only Son."</q>
                  </note>. That love commenced, as Mrs. Berkeley uſed to tell
<pb n="xcii" facs="tcp:0761700600:100"/>
her Son, <q rend="inline">"the inſtant ſhe ſaw his dear <hi>homely face;</hi>"</q> and
continued unabated—alas! daily increaſed—until his fine
face was for ever hid from her bodily eyes by the arrival

               <p>Mr. Berkeley's Mother always flattered herſelf with the
hope, that as ſhe never ſpoiled, or improperly gratified her
children, and conſtantly corrected them, according to the
advice of the Wiſe King, the Book of Proverbs being her
conſtant directory, that ſhe did not idolize them: but,
alas! the wiſeſt are too apt to deceive themſelves—how
much more then a poor weak Female!</p>
               <p>Mrs. Berkeley's firſt care for her children was the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley was early a great ſceptic, which alarmed
his Mother the leſs, as ſhe felt it was hereditary; and ſhe
purſued the ſame plan which her eminently pious and wiſe
Mother had ſo happily uſed towards herſelf; and her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to direct and ſettle that dangerous tendency of
mind were ſo happily bleſſed, that, from the early age of
fifteen, Mr. Berkeley was a moſt zealous, ardent ſtickler
for the co-equal co-eternal Godhead of his adored Redeemer,
and of the Holy Spirit, with the Father. A moſt reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and worthy friend of his early youth, in a letter to

<pb n="xcvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:104"/>
laugh or ſcoff at this, although they know it to be true,
and that Mr. Berkeley did not wait to believe in the Saviour

               <p>Mrs. Berkeley, when her children were young, and
during their being under their Father's roof, whilſt at the
King's School at Canterbury, devoted her mornings prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to them, never admitting any morning viſitor; which
occaſioned the ſenſible, the witty Lady <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

thoſe two naſty little brats were dead out of the way;
then your friends might enjoy a little of your company."</q>
The jocular wiſh, alas, is realized. That amiable friend
was very partial to them, perpetually fetching them to
children's card-parties at her hoſpitable manſion. Mr.
Berkeley, when a man, uſed frequently to ſay, <q rend="inline">"I love

did not wiſh to drown puppies and kittens<note n="*" place="bottom">As dogs and cats produce their young ſo frequently and ſo plentifully, is it not reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the bounteous Giver of every good gift, meant theſe cheaply fed, domeſtic animals, for food for man, and not to be ſouſed at nine days old into a horſe-pond, to corrupt the water for the poor horſes and cows? We learn, from high authority, <q rend="inline">"<hi>That God made nothing in vain.</hi>"</q> Theſe poor animals, as we treat them, ſeem made <hi>worſe</hi> than in vain. We read in Mr. Forſter's account of Captain Cook's firſt voyage, that the life of that very worthy amiable man was ſuppoſed to be ſaved by Mr. Forſter's ſacrificing his favourite dog, for his food, when very ill; and it is well known that half London, who chooſe to eat <hi>tame</hi> rabbits, certainly eat cats. It is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice which, perhaps, like <hi>moſt</hi> other prejudices, it would be wiſdom to give up. The county of Fife, in ſome parts, abounds with the fineſt rabbits, yet the pooreſt labourer will not eat one, although ſtarving; calling them <hi>carrion:</hi> they kill them, ſell their ſkins, and throw the body to the <hi>ſmiddie,</hi> (their elegant word for our groſs one of <hi>dunghill;</hi>) <hi>we</hi> are rather a coarſe people; the French call that neceſſary heap <hi>un fumée.</hi> Many of the lower people of Scotland will not touch a ſilver eel, terming water-ſnakes. When the late Biſhop Berkeley went, in the year 1735, to reſide in the palace at Cloyne, none of the poor Iriſh would eat of ſome very fine fiſh, in great plenty there, I think, the Jean d'orée; but, after ſome time, they ſaid, <q rend="inline">"that if my Lord ate it, it could not <hi>harm</hi> them."</q>

               <p>Mr. Berkeley, determined to attempt complying with the
earneſt requeſt of his Mother, took an affectionate, a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<hi>laſt</hi> farewell of all his amiable friends and obliging
neighbours at Dover, including the throughly reſpectable

and pious Rev. Mr. Lyon, and his tender-hearted amiable
apothecary, Mr. Hanham, who did not conceive that Mr.
Berkeley had ſufficient ſtrength remaining to reach Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
alive; but the divine tenderneſs of nature, which
ſhewed itſelf at the age of three years<note n="*" place="bottom">When about that age, one Wedneſday, the family all coming out of church, a beggar applied to her Father for relief, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"that a ſcaffold breaking at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Tyrrel's, at Shottover Houſe, two men had been killed,—his arm was ſo ſhattered that it had been cut off juſt at the elbow,—that it was then morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and he was going to the hoſpital to have it taken off above the elbow."</q> Mr. Frinſham, an excellent ſurgeon to his poor neighbours, inſiſted on looking at it; and, turning to his footman, bid him aſſiſt the man to take off his coat. After much apparatus removed, there appeared a lily white hand. Hereupon Mr. Frinſham exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Thou villain! I will commit you to Bridewell di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly. William, (to his ſervant,) go, call the conſtable;"</q> who lived at the parſonage cloſe by;—out came the conſtable;—down fell the <hi>reſtored</hi> cripple on his knees on the pitched walk.

ſeventeen, to ſay, <q rend="inline">"Well, if you will not attend to me,
I will ſpeak to Mr. John, and he will make you do it
immediately."</q> Mr. Berkeley uſed to redden, and ſay,

                  <q rend="inline">"Why, my dear Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,

                  <q rend="inline">"Why, when Dr. or Mrs.
Berkeley ſay, 'Berkeley, I would adviſe you to do ſo or
ſo,' you inſtantly reply, 'Yes, Sir, or Madam; but I

ſubject Dr. Berkeley turns to Mrs. Berkeley, and ſays,
'My dear, you will ſpeak to John<note n="*" place="bottom">Highly as Mr. Berkeley thought of John, he is one inſtance thought more highly of his own eloquence. Sometimes Mr. Berkeley's fine hunter was not thought ſufficiently recovered from the fatigues of the preceding hunt; and only one horſe in the place was capable of flying over hedge and ditch, <q rend="inline">"<hi>burn and brake,</hi>"</q> the property of a moſt worthy old blackſmith, of the name of Peirce.

                        <hi>i.e.</hi> earning—always a moſt reſpectful domeſtic.

Off ſets Mr. Berkeley, and ſoon returns in triumph, with, <q rend="inline">"Aye, there is nothing like doing one's own buſineſs. Here have I ſent Robert, Gardener, John; all in vain; and I prevailed upon the old man in two minutes. He ſaid, 'Lord bleſs you, Sir, why you <hi>muſt</hi> have him I think, and I muſt go to Reading on Thurſday."</q> The fact was, Mr. Berkeley's manners were ſo uncommonly ſweet and winning, particularly to his inferiors, where, as his mother uſed to tell him, the <q rend="inline">"noble blood of the Berkeleys"</q> could not be put in motion, that he could, like his Grandfather, the Biſhop (as Mr. Dalton uſed always to ſay) of his beloved reſpected friend he could perſuade every body to any thing that he pleaſed. Some time after, this honeſt man opened a grocer's ſhop; Mr. Berkeley conjured his Mother to lay out ſome money with him, adding, <q rend="inline">"I really feel myſelf under great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to the honeſt old man."</q> On Mr. Berkeley's return to Cookham ſeveral years after, finding his old friend Peirce dead, he put his little orphan boy to ſchool.</note>, and hear what he
<pb n="c" facs="tcp:0761700600:108"/>
ſays;' when Mrs. Berkeley replies, 'Yes, I have talked
to him already about it.' Now is it not evident that
what I ſay is fact?"</q> This gentleman did not mean that
Dr. Berkeley conſulted his excellent old ſervant on his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
or Mrs. Berkeley on her Letters, although ſhe had
<pb n="ci" facs="tcp:0761700600:109"/>
taught him the alphabet; he coming very early into Dr.
Berkeley's family, and living in it very near thirty years,
during which long period he never returned a ſaucy anſwer,
nor uttered a pert ſentence, or grumble, when ſhutting the
door. Notwithſtanding he was, when Mrs. Berkeley was not
preſent, the <hi>only</hi> governor of Mr. Monck Berkeley, yet he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
forgot that he was the ſon of his Maſter; but always treated
him with the reſpect due from one in an humbler ſtation.
<q rend="inline">"Sir, you <hi>muſt not,</hi> you <hi>ſhall not</hi> do that. What would
my Miſtreſs ſay, if ſhe ſhould come into the ſtable-yard
now?"</q> Mr. Wrightſon was many years coachman to
Dr. Berkeley before he became his butler. A ſtronger proof
that perſons is an humble ſtation may be thoroughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable
and reſpected cannot be adduced than in Mr.
Berkeley's little brother, when about ſeven years old, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
very diſconſolately: the cauſe being enquired, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<q rend="inline">"Why, I have been naughty, and John will not
be friends with me."</q> Mrs. Berkeley, his grandmother,
being in the room, replied, <q rend="inline">"Oh! never mind that, if he
won't; but go away to play."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Never mind it, indeed
Why, if <hi>all</hi> the world were friends with, and <hi>John was
not,</hi> I could never be happy."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Wrightſon's powers for governing well, it may be
preſumed, are not impaired; as the little <hi>boys</hi> in Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
workhouſe, of which he is now maſter, are made ſo
induſtrious, at <hi>eight</hi> years old, as to earn money ſufficient to
<pb n="cii" facs="tcp:0761700600:110"/>
receive a poundage of threepence every week for themſelves,
to ſpend as they pleaſe, in little innocent trifles. A wiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
this; and it muſt be wiſhed by every humane
perſon, that it was practiſed in <hi>every</hi> workhouſe and poor-houſe
throughout the three kingdoms. At Cookham in Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
where they are remarkably kind to the poor in the
workhouſe, and moſt ſhamefully hard and cruel to thoſe
who <hi>ſtrive</hi> to keep themſelves out of it, the lace-making
women and girls, and others, have two pence out of every
ſhilling they earn, and permiſſion to work for their own
profit after a certain hour in the evening. This is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
the hearts of the poor, enabling them to procure a
little tea, tobacco, and ſnuff, which cannot be provided
otherwiſe. Dr. Berkeley has often had his wonderfully
fine, tender, feelings ſoothed, when viſiting ſick perſons in
the workhouſe, ſaying, on his return home, <q rend="inline">"Well, it is
a delight to one's ſpirit to ſee thoſe poor people in ſheets
as white, though not as fine, as one's own, and every
comfort that human aid can render."</q> Tea, wine, &amp;c.
were always allowed to the ſick, if the apothecary ſaid it
was neceſſary. The very worthy Mrs. Lane was then
miſtreſs, with a handſome ſalary. She lived many years
in the family of the late Lord Aylesford. Servants, who
have lived in genteel families, are the <hi>only proper</hi> conductors
of workhouſes. A butler of the late worthy General Onſlow
of Cookham was her predeceſſor. A <hi>broken</hi> tradeſman,
<pb n="ciii" facs="tcp:0761700600:111"/>
who perhaps knows little, but how to give <hi>ſhort meaſure,</hi>
and light weight, and eat the beſt of every thing, till he
breaks, is tyrannical and cruel, <q rend="inline">"<hi>laying his weight heavily
on the aged; and not pitying children;</hi>"</q> as ſpeaks the Holy
Scripture.</p>
               <p>The aid of the very learned, very ſkilful Dr. Packe had
been procured by Mrs. Berkeley, who, in a letter ſent to
him by her, had deſired him to viſit Mr. Berkeley at Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which he did, and ſaw him again at Canterbury on
his journey. It was ſuppoſed by all who did ſee him, that
Mr. Berkeley would hardly reach Sittingbourn alive; and
he was ſuppoſed once to be dead; yet it pleaſed that all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious
God, whoſe mercies are no fewer than infinite, to
his faithful, however unworthy, ſervants, to conduct Mr.
Berkeley to Cheltenham, where his family had been for
ſome months, unable to get to him, on account of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
lamentable ſtate of health, as above mentioned. Mr.
Berkeley, after repoſing part of a day and a night at the
palace of thoſe prodigies of KENTISH innkeepers, Mr. and
Mrs. Simpſon, at the Roſe at Sittingbourn—indeed they
might, with truth, be compared with the Marches at Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denhead

Mr. Berkeley, by ſlow journeys, reached the metropolis,

It is impoſſible to omit relating here a moſt pleaſing

Horton, near Windſor. That pariſh was once ſo happy as
to have the excellent Mr. Romaine for curate. This
amiable-hearted young gentleman<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Browne was one of ſeveral gentlemen who, although in diſtant parts of the kingdom, as if by conſent, put themſelves into brother's mourning for their beloved lamented friend.</note>, hearing from his bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,

Oxford, bid her take no thought about a lodging; for

more agreeable to him to be in his own old rooms, which
Mr. Browne had deſired the Principal to let him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change

Mrs. Leyceſter and the worthy Mr. William Wells<note n="†" place="bottom">This young man was an orphan, and attended the hall with fruit, &amp;c.

               <p>After paſſing a couple of days at Oxford, to reſt, and
bid a <hi>laſt</hi> adieu to his friends in that beloved place, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
by eaſy journeys, toward Cheltenham. He was met
on the road by his Father, Mother, and his Father's cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin-german,
the generous, amiable, and compaſſionate Mrs.
D. Monck, too well known in the polite circles of
London and Bath, for her polite attentions, elegant hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
and unbounded generoſity to her relations, her
friends, and the poor, to need an enumeration here. To
attempt to do juſtice to her exquiſitely kind, amiable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
attentions to Mr. Berkeley during the laſt ſix

executed perhaps by <hi>any</hi> pen, much leſs by one ſo very
imbecile. Suffice it therefore to ſay, May God reward in
<pb n="cx" facs="tcp:0761700600:118"/>
TIME and through ETERNITY; what Mr. Berkeley termed
Mrs. Monck's <q rend="inline">"divine attentions"</q> to him. Amen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley's ſtrength daily decreaſing, as it had done
for many months, he never walked out but twice at Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham,
once to look at the beautiful church<note n="*" place="bottom">With a handſome painting of <hi>that</hi> church the eyes of the Editor are daily delighted; for which ſhe is indebted to the elegant pencil of her very highly accompliſhed, ſenſible, amiable, young friend, Miſs Hamilton, one of the daughters of Lord Archibald Hamilton, who, although ſo very diſtant in point of years, honoured the Editor by ſeeking her acquaintance—an <hi>honour</hi> but very rarely <hi>granted</hi> by the Editor to <hi>young</hi> ladies of any rank.

Mr. Monck Berkeley uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"it was <hi>a mercy</hi> that God did not ſpare the life of his little ſiſter; that, if he had, both his Mother and ſelf ſhould certainly have <hi>ended their days</hi> at <hi>Tyburn;</hi> for, had ſhe as many lives as a cat is ſaid to have, we ſhould both have killed her <hi>nine</hi> times, if ſhe had behaved as the generality of girls of faſhion do now."</q> He always named <hi>ſome</hi> as exceptions.

felt his mortal remains would ſoon be depoſited, in hope
of a joyful reſurrection to immortal life, which he humbly
hoped through CHRIST JESUS HIS SAVIOUR.</p>
               <p>Curioſity perhaps may have led many to run their eye,
for want of ſomething elſe to do, over this ſhort indigeſted
ſketch of the ſhort life of a young Man, of whom it cannot

be ſaid, there is nothing remarkable in it; for, were the
account of Mr. Berkeley's life methodically written by a
learned, accurate pen, perhaps few lives of double the
length of his could furniſh more curious matter. The
number of aſtoniſhing hair-breadth eſcapes of life, in his very
early childhood, uſed to occaſion his Mother to expreſs her
fears, that he would reſemble Pope Sixtus Quintus, or the
celebrated unfortunate Wortley Montague, Eſquire; both
of whom, it is well known, were inceſſantly in perils, and
eſcaped moſt wonderfully. A very worthy woman, that
waited on Lady Mary Wortley Montague when he was born,
and many years afterwards, in her advanced age lived with
an intimate friend of Mrs. Berkeley's Mother, when Mrs.
Berkeley was a girl, and was by her frequently enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with the wonderful exploits of <hi>Maſter</hi> Montague;
and thoſe of <hi>Maſter</hi> Berkeley were in many inſtances ſo ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
as to cauſe the ſupremeſt vigilance in Mrs. Berkeley.
Her younger ſon, although a wonderfully lively alert child,
never had any danger to encounter, never had any <hi>known</hi>
eſcape from danger, which occaſioned Mr. Berkeley's fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
dangers and eſcapes to be the more noticed by the
whole family. The ſpirit of one <q rend="inline">"<hi>returned early to God who

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Pray, my dear Madam, whoſe book is that?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. B.—<q rend="inline">"It is mine, my dear.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"Yes, yes, I know that: <hi>you know</hi> what I
mean; who is the writer?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. B.—<q rend="inline">"Why do you aſk, my dear? Do you like it?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"Yes, moſt exceedingly! Pray tell me <hi>who</hi> is
the author?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. B.—<q rend="inline">"Why, my dear, it is written by my excellent
old friend, Sir Richard Hill."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He then exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Oh! beſt of Mothers, do not
make an Antinomian of your <hi>poor</hi> Son; <hi>for, if you do, he
is loſt for ever.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. B.—<q rend="inline">"My dear child, Sir Richard Hill is no more
an Antinomian than <hi>your</hi> Mother; and <hi>you</hi> have long
<pb n="cxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:124"/>
known <hi>her</hi> horror of that dreadful doctrine of DEVILS. As
I have always told you, till a certain text can be expunged
from Scripture, no <hi>real</hi> Chriſtian can become an Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian: 'Without HOLINESS no man ſhall ſee the Lord.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"Pray proceed."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On the Monday he requeſted Mrs. Berkeley to read out
of it again; and one day aſking her to read to him, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<q rend="inline">"My dear, I have juſt laid it out of my pocket,
on the table in my own room."</q> He replied, <q rend="inline">"<hi>But,</hi> beſt
of Mothers, you <hi>can</hi> have the goodneſs to go and fetch
it:"</q> which requeſt was of courſe inſtantly complied with.
He frequently exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"It is a wonderful book,
ſurely."</q> The title—"The Deep Things of GOD, or Milk
and Strong Meat<note n="*" place="bottom">Mrs. Berkeley every day, immediately on quitting her Son's room, wrote under many of the numbers Mr. Berkeley's comments upon them. She has had that incomparable identical book moſt elegantly bound, gilt, &amp;c. and, poor as ſhe is, would not take five hundred pounds for it. If it may be permitted us to compare ſmall things with great, that excellent, kind, unwearied friend, one of the truſtees to Mrs. Berkeley's marriage ſettlement, is now perpetually labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſſiſt his old friend in her worldly concerns, her multiplicity of <hi>ugly</hi> buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, as he was to aſſiſt her angelic ſon with his ſpiritual aid.</note>."</p>
               <p>About ten days before his lamented death, his Mother,
ſitting in her uſual place, cloſe to his pillow, he thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
her: <q rend="inline">"My dear Madam, I have a favour to beg of
you. Pray, promiſe me that you will grant it."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"My
dear child, you <hi>know,</hi> that if it is any thing in <hi>my</hi> power,
<pb n="cxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:125"/>
you may command it."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"It is, that you will promiſe
me faithfully to ſend a copy of this book over to Ireland,
for it is a book of a <hi>very</hi> extraordinary nature <hi>indeed</hi>—the
moſt wonderfull book <hi>ſurely</hi> that ever was written by man,
uninſpired; and God knows, they lamentably want it in
that poor country, as well as in this."</q> Mrs. Berkeley en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to whom he wiſhed her to ſend it. He mentioned
a particular old friend of his Father, for whom Mr. Berkeley
had a very great and unfeigned regard. Mrs. Berkeley pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
him, that, if it pleaſed God to ſpare her life, ſhe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
would ſend it without fail.</p>
               <p>The evening immediately preceding Mr. Berkeley's happy
departure, as Mrs. Berkeley was ſitting by his bed ſide,
he fell into a ſweet ſleep. A ſervant came to announce
to her, that tea was made. She went ſilently out of the
room. In a few minutes he awoke, and enquired of his
ſervant, <q rend="inline">"Where is my Mother?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Juſt gone down to
tea, Sir."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Go down, and give my duty to her, and
ſay, that when ſhe has <hi>quite</hi> done drinking her tea, I beg
to ſpeak with her."</q> Mrs. Berkeley inſtantly obeyed the
ſummons; he kindly reproached her for having come ſo
quickly, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"He feared ſhe had not taken her tea
(which he knew was her favourite refreſhment) in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort."</q>
On being aſſured that ſhe had done, he began,
<q rend="inline">"My deareſt Mother, I beg that you will have the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to promiſe me <hi>ſolemnly,</hi> that you will ſend that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

book over to Ireland."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"My dear, I did promiſe
you, about a fortnight ago, that I would certainly ſend it
if I lived. Did I ever in my life, from your infancy,
break any promiſe, good or bad, that I made to you,
or to your dear brother?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"No, never, I believe, in
your whole life."</q> But I thought, perhaps, that you might
<q rend="inline">"promiſe me, as a dy<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

is ſuppoſed, <q rend="inline">"as a dying man."</q> He ſtopped ſhort, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it would too tenderly affect his almoſt broken-hearted
Mother, and proceeded to ſay, to pacify me, and make me
eaſy, again repeating, <q rend="inline">"It is a moſt <hi>extraordinary</hi> WONDER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FUL
book ſurely."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley might moſt <hi>happily</hi> term it ſuch; for it was
that <hi>alone,</hi> by the mercy of God, that <hi>could,</hi> that <hi>did,</hi> ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him to triumph over the KING of TERRORS.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Frinſham uſed frequently, when viſiting at Dr.
Berkeley's, to ſay to her ſiſter, <q rend="inline">"I am ſurprized your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are ever terrified: you promiſe them a whipping, or
a <hi>ſtarving,</hi> (ſo ſhe termed a dinner of potatoes and water;
for it injures children's ſtomachs to faſt entirely, or go to
bed ſupperleſs;) in ſo very good humoured a voice, that
I wonder they ever believe you."</q> Mrs. Berkeley uſed to
aſſure her, that there was no need of uttering the promiſe
in the tone of a fiſh-woman, as they <hi>well</hi> knew, whatever
the <hi>voice</hi> was, the <hi>threat</hi> would <hi>infallibly</hi> be executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="cxix" facs="tcp:0761700600:127"/>
A curious little anecdote of Mr. Berkeley's early entering
into characters occurred when he was juſt turned ſix years
old. One day Mrs. Frinſham and Dr. Berkeley, going
down the Southcote Walk, he gallopped by them, whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
his horſe (a fine long ſtick), ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Miſs Frinſham,
I am to dine upon bread and water to-day."</q> His two
relatives, both made up of tenderneſs, lamentably exclaimed,
<q rend="inline">"Oh! I hope not: go, and beg pardon."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Oh! that
won't do."</q> To which his Father replied, <q rend="inline">"Oh! my
dear, go, and try to coax your Mamma."</q> With a look
of ineffable ſcorn, he replied, <q rend="inline">"Oh! my dear Sir, <hi>you</hi> don't
know MY Mamma. When <hi>once</hi> ſhe has ſaid (imitating
the exact tone<note n="*" place="bottom">Always as ſlow as a ſentence could be uttered, and with all the ſolemnity of an excellent judge on the bench.</note> in which the threat was denounced)
<hi>Berkeley! you ſhall dine to day upon bread and water,</hi>
if the KING was to come, and go down upon <hi>both</hi> his
knees<note n="†" place="bottom">Doctor and Mrs. Berkeley being very old-faſhioned perſons in ſome things; their children conſtantly aſking their parents bleſſing every morning and night, were never ſuffered to kneel on both knees, Mrs. Berkeley's father never ſuffering her to do it, always ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Never fall on both your knees, but to your Father in Heaven. He is King of kings,—Lord of lords. You cannot humble yourſelves enough to him."</q> Aſking a parent's bleſſing is now quite obſolete. The Editor has very frequently ſeen her old hereditary friend, the agreeable learned Author of "CHRISTIANITY NOT FOUNDED ON ARGUMENT," (alas! for him, poor man!) on his arrival from his own ſeat in Surrey, at his pious mother's houſe in Berks, conſtantly drop on his knee, previouſly to his taking notice of any one, before his mother's chair, (ſhe was lame,) ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Madam, I beg your bleſſing."</q>—This, it muſt be known, was out of reſpect to her,—Mr. Berkeley that he might obtain a Parent's interceſſion with GOD.</note> to her, ſhe would not pardon me. My Mamma is
<pb n="cxx" facs="tcp:0761700600:128"/>
not like you—when I am naughty, take and give me a
good hearty ſhake or two, and ſcold me for a minute or
two, and then forget it directly."</q> The idea of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
interceſſion being vain, was a lucky one; or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
as his Majeſty, in hunting, frequently paſſed through
Dr. Berkeley's grounds, this extraordinary little genius
might have thrown himſelf in his way. He had been told
that nobody muſt ever turn their backs on the King. When
about five years old, walking one evening with his Mother
and Miſs Leigh, a relation of hers, in Kenſington gardens,
he on a ſudden began walking backwards, preſently ſaying,
<q rend="inline">"Dear ladies, why do you not walk backwards?"</q> Some
gentleman paſſed, whom <hi>he</hi> ſuppoſed to be his Majeſty,
whom he had then never ſeen. But to return.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley felt that he had broken God's Law, had fallen
into temptation, and conſidering that he had received a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
pious education, as he uſed to tell his conſoling Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when ſhe repeatedly applied to his broken contrite ſpirit,
that glorious promiſe, <q rend="inline">"Though your <hi>ſins</hi> be as <hi>ſcarlet,</hi>"</q> &amp;c.
and that infinitely gracious one of our eternal co-equal Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
God, <q rend="inline">"Him that cometh unto me I will in <hi>no wiſe</hi> caſt
out.—Come unto me, ALL ye that are weary and heavy
<pb n="cxxi" facs="tcp:0761700600:129"/>
laden, and I will refreſh you."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Alas! my dear Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I have been a more grievous ſinner than others,
becauſe I have had a more pious education than moſt
perſons."</q> But, bleſſed, for ever bleſſed, be the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Love of God the COMFORTER, this bleſſed little book
poured the balm of perfect peace, of joy, into his lovely
wounded ſpirit; and he wiſhed others to be conſoled by it.</p>
               <p>One morning, after all fear of vengeance on account of
the broken Law of God was quite done away, by HIS
mercy, <q rend="inline">"who is MIGHTY to ſave,"</q> and <q rend="inline">"who trod the
wine-preſs ALONE,"</q> Mrs. Berkeley, going into the room,
as was her cuſtom, enquired if he had paſſed a tolerable
night. His reply was, <q rend="inline">"I have had great pain, and have
not cloſed my eyes one minute ſince I ſaw you; but I
have been in heaven, bleſſed be the MERCY of GOD."</q>
A few mornings afterwards the ſame anxious enquiry was
anſwered in the very ſame words, with this addition,
<q rend="inline">"Surely, my deareſt Mother, it is not an illuſion of my
GRAND ENEMY, to lull me into ſecurity."</q> So watchful
was he againſt deceiving himſelf, eſpecially in the concerns
of his ſoul; to which his Mother earneſtly replied, <q rend="inline">"No,
my dear child, NO. That God whom you have laboured
ſo zealouſly, ſo faithfully, to ſerve, although he has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
you to <hi>fall,</hi> to ſhew you your own frailty, yet he will
never ſuffer the Enemy of Souls to delude you. Beſides,
my deareſt creature what <hi>can</hi> the Devil hope to gain by you,
<pb n="cxxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:130"/>
in your preſent helpleſs, languiſhing ſtate, unleſs he could
tempt you to blaſpheme, or deſpair, as you lie ſtretched
on a bed of languiſhing? And, bleſſed be the free grace
of God, he has never yet been able to do either the one
or the other. No, my dear Son, God has vouchſafed,
in infinite mercy, to lift up the light of his reconciled
countenance upon you, to anſwer the conſtant fervent
prayers of your poor unworthy Mother, and your own,
on <hi>this</hi> ſide the grave."</q> At two, three, or four nights
diſtance, Mr. Berkeley had two or three more ſuch bleſſed
nights; for which wonderfully gracious vouchſafement all
glory be to FREE SOVEREIGN GRACE and REDEEMING
LOVE.</p>
               <p>The day before Mr. Berkeley's death, he diſcovered, by
what Dr. Berkeley happened to drop, that Mrs. Berkeley had
ſat up the whole of the preceding night in the next room.
His eyes flaſhed with indignation, and he inſtantly ſpoke to
her concerning it. As Mrs. Berkeley never, in the polite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe
of life, ſuffers herſelf to falſify<note n="*" place="bottom">A lady one day requeſted Mrs. Berkeley to make a very fine <hi>made-up</hi> ſpeech of excuſe for her to ſome other lady; to which Mrs. Berkeley ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Would it not, Madam, be better to tell the truth, and ſay, that really a multiplicity of engagements have rendered it inconvenient for you to go ſo far?"</q> Mr. Monck Berkeley, happening to be preſent, remarked, <q rend="inline">"How little that good lady knows MY Mother! why She will not tell a <hi>civil</hi> lye for my Father, or myſelf. Her idea is, that many <hi>obliging, polite, kind, friendly</hi> things may be ſaid, without ſacrificing TRUTH."</q> The worthy amiable Mrs. Waller, ſiſter of the Archdeacon of Eſſex, the friend of Mrs. Berkeley from eight years old, always ſays, <q rend="inline">"There is a real pleaſure in hearing a polite thing from Mrs Berkeley, "for you may <hi>ſwear</hi> it comes from her heart."</q>
                  </note>, ſhe was obliged at
<pb n="cxxiii" facs="tcp:0761700600:131"/>
laſt to confeſs, that ſhe had repoſed on the ſopha in the
drawing-room. He earneſtly exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Good God! <hi>ſo
my dear Mother is to kill herſelf for me:</hi> that is at laſt
to be the end of <hi>her.</hi>"</q> And, turning to his Father, he
ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Ah! my dear Sir, <hi>why</hi> would you <hi>ſuffer</hi> it?"</q> Dr.
Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"My dear child, your Mother would have
been wretched if I had interpoſed."</q> He then extorted a
ſolemn promiſe from his Mother, that ſhe would go to reſt
that night, amiably adding, <q rend="inline">"and promiſe that you will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
and go into bed, or I will not attempt to cloſe my
eyes all night."</q> Mrs. Berkeley retired, with a ſtrict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
to Dr. Berkeley's and Mr. Berkeley's own ſervant,
both of whom attended him with wonderful aſſiduity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately
lying in a tent-bed in Mr. Berkeley's room, and
ſitting up with him, that ſhe would never forgive them, if
they perceived the leaſt change in Mr. Berkeley, and did
not inſtantly call her up.</p>
               <p>On the morning of January 26, Mr. Berkeley's ſervant
knocked at the chamber-door, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"that he came with
his Maſter's duty, and deſired Dr. Berkeley would go
down, and pray with him."</q> Dr. Berkeley inſtantly aroſe,
and went down. Juſt as Mrs. Berkeley had put on ſome
<pb n="cxxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:132"/>
of her cloaths, Dr. Berkeley, returned, announcing <q rend="inline">"the
heavy tidings,"</q> that they had loſt their <hi>earthly</hi> treaſure.
Mrs. Berkeley, although having ever earneſtly wiſhed and
prayed to witneſs the laſt moments of all thoſe beloved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
ſhe is doomed to ſurvive, ſubmitted, in ſhe humbly
truſts, profound ſilence to the will of the ALL-WISE Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer
of ALL events; acting, as well as daily praying, <q rend="inline">"Thy
will be done <hi>in</hi> me, <hi>on</hi> me, and <hi>by</hi> me."</q> Mr. Berkeley,
in a letter to his Mother, during his illneſs, ſays, <q rend="inline">"I truſt
I have learned my deareſt Mother's prayer, 'Thy will,'
&amp;c.</q> Mrs. Berkeley ſunk again into her bed. Juſt as the
clock ſtruck nine, ſhe exclaimed to Dr. Berkeley, <q rend="inline">"If ever
I heard Berkeley cough in my life, he has coughed this
minute."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Alas! my dear, no: you will never hear
him any more on earth."</q> Mrs. Berkeley's maid entered
at that inſtant, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"that Mr. Berkeley was come to
life again, and wiſhed to ſee Mrs. Berkeley."</q> It may be
eaſily ſuppoſed that ſhe was not long in getting down ſtairs,
where ſhe ſaw her dear Son looking like an angel, his fine
eyes as lively as when in perfect health; and for about a
fortnight before his death, his noſe became ſo exactly like
the beautiful one of his two grandfathers, Biſhop Berkeley
and Mr. Frinſham, both having the ſame fine-ſhaped noſe,
that he looked remarkably beautiful. The ſame change
after death took place, in the ſame feature of Dr. Berkeley's
wonderfully beautiful face. Such changes are ſaid, by
the learned men of the faculty, often to happen a few
<pb n="cxxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:133"/>
hours before the ſeparation of the ſpirit from the earthly
mould.</p>
               <p>Dr. and Mr. Monck Berkeley both wanted what Mrs.
Berkeley always termed the genuine Berkeley noſe, and
which her own father, without being a Berkeley, had. The
preſent Counteſs Dowager of Granard has it. When the
beautiful lady Georgiana Berkeley, ſhe was a fac ſimile of a
wonderfully fine ivory medallion taken of Biſhop Berkeley,
at Rome, when a young man. Dr. Berkeley uſed to ſay,
to Mr. Berkeley, <q rend="inline">"Aye, your noſe is a <hi>judgement</hi> upon your
Mother, for deſpiſing mine, becauſe it is not like my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's."</q>
Mr. Monck Berkeley had, from pictures in Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
Caſtle, and from monuments, drawings of all his noble
anceſtors, and uſed to ſhow his Mother ſome few with a
ſhort noſe; to which ſhe uſed to reply, <q rend="inline">"Aye, ſome ugly
mother has introduced it."</q> When Doctor Berkeley, in
the caſe of the late brave Admiral B<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>, as plain as he
was valiant, his lady one of the moſt beautiful women in
Europe,—the ſons all reſembling the mother, the very clever
worthy daughters the good Admiral:—obſerved, <q rend="inline">"What a
pity it is that thoſe poor girls have all got ſuch an horrid
<hi>daſh</hi> of their father in their faces!"</q> The young ladies are
all well married, and make as excellent wives as their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
mother. The worthy veteran uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"I never
thought my wife handſome, until Dr. Berkeley talked ſo
much of her beauty. <hi>I</hi> know ſhe was a <hi>very</hi> good wife."</q>
               </p>

Mr. Berkeley, who always greatly delighted in the Pſalms,
deſired thoſe of the day, both morning and evening, might
be redde to him; in which he joined. The evening Pſalms
of the 26th day of the month conclude the exixth Pſalm.
Mr. Berkeley felt the whole well ſuited to his ſtate, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
the <hi>laſt</hi> verſe. His Father prayed with him, the
family attending, and pronounced, at the requeſt of his
Mother, that delightful abſolution of the excellent Church
of England, in her office for the Viſitation of the Sick. He
appeared ſo much revived, that his friends all quitted the
room a little before noon, except his Mother, the medical
gentlemen who attended having given it as their opinion
that he would remain until about ten at night. In about
half an hour, his Mother, perceiving that ſpeaking ſeemed
rather painful to him, and that he breathed rather quicker,
ſaid, <q rend="inline">"We will pray:"</q> and, taking out of her pocket
Biſhop Hall's excellent little book of Devotions for <hi>all</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
and <hi>all</hi> relations in life, from which ſhe petitioned
at the Throne of Grace for her Son, as ſoon as his ſoul,

                  </gap>, entered his body; ſhe now, when ſhe
conceived it was returning to God, proſtrated herſelf by the
bed-ſide, and his ſervant at the foot of the bed, when (oh!
the wonderful goodneſs of Chriſt,) ſhe was enabled to offer
that fine prayer for one juſt departing out of this world,
with a diſtinct voice, and without one falling tear, which
ſhe well knew would have thrown her Son into extreme
<pb n="cxxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:135"/>
agony<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Berkeley, from a child of three years old, could never ſupport the ſight of his Mother in tears. Had ſhe choſen to condeſcend to practiſe art, and have wept, ſhe might have managed her Son as ſhe pleaſed, from three to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt thirty years old. After his arrival at Cheltenham, obſerving the tears ſtanding in her eyes, he exclaimed to his Father, <q rend="inline">"Oh! my dear Sir, this is too much for me to ſupport. I have all my life, ſince I knew how to pray, beſought God to inflict any ſuffering upon me, but that of ſeeing my dear Mother in tears."</q> Dr. Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"My dear, can you ſuppoſe that your Mother, much command as ſhe has over herſelf, muſt not ſometimes be overcome?"</q> Mrs. Berkeley wiped her eyes, and chearfully ſaid, <q rend="inline">"My dear, ſhall I get a maſk?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"<hi>Any thing, beſt</hi> of Mothers, to prevent <hi>my</hi> ſeeing your tears. I never could bear it in my health and ſtrength."</q> Mr. Berkeley, when a youth, once ſaid, <q rend="inline">"<hi>My</hi> Mother never laughs."</q>—To which his Father replied, <q rend="inline">"Well if your Mother never laughs herſelf, ſhe makes us laugh very often, and that is more to our purpoſe than if ſhe did. We have this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that ſhe never weeps without REAL cauſe."</q>
                  </note>. Mr. Berkeley joined in that fine prayer, the
Lord's Prayer, and <q rend="inline">"The Lord lift up the light of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
countenance,"</q> &amp;c. Mrs. Berkeley then ſeated her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by her Son's pillow; he fixed his ſtill fine eyes moſt
tenderly upon her for about two minutes, then cloſed them,
ſhe conceiving that he was reſolved his poor unworthy
Mother ſhould be the laſt earthly object they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.
He then, without calling for the aſſiſtance of his
ſervant, turned himſelf quite round to the other ſide of
his bed, laid his arms down by his ſide, and made himſelf
quite ready for his coffin; then uttered three diſtinct aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirations,
as was conceived, to that co-equal Triune God,

               <p>Mr. Berkeley prayed fervently to God for three things;
and He that heareth the prayers of the contrite, heard and
anſwered him:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the agonies of his ſtomach might ceaſe one
week before he quitted this mortal life. <q rend="inline">"Oh! ſpare me
a little, that I may recover my ſtrength before I go hence,

ordered, that they ceaſed juſt ten days before his death;

and, inſtead of that craving for fruits and acids, he rather
wiſhed to avoid taking any thing, not even orange and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

<q rend="inline">"My dear Man, if you do not take a little nouriſhment,
you will be a ſuicide;"</q> to which he haſtily replied, <q rend="inline">"Oh!

jelly from her hand, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I will take any thing you

an Iriſh gentleman of fortune, of Cork, publiſhed a long

               <p>Mr. Berkeley was too well known in the metropoliſes of
theſe three kingdoms to make a particular deſcription of
his perſon neceſſary. Suffice it therefore to ſay, that the
beauty of his face by no means equalled that of his exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely
beautiful Father, and his ſtill handſomer Grandfather,
Biſhop Berkeley. He more reſembled, in face and ſtature,
his Mother's Father, the thoroughly excellent Reverend
Henry Frinſham, A.M. eſteemed when at Oxford, and
till debilitated by illneſs, the ſtrongeſt, <q rend="inline">"beſt-built"</q> man in
England. Mr. Frinſham and his grandſon were both ſix
feet high without their ſhoes: each took care not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted

Mr. Berkeley could not look into a glaſs without perceiving that he did not reſemble his Father. His agreeable wit uſed to divert his friends, by ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Some poor ſimple perſon, now and then, meaning to flatter <hi>my</hi> Mother, ſays, 'Dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, how much Mr. Berkeley reſembles the Doctor;' I, who know <hi>le deſous des cartes,</hi> ſee my Mother redden, and anſwer, 'Oh! dear Sir, or Madam, <hi>not</hi> the <hi>leaſt in the world</hi>'—Sometimes a ſimpler ſoul ſays, Madam, I think Mr. Berkeley is very like you.—The firſt was bad enough, but now I can fancy I ſee my Mother getting her knuckles ready to knock them down."</q>—Mrs. Berkeley uſed often to laugh, and ſay, <q rend="inline">"Berkeley, how is it that, with very fine eyes, &amp;c. an exquiſitely fine complexion, the fineſt teeth ever ſet in a head, and very fine hair, and a well-ſhaped face, <hi>you are not</hi> handſome."</q> A moſt highly accompliſhed, ſenſible, intimate friend of Mr. Berkeley's Mother, the lady of D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

dark eye-brows and eye-laſhes<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Monck Berkeley's eyelaſhes were ſo remarkably long, as often, when he was a lad, to entangle and diſtreſs him when reading; a decoration of face to which he was indebted, as well as his Brother, to their Mother, who conſtantly cut them with a fine pair of ſciſſors twice every moon: It is an infallible method of rendering them long and thick. With Mr. Berkeley it was attended with ſome little difficulty, from the extreme volatility of his motions. Dr. Berkeley and all her intimate friends thought her the moſt daring of ſpirits to venture to do it before Mr. Berkeley could liſten to reaſon. It was then done when he was in a ſound ſleep. Afterwards with the following exhortation:—<q rend="inline">"Now, child, ſtand as ſtill as a ſtatue; for, if you move your finger, or your eye, the leaſt in the world, in go the ſciſſors, and out goes your eye."</q>

Dr. Berkeley's family once attending ſome friends of
theirs of too high rank to be left entirely to the verger of
the week to view the curioſities of the magnificent cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
of Canterbury; on reaching the tomb of the Black
Prince, the ſword was taken out as uſual, and delivered to
the company to admire. When going to be again depoſited
within the iron railing, Mr. Berkeley took it into his hands,
and drew it with as much eaſe as he would have drawn his
own ſword. Mrs. Preſton, the verger's wife, exclaimed,
<q rend="inline">"Good Lord! Sir, what have you done?"</q> Mr. Berkeley's
Mother inſtantly ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I hope no harm. My dear Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
why would you draw it without aſking if it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to be drawn?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Harm, Madam,"</q> replied the
worthy woman; <q rend="inline">"Mr. Berkeley has done no harm, if he
has not hurt himſelf;"</q> adding, <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir; I ſuppoſe I
have ſeen more than an hundred gentlemen attempt to
draw that ſword, but no one ever accompliſhed it with
one hand but yourſelf."</q> Mrs. Berkeley's alarm then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided,
and ſhe replied, <q rend="inline">"He has his Mother's and Grand-father's
wonderful ſtrength of wriſt."</q> So entirely muſcular
was his ſtrength, that, a ſhort time before his death, that
wriſt that could lift a man nearly as tall as himſelf by the
<pb n="cxxxiii" facs="tcp:0761700600:141"/>
collar of the coat, did not meaſure half an inch more than
his Mother's, who is a very little woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Monck Berkeley's perſon altogether made what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
uſually term a very fine looking young man. He was
ſo exactly proportioned, that he never appeared a tall man,
except when ſtanding in a groupe. He had a moſt graceful
figure, and was eſteemed the fineſt dancer of his ſtature
in England. At the famous maſquerade given by the late
Lord Barrymore at Wargrove, where Mr. Berkeley ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
as an Highland Chief, moſt completely elegantly
equipped; purſe, claymore, dirk, &amp;c. every thing but the
kelt, inſted of which he wore the trowſe; two maſks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted
him with, <q rend="inline">"Laird, are you for a Highland reel?"</q>
Mr. Berkeley inſtantly gave his claymore to a gentleman to
hold, ſtepped forward, and they began a <hi>threeſome reel,</hi> in
which the ſuperiority of Mr. Berkeley's dancing was ſo
marked, as to cauſe a very great perſonage, who honoured
that moſt elegant maſquerade with his preſence, to ſtand the
whole time, and to ſay, at the expiration of that beautiful
dance, when well danced by <hi>Scots,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"that Mr. Berkeley was
the fineſt figure, and the fineſt dancer he had ever ſeen;"</q>
and praiſe from thoſe who excel in any art, is <hi>praiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley, although not regularly handſome, had
perhaps one of the moſt pleaſing countenances any where
to be ſeen—a look of the deepeſt thought, enlightened by
<pb n="cxxxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:142"/>
the ſweeteſt, mildeſt benevolence, and, when called forth,
brightened by the livelieſt chaſtized gaiety; which has
cauſed ſome of the firſt characters for learning and ſenſe
to aſſert, that Mr. Monck Berkeley was the moſt agreeable
companion they had ever known. That look of deep
thought, and exquiſite benevolence, ſeldom united in the
ſame ſoul, ſeldomer blended in the ſame countenance, are
ſo aſtoniſhingly preſerved in the beautiful portrait painted
by his beloved friend, Mr. Peters, and by that throughly
amiable gentleman preſented to Mrs. Berkeley after her
Son's death, as to delight all who have a ſoul capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
the beauties of an exquiſite painting. The print
prefixed to the Poems is taken from that exquiſite painting;
but Engraving cannot give the ſoul like Painting. Mrs.
Berkeley eſteems herſelf rich in a moſt beautiful miniature
of her unſpeakably dear Son, ſo ſmall as conſtantly to be
carried in the pocket, taken from Mr. Peters's portrait, by
the wonderful, the magic pencil of her excellent accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
friend, Miſs Johnſon, of the Paddock-Houſe near
Canterbury. Whoever has an eye for fine painting, and
has been treated with a fight of that Lady's performances,
muſt be ſenſible of the happineſs of poſſeſſing one of a dear
departed friend. It can hardly be ſaid departed. He is
preſent, and does every thing but articulate. Such obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
are not to be repaid. The mines of Brazil, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed,
are not adequate. Mrs. Berkeley was ſome years
ago indebted to the ſame exquiſite pencil for a bracelet
<pb n="cxxxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:143"/>
of her youngeſt Son, done entirely from memory; for two
indifferent pictures of that beautiful child rather confuſed
than aſſiſted.</p>
               <p>At the King's School at Canterbury a common amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the lower ſchool was playing at <hi>judge and jury.</hi>
Counſel were regularly retained to plead on each ſide. By
accident Dr. Berkeley diſcovered the value that was ſet on
his Son's oratorical powers in that mimic court, on firſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it from the amiable beloved friend of his Son, the
late Mr. Thurlow, ſon of Lord Thurlow, whoſe play hours
were conſtantly ſpent under the hoſpitable roof of Dr.
Berkeley, who enquiring how the counſel were feed, he
replied, <q rend="inline">"Oh! we have all the ſame fee, a halfpenny apiece,
excepting Berkeley, and he has always a penny."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"A
penny! (replied Dr. Berkeley,) why ſhould he have a
penny? I am ſure, he is not covetous."</q>—<q rend="inline">"No, no; but
they <hi>will</hi> give it him, becauſe <hi>they</hi> are ſure to <hi>win</hi> their
cauſe who have Berkeley on their ſide."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps it may gratify ſome young gentlemen, his ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felows,
in diſtant parts of the world, and bring the happy
innocent days of very early youth to their remembrance, if
they ſhould glance their eye over this, to ſee their names.
At the head of this liſt ſtands dear angelic-hearted Mr.

Dr. Berkeley never aſked, during his life, but two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of miniſtry—equal to the exchanging two half-crowns
for five ſhillings, or two ſix-pences for a ſhilling: both,
however, were <hi>too great</hi> to be granted to the grandſon of
the Speaker of the Iriſh Houſe of Commons—to the ſon of
Biſhop Berkeley. When his ſon left Canterbury School,
he wiſhed to exchange his ſtall at Canterbury for either
Windſor or Weſtminſter, to ſuperintend the education of
his Son at one of thoſe ſchools. He preferred Windſor.
Some years after, on his Son's leaving Eton, he again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted

               <p>The exquiſite amiability of Mr. Berkeley's <hi>nature, not his

was <hi>re-formed</hi> by EDUCATION, <hi>re-generated</hi> by GRACE.
His nature, as has been ſhewn, was throughly NOBLE, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly
generous. He had by both his Parents, from
infancy, been bred up, with an horror of being what is
called a TUFT HUNTER at Oxford, or a ſneaking LORD

than Mr. Berkeley, was ſent from under the protection of
his ſenſible, wonderfully kind <hi>adopting</hi> father, the Reverend
Mr. Hey of Wickham, whoſe lady, above-named, was his
Mother's eldeſt ſiſter. The Writer cannot proceed without
heaving a ſigh, and dropping a tear of friendſhip over the
urn of that moſt ſenſible, intereſting of youths, the only ſon
of dear Thurlow's <hi>earthly guardian angel,</hi> Mr. Hey. She
ſtill feels pleaſure in recollecting how often he uſed to ſay,
<q rend="inline">"Is it not very odd, that, although I have uncles, aunts,
and many kind relations, who are very good to me; yet
I always feel myſelf more at home at Dr. Berkeley's?"</q>
He was about fifteen; a youth of a very ſingular turn of
mind, endowed with all his father's great underſtanding,
<pb n="cxli" facs="tcp:0761700600:149"/>
and all the real, mild, not affected, gentleneſs of his lovely
mother. A ſtrong tincture of melancholy was viſible to
even a common obſerver. As a child at home, it was ſaid
he never loved to play; at ſchool he never played at cric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
&amp;c. longer than ten minutes, then retired to read.
Mrs. Berkeley's wiſh to delight the mother of an only child
occaſioned her telling her ſervants, <q rend="inline">"that whenever Mrs.
Hey's carriage came to Dr. Berkeley's, ſome ſervant man,
or woman, muſt go immediately to Dr. Beauvoir's, where
he boarded, to fetch Maſter Hey."</q> Both mother and
ſon felt more than this little <hi>motherly</hi> attention merited.
Mrs. Berkeley told Maſter Hey, when he felt himſelf low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited,
and had no more agreeable place to take his tea,
he would find it in her dreſſing-room at ſix, where he
would, ſometimes, enjoy the very improving converſation
of that accompliſhed, that wiſe director of young men, Dr.
Berkeley; if not, he might diſſipate his gloom a little, by
hearing her <hi>raileries</hi> on his gravity, &amp;c. at fifteen, Mrs.
Berkeley, having been in the ſame predicament herſelf, at
twelve, with a youth of thirteen. Dear Johnny, as he was
always called by Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley, had contrived very
early in life, before he was thirteen, to form an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that did not contribute to diſſipate the natural gloom
of his mind, although it often exhilarated him.</p>
               <p>The youngeſt daughter of the celebrated Mr. Airſon,
although very far from handſome, was bleſſed with ſo very
<pb n="cxlii" facs="tcp:0761700600:150"/>
fine an underſtanding, that all the uncommonly ſenſible
youths, and even lads, were her devoted admirers, as others
were of the great beauty of Dr. Beauvoir's eldeſt daughter,
now married to William Hammond, Eſquire, of the Friers,
Canterbury. Miſs Airſon died at the age of nineteen.
Mrs. Berkeley uſed to ſay of her, <q rend="inline">"that ſhe had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
enough to ſet up a large country town."</q> Her
gratitude was great indeed, (that VERY ſcarce virtue, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only in an <hi>humble</hi> heart, and cheriſhed by a ſtrong
head;) for what <hi>ſhe</hi> deemed the condeſcending attentions
of Mrs. Berkeley to her, her father being a <hi>Minor</hi> where
Mrs. Berkeley's huſband was a <hi>Major.</hi> Although very
kindly treated at Canterbury to what they are in moſt other
Cathedrals and Choirs, Norwich excepted; the Minor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canons
and Schoolmaſters, their wives and daughters, are
in a very different line of company. In general, their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
fortunes, and always their church incomes, are
undoubtedly ſo much inferior, as not to make them <hi>wiſh</hi> to
mix. Mrs. Berkeley, on being once reproached by a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendary's
lady, for introducing Miſs Airſons at her routs,
and being intimate with their elegant, ſweet mother,
made this laconic reply: <q rend="inline">"Why, my dear Madam, Mrs.
Airſon's father had almoſt as many thouſands a year as
<hi>my</hi> father had hundreds; and if Mrs. Airſon choſe to
marry the firſt ſinger in the world, a clergyman and a
<hi>gentleman,</hi> rather than a fooliſh ignoramus in a red coat,
does that make her converſation the leſs pleaſing to me?

Mr. Airſon and his family were ſo highly, ſo
univerſally reſpected, that their ſmall houſe was the reſort
of all perſons of faſhion and good ſenſe. The late amiable
Biſhop of Norwich, when Dean of Canterbury, would
often, when walking out, ſay, <q rend="inline">"Come, my dear Madam,
ſuppoſe we go to Johnny's coffee-houſe."</q> Mr. Airſon,
a great invalid, never dined, or even drank tea from home.
He never confined his lady or daughters; they well knew
<hi>he</hi> would not paſs his afternoons alone. His piety almoſt
equalled his muſical powers; which he never would uſe,
(except in a private room to his friends,) but in the houſe
of that God who beſtowed them<note n="†" place="bottom">It uſed ſometimes to be ſaid that Mr. Airſon was indolent, and did not ſing a fine anthem. When aſked if he <hi>thought</hi> himſelf ill, he uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"Aſk Mrs. Berkley, if I ever in my life, when able to go to church, refuſed ſinging any anthem when ſhe deſired it of me."</q> Mrs. Berkeley herſelf had an idea of not riding a free horſe to death.</note>. Handel offered him
eight hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> if he would only ſing in
the Oratorios in Lent, but he refuſed it. It is ſomewhat
remarkable that the Sunday after his very ſudden death,
the late Biſhop of Norwich, then Dean of Canterbury, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
his loſs, and celebrated his virtues, in ſimilar words
<pb n="cxliv" facs="tcp:0761700600:152"/>
to thoſe uſed by the Writer of this Preface in the Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
Paper the preceding day, when lamenting the loſs of
that cheerful, gay, heavenly-minded friend, whom ſhe
had ſo far, <hi>en gaieté de coeur,</hi> prevailed on, to accompany her
as far as his hall, in her way to a rout at his next door
neighbour's, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"She ſhould attract <hi>all</hi> eyes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the thanks of <hi>all</hi> the company."</q> His gentle, amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
eldeſt daughter, then his <hi>all,</hi> ſince married to Mr.
Allen of Hereford, her mother and ſiſter being gone, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to his having on his <hi>old</hi> coat, and begging him to
put on his <hi>ſmart</hi> new one. To this Mrs. Berkeley ſtrongly
objected, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"It might, tender as he was, occaſion
his taking cold."</q> Had he gone, ſhe would ever have
reproached herſelf, as the cauſe of his univerſally lamented
death.</p>
               <p>It is now more than high time to return from this too
long digreſſion; but the reciting the virtues of beloved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
friends, NOW beyond the reach of any other atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is apt, in a heart ſuſceptible of <hi>ſincere</hi> regard for
real worth, to give the pen a diſorder, which the French
apply to the tongue of one who talks too much, <hi>il a une
fluxe de langue.</hi> The Writer often feels <hi>la fluxe de plume.</hi>
She is ſometimes tempted to form the wiſh of an old friend
of hers, whoſe huſband made her, ſhe being a ready pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
write much for him, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Well; I do wiſh I had never
been taught to write at all.</hi>"</q> Perhaps the readers of this
<pb n="cxlv" facs="tcp:0761700600:153"/>
may form it for her; but it is not neceſſary to read the
whole of every book; and, to uſe the language of Holy
Writ, they may <q rend="inline">"<hi>ſeparate the precious from the vile.</hi>"</q> They
may read the fine Poetry of the Author, and paſs over the
indifferent Proſe of the Editor.</p>
               <p>Whenever Mr. Monck Berkeley obſerved any boy, who
boarded at either of the Maſters, never invited out to
dinner on holidays, he would ſay to his Mother, <q rend="inline">"Pray,
my dear Madam, next holiday invite poor ſuch an one,
and ſuch an one. Poor things, they have no relations or
acquaintance here to invite them; and it is very dull for
them. Pray be ſo good as to let them come here."</q> This
whether they were his intimates or not. Indeed his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
ſeldom did come, having, moſt of them, parents in
the church or city, excepting ſometimes the Reverend
Cooper Willyams, of Ixning, ſon of the very worthy Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and Mrs. Willyams, and Captain Gregory, of the
Wiltſhire Militia, ſon of the very learned Reverend Francis
Gregory of Canterbury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thurlow happened to come to ſchool in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of ſummer, when all his uncles and aunts, uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
in Canterbury during the winter, had retired to
their country reſidences. Mr. Berkeley ſoon preſented his
humble petition to his Mother, that he might bring Thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="cxlvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:154"/>
home ſometimes. The requeſt was granted; and the
good diſpoſition, the propriety, the docility, the worthineſs
of Mr. Thurlow, ſoon endeared him ſo much to Mrs.
Berkeley, that ſhe told her Son <q rend="inline">"he might bring Thurlow,
but no other boy, without aſking her permiſſion, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he pleaſed."</q> The dear child generally drank tea
every evening in <hi>winter</hi> at Dr. Berkeley's, for in <hi>ſummer</hi>
they are all
<q>"over the hills and far away."</q>
When he was a little more than nine years old, he, like
his friend Mr. Berkeley, was ſent to France, for ſeveral
months, to acquire the French language in perfection. At
his return he gave a proof of the exquiſite ſenſibility of his
heart<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſhort character and ſincere lamentation of this early (not untimely—for GOD's time is ever the beſt time) death of this beloved young gentleman was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by his friend Mrs. Berkeley. in Briſtow's Canterbury Journal. It fell ſhort in deſcribing his amiability: but the Editor cannot let a beloved friend, whether young or old, quit this mortal ſcene, without paying that little tribute to their memory—when ſhe ſees it neglected by abler pens.</note>. On his arrival in England, he went from Dover,
for a ſhort time, to the houſe of his kind patron Mr. Hey,
who ſoon brought him to Canterbury for a day. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
he got out of the carriage he flew to the Oaks,
knocked at the door, and begged he might be ſhown up to
Mrs. Berkeley. Being told ſhe was in bed with a bad head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,
he expreſſed much concern, and enquired what time ſhe
<pb n="cxlvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:155"/>
would riſe; the ſervant replied, <q rend="inline">"moſt likely to dinner;"</q>
as ſhe never continued in bed, when not exceedingly ill.
At a little before the dinner hour he came; Mrs. Berkeley
not riſen. About five in the afternoon he called again,
and, hearing Mrs. Berkeley was not up, begged to ſee her
own maid, whom he thus addreſſed: <q rend="inline">"Pray, be ſo good
as to go up to Mrs. Berkeley, and give my tendereſt love
to her; tell her, I long ſo much to ſee her, that I beg
ſhe will permit me to go up, and ſtand a few minutes
at her bed ſide, as I ſhall not be in Canterbury again
theſe four days."</q> The ſervant came up; Mrs. Berkeley
ſaid, <q rend="inline">"She was very ſorry, but hoped ſhe ſhould be able
to ſee him the next time he came."</q> The ſervant replied,
<q rend="inline">"Dear Madam, he is but a child, and he longs ſo to ſee
you, it will half break his heart if he does not."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Well,
poor dear child, let him come up then."</q> The moment
he reached the bed ſide he caught Mrs. Berkeley's hand,
kiſſed it, and burſting into tears, kneeled down, and, after
ſobbing ſome time, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I hope, my dear Madam, that
you are not dangerouſly ill."</q> Mrs. Berkeley, with her
uſual good ſpirits in illneſs, replied, <q rend="inline">"No, my dear Charles
I hope in God I am not. I have the old proverb on my
ſide, <hi>that nought is never in danger.</hi>"</q> What would not ſome
perſons give for a ſon with <hi>ſuch an heart,</hi> and a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
head? During his laſt lingering illneſs, at the
houſe of his excellent uncle, the amiable, generous, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
<pb n="cxlviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:156"/>
Dr. Lynch, Prebendary of Canterbury, where
every thing that kindneſs could ſuggeſt, and cleverneſs could
execute, was prepared for him, he would perpetually ſay,
<q rend="inline">"Go to next door, with my beſt regards to Mrs. Berkeley,
and beg her to ſend me ſomething, whatever ſhe pleaſes,
out of her ſtore-room; I know I can eat that."</q> Mr.
Berkeley's earneſt requeſt to his Mother, who was to reach
Canterbury after their arrival from Scotland many weeks
before <hi>he</hi> could, being obliged to keep term at the Temple,
was, <q rend="inline">"Pray learn, and write me word immediately, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Thurlow is returned to England; and, if he is, where
I may find him."</q> Mrs. Berkeley, who uſed laughingly
to ſay, ſhe was as obedient a Mother, after Mr. Berkeley
grew up, as ſhe had <hi>made</hi> him a Son in his childhood and
youth, obeyed, and ſoon executed her commiſſion, and
Mr. Berkeley and Mr. Thurlow came down in the ſame
chaiſe, one to the Oaks, the other to Wickham, on Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
eve, the moſt dreadful, cold, ſnowing day one can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.
Both were almoſt literally frozen when they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at Dr. Berkeley's; and it was an alarming time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſeemed to feel any effect from what was given
them.</p>
               <p>Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley reproached Mr. Berkeley for not
ſtopping all night at the PALACE of Mr. Simpſon, the Roſe
at Sittingbourne, where every comfort, convenience, and
<pb n="cxlix" facs="tcp:0761700600:157"/>
elegance, is to be found from the excellent Maſter, Miſtreſs,
and the wonderfully worthy Chamber-maid, Mrs. Mary
Humphreys<note n="*" place="bottom">As a proof of her worthineſs, one night when Dr. Berkeley's family ſlept there, Mrs. Berkeley's maid ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Madam, the maid you admire ſo much for her care and honeſty has juſt now gone up into a gentleman's room, and made him riſe, ſaying, that the under-chamber-maid had miſtaken her, and put him into a wrong bed, not ſufficiently aired, but that the other was quite ready; begged his pardon for her deputy's careleſſneſs, that ſhe was attending to <hi>your</hi> beds, and thought the other could not have miſtaken; but that ſhe could never have forgiven herſelf had ſhe ever put any one into an half-aired bed."</q> Oh! that all inn-ſervants were as careful! The Writer of this Note has twice, once in France, and once in England, ſuffered from want of ſuch care. This worthy woman's education was ſingular. She is by birth a native of Wales. Being her father's tenth child, the worthy miniſter of the pariſh, having no child of his own, ſaid, he would take her as a <hi>tithe-child.</hi> Under the roof of this humane worthy miniſter of Chriſt ſhe grew up, and remained till his death. She certainly does not diſgrace her education received under the roof, in the kitchen, for he was too wiſe to bring up a labourer's daughter as a gentlewoman—to ſtarve, or become a ſtreet-walker.</note>. It, however, pleaſed the mercy of God
that the two friends received not the leaſt injury from this
frightful journey. To adopt the language of the excellent
Monſieur De Pontis in his delightfully entertaining, <hi>although</hi>
pious, Mémoires (which that execrable monſter, Voltaire,
has tried to perſuade fools and atheiſts is a fable, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
Madame De Sevigné mentions his death, &amp;c. at
the time), God waited for them elſewhere; for dear Thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
was doomed to fall an early victim to ENGLISH
INHOSPITALITY, as himſelf related to Dr. Berkeley, whom
he had ſo frequently heard celebrated the lovely hoſpitality
<pb n="cl" facs="tcp:0761700600:158"/>
of Scotland: <q rend="inline">"I owe, ſaid he, my preſent illneſs to the want
of it in England. I had been out hunting, was caught
in a violent ſtorm, was quite wet through, called at a
gentleman's, where <hi>I hoped</hi> to have been taken in. I was
offered wine and brandy, the butler called, but no offer
of a bed for a few hours, or of going in to dry my cloaths;
ſo, after having ſat on my horſe, the ſtorm over, at the
gate, in cold, wet cloaths, I proceeded to Cambridge, and
went to my rooms; but the cold fixed on my lungs, and
no ſkill has been able to remove it."</q> Alas! it not long
after removed him, and robbed his friends and the world of
one of the moſt amiable-hearted, grateful of human beings.
Adieu, dear youth. <hi>Requieſcat in pace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Mr. Thurlow was about eleven years old, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
the Biſhop of Durham, then Dean of Rocheſter, when
paſſing through Canterbury to the ſea, and conceiving his
old friend Dr. Berkeley's houſe to be the beſt, as he knew
it was the <note n="*" place="bottom">Mrs. Berkeley, who ſeldom leaves home for more than three hours at a time, <hi>i.e.</hi> from ſix to nine in the evening, nor wiſhes to ſee any friend, unleſs travelling near her, at any other time, uſed to occaſion Mr. Monck Berkeley's often ſaying, <q rend="inline">"if my Aunt, Father, and ſelf, were all dead, my Mother would never miſs us until the ſervant announced to her that the urn was carried into the drawing-room."</q> The <hi>Trio</hi> all agreed to this charge. <q rend="inline">"On entering it, ſhe would aſk, 'Where are they all?' and begin lamenting the loſs of us."</q> Mrs. Berkeley uſed often to be laughed at by Dr. Berkeley and Mrs. Frinſham, for declaring that ſhe ate her dinner quite as well alone as in the beſt company. When Dr. Berkeley, at the age of twenty-four, took from Chriſt Church the little living of Aſgarton, near the Vale of White Horſe, he found the houſe a hovel; and, having been bred in a palace, he loved a good houſe. However, after laying out near four hundred pounds on the houſe, and building a fine South wall in the garden, finding it too ſmall to lodge his <hi>few</hi> friends—the Reverend James Hamilton, grandſon of Lord Abercorne, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant delightful viſitor, through the whole ſummer, at Dr. Berkeley's, at Bray, or Acton, until his removal by the late Lord Abercorne to a great living in Ireland, and ſome others, together with a multitude of <hi>locuſts</hi>—finding the vicarage too ſmall, he rented Ley Farm, the country houſe of Sir Nathaniel Naſh. Until his removal to Bray, the Biſhop of Durham, then Curate of Wantage, was a very conſtant frequent viſitor there.</note>cheapeſt inn in Canterbury, drove to the
<pb n="cli" facs="tcp:0761700600:159"/>
Oaks. No ſooner was his arrival notified to Mrs. Berkeley,
than ſhe ordered Mr. Wrightſon to go and tell his Maſter
a perſon wanted to ſpeak to him. Mrs. Berkeley conjured
him to permit her to ſend to Dr. Beauvoir's for dear
Charles. Dr. Berkeley, with his uſual good-will to man
and child, complied. John (now Mr. Wrightſon), as the
beſt meſſenger, was diſpatched, to beg that Miſs Beauvoir
would order Maſter Thurlow to be arrayed in his Sunday
garb, and poſted off to Dr. Berkeley's, notifying the cauſe.
Mrs. Berkeley ordered Mr. Wrightſon to call out his Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
when the little man arrived. Accordingly, in a few
minutes, Dr. Berkeley, looking like a beautiful guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel
of thoſe <q rend="inline">"<hi>little ones</hi>"</q> mentioned by our bleſſed Lord,
entered the drawing-room, leading in his little <hi>protegé,</hi>
whom he preſented to the Dean. <q rend="inline">"Here, my old friend, is
a very good little man, who is very nearly related to you."</q>
                  <pb n="clii" facs="tcp:0761700600:160"/>
The Dean looked about as <hi>éveillé</hi> as uſual, ſtroked his
head, and aſked him how he liked ſchool, and ſome other
queſtions generally put to children. In the afternoon he
told him to ſtand by him at the card-table; and when the
time arrived for Charles to make his bow and return to
Dr. Beauvoir's, the Dean, who had won about a guinea,
<hi>generouſly</hi> preſented poor dear Charles with <hi>two and ſixpence;</hi>
for which he made one of his graceful French bows, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.
They never met again, until they met in the regions
of departed ſpirits. <hi>Some</hi> perſons have even doubted whether
poor Thurlow could be found <hi>worthy</hi> of a place to behold
the glory of the <q rend="inline">"ANGEL of the Church of Durham."</q> The
reſemblance in face and perſon of Mr. Thurlow to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
was remarkably ſtriking to all the company, allowing
only that the tempers and diſpoſitions of his mind were
entirely Lynch and Wake, which threw a look of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
into his features and countenance, which did <hi>not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi>
in the Biſhop's.</p>
               <p>About the year 1786 there died at Canterbury a very
excellent young man, an old ſchool-fellow of Mr. Berkeley's,
Mr. George Haſted, ſon of the Author of the Hiſtory of
Kent. On Mr. Berkeley's arrival, in vacation-time, Mrs.
Berkeley aſked her Son <q rend="inline">"if he was not afflicted at the
death of his old intimate, George Haſted?"</q> He replied,
<q rend="inline">"I was very ſorry for the death of ſo very worthy a young
man; but, my dear Mother, <hi>he</hi> was <hi>never</hi> an intimate
<pb n="cliii" facs="tcp:0761700600:161"/>
of mine. HE was much too ſtudious and diligent for <hi>us;</hi>
was in quite another ſet: he pitied us for our idleneſs
and folly. George Haſted would never go to cricket, or
to Bingley (where the King's ſcholars ſwim in ſummer)
till he had done every tittle of his exerciſe. We all ſet
off, and left it to chance to get our exerciſe done, or, if
not done, get a ſound flogging."</q> Had Mr. Berkeley, when
a boy, been told that nobody could learn Latin or Greek,
he would have ſtudied night and day<note n="*" place="bottom">Every night, juſt before the family went to ſupper, Mrs. Berkeley uſed to go into both her little boys rooms, to ſee whether they lay ſtraight, and in a wholeſome poſture, which is of more conſequence to children than people in general are aware of. One night, when Mr. Berkeley was about five years old, on entering the room, ſhe found his fine eyes wide open. She aſked him <q rend="inline">"how he came to be awake, and how he <hi>dared</hi> to have his eyes open?"</q>—being always ordered to ſhut them when in bed, or in a dark room. He replied, <q rend="inline">"I have not been aſleep at all: I have been <hi>racking</hi> my brain to try to make a ſyllable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a vowel, becauſe you have always told me it was impoſſible to do it—and if I could have done it, it would have made me very happy to have come and told you of it."</q>
                  </note>. Tell him, from
five years old, of any thing that it was impoſſible to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh,
and he was indefatigable in labouring at it: his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
juſt the reverſe. Perhaps never were two children,
born of the ſame Father and Mother, more different: Mr.
Berkeley would add, <q rend="inline">"Always excepting <hi>my Mother</hi> and
<hi>her only ſiſter.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley, gay, lively, volatile, yet wonderfully
ſolid; his brother, ſedate, grave, yet wonderfully witty;
<pb n="cliv" facs="tcp:0761700600:162"/>
both Poets from the time they could articulate at all; both
enthuſiaſtic admirers of muſic. Neither Mr. Berkeley nor
his brother were ever ſuffered to go to Bingley to ſwim,
without their Mother's leave. Mr. Berkeley uſed to come
regularly, when the maſters had given permiſſion to the
boys, with his requeſt.</p>

               <p>His brother coming with the ſame requeſt, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

his dear brother required <q rend="inline">"<hi>a threefold cord.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley, when a lad too old for correction, would,
when his Mother deſired him not to go to ſuch a place, or
do ſuch a thing, immediately reply, <q rend="inline">"Well, then, my
dear Madam, <hi>command</hi> me."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Command you, my
dear; I do not love commanding. I never wiſh to exert
my authority: I <hi>deſire</hi> that you will <hi>not</hi> do it."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Yes,
I muſt; all the deſiring in the world <hi>will not do.</hi>"</q>—<q rend="inline">"That
is very ſtrange."</q>—<q rend="inline">"I cannot help it. Why won't you
ſay, Berkeley, <hi>I command</hi> you not to do it?"</q>—The magic
words, by his earneſt deſire, being uttered, he would ſay,
<q rend="inline">"Well, now I am happy; now I have not the leaſt wiſh in the
world to do it; would not do it for any ſum of money."</q>
When he was about thirteen years old, the news of the day
<pb n="clvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:164"/>
was, a run-a-way match of a young man of rank. A gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
viſiting at Dr. Berkeley's, turned to Mr. Monck Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Aye, in three or four years, young 'ſquire,
<hi>you</hi> will be playing the ſame prank."</q> It is impoſſible for
any one then preſent to forget the dignified ſolemnity of
Mr. Berkeley's countenance, whilſt he uttered the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reply: <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, <hi>I hope</hi> not. GOD FORBID that I
ſhould ever do ſo <hi>important</hi> a thing as MARRY without the
<hi>full</hi> conſent of my Parents."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley was certainly a very extraordinary proof of
the bleſſed effects of education. A witty friend of the
Editor's uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"If God will but ſend Mrs. Berkeley's
children a tolerable pair of eyes, and all their limbs, ſhe
aſks no more<note n="*" place="bottom">This lady might have added, good underſtandings; for the Editor, when a young woman, probably after the death of a young gentleman who had been tenderly attached to her from his age of twelve, and hers of eleven, he at Eton, ſhe at Mrs. Sheeles, until he, at near nineteen, died a Gentleman Commoner of Trinity College, Oxford, uſed frequently to tell her mother, <q rend="inline">"She feared to marry, leſt, if ſhe ſhould have children, they ſhould have weak under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, which would break her heart."</q> To which Mrs. Frinſham uſed to reply: <q rend="inline">"Surely it is the oddeſt idea that ever entered into the mind of woman. I never thought of any ſuch thing. Thank God, none of my family have ever been fools; nor, I hope, knaves; and why, if you have children, they ſhould be ſuch, I cannot conceive. I am ſure <hi>you</hi> will <hi>never</hi> marry a fool."</q> God heard the Editor's prayers; for certainly her dear children were <hi>not</hi> FOOLS.</note>: ſhe will trim them and twiſt them into
handſome faces, and fine figures; but ſhe is not up to
<hi>making eyes.</hi>"</q> Mr. Berkeley, when grown up, uſed often
to divert his Father and friends, by drawing his Mother's
<pb n="clvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:165"/>
character—ſhe preſent. He uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"My Mother has
<hi>no</hi> mercy on her own ſex; but little for the other. Every
fault, every defect, related of any young man, ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
replies, 'Poor creature, that was his <hi>mother's</hi>
fault.' In ſhort, ſhe lays every fault, of every kind, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
not writing a good Greek epigram, or Latin oration,
on a man's Mother: but ſhe was an early ſtudier of Lord
Halifax's Advice to a Daughter."</q> He uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"My
Mother, I believe, keeps a folio ſheet of paper, with all
the virtues of her friends emblazoned on one ſide, and
their faults on the other. Whilſt they act worthily and
honourably, you never ſuppoſe they have any fault or
foible; let them but act unworthily to any one, and the
paper is reverſed, and you hear all their faults. My
Mother always carries a <hi>little</hi> cat-o-nine-tails in her
pocket; and if any fool blaſphemes or ridicules Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
out it comes, and he is very ſpeedily made
the laugh of all the company. If my Mother was
not my Mother, I would bribe her with five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds to become my friend."</q> To which Mrs.
Berkeley uſed to reply, <q rend="inline">"You varlet, you know it would
be all in vain; for <hi>your Mother</hi> would not be bribed to
flatter Royalty any more than your Worſhip, who, thank
God, will not condeſcend to flatter any one, although
you often, by your benevolence and great perſonal ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
are led to cultivate intimacies with <hi>vaut-riens,</hi> male
and female, ſome of rank among your own relations."</q>

Of Mr. Monck Berkeley's genius many of thoſe who have
redde what he has written may be competent judges. To
attempt to do juſtice to the exquiſite amiability, generoſity,
and nobleneſs of his heart, and the wonderful ſtrength and
ſoundneſs of his judgement, even in early youth, requires
the knowledge of the Editor, and the pen of his favourite
Dr. Johnſon.</p>
               <p>His attentions to the poor, from his childhood, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitting.
The arguments of his Mother to diſſuade
him from waſting his alms on common beggars, thoſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
robbers of the honeſt labouring poor, were all in vain.
His anſwer always was, <q rend="inline">"My dear Madam, I am fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the truth of your reaſoning; and, I do believe,
I never did relieve a common beggar in my life that was
not a <hi>vaut-rein;</hi> yet, ſhould I ever hear that any poor
creature had periſhed, who had aſked charity of me, and
I had not relieved him, I know I never could forgive
myſelf through life."</q> So well was his character known
to theſe wretches, that they frequently aſked in the village
near which his Father reſided, <q rend="inline">"If the 'Squire was at home,
for if he is not, it is not worth while to turn out of the
way to the houſe, as the Doctor and the Lady never <hi>give
any thing to</hi> POOR TRAVELLERS."</q> The fact is certain,
that they never came but when Mr. Berkeley was in
the country, which occaſioned Mrs. Berkeley's telling her
Son, <hi>that they were his viſitors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="clix" facs="tcp:0761700600:167"/>
Mr. Berkeley, as has been obſerved above, was remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
generous, and had what is commonly called a <hi>princely</hi>
ſpirit. His beautiful brother was very ſaving, and even co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous;
he never parted with his money, but to the poor,
to whom he was very liberal indeed. So careful was he
of his money, that it uſed to be a diverſion to his Father
and Aunt to borrow ſixpence of him, and then tell him
that they were poor, and could not pay him: he would go
to his Mother, and deſire her to <hi>talk</hi> to them, and tell
them, <q rend="inline">"that it was not <hi>honeſt</hi> to borrow of people, and not
pay them again, and that <hi>abſolutely</hi> he could not afford to
loſe his money."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Monck Berkeley, when a child, once went and ſold
his buckles, to relieve a perſon in diſtreſs. When at Eton,
being unable to relieve a very large poor family near Bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
Side, to whom his Father had been exceedingly
bountiful, and the family being at Canterbury, he wrote to
his Mother, <q rend="inline">"I beg of you to ſend five or three guineas to
theſe poor creatures. My couſin," (the very worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
J. Hayes, <hi>then</hi> ſecond ſon of James Hayes, Eſquire,
Berkeley's amiable protector and director when he went to
Eton,) "and myſelf have given them all the money that
we have; but they are very poor ſtill."</q> Not getting an
anſwer as ſoon as he wiſhed, he riſqued a flogging, and
contrived, in company with an equally daring friend, to
ſcamper over to Cookham; there he ſold his little poney,
<pb n="clx" facs="tcp:0761700600:168"/>
and ſent them the money. A youth going from Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
School to Oxford, when Mr. Berkeley was about
twelve years old, he preſented him with his watch, chain,
and ſeal; for which being ſharply reproved by his Mother,
he ſweetly replied, <q rend="inline">"Why, I am but a boy, and he is
going to be a man; and it muſt be unpleaſant to him not
to have a watch, and I know he cannot afford to buy
one, and I can contrive to ſhift without one."</q> Such
was ever the nature of this lovely young man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley was, from his early youth, deſtined for the
Bar; where, had it pleaſed God to have ſpared his life,
and bleſſed him with health, he would, no doubt, have
reached the <hi>acme</hi> of his profeſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Monck Berkeley, going one evening to viſit his amiable, kind friend Mrs. Horne, then on a viſit at her father's, the very worthy, ſenſible Philip Burton, Eſquire; that gentleman deſired the Biſhop and Mrs. Horne to tell Dr. Berkeley, from him, <q rend="inline">"that he never ſaw a young man quite ſo likely to ſhine eminently at the bar, as his ſon;"</q> and obligingly added, <q rend="inline">"I have been near fifty years in Weſtminſter Hall, and I have very rarely failed in my ſentence of thoſe who would ſucceed, and who fail."</q> It is well known that Mr. Burton was a man of very ſuperior underſtanding, and a wonderfully agreeable pleaſant companion.</note>; for all who heard him
ſpeak pronounced him <hi>eminently</hi> qualified to make a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
figure, unleſs his very ſtrict ideas of honeſty had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
it. In early youth he had been earneſtly requeſted
by his Mother, when arguing, never, for the ſake of argument,
<pb n="clxi" facs="tcp:0761700600:169"/>
to improve in logic, to undertake the <hi>wrong</hi> ſide of the queſtion,
leſt it might warp his mind. He had ever moſt religiouſly
adhered to this advice; and, in more advanced years, always
declared, if he lived to ſpeak at the bar, which he early deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
he would not do until he had completed his twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eighth
year<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Berkeley had been often preſſed by his learned friends to break this reſolution; but his conſtant reply was, <q rend="inline">"So determined am I to adhere to it, that I will not keep my laſt term at the Temple until the term before;"</q> adding, <q rend="inline">"if <hi>ever</hi> a man ceaſes to be a coxcomb, or a fool, it is, ſurely, after having ſerved <hi>four</hi> apprenticeſhips to folly and nonſenſe."</q>
                  </note>, he would tell every client that applied to him,
that, if he found his cauſe to be an unjuſt one, he would
deſert it, <hi>even</hi> in Weſtminſter Hall. Mr. Berkeley had alſo
firmly reſolved never to plead <hi>againſt</hi> the fatherleſs, the
widow, or the clergy; and always to plead <hi>gratis</hi> for them,
if their circumſtances required it.</p>
               <p>It has been obſerved, that although Mr. Berkeley was
<hi>highly</hi> indebted to <hi>what</hi> we commonly call Nature, with
ſtrict propriety to the God of Nature, for a very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
fine underſtanding, quick ready wit, and, what does
not always accompany it, a very extraordinary ſtrength and
ſoundneſs of judgement, ſo as often to occaſion perſons to
remark, that he had all the brilliancy of Biſhop Berkeley's
imagination, and all the ſound, ſtrong judgement of Mr.
Cherry, of whom the great Charles Leſlie, the celebrated
controverſial writer, uſed to ſay, he thought God had not
<pb n="clxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:170"/>
beſtowed better judgement on man ſince the days of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
When Mr. Berkeley, with all his great vivacity in
early youth, often acted with the ſupremeſt caution, Mrs.
Berkeley uſed, to the great diverſion of Dr. Berkeley, to
ſay, <q rend="inline">"It was a happy thing for her children, that ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
a little LEAD into the family; for, although pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks
feathers were exquiſitely beautiful, yet, unleſs
tipped with a <hi>little</hi> weight, they naturally flew away to the
Moon."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley owed much alſo to education, to principles
very early inſtilled into him; to which he profeſſed, long
before, and during his laſt illneſs, he owed his greateſt
happineſs in <hi>life,</hi> his <hi>only</hi> hope in the proſpect of <hi>death,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he, through the free ſovereign grace of God, and the
rich mercy of Chriſt, arrived, by the inſtrumentality of a
moſt excellent book, to aſſurance of faith, feeling the <hi>full
force</hi> of that glorious promiſe of EMANUEL, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Him that
cometh to me I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi>"</q> He was enabled
to <hi>truſt,</hi> to <hi>go;</hi> and HAPPILY found, as <hi>all true penitents will,</hi>
a moſt gracious reception. May all true penitents be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to make the trial, and they will moſt certainly rejoice
through the countleſs ages of a <hi>bliſsful</hi> ETERNITY. But, alas!
our adored Redeemer himſelf ſays, <q rend="inline">"YE WILL NOT COME
UNTO ME, THAT YE MAY HAVE LIFE."</q> The Writer is well
aware of the <hi>ridicule, contempt, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> that will be <hi>liberally</hi>
beſtowed on her, on account of <hi>many</hi> things in this preface;
<pb n="clxiii" facs="tcp:0761700600:171"/>
yet, ever bearing in mind the admonition of an eminently pious
Mother, never to be aſhamed of that God, who lived, who
died, to redeem her; ever remembering his own <hi>emphatic</hi>
admonition, <q rend="inline">"Whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of ME, and of
My words, in this ADULTEROUS and ſinful generation,
of him (or <hi>her</hi>) ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed when
he cometh in his own glory,"</q> &amp;c. At the age of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
going to ſpend a few weeks with a near relation,
her Mother ſaid, <q rend="inline">"The firſt thing for which you will be
laughed at, is going to church on Sunday in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon;
yet <hi>never</hi> omit it. Your Mother has been laughed
to ſcorn for it years ago."</q> Then the above cited text
was repeatedly <hi>enforced:</hi> and although the Writer, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the moſt ſhy of human beings amongſt ſtrangers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
when young, on entering the room, crowding her
little inſignificant figure behind the door, that nobody
might look at her<note n="*" place="bottom">So as generally to occaſion her witty younger ſiſter, of courſe following her into the room when viſiting with their Mother, to ſay <q rend="inline">"For pity's ſake, my dear Miſs Frinſham, do not go into the room looking as if you had ſtolen your cloaths."</q> Mrs. Berkeley uſed ſadly to lament, after her mother's death, that <hi>ſhe</hi> was the <hi>eldeſt</hi> ſiſter.</note>; yet the firſt Sunday of her viſit ſhe
encountered the loud laugh of ten or eleven gentlemen and
ladies, for ſetting off to afternoon prayers. The lady at
whoſe houſe ſhe was on a viſit, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Oh! the young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's
Mother has brought her up with <hi>wonderfully</hi> ſtrict
notions of God and Religion; ſo I dare ſay ſhe <hi>will</hi> go."</q>
                  <hi>Go</hi> the young lady certainly did; but ſhe never remembers
<pb n="clxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:172"/>
to have ſuffered more in her <hi>whole</hi> life, than in that <hi>firſt</hi>
ſtruggle in the ſervice of her bleſſed Maſter, of her own
<hi>never dying</hi> ſoul. Living many years in the firſt company
cured that painful timidity. Converſing much with learned
and good men ſoon enabled her to become more than a
<hi>ſilent</hi> advocate for the honour of her bleſſed Maſter, when
ridiculed by fooliſh ſcoffers; inſomuch as often to occaſion
Mr. Monck Berkeley to ſay to his Father and friends, <q rend="inline">"Few
things delight me more than hearing my Mother trim an
Infidel. Some Deiſtical fellow begins ſpouting out his
nonſenſical blaſphemy to <hi>amuſe</hi> the company.—On he
goes, without interruption; for I make it a point never
to ſay a word, <hi>well</hi> knowing what he is going to meet
with.—At length, down goes my Mother's needle-work;
ſhe begins, and in a few words turns the laugh of all the
company upon him, and the poor wretch never opens his
mouth any more the remainder of the evening."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is a proof of the fulfilment of this promiſe of Chriſt
to his faithful ſervants<note n="*" place="bottom">The Editor, at the age of twenty-two, was aſked, by a very near relation of her own, a ſingle man, of vaſt fortune, univerſally eſteemed one of the firſt ſcholars in England, <q rend="inline">"Why ſhe was not a Papiſt, for the Papiſts required not the belief of any thing ſo contrary to reaſon as the doctrine of the Trinity, which he was perſuaded ſhe did believe."</q> It pleaſed God to enable her to make him, a firſt-rate ſcholar, ſhe an unlettered young woman, ſuch an anſwer as immediately ſilenced him, and aſtoniſhed the whole of the company that ſat at table.

As Mrs. Berkeley is not an Eliza Carter or a Mrs.
Montagu, two of her reſpected old friends, but an unlettered
female, who loſt a learned and wiſe Father when ſhe was eleven
years old, who had ſet his heart on cultivating the minds
of his daughters, had God ſpared his life until their leaving
the ſchool of that throughly amiable, accompliſhed woman,
the excellent Mrs. Sheeles; but, alas! they had been in
Queen's Square but one year, before he went to hear thoſe
bleſſed words, <q rend="inline">"Well done, thou good and faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,"</q>

pariſh prieſts any where to be found, even half a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury

St. Paul's Epiſtles to Timothy and Titus with good effect<note n="*" place="bottom">In the year 1755, the Reverend Dr. Dodwell was bleſſed with a curate, who followed the example of Mr. Frinſham, Mr. Ratcliffe, fellow of Queen's College, Oxford. Few days paſſed without his viſiting ſome houſe in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, chiefly the cottages where he examined and inſtructed the poor children, and generally ignorant mother; admoniſhing them if they neglected going to church, exhorting them to attend at the altar.

He died about two years ago, on a college living; the county wherein it was ſituated is not at preſent recollected, but <hi>he</hi> is not forgotten by his Maſter.</note>;
for he never ſuffered ſin on any of his pariſhioners, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

<hi>ſolely</hi> on account of your excellent amiable character."</q>
Perhaps one of the moſt beautiful letters <note n="*" place="bottom">It is poſſible that ſome of Lord Bute's letters to Mr. Frinſham may ſome time or other be preſented to the publick; they will ſerve to ſhew what Lord Bute <hi>then</hi> was.</note> ever penned was
by Lord Bute, on the death of, as he termed him, <q rend="inline">"<hi>that
dear delightful excellent friend.</hi>"</q> The Peer and the Paſtor
generally met on the hill, or at the vale below, every day.
Mr. Frinſham was as witty as he was good; in his youth
the idol of all his acquaintance, as what is termed the fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the company, and to his lateſt day the moſt cheerful
perſon of a large circle. He expired with a ſmile on his
benign countenance, without even drawing a ſingle ſigh, at
the age of fifty-four.</p>
               <p>It is hoped, that the following little tribute of a grateful
child to the beſt of Fathers will be pardoned. A few lines
ſhall ſuffice. Not long after his obtaining prieſt's orders he
became curate of Beaconsfield in Bucks, to a <hi>poor</hi> man of large
fortune, but ſo weak in his underſtanding, that, when Mr.
Frinſham was one Sunday confined with a raſh, Mr. N<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>attempted</hi>
to do the duty, which he <hi>could not get through,</hi> and
<pb n="clxviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:176"/>
therefore came down and went home<note n="*" place="bottom">May God have pardoned the wickedneſs of the Prelate who admitted <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>being</hi> into the Church of Chriſt, to get the emoluments of a family living. It is <hi>ſeldom</hi> ſeen, I believe, that an almoſt idiot at <hi>twenty-four</hi> becomes a man of ſenſe at thirty-four. A buck, a blood, a Newmarket jockey, made a prieſt of the Moſt High God at twenty-four, does often, by thirty-four, or forty-four, begin to feel the value of his own and the ſouls committed to his charge. But the Wiſe King aſſures us, the <q rend="inline">"braying in a mortar"</q> will not make a fool wiſe. Surely, in that inſtance, the Preſbyterians are wiſer than our excellent Church. They, I believe, ſeldom ordain any man, ſuch as their ordination is, until thirty. Our bleſſed Maſter, God incarnate, began not his own miniſtry until the age of thirty; his precurſor, John the Baptiſt, not until twenty-ſeven; yet our Church, wiſe in every thing elſe, permits poor ſhatter-brained boys, of twenty-two and an half, to go, and ſolemnly <hi>lie to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (ſee Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Office,) that they may get forty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and ſcamper after a pack of hounds.</note>. The living being
then on ſale, Mr. Frinſham much wiſhed his father to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
it for him; the old gentleman ſtood for about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty or two hundred pounds. The Principal and
Fellows of Magdalene College, Oxford, hearing of it, inſtantly
paid down the ſum demanded; and, of courſe, for ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
Mr. Frinſham from becoming rector, where he was
only, not adored as curate; ſo powerfully had his perſuaſions
wrought on the people of that place, that the wheeler, the
blackſmith, the millener, yea, every trader, quitted their
occupation, to attend Wedneſday, Friday, and Saints'-day
prayers, ſo much as frequently to occaſion paſſengers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
if there was any great wedding, that ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

Mr. Frinſham being what was called a Tory, and all his
own and his lady's conſiderable relations, who could prefer
him, being Whigs; he never obtained any more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
preferment than the vicarage of White Waltham, a
pariſh of ſixteen miles round, in Windſor Foreſt, of which
his very learned and worthy ſucceſſor, the Reverend Dr.
Dodwell, Canon of Saliſbury, and Archdeacon of Berks,
ſaid he never made fifty pounds a year. Thus are many
excellent miniſters of Chriſt provided for in <hi>this</hi> world,
enough to make them take up the language of the great
apoſtle St. Paul, and ſay, <q rend="inline">"If in <hi>this life only</hi> we have hope

Mr. Frinſham, perhaps naturally the moſt contented-tempered
of the fallen children of Adam, and the moſt
hoſpitable, although he wiſhed not for a larger income,
wiſhed for a larger, better houſe, in which to entertain his
numerous friends and acquaintance. Rich and poor, high
and low, all ate and drank at his houſe. The vicarage
houſe at White Waltham was literally a very large old
barn, with ſmall rooms on each ſide. The kitchen, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
was not very ſmall, and was payed with curious Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
bricks, which might have conſoled his grandſon, Mr.

uſed to ſay, it merited to be written in letters of gold. Such
were the WHIG miniſters of George the Second.</p>
               <p>It is ſomewhat remarkable, that Mr. Frinſham never met
with any ſerious affliction through life. The loſs of his
beautiful mother, when he was five years old, was ſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by an excellent houſekeeper of his father's, that he
ſcarcely felt it; and the death of his worthy father, at
the age of eighty-one, not long before his own death, was
an event to be expected at that age, although he died, as
before mentioned, by caſualty. Mr. Frinſham was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
cloſe to his honoured father-in-law, Francis Cherry,
Eſquire, within the railed burial place in Shotteſbrooke
church-yard. He uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"I am God's creature;
he ſent me into the world <hi>when</hi> he pleaſed, and he
will take me out <hi>how</hi> he pleaſes: and I am ſure
it will be at the <hi>beſt</hi> time, in the <hi>beſt</hi> way."</q> He dreaded
nothing in life ſo much as loſing the beſt of wives, and
the being left with two little girls, whom he humoured in
<hi>every thing</hi> not in itſelf wrong.</p>
               <p>Some proofs how much Mr. Berkeley was indebted to
education may be gathered from his amiable humility as a
lad, a youth, and a man, when it is conſidered that he was
aſtoniſhingly proud whilſt a child.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="clxxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:180"/>
When Mr. Monck Berkeley was aged three years and
two months, his father went to reſide at Acton near Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
a large living, preſented to him by his ONLY patron
through life, the excellent Archbiſhop Secker, and which
he ſo nobly reſigned, to a man, who, after making him
repair the tithe barn, and letting him have about five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds' worth of new furniture and fixtures for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and eighty pounds—(amongſt which was a harpſichord,
that coſt Biſhop Berkeley ſeventy guineas, for <hi>four pounds</hi>—Mrs.
Berkeley objected; but the Doctor, with his wonted
generoſity, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"he hated diſputes among clergy;"</q> and
therefore permitted him to have it at his own price)—after
ſuffering the houſe to ſtand empty from Michaelmas to the
end of April—came upon him with a long bill for dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidations,
and proteſted a draught drawn on him by Dr.
Berkeley for the money for the furniture. This naturally
exaſperated the too generous mind that had been the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
preſenter of the living; for no power on earth, no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
could have compelled any one to reſign it. But Dr.
Berkeley one day aſking the Archbiſhop if his Grace meant
he ſhould reſign Action on becoming Prebendary of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
his reply was, <q rend="inline">"Don't be in haſte. You muſt talk
one day or other with Lord Hardwicke about it."</q> Before
any conference with Lord Hardwicke, the good Archbiſhop
died; and the nice honour of Dr. Berkeley, without ever
even ſeeing Lord Hardwick, made him reſign it to a couſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>german
of his Lordſhip—a very different man from his
<pb n="clxxiii" facs="tcp:0761700600:181"/>
noble relation. A very intimate friend of Dr. Berkeley's,
the excellent <hi>throughly</hi> Honourable and Reverend Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton
of Taplow, felt ſuch reſentment, that he conjured
Dr. Berkeley to poſt the <hi>man</hi> every where. Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton
had one excellent rule; he never would call any
man a gentleman, if in any inſtance he had acted unlike a
gentleman.</p>
               <p>In a very few days after the arrival of the family at Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Mrs. Berkeley heard a moſt violent ſtamping and
ſcreaming of her then only child. On enquiry into the
cauſe, it was found to be, that Maſter Berkeley would not
go to bed up the back ſtairs.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Berkeley.—<q rend="inline">"What ails him?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Servant.—<q rend="inline">"Why, you know, Madam, there is only one
ſtair-caſe at Bray. But Maſter Berkeley ſays there are
two here; and he obſerves, that my Maſter, and you,
and all viſitors, go up the great ſtair-caſe, and <hi>only</hi> the
ſervants up the back ſtairs; and that he is as good a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
as his Papa, although he is not ſo old; and that
he will not go up the back ſtairs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>An order was immediately made, and ſtrictly adhered to,
that he was not, for a <hi>whole</hi> week, (a long time for a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of three feet high,) to preſume, in the day time, to
go up or down the great ſtair-caſe to the dreſſing-room, to
his Mamma, to read or play.</p>

                  <pb n="clxxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:182"/>
When about four years old, Mr. Berkeley received a ſmart
trimming, for a ſpeech to a once famous apothecary in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
who had retired to Acton, Mr. Sawtell, whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
was rather againſt him. He attended Dr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
when unwell, and Charles Stanley Monck, of Grange
Gormonde, Eſquire, ill about four months at Dr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's
with the whooping cough, which he brought from
Eton School, and communicated to <note n="*" place="bottom">The word <hi>poor</hi> is introduced on account of his very ſevere ſufferings for more than ſeven months. Dr. Berkeley, having never been at any ſchool, had, unluckily, eſcaped all thoſe diſorders which children, together with many other benefits, generally get at good ſchools. The whooping-cough is a tremendous diſorder, indeed, to adults—Dr. Berkeley could not exiſt without going into freſh air every three or four days. It coſt him more than an hundred guineas. The agonies ſuffered by the Editor during ſome parts of that time were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly great. Laughing conſtantly brought on a violent fit of coughing. Innumerable were the times that the Editor has ſat trembling with anguiſh, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that her beloved partner would expire hanging on the window; his only hope of relief being to throw up the ſaſh, and hang out at it, gaſping for breath. Mr. James Hamilton, and the as <hi>witty Samuel Horne,</hi> ſpent the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with him. Mrs. Berkeley uſed to proteſt, ſhe would <hi>turn them both out of doors,</hi> if they would not bottle up their wit, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"ſhe would ſend for two mutes."</q> She uſed ſeriouſly to conjure them not to make Dr. Berkeley laugh. None can laugh at this account, who has ever had the diſtreſs of ſeeing an adult under the paroxyſms of the whooping cough. An old friend of Mrs. Berkeley's, more advanced in life than Dr. Berkeley, often fell ſenſeleſs on the floor, the late Rev. Mr. Chapman, the beloved friend of the late Dr. Booth, Dean of Windſor.</note>poor Dr. Berkeley and
his little boy. This proud deſcendant of fallen Adam thus
accoſted him, <q rend="inline">"Sir, if you were ever to ſtay here to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
you muſt dine in the ſervants' hall, for you cannot
<pb n="clxxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:183"/>
be fit company for my Papa."</q> Dr. Berkeley, ready to
ſink with ſhame, flew to Mrs. Berkeley, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Surely,
that chit is the proudeſt little being on earth. I muſt now
really aſk the poor man one day to dinner, to ſhew
that he has not heard any thing of the kind from you
or me."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley was always told, that a gentleman muſt
never do mean or ſhabby actions. He <hi>reaſoned</hi> on the
matter, and, in early infancy, drew ſuch <hi>wonderful</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
as thoſe juſt mentioned.</p>
               <p>That both Mr. Berkeley and his Brother were, in <hi>very
very</hi> early youth exceedingly proud is abſolutely certain, in
their different ways; and that both became remarkably
humble, by their Mother's adhering cloſely to the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
given to parents in that wonderful book the Proverbs
of Solomon, is equally certain.</p>
               <p>The exquiſite lovelineſs of Mr. Monck Berkeley's nature
led him, from an infant, to look with pity on all below
him; but his dear Brother naturally looked with contempt.
One day, when very young, going in the coach with their
Mother to Marlow, as they paſſed a remarkably ſmall, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking
cottage at the foot of the hill, he exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"My
dear Mamma, look there: did you ever ſee ſo miſerable
a looking hut? What kind of <hi>creatures</hi> muſt they be that
<pb n="clxxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:184"/>
live in it?"</q> Mrs. Berkeley threw terror into her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"ROBERT! what have I juſt heard you
ſay? Do you dare to deſpiſe any of your fellow creatures,
or any mean-looking habitation? Have not you often
redde in the Bible what our bleſſed Saviour ſaid, 'The
foxes—(Now go on; he did ſo)—have holes, and the
birds of the air have neſts; but the Son of Man has not
where to lay his head."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Why did he come upon
earth?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"To ſave ſinners."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Yes, ſuch a poor, proud,
little wretch as you. And are you not very naughty to
ſay what you have juſt ſaid?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Yes, indeed, Mamma;
and if God will forgive me <hi>this once,</hi> I will never do ſo
again whilſt I live."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Once paſſing a little chimney-ſweeper, about his own
ſize, with the ſoot-bag at his back, he coiled up his noſe,
and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"What a poor dirty little creature it is!"</q> His
Mother acted terror as before, and aſked him, <q rend="inline">"How he
came to be ſo wicked? and if he knew how it came to
paſs, that HE was not that poor little ſweep, and little
ſweep Maſter Robert Berkeley."</q> He replied, <q rend="inline">"No."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Should you have liked it?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"No."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Do you think
if God Almighty had aſked that little boy, whether he
would be Dr. Berkeley's ſon, or the ſweep's, that he
would not have choſen to have been born a gentleman?
that Chriſt died to redeem from hell that little boy as
well as himſelf, or one of the King's little ſons? that, as
<pb n="clxxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:185"/>
he had not even the merit of chooſing to come to Dr.
Berkeley's inſtead of to old La-Looe, (the nick name of
a chimney ſweeper, who ought now to enjoy a very good
fortune in Bucks, if he had money to contend for it,) he
ought to to be humble as a little dove, inſtead of being
proud as Lucifer, and deſpiſing thoſe whom Providence,
without <hi>any</hi> goodneſs of his, had placed below him."</q>
He wept, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It was very wicked indeed; but, if
God would pardon it, he would never deſpiſe dirty chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
again."</q> The worthy woman who brought him up,
was remarkably cleanly, and had made him ſo. He was
exceedingly careful to keep his word; for if he were told
of any thing that would offend God, no perſuaſion of the
moſt eloquent could cauſe him to do it. Such admono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
until he grew towards manhood, were heard by his
lovely brother, as they are by moſt other children, to uſe
a cant phraſe, <q rend="inline">"go in at one ear, and out at the other."</q>

Mr. Berkeley and his brother were, whilſt children, always
made, not to touch, but take off their hats to the pooreſt
labourer in the village who ſaluted them; if ever they
ſaw an old man or woman with a burden of wood, or leazed
corn, to run to open the gate to let them through. They
were made to treat the ſervants with the utmoſt civility,
never daring to <hi>order</hi> them to do any thing, being always
told, that they were not their ſervants, but their Father's:
therefore they muſt always ſay, <q rend="inline">"Pray, John (or Thomas),
get me ſo or ſo."</q> By inceſſant attention, and the utmoſt
vigilance, their pride was kept under, and, in due time,
by God's grace, eradicated.</p>
               <p>It was no ſmall delight to his Mother, on his arrival in
England, at the age of near twenty-two, that ſhe could
ſcarcely go into any ſmall ſhop in Canterbury without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
from the maſter or miſtreſs, <q rend="inline">"Oh! Madam, what a
fine young gentleman Mr. Berkeley is; ſo condeſcending!
he met my poor ſon, ſtopped, and aſked him, how he
did? and hoped he went on well in the world. Who
would have thought he would have done him the honour
to remember him ſo many years?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let it be remarked here, that Eccleſiaſtical Bodies do
<hi>ſome</hi> good. At Canterbury, the Dean and Prebendaries pay
for the education of fifty tradeſmen's ſons, find them books,
&amp;c. until they are eighteen or nineteen; and then, if they
<pb n="clxxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:189"/>
wiſh it, raiſe a ſubſcription to ſend them to one of the
Univerſities. Many other cathedrals have ſimilar charitable
inſtitutions. This produces a ſort of honourable equality,
as it enables the ſons of chairmen, footmen, &amp;c. when
ordained, to aſſociate with their ſuperiors in birth, perhaps
not in learning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley's amiability was the more remarked, as he
quitted the King's School at the age of twelve, and his
Father removed his family to his living in Weſt Kent the
year following, and returned not to ſettle in Canterbury
until the end of the year 1784; when it became his turn
to take the offices. A good old ſhopman one day ſaid to
Mrs. Berkeley, <q rend="inline">"Ah! Madam, what a charming man Mr.
Berkeley is. He was <hi>galloping</hi> towards Margate, looking
like a <hi>young Lord,</hi> when one of our poor old neighbours
was creeping along. He ſuddenly ſtopped his horſe,
drew up to the cauſeway, and aſked him who he was,
and if he was comfortable? He took out his purſe, and,
not finding much ſilver, bade his ſervant lend him half
a crown; which he gave to the poor man, and told him
to call upon him if ever he wanted any thing:"</q> adding,
his eyes filling with tears, <q rend="inline">"Lord bleſs him! where will
you find another young gentleman, going galloping on his
pleaſure, that will think ſo of the poor?"</q> It proved to
be the famous old News-carrier, of whom the fine print
was ſold ſome years ago in Canterbury.</p>

The poor and diſtreſſed were ever the grand objects of
his tender care. When at St. Andrew's, one night, at the
play, the poor man who acted the king in the tragedy
fainted away; and it had nearly been a <hi>real</hi> tragedy, as he
had ſeveral ſmall children. On enquiry, it was found
to be from inanition<note n="*" place="bottom">The next day the Editor ſent her faithful, affectionate, truſty, aged, Scotch ſervant, the excellent Betty Ruſſel, to enquire particularly into the ſtate of theſe heroes and heroines of the ſtage. The worthy woman ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Well-a-day, Madam, I never ſaw ſuch an <hi>unka</hi> ſight in all my life; there was the poor <hi>crator,</hi> who is to be queen to night, the king's wife that fainted laſt night, with her head dreſſed all in flowers and ribbons, and a fine crown, and a child ſucking at her breaſt quite empty, it had not a drop of milk in it—ſhe had had nothing but water all day—oh! it was an <hi>unka</hi> ſight to ſee her head ſo fine, her breaſt hanging like a wet leather glove."</q> That uncommonly honeſt, worthy woman, Elizabeth Ruſſel, met with moſt kind, charitable friends, on Dr. Berkeley's family leaving St. Andrew's, in the amiable, excellent, and by them highly reſpected, Dr. Adamſon, ſenior Kirk Miniſter of St. Andrew's, and his worthy very charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lady. The Editor uſed to delight to ſend her a guinea, in a letter to Dr. Adamſon, until twice <hi>ſome</hi> poſt-maſter ſtopped it.</note>. Mr. Berkeley, on finding that to
be the caſe, poſted off to his tutor, the very amiable (now
Reverend) Mr. James Bruce, beſeeching him to go and
relieve him on his account. On Mrs. Berkeley's ſaying,
<q rend="inline">"Why did not you go yourſelf, inſtead of routing out Mr.
Bruce?"</q> He wiſely replied, <q rend="inline">"My dear Mother, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was exceedingly beautiful; and my going might have
injured her fame, which, I hear, although an actreſs,
is unſullied. So now you know why I got Bruce to go."</q>

                  <pb n="clxxix" facs="tcp:0761700600:191"/>
Mr. Berkeley had certainly no offenſive pride diſcovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to thoſe who knew him moſt intimately; for, what is
uſually termed Family Pride is ſurely improperly ſo called.
A man, that is deſcended from a King rather than from a
cobler, from a Hero rather than from a Huckſter, may feel
grateful to his Maker. Mr. Berkeley's Father felt it, his
Grandfather felt it, and perhaps he felt it on becoming a
Biſhop. Some friend ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Your Lordſhip muſt now give
purple liveries."</q> To which the good Biſhop replied,
<q rend="inline">"No, Sir. My becoming a Biſhop will not make me give
up what the domeſtics of my anceſtors have worn for
centuries."</q> Accordingly his epiſcopal livery was the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
green coat worne by the ſervants of his honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
the Earl of Berkeley, Lord Berkeley of Stratton,
his Brothers, &amp;c. with royal, <hi>i.e.</hi> red purple waiſtcoats,
&amp;c. and the ſervants of his Sons he always made wear the
crimſon waiſtcoat, &amp;c. that he might not give up his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
livery. Dr. Berkeley's coach being to be new painted,
the coach-maker ſaid, <q rend="inline">"To be ſure, Sir, you will have a
cypher inſtead of your coat of arms. It is all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion."</q>
                  <q rend="inline">"That may be, Sir; but, if you pleaſe, put
on my coat. It is an <hi>old one,</hi> to be ſure. The cypher is
very well for Nabobs and Planters, to ſave them trouble."</q>
It was a great diverſion, when Mr. Berkeley was ſeventeen or
eighteen, to a lovely young lady, whoſe death Mr. Berkeley
lamented in a moſt beautiful elegy, printed, but never ſold,
to wink on Mrs. Berkeley, and ſay, <q rend="inline">"Aye, one day or other
<pb n="clxxx" facs="tcp:0761700600:192"/>
Berkeley will marry a girl with an hundred thouſand
pounds, and change his name to Hickenbottom."</q> (Vide
Kit Smart.) He uſed to ſtorm, and ſay, <q rend="inline">"Harriet, hold
your tongue: I will not change my name for a million."</q>
Mr. Addiſon ſays, <q rend="inline">"Ancient family is a feather, but it is a
<hi>feather</hi> that no man poſſeſſed of ever diſdained to ſtick in
his cap."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When the vile treatiſe on Education, written by that
learned Atheiſt, the late Lord Kaimes, made its appearance,
it was immediately in every hand. When Mr. Berkeley
came to the part where Lord Kaimes ſpeaks of the Eton
<hi>Montem,</hi> he ſtormed violently indeed; he felt <hi>l'eſprit du corps</hi>
ſo violently as to amuſe all his friends. He aſſured his
Father and the gentlemen of the agreeable ſociety of Cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
above deſcribed, that, had they been educated at Eton,
they would feel equal indignation. His mother aſſured him,
that men of forty-ſeven were rarely as irritable as youths of
ſeventeen; to which Mr. Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"Well, Madam,
I can tell you at what page of the book you will throw it
by, and not read one line more."</q> She, laughing, aſked,
<q rend="inline">"If Lord Kaimes had abuſed dear Mrs. Sheeles's ſchool?"</q>
He replied, <q rend="inline">"Much worſe than that: I aſſure you, my dear
Madam, with <hi>all your calmneſs,</hi> you will be ready to throw
it into the fire."</q> Mrs. Berkeley requeſted to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
but her Son politely declined it, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"No;
read on, my dear Madam."</q> It is certain, that when ſhe
<pb n="clxxxi" facs="tcp:0761700600:193"/>
came to the page where Lord Kaimes ſays, <q rend="inline">"I would
adviſe you to be of the Chriſtian religion, becauſe it
is (or it happens to be) the religion of the country
where you were born,"</q> Mrs. Berkeley verified her Son's
prediction, for ſhe never thought it worth while to go on
with ſuch a wretch on Education. His Lordſhip's Treatiſe
on Huſbandry is an excellent work.</p>
               <p>The following anecdote of that dreadful Atheiſt may be
depended on as a fact. It was related to the Editor by a
lady incapable of forging it, to whom it was related by an
eye and ear witneſs of the ſcene. When a divorce has
actually taken place, it is no ſcandal to ſpeak of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced
female as having loſt her character. Lord Kaimes's
daughter was married to Mr. Heron, a gentleman of
very large fortune in Scotland, of moſt excellent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
and uncommonly amiable gentle manners, ſay all
who have the happineſs of his acquaintance. The Editor
was well acquainted with the elegant worthy Major Heron,
his younger brother, when that favourite regiment, of
Canterbury families of faſhion, the Scotch Greys, were
quartered at Canterbury. This lady was at length detected,
and gently and quietly ſent home to her WORTHY father,
with a letter from her excellent injured huſband, ſtating her
conduct. She reached her father's houſe in the afternoon.
In the evening, after tea, Lord Kaimes walked up and
down the room in ſilence, but appeared greatly agitated.
<pb n="clxxxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:194"/>
At length he exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Good God, child! how could
you act thus? How could you bring me to ſuch ſhameful
diſgrace?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Why, my Lord, you have always told me,
that there was no other world; that the idea of an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
was all a JUGGLE of knaves and prieſts to keep fools
in order; and, as I am not to be called to any account,
but by the world—I preferred Mr. <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> to my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band."</q>
This ſilenced his Lordſhip: he ſaid not a ſingle
word more, and ſoon quitted the room. Mr. Heron, her
much injured huſband, has, for many years, enjoyed great
felicity with a lady very differently educated from the
daughter of Lord Kaimes. May he long enjoy it!</p>
               <p>In a few days after reading the book above mentioned,
when the ſocial meeting happened to be at Dr. Berkeley's,
juſt before tea, the very learned Mr. M<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap> either took
off the ſlab behind him, or out of his pocket a newſpaper
(neither that amiable gentleman nor the Editor can recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
which; if it was Dr. Berkeley's paper, it was the St.
James's Chronicle, as he was always partial to that paper,
on account of his old fellow collegian, Mr. Colman), and
began reading a letter to Lord Kaimes, concerning his very
ſevere attack on Eton School, proving to the learned Lord,
that he was totally ignorant of what he had been ſo groſly
abuſing. Every one admired it exceedingly. Mr. M<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> ſaid,

ſurely. Eton is nobly vindicated indeed. The

<q rend="inline">"To be ſure, every man educated there muſt be indignant
to find himſelf and his friends ſtyled <hi>Highwaymen!</hi>"</q> Mr.
M<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap> proceeded to read on, and ſaid, turning to Mrs.
Berkeley, <q rend="inline">"Why, I believe, Berkeley muſt have written
this letter himſelf."</q> To which Mrs. Berkeley replied,
<q rend="inline">"HE write ſuch a letter, poor dear ſoul! poor as I am, I
would give a thouſand pounds that he could, three years
hence, write ſuch a letter as that."</q> To which Dr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
added, <q rend="inline">"Aye, poor fellow, I hope, if he is not idle,
he may, <hi>in time,</hi> write as well as this Eton champion."</q>
               </p>
               <p>About ſeven years afterwards Mr. Berkeley, ſitting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
with his Mother in her dreſſing-room, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"My

               <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"Well, my dear Madam, perhaps it may now
give you ſome little pleaſure to hear that your <hi>Bairn</hi> did
write that letter, and that Lord Kaimes anſwered it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
that he had been in an error concerning the
Eton <hi>Montem;</hi> adding, that he muſt have been an haſty
writer to publiſh ſuch a cenſure on an ancient cuſtom

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley, from the time he went to Eton, uſed very
acutely to learn his Mother's opinion of any little thing he
was going to publiſh in a Newſpaper or Magazine, without
her even ſuſpecting him as the author, by ſaying, <q rend="inline">"It was
written by an Eton boy of his acquaintance;"</q> leſt, as he
told her when he grew up, maternal partiality might tempt
her to think it clever when it was not ſo; or the ſame ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
might tempt her to wiſh it ſuppreſſed, leſt it ſhould
expoſe him to ridicule.</p>
               <p>On Mr. Berkeley's <hi>printing</hi> his "Maria, or The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Ruſtic," written when he was only ſeventeen, the
copies were ſent down to him. One day after dinner, he
went to his ſtudy, and brought a copy of it in ſheets, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<q rend="inline">"He would read ſomething that he hoped might
amuſe his Father and the ladies."</q> He began; and Dr.
Berkeley, who had eyes like a lynx, ſeeing it in ſheets, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Good Heavens, child! what have
you done? This is written by you. Surely, you have
not gone and publiſhed ſome nonſenſe that will ruin your

                  <pb n="clxxxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:198"/>
Mrs. Berkeley, <hi>mother-like,</hi> in agony to think that her
idol had injured his fame as a writer, began lamenting his
temerity. When the indignation of Dr. Berkeley and the
lamentations of Mrs. Berkeley were a <hi>little</hi> ſubſided, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

               <p>Matters being a little quieted by Mrs. Frinſham's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
Mr. Berkeley ſaid to his Father, <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

on Engliſh manners, cuſtoms, &amp;c. I have deſtroyed.
Indeed I have burnt near five times as much as I have
printed; and, if you wiſh it, I will burn that."</q> Here
there was a triple cry of, <q rend="inline">"Oh! no."</q> But Dr. Berkeley
aſked, <q rend="inline">"My poor ſimple child, why would you not let me
look it over and correct it?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Alas, my dear Sir, I
knew what would be its fate. You would have made a
new book."</q> A very juſt remark. Dr. Berkeley never
could correct. He could write admirably, as the world
has ſeen; but any thing ſent him to correct he always
re-made, generally perhaps for the better—but then, as his
Son, through life, uſed to tell him, <q rend="inline">"Sir, the book is
yours, not the man's whoſe name it bears."</q>—<q rend="inline">"But, if
you KNEW that, why not let your Mother read and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
it?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Why, my dear Sir, for fear of getting my
Mother into a ſcrape, for not ſhewing it to you."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Uncorrected as it was, it has been ſo admired, that, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years ago, half a guinea was paid for a miſerable,
thumbed, dirty copy, only to be found in thoſe banes of

ſecond edition; but his conſtant reply was, <q rend="inline">"<hi>No; never

let there be one; but I was young, and, of courſe,
fooliſh."</q>
               </p>
               <p>That there are great beauties in Maria is generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed;

The calling the idea of a Marquis, even a French Marquis,

highly objectionable, <q rend="inline">"<hi>one of the abſurd maxims of the world,</hi>"</q> is
what, at twenty, or before, Mr. Berkeley would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged.
And on his Mother's pointing out to him how

daughter of a reduced officer, he ſaw the force of it;
but replied, <q rend="inline">"<hi>You</hi> know, my dear Madam, that by means

               <p>After Mr. Berkeley's return to England, he came one
day to his Mother, and, enquiring if ſhe had a couple of

"The Spaniſh Memoirs," telling her, as they appeared on
the ſtage, who the chief actors were; for Mr. Berkeley, in
every novel or poem, celebrated or ſtigmatized ſome real

bears the title of Weſtmorland; Mr. Berkeley having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
reſpected the character of the preſent Earl of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morland,
for his ſpirited wiſe conduct in quitting a great

where he could, and did, learn very much, and for other

It might contribute greatly in preventing huſbands being
obliged to exhibit many unhappy creatures at Doctors

               <p>Solomon, when he ſays, <q rend="inline">"Train up a child in the way

but having, as we well know, received an excellent
education from his pious preceptor, Nathan the prophet,
he returned into the paths of virtue and piety before his
death. The late Archdeacon of Berkſhire, the very learned
Dr. Dodwell, in an excellent ſermon on <q rend="inline">"One man in a

that great King owed the ſalvation of his ſoul to the

about twenty-five years ago, with a large party at Canterbury,
to hear ſome dull abuſe from that accompliſhed old hypocrite,
John Weſley) adviſing a young gentleman to read a ſmall

               <p>To attempt to do juſtice to Mr. Monck Berkeley's grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to many noble relations, friends, and connexions,
from his firſt entrance into what is called <hi>life,</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
abilities far ſuperior to thoſe of an almoſt dying fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
by whom he had been taught from infancy, that he
had no <hi>right</hi> to expect any thing but what is uſual, the
common decent civilities of life, from any but his Parents;
that every thing beyond that was to be repaid by gratitude,
as more than his due.</p>
               <p>His gratitude to the eminently learned Profeſſor Hunter
of St. Andrew's, in offering Dr. Berkeley to become him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Mr. Berkeley's tutor, if Dr. Berkeley did not entirely
approve of Mr. Bruce, an <hi>eleve</hi> of Mr. Hunter, was through
life gratefully remembered by him; but Dr. Berkeley found
the Profeſſor's character of Mr. Bruce to be perfectly juſt.
Dr. Berkeley accordingly aſked Mr. Bruce the value of his
<hi>whole</hi> time, deſired him to diſmiſs all his other pupils, and
devote himſelf entirely to the care of Mr. Berkeley; which
he did for a conſiderable time, until the arrival of his dear
friend Mr. Grimſton, who came on Mr. Berkeley's account,
and entered at St. Andrew's, and an old intimate Eton friend
of Mr. Berkeley's in the ſame form with him there. Being
all, as it is termed, reading the ſame books, they could
<pb n="cxcviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:210"/>
not interfere; and Mr. Berkeley, amiably wiſhing to benefit
Mr. Bruce, whom he exceedingly loved, requeſted his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to permit him to become tutor to thoſe two gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
only, from both of whom he received a large ſalary,
which enabled him, a few years after, to enter at Emanuel
College, Cambridge, under the protection of Dr. Berkeley's
much loved and reſpected friend, the celebrated and worthy
Dr. Farmer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley's gratitude through life to thoſe who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
him was uniform. He uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"If <hi>I would
not</hi> learn, <hi>that</hi> was not <hi>their</hi> fault."</q> He uſed always to
boaſt to his Father, <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, <hi>idle</hi> as <hi>you</hi> may think me,
I can aſſert, with ſtricteſt truth, that I never have once
bowed at Profeſſor Hill's, Hunter's, or indeed at any
Profeſſor's lectures."</q> An explanation being requeſted of
the word <hi>bowing,</hi> it was thus given: <q rend="inline">"Why, if any poor
fellow has been a little idle, and is not prepared to ſpeak
when called upon by the Profeſſor, he gets up and makes
a reſpectful bow, and ſits down again."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley's friendſhip for his very learned tutor, the
Reverend Mr. Green, on whoſe ſole account he was by his
Father ſent to Magdalene Hall, rather than to his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Chriſt Church, was very great. Mr. Berkeley conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
him as the moſt active and vigilant of tutors, who
would <hi>force</hi> young men to learn, whether ſo diſpoſed or
<pb n="cxcix" facs="tcp:0761700600:211"/>
not, and the great care he took of their morals, devoting
almoſt the whole of his leiſure time to the common room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley was bleſt with a wonderful ſagacity in
diſcerning characters, and often exhibiting them to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of his friends, even when the perſons whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
he drew were preſent. He uſed frequently to ſay
to his Father and Aunt, <q rend="inline">"Now I will treat you with an

the Almighty never formed any thing before her, or ever

then ſhe reluctantly ſets off."</q> This latter
part aroſe from Mrs. Berkeley's reſolution, through life,
never to viſit any cook, houſe-maid, &amp;c. who had been

acquaintance, the wives of gentlemen, they gentlewomen,
mothers of large families of young children, is well known
to many who will read theſe ſheets through curioſity. But
the caſe is widely different. Mary or Nan, if tolerably
cunning wenches, reaſon thus: <q rend="inline">"It is hit or miſs. If I

Agreed: but you ought not to be company for ladies of

One indeed ſent to know what ſhe had done,
that Mrs. Berkeley would not viſit her; and Mrs. Berkeley
bade the lady tell her. Whether the lady did tell her or
not muſt be gueſſed. The wife of a gentleman may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
very fooliſhly, very idly; and it may, it muſt, be
very difficult to aſcertain whether her conduct is criminal
or not; and if her huſband (not a known ſcoundrel) does
not give her up, her friends and neighbours ought not to
do it. But with Mary and Nan and the 'Squire, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

               <p>In a country where the QUESTION, as the torture uſed

however it might excite the admiration of her clever Son,
and ſenſible excellent friend, Mrs. Duncombe, the cultivated,

herſelf deeply indebted for a thouſand amiable attentions,

the improvement, of thoſe who read what is worth reading.
Her letters, carefully preſerved, if printed, would give the
Engliſh a <hi>Madame Sevignée</hi> of their own nation. It is to be
hoped, that ſome time or other they may be collected and
given to the world<note n="*" place="bottom">It is certain that they would <hi>not</hi> coſt the pains that thoſe of the lovely, lively, and, in her latter days, excellently pious, Madame de Sevignée's did; for one has frequently heard, that it took many months to a <hi>patient</hi> genius, to correct the falſe orthography of thoſe very entertaining, improving letters. Madame de Sevignée had never ſtudied "The complete Letter Writer," pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſome years ago. Of the minor viſitations there are few things more dreaded by Mrs. Duncombe and the Editor, than an epiſtle from any lady who has.

               <p>Few men, perhaps, have ever been formed with more
qualifications to make a complete orator than Mr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley;
a very uncommonly harmonious muſical voice, with,
from an infant, the ſweeteſt tones imaginable, which he
could at pleaſure elevate, like his grandfather, Biſhop
Berkeley, to <hi>tremendous</hi> thunder; taught, from four years old,
to repeat by heart, without rant or forced action, being
told, after he properly underſtood the meaning of what he
had learned, to repeat it as he felt it on his own mind;
and being, from ſeven years old, accuſtomed to talk with
delight of ſpeaking in Weſtminſter Hall; he took every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of improving himſelf.</p>
               <p>When a boy at Canterbury School, which, as has been
already obſerved, he quitted at twelve years old, during
<pb n="ccvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:219"/>
the ſeſſions for the city at the Guild-Hall, and for the
county at the old Caſtle, Mr. Berkeley generally went
without his dinner, flying off the inſtant the ſchool broke
up to the court, to hear the pleadings. He once prevailed
on his Father to permit him to go, attended by Mr.
Wrightſon, under a ſtrict promiſe <q rend="inline">"<hi>of doing every thing that
John bade him,</hi>"</q> to Maidſtone, to attend at the aſſizes.
On his return home, he related all the cauſes and pleadings,
and a particular in the ſumming up the evidence by Sir
William Blackſtone, as accurately as if he had taken it all
down in ſhort-hand, which he could not then do. He
was, if the French expreſſion <hi>fort éveillié</hi> may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to be tranſlated into Engliſh, the moſt <hi>awaked</hi> of all
creatures. <hi>Nothing</hi> eſcaped him; he caught every thing he
ſaw, and wiſhed to know, in a moment. One inſtance
proves it very ſtrongly. Soon after he went to Eton he
had a <hi>raging</hi> deſire to learn to fence, which his Father was
<hi>reſolved</hi> he ſhould <hi>not</hi> do, until he attained to a certain age,
fixed by him. All Mr. Berkeley's arguments that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
had let his Father learn at fourteen were ineffectual;
Dr. Berkeley ſaying, that many youths of faſhion were
often killed by its ſtraining their lungs when they were too
tender to bear it. Mr. Berkeley was, however, reſolved
to learn what he could, as he afterwards told his Father,
ſaying, <q rend="inline">"I had little trouble when <hi>I did</hi> learn; for I uſed,
inſtead of going to cricket, &amp;c. to go regularly at the
hours of learning, and fix myſelf like a ſtatue at the
<pb n="ccviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:220"/>
window."</q> Whilſt the very worthy, reſpectable, univerſally
reſpected Mr. Angelo was inſtructing his pupils, he uſed to
ſay, <q rend="inline">"I think I hardly came <hi>honeſtly</hi> by my ſkill in fencing.
But Angelo is as worthy, amiable a man as ever lived;
and, I dare ſay, did not grudge me what I ſo gleaned
from his great ſkill."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When Mr. Berkeley ſpoke his Prize Exerciſe in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Hall at St. Andrews, before the then Chancellor
of that Univerſity, the late Earl of Kinnoul; when all
the prize exerciſes had been delivered, Lord Kinnoul went
to Mr. Berkeley, and, embracing him, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I rejoice,
Sir, to embrace the grandſon of my dear old friend, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
Berkeley, and to be able to ſay, that <hi>I</hi> never heard
ſpeech <hi>ſo</hi> ſpoken from this pulpit ſince I have had the
honour to be Chancellor here."</q> Mr. Berkeley had redde
his prize exerciſe near fifty times over to his Mother. Juſt
before he went out, he conjured her to hear him once
more, that he might lay his emphaſis exactly right. The
requeſt was complied with.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley, together with his amiable, beloved friend,
the late, learned Sir John Ramſey, and his dear friend,
Mr. Lennard, frequently ſpent part of their vacation very
pleaſantly at Lord Kinnoul's ſeat. A droll anecdote or two
might be here related, particularly a ſcene in the Library;
but this Preface is already too long, and the reader has,
<pb n="ccix" facs="tcp:0761700600:221"/>
perhaps, frequently exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"What is all this chit-chat
to <hi>me?</hi> I wiſh to read the great actions of great men."</q>
If ſo, according to the advice of the <hi>great</hi> Johnſon, and the
<hi>little</hi> Editor, read Sir Francis Knollys's Hiſtory of the Turks,
Marcus Antoninus, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But to return from this digreſſion. It is impoſſible to
omit an amiable attention of a young Scotch gentleman,
who, with his wonderfully ſenſible younger brother Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,
conſtantly attended the ſervice of the Church of
England at Dr. Berkeley's, and who were frequently invited
to viſit there. The young Laird of Logie-Almon came
running into Mrs. Berkeley's dreſſing-room quite breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs;
he threw himſelf into a chair, and on Mrs. Berkeley's
enquiring if he was ill, and aſking whether he would have
any thing, he replied, <q rend="inline">"No, my dear Madam; no. But
I flew hither to tell you how delightfully Mr. Berkeley
has ſpoken; and in what <hi>extacies</hi> Lord Kinnoul (one of
the many guardians of this very pleaſing, amiable, young
gentleman) ſaid to me, I thought it <hi>muſt</hi> delight you;

he <hi>began</hi> to ſpeak, that I expected every moment, the
Chancellor would ſay, <hi>Pray, Sir, begin;</hi> and that would
have made him ten times worſe. But when he had once
begun, he got courage, and went on nobly; and every
body is aſtoniſhed."</q> This young gentleman was at that
time barely fifteen years old. May he, as a man, through
life, be what he was in youth!</p>
               <p>A very extraordinary circumſtance happened at the birth
of this young gentleman. A very aged domeſtic of the
Drummond family, many years more than an hundred,
who lived in a little cot (by the bounty of the excellent
Laird) on Logie-Almon eſtate, as ſoon as he heard that his
dear Laird had a ſon, walked down about a mile to get a
ſight of him. He was told the infant was aſleep. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
the next day. The Laird walked out; Lady Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine
feared letting the child be carried out of the room.
He returned the day but one following: the Laird <hi>at home,</hi>
ordered the infant down, to be viewed by worthy old
Steel; who, taking him into his arms, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Lord, now
letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace.</hi> I thank thee for
having permitted me to ſee (the Editor thinks) the <hi>ſeventh</hi>

Laird, equally delighted, ordered him refreſhment. He
walked gently home, ſat down in his chair, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Now I

flight without even a ſigh.</p>
               <p>Thoſe medical gentlemen of ſkill, who heard the above
fact (much ſpoken of at the time) agreed, that had he
ſeen the young Laird on the firſt day when he went for
that purpoſe, the ſpirit of the good old man had been freed
three days ſooner; that his ardent deſire had detained it.
One has frequently heard of ſimilar inſtances of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the ſpirit in its earthly priſon for hours, even
days. What a wonder is the ſpirit of man! How paſſing
wonder HE who implants it in the curiouſly wrought priſon!

Nairne, a great collector, who had a fine print of old Steel,
<pb n="ccxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:224"/>
which Mr. Monck Berkeley purchaſed, with many other cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities,
after his death, has frequently told the Editor, that
the engraver miſtook in ſetting down his age, one hundred
and nine, that it ought to have been one hundred and
thirty-nine. One cannot help dropping a tear on the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
fate of this very accompliſhed, well-informed man.
His father, Lord Nairne, unfortunately engaged in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;
the ſon fighting for the Hanover family. The
firſt duty to which he was appointed, was to go and batter
down his own noble magnificent caſtle. His late Majeſty,

him a regiment and other bounties; but the Duke of
Cumberland prevented it, by telling his Majeſty it was
<hi>impoſſible</hi> a man who had ſuffered ſo much could ever forget

and ſpeak for two or three hours in the evening, either
once a week, or once a fortnight. The Principals, Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
gentlemen of the city and neighbourhood, frequently
honoured this little ſeminary of <hi>juvenile</hi> orators with their
preſence. Two on each ſide were generally choſen to ſpeak
and oppoſe; and every one, as in the Houſe of Commons,
was permitted to riſe and ſpeak on either ſide. Thoſe
appointed to ſpeak on the ſubject always carried a ſpeech
prepared on paper. Mr. Berkeley uſed always to ſay,
<q rend="inline">"Hang that paper, I am ſo glad when I have done with
it. When I throw my notes aſide, I can ſpeak with <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
I hate to be hampered. I love to be, as the French
ſay, <hi>coudes franches.</hi> I believe I ſhall <hi>do</hi> at the bar; for I
feel twice the ſtrength after all my arguments are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="ccxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:226"/>
and pulled to pieces, that I do at going on without
oppoſition; it <hi>animates,</hi> it <hi>inſpires</hi> me."</q>
               </p>
               <p>One morning, after a Viginti evening, Mrs. Berkeley,
walking out, was met by Profeſſors Hill, Hunter, Baron, and
many others, who all congratulated her on the figure Mr.
Berkeley had made the preceding evening amongſt the
young orators. It would be waſting ink to ſay how much
the heart of the Mother of an only child muſt have felt
this commendation.</p>
               <p>A rather laughable circumſtance occurred two or three
days afterwards. Mrs. Berkeley, taking her uſual walk by
the ſea, was met by a lady, who, after <hi>complimenting</hi> her
on Mr. Berkeley's fine ſpeaking, added, <q rend="inline">"and my ſon
ſpoke too, and did pretty well, I hear."</q> Mrs. Berkeley,
who, as her Son always ſaid of her, <q rend="inline">"would not flatter
Royalty;"</q> no, not her favourite <q rend="inline">"Queen of Sheba, were

far, perhaps long ago they have done it, they will probably
again exclaim, <q rend="inline">"The creature is a FOOL! quite an IDIOT!"</q>
But the Editor never conceived any happineſs could ariſe
from ſetting two ſacks of gold together, any more than
that bread will be produced by ſetting two ſacks of wheat
ſide by ſide. But to return. This wiſe lady proceeded,
<q rend="inline">"Well, Mrs. Berkeley; as both our ſons have ſpoken, and
gained credit, let <hi>you</hi> and <hi>I</hi> make an agreement, that <hi>they</hi>

the <hi>extreme</hi> cleverneſs of the ſpeaker, replied,
<q rend="inline">"Oh! dear Madam, you know you are <hi>ſole</hi> directreſs of

excellent judge, and judicious director of young men's
education; and I have no more idea of interfering in
parts of my Son's education as a ſcholar, than I have of
ſitting down to write a Viſitation or Aſſize Sermon for his
Father; BUT I will <hi>certainly</hi> tell him what YOU, Madam,
ſay."</q> Mrs. Berkeley <hi>failed not</hi> to do it; BUT Mr. Berkeley
went on ſpeaking, without loſing <hi>any</hi> of his credit as an orator.
Two of the Scotch ſpeakers are now in England, the
learned, entertaining, Reverend Mr. James Bruce, Mr.
Berkeley's tutor, and the gentle, pleaſing Mr. William
Kemp, tutor to Mr. Lennard, who was many years ago
recommended, through Dr. Berkeley's recommendation, by
his amiable friend, the late Lord Dacre, into the family of
<pb n="ccxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:228"/>
the Earl of Beverley, where his uncommon merits as a tutor
are felt, and moſt generouſly, moſt nobly rewarded, by
the noble deſcendant of the great hero of Chevy-Chace.</p>
               <p>Soon after Mr. Berkeley's return to England he began to
feel an ardent deſire to obtain a ſeat in Parliament. How
was that wiſh to be gratified? Biſhop Berkeley was too
generous to amaſs a fortune. He conſtantly gave away
with both hands. After thirty thouſand pounds debt paid
by Mr. Berkeley's grandmother, Mrs. Frinſham, and her
ſingle ſiſter, Mrs. Cherry, of their grandfather William
Cherry, Eſquire, and <hi>eſtabliſhing,</hi> inſtead of taking, (as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by him if wanted to pay his debts,) a very good
eſtate left by him to found a charity ſchool in the pariſh of
Bray in Berkſhire, where lay a large part of his vaſt
eſtate<note n="*" place="bottom">It would be a pleaſantry to ſay, that the burning of Cliefden's "<hi>Proud Alcove</hi>" finiſhed it; but, on that conflagration, the other day, went ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds more of old Mr. Cherry's fortune; he having lent the Duke of Buckingham, commonly, juſtly, called the wicked Duke of Buckingham, that ſum to build that delightful manſion. Mr. Berkeley's Mother and Aunt have a note of hand of the Duke for ſeven thouſand pounds. The Editor did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it as any part of her fortune when ſhe married. The wonder was, that <hi>ſo very acute</hi> a man as old Mr. Cherry certainly was, <hi>ſhould lend to ſuch</hi> a man as the Duke of Buckingham, ſo large a ſum, on only a common note of hand.—but Mr. Cherry was immenſely rich, and lent to every one of his friends that aſked him—accordingly his great-grand-daughter finds <hi>ſome</hi> of her kind friends much more ready to <hi>lend</hi> than <hi>ſhe is to borrow</hi>—for which may GOD reward them here and hereafter.</note>. The South-Sea bubble had, although not beggared,
<pb n="ccxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:229"/>
yet wonderfully reduced the large remainder of Mr. Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's
fortune; ſo that, during the life of Mr. Berkeley's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he could not get a qualification that would ſit eaſy on
<hi>his</hi> conſcience. His Mother, on learning this, offered to give
up <hi>entirely</hi> into his hands her whole ſettlement, adding, <q rend="inline">"I
have, from your infancy, ever ſaid, 'If <hi>I muſt be</hi> abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
dependant on any fallen child of Adam, may it be
on Berkeley! not on dear ſweet Robert; for Berkeley
has a generoſity of ſoul that <hi>I</hi> have never ſeen in any
human being, through my whole life, but in himſelf
alone."</q> On ſaying this he exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Jeſus avert that
I ſhould be SUCH a villian. No; I would, were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
ſooner carry a brown muſket, than ever touch a
ſix-pence of your ſettlement. It is too ſmall, we all know.
No; never whilſt my name is Berkeley, will I ever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh

to <hi>add</hi> to it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On his coming home at vacation-time, he often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
curious cauſes at Weſtminſter Hall and the Old Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.
His Father one day ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Berkeley, it does not ſeem
to me that you go often to the Houſe of Commons. I

               <p>Mrs. B.—<q rend="inline">"Not truſt yourſelf! what, do you think you

               </p>
               <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"No, my dear Madam, no; but I am afraid the
Devil ſhould tempt me to long <hi>ſo much</hi> to get into Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
that I ſhould deceive myſelf, and reaſon myſelf
into a belief that a <hi>ſham</hi> qualification had no harm in it;
and therefore, the Lord being my helper, I never will

properly authorized to ſpeak. So you will never hear
any account from <hi>me</hi> of the orators there."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley went perpetually to hear Haſtings's Trial.
He told his Father, that <q rend="inline">"after liſtening with all the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he was poſſeſſed of to the harangues of a certain
great Orator, he conceived that his grand argument was
a ſtrong arm, which enabled him to <hi>thump</hi> the table vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently<note n="*" place="bottom">The Orator here deſcribed, has <hi>certainly</hi> many other arguments than <q rend="inline">"<hi>thumping the table.</hi>"</q>—But Mr. Berkeley was ſo convinced of Mr. Haſtings's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence with regard to <hi>money</hi> matters, that he felt indignation at his neareſt friends for not ſeeing it. The Editor, at one time, ſuffered a ſort of perſecution from her <hi>two</hi> ſons (the excellent Mr. Grimſton ſhe always ſtyled her <hi>ſecond</hi> ſon), ſo as to occaſion her threatening to bolt her dreſſing-room door—enter Mr. Berkeley with a thick pamphlet—<q rend="inline">"My dear Mother, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you to read <hi>this,</hi> and you will be <hi>convinced</hi> that Haſtings is an injured man."</q> 
                        <q rend="inline">"My dear Son, I have redde Mr. Haſtings's <hi>own</hi> letter, where he ſays, 'Nothing can be done in this buſineſs until Mr. Fowke is removed;' Now <hi>you know,</hi> I have told you a ſcore times, that 'if there is <hi>but one</hi> honeſt man upon earth, <hi>that man</hi> is my old friend Mr. Fowke, whom I have not ſeen theſe laſt thirty years; but men ſeldom turn rogues at <hi>fifty.</hi> You know the <hi>two</hi> inſtances of his <hi>ſtern</hi> integrity, that I have held up to your imitation ſince you were ten years old."</q> Then enter Mr. Grimſton, with two or three <hi>thick</hi> treatiſes on the INIQUITY of the Slave-trade—<q rend="inline">"Come now, my dear Madam, I am ſure you <hi>can,</hi> you <hi>will,</hi> find time to read <hi>theſe,</hi> and you will ſee <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="ccxix" facs="tcp:0761700600:231"/>
ſtrenuous aſſertor of Mr. Haſtings's innocence. He had
put himſelf to conſiderable expence to procure documents
from India, and had prepared for the preſs, perhaps as ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
an inveſtigation of Mr. Haſtings's conduct and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
as beautiful a defence as was ever penned, which
he, however, the day before it was to be ſent to the preſs,
ſacrificed to paternal authority. He brought it to the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and, with tears in his eyes, threw it on her table, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<q rend="inline">"There is a <hi>ſacrifice to duty.</hi> I beſeech you to take
care of it. It coſt me many pounds and much time, and
might have benefited, <hi>I think,</hi> an injured man. Do not
let it be loſt; perhaps it may, ſome time or other, ſee
the light."</q> It is, as requeſted, ſtill carefully preſerved,
<pb n="ccxx" facs="tcp:0761700600:232"/>
with many other things of Mr. Berkeley's writing; for he
was never idle but whilſt in company. When at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's,
he retired ſoon after dinner, and immediately after
tea. As he very ſeldom ate any ſupper, as ſoon as the
cloth was removed, his ſervant notified it to him, and
he came down and entertained his friends with his enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
converſation, and ſometimes delighted the ſoul of his
Mother, by complying with her requeſt to ſing to her the
hymn ſung by the Eton College gentlemen. It begins
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Salvator Mundi,</hi>"</q> &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">It may be aſked, why the Editor, who, as an old ſervant of her mother's once ſaid, <q rend="inline">"<hi>I don't know Latin from Engliſh,</hi>"</q> knows not Latin, but had two kind tranſlators of it, and Mr. Berkeley's voice, when he ſang any thing ſacred, was quite divine, very like Mr. Airſon's. His father, early in life, <hi>charged</hi> him never to ſing in company.</note>. until the ſervants came in to family
prayers; after which he more frequently retired to ſtudy
than to reſt.</p>
               <p>Few perſons were ever more ſtrongly impreſſed with the
terror of being called into judgement for idleneſs than Mr.
Berkeley. During the latter part of his illneſs he would
frequently exclaim, <q rend="inline">"Lord, forgive me; what an idle life
I do lead! Surely God will call me to account for it."</q>
His Mother aſſured him that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

his heavenly Father's gracious chaſtiſements, for which,

God for ſending him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley's delicate attentions to his Mother's feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were throughly amiable. When he was about three and
twenty, in the ſummer vacation he went down to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's,

was from Dr. Kenrick (the year forgot) it deſerves to be

               <p>Mr. Berkeley, when ſtaying at his Father's houſe in

been ſo charmed by it, that I have redde every line at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively;
and, when my Mother has finiſhed it, I ſhall
read it over again."</q> This book was The CALVARY of
the excellent Mr. Cumberland, juſt then publiſhed. Mr.
Berkeley ſpoke of it, <hi>as it merits to be ſpoken of,</hi> in all
<pb n="ccxxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:236"/>
companies. A <hi>learned critic</hi> once ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I am ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
to hear <hi>you</hi> ſpeak ſo very highly of it, who are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a very excellent judge of poetry,"</q> and began ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
to ſome lines which he termed proſaic. At length
Mr. Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, it is poſſible there may
be more piety than poetry in ſome of the lines; but I
think it was worth being born, if it were only to have
written that <hi>excellent</hi> work."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A gentleman once ſaid to Dr. Berkeley, <q rend="inline">"I wonder Mr.
Berkeley is not as vain and conceited as he is high, ſo
admired, ſo careſſed, and courted, as he is in town."</q>
Mr. Berkeley, in converſation at the other end of the room,
overhearing it, broke off, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Alas! Sir, no; Mr.
Berkeley <hi>knows himſelf</hi> too <hi>well</hi> to be made vain. He
knows what he is equal to, and can never be <hi>fool</hi> enough
to be vain."</q> His humility was great. When abroad, every
marked attention that was ſhown to him by eminent men
of great learning or high rank, he conſtantly, humbly,
attributed to his being the grandſon of ſo great a man as
Biſhop Berkeley, who was extremely well known and highly
reſpected, as a wonderful genius, in France, Italy, and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.
Before what a late <hi>blackguard</hi> publication has called

King of Dublin; Biſhop Berkeley ſaying, <q rend="inline">"The noticing them
would be like preſerving a <hi>dirty</hi> fly in AMBER."</q> The Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
has frequently heard Dr. Berkeley relate the following ſtory
from his father: This old monſter and Biſhop Berkeley,
then Fellow of Dublin College, a <hi>little</hi> known in the
learned world, were both at dinner in Dublin at the houſe
of an Earl, whoſe title the Editor does not at preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect,
but who had a beautiful Lady and an houſe full of
remarkably fine children. During the time of dinner, half
a ſcore of ſervants in waiting, this <hi>purpled</hi> brute ſaid,

round the table to ſee which of the footmen is the father
of them."</q> With theſe words he threw his <hi>deviliſh</hi> eyes
around the room. The Lay Peer muſt have been a ſaint
not to have ordered his domeſtics to drag the ſpiritual one
nine times through the kennel, and the Lady muſt have
been either an <hi>angel</hi> or a <hi>fool</hi> not inſtantly to have riſen
from table. They, however, contented themſelves with
never admitting his GRACE within their doors any more.
The late Dr. Berkeley uſed frequently to relate this and
two or three other ſtories, in order, as he uſed to ſay to
Mr. Berkeley, <q rend="inline">"to call your Mother out."</q> To be ſure,

               <p>The Editor and her ſiſter always went to town every

Berkeley married, for about two months or ten weeks, to
look about them, and prevent their being ruſticated. At
Ranelagh, the Ridotto, &amp;c. her Ladyſhip never failed to
find them out, come to them, and make the kindeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.
A woman of quality once, at an inſtallation at

               <p>It has been ſaid before, that Mr. Berkeley could not reſt
if he ſaw any creature in diſtreſs, from which it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for him to relieve him. In the year 1787, during the
long vacation, Mr. Berkeley, with two of his Temple friends,
J. R. Baker, Eſquire, of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and another, very
ſenſible, amiable, young gentleman, now no more, took a trip
to the continent. During their reſidence there, Mr. Berkeley
had it in his power to aſſiſt, in a very awkward and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
ſituation, a very worthy amiable perſonage of very high
rank, his Serene Highneſs the then reigning Prince of Saxe
Gotha, uncle to the King of England. The circumſtances
attending this tranſaction are too long to be related here.
In the veſſel the Prince ſaw and admired Mr. Berkeley's
wonderfully curious Highland dog of a very ſcarce breed, ſo
much as to make Mr. Berkeley often regret that he could
not prevail upon himſelf to preſent him to his Serene High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;

               <p>Mr. Berkeley anſwered for his Majeſty; but ſome of Mr.
Berkeley's Engliſh friends, to divert themſelves, encouraged
poor Ritchie's fears. His Serene Highneſs at parting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed

in England than in Scotland."</q> One day, when Mr.
Berkeley came down to dinner, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Well, I muſt
confeſs, Ritchie has at length vanquiſhed me, juſt when I
plumed myſelf on victory. As he was dreſſing my hair,
juſt now, it occurred to me I will aſk Richie, if ever he
ſaw a cruſade in Scotland, and ſee if he will anſwer, O
yes, Sir, in the <hi>Loodons,</hi> i. e. the Lothians. I put the
queſtion, Ritchie, did you ever ſee a cruſade?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Ritchie.—<q rend="inline">"Cruſade, Sir? what an a thing is it? is it
any beaſty?"</q> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> a beaſt.</p>
               <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"No; it is a great number of people collected
together to go to Jeruſalem to recover it out of the hands
of the Infidels."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Ritchie.—<q rend="inline">"O! yes, Sir; I have ſeen that in the Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
(his native county). When you were in Edinburgh
laſt, you gave me leave to viſit my friends; and I heard
<pb n="ccxxxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:247"/>
of them, and went to the wood where they were all
waiting to go to Jeruſalem."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley then recollected to have heard in Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,
that there were a few deluded poor creatures who
had aſſembled themſelves in a wood, expecting to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
through the air to the Holy Land. Their numbers
increaſed prodigiouſly afterwards, as was related, and a long
account was given of them in ſome Magazine, the Editor
thinks the Gentleman's. What became of theſe poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
ſouls ſhe does not recollect to have heard; but Mr.
Berkeley, laughing, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I muſt now give it up as a gone
cauſe, the hope of finding out any thing Ritchie has not
ſeen in the Loodons."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The PUBLICATOR, as mentioned before, very ſoon found
out that he did not like the ſituation of his living. Poor
Dr. Berkeley was <hi>worried</hi> to beſiege good Archbiſhop Secker
to exchange it for another; one with a better houſe, and
<hi>much</hi> better income, was ſoon given to this <q rend="inline">"<hi>particular,</hi>"</q>
this GRATEFUL friend; where he commenced his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and, by the <hi>elegance</hi> of his manners, ſoon
formed that <hi>intimacy</hi> with the preſent Sir Edward Dering,
Baronet, of Surrenden, which, for many months, afforded
ſo much amuſement in Weſt Kent, and even in Eaſt Kent.
His contentions with that gentleman, concerning game,
could not be that he might ſend ſome to his friend, Dr.
<pb n="ccxxxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:248"/>
Berkeley; for he never, in his whole life, ſent him even a
lark.</p>
               <p>Some time after the PUBLICATOR had been gratified
by the exchange of his living, Dr. Berkeley went, as he
frequently did, to make a viſit of ſome weeks at Lambeth.
The firſt day at dinner his Grace accoſted him thus: <q rend="inline">"Dr.
Berkeley, I HEAR that your friend Mr. <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap> has
been in town for about a fortnight. <hi>I hear</hi> it, for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſay <hi>I ſaw</hi> him. He did not find his way to Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth."</q>
Poor Dr. Berkeley ſat abaſhed at, as he termed it,
the brutal folly, to ſay nothing of the <hi>ingratitude,</hi> of this
<hi>particular</hi> friend, and replied, <q rend="inline">"I hope that your Grace
muſt have been miſinformed."</q>—<q rend="inline">"No, my good young
gentleman, I have not been miſinformed;" (then
quickening his voice, as he frequently did;) "for he was
ſeen driving over Weſtminſter-bridge in a hackney-coach,"
(the <hi>Publicator</hi> had not <hi>then</hi> a carriage of his own;) "and,"
(quickening his voice ſtill more) "in <hi>many</hi> other parts
of the town."</q> To this no anſwer could <hi>poſſibly</hi> be made.
A <hi>mourne ſilence</hi> followed, until broken by that lovelieſt
of women, the angelic, the incomparable Miſs Talbot, who,
to relieve her diſtreſſed friend, introduced ſome <hi>pleaſanter</hi>
ſubject, than the marvellous (as Dr. Berkeley termed
it) conduct of the <hi>particular</hi> friend. Dr. Berkeley, at
his return home, appeared extemely chagrined on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="ccxxxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:249"/>
Some time after, on taxing the <hi>Publicator</hi> with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountably ſtrange conduct, he excuſed himſelf very <hi>cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly,</hi>
by ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Aye, I believe I ſhould have gone, but
I had not time; for, to tell you the truth, <hi>I</hi> went to
London (always to a friend's houſe) to ſhew <hi>Beely</hi> and
<hi>Peggy</hi> the wax-work, and the monuments, and the lions,
and every thing."</q> It was very lucky that it did not occur
to him to carry <hi>Beely</hi> and <hi>Peggy</hi> to <hi>dinner</hi> with his Grace on
a <hi>public</hi> day, and ſhew them the Lollards Tower there.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Publicator</hi> ſeems to have taken pains to tack at the
very end of the liſt of Biſhop Horne's friend's Dr. (then
George Berkeley, Eſquire)—a <hi>real</hi> Eſquire, from his poor,
<hi>unknown</hi> Father's rank in life, and expending every year at
Oxford, as he has repeatedly told the Editor,—not in vice,
She is ſure, as his excellent Father ſaid, when, on his arrival
in Oxford, Dr. Berkeley ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I am aſhamed, my Lord, to
ſay that I have ſpent ſix hundred pounds in four months—here
is the account."</q> The Biſhop made the above generous
reply, <q rend="inline">"Not in vice, I am ſure, child,"</q> and threw the account
into the fire. It was great part in virtue. A ſervant to wait on
himſelf, and a groom for his horſes, could not be reckoned
extravagant. A young man, who never taſted wine, could
not ſpend more than a thouſand pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> but,
having never been, according to his Son, <hi>buffeted</hi> through a
public ſchool, and being quite unacquainted with charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
he was perpetually impoſed on by deſigning, ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="ccxxxviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:250"/>
young men, to whom he was <hi>too</hi> bountiful, as appears
by his accounts, now in the Editor's poſſeſſion, from the
day he arrived at Chriſt Church. He is receiving his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
<hi>they,</hi> no doubt, <hi>will</hi> receive theirs. Much went in
charity to real, frequently unknown, objects.</p>
               <p>The Editor has frequently heard Dr. Berkeley ſay, that
one morning at Chriſt Church, his ſervant ſhaving him,
he redde a ſermon preached on charity for lying-in women
in Alderſgate-Street. The preacher, the Editor thinks a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
deſcribed the miſeries of <hi>poor</hi> women in thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
ſo pathetically, that Dr. Berkeley ſaid <q rend="inline">"I, a young
man, had never thought on. I felt it ſo ſtrongly, that,
with one half of my chin unſhaved, I made my ſervant
lay down the razor, catched up a ſheet of paper, wrote to
my banker an order to pay to the treaſure of the hoſpital
fifty pounds, to make me a governor for life, for fear I
ſhould be at any time unwilling to pay the annual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Some Scotch friend, the Editor has not been able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcover
who has celebrated Dr. Berkeley's charities to the
poor, during his <hi>ſéjour</hi> with his Son at the Univerſity of St.
Andrew's, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"that he every year gave away above
two hundred pounds with his own hands."</q> This is a
miſtake. He very ſeldom did give with his own elegant
hands, unleſs his wife's may be called his own; for unleſs,
<pb n="ccxxxix" facs="tcp:0761700600:251"/>
which was frequently the caſe, he incloſed in a blank cover
a ten, often a twenty pound bank note, to any perſon, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to <hi>aſk,</hi> though not to <hi>receive</hi> charity, whoſe face he had
never ſeen, only heard from good authority of their diſtreſs.
How often has he thus <q rend="inline">"<hi>made the widow's heart to ſing for
joy,</hi>"</q> and with holy Job <q rend="inline">"the bleſſing of him that was
ready to periſh came upon him."</q> In other inſtances,
with regard to the ſurrounding poor, he always left the
pleaſing taſk on Mrs. Berkeley; conſtantly ſaying, <q rend="inline">"I
never trouble myſelf; my wife is my almoner;"</q> adding,
as Mrs. Berkeley once ſaid to her excellent kind friend Dr.
Lynch, Prebendary of Canterbury, on his aſking her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a poor old man, <q rend="inline">"<hi>I</hi> know nothing of him; when
<hi>once</hi> I have introduced an object of charity to you, or
Mrs. Tatton, (one of the charitable daughters of the <hi>nobly</hi>
charitable Dean and Mrs. Lynch,) <hi>I</hi> never trouble myſelf
<hi>any more</hi> about them, but ſearch out ſome new objects,
well knowing that <hi>they</hi> will have ample abundant care
taken of <hi>them.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>A Scotch miniſter was once celebrating to Mrs. Berkeley
the <hi>vaſt</hi> charities of the LATE Earl of Lauderdale—a very
worthy Nobleman HE was. He began by ſaying, <q rend="inline">"His cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
are <hi>amazingly great</hi> indeed. As ſurely as you ſit
there, Madam, that man puts a <hi>guinea</hi> into the plate, (a
plate at every kirk door, guarded by two ruling elders,)
<pb n="ccxl" facs="tcp:0761700600:252"/>
every Sabbath day, and every year three guineas at the
<hi>Occaſion</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">The annual kirk ſacrament, to which a cook of the Editor's, lamentable to tell, returned ſo often to the kirk that ſhe was ſhamefully intoxicated. The expence of wine on theſe <hi>Occaſions</hi> is ſaid to be very great indeed, that of bread very ſmall.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"Lord Lauderdale has, I know,
not a large <hi>paternal</hi> eſtate; but he married a very
worthy friend of mine, the daughter of Sir Thomas
Loombe, with an Engliſh fortune of four thouſand
pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> ſo that lending fifty-three guineas an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to the Lord <hi>I</hi> do not conſider as being ſo very
bountiful as you Sir, do. I will now tell you of a
bountiful donor to the poor, the late Dean of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
father to our equally charitable, amiable ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
at Turin, Sir William Lynch. The Dean had a
large paternal eſtate, married one of the daughters of
Archbiſhop Wake with a large fortune, and had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
church preferment: now gueſs what he gave an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to the poor."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Scotch Miniſter.—<q rend="inline">"I cannot tell."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. B.—<q rend="inline">"Gueſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Scotch Min.—<q rend="inline">"Why, perhaps he might give them a
hundred pounds a year."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="ccxli" facs="tcp:0761700600:253"/>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"No; but he gave them nearer to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand;
for of all his vaſt income, it is univerſally known
at Canterbury, and forty miles round, that he conſtantly
gave to the poor ten pounds out of every hundred he
received, from whatever quarter it came, beſide all ſort
of good things made for the ſick poor in his kitchen and
ſtore-room. And to this, that he kept open houſe for
rich and poor; and when the ſilk manufactory (now,
alas! no more) was at a low ebb, he nobly aſked,
'Will my new furniſhing the deanery with ſilk damaſk
help to raiſe it?' and being anſwered in the affirmative,
he inſtantly ordered five hundred pounds worth of furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
damaſk to be wove, which ſaved it at that time."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be hoped, when a ſcore or two more of ladies
have been burnt to death by wearing muſlin gowns in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(<hi>abſurd, ridiculous, fooliſh</hi> faſhions) that the Editor's
poor honeſt <hi>quondam</hi> neighbours may again uſe their
looms. If the Editor's leiſure had permitted, ſhe would
have adviſed them, in the Canterbury news-papers, not to
elect any member to repreſent their antient city in the new
Parliament, who would not promiſe to <hi>make</hi> his wife and
daughters wear ſilk gowns, at leaſt during the winter ſeaſon.
The Inhabitants of Canterbury are ſurely as reſpectable as
thoſe of Mancheſter, who will not admit of their printed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linens
being <hi>ſlightly</hi> taxed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="ccxlii" facs="tcp:0761700600:254"/>
The Editor has had occaſion to remark that the PUBLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATOR
was not very forward to make any grateful return
for any favour beſtowed on him; for he never preſented
his friend Dr. Berkeley even with a lark<note n="*" place="bottom">See above, p. ccxxxvi.</note>. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſaid, that in the county of Berks during the partridge
ſeaſon there are as many guns as birds; therefore game is
always a moſt agreeable preſent, eſpecially to thoſe who
keep much company; and frequently, in their ſeveral ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
would arrive hares, partridges, pheaſants, &amp;c. from
the very grateful Mr. Andrews, of Marden in Kent. He
never ſuffered any neighbour to go to London without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting
him to take ſome game, and ſend it down by the
Maidenhead coach. The year that Archbiſhop Secker
preſented Mr. Andrews to this living, apples ſailed in every
county of England except Kent; which is no great wonder,
ſince the farmers of that county pay moſt careful attention
to their trees in winter, clearing them of all dead wood,
moſs, &amp;c. Mr. Andrews packed up his whole crop of
apples in hampers, and ſent them all, except a <hi>very few</hi>
ſtinted ones. Apples that year were ſuch rarities, that
Mrs. Berkeley ſuggeſted to Dr. Berkeley to ſend them to
Lambeth Palace; which was ſpeedily done, a few only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſerved as curioſities; and a moſt acceptable offering
they proved. Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley going to make ſome
ſtay at Lambeth Palace ſoon after, the firſt day after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
from ſome apples being on the table, the Archbiſhop, with
<pb n="ccxliii" facs="tcp:0761700600:255"/>
his wonted politeneſs, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Lady and Gentleman, will
you not eat ſome of your <hi>own</hi> fine apples? How came it
to paſs that <hi>your</hi> trees produced this wonderfully ſcarce
year?"</q> To which Dr. Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"Alas! my
good Lord, we had not a ſcore on all our trees. They
are the grateful offering of a very grateful man, Mr.
Andrews; and my wife thought that, as <hi>we</hi> owed the
apples to your Grace's goodneſs to him, they ought, in
<hi>conſcience,</hi> to be ſent to your Grace:"</q> who, with his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
pleaſantry, turning to Mrs. Berkeley, who had
the honour to be a great favourite with his Grace, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"Why, my good young lady, I don't know that I ought
to accept <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe apples.</hi> I am afraid they are a <hi>little ſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal.</hi>"</q>
To which Mrs. Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"Oh! no,
my Lord: if they had come <hi>before</hi> your Grace had
preferred Mr. Andrews, it might have been a caſe for
Biſhop Taylor's <hi>Ductor Dubitantium;</hi> but, I think, as it
is, your Grace may eat them with a <hi>very ſafe conſcience.</hi>"</q>
His Grace laughed heartily, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I remember Arch
biſhop Potter uſed to tell of a man whom he had given
a ſmall living, on which grew a remarkably fine pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree.
He uſed every year to ſend the pears to Lambeth.
His Grace gave him a ſecond, much better, living; and
he uſed to ſay, 'Whether the pear-tree <hi>died,</hi> or the pears
were <hi>blighted every year,</hi> I know not; but I know that I
<hi>never ſaw another pear</hi> after I gave the <hi>ſecond</hi> living."</q> This
GRATEFUL man did not, probably, like the PUBLICATOR,
<pb n="ccxliv" facs="tcp:0761700600:256"/>
expect one of the <hi>three</hi> ſtalls at Canterbury. He was at
leaſt <hi>modeſt,</hi> if ungrateful.</p>
               <p>It is not poſſible to avoid contraſting two men, both of
whom were indebted for their firſt comfortable eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in life to the exquiſite amiability of Dr. Berkeley
the Reverend Dr. Glaſſe and the PUBLICATOR. When
Mr. Monck Berkeley was about ſix or ſeven years old, Dr.
Glaſſe ſaid, more than once, <q rend="inline">"If you and Mrs. Berkeley
would confide your little man to me, how happy ſhould
I be! what care and attention I would pay him! and I
am ſure, if you would condeſcend to <hi>accept</hi> it, I deſire
neither fee nor reward."</q> The laſt grateful offer was of
courſe thankfully declined; and from Mr. Berkeley's birth
his Father determined, that, if God ſpared his life, he
ſhould be educated at a Public School; often lamenting
that the good Biſhop had not ſent <hi>him</hi> to one, particularly
after his ſon grew up, often ſaying, <q rend="inline">"he had then got a
ſecond guardian."</q> Biſhop Berkeley, at one time, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
years paid four hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> to different
maſters to inſtruct his children in Muſic, Painting, Fencing,
Riding, and French; the Latin and Greek he entruſted to
none but himſelf. His ſons were never ſuffered either to
ride or walk out unattended by a careful ſervant.</p>
               <p>When Dr. Berkeley came to Oxford, at the age of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
attended by a moſt reſpectable worthy Chaplain of
<pb n="ccxlv" facs="tcp:0761700600:257"/>
his Father's, and his own ſervant, he had never rode a mile
alone; and he had contracted an habit of meditating and
compoſing on horſeback, which occaſioned his being the
moſt careleſs of riders, leaving the horſe's bridle ſo very
looſe, that he was perpetually thrown. Soon after his
marriage, Mrs. Berkeley, finding this to be the caſe, made
it a point that he never ſhould ride without a ſervant.
When Mr. Berkeley grew up, he joined in what Dr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
called his Mother's <hi>perſecution,</hi> and one day ſaid, <q rend="inline">"What
is the reaſon, I would fain know, why your Mother lets
you ride fifty miles without a ſervant, and over hedge
and ditch, nobody knows where, hunting, and won't let
me ride to Taplow or Maidenhead alone?"</q> To which
Mr. Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"Ah! my dear Sir, if <hi>you</hi> had been
<hi>buffeted</hi> for ſeven years though Eton School, <hi>I dare ſay, my</hi>
Mother would have let you ride alone as <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Berkeley conſtantly hunted with buck-hounds twice a week—frequently with Mr. Clayton's hounds. It was not <hi>ſo quietly</hi> as Mr. Monck Berkeley ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; for Dr. Berkeley uſed to ſay, on hunting days, <q rend="inline">"<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                              <desc> _____ </desc>

Theſe ejaculations were frequently continued till the afternoon. They were certainly heard by HIM who heareth prayer, and, as it ſhould ſeem, anſwered; for Mr. Berkeley never once got a fall in hunting—he rode remarkably well."</q> He never would croſs his Majeſty in the chaſe. He uſed frequently to expreſs indignation at a hunting butcher, particularly well mounted, who uſed to croſs ſo as ſometimes to endanger his Majeſty; ſaying, <q rend="inline">"What can the fellow be made of, to be ſuch a ſavage?"</q> to which Dr. Berkeley uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"Why, of bulls hides, to be ſure."</q>
                     </note> quietly as ſhe
<pb n="ccxlvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:258"/>
does me; but that is out of the queſtion, for ride alone
you muſt not; that is agreed on all hands."</q> To which
Dr. Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"I am ſure, you are obliged to <hi>me,</hi>
Sir. I wiſh I had been buffeted <hi>any where</hi> in my youth,
as you have been, you rogue."</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to return from this digreſſion to the contraſt of, as
Mrs. George Berkeley ever termed him, the really grateful
Dr. Glaſſe. We have ſeen his kind offer, in the preceding
page; we will now proceed to the PUBLICATOR's polite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal.
When Archbiſhop Cornwallis viſited at Canterbury,
he was of courſe at the Deanery. It was impoſſible that
the attendant Biſhop ſhould be alſo lodged there. On a
conſultation concerning the place where he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and entertained, not one of the Prebendaries ſeemed
deſirous of that honour. The generous hoſpitable Dr.
Lynch was not then a member of the choir; and it muſt in
juſtice be ſaid, that numbers of the Prebendaries, who are
not in office, let their prebendal houſes, and are only viſitors
or boarders to their tenants; ſo they have it not in their
power to receive any one. It was ſuggeſted that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
muſt be contented to go to one of the miſerably bad,
exceſſively dear, inns in the city. This ſhocked Dr.
Berkeley, although only the ſon of a poor UNKNOWN Iriſh
Prelate; and he inſtantly ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Bad as my houſe is, it is
better than a naſty dirty inn; he ſhall be my gueſt."</q> As
ſoon as it was known who the attending Biſhop was, Dr.
<pb n="ccxlvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:259"/>
Berkeley wrote a polite letter, requeſting the honour of
having his Lordſhip for his gueſt. Mrs. Berkeley requeſted
her amiable conſort to permit her to invite his lady, with
whom ſhe had the honour to be acquainted, and whoſe
lovely eldeſt ſiſter, ſweet, beautiful Miſs Maddox, was a
beloved friend of her childhood. Biſhop Maddox, when a
Welſh biſhop, had for ſeveral ſummers a houſe at Eaſt
Burnham, in the neighbourhood of White Waltham. That
lovely creature died early. The Editor cheriſhes, with
tender care, a keepſake, a ſmall ſilver medal, given by the
good Biſhop to his ſweet daughter, to preſent to her little
friend.</p>
               <p>Some days before the arrival of the Archbiſhop, &amp;c.
Dr. Berkeley ſaid, <q rend="inline">"the children (then both living at home
and going to Dr. Beauvoir's ſchool) will be horridly in
the ſervants' way, for we muſt keep open houſe for a
fortnight. What can we do with them?"</q> Mrs. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley

Mrs. Frinſham, then at Dr. Berkeley's, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"You know I am going to Ramſgate, and I will take <hi>one.</hi>"</q>
It was Dr. Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"You are very kind; you
ſhall take Robert: and it has juſt occurred to me that
I will ſend Berkeley to *****; HE will be glad of an
opportunity of obliging ME."</q> Dr. Berkeley was, alas!
ever too apt to judge of others by his amiable ſelf. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
<pb n="ccxlviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:260"/>
with this idea, he wrote to the PUBLICATOR,
ſtating his ſituation, and ſaying, <q rend="inline">"On ſuch a day John will
deliver into your care my eldeſt boy for a fortnight; at
the expiration of which I ſhall fetch him home."</q> By
the return of the poſt, Dr. Berkeley received a letter from
the PUBLICATOR, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"that he was very ſorry that it
ſo happened that he could not poſſibly receive his little
<note n="*" place="bottom">Nor ſpelt, but always ſo pronounced, by the <hi>elegant</hi> Publicator, when ſpeaking of the young gentlemen his boarders—<q rend="inline">"My bouys"</q>—or of his own ſon, who was a remarkably elegant lad. The Editor has not ſeen him ſince he was a very pleaſing youth, when ſhe adviſed his father, in return for the Latin and Greek he taught his ſon, to make him teach him a little politeneſs. Dr. Berkeley ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Nobody flatters ***** like <hi>my wife;</hi>"</q> on which Mrs. Berkeley fired, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"<hi>I</hi> flatter him! how can you ſay ſo?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Nay, I will prove it; for, whenever he is here, you won't ſuffer any body elſe to ſpeak; but ſay, do pray hold you tongueS, that <hi>I</hi> may hear what ***** ſays,"</q> about Botany, Farming, &amp;c. in which he is well ſkilled.</note>
                     <hi>bouy;</hi> but that he had juſt ſettled all matters to take his
pupils to the ſea, to ſhew them the ſhipping, and give
them a week's pleaſure;—it was unlucky, but it could
not be helped."</q> Dr. Berkeley flew with this letter to
Mrs. Berkeley, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Well, this is the luckieſt thing
in the world;"</q> then redde the epiſtle; obſerving, <q rend="inline">"it
will make Berkeley" (juſt then turned of eleven years
old, and, as an excellent judge uſed to ſay, "the beſt-bred
properly behaved child of that age in England; no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
manly airs, but a ſweetly polite lad") "as happy
as a prince, poor fellow."</q> Dr. Berkeley notified this
by letter immediately to the PUBLICATOR, who <hi>inſtantly</hi>
                  <pb n="ccxlix" facs="tcp:0761700600:261"/>
returned the following <hi>elegant, grateful,</hi> anſwer. The let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is carefully preſerved. <q rend="inline">"My dear Friend, (his conſtant
familiar addreſs to Dr. Berkeley,) <hi>I cannot</hi> help thinking
<hi>you very unreaſonable,</hi> in wanting to faſten your Son upon
<hi>me,</hi> eſpecially at a time when I have told you, that
<hi>I cannot</hi> take him."</q> The letter goes on in the ſame <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi>
ſtyle. Poor Dr. Berkeley was, for the time, <hi>very, very</hi>
angry indeed; and Mrs. Berkeley <hi>maliciouſly</hi> laughed at the
<hi>gratitude</hi> of his <hi>dear Friend.</hi> After ſome time, Dr. Berkeley
wrote a letter to the Publicator; and, as was frequently
his cuſtom, when going out to dinner, paſſing from his
ſtudy, threw half a dozen letters on the table in Mrs.
Berkeley's dreſſing-room, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"I am in haſte; I ſhall
be diſtanced; pray ſeal theſe unſealed ones; and ſend
them all; with, yours, to poſt."</q> The letter to the <hi>grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Friend was ſafely ſealed; and Mrs. Berkeley, having
very little of our grandmother Eve's curioſity in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
did not aſk permiſſion to read it; but, hollowing
it up, ſhe, with a good pen, wrote, as plainly as ſhe could
contrive to do, the little word <hi>gratitude.</hi> Off went the letter
to the poſt. In a few days Dr. Berkeley, coming into the
drawing-room to tea, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I have got a letter from
*****, in which he ſeems much diſquieted. He aſks
what could poſſibly induce ſome member of my family to
write on the edge of the inſide of the letter I laſt wrote to
him the word <hi>gratitude.</hi> My dear, do you know any thing
about it?"</q> Mrs. Berkeley, from her cradle, to (ſhe
<pb n="ccl" facs="tcp:0761700600:262"/>
truſts) her coffin, too proud to tell a lie, inſtantly replied,
<q rend="inline">"To be ſure I do; for <hi>I</hi> wrote it."</q>—Dr. Berkeley ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"Why would you write?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Becauſe <hi>I</hi> think it a <hi>mighty
pretty word.</hi>"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Your wrath againſt *****, like moſt
violent blazes, has abated."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Editor cannot diſmiſs the PUBLICATOR without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking,
that, had it pleaſed the Divine Goodneſs to have
ſpared Dr. Berkeley to have ſeen the contempt <hi>endeavoured</hi>
to be thrown on his very deeply-learned, juſtly, univerſally
admired Father, his indignation would <hi>not</hi> have ſubſided,
as it for ſome time did, on account of his little Son. Dr.
Berkeley never did, never would, forgive a greater man
than even the Publicator, for ſpeaking, as he thought, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
againſt his excellent Father; for which great man and
his incomparable writings he had through life the greateſt
reſpect, <q rend="inline">"RAMBLER John,"</q> as Dr. Berkeley, who generally
redde a Rambler once a week, termed that great man.
His Son always called him the noble learned Bear. The
accident happening at Oxford was too well known then,
too well remembered by many gentlemen then preſent,
ſtill living, to be here detailed. Suffice it therefore to ſay,
that Johnſon's want of <hi>le ſavoir vivre</hi> occaſioned his ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culing
Biſhop Berkeley's American ſcheme, by which he
meant to introduce Epiſcopacy there, always declaring, <q rend="inline">"if
it was not done in a few years, the Colonies would revolt
from the Mother Country."</q> The event has ſhown that this
<pb n="ccli" facs="tcp:0761700600:263"/>
                  <hi>unknown</hi> Prelate was not a <hi>falſe</hi> Prophet. What the Father
could not accompliſh, the Son contrived to bring about, by
his intereſt with the Scotch Biſhops; the very excellent,
very deeply learned Biſhop Skinner; the very pious Biſhop
Falconer, who died ſoon after; and the amiable worthy
Sir John Strachan, Baronet; as now that he is no more
may be <hi>publicly</hi> known. In a letter to a Friend, written
ſome time after, Dr. Berkeley ſays, <q rend="inline">"I was well aware that
it would <hi>never</hi> be forgiven, but I rejoice that I have
done it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Berkeley ſelt his amiable heart gratified in rendering
every poſſible ſervice in his power to the repeal of Lord
Hardwicke's horrid act after the Rebellion in 1745. Had
Dr. Berkeley's advice been adhered to, the firſt attempt
had ſucceeded, when the three Scotch Prelates came over
the firſt time to ſolicit it; but in moſt tranſactions there is
generally a Marplot. Dr. Berkeley was particularly happy
in entertaining at his houſe in Berkſhire, and endeavouring
to return the very polite hoſpitality of Sir John Strachan
to himſelf and family at Dundee, and of Biſhop Skinner to
his Son when at Aberdeen, where Mr. Monck Berkeley had
the freedom of the city preſented to him, as he had of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other cities and towns in Scotland, and a licence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to ſhoot on very manor wherever he went. He
ſpent near a fortnight at Taymouth moſt agreeably. The
Editor fears to truſt her once retentive, now, alas! trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
<pb n="cclii" facs="tcp:0761700600:264"/>
memory, to ſay, of ſixteen gentlemen who ſat down
to dinner, every day, how many were John Campbell. This
came out accidentally. Some one, not knowing Mr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's
partiality for Scotland, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"How ridiculous they
are, calling themſelves by the names of their eſtates!"</q>
Mr. Berkeley reddened, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, why ſo?
how would you have them diſtinguiſh themſelves?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Why, by their Chriſtian names, as we do."</q>—<q rend="inline">"That
will not do, Sir. The mode of diſtinguiſhing ſeveral
brothers in a public ſchool, <hi>major, minor,</hi> &amp;c. will not
do; nor will <hi>firſt, ſecond, third,</hi> do."</q> He then men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
as above related. The worthy learned Laird of Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladar
(certainly not ſpelt right by the Editor, although ſo
pronounced) and his accompliſhed, amiable, eldeſt ſon,
both much beloved by Mr. Berkeley were two of near half
a ſcore John Campbells. Mr. Berkeley retained a moſt
grateful ſenſe of the kind, elegant hoſpitality at Ahaladar.
Talking frequently, after his return from College, of Jack
Ahaladar, his brother aſked, <q rend="inline">"Who is Jack Ahaladar, of
whom you talk ſo much?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Why, the <hi>young</hi> Laird, a
charming young man—YOU would like <hi>him.</hi>"</q>—Probably
now the elegant Laird of Ahaladar, as the Editor thinks ſhe
was told the worthy old Laird is dead. He preſented Mr.
Berkeley with a very curious original letter, which, when
the Editor can afford to print the ſecond volume of Literary
Relics, will be publiſhed in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="ccliii" facs="tcp:0761700600:265"/>
To return from this digreſſion. Dr. Johnſon had no
ſooner finiſhed his rude ſentence, than Dr. (then Mr.) Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
then a little turned of twenty, roſe from his ſeat,
reached his cap, made his bow, and, to the no ſmall
diſtreſs of the gentleman who had invited him to meet
Dr. Johnſon, quitted the room in great indignation before
ſupper. On ſome of the company, intimates of Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
reproaching him for his <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap> conduct, HE made a ſort
of <hi>amende honorable,</hi> by ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Why, I think the Biſhop's
ſcheme no bad one; but I abuſed it, to take down the
young gentleman, leſt he ſhould be too vain of having
had SUCH A FATHER."</q> Some one preſumed to ſay Mr.
Berkeley was exquiſitely well-bred, not at all inſolent; to
which he replied, <q rend="inline">"No, not at all, but I thought it might
do him good to mortify him <hi>a little.</hi>"</q> Dr. Johnſon wiſhed to
have written the Biſhop's life; but Dr. Berkeley ſaid, <q rend="inline">"he would
not furniſh him with any documents;"</q> which Mr. Monck
Berkeley uſed exceedingly to regret, ſaying to his Father,
<q rend="inline">"My dear Sir, it will never be ſo written as Johnſon would
have written it;"</q> to which Dr. Berkeley uſed to reply,
<q rend="inline">"It may be ſo; but I was reſolved HE ſhould not write it.
You may, if you pleaſe."</q> Dr. Johnſon, through a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
friend, made many attempts to viſit Dr. Berkeley in
Berkſhire, and once ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I have a good mind to go down
to Cookham, and ſee what they would ſay to me."</q> Mrs.
Berkeley hoped that her beloved partner would have ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"We ſhould be very happy to ſee him;"</q> but his reply was
<pb n="ccliv" facs="tcp:0761700600:266"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"No; the man that could ſpeak ſlightingly of my great
Father ſhall never be entertained under his Son's roof."</q>
It is therefore probable, that this reſpectful mention of
Biſhop Berkeley by the PUBLICATOR would have completed
the buſineſs begun by the ſmothering of the Conſecration
Sermon for four years.</p>
               <p>Dr. Berkeley preſerved all the letters he received, except
now and then one, which he flung into the fire before he
appeared to have redde it through; and, like his Father and
Dean Swift, ſome he never opened at all, but threw them
into a drawer. After his lamented death, the Editor found
a baker's dozen (fourteen) from a fleecing Ingrate, with
the ſeal unbroken, as ſhe told the man when obliged to
hold a ſhort converſation with him. It has been often ſaid
of the Editor's grandfather, the celebrated Francis Cherry,
Eſquire, that he met with more Ingrates than any other man
ever did. I ſuppoſe of moſt perſons of very large fortunes
and very liberal minds, it may, with equal truth, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.
Dr. Berkeley's fortune was by no means large, but
his <hi>ſoul</hi> was noble. He, by his wiſe advice and direction,
made the fortunes of great numbers. Mrs. Berkeley uſed
often to ſay to him, <q rend="inline">"My dear friend, you can make the
fortune of every one you take in hand, but your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and your Son, and you will not ſtir a ſtroke for
<hi>him.</hi>"</q> His reply conſtantly was, <q rend="inline">"I cannot help it.
I cannot aſk or puſh for myſelf or for him. If others do
<pb n="cclv" facs="tcp:0761700600:267"/>
not, it muſt remain undone by me."</q> Both are now hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
provided for by <q rend="inline">"<hi>that Friend who ſticketh cloſer than a
brother;</hi>"</q> both are receiving the reward of their labour of
love to real friends and baſe ingrates, whom may God, for
Chriſt's ſake, forgive, prays the Editor.</p>
               <p>Having been <hi>obliged, neceſſarily obliged,</hi> to deſcant ſo much
on that odious temper of the mind, INGRATITUDE, ſhe turns,
with double, treble pleaſure, to what her beloved, reſpected,
friend Mrs. Duncombe has ever obligingly obſerved, is the
prominent feature in her character; to whom that lady has
repeatedly ſaid, <q rend="inline">"No one can do any thing for you but give

Not long ago, about a quarter after nine, juſt as the Editor was ſitting down to her ſlice of French roll and glaſs of beer, her ſervant announcing the arrival of a Lady in the drawing-room, the Editor involuntarily ſaid, <q rend="inline">"If it had been five minutes later, I had ſupped, and it would have been ſo pleaſant to have enjoyed <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Some days before Archbiſhop Cornwallis's arrival at Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,
as before mentioned, one afternoon the ſervant
announced the arrival of that lovelieſt of women, in mind
as well as perſon, the late Mrs. Tucker. As ſoon as ſeated,
ſhe began, in her ſweetly muſical voice, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"that,
having heard that Dr. Berkeley was to have the attendant
Biſhop for his gueſt," ſhe came to beg that Maſter
Berkeley might be her gueſt for the next fortnight, that
ſhe had prepared a bed for him, and that the utmoſt care
ſhould be taken of him."</q> THAT no one in the county of
Kent could doubt, where her fame, as well as in many
other counties, was, as it juſtly merited, blazed abroad.</p>
               <p>A young gentleman of large fortune at Canterbury
School, the amiable Richard Tilden, Eſquire, who boarded
at the ſecond maſter's, Mr. Tucker's, was nurſed by Mrs.

then lying-in, cauſed his bed to be removed into her own
chamber, that <hi>ſhe</hi> might <hi>ſee</hi> he got his medicines at the

coach to carry him back to Mrs. Tucker, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"that he
liked <hi>her</hi> nurſing better than home nurſing;"</q> and the

related to her by her very ſenſible worthy friend, the late
Lady Head, and by many other perſons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tilden was a <hi>more</hi> than father to the Editor's youngeſt
Son, of whom he was ſo very fond, and to whom he was ſo
very kind, that the little creature one day ſaid to his Mother,
<q rend="inline">"Mamma, <hi>I</hi> ſhall never want money; for Dick Tilden (it
is the cuſtom at Canterbury School to call the eldeſt and
all the Brothers by their Chriſtian name) "bids me, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I want a ſhilling, come to him; and if any great boy,
that <hi>I</hi> cannot <hi>manage,</hi> beats me, he always beats him
<hi>ſoundly</hi> for his pains."</q> Mr. Tilden, when the amiable
protector of the beauteous little Robert, was eighteeny ears
old; ſoon going to the univerſity, he ſtaid to mourn the
death of his grateful little <hi>protegé.</hi> How amiable are ſome
youths! what <hi>odious</hi> ſavages are others! But the exquiſite
<hi>unaffected</hi> ſweetneſs of Mrs. Tucker, (the Editor allows <hi>unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected</hi>
ſweetneſs, gentleneſs, &amp;c. &amp;c.) not only infuſed
ſweetneſs into her <hi>own</hi> children, but into <hi>moſt</hi> of her
boarders, generally ſons of the firſt gentlemen in the county,
often from other counties.</p>
               <p>The inſtance of an amiably <hi>retentive</hi> grateful mind is
now to be adduced from <hi>one</hi> of thoſe boarders. The Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
received the account from ſuch authority as precludes
a poſſibility of her having been deceived; beſides, as it is
often ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Facts are ſtubborn things."</q>

The preſent Lord Thurlow, immediately on his receiving
the Great Seal, applied to a Kentiſh gentleman, <q rend="inline">"Has my
dear old miſtreſs, Mrs. Tucker, any ſon that I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"No, my Lord; her eldeſt ſon is but
twenty."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Don't tell ME of <hi>twenty;</hi> the living of
Graveſend ſhall be held for him till he is <hi>four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>"</q>
That very learned, worthy, careful, now private,
inſtructor of youth, with his amiable partner, has been
many years at Graveſend, bleſſing the noble gratitude of
the generous GRATEFUL Lord Thurlow. Why is gratitude
ſo <hi>very rare,</hi> ſo <hi>ſcarce</hi> a plant in <hi>human</hi> hearts? but that MAN
is a FALLEN creature. Lions have it, dogs have it, in a
high degree; even the feathered tribe have it; ſome of the
wildeſt of them. The worthy woman above named, as
having ſerved the Editor above twenty years, is, as well as
her old fellow ſervant, Mr. Wrightſon, wonderfully tender
and kind to the brute creation; the Editor's Cook <note n="*" place="bottom">So much ſo, as to have occaſioned the Houſekeeper one day telling the Editor, that Mr. Wrightſon and herſelf had at length extorted a promiſe from the Cook, that when ſhe married ſhe would <hi>not</hi> keep a cat, as they were ſure ſhe would ſtarve it to death. The worthy woman married from Dr. Berkeley's, and her cat and ſelf are both <hi>en bon point</hi> now living at Cookham.</note> rather
negligent of them, the houſekeeper amuſed herſelf with feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a parcel of Guinea fowls, in general very wild birds. Theſe
creatures, although never fed but once a day, uſed to run
flocking around her every time ſhe went into the meadows
<pb n="cclxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:274"/>
where they wandered; and more than one Sunday it was
with conſiderable difficulty that ſhe got into the church
without near forty of her feathered friends eſcorting her.
She had reared near thirty of them, difficult as the taſk is,
the hens being very bad nurſes. They well knew the hour
of feeding was paſt. It was <hi>gratitude;</hi> ſhame to human
nature! which the famous Dr. Cheyne uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"was
<hi>without</hi> GOD'S GRACE, a compound of Brute and Devil;"</q>
but theſe poor quadrupeds and winged fowl have not God's
grace, and yet <hi>they</hi> ſhame mankind.</p>
               <p>The incomparable Mrs. Tucker is not held up here as a
grateful perſon in contraſt to the PUBLICATOR; for <hi>ſhe owed</hi>
no gratitude either to Dr. or to Mrs. Berkeley, unleſs it was for
uniting with the <hi>whole</hi> church, city, and neighbourhood,
in admiration of the angelic manner in which ſhe treated
and attended to the bodies and ſouls of Mr. Tucker's
houſe full of young gentlemen boarders, aided by her ſedate,
wiſe, excellent, <hi>eldeſt</hi> daughter, her beautiful lovely ſecond
daughter, then too young for any thing but to be univerſally
admired and beloved, which ſhe continues to be in an eminent
degree by all who have the pleaſure of knowing her; and
what is above all, by her throughly polite accompliſhed
huſband, Mr. Symonds, a gentleman of large fortune in
Leiceſterſhire. Long may ſhe be ſpared to him and his
children.</p>

The Editor regrets that ſhe has treſpaſſed ſo long on the
patience of the Reader. Having delivered her ſentiments
freely on Gratitude and Ingratitude, it would be unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
in her to cloſe this long Preface, without acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the great obligations ſhe feels that ſhe lies under
to ſeveral amiable friends of her excellent Son, and of her
unworthy ſelf, not for any the ſmalleſt aſſiſtance in ſcrawling
theſe undigeſted immethodical pages. It would be injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
it would be more, it would be cruelty, to let it be
ſuſpected, that any literary friend, learned male or culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
female, had the ſmalleſt ſhare in this poor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
The Editor is at preſent too far removed from
the preſs; and, franking being, alas! almoſt annihilated, ſhe
has not had it in her power even to conſult a friend capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of directing or adviſing her, one only excepted, who
was <hi>too tenderly</hi> affected at hearing half a dozen lines <hi>redde,</hi>
however excellently qualified to direct, adviſe, or correct
any <hi>hobbling</hi> ſentence.</p>
               <p>The Editor's Son uſed often to regret that his Mother
would not write Poetry, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"he was very ſure ſhe
<hi>could</hi> if ſhe <hi>would,</hi>"</q> as did a poetical friend of her youth,
whoſe name often appears in Dodſley's Collection of Poems.
Had either lived to ſee how lamentably ſhe acquits herſelf
in Proſe, it had ſaved her ſome perſecution. Both were
more angry at her repeated declarations that ſhe did not
love Poetry, very rarely redde it, excepting Dr. Young's
<pb n="cclxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:276"/>
Night Thoughts and ſome parts of Milton, &amp;c. The poetry
of De la Cruſca muſt charm a ſavage.</p>
               <p>In Mr. Monck Berkeley's benevolent vindication, in the
Author's Preface to the Poems, he exhorts people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that the Reviewers are but MEN. If thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
condeſcend to review a few pages written by a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine
pen, the Editor wiſhes them to remember, that
ſhe is a <hi>Woman,</hi> a ſuffering OLD <hi>Woman,</hi> with moſt of the
accompliſhments at threeſcore that moſt females have at
<q rend="inline">"the age of man,"</q> ten years later—that ſhe ſerved an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeſhip
to <hi>extreme</hi> anxiety and anguiſh for very near
ſeven years—ſeeing daily the declining ſtate of health of
the two neareſt and deareſt connections in life, obliged to
<hi>affect</hi> eaſe, and often cheerfulneſs, whilſt her heart bled at
every vein. Unfortunately for her, both Father and Son,
through their lives, declared, that if the Editor's conſtant,
even cheerfulneſs, never high, never low, failed, both
would give themſelves up to abſolute deſpair. The ſtrong
exertions neceſſary to act the part to <hi>their</hi> ſatisfaction
have certainly brought on a premature old age; and the
Editor, according to the witty, wiſe, pious, Biſhop
Taylor, <q rend="inline">"is quite ready-dreſſed for the grave,"</q> whither
ſhe ſeems haſting apace. The Biſhop, in his "Holy
Dying," ſays, <q rend="inline">"dim eyes, gray hairs, ſtiff joints,"</q> &amp;c.
&amp;c. are all ſo many <q rend="inline">"<hi>dreſſings</hi> for the grave."</q> He does
not add dulled faculties; <hi>I</hi> am ſure he might, although
<pb n="cclxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:277"/>
perhaps, HE might not feel it; his own wit being <hi>too well</hi>
tempered to have the keenneſs of its edge blunted by aught
but death itſelf. That is the lot of but very few. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the great Mr. Burke may eſcape it, who yet, ten
years ago, complained of his tongue and his fingers. They
have, however, enabled him to hold his pen to beſtow
<hi>heavy,</hi> although <hi>very juſt,</hi> chaſtiſement where it was meet
and right to do it. Long may he wield it, a terror, one
ſhould hope, to <q rend="inline">"all who offend through MALICIOUS
WICKEDNESS,"</q> to whom the Pſalmiſt, ſpeaking by the
Holy Spirit, beſeeches God the Father NOT to be merciful.</p>
               <p>To attempt doing juſtice to the goodneſs of Friends
(ſome now no longer inhabitants of earth), to Mr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's,
or to his Parent's gratitude, would require a ream of
paper, now, like moſt other things, become a very dear
commodity. Through the courſe of this work, written by
haſty ſnatches, ſometimes laid by for many months un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched,
ſo as to have occaſioned much diſagreeable tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
the copy was never tranſcribed; ſo that it was ſent
rough to the preſs; and much gratitude is due to the
Printer, for his patience in decyphering all the interlinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in it, without the aid of the worthy Sir Francis Willes—the ſame perſon and the ſame action brought twice on
the <hi>tapis</hi> when once would have done—but much fault has
been found with the author of "Anecdotes of the two laſt
and preſent Centuries," for not relating every thing at
<pb n="cclxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:278"/>
the ſame time of many of the perſonages; perhaps they
might not come to the author's knowledge until the firſt
part was printed off, as many things have occurred to the
now treacherous memory of the Editor after it was too late
to inſert them in their proper place. She has therefore
taken leave to inſert them in a leſs proper one; for which
ſhe thinks ſhe ought rather to beg her own pardon for being
ſuch a fool as to inſert the mat all, than the Reader's,
for inſerting, perhaps at page 7, what, if method had been
attended to, ought to have been placed at page 2.</p>
               <p>The amiable, generous kindneſs of Mr. Monck Berkeley's
relations at Eton, the Reverend John Hayes, now eldeſt
ſon of James Hayes, Eſquire, of Holyport, and the laborious
endeavours of his brother Charles, both ſeveral years older
than Mr. Berkeley, of courſe being excellent ſcholars, much
higher in the ſchool, to <hi>make</hi> his little kinſman as ſtudious
as himſelf, have been noticed above, as alſo the partiality
of his beloved reſpected tutor, the learned Dr. Norbury,
and the kindneſs of Dr. Langford whilſt in the lower ſchool,
who yet once offended him moſt highly.</p>
               <p>Dr. Berkeley finding fault one holyday that he was not

Berkeley exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Good God, child, how could you
be ſuch a fool?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"I cannot help it, Sir, I was angry,
and <hi>I made a vow,</hi> and <hi>I reſolved</hi> to keep it, come what

ſteady as a rock.—Later in life he made a more important
<pb n="cclxviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:280"/>
vow. One night at Brooks's he and his learned beloved
Eton St. Andrew's friend, the learned T. Hobhouſe,
Eſquire, were drawn in to play deeper than Mr. Berkeley,
at leaſt, ought to have done. The amiable, worthy Mr.
Hobhouſe has a very good maternal eſtate. Mr. Berkeley,
as is uſual, won a frightfully large ſum, ſoon loſt it again,
and all the money in his purſe, and much more than he
had at his chambers to pay it. Very providentially Mrs.
Frinſham happened to be in town. Early the next morning
he poſted off to Duke Street. Mrs. Frinſham, ſomewhat
ſurprized at hearing from her ſervant that Mr. Berkeley was
come before nine o'clock, went out to him; the caſe was
related, and that generous friend inſtantly enabled him to
diſcharge his <hi>firſt,</hi> his <hi>laſt, gaming</hi> debt; telling him,
<q rend="inline">"that ſhe never felt ſuch pleaſure ariſing from having
money at command."</q> She has, in her youth, often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
ſo very largely, as to deny herſelf for months the
elegant neceſſaries of young ladies, to accommodate a
particular friend, or an old acquaintance. Mr. Berkeley
going down ſoon after to his father's, on the evening of
his arrival, aſked his Mother, <q rend="inline">"If ſhe had heard what a
<hi>fool</hi> her ſon had been;"</q> to which ſhe replying, <q rend="inline">"That
ſhe did not recollect having ever heard him called a fool
by any one, but his <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> now and then;"</q>
he related the above-mentioned circumſtance, adding,
<q rend="inline">"My dear Mother, you may ſet <hi>your heart at reſt</hi> from any
fear of your Son's ever becoming a gameſter; <hi>for, as ſoon</hi>

God to caſt out my prayer if EVER I again played
for any ſum more than I could well afford to loſe, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now and then with one's neighbours in the country
on a winter evening."</q> It has, I believe, been mentioned
above, that Mr. Berkeley, whenever he did play, which
was very ſeldom, and a very indifferent whiſt-player he
was, almoſt conſtantly won.—All his winnings went to
relieve the poor.</p>
               <p>But to return: Dr. Berkeley told his ſon that Dr.
L<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap> acted highly right, and that he ſhould have
eſteemed it rather a compliment than a puniſhment. To
which he replied, <q rend="inline">"No, NO, Sir, not if you had ever been
at ſchool, and knew <hi>what</hi> it was to loſe a place. He
ſaid aloud, 'That mine was by much the beſt exerciſe;'
and he <hi>ought,</hi> therefore, in <hi>juſtice,</hi> to have given <hi>me</hi>
the place."</q> Mr. Berkeley was then a child: he thought
differently of the matter a few years afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley certainly did not inherit his wonderful
daring reſoluteneſs either from his amiable Father, or from
his Mother; but, probably, as well as his fine figure, from
his Mother's father, whom the Editor has frequently heard
relate the following fact concerning himſelf: <q rend="inline">"Mr. Frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham
loſt his beautiful mother at twenty-four, juſt when
he was five years old."</q> (His father lived a widower
<pb n="cclxx" facs="tcp:0761700600:282"/>
near fifty years). Some time before her death, the
ſervant went into the room where they were at breakfaſt,
ſaying, that <q rend="inline">"Maſter would not eat his meſs for breakfaſt,
but wanted coffee, <hi>like</hi> his Mamma."</q>—Up ſprang his Father,
ſaying, <q rend="inline">"<hi>I will give him coffee!</hi>"</q> went and gave him a good
whipping—ſtill the meſs was refuſed—a ſecond whipping,
with no better ſucceſs—at length a third, when his mother
called out, <q rend="inline">"Mr. Frinſham, let him alone, if he won't eat
it now, he will eat it when he is hungry, don't whip him
any more."</q>—<q rend="inline">"I will whip him till <hi>to-morrow morning</hi> if
he does not eat it before."</q> The Editor has frequently
heard her father ſay, <q rend="inline">"that he had reſolved to endure ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight flagellations;"</q> but the declaration, <q rend="inline">"that
they ſhould be continued until the next morning"</q>
determined him to eat it immediately, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
did, always obſerving, how wiſe it was to
break children of ſtubbornneſs in their infancy. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
eradicated it in Mr. Frinſham; for a ſweeter tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
child never lived, as the Editor has frequently heard
a worthy woman declare, who went to keep his father's
houſe, on the death of his Mother—ſhe lived to near
ninety, and always made an annual viſit at Mr. and after
his death at Mrs. Frinſham's—that <q rend="inline">"he was the moſt amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of children, and of youths."</q> When Mr. Frinſham
ſent his ſons to Oxford, this careful ſervant went to take
care of another, and a third ſet of poor motherleſs children;
by which means, and the little bounties of her adopted
<pb n="cclxxi" facs="tcp:0761700600:283"/>
children, ſhe obtained ſufficient to maintain her more than
decently, genteely. She was ever a parlour gueſt in all
the gentlemen's families whom ſhe had brought up. She
had by her father, in very early youth, been married to a
gentleman who deſerted her, and went to live abroad; ſhe
was therefore a <hi>ſafe</hi> houſekeeper for young widowers. Her
firſt ſervice was Mr. Frinſham's Father's. The Editor has
frequently, ſince ſhe grew up, heard her ſay, <q rend="inline">"that her
mother, going to viſit her ſoon after ſhe went thither,
addreſſed her thus: 'My dear child, this is a very heavy
charge that you have taken upon yourſelf. If you do not
take the utmoſt care, the <hi>ſame</hi> care of theſe beautiful
little children (Mr. Frinſham's younger brother was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
handſome man), never expect my bleſſing, but
my curſe ſhall ſurely light upon you."</q> Poor Mrs. Grove
uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"I felt horror at the thoughts of my mother's
curſe."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was mentioned above, that a deſperate ague obliged
Mrs. Berkeley to reſign the taſk of nurſing her ſon to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The perſon who a few years before had nurſed
Charles Hayes, Eſquire, now Fellow of King's College,
was by his dear tenderly beloved mother, of whoſe amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſweetneſs to the rich, and godlike charity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
to <hi>all</hi> the ſurrounding poor, the Editor often
thinks, ſometimes talks, with extatic delight, when ſhe
reflects, that ſhe is gone to Him who inſpired, and is
<pb n="cclxxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:284"/>
                  <hi>now</hi> rewarding thoſe lovely tempers. May her ſons,
when they <hi>venture</hi> to marry, meet with ladies as amiable,
as worthy, as their lovely mother; as ſenſible as their
great grand-mother, not famed for ſweet temper, the
Editor's great aunt, eldeſt daughter of William Cherry,
Eſquire, as a reward for their kind care of their little kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
at Eton.—The Editor ſays, <q rend="inline">"<hi>venture;</hi>"</q> marriage was
always a lottery, <hi>never</hi> reſembling Mr. Pitt's—<q rend="inline">"<hi>not two

two hundred WORSE than BLANKS. How can <hi>ill</hi> educated
girls make <hi>good</hi> wives? But men muſt thank their <hi>own</hi>
folly.—This lady was as beautiful as ſhe was lovely, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
reſembling a very fine original picture of Anne
Boleyn, in the collection of an hereditary friend of the
Editor's, the late James Warren, Eſquire, great uncle of
the brave worthy Sir John Borlaſe Warren<note n="*" place="bottom">This brave excellent officer ſome few years ago met with, it is hoped, a ſingular inſtance of ingratitude. That more than nineteen out of twenty voters at Great Marlow, Bucks, know A from B, is owing to the noble charity ſchool, founded by the anceſtors of Sir John Borlaſe Warren, who reſided at his feat at Little Marlow, and laid out much money with them; and a very few years ago, theſe worſe than <hi>ſea</hi> monſters ouſted him of his ſeat in parliament for Marlow.

               <p>Judge Hayes uſed frequently to ſay, <q rend="inline">"that his ſon Charles

Berkeley were very generous to her when they grew up.
Mr. Hayes always admired the wonderful genius of Mr.
Berkeley, who ſometimes paſſed the ſhort holydays of
Whitſuntide at Holyport, with his kind kinſmen. The Judge
one day exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Well, I never ſaw ſuch a creature in
my life as Berkeley. I am perſuaded, that if I were
to ſay I am in diſtreſs how to get five hundred pounds
conveyed to the Lord Mayor of York, Berkeley would

go and carry it for you;' not feeling any impropriety at
the idea of a boy, of juſt then thirteen, being ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed;

Mr. Berkeley ever retained a grateful ſenſe of kind invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
from friends at Windſor—the late Lady Colerance;
his Mother's near relation, the amiable excellent Mrs.
Cheſſyre; the Lady of his Mother's old <hi>very intimate</hi> friend,
the late agreeable Dr. Boſtock, Canon of Windſor; and
his relation good Mrs. Hayes, and the very worthy Mr.
Trevanian.</p>
               <p>Any attempt to enumerate and deſcant on, as they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
the innumerable, amiable, reſpectful attentions paid to
Mr. Berkeley, even by ſtrangers, to every thing but his
name and connections in the Land of kind Hoſpitality,
would fill almoſt as many pages as the learned accompliſhed
Mr. Malone has filled in defending his favourite, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Shakſpeare. Had Mr. Monck Berkeley been living,
it had doubtleſs rouſed the ire of that young Poet; but
Mr. Malone needs no coadjutor in any buſineſs that worthy
gentleman takes in hand.</p>
               <p>The Antiquarian Society of Edinburgh did Mr. Berkeley
the honour to elect him a member, when he was only
nineteen years old, an honour perhaps never before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
on one ſo very young, on his ſending them a moſt
excellent account of a very curious quarry in the heart of
the Highlands. Mr. Berkeley had the honour to have the
freedom of Aberdeen, and ſome other cities, and of many
<pb n="cclxxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:287"/>
towns, preſented to him. He conſtantly delivered them
to his Mother, requeſting her to take great care of
them.</p>
               <p>How would Mr. Berkeley's ſpirit have been rouſed, had
he lived to hear the <note n="*" place="bottom">The throughly brave are never cruel. There are few who have not heard the bravery of Lord Balcarras at Saratoga, under General Burgoyne.

               <p>To the introduction of his friend, Mr. Lennard, Mr.

friendſhip with the excellent Sir J. Clarke of Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Cuicke,
and his charming Lady, daughter of Mr. Dacre of
the North, to whom Mr. Lennard was related. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
their amiable virtues, and revered their goodneſs.
And invitation, whenever he was in Edinburgh, and had no

was impoſſible ſhould ever be obliterated from the memory

and Mr. Monck Berkeley, on their firſt arrival in Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,
to whom they were introduced by the worthy he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
friends of Mrs. Berkeley, Mrs. Edlins, daughters of
the excellent Baron Edlin, whoſe pious Lady and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
remarkably bountiful to the poor, are ſtill the ſubject

with unfeigned gratitude and delight. Happy the poor
who reſide near the few ſtill ſurviving ladies of that worthy
family.</p>
               <p>When at St. Andrew's in Scotland, Mr. Monck Berkeley
uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"Well, it is a mercy that I am not <hi>quite ſo
much</hi> in love with Lady Elizabeth Lindſey as my Mother
is. If I was, I muſt run away with her; not, as <hi>we</hi> ſay, to

of that lovely Lady, are doubtleſs the ſource of much
domeſtic felicity to her Lord. Her Ladyſhip is, the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
verily believes, or nothing ſhould cauſe her to write it,
one of the <hi>very</hi> few <hi>genuine</hi> gentle ſpirits ſcattered here and
there to be admired, and (alas! for poor unlucky ſimple
men) to be <hi>counterfeited.</hi> Dr. Berkeley uſed always to ſay,
there was nothing he diſliked ſo much as <q rend="inline">"<hi>a mighty pretty
ſort of young woman.</hi>"</q> Mrs. Berkeley uſed to reply, <q rend="inline">"that
<pb n="cclxxviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:290"/>
ſhe hoped nobody would ever ſtyle her ſuch, when
<hi>he</hi> was preſent."</q> He uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"that he deteſted
inſipidity."</q> Such as ſhe was, he had her <q rend="inline">"<hi>for better
for worſe</hi>"</q> thirty-four years. One of thoſe horrid horſe
leeches, ever draining her too too generous huſband,
having ſince his death told her, at her lawyer's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<q rend="inline">"That Dr. Berkeley married <hi>her</hi> for her money."</q>
Wonderful aſſertion! as Mrs. Berkeley's fortune was only
a few odd thouſands; and when he was urged to take a
lady, much in love with him, who had <hi>more</hi> than a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand pounds. The Editor feels herſelf obliged,
after this WONDERFUL aſſertion from a low-lived Divine,
who, educated by John Weſley, perhaps never <hi>ſaw</hi> any
Univerſity until at Dr. Berkeley's expence, to ſay, that
Dr. Berkeley has repeatedly declared to his ſon, in
her preſence, <q rend="inline">"Have not I told you, over and over, that
had I been Duke of Norfolk, or Robinſon Cruſoe, your
Mother is the woman in the whole world that I would
have choſen for a wife;"</q> adding what it is impoſſible for
the Editor to write; <q rend="inline">"* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * and ſhe could and would make
matters comfortable, pleaſant on that iſland;"</q> adding, <q rend="inline">"I
have always told you, I believe your Mother has the beſt
temper to live with for happineſs of any perſon in the
world."</q> Not many weeks before his lamented death he
ſaid to ſeveral perſons, friends, and ſervants, <q rend="inline">"She is the
<pb n="cclxxix" facs="tcp:0761700600:291"/>
beſt wife in the world."</q> God knows that ſhe feels, ever
did feel, how far ſhe fell ſhort, in moſt relations of life, of
the reſolutions ſhe made very early in life, to labour, if
ever ſhe did marry, to make the beſt wife in the world,
and, if God <hi>bleſſed</hi> her with children, the beſt mother.
Alas! ſhe repeats it, ſhe <hi>feels,</hi> that ſhe fell ſhort; and yet,
ſuch is the frailty of our fallen nature, that, were the time
to be gone over again, ſhe fears ſhe could not much mend
her hand. As miſtreſs of a family, ſhe, from early youth,
reſolved to treat her ſervants juſt as ſhe would wiſh them
to treat her, were they inſtantly to exchange ſtations. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
this has ſometimes gone rather too far. A beloved
friend of her's, nicknamed by the Editor in her youth, the
Centurioneſs, <q rend="inline">"<hi>I ſay to my ſervant do this, and he doth it,</hi>"</q>
frequently told the Editor, ſhe was a moſt incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
governeſs of her children, and of dogs and cats; but
that her ſervants did, or did <hi>not</hi> obey her orders, <hi>juſt</hi> as it
ſuited their own convenience; adding, <q rend="inline">"I think they are
mighty good kind of people to do any thing; you aſk them
ſo quietly, Pray now <hi>will</hi> you do ſo?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Editor, as above ſhewn, with her children did not
deal in ſhewing authority; with ſervants as well as children,
when ſhe ſet about any thing in good earneſt, calmly ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<q rend="inline">"<hi>I will have this or that done.</hi>"</q> She has ever, with
both, found that <hi>her</hi> word was a law. Servants are much
to be pitied; they have often jobs to finiſh as well as their
<pb n="cclxxx" facs="tcp:0761700600:292"/>
ſuperiors; it is grievous to a generous mind to drag them
away when half an hour later may do juſt as well. The
Editor, perhaps, is weak, ill-judging, in that, as in many
other things. She had been married more than ſeven
years, when her amiable Partner, a little warm, as the

worthy man was ſometimes a little ſlow in his motions;
his maſter was very quick in his. His ſurname was Hyde.
He was related, and as many gentlemen learned in the
law ſuppoſed, heir to a vaſt unclaimed property in the
funds, left by a General Hyde, who died in the reign of
George the Firſt. If it were duly conſidered by maſters and
miſtreſſes of families, that they and their domeſtics muſt
one day, ere long, ſtand <hi>together,</hi> at the ſame RIGHTEOUS
bar, they would ſurely prepare to anſwer, when aſked, if
they had taken care to inſtruct them in their duty to their
Maſter in Heaven, or ſpent the time that might have been
ſo employed, in reproaching them for neglecting their duty
to their Maſter on earth. Theſe governors of families

The very fine prayer for thoſe under ſentence of death might, being redde by the children of the poor, at leaſt keep them from the gallows. A few years ago a fine youth at one of the great ſchools was ſo charmed with it, that he requeſted the Iriſh youth where it was, to exchange with him for a very ſuperb Engliſh Common Prayer Book. His father was a pious, although very eminent Barriſter.

                     <note n="†" place="bottom">See the Firſt Book of Samuel.</note>."</q> This was
effected by that brave excellent officer, General Rooke, who
kindly, amiably offered the very old friend of the Editor,
the ſenſible, pious T. Hughes, Eſquire, when a few years
ago high ſheriff for Gloceſterſhire, to riſe at four in the
morning, in March, to accompany him on his dreary jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of ſixteen miles to attend the execution. He felt the
unpleaſant dreary journey Mr. Hughes muſt have, and
amiably offered to accompany him. His ſweet nature was
ſhocked, on their arrival at Gloſter, at ſeeing the poor
wretch quite hardened, that he begged Mr. Hughes's
permiſſion to talk to the poor creature a little; to which
the pious, amiable Mr. Hughes, who related the happy
tale to Dr. Berkeley, and repeatedly to the Editor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled,

                  <q rend="inline">"My permiſſion, dear Sir, aye, and my beſt

and the bleſſed General, to whom the Editor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets
that ſhe has not the honour, the happineſs to be
known, ſucceeded, ſo effectually ſucceeded, that a poor

of the Jury, as the High Sheriff told Dr. Berkeley; for
he had conſtantly denied the murder, and, the man being
not robbed, they were uneaſy at having found him guilty.
The preceding and ſucceeding context might be here with
propriety inſerted; they may be ſought, and the whole
chapter redde with advantage by thoſe who have never
murdered a man. The Editor, however, feels herſelf
obliged to vindicate herſelf from the <hi>bare</hi> ſuſpicion of
Antinomianiſm by quoting No. XLIV. of "The Deep
Things of God." Though a child of God glories in
this, that <q rend="inline">"<hi>where ſin hath abounded, grace doth much more

               </p>
               <p>On this one of the ſelected numbers being redde to Mr.
Monck Berkeley by his Mother, he exclaimed, with an
earneſtneſs hardly to be deſcribed, <q rend="inline">"God forbid! Oh!
<pb n="cclxxxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:296"/>
God forbid!!!"</q> It was mentioned before, that the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
conſtantly, on quitting her Son's chamber, wrote un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
every number his comments, ejaculations, &amp;c. upon it.
She moſt carefully ſelected what ſhe felt ſuited the <hi>then</hi>
ſtate of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley did not want inſtruction in his duty to God
or his neighbour. He did not want to be awakened, to be
ſhewn how direfully he had broken the <q rend="inline">"Holy Law of
God,"</q> nor to be made ſenſible of the penalty to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
for ſuch breach; but to be convinced that Chriſt
had received him, which his deep humility prevented
him from believing, although the <hi>hope</hi> of it was his <hi>ſole</hi>
ſupport.</p>
               <p>One night, when he ſuppoſed himſelf expiring at Dover,
Mr. Berkeley deſired his friend, Mrs. Frinſham, might be
called out of bed to him: he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I beſeech you to pray
for me. You ſee me going, perhaps from miſery here
to everlaſting miſery;"</q> adding, <q rend="inline">"I yet feel ſome hope,
that God hears my Mother's prayers, and that Chriſt
will not quite caſt me off."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It ought to have been mentioned in its proper place,
that Mr. Berkeley wrote to his Mother from Oxford, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
her to ſummon all her <hi>fortitude</hi> to her aid, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
her mind not to be ſhocked at ſeeing the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of
<pb n="cclxxxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:297"/>
what was <hi>once</hi> her Son. The original idea was, that of
Mr. Berkeley's going to Glouceſter to be conſtantly under
the eye of Dr. Cheſtern. He therefore wrote, requeſting
his friends to meet him on the road; accordingly, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
the poſt arrived, they, accompanied by their incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
friend, Mrs. D. Monck, ſet out and reached the
inn at Burford about five in the afternoon, and about
ſeven Mr. Berkeley arrived, attended by his own ſervant,
and a youth of about eighteen, the ſon of an old Iriſh
friend of Dr. Berkeley's, then ſtaying with Dr. Berkeley,
who had been diſpatched to meet Mr. Berkeley, who had
done amiably, as he ever did, to warn his Mother not to
be ſhocked, &amp;c. It required ALL her fortitude to ſee her
idol with difficulty get out of the chaiſe, and enter the
room, ſupported, rather <hi>difficultly</hi> ſupported, by his ſervant,
a man about his own ſtature.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Berkeley had gone to town to viſit her Son, and
dear, excellent Mr. Grimſton, whoſe goodneſs cauſed his
remaining in town all the ſummer with Mr. Berkeley, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Auguſt, when they ſet off for Haſtings. Five months
of almoſt unabated torture had wonderfully weakened Mr.
Berkeley's <q rend="inline">"<hi>earthly tabernacle.</hi>"</q> Dr. Berkeley's great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
apologized for his appearing diſpirited; and Mrs.
Berkeley forced herſelf to appear not to feel ſupreme an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of mind at the ſight of her IDOL thus debilitated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="cclxxxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:298"/>
Dr. Berkeley, riſing about ten o'clock, ſaid to his
Son, <q rend="inline">"My dear child, I am ſo weak, and ſo wearied,
that I muſt wiſh you a good night; I am quite unable
to ſit up any longer."</q> Mr. Berkeley, begging his
Father's benediction, wiſhed him a good night, as he did
his excellent friend Mrs. Monck. On his Mother's going
to ſhake hands with him and retire, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Beſt of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
you have not been ill, like my poor Father: <hi>you
can</hi> ſit up, and I greatly want a little converſation with
you."</q> The above mentioned youth was of courſe making
his bow, when Mr. Berkeley ſaid, <q rend="inline">"You need not retire,
Sir; <hi>I rather wiſh you to ſtay;</hi>"</q> when Mr. Berkeley thus
commenced, <q rend="inline">"I am probably now not far from the end of
my courſe; and I wiſh to ſay ſome things to my dear
Mother; to bleſs her for having forced me to be regular
and conſtant in my attendance at public worſhip and at
family prayer, long before I felt or ſaw the neceſſity of
it myſelf, I am convinced, well convinced, that it is the
<hi>only</hi> way to train up a child, and, as my Mother, has
quoted a thouſand times to us, (taking in his little bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,)
ſo convinced am I of it, that, of which there is
very little probability now, ſhould I live ever to have a
family of children, or ſervants, I will force them to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
I will drive them before me to the houſe of God,
and to family prayers."</q> The young man ſtared to hear
the energy with which Mr. Berkeley uttered this ſentence;
<pb n="cclxxxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:299"/>
he turned round, and, looking ſtedfaſtly at him, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Yes,
Sir, ſo convinced am I of the wiſdom of it, that if I
could get them no other way, I would <hi>kick</hi> them before
me, (driving out his foot with amazing ſtrength;) it is
the <hi>only</hi> way to make them wiſe unto ſalvation in their
youth."</q>

The village there deſcribed, is the beautiful village of Witeringham in Northumberland, of which the agreeable worthy Mr. Twentyman was many years curate. Mr. Monck Berkeley, one day ſpeaking with extacy of the wit contained in Fielding's writings; his Mother ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Hold your tongue.

               <p>Mrs. Berkeley quoted many gracious promiſes from Holy

friend, Sir Richard Hill, by his incomparable book<note n="*" place="bottom">The Editor conceived that ſhe had before mentioned Mr. Berkeley's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in a little book of Sir Richard Hill's, intituled, "A Preſent for your Neighbour;" without which he had never travelled for ſeveral years before his death, always taking it in his trunk; but, not finding it on carefully reading over the printed ſheets, ſhe mentions it here. Returning early one day from hunting, and it happening to rain, he entered the houſe through the ſervants' hall, where this little book lay open in the window. The title caught his quick eye. The ſervants all diſperſed to their different occupations. He took it up, and went to his room. Some time after he came into the Editor's dreſſing-room, holding a little book in his hand, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Pray, my dear Madam, how came you not to give your Son one of theſe books, as well as your houſe-maid?"</q> The Editor anſwered in the ſame way, <q rend="inline">"Why, my dear Sir, becauſe I did not think that my <hi>Son</hi> wanted it."</q>—<q rend="inline">"You were much miſtaken: <hi>he</hi> wants it very much; and <hi>I deſire</hi> you will be pleaſed to give him one directly,"</q> nodding to that end of the large book-caſe where he knew the books for the poor were kept. Mrs. Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"Indeed, I cannot; for I gave away the laſt three days ago."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Very well, my dear Mother, I am ſure you will get a freight down ſoon, for I am certain you won't be <hi>long</hi> without <hi>ſuch</hi> books as this; ſo I ſhall keep this in <hi>pawn</hi> till you redeem it. I know you are a very honeſt lady, and won't cheat your houſe-maid."</q> Mr. Berkeley uſed to divert his Father, by ſaying, <q rend="inline">"I believe my Mother is the honeſteſt woman living, where my Aunt and I are not concerned (being in haſte to pay every one elſe) if ſhe borrows of us, it ſeems to ſit <hi>quite eaſy</hi> on her <hi>conſcience.</hi> She certainly thinks it no fin to cheat us of a guinea now and then."</q>
                  </note> above
named, to pour the balm of perfect peace—that peace of
God which paſſeth ALL underſtanding—into the dear,
humble, contrite, troubled ſpirit of her unſpeakably dear
Son—that peace for which the generality pray at leaſt
once a week, but which ſo very few labour to obtain; when
obtained, they feel that <q rend="inline">"the yoke of Chriſt is eaſy, and

It was near two o'clock in the morning, before Mr.
Berkeley, apologizing to his Mother, told her that he would
detain her no longer, fearing that the want of a good night's
reſt might injure her health. Mr. Berkeley always knew
that the loſs of ſleep is almoſt death to his Mother, whoſe
Mother and Siſter could, and the dear ſurvivor can, paſs
weeks in health, with ſcarce any ſleep at all. Mrs. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
in that, as in other things, reſembles her Father.—When
young, her Mother uſed to tell the Editor, that
ſhe thought ſhe <hi>could</hi> not be <hi>her</hi> child, becauſe ſhe uſed
to wiſh to leave a ball-room at four o'clock—her Mother
telling her often that ſhe uſed to ſtay till <hi>eight,</hi> then drive
home ſeveral miles, exchange her ball-dreſs for her morning
one, and not go to reſt till twelve next night, or rather
morning; for her mother, Mrs. Cherry, never retired to
her chamber till twelve, and conſtantly roſe, winter and
ſummer, at ſix, until within two years of her death, at
ſixty-eight, when ſhe roſe not until ſeven o'clock. It was
little likely that Mrs. Berkeley ſhould enjoy much ſleep
after ſo intereſting a converſation of four hours.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Berkeley is ſaid, by all thoſe who have known her
moſt intimately from her childhood, to be of the moſt
hopeful temper they ever knew: ſhe preſerves with tendereſt
care a hair ring given by her dear Son; an elegant figure of
Hope leaning on her anchor, one hand pointing up to
<pb n="ccxci" facs="tcp:0761700600:303"/>
heaven, with this motto in hair, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Heaven's beſt gift to
man.</hi>"</q> It is very certain, that until ſhe ſaw her Son the
day after his happy ſpirit had quitted his fine form ſhe
did flatter herſelf, that the mercy of God would ſpare him
to her; under the idea of having laboured from her youth
to obey, oblige, delight her own excellent Mother, in
order to make her feel leſs poignantly the loſs of an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
adoring huſband, that God would vouchſafe to reward
her in KIND, and ſpare her Son. But, alas! her Son was
her idol; and idols muſt be given up. The Editor was
ſuppoſed to be idolized by <hi>her</hi> Mother, of whom it uſed
to be ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Mrs. Frinſham loves her ſo much, that ſhe
never lets her walk acroſs the room without looking at
her (little inſignificant figure) with pleaſure in her eyes."</q>
That delight muſt have ariſen from thinking ſhe bore ſome
reſemblance to her excellent Father. The Editor has the
pleaſure to reflect that there was nothing ſhe would not
have ſacrificed to pleaſe the beſt of Mothers, and that ſhe
always prayed to God that he would be pleaſed to ſpare her
life, if it were only for <hi>one week</hi> beyond her Mother's, that ſhe
might be ſpared the affliction of ſeeing her go before her. The
Editor felt that ſhe was the cauſe of much ſad anxiety to her
Mother, not having had the ſmall pox, as her excellent ſiſter
had when a child, at Mrs. Sheeles's ſchool, and its being la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably
fatal in Mrs. Frinſham's family, her eldeſt ſiſter
being one Saturday eſteemed the moſt beautiful creature in
<pb n="ccxcii" facs="tcp:0761700600:304"/>
London<note n="*" place="bottom">The beaux of that day beſtowed the following ſubriques on the three co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heireſſes of Mr. Cherry, all beauties. The eldeſt above mentioned, the Duke Cherry, fit for a Duke; the ſecond, the fine Black Cherry, from her dark hair, her complexion lovely; the third, Mrs. Frinſham, the fineſt figure of the three, was termed the Heart Cherry. She proved her right to that pleaſing ſubrique, by rejecting, for the ſake of the Editor's father with a ſmall fortune, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common worth, numbers of brilliant ſplendid matches. Her ideas on that head deſcended to her daughter and her grandſon. It is a little remarkable that there was a very ſtrong reſemblance in the faces of Dr. Berkeley and Mrs. Frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham, ſo as to ſtrike Dr. Berkeley himſelf the firſt time he ſaw her pictures. Neither of her daughters reſembled her in the ſmalleſt degree, either in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely fine tall figure, which uſed to occaſion her being followed in the Park, Mall, &amp;c. where young ladies exhibited in thoſe days, and which ſhe retained to the laſt, as well as her fine red and white, and the exquiſite ſweetneſs of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, the diſtinguiſhing temper of her ſoul, as well as of the Editor's angelic delightful friend, the late Mrs. Catharine Talbot, of Lambeth Palace. Theſe two lovely ladies' pictures hung near each other in Dr. Berkeley's eating-room. It is probable ſuch kindred ſpirits are united in the realms of bliſs.</note>, and the next the moſt deplorable object, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
all over, and much blacker than an Ethiop. In the
latter part the Editor has no doubt but ſhe had reſembled her
lovely Aunt, had ſhe not been inoculated by Mr. Sutton
himſelf, who attended her at her own houſe at Acton,
with great aſſiduity, Dr. Berkeley being then rector of
that pariſh. They were ſenſible of the bleſſing of ſuch a
Preacher. Multitudes came every Sunday to Acton church,
to hear one who, according to St. Paul, did not, as, he
obſerved to the Editor in his laſt illneſs, <q rend="inline">"preach himſelf,
BUT CHRIST JESUS THE LORD;"</q> adding, <q rend="inline">"HE knows I
<pb n="ccxciii" facs="tcp:0761700600:305"/>
preached him in SINCERITY, always dreading to be a
popular preacher, a pleaſer of the people."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The following obſervations are intended ſolely to benefit
ſome few unfortunate families where the ſmall pox is worſe
than the plague. Mrs. Berkeley having not long weaned
her ſecond ſon, and duly prepared by Mr. Sutton, her
friends all conceived that inoculation would be to her
what, by the bleſſing of God, it is to thouſands, to mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
not to herſelf; <hi>ſhe</hi> conceived, if ſhe eſcaped with
life, that would be all; but the ſufferings, her not having
had that frightful diſeaſe <hi>had</hi> occaſioned to her Mother,
<hi>did</hi> conſtantly occaſion to an almoſt adoring Huſband, and
the tendereſt of Siſters, determined her one way or other to
deliver them from their inceſſant anxiety; accordingly ſhe,
together with Mr. Monck Berkeley, then between four and
five years old, were both inoculated on the ſame day,
with the ſame matter. The latter had only three puſtules,
and did not loſe half an hour's play through indiſpoſition.
His Mother had but few in her face, thoſe on her noſe
pitted to the bone, a vaſt number on her head, a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
quantity in her throat, and ſeveral on her arms, fingers,
and feet; all ſhewed their malignity by being confluent,
and not turning until three and twenty days—a plain
proof, but for Mr. Sutton's method of treating the ſmall
pox, ſhe had ſhared the fate of her beautiful aunt Miſs
Cherry. Mr. Sutton aſſerted to Dr. Berkeley and others,
<pb n="ccxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:306"/>
Mrs. Berkeley's friends, that he had never before had ſuch
a patient. He was much alarmed, and exceedingly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
ſaying, <q rend="inline">"that had Mrs. Berkeley caught the ſmall
pox in the natural way, ſhe would have mortified in a
few days; that had Mr. Monck Berkeley caught it in the
natural way, it had probably never have been known that
he had had it."</q> Mrs. Berkeley's mother, Mrs. Frinſham,
had only ten puſtules, when a child about eight years old.
A ſingular ſymptom attended Mrs. Berkeley's ſmall pox,
that of her eyes being, for more than three days, ſet in
their ſockets, ſo fixed that ſhe could not move them at
all, could only ſee in an abſolutely ſtraight direction; yet
ſhe had not one puſtule in her eyes, or on her eye-lids;
it was quite internal.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Berkeley had been at firſt at Sutton Houſe; but,
having always a wonderful partiality for her own home,
which ſhe conceives would be the caſe if her home was a
neat clean barn, begged Mr. Sutton's permiſſion to return
to her own houſe, with which he very obligingly complied,
on condition of her going to him when he could not call
on her, which ſhe punctually did, her horſes having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe to do, but drag her then wretched frame to take
the air, as directed, half a dozen times in the day, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unable to walk. Mrs. Berkeley, in her viſits to Sutton
Houſe, uſed to enquire of the ſenſible well-bred Reverend
Mr. Houlton, chaplain to Mr. Sutton, when her eyes would
<pb n="ccxcv" facs="tcp:0761700600:307"/>
be better? his conſtant anſwer was, <q rend="inline">"Oh! dear Madam,
you will be in heaven to morrow, I aſſure you."</q> The
next day Mrs. Berkeley, on entering the drawing-room,
enquired of her fellow patients where Mr. Houlton was, that
ſhe might tell him, <q rend="inline">"She did not like HIS, Mr. HOULTON's,
heaven at all."</q> The very witty Canon Bowles, of Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
being one of the patients, opened the door, and
called out, <q rend="inline">"Houlton, come down; her is Mrs. Berkeley,
the lady of a Divine, that declares ſhe does not even <hi>wiſh</hi>
to go to heaven;—come down, man, and talk to the
poor lady."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A lady, whoſe name is not at preſent remembered by
the Editor, came down one morning, looking much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed,
ſaying, <q rend="inline">"I am very ill indeed."</q> She ſent for the
ſenſible, clever, <hi>conſoling</hi> houſekeeper, and exhibited her
cheſt covered over with a moſt tremendous eryſipelas. The
houſekeeper ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Do not fear, Madam; if it pleaſe God,
you will get ſafe through;"</q> the lady, turning to Mrs.
Berkeley, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"<hi>If I do,</hi> I ſhall be the <hi>firſt</hi> of my family
that ever did."</q> It did pleaſe Providence to bring
her ſafely through, and ſpare her to a moſt anxious
huſband, who viſited her with trembling tenderneſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Berkeley ſuffered much from the kind perſecutions
of Dr. Berkeley and her Siſter, to ſuffer Sir William Duncan
<pb n="ccxcvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:308"/>
and Dr. Addington <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Addington uſed frequently to tell the Editor, that the firſt fee he ever received was at the houſe of Mr. Frinſham. A gentleman on a viſit there was taken ſuddenly ill; Dr. Hayes was his phyſician, but Dr. Addington hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penned to dine at White Waltham; he preſcribed; and, as he ſaid, got his handſel in Berks. He got a better treaſure in Berks than gold, than rubies, the beſt and moſt ſenſible of wives, one of what the Editor always ſtyles HOUSE BUILDERS. See the Proverbs of Solomon, chap. xxxi. Not <hi>Caſtle,</hi> but <hi>Houſe</hi> Builders, are real treaſures to ſons and daughters. This M.D. narrowly eſcaped one of the weakeſt, and obtained one of the wiſeſt of women.</note> to be ſent for; which Mrs. Berkeley
reſolutely oppoſed, fearing it might injure the cauſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation,
the greateſt bleſſing ſurely that ever was granted
to the terreſtrial part of man. Mrs. Berkeley reſolved to
live or die, as it ſhould pleaſe the all-wiſe Diſpoſer of all
events, by Mr. Sutton alone. Being at that time a little in
the world, and a little known, ſhe conceived, that calling
in regular medical aid would eaſily be turned into, <q rend="inline">"Mrs.
George Berkeley would <hi>certainly</hi> have <hi>died by Sutton's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi>
if ſo and ſo had not ſaved her life."</q> Mr. Sutton
felt himſelf ſo obliged by her conduct, that he, at different
times, inoculated poor people <hi>gratis,</hi> whom ſhe recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to him, obligingly telling her, <q rend="inline">"One line from her
at any time, ſent by a poor perſon, ſhould be ſufficient
introduction to his care and his kitchen."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is the faſhion with perſons of a certain deſcription
to diſbelieve what they cannot comprehend, and to laugh
at what they do not underſtand, and many perſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode

               <p>Several years after, one night, at a large rout at Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
there was univerſal lamentation over a family, who
had loſt a darling child by inoculation in the common

diſeaſe ever did recover, until the introduction of inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
and in ſuch unhappy families their children ſhould
be carefully kept out of the reach of infection, until old
enough to take remedies to prevent being choaked, as it

experienced it, at leaſt, in one very pleaſing inſtance,
his introduction to his noble, highly-honoured, reſpected
friends, their Graces the Duke and Ducheſs of Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough<note n="*" place="bottom">Had Mr. Berkeley been living, how ſincerely, how tenderly, would he have ſympathized with that illuſtrious pair on their late loſs. The Editor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices that their Graces have ſtill two ſons (although ſhe had none), a very amiable young nobleman, and a very fine youth, who, by having his late, learned, accompliſhed brother held up as a pattern, may be ſtimulated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him. Before Mr. Monck Berkeley conſidered his health as irrecoverable. He one day ſaid to the Editor, <q rend="inline">"If God ſpares my life until next ſummer, I mean to ſtep abroad, and viſit my friend Lord Henry Spencer."</q> The Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor does not recollect where his Lordſhip then was. Mrs. Berkeley's conſtant, advice to her Son was, whilſt perſons of high rank or ſtation treat you as a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, a man of family, although <hi>untitled,</hi> always remember that they are <hi>your</hi> ſuperiors; but, the inſtant they forget, have nothing more to do with them. Mr. Monck Berkeley never would viſit, or meet, notwithſtanding all her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's <hi>ſubmiſſions,</hi> a poor ſilly Peereſs, his near relation, who, having a <hi>very</hi> ſhort memory, had <hi>quite</hi> forgot her kinſman, until ſhe learned in town, that it was <hi>ton</hi> to be acquainted with Mr. Monck Berkeley. So much for the preſent of her Ladyſhip's WISDOM. When the Marquis of Blandford went to Eton, the then Dean of Canterbury, who went down with him, deſired Mr. Monck Berkeley, about two or three years older, to take his Lordſhip under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, <hi>i.e.</hi> as the Editor conceives, to ſee that they are not <hi>too</hi> much buffeted by their own or an higher form; a certain <hi>quantum</hi> is excellent for—the Editor had almoſt ſaid Kings; however, <hi>certainly</hi> for <q rend="inline">"Lords and Commons."</q> Dr. Berkeley, having known this, and his Son's telling him that the Marquis of Blandford was at Chriſt Church, on Mr. Monck Berkeley's firſt return from Oxford to the Oaks, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I ſuppoſe Lord Blandford had quite forgot you; it is ſo long ſince you left Eton, (near ſeven years.)</q> Mr. Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"Indeed, my dear Sir, you are miſtaken; being engaged to dine one day at the noblemen's table at Chriſt Church, and ſeeing Lord Blandford come into the hall, I determined to wait, thinking he might <hi>really</hi> might have forgotten me; but the inſtant his eye caught me, he ſprang forward, and took me by the hand, ſaying, 'My dear Berkeley, how do you do?

when Dr. King was appointed to Dr. Tanner's vacant
ſtall in the church of Canterbury. Immediately on
hearing it, he, with his wonted ſweetneſs, when aſking
a favour of either of his parents, ſaid to his Father,

               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Berkeley, feeling the unpleaſantneſs of Mr. Manby's
ſituation, beſought Dr. King to bring him to Dr. Berkeley's.
Mrs. Berkeley, her Son being in London, ſent immediately
to a very amiable worthy young man, who felt great grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
for ſome very <hi>eſſential</hi> ſervices rendered him by Mrs.
Berkeley, repaying his attentions, when a boy, to her little
boys, much younger, at the King's School, the worthy
Mr. William Jackſon, ſon of the Collector of Exciſe, and
afterwards an Alderman of Canterbury. This grateful,
well-informed young man died, after a very few days illneſs,
univerſally lamented, as he was univerſally beloved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected.
His wonderfully low-lived parents gave rings of
his hair, ſet with diamonds, to many of the ladies of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,
who would not have known that he exiſted, as
himſelf uſed to ſay, but for Mrs. Berkeley's gratitude; which
when he, at nineteen, quitted the King's School, led her
to invite him to play at cards at the round table with the
younger ladies and gentlemen at her routs. Mrs. Berkeley
<pb n="cccv" facs="tcp:0761700600:317"/>
introduced him to her learned friend the Reverend John
Duncombe and his Lady, and requeſted them, when ſhe
left Canterbury, in 1777, to take to him. His mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
much cultivation from that learned, worthy, well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
pair. To Mrs. Berkeley the old woman ſent
into <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> Mrs. Berkeley being there at the time of his
death, a piece of catgut worked with her ſon's hair, ſaying,
<q rend="inline">"that Mrs. Berkeley did not <hi>want</hi> diamonds."</q> Poor
young man, he often, when living, felt her low abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
when ſhe <hi>inſiſted</hi> on exhibiting to her ſon's company.
He repeatedly ſaid to numbers of people, <q rend="inline">"But for Mrs.
Berkeley's goodneſs, and I had been in ſuch a ſet,"</q>
(naming ſeveral aldermen's ſons, &amp;c.) ſome now vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Democrats, who were kept in their own line of
company, whilſt Jackſon was in the firſt company in the
church and county. His father, at his death, left legacies
to all his ſon's friends, excepting to Mrs. Duncombe and
to Mrs. Berkeley, to neither of whom an hundred guineas
for a ring would have been unacceptable. But the new
Legacy Bill will never affect Mrs. Berkeley; for, as Mrs.
Frinſham ſays, when any of her rich relations die childleſs,
<q rend="inline">"Siſter, to be ſure they forget that you and I exiſt, or
that we know how to <hi>ſpend</hi> a little money, for none of
them ever name us even for a ten guinea ring."</q>
               </p>
               <p>But, quitting this ſubject for a much pleaſanter, Jackſon
immediately preſented himſelf in Mrs. Berkeley's dreſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room,
<pb n="cccvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:318"/>
when ſhe introduced him to Mr. Manby, requeſting
him to become his guide, to conduct him to every thing
worthy notice in the church or city, to repair to the Oaks
every morning at breakfaſt, and every day at three to take
their dinner with Mrs. Berkeley, and ſpend the afternoon;
the Prebendaries dining together at each other's houſes,
during the audit, the tables generally being full; and taking
their tea in the audit-room.</p>
               <p>On the day when they dined at Dr. Berkeley's,
on Mrs. Berkeley's entering the eating-room, the dinner
ſerved, the Biſhop of Norwich, then Dean, going up to
her, preſented her with a pamphlet, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Madam,
entirely in obedience to your commands, there is the
ſermon that I preached on Trinity Sunday. If it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
any good, it is entirely owing to you, for it has been
often preached, and never was intended for the preſs.
but you inſiſted upon its being publiſhed; and I have
obeyed your orders."</q> Many of the Prebendaries ſaid,
the public were very much indebted to Mrs. Berkeley.
The Biſhop, when ſitting at dinner, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I muſt requeſt
you, my dear Madam, to give me a liſt of your friends
whom you wiſh ſhould read it, that I may ſend it to my
bookſeller."</q> Mrs. Berkeley felt, as it merited, this very

ſaid, <q rend="inline">"She would requeſt a few to ſend to ſome of her
friends in Scotland; that her Engliſh friends could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide

               </p>
               <p>When the audit was ended, and the good little Doctor<note n="*" place="bottom">The next time Mrs. Berkeley ſaw her Son, after his good friend, Dr. King's viſit at the Oaks, he enquired, <q rend="inline">"how ſhe liked his old friend?"</q> She replied, as all <hi>will</hi> reply who know him intimately, at the ſame time aſking Mr. Monck Berkeley, <q rend="inline">"What is Mrs. King like?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Like, my dear Madam, why, like a QUEEN.

                     </gap> uſed to ſtyle a very plain woman one of Berkeley's beauties. Mr. Berkeley was <hi>then</hi> only ſeventeen, and ever ſuch an admirer of a ſuperior un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that, provided he heard wiſdom, he regarded not the mouth.</note>
and his brother going to quit Canterbury, this moſt amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

<hi>any</hi> time, in <hi>any</hi> way, I can render you <hi>any</hi> ſervice, you

Mrs. Berkeley conjured him not to diſtreſs her, by ſaying
a ſyllable more to her, for having <hi>only</hi> done juſt what every
other perſon, not a ſavage, had they known his ſituation,
<hi>would</hi> have done.</p>
               <p>The Editor cannot here forbear relating a little anecdote
of her Son's lovely amiability, of which ſhe was only very
lately informed, he never having mentioned it. A lady,
who was a ſtranger, viſiting at Mrs. Berkeley's, happened
to ſit oppoſite the fine portrait of Mr. Berkeley, painted
by his amiable accompliſhed friend, Mr. Peters; ſhe, in a
low voice, ſaid to the lady who ſat next to her, <q rend="inline">"I never
ſaw ſo like a picture in my life."</q> Mrs. Berkeley, although
ſhe cannot ſee, yet hears remarkably quick, (thanks to
God's bleſſing on the ſkill of Mr. Maull in Piccadilly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted
about twenty years ago,) ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I did not know, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
that my Son had the honour to be known to you."</q>
To which the good old lady very politely replied, <q rend="inline">"Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<hi>I</hi> had the honour to be known to Mr. Berkeley. One
year returning from Margate, we wiſhed to ſee the cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
of Canterbury; we walked up, and could not ſee
any one to tell us where to find the perſon who ſhowed it.
We ſaw a great many gentlemen walking backwards and
forwards by the ſide of the church. After ſome time one
<pb n="cccix" facs="tcp:0761700600:321"/>
of them, detaching himſelf from the reſt, came up to us,
and, in the politeſt manner, ſaid, 'Ladies, are you in
any diſtreſs, in which I can aſſiſt you? The ladies told their
wiſh to ſee the cathedral, and their utter inability to find
out how to do it. Mr. Berkeley ſaid, 'If you will have
the goodneſs to wait two minutes, I will get the verger
to attend you.' He ſtepped into a ſhop, ſent off a lad
for the verger, and again joined the ladies. On the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
of the verger, Mr. Berkeley eſcorted them into the
church, pointed out to them ſome particular beauties of
that glorious temple of God, charged the verger not to
omit ſhewing them ſome things as he named; then,
ſaying 'he had an engagement,' made an elegant bow,
wiſhed them a pleaſant journey, and took his leave."</q>
The ladies enquired of the verger who that young gentleman
was to whoſe politeneſs they were ſo much indebted. He
replied, <q rend="inline">"that it was Mr. Berkeley, ſon to one of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends."</q>
The ladies expreſſing gratitude, the verger ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"Yes, Madam, every body loves Mr. Berkeley exceedingly,
he is ſo kind and condeſcending to every one."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley both had been for ſome time
wiſhing to obtain for their worthy old ſervant, Mr. Wright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
when he ſhould marry and quit ſervice, the place of
one of his Majeſty's meſſengers, he having repeatedly flown,
with incredible velocity, over this kingdom, and to and
from Ireland, on Dr. Berkeley's buſineſs; and probably,
<pb n="cccx" facs="tcp:0761700600:322"/>
had it not pleaſed the ALL-WISE Director of ALL things,
<hi>ſmall</hi> as well as <hi>great,</hi> to remove to the ſociety he ſo ſtrongly
reſembled on earth the angelic Mr. Manby, the poor of
Canterbury had not been bleſſed with quite ſo excellent,
ſo judicious, and ſo kind a governor, as ſucceſſor to their
former very worthy maſter, Mr. Nott. It is ſurely a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

               <p>The Editor is much addicted, wherever ſhe reſides or
ſtays, any little time at a place, to viſit the <hi>work-houſes,</hi>
feeling tender pity for thoſe who have not a penny to buy
tobacco, ſnuff, or a little <hi>two</hi> ſhilling tea, and <hi>ſweetened
ſand,</hi> called ſugar, to ſeaſon it. Her feelings ſuffered much
whilſt at Oxford; as ſhe really conceives, from what ſhe
<hi>herſelf</hi> ſaw. The relation of two of her old ſervants, whom
ſhe frequently ſent thither, that moſt well-regulated Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells
are Paradiſes compared to the Oxford Work-houſe;
in ſhort, nothing out of the infernal regions can be worſe,
or worſe conducted. Mrs. Berkeley's maid, ſent thither
one day to ſee after a poor ſick woman, was obliged to
take ſhelter in a room ſome poor creature opened to her;
an audacious harlot flying through the houſe with a great
knife to murder the then poor, ſtupid, ignorant miſtreſs.
They have no poundage from earnings: <hi>once</hi> in the year,
at the <hi>Races,</hi> they have, ſome two-pence, ſome ſix-pence,
<pb n="cccxi" facs="tcp:0761700600:323"/>

               <p>Mrs. Berkeley, one day, on going out, gave a poor
woman, who had called the miſtreſs to her, and ſhewn her
the <hi>uncultivated</hi> wretched garden, a ſhilling. The poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
gratitude and extacies were ſorely diſtreſſing, adding,
<q rend="inline">"I have not ſeen a ſhilling before for two years."</q> This
poor creature had lived comfortably in London, her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
a maſon, killed by the breaking of a ſcaffold, when
alas! ſhe was wretched enough to belong to ſome pariſh in
Oxford. Mrs. Berkeley enquired whom among the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
were tenderly diſpoſed towards the poor, and was
told, Mr. Slatter the baker, and Mr. Ayton the grocer.
Mr. Slatter ſerving Dr. Berkeley's family with bread, ſhe
inſtantly ſet off to call on him, and never recollects to have
ſeen a more ſenſible, well-behaved, humane perſon in
humble ſtation; he would make a better figure in an higher,
than many who have ſcrambled up to it. He aſſured her,
that, unable to combat with the <hi>majority</hi> of the guardians
in defence of the poor, he had in deſpair relinquiſhed it
entirely.</p>
               <p>She then went to Mr. Ayton, and received a ſimilar an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
She exhorted both, but, ſhe fears, in vain. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
unpleaſant it might be to continue to fight the battles
of the poor, ſhe aſſured them there would come a time
<pb n="cccxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:324"/>
when they would rejoice that they had done it. Their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
was, that the loweſt and moſt mercenary of the tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were appointed guardians, and there was no oppoſing
them. How different from Canterbury! two moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable
tradeſmen out of each of the ſixteen pariſhes
are annually choſen; ſometimes, ſhe conceives, rechoſen;
as, when ſhe wiſhed to get a poor creature going in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
depoſited, ſhe conſtantly went to Dr. Berkeley's
baker, the very worthy, ſenſible well-bred Mr. Johnſon,
educated at the univerſity of Cambridge. On the death of
his father he moſt dutifully and affectionately went home,
to aſſiſt his worthy mother in carrying on her buſineſs.
Mr. Johnſon, if not in office himſelf, conſtantly took care
to apply to ſome worthy man who was. The Editor is no
Democrat; feels horrors at the vile idea of Equality—but
ſuch direful <hi>inequality</hi> as a rich <hi>bon-vivant</hi> Oxford tradeſman—and the poor, almoſt poiſoned poor creatures in that vile
workhouſe, muſt hurt every heart who has ever redde in
the Bible, <q rend="inline">"Who maketh thee to differ from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?"</q>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Editor, after delivering her ſentiments very freely
on one claſs of people in Oxford, cannot quit the place
without taking notice of a very different claſs, whom ſhe
once had it in contemplation to addreſs in the Oxford
Mercury, as ſhe did not feel happy to quit Oxford without
offering her very grateful acknowledgements to them—the
<pb n="cccxiii" facs="tcp:0761700600:325"/>
young gentlemen of the Univerſity. It is a general, an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
univerſal complaint amongſt the Fair Sex. The Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
begs pardon for a miſnomer; ſhe ought to have written
the RED SEX; for almoſt all now reſemble <hi>Rouge Dragon</hi>
in Heraldry; to be ſure, the preſent dreſs makes them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
Heraldic animals, and Swift's yahoos. The Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
famous amongſt her friends for never wearing any cap
or hat that did not become her ſort of face, nor any colour
that did not become her complexion, and was perpetually
conſulted on that ſubject by her friends, cannot help think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Father of Miſchief has been the inventor of
the preſent mode of dreſſing, particularly the vile, ſcooped
out hats, or rather ſtraw caps; ſhe therefore ſtyles them
<hi>Diabolls.</hi> It is no wonder that huſbands go aſtray from
wives ſo odiouſly disfigured.</p>
               <p>That all polite attentions from gentlemen to ladies is at
an end, is a charge perhaps too well founded. An excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
exaltedly pious friend of the Editor's, but lately gone
to glory, the lady of the late very worthy amiable Thomas
Baber, Eſquire, of Sunninghill Park, and who had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
to be the mother of Edward Baber, Eſquire, well
known to all in the Eaſt for his <hi>inflexible</hi> honeſty. He had
the happineſs of throughly pious, as well as accompliſhed
parents. This lady, once a moſt celebrated beauty, uſed
to ſay, <q rend="inline">"The young men of this day are quite Hottentots;
all I expect of them is, that, if I happen to fall down,
<pb n="cccxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:326"/>
they will be ſo good as to kick me aſide, and not walk
over me."</q> The Editor fears the charge may be too true;
but ſhe feels it a duty incumbent on her to ſay, <q rend="inline">"that if
politeneſs to females is baniſhed from every other place,
it has taken up its reſidence amongſt the <hi>young</hi> gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the univerſity of Oxford—<hi>true</hi> politeneſs extending
ever to <hi>aged</hi> females."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Editor, as has been mentioned before, has at ſixty
every accompliſhment that ſome are without at eighty;
frequently, if walking alone, ſtepping into a <hi>grey</hi> puddle,
miſtaking it for a nice clean broad ſtone. The polite at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
from young gentlemen in aſſiſting her to croſs
the ſtreet, ſometimes accompanying her half a ſtreet's
length to direct her to a ſhop, opening the door for her,
always giving her the wall, not driving her off the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as two officers did a few years ago at Newcaſtle,
ſhe leaning on her huſband's arm—he being dreſſed in a
ſhort caſſock, they ſuppoſed him a biſhop, as they ſaid <hi>en
paſſant,</hi> and knew <hi>(worthy wights!)</hi> he could not <hi>challenge</hi>
them, but he ſeverely reproved their <hi>brutality.</hi> The Editor
happened to hear that the wife of one of them <hi>amply</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
her quarrel. He almoſt deſerved it.</p>
               <p>The Editor certainly owes her life to the polite humanity
of one gentleman, whoſe name, although ſhe took much
pains to learn it, ſhe never could find out, until the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="cccxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:327"/>
before ſhe quitted Magdalene Lodge, at the cloſe of
November 1795, or every grateful, reſpectful attention
would have been rendered to the Reverend Mr. Williams,
Sub-warden of Wadham College.</p>
               <p>A Lady of faſhion, well known in the polite circles, now
of an age, as well as the Editor, to dreſs for <hi>comfort,</hi> not
for ſhew, having an houſe in the neigbourhood of Oxford,
often walking in the ſtreet with the Editor, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Your
remark is very juſt, that the young men here are <hi>certainly
very well-bred;</hi> if they were not, they would laugh at us—for, to be ſure, you with your black beaver gypſey hat,
tied down and hiding half your little (politeneſs prevented
her adding, withered) face, and your ruſty black cloak;
and <hi>I</hi> in my <hi>old</hi> hat and <hi>old</hi> great coat, are two curious
enough figures."</q> The Editor's excellent relation and
herſelf are both old-faſhioned, in making it a point to pay
their butcher and baker every Monday morning. And the
Editor uſed always to tell Dr. Berkeley, and her Son, when
ſhe got a lecture for walking out in a morning without a
ſervant, that ſhe did not like a footman attending her,
when ſhe did not appear as if ſhe could pay him his
wages.</p>
               <p>The Editor never met with any impertinence, but twice,
during her <hi>ſejour</hi> in Oxford.—One day walking by Baliol
College, a poor creature in <hi>(ſhe ſuppoſes)</hi> a ſervitor's gown,
<pb n="cccxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:328"/>
expreſſing his diſlike of her hat, and after ſhe was paſſed,
ſaid, <q rend="inline">"<hi>he would give a crown to know who ſhe was,</hi>"</q> the
Editor languiſhed to have turned on her heel, and have
ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Young man, ſave your crown to buy Truſler's
edition of 'Lord Cheſterfield's Advice to the amiable
Phil. Stanhope.'—I will tell you, without reward, that
I am the wife of Dr. Berkeley, Prebendary of Canterbury;"</q>
but, having with her a lady who always returns pertneſs
by <hi>ſilent diſdain</hi> (which affects not fools, it may wiſe perſons)
the Editor's <hi>generoſity</hi> in gratifying the poor low-lived crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
curioſity <hi>gratis</hi> would have hurt her dignity. The
other was, one very hot evening, the Editor had taken in
her hand a <hi>para-ſol;</hi> a ſhower coming on, ſhe held it over
her head, to protect a very good hat. Not far from Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church
ſhe met a number of gentlemen, puſhing home from
the ſhower, who all paſſed her with their uſual politeneſs,
ſtepping off the very narrow pavement, to avoid incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moding
her; the rear was brought up by a <hi>little</hi> inſignificant
looking animal in a gown, who in a voice, reſembling
any thing but that of a young man, ſqueaked out,
<q rend="inline">"Look, look, here is a lady holding a <hi>para-ſol</hi> over her
in this violent ſhower—what a fool ſhe muſt be!!!"</q>
The Editor heard two or three of the gentlemen ſay,
<q rend="inline">"Not at all—it did not rain (ſhe ſuppoſes they added)
when ſhe ſet out."</q> The name of this wiſe <hi>little miſs,</hi>
in a black gown, is concealed in pity to his <hi>poor</hi> parents—it is enough to be <hi>burthened</hi> with <hi>ſuch</hi> a poor little
<pb n="cccxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:329"/>
creature, without ſeeing him held up to public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p>A very worthy friend of the Editor's, whom ſhe has not
had the <hi>delight</hi> of ſeeing for many years, Mrs. M. Jeffries,
of Richmond, uſed formerly to ſay, <q rend="inline">"One has <hi>no pleaſure</hi>
in hearing ſcandal from Mrs. George Berkeley, for the

                        <desc>_…</desc>
                     </gap>l will never tell one the name, until all the
town rings with it."</q> The exquiſitely kind attentions of
this wonderfully agreeable, worthy lady, to the Editor's
angelic friend, the late Mrs. Catharine Talbot (when her
excellent friend, the Marchioneſs de Grey, lent her houſe
at Richmond to Mrs. Talbot), during her lingering illneſs,
muſt ever endear her to the Editor, although it is little
likely ſhe ſhould every ſee her again, until they meet in
the region of ſpirits, as both are much attached to their
own abode.</p>
               <p>Quiting theſe two curious beings, the Servitor and
ſqueaking Miſs, to thank themſelves for theſe animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
the Editor returns her beſt thanks to all, and every
ſenſible polite young gentleman of the Univerſity. They
reſemble, in ſome reſpects, holy Job, who ſays, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Eyes
was I to the blind, feet was I to the lame,</hi>"</q> &amp;c. The
Editor ſincerely hopes, that they may never be afflicted
as he was; and that thoſe of her polite aſſiſters, who chooſe
to marry, may meet with wiſer and more pious wives than
<pb n="cccxviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:330"/>
                  <hi>at firſt</hi> fell to the lot of, certainly a <hi>favourite</hi> of the
ALMIGHTY's; HE naming him one of the three with
Noah and Daniel, who ſhould deliver their own ſouls.
This is mentioned to ſhew, to thoſe who believe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
of Scripture, the folly of ſuppoſing the hiſtory of
Job a <hi>pious fable,</hi> and that holy man an <hi>ideal</hi> perſon. See
poor Dr. Durell's ſimple book; and, in all other reſpects,
the accompliſhed Mrs. Chapone's wiſe one, on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>Since writing the above, the Editor has had the diſtreſs to
hear of the almoſt ſudden death of a throughly amiable man,
who accidentally meeting her at tea at a neighbouring gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's
houſe, and learning, not from the Editor, who is
not addicted to entertain her friends or viſitors with lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
that ſhe had much intricate<note n="*" place="bottom">It is impoſſible for her to omit offering her public acknowledgements to Mr. Wilberforce. <hi>The</hi> Mr. Wilberforce, the friend of all the diſtreſſed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their complexions are black or white, perhaps in this inſtance, might, with more propriety, be ſaid <hi>brown.</hi> Having found it is impracticable to aſſiſt her in getting the Lords of the Treaſury to remit the very heavy duty on the foreign books of Biſhop Berkeley's library, removed from Ireland for ſale in England, moſt generouſly wrote her a very polite letter, offering to lend her the money. He had never ſeen, or perhaps heard of her, until applied to, to uſe his intereſt with Mr. Pitt. It was moſt gratefully accepted, and will be moſt thankfully repaid. The Editor wiſhes ſhe could get her income from Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as eaſily as her Books (which, alas! have been ſo ill kept, that they have not defrayed the expence of carriage and duty. But, that many of them being wanted to complete ſets in England, it had been wiſer to have permitted the Iriſh worms to have finiſhed them in their native country); the Cuſtom-houſe Officers would not ſeize that. A widow in one kingdom, and her jointure in another, is rather unpleaſant, is, ſometimes, ſorely diſtreſſing.</note>, unpleaſant buſineſs to
ſtruggle through; viſited her the next day, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"he

for him to render her any ſervice, in any way, he
ſhould eſteem himſelf very happy if ſhe would, as he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely
ſaid, honour him with her commands."</q> The Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
accepted moſt gratefully his kind offer, and took leave
to employ him in a very fatiguing matter, in which his
amiability led him to be indefatigable. That it is not yet
accompliſhed, nor probably ever will, was not to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to want of every exertion of the amiable Dr. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove,
maſter of Pembroke College. This produced a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of intimacy. Mrs. Berkeley, ever wiſhing, with little
ability, to benefit all her friends children, took the liberty
to recommend to his attention and protection, a very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
fine youth of his College, a ſon of the very worthy
Mr. Andrews, ſurgeon at Stanmore in Middleſex, one of
fourteen olive-branches to whom this throughly amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hearted, benevolent man was exceedingly attentive and
kind, and told the Editor, <q rend="inline">"that it had pleaſed him, and
he dared ſay would pleaſe her, that young Andrews had,
on Dr. Johnſon's rooms becoming vacant, earneſtly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
to have them aſſigned to him."</q> Young Andrews
and his whole family, have as ſtrong underſtandings as
Dr. Johnſon. They are famed for it. May he make as
good uſe of it as did his predeceſſor in the rooms! This
agreable friend viſited at Magdalene Lodge three days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Mrs. Berkeley and Mrs. Frinſham earneſtly to honour

him, as he politely termed it, by drinking tea, and ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the evening at the Maſter's lodgings, ſaying, he would
invite ſome ladies, whom he named, the rector of Lincoln,
and ſome other ſenſible, agreable friends to meet them.
The very tender ſtate of Mrs. Berkeley's health forced her
to decline it, which ſhe now regrets. He promiſed to viſit
Datchet; alas! may his obliged friend meet him in a <hi>ſtill</hi>
pleaſanter place.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Berkeley, on her reviſiting Oxford for a few days,
offered for the Reverend Mr. Williams's acceptance, and
which ſhe hopes he received, one of the copies on royal
paper, gilt, &amp;c. (ſo decorated for ſome Lords Spiritual and
Temporal,) of Dr. Berkeley's famous <hi>long ſmothered</hi> ſermon,
preached at Lambeth Palace Chapel, at the conſecration of
his beloved old friend Biſhop Horne, which ſhe ſolemnly

               <p>The Editor, as perhaps ſhe may have before mentioned,
never had any <hi>very great</hi> dread of the diſapprobation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
mortals like herſelf; and, as ſhe one day ſaid to her
beloved partner, <q rend="inline">"the removal of her dear Son had anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated

title of RHADAMANTHUS, as apt to ſay unpleaſant things,
as his ſweetly amiable ſon is to utter pleaſing ones, thought
proper to ſay, <q rend="inline">"Mr. <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap> (the name not recollected by
the Editor) <hi>had robbed himſelf.</hi>"</q> This naturally rouzed
the honeſt man, who ſaid, <q rend="inline">"he <hi>muſt now</hi> find out the burg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larian
at any rate."</q> He immediately procured a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to apprehend his journeyman, who had ſerved a ſeven
years' apprenticeſhip to him, and behaved himſelf in the
moſt exemplary manner. He immediately accuſed his
accomplice, a journeyman hair-dreſſer. They were both
examined by the Mayor, and committed to priſon. Mr.
Berkeley coming home, the Editor at dinner aſked him
<q rend="inline">"if he knew this young Jew who had committed the
robbery;"</q> to which he replied, <q rend="inline">"Poor creature, he had
never committed this, nor probably any other robbery,
if he had not been drawn in by a vile raſcal of a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
as he is by courteſy ſtyled, a villain. It was
<pb n="cccxxviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:340"/>
moving to hear how excellent a character his worthy
maſter gave of him, until, he ſaid, within theſe laſt few
months, that he became acquainted with this <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
raſcal, when he became idle, and, of courſe, vicious."</q>
No human being, ſurely, ever had a greater dread of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
than Mr. Monck Berkeley; and often, during the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of his illneſs, uſed to exclaim, <q rend="inline">"What an idle life
I lead! Surely God will, I fear, call me into judgement
for it. I do nothing; I write nothing."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley lamented, that, through the ſtupidity of the
<hi>then</hi> town clerk, the poor creature had not been admitted
to bail. After dinner he retired to his own apartment,
and conſulted his law books. He was to leave Canterbury
very early the next morning, in company with his very
amiable neighbour, William Deedes, Junior, Eſquire, of
St. Stephen's, Canterbury, both being obliged to keep
term that day at the Temple—Mr. Deedes, that he might
not idle away a large eſtate, which he now poſſeſſes and
ſpends moſt worthily; Mr. Berkeley, that he might get
one, as he probably would have done, had it pleaſed God
to have bleſſed him with health.</p>
               <p>About eleven o'clock at night Mr. Berkeley came home,
and thus accoſted his Mother: <q rend="inline">"My dear Madam, you
muſt be pleaſed to <hi>promiſe me,</hi> that you will go to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
morning, the minute you have breakfaſted, <hi>before</hi>

                     <hi>you go to church,</hi> to this poor creature's parents, and tell
them, that if they do not retain Garrow to plead for their
ſon, he will certainly be ſentenced to death—that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
can and will get him off. I know he has a cauſe
this aſſize at Maidſtone, and if they will give him ſixty
guineas he will come on to Canterbury. Don't let them
<hi>hackle</hi> with him; for he will not come for a leſs fee, and
I know he will come for that; and <hi>I</hi> repeat it, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you to ſay, that <hi>nothing elſe can</hi> ſave their ſon—poor
fellow!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. B.—<q rend="inline">"I know not even where they live."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"Oh! John will find that out for you."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. B.—<q rend="inline">"I do not know them; and they would think
it very odd in me, an ignorant woman"</q>—</p>
               <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"<hi>Odd</hi> or <hi>even,</hi> beſt of Mothers, if you don't
this minute <hi>promiſe me ſolemnly</hi> that you will go, and
ſay what I have deſired you, I will take my hat, and

               </p>
               <p>To prevent her Son's going, Mrs. Berkeley, though with
but an indifferent grace, made the promiſe, and after
prayers the family retired. In the morning, a little before
five, the hour the chaiſe was ordered, Mr. Berkeley crept
into the chamber like a zephyr, that he might not diſturb his
<pb n="cccxxx" facs="tcp:0761700600:342"/>
Father, a very bad ſleeper, and repeated in his Mother's
ear all ſhe was to ſay. The promiſe once obtained, he had
no uneaſineſs on that ſcore. The Editor, after breakfaſt,
ſet off for Beſt's Lane, where ſhe witneſſed <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſcene, as
(her dear compaſſionate Son being removed) ſhe truſts, and
thinks, no one can <hi>ever again</hi> compel her to witneſs.</p>
               <p>On entering the houſe, ſhe ſaw affliction perſonified in
the figure of a decent middle-aged woman. Mrs. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
conceiving her the mother of the unfortunate young
man, began condoling with her. Soon coming to the
point, telling her who ſhe was, and delivering her Son's
meſſage, the poor woman exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"My God, what
goodneſs! that <hi>ſuch</hi> a gentleman ſhould condeſcend to
think about ſuch a <hi>poor wretch</hi> as I am. Oh! may God
reward him!!! Well! to be ſure, ſomebody <hi>did</hi> tell me
that a fine young gentleman, one of the Prebendary's
Sons, did ſay, walking on the Parade with other gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that my <hi>poor boy need not</hi> have been committed to
gaol."</q> She inſtantly roſe, and called her huſband. On
his entering the room, ſhe repeated Mr. Berkeley's meſſage
with delight—when, horrid to relate,—what can one call
him? not a deſcendant of Abraham by Sarah, not a <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen,</hi>
as the deſcendants of Eſau ſtyle themſelves, that they
be not miſtaken for the deſcendants of Abraham by Hagar.
he muſt have been an <hi>Iſhmaelite,</hi> worſe than an Iſhmaelite;
for not only his hand, but his HORRID tongue, was againſt
<pb n="cccxxxi" facs="tcp:0761700600:343"/>
his <hi>own</hi> child; for, in an hoarſe ſurly voice, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"<hi>No,
no; I ſhall do not ſuch thing; let him take his chance; if he
can't get off, he muſt be hanged.</hi>"</q> Mrs. Berkeley, on ſeeing
the agonies of the poor diſtracted mother, longed to have
ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"<hi>You will be damned.</hi>"</q> She did, however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
her indignation a little, and joined the ſupplications
of the wretched Mother, elevated with Mr. Berkeley's
meſſage into confidence of her poor ſon's life, now thrown
into the deepeſt deſpair. Never did the Editor ſo much
wiſh for a large fortune as at that moment, to have given
the mother the fee for the counſel that Mr. Monck Berkeley
ſo earneſtly recommended. After finding all ſoothing utterly
in vain, ſhe gave a looſe to her indignation, ſaying every thing
that it ſuggeſted to her. At length, bidding farewel to this
wretched mourning mother, ſhe returned home, without
deigning to look at the old father. Much it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<hi>he</hi> felt this. Not ſo his kind adviſer, Mr. Monck
Berkeley. One of the Editor's <hi>minor</hi> puniſhments for her
children, when young, until ten or twelve years old, was,
<q rend="inline">"You have not behaved well, in ſo, or ſo; I will not look
at you until to-morrow dinner time."</q> This was ſo keenly
felt by her eldeſt Son, Mr. Monck Berkeley, that he would
often, in the ſweeteſt voice, ſupplicate, <q rend="inline">"Now do forget
it, and look at me a little."</q> A proof this, of what the
Editor frequently aſſerts, <q rend="inline">"That a little common ſenſe,
and great ſteadineſs, may reſcue children from <hi>much</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="cccxxxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:344"/>
puniſhment, and make a more laſting impreſſion on
their minds."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Compaſſion carried her, ſometimes, when taking her
morning walk, to viſit this <q rend="inline">"<hi>Houſe of moarning.</hi>"</q> This
melancholy affair happened ſeveral weeks before the aſſizes.
The wretch remained inflexible, and the poor mother in
ſuch a ſtate of deſpair, as never to waſh her hands or face,
put on or take off her cloaths, ſitting the whole day without
uttering a word. At length, juſt before the trial was to
come on, ſome more powerful orator than Mrs. Berkeley;
probably ſome modern TERTULLUS, prevailed on the old
wretch to ſend and retain Mr. Garrow, who came on from
Maidſtone to Canterbury; and, as Mr. Berkeley had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,
got the poor young Jew off for tranſportation for life.
Some kind Chriſtian neighbour (for ſhe and her children
were eſteemed by all, as the poor ſoul juſtly ſaid, for more
than twenty years paſt) flew out of the Guildhall, and told
her the <q rend="inline">"<hi>joyful tidings.</hi>"</q>—She ſtarted up, fell on her knees,
thanked God, went up ſtairs, dreſſed herſelf neatly as
formerly, went out to the fiſh-market, and ordered hom
her matters for her family as uſual.</p>
               <p>Dr. Berkeley, on hearing it, as all the city was talking of
it, expreſſed his aſtoniſhment, that the mind could ſo ſoon,
after ſuch length of time, recover its wanted energy. The
Editor, it may be ſuppoſed, did not fail to call in Beſts
<pb n="cccxxxiii" facs="tcp:0761700600:345"/>
Lane, and obey the delightfully pleaſing injunction of the
Apoſtle—<q rend="inline">"Rejoice with them that do rejoice."</q> The
worthy woman's gratitude, aſcribing the <hi>temporal</hi> ſalvation
of her ſon to Mr. Monck Berkeley's judicious, amiably
kind advice, in which all agreed, was very delightful to the
fond heart of his happy mother.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to omit mentioning here, that, in the
year 1793, Dr. Berkeley had with him, at Canterbury,
Mr. Patrick Satterley, eldeſt ſon of the ſkilful, ſucceſsful,
humane Mr. Satterley, ſurgeon and apothecary, of Haſtings,
for whom Dr. Berkeley had taken a lodging, accidentally, at
a ſilverſmith's in Palace Street, whoſe worthy wife was
ſiſter to the young man reſcued from the gallows by Mr.
Berkeley. Mr. Satterley getting a violent fever, and Dr.
Berkeley going to him, they diſcovered that he was the
father of their brother's benefactor, and immediately declared
that no nurſe was neceſſary, for that they eſteemed it their
duty to render every poſſibly attention to any friend of that
dear good Mr. Berkeley, who had been the means of
reſcuing their poor brother from an ignominious death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley, on going to Haſtings, was told by his
ſurgeon in town, Mr. Blicke, that he would find a moſt
ſkilful, attentive, medical man in Mr. Satterley. This
gentleman is famous for reſcuing perſons from <q rend="inline">"the houſe
appointed, at length, for all the deſcendant of Adam,"</q>
                  <pb n="cccxxxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:346"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"<hi>Apoſtate</hi> Adam,"</q> as good Dr. Joſhua Smith ſtyles him, in
his "Hickes's Pſalms." The aged, he, by God's bleſſing, on
his great medical ſkill, preſerves, in <hi>comfortable</hi> health, to
extreme old age—the <hi>dreadfully raſh</hi> young, who preſume to
ruſh, uncalled, into the preſence of <q rend="inline">"the <hi>great Judge</hi> of
quick and dead,"</q> by his great chirurgical ſkill. The
Editor <hi>knows</hi> two thus happily reſcued by him; and ſhe
knows of ſeveral others—one old wretch, the late ***********,
the murderer of her amiable accompliſhed friend,
the late Judge Advocate of *******.</p>
               <p>Mr. Satterley, <hi>preſuming</hi> to give himſelf a few holydays,
to make a viſit to his eldeſt ſon, a very elegant amiable
young man, at Oxford, of whom he ſaid to Mr. Monck
Berkeley, <q rend="inline">"That young man, from a child, has never done
<hi>that thing</hi> that I wiſhed him not to do;"</q> this horrid old
monſter diſmiſſed Mr. Satterley, and called in other medical
aid, who, in one ſhort fortnight, diſmiſſed HIM—to a place
whence he will never return, until called to meet the
amiable, throughly Honourable Mr. *******. This old
monſter had prefixed to his name (by birth) that pretty
elegant word, which ſhould remind all who poſſeſs it, not
to diſgrace it, <hi>Honourable</hi> *****.</p>
               <p>The Editor is ſometimes, by one or two of her <hi>gnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining,</hi>

one <hi>ſingle</hi> ſoul, ſhe will eſteem herſelf happy.</p>
               <p>The laſt time the Editor viſited Canterbury, alas! ſhe
called on the worthy Iſraelites, to thank them for their kind
gratitude ſhewn to Mr. Patrick Satterley; when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated

Berkeley. There are certainly ſome <q rend="inline">"<hi>double diſtilled ſuperfine

               <p>When Mr. Monck Berkeley was a very little boy, the

                  </gap> Henchman, Eſquire, of the India

was ſent off to India. On bidding adieu to his elegant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he threw his arms about her; ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Farewel,
my dear mother; God only knows whether we ſhall ever
meet again in this world. But comfort yourſelf with this,
<pb n="cccxxxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:348"/>
that as I leave you an <hi>honeſt</hi> boy, whether I live or die,
by God's bleſſing, you ſhall never hear of me but as an
<hi>honeſt</hi> man."</q> So ſaying, he quitted the houſe; and,
from what the Editor gathers from her news-paper, Mr.
Henchman ſeems to keep his charming early promiſe. The
Editor has not the pleaſure of being at all acquainted with
him, having never ſeen him ſince his return from India,
The above little anecdote is related <hi>verbatim,</hi> as it was told
to Dr. Berkeley and herſelf at the time, by their ſenſible
agreeable friend, the late Reverend Humphrey Henchman,
Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. Both theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were grand and great-grandſons of Biſhop Henchman
of London. This ſtory was very frequently told to Mr.
Monck Berkeley by his Mother, during his childhood and
youth, with exhortations to make the ſame reſolution. Mr.
Berkeley uſed frequently to ſay, <q rend="inline">"Whatever faults I have, I
thank God, and my dear Mother, that I am an <hi>honeſt</hi>
man."</q> He was in truth ſo; and, it may with equal
truth be aſſerted, a man of the ſtricteſt honour<note n="*" place="bottom">When Mr. Monck Berkeley was a very little boy, his mother made him get in memory the lines of Mr. Pope; <hi>a little altered for his particular</hi> uſe:
<q>
                        <l>"Reflect that leſſen'd fame is ne'er regain'd,</l>

                     </q>
When about ſix years old, he came one day to his mother, with Pope in his hand, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"My dear mama—here is a man that has got your verſes, and printed them, but not <hi>quite write,</hi> for he ſays <hi>virgin</hi> honour."</q> Mr. Monck Berkeley, when grown up, uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"What a little fool I muſt have been, not to find out that my mother was the alterer, not Mr. Pope."</q> Mrs. George Berkeley incurred ſome ridicule for thus early inſtilling into her little boy a ſenſe of honour; but, where <hi>conſcience</hi> is concerned, ſhe ever did, by GOD's grace ever will, defy <hi>ridicule;</hi> which, let the wretched Lord Shafteſbury ſay what he will, is <q rend="inline">"<hi>not the teſt of</hi> TRUTH;</q> for ſuch a genius as his Lordſhip may ridicule the whole life of the Saviour of the World.

The Editor has to return her moſt grateful heartfelt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements
for the wonderfully kind, amiable atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Reverend Dr. Lynch, Prebendary of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
for his inceſſant unwearied exertions in <hi>endeavouring</hi> to
lighten her <hi>heavy</hi> buſineſs at Canterbury. It was <hi>her</hi> miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
<hi>not his</hi> fault, that he happened to pitch upon the
laſt man in England whom ſhe would have appointed her
ſurveyor, and more particularly as he owed very great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to Dr. Berkeley. The Editor, ſome weeks ago,
being adviſed by a printer to apply to a paper-maker, a very
rich man, for paper to print off the ſecond volume of Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
Relics prepared by Mr. Monck Berkeley; the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
it was <hi>civilly</hi> declined. The Editor remarked, that
ſhe was ſure, before ſhe wrote, that it would, becauſe he
was under very important obligations to Dr. Berkeley. The
very worthy bookſeller, the obliging Mr. Cook, of Oxford,
ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Do I underſtand you right, Madam?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir,

have met with numerous inſtances of <hi>real</hi> friendſhip,
where neither on Dr. Berkeley's or my own account I
had <hi>any</hi> right to expect <hi>any</hi> attention but civility."</q> It is
impoſſible for the Editor to paſs on without inſerting here
the name of the witty, worthy William Hey, Eſquire,
Commiſſioner of the Cuſtoms, for his unwearied exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to ſerve her: the noble, the angelic conduct of
the worthy Mrs. Taylor, of Clarges Street, Piccadilly, an
<hi>eléve</hi> of the lovely Mrs. Catharine Talbot, who had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
to live with her many years; who, hearing that the
Editor (not caring to <hi>coin</hi>) was in ſome difficulties, moſt
generouſly wrote to her, offering to ſell out her <hi>whole</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to lend to Mrs. Berkeley, the ſtocks then at ſixty-five.
It may eaſily be <hi>gueſſed</hi> what anſwer the Editor returned to

               <p>The Editor's thanks are particularly due, her prayers are

Mr. Sawkins, ſtudent of Chriſt Church, for literally <hi>forcing</hi>
money upon her, when ſhe could not procure a guinea
from Ireland, enabling her to pay a quarter's ſalary to one of
Dr. Berkeley's Curates, who wrote <hi>twice</hi> before Dr. Berkeley
had been dead three weeks. The ſalary became due on the
21ſt of December, 1794. Mrs. Berkeley loſt her beloved
Partner on the 6th of January, 1795, exactly ſixteen days
after. Dr. Berkeley, whether he received money or not
from Ireland, was always moſt ſcrupulouſly, <hi>conſcientiouſly,</hi>

worthy man who applied ſo expeditiouſly to his relict, conceived that ſhe

of her beloved Partner, demanding the payment of—a not very large ſum,
borrowed by Dr. Berkeley of his father during Dr. Berkeley's Chancery ſuit in
Ireland. The Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is indebted to the goodneſs of Dr. Berkeley's worthy old

They thought not, they acted not, like theſe two <hi>Divines;</hi>

quite ſo well as theſe Divines; but ſhe has a highly
cultivated mind, and a moſt feeling heart.</p>
               <p>The names, as above mentioned, are not communicated,
becauſe the Editor believes the <hi>haſty</hi> Curate a <hi>really worthy</hi> man,
although not bleſſed with <hi>quite</hi> ſo much delicacy as the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

glad of it; with the ſpirit of a princeſs, of an angel, ſhe
replied, <q rend="inline">"Good Madam, how could I think of <hi>troubling you</hi>
for a <hi>few</hi> pounds in <hi>your deep affliction?</hi> I wonder I could
do it now; but I heard you were about to leave Oxford,
and I thought perhaps you might not know of this bill;
but, if it is any inconvenience to you to pay it now, I
am perfectly willing to wait for it."</q> May this worthy
woman never experience the loſs of her good huſband, and
an only child!</p>
               <p>The forming this kind wiſh for this amiable-hearted wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
brings to the Editor's mind what occurred many years
ago. Walking out one evening, ſhe called at a farm-houſe,
to enquire for ſome pigeons. The miſtreſs preſented her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Mrs. Berkeley, wiſhing to ſhorten her walk home
requeſted the good woman to direct her the nearer way in
croſſing the fields. Mrs. Berkeley, not to appear proud,
began enquiring what family ſhe had? The reply made, ſhe
added, <q rend="inline">"Ah! Madam, I have <hi>thrice</hi> known the <hi>ſorrows of
widowhood.</hi>"</q> It had not <hi>much</hi> injured her health. She
was remarkably plump and <q rend="inline">"well favoured;"</q> perhaps ſhe
may have ſuffered the ſame ſorrows again. She might,
perhaps, be as great a philoſopher as her daughter, who
kept a ſhop in the next pariſh, where Dr. Berkeley's family
bought many odd things, whoſe daughter, a fine girl of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen,
<pb n="cccxliv" facs="tcp:0761700600:356"/>
was dying of a conſumption. Mrs. Berkeley, one
Sunday, at church, enquired after the young woman. On
hearing there were no hopes of her recovery, ſhe condoled
with the mother, who made the following reply: it is ſet
down <hi>verbatim.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Good lack-a-day, Madam, why <hi>ſhe</hi> and
<hi>I did not come into the world</hi> at the <hi>ſame time;</hi> and why
ſhould we think to <hi>go out</hi> at the <hi>ſame time?</hi>"</q> Probably
theſe good women mourned the loſs of relatives, as did a
tenant's wife of the late worthy agreeable Capt. Bartlam of
Moore Hall. The day after the death of her huſband Mrs.
Bartlam called to ſee her, and began condoling with her,
to whom ſhe replied, <q rend="inline">"O good lack-a-daiſy, Madam, 'tis
a <hi>ſad thing, to be ſure.</hi> I have been CRYING <hi>all</hi> the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>long;</hi> and as ſoon as ever I have ate this bit of bread

               </p>
               <p>How often has the Editor ſeen a table full of company, at
Dr. Berkeley's, laugh until <hi>unforced</hi> tears bedewed their cheeks,
when this ſtory was related, and acted by that beſt of ſtory-tellers,
the late delightfully witty Reverend James Hamilton,
grandſon of Lord Abercorn, formerly named in this Preface.
As alſo, that he ſpent the whole of the ſummer at Dr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's,
his curate conſtantly going to Mr. Hamilton's houſe in
Warwickſhire, in May, and remaining there until November,
in order that Mr. Hamilton might, as Dr. Berkeley uſed to
ſay, <q rend="inline">"give <hi>him</hi> all the time he could ſpare from his <hi>friends,</hi>
                     <pb n="cccxlv" facs="tcp:0761700600:357"/>
the beaſts of the field, the fowls of the air, and the fiſhes
of the river."</q> Mr. Hamilton, although an excellent ſcholar,
was wonderfully fond of hunting, ſhooting, and fiſhing.
Dr. Berkeley, living on the banks of the Thames, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a large pleaſure-boat of his own, in which Mr. Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
an excellent ſailor and rower, was perpetually on the
water, alone, early in the morning, but frequently took Mr.
Monck Berkeley with him. Mrs. Berkeley, dreading his too
volatile agility, feared that, in <hi>attempting</hi> to ASSIST Mr.
Hamilton in ſailing or rowing, he might be drowned;
notwithſtanding her ſtrong opinion, ſtill retained by the
Editor, although often laughed at by Mr. Hamilton, that
infants, if put into the water, would ſwim naturally, as
well as puppies, kittens, calves, &amp;c. He often urged her
to <hi>try the experiment</hi> on her own little boy. Mrs. Berkeley
told him ſhe was not an <hi>experimental</hi> philoſopher, and was
terribly afraid he might be drowned, with his garments,
<hi>not</hi> provided by nature like kittens, &amp;c<note n="*" place="bottom">During Mr. Berkeley's ſtay at the King's ſchool, nothing could prevail upon him to ſwim out of his depth; to the great diſcontent of his mother. One day, after having been ſome time at Eton, a young gentleman from Eton came over to ſee him; and, happening to relate ſomething, ſaid to Mrs. Berkeley, <q rend="inline">"You know he ſwims as well as you do."</q>—To which the Editor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <q rend="inline">"That is not at all I ſuppoſe."</q>—<q rend="inline">O yes, Madam, Berkeley is, I really think, the beſt ſwimmer in the ſchool. I don't ſuppoſe <hi>any</hi> thing could drown him, but the boat faſtening him in the mud—he ſwims like a duck."</q> Mrs. Berkeley aſked her ſon, how this came to paſs? he replied, <q rend="inline">"Why, they found what a fool I was, ſo a party of them took me out in a boat, and when we were got into deep water, contrived to throw me overboard, then rowed away; they kindly waited to ſee whether I could ſwim, in order to take me up if I could not. I, horridly frighted, inſtantly ſwam after them, and have ſwum, as he ſays, 'like a duck,' ever ſince. I am ſure I was much obliged by them;</q> adding, <q rend="inline">"Eton for ever, ſay I!"</q> The Editor had frequently, before her Son was born, heard Lady <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> relate this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Etonians to a new comer; and it actually occaſioned her worrying her Lord out of his <hi>determination</hi> of ſending his ſon to Eton. Folly, thy name is <hi>Woman.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Lordy,</hi> as they ſtyle the Peers' eldeſt ſon in Scotland, had NOTHING of Eton about him when he came out into life. The Editor's kindred had always been Etonians and Oxonians. She does not remember to have heard that any of them turned out fooliſh <hi>vaut-riens.</hi> Mr. Berkeley, like moſt Eton men, was a very excellent rower, as was moſt happily experienced by a party of ladies and gentlemen in his father's boat. Dr. Berkeley, &amp;c. had gone up the river, to dine at Medenham Abbey—ſoon after they had entered the boat to return, a moſt dreadful ſtorm of thunder, lightning, and rain came on. Some of the ladies were much terrified; which Mr. Berkeley perceiving, ſaid to Mr. Wrightſon, <q rend="inline">"Come, John, give me your oar;"</q> and the Editor fears to ſet down in how ſhort a time Mr. Berkeley, and his father's gardener, formerly a moſt excellent waterman, now an helpleſs aged almſhouſe-man at Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, rowed eleven miles—the boat ſeemed to fly. But Mr. Berkeley exerted himſelf ſo violently, (happily for the party, for, within ten minutes after their landing, the ſtorm became frightfully tremendous indeed,) that he could ſcarce uſe his elegant, aſtoniſhingly ſtrong fingers for three days after.—Mr. Monck Berkeley, and ſeveral of the Monck family, have that ſort of fingers which ſeem as if they have neither ſinews or bone in them, but, when called into action, feel like iron. The Editor uſed frequently to requeſt her ſon, when he had given her his hand, feeling like peeling ſattin, to <hi>ſtiffen</hi> it, which he would inſtantly do; and ſhe conceives that no two men, without he choſe it, could have unbent it. Neither his father nor his brother had their fingers ſo wonderfully formed by nature.</note>. begged Mr.
<pb n="cccxlvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:358"/>
Hamilton to reject his ſuit, and leave him on the
terraſs. One day, ſeeing Mr. Hamilton preparing to ſail,
<pb n="cccxlvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:359"/>
he ſcreamed, <q rend="inline">"Oh! dear Jemmy, pray take me with
you."</q>—<q rend="inline">"No, I muſt not; your Mamma is afraid
you will be drowned."</q> Mr. Berkeley immediately
walked into the Thames in his petticoats, being then little
more than three years old, and purſued the boat. Mr.
Hamilton, inſtantly putting back, aſked him, if he was not
afraid of being drowned, as he muſt have been if he had
not put back. The ſpirited little creature replied, <q rend="inline">"Aye,
aye; <hi>but I conſidered,</hi> before I walked in, that you would
<hi>certainly</hi> come back and take me before the water got up
to my chin, becauſe Mamma would have been <hi>ſo</hi> grieved
if I had been drowned."</q> The ſame ſound judgement and
reſolute ſpirit accompanied him through life.</p>
               <p>A Scotch gentleman of conſequence one day, at St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,
ſaid to Dr. Berkeley, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I laſt night ſaw your agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Son as <hi>fou</hi> with water as moſt of the company were
with wine."</q> Dr. Berkeley, who himſelf drank nothing
but water, expreſſed his wonder at it. Mrs. Berkeley, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the gentleman was a dealer in the marvellous, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
it to her Son in that way; to which he replied,
<q rend="inline">"Yes, my dear Madam, it is very true; I am often as
drunk with water as others are with wine; with this,
however very material difference, that when it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to break bottles, glaſſes, and burn chairs, tables,
&amp;c. I inſtantly become as ſober as a judge, and have
ſometimes prevented much miſchief."</q>

When Mr. Berkeley entered at the univerſity of St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,
one of the college officers called upon him to depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
a crown to pay for the windows he might break. Mr.
Berkeley ſaid, that <q rend="inline">"as he ſhould reſide in his Father's
houſe, it was little likely he ſhould break any windows,
having never, that he remembered, broke one in his
whole life."</q> He was aſſured that he <hi>would</hi> do it at St.
Andrews. He therefore made the depoſit; the cauſe of
which he ſome time after learned. On the riſing of the
ſeſſion, ſeveral of the ſtudents ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Now for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.
Come, it is time to ſet off; let us ſally forth."</q>
Mr. Berkeley, being called upon, enquired what was to be
done? They, with one voice, replied, <q rend="inline">"Why, to break
every window in college."</q>—<q rend="inline">"For what reaſon?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Oh!
no reaſon; but that it has always been done from time
immemorial."</q> Mr. Berkeley ſedately replied, that he
begged to be excuſed joining the party: having never, when
a <hi>boy</hi> at Eton, and ſometimes with more wine in his head than
was good for him, performed ſuch a <hi>valiant</hi> feat, he ſhould feel
himſelf exceedingly aſhamed to be guilty of it as a <hi>young man.</hi>
He ſpoke ſo ſenſibly on the ſubject, that the practice was
from that time entirely given up, and has probably never
been revived. The money continued to be collected, as the
following little aneodote will ſhew. A very good kind of man,
formerly coachman at Lord Balcarras's, the College Porter,
was the collector. He one day told a very intimate friend of
Mr. Berkeley's, the young Laird of Kincaldrum, <q rend="inline">"I am juſt
<pb n="cccxlix" facs="tcp:0761700600:361"/>
come from a poor ſtudent indeed. I went for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<hi>croon;</hi> he cried, begged, and prayed not to pay it,
ſaying, 'he brought but a croon to keep him all the
ſeſſion, and he had ſpent ſix-pence of it; ſo I have got
only four and ſix-pence.' How he is to live I can't
tell, for they are very poor."</q> Away flew the amiable
young Laird, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"I muſt make a collection for him."</q>
Amongſt the ſtudents he firſt met Mr. Halket, eldeſt ſon of
Sir J. Halket, a beloved Scotch friend of Mr. Monck
Berkeley. This charming youth ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Here, take theſe
few ſhillings; it is <hi>all</hi> I have till I hear from home
again."</q> The young Laird ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Such an one will give
a ſhilling, and ſuch an one half a crown; and <hi>I</hi> will <hi>make</hi>
my dear Berkeley give a crown."</q> The idea of his ſaying
<hi>make,</hi> diverted the whole univerſity, who all knew Mr.
Berkeley's wonderful liberality to the poor. He ſoon met
Mr. Berkeley, who not only toſſed out the crown, but ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"We will make a <hi>good</hi> collection; go you, Bower, (the
young Laird's name,) to the Scotch, and I to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh."</q>
Mr. Berkeley poſted home, and made his Father,
Mother, and Aunt ſubſcribe largely, as alſo all the Engliſh
gentlemen ſtudents. The ſubſcription, when cloſed, was
a very noble one. This poor youth was the ſon of a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer,
who, having <hi>two</hi> fields, about eight miles from
St. Andrews, kept <hi>three</hi> cows; one cow was ſold to dreſs
him for the Univerſity, and put the <hi>lamented</hi> croon in his
pocket, to purchaſe coals. All the lower ſtudents ſtudy by
<pb n="cccl" facs="tcp:0761700600:362"/>
fire light. He brought with him a large tub of oatmeal,
and a pot of ſalted butter, on which he was to ſubſiſt from
the 20th of October until the 20th of May, the ſpace of
five months, but for this lucky affair of the <hi>croon,</hi> and the
lovely nature of the young Laird of Kincaldrum, as accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
as amiable. In what is called in Scotland an <hi>high
dance,</hi> this young gentleman could keep himſelf more than
half a minute—near a minute—in air. No one, who has
not ſeen a company of Highland ſoldiers dance, can form
<hi>any</hi> idea of it, more than our great-grandſires could of electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
before Dr. Franklin's time.</p>
               <p>The very humane worthy college cook agreed with the
young Laird and Mr. Berkeley to provide him a good din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of fleſh or fiſh through the ſeſſion. The Editor is ſorry
to ſay, ſome of his countrymen ſaid, <q rend="inline">"that it was not <hi>quite
roight</hi> of theſe young gentlemen to make this ſubſcription—they might be made every day."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This brings to the Editor's mind the <hi>indignation</hi> of, ſhe
is very ſorry to ſay, <hi>a Divine,</hi> againſt her Son at Haſtings,
for a ſimilar offence. On the arrival of the three hundred
French clergy, within two days, at Haſtings, Mr. Berkeley
ſaid to his friend Mr. Grimſton, <q rend="inline">"It is impoſſible to let
theſe poor perſecuted ſtrangers ſtarve in a foreign country;
we muſt try and make a ſubſcription for them."</q> Mr.
Grimſton, <hi>jelon ſon coutume,</hi> toſſed down his guinea. Mr.
<pb n="cccli" facs="tcp:0761700600:363"/>
Monck Berkeley cried, <q rend="inline">"Stop, ſtop, my dear friend, not
<hi>ſo</hi> faſt, you will ruin all! No, I will draw up their caſe,
and you and I will ſet down againſt our names half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a-crown
each; half-a-crown cannot diſtreſs any one who
has any thing to give. We may give as much more as
we pleaſe, but ſet down only two ſhillings and ſix-pence."</q>
They accordingly did ſo, and amongſt their acquaintance
got many ſubſcribers. The paper was left at one of the
circulating libraries. The following account was related to
the Editor by a gentleman who was an eye-witneſs of the
tranſaction. The door opened, and a ſtout man entered,
ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Who is <hi>this</hi> MR. BERKELEY, that makes himſelf
of <hi>ſuch</hi> conſequence, <hi>picking people's pockets</hi> for theſe

Berkeley, happening to be in a corner of the library, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
roſe, and, advancing with a very graceful bow, in the
mildeſt voice replied; <q rend="inline">"Sir, Mr. Berkeley is a man of no
ſort of conſequence, nor pretends to be of any; but,
(quoting the Latin line, '<hi>as a man I muſt feel,</hi>' &amp;c.) he felt

retired to his book again, leaving the <hi>oratorical</hi> PARSON

The corpſe was ſoon let down into the grave, which was filled up, when every man took off his hat, bowed at the grave, and the crowd began to diſperſe. Mrs. Berkeley, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſhocked at what ſhe had witneſſed, aſked a very ſenſible intelligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking gentleman, <q rend="inline">"if he could tell her what <hi>could</hi> have <hi>induced ſo very aged</hi> a perſon to have been her own executioner,"</q> (not, as the newſpapers phraſe it, <q rend="inline">"<hi>put a period</hi> to their <hi>exiſtence.</hi>"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Alas! alas! that <hi>they</hi> cannot do.)"</q>—The gentleman replied, <q rend="inline">"did ſhe? poor woman!

At her return to the inn, relating her anxiety on account of the poor good old Scotch woman, and her dialogue at the grave, Doctor and Mr. Berkeley laughed immoderately. Dr. Berkeley uſed frequently to relate it to his Scotch friends at St. Andrew's. Mr. Berkeley uſed to ſay, it was treating their dead friends juſt as we treat favourite dead dogs. Mr. Monck Berkeley always made his father's gardener dig an handſome grave in one of the kitchen gardens, at Cookham, for his dogs; and himſelf uſed to plant two roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees of different ſorts, one at the head, and one at the foot, of their graves, which were always kept nicely turfed; he had wonderful tenderneſs, and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in his <hi>nature.</hi> Dr. Berkeley's carriage, on their journey to Scotland, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently overtook, and was overtaken by, the hearſe, containing the corpſe of the ſenſible, amiable, well-judging, Lord Robert Kerr, who died at Newberry, in Berkſhire, at the age of twenty-eight. His regiment had been quartered at Canterbury ſix years before. His unaſſuming manners, a colonel at <hi>twenty-two,</hi> his attachment to the worthy old grey-headed major, always conſulting him in every thing relating to the regiment, endeared him to all who knew him. The Editor uſed to tell ſeveral worthy Scotch miniſters, that ſhe grieved to think ſweet Lord Robert ſhould be dragged ſo many miles to be buried like an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> dog.</p>
                        <p>Had Mr. Monck Berkeley retained in full force the ideas of his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, they could not have applied to any one <hi>more</hi> likely to aſſiſt them. When under four years old, playing one morning in the dreſſing-room, he, on a ſudden, flew to his Mother, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Oh! Mamma, lay down your work, and <hi>ſee about it.</hi> For there is Dick States, the famous old ſexton of Bray, burying a <hi>poor</hi> little child by <hi>himſelf,</hi> without either my Papa, or Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to pray over it, or Mr. Wells, the clerk, to ſay Amen."</q> This pious accompliſhed Curate of Dr. Berkeley has an exquiſitely accompliſhed ſon, educated at Oxford, who is, the Editor fears, <hi>ſince</hi> Dr. Berkeley's death, a <hi>diſtreſſed</hi> Divine in London. His ſkill in muſic and French, were he not a Divine, muſt have procured him a large ſalary. His father was a wonderfully fine performer on many inſtruments; and had the fineſt voice alſo in preaching and reading, as well as in ſinging, that the Editor ever heard. Mrs. Berkeley told the young <hi>zealot,</hi> that it was ſome poor little infant, that, having died very ſoon after its birth, had not been baptized. The Editor took care to have all her own babes baptized <hi>within</hi> the hour after their birth, leſt a fit ſhould carry them off. Mrs. Berkeley uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her aſtoniſhment to her mother, that ſhe permitted <hi>her</hi> to remain unbaptized ten days after her entrance into this <q rend="inline">"<hi>vale of tears.</hi>"</q> It could for the firſt part of her life, hardly, with propriety, be ſtyled ſuch to her; as, after puſhing forth one ſhort cry, to <hi>notiſy,</hi> as the Scotch phraſe it, that <q rend="inline">"<hi>ſhe was in life;</hi>"</q> as an infant, ſhe <hi>never did cry at all;</hi> which occaſioned a learned <hi>honeſt</hi> phyſician's being conſulted, to know whether ſhe had not <hi>ſome inward</hi> diſorder, that prevented her crying, as infants uſually do. He replied, <q rend="inline">"Not ſhe. She is a pure healthy good-humoured little Puſs; ſo does not plague you, or herſelf, by ſqualiing."</q>—Mr. Berkeley ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Why, Mamma, <hi>you</hi> tell me, that God knows <hi>every</hi> thing <hi>before</hi> it happens. Now, if he <hi>knew</hi> that he <hi>intended</hi> this little child ſhould ſtay ſuch a <hi>very</hi> ſhort time upon earth, <hi>I</hi> think it was <hi>hardly</hi> worth his while to give himſelf the <hi>trouble</hi> to ſend it down here <hi>at all.</hi>"</q> It is needleſs to add here, the Editor's comments to her <hi>little</hi> inquiſitive <hi>ſceptie,</hi> who, if the expreſſion may be permitted, watched GOD's dealings with man with a moſt jealous eye, hoping to eſpy a <hi>flaw.</hi> His <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> on the twenty-ſeventh chapter of Geneſis, which he ſtumbled on, rather than ſearched out for himſelf, finding he had been made to miſs it in his courſe of reading, coſt the Editor <hi>much</hi> trouble to rectify, although ſhe retained an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate remembrance of <hi>every</hi> word of a ſermon preached on <hi>that whole chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> by the late very learned Archdeacon of Berks, Dr. Dodwell, when ſhe was about ſixteen years old.</p>
                     </note> him?"</q>—<hi>Oui certainement.</hi>—<q rend="inline">"<hi>Ah grace, au bon Dieu; quoi, Monſieur,
quoi?</hi>"</q>—Mr. Berkeley ſaid he would ſhew it them. But he went
too far, there was not a French Common Prayer Book to be procured in
<pb n="cccliv" facs="tcp:0761700600:366"/> Haſtings. He therefore moſt amiably took his pen,
and tranſlated the whole of our delightful burial-ſervice into French for
them, excepting the Leſſon and Pſalms, which he ſhewed them in his
Greek Teſtament and Latin Bible. <pb n="ccclv" facs="tcp:0761700600:367"/> They were in
extacies with it. They wiſhed to attend the Marquis to the grave; but feared,
as the French <hi>ever</hi> did, being knocked down by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
Mr. Berkeley aſſured them, the Engliſh were not <hi>ſuch</hi>
ſavages. But all in vain <pb n="ccclvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:368"/> was his rhetoric, unleſs
Monſieur <hi>Berquelée</hi> would
<q rend="inline">"<hi>avoir la bontée</hi>"</q> to walk at their head,
as <hi>chief</hi> mourner for <hi>le cher Marquis;</hi> which, by the
undertaker's omitting to bring a cloak, he did in his <hi>Royal Archer's
coat.</hi> In a letter to his mother, he ſays,
<q rend="inline">"Do think of <hi>your</hi> ſon, marching in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
at the head of three hundred French Prieſts, as chief mourner to a poor
perſecuted French Noble!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>The elegant accompliſhed Biſhop of (the Editor thinks)
Avranches, on quitting the houſe of a very reſpectable
clergyman, who kindly received and entertained him, and
requeſted Mr. Monck Berkeley to viſit and converſe with him,
the gentlemen not ſpeaking French, his gratitude to Mr.
Berkeley, for what his Lordſhip termed his <hi>etonante bonté</hi> to
his poor brethren, and exquiſitely polite attentions to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he declared himſelf at a loſs for words to expreſs.
He conjured Mr. Berkeley, when things were again ſettled
in France, that he would viſit him at his palace. Alas!
thou elegant amiable Prelate—thou wilt probably viſit
Paradiſe before thou doeſt Paris,</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley often mentioned with pleaſure the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and propriety of many of the three hundred clergy.
Not a man would receive a ſhilling who had brought any
money with him: others, who had friends in town, would
only take barely enough to defray the expence of their
journey to London.</p>

Had the Editor time to look over her Son's letters, ſhe
would give his account of the landing of the good old Curate
of Dieppe, aged 84; the farewel between him and his flock
of ſailors. The Editor remembers, Mr. Berkeley ſays, <q rend="inline">"There
was not, I believe, <hi>one</hi> dry eye, Engliſh or French, on
the ſhore. The good old Paſtor is now gone to London.
I have the delight of thinking, that GOD will go with
him <hi>wherever</hi> he goes."</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to the ſubject of dancing, in which the
young Laird of Kincaldrum has been already noticed. How
delightfully do the Scotch dance every thing but a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuet!
The firſt time the Editor ſaw her Son (eſteemed
a very good dancer, having learned in England and
in France for ten years <hi>de ſuite</hi>) dance a country-dance
and cotillon in Scotland, it turned her quite ſick. She
thought he danced like a ploughman, until ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuets
were attempted between the country-dances;
which a little conſoled her. The next morning ſhe
requeſted Mr. Berkeley to let her treat him with a
maſter, that he might learn to dance like a Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
The offer was gratefully accepted; and the very able
Mr. Jenkins attended Mr. Berkeley every day, greatly
to the improvement of Mr. Berkeley, as has been above
mentioned, and exceedingly through his kindneſs, to
the finances of Mr. Jenkins, who, juſt before, or ſoon
after, Mr. Berkeley quitted St. Andrews, by his wiſe
<pb n="ccclviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:370"/>
adviſe, migrated to London, where he attended, by Mr.
Berkeley's recommendation, many young perſons of high
rank and faſhion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley made it a point, when at Oxford, and the
Temple, to ſpend every Chriſtmas vacation with his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.

Mr. Berkeley's dancing at many of their neighbours' houſes,

and of courſe the fathers, of dancing-young-ladies; Mrs.
Berkeley, ſaying, like the old father mentioned by Mr.
Addiſon in the Spectator, that <hi>ſhe</hi> did not feel it right to
invite young ladies to be made WHIRLYGIGS, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting

               </p>
               <p>The very worthy Dr. Lambe, Prebendary of Worceſter,
became Principal of Magdalene Hall not long after Mr.
Berkeley's entering there. He happened to be in the hall
when Dr. Lambe arrived; and moſt of the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
were abſent. Mr. Berkeley inſtantly waited on his
new ſuperior, and with his uſual polite benignity offered
his ſervices in every way in which they could be uſeful.
The Editor recollects to have heard her Son ſay, that,
after certain neceſſary things performed, and dinner ended,
the new Principal aſked Mr. Berkeley, <q rend="inline">"if they ought not
to go to chapel?"</q> to which Mr. Berkeley replied in the
affirmative, <hi>if</hi> they could get a reader, and muſter a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
The Editor thinks it was either the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
or the end of the term, and that there was
only one member in the Hall beſides Mr. Berkeley, who,
<pb n="ccclx" facs="tcp:0761700600:372"/>
ſhe thinks, was the very worthy amiable, now Reverend,
Mr. Sloman, a beloved, reſpected friend of Mr. Berkeley's,
who has frequently delighted the Editor by ſaying, <q rend="inline">"that
he conceived he owed his life to Mr. Berkeley, as did
many other gentlemen at the ſame time."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A party of gentlemen, many of them members of the
Hall, had agreed, that on the firſt fine day they would ſail
down the river ſome miles—the Editor does not recollect
to what place, but thinks it was to Godſtow Abbey. The
party conſiſted of eleven; and Mr. Berkeley, ever delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to give pleaſure to young and old, begged to take with
him a lad, ſon to a lady, a relation of his Mother's, at
home for the holydays. Accordingly, on Eaſter Monday
they ſet out; when they had ſailed two or three miles,
ſome accident happened to the boat; the waterman ſaw it
coming, and threw himſelf out; for which Mr. Berkeley
always, when mentioning it, ſtyled him a ſad villain, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<q rend="inline">"He left the whole number to periſh, for <hi>he</hi> did not
know that any of us could ſwim."</q> The boat inſtantly
overſet; only two of the party could ſwim, Mr. Pearce,
nephew to the late Biſhop of Rocheſter; and Mr. Monck
Berkeley; being both Eton men, they were good ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
and ſoon eſcaped to ſhore, when Mr. Pearce
humanely ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Berkeley, we muſt try to ſave them
all. Let us go in inſtantly."</q> To which Mr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
replied, <q rend="inline">"If we do, we are dead men, Pearce. No,
<pb n="ccclxi" facs="tcp:0761700600:373"/>
we muſt wait till they are more ſpent, or they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
cling ſo faſt, that they will ſink us."</q> This wiſe
advice was followed. Mr. Berkeley firſt reſcued his little
kinſman, as conſidering himſelf in ſome ſort reſponſible
for him, as a lad of eleven years old, of whom he had
taken the charge. After ſome little time, Mr. Pearce and
Mr. Berkeley plunged in, and, by the bleſſing of God,
brought every one ſafe on ſhore. They ſent to Oxford for
coaches, and on their arrival getting rid of their drenched
cloaths, Mr. Berkeley immediately wrote to his Mother,
aſſuring her, that whatever lamentable hiſtory the newſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
might happen to make of it, by the mercy of God, he
had ſtill the happineſs to be able to ſubſcribe himſelf her
dutiful Son, &amp;c. His attentions to the feelings of his
Mother, <q rend="inline">"for an only Son,"</q> were inceſſant. The Editor
had, from his youth, told Mr. Berkeley, that, if he ſhould
be expelled from Eton, or get his name entered in the
Black Book at Oxford, ſhe was very ſure that ſhe ſhould
lie down and die of grief, as ſhe and he verily believed
ſhe would have done. He would frequently through life
ſay, <q rend="inline">"If I do ſo, or ſo, I ſhall kill my Mother."</q> He
is receiving his bleſſed reward. It may perhaps be ſaid,
by thoſe who were intimate in the family, that Mrs.
Berkeley was a kind, obliging Mother<note n="*" place="bottom">The Editor bred up by her mother with an averſion to affectation of <hi>every</hi> ſort or kind, and inſtilling the ſame averſion into her ſon; they never compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented each other, by the poor humble, now <hi>humbled</hi> title of <hi>Mr.</hi> and <hi>Mrs. Berkeley,</hi> when ſpeaking to each other, or of each other, or to thoſe who were acquainted with them; the Editor always telling her Son, that, until <hi>his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> had <hi>ſtood</hi> behind a <hi>counter,</hi> ſhe ſhould never call him any thing but Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, or Monck; for, were ſhe to live to ſee him Lord Chancellor, his <hi>name</hi> would be Berkeley. If, in a large company of friends, Mr. Berkeley ſpoke two or three times to his Mother, and ſhe did not attend to anſwer him; he uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"Well Madam, if you do not liſten to me, I proteſt, I will call you <hi>Mrs. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley;</hi> and that, <hi>I am ſure,</hi> will make you mind me."</q> The Editor's ſenſible, agreeable friend, and <hi>quondam</hi> neighbour, Admiral Sir G<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

to be ſuch after the time ceaſed when ſhe was to
be held up to Mr. Berkeley <hi>in terrorem,</hi> that is, when

rein in early youth, <hi>no</hi> rein at all after a certain period; <hi>no</hi>

never could conceive, that if a young man, or young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
choſe to live ſingle till thirty years old, or till twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five,
or under, that God, ſpeaking by MOSES, or by

the Ducheſs of St. Alban's, who, on her amiable daughter,

The Editor wiſhes it were poſſible for her to do juſtice to the gratitude ſhe feels for the inceſſant unwearied aſſiſtance ſhe receives from that throughly worthy friend, and his two obliging amiable ſons, Meſſrs. White and Thomas Newman. The very grateful father of Mr. Newman, knowing that his father-in-law, the Biſhop, owed all his preferment to Mr. Cherry, and feeling himſelf under perſonal obligations to that excellent man; from their youth, charged his ſons, <q rend="inline">"as they valued a father's bleſſing, never to omit any opportunity that preſented itſelf of rendering every poſſible ſervice in their power, to the deſcendants of Mr. Cherry."</q> The Editor has frequent occaſion to tell her amiable friends in Newgate Street, that they are reſolved to enſure their father and grandfather's bleſſing.

A very intimate, beloved, and reſpected friend
of Mr. Berkeley, a very brilliant genius, whoſe Elegy on
the Death of Dr. Johnſon was univerſally allowed by all
the great judges of poetry to be ſuperior to any publiſhed
on that occaſion—this gentleman, apt ſometimes to be

declaring to all his friends that he was <hi>extremely ill,</hi>
and in a <hi>very bad way.</hi> On Mr. Berkeley's arrival in town,
every common friend began lamenting the unpleaſant ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Up he ſprang, rang his bell, told his ſervant that he muſt
dreſs that minute, for that he was going with Mr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
to the Opera. Accordingly Mr. Berkeley eſcorted him
thither in triumph, to the great joy, and no ſmall diverſion,
of his <hi>numerous</hi> friends; for he is exceedingly amiable.
The next day, in the Hall, Mr. Berkeley was complimented
on his ſkill as a <hi>phyſician.</hi> Another very ludicrous anecdote
of Mr. Berkeley's extricating the ſame friend from a diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
ſituation, ſome time after this, might be related.
It is certain, that Mr. Berkeley, after he grew up a man,
never undertook the management of any difficult affair,
that he did not accompliſh it to the ſatisfaction of all the
parties concerned. Not long after Mr. Monck Berkeley's
arrival at St. Andrew's, he went one afternoon to the ſhop
of the (to St. Andrew's ſtudents) well-known Mungo Dick.
To his no ſmall ſurprize, it was ſhut up. He knocked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly;
at length a neighbour appeared; and Mr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
<pb n="ccclxx" facs="tcp:0761700600:382"/>
enquired, whether Mungo was broke and run-away.—<q rend="inline">"No

It were ſurely wiſe to <hi>try</hi> the old Doctor. One <hi>Scotch</hi> couſin is worth fifty <hi>Engliſh</hi> ones, as we ſee every day. Dr. Berkeley was very urgent with the late Lord Camden to obtain an appointment for a Scotchman, for whom he had the goodneſs to be intereſted. Lord Camden, very politely and honeſtly, <hi>flatly</hi> refuſed it in the following words: <q rend="inline">"I ſhould rejoice to pay attention to Dr. Berkeley; and for any <hi>Engliſhman I will do it.</hi> But I have many years ago ſworn that I <hi>never</hi> will introduce a Scotchman into any office; for, if <hi>you</hi> introduce <hi>one, he</hi> will contrive ſome way or other to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>forty</hi> more couſins or friends."</q> Would James the Firſt have acted by a <hi>Scot,</hi> as good Queen Mary and Queen Anne did by a very worthy relation of theirs, a Mr. Holden, who was many years clerk to old Mr. Cherry, the Counſellor?

Queen Anne allowed his aged mother twenty pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> and ſhe went to Court once in the year in her new grey gown, (ſhe was a widow;) and her Majeſty always <hi>ſpoke</hi> kindly to her, and called her Couſin HOLDEN.

Sir, ſo men always lock their doors, that nobody
may ever <hi>ſay</hi> they have <hi>ſeen</hi> them <hi>do it.</hi>"</q> Mr. Berkeley
called aloud, and vowed vengeance if he did not leave off
beating her. Mr. Berkeley went the next day, and gave
him <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>lecture,</hi> as prevented his chaſtizing her again
during Mr. Berkeley's <hi>ſéjour</hi> at St. Andrew's. On the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's
aſking her Son, if he thought he would mind what
ſuch a youth as he could ſay? Mr. Berkeley replied, very

ſeriouſly, <q rend="inline">"I <hi>hope he</hi> will, for I made him heartily aſhamed

               </p>
               <p>At the age of nineteen, Mr. Berkeley had the honour
of being elected a correſponding member of the Society of
Antiquaries in Edinburgh, in conſequence of a very accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
ſenſible account, tranſmitted to that Society, of a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
quarry of marble, diſcovered ſome years ago in the
heart of the Highlands. It had ſome curious particularities,
but of what nature they were the Editor does not recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect:
probably they were not underſtood by <hi>her,</hi> although
ſo excellently inveſtigated and deſcribed by her Son. She,
however, means to preſent that Society with a valuable

Mr. Berkeley was a member of the Royal Archers; and
during the war in 1783 a number of Scotch gentlemen of
rank and faſhion formed themſelves into a corps. The Editor
thinks they were ſtyled The Royal Edinburgh Volunteers.
Mr. Berkeley accepted a commiſſion. They were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
once, if not more, to aſſiſt in quelling a riot, the
mob being employed in demoliſhing ſome mills, when
flour was little more than half its preſent price. This oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
a gentleman's aſking Mr. Berkeley if he had
thoughts of going into the army; on which he replied,
<q rend="inline">"No, Sir; I am much indebted to the wiſdom of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

the excellent Lady Iſabella Monck, the highly reſpected
mother of the Marchioneſs, ever ſince ſhe had the honour
of being connected with her Ladyſhip by her union with

               <p>On Dean Swift's introducing Mr. (afterwards Bp.) Berkeley
to the then Earl of Berkeley, it was in this ſingular way:
<q rend="inline">"My Lord, here is a fine young gentleman of your family. I
can aſſure your Lordſhip, it is a much greater honour to
<hi>you</hi> to be related to him, than it is to him to be related
to you."</q> The Earl of Berkeley was then Lord High
Admiral of England, the laſt nobleman who had that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
which ſome of his deſcendants pleaded as the cauſe
of their great pride—ſome of the uncommonly ſenſible
grandſons of the Honourable Colonel Berkeley. A perſon,
whoſe name was not originally Berkeley, one day talking to
one of the moſt amiable of thoſe brothers, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"My dear

                     </gap>, what is the cauſe that <hi>you</hi> BERKELEYS are ſo

no man of ſo ancient, ſo noble a family as yours has
cauſe for ſuch apprehenſion from perſons of ſenſe, if it
is not <hi>his own</hi> fault."</q> St. Paul, ſpeaking by the Holy
Spirit to Timothy, ſays, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Let no man deſpiſe thee.</hi>"</q> It is
therefore <hi>abſolutely</hi> in our own power to prevent our being
<pb n="ccclxxxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:394"/>
                  <hi>deſpiſed.</hi> It is one thing to diſlike to <hi>hate,</hi> and another to
<hi>deſpiſe.</hi> The inſpired Writer therefore does not ſay, <q rend="inline">"let no
man hate thee, or perſecute;"</q> but <q rend="inline">"let no man <hi>deſpiſe</hi>
thee,"</q> is a command given from an aged to a young
Biſhop. There are countries where, perhaps, the younger
Prelates might ſo admoniſh the elders to their profit. To
the admoniſher of Mr. C. Berkeley, when ſaying, that no
perſons of <hi>ſenſe</hi> would deſpiſe him, &amp;c. might, had he
known it, have retorted the famous Dr. Rock's anſwer to
Sir Edward Holſe, Phyſician to his late Majeſty, who,
driving one day down the Strand, was ſtopped by the mob,
liſtening to the oratory of Dr. Rock in his gaudy equipage.
Seeing Sir Edward Hulſe look out at his chariot window,
he inſtantly took a quantity of boxes and vials, gave them
to one of his <hi>belaced</hi> lacqueys, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Give my compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Sir Edward; tell him, theſe are all I have with
me, but I will ſend him ten dozen more to-morrow."</q>
Sir Edward, aſtoniſhed at the meſſage, and effrontery of
the man, actually took them into his chariot; on which
the mob, with one conſent, all cried out, <q rend="inline">"See, ſee, all
the Doctors, even the King's, <hi>buy</hi> their medicines of him."</q>
In their youth, they had ſomewhere been fellow ſtudents;
Rock, not ſucceeding in a regular way, metamorphoſed
himſelf into a <hi>Quack.</hi> In the afternoon he waited on Sir
Edward, to beg his pardon for having played him ſuch a
trick: to which Sir Edward replied, <q rend="inline">"My old friend, how
can a man of your underſtanding condeſcend to harangue
<pb n="ccclxxxiii" facs="tcp:0761700600:395"/>
the populace with ſuch nonſenſe as you talked to-day.
Why, none but fools liſten to you."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Ah! my good
friend, <hi>that</hi> is the <hi>very thing.</hi> Do you give <hi>me</hi> the FOOLS
for <hi>my</hi> patients, and you ſhall have <hi>my free leave</hi> to <hi>keep</hi> the
people of SENSE for <hi>your own.</hi>"</q> This anecdote of theſe
two different Doctors was related to the Editor by a medical
friend of great eminence, who had often heard Sir Edward
Hulſe relate it to divert his friends, adding, <q rend="inline">"I never felt ſo
like a fool in my life, as when I received the bottles and
boxes from Rock."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley felt himſelf much indebted for numberleſs
polite amiable attentions from Lord Durraghmore; for
which he was probably indebted entirely to his <hi>own perſonal</hi>
merit, and the great good ſenſe of that young Nobleman,
to whom, ſhould he chance to read this, it may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be unpleaſant to obſerve, what Mr. Berkeley's Father
once ſaid to the Editor, on her ſaying, <q rend="inline">"How very lucky
Berkeley is, in becoming acquainted with ſo many learned
men, ſo much his ſuperiors in years and knowledge!"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Lucky;
to be ſure he is <hi>lucky</hi> if you <hi>call it ſo,</hi> in having
an underſtanding that <hi>muſt</hi> make him admired by thoſe
who have very ſuperior underſtandings themſelves; <hi>that</hi>
is the <hi>luck</hi> of it."</q> They did not, perhaps, as Mr. Berkeley;
who, having dined out in a large company, at his return
aſked his Mother, if ſhe was acquainted with a young Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet,
<pb n="ccclxxxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:396"/>
whom he named; ſhe replied, <q rend="inline">"Yes, that ſhe had
known his mother very well."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"<hi>I</hi> am reſolved to become acquainted with
him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. B.—<q rend="inline">"Why?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"Becauſe two of the moſt empty fox-hunting
coxcombs I ever met with have been laughing at, and
abuſing him to the company all the afternoon; ſo <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi>
he is a man of ſenſe and worth."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley alſo felt himſelf much obliged, as the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
does, by the very polite friendly attentions of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Honourable relation Sackville Hamilton, Eſquire, of
Dublin Caſtle. He felt himſelf flattered by the attentions
of the learned Reverend William Hamilton, B.D. who
preſented to him his very curious entertaining work, printed
during Mr. Berkeley's reſidence in Ireland. In his return
from Ireland, by the way of Scotland, he made ſome little
ſtay with his amiable old intimate friend, Sir William
Morres, at his ſeat in the county of <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

He could not contrive to reach the houſe of his
learned friend, Mr. Taylor of Noan. Several tranſlations
from the Greek Poets of this gentleman's were publiſhed
when he was about nineteen.</p>

                  <pb n="ccclxxxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:397"/>
In a letter to his Father, whilſt in Ireland, he ſays,
<q rend="inline">"My Grandfather and Swift are ſtill remembered with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley having been always told by his Father,
that Dean Swift was the introducer of his Grandfather when
he came young into England, to the learned and the great,
occaſioned his, from a boy, being a great admirer of that
wonderful man, and his ſo zealouſly labouring to vindicate
his fame in the Preface to his Literary Relics from ſome
horridly falſe aſperſions, and palliating his <hi>ſad</hi> conduct to
Stella and Vaneſſa<note n="*" place="bottom">Unleſs it is allowed, what the Editor herſelf <hi>firmly</hi> believes, from what ſhe learned from Dr. Berkeley's very old beloved friend, Dean Delany—that both Dean Swift and Mrs. Johnſon were actually the children of Sir William Temple, and the heavy tidings arrived not until the day on which the indiſſoluble knot was tied. Surely a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Court ought to have power to ſet ſuch unfortunate perſons at liberty. Some years ago the eldeſt ſon of a gentleman of great eſtate was exceedingly in love with an heireſs of large fortune: the father threw cold water on it—the old gentleman perſiſted in refuſing to give his conſent—at length, violently urged by his ſon to find an objection to an accompliſhed, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, rich heireſs, he replied, <q rend="inline">"You d<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

She early in life became a widow. The laſt time the Editor ſaw her, there appeared a ſort of melancholy reſtleſſneſs, that could not fail to diſtreſs every feeling heart that knew the cauſe. This lady had every thing <hi>this</hi> world could furniſh, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce happineſs; two fine children, a ſon and daughter, both magnificently provided for. But ſhe had not the ſociety of the only man on earth whom ſhe could love. She ſaw him happy with another. Had ſhe learned to <hi>feel,</hi> as well as ſay, <q rend="inline">"Thy will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven,"</q> it had been happy for her; had ſhe humbly, patiently ſubmitted, inſtead of ſadly murmuring, and ſadly cavilling, as ſhe uſed alaſs! to do at ſome parts of Scripture. But what piety was it likely ſhould be inſtilled into her mind by her <hi>direfully</hi> ADULTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUS MOTHER, who was not ſuſpected until this affair of the match.</note>. Mr. Berkeley was not in England
<pb n="ccclxxxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:398"/>
when that book was publiſhed; but a copy, by his order
to his bookſeller, was ſent to every member of his family.
On his arrival in England, he immediately paid his duty
at his Father's; and, after dinner one day, ſaid to his
Mother, that he hoped ſhe had received the Literary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics,
which he had ordered to be ſent to her before they
were publiſhed.</p>
               <p>She replied, <q rend="inline">"that ſhe was much obliged by his attention."</q>

To which Mr. Berkeley, in a ſweet melancholy voice,
replied, <q rend="inline">"Ah, my dear Mother, don't ſay ſo! I have not
defended his wrong conduct: I have only ſaid all that
my conſcience would ſuffer me to ſay in extenuation of
it. You know his kindneſs to my Grandfather in his
youth, when he came firſt to England. It grieves me
that you ſay that <hi>I</hi> ſhould be your Prime Counſel."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley ſhewed his gratitude in another inſtance
to Dean Swift. During his ſhort <hi>ſéjour</hi> in Dublin, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
that the old ſervant, Mr. Richard Brinan, in whoſe
arms Dean Swift expired, was poor as well as aged: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
him, and ordered his Father's agent to pay him a
ſmall ſum every month, to lighten the <hi>unavoidable</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of old age; which <hi>needs</hi> not the aid of POVERTY, to
render it unpleaſant. Dr. Berkeley continued this annuity,
as does the Editor; at leaſt, ſhe truſts, that the poor
man receives it, as ſhe ſees it conſtantly in her accounts;
ſhe hopes, for his ſake, it is not as difficult to get a ſmall
ſum paid <hi>in</hi> Ireland, as it is to get <hi>any</hi> ſum out of it.</p>
               <p>It has, perhaps, been before mentioned, that Mr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley

which the Editor never ſaw until it was printed, or ſhe had
certainly made it a point with her obedient Son; as in another

begged him off, on account of his worthy family, with whom

to ſay, <q rend="inline">"No man ſhall maltreat my Father whilſt I can hold

to read the grateful mention of his Father in the <hi>curious</hi> life
of Biſhop Horne, he had certainly reſented it as it merits
to be reſented. Dr. Berkeley was a too generous friend to
numbers, whoſe preſent pride and covetouſneſs has quite
obliterated from their minds the poverty from which the
amiable generoſity of Dr. Berkeley long ſince reſcued them.

HE is gone to receive his reward: THEY muſt in due time
follow to receive theirs.</p>
               <p>It has been mentioned, that Mr. Berkeley, in his firſt
nove, "The Generous Ruſtic," has ſhewn his love and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to the French friends of his early youth. In his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
"The Spaniſh Memoirs," many of the characters are
the real ones of Engliſh and Scotch friends and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
In that of Father Alberto, the reader is made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the very ſenſible, highly accompliſhed, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
entertaining, polite, pious, Biſhop Geddes, who
had ſpent many years as a Biſhop in New Spain, and has
often delighted the Editor, when viſiting at Dr. Berkeley's,
with accounts of the wonderfully affectionate, reſpectful
attachment the amiable Peruvians ſtill retain for their Inca
and his royal progeny, ſupplying him with fiſh, veniſon, game,
&amp;c.; and the ſtratagems the Spaniards were obliged to employ
to convey the then Inca from New to Old Spain, where
he is a grandee. His two ſons hold conſiderable rank in
the King of Spain's guards; they are fine young men,
although one draws a ſigh over their reverſed fortune.
They are, perhaps, happier to <hi>guard,</hi> than to be <hi>guarded.</hi> The
Editor has often liſtened with delight to accounts of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
related to have paſſed between the Inca and himſelf
<hi>tête à tête</hi> in old Spain, al hough the Inca is not a man of
very ſhining abilities, perhaps, for politic reaſons, very little
<pb n="cccxc" facs="tcp:0761700600:402"/>
cultivated. He was not dead to what he was, nor to what
he ought to have been.</p>
               <p>This excellently wiſe, mild Prelate, by the great wiſdom of
the then Pontiff, replaced the <hi>flaming</hi> Popiſh Biſhop, who
preſided over the Roman Catholics of Edinburgh, when the
zeal of John Knox's diſciples burned down the chapel, to
the great diſtreſs of the amiable liberal Dr. Robertſon, the
worthy witty Dr. Webſter, father of the excellent Colonel
Webſter, the agreeable Dr. Carlyle, and many other
worthy Scottiſh miniſters of Edinburgh. On that occaſion
the zealots of the party exhibited a caricature print, of
which the Editor has a copy, of Dr. Johnſon's beloved
"<hi>Willy Robertſon,</hi>" with the triple crown on his head, a
label, &amp;c. &amp;c. May that ſenſible, agreeable head be now
more ſuitably crowned!</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley's ſuperiority of underſtanding led him to
feel great gratitude for Biſhop Goddes's devoting ſo much
of his time to Mr. Berkeley when in Edinburgh in vacation
time. He felt that it was condeſcenſion in a very learned
man of between fifty and ſixty, to ſay to a youth of nineteen,

               <p>Mention has been made before, of Mr. Berkeley's being
ſent, when he was little more than ſix years old, to town,
to get a tooth inſpected by that very honeſt dentiſt, the
late Mr. Hemmet, who happened to be out of town.
The amiable friend who took the charge of him ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"Well, we will go to Mr. Beardmore, or ſome other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
man."</q> To which Mr. Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"No, Sir;
if you pleaſe, I will go to no other; for I heard my
Mamma tell you, that Hemmet was the beſt; <hi>and I am
ſure</hi> SHE knows; and I will go to him."</q> This occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
his being detained a few days longer in town; and
his wiſe kind hoſt, fearing that a child, who lived all day
in the open air, might ſuffer in town, ſent him every day
to walk in the Park with his own worthy careful valet de
chambre. This man, happening to be intimate with the
gentleman of the late excellent Lord Berkeley of Stratton,
one day, in returning from the Park, called in Berkeley
Square with Mr. Berkeley in his hand, who, of courſe,
<pb n="cccxciv" facs="tcp:0761700600:406"/>
went into the ſteward's or houſekeeper's room, where his
ſweetly engaging manners ſoon ſo won the hearts of all
preſent, that they aſked his kind guardian permiſſion to
lead him up, to ſhew him to Lord Berkeley and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Mrs. Anne Egerton. He was introduced as the little
grandſon of the great Biſhop Berkeley. His noble relation
was charmed with the great good ſenſe and propriety of
the little man; and, after he had been there a ſhort time,
his ſenſible guardian telling him it was time to go home, he
roſe, made a very graceful bow<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Berkeley followed the example of his learned Father, who, from the time that his Sons put on the habits of men, uſed, after dinner, to make them practiſe, over and over, coming in and going out of a room gracefully, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q rend="inline">"Every man and woman you ſee is a judge of thoſe things; therefore learn to do it like gentlemen."</q> Dr. Berkeley and his ſon were both very apt ſcholars; and it has been repeatedly remarked to the Editor, how very gracefully both Dr. and Mr. Berkeley came into a room, as if they had both learned of the ſame dancing-maſter. They had, in fact, learnt of the ſame maſter, the learned Prelate, who was remarkably attentive to the <hi>minutiae</hi> with his Sons, as well as to their Latin, Greek, and letter-writing; always ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Learn to write letters properly on all occaſions. Many people may hear your letters redde, that will never hear you ſpeak <hi>vivâ voce.</hi>"</q> When Dr. Berkeley was a boy, about eight years old, he worried his Father to let him go out with him to ſome Viſitation, for three or four days. The good Prelate not underſtanding, with all his learning, the management of boys as well as his Grandſon's Mother, and having no mind his little Boy ſhould accompany him, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Well, if in theſe two days you can make me eight Latin verſes (the Editor thinks it was) you ſhall go with me"</q>—be it what it might, the Prelate knew, or thought he knew, that the poor child <hi>could not</hi> do it. Dr. Berkeley has often told the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that it was what he had never done, had never been taught to do; but, wild to go this journey, he ſet his aſtoniſhingly quick wits to work, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the eight lines, or verſes, in due time. On his preſenting them, the Biſhop exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Well, George, you have been too many for me; I did not think it poſſible you could have done it; but, as you have done it, I muſt keep my word, and ſo you muſt go."</q> The Editor uſed to tell Dr. Berkeley, that "<hi>ſhe</hi> was angry with the Biſhop for being ſuch an Aegyptian taſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter to a <hi>poor</hi> little creature; for no mortal in the houſe could aſſiſt him but his father. Why could he not have at once taken the beautiful little creature, or told him that he <q rend="inline">"<hi>muſt not go?</hi>"</q> Dr. Berkeley was eſteemed the moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant writer of Latin of any of his contemporaries at the Univerſity, as the Editor has repeatedly heard Meſſrs. Hamilton, Whitaker, Biſhop Horne, ſay. Some excellent, aged ſcholar, (name not recollected,) ſaid to every one, that Dr. Berkeley's Latin ſpeech, when he was Collector, was the beſt he had ever heard during his twenty years reſidence at the Univerſity.</note> to the Lady, and then
<pb n="cccxcv" facs="tcp:0761700600:407"/>
to my Lord, who, untying his purſe, was preſenting him
with five guineas, to buy him a fine horſe, ſaddle, &amp;c.
at the toy-ſhop; Mr. Berkeley having told him, that he
had a <hi>live</hi> horſe at Cookham. His worthy guardian ſtepped
up, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"I muſt beg your Lordſhip to excuſe Maſter
Berkeley. He muſt not take it. His Mamma never
ſuffers him to take a guinea, or a ſix-pence, from <hi>my</hi>
Maſter, when ſtaying there for months, not even from
his Grandmother or his Aunt, telling him how <hi>ſhamefully
mean</hi> it is to accept money from any one but his <hi>own</hi>
Parents, when they are at hand."</q> This injunction was
withdrawn when Mr. Berkeley went to Eton, near an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
miles from his Father's houſe; that then, if any old
friend of his family called, and <hi>tipped</hi> him a guinea or two,
he might accept it; as his Father and Mother had often
<hi>tipped</hi> the ſons of their friends. He then declined it, telling
<pb n="cccxcvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:408"/>
his Mother, <q rend="inline">"I don't like it <hi>ſomehow,</hi> not having been
uſed to it; and John Hayes (his amiable relation) is a
good-natured fellow, and will always lend me a guinea
whenever I aſk him, till I ſee my Father or John."</q> A
Gentleman once expreſſed his aſtoniſhment to Dr. Berkeley,
that, calling at Eton, to ſee Mr. Berkeley, he could not
perſuade him to accept money.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Berkeley, having always a dread of her children's
being led to practiſe <hi>any</hi> meanneſs, of <hi>any</hi> kind, never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
either of them to receive <hi>any</hi> ſum, ſmall or great,
from <hi>any</hi> one but Dr. Berkeley or herſelf: from either Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
they were at <hi>full</hi> liberty to receive as much as ever their
<hi>eloquence</hi> could <hi>extract.</hi> The Editor, from early youth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
declared, <q rend="inline">"However well ſhe might like a <hi>ſmart</hi> cap,
or elegant gown, that ſhe would much rather wear an
old gown, and a ruſty cloak, as ſhe does at preſent, than
not pay the butcher, baker, &amp;c. every Monday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</q>
The doing that, in theſe <hi>bleſſed times</hi> of <hi>plenty,</hi> is
hardly ſufficient; and ſuch is the ſhameful ſelfiſh covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of moſt Engliſh traders in that claſs, that they make
thoſe pay to the full as much for their commodities,
who pay every <hi>ſeventh</hi> day, as thoſe who do or do <hi>not</hi>
pay after <hi>ſeven</hi> years credit. In Scotland, the traders, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in general the rudeſt in the world, excepting the
Dutch; if you pay ready money, twenty pounds or thirty
pence, they always throw you back a conſiderable diſcount,
<pb n="cccxcvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:409"/>
as did always the late Mr. Goodchild, the great linen-dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
at Charing Croſs. The Editor, when buying, at St.
Andrews, even a common chequered apron, for <q rend="inline">"a <hi>pure auld
gewd weef,</hi>"</q> value half a crown, has repeatedly had three
halfpenny worth of white ſilk, nicely folded in paper, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to her by the very worthy, really reſpectable Dean
of Guild Kaye, the firſt ſhop in St. Andrews, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Be
pleaſed, Madam, to take your diſcount; I will not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
you with halfpence."</q> He had been long enough in
England to learn the civility of our traders, not long enough
to learn their cunning, of making thoſe who do pay, pay
for thoſe who do not. Whilſt Dr. Berkeley's family was
at St. Andrews, they were told by ſeveral of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
that a certain Earl, who has a manſion near Perth,
one day walked in, and purchaſed half a guinea's worth of
tea and ſugar, laid down the money on the counter, which
the grocer took, and put into the till. The Earl aſked,
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Where is my diſcount?</hi>"</q>—<q rend="inline">" Oh! my Lord, I thought your
Lordſhip had lived ſo much in England that you would
not take it."</q>—<q rend="inline">"NOT TAKE IT! I have not lived long
enough in England to learn their FOOLISH cuſtoms."</q> This
nobleman is remarkable for a ſtrong underſtanding; was
educated at Weſtminſter and Chriſt Church College, Oxford;
and, being a moſt able ſpeaker in the Houſe, would do the
<hi>honeſt</hi> part of Engliſh gentry and traders an eſſential ſervice,
if he could introduce this wiſe Scottiſh cuſtom South of the
Tweed. The Editor has one Scottiſh friend, who reſides
<pb n="cccxcviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:410"/>
much in England, who conſtantly, when he purchaſes any
thing, puts the caſh or notes in a paper, writes on it what
it is to pay, and conſtantly keeps it in his deſk twelve
months, becauſe the Engliſh traders will not allow him
diſcount, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"that they are a ſet of raſcals for not
doing it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After Mr. Berkeley grew up, ſome one, ſpeaking highly,
and juſtly, as he deſerved, of Lord Berkeley of Stratton,
Mr. Monck Berkeley ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I am ſure he was a good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured

               <p>Major Berkeley has a younger brother, a very uncommonly
ſenſible man; in mind, not perſon, a genuine Berkeley.
On the famous 27th of July every man between himſelf
and the Earldom of Berkeley were engaged in <hi>actual</hi>
ſervice. The Honourable George Berkeley, only brother
of Lord Berkeley; Captain Velters Cornwall Berkeley, of the
Navy; Major Lionel Berkeley; and Major James, above
named. Should Mr. George Berkeley marry a Lady
with a mind like his own, their offspring may diſcover
what is <hi>tranſacting</hi> in the ſtars diſcovered by Dr. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchel.
<pb n="ccccii" facs="tcp:0761700600:414"/>
Mr. George Berkeley has, as the Editor uſed to tell
Dr. Berkeley and her Son—they had eyes that could ſee an
inſect a mile off. A learned friend of the Editor, not
ſhort-ſighted, uſed to ſay of his Lady, <q rend="inline">"<hi>She</hi> can ſee a <hi>crow</hi>
upon a church-ſteeple when I cannot ſee the <hi>ſteeple.</hi>"</q> It
muſt, ſurely, be very pleaſant to be bleſſed with ſuch eyes.
The Editor was always anxious to find out, when infants,
whether her children had their dear Father's fine eyes, or
their mother's. Both could, like Mr. George Berkeley
and their Father, ſee the mountains in the moon.</p>
               <p>This very ſenſible young Divine once, when ſtaying at
Dr. Berkeley's; the Editor, ſeeing him very careleſs of his
health, ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"If you don't take more care of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
Berkeley will come to the title at <hi>laſt.</hi>"</q> He briſkly
replied, <q rend="inline">"Surely, I think, there are enough of <hi>us</hi> to keep
your ſon from it."</q> The Editor well remembers to have
frequently heard her very ſenſible, agreeable, intimate
friend, Mrs. Jones, ſiſter to the preſent highly worthy, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Marquis of Wincheſter, ſay, that <q rend="inline">"When he was a
little boy of five or ſix years old, and intimate friend of his

George, this little white head of thine will one day wear a
coronet: I am old, and ſhall not live to ſee it; but, <hi>I
promiſe thee,</hi> thou wilt one day be Marquis of Wincheſter."</q>
The preſent HONOUR to that very ancient title was then the
<hi>ſeventh</hi> from it. The manner in which his Lady's <hi>wiſe</hi>

father recommended it to her, with her vaſt fortune, to
marry Mr. George Pawlett, then a younger brother, does
him more honour than even his very ancient title promiſed
to him by the old lady. In this inſtance it can hardly be
urged that preſcience is unpleaſant; for a coronet, if honourably
obtained, is no <hi>unpleaſant</hi> prediction. Yet, how merciful is
God! in hiding from his creatures the FUTURE, unleſs <hi>by fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing</hi>

1760, and ſeveral ſubſequent years, in concealing from the

great uncle to the preſent Lord Aylesford, being told

<hi>miſerable anxiety;</hi> but did <hi>not</hi> prevent his being killed the

Mrs. Berkeley takes this opportunity of returning her
grateful acknowledgements to many amiable acquaintances
at Cheltenham, at the time of Dr. Berkeley's long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement,
after the extreme danger of his illneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Major André, and the delightfully ſenſible, highly cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated

Mrs. Wells of Cheltenham; the Editor's old friend, the

an old friend of Dr. Berkeley's; and his very learned brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law's
old friend Mrs. Boſwell, ſiſter of Lord Bellamont,
and the highly accompliſhed agreeable Miſs Boſwells.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Monck Berkeley's arrival at Cheltenham, little
ſociety could be kept up; but the attentions of the worthy
Captain Abbot and his Lady at the next door, to prevent
extraordinary noiſe in the houſe or court, are gratefully
remembered; and the unwearied, polite, tender attentions
during Mr. Berkeley's ſhort life, and the polite, tender, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
after his lamented deceaſe, of the very learned
accompliſhed Mr. Dunſter, and his elegant lady, were
moſt gratefully felt by Dr. Berkeley, and will be for ever
regiſtered in the retentive memory of the Editor.</p>

It has been mentioned, that Mr. Berkeley never went
out but twice at Cheltenham: he had therefore never the
pleaſure of converſing with Mr. Dunſter; which he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
for he was a great admirer of his writings<note n="*" place="bottom">Some days after Mr. Berkeley's arrival at Cheltenham, he one day ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Who is this Mr. Dunſter, that you all ſeem to like ſo much?"</q> On being told, he exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Mercy on me! is it <hi>that</hi> Mr. Dunſter indeed, that you have <hi>got here?</hi>"</q> So ſaying, he rang his bell, took out his key, and ordered his ſervant to bring down his poems, all then written out fair for the preſs. When the book came down, he deſired the Editor to carry it <hi>immediately</hi> to Mr. Dunſter, with the following meſſage: <q rend="inline">"His compliments that he had ſent the manuſcript volume for Mr. Dunſter to peruſe, on this <hi>ſole</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he would, <hi>ſans cérémonie,</hi> mark whatever he thought might be amended."</q> Mrs. Berkeley ſaying ſhe would get her hat and cloak, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Beſt of mothers, pray go as you are; <hi>you know very well</hi> that you <hi>race</hi> all over the garden at Cookham, and down the Southcote Walk, to give your orders to the gardener, and do not catch cold; and this is only three doors."</q>—<q rend="inline">"But the people <hi>here will think me mad.</hi>"</q>—<q rend="inline">"If they do, it will be <hi>becauſe</hi> they are fools.

ſervice begins on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Berkeley paſſed a bad night, and could have
ſlept in the morning, the noiſe ſo very near prevented it.
Dr. Berkeley ſent to the exceedingly obliging Mr. Edwards,

leſs time. He moſt politely ſent word, that he would take
care that no bell ſhould move through the week, only juſt
one bell toll five minutes before ſervice began.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley felt ſo much gratitude for this favour ſo

Accordingly, to gratify the amiable heart of her dear

               <p>Mr. Edwards, the wine-merchant, had been many years

She is worthy to be nicee of the Editor's Mother's

mother of the preſent Biſhop of Peterborough.</p>
               <p>The poor unhappy female, the <hi>infamous</hi> Lady Vane, in
her latter days, after ſhe had loſt the uſe of all her limbs,
took a houſe in her native Country of Berks, in order to be
near a very eminent German apothecary. So extremely

the great Inn at York, was on fire. She has no
machine; but her garments are regularly every night <hi>ſo</hi>

               <p>From dread of culinary fire, as Lady Vane travelled down
the vale of years towards the <hi>cold</hi> manſion appointed,
ſooner or later, for all the <hi>daughters</hi> of Adam, however

<hi>His</hi> ſtay would not have prevented <hi>her</hi> ſad fall. She had

very ludicrous ancedotes <note n="†" place="bottom">Biſhop Berkeley retained the famous Paſquilino four years in the palace at Cloyne, to teach his children muſic; giving him £200 <hi>per annum,</hi> and keeping him a little chaiſe and pair of tolerable horſes. The following ludicrous anecdote was ſome time ago related to the Editor by the very worthy Mr. Angello of Eton: Dr. Berkeley was eſteemed the fineſt gentleman-performer on the violincello in England; as his brother, who died at ſixteen, was a wonderfully fine performer on the violin. Biſhop Berkeley had a fine concert at his own houſe every evening in winter when he did not dine from home. Signior Paſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lino was to have a very fine concert at Cork. One day at dinner the Biſhop ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Well, Paſquilino, I have got <hi>rid</hi> of a great many tickets for you among my neighbours, to Lord Inchiquin, Lord Shannon, Mr. Lumley, &amp;c."</q> To which Paſquilino bowing, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"<hi>May God</hi> PICKLE <hi>your Lordſhip, I pray him.</hi>"</q> All the company laughed immoderately. The poor Italian ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Vell, in de grammar that my Lord give me to teach me Ingliſh, it is printed, <hi>Pickle,</hi> to keep from decay."</q> Biſhop Berkeley moſt kindly invited his brother the Reverend Doctor Robert Berkeley, father of the Dean of Tuam, and Mrs. Hamilton, Lady of Sackville Hamilton, Eſq. to ſend his ſeven chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, one fixed day in every week, to learn muſic, dancing, &amp;c. of <hi>his</hi> childrens maſters.</note> of that great and good Prelate,
<pb n="ccccxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:424"/>
that Dr. Berkeley and his Mother uſed to relate of the good
Biſhop even from his childhood throughly diverting. The
Editor is much addicted to watching children, before either
the maſque is <hi>fitted on</hi> to hide, or grace infuſed to ſuppreſs

children, they will, at leaſt ſome of them, inherit my

has, through the great mercy of God, been vouchſafed
to <hi>me;</hi> I am reſolved to let my vaſt eſtate, about which
you are ſo anxious, go to my uncle's family; they may
<hi>perhaps</hi> be better than, I am <hi>ſure,</hi> mine would be. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p>On the commencement of the hard froſt in 1739-40,
the Biſhop went down to breakfaſt the firſt Sunday without

               <p>Bp. Berkeley.—<q rend="inline">"A great deal ails me; for our poor are

               <p>They aſſured him that it disfigured him exceedingly, and
that the men would look dirty. All perſuaſion was vain.
He, during the froſt, and until the ſummer, gave, either

pounds to proper perſons, to diſtribute amongſt the poor

               <p>Mr. Cherry, a native of Windſor Foreſt, was, to the
end of his life, perhaps the keeneſt ſtag-hunter in England,
eſteemed to ride better than any man in the kingdom, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in at the death of the deer. He had one hunter,
a very fine iron grey, an <hi>entire,</hi> who never ſuffered any one
to mount him but Mr. Cherry. The groom was always
obliged to lead him to water. He once, croſſing Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
Bridge, got himſelf and maſter half over the rails, and
there remained, no one daring to go near; all trembling
for Mr. Cherry, the idol of Berkſhire. Boats in abundance
put out, to endeavour to ſave him, when this ſpirited
beaſt ſhould throw him off. In that tremendous ſituation
he remained near a quarter of an hour, and then got the
beaſt on the bridge again<note n="*" place="bottom">One of Mr. Cherry's grand-daughters (not the Editor, who had only ſkill enough to ſpring off her horſe three or four times in a morning's ride) ſeemed to have inherited the ſkill of her grandfather, without having learned, as he had, to ride the great horſe; for ſhe never has got a fall, not even when learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ride; and, whenever ſhe heard of any lady's being thrown, her remark was, <q rend="inline">"I ſuppoſe ſhe <hi>choſe</hi> it. I ſhould like to find <hi>any</hi> horſe that could get <hi>me</hi> off his back, if I had not an inclination to go."</q> She accordingly would often lend her own beautiful ſpirited horſe, and ride any wild, or ſtupid beaſt for her amuſement. If they leap, there ſhe ſits; if they go on both knees, there ſhe ſits; if they rear up, there ſhe remains! Dr. Berkeley uſed to tell her, ſhe could ſit a ſtag. She uſed to ſay, ſhe ſeemed to have been born on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back. The late Dr. James once told a gentleman of the Editor's acquaintance, a Prebendary of Canterbury, <q rend="inline">"If God had meant men ſhould ride ſo conſtantly, he would have ſent them into the world booted and ſpurred."</q> It was more witty than wiſe. Perhaps it was politic—leſs of that excellent medicine James's Powder would be ſold, if perſons rode more on horſeback. A tenant's wife of old Mr. Cherry, having purchaſed an old hunter, uſed regularly to ride to Windſor Market, when farmers LADIES were not <hi>quite</hi> ſo <hi>fine</hi> as in theſe days, with two large paniers of butter and eggs. One hunting morning, hearing the hounds, the poor old beaſt pricked up his ears, and ſet off. Every effort of the old woman to hold him in was in vain.—Away he flew, and ſoon reduced the butter and eggs to a <hi>fine liquid.</hi> It daſhed Yeomen, Prickers, Lords, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, and <hi>even</hi> his Majeſty, to the great diverſion of the witty Charles, who would not ſuffer any one to attempt ſtopping the horſe. At the death of the deer, his Majeſty ordered the butter and eggs to be <hi>amply</hi> paid for, and told the honeſt old woman, who began begging pardon, &amp;c. that he ſhould be glad of her company often upon the field, adding, <q rend="inline">"I have not been ſo entertained for a long time."</q>

Archbiſhop Potter told the late Archdeacon Dodwell the
following anecdote of his father's excellent friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"King William, who valued himſelf much on his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip,
was frequently mortified by hearing his courtiers
admiring Mr. Cherry's wonderful ſkill in riding, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
at length that he would follow Mr. Cherry every
<pb n="ccccxxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:439"/>
where. After ſome days, Mr. Cherry, finding that it was
not chance that conſtantly kept his Majeſty juſt behind
him, determined to try to ſerve his, as he conceived, <hi>lawful</hi>
Sovereign, by breaking the neck of the <hi>Uſurper.</hi> He
went over many very dangerous places. The King, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
mounted, and a very good horſeman, ſtill followed.
One day, when the ſtag took the ſoil, Mr Cherry inſtantly
plunged into a frightfully deep and broad part of the
Thames. The King went to the brink, looked, and looked
again, then ſhook his head, and retired. His Majeſty
thought the actual poſſeſſion of <hi>three</hi> kingdoms better than
the <hi>fame</hi> of being as good a horſeman as Mr. Cherry,
thus yielding the palm to Mr. Cherry. He never
followed him afterwards, to the great comfort of his
Majeſty's attendants."</q> The late Sir Robert Gayer<note n="*" place="bottom">The Editor and her ſiſter have a moſt beautiful miniature, the property of Mr. Cherry, done in Italy, of this wonderfully beautiful extraordinary man, with whom their grandfather was exceedingly intimate. When he loſt his lovely lady, for whom he mourned ſeven years, he never changed his linen, walked about the park unſhaved, in an old black long looſe freeze coat, almoſt a Nebucadnezzar.

Now, alas! comes the throughly tragical part of this tale; which the Editor, when young, uſed to tell ſome gentlemen, of her friends, ſhe would print, and, to humble the <hi>lords</hi> of the creation, have bound up with "The Hiſtory of the EPHESIAN MATRON."—"LORD, <hi>what is</hi> MAN?" After ſome time, poor <hi>wretched</hi> Sir Robert married a beautiful widow, his own near relation, Lady Chriſtian Rolle, by whom he had ſeveral children. His firſt, ſo ſingularly lamented lady, left four fine ſons, all of whom he bred up gentlemen, to no profeſſion. At his death, his very large eſtate fell, unavoidably, to his eldeſt ſon, who married the very uncommonly ſenſible lady Elizabeth Anneſly. On opening his will, it appeared that this, what muſt one ſtyle him?—<hi>Monſter of Cruelty</hi> is a milk-and-water title for him—had bequeathed to his three younger ſons of the THUS lamented lady only FIVE HUNDRED pounds each—Good God!!! and to (the Editor thinks) <hi>ſix</hi> children of Lady Chriſtian Rolle, each SIX THOUSAND POUNDS. Attend to the fate of the three mal-treated young gentlemen. One died, within a few months, of a broken heart. Another was deprived of his reaſon, and never perfectly recovered it, although he lived to poſſeſs, one can hardly ſay enjoy, his <hi>horrid</hi> father's great eſtate at Hurley, Berks, (now the property of the excellent Duke of Marlborough), after the death of his nephew, the late Robert Gayer, Eſquire, of Hurley. The third of theſe injured ſons patiently, reſignedly, ſunk his five hundred pounds in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, and went to board with a farmer at Stoke—the, at that time well-known, witty Joe Hewett, who was in all the gay parties of the nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood.

               <p>Mr. Cherry died juſt one year before the Queen. After
the Rebellion in 1715, Mrs. Cherry in her coach, with her
two daughters, driving down Ludgate Hill, met ſeveral
coaches filled with the unfortunate gentlemen who had been
in the Rebellion returning to Newgate after their ſentence:
ſhe exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Oh! my dear girls, bleſs the goodneſs of
God, that your excellent father is <hi>dead,</hi> or he had been
amongſt thoſe unhappy men; for, I am ſure, he would
never have worn a ſword without drawing it in <hi>this</hi>
cauſe; and he would certainly have been hanged."</q>
               </p>
               <p>King William ſent repeated offers of any thing, and
every thing, to Mr. Cherry, if he would go to Court, and
take the oaths. Queen Anne, it ſhould ſeem, was too well
acquainted with Mr. Cherry to make him <hi>any ſuch</hi> offers,
She ſhewed her eſteem for that <hi>throughly honeſt</hi> man in other
ways.</p>
               <p>A conſiderable part of Mr. Cherry's very large eſtate lay
in Windſor Foreſt. It is to this day a lucky circumſtance

               <p>On the firſt laying on the land-tax, meetings were called
by the Sheriffs in every county in England. At Reading,
nearly central, always the county town, until the old Lord
Harcourt contrived to get electors and jurymen dragged
down to Abingdon, the laſt town—pariſh—in the county—At
Reading the whole county met, and were harangued by
a <hi>miniſterial</hi> orator, telling them <q rend="inline">"that the tax was only to
be levied ONE <hi>year,</hi> and every gentleman and yeoman was
to give in the full value of his own eſtate."</q> Some <hi>few</hi> of
the gentlemen, zealous friends to the new government,
(for Berks was always an honeſt Tory county) and others
from motives of vanity, gave in the value of their
eſtates more than double, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Come, let us do the
thing <hi>handſomely, generouſly.</hi>"</q> When an entry was about
to be committed to paper, that <note n="*" place="bottom">The Editor often contemplates with admiration the very wonderfully ſenſible, thoughtful, ſedate countenance of her great grandfather, in a very fine portrait of that great lawyer, painted by Richardſon, at an advanced age.

A ſhort time before the death of his father he happened to ſee in his father's ſtudy a book, containing a liſt of his debts.

At a meeting of creditors one day at a Judge's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the Editor has often heard her mother ſay, that Mr. Spinckes, author of "The Sick Man viſited," one of the creditors, came up to Mrs. Cherry, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It may, perhaps, Madam, be an odd thing for a clergyman to ſay; but I muſt ſay, that Mr. Cherry was a too honeſt man.

Mr. Cherry experienced the truth of one text of Scripture on this event. A nephew of his lady, who was under very great pecuniary obligations, as well as a thouſand amiable attentions in his youth, begged to be excuſed being bound for Mr. Cherry, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"that he had promiſed his wife, when he married, "that he would never be bound for any one."

The Editor takes this opportunity of making her public acknowledgements to the polite amiable Mr. Hambley of Herts, the preſent vicar of Cookham, for his very pleaſing conduct to Dr. Berkeley, when Dr. Berkeley quitted that lovely ſpot, and to the Editor ſince. Dr. Berkeley always left all unpleaſant buſineſs to the Editor, as he always made her open letters that he ſuſpected to be unpleaſant.

No date. It was written ſeveral months before Mr.
Cherry's death, which he had ſeen approaching with ſuch
entire confidence in the glorious promiſes of our all-graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Redeemer, that on the Saturday preceding his death,
<pb n="ccccxlv" facs="tcp:0761700600:457"/>
which happened on the Wedneſday, he danced until the clock
ſtruck twelve. (His beloved nephew (eldeſt ſon of his eldeſt
ſiſter) James Hayes, Eſq. of Holyport, father of James Hayes,
Eſq. late one of his Majeſty's Judges for North Wales, then
recently married.) Mr. Cherry ſaid one day to his lady,
<q rend="inline">"We have not had the new-married couple to dinner: yet
we muſt have them; the laſt veniſon we ſhall have this
ſeaſon is fit to dreſs for every body but myſelf;" (Mr.
Cherry frequently had a haunch hung up, like his nephew
Dr. Cherry Hayes, of Windſor, until it was ready to ſhake
from the bone). "Send over a ſervant to invite them for
Saturday."</q> Of courſe ſome other families in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="ccccxlvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:458"/>
were invited to meet them. During the time of
dinner Mr. Cherry ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It is juſt come into my head,
that I muſt have a dance with the bride."</q>—Mrs. Cherry
objected, leſt it might injure him. He replied, <q rend="inline">"My dear,
I am as well able to dance now as I was the firſt time I
had the happineſs<note n="*" place="bottom">There had been a quarrel between the gamekeepers of Mr. Finch and Mr. Cherry. Their manors joining, ſo there was no viſiting. Mr. Cherry, however, met the lady at a neighbour's, and, as in antient times, danced the whole night with her. At breakfaſt one was ſaying, how ſoundly they had ſlept, and another that they had ſlept little. Mr. Francis Cherry ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I can't tell how it was, but I could not ſleep at all."</q> An acute lady ſaid to his anxious mother, (Mr. Cherry, a ſort of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> born after his ſiſters were almoſt women,) <q rend="inline">"<hi>I</hi> can tell you why <hi>Frank</hi> did not ſleep, it was becauſe the FINCHES kept ſuch a twittering at his windows, it was <hi>impoſſible</hi> he <hi>ſhould</hi> ſleep."</q> Mr. Cherry told his ſingle, his favourite ſiſter, who fell into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and died for the loſs of an accompliſhed young gentleman, to whom ſhe was going to be married, that <hi>if ever</hi> he married, he then hardly twenty, <hi>ſhe</hi> had ſeen the lady. She replied, <q rend="inline">"Oh! my dear brother, that is <hi>impoſſible;</hi> you know there has been a quarrel between the families."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Well, then, <hi>I</hi> will make PEACE."</q> He did ſo, for never did family live in greater harmony than old Mr. Cherry, his excellent lady, and Mr. and Mrs. F. Cherry. They had no other home, either in town or country, but Shotterſbrook Houſe and Arundel Street—the houſe now made into three. Old Mr. Cherry allowed his ſon £.2,500 <hi>per annum</hi> to fly about to Aſtrop, Bath, &amp;c. and to relieve diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed objects—a favourite amuſement of Mr. F.

one of the moſt amiable of women—(the Hayes family are
remarkably lucky in chooſing ſweet-tempered women, at leaſt

may, perhaps, like to think that ſhe has danced with her
old uncle<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Cherry was eſteemed one of the fineſt dancers, as well as the firſt horſeman, in England; and HE certainly did not eſteem dancing a ſin: he was not one of the gloomy Chriſtians, diſgracing inſtead of <q rend="inline">"adorning the doctrine of God our Saviour."</q> He was a great ſtudier of the Holy Scriptures; and had, no doubt, often redde, as well as his grand-daughter, Mrs. George Berkeley, although, perhaps, he had not occaſion in thoſe days to quote it ſo frequently, the promiſe of God by the prophet Jeremiah, <q rend="inline">"Thou ſhalt again go forth in the dances of them that <hi>make merry.</hi>"</q> The late John Weſley ſays, in his ridiculous account, printed by himſelf, of his ſeminary for educating young hypocrites, <q rend="inline">"the children at certain times are allowed to RECREATE themſelves" (there was ſurely need that they ſhould be <hi>re</hi>-created after being under his tuition); "for the word <hi>play</hi> is never uſed, never <hi>heard</hi> of, amongſt them."</q> Now, God, ſpeaking by his Holy Prophet Zechariah, ſays, <q rend="inline">"there ſhall yet again be boys and girls PLAYING in the ſtreets of Jeruſalem."</q> (ch. viii. ver. 5.) It is lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to remark, that thoſe who affect ſo much more ſtrictneſs, rigidity, or what you pleaſe, than is enjoined by God himſelf, generally fall into the ſhameful breach of part of the ſecond table. This <q rend="inline">"loading men and poor little children with theſe heavy burdens and grievous to be borne,"</q> is often a <hi>blind,</hi> to conceal the breach, the open breach, of the ſeventh or eighth command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Mr. Cherry was certainly not one of <hi>this ſort</hi> of Chriſtians; for, until the end of his life, he, his lady, and daughters (the youngeſt near ſixteen at the time of her father's death), always danced ſeveral nights, every full moon, at his own, and ſeveral neighbouring gentlemen's ſeats; fathers, mothers, ſons, and daughters, all danced together. Young ladies were at <hi>leaſt as</hi> virtuous, in thoſe <hi>old-faſhioned</hi> days, as they are at preſent. The Houſe of Peers was not <hi>quite</hi> ſo often applied to for diſſolving marriages as they are at preſent. Alas! let us remember that God, ſpeaking of the Jewiſh nation, ſays, <q rend="inline">"they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by troops in (the witty, wiſe, pious Dr. Young, in his 'Centaur not fabulous,' ſays) the LADIES houſes. They were as fed horſes, &amp;c. Shall not my ſoul be AVENGED on <hi>ſuch</hi> a nation as this?"</q> He expreſſly avoids ſaying on <hi>this</hi> nation; but, <q rend="inline">"on SUCH a nation as this;"</q> where or whenever ſeen by his all-heart-ſearching eye. We have ſeen it on France, where the <hi>hoinous</hi> ſin of ADULTERY was not, as formerly there, <hi>winked at,</hi> but GLORIED in. Let us of this ſtill-ſpared nation beware leſt we fall into like condemnation. It is in the power often of the moſt unimportant perſon to brow-beat this dreadful grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin; and woe to thoſe who can, by their high rank and ſtation in life, do it, if they do it not to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> of their power!</note> (Mr. Cherry died at 46). Then, turning to the
<pb n="ccccxlviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:460"/>
butler, he ordered him to ſend the groom over to Woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,
to fetch the muſic: it ſoon arrived, and to dancing
they went, and continued their dance until the clock
ſtruck twelve. Mr. Cherry went to church on the Sunday,
and died on the Wedneſday morning following. His intimate

               <p>The Editor has frequently heard Dr. Berkeley, and his
mother, who was there, ſay, that in Rhode Iſland, about
twenty miles in circumference, there were, at the time of
the Biſhop's reſidence there, <hi>no leſs</hi> than <hi>ſixteen</hi> different
ſects in religion, Preſbyterians, Baptiſts of various ſorts, &amp;c.;
and it was cuſtomary for ſtrangers to aſk their viſitors, <q rend="inline">"Pray
of what religion are you?"</q> and diſcourſe with them on the
ſubject of their diſſent from the other FIFTEEN. All, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
excelled the majority, alas! in England at preſent, in
<hi>agreeing,</hi> that it was <hi>neceſſary</hi> to keep <hi>one</hi> day in ſeven
holy to the Supreme Governor of the univerſe. Accordingly,
on the Biſhop's making this uſual enquiry, it was ſometimes
anſwered, <q rend="inline">"I am a Friday-man—I a Saturday-man,"</q> and
others acknowledged themſelves SEEKERS—that they were
<hi>ſeeking</hi> for the <hi>beſt</hi> religion, and had not <hi>yet</hi> found it.

               <p>This account has been confirmed to the Editor by the
very worthy, amiable Samuel Johnſon, Eſquire, of Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut,
before mentioned in this Preface, who was a Privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counſellor
of Connecticut, the only Church of England-man
that colony had ever elected. He was ſent over here, before
we loſt America, to ſolicit a cauſe before his Majeſty's
Privy Council. He was many years here—about ſeven. His
father, Dr. Samuel Johnſon, a very learned man, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Preſbyterian miniſter, was convinced by Biſhop Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's
arguments, and ſaw the <hi>Divine</hi> right of Epiſcopacy.
He preached ſeveral Sundays upon it, and at length told
his congregation, that he was ſo fully convinced of it, that
<pb n="ccccliii" facs="tcp:0761700600:465"/>
the next Sunday he ſhould attend Epiſcopal worſhip, and
wiſhed <hi>them all</hi> to accompany him, (which moſt of them
did,) telling them, that <q rend="inline">"<hi>he</hi> ſhould not PRESUME to miniſter
any longer in things ſacred, until he had obtained Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
ordination;"</q> which he ſoon did. He wrote ſeveral very
learned treatiſes, and a very good Hebrew Grammar. His
excellent ſon had the degree of LL.D. conferred on him
by the Univerſity of Oxford during his reſidence in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
He always ſpent great part of every ſummer at Dr.
Berkeley's, and conſtantly, until after the breaking out of
the American war, ſent over two immenſe double barrels
of fine American New-Town pippins, the fineſt grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on Long Iſland, of which his elder brother was
proprietor.</p>
               <p>The Editor uſed to delight all her friends and neighbours
by preſenting them with ſome, and herſelf by making her
gardener every year ſow ſome pips in the melon-frame, and
at proper times plant them out. There are now eight fine
trees, thicker than herſelf, bearing ſix different fruits, only
one of them reſembling the parent fruit; one quite through
the colour of an orange, exquiſitely finely flavoured for
about ſix weeks, when it becomes ſo nauſeouſly ſweet,
that nothing but her Chineſe pigs will eat them; one a
green, ſtrong, ſour apple, that keeps till May. The Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
is a great gardener, and made her children ſuch, telling
her friends, that "when God created man, HE placed him
<pb n="ccccliv" facs="tcp:0761700600:466"/>

without houſes, as rent and TAXES run away with much of
a ſmall income.</p>
               <p>In one thing, however, the different ſectariſts, both men
and women, all agreed, viz. in a <hi>rage</hi> for finery, to the
great amuſement of Biſhop Berkeley's two learned, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
friends, Sir John James, and Richard Dalton, Eſquire;
the men in flaming ſcarlet coats and waiſtcoats, laced and
fringed with the brighteſt <hi>glaring yellow.</hi> The <hi>ſly</hi> Quakers,
not <hi>venturing</hi> on theſe <hi>charming</hi> coats and waiſtcoats, yet
loving finery, figured away with plate at their ſide-board,
or rather <hi>beaufait.</hi> One, to the no ſmall diverſion of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
Berkeley, ſent to England, and had made on purpoſe,
no ſuch thing being to be found, a noble large tea-pot of
ſolid gold, and enquired of the Biſhop, when drinking tea
with him, whether <hi>friend</hi> Berkeley had ever ſeen ſuch a
<q rend="inline">"<hi>curious</hi> thing?"</q> On being told that ſilver ones were
much in uſe in England, but that he had never ſeen a gold
one; Ebenezer replied, <q rend="inline">"Aye, that was the thing; I was
reſolved to have ſomething <hi>finer</hi> than any body elſe. They
ſay that the Queen (Queen Caroline) has not got one."</q>
The Biſhop delighted his ridiculous hoſt, by aſſuring him,
<q rend="inline">"that his was an unique;"</q> and very happy it made him.</p>

Oh, the fools! ſay rather the knaves! If the Kingdom
of God, as ſpeaks St. Paul, <q rend="inline">"does not conſiſt in meat and

wears a coat or gown of one colour or another?</p>
               <p>The Editor once met a rich Quaker woman at tea, at
the houſe of a perſon of quality in her neighbourhood, and
happened to have on a pair of very fine point ruffles, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
at the time of her marriage, for ſhe loved her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
too well to buy fine point or lace afterwards. After
tea, the company, as is ſurely pleaſant in ſummer, went
out to ſtroll in the garden; when the lady of the houſe called
the attention of the Quaker to the Editor's lace. She
<hi>piouſly</hi> ſhook her <hi>wiſe</hi> head, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"<hi>I doubt thee beeſt

Berkeley went to reſide at Cloyne, in the year 1734, he
found the <hi>unfortunate</hi> Mr. Fitzgerald as above deſcribed,
and in his grand climacteric. He habited him comfortably,
gave him an invitation to dine at the palace every day,
bought him a quiet horſe, on which he rode out in fine
weather, the Biſhop keeping it, and one of his grooms attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it. When any perſon dined at the palace beſide the
Biſhop's family, Mr. Fitzgerald, at his own entreaty,
always dined at the ſteward's table; to whoſe room

               <p>Mr. Fitzgerald had a ſmall potatoe ground, and two

Fitzgerald kept no maid, the neighbouring poor women
milked her cows, made her butter, ſcalded her veſſels, &amp;c.

                  </note>, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;

that neither of the Earls, his kinſmen, who divided his

eſtate, ever gave him a ſhilling. It was not pleaſant to them
to hear him named.</p>
               <p>One day, when they, their ladies, and families, had
dined at Biſhop Berkeley's, juſt as the coaches were driving
out of the court-yard, a violent clamour, was heard <hi>ſcolding,

               </p>
               <p>The very grateful Mr. Fitzgerald had made a will<note n="*" place="bottom">The Editor has frequently been told, by Biſhop Berkeley's learned, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able friend Richard Dalton, Eſquire, that his friend Sir John James, Baronet, told Biſhop Benſon, that he had bequeathed his very large eſtate, excepting a few legacies to his dear friend Biſhop Berkeley. Biſhop Benſon wrote what he, lovely man, thought the <hi>pleaſant</hi> news to Cloyne; and received in return a <hi>thundering</hi> letter, as Mr. Dalton termed it, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Do <hi>you</hi> tell JAMES that <hi>I</hi> will NOT have his fortune. Bid him leave it to his RELATIONS, I WON'T have it."</q> Sir John, on hearing this, bequeathed it to the old Chevalier de St. George—ſo, of courſe, his relations got it. He had, after Biſhop Berkeley went to Cloyne, boceme a Papiſt. A very long letter of Biſhop Berkeley to Sir John James on that occaſion is one of the letters which will compoſe part of the ſecond volume of "Berkeley's Literary Relics," if it is ever printed; as alſo a very curious ſingular caſe of conſcience, ſubmitted <hi>to,</hi> nad determined <hi>by,</hi> another eminent Prelate of the Church of England.</note>, which

               <p>Neither Doctor Berkeley nor his Son could ever be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
by their friends to go to Court, and be preſented,
without any cauſe calling them thither. Both laughed at
the idea of almoſt every Country 'Squire, and unpreferred

Dr. Berkeley was at a very great expence to diſperſe his
famous Sermon on the thirtieth of January. Only a few
months before his lamented death he printed the ſixth edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
on common paper, and had one thouſand of them
diſperſed over England. On its firſt publication, it went
through five editions in four weeks. He has repeatedly
told the Editor, that the notes of the fifth edition, in ſmall
duodecimo, not now to be purchaſed for any ſum, are all,
except one, anſwers to letters, from <q rend="inline">"Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,"</q>
ſome admiring, ſome with Nicodemus, enquiring,
<q rend="inline">"How can theſe things be<note n="*" place="bottom">See the third chapter of the Holy Goſpel, as recorded by Saint John.</note>?"</q> To have anſwered all the
letters received on that Sermon, he ſaid, would have taken
a ream of paper. One from the Editor's, not Dr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's,
<hi>old</hi> acquaintance, Soame Jenyns, written a very ſhort
time before the death of that entertaining, agreeable, great
genius, and, at length, devout Chriſtian, is carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by the Editor, who lately found an odd glove in her
cabinet, that happened to be dropped by a beloved friend
the laſt time ſhe ever viſited her, about twenty years ago.
The Editor has a picture of her friend, and other <hi>ſouve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nirs;</hi>
yet the glove is ſtill preſerved with care. Why is it?
perhaps it brings the <hi>laſt</hi> idea of the beloved object to the
mind. One knows not why elſe. Perhaps the <hi>mind</hi> of

man can never be fully defined by <hi>man;</hi> yet it is a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſtudy ſurely, next to obſerving the wonderful ways of
PROVIDENCE. Of <hi>both,</hi> like the late Queen of Pruſſia on her

               <p>Perhaps two ſincerer, more diſintereſted patriots, have
not exiſted in <hi>any</hi> country, at <hi>any</hi> time, than Biſhop Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
and his ſon Dr. Berkeley, both very great politicians.
The Biſhop publicly, his ſon more quietly, frequently
ſuggeſted hints to the miniſter for the time being, for
the benefit of the country, ſome of which he had the
pleaſure of ſeeing were attended to, although the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
when the advice was thus conveyed, were generally
anonymous, he uſing to ſay, <q rend="inline">"If the advice is wiſe, a man
of ſenſe will attend to it, come how it may;"</q> adding,
<q rend="inline">"I write frequently to Mr. Pitt, and ſometimes ſend him a
meſſage."</q> Dr. Berkeley ſuggeſted, and it was attended to,
ſome additional benefit for the poor common ſoldiers. The
Editor is no politician—not that ſhe does not eſteem
<hi>females equal</hi> to politics. Sir Robert Walpole uſed to ſay,
that an old friend of the Editor's Father, Mrs. Waller,

Aiſlabie's, had a very ſuperior underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Dr. Berkeley was univerſally admired as a letter-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
he wrote ſuch <note n="*" place="bottom">The Editor fears to ſet down, leſt it ſhould ſeem incredible, during Archbiſhop Secker's life, the annual amount of the poſtage of Dr. Berkeley's letters—(the Editor always keeps the letter-accompt ſeparate, and an heavy enough accompt it is moſt years, even her own now—when her beloved friends were living, it was ſometimes quite frightful)—and, after his Grace's death, numbers of perſons, who had never ſeen his face, wrote to him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt his advice how to get a place or preferment. He benevolently anſwered them all, and generally directed them into a track that led them right. The plan he purſued was once practiſed <hi>againſt</hi> himſelf. At the election of the late amiable Lord Lichfield, when ſtanding for the Chancellorſhip of the Univerſity of Oxford, during the reign of George the Second, his Lordſhip, being an honeſt Tory, was likely to be <hi>hard-run.</hi> His Lordſhip lamenting one day to a relation of the Editor, the late ſenſible cynical Richard Rowney, Eſquire, Fellow of All-Souls College, that he feared Mr. Berkeley, of Chriſt College, would not vote for him, aſked if Mr. Powney had any intereſt with Dr. Berkeley, juſt then made Vicar of Bray (Ive's Place is in Bray Pariſh). The Editor's acute kinſman replied, that he could not take the liberty to aſk Mr. Berkeley for his vote; but added, <q rend="inline">"<hi>I can put you</hi> in a way to SECURE IT, if you are acquainted with the Archbiſhop of Canterbury."</q>—Lord Lichfield replied, <q rend="inline">"Yes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately ſo."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Oh! then, I'll <hi>promiſe you</hi> Mr. Berkeley's vote.—Go <hi>yourſelf</hi> to Lambeth, and requeſt his Grace to <hi>aſk</hi> Mr. Berkeley to vote for you."</q> The advice was exactly followed. The Editor has repeatedly heard Dr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley relate to various perſons—(it happened before ſhe was acquainted with Dr. Berkeley)—the Archbiſhop wrote to Dr. Berkeley (the letter ſtill exiſts); Dr. Berkeley anſwered it <hi>per</hi> return of poſt, telling his Grace that, according to <hi>one</hi> ſtatute he had ſworn to obſerve, Lord Lichfield was not eligible; and, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he reſpected Lord Lichfield, his conſcience would not permit him to vote for him—that he had always determined not to vote <hi>againſt</hi> him; and moſt ſincerely wiſhed he might be elected Chancellor. Soon after Dr. Berkeley went to ſtay at Lambeth, he told his Grace that ſuch a ſtatute ſaid ſo and ſo. His Grace replied, <q rend="inline">"HAH! I believe it may; but I never underſtood it ſo before. You were (or are) quite right, Sir, in not voting for Lord Lichfield; for, according to that, he is (or was)—(the Editor forgets whether this converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was prior, or ſubſequent, to the election) QUITE RIGHT IN NOT voting for his Lordſhip."</q>—As the Editor does not read Latin, <hi>ſhe</hi> is no judge of this matter; but ſhe knows it is happy for the poor patients in the Infirmary that his Lordſhip was Chancellor.</note> numbers ſo alertly for his friends and

               <p>It is ſuppoſed, by many that knew him through life, in
early life, and until nearly the lateſt period of life, that
Dr. Berkeley had, by his advice, direction, and aſſiſtance,
made the fortunes of more men, than any private perſon,
not in ſtation to do it, than any man in the three king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
ſo as ſometimes to occaſion Mrs. Berkeley to ſay to

Mr. Monck Berkeley, by his Mother's earneſt advice to
him in youth, never meddled with politics; ſhe always
telling him, it was time enough if ever he ſhould be in a

               <p>A gentleman, many years ago, ſaid to the Editor,

He called for pen, ink, and paper, twirled his chair round

poſtillion and horſes, <q rend="inline">"VIVAT POST FUNERA VIRTUS;"</q>
which he engraved in the ſtrings of his creſt, as is ſeen in
the print prefixed to the Poems. That Mr. Berkeley, from
his cradle, or rather <hi>no</hi> cradle, as has been before ſtated,
to his coffin, had numerous hair-breadth eſcapes from death,
has been mentioned. Some time <hi>after</hi> his death two
<hi>very extraordinary</hi> things occurred, which will not be here

               <p>The Editor again begs pardon for treſpaſſing ſo long on
the public; and wiſhes that ſhe reſembled her excellent
Son in many inſtances, particularly in burning without
mercy, not, as he did, whole quires at a time of beautiful
Eſſays, Poems, &amp;c. for in early youth <hi>her manuſcripts</hi>
conſiſted only of innumerable letters to friends, which ſhe
truſts they conſigned to the flames, and a diary of her own
<hi>very unimportant</hi> life, from the age of ſeventeen, when,
being a very early riſer in ſummer, and her mother never
coming out of her cloſet to <hi>breakfaſt</hi> until ten o'clock; for
the family prayers at Mr. Frinſham's were (the Editor
<pb n="cccclxix" facs="tcp:0761700600:481"/>
thinks very inconveniently) not offered up until <hi>after</hi> break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,
when trades-people are coming, and the door muſt
be anſwered, in private families—excepting at the houſe of
the late excellent Mr. and Mrs. Peirce, of Windſor Foreſt,
who, either in town or country, never ſuffered even the
kitchen-maid, or groom, to anſwer the door until prayers,
leſſons, and pſalms, were gone through. At Lambeth
Palace, during Archbiſhop Secker's life, every ſervant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the <hi>porter,</hi> went into the chapel at nine in the
morning. Dr. Berkeley and the Editor, when reſident at
Acton, were one morning a very few minutes too late—the
footman diſmounted, and knocked violently—Dr.
Berkeley aſſured him it was in vain; ſo the glaſſes were drawn
up, and in about half an hour the gates were opened. The
Editor, on her marriage, found the cuſtom at Dr. Berkeley's
much better, that of aſſembling before breakfaſt, at nine
o'clock, perhaps not always quite ſo punctually to a <hi>minute;</hi>
as did, for more than half a century, the pious mother of
that juſt Judge Sir W. H. Aſhhurſt. What a bleſſing
to individuals, ſometimes to thouſands, is a wiſe, pious
mother!</p>
               <p>The Editor has frequently heard her mother ſay, <q rend="inline">"that
the mother of Judge Buller, although the daughter of

The Editor wiſhes that, for the benefit of ſociety, Mr Moore
would put forth an edition in half-crown numbers. There

               <p>Three of the Editor's old, intimate friends, the late Sir

The idea of a nobleman or gentleman upon their knees
to <hi>any</hi> BUT God, brings to the Editor's mind a circumſtance
of a noble Duke upon his knees (not to beg pardon), re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly
related to her by her Mother.</p>
               <p>It has been mentioned before, that the great controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſial
writer, Charles Leſlie, great-grandſon of the excellent
Biſhop of Rothes, the only <hi>Scotch</hi> friend of the unfortunate
Queen Mary, as good Sir Nicholas Throcmorton was her
only Engliſh one, ſpent much time at Mr. Cherry's<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Leſlie was ſtaying with Mr. Cherry, at his houſe in town, at the time of the great ſtorm in 1703. Mr. Cherry's Lady always, winter as well as ſummer, roſe every morning at ſix o'clock, until within two years of her death at 68, when ſhe lay till ſeven. She never went to reſt till between twelve and one. Her daughter, Mrs. Frinſham, and one of her grand-daughters, not the Editor, could live almoſt without ſleep. Mrs. Cherry uſed to ſay, <hi>finches</hi> were early birds. In the morning, at half-paſt five, when the houſe-maid went in, to light Mrs. Cherry's fire, Mr. Leſlie followed her in, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Is the report true, or are
my good friends living?"</q> Both at once bleſſed the mercy of God that they were. He replied, <q rend="inline">"The whole ſtreet have been up all night, except your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are telling each other, 'Ah! poor Mr. Cherry's family, they are all killed, ſervants and all.' I lay till my bed was quite covered with bricks from the chimney—I then got up, and went to the farther corner, and have ſat there ever ſince the firſt hour."</q> Mr. Cherry had gone up to ſee after his little girls—their excellent French governeſs entreated him not to awake them, ſo they ſlept through it.</note>,
where ſhe had often heard the following little anecdote
related by Mr. Leſlie; as the origin of Mr. Leſlie's <q rend="inline">"FOUR
SHORT MARKS"</q> to aſcertain the truth of hiſtoric facts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="cccclxxxiii" facs="tcp:0761700600:495"/>
as having paſt long ſince; and which, the Editor has
repeatedly heard from many learned men, coſt the late Dr.
Conyers Middleton twenty years' trying, but all in vain, to
refute.</p>
               <p>An excellent lady, a friend of Mr. Cherry, was very inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
with the then Duke of Leeds, who was a Deiſt. They
often diſputed on the ſubject. The lady happened one
day to lament that, although the Duke would never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
her to Deiſm, ſhe ſhould never be able to convert him
to Chriſtianity, for he took all her arguments to pieces. In
ſhort, his Grace was a better logician than the lady, who
ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Now, if Mr. Leſlie would teach me ſome arguments,
I could urge them, and perhaps reſcue my noble friend
from his ſad error."</q> Mr. Leſlie replied, <q rend="inline">"I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to furniſh you with ſome arguments, that, if his
Grace has an <hi>honeſt</hi> mind, will convince him of the truth
of Revelation."</q> Accordingly, the <hi>four marks</hi> were given
to her, and ſhe ſoon produced them to her noble friend.</p>
               <p>The next morning, as early as it was proper to ſend to a
fine lady, perhaps <hi>rather</hi> earlier at the end of the ſeventeenth
than at the cloſe of the eighteenth century, the Duke ſent
to requeſt that the lady would have the goodneſs to deſire
the gentleman who had written that paper to viſit him
with her. On Mr. Leſlie's entering the apartment the
<pb n="cccclxxxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:496"/>
Duke went towards him, and, like Cornelius to Saint
Peter<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts, chap. x.</note>, fell on his knees, burſt into tears, thanked him,
and beſought him to pray to God to forgive the having
lived ſo long in ignorance and error; ſaid that he had ſat
up the whole night, reading it over and over, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
for the arrival of the morning, to ſee and bleſs the
hand that had reſcued him from eternal miſery.</p>
               <p>Whoever has as honeſt a mind as this wiſe excellent
Duke, may read theſe FOUR MARKS, almoſt <hi>verbatim,</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by the pious Mr. Nelſon, in <hi>the Monday and
Tueſday in Whitſun-Week,</hi> in his "Feaſts and Faſts." The
very learned late Reverend Meredith Jones, Rector of
Gueſtling, Prebendary of Chicheſter, Chaplain to the preſent
Biſhop of Chicheſter, in a moſt incomparable work of his,
written when a young man, without his name, and printed
for B. White in 1758, ſays, <q rend="inline">"I defy any <hi>honeſt</hi> Arian not
to be convinced by the proofs here produced."</q> The book
is almoſt as ſcarce as it is excellent. It proves that the
filiation of the SAVIOUR of the WORLD did <hi>not</hi> commence
until after the angel Gabriel had been ſent to the Bleſſed
Virgin. The excellent and very deeply learned Mr.
Romaine ſays, that the diſtinction in the Trinity, of Father,
Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are only <hi>office</hi> names; for he was old-faſhioned
enough to believe that, in this Trinity, none was
<pb n="cccclxxxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:497"/>
greater or leſs than another, &amp;c. (See the Anathaſian
Creed<note n="*" place="bottom">The book on which the witty Frank Coventry has placed his <hi>hero</hi> POMPEY <q rend="inline">"the little,"</q> when converſing with his <hi>friend</hi> PUSS, in his old miſtreſs's cloſet. The Editor cannot here forbear ſetting down <hi>her idea</hi> of the TRIUNE God at <hi>ſeven</hi> years old. Earneſtly reading on Saints-days, &amp;c. this <hi>old-faſhioned</hi> creed, ſhe puzzled her little <hi>over</hi>-inquiſitive brain to find out ſome ſimilitude; at length, ſtanding one evening by the card-table, when the family, &amp;c. were playing quadrille; Baſto was played, and, lying ſome time alone on the table, it occured to her young mind that the ace of clubs was the emblem of the TRIUNE God—this entirely ſatisfied all her <hi>ſceptical</hi> doubts at ſeven years old, and they have never, bleſſed be God, troubled her ſince. It was a wonderfully odd idea for a child; but it entirely delivered her parents from her worrying to explain the Trinity to her.</note>. The very learned Mr. Hawtry has lately publiſhed
a ſimilar work for <hi>very</hi> learned perſons. Few females of the
Editor's acquaintance, excepting her two old friends and
nameſakes Meſdames Eliza Carter and Eliza Lawrence—the
latter ſtyled by Dr. Johnſon <q rend="inline">"The Engliſh Sappho"</q>—are,
perhaps, qualified to underſtand all its merits. Probably

Mr. Monck Berkeley deteſted every kind of affection as
much as his Mother. He delighted much in the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the two above-named, uncommonly ſenſible, as well
as very learned ladies. The Editor has frequently heard
Dr. Berkeley ſay, he would prefer, were he to publiſh a

               <p>The title of Mr. Meredith Jones's work is, "The Doctrine

               <p>A young man, now no longer an inhabitant of this ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

ready wit, his wonderful wilfulneſs in youth, the great

               <p>Mr. Berkeley, like the excellent, Honourable Captain
Hamilton, of the Lancaſter man of war, father of the
Marquis of Abercorn, never could behold a cloud of diſtreſs
on any brow, even on that of a perfect ſtranger, without
<pb n="ccccxc" facs="tcp:0761700600:502"/>
not only wiſhing, but even endeavouring, to remedy or
alleviate their ſorrows, in which they both often ſucceeded
with high and low; many curious inſtances of which might
be related.</p>
               <p>Of the excellent, amiable Captain Hamilton, the Editor
has frequently heard his very worthy brother, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable

ſitting with his arms folded, regardleſs of all that paſſed;
no one, perhaps, but my excellent brother would have
thought of enquiring into the cauſe. He ſpoke to him
two or three times. His anſwers were as laconic as might
conſiſt with civility. This only ſerved to convince my
brother that the man was under ſome diſtreſs, which it was
poſſible he might alleviate, <hi>if he could but find it out.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
he requeſted one of the paſſengers to exchange
ſeats with him. He now placed himſelf cloſe to the poor

                     <p>"Oh! Sir, you are ſo kind, I muſt tell you. About a
fortnight ago a man came to my houſe in Devonſhire,
telling me, that a relation of mine had died very rich,
and left me and my brothers his money, but that I muſt
go to London to ſee after it, or we ſhould loſe it. I took
him in; made him very welcome; and, in a few days,
ſet out with him for London, mounted on two of my beſt
horſes. He ſaid I muſt carry a pretty good bag of
money<note n="*" place="bottom">The Editor thinks it was about £70.</note>, juſt to fee the lawyers, and bear my expences in
town. I paid the road all the way up. The morning
after we came to town, he took me to Weſtminſter Hall,
where we ſaw a vaſt many lawyers in black gowns; but
<pb n="ccccxcii" facs="tcp:0761700600:504"/>
he ſaid his lawyer was not there that day, and we muſt
go again; but adviſed me, as he was more uſed to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
than I was, to let him carry the money-bag. We
walked about, a day or two, to look at fine places, and
yeſterday we got in one place into a great crowd, and I
loſt him. I have been looking for him, and for the inn
where we lodged, and cannot for the life of me find ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I am afraid the man is a rogue, and I ſhall loſe all
my money; but that I do not value, if I could but have
got my poor horſes; for they are very fine, and worth a
deal of money."</p>
                     <p>"My brother aſked him, in what part of the town his
inn lay."—He replied, "That, never having been in
town before, he knew not, nor the ſign of the inn, only
that it had <hi>great gates.</hi>'—My brother ſaid, 'Well, my
friend, inſtead of going to my friends, you and I will go
back to London in the boat, and try to find your inn
and your horſes.'</p>
                     <p>"The poor man's countenance brightened. They returned,
ſet out on this benevolent wild-gooſe chaſe, my brother
charging the man to keep faſt hold of him if they got into
any crowd. Every inn, from Whitehall, quite through the
City, the Strand, and Holborn, was ſhewn to him. After
ſome hours they got into Alderſgate Street, at the upper
end of which the poor man exclaimed, 'Oh! God bleſs

you, Sir, <hi>this is the inn!</hi>' He flew into the yard, went to
the ſtable, where ſtood his two fine horſes, which the
ſharper had not taken away. My brother enquired if he
did not want money to take him home; the honeſt man
replied, 'No, God reward you, Sir; luckily I took three
guineas looſe in my pocket, before I gave him the bag to
take care of."</p>

               <p>The angelic-hearted Captain Hamilton left his party to
dine without him, and joined them not until the next day.
It is almoſt ſuperfluous to add, that, whilſt he reſided at
Bear-hill Houſe in Berkſhire, he was the idol of all his
neighbours, high and low.—He enjoyed the <q rend="inline">"Peace of
God,"</q> which made him ever chearful, and he had
wonderful good-will towards man. An attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe

Upon my word, Chriſtianity <hi>cuts a noble figure</hi> in the hands of ſuch an hero."</q> A naval officer, not many months ago, told the Editor what ſhe never heard before, that Captain Hamilton had not been drowned at laſt, but that he was pinioned—he was endeavouring to take off his coat, when the waves waſhed him off the third time.

This excellent man lived to Chriſt, was owned by
him in death, and is now rejoicing with him in glory.
Captain Hamilton was convinced, that not every one that
<hi>ſaith,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Lord, Lord!"</q> ſhall enter into the kingdom of Heaven.
He acted, as well as talked, like a Chriſtian, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
prayers twice every day on-board his ſhip; and,
when on land, his family was conſtantly aſſembled as
often. An eminent Divine ſays, although Adam's ſin does,
yet grace does not, run in the veins. Captain Hamilton's
mother was NOT a ſaint, <hi>i. e. ſancta,</hi> like himſelf!!!</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley's mind, from the time he could articulate,
appeared to be of ſo very extraordinary and ſingular a
turn, as determined his Mother to watch over him with the
utmoſt vigilance, during the time that, to uſe the language
of the wiſe Lord Halifax, in his Advice to his Daughter,
<q rend="inline">"We are entirely under your government, and indeed
through life you have ſo much influence over us, that it
behoves us to take the greateſt care that you (females)
are well educated."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley, when grown up, uſed frequently to ſay,
<q rend="inline">"Let a man commit whatever he can, except the not being
<pb n="ccccxcv" facs="tcp:0761700600:507"/>

That was his Mother's fault, poor young man!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Berkeley as conſtantly charged the improper beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of young ladies on the father, <hi>if</hi> he was a man who
had lived in the world. It would be cruel to charge it on a
man entirely devoted to ſtudy; but there are few ſuch now
amongſt perſons of a certain rank in ſociety.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Berkeley, from long obſervation, ſaw how naturally
youths are attached to the mother, and girls to the father.
The reaſon is obvious. The mother is not finding fault
with her Son's ſlovenly Latin and Greek exerciſes; nor the
father of the young lady's monkey-tricks, when ſhe ſhould
be learning Hiſtory, Geography, Drawing, Muſic, &amp;c. ſo
much as often to occaſion the late excellent Lady P<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

the boſom-friend from early infancy of the Editor, to ſay
<q rend="inline">"It was impoſſible that children, particularly girls, ſhould
love a mother that did her duty as ſhe ought by them."</q>
She, as her friend always aſſured her ſhe would, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
the contrary. Her children, when they grew up,
were lovely, and loved her much. She was indeed lovely; ſhe
has frequently wept with vexation, that ſhe had not the
clam, not to be ſhaken, ſteadineſs of mr. Berkeley's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It was perhaps, according to the old French pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Dieu donne la robe ſelon le froid.</hi>"</q> Mr. Berkeley's
maternal grandfather, with the ſame lovely nature as Mr.
<pb n="ccccxcvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:508"/>
Berkeley had, when a child of only four years and an half
old, on his father's whipping him the third time for wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
reſolved, as the Writer of this Preface has often
heard him ſay, to tire his father out; and he thought that
about ſeven or eight times would do it. Luckily for him
his mother intreated his father to give it up: to which
he replied, <q rend="inline">"No; I will whip him till to-morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
rather than let him get the better of me."</q> THAT
he thought would be <hi>rather</hi> too long; ſo inſtantly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>It was really entertaining to hear from Mr. Berkeley,
when grown up, his wonderfully deep-laid ſchemes to
conquer his Mother; but he uſed to add, <q rend="inline">"I never did
once ſucceed; yet ſtill I perſevered, till reaſon, pretty
early in life, convinced me of my folly."</q> He would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
exclaim, <q rend="inline">"Oh! the Wiſe King was inſpired, when
he gave his leſſons for education in the book of Proverbs;
and, bleſſed be God, MY Mother had the ſenſe to make
his directions the rule of her conduct. God knows what
would have become of me by the time I had been ten
years old, with my ſort of ſpirit and temper."</q>
               </p>
               <p>From two years old until the laſt breath he drew, perhaps
no one ever loved a Mother with ſuch exquiſite tenderneſs
as Mr. Berkeley; of which a million of inſtances might be
related. Mrs. Berkeley uſed often to ſay, on ſhewing any
<pb n="ccccxcvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:509"/>
curious thing preſented to her by Mr. Berkeley, <q rend="inline">"I am
perſuaded, if my Son viſited any odd place, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was to be procured but tanned bulls' hides, he
would ſay, Pray pick out the very beſt, and ſend it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to Mrs. Berkeley, the Oaks, Canterbury."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley's gratitude to his Father was very great on
ſeveral accounts, particularly on two. Mr. Berkeley from a
child, and through life, was an enthuſiaſtic lover of muſic.
Like moſt, he was exceedingly anxious to learn to play the
violin, which his Father early, very wiſely, told him he
<hi>never</hi> ſhould do; and Mr. Berkeley uſed always to ſay,
<q rend="inline">"He was ſure, had he learned, it would have been his
deſtruction."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the early part of Mr. Berkeley's life, he played on the
German flute; but an hereditary illneſs, the aſthma, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked
him at the age of about ſeventeen. The advice of
the very judicious, worthy Dr. Biddle of Windſor, ſo entirely
cured him, that he never had a ſecond ſerious attack. The
Doctor ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Mr. Berkeley was the youngeſt patient he
ever attended in that frightful diſorder."</q> He bade him
lay aſide his German flute, and charged him never to give
the view halloo. Mr. Berkeley at that time hunted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
twice a week with the buck-hounds<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Berkeley uſed frequently, at his return on hunting days, to ſay, <q rend="inline">"There is a fellow, a well-mounted butcher, that I longed to knock down. He ſeems to <hi>delight</hi> in croſſing the King, ſo as really ſometimes to endanger his Majeſty. <hi>Nothing ever</hi> makes me do it. I wonder what the wretch is made of."</q> To which Dr. Berkeley uſed to reply, <q rend="inline">"Why of <hi>bulls' hides,</hi> child, to be ſure."</q> His heart certainly was not caſt in the ſame mould with
the amiable, elegant butcher, ſtanding to repreſent the town of Hythe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, whoſe conduct on the huſtings to the Peer that oppoſed him is well known to every Kentiſh perſon.</note>. He wiſely

The father and mother of Biſhop Berkeley, although not
at all related before their marriage (Mrs. Berkeley was
aunt to old General Wolfe, father of the famous General of
that name,) both died in the ſame week of the aſthma,
and were interred at the ſame time in the ſame grave.
They were a happy pair through life, and happy in not

A very few years ago, an Iriſh gentleman told Dr. Berkeley, that a malicious boy one day cut it clean out, for which the Maſter flogged him very ſeverely. The Editor does not recollect the name; but thinks it was not JONES: perhaps the poor ſtupid boy did it on the ſame principle on which the low-lived wretch acted, who burned the Temple of Diana at Epheſus.</note>. They lived to ſee the eldeſt

honour to epiſcopacy, by his learning, his munificence, his

The Sunday after the hard froſt ſet in, the Biſhop ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
at breakfaſt with his <hi>Cloyne-made</hi> wig. All the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's
<hi>own</hi> cloaths, as well as his liveries, were conſtantly
made at the <hi>little</hi> village of Cloyne. He permitted his ſons
to employ a Cork tailor. The Biſhop's wig was without a

neither will I."</q> The chaplain, ſecretary, and all, took
the hint. A certain Biſhop, as ſoon as the tax was laid,
took out a licence for three men, and his Lady's maid.
Biſhop Berkeley, during the froſt and ſcarcity, gave, every
Monday morning, twenty guineas to the poor.</p>
               <p>Primate Boulter gave to the poor that winter ten thouſand

The Biſhop of Cork was great uncle to the Reverend
James Brown of Rivers Town, the preſent poſſeſſor of the
fine ring, the only jewel which his truly honourable grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
would accept from the Spaniſh lady, after Colonel
Brown had ſaid,
<q>
                     <l>"Ceaſe, fair lady, ceaſe this ſtrife;</l>
                     <l>"I have in England a fair lady wife.</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To be ſure, Colonel Brown had ſome <hi>odd</hi> ideas, perhaps
from his grandmother, from which moſt of our modern
heroes are <hi>entirely</hi> free. As to the generality of our fair
dames of theſe days, if they chance to meet with a humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
or unkind huſband<note n="*" place="bottom">Parents are <hi>wretches</hi> who marry poor girls of ſixteen or ſeventeen to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, to Hodmadods, becauſe they are rich. The Editor had formerly two friends thus ſacrificed at ſixteen; one had thirty-five thouſand pounds, the other had ſeventy thouſand pounds. Neither, had they been permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſingle until twenty-two, would have taken their huſbands for <hi>under</hi>-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

in the laſt century, would be to ſuppoſe that miracles had
not <hi>then</hi> ceaſed; but the beauteous young dames were then
differently educated, and <hi>decently</hi> attired.</p>
               <p>A few years ago, Mr. Brown taking his ring off to waſh
his fingers after dinner, three ladies hid it from him. For
three days he ſuppoſed it loſt, and was, as he well might,
exceedingly diſtreſſed. They deſerved a trip at leaſt
<hi>half way</hi> to Botany Bay for their cruelty; ſince which he
has never worne it, but keeps the invaluable jewel locked
up, and only ſhews it to thoſe friends who wiſh to ſee ſo
noble, ſo honourable a curioſity.</p>
               <p>In one of Mr. Berkeley's idle fits, he was wild to go into
the Army, that he might take a <hi>handſome</hi> leave of Greek
and Latin; and, by a noble connexion of his Father's, he
had the offer of a Cornetcy in the Oxford Blues. This, at
the age of fifteen, put him into an extacy; and he uſed
all his eloquent rhetoric on his Father to obtain his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
but, as he uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"Happily in thoſe things
<pb n="dii" facs="tcp:0761700600:514"/>
my Father was as ſteady as my Mother in other reſpects
where ſhe was concerned."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Berkeley uſed to ſay to his Son, <q rend="inline">"If, after you

               </p>
               <p>Dr. Berkeley valued an Engliſh, <hi>i.e.</hi> not a <hi>foreign</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
education, as highly as did the Editor from the age
of fifteen. <hi>Nothing</hi> could have tempted her to marry a
gentleman who had not paſſed ſome years either at Oxford,
Cambridge, or Dublin. It certainly infuſes ſomething into
the brains even of the moſt <hi>hair-brained</hi> youths that they
very rarely get elſewhere. Several gentlemen of the
different regiments of cavalry conſtantly quartered at Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury
had received that advantage; and Dr. Berkeley,
who ſometimes dined at the meſs with his military ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
at his return home uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"I wonder all
the young men, when they ſee the deference paid by

               <p>Mr. Berkeley, during his reſidence in Scotland, accepted a
commiſſion in the Royal Edinburgh Volunteers, raiſed to
quell ſome riots in the neighbourhood of that city; which
occaſioned a gentleman's aſking him, <q rend="inline">"if he had not ſome

thoughts of going into the army."</q> He replied, <q rend="inline">"No, Sir,
my Father's wiſdom kept me out when I was an idle boy,
and my own will keep me out now that I am a man.
Nothing but his Majeſty's erecting his ſtandard will ever
make <hi>me a</hi> military man; in that caſe, I ſhould feel it
my DUTY to repair to it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>One trait more of Mr. Berkeley's ſingular temper ſhall
ſuffice. Like all other children, he had been early told,
that it was utterly impoſſible to form a ſyllable in any
known language without the aid of at leaſt one vowel.
It was Mrs. Berkeley's conſtant cuſtom to go every night,
before ſhe ſat down to ſupper, to the <hi>rooms</hi> of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
(for ſhe never ſuffered them to ſleep together) to ſee
if they lay ſtraight, and had cloſed their eyes before they
went to ſleep, as many eyes are injured by ſleeping without
this neceſſary care. One night, on entering Mr. Berkeley's
room, ſhe ſaw his fine eyes rolling about, and began to
give him a leſſon for not going to ſleep as ſoon as he went
to bed, at ſeven. He replied, <q rend="inline">"I cannot ſleep for think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing"</q>—(the miſery of too many older perſons; it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

The Editor has not heard of any of her beloved reſpected

               <p>Mrs. George Berkeley, being little addicted to going
from home, and Dr. Berkeley's hoſpitality very great, Mr.
Monck Berkeley, when any of his <hi>ton</hi> friends or acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

<q rend="inline">"that ſhe was the <hi>good woman</hi> who kept the ſign of the

Berkeley, that the next time he viſited at home, he brought
a print of Lord Berkeley's arms, framed and glazed.</p>
               <p>The next day Mrs. Berkeley, paſſing through the hall,

(He continued it for his beloved Mr. Monck Berkeley.) One of which jokes was a ring at the front gate, juſt as it was duſk, to make Dr. Berkeley believe that his dear Jem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Hamilton was arrived, as Mr. Hamilton never fixed the day.

               <p>It may perhaps be aſked, how became Mr. Berkeley
ſo well acquainted, ſo intereſted, for this lovely unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Princeſs? His noble friends at Blenheim did him the
honour to invite Mr. Berkeley, during her Highneſs's viſit
at their delightful abode. Mr. Berkeley eſcorted her to
Nuneham, and waited on her whilſt ſhe viewed all the
noble buildings, paintings, &amp;c. at Oxford. She ſaid ſhe
much wiſhed to ſee Cambridge; but that, if ſhe went, ſhe
feared ſhe ſhould not find <hi>a</hi> Mr. Berkeley there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley, with his wonted amiablility and alertneſs,
told her Highneſs, that <q rend="inline">"if ſhe wiſhed to go thither, he
would, with great pleaſure, give her a letter of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction

He accordingly did ſo. She ſaid, <q rend="inline">"She wiſhed to ſee
every thing that was curious during her ſtay in England;"</q>
adding, <q rend="inline">"I hear that there is a curious Cathedral at Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury.
I ſaw nothing but a very old city, and a vaſt

On hearing this, her Highneſs exulted, expecting, probably,
to find as good a ſhow-man in the Father as ſhe had found in
the Son. Dr. Berkeley could moſt elegantly, moſt highly,
entertain his friends in almoſt every <hi>other</hi> way; but, as a
ſhow-man, he was ſo notoriouſly bad, that a gentleman, a
very near relation of his, uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"George is the idleſt
dog upon earth. One may come from Ireland, ſtay a
month at Cookham, live on the fat of the land, and, but
for Mrs. George Berkeley, go back again without ſeeing
even either Cliefden's 'proud alcove,' or Windſor Caſtle,
to ſay nothing of half a ſcore other beautiful places
within a drive of his houſe, to which, with much ado,
Mrs. Berkeley drags him, as ſhe will not leave him to
dine at home without her."</q> The Editor laid it down as
a rule when ſhe married, and ſhe ſtrictly adhered to it,
never to go any where in a morning, that would not admit
of her placing herſelf at table at three o'clock, unleſs Dr.
Berkeley ordered dinner later.</p>
               <p>Dr. Berkeley was famous, when at Oxford, for <hi>not</hi> going

'Oh! not <hi>I</hi> indeed; <hi>I</hi> have ſeen Blenheim.'—So now it
is, '<hi>I</hi> have ſeen Windſor Caſtle,"</q> &amp;c. The fact is, Dr.

Berkeley, on his arrival at Oxford, the firſt long vacation,
flew half over England; added to which, any bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe

years, a conſtant hectic feveriſhneſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley did not at all reſemble a late worthy Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

I am <hi>really</hi> in love with her without knowing it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Some pains were taken to conceal from Mr. Berkeley,
juſt then within a few days of his death, the dreadful fate
of this lady, and of poor Louis the Sixteenth; but in
vain. It was ſaid, <q rend="inline">"that the monſter who murdered this lady
received the wages of his iniquity in England, at the
banking-houſe of an old amiable friend of Mr. Monck
Berkeley, Mr. Chambers in Bond Street, one poor hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

This brings to the Editor's remembrance a dialogue that
many years ago paſſed between the late King George the
Second and the French Ambaſſador at Herenhauſen, one
day at dinner, when a relation of the Editor, the late Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Powney, Eſquire, Fellow of All Souls College, had
the honour to dine with his Majeſty, who, when abroad,
laid aſide royalty, and wiſhed his gueſts to forget that he
was a King.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſador, a lively man, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"YOU poor Kings ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
made ſo <hi>pitiful</hi> figures as when Joſhua had <hi>ſeven</hi> of you
ſhut up in a cave together."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The King replied, <q rend="inline">"Ah! you Papiſts do not read the
Bible, or you would know that he had but <hi>five</hi> of us in
the cave."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Powney, who entertained a table full of company at
Dr. Berkeley's with this anecdote, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Every one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
the ready wit of the King;"</q> and all the company
laughed heartily.</p>
               <p>This lovely—muſt one ſtyle her unhappy or happy?—Princeſs
could not avail herſelf of Mr. Monck Berkeley's
politeneſs.</p>
               <p>An order arriving in England from the unfortunate Louis
XVI. for all his ſubjects to return to France, an expreſs
<pb n="dxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:531"/>
followed the Princeſs to Cambridge. The Editor thinks
ſhe recollects hearing her Son ſay that ſhe had been there
ſome days.</p>
               <p>This order was ſo urgent, that the Princeſs only ſtayed in
Canterbury to change horſes for Dover, at three in the
morning. At eight Mr. Monck Berkeley's letter, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
above as to be received from the fair hands of the
beauteous Princeſs, was brought to the Oaks by the honeſt
hoſtler of the Lyon, and delivered with <q rend="inline">"<hi>Mrs. Lambelle's</hi> beſt
compliments to Mrs. Berkeley, and ſhe was very ſorry ſhe
could not viſit her as it was ſo early, but that ſhe ſhould
be in Canterbury again very ſoon, when ſhe would come—and
that Mr. Berkeley, the gentleman who wrote the letter,
which Mrs. Lambelle charged him to deliver ſafe, was
very well."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Princeſs's degradation by the honeſt hoſtler afforded
much diverſion to Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley and their friends.
Alas! what degradation did her lovely, lifeleſs from ſuffer
after it was lifeleſs? for, it is very certain ſhe <q rend="inline">"never <hi>ſaw,</hi>"</q>
although ſhe taſted, as every mortal muſt, death; for her
ſweet ſpirit was diſmiſſed from the lovely caſket in a ſingle
inſtant. Happy if found waſhed clean in the atoning blood
of God, cloathed with the robes of HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS,
and her ſpirit renewed by <hi>that</hi> Spirit which HE died to

has heard Dr. Berkeley ſay, his great-grandfather, Mr.

               <p>The late very pious Dr. Booth, Dean of Windſor, was
ſo addicted to talk on the ſame <hi>delightful</hi> ſubject, that the

to her houſe, when ſhe reſided at Windſor thirty-ſix years

When laſt at Canterbury, the Editor requeſted her wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
friend, the throughly elegant amiable Mrs. Hughes, to
ſay to her relation, the Reverend Mr. Hambley, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
vicar of Cookham, how very ſenſibly dear Dr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
and herſelf felt that univerſally beloved gentleman's po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,
generous, pleaſant conduct, on Dr. Berkeley reſigning
that lovely ſpot. Leſt it ſhould have ſlipped that lady's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
the Editor inſerts part of a letter of hers to Dr.
Berkeley, who, as well as her Son, preſerved all her ſcrawls:
<q rend="inline">"You bade me draw the character of your ſucceſſor (at
Cookham). You obſerved that he had LYONS in his bearing
armorial: to <hi>that</hi> they are confined, I really believe. He
ſeems to have much of the Lamb in his nature and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and I do not ſuſpect that he is a wolf in ſheep's
cloathing; which I abhor. Suppoſe we get our worthy
friend Sir Iſaac to exchange the noble Savage for the
lovely Lamb for him?"</q> Mrs. Berkeley gladly embraces this
opportunity of holding up to its merited praiſe ſo amiable
a character.</p>
               <p>It may be aſked, <q rend="inline">"What could <hi>Mrs.</hi> Berkeley have to
do with dilapidations during the life of Dr. Berkeley?"</q>
She has, alas! had <hi>too</hi> much to do with them ſince his
lamented death. Dr. Berkeley never took dilapidations,
but at Acton a very trifle, and at Canterbury not forty
pounds, and immediately expended on the Prebendal Houſe
<pb n="dxx" facs="tcp:0761700600:534"/>
more than two hundred pounds. The Editor aſked him how
he came to take any, as he never had before, and Dr. Sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
did not die rich; he ſweetly replied, <q rend="inline">"Becauſe I had
not you here to remind me not to do it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Berkeley uſed always, from the time he married, to
leave all buſineſs that he thought might have any thing at
all unpleaſant in it to Mrs. Berkeley, laughingly ſaying.
<q rend="inline">"it was the pleaſanteſt thing in the world to have a wife,
that one could metamorphoſe into a ſteward; that although <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <p>One day, an amiable Counteſs, a lovely friend of the
Editor's youth, dining at the <hi>ſaid</hi> wiſe man's, with other
company, after the ladies were retired to the drawing-room,
the butler came, whiſpered the lady; after ſome time he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated

the old proverb, he entered, and whiſpered loud enough
for every one to hear, <q rend="inline">"Madam, if you do not pleaſe to

               </p>
               <p>Beer is generally ſpoiled <hi>by</hi> hops; and the Editor has
been repeatedly told, that there is ſtill an act of Queen
Elizabeth <hi>unrepealed,</hi> forbidding the <q rend="inline">"planting or culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
that <hi>pernicious weed</hi> called hop."</q> (The Editor has
heard from her youth that the law for extinguiſhing fire on
the tolling the curfew bell is alſo unrepealed—She is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>tempted</hi> to wiſh it was enforced.) Perhaps there are
few perſons who fully know the wholeſomeneſs of aged
hard beer. The Editor has frequently heard the late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Mrs. Tucker, of Canterbury, ſay, that when her
father was head maſter of the King's School, the ſecond
maſters, and the other boarding houſes, had, ſummer after
ſummer, a very bad fever amongſt the boys; but her father,
Mr. Gurney, had not a boy ill, which <hi>he</hi> attributed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely,
under God, to their drinking very hard <hi>home-brewed</hi>
beer. He brewed, as they do in all <hi>wiſe</hi> gentlemen's fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
only twice in the year, in March and October. All
the world have of late found out the virtues of beer without
hops. New, or as it is commonly called ſweet-wort, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="dxxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:536"/>
for worms in children, and for ſcurvies in men;
and when the poiſon of the ſtrong rank weed, hop, is gone
off, it is <hi>aqua vitae</hi> to many, to the Editor, even when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
vinegar; but a table ſpoonful of ſtale brewer's beer is
almoſt death to her. <hi>Qu.</hi> Why is this?</p>
               <p>The lady, however, begged excuſe, went, and did her
<hi>duty as houſekeeper.</hi> Her huſband built a very fine houſe,
but would have no back door, that <hi>he</hi> might ſee the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his half hundred of ſervants all day long. The
Editor, then about ſeventeen, offered to lay a wager with
a gentleman, that within two years he would break out a
back door; he did it within one.</p>
               <p>The Editor now experiences the want of a back <hi>gate</hi> at
leaſt. She has few ſervants, but, thank God, they are
not eye ſervants, ſo want not watching, but there are many
beggars who do; for <q rend="inline">"theſe beaſts of the <hi>people,</hi>"</q> on

               <p>The Editor, and a lady with her, went a few weeks ago
into a ſhop: a girl, about thirteen, ſhabbily dreſſed, came
in, aſked for a pennyworth of gingerbread; it was cut;
and alſo for a pennyworth of ſugar candy; the miſtreſs of
the ſhop ſenſibly aſked, <q rend="inline">"Would you have both?"</q>

               </p>
               <p>This being at the time when bread was at its very higheſt
price, and WISE people believed we had no corn in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the Editor aſked, <q rend="inline">"If ſhe lived at D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Beggar.—<q rend="inline">"No, we only travels about."</q>—That is, we are
common beggars; can it be charity to relieve ſuch?</p>
               <p>The Editor, at length getting ſight of moſt of the ſheets
at once, is confirmed in what ſhe ſuſpected; that ſhe has
been guilty of tautology, of Egotiſm, or rather <hi>Editoriſm.</hi>
It is ſaid of the excellent Lord Chancellor Clarendon, that,
in his incomparable Hiſtory of the Rebellion, the <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
of the Exchequer</hi> is <hi>too</hi> often introduced.</p>
               <p>The Editor has always thought that there is at <hi>leaſt</hi> as
much, if not more, in the circumlocution often practiſed,
and ſhe is certain a vaſt deal of affectation, which ſhe ever
<pb n="dxxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:538"/>
abhorred, does ſtill abhor, eſpecially in matrons, and pities
in girls, in perſons relating tranſactions, in which they
were <hi>neceſſarily</hi> principal actors, front figures, who cannot
be thrown into the <hi>back-ground</hi> without ruining the picture,
as is done by <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, by uſing circumlocution
in mentioning themſelves. It is like a very plain woman
<hi>decking</hi> herſelf <hi>violently;</hi> it <hi>calls attention,</hi> but does not,
according to the Editor's humble opinion, in <hi>either</hi> caſe,
<hi>create reſpect.</hi> It muſt be conſidered that through life there
was ſo conſtant an intercourſe, whether preſent or abſent,
between Mr. Berkeley and his Mother, that She has, during
the writing theſe ſheets, frequently ſtudied how to put her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a dark corner, which has been much more difficult
than the doing that kind office to her dear Son, until he
attained to the age of five, when <hi>that</hi> mode of puniſhment
ceaſed, and another ſomewhat ſimilar was ſubſtituted.</p>
               <p>The Editor, perhaps, (having deſcribed herſelf as the <hi>moſt
reſolute of all females,</hi> where her children or her conſcience
were concerned,) owes it to herſelf to ſay, that it is
moſt certain that ſhe is not curſed with a <hi>ſtubborn</hi> or a <hi>ſaucy</hi>
ſpirit: both were pretty eaſily by her wiſe mother nipped
almoſt <hi>before</hi> they were <hi>in bud.</hi> When ſhe was not quite
four years old, being very buſily employed in underſſing
her doll, to put it into the cradle, in an arbore at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
part of a very long walk, her mother called her: thus
<hi>importantly</hi> occupied, ſhe, conceiving that it could not be
<pb n="dxxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:539"/>
heard, uttered the following ſoliloquy, <q rend="inline">"<hi>I won't come till I
have done.</hi>"</q> Very ſoon appeared the amiable woman who
had taken care of here from a month old, (for, thank God,
her mother was her nurſe,) with <q rend="inline">"Oh! <hi>fie,</hi> Miſs, how came
you to ſay ſuch a naughty word to my Miſtreſs?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"What
word?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Why you know, Miſs, you ſaid <hi>I won't
come.</hi>"</q> Miſs did <hi>not</hi> deny it, knowing, from the time ſhe
could articulate, that a LIE, even with her father, was a
threat of being whipped, <q rend="inline">"<hi>all</hi> but to death."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The little culprit was delivered to her mother, ſtanding at
the garden door to receive her. She can almoſt fancy that
her wriſt, when ſhe thinks of it, feels the graſp of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
elegant long fingers, and hears her ſay, <q rend="inline">"<hi>You won't
come,</hi> MADAM, will you?"</q> In ſhe was taken, ſhewn a nice
ſlice of bread covered with currant jelly on the table.
<q rend="inline">"Look you there, I called you to give you that for your
ſupper. You will now go to bed without any ſupper,
but a good whipping;"</q> which was inſtantly adminiſtered,
to teach her never to ſay <q rend="inline">"I won't"</q> again to her mother or
father. It proved effectual; for, the Editor can, with
ſtricteſt truth, aſſert, that this was the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>laſt</hi> time
that <hi>frightful</hi> word was ever pronounced by her, to either
parent.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed the gracious Giver of every good gift to ſpare
that excellent mother until her daughter was twenty years
<pb n="dxxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:540"/>
old, although at the time of her father's death no one
would have given half a year's purchaſe for her life; and ſhe
has frequently told her daughters, when grown up, that
every breaking up, when ſhe returned them to Mrs.
Sheeles's, that ſhe conceived ſhe had taken her <hi>laſt</hi> leave of
them. The Editor often cannot refrain exclaiming, to her
excellent ſiſter, <q rend="inline">"How gracious was God to us in ſparing
our angelic Mother!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>To ſhew that the Editor needed not much diſcipline to
bring her to ſubmit to <hi>lawful</hi> authority, a ſimple little ſtory
may, ſhe hopes, be excuſed. The <hi>fault</hi> is obliterated from
her memory; the <hi>puniſhment</hi> never can, and her conſequent
ſufferings. One of the Fathers, deſcribing woman, ſays,
<q rend="inline">"<hi>She is an animal delighting in finery.</hi>"</q> A very pretty pale
blue (the Editor's favourite colour, from her cradle, for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
to this time) bonnet had juſt arrived with ſome things
of her mother's from town; which ſhe had contrived to get
ſight of half a dozen times during the morning, and was
told ſhe was to wear it in the afternoon to go viſit Miſs
Sloper, ſiſter of General Sir Robert Sloper; Mr. and Mrs. Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
then lived at Waltham Place. (This young lady died at
Mrs. Dennis's ſchool.) Whether elated by ſo frequently
contemplating the <hi>beautiful</hi> bonnet, or in what elſe ſhe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
whether by flying up one pair of ſtairs and down
the other of the old houſe, a favourite amuſement with both
ſiſters when their <hi>Mother</hi> was out of the houſe. Be this,
<pb n="dxxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:541"/>
however, as it may, the culprit was called, well-jobed, and
told, that inſtead of going out viſiting in the new bonnet,
ſhe was to ſtay at home tied by the arm to, ſhe believes, the
firſt fly-table ever made in England, made according to Mrs.
Frinſham's own directions given to a country cabinet-maker,
and which ſhe (the culprit) could have drawn all over
the houſe. She ſupplicated for pardon, but in vain;
ſhe was made to ſit down on the floor under the table,
tied by the left arm. She was tied with a good long nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleful
of common white ſilk, taken from a ball in her
mother's Indian work-bowl. She wept much a little while,
but, being naturally of a very cheerful diſpoſition, ſoon
dried her eyes, and began to amuſe herſelf with ſcratching
a tree and ſome flowers on the ſhining old oak floor, with
a large pin that ſhe had coaxed out of her frock behind.</p>
               <p>The Editor's delight in drawing and mixing colours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced,
ſhe remembers, before ſhe left off her back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring.
Thus amuſed, ſhe <hi>forgot</hi> that ſhe was a priſoner,
and had crawled quite to the ſtretch of her tether. On
finding it, ſhe was in ſuch terror leſt the ſilk ſhould break,
and that her mother ſhould think that ſhe had dared to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
herſelf, that ſhe crept ſo cloſe to the leg of the table
as to let the ſilk hang in a loop for conſiderably more than
an hour, not amuſing herſelf in any way but the delight
ariſing from her happineſs that the ſilk had <hi>not</hi> broke.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="dxxviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:542"/>
It may perhaps, by ſome, be thought ſtrange, that a <hi>very</hi>
docile girl ſhould make ſo very reſolute a mother. Her
diſpoſition is naturally yielding, except when duty called
for ſteadineſs, as in the caſe of Mr. Berkeley. His brother
was as eaſily governed as his Mother.</p>
               <p>The Editor had the happineſs, ſhe ſtill feels it ſuch, that
her mother bore teſtimony to the amenableneſs of her
temper a very few months before her <q rend="inline">"ſlow ſudden death."</q>
A beloved friend of the Editor was ſtrenuouſly aſſerting,
<q rend="inline">"that every human being was <hi>ſtubborn,</hi> and would, if <hi>poſſible,</hi>
get their own will; that nothing but ſuperior abſolute
force prevented it;"</q> adding, <q rend="inline">"ſhew me any man,
woman, or child, that is <hi>not</hi> ſtubborn, and I will ſhew
you a <hi>black ſwan.</hi>"</q> Some late travellers have diſcovered
this <hi>rara avis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Editor conſtantly oppoſed the doctrine of <hi>univerſal
ſtubbornneſs,</hi> and inſiſted, that, although ſhe had MANY
faults, ſhe was certainly not a <hi>wilful</hi> being; and reſpectfully
requeſted her mother to ſay whether ſhe thought <hi>her</hi> ſo.
Mrs. Frinſham laid down her work, and, lifting up her

The mentioning of theſe things brings to the Editor's
recollection a converſation with her Son not many months
before his death, telling a friend, who had a violent-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
little boy, <q rend="inline">"that ſhe ſhould contrive to prevent his
crying and ſcreaming ſo violently as deſcribed, as it was
dangerous, and often productive of bad conſequences to
<hi>boys'</hi> health;"</q> adding, <q rend="inline">"that ſhe always took care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it with her own boys; that when ſhe had locked
them into a light room, (no child ſhould ever be ſhut
into a dark room; ſad conſequences have ariſen from it;)
and got the key in her own pocket, that no ſervant might
<hi>kindly</hi> adminiſter conſolation, ſhe always ſtood to liſten till
the roaring ceaſed."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon Mr. Berkeley ſaid, <q rend="inline">"My dear Mother, did
you, <hi>could</hi> you think that I was fool enough to ſcream a
moment longer than I thought you were in hearing?
I ſtrained my lungs that you might hear as long as I
conceived it poſſible you ſhould hear." (Mrs. Berkeley
had often obſerved that the laſt ſhout was the moſt violent.)
"I then immediately reached down ſome book, (the priſon
was generally the Editor's book cloſet,) to amuſe me till
the hour, or the two hours, according to my ſentence,

The Editor, on peruſing the ſheets quite ready for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication,
finds that ſhe has omitted many anecdotes that
muſt have heightened the ideas of Mr. Monck Berkeley's
wiſdom and amiability, and his undaunted courage. His
reſcuing a poor little child late one night near Covent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
as he was going home to his chambers. He met the

               <p>The Editor rejoices very ſincerely, that PROVIDENCE
has ſome time ago delivered his Lordſhip into the hands of
a very ſenſible worthy Lady, who has brought him a ſon
<pb n="dxxxii" facs="tcp:0761700600:546"/>
and heir to his vaſt eſtate. May he grow up as amiable as
his father, as ſenſible as his mother!</p>
               <p>The Editor, on peruſing the ſheets of this wonderfully
long Preface <hi>de ſuite tout enſemble</hi> is hurt to find, that her
memory is become ſo treacherous as to have permitted her
to be ſo guilty of tautology, at the diſtance of little more
than ſix months, to have twice quoted ſome favourite lines
of Mr. Addiſon. This, however, may be pardoned, for
they are beautiful, and ſhe repeats the hymn of which they
form a part every day; but repeating her own remarks or
comments ſhe laments, as ſhe does her <hi>ſeeming</hi> ingratitude,
when, mentioning the amiable hoſpitality of Scotland, ſhe
perceives ſhe has omitted to mention the very highly polite
attentions received by Dr. Berkeley's family, from the very
elegant ſiſter of the worthy Lord Newark, reſident at St.
Andrew's when Dr. Berkeley's family went to reſide there;
<q rend="inline">"although laſt, yet not leaſt,"</q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A lady, the other day, ſaid to the Editor, <q rend="inline">"that our
Nobility wanted a <hi>little</hi> humbling; that to be ſure they
had carried the matter <hi>much too far</hi> in France; but a <hi>little</hi>
humbling would do them ſervice for both worlds."</q> The
Editor begged that the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> in general, excepting ſome
few, might be ſpared; and, as they took the advice of our
bleſſed Maſter, and amiably <q rend="inline">"humbled themſelves, that they
and ſome few Engliſh might be exempted from the <hi>ſaid
humbling.</hi>"</q>

                  <pb n="dxxxiii" facs="tcp:0761700600:547"/>
The Editor has not the honour to be known at preſent
to many Nobleſſe,
<q>"<hi>The world forgetting, by the world forgot;</hi>"</q> but ſhe is apt to think that <hi>modern</hi> Nobility are addicted to
ſet more value on a coronet than thoſe to whom it has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
by hereditary ſucceſſion through ſeveral genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Berkeley ſome years ago had the honour to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond
with ſome Engliſh Nobles of both ſexes, now no
more. Very many of their letters are preſerved—as polite
as if <hi>ſhe</hi> had been noble.</p>
               <p>Several years ago the Editor took leave to write to a
modern Peereſs, requeſting a very ſmall favour for a young
lady, <hi>very very</hi> much Mrs. Berkeley's ſuperior, not to ſay by
birth the Peereſs's. The anſwer was returned on an half-ſheet
of common paper, ſealed with a wafer pricked with a pin,
expreſſing aſtoniſhment that the Editor could ſuppoſe ſhe
could do what ſhe requeſted,—uſe her intereſt to procure
a vacant twenty pounds <hi>per annum</hi> for a poor lady, who
muſt have had the PAS of the Peereſs until her Lord was
a few years ago created a Peer. What made it <hi>ſtill ſtranger</hi>
to the <hi>poor ſimple</hi> Editor was, that when the Peereſs and
herſelf were both girls, the Peereſs's lovely mother felt,
at leaſt expreſſed herſelf (ſhe had the grace of humility)
<pb n="dxxxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:548"/>
obliged by the Editor's mother's attentions to her and her
little girl, now the <hi>little</hi> Peereſs. This occured not long
after the Editor's return to England, and ſhe ſuppoſed
that ſome great revolution in politeneſs had taken place
during her abſence, and that poor untitled gentry muſt
approach Nobility as Swift makes the ſubjects of Japan
approach their Emperor, and <q rend="inline">"lick the duſt as they crawl
towards him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Editor's ideas concerning a revolution in manners
were, however, ſoon corrected, by her having the honour
to receive letters <hi>à l'égarde de ſon cher fils</hi> from her amiable
friend, Lord Loughborouh. An inſtance of his Lordſhip's
amiability, related to her by another old friend, the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Mr. Berridge, the hoſpitable maſter of John à Gaunt's
Caſtle, emboldened her, at the diſtance of near a quarter
of a century, to write to his Lordſhip to introduce that
dear young man, telling his Lordſhip, <q rend="inline">"that naturaliſts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
us, that the moſt timid animals become courageous
where their young are concerned, that ſhe felt the truth
of the aſſertion."</q> His Lordſhip's, and good Lady Lough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough's
attentions are carefully regiſtered in her grateful
memory. His Lordſhip's anſwer was moſt polite and
friendly. Their amiable Graces of Marlborough, and the
late excellent Lady Effingham, who have chanced to
honour the Editor with letters, have written on <hi>whole</hi> ſheets
of gilt paper, moſt condeſcendingly ſubſcribed, and ſealed
<pb n="dxxxv" facs="tcp:0761700600:549"/>
—as to a gentlewoman—not to be mantua-maker. Indeed
the Editor uſed to write more reſpectfully to the famous
Mrs. Munday, her old playfellow, niece of John Breedon,
Eſquire, of Bear-Court, Berks, when ſhe wanted a new
<hi>négligée.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The poor lady for whom the Editor ſupplicated the
Peereſs's intereſt, for only a poor vacant twenty pounds <hi>per
annum,</hi> has the honour, at leaſt her grandfather had, and
upwards for <hi>very many</hi> centuries, the honour to have two
crowned heads, put on mourning at their deceaſe, (as,
whilſt there was a King in France, was always done by that
King when the head of the Courtney family died,) which
the Editor is <hi>very</hi> ſure no crowned head ever did for <hi>her</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,
nor, as ſhe verily believes, for thoſe of Captain <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

ſhewed her high birth, by ſubmitting with, the Editor really
thinks, unexampled fortitude and true unaffected dignity,
to the diſtreſſes to which an imprudent match, in <hi>very</hi>
early youth, had unavoidably ſubjected herſelf, her elegant
huſband, and lovely little girl. Although Mrs. Berkeley
failed to obtain relief from the <hi>courtly,</hi> COURTEOUS <hi>Peereſs,</hi>
the amiable Dr. Berkeley's pocket failed not to alleviate
their <hi>deep</hi> diſtreſs; for which the young gentleman bleſſed
him when dying. His ſenſible, grateful relict and lovely
daughter continue to bleſs his ſweet memory. Dr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
<pb n="dxxxvi" facs="tcp:0761700600:550"/>
is receiving his reward; the Peereſs <hi>ſtill</hi> enjoys her <hi>new</hi>
coronet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Monck Berkeley, a great herald from ten years old,
was conſulted at twenty-two by a noble, amiable Peer, a
great herald, a friend of the Peereſs's Lord elect, about
ſupporters to be added when the arms of <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> were to
be <hi>tipped</hi> with a coronet. Mentioning the ſelection Mr.
Monck Berkeley firſt made would too plainly mark out the
Peereſs, who, it is hoped, although ſhe is now turned three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore,
may live to grow older—and wiſer. The Editor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wiſhes <q rend="inline">"her pocket cat-o-nine tails"</q> to <hi>wound</hi> any but
the vicious and the ungrateful, and only to make the <hi>inſolent
tingle</hi> a little. The Editor has ſome letters, which ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
from ancient <hi>nobleſſe,</hi> male and female, for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
as well as their external merit. The aſſumed motto
of the excellent Counteſs of L<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The two following letters of the late George-Monck
Berkeley, Eſquire, were written at different periods; the
firſt, when he was juſt about to return from his <hi>laſt</hi> viſt to
Scotland in the end of the autumn of 1789, not then, alas!
thinking it was his laſt viſit; for he frequently uſed to ſay,

<pb n="dxxxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:551"/>
then, once in three or four years, in ſummer vacation,
make a viſit to Scotland for a few weeks."</q> Although an
enthuſiaſtic admirer of Johnſon in his writings, all on the
ſide of virtue, his integrity, &amp;c. he uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
like a ſavage in Scotland, where every reſpectful
attention was ſhewn to him by every one."</q> Mr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
conſtantly ſtyled Dr. Johnſon the <hi>noble learned</hi> BEAR.
His own abhorrence of what is called rudeneſs, even when
perſons are ever ſo much inflamed by reſentment, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
very early in life from his Mother, who added to

blows as ſhe never ſaw before, and hopes never to ſee

for a very liberal expenſive education, rendered the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
to obey and delight her a <hi>pleaſant</hi> taſk.</p>
               <p>As a ſiſter, Mrs. Berkeley owned much, for the <hi>tendereſt</hi>
love; and never had, when a girl, the leaſt idea of acting in
character of <hi>eldeſt</hi> ſiſter, which ſhe ever reprobated.—The idea
of brothers and ſiſters being ANGRY at an imprudent match
is to her wonderful; they may be grieved. Had the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's
ſiſter, who <hi>early</hi> in life reſolved never to marry any man,
as ſhe told a friend ſome little time ago, choſen to unite
hereſelf with a chimney-ſweeper; the Editor would have
kept up friendſhip with her ſiſter, and civility with the
<hi>quondam</hi> SWEEP. The Editor conceives that the authority
of PARENTS is not meant by God to extend to <hi>children</hi> of
twenty-five, thirty, or <hi>forty</hi> years old.</p>
               <p>As a friend, the Editor is certain ſhe was faithful and
ſecret; ſhe conſtantly laboured to be agreeable; and ſhe
truſts ſhe was obliging and complying. It is a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that almoſt quite entire ſtrangers to the Editor
have requeſted to depoſite important ſecrets to her keeping.
She never could conceive the reaſon. She indeed has been
told, by more than one phyſiognomiſt, that the lines of
honeſty are ſtrongly marked in her countenance. She never
wiſhed to know a ſecret, leſt, as ſhe uſed jokingly to ſay, ſhe
<pb n="dlii" facs="tcp:0761700600:566"/>
ſhould reveal it in her ſleep; ſhe was well aſſured ſhe

               <p>As a miſtreſs, which ſhe became very early in life,
ſhe endeavoured uniformly to treat every, even the
meaneſt ſervant in her houſe, ſo as, were ſhe and they to
exchange ſituations the next day, ſhe would wiſh them to
treat her; which once occaſioned a very faucy, very wicked
vile houſekeeper's ſaying to her, <q rend="inline">"You may be loved for

                        <p>A few years ago, a groom of a very old acquaintance of the Editor, was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to death for a highway robbery. His maſter being at the Aſſizes, the poor wretch turned to him and cried out, <q rend="inline">"Oh!

As a neighbour, Mrs. Berkeley rejoiced always to render
any little kind ſervices in the power of ſo unimportant a
perſon in the ſcale of beings as herſelf to do. She had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a ſort of <hi>giving</hi> ſpirit. Dr. Berkeley's very large gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
at Cookham, excellently planted and cultivated, enabled
the Editor to oblige her neighbours, high and low. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
her dairy or her larder were a convenience to her
neighbours. Had ſhe had a park, fiſh-ponds, or a pidgeon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
ſhe could have done more.</p>
               <p>An high Authority ſays, <q rend="inline">"To whom little is given,

At length, after every one had ſaid their ſay, Mr. Monck Berkeley, looking very ſeriouſly, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Poor young man, I pity him: I have always, from a boy, prayed earneſtly to GOD, that he would never beſtow more money upon me than he would give me ſenſe and grace enough to ſpend as I ought to do."</q> On which his mother, <hi>wickedly,</hi> exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Oh! my dear child, ſo then you have, I find, been praying for POVERTY all your life."</q> To which he replied, <q rend="inline">"My dear mother, be that as it may, I always have done it, and I always ſhall continue to do it."</q>

Draper of Sunninghill Park, grandmother of the late
amiable pious T. Baber, Eſquire. Old Sir Thomas and
Lady Draper were neighbours and intimate friends of the
Editor's grandfather, the very worthy John Finch, Eſquire,
of Fienes Court, in whoſe clothes King Charles eſcaped
with Lady Jane Lane. They met often; and Lady Draper, not
a <hi>modern</hi> fine lady, but one of Solomon's, looking <hi>well</hi> to the
ways of her houſehold<note n="†" place="bottom">See Proverbs ch. xxxi. ver. 27.</note>, finding ſometimes occaſion for a

lived at Court, and ſeen good, quiet, mild Queen Mary
milling the old Dutchman's chocolate on her knees until
her face perſpired, ſo as to need wiping. This, the Editor
can aſſert, is a fact, it having been repeatedly told to her

the Divine Goodneſs to proſper her labours in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

She applied to one conſiderable gentleman, whom, ſhe

This gentleman, exceedingly intimate with the Premier

               <p>The Editor cannot here forbear relating a curious anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
of this excellent gentleman. Very many years ago,
when we were at war with Spain, and ſome conſiderable
town was taken, the Churches were deſpoiled of their fine
pictures; four or ſix very large exquiſitely fine ones were
purchaſed by a Captain of a man of war, lying near the
city, and at his return to England preſented to Admiral
Haddock, who had a good collection at Wrotham-Place,
the Admiral's ſeat: they remained in the drawing-room
many long years, the admiration of all whoſe eye can be
delighted by fine paintings.</p>

wrote over to the Church in Spain, whence the fine pictures
had been pillaged when the town was ſacked, deſiring to be
informed by what method he might reſtore them to the
temple whence they had been torne. The righteous offer
<pb n="dlxiv" facs="tcp:0761700600:578"/>
was gratefully accepted; and Mr. Haddock has, to his real
unaffected piety, the delight of thinking, that, inſtead, of
<hi>robbing</hi> God, he has reſtored what even his anceſtors did
not wreſt from the temple of God. Oh, that all who have
robbed GOD in Tithes<note n="*" place="bottom">It is wiſhed that there was a new edition of Sir Henry Spelman's Hiſtory of Sacrilege; which the Editor ſtudied hard at ſixteen years old, and ſo incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated its doctrine on her Son, that nothing would have induced him to have any thing to do with them.</note> would make reſtitution!

Mrs. Berkeley was of too little importance in the world, to
benefit any one much: however, finding that although ſhe

pounds, until ſhe had proved Dr. Berkeley's will, ſhe
could not poſſibly get any into the hands of the worthy ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berkeley revered thoſe who, in his youth, <hi>laboured

               <p>The very grateful agreeable Mr. Taſwell, Rector of

Dr. Berkeley was wonderfully diverted with his <hi>ſon's idea,</hi>

worthy ſenſible men. Alas for ſweet Mrs. Iſham and a

of a father on one ſide, and the covetouſneſs of an

The gentleman died of a <hi>broken heart</hi> very ſoon; the lady
ſurvived about forty years, reſolved never to marry. The

by the Editor without filling her eyes with tears, after

               <p>Sir Juſ.—<q rend="inline">"To town, girls! What ſhould you go to

               <p>The wit of the young lady prevailed, one cannot ſay

lovely daughter to perpetual celibacy, he bequeathed her a

               <p>There are four Iriſh gentlemen, every one men of large
fortune and appointments, whoſe <hi>only</hi> home, for very many
years' reſidence at Eton and Harrow School, (for the three
months holydays of every year,) was the houſe of their
relation, Dr. Berkeley.</p>
               <p>To the Etonian, a gentleman of many thouſand pounds
a year, for ages in the family, his ſweetly amiable father
conſtantly took care to <hi>make</hi> Dr. Berkeley's Iriſh debtors
pay with tolerable punctuality. If they did not, by the
<pb n="dlxxxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:601"/>
generoſity of his excellent, kind relation Mr. Monck of
Grange Gormond, father of the Marchioneſs of Waterford,
it was pretty much the ſame to Dr. Berkeley; Mr. Monck
ſaying to his amiable brother, <q rend="inline">"Whether Dr. Berkeley's
people pay or not, remit his money regularly on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
they will pay ſome time or other."</q> Such
favours can never be obliterated from a grateful
mind. The three others had <hi>no</hi> ſuch claim, nor any
claim—and on their arrival at Harrow School in the
year 1766, their uncle ſaid they were to remain ſeven
years, the year round, holydays and all, as ſchool-boys.
The Editor felt for them, and beſought Dr. Berkeley to let
them come to him. He replied, <q rend="inline">"I will not have YOU
tormented with all the BRATS of my Iriſh relations,
turning yourſelf into a <hi>boarding dame.</hi>"</q> Mrs. Berkeley
conjured Dr. Berkeley to ſend the coach to fetch them for
three or four days, that ſhe might ſee what ſort of geniuſes
they were, and, if they were well behaved, a little mutton,
&amp;c. would not be much expence in a family of thirteen or
fourteen perſons. Accordingly ſhe prevailed—as women
generally do, with wiſe men, if their aim is worthy, and
they ſet <hi>rightly</hi> about it<note n="*" place="bottom">Soon after Dr. Berkeley's marriage, a younger brother of Dr. Joſhua Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, now Dean of Tuam (whoſe only <hi>Engliſh</hi> home, during his ſtay at Weſtminſter ſchool, and long after, at Chriſt Church, Oxon, was Dr. Berkeley's houſe), came with his worthy eldeſt brother, and his youngeſt, to viſit Dr. Berkeley at Bray. The youth, for whom Dr. Berkeley had procured a ſtudentſhip of Chriſt Church, fell ill of the ſmall-pox; and Dr. Berkeley's mother, then at his houſe, thought it <hi>better</hi> that the Editor, who had never had the ſmall-pox, ſhould leave the houſe, rather than Maſter William Berkeley, although Mr. Falwaſſer the Apothecary aſſured her there was not the leaſt danger attended the removing the youth. It very nearly coſt the Editor her life; ſhe loſt her infant; and the taking a ready-furniſhed houſe to reſide in for three months, ſcouring, <hi>ſpoiling</hi> beds, curtains, &amp;c. leſt the Editor ſhould get the ſmall-pox (that, in her family, <hi>direful</hi> diſeaſe) coſt Dr. Berkeley an hundred pounds.

Mrs. Berkeley feels herſelf indebted to the goodneſs of
Charles-Berkeley Kippax, Eſquire, great-nephew of Biſhop
Berkeley, whom the Editor never ſaw until about three years
before the death of Dr. Berkeley, and whom ſhe, with all her

The Editor <hi>then</hi> thought it <hi>very clever;</hi> ſo it

               <p>Mrs. Berkeley here takes leave to recommend to thoſe
Friends to whom ſhe may not yet have recommended them,
as ſhe knows ſhe has to many, to purchaſe, and read,
<hi>every</hi> day, two little books—BOGATSKY. When recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
that excellent little volume (the York edition is

LORDS of the Creation."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond book is the "Hymns," not "Pſalms," of

his fine faculties (too much uſed) failed, and villains got in

To tell you that we have no organ at Chertſey, would

Divine Service twice on Sunday, as alſo on week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
and the following Sunday. Having been taught, from
early youth, always to follow, never precede the Clerk in
the Confeſſion, Pſalms, and Reſponſes, I was exceedingly
puzzled indeed when I came to the Litany. I rubbed my
eyes, wiped my glaſſes, but all in vain, to find out what
the poor honeſt Clerk ſaid, as the words WE and FOR are
<hi>ſo very</hi> different in their ſound, and, thanks be to God,
my ears are as quick as my poor eyes are dull—very
remarkably quick always; that it was not, till ſeveral
times after giving the utmoſt attention, that I diſcovered
that this good man, probably conceiving that HIS prayers,
as Clerk, being louder than the reſt of the Congregation,
are <hi>better</hi> heard in Heaven, he very kindly, in the Litany,
inſtead of ſaying, <q rend="inline">"<hi>We beſeech Thee to hear us, good Lord,</hi>"</q>
ſays, FOR I beſeech Thee to hear US, good Lord. Moſt of
the great Churches in town have what is called a Clerk in
Orders; I believe they ſeldom officiate themſelves, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
by deputy; but if they do, although in Prieſts
<pb n="dxcviii" facs="tcp:0761700600:612"/>
Orders, I fancy they do not ſupplicate for the Congregation
as this <hi>zealous</hi> Clerk does. There are ſeveral other curious
<hi>varieties,</hi> but this may ſuffice to ſhew how <hi>happy</hi> we are
in a Clerk. Pews are here exceedingly ſcarce; and the
good Lady who <hi>rented</hi> this houſe before I took it, when
ſhe quitted the town, bequeathed her <hi>non</hi>-right in the
pew in which ſhe ſat to a <hi>little valiant Sea-officer,</hi> not now
in employ. He, perhaps, conſidering himſelf as at ſea,
crowded himſelf and three couſins in with Mrs Frinſham
and myſelf (the pew is ſmall for four perſons); bluſtered ſo
violently, and ſwore in Church, and at length prevailed,
by his eloquence <hi>or</hi> his oaths, on the <hi>reſpectable</hi> Veſtry
(after all the gentlemen were retired), to write me a very
curious letter indeed (it is carefully preſerved by Mrs.
Frinſham amongſt her <hi>odd</hi> curioſities), forbidding me to ſit
in the ſeat any more, <hi>they</hi> having given it to Captain BLUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER,
and his uncle the Coal-dealer, who are much <hi>too
genteel</hi> ever to go to Church in an afternoon, or on week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days.
I was beginning to fear we muſt attend Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
as uſed to do the excellent Mrs. Yorke of Pirton, my
mother's aunt, who, for ſome years before her death, being
a cripple by the gout, was conſtantly lifted in and out of
her coach to take the air, or make a viſit, but could not
drive into the Church; ſhe was therefore regularly carried
to Church twice every Sunday, and every Saint's day,
Wedneſdays, and Fridays, in her ſedan-chair, placed in the
aile, and the poles drawn out, not to incommode perſons
<pb n="dxcix" facs="tcp:0761700600:613"/>
paſſing to their pews; but, having at preſent no ſedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chair,
it occurred to me, that, unleſs the amiable Prelate
of this Dioceſe was wonderfully altered for the worſe in a
few years, he would be happy to aſſiſt an old friend. I
accordingly wrote to him, ſtating our hard caſe. His
Lordſhip honoured me with a very polite anſwer, incloſing
one to the Churchwardens of Chertſey, recommending it
to them to provide me with a pew; which they immediately
did, near the little Captain's, where we hear him talk, but
not <hi>now</hi> ſwear and curſe.—So much fore ccleſiaſtical matters;
only remarking, that the title beſtowed on the Curate of
Chertſey, as Mr. White told us, is the <hi>Journeyman</hi> Parſon.
I have often heard my Mother and Archdeacon Dodwell's
mother ſay, that the Clerk of Shotteſbrook, a maſter ſhoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,
uſed to roar out, in the Pſalm, I am a <hi>journeyman,</hi>
as all my Fathers were; and Mr. Cherry's comment was,
<q rend="inline">"Frith always ſtruts when he hollows it out, feeling his <hi>own</hi>
ſuperiority over David, who, he conceives, never attained
to being a <hi>maſter</hi> workman."</q> We never hear an oath, or
ſee, or hear, a drunken perſon, man or woman, in the
ſtreet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Whitaker told Mrs. Frinſham and Mrs. Berkeley,
that the reformation in the manners of the <hi>lower</hi> claſs of
people in this place, within theſe laſt eight years, ſince Mr.
White was curate of the place, is quite aſtoniſhing to all
the neighbourhood. The higher and middling ranks of
<pb n="dc" facs="tcp:0761700600:614"/>

               <p>Perhaps a few weeks ſpent at Dover by the great

them, that it would be better to walk next the kennel,
and <q rend="inline">"leave the wall to elder perſons;"</q> as the very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

charity-ſchool girl, ſhe ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I will wait upon you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,

my kind thanks. We ſet out;—ſhe turned back to the
little girls that ſhe had quitted, ſlipped off her pattens,
ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Pray take care of them; I ſhall walk quicker
without them, and not hinder the Lady."</q> It was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for the Lady, who ever delighted to pay attention to
real humble merit in humble ſtation, and try to benefit
the poſſeſſors, to avoid rewarding her little conductreſs,
and enquiring who ſhe was. She did not reply, as waſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women's,
&amp;c. children in theſe equalizing days generally
do, <q rend="inline">"I am <hi>Mrs. Draggletail's</hi> daughter."</q> She replied,

widow, and keeps a publick houſe;"</q> I think, the Flying
Horſe. This being the laſt time I was at Dover, I have
not learned, but hope, that the ſenſible, civil little Suſan
is now a worthy ſervant in the family of ſome gentleman
who has a worthy lady, who takes a <hi>little</hi> care of the ſouls

The Editor fears that moſt of the errors of the preſs muſt go

Mrs. Berkeley, however, ſtayed, and purchaſed her flax, as

                  <p>Away flew Mr. Berkeley, with his wonted alacrity to
ſerve a friend, or a ſtrange, or even a foe, if he thought
them worthy; and returned, eſcorting his tenderly beloved,
his ſincerely reſpected friend, the late amiable Lord Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
whoſe delight in Mr. Berkeley's ſweet ſociety, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the diſparity of their years, was wonderful.</p>
                  <p>Some of Mr. Berkeley's friends in Edinburgh uſed
laughingly to tell him, <q rend="inline">"that, although <hi>he</hi> might never be a

Berkeley's knee, if he can take me up, or elſe to ſtand
by him."</q> Her Ladyſhip was not ſingular; all children,
quite ſtrangers, conſtantly made up to Mr. Berkeley, his
father, and his grandmother Mrs. Frinſham; and little
ones in arms, the Editor has frequently ſeen ſtruggle, and
even cry, to go to Dr. Berkeley and to her Mother. But
one child in the world ever paid the Editor that compliment,
excepting her own babes. Mrs. Berkeley does not love
little children. She ſhould eſteem her <hi>nature</hi> more if ſhe
did. She <hi>pities</hi> the poor little pewling diſagreeable animals.
A kitten can divert one; but the <hi>untaught</hi> offspring of the
Lord of the creation cannot. So much for the DIGNITY
of FALLEN Human Nature!</p>
                  <p>An odd accident happened not long after Mr. Monck
Berkeley's return to England. The very amiable Mr.
Gipps, M.P. for Canterbury, ever ready to oblige and
ſerve his friends, permitted Mr. Monck Berkeley to have
his letters from his Scottiſh friends addreſſed under cover
to him.</p>
                  <p>One day, when the Editor was dreſſing for dinner, ſhe
heard a viſiting-rap with the utmoſt <hi>ſang-froide,</hi> very certain
that Mr. Wrightſon would not let any one into her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>in the morning.</hi> Preſently open flew the dreſſing-room
door; and in flew Mrs. Gipps, out of breath, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"I
beg your pardon for <hi>forcing</hi> my way in to you; but I hear
<pb n="dcxvii" facs="tcp:0761700600:631"/>
that Mr. Berkeley, with whom is <hi>my</hi> buſineſs, is gone to
dinner in the country, ſo I muſt entreat you to make my
apology to him. When I went up to dreſs, I ſaw a letter
lie on my table, the ſeal upwards. Never minding that it
was a coronet, I <hi>ſcratched</hi> it open. The folding of it hid
the words, 'My dear friend,' and 'Edinburgh,' and the
date. I began, and redde about half way down the firſt
ſide. When I came to theſe words, 'I am moſt happy
that I have it in my power to gratify myſelf by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
complying with your requeſt; and I can with
truth ſay, that, were all my Chaplainſhips now vacant,
my dear friend Mr. Berkeley"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Here,"</q> added my
very ſenſible, very obliging neighbour, <q rend="inline">"I ſtood aghaſt,
turned the letter, and ſaw on the back, 'To George-Monck

Mr. Berkeley <hi>muſt</hi> think of me."</q> The Editor here an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
for her Son, that the only ſenſation it would occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to him, would be that it had cauſed a moment's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
to Mrs. Gipps, who proceeded to aſſure Mrs. Berkeley,
<q rend="inline">"that ſhe had not redde a tittle after ſhe came to the name
Berkeley;"</q> of which Mrs. Berkeley was fully convinced.
Whilſt Mrs. Gipps was accuſing herſelf of being a great
fool; which no one elſe could ever do, ſhe being bleſſed
with an exceeding ſtrong underſtanding, which deſcends to
her two fine little boys, bleſſed, the Editor believes, with
the beſt mother-in-law in the three kingdoms; Mrs.

Berkeley prevailed on her good neighbour to ſtay and pin
on her gown; which, having begun to undreſs, was literally
only faſtened by one pin, ſuch was her haſte to exculpate
herſelf from what very few would have ſuſpected her of.
It afforded a pleaſant laugh at the next Canterbury rout.</p>
                  <p>The diſtreſſing letter was locked up, unredde, until Mr.
Monck Berkeley's return at night, when he proceeded to
read—after <q rend="inline">"were all my chaplainſhips now vacant—my

he pleaſed."</q> There followed ſome polite obliging enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums

wear it, as many SPRIGS<note n="*" place="bottom">Boys of twenty-two and a half are <hi>generally</hi> by the Editor ſtyled SPRIGS. She has no diſlike to any other Sprigs; <hi>tout au contraire,</hi> ſhe is perſuaded that ſhe ſhould not have remembered ſo accurately as ſhe now does the face, figure, and dreſs of her Aunt Mrs. Cherry, who died many months before the Editor attained her <hi>fourth</hi> year, but that one day, in the garden at Mr. Frinſham's, the Editor, not <hi>daring</hi> to touch them herſelf, requeſted her Aunt to gather her a <hi>le if</hi> from one of the orange-trees. Mrs. Cherry amiably took out her knife, cut off a good large ſprig with an orange as large as a ſmall wallnut and ſeveral bloſſoms on it; then took a cauking-pin out of her pincuſhion, and pinned it on her frock on the left ſide. The Editor ſtill feels the pleaſure her poor little ſimple heart felt; no elegant finery ſince has <hi>ſo</hi> delighted it as when the <hi>orange-ſpring</hi> was placed near it.

Mr. Monck Berkeley flew into the room, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Oh! my dear Madam! if you <hi>will not give,</hi> or <hi>lend me</hi> THREE ſhillings, I ſhall break my heart.

Her ear for muſic was ſo exquiſitely accurate, that the Editor has frequently, in her youth, and a very little before her lamented death, heard her ſay, that, when at ſchool, (always in miſchief,) like, and perpetually with, her dearly beloved friend, the wonderfully ſenſible, highly cultivated, accompliſhed Mrs. A. Langley, of the Manor-houſe, York, ſhe has repeatedly <hi>tried</hi> to dance out of time, but never could do it more than two ſteps, the third was not in her power.

Schools well conducted are excellent places for children of both ſexes ſurely. Mrs. Frinſham uſed through life to laugh, and tell Dr. and Mr. Monck Berkeley, when the Editor uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"that <hi>as a girl ſhe</hi> found no pleaſure in <hi>their eſcampades</hi> to the parlour door at night,"</q> &amp;c. <q rend="inline">"Aye, ſhe was a <hi>poor, puſillanimous, ſtupid, little puſs.</hi> She would never get up after ſhe was in bed, never ſlip out of the ſchool-room.

variety of perplexing buſineſſes, without one near, dear
relative to counſel and to ſoothe her; yet, bleſſed be the
mercy of an all-gracious God, ſhe was enabled to ſay to her
almoſt idolizing Siſter, <q rend="inline">"Deareſt of friends, I am not

been conſtantly, as you know, praying to him from the

has graciouſly promiſed ALL his <hi>real</hi> children, '<hi>I</hi> will
NEVER leave thee, nor <hi>forſake</hi> thee.' And I may adapt
the language of Holy David, and inſtead of ſaying,
'When my Father and my Mother forſake me, the
LORD taketh me up.' But, when it pleaſes HIS wiſdom
to chaſtize his poor ſinful child, by taking from her her
idolized Son, her tenderly beloved Huſband, her darling
Siſter; HE <hi>will</hi> take her up, and conduct her ſafely,

Fool of Quality, that <q rend="inline">"GRIEF hath not a more <hi>deadly</hi> FOE
than <hi>buſineſs;</hi> that ſhe, alas! had much, to which ſhe
entreated her to apply herſelf inſtead of mourning over
her loſs."</q> We all, in turn, feel that it is eaſier to preach
than to practiſe; and the Editor feels the force of Our
Bleſſed Maſter's words, <q rend="inline">"Work whilſt you have the day,
for the night cometh wherein no man can work."</q> The
Editor has laboured to work a little in the day, the time of
youth, of vigour; for the night is come (rather early) upon
her, when ſhe finds, by melancholy experience, that ſhe
can do but <hi>very</hi> little—May that little all redound to the
glory of GOD <hi>her</hi> SAVIOUR, <hi>Amen.</hi> Lord JESUS! ſay

very early youth one of her chief ſtudies and greateſt delights
was labouring to oblige, pleaſe, and render happy, her
ever from <hi>infancy</hi> tenderly beloved ſiſter; and that the

            <head type="sub">TO THE REVEREND WILLIAM PETERS, LL.B.<note n="*" place="bottom">A panegyric in proſe from a <hi>feeble</hi> pen on the
<hi>wonderful powers</hi> of Mr. Peter's <hi>pencil</hi> would be a vain
attempt. Perhaps it may be equally vain to attempt doing juſtice to the
exquiſite amiability of that worthy gentleman's heart, and the very refined
elegance of his manners. He was moſt ſincerely beloved, and reſpected, by
Mr. Monke Berkeley, who, in a letter introducing Mr. P. to his father, Dr. B.
ſays, Pope has given his <hi>true</hi> character in few words:
<q rend="inline">"The nobleſt work of God."</q> Mr. P. painted a picture of
his friend, which was by Mr. B. preſented to his mother. It is, by ſome of
the beſt judges of painting, ſuppoſed to be the fineſt portrait ever
produced by any pencil, ancient or modern. It preſerves that wonderful depth
of thought, and that exquiſite benevolence which ſo ſtrongly animated the
countenance of Mr. M. B. The letter to Mrs. B. which accompanied the picture,
proves that Mr. Peters wields his pen almoſt as ably as he does his
pencil.</note>

            <head>THE RAPE OF THE WIG.</head>
            <head type="sub">WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1782.</head>
            <p>IT is neceſſary to prefix this ſhort account to the following <hi>jeu
d'eſprit</hi> of Mr. B. then about eighteen. Some of the ſtudents
uſed to ſay, that if Newbourn would wear a better wig his lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
would make a deeper impreſſion on them, and talked of
burning the vile caxon. One day the young gentleman ſince
known at Bath by the name of Count E<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>, an early friend of
Mr. B's at Eton ſchool, viſiting an Engliſh gentleman who
boarded at Mr. Cook's, ſnatched it off the peg in the <hi>trance,</hi> i.e.
the hall, where it hung; when he got into the ſtreet, he told
his friend that he had got it, and was taking it home to burn it.
Mr. B. who ever from a youth hated <hi>miſchievous</hi> miſchief,
much as he <hi>ever</hi> loved innocent miſchief, replied, <q rend="inline">"Oh! no;
do not burn it."</q>—<q rend="inline">"What can I do then?"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Why let your
ſervant, or mine, who will, do it.—Better dreſs it nicely, fill it
with powder and pomatum, and give it a new ribband."</q> It
was a tail wig. This was agreed on. Some of the gentlemen
ſuggeſted, that in the box in which it was returned, an apology
for the <hi>theft</hi> ought to be made; and Mr. B. being ever a ready
pen-man, was told he muſt write the card. He took up his pen
with his uſual alertneſs, and wrote the following lines. It was
ſome weeks before the Author was known in the Univerſity.</p>

IT is hoped, that the excellent Writer of the following
<hi>Jeu d'Eſprit</hi> will pardon his old, his throughly grateful
Friend for publiſhing it without his knowledge or conſent.
That it is the firſt offence of the kind, cannot be pleaded
in excuſe. The former offence was pardoned; the work
was of a very different kind, an excellent little tract for the
children of the Sunday Schools near his own eſtate. There
being no title-page, the Writer of this introduction prefixed
one, <q rend="inline">"Written by Henry Grimſton, Eſquire;"</q> of whom it
may, with ſtricteſt truth, be aſſerted, that he is<q>
                     <l>"Of manners gentle, of affections mild,</l>
                     <l>"In wit a man, ſimplicity a child."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To attempt an elaborate character of Mr. Grimſton,
would be too weighty a taſk; it may be learned from every
diſtreſſed man, woman, or child, in his own neighbourhood

to have lived in the ſtricteſt friendſhip with Mr.
Grimſton for the laſt fifteen years, often, for many months
together, under the ſame roof; and never obſerved, or
even heard, that he had the ſhadow of any vice; but firmly
believes that he is bleſſed with every virtue. He was the
choſen, the beloved, the reſpected, the boſom friend of the
amiable hearted George-Monck Berkeley, Eſquire. His <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
attentions</hi> to Mr. Berkeley, during the two laſt years
of his painful journey through this vale of miſery to the realms
of bliſs, prove the ſoundneſs of Mr. Berkeley's judgement,
when, at the age of about twenty, he ſaid to his Mother,
<q rend="inline">"I have, I thank God, many friends that I <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>ſome</hi>
that I <hi>reſpect,</hi> but the man I fix on for my faſt friend through
life is Grimſton."</q> Mr. Grimſton is the grandſon, and in
ſome ſort the <hi>eleve</hi> of (as his lovely mother died, to<q>"give him orphan'd in his birth,"</q>
as ſpeaks the eloquent Dr. Young in the Night Thoughts)
the excellently wiſe and throughly pious Lady Le Gard,
mother of the late Sir Digby Le Gard.</p>

            <head>ON THE DEATH OF MASTER GEORGE-ROBERT BERKELEY, SECOND SON OF THE REV. DR.
BERKELEY, PREBENDARY OF CANTERBURY<note n="*" place="bottom">Who died April
15, 1775, aged eight years, four months, and four days, after only one week's
illneſs, of a dreadful putrid fever, then raging in Canterbury; as did one of
his beloved ſchool-fellows, that lovely child, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Tatton, only ſon
of the Reverend Dr. Tatton, Prebendary of Canterbury, and grandſon of the
charitable, bountiful Dean Lynch. No art could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this ſweet child from
calling three or four times in the day to know how his friend did. Maſter
Robert Berkeley ſickened on one Saturday, and died the next. Maſter Tatton
was going to take a ride, it being holyday. When got as far as Burghgate, the
<hi>diſmal</hi> ſound of the <hi>great</hi> bell aſſailed his ear; he
dropped his bridle, and ſaid to the ſervant attending him,
<q rend="inline">"Ah! <hi>my dear</hi> Robert is dead, and my ride is
ſpoiled."</q> He turned his horſe, went home, fickened that very evening,
and died the next Saturday. Theſe little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were lovely and
pleaſant in their lives, and in their deaths were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. The elegant
<hi>application</hi> of this text is borrowed from a moſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing letter of
the highly cultivated Mrs. Cox, of St. Giles, Oxford, to Mrs. George Berkeley,
thanking her for Dr. Berkeley's long-ſmothered ſermon, preached at Lambeth
Palace, at the conſecration of his beloved old friend, the angelic Biſhop
Horne; (ſee p. 159.) Dr. Berkeley did not long ſurvive his beloved Friend.

one day to his Mother, the ſubject led him to enquire, what was the
difference between a Cherub and a Seraph? He was told, that it was ſuppoſed
by Divines, that Seraphs loved God moſt, but that Cherubs knew more of God
and of his adorable nature. He pauſed near a minute, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be in
deep thought: then looking on his Mother, he ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Mamma, pray liſten to me: I do deſire to be a
Seraph, that I may love God a great deal, rather than be a Cherub, and have a
vaſt deal of knowledge."</q> This was remarkable, as he had a very uncommon
thirſt for knowledge. The above choice was made juſt a month before his
death, when in good health, in high gay ſpirits, being juſt come in from
playing with ſome of his ſchool-fellows.</note>!</l>

                     <p>When he was but ſeven years old, reading that part of the Goſpel, where our bleſſed Saviour ſays, <q rend="inline">"How hardly ſhall they that are rich enter into the kingdom of Heaven!"</q> he ſtarted, dropped the Bible on the table, and ſaid: <q rend="inline">"What, can NO rich people go to Heaven?"</q> Being deſired to proceed, and ſee what would follow, he redde, <q rend="inline">"It is eaſier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven."</q> He added, <q rend="inline">"Then, I am ſure, it is impoſſible."</q> On be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told, that Chriſt ſays, how hard it is for thoſe, who truſt in riches, to enter into the kingdom of Heaven; and that riches are apt to draw off the heart from God, although that is not always the caſe; he laid down his book, conſidered ſome time in ſilence, then addreſſed his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as before, <q rend="inline">"Mamma, Mamma, pray liſten to me!"</q> and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I do deſire to be poor, and to go to Chriſt, rather than to be very rich, and live without him."</q> He naturally loved money exceedingly, and never parted with it willingly, but to the poor. He would frequently borrow of the ſervants to relieve them, if his allowance was all ſpent. His Father and Aunt uſed to amuſe themſelves with borrowing ſix pence of him, and then pretending they could not pay it, that they might witneſs his <hi>extreme</hi> anxiety not to loſe it. He would ſay, <q rend="inline">"Why, Mamma <hi>tells me,</hi> that <hi>no</hi> honeſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>ever</hi> borrow money without paying it again as ſoon <hi>as poſſible;</hi> and that it is <hi>very wicked to run in debt.</hi>"</q> He would then repair to his Mother, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his hard fate, and aſk if he could not <hi>make</hi> them pay him. What a contraſt to his generous Brother! Yet both were delightfully amiable children in their different ways. It is ſuppoſed, that Biſhop Berkeley was <hi>naturally</hi> a lover of money. An Iriſh nobleman, an intimate friend of the Biſhop's, often mentioned to the Editor, that, on his <hi>urging</hi> Biſhop Berkeley to accept the primacy offered to him by Lord Cheſterfield, the Biſhop replied, <q rend="inline">"No, my dear Lord, I very early in life got the love of money here," (lifting up his leg, and ſetting it down with ſuch force, that it ſhook his library, and every thing in it;) "and here, by the grace of God, I will <hi>always</hi> keep it."</q> This was uttered in the moſt energetic tone of voice. A younger brother of Dr. Berkeley's, who died at about ſeventeen, had the ſame ſpirit as his little nephew. The Biſhop early gave his ſons a large allowance for cloaths, &amp;c. A collection was making for a diſtreſſed Baronet. The Biſhop called on his ſons to contribute. Dr. Berkeley flew to his room, and brought down twenty guineas. The Biſhop ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Willy, where is yours?"</q>

hardly to be deſcribed. He has been often overheard by the ſervants of the

will. If you go to fight againſt the French, <hi>I will</hi> go too: if you
are ſhot, I will be ſhot the very next minute."</q> His Brother, until near
ſeventeen, was languiſhing to go into the army, as moſt idle geniuſes
are; the wiſdom of his Father kept him out, rejecting the kind offer of a
cornetcy in the Oxford Blues, made to him by his amiable Friend the late Lord
Conyngham, who having obtained it for a near relation of his Lady, the youth
altered his mind—when dear Lord Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyngham offered it to Dr. Berkeley,
whoſe brave Uncle, Major Burton, had married an Aunt of Dr. Berkeley's. This
connexion, and the <hi>very</hi> near neighbourhood of this amiable family,
added much to Mr. Berkeley's and his parents pleaſure from his childhood
until Dr. Berkeley quitted Cookham to attend his Son to the Univerſity of St.
Andrew's. When he was not ſix years old, his brother was exceedingly ill, and
refuſing to take a medicine, this lovely child came to him, and in an agony
of ſoul, <hi>not to be deſcribed,</hi> urged him to take it, ſaying,

Mary Farrant, wife of Mr. Farrant, butcher and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, at Town-Malling, Kent,
who idolized him, and never complained of him to his Mother but once during his
whole life—when it was moſt highly neceſſary to do it. Mrs.
Farrant, a neighbour's daughter, lived from her early youth many years in Dr.
Berkeley's family. She is one of the beſt tempered of women. Her little
charge, when very young, one night took it into his head that he would ſing
two or three lines of a little ſong upon every ſtep as he aſcended the
ſtair-caſe. Mrs. Berkeley, happening to paſs, ſtood ſtill to
liſten, and overheard the amiable ſervant ſay,
<q rend="inline">"Come, Sir, come you muſt go up quicker, or I muſt call my
Miſtreſs."</q> To which he replied,
<q rend="inline">"No, no, my dear Molly, I know very well you won't <hi>do

ſkipped off to his room in an inſtant, and his Mother ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"Molly, how many fibs you do tell that child! for you know
that you never told a tale of him in your life, nor would if he was to torment
you from morning till night."</q>—<q rend="inline">"No, to be ſure Madam, I ſhould not; for at laſt, by
threatening him with YOU, I get him to do what he ſhould do."</q> Mrs.
Berkeley, till within theſe very few years, made an annual grateful offering
to a worthy woman, who lived with her mother when SHE was ſix years old, for
not telling of her when ſhe climbed the trees like a boy.</note> who always
waited upon him,
<q rend="inline">"Molly teach me to pray."</q> She replied, with tears,
<q rend="inline">"My angel, God will teach you to pray."</q> He ſaid, with
great earneſtneſs,

that the prayer which <hi>reacheth</hi> to God muſt come <hi>from</hi> the
<hi>heart,</hi> and with the heart this lovely creature often did pray. He
always uſed Biſhop Kenn's prayers and hymns in The Wincheſter Scholar.
Whenever Mrs. Berkeley was alone, her children always offered their prayers,
and repeated or ſang their hymns with her. One evening, as he was repeating
the following verſe in Biſhop Kenn's evening hymn,
<q>
                        <l>But though ſleep o'er my frailty reigns,</l>

<q rend="inline">"Although it might ſuit the exalted piety of Biſhop Kenn,
it was in him (little <hi>Robert</hi>) mocking God, as ſhe did not believe he
had devotion ſufficient to wiſh to wake in the middle of the night to
praiſe God."</q> He ſtood about a minute ſilent, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; then
replied,
<q rend="inline">"Why, Mamma, I do deſire to awake to praiſe God in the
night; ſo, if you pleaſe to give me leave, I will ſay it as I always do
when I ſay it to Molly Phipps,"</q> the very worthy woman above named, who
doated on him, and he on her. His Mother rejoiced that her child ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled her
in piety, ſhe always omitting it herſelf. He was, perhaps, the moſt
ingenious and accompliſhed little creature any where to be ſeen. As his
bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was reſolved not to learn to read, ſo he ſeemed reſolved to
learn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being taught. He would conjure his mother not to tell him, and
clap his little hand over her mouth, leſt ſhe ſhould begin, or rather go
on ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but, as he termed it, let him <hi>gueſs it out</hi>
himſelf, how words were to be ſpelt or pronounced. At the age of four and
an half he redde as well as he could have done at fourteen. He could find out
in the Calendar the leſſons for the day, for Sundays, and holydays,
whilſt he remained in petticoats. On <hi>week</hi> days, he ſat with his
Mother in the ſeats appropriate to the Prebendaries' Ladies. The amiable
worthy lady of the late Dr. Caryl, both of whom doated on him, uſed to ſay,

<q rend="inline">"It is like the idea one has of praying in Heaven, to hear
this <hi>little</hi> Cherubring this great choir when he chaunts. I really
believe he underſtands better what he is about than half the <hi>grown-up
people</hi> that come hither."</q> Accident diſcovered to his mother the
ſtrength of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: her own was once pretty good, ſhe having often
heard her mother ſay, that ſhe learned the alphabet at once ſhewing; that
the next day ſhe knew every letter: but Robert much excelled his mother. Mrs.
Berkeley, being a pretty good <hi>Bible ſcholar,</hi> uſed to work with her
needle, as ſhe never put out any work of any ſort or kind, whilſt her
children were reading the Scriptures. In Hiſtory, Geography, &amp;c. that
would not do. One day, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving little Robert going on perfectly right, and
finding his eyes fixed at the other end of the room, ſhe enquired what he was
at, looking off his book? He replied,
<q rend="inline">"Why, Mamma, you know when one has redde any thing <hi>in</hi>
the book <hi>once,</hi> one can read it <hi>without</hi> the book afterwards;
and a little while ago I redde this chapter <hi>in</hi> the book in the
ſervants' hall Bible; ſo now I can <hi>read</hi> it <hi>without</hi> the
book to you to-day."</q> A boy, having cut off ſome of his fine curling
ringlets, which hung below the bottom of his back, he was very angry, and
ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"He would never forgive him."</q>—His Mother aſſured
him,
<q rend="inline">"He would go to hell if he did not."</q>—He then
replied,
<q rend="inline">"Then, I will forgive him; <hi>but I will never forget
it.</hi>"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Yes, you muſt, or God will not love you."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Well then, if God <hi>will have</hi> me forget it, he muſt
MAKE me do it, for I never did forget any thing I ever heard or ſaw in my
whole life."</q> When a little child, not being allowed ſciſſors for fear
of his beautiful eyes, he with his fingers pinched out in paper, birds,
beaſts, ſhips, flowers, &amp;c. ſo accurately as was aſtoniſhing; he
drew very finely; his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond leſſon, a cow's head, is preſerved as a
prodigy of genius. He danced delightfully, and could go through all the
military exerciſe of the infantry, Dr. Berkeley always paid a ſerjeant for
attending his Sons. He ſpoke French as fluently as he did Engliſh. He, as
well as his Brother, repeated by heart, and acted delightfully. He chaunted and
ſang finely. His beloved ſchool-fellows were, lovely little Tatton, the
preſent ſenſible, worthy, Samuel Saw-bridge, eſq. of Ollantigh, and the
learned Dr. Herbert Packe, ſon of the celebrated Dr. Packe, of Canterbury.
The Saturday on which he ſickened in the evening, he flew up at twelve
o'clock, to conjure his Mother, to give him permiſſion to invite
<q rend="inline">"my dear Sam to dinner to-day."</q> It was, alas! the laſt
dinner he ever ate; he ſickened about eight in the evening. Here follows a
proof of this gentleman's honeſty in very early youth. <hi>Some</hi> of the
Upper School Boys had a <hi>ſhameful</hi> trick of <hi>robbing</hi> the very
worthy Mrs. Longley, in the church-yard, of <hi>a dozen</hi> oranges when they
<hi>purchaſed half a dozen.</hi> It was neceſſary to have one little boy
as an aſſiſtant to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable action. Samuel Sawbridge was enticed;
to which he ſenſibly, nobly replied,
<q rend="inline">"What! take Mrs. Longley's oranges <hi>without paying</hi> for
them! Miſs Tucker teaches me my Catechiſm; and that ſays, "THOU SHALT NOT
STEAL;" and <hi>ſhe</hi> tells me, "that taking any thing from any body,
without paying for it, <hi>is ſtealing;</hi> ſo I won't go with you."</q>
This gentleman not then quite ſeven years old, all Canterbury rang with this
tale. Mrs. Berkeley aſked her little Robert if he thought he ſhould have
been as honeſt as his dear friend Samuel? To which he made the following
reply:
<q rend="inline">"God knows—God knows, my dear Mamma, if I had been
tempted, what <hi>I might</hi> have done; THANK God, THANK God, they did not
<hi>aſk</hi> me;"</q> and he ſhuddered as he energetically uttered the
reply. This lovely creature was, to be ſure, wonderfully ambitious. He
repeatedly, until told it was a wicked idea, aſked his mother,
<q rend="inline">"Mamma, if I was to read Greek and Latin all day and all
night, and ſtudy violently hard, could I come to be a King? I ſhould
<hi>like</hi> to be a King."</q> Such a thought never entered the head of his
dear brother, nor perhaps of any other child.</note>!"</l>

SEVERAL things of Mr. Berkeley's writing having been

all who hope to be happy here and hereafter; a ſtrong proof of which he gave
the laſt time of his being at Bath. He and his excellent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied friend,
Mr. Grimſton, lodged and boarded at Mr. Garret's.</p>
            <p>A <hi>bon mot</hi> of Mr. Whitaker's cannot here be omitted.
Dr. Berkeley, &amp;c. going one day to viſit Dr. Berkeley's
relation, the very worthy Colonel Butler, at Thorpe; on
their arrival, they found he had died three days before,
Mr. Whitaker rode up to the carriage, and enquiring how
Mr. Monck Berkeley did? and where he was? hearing
that he was at Bath, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I am going thither in two
days; where ſhall I find him?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Berkeley.—<q rend="inline">"At Mr. Garret's."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Whitaker.—<q rend="inline">"'Pſhaw! how could I be ſuch a block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
to aſk?—a POET is always in a GARRET."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Several gentlemen boarded, who could not lodge, at
Mr. Garret's. Amongſt theſe was the, at Bath, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Captain Lawley.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0761700600:824"/>
Soon after the arrival of Mr. Grimſton and Mr. Berkeley,
this wretched Captain began to <hi>inſtruct</hi> the two young men
in the <hi>pleaſing</hi> doctrine of there being <hi>no</hi> God, &amp;c. &amp;c.
that the idea of Hell and its Prince was all a bug-a-boo, to
keep ſilly <hi>women</hi> in a little order. Many arguments did
theſe two young Chriſtian men uſe with this wretched old
Atheiſt; but all, alas! in vain. One day he was miſſed
from dinner; the ſecond he appeared not. On an enquiry
being ſent to his lodgings, word was brought that he was
very ill. Mr. Grimſton and Mr. Berkeley went to call on
him, and found him, as his apothecary ſaid, very dangerouſly
ill indeed, with little hope of recovery. Both were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
ſhocked at his ſituation. Mr. Grimſton earneſtly
requeſted Mr. Berkeley to talk to him concerning his ſoul.</p>
            <p>Mr. Berkeley.—<q rend="inline">"Alas! no, my dear friend, he NOW
wants an abler counſellor than I am."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Grimſton.—<q rend="inline">"What can we do for him?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"We will go, and requeſt the favour of that
gentleman<note n="*" place="bottom">The Editor has forgotten the gentleman's name; but thinks that it was Mr. Jackſon, rector of St. Jame's church.</note>, whoſe preaching we both ſo much admire,
to go him, to talk to him, and pray with him."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0761700600:825"/>
They immediately went to Mr. Jackſon, who ſaid to
them, <q rend="inline">"Gentlemen, out of reſpect to you, as you ſeem
ſo earneſtly to wiſh it, <hi>I</hi> will go; but am conſident I ſhall
make no more impreſſion on him than on this marble
hearth on which I ſtand; for he is the moſt <hi>determined</hi>
Atheiſt, the <hi>greateſt</hi> ridiculer of every thing ſacred, that
is any where to be found."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The young gentlemen, however, continued very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous,
and the worthy Divine complied; ſo each party
<q rend="inline">"<hi>delivered their own ſoul:</hi>"</q> but, lamentable thought! the
wretched Captain Lawley reſolved to die as he had lived,
and meet Bug-a-boo, <q>"Unhouſel'd, unanneal'd, unanointed."</q>
            </p>
            <p>One day, when the two gentlemen were viſiting him
during his illneſs, he fixed his eyes earneſtly in ſilence on
Mr. Berkeley, and at length ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Mr. Berkeley, I ſhould
be very glad of a pair of your old ſhoes, Sir."</q> Mr.
Berkeley, rather diſtreſſed, ſaid, ſmiling, <q rend="inline">"My <hi>old</hi> ſhoes,
Captain Lawley? I believe my ſervant would object to
that; but, if a pair of my new ones will do as well, I am
ſure there are a pair or two, if you pleaſe, very much at
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0761700600:826"/>
your ſervice."</q> He looked thoughtful, and replied, <q rend="inline">"I
think I ſhould like <hi>your</hi> ſhoes."</q> Mr. Grimſton conceived
that he meant it, as is ſometimes ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I would not be
in his ſhoes, or his coat,"</q> when any one is in a ſcrape.</p>
            <p>On opening the Captain's will at his death, it appeared
that he had, during his very few days illneſs, made a will
in favour of a gentleman, who, a few days before it, had
cauſed the gentleman and, the Editor thinks, ſome ladies
of character who boarded at Mr. Garret's (by their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants)
to prevent Captain Lawley from fighting this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
by contriving to prevent their meeting one evening.
He had, by this <hi>wonderful</hi> will, ruined two very near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(the Editor thinks nieces) whom he had obliged to
give up keeping a very good ſchool for young ladies, by
allowing them handſomely, and promiſing to leave them
his fortune.</p>
            <p>Mr. Monck Berkeley was ſo convinced that the Captain's
intellects were deranged, from the beginning of his illneſs,
that, being about to leave Bath, he left his addreſs in
writing with ſome proper perſon, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"If the will was
conteſted by the relations, he was ready to give his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
whenever called upon."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0761700600:827"/>
On the publication of the Captain's will, the very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Sir Robert Lawley, Baronet, his couſin-german, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"It ſhould be conteſted <hi>entirely</hi> at his expence, on behalf
of his worthy kinſwomen; and that himſelf would not
come in for a ſhilling of the fortune."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Some months before Mr. Monck Berkeley's death, he
received a letter from Doctors Commons, requeſting to
know when it would be convenient to him to receive ſome
gentlemen thence, to take his depoſitions concerning Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Lawley. He appointed an early day; and ſeveral gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
arrived one morning, from Wood's at Maidenhead
Bridge, at Dr. Berkeley's at Cookham, ſtayed near two hours
with Mr. Monck Berkeley, received his depoſition; and,
the Editor hopes, ſome <hi>very thick</hi> good Vannilla chocolate,
ſandwiches, white wine and water, &amp;c. which ſhe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to be ſent in to them.</p>
            <p>Mr. Berkeley requeſted, if he lived until it was decided,
that he might be informed whether the will were eſtabliſhed
or not. About a fortnight before his lamented death he
received a letter from a gentleman of the Commons, telling
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0761700600:828"/>
him that the Court had rejected the will of Captain
Lawley.</p>
            <p>It were much to be wiſhed that the Eccleſiaſtical Court
could ſometimes act as a Court of EQUITY. They would,
they ſhould ſurely, had they been applied to, have ſet
aſide the will of a wretched old Fanatic of Hull, who
after having kept his dutiful, amiable, only ſon near
nine years with an eminent Clergyman of the Church of
England, who takes private pupils, ſent him down to
Scotland to the Univerſity of St. Andrew's; as he wrote
to Dr. Forreſt, one of the Profeſſors, <q rend="inline">"that he might learn
to preach the <hi>everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> as a <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> miniſter
in England."</q> Mr. Rogers was accordingly, to his great
diſtreſs, entered of the Divinity Colledge. The wonderful
amiability of his nature, and the ſweetneſs of his manners,
rendered him univerſally beloved by perſons of all ranks.
His zeal to ſuccour and ſave, and his generoſity <hi>when ſaved,</hi>
to poor ſhipwrecked perſons on the coaſt of St. Andrew's,
uſed to occaſion Mr. Monck Berkeley's ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Well,
now Rogers <hi>is</hi> happy; he is poſting off to a wreck, with
three or four bottles, and blankets innumerable. He
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0761700600:829"/>
has ordered beds to be ready for all the poor creatures
that are eſcaped."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Rogers attended divine ſervice regularly at Dr.
Berkeley's every Sunday. Several letters arrived from the
father, aſking when his ſon would be FIT <hi>to preach</hi> in the
<hi>Meeting-houſe</hi> that <hi>he</hi> had <hi>built</hi> ready for him. This diverted
his friends: but, as the frogs in the fable ſay, <q rend="inline">"Although
it is <hi>ſport to you,</hi> it is <hi>death to us.</hi>"</q> Poor Mr. Rogers,
extremely diſtreſſed, applied, as hundreds of others did, to
Dr. Berkeley for advice and direction; who told him, <q rend="inline">"that
perhaps, if his wiſh was to become a Divine of the Church
of England, he had better apply to his Father, who, as
his grand deſire ſeemed to be to <hi>hear</hi> his ſon <hi>preach,</hi> and
as he was very rich, might buy the next preſentation
of a living with an aged incumbent on it."</q> The caſe was
properly ſtated to the old man; who ſoon returned for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<q rend="inline">"that, having met with ſome <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> who had agreed
to give him a <hi>very high</hi> rent for his meeting-houſe, he had
let it to them, left the Preſbyterians, and become a
<hi>Baptiſt himſelf;</hi> and his ſon might be of the Church of
England if he pleaſed."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0761700600:830"/>
Dr. Berkeley, with his wonted goodneſs, applied to his
old tutor, the preſent Archbiſhop of York, ſtating the caſe
to his Grace, and requeſting him to ordain Mr. Rogers,
on the teſtimonial of ſeveral of the reſpectable Profeſſors at
St. Andrew's with regard to his life and converſation.</p>
            <p>The Editor ſuppoſes that the teſtimonial of the learned
Dean Hill, Profeſſors Hunter, Baron, Cook, &amp;c. of Mr.
Rogers's learning, life, and converſation, and Dr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's
<hi>own</hi> knowledge of his holding <q rend="inline">"no doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Church of England as by law eſtabliſhed,"</q>
induced his Grace to ordain the very worthy young man,
without a teſtimonial from Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin.
Perhaps the Editor, in this laſt ſentence, may be wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
like a fool, as ſhe has not for many years heard
a teſtimonial for orders redde. If ſhe has ſo done, ſhe
is ſorry for it. The old man was ſo delighted, that he
ſet off in his poſt-chaiſe and <hi>four</hi> for York, to ſee his ſon
ordained in that magnificent Cathedral. He was quite
tranſported, and had <hi>ſome</hi> thoughts of becoming a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Church of England. However, that idea was
<hi>tranſient;</hi> and on his amiable ſon's going to ſettle at
or near Hull, this old <hi>numpſcull</hi> inſiſted on his <hi>preaching</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0761700600:831"/>
at the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> meeting; which Mr. Rogers utterly refuſing
to do, he caſt him off, married a young Baptiſt, and entirely
diſinherited him; and this throughly amiable man is now,
as the Editor hears from her beloved excellent friend,
Henry Grimſton, Eſquire, a diſtreſſed Curate at or near
Beverley in Yorkſhire. The old wretch allowed him very
handſomely during his reſidence at the Univerſity of St.
Andrew's, or his bounties to the poor could not have been
ſo extenſive as all then reſident there knew them to be;
but even then <q rend="inline">"the <hi>beaſt</hi> ſhewed his nature."</q>
            </p>
            <p>His only daughter, as Mr. Rogers was his only ſon, was
married to Captain Lee, the firſt officer, as it was then ſaid,
who ever ſailed from England in a copper-bottomed veſſel.</p>
            <p>This gentleman was either dead, or the ſhip and crew
ſuppoſed to be loſt, or carried into ſlavery; the Editor thinks
the latter to have been the caſe. And no entreaties could
prevail on this vile old HODMADOD to tell his poor ſon in
what part of the kingdom his ſiſter, with, the Editor
thinks, four young children, reſided.</p>

replied, in his moſt ſweetly plaintive voice, when feeling the
woes of other, <q rend="inline">"Alas! my dear Mother, he <hi>is</hi> in his ſenſes;
but he <hi>wants</hi> the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>feeling,</hi> which he knows <hi>his ſon</hi> has
in an eminent degree; and he is afraid that Rogers ſhould
aſſiſt his, I ſadly fear, diſtreſſed ſiſter, as it is ſo long ſince
her huſband has been heard of, and Rogers knows her
father <hi>won't</hi> relieve her, <hi>becauſe,</hi> the <hi>week</hi> before ſhe was
with <hi>his</hi> conſent to be married to Captain Lee, he bade
her <hi>turn him off,</hi> and marry a young, plump Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
parſon that he brought to her; but ſhe preferred
Captain Lee; and her <hi>cunning</hi> father took <hi>that</hi> opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to pocket the fortune he had promiſed to give to
Captain Lee with her."</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſurely a defect in our laws, although excellent in
general, that a vilely covetous, or horridly capricious father
or mother, can, at their <hi>own</hi> pleaſure, either beggar or
damn, perhaps both in one, their own ill-fated offspring.</p>
            <p>Parents ſhould have <hi>all</hi> power during youth, <hi>none</hi> at all
after children come to years of diſcretion; and, if they are
<hi>wiſe</hi> or <hi>juſt,</hi> if they have it, let them renounce it, as the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0761700600:833"/>
always ſolemnly proteſted to Dr. Berkeley that ſhe would
do, he uſing to ſay, when his children were young, that he
would leave them dependant on her for bread, that they
might be dutiful. Mrs. Berkeley aſſured him, that much
within a month after his deceaſe ſhe would put it out of
her power to rob the children of a dead father; that ſhe
would, by God's bleſſing, make them dutiful, although
they had an independance of ten thouſand a year.</p>
            <p>The Editor was exceedingly delighted the firſt time ſhe
heard it, and has diverted many perſons ſince, with the
account given of herſelf by the late, ſenſible, agreeable Lady
Grey, of Denne Hill, Kent, mother of the late Sir James
Grey, many years his Majeſty's Ambaſſador to the Court of
Spain,</p>
            <p>The Editor has an old trick, like her late excellent rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Sir Martin Wright, of thinking aloud. It is in her
quite involuntary, as ſhe conceives it muſt have been in
him. When ſitting on the <hi>judgement-ſeat,</hi> he would ſay
loud enough to be heard by the barriſters, ſome of whom
ſhe has heard relate it to her mother: <q rend="inline">"WELL PUT, Mr.
Hume Campbell; <hi>that</hi> will do."</q> And again, <q rend="inline">"OH!

LAMENTABLE, LAMENTABLE! Mr. <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, <hi>that will</hi>

ſhe made at Denne Hill, on entering the room where hung
a magnificent whole-length portrait of the then King of
Spain, of whom Mr. Clarke gives ſo curious an account,
as alſo of the lamentations of his amiable Queen, when the
ſentence of death was pronounced to her, not by <hi>French
devils,</hi> but by her wiſe, pious Confeſſor; the Editor's
eyes being better then than now, ſhe caught Dr. Berkeley,
entering juſt behind her, by the arm, exclaiming, <q rend="inline">"Oh!—look,
do look at that man; HE muſt be the uniting link
in the chain, between man and brute, between man and
devil."</q> This was quite involuntary. Had ſhe known it
had been the MONSTER MONARCH, who, to try a new
fowling-piece, took aim and killed a poor maſon's labourer
aſcending a ladder in view, the <hi>pre-jugée</hi> might have had
ſhare in her ſentence. To be ſure, according to the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's
idea, it is the moſt extraordinary countenance ſhe
ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>The witty, worthy Lady Grey, who became a widow
before ſhe was thirty, and continued ſuch until ninety,
when, the oil all exhauſted, the lamp went gently out,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0761700600:835"/>
uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"I don't know how it is that young widows
marry ſo faſt: <hi>I</hi> could not contrive to do it. To be
ſure, <hi>very ſoon</hi> after Sir James's death, I had a multitude
of lovers, from Lords and Commons. I heard of nothing
but my <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>wit.</hi> However, as ſoon as I had a
little dried my eyes for the death of poor Sir James, I
ſent for a lawyer, and ſettled the money (about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand pounds) that he had left <hi>entirely</hi> in my
power on his poor little orphans; and whether it was
that I grew ugly and fooliſh at <hi>nine and twenty,</hi> or <hi>what
elſe</hi> I know not; but ſo it was, <hi>I</hi> never heard a word
more of my wit or beauty, nor ever had a lover after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards."</q>
Her witty Ladyſhip had admirers, if not lovers,
to the laſt of her long life on earth.</p>
            <p>A poor, old, doating, rich Divine in the neighbourhood
of Cloyne, a widower with ſeveral children, was going to
marry a girl; it reached the ears of Biſhop Berkeley, who
immediately viſited him, and, introducing the ſubject, the
old gentleman ſaid, <q rend="inline">"that he ſhould not have thought of
it, but that the <hi>young Lady was ſo exceedingly in love with
him.</hi>"</q> How much weaker is <hi>ſecond</hi> childhood, <q rend="inline">"<hi>ſans
eyes, ſans teeth,</hi>"</q> &amp;c. &amp;c. than the firſt! The Biſhop
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0761700600:836"/>
ſaid, <q rend="inline">"if that was the caſe, the Lady would at any rate
marry him."</q> He aſſented, and the Biſhop prevailed on
him to ſettle his fortune on his children after his own
death; which ſo entirely cured the young lady's <hi>violent
paſſion</hi> for him, that he was ſuffered to go to his grave under
the care of his worthy children, the beſt guardians for aged
perſons when God vouchſafes to ſpare them.</p>
            <p>Dr. Berkeley uſed ſometimes to aſk Mrs. Berkeley,
<q rend="inline">"what could induce her to marry, who could well enough
manage all her own buſineſs?"</q> &amp;c. Her uniform reply
was, <q rend="inline">"That ſhe might enjoy, and improve by, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of a man, of many men of ſuperior under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
whilſt ſhe had ſenſe enough left to enjoy it,
and to have ſome ſenſible, worthy children to <hi>love</hi> and
GOVERN her, if ſhe ſhould (which ſhe <hi>never</hi> wiſhed,
always dreaded, yet never dared to pray againſt) attain to
old age."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Editor uſed frequently to conjure her dear Son, if
ſhe ſhould attain to old age, to govern <hi>her</hi> as carefully as
ſhe had governed <hi>him</hi> in his childhood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0761700600:837"/>
The Editor is juſt returned from her Pariſh-church,
where, it being (December 21) Saint Thomas's day, ſhe
heard the proper leſſon, Proverbs xxiii. one of her <hi>guiding</hi>
chapters, and where every reward promiſed to a watchful
parent is recorded. She humbly praiſed the mercy of God,
he had vouchſafed to permit her to experience in its <hi>fulleſt</hi>
extent.</p>
            <p>But the Editor did not wiſh her Son to govern her <hi>exactly</hi>
in the ſame mode in which ſhe had governed him, not
looking up upon him for two days, one of Mr. Monck
Berkeley's puniſhments from about ſeven to ten years old,
ſitting on the ſame chair without moving for an hour—once,
alas! for full three hours by the careleſſneſs of his
mother. One day before tea-time he was ordered to ſit

His Mother, called
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0761700600:838"/>
into the Drawing-room to make tea, left him; before tea
was quite over, Dr. Berkeley ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It is a heavenly
evening; we will croſs the water, and walk to Cliefden.
Be quick. My dear, get your hat."</q> The Editor never,
when young, made <hi>any</hi> one wait for <hi>her,</hi> eſpecially her Mother,
and her Lord and Maſter, as ſhe uſed <hi>(en badinant)</hi> to ſtyle Dr.
Berkeley, called her maid, got her hat, &amp;c. and ſkipped
away, thoughtleſs of her ſweet little priſoner until ſhe had
croſſed the Thames, when ſhe wiſhed to have returned;
but Dr. Berkeley ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Oh! he'll get off when he finds
you gone out."</q> The Editor expreſſed her fear that he
would not; but ſhe proceeded on her walk. On her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
ſhe was met at the ferry by Mr. Monck Berkeley's
ever-kind friend, John, leſt ſhe ſhould make any call in the
village; ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Will you be pleaſed, Madam, to go
home, that Maſter Berkeley may go to bed (then nine
o'clock, he juſt ſeven years old), for none of <hi>us</hi> can
prevail upon him to ſtir off the chair, where, he ſays,
you <hi>ordered</hi> him to ſit, and not ſtir till <hi>you</hi> came to him.
We promiſed him you would not be angry; but nothing
would do, and there he ſits."</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0761700600:839"/>
The Editor left Dr. Berkeley, and ran home the ſhorteſt
way ſhe could find, through all the high, dew-beſprinkled
graſs, to her obedient little man.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Berkeley was about thirteen, he one day ſaid
to his Mother, <q rend="inline">"I wiſh you would be ſo good as to write

            </p>
            <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"I am ſorry you do not."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. B.—<q rend="inline">"So am I; but you know how wilful you

            </p>
            <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"Well, but I always obey you <hi>at laſt.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. B.—<q rend="inline">"Yes; but that is not being DUTY—FUL."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"Well; but I am OBEDIENT then."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. B.—<q rend="inline">"Yes, you certainly do <hi>obey me.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. B.—<q rend="inline">"Well, then, you will be ſo good as to write

            </p>
            <p>The words were immediately written. The ſweet
lad's eyes ſparkled with joy when he redde them. He
carefully folded them up, and walked away to his own
room. At dinner the curious dialogue was related to dear
Dr. Berkeley, and the Editor never heard or thought of it
more, until examining the ſmall trunk, containing many of
his precious depoſits, delivered into her hands by the
faithful Mrs. Leyceſter, Mr. Berkeley's bed-maker at Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen
Hall, mentioned before in this Preface. This <hi>teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial</hi>
of her dear Son's obedience, ſigned, as requeſted,
with her name, lay carefully folded.</p>
            <p>The Editor, from a youth, had always told Mr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
that he was the <hi>eldeſt Son</hi> in the Goſpel, <q rend="inline">"Son, go

Once, when ſhe requeſted him much to viſit in town a
very old friend of hers, well known in the <hi>ton</hi> world, but
who did not happen to hit Mr. Berkeley's fancy, and he
begged to be excuſed viſiting the gentleman; Mrs.
Berkeley replied, <q rend="inline">"Well, my dear, then let it alone."</q>
He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"My dear Mother, I have a very large ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance

            </p>
            <p>The morning that he was leaving the Oaks he crept to

The Editor's requeſt to her dear ſon to govern her, in
return for her having <hi>ſo well</hi> governed him, recals to mind
what he one day ſaid at St. Andrew's.</p>
            <p>Soon after his return from a viſit in the Country to his
beloved friend, the univerſally beloved, reſpected, amiable
Sir John Ramſay, Advocate in Edinburgh, whoſe early
death, at twenty-eight, Mr. Berkeley never ceaſed to
lament, when ſpeaking of that excellent young gentleman.
Mr. Berkeley ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I am certainly a very lucky fellow;
for, let me go where I will, I <hi>always find</hi> a mother. At
Cookham, when my mother was not in company, if I
ſaid or did any aukward ridiculous thing, my dear Mrs.

His great good ſenſe, like that of his dear friend Mr.
Grimſton, made him add, <q rend="inline">"I am ſure I am much obliged
to them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Grimſton, one day ſpeaking of the ſon of a York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire
Baronet, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"he has had <hi>great</hi> advantages by being

            <p>Mr. Berkeley felt very ſincerely for his highly reſpected
friend Lady Ramſay, the loſs of two ſo amiable ſons in the
very prime of life. He felt, indeed, for ALL in diſtreſs,
<q rend="inline">"whether of <hi>mind, body,</hi> or <hi>eſtate;</hi>"</q> a ſtrong proof of which
the Editor cannot forbear reciting here. During his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

in the Univerſity at St. Andrew's Dr. Berkeley
dining in the country, ſoon after dinner Mr. Berkeley
walked out, and returning immediately, flew into the eating
room, and exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Beſt of Mothers, how <hi>can you</hi> ſit
reading here as if nothing had happened?"</q> The Editor
ſprang up, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Good God, child, has your Father been
overturned."</q>

            <p>Mr. Berkeley.—<q rend="inline">"<hi>No, I hope not;</hi> but a poor unhappy man's
foot is juſt now torn off above his ancle, by the mill."</q>

            <p>Mrs. B.—<q rend="inline">"Well, my dear child, could I know that by

The moment this was applied it ceaſed; but that was genuine, prepared by, and procured from, the honeſt wife of the Mancheſter baker; to whom a famous French ſurgeon, in gratitude for her goodneſs in nurſing him through a very long illneſs, communicated the ſecret. For years it was ſold only in Mancheſter. Happy for the public had it continued, as well as ſome other famous Patent Medicines, in honeſt hands. The Editor means, if God ſpares her life, to give in the Gentleman's Magazine ſome account of the almoſt miraculous cures wrought by this aſtoniſhingly fine medicine, as many medical gentlemen, high in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, have declared it to be, when they have by their <hi>eloquence</hi> prevailed on the Editor to let them taſte it—ſhe not exhibiting to the <hi>Faculty,</hi> left they ſhould maliciouſly laugh, as ſhe tells them, and call her <q rend="inline">"<hi>Lady Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful.</hi>"</q> Alas! ſhe cannot now get it from Mr. Hatfield the baker's daughter at Mancheſter.

She hopes and believes that her private admonition has, on his <hi>own</hi> account, wrought re-formation on the Medicine, if not on Preparer.

            <p>Mr. Melville ſoon arrived, the poor man did well, and
perhaps is now living, bleſſing, with many others in St.
Andrew's, Mr. Monck Berkeley's lovely charity. The
poor man was warned not five minutes before, by a woman
of the mill, to be aware of the rope that tore off his foot;
but warning, alas! does not <hi>always</hi> avail. The neglecting
it muſt add weight to calamity.</p>
            <p>The loſs of this poor man's foot recalls to the Editor's
mind the preſervation of the leg of a relation of hers, S.
Cherry, Eſquire, a couſin-german of Mr. Cherry, who

Marlborough, when beſieging <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

dinner in a ſaw-pit; they agreed to make a table, by every
man laying his right leg acroſs the pit, inſtead of dropping
both into it. On beginning their dinner they wanted
ſalt or muſtard; one ſaid, go you; another, go you to
the ſutlers; at length Captain Cherry jumped up, ſaying,
<q rend="inline">"I will go."</q> At his return, he found that every officer
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0761700600:850"/>
had loſt a leg; a chain ball had been fired from the battery,
and had quite taken off the leg of ſome, and ſo ſhattered
thoſe of the others, that the ſurgeon was obliged to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putate
them. Poor men, they all lived and went halting
to the <q rend="inline">"houſe appointed for all living,"</q> on one leg, as
the Editor has frequently heard her unmaimed rèlation ſay,
at fourſcore he had not loſt one of as fine a ſet of teeth as
ever were ſeen, as white as at twenty years old;—his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight

ſome pleaſure to her to think that her Father and Mother

            <head type="sub">Altered by the equally-pious, better-informed, MRS. CATHARINE
TALBOT, of <hi>Lambeth Palace</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Several
gentlemen one day at Lambeth Palace, ſome Divines amongſt them, were
admiring theſe verſes of the pious, learned Mr. Norris. Miſs Talbot, ever
chearful, evèr delighting to look forward with joy to <hi>that</hi>
world where ſhe, through faith, well knew that happineſs <hi>was</hi> to be
found, which ſhe <hi>too</hi> well knew <hi>was not</hi> to be found here,
ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"I never could bear that Poem of Norris's."</q> Several, with
one voice, exclaimed,
<q rend="inline">"Who could have written a finer on <hi>that</hi>
ſubject?"</q> She, laughing, replied,
<q rend="inline">"Any one."</q> Some one ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"I wiſh you would, then."</q>
                  <q rend="inline">"Well, go get me the book, and a pen; and I will at leaſt,
if not make a better, mend that;"</q> which ſhe immediately certainly did as
above. This is copied from the altered one in the hand-writing of that
lovelieſt of women. That entirely beloved friend, who gave it to the Editor
the next day, by whom it has been carefully preſerved for more than thirty
years, ſhe (Miſs Talbot) ſaying,
<q rend="inline">"I cannot bear to hear perſons, who I really think believe
in the all-ſufficiency of Chriſt, admire ſuch ſtuff as
<q>
                        <l>"Death could not a more <hi>ſad</hi> retinue find,</l>

                     </q>
                  </q> Poets ſometimes take <hi>ſtrange</hi> flights. Good Mr. Norris, in
one of his Poems, ſhocked the Editor, when ſhe was a very young woman,
hardly a woman;—ſaying, in his Poem on the death of ſome young
Norfolk lady,
<q rend="inline">"that Heaven wanted the preſence of her (I think Mrs.
Margaret Paſtarn's) ſpirit, to make it a place of <hi>complete</hi>
happineſs."</q> She flew to her Mother, to enquire if it was not BLASPHEMY.
Were Mrs. Frinſham ſtill on earth, the Editor would not trouble her
concerning thoſe lines, ſhe thinking of them juſt as ſhe did at
fifteen. She bleſſes GOD that no <hi>ſuch</hi> flights are to be found in
Mr. Monck Berkeley's Poems. The Editor cannot omit mentioning here two ſhort
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations held with her Son at the diſtance of almoſt ten years.
When a <hi>very</hi> young man, he ſhewed to his Mother ſome charming
verſes that he had written to a friend on the death of a <hi>very near</hi>
and dear relation. His Mother ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"You ſeem to offer all your conſolation from Heathen
Philoſophers."</q> He replied,
<q rend="inline">"Beſt of Mothers! what could I do? Would you have had me
offered it from the Bible to a man <hi>that you</hi> know does not believe that
bleſſed Book!"</q> The ſecond, near ten years after—Mrs. Berkeley
ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"My dear, I dare ſay, although <hi>I</hi> am no judge, that
the lines are very fine; but there is not a <hi>tittle</hi> ſaid of the
<hi>only</hi> thing that could conſole <hi>you,</hi> were the Almighty to
deprive you of your poor Mother—that ſhe was gone to Chriſt."</q> Mr.
Berkeley looked ſweetly ſad, and replied,
<q rend="inline">"Oh, beſt of Mothers! <hi>But I could</hi> not offer THAT
conſolation concerning one who I have, alas! <hi>too good</hi> reaſon to
fear <hi>did not</hi> believe <hi>in</hi> CHRIST—Surely SUCH <hi>can
never go to</hi> HIM. I have ſaid all that my <hi>conſcience</hi> would
ſuffer me to ſay, to ſoothe a <hi>little</hi> the anguiſh of their
ſpirits on the loſs of an <hi>agreeable</hi> Mother."</q> Chriſt ſays,
<q rend="inline">"Except ye believe that I AM, ye ſhall die in your
ſins."</q> What a threat to SOCINIANS and to the ARIANS! Lord Monboddo, in
his "Ancient Metaphyſics," ſays,
<q rend="inline">"The ARIAN HERESY was the <hi>ſubtleſt</hi> that ever
infected the Chriſtian Church."</q> Many years ago, a gentleman on a viſit
at Dr. Berkeley's at Cookham ſaid, that, in his way through London on the
preceding Sunday, reſting on the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, he had heard the following
ſentence uttered from the pulpit by a very learned Divine, preaching on the
above-cited words of our adored Redeemer,
<q rend="inline">"If ye believe not that I AM,"</q> &amp;c.
<q rend="inline">"If JESUS CHRIST be not GOD, perfectly equal with the Father,
I had <hi>rather truſt</hi> to the BLOOD of a DOG for my Salvation than to
that of CHRIST, who, if not <hi>abſolutely equal</hi> with the Father,
<hi>is</hi> an IMPOSTOR."</q> Some one ſaid,
<q rend="inline">"That is very <hi>ſtrong</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage!"</q> Dr. Berkeley
replied,
<q rend="inline">"But it is certainly right, or true,"</q> (the Editor forgets
which word he uſed. Whatever ARIAN can be happy enough to lay eyes on the
<hi>wonderful</hi> work of the late very deeply learned Reverend Meredith
Jones, many years Chaplain to the preſent venerable Lord Biſhop of
