            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <speaker>Fain.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh! — that's too long a Story at present.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fainwell</hi>! — what the Devil is this <hi>Metamorphose</hi> for?</p>

                  <speaker>Fain.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fain.</speaker>
                  <p>The <hi>old standing Dish,</hi> a WIFE! Here's no Hopes of <hi>War,</hi> no <hi>Rising</hi> in View! and <hi>Subaltern</hi>'s Pay will make a Man <hi>rub but slowly through the World.</hi> I have got Leave of my Colonel to be absent from my Post for Two Months, in which Time, <hi>I intend to make my Fortune.</hi> —You know the Widow <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi>!</p>

                  <p>Yes, faith, I march in the Number of her <hi>Retinue.</hi>

               <sp>

                  <p>To what End?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fain.</speaker>
                  <p>That's uncertain. If you know the <hi>Widow,</hi> you are no Stranger to <hi>her Taste</hi> in <hi>Servants.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>

                  <p>Ay! and is a perfect <hi>Jockey</hi> in her Family, and takes as much Pains to polish her <hi>Train,</hi> as they do to break their young <hi>Colts.</hi> Now, you must know, I pass with her for as arrant a <hi>Rustick,</hi> as <hi>ever wield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cudgel at a Country Wake,</hi> or <hi>tumbled Girl upon a Hay-mow.</hi>

                  <speaker>Fain.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, you must know, I make Love to her.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>Make Love to her! what, under the Character of a Footman?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fain.</speaker>
                  <p>No, no, under the Character of a Gentleman of Fifteen hundred Pounds a Year in <hi>Gloucester-shire,</hi> of which Country I pretend to be; for having Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd heretofore in that Shire, I counterfeit the Dialect very well.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>But what Service can this be to you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fain.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, I write to her as from Mr. <hi>Worthy</hi>; my Man brings the Letters; and I deliver them as <hi>Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,</hi> her Footman; and when I find her in Humour, I intend to give her my Picture, in so simple a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that she shall take it all for Gospel.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>But what signifies the Copy? How will you introduce the Original?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fain.</speaker>
                  <p>That has been done already. I have made her several Visits. My Man is now gone to her with a Letter.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>But suppose she should enquire after this Mr. <hi>Worthy</hi>? It is an easy Matter to know all the Gentlemen in <hi>Gloucestershire,</hi> and what Estates they are possess'd of too.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fain.</speaker>
                  <p>She can't trap me there, if she does: For, between you and I, there is such a Person as Mr. <hi>Worthy,</hi> Master of the very Estate I mention, who has given me Leave to take his Name. — But I have discover'd since I have been in her House, that an <hi>Irish</hi> Baron is my Rival.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>Then you are undone; for I am told, she declares against Matrimony without a Title. Who is he?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fain.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Pharoah-Bank,</hi> I think they call him, of the County of <hi>Tipperary.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't remember ever to have heard of any such Nobleman.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fain.</speaker>
                  <p>Recommended, they say, by Sir <hi>Philip Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Love.</hi>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>For which he is to have a valuable Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; for I am sure, he does nothing out of Honour or Honesty. I wish thee Success with all my Heart.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fain.</speaker>
                  <p>I thank you, <hi>Freeman</hi>; but prithee, who are you in Mourning for? Is the old Knight at Rest Six Foot deep? ha, <hi>Jack?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>He has been dead to me these Seven Years; but is now so to all the World, <hi>Fainwell.</hi>

                  <p>I hope you'll give me the Estate too, <hi>Fainwell</hi>; for, I assure you, I have not one Foot of Land by the Death of my Father.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay! whilst there is any Money in them; but, I remember, you left me for fear of Starving.</p>

                  <speaker>Sam.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I did Sir; and into the Widow's own Hands; and, truly, by what I can find, Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, you have nothing to hope for, if I have any Judgment.</p>

                  <speaker>Sam.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, I observ'd when she read your Epistle, she smil'd scornfully, thus —toss'd your Letter upon her Toylet; turn'd upon her Heel; tipp'd her Maid a Box o' the Ear for Grinning, and bad me tell you, it required no Answer.</p>

                  <p>Add to that some little Wildnesses. But the main thing that did my Business, was this; When I found nothing wou'd open his Purse-strings, I pretended to embrace his Principles.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sam.</speaker>

                  <p>But, as the Devil wou'd have it, one Day, in my Cups, I chanced to stumble into a Non-juring Meeting, with half a Dozen honest Officers at my Back, drove out the Congregation, ty'd the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Neck and Heels, lock'd the Door, and took the Key in my Pocket.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>Some of his Flock returning to Evening. Prayer, broke open the Door, and freed him from Durance; amongst which Number was my natural Father.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Fain.</speaker>
                  <p>Rather Unnatural! That was very unlucky, Sir <hi>John.</hi>

                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay; for that Action not only lost me a paternal Blessing, but a paternal Estate.</p>

                  <speaker>Fain.</speaker>
                  <p>Which would have afforded thee many Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, Wine and Women, Sir <hi>John,</hi> the only Blessings in this World! So your younger Brother <hi>Ned</hi> has the Estate, I suppose.</p>

                  <p>So say Passion and Necessity; but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and Humanity offer to my cooler Thoughts a brown Musquet rather. I confess, I long to exert the elder Brother, and beat him a little; In order to which, I have done all I could to provoke him to give me Occasion; but he avoids me as carefully as if he durst not fight, though I know he's no Coward.</p>

                     <p>His denying it, Madam, will signify nothing; we have unquestionable Proofs; Causes of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture never come into our Court without Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.— He must undergo the Sentence usual in these Cases. — Which is, To stand in a White-Sheet, and humbly confess his Faults before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Besides which,

you will be compelled to pay Costs and Damages.— And if you are found Guilty of Contumacy, as your present Behaviour seems to promise, we shall get you Excommunicated.</p>

                     <p>Love, and War agree in every Point, my dear Widow; The Blockade of a Town resembles an obstinate Woman, and a Phlegmatick Lover, who resolves to weary her into Compliance. A Kiss now and then from a diffident Lover, is like stealing a March, and surprizing the Enemy, by a circumspect General. But eager and repeated Kisses, are, like Storming, more glorious to the Assailant.</p>

                     <p>Well, pursue your Voyage to <hi>Jamaica</hi>; sell your Effects; return and purchase a Barony; which you may easily do, in Eight or Ten Months, and you shall see if I am in Earnest, or not.</p>

               <l>Our Bard has paid it off upon the Stage,</l>
               <l>And strongly labour'd in these Scenes, to show ye,</l>
               <l>How <hi>Woman</hi> can in <hi>Artifice</hi> out-do ye.</l>
               <l>You Bungle sadly, and are always Caught,</l>
               <l>E'er half your Work is to Perfection brought.</l>
               <l>Did our Town-Wives their Schemes no better lay,</l>
               <l>What <hi>Monstrous Plots</hi> wou'd break out ev'ry Day?</l>
               <l>Ladies, I hope, I've acted to your Mind,</l>
               <l>And serv'd my <hi>Jealous Monster</hi> in his Kind.</l>
               <l>To play the <hi>Priest,</hi> and steal a Wife's Confession;</l>
               <l>What Man can make Amends for such Transgression?</l>
               <l>Shou'd all our <hi>English</hi> Husbands Shrive their Wives,</l>
               <l>Women wou'd lead most Comfortable Lives.</l>
               <l>For of all Slavery, 'tis the worst Condition,</l>
               <l>To Live beneath a <hi>Marriage Inquisition.</hi>

               <l>What think you of our <hi>Hogan-Mogan Belle?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Didn't she trick the Trickster nicely well?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0047602700:115"/>The Whipster thought, forsooth, 'twas smart and clever,</l>
               <l>To swell the Young <hi>Vrow</hi> up, and then to leave her.</l>
               <l>But on the Younker a <hi>Dutch</hi> Trick she palms;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Poison</hi> for <hi>Poison</hi> gives, and <hi>Qualms</hi> for <hi>Qualms.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>What Rake among you, but, in his Condition,</l>
               <l>Wou'd ev'n think a <hi>Wife</hi> a good <hi>Physician?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Did this <hi>Dutch</hi> Law our roving Gentry bind,</l>
               <l>How Charming wou'd it be for Woman-kind!</l>
               <l>Then ev'ry Nymph that has vouchsaf'd the Favour,</l>
               <l>Might tye her Lover up to good Behaviour:</l>
               <l>And after she has put him to the Test,</l>
               <l>Might take, or leave him, —as she lik'd it best.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>You who are Noos'd, let me advise; Beware,</l>
               <l>Give o'er your Jealous Freaks, and trust the <hi>Fair:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For, look-ye, you may Rant, and play the Devil;</l>
               <l>There's nought but <hi>Patience</hi> cures the <hi>Marriage-Evil.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The Thing is plain, and Instances are Common;</l>
               <l>No <hi>Man</hi> is Half a Match for any <hi>Woman.</hi>
