            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SCARCE any diſorder has afforded greater matter of ſpeculation, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of late Years, than the <hi>Diabetes;</hi> yet the true <hi>Rationale</hi> of it is not ſo accurately underſtood, as to render a farther enquiry into its nature and cauſes, in order, if poſſible, to ſearch out the reaſons of the ſeveral Symptoms of it, uſeleſs or unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Amongſt the Antients is was ſeldom heard of. <hi>Aretaeus</hi> ſpeaks of it, as ſomething mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1021800200:3"/>labouring under this complaint. The <hi>uncommoneſs</hi> of it might be owing to a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner of Living, but the diſorder was probably the ſame. For the deſcription, which they give of it, in the moſt eſſential points agrees with that of the Moderns; it is true indeed, that moſt of them ſpeak of liquor paſſing through the kidney not in the leaſt chang'd, and make no mention of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Urine: But theſe are miſtakes, which the colour of the Urine for want of accuracy, and obſervation, might be the cauſe of their falling into; for, as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, it always appears crude, and watry as of thoſe labouring with the <hi>Pica,</hi> or with the Dropſy. Their Methods alſo of cure, which were rationally founded, and in moſt reſpects ſimilar to the preſent practiſe, are a farther confirmation of this opinion. <hi>Galen</hi> made uſe of the following Medicines, as he himſelf te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, to the great relief of his Patient. <hi>Bol.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1021800200:4"/>and to cool the body. But this will be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſider'd in its proper place. It may not be improper, before we enter upon the enquiry, briefly to point out the opinions, which the Ancients and ſome of the Moderns entertain'd of this diſeaſe.</p>

The former is a voiding of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors by Urine without undergoing any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the body: The latter is a voiding of a much larger quantity of Urine than of liquids receiv'd into the body: The cauſe of the former, he thinks, is owing to a laxity and openneſs of the paſſages, which lead di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from the firſt paſſages to the kidnies. But theſe, he confeſſes, are not yet known, and no wonder; becauſe it is evident from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1021800200:7"/>the niceſt obſervations made in Anatomy, that there are no ſuch paſſages leading directly to the kidnies, as he imagines, and therefore that no liquor can poſſibly arrive to the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but by firſt entring into the blood. To account for the latter, he ſuppoſes, a ſharp acrimony in the blood, which reſolves, atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates, and melts down the blood, and even the muſcular fleſh itſelf into ſerum, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus melted down, ſtimulate the kidnies, and force their paſſage. But this account of it is ſo very ſtrange and unphiloſophical, that it will not admit of a ſerious conſideration.</p>

               <hi>Liſter</hi> is ſingular in his opinion, and thinks that the chief ſeat of this diſorder is in the Stomach, and ſmall Inteſtines: <hi>At primaria hujus morbi ſedes eſt Stomachus, &amp; Inteſtina tenuia:</hi> But if theſe parts of the body were principally affected, a <hi>Lientery,</hi> or a <hi>Diarrhaea</hi> rather than a <hi>Diabetes,</hi> would ſurely be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> that great Phyſician of his time, obſerves, that Rheniſh Wine, Cyder, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid liquors being drank provoke a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>Diureſis</hi> or evacuation by Urine: The cauſe of this evacuation he attributes to a fuſion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1021800200:8"/>or melting of the blood into ſeroſities by ſuch acid liquors; ſo that the Craſis or mixtion of the blood being diſſolv'd, the watry parts cannot be contain'd by the more thick, but ſliding from their embraces, and being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu'd with ſaline particles, do run through the moſt open paſſages of the Reins, and ſo cauſe a <hi>Diabetes.</hi> And he gives us an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of one, who by uſing Rheniſh Wine for his ordinary drink twenty days together, contracted an incurable <hi>Diabetes,</hi> of which he dy'd within a month. But the <hi>Diabetes</hi> in this caſe, and when brought on by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate drinking of ſuch thin acid liquors does not ſeem to be owing to ſuch a diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood, as the Doctor intimates, but to the natural diſpoſition of ſuch liquors to paſs off by Urine. The Secerning Veſſels of the kidney then muſt neceſſarily be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded by the great quantity of fluids, which they admit, and of courſe greatly relax'd, and hence a <hi>Diabetes</hi> will enſue, as will be ſhewn more particularly in its due place. For let the blood be in ever ſo diſſolute and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a ſtate, this Diſtemper will not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, unleſs there is a relaxation of the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in conjunction with it, but rather a drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and for reaſons that have been already
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1021800200:9"/>inſiſted upon. An immoderate drinking then of acid liquors, and thin wines, by their quick and ſuddain paſſage through the kidneys will bring on a debility of theſe organical parts, widen their Secretory ducts, and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner produce a <hi>Diabetes;</hi> and ſuch an exceſs of them ſeems to be the moſt frequent cauſe of it.</p>
            <p>The account which
<note n="a" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Animal Secretion</hi> p. 70.</note> Dr. <hi>James Keil</hi> gives of this diſeaſe comes next to be conſider'd.</p>
            <p>He aſſerts <q>"that the moſt evident cauſe of this diſeaſe is an habitual drinking of ſtrong liquors; and that the more ſpirituous they are, the ſooner and more violently they bring it. By ſuch an habitual drinking of ſtrong liquors it comes to paſs in proceſs of time, that the Serum, or thin part of the blood, contains a large proportion of a ſpirituous Fluid, or that part of the Serum, which ſhould be water, is for the greateſt part Spirit. Now the Salts of the Urine or blood will not diſſolve in a vinous ſpirit, that is, the particules of which the ſalts conſiſt, are more ſtrongly attracted by one another, than they are by ſuch a fluid, as by experiment
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1021800200:10"/>appears; and therefore the Quantity of Salts in the blood will be daily increas'd, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating through the Capillary Veſſels muſt irritate the fine fibres, and cauſe little pains and twitchings all over the body, which, he ſays, are the preceding Symptoms of this diſorder. But when the Serum is full of theſe ſalts, the diſtance between them and the Globules of the blood will be leſs, and conſequently they will attract the Globules of the blood more ſtrongly than the Globules attract one another; And the Globules or red part of the blood will be diſſolv'd and diffus'd through the Serum of the blood. And this again is confirm'd by experiments, for nothing does render the red part of the blood ſo fluid, and keeps it more from coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating when drawn into a cup, than U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinous Salts and Spirits. When the red part of the blood is thus diſſolv'd, and united to its Serum, it will with the Serum be carried off through the Glands of the kidneys, and being united to their Salts, will alter their Figures, and properties, as Litharge and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral do the Salts of Vinegar, giving them a ſweet taſte."</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this account of the <hi>Diabetes</hi> there ſeems to be more ingenuity, than truth. That Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1021800200:11"/>liquors when drank to exceſs may be productive of this diſorder, will be ſhewn in the ſequel of this diſſertation; but that an habitual drinking of them is the moſt evident cauſe of it, is evidently not true. But grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a diſſolution of the red part of the blood, as the Dr. imagines, which may be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but does by no means ſeem probable, there is no reaſon aſſign'd, why it ſhould with its Serum be carried off through the Glands of the kidney. The objections which have been already made, occur here.</p>
            <p>Proceed we now to the opinion of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
<note n="a" place="bottom">In the new Edit. of his book on poiſons p. 32.</note> Dr. <hi>Mead,</hi> which demands our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention as well for its ſingularity, as for the eminent Character of its Author. <q>"The <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betes,</hi> he ſays, is not as Phyſicians have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly judg'd, a diſtemper of the <hi>Kidneys,</hi> but of the <hi>Liver,</hi> proceeding likewiſe from a vitiated mixture of the bile. It moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens to thoſe, who without due exerciſe indulge themſelves in drinking vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous liquors, and then quench their thirſt ariſing from theſe, by too great a quantity of ſuch as are cooling.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>By ſuch ill-timed heating, and cooling of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1021800200:12"/>the humours of the body, the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Salt in the bile, by which its oily part is incorporated with the water, is not ſufficient, now the water over-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, to preſerve the mixture: So that a great portion of this, together with ſome of the thinneſt of the oil will be diſcharg'd by the kidneys; and the Urinary Ducts will be greatly enlarg'd by a conſtant aflux that way. By which means the thicker oily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are left in a degree of coagulation in the ſmaller tubes of the Liver, and are there form'd into a hard fatty ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>The diſſection of thoſe, who have died of the <hi>Diabetes,</hi> proves this to be ſo: For I have always found a <hi>ſteatomatous</hi> collection in their Liver, in appearance not unlike to what is often diſcharg'd by ſtools in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd jaundice, but of a harder conſiſtence."</p>
            </q>
            <p>In the firſt place let it be here obſerv'd, that the texture of the
<note n="a" place="bottom">v. Boerhaave<hi>'s</hi> acad. Lect. V. 3. p. 110.</note> kidney is ſo very cloſe and compact, that in its natural ſtate, before it has ſuffer'd any kind of violence, it will not admit any oily ſubſtance whatever, unleſs it be highly attenuated, and thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incorporated in a proper vehicle. A Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1021800200:13"/>dilatation of the kidney muſt be <hi>prior</hi> to its admittance of any fluid, that is more groſs than the Urine. It does not then ſeem probable, that even this thinneſt oil in ſuch circumſtances, when the mixture is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, can be admitted to paſs through the kidney. Beſide, ſuch a diſpoſition of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as is here ſuppos'd, and ſuch a vitiated mixture of the bile muſt neceſſarily be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a high <hi>jaundice,</hi> but as the <hi>Diabetes</hi> often appears without the leaſt icterical Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom, it ſeems neceſſarily to follow, that the liver is not the Seat of the <hi>Diabetes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ingenious Dr. <hi>Randolph</hi> in his treatiſe upon the Medicinal Virtues of the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, after having made ſome juſt obſervations upon theſe accounts of it laſt mention'd, gives us his opinion of it, and is inclin'd to think the kidnies the Seat of this diſorder, tho' he owns, that the great alteration made in the Urine ſeems very much to favour the opinion of a fault in the fluids; for if the kidnies, ſays he, were only in fault, why ſhould Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betical Urine differ ſo much from that which is natural, not only in <hi>Quantity,</hi> but in <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> alſo? But the reaſon of this alteration will evidently appear by proſecuting the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry farther, than ſeems to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1021800200:14"/>with his deſign; and in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed more methodically;</p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt deſcribe a <hi>Diabetes</hi> by pointing out the ſeveral Symptoms of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, ſhew how a relaxation of the <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> Ducts of the kidnies with a broken ſtate of the blood, which may be <hi>prior</hi> to ſuch a relaxation, muſt neceſſarily be the cauſe of ſuch Symptoms, and when not, will be the conſequence of it.</p>
            <p>A Perſon then is known to labour under a <hi>Diabetes</hi> by the following Symptoms, to wit; a copious and frequent diſcharge of pale-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd Urine; the taſte of which is ſweet; the Quantity evacuated exceeds in proportion the Quantity of liquors taken in; it is found to acquire a ropy conſiſtence by being expos'd for ſome time to the air; as a conſequence of this diſcharge, a hectick fever, loſs of fleſh, great thirſt, a ſenſe of weakneſs about the Loyns; and if <hi>conſtitutional,</hi> or too far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd by a neglect of proper remedies, the Perſon ſo affected in reality dies of a conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. Theſe are then the moſt remarkable Symptoms of a <hi>Diabetes,</hi> and the known con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it.</p>
            <p>I am in the next place to ſhew how a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the <hi>Secretory</hi> Ducts of the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1021800200:15"/>with a diſſolute broken blood muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be productive of theſe Symptoms. But here it will be proper firſt to point out the cauſes, by which ſuch a relaxation may be brought on.</p>
            <p>And here let it be remark'd, that whenever a Gland is in a ſtate of relaxation it will not duly perform its reſpective office.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that whatever ſtretches out an animal fibre beyond its due degree of diſtenſion, and keeps it for ſome time ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended, will weaken the contractive ſpring of that fibre.</p>
            <p>Now the Glands may be relax'd, or their contractive ſpring weakn'd, by ſeveral diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent means; as firſt, by being preſt upon with too great a quantity of fluids, and this may happen either from a ſtoppage of perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or from a defect of Secretion in one Gland, which may be occaſion'd by ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction form'd in the <hi>Secretory</hi> Ducts of that Gland, and is known to encreaſe the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in another; becauſe ſuch an obſtruction will in effect be the ſame as an actual increaſe of the fluids; a conſequence of which will be encreas'd Secretions. It may alſo happen from the Critical diſcharges of acute fevers lodging their malignity on theſe parts; and from exceſſes of every kind falling on theſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1021800200:16"/>parts; and here it may be obſerv'd, that ſuch exceſſes will chiefly affect thoſe parts, which are by conſtitution the weakeſt, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order produc'd will correſpond with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and office of that organical part, which is affected.</p>
            <p>The Glands may alſo be relax'd, and the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of the blood broke by <hi>Mercurial Salivations,</hi> by a long continu'd uſe of powerful <hi>Deobſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> Medicines, and the kidnies in particulr by an improper uſe of ſuch as are ſtil'd <hi>Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An habitual drinking of Spirituous liquors will alſo bring on the ſame ill effects, and may in ſome circumſtances be the cauſe of a <hi>Diabetes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to explain the reaſon of this. —</p>
            <p>It appears from ſeveral
<note n="a" place="bottom">Dr. Hale's Haemas. p. 124.</note> experiments, that all ſtrong liquors not only contract the ſmall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, but alſo coagulate the fluids, which are contain'd in them. A conſequence of theſe effects will be a ſtoppage of the <hi>Secretions,</hi> and if often produc'd, a relaxation of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of the Stomach, and Inteſtines; hence will ariſe a failure of digeſtion, and of courſe of nutrition. When theſe neceſſary offices
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1021800200:17"/>fail, the ſolids will ſoon become weak, and languid, and the blood poor and watry. The body then being brought to this deplorable ſtate by ſuch an abuſe of them; if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the prevailing weakneſs to be in the kidnies, which may happen to be the caſe either accidentally or conſtitutionally, it is eaſy to conceive, that a <hi>Diabetes</hi> will come on. <hi>Opiates</hi> are known to act in the ſame manner, and therefore will produce like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>As the kidnies then may be relax'd by any preternatural preſſure, ſo it is eaſy to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, how a long ſuppreſſion of Urine, (be the cauſe of that ſuppreſſion what it will,) ſhould be productive of this diſorder. Dr.
<note n="a" place="bottom">Lib. 2. obs. 3.</note>

            <p>But to proceed — As a ſtone in the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by its great preſſure or irritation will bring on a relaxation of its fibres, ſo it may be the cauſe of this diſtemper.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> complaints have ſometimes been the Forerunners of this diſeaſe. The reaſon of this may eaſily be accounted for; becauſe as ſuch diſorders generally proceed from a weakneſs of the Solids, ſo by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the predominant weakneſs to be in the kidnies, this diſorder will neceſſarily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The kidnies and their Secretory Ducts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relax'd (be the cauſe of that relaxation what it will) a general debility of body will come on. Such is the cloſe dependance that the ſeveral organical parts of the humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bear to each other, that if any one be in a diſeaſed ſtate the others will be affected by it. Every part of this complicated Machine muſt regularly diſcharge its reſpective office in order to preſerve the harmony or health of the whole. In ſuch a ſtate of the body then as this, there can neither be a due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of the ſeveral parts of the blood, nor a proper aſſimilation of the <hi>Ingeſta.</hi> The conſequences of which will be juſt now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd.</p>

            <p>Having then enumerated the ſeveral cauſes by which the kidneys may be relax'd, and the craſis of the blood broke; we proceed to ſhew how ſuch a ſtate of the body muſt neceſſarily bring on a <hi>Diabetes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I ſhall beg leave to mention one diſorder, which ſeems to be in moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects <hi>analogous</hi> to this, and that is, a lacteal <hi>Diabetes.</hi> The learned and judicious Dr.
<note n="a" place="bottom">Boerhaave's Acad. Lect. V. 3. p. 143.</note> 
               <hi>Boerhaave</hi> gives us an inſtance of ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. <q>"There was, he ſays, a certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who dwelt at the City of <hi>Dort,</hi> who bore and ſuckled Children for twelve years ſucceſſively; but at length ſhe fell into a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteal <hi>Diabetes,</hi> in which all the nouriſhment that was taken ran through her Breaſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuction, under the appearance of milk, inſomuch that if ſhe drank a pint of ale there was almoſt the like quantity of milk evacuated from her Breaſts."</q>
            </p>
            <p>This inſtance then beautifully illuſtrates, and ſtrongly confirms the Theory laid down.</p>
            <p>But to proceed — The firſt Symptom, that I ſhall take notice of, by which a Perſon is known to labour under a <hi>Diabetes</hi> is the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and frequent diſcharge of pale colour'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1021800200:22"/>Urine. That this is an effect neceſſarily ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from ſuch a ſtate of the body will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear from a little conſideration. The <hi>Secretory</hi> Ducts of the kidnies being in this relax'd morbid ſtate, they will readily admit thoſe humours, which in a natural ſtate by reaſon of the compactneſs of their texture, they would by no means give admittance to; and conſequently the diſcharge muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably great. The little ſtay the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted humours make in the body will be the cauſe of their undergoing but a little change as to their colour and rancidity: Seeing that the colour and rancid ſmell of the Urine, when evacuated in a healthy ſtate of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, are owing moſt probably to its long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in it; for by ſuch a retention its oily parts become putrid, and will of courſe put on a different complexion. <hi>Diabetical</hi> Urine then is ſomewhat of a Chylous nature, and as all the <hi>nutritious</hi> juices are of a tenacious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcid diſpoſition, ſo they readily coagulate, when expos'd to the Atmoſphere; and to this ſeems to be owing the reaſon of its ropy conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</p>
            <p>That the quantity evacuated ſhould exceed in proportion the quantity of liquors taken in, appears from what has been already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1021800200:23"/>for in this weakn'd ſtate of the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and broken condition of the blood, a great portion of thoſe juices, which ſhould be retain'd in the body for its nouriſhment, will be admitted to paſs through the kidnies, and of courſe be thrown out of it, as tho' excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious; to which may be added the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual increaſe of fluids ariſing from a general waſte of the Solids, which the kidnies being now enlarg'd will greedily receive. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then, that the quantity evacuated ſhould exceed in proportion the quantity of liquors taken in. A neceſſary conſequence of ſuch a diſcharge, (and becauſe in ſuch circumſtances the important office of Nutrition is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſuſpended,) will be loſs of fleſh, and a great waſte of the body, which is always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, when this diſorder is far advanc'd, and the Patient almoſt brought by it to a period of his days; and it frequently happens in this laſt ſtage of it that even ſolid pieces of fleſh are brought away with the Urine.</p>
            <p>The ſenſe of weakneſs about the Loyns muſt be owing partly to this relaxation of the kidnies, and partly to the evacuation made; for in all drains whatever thoſe parts of the body ſuſtain the greateſt loſs of fluids, which are neareſt to that part, from which the drain
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1021800200:24"/>is made, and will conſequently be ſenſible of a proportionably greater weakneſs. The ſame complaint is made in other fluxes, in a <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhaea</hi> by Men, and the <hi>fluor albus</hi> by Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and the reaſon of it in both caſes is the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Symptom that comes next to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for is the ſweetneſs of the Urine.</p>
            <p>As a different configuration of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the ſame body is well known to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs on the nervous <hi>Papillae</hi> of the Tongue different ſenſations; We conclude, and I think, very reaſonably, that the difference of the taſtes of bodies is owing to ſome different tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their particles; but, as I apprehend, it is no very eaſy matter to determine <hi>abſolutely</hi> what particular diſpoſition or combination of the ſeveral parts, of which all bodies are known to conſiſt, is neceſſary to make a body either <hi>ſweet</hi> or <hi>bitter;</hi> ſo till this can be aſcertain'd, we muſt be contented with this general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſweetneſs of diabetical Urine; that it is owing to ſome different texture of its ſeveral heterogeneous parts.</p>
            <p>Animal ſubſtances when putrefied give a faetid taſte, and the reaſon of this is aſcrib'd not only to their natural diſpoſition to give ſuch a taſte; but alſo to ſome different mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1021800200:25"/>of their parts acquir'd in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Putrefaction. <hi>Chemiſtry</hi> teaches us, that all bodies are compos'd of the ſame E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, <hi>Fire, Air, Water, Earth, Salt,</hi> and <hi>Oil;</hi> and therefore the variety of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſmell, taſte, and the like, muſt be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing primarily to ſome different diſpoſition of theſe Elements. We learn indeed from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that the nearer the parts of any body approach to a ſphaerical diſpoſition; the more mild and ſoft is the taſte of that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and that the farther they recede from ſuch a diſpoſition, the more acrid, and rough is the ſenſation, that ſuch bodies excite in us.</p>
            <p>That the taſtes of bodies do depend upon a different combination of their particles is a truth not to be diſputed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mercury</hi> in its ſphaerical figure is both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and taſtleſs, but when ſublim'd, it loſes its ſphaericity, and becomes acrid, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive, and poiſonous.</p>
            <p>An intire maſs of
<note n="a" place="bottom">See Mr. Boyle's Mechanical production of taſtes.</note> 
               <hi>Silver</hi> is inſipid, but by being diſſolv'd in <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> and ſhooting into Chryſtalls, it becomes bitter; <hi>Lead</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>A mixture of Spirit of Nitre, and rectified Spirit of Wine, the former highly corroſive, the latter very pungent, compoſes a body of an agreeable taſte.</p>
            <p>It appears then from experiments, that a different diſpoſition of the particles of bodies is the cauſe of that variety of taſtes, which is obſervable in bodies, and that it will alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite taſtes in thoſe bodies, which before were inſipid.</p>
            <p>We have hitherto accounted for the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diabetical Urine, upon no other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, than the original and primary cauſe of the difference of the taſtes of natural bodies in general; and into this indeed muſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accounts of it be at laſt reſolv'd: For could we know the various mixtures the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine may poſſibly undergoe in this ſtate of the body; yet we ſhould ſtill be at a loſs to give a reaſon for the alterations ariſing from ſuch mixtures.</p>
            <p>But to be more particular — It is known from obſervation, that the <hi>Ingeſta</hi> of what kind ſoever, after they have been prepar'd and elaborated fine enough by the digeſtive
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1021800200:27"/>organs to enter the <hi>Lacteals,</hi> are
<note n="a" place="bottom">v. Boerhaave's Acad. Lect. V. 2. p. 48.</note> ſweet to the taſte. The milk, which the Infant ſucks from the Breaſts of the Mother, is ſweet; and even the blood itſelf is <hi>relatively</hi> ſweet. It has been already obſerv'd that a long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the humours in the body is the ſole cauſe of the rancidity of them; and it has been alſo ſhewn that in a <hi>Diabetes,</hi> part of thoſe juices, which ſhould be retain'd in the body for its nutrition, is thrown out of it, as tho' excrementitious; ſo that the Urine in this diſeaſe is ſomewhat of a Chylous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and as the ſalt of Chyle or milk is ſweet, ſo the taſte of the Urine muſt alſo be ſweet; ſeeing that it has not been long enough cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating in the Veſſels to acquire any degree either of rankneſs or Acrimony. This Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous nature then of the Urine with a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent combination of its ſeveral parts will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily account for its remarkable ſweetneſs.</p>
            <p>That a <hi>Diabetes</hi> ſhould be attended with a hectick fever will appear evident from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the known cauſes of it. But it would be foreign to my purpoſe to run through all the cauſes, by which this kind of fever is produc'd, and to ſhew how neceſſarily a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chectical
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1021800200:28"/>body muſt produce a Hectick. A very common cauſe of it however is an acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in the blood, whether it be of the <hi>acid</hi> or <hi>alkaline</hi> kind, which by irritating and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Solids will accelerate the circulation of the blood, in the accelerated courſe of which is fixt the Idea of a ſever. The ſame irritation will happen from an <hi>abſorption of Pus</hi> in caſe of an inward Ulcer. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no there is ſuch an <hi>abſorption of Pus</hi> is at preſent a diſputed point: Tho', I think, there is all the reaſon, that can be deſir'd, to reſolve it in the affirmative; and chiefly becauſe of that true <hi>purulent</hi> matter, with which the <hi>faeces</hi> in ulcerated caſes are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times known to be tinctur'd, even when there has been no Ulcer in theſe parts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore could not poſſibly have been evacuated by <hi>ſtool;</hi> had it not been firſt abſorb'd into the blood. That there are Veſſels in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body capable of ſuch <hi>abſorption</hi> is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by every one; That <hi>Peſtilential</hi> and other noxious <hi>efluvia</hi> are abſorb'd by them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the blood, is often verified by fatal experience; That the drops of blood, which guſh out from the rupture of a ſmall artery, are alſo abſorb'd into the maſs of blood, every day's experience proves. As it is clear
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1021800200:29"/>then beyond all poſſible doubt, that there is ſuch an abſorption of fluids into the blood, I can ſee no reaſon, why the <hi>Pus,</hi> which is diſcharg'd from an Ulcer, may not alſo be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorb'd.</p>
            <p>That a great loſs of blood will alſo bring on a Hectick, whether occaſion'd by <hi>Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoidal,</hi> or <hi>Dyſenterical</hi> fluxes, too plentiful <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> or the like, appears from obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and is confirm'd by experiment.</p>
            <p>The accurate and ingenious
<note n="a" place="bottom">Haemas. v. 2. Exper. 2. p. 12.</note> Dr. <hi>Hales</hi> obſerv'd, that the pulſe of a horſe, upon which he was going to make an experiment, <q>"beat forty ſtrokes in a minute, before he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd or tied down. But when the Glaſs tube was fixt to the left Crural Artery, it beat fixty five in a minute. And as the horſe grew fainter by the loſs of blood, the pulſe was more and more accelerated, ſo as to beat an hundred times or more in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute: Whence we ſee, that the pulſe is weak and quick, when the heart is ſupplied with little blood; which is the caſe in the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick fevers."</q>
            </p>
            <p>But to explain the reaſon of the hectick, when brought on by any great evacuation more fully.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1021800200:30"/>
            <p>It is well known, that the Velocity, with which all fluids move through all known Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, is reciprocal to the reſiſtance, which they meet with in their paſſage through ſuch Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. Now this reſiſtance among other cauſes of it will be increas'd or diminiſh'd in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Quantity of fluids contain'd in theſe Veſſels; for the greater the Quantity of fluids is contain'd for inſtance in thoſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Veſſels the arteries; the greater degree of force will be requir'd in the blood thrown out of the Heart to drive forward that alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the arteries; and there will alſo be in ſuch circumſtances a greater degree of fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; the Quantity of blood then being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd, theſe reſiſtances, which are known to retard its progreſſive motion, will be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably remov'd; and the motion of the blood then will now be more free, it will conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be more quick; and as a quick circulation will cauſe a quick pulſe; and as the pulſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated to be either ſtrong or weak in proportion to the greater or leſs diſtenſion of the artery, which depends upon the Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or denſity of the blood; ſo we may eaſily collect the reaſons from theſe known facts both of the weakneſs and quickneſs of the pulſe in Hectick Fevers; and <hi>how</hi> Preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1021800200:31"/>fluxes of any kind are neceſſarily produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of a Hectick. From a diminution of the fluids, or from a relaxation, or dilatation of the Glands, (in which circumſtances the Quantity of blood may be ſuppos'd to be diminiſh'd,) Dr. <hi>Cheyne</hi> in his <hi>new Theory</hi> of Fevers, has very ingeniouſly, and fully demonſtrated all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Hectick Fevers. Thus then we come to a reaſon of the Hectick in a <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betes;</hi> (viz.) the relaxation of the kidney, and the great evacuation made from it.</p>
            <p>The great thirſt, which is the laſt Symptom, that remains to be inſiſted upon, is owing partly to this inward fever, and partly to the great drain; for in ſuch a caſe the <hi>fauces</hi> will become dry and rough; the dryneſs and roughneſs of which will excite in us that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy ſenſation, which we call, Thirſt.</p>
            <p>I have now gone through what I intended to inſiſt upon, and hope, that the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made, tho' rudely digeſted, will ſerve to throw ſome light into the nature of this diſorder, and into the reaſons of the ſeveral <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of it. The Symptoms indeed ſeem to flow neceſſarily from the cauſes aſſign'd, which is an argument in their favour.</p>
            <p>But as the cure of a diſeaſe is of far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er concern to mankind, than the <hi>Rationale</hi> of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1021800200:32"/>it; tho' this ſhould be firſt known to the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Phyſician, that he may the more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceed to the removal of it; it may not be improper briefly to point out the Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of cure, which ariſe from the account given of it. But I ſhall content myſelf by obſerving in general, that Medicines of a mild, Balſamick, compacting nature, ſeem to claim the firſt place: As they will be well adapted to agglutinate the fluids, and will moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrengthen the weakn'd part. It is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever often found neceſſary to make uſe of Medicines of a more aſtringent nature. If the weakneſs or relaxation of the kidney ariſes from an acrimony in the blood, that acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is firſt to be corrected by proper reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The greateſt regard ſhould be had in the cure of this, as well as all other Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſeaſes to a proper <hi>Diet,</hi> which in this caſe ſhould undoubtedly be that of the <hi>incraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſating</hi> kind. A good <hi>Regimen</hi> of the Non-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals has been known to eradicate the moſt ſtubborn diſtempers, when Medicines of great efficacy have fail'd: Nor is this at all ſtrange; for ſeeing that moſt Chronical diſorders are owing to ſome bad diſpoſition of the blood, and the blood is made from what is taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body by way of food; a proper Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1021800200:33"/>in ſuch caſes muſt ſurely be the beſt, as well as the moſt natural <hi>Alterative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Water is of remarkable ſervice in this diſorder, Experience abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifies. But the reaſon of its operation does not ſeem to be clearly underſtood; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I take upon me to give any account of it; ſeeing that this is to be learnt only from knowing its Ingredients; and theſe are to be found out only by Chemical experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are beſt made on the ſpot: And the late accurate <hi>Enquirer</hi> into its Medicinal Virtues intends to inſiſt upon this point in the remaining part of his work. But as it is well known to cool the body, to thicken broken fluids, and to ſtrengthen in ſome degree; ſo it ſeems to be well calculated to anſwer all the Intentions of <hi>Cure</hi> in this diſorder.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only offer one word more in order to prevent any objection, that may poſſibly be rais'd to this manner of enquiring into the nature of the diſeaſes of the humane body.</p>
            <p>And here let it be remember'd, that the firſt improvement, which the Science of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine receiv'd, was made by Reaſoning upon Mathematical Principles. This then pav'd the way for thoſe great diſcoveries, which have lately been made in the nature of the <hi>Animal
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1021800200:34"/>Oeconomy</hi> by the aſſiſtance of Mechanical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.
<q>"<note n="a" place="bottom">Dr. Mead's preface to his book on Poiſons.</note> Nor could malice itſelf (as Dr. <hi>Mead</hi> expreſſes himſelf on the like occaſion) deny this, were not ignorance in confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with it, which will ſecure any one from being benefitted by the moſt uſeful Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration."</q> And that this is not only the moſt likely, but is without all poſſible doubt, the only certain method of improving Phyſical Knowledge, is evident from the ſtructure of the humane body. For it appears by Anatomy to conſiſt of Solids and Fluids, both which are ſubject to the known Laws of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and therefore the various diſorders, to which this wonderful Fabric is hourly liable, can no way be more rationally accounted for, than by Mechanical Reaſonings, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of theſe Laws to ſuch alterations, as are obſervable in it.</p>
            <p>This method then of enquiring into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the diſeaſes of the humane body, when it can be made uſe of, is the only certain one; I ſay, when it can be made uſe of; for there are ſome diſorders of ſo complicated a nature, others again of ſo peculiar a one, that they are not capable of being conſider'd in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1021800200:35"/>Light; or of being reduc'd to any known Principles, whereon to found our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. All that can poſſibly be done in ſuch unhappy caſes is to be effected by a careful obſervation of the Symptoms produc'd, by a diligent attention to the efforts, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture endeavours to make for her own relief, and by aſſiſting her in the ſtruggle by a due application of proper Remedies.</p>
            <p>
               <q>"It is paſt doubt with me, ſays
<note n="a" place="bottom">In his account of the Non-Naturals p. 168.</note> Dr. <hi>Waine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> whatever ſome Phyſicians ſay againſt <hi>Theory,</hi> which they don't underſtand, that 'tis not only uſeful, but a neceſſary Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a good Phyſician.
