            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MRS. WILLOUGHBY was, at the age of
thirty, left a widow, with a ſon and a
daughter, of whom ſhe was extremely fond,
and to whoſe education ſhe entirely devoted
herſelf. George Willoughby, herſon, had
been placed at Eton by his father, but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by a private tutor, a man of ſenſe
and learning, who was diſtantly related to
their family. When he was about thirteen,
a fever, from which he narrowly eſcaped,
ſo injured his conſtitution, that his mother
was directed by his phyſicians to take him
to the South of Europe. Thither ſhe and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0206900201:4"/>
her daughter, with Mr. Everard, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him. A few months completely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
his health; and they then went all
together to Geneva; where, after a ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence,
ſhe left her ſon to purſue his ſtudies
under the care of Mr. Everard; and with
her daughter Matilda, then near eight years
old, ſhe fixed herſelf for ſome time at
Hieres, on the coaſt of Provence; a town
with whoſe beauty ſhe had been much
ſtruck four or five years before, when, to
divert her concern for the loſs of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
ſhe had made a tour of ſome months
through France and Italy.</p>
            <p>Matilda was placed in a convent, for the
purpoſes of inſtruction; and there ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the playfellow of a little girl almoſt
three years younger, who was known among
the Nuns by the name of <hi>la petite Celeſtine.</hi>
The fondneſs which ſoon ſubſiſted between
her and Matilda introduced her of courſe to
Mrs. Willoughby, who was at firſt ſight
charmed with her beauty, and after a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terviews,
ſo delighted with her infantine ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0206900201:5"/>
that ſhe became as anxious to ſee her
every day as ſhe was to ſee her own child.
Her countenance, with that blooming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy
which the French diſtinguiſh by call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it "<hi>le vrai teint Anglois,</hi>" had all that
animation which is more uſually found
among the natives of the ſouth of Europe;
yet this ſpirited expreſſion often melted
into ſoftneſs ſo inſinuating, that it was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to ſay whether penſive tenderneſs or
ſparkling vivacity was the moſt predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
or whether it was the lovelineſs of
her little form and face, or the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her manners, which made her ſo
very attractive, that the very ſervants who
ſaw her with Matilda became ſo fond of
her, as never to carry her back to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
after a viſit to their lady, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance
and regret.</p>
            <p>The Nuns, however, with whom ſhe
lived, ſeemed, either from ſeeing her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,
or for want of taſte, to be quite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
of perfections which won every
other heart. They treated her ſometimes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0206900201:6"/>
with harſhneſs, and always with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
ſo that to be with Mrs. Willoughby
ſoon became the greateſt happineſs the little
Celeſtina could enjoy. Mrs. Willoughby
found an equal pleaſure in returning her
affection; and was ſometimes moved even
to tears, when happening to careſs Matilda,
the other amiable child would approach as
if to ſhare her tenderneſs, take her hand,
look innocently in her face, and ſay with a
ſigh, "<hi>Helas! que n'ai je auſſi une Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">"Alas! why have not I a Mama too!"</note>!"</p>
            <p>Theſe artleſs expreſſions, and the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with which the ſiſterhood treated their
infant penſioner, raiſed in Mrs. Willoughby
a great deſire to know to whom the child
belonged: but every attempt to gain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
was at firſt repreſſed by ſo much
reſerve, that ſhe almoſt deſpaired of being
gratified. At length however ſhe received
a hint, that by the ſkilful application of
means equally potent in Courts or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
ſhe might learn all the Nuns knew;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0206900201:7"/>
and in conſequence of purſuing this hint,
ſhe was informed, that the laſt Superior of
the houſe, who had been dead two years,
had received Celeſtina into it when only a
few months old, as a child whoſe birth it
was of the utmoſt conſequence to conceal:
that only the Superior herſelf, and her
Confeſſor, who was alſo dead, had ever
known to whom ſhe belonged; every trace
of which ſecret had by them been ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
obliterated, that after the deceaſe of
both, every attempt at diſcovery had been
ineffectual. It was believed that a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
ſum of money had been received
as the price of ſecreſy, and as a proviſion
for the child; but it had never been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to account, or any part of it appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to the uſe of the community in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
who now conſequently murmured at
the neceſſity they were under, as they ſaid,
<hi>par charité, et pour l'amour de Dieu,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Through charity, and for the love of God.</note> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<hi>la petite Celeſtine</hi> for life: but they added,
that as ſoon as ſhe was old enough to take
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0206900201:8"/>
the vows, ſhe muſt become a Nun, and fill
one of the inferior offices of the convent,
ſince ſhe had no friends or money to pay
for being on a higher footing.</p>
            <p>The pity excited by this account, added
to the ſenſibility with which, infant as ſhe
was, ſhe felt her own ſituation; her tender
attachment to her benefactreſs, and to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda,
and the ſenſe and ſweetneſs viſible in
all ſhe ſaid and did, procured for her, in the
tender and generous heart of Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
an intereſt little ſhort of what ſhe
felt for Matilda herſelf. Every hour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
this intereſt; till after a ſtay of
eighteen months at Hieres, during which
ſhe had ſeen her almoſt every day, ſhe
found, in reflecting on her departure, that
ſhe ſhould be really unhappy the reſt of
her life, if ſhe returned to England, and
left this amiable child to a fate ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
in itſelf, and ſo unworthy of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of perfection given by her infancy.
Having once entertained the idea of taking
her to England, it ſoon became too pleaſing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0206900201:9"/>
to be relinquiſhed. There were however
great difficulties in the way. Though the
community complained of Celeſtina as a
burthen to them, they made, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
a point of conſcience, not to part
with her to an heretic; and the more ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
Mrs. Willoughby became, the more
they declaimed againſt the ſin it would be,
to hazard the ſoul of <hi>la petite Celeſtine</hi> for
the ſake of any worldly advantage. While
the matter was yet in debate, George Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
and Mr. Everard, who had been
ſent for that the whole family might return
to England together, arrived; and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
finding how much Mrs. Willoughby
deſired to become the ſole protectreſs of
the little orphan, prevailed with Father
Angelo, the preſent confeſſor, to remove
at once all the ſcruples he had been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
in raiſing: in a word, Mr. Everard
uſed the argument to which Monks, in
deſpite of their profeſſions of poverty, are
not more inſenſible than the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
and Mrs. Willoughby having left a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0206900201:10"/>
certificate of her having taken Celeſtina
out of the convent, a promiſe to educate
her without influencing her to change her
religion, and to provide for her, together
with a direction where ſhe might, in caſe
of enquiry, be found, was permitted to
carry with her, from Hieres, the lovely
little French girl, who was from that hour
put on an equal footing with her own
daughter, and whom ſhe ſeemed as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
to love.</p>
            <p>After an abſence of between three and
four years, Mrs. Willoughby and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
returned to England; where to all her
friends, who were generally ſtruck with the
beauty and elegance of her adopted child,
ſhe related, without reſerve, the little hiſtory
of their accidental attachment.</p>
            <p>George Willoughby, now in his ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
year, was ſent to Cambridge: his
tutor retired to a ſmall living, which had
fallen near his eſtate in the Weſt of
England, ſince his abſence, and to which
his mother, as patroneſs in his minority,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0206900201:11"/>
had preſented this excellent and amiable
man.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Willoughby uſually paſſed the
winters in London; where maſters of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic,
drawing, dancing, and languages, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
her two girls, for ſo ſhe equally
termed Matilda and her little friend:—their
ſummers were divided between pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
places and Alſtone (or Alveſtone, as it
was ſpelt), an eſtate between Sidmouth
and Exeter, of which her huſband had
been ſo fond, that he had hurt his fortune
by the large ſums he had expended on its
improvement. This attachment George
ſeemed to inherit; and in compliment to
him, his mother always paſſed the vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
there: Willoughby himſelf having
no pleaſure ſo great as in talking and
thinking of the happineſs he ſhould enjoy,
when he ſhould become maſter of Alſtone,
and ſee his mother and ſiſter, of whom he
was extremely fond, ſettled there with him
for the greateſt part of every year. Mrs.
Willoughby, whoſe love for him might
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0206900201:12"/>
have been ſaid to border on weakneſs, if it
had been poſſible to diſcover any exceſs in
the attachment of a mother to a ſon ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly
deſerving, had always encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
the inclination he had from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
betrayed for this his paternal ſeat:
though his little projects often gave her
pain; for ſhe knew, what ſhe had with
more tenderneſs than prudence ſtudiouſly
concealed from him, that his father's
affairs were at his death ſo much embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed,
as to render it doubtful whether a
minority of near thirteen years would ſo far
clear his eſtates, as to enable him at the
end of that period to reſide in this favourite
place, with the ſplendour and hoſpitality
for which his anceſtors had for centuries
been eminent. The laſt Mr. Willoughby
had indeed continued the ſame line of
conduct in the country; but his manner of
living in town had been quite unlike that
of his prudent and plainer anceſtors; who
had but juſt recovered his eſtate, when it
was tranſmitted to him, from the injuries it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0206900201:13"/>
had received by their adherence to Charles
the Firſt; during whoſe unfortunate reign,
they had ſold ſome part of their extenſive
poſſeſſions, and had been plundered of
more. His grandfather and great-grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
had nearly retrieved the whole of
the eſtate round Alverſtone, where they
piqued, themſelves on loſing none of the
family conſequence; but the manners of
the times in which he lived, and a diſpoſition
extremely gay and volatile, had led
the laſt poſſeſſor into expences, which, if
they did not oblige him to ſell, had obliged
him to mortgage great part of this, as well
as all his other eſtates; and being charged
at his death with twelve hundred a year to
his widow, and the intereſt of ten thouſand
pounds given to his daughter, they ſlowly
and with difficulty produced, under the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of very careful executors, little
more than ſufficient to pay ſuch charges,
and the intereſt of the money for which
they were mortgaged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0206900201:14"/>
Mrs. Willoughby however was unwilling
to interrupt the felicity of her ſon's happieſt
hours, by repreſenting to him a dreary
proſpect of the future; eſpecially as ſhe
thought that future might, as it advanced,
become brighter; and that it was poſſible
all his gay viſions might be realized. He
had a great uncle, far advanced in life, and
very rich, who, though the late Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
had diſobliged him, might, ſhe
thought, through mere family pride, give
to the ſon, what he had often declared the
father ſhould never poſſeſs. Her brother,
Lord Caſtlenorth, was the laſt male of his
illuſtrious race: he had only a daughter;
and an increaſe of his family becoming
every day more improbable, he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
with his ſiſter, even while George
(who was younger than his daughter) was
yet a child, how the family might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
by a union of its two remaining
branches.</p>
            <p>The good ſenſe of Mrs. Willoughby
had not entirely ſaved her from family
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0206900201:15"/>
pride; and this project, which the ſituation
of her ſon's fortune rendered doubly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable,
had by degrees taken ſuch poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of her mind, that nothing would have
made her more unhappy, than ſuſpecting
it might not take effect. After her return
with her family from France, ſhe had an
interview with her brother, Lord Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north,
who was then in England (though
his health occaſioned him for the moſt part
to reſide abroad), and it was then agreed
with him, or rather with Lady Caſtlenorth,
whoſe will was his law, that if the young
people liked each other, of which they
hardly ſuffered themſelves to doubt, the
match ſhould take place as ſoon as young
Willoughby became of age, who was then
to aſſume the name of Fitz-Hayman, and
in whoſe favour, when united with the ſole
heireſs of the family, there was little doubt
of procuring the ſucceſſion to the title.
Willoughby, who was yet ignorant of this
propoſed arrangement, had accompanied
his mother in her viſit: but far from feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0206900201:16"/>
any partiality for his couſin, he had
hardly taken any notice of her, and had
paſſed all thoſe hours when common civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
did not oblige him to attend the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
in wandering with his tutor over the
extenſive domain belonging to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
magnificent ſeat. He ſeemed indeed
much more ſenſible of the charms of Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north,
which was the name of his uncle's
houſe, from whence the title was derived,
than pleaſed with either its preſent or
its future poſſeſſor. Mr. Everard, who
anxiouſly watched every emotion of his
mind, ſaw this, and he ſaw too that his
pupil was of a temper which would ill bear
to be dictated to in a point ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
with his own happineſs. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
therefore, with ſome difficulty, on
Mrs. Willoughby, not to explain her views
till nearer the period when ſhe meant they
ſhould be perfected; and they left Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north
without Willoughby's having the
ſmalleſt ſuſpicion of them, or carrying
away any other idea of his couſin, than that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0206900201:17"/>
ſhe was a tall, fat, formal brown girl, whom
he ſoon forgot and never deſired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.
His uncle's complaints and
quack medicines—his long lectures on ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy
and heraldry—had tired him; and
Lady Caſtlenorth's dictatorial manners of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
and diſguſted him. He told Mr.
Everard, that the only hour in which he
had felt any pleaſure during his abode at
their houſe, was that in which his mother
fixed the time of departing for her own.
Thither he returned with redoubled de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
after the reſtraint he had felt himſelf
under at Caſtlenorth; for there lay all
his plans of future felicity, and there were
Matilda and Celeſtina, his two ſiſters, as he
always called them, who ſeemed equally
dear to him.</p>
            <p>In a few months he went to Cambridge;
and Mr. Everard, who afterwards ſaw him
only for a few days in the year, had no
longer the ſame opportunities of judging
of his ſentiments. He ſtill however had
intereſt enough with Mrs. Willoughby, to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0206900201:18"/>
prevail on her to delay any intimation of
the intended alliance. Lord Caſtlenorth,
his lady, and daughter, were now in Italy,
and were to remain there till within ſix
months of the time fixed among themſelves
for the marriage of the latter: but above a
twelvemonth before the arrival of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
period, Mr. Everard died. Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
and her family loſt in him the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſt
friend and moſt capable monitor: a
loſs which greatly affected Willoughby, as
well as his mother, who ſent for her ſon
from Cambridge on that melancholy occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Thither he had hardly returned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the uncle of his father, on whom he
had great dependance, and who had not
long before taken him into his favour, and
promiſed to make him his heir, died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having altered his will, and endowed
an hoſpital with the eſtate which he had
really meant to give his nephew, had not
death overtaken him before he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
his habitual indolence, aggravated by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0206900201:19"/>
the feebleneſs and imbecility of eighty-ſeven.</p>
            <p>This diſappointment was ſeverely felt by
Mrs. Willoughby, who apprehended that
not only the immediate but the contingent
intereſt of her ſon might be deeply affected
by it: ſhe doubted whether it would not
change the intentions of her brother in his
favor; but after ſome weeks of uneaſy
ſuſpenſe, ſhe received aſſurances from
Italy that thoſe his intentions and wiſhes
were ſtill the ſame.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Willoughby, though re-aſſured in
this reſpect, was ſtill in very low ſpirits,
and felt every hour, with encreaſing ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
the loſs ſhe had ſuſtained in ſuch a
friend as Mr. Everard, whom ſhe lamented
indeed publicly, but ſtill more bitterly in
private. Her conſtitution, naturally very
delicate, began to decline under the ſorrow
which oppreſſed her. Matilda, then about
ſixteen, was the only perſon about her who
ſeemed inſenſible of the alteration which
now made a ſlow but very evident pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0206900201:20"/>
in her looks and manner. Her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
was ſtill pleaſing and intereſting,
but very languid; her eyes had loſt their
fire; and ſhe grew very thin. Her amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
manners remained; but all her viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in converſation was fled. She no
longer enjoyed ſociety, of which ſhe had
been ſo fond: but ſhe ſtill went into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
becauſe Matilda, now of an age to
enter into all the gaieties of high life, did
indeed engage in them with an avidity
which her mother was too indulgent to
repreſs, though ſhe could not approve it.
Sometimes however ſhe ſuffered ſo much
from crouded rooms and late hours, that
though ſhe did not even then complain,
her phyſicians inſiſted on her forbearing
ſo continually to hazard-her health. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda,
who was very uneaſy if long kept
from company, was then put under the
care of ſome of her mother's friends, and
the taſk of attending on her beloved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactreſs
fell entirely to the lot of Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,
who was never ſo happy as when
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0206900201:21"/>
employed in it, and who now having juſt
completed her fourteenth year, ſurpaſſed,
in the perfections both of perſon and mind,
all that Mrs. Willoughby, partial as ſhe
had always been to her, had ever ſuppoſed
ſhe would attain.</p>
            <p>Above two years paſſed away: Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
purſuing very regularly his ſtudies
at Cambridge; Matilda purſuing as regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
every amuſement that offered itſelf;
and Celeſtina, careleſs of all that has uſually
attractions for youth, devoting her whole
time and thoughts to Mrs. Willoughby,
who without ſaying any thing of what ſhe
felt to be inevitable, was gradually ſinking
into the grave.</p>
            <p>This conviction made her determine to
diſcloſe to her ſon, when ſhe next ſaw
him, her purpoſe in regard to Miſs Fitz-Hayman;
but it was a reſolution ſhe could
not bring herſelf to make, without infinite
regret; for in giving her reaſons for wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this alliance, it was neceſſary for her
to open to him the real ſtate of his fortune;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0206900201:22"/>
of which her tenderneſs, in this inſtance
perhaps injudicious, had hitherto kept him
in ignorance. The longer this affectionate
mother thought of the pain ſhe ſhould
thus inflict on her ſon, the leſs ſhe found
herſelf able to undertake it: ſhe therefore
determined that Mr. Dawſon, who had
been employed many years by his father
as ſteward and manager of the eſtates,
ſhould, under pretence of conſulting him
on his affairs, now that he was of an age
to direct in them, diſcloſe to him their
real ſituation. For this purpoſe he went
to Cambridge; and there this unpleaſant
explanation was made to Willoughby: who
learned, that his father, towards the latter
end of his life, had mortgaged above a
third of his property for nearly its value;
that-what remained was not only encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
by heavy debts, which were to be
diſcharged out of it, but had a charge of
twelve hundred a year, his mother's jointure,
and was to pay his ſiſter ten thouſand
pounds, with intereſt till ſhe married—
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0206900201:23"/>
burthens which ſo diminiſhed the income,
as to make it impoſſible to ſave any thing
during his minority, and left him no proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of ever enjoying his paternal eſtate
unembarraſſed, but by an opulent mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
Though Mr. Dawſon had, with
as much caution and tenderneſs as poſſible,
opened to Willoughby the real condition
of his affairs, the young man, of warm
paſſions and keen feelings, could not hear
ſuch a mortifying account but with the
extremeſt pain and humiliation. Unable
to remain tranquilly at Cambridge, he
immediately ſet out for London, and
aſked of his mother a farther explanation;
as if unwilling to receive from any hand
but her's a blow ſo cruel, which ſeemed to
deſtroy for ever all his favourite hopes.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Willoughby had ever been ſo far
from ſuſpecting that her ſon loved money,
that a tendency to careleſneſs in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
had ſometimes alarmed her: ſhe was
therefore extremely ſurprized at the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his enquiries, and the evident
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0206900201:24"/>
anxiety and concern he expreſſed at his
diſappointment. But having convinced
him that all he had heard was but too true,
and recovered from the agitation into
which the neceſſity of giving him ſo much
pain had thrown her, ſhe ſeized the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
while his mind ſeemed to turn
with uneaſy ſolicitude towards the means
of redeeming his patrimony, to ſuggeſt to
him the plan ſhe had ſo long conſidered as
infallible—"My dear George," ſaid ſhe,
"there is one way by which all this may
be repaired; and your eſtāte, devolving
to you from a long line of anceſtors, of
whom any man might be proud, may not
only be repaired but encreaſed, by an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
of which an ambitious man may be
ſtill prouder. My brother, Lord Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north,
is the laſt male of a line diſtinguiſhed
ſince the conqueſt; your couſin, his only
daughter, will inherit his fortune; the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
die with him. It is equally natural
therefore for him and for me, to wiſh that
you, my ſon, in becoming the huſband
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0206900201:25"/>
of my niece, may poſſeſs the eſtates
and honours of my family, which on ſuch
a union would be eaſily obtained; and
that in you may be revived, or rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated,
the family of Fitz-Hayman. I
did not intend to have named this to you
till your farther acquaintance with your
couſin, who returns to England in the
courſe of the next ſummer, ſhould have
made it on your part a meaſure of incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
for from all the accounts I have
had of her, ſhe is very amiable and highly
accompliſhed: but my uncertain health,
and the near approach of that period when
you become maſter of yourſelf, have at
length determined me to tell you my
thoughts in a matter, on which the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity
of your future life depends. I need
not ſay, George, that ſeeing it in that light,
there is nothing in this world ſo near my
heart as its completion."</p>
            <p>Willoughby, whoſe mind was contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the various emotions this diſcourſe
of his mother's had raiſed, remained ſilent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0206900201:26"/>
and confuſed. He changed colour; he
ſighed, as if to throw off the unexpected
preſſure on his heart; and Mrs. Willoughby,
who ſaw with concern that he entered not
into the project with the alacrity ſhe had
expected, began again to deſcribe to him
not only the numerous advantages which
muſt follow the marriage, but to repeat all
ſhe had heard, and more that ſhe had ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
of the perfections of Miſs Fitz-Hayman.</p>
            <p>Willoughby however appeared rather to
be muſing than attending to almoſt the
only converſation from his mother that he
had ever thought tedious. When ſhe
ſeemed to have exhauſted the ſubject, he
ſtill pauſed a moment; then taking his
hand from his forehead, he aſked his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—whether
ſhe thought Miſs Fitz-Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
as lovely as Celeſtina?</p>
            <p>"As lovely as Celeſtina!" replied Mrs.
Willoughby in great and apparently pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſurprize—"How came Celeſtina to
occur to you?"</p>
            <p>"Nay," anſwered her ſon, attempting
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0206900201:27"/>
to appear indifferent—I know not how,
unleſs becauſe ſhe is the prettieſt young
woman I have lately ſeen."</p>
            <p>"Surely you do not think of Celeſtina,"
reaſſumed Mrs. Willoughby with encreaſed
emotion—"ſurely you are not imprudent
enough to entertain an idea of her other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than as a ſiſter. There are objections—inſuperable
objections. For God's ſake,
George, let me be aſſured that you will
never again think of her."</p>
            <p>"Dear Madam," returned Willoughby
with ſome quickneſs, "that is really more
than I can promiſe. How is it poſſible for
me to aſſure you, with any hope of my
being able to keep my word, that I will
not think of a beautiful and intereſting
object, which, whenever I am with you,
is continually before my eyes."</p>
            <p>"Well then," ſaid his mother with yet
more chagrin, "ſince it is ſo, you will
compel me to remove her where—"</p>
            <p>"Surely," cried the young man, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
interrupting her, "that would be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0206900201:28"/>
very cruel—very cruel as it would affect
Celeſtina, and very unneceſſary as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to me; for I ſhall now be very ſeldom
at home; and I can, without any danger
of breaking my word, aſſure you, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will ever make your ſon forget the
duty he owes you, or hazard giving you
pain. I am very ſorry I named Celeſtina,
ſince you ſeem ſo uneaſy at it. Think of
it no more I beſeech you; and continue
to love, as you uſed to do, my adopted
ſiſter, or I ſhall never forgive myſelf for
my inadvertence."</p>
            <p>Willoughby then, without ſtaying to talk
over farther the propoſed alliance with
Miſs Fitz-Hayman, hurried away; and
that he might avoid all farther converſation
with his mother, he ſtaid out to ſupper that
night, and immediately after breakfaſt the
following morning returned to Cambridge;
telling her, as he took leave, that it would
be time enough to talk over the buſineſs
ſhe had opened to him when the parties to
whom it related were in England, but that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0206900201:29"/>
ſhe might aſſure herſelf that <hi>her</hi> happineſs
was always nearer his heart than his own.</p>
            <p>This was the firſt time in his life that
the parted from Matilda and Celeſtina
without ſaluting them both. When break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
was over, and he had taken leave of
his mother, he kiſſed his ſiſter as uſual,
and was approaching Celeſtina, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
held out her hand to him, when
catching his mother's eye, who ſeemed to
look at him reproachingly, he bluſhed,
and only bowing and wiſhing Celeſtina her
health till he ſaw her again, he haſtened
to the door, and without venturing even
to look at her, as ſhe followed him thither
with his mother and ſiſter, he mounted his
horſe and diſappeared.</p>
            <p>Hurt cruelly at this behaviour, (which
from the very different judgment ſhe had
formed of it, had yet more alarmed his
mother,) Celeſtina could not repreſs the
tears which ſhe felt riſing to her eyes. Mrs.
Willoughby ſtood at the door till her ſon
turned into another ſtreet; and was then
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0206900201:30"/>
going to her own room, when Celeſtina,
from an emotion ſhe could not command,
caught her hand and burſt into tears: and
for the firſt time in her life, her benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
inſtead of ſoothing her, received her
mournful careſſes with repulſive coldneſs,
and almoſt without ſpeaking to her left
her. Matilda was as uſual engaged to a
morning concert, and had neither time nor
inclination to attend to the concern of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
or the diſpleaſure of her mother,
which indeed ſhe either did not ſee, or ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
reflect upon. Poor Celeſtina there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
who never ſuſpected the real ſource
of Willoughby's affected coldneſs, nor
could imagine why his mother, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
found pleaſure and comfort in her
company, ſhould now fly from her, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
ſhe had offended them both, and
paſſed the morning in tears. At dinner,
however, Mrs. Willoughby, as if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of her injuſtice, behaved to her with
even more than her accuſtomed tenderneſs.
After they had dined, as Matilda was ſtill
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0206900201:31"/>
out, their reading went on as uſual. Mrs.
Willoughby took no notice of the ſwolen
eyes and half-ſtifled ſobs which ſtill agitated
the gentle boſom of her young friend; but
without naming the cauſe, ſhe ſeemed
ſolicitous to remove every remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs;
and by her eaſy and affectionate
manner Celeſtina became convinced that
concern for her ſon's departure, and not
anger towards her, had occaſioned the
coldneſs which had ſo much alarmed her;
and her ſoft heart was thus reſtored to
tranquillity.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
            <p>THOUGH Mrs. Willoughby took
infinite pains to appear cheerful, and to hide
the progreſs of the illneſs which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
her conſtitution, her efforts to
appear better than ſhe was, could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
her phyſicians; who now propoſed
that ſhe ſhould go either to Liſbon or the
South of France. This preſcription how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſhe endeavoured to evade, by aſſuring
them that travelling ſo late in the year
would infallibly injure rather than be uſeful
to her; but ſhe promiſed to follow their
advice early in the enſuing ſpring, and to
paſs the winter at Bath. Thither ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
in November, with her daughter
and Celeſtina, to remain ſome months.
Willoughby declined joining them at the
end of term, contrary to his uſual cuſtom:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0206900201:33"/>
he informed his mother, by letter, that he
had made a party with ſome of his friends
to paſs the Chriſtmas vacation at Alve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
and that on their way back to Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge
they would ſtay two or three days
at Bath.</p>
            <p>Matilda in the mean time, who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
every public amuſement, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Bath beauty, followed and admired
by that deſcription of men whoſe opinion
is conſidered as deciſive in the world of
faſhion. Miſs Willoughby was always
moſt elegantly dreſſed; for to be ſo was
the principal ſtudy of her life. She was
always with people of rank, was of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
family, had a good fortune, great
connections, a pretty perſon, and was, to
uſe the common phraſe, "extremely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed;"
that is, ſhe knew ſomething
of every thing, and talked as if ſhe knew
a great deal more. Among the men of
ton who contributed to feed her vanity and
raiſe her faſhion, was Mr. Molyneux, the
only ſon of an Iriſh Baronet, of whom the
bounty of a grandfather had made him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0206900201:34"/>
With an handſome figure, a
good fortune, and a title in reverſion, Mr.
Molyneux was every where courted and
admired; and by lounging about from
one public place to another during the
ſummer, and paſſing his winters, whether
in England or Ireland, in the very firſt
world, he had acquired ſo high a poliſh,
that his manners and his dreſs, his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and even his air, were copied by all
the riſing beaux. His underſtanding was
juſt of that level which rendered him capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being pleaſed with this ſpecies of
fame; and having no great warmth of
heart, he had no other motive of choice
in marrying than that which aroſe from
his ſolicitude to maintain his importance as
a man of taſte in the faſhionable world.
He had indeed no great inclination to
marry at all; but his father, now far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in life, preſſed him ſo earneſtly to
take a wife, and he was ſo beſieged by the
kind entreaties of two maiden aunts who
had a great deal to give him, that tired by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0206900201:35"/>
their importunity, and willing enough to
oblige them in a matter which was indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to himſelf, he at length, in the
thirty-fifth year of his age, fixed on Miſs
Willoughby, as a pretty woman, well
born, and above all—very much "the
rage." Propoſals from ſuch a man were
of courſe accepted by the mother and the
daughter; Willoughby was pleaſed to hear
his ſiſter was likely to be ſo well eſtabliſhed;
and in a few weeks it was ſettled that the
wedding was to take place in February,
when Mrs. Willoughby and her family
propoſed returning to London.</p>
            <p>When Willoughby came with his Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge
friends to Bath, to fulfil the promiſe
given to his mother, he was introduced to
his future brother-in-law. But a very ſhort
obſervation convinced him that they were
not deſigned for friends; and that however
cloſely they might be allied, Mr. Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux
would ſtill be to him a mere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.
Willoughby was eager in the
purſuit of knowledge; his mind, already
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0206900201:36"/>
highly cultivated, his heart warm and open,
and his manners, with all the ingenuous
ſimplicity of youth, had the natural good
breeding which only good underſtanding
can give. Whatever was the real charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Molyneux, it was no longer diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable
under the poliſh of faſhion; to
obtain which, alone, ſeemed to be his
ſtudy; all his ideas of good and evil, of
right or wrong, centered there. If books
had been the object, in the circle where he
moved, he would have qualified himſelf to
talk upon them; but as they were not, his
reading never extended beyond a ſhort no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
a pamphlet, or a newſpaper. To
ſtrike out ſomething new in a cape or a
carriage, ſomething which the great would
imitate and the little wonder at, was half
the purpoſe of his life: to have any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
was reckoned extremely vulgar;
and as he really had as few as was well poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
it coſt him but little trouble to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
himſelf of them entirely, and to obtain
that <hi>ſang froid</hi> which is the true criterion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0206900201:37"/>
of a man of faſhion. It is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to be in the Houſe of Commons.
A ſeat therefore he had for a Corniſh bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough;
where he gave a ſilent vote to the
Miniſter for the time being, and neither
cared nor enquired whether it would bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
or injure his country, about which he
was perfectly indifferent. Yet with a mind
occupied almoſt entirely by trifles, his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
figure, and his affluent fortune and
faſhionable manners, gave him that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
which is often denied to virtues and
talents. His air was that of a man of rank;
and the calm coldneſs of his manner gave
an idea of latent powers, which he was
ſuppoſed to be too indolent to exert.</p>
            <p>Matilda, in many reſpects, ſeemed to be
his very counterpart. Since they had been
ſo much together, ſhe had adopted his
thoughts and caught his phraſes; and her
brother, though he did not think her by
any means improved by the imitation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
that if ſimilarity of character gives
happineſs in marriage, his ſiſter had a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0206900201:38"/>
of being completely happy. But when
he looked at Celeſtina, which he avoided
doing as much as poſſible, he ſaw in her
improvements ſo different from thoſe of
Matilda, that all his reſolutions to wean
his mind from dwelling on her perfections
faded before her. She was now in her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth
year, with a face and form which
inſtantly attracted the eye, even before the
beauties of her underſtanding had time to
diſplay themſelves. Theſe latter ſhe never
obtruded on obſervation; but was as ſilent
in company as Matilda was talkative and gay.
The lovelineſs of her form therefore it was
that immediately ſtruck the young compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of Willoughby; who both, the inſtant
they quitted the room where they had been
introduced to Mrs. Willoughby, her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and Celeſtina, aſked of Willoughby
farther particulars of his adopted ſiſter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
they had never ſeen ſo charming a
girl, and expreſſing their wonder at the
calmneſs with which he had frequently
ſpoken of her. This converſation was ſo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0206900201:39"/>
uneaſy to him, that he could with difficulty
conceal his vexation; and as his college
friends from time to time renewed it, that
circumſtance, added to the pain he felt in
forcing himſelf to behave to Celeſtina with
cold and diſtant civility, ſhortened his viſit
to three days; at the end of which time he
took leave of his mother, who again men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to him her views in regard to Miſs
Fitz-Hayman; to which Willoughby, who
was leſs than ever inclined to liſten to her
on that point, returned vague but gentle
anſwers; eſcaping from it as well as he
could without giving any thing like a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
he haſtened back to his books,
among which he hoped to loſe the idea of
Celeſtina, which he could not cheriſh but at
the hazard of rendering either his mother
or himſelf unhappy.</p>
            <p>He promiſed to attend in London his
ſiſter's wedding, which was now to take
place in a month, and for which prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were making: but about a week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the day fixed for Mrs. Willoughby's
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0206900201:40"/>
departure for London, an inflammation on
her already injured lungs ſeized her ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
that there was only time to ſend an
expreſs to Cambridge for her ſon, who,
notwithſtanding his utmoſt expedition, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
hardly an hour before his excellent
parent expired.</p>
            <p>As ſhe had before taken leave of her
daughter and Celeſtina, the greater part of
that melancholy hour was given to her ſon,
ever the object of her tendereſt affections.
What paſſed was known only to Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
who, the moment his mother
was no more, gave way to ſuch an exceſs
of ſorrow, as deprived him for ſome hours
of his ſenſes; and when they were reſtored,
the ſight of Matilda's calmneſs, who did
not ſeem to him to feel half the concern
ſhe ought to do, and the perfect compoſure
of Molyneux, who evidently felt nothing,
ſeemed to him ſo inſupportable, that he
ſhut himſelf up in his own lodgings and
refuſed every offer of conſolation. Though
Celeſtina had long apprehended that the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0206900201:41"/>
life of her beloved benefactreſs was in a
much more precarious ſituation than ſhe
could herſelf allow, or than Matilda was
willing to ſee, yet this cruel and yet unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
blow quite overwhelmed her: but
Willoughby, as unable to bear the ſight of
her grief as diſpleaſed at the ſtoical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
of his ſiſter, fled with equal ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
from both of them; and having given
directions for removing the remains of his
mother to the family ſeat at Alveſtone, he
haſtened thither himſelf to receive and pay
them the laſt offices; which being done,
he wrote to his ſiſter, recommending it to
her to return to London with Celeſtina,
and to ſend for an elderly maiden relation
to remain with them till her marriage,
which the death of her mother had of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
poſtponed: he promiſed to ſee her
in town in the courſe of a fortnight, there
to execute, as far as he could, thoſe parts
of his mother's will which demanded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
attention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0206900201:42"/>
In purſuance of theſe directions the two
young ladies ſet out for London, Mr.
Molyneux following them in his own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
The fight of the houſe which had
now loſt its miſtreſs, threw Celeſtina into
all thoſe agonies which the recollection of
paſt happineſs and paſt kindneſs, from a
lamented friend, gives to a heart ſo tender
and ſo ſenſible as her's; while Matilda,
who ſhed a tear or two from feeling ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the ſame ſenſation, preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
herſelf, and received her lover,
who waited upon her immediately after his
arrival, without betraying any ſymptoms
of emotion which could give him cauſe to
apprehend that the repoſe of his future life
might ſuffer any interruption from the too
exquiſite ſenſibility of his wife.</p>
            <p>At the time he had appointed, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
rejoined them. Though he now
ſaw them with leſs emotion, his melancholy
ſeemed to be deeper than at firſt. With
his ſiſter he avoided all converſation that
was not abſolutely neceſſary; with Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
he was even more reſerved, and never,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0206900201:43"/>
as in their happier days, brought his books
and ſat with her, or ſought her converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as his greateſt pleaſure. He contrived
indeed, under pretence of having affairs
to ſettle abroad, to ſee her only at dinner
or ſupper; and frequently, under pretence
of illneſs, abſented himſelf from both.</p>
            <p>After having been with them a few days,
during which this reſerved and altered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
almoſt broke the heart of Celeſtina,
who ſeemed to have loſt, by the death of
the mother, the friendſhip of the ſon, he
ſent up one of the female ſervants to her
room, when ſhe retired thither after break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,
to beg to ſpeak to her in his ſiſter's
dreſſing room. This formal meſſage, ſo
unlike the brotherly familiarity with which
he uſed to treat her, cut her to the heart,
but ſhe immediately attended the ſummons.</p>
            <p>Willoughby bowed on her entrance.
They both fat down: Celeſtina trying to
check the tears ſhe found riſing to her eyes,
and the ſighs which ſwelled her boſom.
His looks, ſo pale, ſo changed from what
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0206900201:44"/>
they were, his attitude, his ſilence, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to diſtreſs her; while he ſeemed
collecting fortitude to go through the taſk
he was to execute. After a ſhort pauſe,
he took from his pocket book a paper,
opened it, and counted out three Bank
notes, of ſix hundred pounds each, on the
table; then advancing towards her with
them in his hand, he preſented them to
her, ſaying in a voice which he did not
intend ſhould faulter—"There, Madam,
is the ſum which Mrs. Willoughby—which
my mother, by her will, bequeaths you,
and which, as her executor, I moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
pay you. Allow me to wiſh you
every happineſs—and—" He would
have gone on: but Celeſtina, who had
ariſen on his approaching her, turned pale
and ſat down. "You are not well," ſaid
he: "the recollection of my mother—"</p>
            <p>"Does indeed overcome me," anſwered
Celeſtina. "<hi>I</hi> have loſt a mother—and a
brother too—Yes! I have loſt all!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0206900201:45"/>
"Pardon me, Miſs de Mornay," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Willoughby, "I meant not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
you—and—"</p>
            <p>"Miſs de Mornay!" repeated Celeſtina,
again interrupting him—"<hi>Miſs</hi> de Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay
and <hi>Madam.</hi> Ah! Mr. Willoughby!
thoſe appellations of diſtant civility con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
me that I have no longer a friend—a
brother—"</p>
            <p>"Nay, but my dear Madam, be not,
I beſeech you, guilty of ſo much injuſtice.
Let me execute the directions given me
by my dear deceaſed mother, whoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
you know were, that within two
months after her deceaſe theſe ſhould be
put in your poſſeſſion." He then again
offered the notes to her.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina put forth her trembling hand;
but inſtantly withdrew it.—"I cannot
take the notes indeed, Mr. Willoughby,"
ſaid ſhe. "What can I do with them?
I, who am a minor, a ſtranger, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan;
who have no relation, no guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian—no
friend! I did indeed hope," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſhe, her eyes filling with tears from
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0206900201:46"/>
the recollection of her forlorn ſituation—"I
did indeed hope that you, Sir, would
have had the goodneſs to have kept it for
me till—"</p>
            <p>She ſtopped from inability to proceed.
"Till when, my dear Miſs De Mornay?"
cried Willoughby with eagerneſs he ſeemed
endeavouring to check.—"Certainly I
would if it had been in my power; but it
was my ſolemn promiſe to my mother to
pay it into your hands, or into thoſe of
any perſon whom you ſhould appoint."</p>
            <p>"And cannot I name <hi>you</hi> as being that
perſon?"</p>
            <p>"Pardon me, dear Celeſtina," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
Willoughby, ſpeaking haſtily, as if
fearful of relapſing into the fondneſs he
once felt, and deſirous of quitting a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſubject—"pardon me, it is not poſſible
for me to be of that ſervice to you which
moſt aſſuredly I ſhould rejoice to be if—"</p>
            <p>"Dear Celeſtina!" replied ſhe. "Ah!
Willoughby! I have ſeen for many, many
months, that I am no longer your once
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0206900201:47"/>
dear ſiſter Celeſtina. Call me Madam and
Miſs de Mornay, as you did juſt now, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than flatter me with the ſound, when
the ſincerity of your regard is gone! Well
Sir! ſince, for reaſons which perhaps I
ought not to penetrate, it is no longer in
<hi>your</hi> power to act by me as a brother and a
friend, I will no farther intrude on your
kindneſs than to beg you will tell me how
I ought to place the proviſion thus made
for me by my benefactreſs."</p>
            <p>Willoughby half ſtifled a deep ſigh; and
after a moment's pauſe ſaid—"I would
adviſe you to place it immediately on go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
ſecurity, in the names of two
perſons on whom you can rely, till you
become of age. Dawſon, who was, you
know, always employed by my mother, is
more converſant than I am in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
If you will give me leave I will ſend
him to you; and I am convinced you may
ſafely truſt to his honor and probity."</p>
            <p>He then again offered the notes he had
in his hand. Celeſtina took them in ſilence,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0206900201:48"/>
being in truth unable to ſpeak; and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
haſtily away, he reached the door,
where he ſtopped as if irreſolute; then in a
low and faultering voice he ſaid—"As I
ſhall probably ſee you no more, unleſs in
mixed company, before I return to Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,
I cannot take this my laſt leave
without aſſuring you, that however cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
may, alas! <hi>muſt</hi> prevent my
ſhewing it, my heart can never be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to the welfare—to the happineſs of
my ſiſter Celeſtina."</p>
            <p>There was no time for the trembling
auditor to anſwer this addreſs, to reflect on
the peculiar way in which the whole was
delivered, nor on the ſtrong emphaſis laid
on the words <hi>may</hi> and <hi>muſt;</hi> for he
was in a moment at the bottom of the
ſtairs, and Celeſtina, who remained in
breathleſs agitation, with the door of the
apartment ſtill open, heard him a moment
afterwards call to his ſervant for his hat,
and the door of the houſe preſently ſhut
after him. She then ſat down and burſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0206900201:49"/>
into tears, for which ſhe was, on a little
reflection, aſhamed to aſſign a reaſon even
to herſelf. "For what do I weep," ſaid
ſhe—"or why am I diſappointed? What
did I expect? that Willoughby was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
to me? Surely no! for he never
gave me any reaſon to imagine it, and of
late has ſedulouſly avoided me, as if he
ſuppoſed me weak and vain enough to
miſinterpret the friendſhip and regard he
uſed to ſhew me. Let me, while he does
ſtay, convince him that he may, without
prejudice to his views in regard to Miſs
Fitz-Hayman, ſtill treat me and conſider
me as his ſiſter, and that I never thought
of being looked upon otherwiſe, which
ſurely he muſt have fancied, or he would
not behave to me as he does!" Another
flood of tears relieved the ſwelling heart
of Celeſtina after this ſoliloquy. She then
dried her eyes, dreſſed, and acquired ſo
much command over herſelf as to meet
Willoughby at dinner without betraying
any ſymptoms of the uneaſineſs and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0206900201:50"/>
ſhe ſtill ſuffered; and when the
next day he took leave of her and Matilda,
ſhe bade him adieu with the ſame appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
calmneſs.</p>
            <p>Three months paſſed, and the time fixed
for Matilda's marriage arrived. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
then wrote to deſire his ſiſter would
excuſe his devoting only a ſingle day to
her on that occaſion: he would attend
he ſaid to give her away, but was obliged
by indiſpenſible buſineſs to return imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
afterwards to Cambridge. Matilda
remarked how ſtrange it was that her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who had now been ſome time of
age, was ſo bigotted to his books that he
could not leave them for longer than a
day even on ſuch an occaſion; but his
pleaſures and her's differed ſo greatly, and
their tempers and purſuits were ſo oppoſite,
that no ſympathy had for ſome years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted
between them; though on the part of
Willoughby there was always great affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for her; and on her's, as much regard
for her brother as it was her nature to feel
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0206900201:51"/>
for any body. This difference of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and inclination however had inſenſibly
ſo far eſtranged them from each other,
that the company of Willoughby was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener
a reſtraint than a pleaſure to his ſiſter,
and therefore as ſhe felt little regret in
loſing it, ſhe thought not much about his
motives for depriving her of it.</p>
            <p>The evening before that on which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda
was by ſpecial licence to be married
to Mr. Molyneux, her brother arrived:
but inſtead of the gaiety the occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
or even that which had formerly
been uſual with him, his melancholy and
regret ſeemed to have become habitual by
indulgence. He hardly ſpoke: and when
he did, it was with ſuch languor that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda
might with reaſon have been alarmed
for his health, if ſhe had been capable of
attending ſeriouſly to any thing but her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Celeſtina, to whom he behaved with
more diſtant reſerve than ever, could not
be inſenſible or ſilent about a health and
life which ought ſhe thought to be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0206900201:52"/>
to his ſiſter and his friends, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe ſpoke to Matilda, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
after ſupper, of the change ſo evident
in her brother. Matilda anſwered coldly
that it was owing to nothing but his bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf as he did among his books,
and loſing all reliſh for other company.
"I wiſh," added ſhe, "that theſe Fitz-Haymans
were come over, that he might
live in the world again, and be like other
people, which he muſt be when he is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried."
Celeſtina could not heartily join in
this wiſh, and even doubted whether Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
ever would be quite like thoſe
who were called "other people" by his
ſiſter. She dropped the converſation how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and retired to her pillow with more
ſolicitude for the happineſs of Matilda,
which was to be determined the next day,
than Matilda was capable of feeling for
herſelf. The image of Willoughby, ſuch
as he was a few years before, was ſtrongly
painted by her imagination: ſhe ran over
all their former early pleaſures; their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0206900201:53"/>
walks, their reading, their gardening toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at Alveſtone while yet children; then
Willoughby, ſuch as he now was, ſo amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
yet ſo changed, obtruded himſelf on
her mind; and being unable to look forward
with any degree of pleaſure, ſhe felt with
redoubled ſorrow that thoſe days of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
confidence and ingenuous tenderneſs,
could never—never return!</p>

         <div n="3" type="chapter">

            <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
            <p>WHEN the party met the next day,
every body had left off their mourning,
and every face appeared cheerful but
thoſe of Willoughby and Celeſtina: the
latter, when gaily rallied by the friends of
Mr. Molyneux, endeavoured to recover
her tranquillity; and as to Matilda herſelf,
ſhe gave away her hand with as much eaſe
as if it was a matter of courſe. Molyneux
received it with equal compoſure; and as
ſoon as they were married, they ſat out,
accompanied only by Celeſtina and Mr.
Hamilton, a near relation of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms,
for an houſe which Mr. Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux
rented in Hampſhire. Willoughby
ſaluted his ſiſter; and as he handed her into
the coach he again wiſhed her happineſs.
It was impoſſible to avoid doing the ſame
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0206900201:55"/>
as Celeſtina paſſed him, but he faultered,
and could hardly articulate his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which while he was yet tremulouſly
attempting to expreſs, holding one of her
hands between his, Mr. Hamilton, who had
been detained by giving ſome orders to his
ſervant, came up, and taking her other
hand ſaid—"Come, come! as you don't go
with us, Willoughby, the care of this lady
devolves upon me, and I ſhall not allow
theſe ſorrowful partings to make her as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
as you are yourſelf all her journey."
Celeſtina was then unreſiſtingly led away;
while Willoughby, who followed her to
the coach door, found at that moment his
heart aſſailed by pangs it had never felt
before, but which he knew too well to be
jealouſy in its moſt corroſive form. As the
coach drove away, he ſtood looking after
it; now repenting that he had not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
his ſiſter and her huſband into
Hampſhire, then determining to order his
horſe and follow them; now deteſting Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,
of whom he had never thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and then reſolving to conquer a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0206900201:56"/>
paſſion which a thouſand circumſtances
made it the height of folly to indulge.
The coach which contained the object of
it was already out of ſight; but Willoughby
ſtill ſtood on the ſpot from whence it had
been driven, ſo loſt in the indulgence of
theſe ſenſations, that he forgot where he
was, and was rouſed from his reverie only
by the arrival of a friend with whom he
had made an appointment to go in his
chaiſe part of the way to Cambridge.</p>
            <p>This friend he was aſhamed to diſappoint,
nor could he form any excuſe to account
for his ſuddenly changing his mind and
following his ſiſter, whom he had ſteadily
declined to accompany under pretence of
urgent engagements. While he yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
the chaiſe was ready, and with an
heart torn with contending paſſions, and a
mind intent only on Celeſtina and the
advantage Hamilton enjoyed of being ſo
long with her, as during the ſtay of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneux
in Hampſhire and in the tour they
were afterwards to make, he proceeded,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0206900201:57"/>
abſent, ſilent, and miſerable, to the end of
his journey.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina with equal oppreſſion of ſpirits
was yet more unfortunate, becauſe ſhe was
afraid of enquiring too narrowly into the
ſource of her concern, nor did ſhe dare to
indulge it, but was compelled to aſſume
cheerfulneſs very foreign to her feelings.
Mr. Hamilton, who had never taken much
notice of her before, now ſeemed diſpoſed
to amuſe himſelf by coquetting with her;
but ſhe had ſo little inclination to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
him, that, as he was too perfectly a
man of the world to give himſelf much
trouble about any woman, he ſoon left her
to her own amuſements. In a few days
after the bride and bridegroom arrived at
their houſe, it was filled with company;
and Matilda, wholly occupied with parties
all the morning, and play in the evening,
had never time to think of Celeſtina, who
ſoon found herſelf neglected by the only
perſon whom ſhe could now call her
friend; and the diſappointment which ſtill
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0206900201:58"/>
ſat ſo heavy on her heart—the failure, as
ſhe believed, of Willoughby's regard—was
now embittered by the coldneſs or rather
careleſneſs which ſhe experienced from his
ſiſter.</p>
            <p>In a few weeks a party was made to viſit
Plymouth and the Weſtern bathing places.
Celeſtina went with them as a matter of
courſe, but ſhe felt herſelf dwindling faſt
into the humiliating character of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
companion, and ſometimes fancied
that her place in the coach might have
been occupied by another more to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of her friend: yet Mrs. Molyneux
was never rude to her; and ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
(with apparent kindneſs) how her
mother had adopted her from a convent,
and that therefore ſhe ever ſhould conſider
her as her ſiſter. Celeſtina always felt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
more mortified than gratified by theſe
relations; and by degrees they became ſo
irkſome to her, and the whole ſtyle of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
among Matilda's friends ſo little
to her taſte, that ſhe inſenſibly acquired
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0206900201:59"/>
an habit of abſenting herſelf, and of living
very much alone either in her own room
or in the walks which wherever the party
fixed ſhe contrived to find, and whither
the image of Willoughby, ſuch as it had
been at a very early period of her life
impreſſed on her young heart, inceſſantly
accompanied her. This was more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
the caſe when in the courſe of their
tour Mr. and Mrs. Molyneux undertook
to ſhew their friends Alveſtone, where
Willoughby had ordered every thing to
be prepared for their reception as if he had
been himſelf there. Matilda re-viſited
this beautiful place with no other emotions
than thoſe of gratified pride; but on Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
it had a very different effect: this
was the ſcene where the happieſt, hours of
her life had paſſed. The dreſſing room
where they all uſed to aſſemble when the
only parent ſhe had known was it's miſtreſs,
brought her forcibly to the recollection of
Celeſtina. The chair on which ſhe uſed
to ſit, the furniture which ſhe had worked
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0206900201:60"/>
herſelf, and the pictures ſhe had collected,
were ſo many memorials on which Celeſtina
could not look without recollecting a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
inſtances of her general goodneſs or
her particular tenderneſs, and feeling with
bitter regret the irreparable loſs ſhe had
ſuſtained. The park and the gardens too
furniſhed her with many ſources of painful
contemplation, mingled however with a
degree of melancholy ſo ſoothing, that
nothing would have been to her ſo great
a puniſhment as being obliged to exchange
it for the deſultory and unintereſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
which, in the little time ſpared
from the card table, engaged the party
within the houſe.</p>
            <p>The party however troubled themſelves
very little with her; and ſhe was left at
liberty to retrace the walks which ſhe had
ſo often traverſed with Willoughby while
Matilda leaned on one arm and ſhe on the
other, and to gaze on the proſpects which
he, while yet a boy, had pointed out to
them with ſo much pleaſure. She remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0206900201:61"/>
all the propoſed improvements of
which he delighted to talk. A rapid ſtream
burſting from the hollow of a rocky com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
that bounded the park, and made its
way through it, had been by the former
Mr. Willoughby widened at a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
and now fell ſeveral feet into a vale
which he had at a ſtill greater coſt, floated
with water. On the ſides of this fall, which
had been formerly part of the common,
grew ſome old oaks and beech, and among
theſe the mountain aſh and weeping birch
had been planted and now ſpread their
various foliage and half concealed the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that daſhed from rock to rock between
them. Theſe ſteep banks had ever been
the favourite ſeats of Willoughby; who
there ſitting between his two ſiſters, and
holding each of their hands, had very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
amuſed himſelf with projects to
encreaſe the roar of the water or deepen
the ſhade of the wood that fringed it's ſide.
This place was the daily reſort of Celeſtina
during the week ſhe remained at Alveſtone
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0206900201:62"/>
and thither ſhe uſually carried ſome of
thoſe books from the library that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered
Willoughby had read to her.
Theſe were principally poetry: and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peruſal
of them, the place, the ſeaſon, a
thouſand tender remembrances enforced
by each, ſerved at once to ſoften and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
an heart naturally tender and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate,
which, deprived of almoſt every
other object of it's regard, cheriſhed with
painful pleaſure the idea of Willoughby,
ſuch as he once was, and when they paſſed
here ſo many innocent enchanting hours.
But when ſhe imagined that in a few months
he would probably re-viſit theſe ſcenes
with another, with Miſs Fitz-Hayman,
who would then be his wife, and that ſhe
herſelf ſhould never again be admitted to
wander among them with their beloved
maſter, ſick deſpondence took poſſeſſion
of her ſoul, and it was with difficulty after
theſe reflections that ſhe could reaſſume
courage enough to mix with the friends
whom Mr. and Mrs. Molyneux had aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0206900201:63"/>
to liſten to inſipid pleaſantry and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to unintereſting converſation.</p>
            <p>But whatever regret Celeſtina felt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting
paſt hours of felicity which ſhe
knew could never return, ſhe left Alve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
with extreme reluctance, and had it
been proper, or poſſible, would moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
have remained there alone. In
quitting it never to return, ſhe felt almoſt as
much concern as ſhe had done when in
taking leave of Willoughby ſhe fancied
that ſhe ſhould ſee him no more till he was
married to Miſs Fitz-Hayman.</p>
            <p>Of that match Mrs. Molyneux now
very frequently ſpoke as a matter entirely
ſettled, and Celeſtina no longer doubted
of it's ſpeedy completion. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
(which gave her uneaſineſs that ſhe
was unable either to repreſs or entirely to
diſguiſe), the encreaſing indifference of
Matilda towards her, and the conſtant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of company in which Mr. and Mrs.
Molyneux lived, united to raiſe in her a
wiſh to quit them; and finding that the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0206900201:64"/>
hints ſhe gave of ſuch a diſpoſition were
received with perfect careleſneſs, and that
ſuch a removal would probably not be
objected to, ſhe every day grew fonder of
her project, and during their ſtay at Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth
fixed on a cottage about four miles
from it, where ſhe thought ſhe might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
if not happily at leaſt in that quiet
obſcurity which her circumſtances rendered
prudent, and her diſtaſte to the world in
which ſhe now lived, pleaſant. She found
that ſhe could there be accommodated
with board and lodging, and there ſhe
would now have remained if Mrs. Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux
had not, when ſhe underſtood her
project, inſiſted on her returning to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
with her after finiſhing their tour.—"Go
with me however," ſaid ſhe, "the
reſt of our journey, and till we meet the
Caſtlenorths, who are to be in town in
October; and then if you have this rural
paſſion ſtill ſo ſtrong upon you, you ſhall
take your own way." Though there was
little appearance of affection in this invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0206900201:65"/>
Celeſtina thought ſhe ought not to
decline it, and therefore, though meeting
the Caſtlenorths was what ſhe moſt ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citouſly
wiſhed to avoid, ſhe determined
to go with her friend to town, that ſhe
might not give her any pretence for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
her entirely, or incur the cenſure
of the world for leaving abruptly the only
protection ſhe could claim.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
            <p>THE return of Mr. and Mrs. Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux
to London was poſtponed from time
to time till November. Lord Caſtlenorth
had been too ill to ſet out on his journey to
England at the time he propoſed, and the
family meeting which was to ſettle all that
related to the marriage was now delayed
till after Chriſtmas. Willoughby however
teſtified no impatience: he had promiſed
to meet his ſiſter and her huſband in town
on their arrival; but inſtead of doing ſo,
he ſent ſuch an inſufficient excuſe as muſt
have appeared very ſtrange to Matilda
had ſhe thought much about it; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed
in pleaſures and purſuits of her
own, ſhe gave herſelf very little time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on her brother's conduct, and was
far from ſuppoſing that he abſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0206900201:67"/>
becauſe he could not ſee Celeſtina
without encreaſing and confirming a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which he had many reaſons againſt
indulging, and of which he was determined
to cure himſelf by abſence and reflection.
The negociation with his uncle, which
had been carried ſo far by his mother, he
neither declined nor forwarded; but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it to remain nearly on the footing ſhe
had left it, flattering himſelf that by the
time Miſs Fitz-Hayman arrived in London,
he ſhould have ſo far conquered his early
attachment as to have an heart as well as
the hand, which he had promiſed to his
mother's entreaties, to offer her.</p>
            <p>Though his endeavours to forget Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
had hitherto been quite unſucceſsful,
he had however acquired ſo much reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as to determine not to ſee her, till the
arrival of his deſtined wife, and the final
ſettlement of every thing that related to
his marriage, ſhould put it out of his power
to break the engagement he had made to
Mrs. Willoughby in her laſt hours, and to
ſacrifice every thing to his paſſion. The
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0206900201:68"/>
ſtruggle he underwent however was dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and by continually repeating to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the neceſſity there was for his forgetting
Celeſtina, he ſo accuſtomed himſelf to
think of her, that he in reality ſoon ceaſed
to think with intereſt of any body elſe;
and though he endeavoured to perſuade
himſelf that he ſhould have courage to
acquit himſelf of what he tried to think his
duty to his family, to his mother's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and himſelf, there was no intelligence
he ſo much dreaded as that of the arrival
of his uncle's family in England.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina on her part, paſſed her time in
a way very unpleaſant to her. Mrs. Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux,
now miſtreſs of herſelf, plunged
into unceaſing diſſipation; and as Celeſtina
was frequently deſired to accompany her,
and always to make one of the parties ſhe
collected at her own houſe, ſhe found that
the expences of dreſs alone would greatly
exceed the income of her little fortune,
and that ſhe ſhould ſoon exhauſt it to live
among people whoſe ſociety gave her no
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0206900201:69"/>
pleaſure, and who for the moſt part conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
her only as ſhe was capable of filling
up a table or the corner of a coach when
it was vacant. Her quickneſs of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
and extreme ſenſibility made her
too frequently remark, that the table or the
coach might in the apprehenſion of Matilda
always be as well, and ſometimes better
filled; and theſe obſervations, together
with her growing diſlike to Mr. Molyneux,
and the people with whom he aſſociated,
who not unfrequently treated her with the
impertinent familiarity which they thought
themſelves at liberty to uſe towards Mrs.
Molyneux's <hi>companion,</hi> renewed, before ſhe
had been ſix weeks in town, her wiſh to
quit them for ever, and to enjoy in her
own way the ſmall independence given her
by her lamented benefactreſs.</p>
            <p>The certainty that Miſs Fitz-Hayman
was ſo ſoon to become the wife of the only
man for whom ſhe ever had felt the leaſt
degree of partiality, haſtened the execution
of her project. She now heard every day
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0206900201:70"/>
of the great beauty, the extraordinary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments,
and the immenſe fortune
of the future bride, while Mrs. Molyneux
was exerciſing her fancy on the equipages,
and other preparations which were ſo ſoon
to be on foot for the wedding of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
a ſubject that Celeſtina always liſtened
to with impatience, which, though ſhe with
difficulty concealed it from others, ſhe was
painfully conſcious of herſelf. The eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
harangues of Mrs. Molyneux on taſte
and elegance had always been fatiguing to
her, but ſhe was more than uſually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted
when the purpoſe of theſe lectures
was to decide upon or to deſcribe the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
fineries intended for Willoughby and
Miſs Fitz-Hayman.</p>
            <p>A letter now arrived from Lady Caſtle-north
announcing her intentions of being
in London with her Lord and her daughter
the following week; and at this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
Celeſtina, no longer heſitating, wrote
to the perſon near Sidmouth, to whom ſhe
had ſpoken the preceding ſummer; and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0206900201:71"/>
finding ſhe could be immediately received
at the lodging ſhe had then looked at,
ſhe packed up and ſent by the waggon
the ſmall collection of books given her
by Mrs. Willoughby, which with her
cloaths and the legacy veſted in the funds,
were all her worldly poſſeſſions; and that
evening after ſupper, when by a chance
very unuſual with them Mr. and Mrs. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneux
were without company, ſhe declared
her intentions of going into the country
the next day.</p>
            <p>Mr. Molyneux, twirling about a wine
glaſs and humming a tune, ſeemed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
very little to the information; his
wife, after hearing it with almoſt equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,
ſaid—"I cannot imagine, my
dear, why you think of going into the
country now, or what you propoſe by it."</p>
            <p>"Nothing more," replied Celeſtina,
piqued at the coldneſs of her manner,
"than to accuſtom myſelf at once to a
mode of life which my narrow fortune ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0206900201:72"/>
if not abſolutely neceſſary, at leaſt
highly prudent."</p>
            <p>"Prudence," cried Molyneux with a
ſmile which Celeſtina thought a contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
one, "is an acquiſition very unuſual
at eighteen: but a girl of ſpirit, with ſo
pretty a perſon as your's is, ſhould be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ambitious than prudent, and ſhould
try to make her fortune by marriage inſtead
of hiding herſelf in the country. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs
young women about town have
done extremely well, who, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment,
have not had your ſhare of beauty."</p>
            <p>"Very poſſibly, Sir," replied Celeſtina;
"but unleſs my mind was diſpoſed as
their minds probably were, which I believe
it never will be, the perſonal advantages
you ſo flatteringly allow me, will never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the affluence you think ſo deſirable."</p>
            <p>"What do you mean to ſay?" anſwered
he. "What! do you pretend that you
would not marry as other women do for
money or title?"</p>
            <p>"For neither, upon my honor."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0206900201:73"/>
"Pooh! I thought you had more ſenſe;
but ſince it is ſo, my dear Celeſtina, I wiſh
you all poſſible felicity in your new plan
of paſtoral amuſement, and doubt not but
that ſome tender and amiable Philander, in
the ſhape of a young weſt country curate,
will enable you to realize to your heart's
content all your ideas of diſintereſted love
and rural happineſs."</p>
            <p>Molyneux then ſauntered away, and his
lady looking in a pocket mirror, and pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her teeth with the niceſt care, took up
the argument.</p>
            <p>"You know Celeſtina that I have the
greateſt regard in the world for you, and
that I have argued with you for ever about
this nonſenſical reſolution, which I cannot
imagine what put into your head. You
will be tired to death child, in the country
at this time of the year. However if you
will go, do ſtay here at leaſt till after my
brother is married. We ſhall have half the
world with us then, and I ſhall want you
for twenty things."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0206900201:74"/>
At the mention of Willoughby's mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
Celeſtina, though ſo much accuſtomed
to hear of it, changed colour, and her
voice as well as her look might have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
the uneaſy ſenſations ſhe felt, if
Mrs. Molyneux had not been always too
much occupied by herſelf to attend very
narrowly to another.</p>
            <p>"Pardon me, dear Madam," ſaid Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
"I certainly cannot be wanted on
that occaſion. You will have ſo many
other friends about you that I ſhall not be
miſſed; and I have no right, indeed I
never had any, to be upon an equality with
the perſons who will then be aſſembled
about you. Let me therefore find my
own place in ſociety, and learn at once to
ſubmit to it."</p>
            <p>After ſome other converſation, Celeſtina,
ſtill unwilling to appear in the ſlighteſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
ungrateful for paſt kindneſs or too
impatient of her preſent ſituation, agreed
to ſtay another week in town; and retired
to her own room relieved by having thus
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0206900201:75"/>
declared her intentions, and fixed the time
when her preſent uneaſy ſtate of depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
would be at an end.</p>
            <p>But of this delay ſhe repented, when the
next day notice was received by Mrs. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneux
of the arrival of Lord and Lady
Caſtlenorth at their houſe in Groſvenor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet.
Mr. and Mrs. Molyneux inſtantly
waited on them; the next evening they
were to return the viſit in form; and
thus Celeſtina was compelled to be preſent
at a meeting ſhe had been ſtudiouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to avoid.</p>
            <p>Lord Caſtlenorth was one of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
beings, who have been brought
up never to have a wiſh unprevented or a
want ungratified. He was born when his
father was far advanced in life, the ſole
heir to one of the moſt ancient<note n="*" place="bottom">Fitz-Hayman, Earl of Gloceſter, came in with
the Conqueror, the heireſs of which family married
a natural ſon of Henry I. by Neſla, daughter of
Rhees Prince of South Wales.</note> families
and opulent fortunes in England; and was
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0206900201:76"/>
of ſo much conſequence, that till he was
near eighteen he was hardly ever ſuffered
out of the ſight of his father. He was
then releaſed by death from the officious
affection which had long been very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
to him; and with every thing on
his ſide but a good conſtitution, he ſat
out on a wild career of pleaſure, in which,
before he had materially hurt his fortune,
he was ſtopped by the apprehenſion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
health. His figure was one of thoſe
which look as if
<q>The blaſts of January would blow them thro'
and thro';</q>
and the irregularities of his life had ſo
much impaired a habit naturally weak,
that at thirty he was a mere ſhadow, and
then was told by his phyſicians that he
muſt reſolve on a reſidence of ſome time
in the South of Europe if he would avoid
going to that country "from whoſe bourn
no traveller returns:" to which having
an invincible averſion, he loſt not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0206900201:77"/>
in complying with their advice. But
as he ſoon recovered ſome degree of health,
he grew every day leſs attentive to injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they had given as to his manner
of life; and relapſing into his former
indiſcretions, he was again reduced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities,
and when very little hope of his
life remained, was recommended by one of
his medical friends in London to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
under the care of Dr. Maclaurin, a
Scottiſh phyſician, who had been ſettled for
two or three years at Naples with his wife
and family.</p>
            <p>There he was treated with the moſt aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous
attention, not only by the Doctor
himſelf but by Mrs. Maclaurin and her
daughter, then near thirty, who was ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
as to allow herſelf to be five and
twenty. She was tall, and had a tolerable
face, with which her ambition to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
ſuffered her not to be content in it's
natural ſtate. She had been brought up
to attend moſt ſedulouſly to her own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
and to purſue the eſtabliſhment of her
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0206900201:78"/>
fortune by marriage: ſhe had therefore
learned early to fawn and flatter; and to
the cunning of her mother united ſome
portion of the abilities of her father. Mrs.
Maclaurin was one of that ſpecies of beings
who are by courteſy denominated good
ſort of women. All her virtues were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative;
and of the few vices ſhe had it in
her power to practiſe, ſhe contented her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with malice and defamation, and even
in thoſe ſhe never indulged herſelf unleſs
very certain that the objects were incapable
of retort and totally defenceleſs. She had
now however but little opportunity of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification;
for though ſhe had lived three
years in Italy, ſhe underſtood not a word
of the language, and her attempts to amend
the world being therefore made, in one not
underſtood by thoſe in whoſe favor they
were exerted, were very little compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
and of courſe failed of affording
her much ſatisfaction. Her talents being
thus perforce confined to her own houſhold,
had taken another turn, and had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0206900201:79"/>
to the acquiſition of money, and of
ſecuring a good match for her daughter.</p>
            <p>The Doctor, though really a man of
ſome abilities, had not hitherto been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
enough in his profeſſion to be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to give her a fortune: the project of
marrying her well was equally intereſting
to him; and among the various patients
he had received into his houſe ſince he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided
at Naples, the elder ſon of a very
opulent merchant in London, and an old
Baronet, who had ſeveral daughters older
than Miſs Maclaurin, very narrowly eſcaped
her multiform attractions by the impertinent
remonſtrances of their families.</p>
            <p>Lord Caſtlenorth had no relations but
Mrs. Willoughby, who was very unlikely
to interfere in any matrimonial project; he
had beſides a much larger fortune, and was
of a much higher rank, than any of thoſe
for whom the family of Maclaurin had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the honor of their alliance; but the
very circumſtances which rendered the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of ſuch a marriage moſt alluring,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0206900201:80"/>
ſeemed to preclude the probability of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p>Among the few things Lord Caſtlenorth
had learned of his father, the principal was
to value himſelf on his deſcent; and, as
far as related to his own family, he was a
genealogiſt almoſt as ſoon as he could ſpeak.
As he advanced in life, he found himſelf
of ſo little conſequence for individual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that he was compelled to avail himſelf
of the names of his anceſtors, from whom
only he derived any importance at all;
and the "puny inſect ſhivering at a breeze,"
ſwelled with conſcious pride when he recited
the names of heroes from whom he had ſo
woefully degenerated.</p>
            <p>This pride of anceſtry was now the moſt
diſtinguiſhing feature in a character where
it appeared with the greateſt prominence,
from the faintneſs and inſipidity of the
other traits, for being no longer able to
purſue the diſſolute manner of life which
he had adopted rather from faſhion than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0206900201:81"/>
he had now in other reſpects no
character at all.</p>
            <p>Miſs Maclaurin, who began to ſtudy
him as ſoon as he was received by her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſoon ſaw it, and ſaw it with diſmay;
for ſhe ſuppoſed that it would be an inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable
bar to thoſe hopes, which ſhe
thought ſhe might otherwiſe very reaſonably
entertain.</p>
            <p>The Doctor however had too many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources
to be ſo eaſily diſcouraged. He
fabricated with admirable ingenuity a ſtory,
of which he juſtly ſuppoſed the ignorance
and indolence of his patient would prevent
his ever detecting the falſehood. He ſaid
that he was really a Hamilton, and had
taken his preſent name in compliance with
the whim of a diſtant relation, who had on
that condition given him his property.
The only objection being thus removed,
Miſs Maclaurin had a fair field for her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
talents; and they were ſo effectually
exerted, that in about five months after
Lord Caſtlenorth's reception into the family
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0206900201:82"/>
of Maclaurin, he became himſelf a member
of it, and Miſs Maclaurin returned to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
as his wife.</p>
            <p>That her father might ſtill retain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
too ſcrupulous an enquiry, his relation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to the houſe of Hamilton, and that
her mother's coarſe figure and coarſer man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
might be no diſgrace to Lady Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north
in the ſphere where ſhe now prepared
to blaze, ſhe prevailed upon them to retire
to their native country on a penſion which
there gave them conſequence: while her
Ladyſhip, who while ſhe was Miſs Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laurin
had nothing doubted of her own
eminent perfections, was now ſo convinced
of their irreſiſtible power by their having
thus eſtabliſhed her in a ſituation ſo much
above her hopes, that ſhe thought herſelf
born for the government and amendment
of the world, and from that period had
been advancing inarrogance and oſtentation
till the preſent hour; when at the age of
fifty, with an unweildy perſon and a broad
face, where high cheek bones appeared
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0206900201:83"/>
emulous of giving ſome protection to two
grey prominent eyes, whoſe lids ſeemed
inadequate to ſhade them, Lady Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north
was as well by her rank as her ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
and her travels, qualified in her own
opinion for univerſal dominion. Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
therefore with governing her Lord
with deſpotic ſway, (which indeed ſaved
him the trouble and probably the diſgrace
of governing himſelf) ſhe aſſumed towards
the reſt of the world a ſtyle equally dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial.
Her opinion was ſtrongly enforced
on every topic that came before her; in
private anecdote, in public debates, in
literature, in politics, in faſhions, ſhe was
equally omniſcient; and whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
ran on taxes or on taſte, in laying
out grounds or on ſetting out a dinner, in
making a peace or a poem, ſhe underſtood
all, deſcanted on all, and could decide
on all, in a way from which few of her
auditors had at the moment courage to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0206900201:84"/>
By the ſide of this majeſtic figure, her
Lord, the deſcendant of the old Earls of
Glouceſter, of Welſh Princes and Engliſh
Kings, ſunk into inſignificance. His di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive
figure, now ſhrunk by age and
ſickneſs, his ſallow and withered counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and his feeble ſtep, formed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
contraſt to his robuſt and Juno-like
lady, by whom he ſuffered himſelf to be
led about, without ever pretending to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from her opinion, unleſs in matters of
heraldry or genealogy, where he ſtill ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to take the lead, in which ſhe was
for the moſt part willing to indulge him.
His Lordſhip's ill health had made him
alſo converſant in phyſic; a ſcience in
which, notwithſtanding her hereditary claim
to it, Lady Caſtlenorth had not ſhewn much
diſpoſition to contend with him: but as
there was more trouble and diſguſt than
honour to be obtained by a conſtant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it, as applied to his real or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
complaints, ſhe had very frequently
delegated her authority, and at length
quite relinquiſhed her knowledge, to a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0206900201:85"/>
relation, who being a widow (and ſaid to
poſſeſs a pretty fortune though nobody ever
knew where it lay) now about ſix and forty,
had with infinite philanthropy dedicated
her days to relieve the infirmities of her
fellow creatures without any other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
than that of being received in turn
at their houſes. She knew every receipt,
whether of diet or medicine, that could be
named, as preventative or cure; underſtood
the preparation of every quack remedy,
and the qualities of all the drugs of which
they are compounded: nor was ſhe leſs
acquainted with the human frame; and
would in all companies give the hiſtory of
any complaint to which it is ſubject in
technical terms, to the wonder of ſome
and the terror of many hearers. Such were
the manners of Mrs. Calder; and her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was one of thoſe, which but for their
ſingularity, nobody would ever recollect
as having ſeen at all. She now reſided
almoſt conſtantly with Lord and Lady
Caſtlenorth, to both of whom ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0206900201:86"/>
to render herſelf neceſſary. With
them ſhe had been abroad, (where ſhe had
greatly improved her ſtock of knowledge,
and had actually written a treatiſe on the
goitres of the Alpine peaſants, which Lady
Caſtlenorth was poliſhing for publication,)
and ſhe was now of the party who were
aſſembled at Mrs. Molyneux's; where the
laſt but not the leaſt in conſequence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
alſo—the deſtined bride of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby.</p>
            <p>The claim of this young lady to eminent
beauty, or to any thing more than a barely
tolerable perſon, would certainly not have
been allowed, had ſhe not been heireſs to
the illuſtrious houſe of Fitz-Hayman; but
the eſcutcheon of pretence, which ſhe had a
right to, ſeemed to give her a pretence alſo,
to much of what nature had very ſcantily
allowed her. She was as tall and almoſt
as large as her mother, whom ſhe greatly
reſembled. Her complexion was brown,
and as her hair was not dark, the want of
contraſt produced a muddy and heavy
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0206900201:87"/>
effect, which nothing could have relieved
but two dark eyes, whoſe powers were
aſſiſted by a greater quantity of rouge than
unmarried ladies are even by the French
cuſtoms uſually allowed. What expreſſion
they naturally had however was not pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and what they borrowed from this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
added more to their fierceneſs than
their luſtre. They were eyes of "high
claims and expectations," which demanded
rather than ſolicited admiration, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
pretty plainly the real diſpoſition of a
character, inflated with ideas of it's own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
and conſidering more than half
the world as beings of another ſpecies,
whoſe evils ſhe could not feel for, becauſe
ſhe was placed where it was impoſſible ſhe
could ever ſhare them.</p>
            <p>To the perſonal arrogance of her mother,
ſhe added the hereditary pride of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
the firſt had taught her that hardly
any man could deſerve ſo perfect and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
a creature; the ſecond, that it
was more deſirable to unite herſelf with
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0206900201:88"/>
Willoughby, and thus continue her own il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
race, than loſe or ſhare her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
by marrying a nobleman of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
rank. Some degree of perſonal partiality
too, contributed to render this reſolution
more pleaſing to her; for though ſhe had
not ſeen her couſin for between three and
four years, his graceful and beautiful form
when he left Eton, with his dark auburn
hair flowing over his ſhoulders, had made
a very laſting impreſſion in his favor.</p>

            <p>SUCH was the group, which, at a very
late hour in the evening, entered the din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room
of Mrs. Molyneux, who, with
her huſband and Celeſtina, received them
in the uſual forms. Lady Caſtlenorth, as
uſual, took the lead in converſation, having
firſt ſatisfied herſelf that Mrs. Molyneux
had ſent for Willoughby, and heard her
aſſurances that he would certainly be in
town the firſt moment he poſſibly could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hearing of the arrival of his noble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
            <p>"What ſort of taſte, my dear," cried
her Ladyſhip to Mrs. Molyneux, "is this
apartment fitted up in?—Is this the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſtyle in England?—I think it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
ugly."</p>
            <p>This was trenching on Matilda in a very
tender point. Taſte was her reigning foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0206900201:90"/>
and the houſe had, on her recent
marriage, been fitted up under her direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
at an immenſe expence. To have
her elegance called ſo abruptly in queſtion,
therefore, was very far from being pleaſant,
and ſhe anſwered coldly—"I am ſorry you
diſlike it: it is, I believe, the neweſt ſtyle
of doing rooms. To what does your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip
object?"</p>
            <p>"Oh, to the whole. Theſe ſort of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
are unclaſſical and glaring: I don't
like the colour of your furniture neither."</p>
            <p>"Nor I," interrupted Mrs. Calder; "'tis
terrible for the eyes: does not your Lordſhip
find it dazzling and inconvenient even by
candle-light?" She then began to explain
the effect of glaring and ſtrong colours on
the viſual orb, when Lady Caſtlenorth,
who had no intention to throw the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
into her hands, turned abruptly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Celeſtina, of whom ſhe had hitherto
taken no notice, and ſaid, looking ſteadily
at her while ſhe addreſſed Mrs. Molyneux,
"That, I think, is the young woman whom
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0206900201:91"/>
your late mother <hi>ſaid</hi> ſhe took out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
ſomewhere in France, is it not?"
Mrs.Molyneux anſwering in the affirmative,
Lady Caſtlenorth, her eyes ſtill fixed on
the object of her enquiry, ſaid, "Aye, I
thought I recollected her:—Umph!—and
ſo Mrs. Willoughby provided for her, did
ſhe?—Well! and is ſhe to live on with
you, as ſhe did in your mother's time?"</p>
            <p>"Only a few days longer, Madam," ſaid
Celeſtina, who had borne very impatiently
this rude and unfeeling ſcrutiny; "I am
then going to reſide entirely in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try."</p>
            <p>"I am glad of it, child," replied the
lady; for I always conſider it as a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
when girls are educated above their
fortune, and introduced into a ſtyle of life
they have no pretenſions to. Indeed, I
gave Mrs. Willoughby my opinion about
you repeatedly in your infancy. I did not
then know that her circumſtances allowed
her, in juſtice to <hi>her huſband's</hi> children, to
provide ſo amply for another. However,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0206900201:92"/>
though it was a great deal for her to do, it
is not by any means a fortune to authoriſe
you with prudence to continue to live
about town. You took, I think, your
Chriſtian name from the order of Nuns
among whom you were reared; and your
ſurname—I mean the name they gave
you—it has eſcaped me?"</p>
            <p>"My name, Madam," ſaid Celeſtina,
whoſe tears were reſtrained only by indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
"is De Mornay."</p>
            <p>"True; I recollect it now. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
I enquired of Mrs. Willoughby, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when they gave you that name they
had any reaſon to fancy you any way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to the family of the famous du Pleſſis
Mornay; but I think ſhe told me no, and
that you received that appellation becauſe
the Superior to whoſe care you were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted had ſome fanciful partiality to the
name."</p>
            <p>To this no anſwer being given the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
took another turn, but was ſtill
engroſſed by Lady Caſtlenorth; while Mrs.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0206900201:93"/>
Molyneux, wearied to death, propoſed cards,
and making a table with the noble pair,
Mrs. Calder, and her huſband, ſhe ſat
down herſelf by Miſs Fitz-Hayman, and
endeavoured to enter into converſation with
her.</p>
            <p>Miſs Fitz-Hayman however, who never
loved her couſin becauſe ſhe had heard her
reckoned handſome, and who was out of
humour to find that Willoughby was not
yet arrived, though there was barely time
for him to have come expreſs, received all
her advances with more than her uſual
haughty indifference; and while ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
in ſhort ſentences or mere mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllables,
ſhe now examined with looks of
diſlike the ſtudied but becoming dreſs of
Mrs. Molyneux, now, with yet more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant
expreſſion, glanced with averted
head, from the corners of her eyes, on Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
who without any ſtudy at all was
infinitely more beautiful.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſcowling looks of mingled malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and contempt, added to the behaviour
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0206900201:94"/>
of Lady Caſtlenorth towards her, had by
this time rendered the room ſo diſagreeable
to her, that ſhe left it as ſoon as ſhe could.
A loud rap at the door however ſoon after
announced the arrival of other viſitors; and
ſome ladies coming in who had finiſhed
their circle of viſits for that evening, Mrs.
Molyneux, as tired of the daughter's ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
as ſhe had before been of the mother's
loquacity, propoſed a table at <hi>vingt un,</hi>
which Celeſtina was immediately deſired to
join.</p>
            <p>The party were hardly placed at it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Mr. Molyneux was informed by his
gentleman that Mr. Willoughby was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and aſked to ſpeak to him. "Deſire
him to come up," replied he, without any
ſeeming conſciouſneſs of the formidable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the interview he was to go through.</p>
            <p>"He is in boots, Sir," replied the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
"and deſired me to ſay that he is
going immediately to his lodgings."</p>
            <p>"Oh but we ſhall not let him go,"
ſaid Molyneux. "Do Mrs. Molyneux,"
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0206900201:95"/>
continued he, addreſſing himſelf to his
wife, "do go down and bring up this
brother of your's."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Molyneux roſe and left the room.
Lady Caſtlenorth, ſtill appearing to attend
to her game, turned her fiercely-queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eyes, firſt on her daughter, who might
have bluſhed if her complexion had been
calculated to ſhew the ſuffuſion of blood,
and then unluckily they were attracted by
the more unequivocal and deep roſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
which for a moment took poſſeſſion
of the face of Celeſtina, who ſat next to her.</p>
            <p>There was no time to comment on this
appearance before it was heightened by the
entrance of Willoughby, who was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
led by his ſiſter to Lord Caſtlenorth,
then to her Ladyſhip, and at length to
Miſs Fitz-Hayman. He paid his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to all with his uſual graceful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
but not without an expreſſion of pain
and embarraſſment in his countenance,
which he ſeemed vainly trying to ſhake off.
He had yet diſtinguiſhed nobody in the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0206900201:96"/>
room but thoſe to whom he had been
ſpeaking; but on recovering from the low
bow he had made to Miſs Fitz-Hayman,
he ſaw Celeſtina; and ſtarting, he ſaid in
a hurrying way—"Miſs De Mornay! I
thought you had left my ſiſter! I hope I
ſee you well!" Celeſtina anſwered only by
a curtſey; and Willoughby, turning away
towards Mrs. Molyneux, told her that he
was a good deal fatigued, and muſt beg
her to excuſe him for the reſt of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but that he would be with her the
following morning to breakfaſt. "Your
Lordſhip," added he turning to his uncle,
"will perhaps allow me to pay my reſpects
to you and Lady Caſtlenorth in the courſe
of the morning:" then without waiting
for the reply which his Lordſhip was in
great form waiting to give him, he hurried
out of the room, and the card tables very
ſoon afterwards broke up.</p>
            <p>Though Willoughby was very much
altered ſince Miſs Fitz-Hayman had laſt
ſeen him, the change appeared greatly in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0206900201:97"/>
his favour. His undreſs, and the agitation
he was apparently in, which ſhe imputed
to the effect of her charms, combined to
make him appear more intereſting both to
the mother and daughter; and as they went
home, Lord Caſtlenorth, who grew every
day fonder of the propoſed marriage,
ſpoke much in praiſe of his nephew's fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
and manner. He has a great deal,
ſaid he, of the family countenance. He
ſtrikes me, indeed he always did from a
boy, as reſembling greatly the picture
painted on board of William, ſon of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Fitz-Hayman, Seneſchal to Henry II.
who obtained the grants of the eſtate in
Glouceſterſhire. His arms were azure, a
lion rampant, gardant or; the original
bearing of the family; you ſee it ſo in the
great window of the hall at Caſtlenorth:
the next is that of his wife, party per pale,
two griffins counter ſailant, ſable, langued
gules. This is my firſt quarter for the
name of Bigot, a daughter of which houſe,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0206900201:98"/>
this William, ſon of Robert, married."
Lord Caſtlenorth was now got on his
favourite topic, and in the numberleſs quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings
of his preſent bearing, he quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
the merits of his nephew, and was
buſied among wyverns and boars, pearls,
ſaltiers, feſſes and bend dexters, till they
arrived at their own houſe. The imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
however of the reſt of the company
finding nothing to arreſt them in a detail
ſo often repeated, had all left him to ſettle
his chevrons and chevronels his own way;
even the attentive and complaiſant Mrs.
Calder was conſidering whether a lady in
the company they had left, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
her complaints to her, was in a right
courſe of medicine; Lady Caſtlenorth was
laying up a little magazine of literature,
which ſhe intended to open on Willoughby
the next day; and her daughter was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
in her mind's eye, the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
perſon of Willoughby, the figure
they ſhould make at Court, and the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0206900201:99"/>
there would be, when without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading
herſelf, by an unequal alliance in
point of family, ſhe ſhould notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
carry to her huſband ſo ſplendid a
fortune, and titles ſo ancient and illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious.</p>

            <p>THE party the noble viſitors had left
were very differently employed: Mrs.
Molyneux, almoſt always accuſtomed to
be heard with attention and ſubmitted to
with deference as a beauty and a woman
of exquiſite taſte, was piqued and offended
by the air of ſuperior intelligence aſſumed
by Lady Caſtlenorth, who treated her like
a child that knew nothing. Miſs Fitz-Hayman
too had not expreſſed any admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
at her dreſs and figure, but had
viewed her with ſupercilious ſilence; while
Mrs. Calder, from knowing her to be a
young married woman, had with more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
than elegance enquired whether ſhe
was likely to give the Molyneux family
the heir ſo much deſired by the older part
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0206900201:101"/>
of it; a queſtion which extremely diſguſted
her. Lord Caſtlenorth, (who had compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
her upon her perſon, particularly
on her long Chineſe eyes, and the form of
her face, which he ſaid was extremely like
that of Gertrude Fitz-Hayman, ſome time
Maid of Honor to Catharine of Arragon and
afterwards Counteſs of Powis,) was, ſhe
declared to Mr. Molyneux, the only tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
creature of the party. "My uncle,"
ſaid ſhe, as ſoon as they were alone, "my
uncle is a reaſonable being; but for the
reſt! did you ever ſee a plainer woman
than Miſs Fitz-Hayman? her cloaths might
be French, but I am ſure ſhe looks abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
Dutch in them. It's really a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
at her time of life to be ſo large."</p>
            <p>Molyneux careleſsly anſwered—"You
ſee ſhe is ſenſible of the misfortune by her
endeavours to conceal it: but 'tis more
witty than wiſe, I think, to find fault with
her. Willoughby <hi>can ſee</hi> I ſuppoſe as well
as you can, and I don't think it very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic
in you to give him your authority for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0206900201:102"/>
diſliking her. Let him marry her, and
then hate and abuſe her as much as you
will."</p>
            <p>"Oh!" replied the lady, "I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
deteſt her, and—"</p>
            <p>"So I dare ſay will he," interrupted
Molyneux; "but let them be once mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and all that is very immaterial to you:
it is by no means ſo, that your brother
cannot, till he does marry, pay the ſecond
five thouſand pounds of your fortune, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
he ſells the Withcombe eſtate, which
indeed the mortgagee is, as far as I can
learn, very impatient to take poſſeſſion of
with this charge upon it, which he will
immediately pay off. You ſee that Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
has no choice—matrimony or the
diſmembering his eſtates; and pray never
put it into his head to heſitate." This af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
brother in law then went to his
own dreſſing room, and Mrs. Molyneux
taking a candle, ſurveying herſelf in the
great glaſs, and wondering how it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſuch a figure and face could fail to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0206900201:103"/>
univerſal admiration from all ages and
ſexes, retired to her bed.</p>
            <p>The contemplations of poor Celeſtina,
who had left them the moment the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
diſperſed, were much more painful.
The ſight of Willoughby, his ſurprize, and,
as ſhe thought, his diſpleaſure at finding
her ſtill there, were as poiſoned arrows in
her breaſt. But the pride of conſcious
worth, aided by her diſintereſted affection
for him, enabled her, though not to heal,
yet to endure without weak complainings,
the exquiſite pain they inflicted, and to give
her courage immediately to execute the
deſign ſhe had long formed of withdrawing
herſelf from his ſight for ever. It was now
impoſſible for her to ſet out the next day,
but that immediately following it ſhe fixed
for her departure; and after a night in which
ſhe enjoyed very little repoſe, ſhe aroſe
early in order to make the immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
for her journey, which ſhe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
in order to ſave expence, to make
in the Exeter ſtage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0206900201:104"/>
As ſhe was deſirous of giving as little
trouble as poſſible to Mr. Molyneux's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
who were all people of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and would any of them have
thought ſuch a commiſſion degrading, ſhe
determined to go herſelf into the city,
where places were to be taken. It was yet
ſo early when ſhe went down to execute
this intention, that only the houſemaid was
ſtirring, and the windows of the parlour
only were opened: there Celeſtina ſat
while the maid went into the kitchen to
get her a glaſs of milk and water, which
ſhe had aſked for; and while ſhe yet trifled
with it, being indeed afraid to venture into
the ſtreets till ſhe ſaw more people in them,
ſhe heard the ſervant, who was at the door
duſting the hall and ſteps, ſpeak to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
who entered, and the inſtant after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Willoughby came into the room
where ſhe was.</p>
            <p>She aroſe trembling and amazed from
her ſeat. "Miſs De Mornay," ſaid he,
"ſo early prepared to go out?" Celeſtina
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0206900201:105"/>
anſwered—"yes," and ſat down again.
He laid down his hat on the ſide board;
and as if he knew not what to ſay, went to
the window.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina ſat motionleſs; and Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
after ſtanding there a moment, ſeemed
aſhamed of his ſilence yet afraid to ſpeak.
He traverſed the room, mended the fire,
and complaining of the cold, at length
ventured to enquire of Celeſtina what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
her to venture out at ſo early an
hour of ſo unpleaſant a morning? She
replied calmly, for ſhe had by this time
regained her compoſure, that ſhe had buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the city.</p>
            <p>"Buſineſs in the city!" cried Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby;
"and at this time of the day!
Ah! Celeſtina! there was a time when you
would not thus have anſwered my enquiry."
He was going on, when Celeſtina inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
him:</p>
            <p>"There was indeed," ſaid ſhe with a
deep ſigh, "a time when you would not
have made it."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0206900201:106"/>
"Not have made it!" anſwered he;
"was I not then ever intereſted in all that
concerned you, and was any action of
your's indifferent to me?"</p>
            <p>He faultered and ſtopped. "I was once
ſimple enough to think ſo indeed," ſaid
Celeſtina, "and in thoſe days of fortunate
illuſion you certainly would have made no
ſuch enquiry as the preſent, becauſe I
ſhould then have done nothing of which
you would not have known the motive,
nor have taken any meaſure without the
concurrence of my brother and my friend;
but as you told me yourſelf—would I could
forget it!—that it was no longer in your
power to retain thoſe characters towards
me, I am learning to forget that I ever
was ſo happy as to fancy that no change in
my ſituation, eſpecially a change for the
worſe, could rob me of that regard ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
always, ſo particularly valuable now!"</p>
            <p>"Gracious heaven!" cried Willoughby,
entirely thrown off his guard by her words
and manner—"How have I acted, what
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0206900201:107"/>
have I ſaid, to deſerve this reproach from
you Celeſtina? When we parted laſt—"</p>
            <p>She again interrupted him—"Did we
part like friends? like brother and ſiſter?"</p>
            <p>"No," replied he haſtily; "but I tore
myſelf from you like a man who ſacrifices,
to the performance of a fatal promiſe, his
own happineſs, and who is the victim of
family pride and family neceſſity." This
ſentence was deciſive. His reſolution for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
him at once, and his long ſtifled af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
burſt through all the reſtraints he
determined to lay on it. "Oh! Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina!"
continued he, "you whom I loved
before I knew what it was to love! you
whom I now adore with a paſſion too ſtrong
for my reaſon! do not, do not, I beſeech
you, aggravate my ſufferings. I promiſed
to my mother—and you know how well
ſhe deſerved to be obeyed—I promiſed to
unite myſelf with her niece; I promiſed to
extirpate from my heart an inclination that
even then I could not conceal. Raſh and
ridiculous promiſe! No, Celeſtina, it is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0206900201:108"/>
impoſſible for me to ceaſe loving you!
All my behaviour, which you have thought
cold and unfriendly, was a part I was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in oppoſition to my real affections! I
can ſuſtain it no longer: I cannot bear
that you ſhould think of me with indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
and yet—Oh! my mother, what
a cruel taſk have you impoſed on me!
Celeſtina, pity me; I am more wretched
than you can imagine!" His agitation
now became too violent: he ſeized the
hand of Celeſtina, and fervently kiſſed it,
while her own ſenſations were ſuch as no
language can deſcribe. That Willoughby
loved her, that what ſhe had conſidered as
indifference was owing to the ſtruggle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his duty and his tenderneſs, was
tranſport ſuch as obliterated every other
ſentiment. But this delirium laſted but a
moment: her reaſon, her genuine affection
for him, told her, that to indulge this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
was injurious to him, and ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to ſhew that ſhe could ſacrifice
herſelf to his advantage, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0206900201:109"/>
with his brotherly attachment, ſhe
could reſign him to the fortunate Miſs
Fitz-Hayman. The terms however in
which ſhe declared this, the ſoftneſs of her
voice, and her eyes filled with tears, were
little calculated to reconcile Willoughby
to the reſolution, which, after a long dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
ſhe urged him to adopt; ſhe aſſured
him that whatever might be her own fate,
ſhe ſhould never forgive herſelf were ſhe
to be the means of his breaking a promiſe
ſo ſolemnly given, and given at ſuch a
time, to her dear deceaſed benefactreſs.
"No! my brother," ſaid ſhe, "ſhe is
dead, but my obligations to her can never
be annihilated; and what would become
of me, were I ever to feel myſelf reproached
for ingratitude to her memory, were I to
deſtroy the fabric ſhe had raiſed for the
happineſs of her beloved ſon, and to fancy
that the ſpirit of my more than mother,
which I now often invocate with conſcious
pleaſure, ſhould, inſtead of beholding her
Celeſtina with complacency not unſuited
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0206900201:110"/>
to her preſent ſtate of happineſs, ſee her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded
into a ſelfiſh and unworthy being,
who repays her benefits with the blackeſt
ingratitude."</p>
            <p>Willoughby, whoſe love, once ſuffered
to obtain the advantage, now acquired
more power every moment, combated theſe
objections with very dangerous eloquence;
telling Celeſtina that he had determined the
evening before, on a ſight of Miſs Fitz-Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who was inſupportable to him, to put
an end to the negociation, and ſay plainly
to his uncle that it was impoſſible for him
to fulfil an engagement in which his heart
never had any ſhare. Celeſtina repreſented
to him the ſituation of his fortune; the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
neceſſity there was for his marrying
one who could repair its deficiency, and
reſtore him to the ſplendid affluence of his
anceſtors; but for this he talked of oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
and ſimplicity, by which when they
lived entirely at Alveſtone he ſhould be
able to repair every thing; then for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
indulging his vivid imagination in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0206900201:111"/>
painting the happineſs they ſhould enjoy
there together, (images of felicity which
reflected in ſtronger colours thoſe which
Celeſtina had a thouſand times formed,
though knowing they could never be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized,)
he thought ſuddenly of the fatal
promiſe he had given to his mother, and
his heart ſeemed to ſhrink from the idea
of breaking it to obtain even the higheſt
human happineſs, which under ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
he felt would be daſhed with
gall. He obtained however from Celeſtina,
but not without difficulty, a promiſe that
ſhe would lay aſide her intentions of going
into the city that morning to prepare for
her journey, of which he would not hear;
and ſhe prevailed upon him to wait on Lord
Caſtlenorth, as he had aſſured the family
he would do: "Though wherefore ſhould
I do it," ſaid he, "unleſs to put an end at
once and for ever to all thoughts of this
odious marriage."</p>
            <p>"You ought ſurely," replied Celeſtina,
to wait on the brother of your mother tho'
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0206900201:112"/>
no ſuch connection had been thought of:
and no diſlike which you may have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to Miſs Fitz-Hayman as your wife,
ſhould induce you to forget what you owe
to your uncle.</p>
            <p>By arguments thus reaſonable, Celeſtina,
while ſhe prevailed on Willoughby to do
what was, he was forced to own, proper,
would have rivetted his chains, if indeed
they had not already been immoveable.
The noble candour and diſintereſted gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity
of her ſoul, gave tenfold force to the
charms of her perſon, which ſince he had
laſt ſeen her, Willoughby thought greatly
improved: and the tenderneſs of her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the certainty of her affection for him,
which ſhe tried to conceal with more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
than ſucceſs, had altogether ſuch an
effect on him, that nothing but the fatal
promiſe which lay ſo heavy on his heart,
could have prevented his marrying her
immediately, in deſpite of every conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of prudence or family engagement.</p>

         <div n="7" type="chapter">
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0206900201:113"/>
            <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
            <p>WHILE Celeſtina remained with Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
the very tumult and agitation of
her heart had ſuſtained her courage, and
like a fever that lends momentary ſtrength
to the patient it is deſtroying, this diſorder
of her ſpirits had ſupported her againſt the
flood of tenderneſs that overwhelmed her
as ſoon as ſhe was alone. A conflict then
began between her affection for him and
her duty and gratitude towards the memory
of his mother, which was almoſt too ſevere
to be endured; but however ſoft her heart,
her reaſon was equal to the taſk of check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a dangerous or guilty indulgence of
that ſenſibility; and after long arguing
with herſelf, ſhe found ſhe loved Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
better than every thing but his honor
and his repoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0206900201:114"/>
The firſt, and too probably the ſecond,
ſhe ſaw too plainly that he muſt forfeit, by
yielding to an affection, which, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced
as he was, would perhaps be as
fatal to both as it certainly was to his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary
intereſt. She had heard Mr. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneux
ſay, who had his reaſons for repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it before her, that nothing but his
marrying a woman as opulent as Miſs Fitz-Hayman
could prevent his ſelling the
greater part of his eſtates; "and in that
caſe," added he, "I don't ſee how he can
avoid diſpoſing of Alveſton too; for with
the income he will then have, to think of
keeping up ſuch a place as that, would be
quite inſanity." Celeſtina knew that no
blow could fall ſo heavy on the heart of
Willoughby, as the cruel neceſſity of ſelling
this his paternal ſeat; and though ſhe was
flattered and delighted when he had juſt
before declared to her, that to obtain her
every deprivation would be eaſy, ſhe knew,
while ſhe now more coolly reflected on it,
his local attachment to be ſo ſtrong, that it
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0206900201:115"/>
was very probable his love would ſoon
yield to the regret which would ariſe from
their ſacrifice. "What would become of
me," ſaid ſhe as ſhe meditated on this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
"were I to be the wife of Willoughby,
and to ſee him unhappy that I was ſo? He
would have broken his faith to his mother;
he who has always been taught to hold the
ſlighteſt promiſe ſacred; he would ſee his
eſtate diſmembered; even Alveſton, the
place he ſo loves, would paſs into the hands
of ſtrangers, and it would be to me he
would owe his indigence and his unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!
How dare I ſuppoſe that my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
warm and ſincere as it is, could
make him any amends for all thoſe morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.
Oh! let me not ſuppoſe it, nor
ever think of riſking it. I can bear to quit
him now—I believe I can—but how ſhould
I endure to find myſelf the ſource of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
to him! how ſhould I ever ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
ſeeing him decidedly unhappy, with
the conſciouſneſs that he owed his being ſo
to his partiality for me."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0206900201:116"/>
Theſe reflections, and above all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
by which he had bound himſelf to
obey the laſt injunctions of his mother, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
Celeſtina as to the conduct ſhe
ought to adopt; and having once ſeen it
by the light lent by integrity and diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
love to her ſtrong and excellent
underſtanding, ſhe haſtened to execute it,
and certain that he was engaged for the reſt
of the morning, ſhe had no ſooner break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſted
than ſhe told Mrs. Molyneux ſhe
was going to make ſome purchaſes for
which ſhe had occaſion before ſhe left Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and getting into an hackney coach,
was driven into the City, where ſhe ſecured
a place in the Exeter ſtage, which was to
leave London at a very early hour the
next day. She returned to the houſe of
Mrs. Molyneux about twelve o'clock, and
then learned, that ſhe and her huſband were
engaged to dine at Lord Caſtlenorth's,
where a very large party were to aſſemble.
In the card which Lady Caſtlenorth had
ſent to invite them, no mention was made
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0206900201:117"/>
of Celeſtina nor was any ſeparate card ſent
to her. "It is mere forgetfulneſs I fancy,"
ſaid Mrs. Molyneux as ſhe mentioned it to
her: "you will go however, as the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of an invitation is not very material."</p>
            <p>"Pardon me," replied Celeſtina, "it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to me of ſo much conſequence in the
preſent caſe, that I certainly ſhall not go
without it. I am indeed very glad to be
excuſed, and I am ſure you will not urge
me to violate etiquette in a matter where
to forbear doing it is ſo particularly deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Molyneux, very ſolicitous about
the contents of certain band boxes with
which her woman entered at that moment,
forbore to preſs her farther, and Celeſtina
deſiring her to let her know when ſhe was
dreſſed, that ſhe might ſee her before ſhe
went, retired to her own room, leaving her
friend to the pleaſing and important occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the toilet, in which half what is
now called morning, was uſually paſſed by
Matilda.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0206900201:118"/>
Celeſtina had promiſed Willoughby to
give up for that day her intention of fixing
her journey; but this promiſe ſhe thought
herſelf well juſtified in breaking. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
at Lord Caſtlenorth's was given
on his account: of courſe he would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
the whole day; and ſince ſhe muſt
go, ſhe deſired nothing ſo much as to be
ſpared the fruitleſs pain of a farther diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the ſubject, and the miſery, which
ſhe was not ſure her reſolution would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
of bidding him a laſt farewel.</p>
            <p>At a little after five however, after ſhe
had undergone the form of ſitting down
alone to table, where ſhe eat nothing, and
had then retired to her own room, Mrs.
Willoughby's woman came to ſay that her
miſtreſs was dreſſed. Celeſtina had once
determined to tell Mrs. Molyneux how
ſoon ſhe meant to quit her, and to have
taken leave of her, but on reflection ſhe
thought her doing ſo might betray her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to Willoughby, from whom it was
neceſſary to conceal it till it was actually
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0206900201:119"/>
executed. She now therefore intended to
leave a letter of thanks, and to take leave
of Mrs. Molyneux as if it was only till the
next day.</p>
            <p>But when the moment approached in
which ſhe was in reality to bid adieu—per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
for ever—to the friend and companion
of her infancy—to the daughter of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
friend—to the ſiſter of Willoughby—her
heart ſunk within her; and hardly had
ſhe ſtrength to go to the door of Mrs. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneux's
dreſſing room, on opening which
ſhe ſaw her friend ſtanding before the glaſs
putting the laſt finiſh to her very elegant
dreſs, while with her eyes fixed on her
own figure, ſhe was arguing with more
than her uſual warmth with ſome perſon
who ſat beſide her, and who Celeſtina pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
diſcovered to be Willoughby him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
in boots, and his hair out of powder.
His countenance was pale and dejected;
and while his ſiſter talked to him he leaned
with one arm on another chair, and ſeemed
rather muſing than attending.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0206900201:120"/>
"I am glad you are come," ſaid Mrs.
Molyneux to Celeſtina as ſhe entered,
"for here is George behaving quite ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly:
he will not go he ſays to Lord
Caſtlenorth's, though the dinner is made
on purpoſe for him. Do Celeſtina—he
minds your opinion always more than
mine—do try to make him underſtand
how very abſurd and odly he acts."</p>
            <p>"I have no talents," Celeſtina would
have ſaid but the words died away on her
lips; and before ſhe could collect courage
to finiſh the ſentence, Molyneux, who
was now ready, came in, and ſeeing Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
unprepared to go, expreſſed his
ſurprize in terms which were warmer than
Willoughby could hear with perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of temper. "Surely Sir," ſaid he,
"I am my own maſter. I am not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to go, and I will not go!"</p>
            <p>"And what am I to ſay," cried Mrs.
Molyneux, "to Lady Caſtlenorth, to my
uncle, and to my couſin?"</p>
            <p>"Juſt what you pleaſe," replied he.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0206900201:121"/>
Molyneux, finding by the tone in
which his brother in law ſpoke, that he
would not be dictated to, now called his
wife out of the room, and Willoughby and
Celeſtina were leſt alone.</p>
            <p>It was now that all her fortitude and
ſtrength of mind were neceſſary. Her duty
evidently was to perſuade Willoughby to
accompany his ſiſter and to complete a
marriage which his mother had when dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enjoined: a marriage ſo neceſſary to
the acquiſition of all that the world calls
happineſs in life, and on which depended
the continuance of his family eſtate in his
poſſeſſion. But her heart refuſed to aſſent
to what her reaſon pointed out as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
ſhe ought to purſue, and the affection
he now ſo evidently had for her, adding
to the ſtrength of her long attachment to
him, ſhe found it impoſſible to urge his
quitting her for ever, though ſhe thought
ſhe had yet courage enough to tear herſelf
from him if ſhe heard not his complaints
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0206900201:122"/>
nor witneſſed his agonies while ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
her own.</p>
            <p>"I cannot—I will not go to theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,"
ſaid Willoughby after a ſhort ſilence:
why ſhould I? ſince to marry Miſs Fitz-Hayman
would be the height of cruelty to
her—ſince I am incapable of diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—ſince—In
ſhort, Celeſtina, I feel
it to be impoſſible for me to live with
her—to live without you; and I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to declare myſelf in writing to
that effect."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, whom this ſpeech was not
calculated to calm, anſwered, trembling—"Indeed
I think you wrong, Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby.
As your uncle, as your mother's
brother, Lord Caſtlenorth has undoubtedly
a claim to this mark of reſpect. It is not
probably expected to be any thing more
than a viſit of form, and ſurely you ought
not rudely and without reaſon to decline it."</p>
            <p>"If it <hi>were indeed</hi> meant only as a viſit
of ceremony," ſaid he—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0206900201:123"/>
"It is in your power however," inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Celeſtina, "to appear to conſider
it ſo: your not going muſt ſeem very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary;
your going certainly leads to
no conſequence."</p>
            <p>"If you think ſo," replied Willoughby;
if you think I ought to go.—But why did
they not aſk you?"</p>
            <p>"Why ſhould they aſk me?" anſwered
ſhe. "I am almoſt unknown to Lady Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north;
and in the little time I ever did ſee
her, I appeared to be no favourite. Believe
me, ſo far from being diſpleaſed I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced
at the omiſſion."</p>
            <p>"Inſolent, odious woman!" cried Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby.
"If any thing could add to
my diſlike of her and her daughter, it
would be the ſupercilious airs they gave
themſelves towards you even in the ſhort
moment I ſaw them here. But my Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
ſhall never be expoſed to their inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingſcorn;
and if I myſelf this time undergo
the puniſhment of keeping up the hateful
farce which I have ſo unhappily been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0206900201:124"/>
in, it ſhall be with a determination
to put an end to it."</p>
            <p>At this moment Mr. and Mrs. Molyneux
entered the room; and Celeſtina wiſhing
them all an agreeable day, left it; having
ſuſtained with ſome difficulty the various
emotions which were contending in her
boſom. Willoughby ſoon after left the
houſe, to dreſs at his own lodgings, which
were in the neighbourhood, and having
promiſed to join his brother and ſiſter at
dinner, they ſoon after departed themſelves,
much better ſatisfied with him than they
were before his ſhort converſation with
Celeſtina.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
            <p>CELESTINA, though more unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
than ever to go, had preſcribed to
herſelf in her cooler moments a line of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
from which, feeling it her duty to
adhere to it, ſhe now determined not to
depart. In arguing with herſelf on it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
and ſtrengthening her faultering
reſolution, ſhe paſſed the night. At four
o'clock the ſervant who was commiſſioned
to awaken her, came to her door: ſhe aroſe
and dreſſed herſelf by candle-light: the
morning was cold and dark: every object
appeared dreary and forlorn: ſhe hurried
on her cloaths however, and endeavoured
to drive away every recollection that might
enfeeble her ſpirits too much; but, as ſhe
paſſed the door of the drawing room, ſhe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0206900201:126"/>
remembered that it was there ſhe had ſeen
Willoughby perhaps for the laſt time, and
almoſt involuntarily ſhe went in, and by
the light of her ſolitary candle, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated
a whole length picture of him which
had juſt been finiſhed for his ſiſter: the
likeneſs was ſo ſtrong, that by the waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and uncertain light that fell upon it,
ſhe almoſt fancied he was about to ſpeak to
her: ſhe ſtarted at the idea, and feeling a
fort of chilly terror at the ſilence and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity
of every thing around her, ſhe
turned away and haſtened to the ſervant
who had prepared her tea in the parlour:
ſhe had however hardly time to drink it,
before the hackney coach which had been
ordered the night before was at the door;
and having ſeen what little baggage ſhe
had not before ſent put into it, ſhe ſtepped
in herſelf, and was ſoon at a diſtance from
the reſidence of Mrs. Molyneux, from the
friend of her early years, and was launched
alone and unprotected into a world of
which ſhe had yet ſeen nothing but through
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0206900201:127"/>
the favourable medium lent by affluence
and proſperity to thoſe who from thence
contemplate difficulties they are never
likely to encounter and calamities they
probably never can participate.</p>
            <p>That a young woman, who might ſtill
have enjoyed thoſe indulgences, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them at an age when they have ſo
many charms; that Celeſtina, who had
been educated with ſo much delicacy, and
accuſtomed ſince her firſt recollection: to
every indulgence, ſhould thus voluntarily
enter on a life of comparative hardſhip
and deprivation, may appear improbable,
but when it is added that ſhe quitted the
man to whom ſhe had ſo long been fondly
attached, and leaving him to her fortunate
rival, devoted herſelf to a life of ſolitude
and regret, ſuch an effort of heroiſm in a
woman not yet quite nineteen, might be
claſſed among impoſſibilities, were it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
of any other than Celeſtina: but her
character was an uncommon one: though
ſhe had always been told by Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0206900201:128"/>
that her birth was very uncertain,
and that nothing was known of it but that
it was diſgraceful to her parents, ſince they
had taken ſuch pains to conceal it, ſhe felt
within herſelf a conſciouſneſs of hereditary
worth, an innate pride, which would never
ſuffer her to believe herſelf deſcended from
mean or unworthy perſons: her open and
commanding countenance, where ſat dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
mingled with ſweetneſs; her nymph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
and graceful form, which might have
rivalled the models of Grecian art; were
advantages of which, though ſhe was not
vain of them, ſhe could not be inſenſible,
and if ſhe had any foible, (a perfect cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
it has been ſaid muſt not be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
becauſe it cannot exiſt) if ſhe had
any foible, it was carrying a little too far,
though ſhe carefully concealed it, that ſort
of pride which ſeemed born with her, and
which, after all that has been ſaid againſt
it, is often, eſpecially in a young and
beautiful woman, a fortunate defect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0206900201:129"/>
The circumſtances of her birth had ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
been touched upon in the family, for
it was a topic which could not but be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to her: but if ever any thing relating to
it had been accidentally introduced, when
Mrs. Willoughby was converſing with her
three children, (as ſhe often termed Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
Matilda, and Celeſtina,) Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
would ſay laughingly that it was
impoſſible ſhe could be born of French
parents: his mother had been ſometimes
half angry at this aſſertion, in which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he uſually perſiſted, aſſerting, with
prejudice that ſhe declared to be entirely
Engliſh, that no native of the South of
France ever had a complexion or a form
like her's. After ſhe grew up, though
theſe perfections became more eminent,
Willoughby never appeared to notice them;
with the improvement of her form, her
mind kept pace; and as it acquired every
day more ſtrength, ſhe gradually became
more ſenſible of her obligation to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactreſs;
but while ſhe indulged her gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0206900201:130"/>
towards the friend on whom ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended,
ſhe felt that ſhe was not born to be
dependent.</p>
            <p>This elevation of ſpirit now ſupported
her; and the conſciouſneſs ſhe was acting
right, blunted for a while the poignancy of
that pain which ſhe too ſenſibly felt in tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
herſelf from Willoughby. Obliged to
act for herſelf, having no breaſt on which
ſhe could with propriety lean, her naturally
exalted ſoul acquired new firmneſs, before
which trifling inconveniences diſappeared;
and with an heart occupied by the beloved
image of Willoughby, and the ſacrifice
ſhe was making for him, ſhe hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered
that ſhe had never in her life
been in a ſtage coach before, till ſhe found
herſelf ſeated in one under the dark gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of an inn in the city at five o'clock in a
dreary winter morning.</p>
            <p>Two female paſſengers had already taken
their places; one of whom expreſſed great
anxiety for a number of hat boxes and cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van
trunks which the people belonging to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0206900201:131"/>
the inn were placing in different parts of
the coach, while the lady particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to their care one box, which
ſhe aſſured them contained her new <hi>laylock</hi>
bonnet, an article for the ſafety of which
ſhe was ſo ſolicitous that ſhe would have
taken the great machine in which it was
contained into the coach, had it not been
oppoſed by the coachman, and preſently
after by a man who had been drinking
with him, and who now preparing to enter
the coach, proteſted vehemently againſt
this whim of his ſiſter Mary's.—"Who
d'ye think will be ſcroughed and crammed
up," cried he, "with your confounded
trumpery? No, no ſuch thing. Here Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,
prythee take and ſtow it ſomewhere
or another: it ſhall not enter the coach,
I'll be ſworn."</p>
            <p>The man then placed himſelf by the ſide
of the other female paſſenger, oppoſite to
Celeſtina, and appeared to be as anxious
for his own eaſe as his ſiſter was for the
ſafety of her wardrobe. The coach moved
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0206900201:132"/>
on, but it was ſtill quite dark, and ſilence
prevailed for the firſt four or five miles, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
only by ſome fretful expreſſions
from the lady of the bandboxes, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
to which people were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by going in ſtage coaches, and ſome
exclamations againſt the unfortunate damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the morning, which ſhe declared
would certainly penetrate the covering and
entirely ſpoil her <hi>laylock</hi> bonnet, which ſhe
ſaid coſt her three guineas.</p>
            <p>"The more fool you," cried her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was of a character Celeſtina had
never had an opportunity of ſeeing before,
that of a country tradeſman affecting to be
a wit and a buck—"the more fool you, ſiſter
Mary. What! d'ye think a three guinea
bonnet will make you look three years
younger? No, no, take my word for it,
your flounces, and fringes, and furbelows
ſerve for no purpoſe at all but to ſhew your
wrinkles."</p>
            <p>"Wrinkles!" repeated the lady diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully,
"what do you mean, John
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0206900201:133"/>
Jedwyn? I declare you are ſo rude and
diſagreeable I always repent travelling
with you. I wiſh you would find out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſubject."</p>
            <p>"Egad," anſwered Jedwyn, "I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have a worſe than your wrinkles, that's
true enough; and upon my ſoul," added
he, looking confidently in the face of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
and then in that of the other female
paſſenger, who, though pale and thin, was
very young and very pretty, "here <hi>is</hi> two
better ſubjects, one aſide of me and t'other
oppoſite: no, no, ſiſter of mine, now day
breaks a little, and lets a body ſee how the
land lays, you'll hear no more about your
wrinkles; for as Hamlet ſays—let me ſee—aye—"here's
that metal that's more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive;
hey, Miſs?"</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, to whom this hey Miſs was
addreſſed, who had till now been very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
aware of the ſpecies of rudeneſs and
impertinence to which her mode of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
might ſubject her, was ſhocked
and alarmed at this addreſs from a perſon,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0206900201:134"/>
who, had he ſeen her a few days before,
would have approached her with awe and
ſpoken to her with diſſidence. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
ſilent however, caſting a look on
the man ſufficiently expreſſive of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
ſhe felt for him: but he was not of
a humour to be eaſily daunted or repulſed,
and without ſeeming to underſtand her,
began, with purſe-proud pertneſs to relate
as if it was a narrative which all the world
ſhould be informed of, that he was a gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
and chandler at Exeter, in a very flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
trade, and in partnerſhip with a
gentleman who had married one of his
ſiſters: "and this <hi>laylock</hi> bonnet lady,"
continued he, "is my eldeſt ſiſter, who
has been a <hi>wiſiting</hi> this half year and better
an old aunt of our's at Camberwell. She
is an old maid herſelf, but deviliſh rich,
and from a ſort of fellow feeling you know
ſhe intends to make our Mary here her
heir. The old girl muſt hop the perch
ſoon, or all her money won't get her dear
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0206900201:135"/>
niece a huſband it's my opinion, unleſs
may be an Iriſhman or a ſtrolling player."</p>
            <p>This ſecond attack on herſelf, and his
viſible admiration of Celeſtina's beauty,
compleated the ill humour of his ſiſter, who
with a look where anger and ſcorn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for preeminence, remained ſilently
ſwelling, while the facetious trader again
addreſſed himſelf to Celeſtina.</p>
            <p>"What do you never make talking?
Come, ſince now you have a hiſtory of me,
let's hear a little who you are, and where
you are bound to?"</p>
            <p>"Sir," replied Celeſtina, "it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that either can be of any conſequence
to you."</p>
            <p>"How are you ſure of that?" cried Mr.
Jedwyn with a loud laugh: "now I
think nothing is more likely than that we
may be better acquainted. 'Tis nothing
now I believe for a young man of ſpirit, as
well in the world as I am, to take a fancy
to a pretty woman."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0206900201:136"/>
"A fancy!" exclaimed Miſs Mary
Jedwyn, with great acrimony—"a fancy!
Jack Jedwyn I am amazed at you!"</p>
            <p>"And why amazed, my ancient ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter?"
retorted he. "What the devil! I'm
my own maſter I hope. To be ſure you
are ſome fifteen or twenty years older than
me. But what of that?—So much the
worſe for you. I hope I a'nt to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by a duenna. What a plague,
mayn't I talk to a handſome girl I wonder
without your putting in your ſquinnygut
opinion?"</p>
            <p>"If you intend to inſult me," anſwered
the lady, trying to hide under the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of calm contempt her great diſpoſition
to cry:—"if you intend to inſult me, I
am ſure I heartily wiſh I had got the better
of my fears and travelled alone in a poſt
<hi>cbai;</hi> for no rudeneſs as I might have met
on the road could be worſe than your's."</p>
            <p>"That's your gratitude now, cried Jed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn,
for my coming up clear from Exeter
to fetch you at a time when I had no
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0206900201:137"/>
buſineſs in London nor ſhould a had for
theſe ſix weeks: that's your thanks for my
kindneſs, and for liſtening to your nonſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
fears and frights. Rude to you! oh
Lord! as if any mortal man who has eyes
would ever look at you twice. No Mary!
make yourſelf eaſy; that weazen, winterly
viſage of your's, is fafeguard enough if you
were to travel from here to Jericho."</p>
            <p>He then began to mimic his ſiſter, and
enlarge on the terrors to which ſhe was, he
ſaid, perpetually ſubject, leſt ſome ſad
daring rake of a man ſhould carry her away:
and had he been leſs groſs and diſguſting,
Celeſtina would hardly have forborne a
ſmile at ſome part of the ludicrous repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
he gave of this apprehenſive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy
and trembling nicety, for which ſhe
could not, in the perſonal attractions of
Miſs Jedwyn, find any reaſonable grounds;
for ſhe was very tall, very thin, and very
yellow: her long, ſcraggy neck, appeared
hardly adequate to the ſupport of a head,
where art had ſo redundantly been called
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0206900201:138"/>
in aid of nature, that it ſeemed to abound
in ſhining black hair, nicely curled, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
powder, which was ſuffered to wanton
over her forehead and flow down her back,
while a little white beaver hat, perched on
one ſide, was meant to give to her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
that bewitching archneſs which ſhe
had obſerved that mode of head dreſs to
beſtow on the young and lovely.</p>
            <p>Mr. Jedwyn having exhauſted all his
immediate ſtock of wit on his ſiſter, now
left her to digeſt the indignation he had
raiſed, and applied himſelf again to Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina.
Having no idea that any thing but
money beſtowed conſequence, and having
lived the greater part of his time among
thoſe who had leſs of it than himſelf, he
had never been accuſtomed to allow of any
ſuperiority, nor could he comprehend how
a young woman ſo humbly ſituated in life,
as to travel in a ſtage coach, could help
being charmed into liking by his wit, and
awed into complaiſance by his importance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0206900201:139"/>
On ſuch a man the native dignity of
Celeſtina failed totally of it's uſual effect.
He became more and more troubleſome;
for he was piqued but not repreſſed by the
coldneſs and even contempt of her manner.
He told her, among much other imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
that all her ſhyneſs ſhould not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him from finding out who ſhe was;
and then with yet more offenſive familiarity
addreſſed himſelf to the other young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who he thought belonged to her, and
who heard his converſation with terror and
diſlike as great as that of Celeſtina.</p>
            <p>His behaviour at length becoming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportably
uneaſy to her, Celeſtina, when
the coach reached the village where they
were to breakfaſt, determined not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
herſelf to it any longer; ſhe therefore
ordered her tea to be carried into another
room, and a poſt chaiſe to be ready as ſoon
as ſhe had drank it.</p>
            <p>As ſhe ſat at her breakfaſt, ſhe ſaw the
young woman, whoſe countenance had
greatly intereſted her, walk by the window
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0206900201:140"/>
ſlowly and dejectedly, one hand held to her
forehead, and an handkerchief in the other.
Ever ready to aſſiſt the unhappy, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
heart of Celeſtina was touched with
compaſſion towards this forlorn ſtranger.
"She is as young as I am," ſaid ſhe, "and
perhaps even more unfortunate. Why
ſhould I not take her with <hi>me,</hi> if ſhe is, as
I ſuppoſe, travelling the ſame road? why
ſhould I leave her expoſed to the inſults of
that odious man, which, humble as her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
ſeems to be, ſhe ill knows how to
bear. I may at leaſt, though I cannot
otherwiſe aſſiſt her, ſave her from paſſing
the remainder of the journey improperly
and unpleaſantly." Celeſtina then rang the
bell, and directing her fellow traveller to
be called, deſired her not only to partake
of her breakfaſt, but to accompany her the
reſt of the way in a poſt chaiſe which ſhe
had ordered, to eſcape from Mr. Jedwyn.</p>
            <p>The young perſon, notwithſtanding the
kindneſs of Celeſtina's addreſs, ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
ſtanding, and with a faint bluſh ſaid,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0206900201:141"/>
"You are very good Madam;—but—though
we happen to be in the ſame coach
I am ſure I ought not to put myſelf on a
footing with you: I am only a ſervant, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
into the country to my friends to
recover my health, and it would be very
wrong in me to intrude on a lady like you."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, won by this humble ſimplicity,
ſoon reaſſured her new acquaintance, and
ſoon after Jeſſy Woodburn, (which was
her name,) followed Celeſtina to the chaiſe;
where having paid the coach in London,
ſhe now had directed her box to be placed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Jedwyn left the hot rolls and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colate
with which he was regaling himſelf,
to remonſtrate at the chaiſe door againſt
this ſeceſſion. Celeſtina, without giving
him any anſwer, drew up the glaſſes the
moment ſhe was ſeated, which gave Jed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn
an opportunity to ſay to the poſtillion,
who was not yet on horſeback, that if he
would in the courſe of a fortnight find out
who the lady was, and whither ſhe went, he
would make up the half crown he then
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0206900201:142"/>
gave him half a guinea. The boy readily
promiſed to execute to the beſt of his
power ſo lucrative a commiſſion; and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
and her companion were ſoon at a
diſtance, and proceeded on their journey
much pleaſed with the exchange they had
made of a conveyance.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
            <p>CELESTINA having by her eaſy and
gentle manners conquered part of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
diffidence of her companion, began
to queſtion her about her ſituation in life;
and as ſhe had one of thoſe faces and one
of thoſe voices which win every heart
where any ſpark of feeling is found, Jeſſy
ſoon found herſelf enough at eaſe and even
flattered by the intereſt ſhe ſeemed to take
in her fate, as to acquire courage to relate
the following narrative.</p>
            <p>I muſt go back a great way, Madam,
ſince you command me to tell you all I
know of myſelf; even as far as my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
who is ſtill living, and who is one of
the richeſt farmers in our part of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire
uſing his own land, as all his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0206900201:144"/>
family I have heard have done before him
for a great many years. He married a
clergyman's daughter who had been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
very well, greatly indeed above the
ſort of life ſhe was to lead as a farmer's
wife. But ſhe was very pretty. Her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
left her unprovided for, and ſo ſhe
married perhaps more for money than love.
My mother was the only child they ever
had, and my grandmother, though her
own education had only ſerved to make
her unhappy, would fain have had her
daughter brought up as ſhe had been
herſelf; but her huſband, of a very hard
and obſtinate temper and repenting perhaps
of having married a wife too fine for him,
was ſo far from allowing her to have any
education, that he went to the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme;
inſiſting that his girl ſhould do as
his mother did thirty or forty years before,
and not only be taught to underſtand all
the buſineſs of the farm, but to live as he
did himſelf, and as he obliged his wife to
do, the ſame as the farming men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0206900201:145"/>
The conſequence of this difference of
opinion was fatal to my poor mother: one
of her parents took every opportunity of
giving her notions above herſelf, which
very naturally, ſhe eaſily took; and the
other ſeemed to delight in humbling and
degrading her: when ſhe was about eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
ſhe loſt her mother, and then was
forced to ſubmit to the harſh and unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
confinement impoſed upon her by her
father, from whom ſhe endeavoured to
conceal her paſſion for reading, which
only gained ſtrength by this unreaſonable
reſtraint. Home was very uneaſy to her,
but ſhe could hardly ever leave it but by
ſtealth. As ſhe was likely to have a very
good fortune, ſhe had numberleſs ſuitors;
but my grandfather would ſuffer none of
them to ſee her; deſigning to marry her
to a relation of his own almoſt as old as
himſelf, to whom ſhe had an invincible
averſion, which through the timidity of
her nature ſhe dared not declare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0206900201:146"/>
A neighbouring farmer, with whom my
grandfather had for many years been at
variance, and with whom he had had two
or three law-ſuits, had two ſons, both
brought up to his own buſineſs; the eldeſt
was married and had a family, but the
other had been ſpoiled by his mother,
and the notice taken of him by the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
gentlemen on account of his ſkill
in field ſports; he had indeed always been
rather fonder of being with them at cricket
matches, and races, than minding his
farm. He found means to introduce him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to my mother, though he had been
poſitively refuſed by my grandfather: he
won her affections, and after ſeveral pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
meetings ſhe agreed to go off with
him: the conſequence of which was her
having the door of her paternal houſe ſhut
againſt her for ever.</p>
            <p>For a little time after this marriage my
mother was received at the houſe of her
father in law, but on his death it became
the right of the eldeſt ſon, who had a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0206900201:147"/>
number of children; and as my father's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
were all irritated and diſappointed
by the obſtinate reſentment of my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
towards his daughter, they ſoon
behaved with ſuch unkindneſs towards
her, that ſhe prevailed on my father to
quit them, and take a little farm of his
own, which he with difficulty borrowed
money enough to ſtock, for he had long
ſince paid away in diſcharge of old debts,
all the money left him by his father. He
had been ſo long uſed to an idle, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a gay life, that he could not now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom
himſelf to the labour requiſite on
ſo ſmall a farm. My mother however by
inceſſant attention remedied for ſome years
this deficiency on his part; and though
nothing was laid by, they contrived to
live; my mother making from time to
time attempts to obtain her father's pardon,
though ſhe received nothing but cruel and
poſitive refuſals, either to ſee her or her
children, or ever to give them the leaſt
aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0206900201:148"/>
This hardneſs of heart, which ſhould
have excited pity, only made my father
treat my poor mother with harſhneſs too.
A young man of fortune in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
juſt then coming of age, was often
at his ſeat near our little farm, and took
ſuch a fancy to my father that he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
at his houſe, living as he lived, and
aſſociating with gentlemen from London,
and women they brought down with them.
He never came home but in ſuch a terrible
humour, that I and my ſiſter, who were
then about ten and nine years old, uſed to
be terrified to death; yet when he was
gone, as he ſometimes was for weeks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
my mother lamented his abſence and
the loſs of his affection, much more than
the fatigue, poverty, and ſorrow, to which
his conduct expoſed us all.</p>
            <p>"Preſent anxiety and the fear of leaving
me and my ſiſter to a fate as deplorable as
her own, together with the inceſſant toil
attending the care of a farm wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by her huſband, gradually deſtroyed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0206900201:149"/>
her conſtitution, till at laſt, Madam, her
heart was quite broken. When ſhe found
ſhe had only a few hours to live, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
the clergyman of the pariſh to go
to her father, and beg, if he would not ſee
her, that he would only ſend her his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,
for ſhe could not die in peace
without it.</p>
            <p>"Even that he had the cruelty to refuſe!
I loſt my dear mother, Madam; and my
ſiſter, who was always of a weak conſtitution,
followed her ſoon afterwards to the grave.
Ah! how often have I wiſhed that I had
died too. Troubles now multiplied around
us: my father's great friend had by this
time ſo compleatly ruined himſelf, that
every thing was ſeized and he left the
country. My father having no longer a
houſe to be at, was forced to live at home;
but it was only for a little while; for dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my mother's illneſs every thing had
been neglected, and we could not pay our
rent; ſo the landlord ſeized, our cattle
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0206900201:150"/>
were ſold, and we were turned out of the
farm and went to a miſerable cottage in
the next village; where, as my father was
ſo unuſed to work, we ſubſiſted for a while
on the reluctant charity of my uncle, whoſe
daughters were always reproaching me with
taking their bread from them. Believe
me, Madam, I did all I could do to earn
it for my father and myſelf: but what
could hands ſo feeble as mine do towards
ſupporting us both. I made an attempt
to ſee my grandfather, and to implore his
pity and protection towards one who had
never offended him; but he ordered me
to be driven from his door, and never
again ſuffered to appear there: orders which
thoſe he had about him were ready enough
to execute. I returned home quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartened
indeed, but ſtill endeavouring to
the utmoſt of my power to procure a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
by my labour for my father and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
I even went out to work in the fields;
but all I could earn was ſo inſufficient that
we often wanted neceſſary food, at leaſt <hi>I</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0206900201:151"/>
have often wanted it. But my father had
made an acquaintance with a widow wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the next village, who was ſaid to
be worth forty or fifty pounds. She was
young too and not ugly, and in leſs than
a year after my dear mother's death, he
married her, and we removed to her houſe.</p>
            <p>"The extremes of poverty I had before
known, bitter as I thought them, were
comparatively happineſs to what I now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.
I became the ſervant of my mother
in law, only without wages. She ſoon
brought my father an increaſe of family:
to them then I was nurſe, and very ſoon
had neither ſleep by night or reſpite by day.
I thought it my duty to bear every thing
for my father, without murmuring, but as
my fatigue and ſufferings encreaſed, my
dejection encreaſed too, and I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
through mere deſpondence unable to
fulfil my heavy taſks, in which if I failed
in the flighteſt degree, I was inſulted with
opprobious language and told to go to my
rich grandfather.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0206900201:152"/>
"Alas! my rich grandfather continued
inexorable; but home was ſo dreadful that
I determined to go to ſervice, being near
twenty, and able I thought to undertake
any place that could be offered me; for a
harder than that I now filled, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to meet with.</p>
            <p>"I applied to a relation I had at Exeter,
who after ſome enquiries procured me a
place in the family of an attorney in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
who was willing to diſpenſe with my
want of experience in favour of my being
a country ſervant. Thither therefore I
went, and entered as cheerfully as I could
on a new mode of life; endeavouring to
forget that I ever had any expectations of
a better. The dark, damp places where
the ſervants of perſons in the midling ranks
of life, live in the city, appeared very
dreadful to me; and it was my buſineſs,
after a day of fatiguing work, to ſit up for
my maſter or the clerks, who were often
out very late. My miſtreſs too was a very
fine lady, and kept a great deal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0206900201:153"/>
and it was part of my employment
to wait on her own maid, who was alſo a
ſort of houſekeeper, and much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to be pleaſed than the lady herſelf:
ſhe took care indeed that I ſhould never
want buſineſs; but determined as I was
never again to be a burthen to my father,
I went through the duties of my place,
heavy as they were, with courage and
ſteadineſs; ſo that even this ſecond miſtreſs,
however unwilling to be pleaſed, could
not find fault with me.</p>
            <p>"Among a great number of clerks that
my maſter kept, there was one who was
employed merely to copy, and was not
admitted among the reſt, though he looked
I am ſure more like a gentleman than any
of them. He did not lodge in the houſe,
but came every morning early to his work,
and ſat at it, poor young man! till five or
ſix o'clock at night, when he dined with
us ſervants, after the family and other clerks
had done. Often indeed, inſtead of eating,
he would ſigh all dinner time as if his heart
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0206900201:154"/>
would break; and I could not help fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he had been uſed to live quite in
other company; though he never ſeemed
above ours, but was always very obliging,
though he was very melancholy.</p>
            <p>"It happened once, that my maſter had
ſome extraordinary buſineſs to do that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
great haſte; it was ſome papers that
were to be ſent to India; and Mr. Cathcart,
the young man I have been ſpeaking of,
hearing my maſter ſay how afraid he was he
ſhould not get ready, offered to work all
day on Sunday, when none of the reſt of
the clerks would have ſtaid from their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
on any account. My maſter was
pleaſed with his willingneſs to oblige, and
he ſat down to his taſk. Nobody was in
the houſe but him and me; for it was the
cuſtom of my maſter and miſtreſs to dine in
the country on a Sunday with my miſtreſs's
mother at Edmonton; and all the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the office went different ways.
The footman attended my miſtreſs; and
Mrs. Gillam, her maid, always went to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0206900201:155"/>
ſee her acquaintance, who lived at the
other end of the town, and very often
came home ſadly out of temper becauſe
her place was not ſo fine and ſo faſhionable
as their's; and then I was ſure to ſuffer for
it, as indeed I did for all her ill temper
when ſhe had nobody elſe to vent it upon.</p>
            <p>Ah! Madam! often of a Sunday in
the ſummer I have gone up into cur din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
room, becauſe the ſtreet was ſo cloſe
and narrow that below we hardly ſaw day
light from one end of the year to the other;
and I have opened the ſaſh, and looked
againſt the black walls and ſhut windows
of the houſes oppoſite, and have thought
how diſmal it was! Ah! I remembered
too well the beautiful green hills, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and woods, where I ſo often uſed to
ramble with my ſiſter when we were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
in our own country, before we were
old enough to know that my poor mother
was unhappy, and had learned to weep
with her! How often have I wiſhed thoſe
days would come again, and how often
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0206900201:156"/>
have I ſhut my eyes and tried to fancy I
ſaw once more all the dear objects that
then were ſo charming. Alas! the dream
would not laſt long! or if it did it ſerved
only to make me feel more unhappy, when,
inſtead of being able to indulge it, I was
obliged to go back to hard, and what was
yet worſe, to dirty work in our diſmal
kitchen. In Devonſhire I had been uſed
to work hard enough; but I had always
freſh air to breathe, and could now and
then of an evening ſit at our cottage win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and look at the moon, and fancy
that my mother might be there with my
ſiſter, and that they ſaw and pitied their
poor unfortunate Jeſſy. Tears then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
me; and I gathered courage to bear
the next day the ill humour of my mother
in law, which now that it was over I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
was not worſe than the ill humour of
Mrs. Gillam. My father's harſhneſs indeed
was worſe than either, becauſe I loved
him, and every time he uſed to ſpeak cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0206900201:157"/>
to me, and ſeem to wiſh me away, it
was like a dagger in my heart!"</p>
            <p>The tears of the unfortunate Jeſſy here
interrupted her narrative a moment, and
Celeſtina took occaſion to ſay—</p>
            <p>"But what were you going to tell me
about Mr. Cathcart? You ſeem to have
forgotten him?"</p>
            <p>"Ah! Madam!" replied ſhe with a
deep ſigh, "I thought after I began to talk
of him, that I was doing wrong, and that
it was better not to ſay any more about
him: beſides, Madam, though you are ſo
good and ſo condeſcending, it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
proper for me to trouble you with all
the reaſons I have to be ſorrowful."</p>
            <p>"Indeed I wiſh extremely to know
them," replied Celeſtina; "and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
I deſire to know all that relates to
Mr. Cathcart. The little you have ſaid,
has intereſted me greatly."</p>
            <p>"It was on the Sunday, Madam, that
I was ſpeaking of, when every body was
gone out, that poor Mr. Cathcart firſt
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0206900201:158"/>
ſpoke to me alone. Often before that to
be ſure I thought he pitied me, when he
ſaw me doing work too heavy for my
ſtrength; and often he has offered to help
me, and did not diſdain to aſſiſt me though
the footmen did; and yet I am ſure his
look and his manners were a great deal
more like thoſe of a nobleman than any
thing elſe. Mrs. Gillam however was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſo angry if ſhe ſaw him ſpeak to, or
help me, and uſed to put herſelf into ſuch
paſſions, that he was afraid almoſt of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at me before her, leaſt it ſhould be the
occaſion of my being uſed ill.</p>
            <p>On the Sunday, Madam, that I was
ſpeaking of, he had finiſhed all my maſter
left for him to do, between ſix and ſeven
o'clock: for he wrote ſuch a beautiful hand
and ſo quick that his writing ſeemed done
by enchantment. That day he had eat no
dinner: but a little after ſix o'clock he
came down into the kitchen, where I was
fitting: "Jeſſy," ſaid he, "will you
"make me ſome tea: I am fatigued, and I
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0206900201:159"/>
think it will refreſh me." Ah! Madam!
how pleaſed I was to do any thing for him.
As he ſat on the other ſide of the table
drinking his tea, I looked at him, and
thought his eyes ſeemed inflamed as if he
had been crying, and he ſeemed more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
than uſual. "What is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Mr. Cathcart?" ſaid I, "you have
tired yourſelf too much?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, anſwered he, "I have been
writing a long time; but I have finiſhed
my buſineſs, ſo I never mind my head
ache." He ſeemed deſirous of turning
the diſcourſe, and reaching acroſs to the
ſide of the table where I ſat, he took up a
torn book, which, while I was ſweeping
the clerk's office the day before, my maſter
had thrown to me, bidding me burn it, for
that he would not have ſuch trumpery lay
about there. I never had time to read,
though my poor mother had taught me to
love it; and I had thrown this book into
a drawer, from whence I had taken it but a
moment before Mr. Cathcart came down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0206900201:160"/>
He enquired how I came by it, and
when I told him, aſked if I had read it?
I anſwered that I had no time. "It is my
book," ſaid he, ſighing from the bottom
of his heart as he ſpoke; "and it is the
ſtory of a poor young man, who was as
unfortunate as I am: but he had the
reſolution to end his calamities; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was not enchained to life as I muſt
be. Heaven and earth!" exclaimed he,
as if at that moment oppreſſed by ſome
idea altogether inſupportable, "how long
ſhall I remain the wretch I am!"</p>
            <p>He ſtarted from his chair, and walked
about the room with looks ſo wild that I
was terrified to death: I went to him trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
and beſought him to be calm, to
tell me if I could do any thing for him:
he looked eagerly at me a moment and
burſt into tears—"Ah! Jeſſy," cried he,
"you pity me, and all the return I make
is to terrify and diſtreſs you!" For a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Madam, after this guſt of paſſion,
he became calmer, and ſat down; then as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0206900201:161"/>
I ſtood ſtill trembling by him, he took
my hands within his and put them to his
burning forehead and eyes; but after a
moment ſeeming to recollect himſelf, he
ſighed, let them go, and ſaid—"I hardly
know, Jeſſy, what ailed me juſt now; but
I was ſo tired, my ſpirits were ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
by having been ſo long at the
deſk employed in ſuch tedious kind of
writing, that when I looked at you—when
you ſeemed concerned for me—I
am ſo little uſed to meet any friendly
looks here, that your pity affected me
ſtrangely; I felt juſt then how terrible,
how very terrible my fate was; and
this proud rebellious heart, unſubdued
yet to my cruel deſtiny, deprived me for
a moment of my reaſon."</p>
            <p>Thank God, replied I, you are now
eaſier: indeed you did ſadly frighten me.
Tell me, dear Mr. Cathcart, why did you
talk ſo, and why are you ſo unhappy?</p>
            <p>"I will tell you, Jeſſy," anſwered he,
"though you are the only perſon in the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0206900201:162"/>
houſe who ever ſhall gueſs at my real ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.
I am unhappy:—not becauſe I
was born and educated a gentleman,
and am now reduced to a condition
worſe than abſolute ſervitude, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thoſe I love and feel for more than
for myſelf are fallen with me; becauſe
my labour—and yet I am ſacrificing my
life to follow it—my labour is inſufficent
to ſupport a woman, delicately brought
up, and her four infant children!"</p>
            <p>"Ah! Madam! all the ſorrow I
had ever known was nothing to the cold
death-like feeling which ſeemed to wither
up my heart, when for the moment I
thought Mr. Cathcart was married and had
a family! I did not know at that time why
it hurt me ſo: but I was not able to ſpeak,
while he, after remaining ſilent a minute,
ſaid—"By my work to-day I have earned
a guinea more than my weekly ſtipend:
ſurely therefore inſtead of murmuring
thus, I ought rather to be thankful that
I have had power to do this, for to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0206900201:163"/>
I ſhall receive it, and to-morrow I
ſhall be able to carry to my Sophy and
her children ſome neceſſaries which they
have long wanted, but which I could
not before ſpare money enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
for them, out of what I earned
weekly as the only ſupport of us all."</p>
            <p>"Poor as I am, Madam, I could not
help unlocking my tea cheſt where I kept
my little ſavings; and though I trembled
like a leaf as I did it, I put a guinea and
ſome ſilver, all I had, into a paper, and
carried it to him. Mr. Cathcart, ſaid I,
pray be not offended, but take this trifle,
and make uſe of it for your family; they
want it more than I do, and you cannot
think how much happier it will make me
if you have it, than if I lay it out on my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>"Gracious God!" cried he, "this is too
much. No, my dear, generous girl, do
not imagine I will take what you have ſo
hardly acquired. Believe me, Jeſſy, this
inſtance of ſenſibility and kindneſs,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0206900201:164"/>
charming as they are, only render me
more wretched. In the meaneſt ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
in the loweſt degradation, amid
the hardeſt labour, I have found a ſoul
ſo much ſuperior to thoſe I have met
with in poliſhed ſociety: but your form,
your manners, your ſentiments, are not
thoſe of your ſtation: ſurely you were
not born what I now ſee you?"</p>
            <p>"Indeed, replied I, I was: my father
is now a labourer; I have no mother; nor
any friend willing, if they are able, to do
any thing for me: but while I am able to
work I muſt not, I will not be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
whatever hardſhips I may undergo,
if you Mr. Cathcart will but let me be
your friend. Let me ſee your children;
indeed I ſhall love them; and if your lady
will give me leave I will work for them:
I can bring any thing ſhe will give me to
do home, and work in my own room in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of going to bed.</p>
            <p>"I do not know Madam, how I was
able to ſay ſo much, for I felt my heart
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0206900201:165"/>
throb as if it would break all the time I
was ſpeaking. Oh! Madam! I was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
tranſported as it were to heaven,
when Mr. Cathcart, thanking me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times for my offer, told me that the
children he ſupported were not his own
but his ſiſter's, whoſe huſband had been
undone by the villainy of ſome people with
whom he had been connected in trade,
and by the wickedneſs of an attorney; it
is impoſſible to deſcribe how I was relieved
to find he was not married! for though I
am ſure I ſhould have loved his children
dearly becauſe they were his, yet methought
I loved them much better now."</p>
            <p>Senſations ſhe had herſelf felt in regard
to Willoughby, now forcibly occurred to
Celeſtina: ſhe remained ſilent however,
and Jeſſy went on.</p>
            <p>After this time, Madam, Mr. Cathcart
took every opportunity of ſpeaking to me;
and I got leave to go out one evening,
and he took me to ſee this beloved and
unfortunate ſiſter. It was in one of thoſe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0206900201:166"/>
little new houſes which are run up in a road
leading from Iflington to London, that
Mr. Cathcart's family lodged: his ſiſter,
Madam, was ſo like him, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I ſaw her I could have died for her;
and I forgot all the reluctance with which
I agreed at his earneſt requeſt to go to ſee
her: ſhe ſeemed to be four or five years
older than he is, and was very pale and
thin, but ſhe had ſuch beautiful eyes, and
hands ſo white!—her form was ſo graceful,
ſo commanding, that her very plain dreſs,
and a cloſe cap, ſuch as widow's wear,
could not disfigure her, or make her look
otherwiſe than like a gentlewoman. When
her brother led me in, ſhe held out her
hand to me, and begged I would ſit down:
though in ſuch a poor little lodging, I felt
that ſhe was ſo much my ſuperior that I
could not obey her without heſitation;
but ſhe preſently by her gracious manners
diſſipated my fears, and I ſat down by her
cloſe to a frame on which ſhe had been
working. A cradle, with a ſleeping baby
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0206900201:167"/>
in it, ſtood at her feet, by which a little
girl of three years old ſat, as if watching
the infant, and on haſſocks near the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
were placed two little boys, the elder
not above ſix years old, who were learning
their taſks. As ſoon as my reception was
over, ſhe ſmiled on her brother with more
cheerfulneſs than it ſeemed poſſible a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before for her countenance to aſſume;
and deſired he would aſſiſt her in getting
ſome tea for me. Cathcart went down
ſtairs, and then ſhe entered into converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with me: "My brother," ſaid ſhe,
has often told me how unfit you are for
the condition in which he found you,
and if I may judge by your appearance,
you certainly were not born to it. Had
my dear Frank been any other than he
is, I ſhould have ſuppoſed him influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
by beauty; but I know that mere
perſonal lovelineſs in any rank never
affected him, and many reaſons induced
me, Jeſſy, to conſent to ſee you—reaſons
which relate to him as well as yourſelf.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0206900201:168"/>
He has told you, Jeſſy, that he was born
to proſpects very different from thoſe
now before him—proſpects which are I
fear vaniſhed for ever. My misfortunes,
which are ſuch as I dare not attempt to
relate to you, have extended to him:
yet does he with unexampled generoſity,
give himſelf up to ſervitude, to aſſiſt me
and my poor children. Judge whether
ſuch a brother is not dear to me—judge
whether I ought not to love all that he
loves, and to comply as far as poſſible
with all his wiſhes.</p>
            <p>"I have of late ſeen with infinite pain,
that in addition to all the calamities of
indigence, a paſſion has ſeized him,
which muſt encreaſe, and may perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate,
his misfortunes, and I conſented,
and even wiſhed to ſee you, that I might
fairly ſtate to you the ſituation he is in,
as to circumſtances; in the hope—a
hope in which I truſt I ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
that your good ſenſe, and even
your regard for him, will lead you to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0206900201:169"/>
avoid an error ſo ſeducing as that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
his wife."</p>
            <p>"I do not knew Madam, how I looked
at that moment, but I believe Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone
thought I ſhould faint, for ſhe
gave me immediate aſſiſtance by opening
the window, fetched me a glaſs of water,
and very earneſtly entreated me to try to
recover myſelf before her brother returned.
I ſhould be too tedious, Madam, were I to
relate all that paſſed even in the few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
we were together afterwards. I found
that Cathcart's regard for me was ſuch,
that he was willing to forget what he had
once been, and what he might ſtill be,
and to unite himſelf for ever with the
poor and humble Jeſſy. Ah! Madam,
had it not been for Mrs. Elphinſtone's
ſake, who with her children had no other
dependence, I ſhould have feared no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
no diſtreſs with him; but ſhould
have been too happy to have begged round
the world with him: as it was, I ſaw that
I ought not to think a moment of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0206900201:170"/>
which would at beſt only encreaſe
his difficulties. Oh! how I then wiſhed
that my grandfather were leſs cruel, my
poor father leſs imprudent!</p>
            <p>"After this firſt interview with Mrs.
Elphinſtone, I ſaw her whenever I could
get leave to go out, which was not indeed
very often: but my maſter, who did not
want humanity, ſeeing me look dreadfully
ill, ordered Mrs. Gillam to let me go out
whenever ſhe could ſpare me, for air.
Mrs. Elphinſtone, who watched every alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of my countenance, gueſſed at all I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered;
and at length ſhe became ſo fond of
me, that ſhe rather deſired than oppoſed the
completion of her brother's wiſhes. The
ſtruggle I underwent nearly coſt me my
life: but at length, Madam, I have left
them both. I could not bear to ſee my
dear Cathcart every day more and more
unhappy: I could not bear to become a
burthen to him: for ſome time I redoubled
my diligence, and exerted myſelf greatly
beyond my ſtrength, from a hope, that by
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0206900201:171"/>
becoming neceſſary to my miſtreſs, I
ſhould obtain an encreaſe of wages, out of
which I thought it poſſible that I might
be able to ſave ſomething; but the upper
ſervant took pains to render all my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
ineffectual; and my health declined
ſo rapidly under the labour and anxiety I
endured, that Cathcart, whoſe uneaſineſs
compleated the meaſure of my ſufferings,
at length propoſed that I ſhould quit my
ſervice, as the only means of ſaving my
life, and try what my native air would do
to reſtore me.</p>
            <p>"I hope my father will receive me
without unkindneſs, and ſuffer me to ſtay
till I am able to take another ſervice; and
ſometimes I am willing to flatter myſelf
that my grandfather may relent, though it
is more poſſible than probable."</p>
            <p>"And where," enquired Celeſtina,
"have you left your lover?"</p>
            <p>"Ah! Madam," replied the weeping
Jeſſy, "he ſtill remains writing for the
exiſtence of his ſiſter and her children: at
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0206900201:172"/>
his pen from early morning, to eleven or
twelve at night. By ſuch aſſiduous appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
he is enabled indeed to earn double
the money he would otherwiſe do; but his
dear health is faſt declining, and God only
knows," continued ſhe, claſping her hands
together, "whether I ſhall ever ſee him
more: but if not, one comfort, one great
comfort is, that we ſhall not be ſeparated
long:—in heaven nothing can part us!"</p>
            <p>"Let us however hope," ſaid Celeſtina,
"that your tenderneſs, your fortitude,
and generoſity, will be rewarded on earth.
Your father then knows nothing of your
arrival?"</p>
            <p>"Ah! no, Madam: I dared not write
to him, for fear he ſhould have been angry
with me for having quitted my ſervice, and
have refuſed to receive me. Now I hope,
when he ſees me ſo ſadly altered, for I am
not at all like what I was when I left him,
he will have ſome pity upon me, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
me at leaſt to ſtay in his houſe till I
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0206900201:173"/>
have ſtrength enough to undertake another
ſervice."</p>
            <p>"You ſhall go with me, however, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,"
ſaid Celeſtina, "and you ſhall ſtay
with me till you are fitter than you now
appear to be to undergo an interview with
this cruel father."</p>
            <p>The poor Jeſſy, oppreſſed by this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
could not ſpeak, but ſhe kiſſed the
hand of her benefactreſs with a reſpectful
gratitude, and a mournful but not unpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſadneſs kept the generous and ſoft
hearted Celeſtina ſilent till their arrival at
the inn where they were to remain that
night.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
            <p>EARLY in the evening of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
day, Celeſtina and her humble friend
arrived at the lodging ſhe had taken: it
was a ſmall new built brick houſe, on the
edge of an extenſive common: encloſures
at a diſtance relieved a little the dreary
uniformity of the view from it's windows,
and a village church, with a few ſtraggling
houſes ſcattered round the edge of the
heath at the diſtance of about half a mile,
gave ſome relief to the eye, and ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation
of an inhabited country: winter
had alike diveſted the common of it's
furze and heath bloſſoms, and the few
elms on it's borders, of their foliage. All
was alike dull, and unpleaſant: but Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
remembered that ſhe had now
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0206900201:175"/>
eſcaped from the Caſtlenorths, from the
ſight of preparations for Willoughby's mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and that if ſhe was not to live to
ſee him happy, ſhe ſhould not now witneſs
his ſtruggles and his diſtreſs: ſhe tried to
believe that ſhe could receive intelligence
of his marriage with compoſure, and be
glad in the reflection that he had obeyed
his mother; but her heart revolted, and all
ſhe could promiſe herſelf was, to exert her
reſolution to obtain ſuch a ſtate of mind,
as might enable her to hear, without very
acute anguiſh, of an event, which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all that had paſſed at her laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview
with Willoughby, ſhe ſtill conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as inevitable.</p>
            <p>The firſt day after her arrival was paſſed
in ſettling herſelf in her new habitation
by the aid of Jeſſy, who helped her to
arrange her books and her wardrobe. The
penſive ſimplicity of her new friend's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
won upon her every hour; and now,
deprived as ſhe was of all her former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections,
and of every proſpect of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0206900201:176"/>
for herſelf, ſhe was ſenſible of no
other pleaſure than what aroſe from the
power of ſoothing the ſorrows of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
companion, and forming ſchemes
for reſtoring her to the favour of her grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father;
and to her unhappy lover, in whoſe
fate ſhe became as much intereſted from
the artleſs deſcription Jeſſy had given, as
if ſhe had herſelf known him. It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
however to part with her: but as
ſhe appeared in too weak a ſtate of health
to encounter the rude reception ſhe might
meet with from her father and her mother
in law, if ſhe appeared before them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
notice, Celeſtina thought it beſt to
keep her till an anſwer could be obtained
from them, and ſhe therefore hired a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger,
by whom the letter the trembling
Jeſſy indited was diſpatched to the cottage
of Woodburn, which was about ſeven
miles diſtant. Towards evening he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
and brought a reluctant and ſurly
conſent from her father to receive her for
a little time till ſhe recovered her health.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0206900201:177"/>
The terms in which this anſwer was written,
though Celeſtina endeavoured to give
them the beſt interpretation ſhe could, were
cruelly painful to poor Jeſſy, who wept
over the letter, while Celeſtina, with the
moſt generous pity, aſſured her, that if
her father's behaviour to her was unkind,
and her ſtay at his houſe uncomfortable,
ſhe would again receive her, and that ſhe
ſhould be welcome to remain with her till
her health was re-eſtabliſhed, and till means
could be found to procure for her the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of her grandfather, who, on enquiry
of her hoſteſs, Celeſtina found to be as
Jeſſy had repreſented him—a very rich
farmer, now quite ſuperannuated, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
childiſh; who having once determined
to reſent his daughter's marriage, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in it from the hard obſtinacy of his
nature, and had been ſupported in it by
the arts of an old female relation who lived
with him, and who, while ſhe made a
purſe every year out of what was entruſted
to her, looked forward with avidity to his
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0206900201:178"/>
death, when ſhe hoped to poſſeſs the whole.
Celeſtina procured an horſe and a man to
lead it, the expence of which ſhe paid
herſelf, and on the third day after their
arrival at Thorpe Heath, Jeſſy took leave
of her lovely and generous benefactreſs,
who was now left to reflect, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
on her own deſtiny.</p>
            <p>Till lately ſhe had not been conſcious
of the force of her attachment to Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
for it began ſo early in life, that ſhe
had never been alarmed by the uneaſineſs
which ſeizes the heart on it's firſt reception
of a new paſſion: ſhe now however found
that her exiſtence had been delightful to
her, only as his idea had mingled itſelf
with every hour of it, and that now, when
ſhe believed ſhe ought no longer to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
herſelf in thinking of him, ſhe could
think of nothing elſe with either intereſt or
pleaſure: the benevolence and tenderneſs
of her heart ſtill afforded her ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
while ſhe could exert it in favour
of the unfortunate, and the power of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friending
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0206900201:179"/>
friending the deſolate and unhappy Jeſſy
had called off her attention a little from
her own uneaſy feelings; but now, having
done all ſhe could at preſent do for her,
her heart was again ſenſible of the cruel
deprivation to which ſhe was condemned,
and her mind occupied in reflecting on
what Willoughby would think, what he
would ſay, when he learned ſhe was gone;
in conjectures on his behaviour to the
Caſtlenorths, and in trembling ſolicitude
whether he would write to her, or without
any farther indulgence of an attachment,
which he knew he ought not to cheriſh,
drive her from his recollection, at leaſt
till he had obeyed the injunctions of his
mother, and by compleating the marriage
ſhe had inſiſted upon, put it out of his
power to think of Celeſtina otherwiſe than
as his ſiſter.</p>
            <p>Two or three days paſſed thus, before
Celeſtina could acquire in any degree her
uſual ſerenity, and ſit down to her books,
her drawing, or her work. By muſic,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0206900201:180"/>
which ſhe now fancied would ſooth and
calm her ſpirits, ſhe could not amuſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
for though ſhe had a plano forte which
uſed to be called her's, yet, as it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been formally given to her, and as
Mrs. Molyneux had not mentioned it,
Celeſtina would not take it on her quitting
London. At length the firſt uneaſy ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on her change of ſituation a little ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided,
and ſhe began to conſider of a letter
which ſhe thought it indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to write to Mrs. Molyneux.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the ardent and eager
temper of Willoughby exhibited in London
a ſcene, which, could Celeſtina have known,
it would have redoubled all her anxiety.
The dinner of which he had been with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
induced to partake at Lord Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north's,
had ſerved only to fill him with new
and invincible diſguſt towards the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and hardly could he command himſelf
ſo as not to betray it. The reſtraint, however,
which, in conſideration of their relationſhip
to his mother, he determined, whatever it
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0206900201:181"/>
coſt him, to put upon his ſentiments, gave
to two of the perſons concerned a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
impreſſion of him: Lord Caſtlenorth,
fond of form, and of that reſerve which he
fancied ſupported dignity, liked his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
the better he ſaid for not aſſuming
the familiar and too eaſy manners, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
to him in the behaviour of moſt
of the young men he ſaw; and Miſs Fitz-Hayman,
who liked his perſon better on
every interview, and who never could for
a moment ſuppoſe that any man could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
her's with indifference, imputed to
reſpect and admiration that diſtant polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which was intended to conceal aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Lady Caſtlenorth, however, who
had ſeen more of the world than her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and had not the ſame prejudices as
her huſband, was by no means pleaſed
with the obſervations ſhe made in the
courſe of the day, nor with the pleaſure ſhe
ſaw for the firſt time in the eyes of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
when the moment of their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
arrived. This was not till four in the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0206900201:182"/>
morning. The late hour of dinner, and
the parties which were made for cards,
brought on a ſupper at near two, of which
Lady Caſtlenorth ſeemed to expect her
gueſts would partake: they ſtaid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
Lord Caſtlenorth retiring early, by
the advice of Mrs. Calder; and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſatility
of Lady Caſtlenorth's knowledge
being diſplayed the whole time to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
fatigue of Willoughby, and by no
means to the ſatisfaction of his ſiſter, who
found in her aunt a deſire to monopolize
not only all the converſation, but the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of every man preſent, to whom
ſhe contrived to addreſs herſelf by turns,
and with whom ſhe appeared immediately
offended, if Mrs. Molyneux, whom ſhe
conſidered and treated as a pretty automa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
attracted even for a moment any of
that admiration that ſhe was generally, at
her own parties and among her own friends,
accuſtomed to engroſs.</p>
            <p>Willoughby was ſet down by his ſiſter
at his own lodgings, and Mrs. Molyneux
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0206900201:183"/>
herſelf knew nothing of Celeſtina's depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
till breakfaſt the next day; when bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
with preparations for a ball ſubſcribed
for by ſome noblemen of her acquaintance,
ſhe liſtened to the information hardly
knowing ſhe received it, and teſtified no
other concern than by ſaying coldly—"I
wiſh ſhe had ſtaid till to-morrow, for ſhe
has really ſomething of a taſte, and I
ſhould have liked to have had her here
when I dreſs." This important dreſs, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
was too momentous to ſuffer her to
think long of any human being; and
when her brother called upon her about
three o'clock, ſhe was adjuſting the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on a tiara of her own invention, and
had forgotten for the moment not only the
ſudden journey of Celeſtina but Celeſtina
herſelf.</p>
            <p>Willoughby ſat down by her; and in
hopes of Celeſtina's coming in, entered
into converſation on frivolous ſubjects, to
which he in fact gave ſo little attention
that he hardly heard the anſwers his ſiſter
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0206900201:184"/>
gave him. He deſired, however, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the time of his ſtay as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that without aſking for Celeſtina, he
might ſee her; and he knew, that buſied
as Mrs. Molyneux was, he ſhould have
an opportunity of ſpeaking to her without
obſervation.</p>
            <p>The tiara was at length ornamented,
and no Celeſtina appeared: Willoughby
then enquired why ſhe did not aſſiſt at an
operation ſo important, and heard with
pain and amazement that ſhe had left the
houſe at five o'clock that morning.</p>
            <p>"And whither is ſhe gone?" ſaid he
in a voice hardly audible: "and how
could you ſuffer her to go?"</p>
            <p>"Oh! as to that," anſwered Mrs. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneux,
quite regardleſs of his diſtreſs,
"ſhe has taken thoſe lodgings you know
in Devonſhire that you have ſo often heard
her ſpeak of; and for her going, you know
ſhe has long determined on it, and indeed
I did not oppoſe it, thinking as things
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0206900201:185"/>
are, it was the very beſt reſolution ſhe
could take."</p>
            <p>"As things are!" repeated Willoughby,
trying vainly to ſtifle the painful ſenſation
his ſiſter's coldneſs and inſenſibility gave
him: "I know not, Mrs. Molyneux,
what you mean exactly, but—"</p>
            <p>He was proceeding, when the hair dreſſer,
who on theſe great occaſions was employed
in preference to her own maid, was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced;
and Mrs. Molyneux, ordering
him into her powdering room, walked im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
away, and leſt Willoughby ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
like a ſtatue by the dreſſing table ſhe
had left.</p>
            <p>He remained there near a quarter of an
hour, in a ſtate of mind difficult to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed:
the danger to which Celeſtina
muſt be expoſed, alone and unprotected;
the probability of his loſing her for ever;
nay of her ſacrificing herſelf to ſome of
thoſe pretenders whom he doubted not
her beauty would attract, in the ſame ſpirit
of diſintereſted heroiſm, as that which had
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0206900201:186"/>
determined her to quit London: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
tenderneſs he was conſcious of
towards her, againſt which he found every
hour the impoſſibility of contending, and
the encreaſing diſguſt that he felt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
the chains he had promiſed to
put on, all contributed to overwhelm his
mind with anguiſh, from which he ſaw
not how it was eaſy or even poſſible to
eſcape.</p>
            <p>His firſt idea was to obtain a direction
to Celeſtina, and follow her immediately;
but he knew the delicacy of her mind, and
he felt perfectly what was due to her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:—reflections
which checked thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
almoſt as ſoon as they were formed;
and before he could decide on what he
ought to do, he received from Molyneux,
who had juſt come in and gone out again,
an unſealed note, containing theſe lines:</p>

            <p>This note, ſo peremptorily requiring
what the writer knew Willoughby could
not obtain but by haſtily confirming thoſe
meaſures which were ſo diſpleaſing to him;
this unfeeling precipitation, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
only a fineſſe to compel him to
plunge into them, rouſed Willoughby from
the ſtate of undetermined anxiety he had
been in, into anger and indignation: his
firſt ſolicitude however was to raiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0206900201:188"/>
the five hundred pounds for that
evening's play, which was clearly the
meaning of his brother in law; and ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his hat, he left the houſe, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining,
in the firſt emotions of his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to enter it no more. He took his
way towards the city, and applying to a
banker in Lombard-ſtreet, in whoſe hands
his father had kept his money, and who
had had conſiderable advantages by his
own affairs during his minority, he obtained,
not without ſolicitation the moſt painful
to his pride and on terms as hard as
would have been demanded by a common
money lender, the ſum he wanted; which
he encloſed in a cover, and ſent by one of
the clerks, with theſe words:</p>
            <p>"Mr. Willoughby encloſes to Mr.
Molyneux the ſum for which he has ſo
preſſing an occaſion, and aſſures him
he will loſe no time in procuring the
reſt, that all pecuniary tranſactions may
be at an end between them."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0206900201:189"/>
It was with great difficulty he bridled
the natural vehemence of his temper, and
forbore to expreſs with bitterneſs the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
Molyneux's proceeding had given
him. More reſolute than ever not to be
dictated to by his brother in law, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting
more than before the marriage
which was thus intended to be forced
upon him, diſſatisfied with every idea
that occurred to him, and having no friend
in London to whom he could open his
oppreſſed heart, he determined at length
to procure a direction to Celeſtina, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
immediately to Cambridge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
conſult a friend he had there, on
whoſe judgment and attachment he had
an equal reliance, how he ſhould avoid an
alliance with the woman he deteſted and
the hazard he now incurred of loſing the
woman he adored.</p>
            <p>He ſent therefore a ſervant, as ſoon as
he returned to his lodgings, to procure
from the ſervants of Molyneux a copy of
the direction that had been put on the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0206900201:190"/>
trunks ſent to Celeſtina. This being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
he ordered a poſt chaiſe, and late
as it was, and without giving any account
of himſelf either to his ſiſter or the Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norths,
he ſet out for Cambridge, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at his college about four in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>CELESTINA in the mean time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
better reconciled to the plan of life
ſhe had adopted; and after being near a
week at her new abode, during which

                  <p>My dear Mrs. Molyneux will be glad
to hear that her wandering friend is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
contentedly, if not happily, in her
new abode, and has already ſubdued
her mind to her fortune ſo much as to
regret only the ſociety of thoſe ſhe has
been ſo long accuſtomed to love, and
by no means the ſcenes in which ſhe has
left them. My habitation is in the

houſe of a man who was formerly maſter
of a coaſting veſſel, in which occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
having made money enough to
ſupport himſelf and his wife in their old
age, and all his children being married
and provided for, he built this houſe a
few miles from the port where he uſed
to trade: their only ſervant is a mere
Weſt country paiſanne, who does the
buſineſs which the good old woman
herſelf is unequal to; whoſe not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,

remonſtrances to Jenny, when ſhe is
careleſs or neglectful, are the only
ſounds I ever hear to remind me that

me is now dreary enough; but in a few
weeks ſpring will produce new plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

feel from any thing, but from that moſt

            <p>This letter arrived a day after Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's
abrupt departure. Between the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
and unceaſing hurry in which ſhe
lived, and her vexation at that event, ſhe
hardly read it, but threw it careleſsly by
on her toilet, where it remained forgotten
like the writer of it.</p>
            <p>On the day Willoughby had dined and
ſupped in Groſvenor-ſtreet, the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
had been much diſſatisfied with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0206900201:194"/>
except his uncle; who retaining much
of form and ceremony in his own manners,
was willing to impute his coldneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
and his diſtant civility to veneration:
but the mother and daughter were by no
means content with his deportment; and
though they concealed their feelings as it
were by mutual conſent, their pride was
equally alarmed, and both reſolved to have
an early explanation</p>
            <p>Lady Caſtlenorth, however, whoſe policy
only had power to reſtrain awhile the
ebullitions of her wounded pride, waited one
day in hopes that Willoughby would in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
conference teſtify more ardour for the
match than he had done in mixed company;
but Willoughby never appeared; and her
indignation now knowing no bounds, ſhe
ordered her coach, and on the next, ſtalked
with more than uſual majeſty into the
dreſſing room of Mrs. Molyneux juſt as
ſhe had finiſhed her breakfaſt, which was,
owing to the hour on which ſhe went to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0206900201:195"/>
bed the preceding morning, even later
than uſual.</p>
            <p>Lady Caſtlenorth hardly ſpoke to Mrs.
Molyneux when ſhe entered, but demanded
in an imperious tone what was become of
Mr. Willoughby.</p>
            <p>The lady to whom ſhe thus abruptly
addreſſed herſelf was as haughty and of as
high conſequence in her own eſtimation as
Lady Caſtlenorth herſelf; and feeling and
reſenting her rude and peremptory ſtile,
ſhe anſwered, with almoſt as little complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
in her manner, that ſhe knew not.</p>
            <p>"You don't know, Madam!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
the imperious Viſcounteſs; "you
don't know! Very extraordinary ſurely.
What am I to underſtand from all this?"</p>
            <p>"Of that alſo I am ignorant," replied
Mrs. Molyneux. "Mr. Willoughby,
Madam, is his own maſter; and I really
can no more account for than direct his
actions,"</p>
            <p>"Aſtoniſhing!" re-aſſumed Lady Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenorth;
"that a man ſituated as he is,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0206900201:196"/>
who is not an abſolute ideot, ſhould he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
in this manner in an affair on which
his very exiſtence as a man of faſhion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends:
but don't imagine, Miſtreſs Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux,
that <hi>my</hi> daughter—"</p>
            <p>"Dear Madam," interrupted Matilda,
irritated by the ſupercilious and inſolent
tone in which her Ladyſhip ſpoke, and
particularly the emphaſis ſhe put on the
word Miſtreſs, "I beg and entreat that you
will ſpare your anger. I at leaſt cannot
deſerve it, for I have no influence over
my brother. I dare ſay he has ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for having left London ſo abruptly,
though I aſſure you I do not know them."</p>
            <p>"You don't!—I do: he is gone after that
creature, whom your mother, to her utter
diſgrace, brought up in the family, and
with whom ſhe ſuffered her ſon to live in
habits of intimacy which ſhock me every
time I think of it."</p>
            <p>At this moment Mr. Molyneux entered
with a letter in his hand, and hardly in his
haſte noticing Lady Caſtlenorth, he told
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0206900201:197"/>
his wife that the letter was that inſtant deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to him by an expreſs, that his father
was dying, and that they muſt immediately
ſet out for Ireland at his earneſt entreaty.
"Haſten therefore," ſaid he, "to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
yourſelf, for the chaiſe I have ſent for
will be at the door in a moment. Your
Ladyſhip will excuſe us I am ſure on ſuch
an occaſion," added he, addreſſing himſelf
to Lady Caſtlenorth. "Matilda, we have
not a moment to loſe: direct your maid
to prepare what you want to take with you,
and to follow herſelf with the baggage that
may not be ſo immediately neceſſary."</p>
            <p>"And where is Willoughby?" cried
Lady Caſtlenorth, raiſing her voice: "I
inſiſt upon ſeeing him."</p>
            <p>"I believe he has left London," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
Molyneux; "but I aſſure you I
know not whither he is gone. I dare ſay
your Ladyſhip will ſoon hear of him. In
the mean time pray pardon me; it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for me now to have the honour of
attending you."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0206900201:198"/>
He then left the room, as his wife had
done already; and Lady Caſtlenorth,
burſting with anger and indignation which
ſhe had nobody to liſten to, returned in
all the fury of mortified pride to her own
houſe.</p>
            <p>While ſhe was there meditating how to
revenge the neglect ſhewn to her daughter,
of which ſhe now no longer doubted, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
was pouring out all the diſtreſſes
of his heart to a friend whom heaven ſeemed
to have ſent him for their alleviation.</p>
            <p>Mr. Vavaſour, his moſt intimate friend,
had been abſent when he left Cambridge
on his haſty and reluctant journey to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
but was now returned, and to him
Willoughby immediately diſcloſed the
cauſe of that uneaſineſs which his friend
perceived he ſuffered under even before he
ſpoke.</p>
            <p>"What ſhall I do?" ſaid he, as he
leaned on the table, "how extricate my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from the moſt inſupportable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements?
how ſatisfy this narrow and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0206900201:199"/>
Molyneux? my ſoul revolts from
the odious neceſſity of being obliged to
him for forbearance: yet to ſell my eſtates—is
more painful to me than any meaſure
but marrying Miſs Fitz-Hayman. Yet my
promiſe, my aſſurances to my mother—I
ſee not how I can eſcape from the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
that encompaſs me."</p>
            <p>"You make more of them ſurely, my
dear George," replied Vavaſour, "than is
neceſſary. What! ſhould either a promiſe
or an exigence compel you to be miſerable
for life; then indeed there would be no
eſcape: but now, ſurely, my friend, your
eſcape is not difficult."</p>
            <p>"Were you ſituated as I am then, how
would you act?"</p>
            <p>"Why I would without heſitation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
off with the woman I did not like, and
marry the woman I did: that is, if I were
diſpoſed to marry at all."</p>
            <p>"And would you do this, Vavaſour,
contrary to a ſolemn promiſe given to her
who cannot now releaſe me from it? and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0206900201:200"/>
then how can I act in regard to Molyneux?
be the conſequence what it will he ſhall
never again dun me for money, and—"</p>
            <p>"Never!" interrupted Vavaſour warmly,
"if you will liſten to me. I am not quite
of age it is true, but my fortune is ſuch,
that nothing is eaſier than for me to raiſe
this paltry five thouſand pounds, or twice the
ſum, on no very exorbitant terms. I have
already taken up money for my own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and ſhall I heſitate when my friend
has real occaſion for it? In a week's time
the money ſhall be ready for you. Pray
then let us hear no more of any difficulties
of that ſort, and as for your promiſe—the
good lady, when ſhe extorted it, could never
think it binding."</p>
            <p>"Speak not lightly of her, my dear
friend," cried Willoughby, "that I may
feel all the kindneſs of the former part of
your ſpeech without alloy: ſhe was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
whom, had you known, you would
have reverenced and loved, and it was in
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0206900201:201"/>
kindneſs only that ſhe made me give her
an engagement—"</p>
            <p>"To make yourſelf miſerable. I am,
you know, George, an Epicurean; you are
ſomewhat of a Stoic I ſuppoſe; and if that
is the caſe, fulfil your promiſe, take your
heireſs, and philoſophize at your leiſure. I
have never ſeen your Celeſtina, you know;
but from your deſcription of her, and your
long attachment, I ſhould pity you—I am
afraid I ſhould deſpiſe you—I am ſure I
ſhould not love you—were you to ſacrifice
ſuch a creature to any pecuniary conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Come, my dear fellow, aſſure
yourſelf that if five thouſand pounds or
more will relieve you from what weighs
on your ſpirits about Molyneux's matter,
it is your's; the other affair you muſt ſettle
with your own heart, and I leave you to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
it together."</p>
            <p>Vavaſour then quitted the room; and
Willoughby, releaſed from his anxiety
about his debt by the generoſity of his
friend, gave himſelf up to all thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0206900201:202"/>
images which preſented themſelves to
his mind. To be united immediately with
Celeſtina, to carry her down to Alveſtone,
and there to enter on a plan of oeconomy
which ſhould in a very few years retrieve
his circumſtances, was a viſion which he
found ſo much delight in cheriſhing, that
he drove from his mind as much as poſſible
the painful objections that ſtill cruelly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
themſelves to deſtroy it: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of Vavaſour helped to put
them entirely to flight; and Willoughby,
perſuaded that by the projects of oeconomy
he had formed he ſhould ſoon be enabled
to pay his friend the money ſo generouſly
offered him, agreed without much heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to accept it. The young men then
ſettled that they would go the next day
but one to London, ſtay there long enough
to negociate this buſineſs, and then go
down together to Alveſtone, from whence
Willoughby, who had no inclination to
encounter Lady Caſtlenorth perſonally,
determined to write to his uncle, reſigning
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0206900201:203"/>
all pretenſions to the honor intended him,
and immediately to complete his marriage
with her who had ſo long been miſtreſs of
his heart. This arrangement, once made,
became every moment more ſeducing to
his imagination; ſtill the words of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the ſolemn charge given him with
her laſt breath, returned now and then to
diſturb his viſionary felicity: but Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,
always ſo lovely in his eyes, leaning
on his arm amid the ſhades of Alveſtone,
the delight of all who beheld her, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of his friends, the patroneſs of
his tenants, the protectreſs of the poor,
was an image ſo deliciouſly ſoothing to
his fancy, that by indulging it he at
length perſuaded himſelf that his mother,
who had ſo very tenderly loved her, would,
could ſhe be ſenſible of all the happineſs
they ſhould ſhare together, applaud his
violation of his promiſe and ſanction his
choice.</p>
            <p>Vavaſour, gay, generous, open hearted,
and volatile, always eagerly following him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0206900201:204"/>
his own inclinations, and as warmly
ſolicitous for his friend's gratification as his
own, encouraged as much as poſſible all
tendency in Willoughby to throw off any
adherence to what he deemed tyranny be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the grave; and by the time the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation
for the loan was completed,
which took them up near a week, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
had no longer any ſcruples remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
His only buſineſs in town then was
to pay Molyneux, whoſe conduct had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
him ſo much that he had not been
to the houſe: as ſoon however as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was ready, he wrote a note to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in law, ſignifying that he would on
the next day meet him at his attorney's
chambers to ſettle all accounts between
them. The ſervant who was ſent brought
the note back; and Willoughby then firſt
learning that his ſiſter and her huſband
were embarked for Ireland, depoſited the
money at a banker's, and wrote a cold let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to Molyneux, ſignifying that it waited
his orders. He then gave directions to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0206900201:205"/>
his own ſolicitor to take proper receipts on
the payment of it, and with Vavaſour
haſtened down to Alveſtone, in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of which place he knew Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
was; but he had determined not to
ſee her till he had obviated every
objection ſhe could make to his plan of
happineſs, by breaking at once and for
ever with the Caſtlenorths; a taſk on which,
reſolved as he was to execute it, he could
not think without a mixture of concern
and apprehenſion that he was aſhamed of
feeling, and dared by no means betray to
his friend Vavaſour; who, without knowing
any thing of the Caſtlenorths himſelf, had
made up his mind that they were an odious
and diſagreeable ſet, and from ſuch, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
might be their rank, he always flew
away himſelf, and encouraged his friends
to do it at whatever riſk. If he was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and even rude towards thoſe whom he
did not wiſh to pleaſe, he was altogether
as amiable and attentive to thoſe to whom
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0206900201:206"/>
he ſought to be acceptable. His diſlikes
and his attachments were equally warm,
and the latter had hitherto been rather
warm than permanent.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
            <p>WHILE theſe things were paſſing at
Cambridge and in London, Celeſtina un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent
the cruelleſt anxiety at not hearing
from Mrs. Molyneux; but all her conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ended in the painful concluſion that
the preparations and celebration of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby's
marriage entirely engaged her,
and prevented her writing. All her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was now ſummoned to ſupport her
againſt the ſhock which the certainty of
this event would give her. With a beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heart, and in breathleſs agitation, ſhe
ran over the paper which once a week a
travelling newſman brought from Exeter,
and where ſhe knew the marriage of a
man of ſo much conſequence in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
would not fail to be inſerted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0206900201:208"/>
No ſuch intelligence however appeared;
and Celeſtina, imagining that the marriage
had notwithſtanding certainly taken place,
endeavoured, ſince ſhe could not conquer
her regret, to divert it, by trying what
ſhe could do towards ſoftening the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
and relieving the diſtreſſes of the
unfortunate Jeſſy, whoſe patient endurance
of evils, evidently ſeverer than her own,
whoſe fortitude in tearing herſelf perhaps
for ever from the man ſhe loved, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
the indulgence of her affection
to his intereſt, made Celeſtina ſometimes
aſhamed of the murmurs ſhe found excited
in her heart by leſs inconveniences, and
bluſh at the reluctance with which ſhe had
ſubmitted to the loſs of a man, whoſe regard
for her ſeemed already to have yielded to
the influence of pecuniary advantage, and
family convenience.</p>
            <p>But in deſpite of every argument ſhe
could bring to ſubdue the pain ariſing
from the recollection of loſt happineſs, and
totally ſilence the Syren voice of hope which
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0206900201:209"/>
now and then preſented the poſſibility of
more favourable days, the uncertainty whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the event to which ſhe laboured to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
reconciled had really happened,
diſturbed and rendered her reſtleſs and
uneaſy. Jeſſy, to whom ſhe now ſent to
deſire her company for a little time, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
accepted the ſummons; and in her
company Celeſtina felt great ſatisfaction,
though ſhe had never diſcloſed to her any
part of the ſorrow that oppreſſed her, or
given the remoteſt hint of her attachment
to Willoughby. All the indulgence ſhe
allowed herſelf was, that of ſometimes
chuſing to walk towards a knoll at the
extremity of the common, which afforded
an extenſive view towards the weſt; from
thence, by the help of a teleſcope lent her
by her landlord, Celeſtina had diſcovered
a clump of firs in Alveſtone Park; and
though they were near ten miles diſtant,
and without a glaſs appeared only a dark
ſpot above the reſt of the landſcape, ſhe
found a melancholy pleaſure in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0206900201:210"/>
them, and would frequently, as
ſhe leant on Jeſſy's arm in their penſive
rambles, fix her eyes on that diſtant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
gaze on it ſteadily for two or three
minutes, and then with a deep ſigh turn
away, and walk ſilently home.</p>
            <p>She encouraged however the artleſs
Jeſſy to talk to her of Cathcart; and the
poor girl, pleaſed with every opportunity
of repeating his name, and flattered by the
tender intereſt Celeſtina took in their
ſtory, was never weary of ſpeaking of him.
She at length acquired confidence enough
to produce ſome of the letters he wrote to
her; and Celeſtina, who had very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
imputed much of the praiſe Jeſſy had
beſtowed on his writing and on his ſtyle
to the fond partiality of her affection for
him, was ſurpriſed to find in theſe letters
the moſt manly, clear, and ſenſible ſtile
ſhe had almoſt ever met with. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
emulation which appeared between
theſe lovers, their diſintereſted tenderneſs,
and the ſteadineſs of their mutual attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0206900201:211"/>
raiſed in Celeſtina admiration and
even reſpect, and every hour encreaſed her
inclination to contribute to their happineſs.</p>
            <p>But theſe intentions ſhe had no way
of executing but by means of Willoughby,
who was, as ſhe knew from long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
ever ready to befriend the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
and on ſuch an occaſion ſhe thought,
that as ſoon as he was married ſhe might,
without any impropriety, addreſs herſelf
to him; and as the farm which old Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington,
the grandfather of Jeſſy, poſſeſſed,
adjoined to his eſtate at Alveſtone, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
imagined he could hardly fail of
having ſome influence, which ſhe knew
he would be ready to exert for her unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
friend.</p>
            <p>In meditating how to adminiſter to the
afflictions of others, her own ſorrows were
at leaſt mitigated: but the calm ſhe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
aſſumed was the mere effort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
while her anxiety to hear of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
and of his ſiſter encreaſed every
hour; and as the delay grew more unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0206900201:212"/>
it became almoſt inſupportably
painful.</p>
            <p>It was now the beginning of March:
the weather was uncommonly cold and
dreary; and a deep ſnow, which had
fallen ſome days before, had confined Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
and her companion almoſt entirely
to the houſe. It was very unuſual to ſee
any perſon paſs by the houſe, near which
there was no public road, and the incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of the ſeaſon rendered it ſtill leſs
frequent: Jeſſy, therefore, who went to
the window by accident to fetch ſome
work that lay there, mentioned to Celeſtina,
as a matter of ſome ſurpriſe, that two foot
paſſengers, who had the appearance of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
were croſſing the common towards
the houſe.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, who was at that moment me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating,
with her eyes fixed on the fire,
on the long, long ſpace of time that had
elapſed ſince ſhe had heard of Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and on all the events that might have
taken place in that period, gave very little
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0206900201:213"/>
attention to this intelligence, and on Jeſſy's
repeating it, anſwered that probably it was
ſome perſons who had loſt their way in
the ſnow and were coming to the houſe
for directions to regain the road.</p>
            <p>To Jeſſy, however, the idea of Cathcart
was ever preſent: one of the ſtrangers was
not unlike him in figure as ſhe fancied,
though both were wrapped in great coats;
and the poſſibility of his having come in
ſearch of her, had no ſooner ſtruck her,
than with eager eyes and a beating heart
ſhe watched every ſtep they took: at
length they entered the little gate that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the garden of the houſe from the
common; Jeſſy was then convinced that
neither of them were Cathcart; but her
curioſity was ſtrongly excited, and liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the queſtions they put to the ſervant
who went to the door, ſhe diſtinctly heard
one of them enquire for Miſs de Mornay.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina was now in her turn alarmed;
and trembling, though ſhe knew not why,
ſhe deſired Jeſſy to go down and aſk who
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0206900201:214"/>
it was, but before ſhe could be obeyed the
door opened, and ſhe ſaw, with emotions
to which language cannot do juſtice—Willoughby
himſelf!</p>
            <p>The firſt idea that ſtruck her was, that
he was come to announce his marriage;
and the air of triumph and ſatisfaction his
countenance wore, ſeemed to tell her he
was the happy huſband of Miſs Fitz-Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
Long as ſhe had been accuſtomed
to dwell on this idea, ſhe ſhrunk with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
from it's ſuppoſed reality, and pale and
trembling drew back, as he eagerly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
towards her:—"My heavenly
girl! my own Celeſtina!" cried he as he
took her hand. This addreſs, from the
married Willoughby, ſeemed an inſult: ſhe
withdrew her hand with an air of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
would have ſpoken but could not,
and unable to ſupport herſelf ſat down.</p>
            <p>Willoughby, whoſe own anxious emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
had too much prevented his conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
how ſhe might be affected by his
abrupt appearance, now ſaw that he had
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0206900201:215"/>
been too precipitate. He placed himſelf
by her, and again taking the hand ſhe had
withdrawn, he enquired, with more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
and leſs impetuoſity, if ſhe was
ſorry to ſee him. Again Celeſtina would
have ſpoken, but her native pride again
refuſed to aſſiſt her; and while ſhe was
vainly endeavouring to acquire reſolution
enough to congratulate him on his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
marriage, ſhe learned that he had
not only broken for ever with Miſs Fitz-Hayman,
but was come to offer himſelf
to her, who had from his childhood been
the ſole poſſeſſor of his affections.</p>
            <p>This ſudden and unexpected happineſs
was too much. Her reaſon, which in the
ſevereſt calamity had never quite deſerted
her, now ſeemed unequal to tidings ſo
overwhelming, and for a moment or
two ſhe ſat like a ſtatue; till Willoughby,
in that well known voice, and with that
graceful and manly tenderneſs which had
rendered him ever ſo dear to her, related
all that had paſſed from the hour of their
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0206900201:216"/>
laſt parting, and the reſolution he had
adopted of ſacrificing that wealth, which
could not beſtow happineſs, to the long
and incurable paſſion he had conceived
for an object ſo deſerving, and without
whom no advantages of fortune or ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could give his life the ſmalleſt value.</p>
            <p>Tears of gratitude and affection now
fell from the eyes of Celeſtina; and as he
found the tumult of her ſpirits ſubſide, he
went on to relate to her, with the moſt
generous delicacy, the plans he had formed
for their future life, and the means by
which he hoped to retrieve his affairs,
without ſacrificing his happineſs. Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
however as he touched on theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
his violated promiſe to his mother
returned with all it's force to the recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Celeſtina. Willoughby, whoſe
eyes were fixed on her's, ſaw the painful
idea by their expreſſion as ſoon as it aroſe,
and in a voice that trembled from emotions
he could not repreſs, he endeavoured to
obviate the objections he feared ſhe was
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0206900201:217"/>
about to make, even before ſhe could ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them.</p>
            <p>All his eloquence, however, could not
ſilence that monitor in the breaſt of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
which told her that there was
more of ſophiſtry than of ſound reaſon in
his arguments; but fondly attached to
him as ſhe was, it was ſophiſtry too en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting
for her to have courage to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
detecting it. She wiſhed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
Willoughby was right; to ſee him
happy had almoſt from her earlieſt recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
been the ſecond wiſh of her heart;
for perhaps to have the power of making
him ſo had always, even unknown to
herſelf, been the firſt: that happineſs
ſeemed now to depend upon her; and ſhe
determined (after one of thoſe ſhort ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,
in which, when inclination and duty
contend, the former has too often the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,)
to ſtiſle within her own boſom
every painful remembrance, to think as
he thought, and in rendering happy the
ſon of her beneſactreſs, to acquit herſelf
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0206900201:218"/>
through her future life of the debt of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
ſhe owed her.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, therefore, made no objection
to the propoſals Willoughby laid before
her, which were, that they ſhould be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
privately in about ten days, and take
up their abode at Alveſtone in the ſame
ſtile they meant always to reſide in. Theſe
preliminaries being arranged, Willoughby
beſought her to permit him to introduce
Vavaſour to her, who had been waiting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
he went down himſelf to bring up
his friend; and Celeſtina, in the moment
of his abſence, endeavoured to recall her
preſence of mind, and habituate herſelf to
think with leſs agitation on the happineſs
of being the wife of her beloved Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby.</p>
            <p>Vavaſour, from the ardour with which
his friend had ſpoken of her perſonal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
was prepared to find her very
lovely; and Willoughby on their firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview
watched his looks, trying to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
if his expectations had been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered:
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0206900201:219"/>
they were compleatly ſo: the
agitation ſhe had ſuffered had raiſed the
glow of her cheeks, and given more ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to her eyes, in which the tears yet trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
while the natural dignity of her
manner received in his opinion new charms
from the remains of embarraſſment which
ſhe endeavoured to ſhake off, and in which,
after a few moments, ſhe ſucceeded ſo well,
that they all became as much at their eaſe
as if they had all been as long acquainted
as Willoughby and Celeſtina.</p>
            <p>Jeſſy, who had left the room on Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby's
firſt entrance, was now deſired
by Celeſtina to return. During her ſhort
abſence, while ſhe prepared a repaſt of
cold meat for the hungry travellers who
had walked from Alveſtone, Celeſtina re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to them as much of her hiſtory as
intereſted both of them in her favour; and
Willoughby, who found in every ſentiment
and every action of Celeſtina ſomething
to encreaſe his tenderneſs and admiration,
was charmed with the generous pity ſhe
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0206900201:220"/>
had ſhewn to her humble friend, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
her all his influence to obtain for
her the proviſion ſhe had a right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from her grandfather, and unite her
to her deſerving lover.</p>
            <p>Willoughby hung with fondneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
to adoration on every word Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
uttered, and forgot, that for this time
the delight of ſeeing her muſt be ſhort;
Vavaſour, gay, volatile, and enjoying
with extreme good humour the happineſs
of his friend, was little accuſtomed to think
at all; and Jeſſy was in too humble a
ſituation to offer her opinion: on Celeſtina
only, therefore, the prudence of the whole
party depended; and as the ſnow was very
deep, and they had between eight and nine
miles to Alveſtone, ſhe at laſt ventured
to hint that it was time they ſhould go.</p>
            <p>To Willoughby, the neceſſity of quitting
her had never occurred, and he now heard
of it as a ſentence of baniſhment; but
Celeſtina repeating that ſhe ſhould be very
uneaſy if in ſuch weather they delayed ſo
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0206900201:221"/>
long a walk to a late hour in the evening, he
ſaw that he ſhould make her really uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
by his ſtay; and having obtained
leave to ſee her the next day, and every
day till they were to part no more, he at
laſt conſented to go, that he and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
might reach Alveſtone before the
night fell.</p>
            <p>When he releaſed the hand of Celeſtina,
which he kiſſed a thouſand times as he
bade her adieu, ſhe turned towards the
window, and her eyes followed him
acroſs the heath till the furze and
thorns at a diſtance concealed him from
her sight. The very traces of his footſteps
in the ſnow were dear to her; and in that
frame of mind which renders it hardly
conſcious of it's own ſenſations, ſhe ſtill
gazed on <hi>them</hi> when ſhe could diſtinguiſh
<hi>him</hi> no longer. Jeſſy, though ſhe could
eaſily account for her ſilence, became
after ſome time uneaſy, and ſpeaking to
her, rouſed her from her reverie: ſhe then
ſat down in her uſual place, and attempted
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0206900201:222"/>
to quiet the perturbation of her mind by
re-aſſuming her uſual occupations; but
the ſudden tranſition within the laſt three
hours, from lifeleſs deſpondence to a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of the utmoſt felicity ſhe had ever
imagined, was too violent to ſuffer her
ſpirits to return to their uſual calm. The
recollection of her deceaſed benefactreſs,
and of the fatal promiſe Willoughby had
given her, recurred in deſpite of her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to eſcape from it: and though,
reſolute as he appeared to be, to reconcile
himſelf to its violation, there was nobody
who had power by their interference to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the execution of the determination he
had made; though nothing was likely to
prevent the marriage on which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
upon; yet the mind of Celeſtina re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
impreſſed with a confuſed ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
rather than any diſtinct proſpect of
the happineſs ſhe had been offered; and
the tranſactions of the day appeared like a
dream, from which ſhe feared, by examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it's reality, to be awakened.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
            <p>NEITHER the perſon or the mind
of Celeſtina were of that ſort which make
the ſtrongeſt impreſſion on the firſt view;
and intereſting as her figure and face were,
it was the grace as well as the ſymmetry of
the former, and the expreſſion rather than
the beauty of the latter that made her
altogether ſo enchanting. Willoughby
and Vavaſour were now with her every
day; and while her lover found in every
hour of thoſe days more reaſon to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
himſelf on the choice he had made,
his friend grew inſenſibly ſo intereſted for
Celeſtina, that volatile and unſteady as he
had been till then, he found, that though,
conſidering her already as Willoughby's
wife, he could form neither hopes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0206900201:224"/>
for himſelf, yet that her happineſs
was the firſt wiſh of his heart; and that
without violating his warm friendſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his friend, he, for the firſt time in
his life, envied a man who was going to
be married.</p>
            <p>The preſent happineſs of Willoughby
could be exceeded in his idea only by that
which he imagined he had ſecured to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by having determined to live only for
the happineſs of Celeſtina; and in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
contemplating her perfections, he
endeavoured to juſtify to himſelf the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
he had taken, and to diſmiſs from
his mind the unpleaſing circumſtances
which might have robbed him of her for
ever. He had written, after many attempts,
to Lord Caſtlenorth, declining to carry any
farther a negociation in which his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
had never any ſhare; and though he
ſoftened this mortifying information as
well as he could, he was ſenſible of the
bitterneſs and reſentment it muſt create,
and indeed was ſo little ſatisfied himſelf
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0206900201:225"/>
with his performance, that after the fifth or
ſixth attempt, he would ſtill have delayed
or wholly have evaded ſending the letter,
if Vavaſour had not with many arguments
and much difficulty perſuaded him, that,
reſolved as he was to break with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
any letter he could write in explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
would be leſs offenſive than total ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina was very ſolicitous to know
how he had acquitted himſelf towards his
uncle; yet, as he ſeemed ſedulouſly to
avoid the ſubject, ſhe feared to give him
pain by recurring to it, and yielded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
too eaſily to the artifices ſhe ſaw he
uſed to draw her thoughts from it: while
he, ſtudying every turn of her ſpeaking
face, often ſaw, by the penſive caſt it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
uneaſy thoughts ariſe in her mind;
and on thoſe occaſions, exerting himſelf to
diſpel them, he delighted to recall their
ſparkling vivacity to her eyes:
<q>E'l lampeggiar dell' angelico riſo,<note n="*" place="bottom">PETRARCH. The lightning of the angelic ſmile.</note>
               </q>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0206900201:226"/>
which never beſtowed greater charms on
any countenance than on that of Celeſtina.</p>
            <p>It was now decided that as ſoon as the
ſettlements were finiſhed, which Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
had directed rather according to his
love than to his fortune, and which were
likely to take up about three weeks, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
was to become miſtreſs of Alveſtone.
He had promiſed her to forbear making
about that delightful place any of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
he meditated, till his income was
ſo far retrieved as to allow him to do it
with prudence, but he had a thouſand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ready why Celeſtina ſhould go there
every day; for to reſide there entirely, till
ſhe was married, ſhe had refuſed with ſuch
firmneſs as left Willoughby nothing to
urge with any chance of ſucceſs. Partial
as himſelf to this ſpot, where ſhe had
paſſed the happieſt hours of her life, ſhe
yet, in her preſent ſituation, felt diſtreſſed
and uneaſy at the thoughts of viſiting it;
but Willoughby preſſed it with ſo much
earneſtneſs, that, as the weather was now
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0206900201:227"/>
fine, and ſhe had defended herſelf as long
as ſhe could, ſhe at length, on condition
of having Jeſſy with her, agreed to go
there for a whole day, and that Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
ſhould fetch them both in his
phaeton. <hi>C'eſt le premier pas qui coute,</hi>
ſays a French proverb; and he longed to
have this day over, knowing that the
memorials of his mother, which Celeſtina
would there meet with, and which he
feared would give her ſome uneaſy ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
would, after ſhe was accuſtomed to
ſee them, loſe their effect on her mind,
and that ſhe would inſenſibly learn to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them rather with agreeable than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy
ſentiments.</p>
            <p>He perſuaded himſelf that ſuch a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
had been effected in his own mind,
and that notwithſtanding his clear recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of certain forcible words his mother
had uſed in their laſt melancholy inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
he was, in making himſelf happy,
doing that, which, if ſhe had yet any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0206900201:228"/>
of human events, ſhe would moſt
warmly approve.</p>
            <p>Intoxicated with his paſſion, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and taſte ſeemed ſo entirely to juſtify,
and an extorted promiſe only to oppoſe,
Willoughby no longer ſuffered any uneaſy
recollections to caſt a ſhade over the
bright proſpect opening before him. He
now ſaw Celeſtina, the woman he had
from his infancy adored, in that ſpot where
his local affections were ſo fondly ſettled.
Nothing ſeemed likely to impede his paſſing
with her there a life of uninterrupted feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
and till their union could take place,
his greateſt anxiety was to detach her
imagination from all thoſe objections which
might yet linger in her mind, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
her in the perſuaſion that to conſtitute
through her future life the happineſs of the
ſon of her benefactreſs, would be her beſt
acquittal of thoſe obligations ſhe owed to
her in the early part of it.</p>
            <p>Inſtead, therefore, of ſuffering her to
viſit immediately the particular parts of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0206900201:229"/>
the houſe which he knew would moſt
forcibly recall ideas which might diſtreſs
her, he deſired Vavaſour to attend on Jeſſy,
and follow them into the garden, where,
when they were at a little diſtance, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to Celeſtina the meaſures he had
already taken to reſtore or rather to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
her amiable and injured friend to
the favour of her grandfather. Celeſtina
warmly approved his proceedings, and
gratefully acknowledged his kindneſs,
while the hope of ſeeing Jeſſy reſcued
from the ſevere hardſhips to which ſhe muſt
otherwiſe be expoſed, and rewarding the
diſintereſted attachment of her deſerving
lover, was moſt grateful to her generous
heart. Willoughby himſelf never ſeemed
ſo perfect as when thus employing his time
and his power in the ſervice of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.
The fine ſcenery around her ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
appeared to ſuch advantage as now,
when ſhe leaned on one arm while with
the other he pointed out to her its various
beauties; and at this moment the very
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0206900201:230"/>
ſeaſon ſeemed to add ſomething to her
felicity. Within a few days the whole
face of nature was changed: the ſnow,
which had covered every object with
cold uniformity, had now given place
to the bright verdure of infant ſpring;
the earlieſt trees and thoſe in the moſt
ſheltered ſituations had put forth their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
buds; the copſes were ſtrewn with
primroſes and March violets, and the
garden glowing with the firſt flowers of
the year; while inſtead of the uſually rude
winds of the ſeaſon, thoſe gales only blew
which
<q>
                  <l>Call forth the long expecting flowers</l>
                  <l>And wake the purple year!</l>
               </q>
Myriads of birds, who found food and
ſhelter amid the ſhrubberies and wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walks,
ſeemed to hail with ſongs their
future lovely protectreſs,
<q>Hopp'd in her walks and gambol'd in her eyes:</q>
and while every thing was thus gay and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0206900201:231"/>
cheerful without, the houſe, when ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
it, ſhewed her only contented faces:
the old ſervants, it's ancient and faithful
inhabitants, had known and loved her from
her earlieſt childhood, and rejoiced in the
hope of ending their days in her ſervice;
the tenants, who loved their young land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
were glad to find, that inſtead of
carrying his rents to London he was
coming to ſettle among them; and the
poor, who had now for ſome time ſeverely
miſſed the bounty which had marked Mrs.
Willoughby's annual reſidence among
them, invoked bleſſings on her ſon, from
whom they were aſſured of more conſtant
conſideration, from his own noble nature
as well as from the influence of Celeſtina,
who, as they well remembered, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
the ſucceſsful mediatrix between
them and their deceaſed miſtreſs, when
her own daughter had frequently heard
their petitions with indifference, or avoided
them with diſguſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0206900201:232"/>
In a few days after this firſt viſit to
Alveſtone, a fortunate circumſtance oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
to facilitate the good offices Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
had undertaken in favour of
Jeſſy Woodburn. The old female rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
who had acquired unbounded influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
over her grandfather died ſuddenly;
and the old man, thus reſtored to the little
power of reflection his very advanced age
left him, and alarmed by the death of a
perſon younger than himſelf, no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to liſten to the remonſtrances of a
clergyman in the neighbourhood, who had
by Willoughby been engaged to ſpeak to
him in favour of his daughter's child. He
conſented to ſee her, provided no attempt
was made to introduce her father to him,
towards whom neither time, age, or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
had blunted the aſperity of his hatred;
but though theſe odious paſſions retained,
from habitual indulgence, all their inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
malignity, the ſofter feelings of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
affection were dead in him; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yielding to importunity than prompted
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0206900201:233"/>
by inclination, he conſented to receive
his granddaughter to officiate about him as
a ſervant, and ſtipulated that during his
life ſhe ſhould be no expence to him;
thus graſping to the laſt moment of his
exiſtence, that which he had never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
and could no longer want. As he
had nobody he valued more, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
however, after many perſuaſions, to
make a will, by which he gave her every
thing, on the expreſs condition, to uſe his
own phraſe, that her father "might never
be the better for it."</p>
            <p>It was neceſſary, though this important
point was carried, that Jeſſy ſhould, by
reſiding with him, preclude the poſſibility
of being again ſuperceded by ſome of
thoſe mercenary beings who are in all
ranks of life ready to ſurround the couch
of the dying miſer: a neceſſity Celeſtina
admitted with reluctance, and Jeſſy with
tears and regret; but they were both
conſoled by the reflection that a very
ſhort time muſt in ſome degree re-unite
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0206900201:234"/>
them by the removal of Celeſtina to Alveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone,
which was within a walk of the farm
at which her friend was now to reſide.</p>
            <p>Willoughby, having thus far ſucceeded
for the intereſting protegée of Celeſtina,
determined to complete his generous work
by attending to the ſituation of Cathcart.
He knew nothing could more highly
oblige <hi>her,</hi> to contribute to whoſe ſlighteſt
ſatisfaction was the ſupreme pleaſure of
his life; and his own good heart prompted
him to loſe no time in relieving the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited
diſtreſſes of a deſerving young
man: he wrote, therefore, (without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
what he had done) to Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart,
encloſed him a bank note for his
expences; and informing him of all that
paſſed in regard to Jeſſy, deſired that he
would relinquiſh his place with the attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and come down to Alveſtone, where
Willoughby meant that the ſame day which
gave him Celeſtina ſhould unite Cathcart
to her humble friend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0206900201:235"/>
The joy this unexpected turn of fortune
gave to Cathcart can better be imagined
than deſcribed. That ſickneſs of the ſoul,
which long deſpondence and anxiety had
produced, vaniſhed at once: his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
care was to ſecure his ſiſter's and
her children's ſupport during his abſence;
and reſerving to himſelf no more of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby's
generous preſent than ſufficed
for the expences of his journey, he took a
tender leave of Mrs. Elphinſtone, aſſuring
her that the firſt uſe he would make of his
good fortune ſhould be to aſſiſt her; he
then ſet out on a hired horſe for Alveſtone,
where he arrived ten days before that which
was fixed upon for his patron's happineſs
and his own.</p>
            <p>If Willoughby had been greatly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
for him before he ſaw him, he was
much more ſo now that he found him very
intelligent and well informed, with abilities
that might have made his way to any ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of life, and a heart that would
have done honour to the moſt exalted:
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0206900201:236"/>
his knowledge, which was very extenſive,
was without pedantry, and his gratitude
without ſervility. The meeting between
him and Jeſſy, at which Willoughby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
that Celeſtina ſhould be preſent,
was very affecting; and after the firſt
tranſports of happineſs ſo unexpected had
a little ſubſided, Willoughby explained
to them his views for the future. "You,
my dear Jeſſy," ſaid he, "muſt not think
of leaving your grandfather, who muſt
know nothing of your marriage while he
lives, which can, according to the courſe
of nature, be only a very little time; and
as you may ſee each other every day, this
partial ſeparation may for that little time
be eaſily borne. As for you, Cathcart,
you will ſtay with me: I have, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of my new plan of life, many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations
to make, and many accounts to
ſettle, in which you can be of great uſe
to me. Poor Beechcroft, my old ſteward,
is in his eightieth year, and the palſy has
lately made ſuch ravages in his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0206900201:237"/>
that he is unequal to the common
buſineſs of his office; while he lives how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and thinks himſelf capable of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
his truſt, I am very unwilling to
mortify him by taking the affairs out of
his hands: at his death I ſhall not replace
him, but become my own ſteward; and
you, my good friend, can be of the moſt
effectual ſervice to me in preparing every
thing for this arrangement: while your
neighbourhood to the eſtate of which you
will probably ſoon become maſter, will
give you an opportunity of inſpecting it,
and ſettling thoſe plans for the future
which will I hope and believe make you
a very fortunate man."</p>
            <p>While the conſiderate kindneſs of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
endeared him every hour to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
and while the hearts of Cathcart
and Jeſſy overflowed with gratitude, it
would have been hardly poſſible for a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
party to have been any where found
than that which now occaſionally inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
Alveſtone, if the painful recollection
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0206900201:238"/>
of Willoughby's violated promiſe could
have been entirely expelled from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
recollection of Celeſtina, and if
Vavaſour had not ſometimes felt towards
Celeſtina ſomething bordering on ſerious
love, which was a ſentiment ſo new to
him, who had never thought with reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
affection of any woman before, and
had paſſed too much of his time in ſcenes
of faſhionable debauchery, that he hardly
knew himſelf what it meant. He formed
however no deſigns, for his temper was
generous, candid, and artleſs; ſo artleſs
indeed that he took no pains to conceal
what he felt almoſt without underſtanding
his feelings; and frequently fixed his
eyes on Celeſtina with ſo impaſſioned a
look, or ſpoke to her, or of her, with ſuch
unreſerved marks of fondneſs and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that Jeſſy and Cathcart both ſaw it
with ſome alarm; but Willoughby, too
liberal for jealouſy, and knowing his friend
more inclined to general libertiniſm among
the looſer part of the ſex than capable of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0206900201:239"/>
a particular attachment to any woman of
character; ſure of Celeſtina's affection,
and imputing all Vavaſour's attentions to
his admiration of beauty wherever found,
either noticed not his manner, or held them
to be wholly without conſequence; while
Celeſtina, perfectly unconſcious of the
power of her own charms, treated him
with that affectionate familiarity which his
own open and lively manners encouraged,
and which his friendſhip for Willoughby,
and the obligations they both owed to him,
juſtified.</p>
            <p>Only three days were now to intervene
before that fixed for the double wedding,
which was to be celebrated in the pariſh
church at Alveſtone, in the preſence only
of two truſty ſervants, and Vavaſour, who
was to act as father to both the brides.</p>
            <p>Very different proſpects of life from
thoſe which now were before Willoughby
and Celeſtina, had opened to Mr. and Mrs.
Molyneux, who, on their arrival in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
had found Sir Oſwald Molyneux
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0206900201:240"/>
juſt alive: he lingered unexpectedly a few
weeks after their arrival, and then died,
leaving to his ſon an immenſe fortune, of
which Sir Philip haſtened to take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and to diſplay, as ſoon as decency
permitted, his wealth and his intereſt;
while Matilda, now Lady Molyneux, loſt
no opportunity of availing herſelf of the
eclat which almoſt boundleſs fortune gave
to novelty. Nobody was ſo much fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
and admired; no taſte was ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
adopted, no parties ſo ſplendidly
attended, as her's; and having thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the ſummit of what ſhe fancied hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
ſhe was in no haſte to return to
England till ſhe had exhauſted the felicity
Ireland offered her, and cheerfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced
in her huſband's propoſal of
ſtaying one ſummer at their magnificent
ſeat about twenty miles from Dublin. In
the mean time ſhe had heard from her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whoſe reſentment towards her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
did not extend to her, of his having
broke with the Caſtlenorths, and his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0206900201:241"/>
in regard to Celeſtina. She diſliked
both Lady Caſtlenorth and her daughter,
and therefore was pleaſed with their morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and diſappointment: ſhe had now
no pecuniary claims on her brother, and
heard therefore with indifference his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to marry a woman without fortune;
and as to Celeſtina, though ſhe was inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of any affection for her, yet ſhe
thought ſhe would make a good quiet wife
for her brother, and be well adapted to that
inſipid domeſtic life, his turn for which
ſhe had always pitied and deſpiſed. As
Willoughby's juſt reſentment againſt Sir
Philip had never given her any concern,
ſhe gave herſelf no trouble to remove it;
and Sir Philip himſelf, above all attention
for the feelings of others, and too much a
man of the very firſt faſhion to underſtand
the claims of relationſhip, or to feel thoſe
of friendſhip, was as unconcerned as if no
ſuch reſentment had ever been deſerved;
and while they both enjoyed their newly
acquired conſequence in Ireland, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0206900201:242"/>
was ſuffered to proceed his own
way at Alveſtone without remonſtrance and
almoſt without notice.</p>
            <p>But neither the neglect of his ſiſter, or
the ſullen reſentment of his uncle and Lady
Caſtlenorth, from whom he heard nothing,
now gave Willoughby any concern: his
happineſs it was out of their power to
diſturb or prevent, ſince one day only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervened
before he was to be the huſband
of Celeſtina.</p>

            <p>VAVASOUR, born to a ſplendid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and left by the early death of his
parents to the care of guardians, who,
while they took ſufficient care of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
had very little influence over his
mind and his morals, had never yet formed
a wiſh which it was not immediately in his
power to gratify: the growing inclination,
therefore, that he found towards Celeſtina, was
painful and uneaſy to him, for he had too
much honour, and too true a regard for
Willoughby, to ſuffer a thought injurious
to him to dwell on his mind; and had he
been capable of entertaining wiſhes or
forming ſchemes againſt his happineſs, he
knew that Celeſtina's attachment to him
was not to be ſhaken, and that he ſhould
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0206900201:244"/>
excite her contempt and abhorrence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of continuing to enjoy that confidence
and regard with which ſhe now favoured
him.</p>
            <p>But the more hopeleſs his partiality for
her was, the more reſtleſs he of courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
in it's encreaſe: for ſeveral days he
endeavoured to conquer or at leaſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
it by redoubling his gaiety: he
romped, laughed, and rattled, till his
violent ſpirits became even diſtreſſing to
Celeſtina: all however would not do; and
as he had no notion of enduring any kind
of uneaſineſs while there was a chance of
relieving himſelf, he at length reſolved to
quit Willoughby, and not to return to him
till after he was actually married; and this
reſolution he prepared to execute the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
morning, which was the preceding
one to that which was fixed for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p>"I ſhall leave you this morning,

            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0206900201:245"/>
"Leave me!" cried Willoughby in

            <p>"Ridiculous! ſurely you are not in

            <p>"Perfectly ſo, believe me: never more

you in a week or ten days, but I poſitively
go this very day."</p>
            <p>"Thou art a ſtrange fellow, and there
is never any telling where to have thee.
Did you not promiſe to be father to the
brides? What will Celeſtina ſay?"</p>
            <p>"Why probably as you do—that I am
a ſtrange fellow."</p>
            <p>"You make me uneaſy, Harry," ſaid
Willoughby very gravely. "Whimſical
and unſettled as you are, it muſt be ſurely
ſomething more than mere whim which
urges you to leave me at ſuch a time."</p>
            <p>"Not at all," anſwered he gaily: "it
is the time in the world you can beſt ſpare
me; and upon my ſoul I have buſineſs
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0206900201:246"/>
to do which I have fooliſhly neglected,
and which I muſt either go after now or a
fortnight hence, when I intend to be with
you; and ſo, my dear George, we'll talk
no more about it: my ſervants are getting
ready, and will be at the door in a minute:
oh they are driving round. Well, George,
God bleſs you, my dear fellow. Give my
love to the girls, and tell Celeſtina to ſave
me a great piece of bride cake."</p>
            <p>Willoughby would again have remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated,
but Vavaſour, in his wild way,
ran on rallying him about his marriage,
and refuſing to liſten to him, till the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricle
was ready; into which he ſtepped,
after again promiſing to return in a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
and immediately drove away.</p>
            <p>Willoughby, though long accuſtomed
to theſe ſtarts of caprice from his thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
friend, was equally ſurpriſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted
at a reſclution for which he could
not account: he was far from the remoteſt
idea of the real cauſe; and, occupied as
his thoughts were by Celeſtina, he inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0206900201:247"/>
not ſo deeply the motives of his
friend's actions as at another time he might
have done.</p>
            <p>On the preceding day, moved by his
tender reproaches that ſhe had no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in his honour, and affected needleſs
precaution, Celeſtina had acceded to his
wiſhes that ſhe would allow him, as the day
was fixed for Thurſday, to fetch her to
Alveſtone in the morning of Wedneſday,
where Jeſſy was to meet her, and that ſhe
would then take her laſt leave of her hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
abode on Thorpe Common.</p>
            <p>As ſoon, therefore, as Vavaſour was
gone, he diſpatched Cathcart for Jeſſy,
and haſtened himſelf to Celeſtina, who was
ready for him. As they journeyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the houſe that was henceforth to be
their home, Willoughby, with more than
uſual tenderneſs in his voice and manner,
entered into a more minute detail than he
had ever yet done of the plans he had
formed for their future life: with the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine
hand of youthful hope, he drew a
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0206900201:248"/>
picture of uninterrupted felicity, which
Celeſtina, involuntarily ſighing, thought
too perfect to be realized; and with timid
apprehenſion, for which ſhe could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
and was unwilling to betray, ſhe
internally aſked herſelf wherefore ſhe could
expect to deſerve or enjoy bleſſings ſo
much ſuperior to the common lot of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
            <p>All, however, that might have been to
another an alloy to happineſs, was none
to her, ſo far as it related only to herſelf.
In marrying her, Willoughby had reſigned
all proſpect of ever reſtoring his family to
the ſplendid fortune and high conſequence
poſſeſſed by his anceſtors, nor could he
even retrieve the eſtate he had left, or
keep up the place he was ſo fond of, but
by relinquiſhing all ſuperfluous expences,
and confining himſelf to that mode of life,
which was ſome years ſince adopted, but
would now be thought below the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of a man poſſeſſed only of a thouſand
a year: in fact Willoughby found, on a
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0206900201:249"/>
cloſe inſpection of his affairs, that by living
within that income, he might in about ten
years clear, without diſmembering his
eſtate. "It is enough for happineſs, my
Celeſtina," he would ſay; "it is enough
to afford us all the decencies, and all the
comforts of life, and to aſſiſt thoſe who
may not have either. Oh how little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
we ſhall have to envy thoſe who have
more." Celeſtina aſſented with her whole
heart; and if ever an uneaſy reflection
aroſe there for a moment, repreſenting that
for her he reſigned the ſplendour and
luxury in which he might have lived, ſhe
recollected her opinion of the greater part
of thoſe who moved amid a ſucceſſion of
thoſe luxuries, and aſked herſelf whether
there was one among them who was ſo
much reſpected by others, or ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with himſelf, as Willoughby would
probably be, living as he propoſed. She
remembered how often, when ſhe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to ſee nearly many of thoſe, who,
by adventitious advantages, dazzle at a
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0206900201:250"/>
diſtance, ſhe had been compelled to aſſent
to the truth of that ſevere expreſſion of
the satiriſt's, which ſays, that it may be
ſeen—
<q>
                  <l>Of how ſmall eſtimation is exorbitant wealth</l>
                  <l>In the ſight of God,</l>
                  <l>By his beſtowing it on the moſt unworthy</l>
                  <l>Of all mortals.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The departure of Vavaſour, of which
Willoughby had, with ſome marks of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
and ſurpriſe, on his firſt meeting Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
informed her, had given her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
as it ſeemed to have been a diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
to him; but for herſelf, ſhe
felt rather relieved by the abſence of a
too lively gueſt. There was at times an
unguarded vivacity about him, of which
ſhe was not always able to check the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
and though ſhe had never any idea
of his partiality to her, nor thought him
capable of a ſerious attachment to any
woman, there had of late been a warmth
and earneſtneſs in his manner which ſhe was
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0206900201:251"/>
afraid of being called prudiſh if ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to repreſs, and yet ſhe could not
but feel that it was improper to allow
it in her preſent ſituation, and would
be more ſo when ſhe became the wife of
Willoughby. On their arrival at Alveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone,
the lawyer was ready with the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
they were immediately executed in
the preſence of Cathcart and Jeſſy; and
when that unpleaſant ceremony was over,
a walk filled up the time till dinner.
Nothing was ever ſo gay and happy as
Willoughby: Celeſtina was now miſtreſs
of his houſe: his happineſs was ſecured al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
beyond the reach of fate: and ſince
only a few hours were to intervene before
their marriage, he tenderly chid Celeſtina
for her penſive gravity, and endeavoured
to engage her thoughts by neceſſary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements
that he propoſed in the houſe,
and by enlarging on thoſe topics which ſhe
had liſtened to with ſo much complacency
in the morning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0206900201:252"/>
After dinner another walk was propoſed;
but juſt as they were riſing from table, a
ſervant entered with a letter for Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
which he ſaid had been brought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
from Exeter.</p>
            <p>He broke the ſeal, which, like the hand
of the direction, was unknown to him;
he ran over the contents haſtily, changing
countenance as he read; and then enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
if the meſſenger waited, haſtily left
the room.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, who watched his looks, was
alarmed both by them, and his manner of
leaving the room. A moment's reflection
ſubdued her apprehenſions; but they were
preſently renewed and heightened by his
ſending to ſpeak with Cathcart; who, after
being with him almoſt a quarter of an
hour, returned by his directions to inform
her, that he was gone on horſeback to
Exeter to meet ſome people who had ſent
to him about buſineſs which would admit
of no delay: he begged Cathcart to tell
her that it would be ſoon diſpatched, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0206900201:253"/>
that he ſhould certainly return in a few
hours.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina knew, from his own account,
every circumſtance of his fortune; ſhe
knew that except the mortgages on his
eſtate, the intereſt of which had been
punctually paid, he had no pecuniary
claims to anſwer but his debt to Vavaſour:
ſhe was equally certain that he had no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with any body, and that therefore it
could not be an affair of honour, and ſhe
thought it certain that if Lady Molyneux
or any of his relations had been in the
neighbourhood, he would have made no
myſtery of their arrival: his abrupt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
therefore, without ſeeing her, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
and troubled her; and neither her
own reaſon, which urged how unlikely
it was that any diſagreeable buſineſs ſhould
detain him, or the arguments of Cathcart
and Jeſſy, could quiet or mitigate the
anxiety which every moment of his abſence
encreaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0206900201:254"/>
Four, five, ſix hours, had now been
paſſed by Celeſtina, while it was light, in
traverſing the avenue and the road that led
towards Exeter; and after it became dark,
in liſtening at the door to every noiſe.
It was ten o'clock: a ſtill, ſtar-light night:
a low wind conveyed now the diſtant mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
of the water-fall in the park, now
the voices of men from the village, where
every thing ſoon ſunk into repoſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cathcart nor Jeſſy could longer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
their fears, though neither knew
what to dread; but while they affected to
believe Celeſtina's apprehenſions in great
meaſure groundleſs, their anxious returns
to the door to liſten, their reſtleſs inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and various conjectures, convinced
her too evidently that they participated the
fears they pretended to condemn.</p>
            <p>At length about eleven o'clock, a horſe,
or as they were willing to believe, horſes,
were heard to come faſt along the road:
the park gate opened and ſhut with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
It was Willoughby they all fondly
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0206900201:255"/>
hoped: all ran out eagerly, impatient
to meet him: as the horſeman ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
however, they diſtinguiſhed
him to be not Willoughby, but the ſervant
who had attended him.</p>
            <p>"Where is your Maſter, Hugh?" ſaid
Celeſtina; "is he coming? is he well?"</p>
            <p>The man took a letter from his pocket,
and anſwered in a dejected tone—"No,
Madam, not coming: he ſent me with
this letter to Mr. Cathcart."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina followed trembling, while
Cathcart ran into the hall, and by the
light which hung there, read theſe words:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Dear Cathcart,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>come to me imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.
I ſhall not return to-night. I
know not if—But aſſure Celeſtina of
my ſafety. Loſe not a moment in
coming to</p>
                  <closer>
                     <signed>your's ever,
G. W.</signed> 
                     <dateline>
                        <hi>Swan, Exeter,</hi>
                        <date>Wedneſday night.</date>
                     </dateline>
                  </closer>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0206900201:256"/>
The painful ſuſpenſe Celeſtina had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
endured, was happineſs and eaſe in
compariſon of the vague but terrible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
that now ſeized her. What
could detain him againſt his wiſhes? what
meant the unfiniſhed ſentence—"I know
not if—?" what could he want with
Cathcart? and why not diſcloſe the cauſe
of his ſtay, and his buſineſs with Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart,
if it was only an affair of little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
ſince he could not but know
how much his ſudden departure muſt
alarm her. The note too ſeemed to have
been written with a trembling hand; the
lines were crooked, and the letters hardly
formed, and the paper blotted: all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted
hurry and confuſion, very unlike
Willoughby's manner in matters of mere
buſineſs; and the indications of ſome
impending evil, alarming enough in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
were exaggerated by the terrors
which had now taken entire poſſeſſion of
the mind of Celeſtina. Unable to reſtrain
her emotions, ſhe ran, hardly knowing
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0206900201:257"/>
whither ſhe went, to the ſtable, where the
ſervant who had brought the note was
getting ready the horſe on which Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart
was to go. She eagerly queſtioned
the man who was with his maſter? He
anſwered that he did not know: that he
ſaw nobody with him, but he had heard at
the inn that two ladies had come thither
that morning, who had ſent the meſſenger
to Alveſtone; that he believed they had
been with his maſter, but he did not
know, and when his maſter ſpoke to him,
and gave him the letter for Mr. Cathcart,
he was alone, and ſeemed very uneaſy,
ſaying however little more to him than to
deſire he would make what haſte he could.</p>
            <p>This account ſerved only to encreaſe
the terrible obſcurity which tormented
Celeſtina. A thouſand other queſtions oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred.
Were theſe ladies yet at the inn?
Did they travel in their own chaiſe? Had
they ſervants with them? Hugh could
not anſwer the firſt queſtion; but the other
two being ſuch as lay more within the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0206900201:258"/>
reach of his obſervation, he anſwered that
there were certainly neither ſervants nor
horſes at the inn belonging to any ſtranger
when he came away.</p>
            <p>Cathcart was by this time ready; and
ſeeing the extreme inquietude of Celeſtina,
he aſſumed the appearance of tranquillity
he was far from feeling, ſaid that it was
probably ſome buſineſs relative to Mr.
Willoughby's eſtates, which had been
overlooked and neglected; that at all
events he would be back in a few hours,
when it was almoſt certain that if Mr.
Willoughby did not return himſelf, he
ſhould be commiſſioned fully to acquaint
her of the reaſons of his detention, and
convince her that her fears for his ſafety
were groundleſs: in the mean time he
beſought her to endeavour to quiet her
ſpirits and to take ſome repoſe. Cathcart
then departed; and Celeſtina, leaning on
the arm of Jeſſy, returned to the houſe;
but to follow the advice he had given her,
was not in her power; the little ſhe
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0206900201:259"/>
had gathered from the ſervant ſerved to
awaken new alarms, not leſs painful, though
very different from thoſe which had at firſt
aſſailed her: then ſhe had a confuſed idea
that the abrupt departure of Vavaſour had
been occaſioned by ſome miſunderſtanding
between them, which had produced a
challenge; it was unlikely, but it was not
impoſſible: now ſhe gave up that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
for another, and ſuppoſed that Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
might have formed ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
or engagement with ſome woman,
who, hearing of his intended marriage,
had thus prevented it by urging her prior
claim to his hand: this ſuppoſition was,
however, more improbable than the other,
from his known integrity and unblemiſhed
honour, from his long and tender attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to her, and from the whole tenor of
his morals and his conduct; but however
unlikely, it was not quite impoſſible; and
the anxious and alarmed ſpirit of Celeſtina
ran over the remoteſt poſſibilities, but
found in all only exchange of anguiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0206900201:260"/>
As Cathcart had promiſed to return in a
few hours, Celeſtina, certain of not being
able to ſleep, would not go to bed; and
Jeſſy, who ſhared all her ſolicitude, ſat
up with her. As the time approached
that Cathcart had named for the probable
period of his return, they were again both
at the window, and again eagerly liſtening
to every noiſe. The ſun aroſe, but diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
not the objects of their ſolicitude;
and Celeſtina, now unable to reſt within
the houſe, beſought Jeſſy to go down with
her to the end of the long avenue of elms
and into the road, as if the attempt to
meet thoſe they expected rendered the
ſuſpenſe leſs diſtracting.</p>
            <p>Weary of conjecture, and fatigued both
in mind and body, they moved ſlowly and
melancholy along: neither of them ſpoke,
for neither had any comfort to offer the
other. Of the labourers, who were come
by this time to their work, they enquired
if they had heard of their maſter, or ſeen
Mr. Cathcart on the road. But no intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0206900201:261"/>
could be gained of either. The
peaſants, however, alarmed by the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and by the looks of thoſe who aſked
them, all eagerly offered to go any where,
to do any thing their maſter's ſervice might
require, and begged Celeſtina to employ
them: but though ſhe had ſeveral times,
during the long and anxious night, thought
of ſending a meſſenger with a letter to
Willoughby, or even of going herſelf,
ſhe now remembered that all the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
ſhe could gain from the firſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
ſhe would probably receive from
Cathcart before any meſſenger could get
to Exeter; and for the ſecond, that it
might be diſpleaſing to Willoughby, were
ſhe to appear thus prying into his actions
and miſtruſtful of his honour.</p>
            <p>Nothing, therefore, remained but to
bear, with what firmneſs ſhe could, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
which every moment rendered more
inſupportably cruel. Hardly conſcious of
what ſhe was doing, and inſenſible of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
fatigue, ſhe had advanced near a
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0206900201:262"/>
mile beyond the park, and had partly
croſſed a ſandy heath, over which the high
road lay, when Jeſſy haſtily cried out that
Cathcart was coming: he ſaw them at the
ſame moment; and haſtening on, leaped
from his horſe as ſoon as he came near
them.</p>
            <p>His countenance was little likely to
quiet their fears: he was as pale as death,
and his lips trembled as he ſpoke to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
and aſſured her, in a voice that
ſeemed to contradict the words it hardly
articulated, that Mr. Willoughby was
well, perfectly well, and had authoriſed
him to ſay every thing to her that might
make her eaſy.</p>
            <p>The hurried manner in which he ſpoke
this, the impreſſion of uneaſineſs on his
countenance, and the improbability that
Willoughby ſhould be well and not return
himſelf, all ſtruck forcibly on the mind of
Celeſtina, and convinced her that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
very fatal had happened. "You
deceive me, Cathcart," cried ſhe in the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0206900201:263"/>
wild and tremulous voice of deſpair, "I
know you deceive me. Something very
dreadful has befallen him: he is dead, or
dying: I will go to him, however—I will
know the worſt."</p>
            <p>Cathcart now took her hands, and with
the utmoſt earneſtneſs began again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
his aſſurances that Willoughby was
not only alive but well. Celeſtina, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
him, aſked—"Why then do I
not ſee him? why is he detained? and
what buſineſs of fatal import could keep
him ſo long? Cathcart, I will not, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be deceived: tell me at once what I
have to ſuffer, and I will endeavour to bear
it; but this incertitude, theſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
I cannot endure another hour, nor
another moment.</p>
            <p>While this dialogue paſſed, he had taken
one of her arms within his, and having
made a ſign to Jeſſy to take the other, they
led her gently towards Alveſtone park
gate. Cathcart was ſilent for a moment,
as if conſidering how he could ſoften the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0206900201:264"/>
ſhock which it was neceſſary for him to
give her; while Celeſtina continued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently
urging him to tell her the worſt,
whatever it might be. "Let me repeat
to you, deareſt Madam," ſaid he, "let
me repeat to you, that you have nothing
to fear for the life of our dear friend; and
ſurely whatever other intelligence I have
to impart—"</p>
            <p>"Other intelligence!" cried Celeſtina:
"you have then ſomething to impart
which all my fortitude is required to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
Willoughby—but no! it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible:
he cannot be unworthy—he
cannot have cruelly deceived me—it is
impoſſible—"</p>
            <p>"It is indeed," replied Cathcart, "in
my opinion impoſſible for Mr. Willoughby
to be guilty of any unworthy action. You,
Miſs de Mornay, have, I am convinced, a
ſtrength of underſtanding very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon—"</p>
            <p>"Cathcart," cried Celeſtina with energy,
"this is no time for flattery: prove your
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0206900201:265"/>
opinion of my underſtanding by daring to
entruſt me with this fearful ſecret: the
knowledge of it cannot give me ſo much
pain as your heſitation."</p>
            <p>"I would very fain obey you!" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "What then will you ſay if I tell
you, that, though I am wholly ignorant
of the cauſe of a reſolution ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
ſo unexpected, I am afraid it will
be very long before you ſee Willoughby
again, and that he is now many miles
diſtant from us; though upon my ſoul,
by all my hopes here and hereafter, I ſwear
that I neither know the motives of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
nor whither he is gone."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, prepared as ſhe was for ſome
heavy blow, found this hideous uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
more than ſhe could ſuſtain: that
Willoughby ſhould have quitted her, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
for ever, without aſſigning any
cauſe, at the very moment they were to
be united; that he ſhould not himſelf have
ſeen her to have ſoftened the pain this
cruel and unaccountable event muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict;
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0206900201:266"/>
that he ſhould not even have written
to her, but ſhould, in this abrupt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling
way, abandon her to all the miſery
of endleſs conjecture, regret, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment;
were circumſtances ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
ſo inſupportable, that her reaſon,
which would have ſuſtained her in almoſt
any other exigence, ſeemed for a moment
to yield to this: ſhe became extremely
faint, her knees trembled, a cold dew hung
on her forehead, and all the effort ſhe
could make was, to ſignify by a motion of
her hand that ſhe could go no farther.</p>
            <p>They were then more than half a mile
from the park gate: but the road along
which they were paſſing was worn, and a
bank on either ſide offered her a ſeat. Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart
and Jeſſy ſat down by her, both ſilent,
and almoſt as much affected as ſhe was.
She leaned her head on Jeſſy, and after a
moment a deep ſigh a little relieved her.
She turned her eyes mournfully on Cathcart,
with an expreſſion he perfectly underſtood,
as ſeeming to ſay, tell me all—and I will
try to endure it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0206900201:267"/>
"Do not think, I conjure you, my dear
Madam," continued he, "that the ardent
and tender affection of Mr. Willoughby for
you is diminiſhed. Were it poſſible for me
to do juſtice to the agonies I ſaw him in,
when he told me that a ſtrange neceſſity—a
neceſſity he could not explain—compelled
him to quit you;—if language could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
the wretchedneſs in which he ſeemed
to be involved—"</p>
            <p>"Do not deſcribe it, dear Cathcart,"
ſaid Celeſtina, ſpeaking with difficulty. "I
can bear my own miſery, terrible as it is,
better than the thoughts of his."</p>
            <p>"Mitigate his ſufferings then, amiable
Miſs de Mornay," interrupted Cathcart,
"by collecting all your fortitude, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering
how much reliance you ought
to have on his honour and his affection;
and let me be able to ſay, when I write to
him, that this ſad ſeparation has not injured
your health, nor your opinion of him: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, ſuch is the only intelligence that
can adminiſter any conſolation to the torn
heart of my noble friend."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0206900201:268"/>
"I will try then, Cathcart, that he ſhall
have it. You know where to write to him?
He expects to hear from you, and from me
he wiſhes not to hear?"</p>
            <p>"He told me," reaſſumed Cathcart,
"that as ſoon as he was able he would
write to you himſelf: that he was going
immediately to London: whither he ſhould
go afterwards he knew not; but that a hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
myſtery—Then he ſtopped; ſeemed
to repent having ſaid ſo much; charged me
to aſſure you of his everlaſting affection;
ſtarted from his ſeat; walked about the
room wildly; then again repeated his charge
to me that I would not leave you, or ſuffer
Jeſſy to leave you, but that you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
at Alveſtone till you heard from him:
again he heſitated, doubted, and wringing
my hand, aſked me, with diſturbed looks
and in a tremulous voice, if ever wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
equalled his. I would have beſought
him to tell me from whence it aroſe; but
as if foreſeeing whither my enquiry would
tend, he ſtopped me: "Cathcart," cried he,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0206900201:269"/>
"you know I have great confidence in you,
and that I would entruſt you with this fatal
myſtery, which I go now to clear up; but
I have ſworn never to divulge the cauſe of
my—what can I ſay?—Oh! Celeſtina!
beſt and lovelieſt of human beings! what
muſt be thoſe ſufferings which Willoughby
dares not communicate to you!—which
your pity and tenderneſs—" Again he
broke off, and hurried out of the room.
He returned, however, in a few moments,
ſomewhat more calm; and alarmed as I
had been by his agitation, by the wild ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs
of his manner, and the incoherence
of his words, I thought it better to ſoothe
him than to attempt to obtain an explanation
which it coſt him ſo much even to
ſpeak of: I contented myſelf therefore with
aſſuring him of my implicit obedience to
all his commands, and of my conviction
that whatever might be your diſtreſs and
anxiety, you would acquieſce in all his
wiſhes, and that your reliance on him, your
affection for him, would not be ſhaken by
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0206900201:270"/>
this involuntary ſeparation, which, dear
Sir, continued I, will ſurely be temporary
only; I was going on, but he checked
me—"I know not," ſaid he, with quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—"I
know not—involuntary, God
knows it is, but <hi>when</hi> it will end!—Oh
Celeſtina! is this the day which I have with
ſo much delight anticipated!" He now
ſtruck his open hand on his forehead, again
ſtarted away from me, and again relapſed
into all the agonies of ſorrow."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina had not hitherto ſhed a tear.
Stunned by the greatneſs and ſingularity of
her misfortune, terrified by the evil, which
its obſcurity rendered doubly fearful, her
ſenſes were for ſome moments ſuſpended;
but Willoughby weeping, and in deſpair—Willoughby
torn from her by an inviſible
and reſiſtleſs hand—awakened all her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
and tears filled her eyes, as, with a
deep ſigh, ſhe caſt them towards heaven,
and with claſped hands and in a faint voice
cried—"Wherever he goes—whatſoever
he does—may God protect and bleſs him;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0206900201:271"/>
and if the remembrance of poor Celeſtina
cauſes him any unhappineſs, may he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
her. Indeed, Cathcart," added ſhe,
"indeed his happineſs, and not my own,
has been always the firſt wiſh of my heart."
She would have gone on, but her voice failed
her. After a moment's ſilence, however,
ſhe ſeemed to have found ſome degree of
fortitude and ſtrength—"Let us return to
the houſe, my dear Jeſſy," ſaid ſhe, "while
I am able, and let us there conſider what it
will be right to do."</p>
            <p>Cathcart, glad to ſee her more compoſed
than he had dared to hope, now again led
her forward with the aſſiſtance of Jeſſy.
But their help ſeemed no longer requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite:
ſhe hurried on with as much quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as if ſhe expected her ſuſpenſe to be
terminated on her reaching the houſe;
where ſhe arrived, out of breath, trembling,
and agitated. She ſpoke not, but hurried
through the hall into the library, where
they uſually ſat; and there the firſt object
that ſtruck her was Mr. Thorold, the clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0206900201:272"/>
man who had been engaged to marry them,
the ſame who had, at the requeſt of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
ſo effectually exerted his zeal and
friendſhip in introducing Jeſſy Woodburn
to her grandfather, and of whoſe ſociety
Willoughby was very fond.</p>
            <p>He laid down his book on the entrance
of Celeſtina, and prepared to ſalute her with
cheerful congratulations, for it was not now
more than eight o'clock; he had put his
horſe into the ſtable himſelf as was his cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
and walked into the library, where he
had been ſome time expecting Willoughby,
and began to wonder, as he was a very
early riſer, at his delay.</p>
            <p>All ideas of bridal feſtivity however were
driven from his mind the moment he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the countenance of Celeſtina. "My
dear Miſs De Mornay," cried he, approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her, "are you ill?—has any thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened?"
Celeſtina, ſtruck by the ſight of
him, could not anſwer, but ſat down in the
firſt chair ſhe found, and Cathcart, ſeeing
how greatly ſhe was affected, took Mr.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0206900201:273"/>
Thorold by the arm and led him into the
garden.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina in the mean time leaning
againſt Jeſſy, who hung weeping over her,
attempted again to recover her reſolution
and compoſure. She ſighed deeply. "Jeſſy,
my love," ſaid ſhe, when ſhe could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
her voice, "I wiſh to return to
Thorpe Heath. Methinks I am now an
intruder here: ſend, therefore, for ſome
conveyance for me; and think for me, my
dear friend, for I fear I am incapable of
judging for myſelf."</p>
            <p>The timid and ſoft tempered Jeſſy was but
little likely to direct or ſupport her. "Let
us, deareſt Madam," ſaid ſhe, "ſpeak to
Cathcart again before you take any reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
let us hear Mr. Thorold's opinion."</p>
            <p>"Do you then attend them for that
purpoſe," replied Celeſtina, "for myſelf, I
cannot hear them. I ſhould I think be
better were I left alone for a few moments:
I will go, therefore, to my own room—my
own room? alas! I have none in this houſe!
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0206900201:274"/>
Let me go, however, Jeſſy, to that which
I uſed to call mine. I would recall my
diſſipated and diſtracted ſpirits, I would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
ſome degree of reaſon and reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and ſince wretchedneſs is now irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably
mine, I would teach this rebellious
heart to ſubmit to it."</p>
            <p>Jeſſy anſwered not; and Celeſtina riſing,
walked ſlowly through the hall, leaning on
her friend's arm, towards the ſtair caſe.
As ſhe paſſed, ſhe ſaw Willoughby's hat
and gloves on the table where he generally
placed them; a book he had been reading
to her, as they ſauntered in the garden the
preceding day, lay by them: Celeſtina
ſtarted as if a ſpectre had met her: the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
contraſt between her preſent ſituation
and that of a few hours before ſtruck her
forcibly: ſhe ſhuddered, and ſnatching up
the book, haſtened away with it, as if ſhe
apprehended ſomebody would take it from
her.</p>
            <p>When they reached the door of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which ſhe had choſen for her dreſſing
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0206900201:275"/>
room, ſhe turned to Jeſſy, and with a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
and forced compoſure bade her
adieu for an hour. "You will go, my
dear," ſaid ſhe, "to Mr. Thorold and
Mr. Cathcart, and ſay to the former, with
my compliments, that I will endeavour to
ſee him if he will be kind enough to ſtay
till ten o'clock and breakfaſt here, and tell
him too that I depend much on his friendly
advice, and that it cannot be given to any
being who wants it more or will be more
ſenſible of it's value."</p>
