            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF Doctor <hi>Oliver Goldſmith.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O write the life of Dr. Goldſmith, is far from being a laborious taſk, ſince little more is required than to give a tranſcript of the faireſt pages of the human mind: to have known Shenſtone, Cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and Goldſmith, is to have been happy in an acquaintance with the brighteſt ſide of the <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape of Humanity</hi>; but to have ſeen one of theſe amiable pictures, is to have ſeen them all, abating for that ſlight difference in the colouring which became neceſſary from the different points of view, in which the pictures were to be placed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0109601000:3"/>The virtues of Dr. Goldſmith's mind, will long be conſpicuous in his <hi>written page</hi>; and the reader will be warmed with the glowing graces, which, at once, animate and develope the ſoul of the author.</p>
            <p>I know not if the obſervation was ever made, but I believe it will be found true, that when great abilities are united with very great virtues, if the poſſeſſor ſhould be a writer at all, he will be a poet, and, if a poet, a very excellent one: in that caſe (as Cunningham ſings)
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>We ſhall mark in his elegant lines,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>The graces that glow in his mind.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I fancy if we were to try all the living writers by this ſtandard, we ſhould be able to form a more juſt opinion of their real characters as men, than by any other criterion. It is true, at leaſt with regard to the literary men within the circle of my knowledge, that in proportion to the virtues of their minds, is the elegance of their writings; and that there is not a fool, or a worſe character among them, that may not be diſtinguiſhed by the turgidity of his ſtyle, and the <hi>conſequential nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of his phraſe.</p>
            <p>Who could heſitate a moment to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the manly dignity of ſtyle of the poet, whoſe loſs we now lament, and the frippery bombaſt of a Murphy or a Kelly?—But the difference lay
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0109601000:4"/>
chiefly <hi>in the mind</hi>; and the one was exactly as much a better writer than the others, as a better man.</p>
            <p>It is an obſervation that Dr. Goldſmith has made in his Vicar of Wakefield, that <hi>Where the mind is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious, the affections are good.</hi> I believe that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark is founded in the laws of nature.—God is infinite in wiſdom and goodneſs.—What is genius but an emanation of the divine beam? Know you a man diſtinguiſhed from all the reſt of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance for the frigid narrowneſs and ſelfiſhneſs of his ſoul?—depend on it he is remarkably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in point of intellect: he may have much cunning; but he has no wiſdom. On the contrary, know you a man of a warmer heart?—reſt aſſured that he has a clearer head, than thoſe who are ſtrangers to that ſublime feeling which does honour to humanity.</p>
            <p>If there be an <hi>apparent</hi> exception to this rule, (and ſuch may be found) it muſt be attributed to that commerce with mankind, which will, in ſome degree, contaminate the pureſt ſentiments; but even under all appearances of variation, the latent principles of the mind need only to be drawn forth, to appear the ſame.</p>
            <p>Roſcommon, in Ireland, claims the honour of Dr. Goldſmith's birth. His father, who was a gentleman of a ſmall eſtate, had nine ſons, of whom Oliver was the third. He was born in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0109601000:5"/>
year 1731, received a good claſſical education, and was intended for holy orders. With this view he was ſent with his brother Henry to Trinity College, Dublin, in the year 1739, where he obtained a Bachelor's Degree: but his brother's merit, on leaving the College, not being rewarded with any preferment in the church, our author was adviſed to the ſtudy of phyſic, which he commenced, by attending ſeveral courſes of anatomy in Dublin.</p>
            <p>In the year 1751, he left Dublin and went to Edinburgh, where he proſecuted the ſtudy of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, under ſeveral celebrated profeſſors of that univerſity; but he had not reſided long in Scotland, before he began to feel the ill effects of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded benevolence; and he was at length abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely obliged to leave the country, to avoid a priſon; for he had bound himſelf to pay a larger ſum for a friend, than the narrowneſs of his finances would enable him to diſcharge.</p>
            <p>It was in the beginning of the year 1754, that he quitted Edinburgh; but he had no ſooner reached Sunderland, than he was arreſted for the amount of his bond; but he was happily relieved from his diſtreſs, by the humanity of Dr. Sleigh and Mr. Laughlin Maclane.</p>
            <p>The debt being diſcharged, our ingenious philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropiſt embarked on board a Dutch veſſel, bound for Rotterdam, in which place he continued but a ſhort time, and then went to Bruſſels. He now
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0109601000:6"/>
made the tour of a conſiderable part of Flanders, took the degree of Bachelor of Phyſic at Louvain, and thence went through Switſzerland to Geneva, in company with an Engliſh gentleman, whom he had made an acquaintance with in the courſe of his travels in Flanders.</p>
            <p>When our poet ſailed from England, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſtitute of money, ſo that he was under the neceſſity of travelling on foot, or declining a journey in which he promiſed himſelf much ſatisfaction, from a review of the cuſtoms and manners of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent countries. Mr. Goldſmith was at this period in good health, poſſeſſing a ſtrength of conſtitution, and a vigour of mind, which bid defiance to danger and fatigue. He was a tolerable proficient in the French language, and played on the German flute with a degree of taſte ſomething above mediocrity. Thus qualified, he travelled on, anxious to gratify his curioſity, and doubtful of the means of ſubſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; his claſſical knowledge, however, afforded him occaſional entertainment in the religious houſes; while his muſical talents continued to feed and lodge him among the merry poor of Flanders, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Doctor, in relating the hiſtory of this part of his travels, would ſay, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"When I approached a peaſant's houſe in the evening, I played one of my moſt merry tunes; which procured me not only a lodging, but ſubſiſtence for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0109601000:7"/>
day: but I muſt own, that when I attempted to entertain perſons of a higher rank, they always thought my performance contempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible, nor ever made me any return for my endeavours to pleaſe them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Our author evidently refers to theſe circumſtances of his life, in the following lines in his Traveller:

                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Goldſmith had not been long at Geneva, when a young fellow arrived there, to whom he was recommended as a Tutor, in his travels through the reſt of Europe. This youth having had a large fortune left him by his uncle, (a pawnbroker in London) reſolved to improve himſelf by travel;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0109601000:8"/>
but, as avarice was his ruling paſſion, he ſaw little more of the the curioſities of the continent, than are to be ſeen without expence. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually remarking how extravagant were the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of travelling, and perpetually contriving methods of retrenching them: ſo that it is not to be wondered if our author and his pupil parted, which they did at Marſeilles, where the latter em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked for England, happy to ſave money rather than to gain knowledge.</p>
            <p>There was, at this time, but a ſmall balance due to Goldſmith, who was once more left to ſtruggle with adverſity. He now wandered alone through the greater part of France, till, having gratified his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, and ſufficiently experienced thoſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies attennding the almoſt pennyleſs traveller, he ſailed for England, and arriving at Dover to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end of the year 1758, he haſtened immediately to London, where he found himſelf a perfect ſtranger, with ſcarce a ſhilling in the world.</p>
            <p>Thus ſituated, he began to be extremely uneaſy. His friend, Dr. Sleigh, now reſided in London; Goldſmith enquired him out, and was received with every mark of friendſhip and eſteem. An offer was now made him of the place of Uſher at Dr. Milner's Academy at Peckham; and this he eagerly acceped, unwilling to ſubſiſt on the bounty of Dr. Sleigh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0109601000:9"/>About this period, he wrote ſome criticiſms for the Monthly Review; which meeting with high approbation, Mr. Griffiths (the proprietor) engaged him to ſuperintend that publication; he therefore repaired to London, and commenced Author in form. This was in the year 1759, when he wrote a few pieces, and but a few, for the Bookſellers: and though his pay was, as it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, greater than that of many other writers, it was nevertheleſs very diſproportionate to the merit of ſuch a <hi>writer,</hi> and ſtill farther below the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſuch a <hi>man</hi> as Dr. Goldſmith: yet were not the bookſellers, his employers, worthy of cenſure, as his name was not known to the public, and his eſſays and poems were inſerted among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous croud, in magazines, and other periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal publications.</p>
            <p>It was at this period that the Doctor became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the late Mr. Newberry, who being a proprietor of the Public Ledger, our poet was engaged as a writer in that paper, then newly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, in which he publiſhed a ſeries of valuable letters, which have been ſince printed in volumes, under the title of the <q rend="inline">"Citizen of the world."</q>

            <p>Hitherto the Doctor had lodged, much in the ſtile of a poor author, in Green-arbor Court in the Old Bailey; but he now got better apartments in Wine-Office Court, Fleet-ſtreet, and a ſummer lodging at Canonbury Houſe, Iſlington, where he continued
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0109601000:10"/>
a conſiderable time, and then removed, firſt to the King's Bench Walks, and afterwards to Brick Court, in the Temple, where he died.</p>
            <p>With the publication of the <hi>Traveller,</hi> our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's literary fame began to encreaſe very faſt, and it was eſtabliſhed by the appearance of the <hi>Vicar of Wakefield</hi>; for he was now equally and juſtly eſteemed both as a poet and novelliſt; he had been before known for a good critic; and he has ſince ſhone as a learned hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>The publication of the Vicar of Wakefield was ſucceeded by that of the Comedy of the <hi>Good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured Man,</hi> which was performed nine nights at Covent Garden Theatre; but did not meet with an applauſe equal to its merit; though it was far from being ill-received.</p>
            <p>The next piece of any conſequence that our author preſented the world with, was his <hi>Deſerted Village,</hi> a poem abounding in nature, truth, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and benevolence. A circumſtance reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſale of the copy of this piece, marks very ſtrongly the author's ſimplicity of mind, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded goodneſs of heart. The manuſcript having been delivered to the bookſeller, he gave the Doctor his note of hand for one hundred gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, for the copy-right. The Doctor mentioned this circumſtance the ſame day to a gentleman, who ſaid he thought it a large ſum for ſo ſmall a piece. <q rend="inline">"In truth, ſaid the poet, I think ſo too, nor
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0109601000:11"/>
have I been eaſy ſince I received it; I will therefore go and return him his note."</q>—This he actually did, leaving the payment to the bookſeller's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, when the ſale ſhould inform him what he might afford to give.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſs of the Doctor's laſt comedy, <hi>She ſtoops to Conquer,</hi> is too generally known to need being mentioned. It is in fact, the moſt laughable piece which has been brought on the ſtage for many years.—Mr. Colman was, or pretended to be of opinion, that this piece would be damned. A proof that managers are not always the beſt judges of the taſte of the town; and one would think that they are not therefore the moſt proper caterers, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may have aſſumed a right of cramming the public with any traſh they think proper.</p>
            <p>The fate of a writer for the ſtage is not much to be envied. After many months labour to complete a piece to his own approbation, he is to ſummon patience to a bide all the manager's affected correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſtill more mortifying delays; and after all, perhaps, a diſguſted acquaintance ſhall make a party, raiſe a riot, and damn the play!</p>
            <p>Our ingenious writer had laid a plan for writing an <q rend="inline">"Univerſal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences."</q> In which he had a promiſe of the occaſional aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Dr. Johnſon, Sir Joſhua Reynolds, Mr. Beauclerc, and David Garrick, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>—Of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0109601000:12"/>
of this great work, the Doctor had formed high expectations; but he did not live to make any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in it.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that our author cleared 1800 l. in one year by his writings; notwithſtanding which, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the unbounded benevolence of his diſpoſition, and partly from an unhappy turn for gaming, which he contracted in his latter years, he was often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed for caſh in a very great degree.</p>
            <p>Dr. Goldſmith's great and ſhining talents procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him many friends and admirers among perſons in the firſt walk of life; among others the Duke of Northumberland is mentioned, as having wiſhed to be known to our poet, who himſelf told the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtory of his viſit to the Peer.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I was invited, ſaid the Doctor, by my friend Mr. Percy, to wait upon the Duke, in conſequence of the ſatisfaction he had received from the peruſal of one of my productions. I dreſſed myſelf in the beſt manner I could, and after ſtudying ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments I thought neceſſary on ſuch an occaſion, proceeded to Northumberland-houſe, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſervants that I had particular buſineſs with his Grace. They ſhewed me into an anti-chamber, where, after waiting ſome time, a gentleman very elegantly dreſſed made his appearance. Taking him for the Duke, I delivered all the fine things I had compoſed, in order to compliment him on the honour he had done me; when, to my great aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0109601000:13"/>
he told me I had miſtaken him for his maſter, who would ſee me immediately. At that inſtant the Duke came into the apartment; and I was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed on the occaſion, that I wanted words barely ſufficient to expreſs the ſenſe I entertained of the Duke's politeneſs, and went away exceedingly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grined at the blunder I had committed."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Goldſmith, happy as he thought himſelf in the ſtrength of a vigorous conſtitution, paid at all times too little regard to the preſervation of that health ſo dear to his friends, ſo important to the public.</p>
            <p>I remember, ſome years ſince, on the Doctor's partial recovery from a fit of illneſs, he came into the Chapter Coffee-Houſe; when a gentleman ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved how pale he looked, and expreſſed his fears for his ſafety:—<q rend="inline">"Pale! (cried the poet, in a pettiſh humour) that may be, Sir; but the <hi>Stamina's</hi> good—the <hi>Stamina's</hi> good."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Goldſmith's natural diſpoſition led him to covet a life of learned leiſure; but this was too often interrupted by that want of money to which the benevolence of his diſpoſition frequently reduced him. When his circumſtances were embarraſſed, his temper was ſo ruffled, that he often expreſſed himſelf in the moſt vehement manner. Theſe guſts of paſſion, as they were very violent, were very ſhort: the philoſopher recollected, and reſumed himſelf on a moment's reflection; but his ſervants
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0109601000:14"/>
profited by their maſter's violence; for they would put themſelves in his way, when he was in a paſſion, ſure to reap the reward of undeſerved chaſtiſement.</p>
            <p>It is very remarkable of this gentleman, that, contrary to the opinion of almoſt all the world, he thought Ben Johnſon, Beaumont, and their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, but ſecond-rate poets; indeed he conſidered Shakeſpear himſelf as inferior to Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh and Farquhar.</p>
            <p>The Doctor was, from principle, an enemy to that claſs of patriotic writers, (as they are called) who diſtinguiſh themſelves, by abuſing the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under which they live: in fact, he conſidered them as enemies to all good government. He was a friend to monarchy, and held ſacred the perſon of the ſovereign. But if he was an enemy to thoſe who abuſed our government and governors, indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately, he was much more ſo to thoſe paltry, thoſe deteſtable writers, who, ſacrificing every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration at the ſhrine of Plutus, wrote on both ſides of a conteſted queſtion, and <hi>on both at the ſame time,</hi> for HIRE. It is ſaid that Dr. Goldſmith did not ſpeak to Mr. Kelly for ſeven years pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding his death.</p>
            <p>He firmly believed the doctrine of a future ſtate, in which the miſeries of the virtuous in this life, would be amply rewarded by a permanency of happineſs, incapable of decay: above flattering the vices or follies of the rich or great, he was ill qualified to puſh his fortune among thoſe whom
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0109601000:15"/>
his genius taught to court his company: yet was he happy in a connection with many of the greateſt and beſt characters of this kingdom.</p>
            <p>Dr. Goldſmith being ſeized with a violent indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, on the 25th of March, 1774, ſent for Mr. Hawes, an apothecary, in the Strand, the night ſucceeding that day, and declared his intention of taking Dr. James's fever powders; to his perſiſting in which reſolution, many of his warmeſt friends have aſcribed the loſs of this great and good man! How far they are right in their conjectures it would be needleſs, if it were not impoſſible to ſay. Mr. Hawes has publiſhed an account of the Doctor's illneſs, ſo far as relates to the exhibition of theſe powders. The public may be intereſted in the enquiry into the probable effects of ſo powerful a medicine. The writer of theſe pages has only to ſay, that Mr. Hawes is a man whoſe ſkill or vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city will not be doubted for a moment by any one who has the honour of knowing him.</p>
            <p>This delightful poet, this ſweet moraliſt, this excellent man! departed this life on the 4th of April, 1774, and was interred in the Burying-Ground of the Temple. It was propoſed to have buried him in Weſtminſter-Abey, where, however, a monument is to be erected to his memory:—but the beſt and moſt laſting monument will be found in his works.</p>
            <p>Dr. Goldſmith was in ſtature rather under the middle ſize, and built more like the porter than
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0109601000:16"/>
the gentleman: his complexion was pale, his forehead low, his face almoſt round, and pitted with the ſmall pox; but marked with the ſtrong lines of thinking: upon the whole there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his appearance that would not rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs the mind againſt him; but to thoſe who knew him, there appeared a melting ſoftneſs in his eye, that was the genuine effect of his humanity. Never did that eye behold an object of diſtreſs, but it conveyed an intelligence to the heart, that ſtretched out the hand irreſiſtibly to relieve; and it is well known that his unbounded philanthropy contributed to keep him poor; but he ever felt a ſatisfaction in the conſcious dignity and liberality of his mind, that the poſſeſſion of wealth without the will to diſtribute it could never have afforded!</p>
            <p>Preſuming that the beſt uſe to which biography can be applied is to profit by the amiable part of the author's character: I ſhall extract, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment and inſtruction of my readers, ſuch paſſages of Dr. Goldſmith's works, as mark in a ſtriking manner, the unbounded benevolence of his temper, or the elegant ſimplicity of his mind.
