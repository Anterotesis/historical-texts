            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Art of Healing would ſeem to be of all Arts the moſt honourable, even tho' no better Reaſon could be given for it, than that it is the moſt difficult. The laſt is indeed ſo true, that the Task appears unſurmountable to many, and even to ſome of thoſe whom propitious Heaven has bleſs'd with the brighteſt and moſt intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Faculties. The provident and
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1073000500:4"/>all-wiſe Governor of the Univerſe, has therefore imprinted on ſome Minds a great and inſuperable Attachment to this Science, not to be overcome with Difficulties, or rather which knows no Difficulties; to whom the Study is as eaſie as it is natural, and is ſo far from being a Task, that it becomes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Part of their Happineſs; who can penetrate with Freedom and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light all the latent Powers of created Bodies, and can diſcover by a Sagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſomewhat more than human, their Dependence and Effects on each other.</p>
            <p>To this wonderful Bias, this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Prejudice in Favour of <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> we owe the Characters of a <hi>Pitcairne, Liſter, Friend, Sloane, Sydenham,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>I am no Stranger to Addreſſes of this Kind, or to the general Abuſe of them, than which nothing is more oppoſite to my Temper and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but a generous Mind, however upright, ſincere and impartial, cannot avoid acknowledging, on theſe publick Occaſions, the Merit which it admires and extolls in private Converſation; ſuch a Mind I ſay, cannot forbear to confeſs in Dr. <hi>Mead,</hi> deep Learning, profound Knowledge of Medicine, Candour, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, and Condeſcenſion.</p>
            <p>Some of theſe Qualities have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd thee from being mov'd with Applauſe or Adulation, and have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Envy itſelf from attacking thee:
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1073000500:6"/>They have both gain'd and preſerv'd the Eſteem as well of the Multitude, as of the learned World, thro' a very long Series of ſucceſsful Practice.</p>
            <p>Several of theſe Conſiderations have induced me to preſent thee with the following Sheets, which contain naked Truths, undiſguis'd with ſubtil and hypothetical Conjectures, but eſtabliſh'd on plain and certain Principles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the unparallel'd Syſtem of <hi>Boerhaave.</hi>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will be unneceſſary to tell the Learned of the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that nothing has yet been wrote upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which might be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the Information of thoſe who are unacquainted with it. The Syſtematic Writers have either forgot it entirely, as <hi>Boer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haave</hi> has done, or have paſs'd it over ſuperficially, and as often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely. To the young Artiſt, therefore, I preſume this Piece will be acceptable; in which, tho' all has not been ſaid which might be ſaid, yet perhaps ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to aſſiſt him to form a more clear and perfect Idea of this Diſeaſe and its Method of Cure, than has hitherto been
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:1073000500:8"/>offer'd to the Publick. The Method of Cure he will find more ample than the other Parts of this Diſcourſe, which are as conciſe as they could well be; but this will be readily excus'd, when he knows how much more difficult it is to cure this Malady, than to underſtand it.</p>
            <p>I ſhould do Injuſtice to the Subject, if I forgot to take Notice, in this Place, of that very ſhort and ſubtile Method, by which the groſs Superſtition of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors taught them to believe this very obſtinate Diſeaſe might be cur'd, <hi>viz.</hi> By the wonder-working Touch of a ſcepter'd Hand, or of a Piece of Money from the ſame Hand; but we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, by the bye, that it muſt be the Hand of a lineal Heir to the Crown; for thoſe intitled to it, by the Invitation of the Subject, or the Voice of the People, (tho' this was the beſt Title in the World) were not thought capable of performing this Feat, till this Royalty had been propagated to the ſecond or third Generation. And this was ſo much attended to, that they ſcrupled not to make a Miracle the Teſt of his Prerogative or genuine Deſcent; as
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:1073000500:9"/>may be gathered from the Records of Antiquity. Tho' the Light of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter govern'd Eaucation has ſhewn the Weakneſs and blind Credulity of our Forefathers, and made us Infidels to theſe and the like Traditions; yet we ſhall find that many of them ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in Eſteem, and even with thoſe who want neither the Advantages of Learning, or of natural Sagacity; and with the Multitude moſt of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unſhaken. Of theſe Traditions the Royal Touch for the Evil is none of the leaſt ſacred: The Origin of this Whim ſeems to be at leaſt as old as the dark Night of Popery in this Iſland; having probably been contrived to anſwer the Deſigns of the crafty Prieſts upon a ſuperſtitious People, ſince by ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle as this they might claim a Right to the Throne for that Prince who would beſt anſwer their Purpoſes; and ſuch Miracles they would not fail of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Wholeſale, tho' upon no better Foundation than their own dark Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This Conjecture will appear more probable to thoſe who know, that from ſuch vile Arts as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the forging of Miracles, the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:1073000500:10"/>receives no inconſiderable Support, even at this Day in Foreign Countries, tho' the Learned amongſt them are not ſo blind as not to ſee it; but a Hand of Cruelty commands at leaſt their Silence, and forbids them to ſay that they have Eyes to ſee.</p>
            <p>From this Piece of Superſtition then the Diſeaſe has borrow'd its <hi>Engliſh</hi> Name, at leaſt a Part of it; but how it came to be call'd by Way of Eminence the Evil, is to be the Subject of another Enquiry. It ſeems in Reality to have been owing to its great Obſtinacy, which made it eſteem'd deſperate if not incurable: We need not wonder, if we ſuppoſe that they knew nothing of the true Genius of this, or any other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes a very few Centuries ago; when the State of Phyſick in <hi>England,</hi> was as deſpicable as we can poſſibly conceive it to have been: Witneſs the Hiſtories of <hi>Gilbert, John Gaddeſden,</hi> &amp;c. the Archiaters of thoſe Days, when the Lives of Princes were truſted in the Hanas of ignorant Mountebanks: But tho' th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y were not perhaps leſs ignorant than their Modern Brethren, they were
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:1073000500:11"/>however, content not with doing much Miſchief or ſpreading Deſtruction around them as ſome of theſe have done; but with acting the Impoſtor well, and catching their Game, in which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd at leaſt as much Craft as our modern Quacks, and much more ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Roguery. By this we ſee that Phyſick is but new to our Clime, tho' in Juſtice to our Countrymen, it muſt be confeſs'd it ſuits the Soil ſo well, that 'tis likely to make as great a Figure in this Iſland, as in the ancient Empire of Arts and Sciences.</p>
            <p>But they had another Reaſon for eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeming this Diſeaſe worthy the Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Plague or Evil, <hi>viz.</hi> it's being remarkably hereditary. This is indeed one of the worſt Circuſtances that can attend any Diſeaſe, which inſtead of being a private Misfortune, proves a Calamity to Families, and becomes an unhappy Mark of Diſtinction, as it appears always externally, and offers itſelf to the Obſervation of every Spectator. This indeed will appear a hard and unequal Law to thoſe who have not conſider'd that the Conſtitutions of Parents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:1073000500:12"/>belong to their Children, as much as the Species itſelf; nor can it be otherwiſe without reverſing and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-acting thoſe uniform and perfect Laws which all Matter, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiz'd Bodies compos'd of it are oblig'd to obey. Theſe Laws we may ſuppoſe as ancient as the firſt Formation of Matter, and the mighty <hi>Fiat</hi> which unfolded the great Scene of Nature: They ſeem, I ſay, to be as old as the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation itſelf, nor can they be contradicted, varied or ſuſpended, without violating that Order and moſt exact Harmony, which we obſerve in all Nature's Works, and which were inſeparable from the Perfection of her Author.</p>
            <p>But does it not hence follow, that all Diſeaſes are, or muſt be hereditary? No: And why? This is no eaſy Queſtion, except it be ſufficient to ſay, that thoſe Diſeaſes only are hereditary, which can be communicated to the original Stamina of an animal Body. If this Anſwer be not ſatisfactory, we muſt be content to acknowledge our Ignorance, by appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others, "<hi>Dicat qui novit.</hi> This then was eſteem'd both an incurable and
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:1073000500:13"/>hereditary Diſeaſe, and thiſ probably the Reaſon why it was choſen as the moſt proper <hi>Subject</hi> for a Miracle, as the Cure of the <hi>greateſt Evil</hi> was fitteſt to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the <hi>beſt King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have only now to acquaint my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that the following Doctrines are ſupported by the Diſſection of Bodies, and other Matters of Fact. For as thoſe Things which affect our Senſes, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eſteem'd the ſureſt and most infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Teſt of every Doctrine; ſo a more than common Regard to thoſe iſ neceſſary in our Attempts for the Advancement of <hi>Medicine;</hi> which as it is only converſible with ſenſible Bodies, ought not to admit any Thing for Truth which has not the Teſtimony of the Senſeſ. On this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wearied with the Jargon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, which the Flights of fertil but deceitful Imagination had introauc'd into the nobleſt of all Sciences, Many of the wiſeſt and moſt judiciouſ of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns are reſolved to allow no Reaſoning for Orthodox, which is not ſupported on the Baſis of Demonſtration. By this Means an Art, which has been accuſed of Doubt and Uncertainty, is already
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:1073000500:14"/>arrived at ſuch Perfection, as may enable her devoted Sons to follow her Steps with perfect uninterupted Satisfaction, and the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience. A great and admirable Progreſs has been made in this Reformation, by the late incomparable <hi>Boerhaave,</hi> which will be a Subject of Praiſe and Admiration in Ages to come, and an Honour to the Age and Country in which he liv'd.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OTHING is more neceſſary to the perfect underſtanding any Diſeaſe, than a juſt and exact Definition; ſuch an one as may determine the Bounds betwixt the real Subject and every Thing that may be diſguiſed under a ſimilar Appearance. This, which we ſhall call a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Definition, was never more requiſite in any Diſeaſe, than that which is to be the Subject of this Eſſay; which, as it is obſerv'd to be remarkably hereditary, is reputed (tho unjuſtly) the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious of Diſeaſes, if we except the <hi>Lues;</hi> and for this Reaſon we ought to be well inform'd of the Requiſites for diſtinguiſhing this <hi>Hydra</hi> from the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1073000500:16"/>many Maladies which bear any the leaſt Reſemblance to it.</p>
            <p>For this Purpoſe then, we ſhall call by the Name of <hi>Scrophula,</hi> or King's Evil, a Swelling which has the following Characters: <q>'It is of the ſame Colour with the Skin, without Pain, and almoſt equal in Hardneſs to a <hi>Schirrus</hi>;'</q> but theſe will not be ſo well underſtood, without adding to them ſuch a deprav'd State of the Fluids as diſpoſes them to be <hi>pituitous.</hi> By De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ravity here, I mean no more than that original Diſpoſition of both Solids and Fluids, which the Ancients call'd ſignificantly enough <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Temperamentum,</hi> of which they had no leſs than eight different Claſſes. Of theſe, few were more remarkable than the <hi>Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum pituitoſum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Pituit,</hi> the Ancients underſtood too great a Solution of the Blood, in which its Particles have loſt that Figure, Firmneſs and Solidity, from which it derives its red Colour, but at the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me time co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here together too tenaciouſly; and thus we eaſily diſtinguiſh betwixt this and the <hi>Humid Craſis,</hi> in which the Tenacity is not included.</p>
            <p>'Tis eaſy to ſee, that this Diſpoſition of the Blood will render it unfit for many of its Functions, and alone is ſufficient for the Production of the worſt Diſeaſes. And if it be aſk'd, where theſe are moſt likely to be produc'd, or what Organs are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1073000500:17"/>moſt likely to ſuffer? The Anſwer will be eaſy, thoſe Organs in which the Circulation is the moſt difficult: And, pray, which are theſe? Every Body knows, the Glands. Their Structure ſeems ſo much to retard the Motion of the Fluids thro' their Veſſels, and the propelling Force of the Heart and Arteries is ſo much diminiſh'd, that 'tis the greateſt wonder the Circulation is not more frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted.</p>
            <p>Theſe, therefore, are the Parts of the Body moſt liable to be obſtructed, and this is our Caſe at preſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o be affected; thoſe of the Meſentery are alſo obſtructed too, and perhaps the readieſt of any, and indeed 'tis no wonder to thoſe who conſider the Structure, Situation, and the <hi>Vis Propellens</hi> of theſe Glands. This laſt Obſtruction is indeed the productive Cauſe of the worſt Symptom of this Diſeaſe, as will appear afterwards when we come to treat of the Symptoms.</p>
            <p>But tho' this Malady principally affects the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dular Syſtem, and chiefly thoſe Glands which we have mentioned, ſeveral other Parts are ſometimes Sharers in the Calamity. This is in its laſt Stage, and does not happen till it has made a conſiderable Progreſs; and then, indeed, the Tendons, the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, and the Bones themſelves are likewiſe affected.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1073000500:18"/>
            <p>We ought, next in order, to deliver the Symptoms of this Diſeaſe; but as theſe cannot be underſtood without a previous Knowledge of its genuine Cauſe, we ſhall for the Sake of Perſpicuity be oblig'd to poſtpone our Account of the ſeveral <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> till we have diſcovered the Sourſe from whence they are derived; and it had been well that this Method had been followed by many of thoſe who have taken ſome Trouble to oblige the World with Eſſays on Diſeaſes, which, tho' otherwiſe meritorious enough, have, for want of Order, fail'd in their Deſign, and left the Subject involv'd in its former Obſcurity. 'Tis too well known to be diſſembled, that this has been the Caſe with too many of our own Countrymen<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>The proximate<note n="†" place="margin">See Pag. 2, and 3.</note> Cauſe of this Diſeaſe appears to be nothing more, than a viſcid pituitous State of the Fluids and too great Laxity of the Solids. By theſe we muſt endeavour to explain all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> we have to explain; and where theſe prove inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, we muſt patiently ſubmit to the Imputation of Ignorance. This however is only to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1073000500:19"/>of the recent or ſimple <hi>Struma,</hi> without thoſe deſperate Symptoms to be obſerved in its laſt Stage, and which are to be referred to their proper Place.</p>
            <p>The remote Cauſes of this Diſeaſe are, whatever Accidents are capable of producing the aforeſaid Diſpoſition, ſuch as, firſt, an hereditary <hi>Labes,</hi> which is perhaps the moſt frequent Cauſe. Every Body knows this Diſeaſe to be hereditary, but few know how it comes to be ſo; we may ſolve this Problem as eaſily as any other of the ſame Kind by ſaying, That an inviolable Law is impoſed upon every <hi>Genus</hi> of created Bodies, whether animated or not, which propagate their Species, by which its <hi>Foetus</hi> or <hi>Embryo</hi> not only agrees in every individual Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with its Parent, but likewiſe partakes of its Perfections or Imperfections. Thus the ſolid Fibre produces another of the ſame Sort, and a lax Fibre a lax one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus far we may proceed ſafely, and perhaps no farther; for in attempting a more minute Solution, we ſhall, I believe, find our ſelves at our utmoſt Limits, and on the Border of Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: There ſeem to be ſome Bounds placed to all Phyſical Enquiries, beyond which we cannot go, except in Imagination, and ſometimes even that will fail us. I don't mean by this to undervalue the deep Philoſopher or his profound Enquiries into the <hi>Abſcondita Naturae:</hi> No, the deep Man beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Title of Philoſopher, and will always receive the moſt Delight, as well as Honour, for

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Labour: But let us endeavour to be contented with the Knowledge within our Reach, and to place the Bounds betwixt deep and unfathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, profound and unintelligible. By this means we ſhall ſave ourſelves ſome Trouble, and avoid not a few Miſtakes.—Thus much on hereditary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
            <p>The next of the remote Cauſes muſt be underſtood from the Conſideration of that Time of Life in which it firſt diſcovers itſelf: This is in Childhood, when both Solids and Fluids always tend too much to that <hi>Cachexia</hi> which we have aſſign'd as the proximate Cauſe of the <hi>Scrophula.</hi> The <hi>Faetus</hi> immediately after Conception is a meer Jelly, and ſcarce any Diſtinction can be made betwixt its ſolid and fluid Parts. In a few Months the firſt have acquir'd a ſtronger Power of Cohaeſion, and the latter are more attenuated: At the Time of Birth this Change is yet more conſiderable, but the Veſſels are yet very lax, and their contain'd Liquors are viſcid and diſpos'd to be pituitous; nor are they brought to a proper <hi>Craſis</hi> in leſs than about twenty Years. Nobody who conſiders this will wonder why Children are ſo ſubject to this Diſeaſe, but the Diſpoſition is often aggravated by their W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of living, and from the immoderate Uſe of ſweet Fruits, farinaceous or other glutinous Subſtances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1073000500:21"/>
            <p>We are now at L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>berty to obſerve the ſeveral Phaenomena, and will firſt begin with the Tumours themſelves which were already deſcrib'd in attempting to define the Diſeaſe. And <hi>firſt,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are diſpers'd, or, which is the ſame Thing, affect many different Glands at the ſame Time, and this needs no Explanation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are very ſmooth, and this will be beſt underſtood by conſidering the Structure of the Organs affected; as their Figure is globular they will be equally diſtended on every Side by the obſtructing Matter in their Cavities, and thus their Surface will be even and ſmooth, tho' not commonly ſhining. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Theſe Tumours are alſo ſomewhat hard, tho' not ſo hard as the <hi>Schirrhus;</hi> the viſcid Matter being lodg'd in the <hi>Follicle</hi> and confin'd there, the finer Parts are carried off by the <hi>Abſorbent</hi> Veſſels, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matter, becomes more viſcid, then glutinous, and at length firm: This is no more than happens, in a leſſer Degree, in all the Cavities of the Body where their contain'd Liquors are permitted to remain for ſome Time; as the <hi>Veſiculae Seminales,</hi> Gall, Bladder, <hi>&amp;c. Fourthly,</hi> They are, even when ulcerated, without Pain; and this, perhaps, is not leſs remarkable than any of the other Peculiars to this Diſeaſe. It will not be wonder'd that the <hi>Conglobate</hi> Glands have not this uneaſy Senſation before their being ulcerated; as the ſame is obſerv'd in more Diſeaſes than this, and may be explain'd afterwards; but the moſt ſenſible Parts, as well as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1073000500:22"/>the more firm, ſuch as <hi>Tendons, Ligaments, &amp;c.</hi> are deſtroy'd by this <hi>Labes,</hi> without any Senſe of Pain. This indeed is not eaſily underſtood, except it be ſufficient to ſay, that the Deſtruction of theſe nerve us Parts is not owing to any acrid Matter which corrodes them; but to the Laxity of the Veſſels in which the <hi>Tenſion,</hi> or attractive Force, is ſo ſmall, as to allow their component Fibres to be divided without that Reſiſtance which is the immediate Cauſe of Pain.</p>
            <p>The next Symptom is an Inflation of the Face and Neck. This is indeed a conſtant Attendant of the <hi>Struma,</hi> and perhaps one of the beſt diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Signs we are acquainted with. I remember to have heard a learned Phyſician, a Perſon of great Ingenuity, ſay, that by means of his long Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Practice, he could diſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>guiſh a Patient affected with this Diſeaſe, by only looking him in the Face. This Inflation is greateſt in the inferior Part of the Cheeks; and is beſt underſtood, by conſidering that in this Habit of Body the Veſſels are ſuppoſed too lax, which alone will be ſufficient for underſtanding the Cauſe of an Inflation; but why this is confin'd to the Face and Neck, or at leaſt is more remarkable in theſe than any other Parts is not ſo eaſily underſtood. Perhaps the Expoſure of theſe Parts to the Action of Cold, by which the proximate Cauſe of the Diſeaſe is aggravated in their Veſſels: The Number of Glands about theſe Parts, in which the Motion of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1073000500:23"/>the Blood is retarded or obſtructed; and <hi>laſtly,</hi> an hereditary Diſpoſition of the Parts themſelves, may be ſufficient for explaining this <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> We don't obſerve that the Complexion is ſo much chang'd as might be expected; there is however a certain livid or bluiſh Caſt, which is better learned by Obſervation than Deſcription: This is ſeldom wanted, and in Children helps to compleat that particular Aſpect of the Face, from which the Preſence of this Diſeaſe will rarely be miſtaken by thoſe who have made the Study familiar.</p>
            <p>Another remarkable Symptom of the <hi>Scrophula,</hi> is a great or frequent Pain in the Belly, which is eaſily underſtood from what was ſaid before of the <hi>Meſenteric</hi> Glands, if theſe are rightly ſuppos'd to be the Seat of this Pain; but indeed this Uneaſineſs in the Bowels ſeems, not leſs probably, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the viſcid pituitous Matter lodg'd in the <hi>Rugae</hi> of the Inteſtines themſelves; and this will perhaps appear more reaſonable, if we remember that the ſame Sort of Obſtruction does not produce Pain in the other Glands, or even much more ſenſible Parts; and that we find nothing more ready to produce a Cholic than this <hi>Pituit</hi> in the Inteſtines, as may be obſerv'd in the Diſeaſes of Children.</p>
            <p>The laſt Symptom we ſhall mention, and which is rarely abſent in this Diſeaſe, is a great Proſtration of the natural Functions; thoſe, to wit, of Digeſtion and Nutrition. This Change, or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1073000500:24"/>Proceſs, is twofold, and may be comprehended under the general Heads of <hi>Chylification</hi> and <hi>Sanguification;</hi> but both theſe will ſuffer greatly in ſuch a Stale of the Solids and Fluids as was before deſcrib'd as the <hi>proxima Cauſa</hi> of this Malady. The firſt Requiſite to the firſt of theſe Actions is Appetite, or Inclination for Food, which is here deſtroy'd by the great Quantity of viſcid <hi>Pituit</hi> in the Stomach and Inteſtines. Again, after they are receiv'd into the Stomach, the Action of this is ſo weak, and the Juices neceſſary for diſſolving the Food are ſo much deprav'd, that this Part of Digeſtion cannot proceed as it ought; and the ſame Defect will be found in the Inteſtines. The firſt Proceſs therefore either is not perform'd at all, or at leaſt very imperfectly, and this Deficiency cannot be repair'd afterwards, for this crude and viſcid <hi>Chyle,</hi> when receiv'd into the Circulation in Order to undergo it's ſecond Change by the Action of the Veſſels; but this is already too weak for that Purpoſe, and thus the <hi>Pituit</hi> increaſes, and at length the vital Functions ſuffer. The laſt Conſequence will be a Hectic Fever, not to be expected till near the End of the Tragedy.</p>
            <p>All theſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> are ſometimes accompanied with a Fever, Heat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Tumour then becomes painful, and at length ulcerated, and what we commonly call malign, pouring out a diſagreeable <hi>Sanies,</hi> generating remarkably fungous Fleſh, and yielding little or nothing to Remedies. The Fever
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1073000500:25"/>ſeems not to be the genuine Effect of the Diſeaſe, except we ſuppoſe ſome other Cauſe to have acceded, as ſome acrid, irritating <hi>Virus,</hi> latent in the Fluids; but as this is not preſum'd to be a Part of the Diſeaſe itſelf, we muſt be oblig'd to impute the Fever to a foreign Cauſe of this or ſome other Kind. I know a Fever to be the natural Product of this Malady in it's advanc'd State, but it is of the Hectic Kind, and generally the Forerunner of Death.</p>
            <p>This Fever appears to be generally owing to the <hi>Chyle,</hi> which however crude and unprepar'd is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into the Veſſels, and being incapable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing its proper Change there, produces a <hi>Febris Symptomatica.</hi> The Circulation being now increas'd the Fluids are propell'd with more than wonted <hi>Impetus</hi> into the Glands, their <hi>Follicles</hi> are burſt, and pour out a diſagreeable <hi>Sanies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conſequence of all theſe is eaſily underſtood. The <hi>Sanies</hi> will be abſorb'd in pretty large Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into the Maſs of Blood, which being now infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contaminates the whole Circulation, and thus all Parts of the Body may be affected.</p>
            <p>Many freſh Ulcers now appear on the external Parts; the Tendons and Ligaments themſelves are eroded and exulcerated, likewiſe the Bones chiefly at their Extremities where their Texture is leaſt firm by the <hi>Laminae</hi> being more ſeparated from e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1073000500:26"/>other; at length the internal <hi>Viſcera</hi> ſuffer in the common Calamity, as they muſt inevitably receive into their Veſſels the ſame morbific Fluids which corrode and convert them into a ſimilar <hi>Sanies.</hi> This again is abſorb'd into the common Maſs, which now becomes yet more corrupted; hence a <hi>Phthiſis Multiplex,</hi> which is certain Death.</p>
            <p>'Tis unneceſſary, as well as unſuitable to the Deſign we laid down, to trace the various Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, Effects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this <hi>Pthiſis</hi> before it termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in Death; but it may be proper to take notice that it is incurable; nor will a Proof of this be requir'd, after reflecting on what has been already deliver'd.</p>
            <p>But the Progreſs of the <hi>Scrophula</hi> does not always obſerve the Order we have explain'd; it ſometimes makes a ſhorter Period by ſwelling the Thuroid Gland, which by compreſſing the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> puts a ſudden End to the Scene. In this caſe, the neceſſary Relief cannot be eaſily given, and our principal Dependence muſt be on ſuch Medicines as can be immediately applied to the Part affected, which muſt be in the Form of Vapour; but of this more hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have traced the Progreſs of the <hi>Scrophula</hi> with its ſeveral Symptoms, without ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing any other Diſeaſe connected with it, but this too frequently happens, and then 'tis eaſy to ſee
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1073000500:27"/>how difficult will be the Cure, and how dubious the Event.</p>
            <p>The Diſeaſes we find ſometimes joined to this are ſeveral, and thoſe of the worſt Kind too, which give a <hi>Stimulus</hi> to the tardy Progreſs of the <hi>Struma,</hi> and render its Termination ſhorter, as the Scurvy and <hi>Lues;</hi> in each of which is a conſiderable Degree of Acrimony, as is plain both from their Origin and Effects. They are to be diſcover'd by their proper Signs, and an exact and minute Enquiry into the Patient's former Way of Living, and into the Errors he may have committed in the Non-naturals ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for producing this or the other Species of Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. By ſuch a rigorous Enquiry into his Hiſtory, we ſhall be able to judge more ſafely on this Head, than we can otherwiſe do by any Signs whatever.</p>
            <p>Both the abovementioned Diſtempers ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pretty clearly to the external Senſes, as they appear for the moſt part on the Surface of the Body. The Ulcers of the <hi>Lues</hi> have ſome Peculiarities, which will not allow us to miſtake them; and their Progreſs is ſo regular and uniform that we need not often be deceiv'd.</p>
            <p>The Preſence of the Scurvy is not determin'd with more Difficulty than that of the other; but to determine its Species, will require more Sagacity than may be readily beliv'd by thoſe who have not made the Experiment. To the Want of this Diſtinction
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1073000500:28"/>we may impute the ill Succeſs with which the Scurvy is ſo often treated, which need not ſurprize us if we conſider that one Species requires a Method of Cure oppoſite to that of another, and a third has no Affinity with the other, either in its Origin or Method of Cure. In a word, they proceed from Cauſes entirely repugnant; and to attempt the Cure of the Scurvy by any one Sett of Medicines, would be juſt as reaſonable as was the learned Biſhop of <hi>C</hi> — <hi>ne</hi>'s hardy Attempt to cure both the Pleuriſy and Dropſy by his ſubtil <hi>Tar-Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whoever therefore undertakes the Cure of the <hi>Scrophula,</hi> muſt examine with due Attention, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is accompanied with the abovementioned, or any other Diſeaſes, that he may be able to draw a certain and faithful Indication.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Diagnoſis</hi> of this Malady was given before, and therefore nothing more need be ſaid to it; and of the <hi>Prognoſis</hi> what we have to ſay, will now be eaſily apprehended.</p>
            <p>The hereditary <hi>Struma</hi> is by much the worſt Species, and the ſame is true of all original Diſeaſes, (for ſo we may call them) which, as they have their Eſſence intermix'd with the firſt Principles of Life, can ſcarcely be ſeparated by a leſs Power than that which united them together; and tho' the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of perhaps all Diſeaſes admit of ſome Miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, yet the Experience of Antiquity as well as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1073000500:29"/>our own, has taught us that the <hi>Labes Hereditaria,</hi> of almoſt every Kind, is incurable.</p>
            <p>The next in Malignity we ſhall eſteem that of thoſe Children whoſe Parents were of a lax and weakly Habit, effeminate in their Way of Living, eating and drinking voluptuouſly, and indulging a ſedentary unactive Life; who, for Reaſons we ſhall not attempt to give, derive to their Offspring a weak and ſickly Machine ſubject to the Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many Diſeaſes (from which their Parents might yet be free) and unable to make a proper Defence, or to receive all the Benefit of Medicinal Aid. Theſe, when attacked by the <hi>Scrophula,</hi> may indeed be relieved, and perhaps cur'd; but it will be neceſſary at the ſame time to repair and improve that Conſtitution which Nature had left imperfect, or rather which Nature's Antagoniſt had render'd ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> Luxury in the Parents.</p>
            <p>But other Children there are afflicted with this Diſeaſe, whoſe Parents were ſtrong, vigorous and healthy; and themſelves, when firſt brought into the World in every Reſpect healthy as their Parents, and likely to continue ſo; yet, theſe are, perhaps, pretty early attacked by this Diſeaſe. In theſe, therefore, it muſt be attributed to ſome Error of the Non-naturals much aggravating that univerſal <hi>Diatheſis</hi> in Children, which was firſt aſſign'd as the genuine Source of the <hi>Scrophula</hi> Theſe indeed have the faireſt Chance of a ſure and quick Relief from Medicine, as the Habit of Body was before very
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1073000500:30"/>good, and is fit for undergoing the Action of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. Theſe are indeed curable, and will rarely be diſappointed of a perfect Cure from the Method we ſhall endeavour to deliver.</p>
            <p>The firſt Thing in Order (for Order is here ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary) we have to do for the effectual Cure of this Diſtemper, will be the Correction of that Cachexy which is the fundamental Cauſe of it. The Means of doing this, are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> By corroborating the Veſſels. <hi>2dly,</hi> By diminiſhing the Quantity of the morbific Matter, both in the <hi>primae viae</hi> and whole Body. <hi>3dly,</hi> By concocting the Remainder.</p>
            <p>To the firſt Intention, a proper Regimen of the <hi>Nonnaturals</hi> muſt be adapted, and on which it will principally depend: Let the Patient's Food be light and dry, not at all glutinous, but rather ſomewhat aſtringent. Roaſted Meats, well ſeaſoned with Spices, ſuch as are generally uſed in the Kitchen, as Cinnamon, Mace, Cloves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bread exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well fermented, or ſuch as has undergone that Proceſs a ſecond Time, and made from the dryer and leſs glutinous Vegetables: To theſe may be added the dry Fruits of the <hi>Indies.</hi> His Liquors muſt alſo be well fermented; and of theſe, the beſt are, fine old Ale, and the aſtringent Wines, if they are of a due Maturity, as <hi>Rheniſh, Red-Port,</hi> &amp;c. which will be much fitter for our Purpoſe, after being well impregnated with the dry Aromatics.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1073000500:31"/>
            <p>Exerciſe is of no ſmall Conſequence in this Caſe: Of the ſeveral Diverſions which go under that Name, prefer Riding, as well in this, as moſt other Diſeaſes where Exerciſe is neceſſary, as it, perhaps, anſwers all the Intentions of Exerciſe in general, without any of the Inconveniencies which attend ſome of the other Species of it. We are, however, to be govern'd in this, as in every other Change of the <hi>Nonnaturals,</hi> by the ſtrict Rules of Prudence: Exerciſe is always to be proportion'd to the Strength of the Patient, nor ever to exceed it on any Pretence whatever; and the Limits of this Direction will be beſt determin'd by the Patient, who is always to take the firſt Senſation of Wearineſs as a Caution to deſiſt: This will be a certain and ſafe Rule, which, as it may be follow'd without any Uneaſineſs, as it is no more than avoiding Uneaſineſs, ſo he is always to eſteem it ſacred; nor can he treſpaſs upon it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out greater Miſchiefs than thoſe it was intended to remove. To check Nature, or her luxuriant Sallies, is no difficult Matter; but to reſtore her when languid, oppreſs'd, and almoſt overcome with the Combat, is an hardy Taſk,</p>
            <q>Hic Labor, hoc Opus eſt — —</q>
            <p>Let us therefore remember always to have a proper Regard to her Preſervation; let us remember we are her Servants, and profeſs ourſelves, yea, are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of the Title of, <hi>The Miniſters of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:1073000500:32"/>
            <p>The Air is of no mean Importance here; the beſt is the dry, ſerene, and ſomewhat warm: If the Climate and Seaſon are contrary, we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſupply their Defects within Doors; and for this Purpoſe a Situation remote from much Wood and Water, on a dry and barren Soil, defended from the rainy Winds, will be moſt ſuitable. The Houſe itſelf ought to be exceeding cloſe, and preſerved from Damp by large and conſtant Fires, and let its Windows confront the meridian Sun. The Patient's Chamber ought to be in the upper Part of the Houſe, well wainſcotted; and let its Air be impregnated with the Effluvia of the moſt odoriferous Spices. Let his Bed be very hard, and compoſed of the cordial Aſtringent and moſt aromatic Plants. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Sleep will be beſt; that is, within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of ſeven or eight Hours, which Number ought never to be exceeded, unleſs we are willing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Malady. Sleep is a Time of Relaxation, and that always. The Muſcles before wearied with Contraction, are now to be relieved by reſting in a contrary State. And whence is this Change? The contracting Cauſe ceaſes in all the voluntary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that all theſe being ſtill and quiet, the other Functions may be performed with leſs Interruption: The Circulation of the Fluids thro' their Veſſels is now calm and undiſturbed, becauſe the <hi>Equilibrium</hi> betwixt them is not deſtroy'd by any foreign Agent. But there is another Cauſe of Relaxation beſides that of Sleep itſelf, and which ſeems not to have been
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1073000500:33"/>hitherto ſufficiently regarded, and that is, the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour form'd around the Body by its own Atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere; which being confin'd, and as it were rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated by the Bed-Clothes, makes a true <hi>Balneum Vaporis,</hi> than which, a more powerful <hi>Menſtruum</hi> is ſcarcely known for relaxing the Fibres of an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Body: And this feems to produce all the ill Effects we obſerve from long Lying-a-bed, in thoſe who lie awake a conſiderable Part of the Time: Of this Claſs, perhaps, may be ſuppoſed no ſmall Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Ladies of Eaſe; and this is probably one grand Cauſe of all thoſe Diſeaſes which are more peculiar to the Fair, and imputed to a lax and feeble Make of the Solids. The Atmoſphere we have been ſpeaking of, and which derives its Name from its Similitude to that ſurrounding the Earth, is no more than the inviſible Matter of Perſpiration, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haling from every Point of the Body, and ſeems neceſſary for preſerving it from the Injuries of the Air.</p>
            <p>The Covering of the Body is of no ſmall Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which, as it ought to be well defended from the Cold, muſt alſo be incited to a briſk Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The Patient's Clothes therefore are to be thick and warm, and the beſt Materials for this Purpoſe is allow'd to be Wool.</p>
            <p>The laſt of the <hi>Nonnaturals</hi> we ſhall ſpeak to, are the Paſſions of the Mind. Theſe ought never to be forgot in treating of any Regimen for the Cure of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1073000500:34"/>chronic Diſeaſes: Upon the Mind, as the firſt Mover, depends the Freedom and Perfection of all the Functions of the Body; and this is reciprocally true; and tho' we know not, or are ever likely to know, the Laws by which they act upon each other, this we w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll know, and conſtantly experience it, that their Connexion is ſuch as will not allow one of them to be hurt without drawing the other into inevitable Suffering: <hi>They rejoice and mourn together.</hi> Whoever therefore deſires to reſtore the Machine to its priſtine Alacrity and Vigour, muſt always have an attentive Regard to its Aſſociate and Fellow-Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer. This Deſign may be often effected in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Degree by Medicine, by means of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Intercourſe we have been ſpeaking of; but other artful Means are alſo to be uſed for exciting, alleviating, or diverting the Paſſions, which need not be mention'd here, as they don't properly belong to this Place. In the preſent Caſe a chearful and lively Diſpoſition ought to be much encouraged, and the contrary to be diligently avoided or prevented. The firſt affords a free and liberal Supply of Spirits, as well to the Heart and the other involuntary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, as thoſe ſubſervient to the Will; and thus the Circulation dependent on them is briſk and free, which is always to be our Study in this and the like Diſeaſes. The latter or ſorrowful Mood produces the contrary Effects, and thoſe remarkably enough.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Intention, or the Diminution of the morbific Matter, both in the <hi>primae viae</hi> and whole
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1073000500:35"/>Body, is to be effected by cleanſing that Canal, and evacuating the morbific Matter out of it; and by this Means we cannot fail of leſſening its Quantity in every other Part of the Body. But this is to be done by two, and thoſe very different Evacuations.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is Vomiting; which is no other than a convulſive Contraction of the Stomach, and thoſe Organs, which, by Means of Nerves, immediately communicate with it, and is excited by any thing that is capable of producing that Contraction. It would be too tedious to give an Account here of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of every kind of <hi>Emetic:</hi> A very ſmall Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them is now in uſe, and a much ſmaller will be ſufficient for us here. The celebrated <hi>Ipec.</hi> which is now deſervedly had in ſo univerſal Eſteem, is by much the ſafeſt, and yet ſufficiently effectual: With this therefore alone, we ſhall be contented in our preſent Deſign of evacuating the <hi>Viſcid Pituit</hi> lodged in the Stomach, if we may be allow'd ſometimes on Occaſion the <hi>Tartar. Emet.</hi> which, if the Doſe be aſcertain'd with the requiſite Exactneſs, may deſerve the ſecond Place.</p>
            <p>The <hi>latter</hi> Evacuation is effected by a Set of Medicines intended for that ſole Uſe, under the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Name of <hi>Cathartics.</hi> But the judicious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients having obſerved the various Effects of <hi>Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,</hi> in producing a larger Diſcharge of different Humors, have, with Care and Exactneſs enough, reduced them into proper Order, according to theſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1073000500:36"/>various Effects; and tho' they could not explain upon mechanical Principles their Cauſes or Manner of Operation, as not being well enough acquainted with the Laws of the animal Oeconomy, as deduced by the Light of modern Diſcoveries, their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are however founded on Experience and moſt accurate Obſervation; nor does it ſignify to us, whether they have explain'd Effects from ſome ſpecific, hidden, or chimerical Properties, or by the Qualities of Hot and Cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is ſufficient that they have faithfully acquainted us with Matters of Fact, and give us the Liberty of embracing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting their Reaſoning. Theſe ſeveral Claſſes of purging Medicines derive their Names from the Humor they are obſerved moſt remarkably to act upon; and tho' in ſome of the Terms they have miſtook one Thing for another, a very little Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour will oblige us to excuſe this, and to admire that Sagacity, and extol the Induſtry that has laid the Foundation of almoſt all we know of theſe Matters, which deſerves our Confidence or the Appellation of Science.</p>
            <p>Of theſe Claſſes there is one Tribe peculiarly adapted to our Purpoſe of evacuating Phlegm out of the Stomach and Inteſtines, and thence called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Their Number is pretty conſiderable, as their Manner of Operation is various. We ſhall divide them into two Claſſes, of which,</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1073000500:37"/>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> are thoſe which dilute, attenuate, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the viſcid Matter, and ſo render it fit for Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Theſe are, 1. Water, which ought to be drank warm, with the Body lightly covered and expoſed to a cool Air, to prevent its paſſing off by the Skin. 2. The ſame render'd ſaponaceous with <hi>Sapo's,</hi> whether natural or artificial, as Honey, Sugar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refined, Caſſia, Manna, common Soap, as that which bears the Name of <hi>Caſtile</hi> or <hi>Venice, Sapo Philoſophorum,</hi> and that natural one of Animals, the <hi>Bile.</hi> 3. The ſame Fluid [Water] impregnated with the ſaponaceous Gums; which, by help alſo of their Acrimony, have a conſiderable ſolvent Power, as <hi>G. Aloes, Ammoniac, Galbanum, Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</hi> &amp;c. 4. A Solution of any of the chemical Salts which have a reſolvent Quality; ſuch are the <hi>Tartar regenerat. Tart. vitriolat. Tart. ſolub. Tart. ſimplex. Sal. Ammoniac. crud.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Claſs of <hi>Phlegmagogues</hi> comprehends all thoſe which are capable of giving ſuch a <hi>Stimulus</hi> as is ſufficient, and not more than ſufficient, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the <hi>periſtaltic</hi> Motion of the Inteſtines, by which they are to be diſcharged of their Contents: Theſe it is eaſy to ſee are to be endued with ſuch an <hi>Acrimony</hi> as is not too naked and violent, or too volatile: The firſt might bliſter and inflame the tender and very ſenſible <hi>Tunica Villoſa,</hi> and produce a Train of the worſt Symptoms, as Convulſions, Dyſentery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The latter would not be conſtant
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1073000500:38"/>enough for promoting this conſtant Motion, and be therefore inſufficient for the Purpoſe. Thoſe therefore will beſt anſwer our End which have a moderate and corrigible Acrimony, or envelop'd in ſome viſcid and glutinous Matter; and of this ſort are the following, which have many of them likewiſe a ſolvent Power; <hi>Oxymel. Hiera Picra.</hi> Several Preparations of <hi>Mercury,</hi> of which the ſafeſt and much the beſt is the <hi>Merc. Sublimat. Dulc.</hi> the <hi>Chemical Salts of the laſt Claſs,</hi> the Roots of <hi>Mechoacann. Brion. Jalap.</hi> &amp;c. The Fruit and middle Bark of the <hi>Ebulus,</hi> Juice of <hi>Buckthorn,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Our next Deſign is the Concoction of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bific Matter in the Veſſels, and whole Body; but before we proceed allow me to obſerve, that this Coction is no more than ſuch a Change of the morbid Matter, as renders it no longer noxious, but aſſimilates it ſo much to the Nature of the ſound Fluids, as to fit it for paſſing thro' its Veſſels without Hurt; and then it will no longer deſerve the Name of <hi>Morbid,</hi> but is tranſmuted or concocted ſo as to be an Humor <hi>Sanus;</hi> or, which is the ſame Thing, the Diſeaſe ceaſes. How therefore is this happy Change to be effected? To this the Anſwer is ſhort,—By Nature herſelf: And if this Word be not acceptable, I ſhall change it for another, the <hi>Vis Vitae,</hi> by which the Deſign is to be principally effected; tho' there is an additional Means to be afterwards mention'd, in which we ſhall be much beholden to Art. And indeed we muſt be ſo here,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1073000500:39"/>notwithſtanding our Expectation of ſeeing it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the Hand of Nature, the <hi>Vis Vitae,</hi> the Action of the Veſſels, and the Force of the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As theſe have not been hitherto ſufficient for the Purpoſe (or the Diſeaſe could not have taken Place) we muſt render them ſo by proper Methods; which are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> By corroborating the Veſſels. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By ſtimulating them. The <hi>firſt</hi> will render them fit for Contraction, and the <hi>latter</hi> will force them to it. The beſt Method of corroborating the Veſſels has been already given <hi>ex Profeſſo.</hi> The <hi>Stimulus</hi> neceſſary here, may be communicated by a Sett of Medicines, which have on this Account received the Name of <hi>Stimulantia;</hi> which, as they will be of eminent Service, deſerve in this Place to be ranged in ſome Order. The <hi>firſt</hi> ſhall be thoſe which act ſo upon the Mind, as to produce a greater Influx of the nervous Fluid, by which the Heart and Arteries are made to contract with greater Force as well as Velocity; and this we obſerve remarkably in ſeveral of the ſtronger Paſſions, as will be ſufficiently demonſtrated to any one who will take the Trouble of feeling the Pulſe of a Perſon under ſuch an Agitation; and this is true in a leſs Degree of the chearful and lively Diſpoſition formerly mention'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>next</hi> and moſt general Stimulants are the <hi>Acria</hi> of every Kind, but theſe are ſo numerous that they cannot well be enumerated, and this will be leſs neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only ſhall be recommended
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1073000500:40"/>here: Theſe are the <hi>Aromatics,</hi> of which the beſt are thoſe which are at the ſame Time <hi>Corroborants</hi> or <hi>Aſtringents.</hi> Such are the greater Part of the following; the Barks of <hi>Cinnamon, Peru, Winter, Caſſia lignea,</hi> &amp;c. The Roots of <hi>Gentian, Ginger, Imperatorium, Valerian, Calamus Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus, Galangal,</hi> &amp;c. Seeds of <hi>Cardamomum, Muſtard,</hi> &amp;c. The Leaves of the <hi>Abrotanum, Abſinthium, Ruta, Sabin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The laſt Tribe of <hi>Stimulants</hi> conſiſts of thoſe Things, which cannot be referred to either of the other two Orders, ſuch as Fire, Wounding Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Motion or Exerciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having now laid down the Method by which Nature is to be enabled to concoct the morbid Matter, let us conſider what further Aſſiſtance can be given to this Work by ſimple Art. The viſcid <hi>Pituit</hi> which conſtitutes the Diſeaſe, is to be attenuated and divided; and therefore our Indication commands the Uſe of thoſe Medicines, which are capable by a ſole menſtrual Power of inciding and attenuating. Some ſuch valuable Medicines indeed we have, whoſe menſtrual Force is perhaps much greater than is generally ſuppos'd: The following are the principal, <hi>viz.</hi> The neutral Salts, as the <hi>Tartar regenerat. Tartar ſolub. Tartar Vitriolat.</hi> the <hi>Spiritus Mindereri,</hi> which is indeed an excellent Reſolvent, and ſeems well to deſerve the Reputation it has acquired in a very few Years, a neutral Spirit
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1073000500:41"/>made for the moſt Part extemporaneouſly, by the Affuſion of Juice of <hi>Lemons</hi> on the <hi>Sal. Abſinth.</hi> or any other fix'd <hi>Alcaline</hi> Salt; the crude <hi>Sal. Armoniac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt not forget another Medicine, which ſeems to be endu'd with almoſt all the Properties we could wiſh for our Purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> of diſſolving, ſtimul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting, and attenuating; I mean the <hi>Aq. Calc.</hi> which, if It is uſed freſh, (as it always ought to be will perhaps preſerve it's Qualities, through the whole Courſe of Circulation, more perfectly than any Medicine we are acquainted with.</p>
            <p>For all theſe ineſtimable Preparations we are obliged to Chemiſtry; they perhaps deſerve to be eſteemed the moſt univerſal Medicines we are acquainted with; and the Uſe of them is never to be forgot in this Diſeaſe, but to be inſiſted on with the greateſt Care and Diligence from the Beginning to the Compleating the Cure.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not preſume to direct my learned Reader in the Choice, Order and Method, of preſcribing the Medicines, as all theſe will vary according to Circumſtances; but it may not be amiſs to obſerve that thoſe which dilute and attenuate are always firſt to be uſed, and that for a competent Time; and when this End is obtain'd, the Expulſion of the reſolved or concocted Matter will be eaſy. But
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1073000500:42"/>the <hi>Attenuantia,</hi> if prudently choſen, can never be given unſeaſonably.</p>
            <p>We have now treated of our great Deſign of correcting the univerſal <hi>Cachexy,</hi> and we are next to conſider the ſafeſt and moſt effectual Method of taking away the Tumours: And this is threefold. <hi>Firſt,</hi> By Reſolution. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By Suppuration. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By the Knife. The Reſolution of this Sort of Tumours will be difficult enough, nor ought it to be attempted in their more advanc'd State; thoſe only being fit for Reſolution which are recent, gentle, and where other Circumſtances are the beſt, and then it is to be perform'd if it can be perform'd at all: 1. By the internal Medicines for correcting and eradicating the proximate Cauſe of the Diſeaſe. 2. By Topical Applications, of which perhaps the beſt will be in Form of Vapour: For this Purpoſe the <hi>Antiſeptics</hi> are beſt, as Vinegar, whoſe Vapour may be directed through a Tunnel. The <hi>Antiſeptic</hi> Gums may be likewiſe very fitly apply'd in the Form of Plaiſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſhall not inſiſt longer on this Reſolution as we are not acquainted with any better Methods for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Suppuration of theſe obſtinate Tumours is to be attempted by the Application of thoſe Subſtances we generally term <hi>Maturants,</hi> or <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purants;</hi> which, tho' ſuppps'd to operate in ſome hidden or ſpecific Manner, do no more than confine,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1073000500:43"/>and, if the Term be allowable, reverberate the natural Heat, and by this Means promote that Change, which Nature herſelf only can effect, of the morbid Matter into <hi>Pus.</hi> Thus all glutinous, oily, or farinaceous Subſtances, become <hi>Suppurants,</hi> when apply'd in the Form of Plaiſter or Poultice; ſuch are Balſams, moſt Reſins, Meal of Barley, Oats, or Wheat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe will not be leſs effectual if they have added to them ſome ſmall Degree of <hi>Acrimony.</hi> When the Tumour is ſuppurated, and not till the Proceſs is quite perfected, it may be open'd at Diſcretion, either by Inciſion or the potential <hi>Cautery,</hi> and then the Ulcer is to be treated like an ordinary one, by the common <hi>Detergents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But neither Reſolution nor Suppuration will ſometimes ſucceed, and this is when the Tumour is very hard; and when this happens we have but one Method to chuſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Extirpation by the Knife, according to the ordinary Rules of Art; but this Operation is not to be undertaken without well conſidering the Circumſtances of the Caſe: If, however, the Diſeaſe be not inveterate, and the Tumour is benign, it may be extirpated; but not without obſerving it's Situation, and Proximity to the larger Veſſels, which will ſometimes abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely forbid it.</p>
            <p>The exulcerated Tumour is next to be treated of, and is to be healed, 1. By internal Medicines,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1073000500:44"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as may correct the putrid <hi>Acrimony,</hi> which has now contaminated the whole fluid Maſs, and is likely to produce a <hi>Pthiſis multiplex:</hi> This is to be done by mild, demulcent Medicines, together with the <hi>Antiſeptics.</hi> For this Purpoſe the Uſe of Milk is to be inſiſted on, together with ſuch Medicines as beſt anſwer this Intention; ſuch are the native Balſams, <hi>viz. Turpentine, Tar, Balſ. Capivi,</hi> &amp;c. 2. By deſtroying the Remainder of the Tumour and fungous Fleſh by <hi>Eſcharotics,</hi> together with the ordinary <hi>Detergents</hi> mixed with them; and when this is done the <hi>Cicatrizantia</hi> are to be apply'd.</p>
            <p>There is another Kind, or rather Form, of the exulcerated <hi>Struma,</hi> which preys upon the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana Celluloſa,</hi> betwixt the Muſcles, forming large <hi>Sinus</hi>'s betwixt them; and theſe will be difficultly healed, as indeed are all other <hi>Sinus</hi>'s betwixt Muſcles: Theſe are, however, to be treated much like others, <hi>viz.</hi> By filling them with Digeſtives and injecting <hi>Determents.</hi> 'Tis eaſy to ſee that this Manner of treating them (and we are not acquainted with a better) will require a very conſiderable Time for the healing of ſuch very deep Ulcers. When the Tendons, Articulations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are affected in the Manner we formerly deſcrib'd, they are to be treated like ordinary <hi>Apoſtems,</hi> Care being taken to correct as much as poſſible the putrid <hi>Diatheſis</hi> of the Blood, by the Method above preſcrib'd. It ſeems unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to mention, after what has been ſaid already,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1073000500:45"/>that if we diſcover any Signs of the Scurvy, or <hi>Lues,</hi> they are to be treated according to the eſtabliſh'd Rules of treating thoſe Diſeaſes; and if any Contra-Indications ſhould occur we can never be at a Loſs, if governed by that Golden Axiom of the Schools;</p>
            <q>Ubi Indicatio impar ſimul urget, tum ſemper erit ſatisfaciendum maximae.</q>
            <p>Thus I hope to have given ſuch a Method of Cure in this obſtinate Diſeaſe, as will not need further Explication: If it is perſiſted in with the Reſolution always to be expected from thoſe who wait for the Cure of Chronic Diſeaſes, we cannot doubt of all the Succeſs which it is in the Power of Art to give. To say more will be ſuperfluous; I therefore ſhall proceed to ſome other Matters relating to this Malady, abſolutely neceſſary to be conſider'd by thoſe who wiſh to be Maſters of the Subject.</p>
            <p>The firſt Thing which deſerves our Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is the common Complaint of it's Return, after the Tumours, or Ulcers, have been extirpated and healed. 'Tis true, this is often the Caſe, and is no ſmall Diſcouragement to the Patient and his Friends; and ſometimes obliges them to ſit down contented with believing that the Malady is incurable. But the Reaſon of all this is not difficult; they have attempted the Cure of the Diſeaſe without eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it's real Cauſe or Eſſence, the external
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1073000500:46"/>Appearances, being no more than the Product or Effects of the other. 'Tis no Wonder, therefore, that they have been diſappointed, and that the Tumours return very soon after they have been taken away; and, indeed, to expect a Cure from this Method, is juſt as reaſonable as it would be to hope for the Cure of an Inflammation by the Use of an Opiate</p>
            <p>As the Uſe of Mercury has been much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in this Disease, we cannot avoid taking notice of it, and giving our Reaſons for not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, in delivering the Method of Cure. We ſhall firſt therefore obſerve in what manner it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, ſo as to produce Salivation; and this is now generally agreed to depend on the Weight and Figure of its Parts, by which it increaſes the <hi>Momentum</hi> of the Blood, divides the Globules, and deſtroys their attracting Force; in a word, diſſolves a great Part of the Maſs into a putrid <hi>Tabum,</hi> and fits it for paſſing readily off by the ſecretory Organs, which however happens almoſt conſtantly (for Reaſons we ſhall not now attempt to give) by the ſalivary Glands. This wonderful Effect of a wonderful Fluid does not ſeem to depend on any other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples than theſe we have given; and therefore it appears to act chiefly on the red Globules of Blood, and that the phlegmatic Particles cannot be eaſily attenuated by it even whilſt in the Veſſels; and this will be much leſs probable when out of the Laws of Circulation, as the Glands may in ſome
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1073000500:47"/>ſenſe be ſaid to be. But if Mercury cannot eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, when in its recent State, it will be much leſs beneficial, yea, an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Poiſon, when the Diſeaſe is ſo far advanced as to have produced a Suppuration; and when the Tendons, Articulations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are affected, when the <hi>Pus</hi> being abſorb'd and convey'd into the Blood, contaminates the the whole Maſs with the putrid Acrimony, and thence produces an univerſal and deſperate <hi>Phthiſis:</hi> In this caſe, I say, Quickſilver cannot be exhibited without the worſt Effects The putrid <hi>Diatheſis</hi> of the Blood was already ſuch as threatned inevitable Death, and is the whole Maſs to be now render'd in a worſe degree putrid? which is the genuine Effect of Mercury; nor is this all, the augmented Velocity of the Blood augments the Hectic Fever, and thus every Thing conſpires to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a fatal Period.</p>
            <p>The Reader has perhaps already wonder'd that no mention has yet been made of Mineral Waters in the Cure of the <hi>Scrophula,</hi> which muſt be excus'd by ſaying, we deſignedly referred him hither for the ſake of ſhewing the Uſe which has been diſcover'd in one of our own Mineral Waters for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; I mean the celebrated Spaw at <hi>Scarborough,</hi> whoſe Reputation, which long and repeated Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience has acquir'd it, is not more than equal to its Merit. We ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate very ſoon, that its conſtituent Principles are ſuch as render it as univerſally uſeful, as 'tis poſſible for any
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1073000500:48"/>Mineral Water to be, or as any Medicine which the benevolent Hand of Nature has hitherto pointed out for the Preſervation or Reſtoration of the Health of Mortals. 'Tis indeed impoſſible for us to avoid the Suſpicion of Prejudice in treating on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but we beg leave to obſerve, that neither that Suſpicion, nor any other Reaſon ought to deter us from doing Juſtice to the Cauſe of Truth, or from publiſhing it when it concerns the Welfare of the Community and the Happineſs of Mankind. But we ſhall endeavour to prove, that this Character of the <hi>Scarborough</hi> Spaw-Waters is more than a Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric, and that they are adapted to the Cure of very many obſtinate Chronic Diſeaſes, tho' of few more aptly than the <hi>Scrophula;</hi> in which our grand Intention has been to evacuate the viſcid Matter out of the <hi>primae Viae,</hi> to attenuate the Fluids, gently to ſtimulate the Solids, and to invigorate the Spirits; and I appeal to the Judgment of the Learned whether theſe Indications are not the moſt univerſal ones we are acquainted with, for eradicating the firſt Cauſe or Sourſe of the whole Chronic Tribe. In order therefore to determine the Merit of theſe Waters, let us conſider their Principles ſeparately; which is, doubtleſs, the moſt certain Method of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the real Properties and Value of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, or Medicinal Waters; as by this means only we can be enabled to judge of their Manner of Operation, and of explaining all their <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> We know it is objected, and that truly, that the component Parts of Bodies cannot be ſuppos'd to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1073000500:49"/>have exiſted in the ſame Form before their Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as after they are divided by the Action of Fire; and that therefore a Chemical Analyſis is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for teaching us their Properties, as it does not ſhew us in what Form they exiſted before this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and how the ſeveral heterogeneous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were united; ſince on the Form of their previous Exiſtence and Manner of Union will very much depend their Effects. This Objection, as we have already confeſſed, is juſt; but it is punctually ſo of thoſe ſolid Bodies, which cannot be analyſed without extreme Torture of the Fire, in which the whole Proceſs is perform'd with Violence; but this is not the caſe with fluid Bodies, and thoſe of a leſs firm Texture; for of theſe we can diſcover the conſtituent Principles, and their Proportions, to each other, with little Force and great Certainty, and can determine their Effects with happy Exactneſs. In the <hi>Scarborough</hi> Spaw-Water, accurate and judicious Experiment has diſcover'd the following Principles.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> An Aqueous Fluid differing very little in any of its ſenſible Properties from common diſtilled Water, from which 'tis impoſſible by any Sort of Trial to diſtinguiſh it; from whence let us learn that the Medicinal Virtues of the Spaw Water don't reſide in this very ſimple Fluid.</p>
            <p>We are now to conſider what Medicinal Uſes this ſimple Water retains, in order to underſtand the Effects of that compound Fluid of which it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1073000500:50"/>conſtitutes ſo great a Part. And <hi>firſt,</hi> it is as we shall afterwards ſee the moſt ſuitable, and indeed the only ſuitable, <hi>Menſtruum</hi> for diſſolving the other Principles, and rendering them as effectual as poſſible by conveying them into the moſt minute Branches of the Vaſcular Syſtem; as it is the moſt ſubtle Fluid we are acquainted with, Mercury excepted, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of paſſing thro' Veſſels of inconceivable Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the famous <hi>Florentine</hi> Experiment has taught us, that it is capable of paſſing thro' the leaſt porous, that is moſt ſolid, of all ſolid Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> Gold. This Property alone is ſufficient to render it, valuable as a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and the Smoothneſs of its Particles is ſuch, as renders it entirely innocent; for it does not diſcover the leaſt Degree of <hi>Acrimony</hi> when apply'd to the moſt ſenſible Part of an Animal Body, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eye; but on the contrary, is one of the moſt general <hi>Antacria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The ſeveral Properties of Elementary Water, which cannot be fitly recited here, will ſhew us, and the Experience of Antiquity has confirm'd it, that Water the moſt common, and for that Reaſon the moſt neglected of all Medicines, ought to be eſteem'd one of the moſt univerſal. If it be true that the much greater Part of Diſeaſes proceed from Obſtruction, that Medicine will be moſt generally uſeful which beſt anſwers the Indications which Obſtructions in general require; and the two chief of theſe are, to attenuate and relax. Whether are not theſe the remarkable
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1073000500:51"/>Effects of Water? In acute Diſeaſes the Obſtruction is attended with a Fever, and theſe conſtitute an Inflammation, and then another additional <hi>Poſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> is required in the Indication, <hi>viz.</hi> to moderate the Fever by cooling, diluting, correcting <hi>Acrimony;</hi> and how beautifully are all theſe perform'd by Water? Nor can they be perform'd without it. I don't mean by this that ſimple Water is only fit or neceſſary for all theſe Purpoſes; by no Means: But all the Emulſions, Infuſions, Decoctions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are or can be given in acute Diſeaſes, conſiſt for the far greateſt Part of Elementary Water. We need not therefore wonder, that <hi>Boerhaave,</hi> the ſagacious and incomparable <hi>Boerhaave,</hi> in ſpeaking of <hi>Panacea</hi>'s, numbers Water amongſt the <hi>quatuor Remedia maximè univerſalia.</hi> I am far from intending by this to extol this Medicine beyond its due Merit, or to eſpouſe the Cauſe of a late Writer, who weakly undertook to prove it a Cure for every Diſeaſe: No; let me be allow'd this Opportunity of declaring myſelf a profeſs'd Enemy to all the <hi>Panacea</hi>'s, which Ignorance, Avarice, or Vain-Glory, have hitherto introduc'd into the World; and which have no Foundation in the Eſſence of Things, but are contrary to the known Laws of Nature; and a very ſmall Share of plain Philoſophy, or indeed of plain Senſe, is ſufficient to ſhew them contrary both to Philoſophy and Senſe. But the Subject naturally led, or rather obliged me, to ſpeak of the Virtues of Water, and to do Juſtice to its Merit.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1073000500:52"/>
            <p>The next and chief Principle of the <hi>Scarborough</hi> Water is a neutral purgative Salt (as indeed all neutral Salts are purgative when directed by a proper Regimen) of a remarkably bitter Taſte, readily diſſolving in the Mouth, its Pungency ſeeming to penetrate deep into the Tongue, tho' without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing any nauſeous Senſation. It eaſily diſſolves in the Air, tho' not near ſo readily as the <hi>Tart. Regenerat.</hi> and very quickly in twice its Weight of cold Water.</p>
            <p>Theſe Properties only are ſufficient to ſhew, that this Salt appears at leaſt <hi>a priori</hi> to be an excellent <hi>Deobſtruent,</hi> as all neutral Salts deſerve to be eſteem'd. Rational and Experimental Chemiſtry has taught us, that they have a ſurprizing ſolvent Power, and are therefore in a fluid Form the fitteſt Medicines we know of in the greater Part of chronic Diſeaſes. Long and repeated Experience has alſo taught, that the <hi>Scarborough</hi> Salt or Water are wonderfully ſafe, and have produced as ſew ill Effects as any efficacious Medicine can be ſuppoſed to do: But this, like all other Medicines, ought to be adminiſter'd by a judicious Hand, to thoſe who expect all its Advantages without any Inconveniences, which may well be expected from the imprudent or unſeaſonable Uſe of the beſt Remedies in Nature; tho' theſe are, perhaps, no where fewer than in the <hi>Scarborough</hi> Salt and Water. It don't appear ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in this Place to repeat what has been already
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1073000500:53"/>ſaid or neutral Medicines: They were believed, if not demonſtrated, to be the moſt uſeful Claſs of Remedies in the Cure not only of the <hi>Scrophula,</hi> but of the greater Part of chronic Diſeaſes. If this be true, or ſhall be granted by the Adepts in Phyſick, the <hi>Spaw</hi>-Waters of <hi>Scarborough</hi> will certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Regard, Eſteem, and Recommendation.</p>
            <p>The Salt may be given like other Neutrals, either as a Purgative or Alterant, by proportioning the Doſe to the Intention: Its Action may likewiſe, by a proper Regimen, be directed to the Kidneys; and it ſeems not leſs fit for anſwering the beſt Intentions of a <hi>Diuretic</hi> than any other Medicine of that Denomination. Its Operation is mild, eaſy, and gentle, and in this differs from moſt other <hi>Cathartics,</hi> that it revives and exhilarates the Spirits, producing and leaving after it a chearful Briſkneſs; an Effect, I ſay, contrary to that of moſt other Purgatives, which generally fatigue the Body, and depreſs the Spirits.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> There is another Salt in this Water to be ſeperated from it after the Chryſtallization of the other, and appears no other than common Sea Salt, whoſe ſingular Properties it diſcovers on every Experiment. Its Quantity is but ſmall, being only to the other in the Proportion of 1 to 18. Its Effects muſt conſequently be inconſiderable: It will, however, be allow'd to promote, in ſome ſmall
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1073000500:54"/>Degree, the Operation of the Waters, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the preſerving it from Putrefaction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> Principle is a white Powder or Earth, which the moſt ingenious Dr. <hi>Shaw</hi> calls an <hi>Alcaline</hi> Subſtance, as it effervates with all Acids, and changes the Syrup of Violets green. To this Earth are probably owing the good Effects, daily experienced, from drinking theſe Waters after the immoderate Uſe of Wine, by correcting the Acidity which ſuch Liquors contain and diſcover by their ill Effects in the Stomach.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> Principle of the <hi>Scarborough</hi> Waters is Air, and this it will be ſaid is contain'd in all Water; and indeed it had been unneceſſary to have taken notice of it here as a Principle, but that it is obſerv'd in ſomewhat more than ordinary Proportion. Of this Air we ſhall ſay no more than that to it is conſiderably owing its briſk Taſte, and perhaps its quicker Operation.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> A Mineral Spirit conſiſting of Particles of Iron exceedingly ſubtiliz'd: Theſe are in no inconſiderable Proportion, and muſt produce in ſome Degree the excellent Effects of <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Preparations, than which no Medicines we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with more effectually corroborate the Veſſels, attenuate the Fluids, increaſe the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and invigorate the Spirits. This Spirit is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably volatile, almoſt as much ſo as Heat itſelf,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1073000500:55"/>and ſcarcely to be confin'd by any Art, which makes it neceſſary for thoſe, who wiſh to have the entire Virtues of the Water, to drink it at the Well.</p>
            <p>Thus much on the <hi>Scarborough Spaw</hi>-Waters may be ſufficient to give ſuch an Idea of their Nature and Properties, as may ſhew how well they are adapted to the Cure not only of the Diſeaſe, which has been the Subject of this Eſſay, but of the greater Part of the formidable Chronic Tribe.</p>
