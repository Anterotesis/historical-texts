            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER To Some OBJECTIONS OF A <hi>Moderate ENQUIRER.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Robert Snow,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE received a Paper ſubſcribed by thee, and directed to the Church or People of God called <hi>Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. Which Paper contains ſome <hi>Objections,</hi> which (thou ſayſt) thou haſt heard ſpoken againſt us, and wherein thou deſireſt to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. To which we ſay, It is no ſtrange Thing to us to be ſpoken againſt by the World's Teachers, that being no more than befel the People of God, in the Firſt breaking forth of Chriſtianity in the World, Of whom it was ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 22. <hi>As concerning this Sect, we know that every where it is ſpoken againſt.</hi> But we are willing to endeavour thy Satisfaction, by Anſwering the <hi>Objections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Firſt is, <hi>You own no Day, either the Firſt or Laſt, as a Sabbath to the Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer:</hi> The Sabbath (which was the ſeventh or laſt Day of the Week) was given to the <hi>Jews, Ex.</hi> 16. 29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. Not to the <hi>Gentiles, Pſal.</hi> 147. 19, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. and was to laſt (as other typical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0266900800:3"/>
were) <hi>untill the time of Reformation, Heb.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>till the Seed ſhould come, Gal.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>which was Chriſt. ver.</hi> 16. <hi>the Lord of the Sabbath, Mat.</hi> 12. 8. <hi>who, in the Fulneſs of time, did blot out the Hand-writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and took it out the Way, nailing it to his Croſs, Col.</hi> 2. 14. From whence the Apoſtle thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, <hi>Let no man therefore judge you</hi> (the Saints and faithful Brethren, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 2.) <hi>in Meat or in Drink, or in reſpect of an Holy Day, or of the New Moon or of the Sabbath Days, Col.</hi> 2. 16. which, ſays he, <hi>are a Shadow of things to come, but the Body is of Chriſt. ver.</hi> 17. Thus was that <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which was given by God, to his People the <hi>Jews,</hi> ended and taken away by Chriſt, before the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were called to be his People. And as for the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of the Week, we do not read in the Holy Scriptures, that it is called the <hi>Sabbath-Day,</hi> or commanded to be kept and obſerved for a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as the <hi>Seventh Day</hi> had been. But, on the contrary, we find the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were <hi>Gentiles</hi> (though not without ſome mixture of believing <hi>Jews</hi> amongſt them, as appears, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 2.) ſays, <hi>One Man eſteems one Day above an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other</hi> (there was the believing <hi>Jew</hi>) <hi>Another eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every Day alike</hi> (there was the believing <hi>Gentile.</hi>) Well, what then! Doth he commend the Former of theſe, and condemn the Latter? No but he ſays, <hi>Let every Man be fully perſwaded in his own Mind,</hi> Rom. 14. 5. And in the 4<hi>th.</hi> 10<hi>th.</hi> and 13<hi>th.</hi> verſes diſſwades them from judging one another about the Obſerving, or not obſerving a Day, as well as about the Eating, or not eating of Meats; and ſeems to lay no more Streſs upon the one, than the other. And if the Drift of the Apoſtle's diſcourſe there be heedfully minded, it will appear that, as he ſets him who believed he might eat all Things, with him that eſteemed every Day a like; and him that eſteemed one Day above another, with him that eat Herbs: So he imputes the Weakneſs to the Latter, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. and ſets himſelf on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0266900800:4"/>
the other ſide, ſaying, <hi>We then that are ſtrong ought to bear the Infirmities of the Weak,</hi> Chap. 15. 1. And he tells the <hi>Galatians</hi> (which though a <hi>Gentile Chureh,</hi> had alſo <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Believers in it) <hi>I am afraid of you, leſt I have beſtowed upon you Labour in vain,</hi> Gal. 4. 11. Why ſo? <hi>Ye obſerve Days and Months, and Times, and Years,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. So jealous was the Apoſtle, leſt any that had been gathered from outward Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and from a ſhadowy State, ſhould imbon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage themſelves again in Shadows, and fall ſhort of injoying the Subſtance, which is the true Goſpel <hi>Reſt that remains to the People of God,</hi> Heb. 4. 9. Which in the next verſe is deſcribed to be, Their <hi>Ceaſing</hi> from their <hi>own Works, as God did from his. Into which Reſt we</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that have helieved, do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ver.</hi> 3. and in the 11. verſe he preſſes others to labour to enter into that Reſt. Now when the Apoſtle ſays, There Remains a Reſt, it plainly implies that the former Reſt, the outward Sabbatical Reſt, did not remain, but was paſſed away and gone. Nor is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the Reſt here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which is ſaid to Remain to the People of God, was an outward Bodily Reſting from outward Bodily Labour, on what ſoever Day; both, as that would be but to change one Type or Figure for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and, as the entring into this Reſt is ſet forth in the Text, as a Matter of Labour and Difficulty, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. as it is indeed, yet bleſſed be the Lord, he hath enabled ſome, that have believed in his Name, and ſubjected to his Power, to enter into this Reſt, in this his Day; and many are preſſing after it, as the true, abiding Goſpel-Reſt, which the Legal Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was but a Type or Shadow of.</p>
            <p>The 2. OBJECTION is, <hi>You deny the Scriptures to be any Rule for Man or Woman to walk by, ſo as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them to the ſaving of their Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> In this we are miſrepre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ented. We ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely own, love and regard the Holy Scriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0266900800:5"/>
with the Apoſtle, that <hi>they were given by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God, and are profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good Works,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17. and that <hi>they are able to make wiſe unto Salvation, through Faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus, ver.</hi> 15. And great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and delight we ſind in them, reading them in the openings of that Divine Spirit, by which they were given forth. We are ſo far from denying them to be <hi rend="blackletterType">any</hi> Rule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we acknowledge them to contain <hi rend="blackletterType">many</hi> excellent Rules, Precepts, Doctrines and Inſtructions, directing Man and Woman how to walk, that they may obtain the Salvation of their Souls. Yet we do not ſay (as ſome have done) that the Scriptures are the <hi>only</hi> Rule, or the <hi>chief</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> Rule: becauſe we dare not give the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Office of the Holy Spirit unto the Scriptures; For the Scriptures themſelves declare, That <hi>it is the Office of the Holy Spirit to guide Believers into all Truth, John.</hi> 16. 13. And indeed, the true Meaning and Benefit of the Scriptures themſelves is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to in the Reading of them, unleſs the Spirit that gave them forth do open them, and unſeal the Myſteries contained in them. So that the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is greater than the Scriptures, and therefore we cannot but give the chief Place unto him. For he is able to manifeſt himſelf unto Man, and to lead man into the Way of Salvation, either with and by the Scriptures, or without them, as he pleaſes: But the Scriptures cannot do that without the Operation of the Holy Spirit. Juſtly therefore do we affirm the Spirit of God, to be the <hi>Chief</hi> Rule, and yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Holy Scriptures to be a true Rule, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Inſtrument in the Hand of the Spirit, to direct Men and Women how they ought to walk, to obtain Salvation to their Souls, as the Spirit of the Lord makes uſe of the Scriptures to that End.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0266900800:6"/>The 3d OBJECTION is, <hi>You deny the Reſurrection of this mortal Body, that this Mortal ſhall not put on Immortality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> In this alſo we are miſrepreſented: We do not deny, but own the Reſurrection of the Dead; Believing, with the Apoſtle, that <hi>This Corruptible ſhall put on Incorruption, and this Mortal ſhall put on Immortality,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 54. And indeed, if we did not believe this, we might well ſay (as he did) <hi>If in this Life only we have Hope in Chriſt, we were of all Men moſt miſerable,</hi> ver. 19. <hi>And, Why ſtand we in jeopar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy every Hour,</hi> ver. 30. But the Lord knows, and we have openly and ſincerely declared, that we believe and own the Reſurrection of the Dead, according as the Holy Scriptures teſtify concerning it; Which ſay, <hi>Thou ſoweſt not that Body that ſhall be, but bare Grain</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But God giveth it a Body as it hath pleaſed him, and to every Seed his own Body,</hi> ver. 37, 38. <hi>It is ſown a natural Body; it is raiſed a Spiritual Body,</hi> ver. 44. the reaſon of which follows <hi>ver.</hi> 50. namely, <hi>That Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth Corruption inherit Incorruption.</hi> And as we firmly believe this; So we take this to be ſufficient, without being ſo curiouſly inquiſitive as he, who would needs ask, <hi>How are the Dead raiſed up? and with what Body do they come?</hi> ver. 35. and was called <hi>Fool</hi> for his Pains, <hi>ver.</hi> 36.</p>
            <p>The 4th OBJECTION is, <hi>You ſuffer Women to be your Teachers, that were forbid by the Apoſtle, for he ſays, that they ſhould keep ſilence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> of old had a ſtrong Perſuaſion (grounded upon ſome miſunderſtood Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) that the Salvation of God was confined to them, and belonged not at all to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And this Opinion had prevailed ſo far upon them, that even thoſe of them that received the Goſpel could not eaſily ſhake it off. In ſo much that, after <hi>Peter</hi> had been with <hi>Cornelius</hi> the <hi>Centurion,</hi> and was come
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0266900800:7"/>
back again to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he was called before the Church for it, <hi>they that were of the Circumciſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with him,</hi> and <hi>ſaying, Thou went'ſt in to Men uncircumciſed, and did'ſt eat with them,</hi> Act. 11. 2, 3. To whom, having related the Occaſion and Particulars of that Matter, he concludes his Defence thus, <hi>For as much then as God gave them the like Gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, what was I, that I could withſtand God?</hi> ver. 17. And in the next verſe it follows, <hi>when they heard theſe Things they held their Peace, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſied God,</hi> &amp;c. This Anſwer, which the Apoſtle gave in that Caſe, may be ſuitable (we think) for us to give in this Caſe, to ſuch as (from ſome miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Places of Scripture) are offended at us for Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Women to ſpeak in our Aſſemblies, <hi>viz.</hi> For as much as God hath given them the like Gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, what are we that we ſhould withſtand God? God, by his Servant <hi>Joel,</hi> in the Time of the Law, had made this Promiſe, with Relation to the Times of the Goſpel, <hi>viz. And it ſhall come to paſs afterwards (or in the laſt Days, as</hi> Peter <hi>repeats it,</hi> Act. 2. 17.) <hi>that I will pour out my Spirit upon all Fleſh, and your Sons and your Daughters ſhall prophecy, your old Men ſhall dream Dreams, your young Men ſhall ſee Viſions: And alſo upon the Servants and upon the Handmaids in theſe Days will I pour out my Spirit,</hi> Joel 2. 28, 29. (And they ſhall prophecy, adds <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 2. 18.) Here was no Diſtinction of Sex made; But this Promiſe of <hi>pouring out the Spirit,</hi> and of <hi>propheſying</hi> thereby, is extended as expreſly and fully to the Daughters as to the Sons, to the Handmaids as to the Servants. And this the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth expreſly apply to that great <hi>pouring forth of the Spirit upon the Church,</hi> at the Pentecoſt immediately after Chriſt's Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſaying, <hi>This is that which was ſpoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Joel,</hi> Acts 2. 16. Now at that great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0266900800:8"/>
pouring forth of the Spirit it appears the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were not excluded: For when, after the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Apoſtles and Diſciples were returned from Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Theſe all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with one Accord in Prayer and Supplication with the Women, and Mary the Mother of Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 1. 14. The Number of the Names together being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hundred and twenty, ver. 15. <hi>And when the Day of Pentecoſt was fully come, they were <hi rend="blackletterType">all</hi> with one Accord in one Place,</hi> Chap. 2. 1. and in verſ. 3. it is ſaid, the cloven <hi>Tongues ſate upon <hi rend="blackletterType">each</hi> of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance,</hi> ver. 4. Here was no Diſtinction made; no ſhutting out the Women; but all were together, all received the Gift of the Spirit, and began to <hi>Speake with other Tongues as the Spirit gave them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance.</hi> Nor was it thus only at that time, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that extraordinary Occaſion, but continued in the Church afterwards. For we read <hi>that Philip the Evangeliſt had four Daughters that did Propheſy;</hi> Acts 21. 8, 9. <hi>Phebe,</hi> a Woman, is recommended by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> not only as a <hi>Siſter,</hi> but as a <hi>Servant of the Church,</hi> Rom. 16. 1. <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> a Woman, is called by the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>My Helper</hi> (or Fellow Labourer) <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ver. 3. <hi>Tryphena</hi> and <hi>Tryphoſa,</hi> two godly Women, are ſaluted by him as <hi>Labourers in the Lord;</hi> And of the beloved <hi>Perſis,</hi> another Holy Woman, he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that <hi>ſhe laboured much in the Lord,</hi> ver. 12. The ſame Apoſtle, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> ſays, <hi>I intreat thee alſo, true Yoke Fellow, help thoſe Women which laboured with me in the Goſpel,</hi> Phil. 4. 3. Which is the Phraſe by which the Apoſtle doth frequently expreſs his own Miniſtry, And which he particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly applies to <hi>Timotheus,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Miniſter of God, and our Fellow Labourer in the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 3. 2. Which is a clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0266900800:9"/>
that thoſe Women, that had received the Gift of Propheſy, did miniſter therein to the Edification of the Church, as well as the Men. Nay the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in that very Epiſtle, wherein he is thought by ſome to diſcountenance <hi>Womens Preaching,</hi> doth give Directions for the Manner of their <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying,</hi> viz. <hi>That they ſhould do it with their Heads covered.</hi> For having firſt ſaid, <hi>Every Man praying or propheſying, having his Head covered, diſhonoureth his Head,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 4. He adds, <hi>But every Woman that Prayeth or Propheſyeth with her Head uncovered diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured her Head,</hi> ver. 5. This puts it out of doubt, that Womens <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Propheſying</hi> in the Church, was at that Time both lawful and uſual, as well as Mens.</p>
            <p>Now, that by <hi>Propheſying</hi> here is meant <hi>Preaching</hi> (not barely foretelling Things to come) may not only be inferred from the uſe of the ſame Word in the verſe foregoing, where, being ſpoken of Men, it is granted on all Hands to intend <hi>Preaching</hi> (and from thence the general practice of <hi>Mens Preaching uncovered</hi> is defended) but may alſo fairly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, from the explanation the Apoſtle gives of it, in Chap. 14. ver. 31. where he tells that Church in general, <hi>We may all Propheſy one by one that</hi> all <hi>may</hi> learn; Which manifeſts that by <hi>Propheſying</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Teaching,</hi> that being the proper way or means of <hi>Learning.</hi> And in the Beginning of that Chapter, where he prefers <hi>Propheſying</hi> before <hi>Speaking whith Tongues,</hi> ver. 1. and 5. he ſays, <hi>He that Propheſyeth, Speaketh unto Men, to Edification, and Exhortation, and Comfort,</hi> ver. 3. And, <hi>He that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſyeth, Edifieth the Church,</hi> ver. 4. which plainly ſhew that by <hi>Propheſying</hi> he meant <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Teaching,</hi> that being the proper means or way of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying. And therefore, ſeeing he not only allowed Women to <hi>Prophecy,</hi> but directed and adviſed them how they ſhould perform it <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 5. and that in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0266900800:10"/>
this Place <hi>Propheſying</hi> and <hi>Preaching</hi> appear to be one and the ſame Thing, it is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe he denied them the Liberty of <hi>Preaching,</hi> being gifted and called thereunto. As for thoſe Words of his, 1 Cor. 14. 34. <hi>Let your Women keep ſilence in the Churches: ſor it is not permitted unto them to ſpeak; but to be under Obedience, as alſo ſaith the Law.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve firſt, that thoſe Words, [<hi>as alſo ſaith the Law</hi>] relate only to the Womens being under <hi>Obedience,</hi> not to their keeping <hi>ſilence</hi> in the Church: For that was never enjoyned them in the Law, but they were permitted to ſpeak in the Congregation; And both <hi>Miriam,</hi> who was a Propheteſs, did ſing the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of the Lord, in the publick Congregation, <hi>Ex.</hi> 15. 20. 21. And <hi>Deborah,</hi> who was a Propheteſs, did recount the noble Acts of the Lord, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate his Praiſes in a Triumphant Song, <hi>Judges</hi> 5. Read alſo what <hi>Hanna</hi> ſpake in the Houſe of the Lord in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. And <hi>Anna,</hi> who was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs, did not only give thanks unto the Lord, but ſpake of Chriſt to all them that looked for Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in <hi>Jeruſalem, Luke</hi> 2. 38. This was direct <hi>Preaching,</hi> and that <hi>in the Temple.</hi> So that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were not enjoyned <hi>ſilence</hi> under the Law, but were permitted to <hi>Speak.</hi> In the next Place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Speaking it was that was forbidden by the Apoſtle in that Place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. which from his following Words will appear to be, not a Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Words of Life and Salvation, not a Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Spirit of God gives utterance; but ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſorderly, asking Queſtions unſeaſonably, and out of place; not ſpeaking for the Edification of Others, but ſpeaking for their own Information on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for he immediately adds, <hi>If they will learn any Thing, let them ask their Husbands at home,</hi> ver. 35. Theſe Words [<hi rend="blackletterType">learn</hi> and <hi rend="blackletterType">ask</hi>] plainly ſhew, that the Speaking here condemned was not a Speaking the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Goſpel for the Edification of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0266900800:11"/>
Church; but <hi>asking Queſtions</hi> for their own Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which they might have done at home, but not there: therefore he adds, <hi>For it is a Shame for Women to ſpeak in the Church.</hi> And ſo indeed it was, in ſuch a diſorderly manner as they ſpeake, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate or Catechiſe either the Miniſter, or their Huſbands, openly in the Church; to ask the Meaning of this, or call for an Explanation of that, which might look like a throwing off their Obedience to their Huſband, and muſt needs Occaſion Diſorders and Confuſion in the Aſſembly; which we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive was the Thing that troubled the Apoſtle, and which he laboured to reform: for he ſaid before, <hi>God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace,</hi> ver. 33. and he concludes the Chapter with this Admonition, <hi>Let all Things be done decently and in Order:</hi> So that it was the diſorderly Practice of ſome Women in that Church which he reproves, who, it ſeems, when any Thing was ſpoken which they did not underſtand, would interpoſe, and <hi>ask Queſtions</hi> for information Sake, which was uncomely in them, offenſive and troubleſome to the Congregation. This ſort of <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> was not permitted them, but was a Shame to them, and from which they ought to have kept ſilence <hi>in the Church.</hi> And <hi>if they will learn any Thing,</hi> ſays he, <hi>let them ask their Husbands at home.</hi> Of like import are thoſe other Words, of the ſame Apoſtle to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> and probably on the ſame Occaſion. <hi>Let the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>learn in ſilence with all Subjection. But I ſuffer not a Woman to teach, nor to uſurp Authority over the Man, but to be in ſilence,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 11, 12. For hence it appears ſtill, that the Occaſion they took of ſpeaking, was under pretence of <hi rend="blackletterType">learning,</hi> wherein they took an undue Liberty to <hi>ask Queſtions,</hi> as if they would catechiſe or teach their Huſbands. But though the Apoſtle would not ſuffer ſuch ſort of Speaking in the Church, as might give Occaſion to any to think that the Women did caſt off the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0266900800:12"/>
they owed, and did uſurp Authority over their Huſbands; nor after ſuch a manner, as might breed Confuſion in the Congregation (for he was ſo watchful againſt that, that he enjoyns the Man to be ſilent in that Caſe, as well as the Woman. <hi>If any Man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſpeak in an unknown Tongue,—let one interpret. But if there be no Interpreter, let him keep ſilence in the Church;</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 27, 28. Yet we have before ſhewed, that he allowed of <hi>Women propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and that by <hi>Propheſying,</hi> he meant <hi>Preaching.</hi> We have alſo given many Inſtances of Women that laboured in the Work of the Goſpel in that Day; and could, from a living and ſure experience, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Inſtances of many Women in this Day, whom the Lord hath committed the Word of Life and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation unto, and who, in the quickning Power and Vertue thereof, have ſounded forth the ſame, to the awakening of many that were a ſleep in Sin, and turning of many <hi>from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God,</hi> who are now become living Seals of their Miniſtry. Neither would this ſeem ſo ſtrange as it doth to ſome, did they duly conſider, That <hi>God is no Reſpecter of Perſons.</hi> But that, as, in the <hi>old Creation,</hi> Male and Female were Created in the Image of God: So, in the <hi>new Creation,</hi> Male and Female are all one in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28. But, as they that contended with <hi>Peter,</hi> for converſing with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when they had heard his Defence, held their Peace, and glorified God, ſaying, <hi>Then hath God alſo to the Gentiles granted Repentance unto Life, Acts</hi> 11. 18. So, we hope they that have taken Offence at us, for ſuffering Women to <hi>ſpeak</hi> in the Church, when they ſhall have duly and impartially weighed, what is herein offered for their Satisfaction, will hold their Peace (as to any Oppoſition thereunto) and glorify God, ſaying, <hi>Then hath God committed unto Women alſo the Word of Reconciliation.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0266900800:13"/>The fifth Objection is, <hi>You are a People that have gained Health to your Immortal Souls, and are ſure of Heaven, when the Scriptures ſay, that</hi> the Righteous Man falls ſeven times a Day; <hi>and the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid that</hi> Sin was ſtill actually in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We do not deſire to boaſt of any Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Yet we cannot but confeſs, to the Glory of God, and the Praiſe of his Holy Name, that His ſaving Health hath appeared in this his Day, and we (through his Mercy) have taſted of it. Chriſt, the Saviour, is manifeſted in Spirit, and we (through Grace) have felt the healing Virtue of his Divine Life and Power. Through the tender Mercy of our God, the Day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us, and hath given Light to us that ſate in Darkneſs and in the Shadow of Death, and hath guided our Feet into the way of Peace, and hath helped us to make our Calling and Election ſure. As for the Scripture thou mentioneſt, we do not find that the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The Righteous Man falls ſeven times a Day;</hi> but in <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 16. we find it thus written, <hi>For a Juſt Man falleth ſeven times, and riſeth up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but the Wicked ſhall fall into Miſchief.</hi> And as the Verſe before ſhews the Occaſion of theſe Words, where it is ſaid, <hi>Lay not wait, O wicked Man, againſt the Dwelling of the Righteous: ſpoil not his reſting place.</hi> So the latter Part of this 16th Verſe [<hi>but the wicked ſhall fall into Miſchief</hi>] implies, that the juſt Man doth not fall, as the wicked Man does, <hi>into Miſchief.</hi> And ſeeing all Sin is Miſchief, it ſeems as if the Fall here ſpoken of the juſt Man, were not a <hi>falling into Sin,</hi> but into ſome outward Calamity or Exerciſe. However the Place ſpeaks nothing of <hi>daily</hi> or <hi>continual falling.</hi> Nor do we remember that <hi>Paul</hi> doth uſe that very Expreſſion concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>viz. That Sin was ſtill actually in him;</hi> though we know that he doth, in divers places, run through, as it were, and open the various States and Travels
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0266900800:14"/>
of the Soul; in ſome of which he cried out, <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver,</hi> &amp;c! But he reſted not there, but quickly breaks forth into a Rejoycing, and cries out, <hi>I thank God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 7. 24, 25. And then in the next Chapter, having ſaid, <hi>There is no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> he ſays expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf. <hi>For the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death,</hi> ver. 2. And again, <hi>Thanks be to God, which giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 57. This <hi>Victory</hi> we preſs after; this <hi>Freedom from the Law of Sin and Death,</hi> we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and travel to attain unto, by a Subjection through Divine Aſſiſtance) to the <hi>Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 6th Objection is, <hi>Why your Teachers perſwade you, that all other People are in a barren and deſolate Condition, and are out of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Our Teachers do not perſwade us ſo; nor do we Judge ſo of all other People: For we our ſelves were gathered out of various Profeſſions, States and Conditions; and ſome of us, who had been ſeeking after the Lord in other Profeſſions, can remember, that before we were thus gathered to this divine Principle of <hi>Light,</hi> which the Lord hath ſet up, in this his Day, as an Enſign for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be gathered unto, and to walk in: we were not wholly barren and deſolate; but had, at Seaſons, ſome touches and taſts of the Vertue of that hidden Life, which we were then Strangers to; the Lord having regard to the Sincerity of our Hearts, and anſwering, in ſome meaſure, the Breathings of our Souls to him; ſo far, at leaſt, as to cheriſh and keep alive thoſe good Deſires which were begotten in us, and to beget in us a greater Hunger and Thirſt after him. And it is not hard to us to believe, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0266900800:15"/>
ſo it may be with others at this Day, who have an Integrity to the Lord, though not acquainted with his Outgoings, and Manifeſtations of himſelf in this Diſpenſation of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life:</hi> And both our Prayers to God the Father, in and through his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and our Labour and Endeavours, in the Openings of his Love and Life in our Hearts, are, that all theſe, in whatſoever Profeſſion, may be drawn off from all the dry Hills and barren Mountains, and gathered into the true Sheepfold. For we remember our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Other Sheep I have, which are not of this Fold: them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my Voice; and there ſhall be one Fold, and one Shepherd,</hi> Joh. 10. 16. The Lord grant, that none of theſe may miſtake his Voice, or diſobey it.</p>
            <p>The laſt Objection is, <hi>You deny all outward Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as</hi> Baptiſm, <hi>and the</hi> Six Principles, <hi>that were taught to the firſt primitive Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The Diſpenſation of the Law was <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and the Ordinances appertaining to that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation were <hi>outward</hi> alſo: But the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel is ſpiritual and <hi>inward,</hi> and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances appertaining to this Diſpenſation are of a ſpiritual Nature. The <hi>Baptiſm with Water</hi> was <hi>John</hi>'s, and came up under the Diſpenſation of the Law, nor did properly belong to the Goſpel Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, though for a time, by Condeſcention, continued, as Circumciſion, and ſome other Legal Rites, were. And this was that Baptiſm which <hi>Paul</hi> ſays Chriſt ſent him not to baptize with, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. But the <hi>Baptiſm of Chriſt,</hi> the true Goſpel-Baptiſm, that by which the true Believer is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed into Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. and buried with him into Death, ver. 4. <hi>The one Baptiſm,</hi> Eph. 4. 5. <hi>is the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire,</hi> and is plainly diſtinguiſhed from the Baptiſm with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, both by <hi>John,</hi> to whom the Water-Baptiſm
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0266900800:16"/>
belonged, and by Chriſt, to whom the Spirit-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm belonged. For <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>I indeed baptize you with Water unto Repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whoſe Shoos I am not worthy to bear: He ſhall Baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire,</hi> Mat. 3. 11. And Chriſt, as <hi>Luke</hi> records a little before his Aſcention, ſaid, <hi>John truly bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with Water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt not many days hence,</hi> Acts 1. 5. which was the Promiſe of the Father, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. delivered by Chriſt to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, juſt before his parting from them, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 49. Let it therefore be fairly conſidered, 1. That the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and therefore the Ordinances belonging to it ſhould be ſo too. 2 That in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. (From which place the Commiſſion for Water-Baptiſm is uſually fetched) there is no mention of Water. 3. That Baptiſm with Water is no where in Scripture called Chriſt's Baptiſm. 4. That Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with Water is frequently called <hi>John's Baptiſm.</hi> 5. That the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt is called <hi>Chriſt's Baptiſm.</hi> 6. That the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges but <hi>One Baptiſm,</hi> Eph. 4. 5. which cannot be ſuppoſed to be that with <hi>Water,</hi> ſince then he muſt exclude the Baptiſm of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> 7. That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking of the Baptiſm that ſaves, ſays expreſly, <hi>It is not the putting away the Filth of the Fleſh,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21. (which it is the Property of Water to do) as if he had ſaid, <hi>The Baptiſm which now ſaves us is not Water-Baptiſm.</hi> 8. That Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with Water is no where expreſly commanded in Scripture, as it would doubtleſs have been, had it been intended by Chriſt for a Goſpel Ordinance. 9. That tho' it was ſometimes uſed after Chriſt's Aſcention, yet that cannot authorize the uſe of it now, any more than of Circumciſion, and other Legal Ordinances, which, in Condeſcention to the Weakneſs of Believers in that Day, were alſo uſed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0266900800:17"/>
after Chriſt's Aſcention, yet are confeſt by all not to be in force now. For <hi>John,</hi> as himſelf ſaid, was to <hi>decreaſe,</hi> Joh. 3. 30. which related to his Miniſtry or Diſpenſation, not to his Perſon. Now a <hi rend="blackletterType">De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing</hi> implies a growing leſs, or wearing away by degrees, not all on a ſuddain; or at once; and therefore no wonder, if his Water-Baptiſm was continued for a time, even after Chriſt's Baptiſm of the Holy Spirit took place. But as Chriſt's Baptiſm was to <hi>increaſe,</hi> ſo <hi>John</hi>'s was to <hi>decreaſe,</hi> till Chriſt's came to be <hi>all in all,</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm wholly to give place. Let theſe things, we ſay, be duly weighed, and we hope we ſhall not be blamed, for leaving the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> and cleaving to the Baptiſm of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Six Principles</hi> thou mentioneſt, ſeeing thou haſt not declared what they are, it cannot be expected we ſhould ſpeak to them at this time. But we recommend to thee that holy divine Principle of <hi rend="blackletterType">Light</hi> wherewith Chriſt <hi>lighteth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> Joh. 1. 9. <hi>In which Light the Nations of them that are ſaved ſhall walk,</hi> Rev. 21. 24. And we heartily deſire thou mayſt walk therein.</p>

               <p>THE only Command from God, that we read of in Holy Scripture, for the Payment of Tythes, was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Levitical Law.</hi> Then God firſt reſerved to himſelf the Tythe of the Land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. 30. Which he did for this reaſon, that, intending to take the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> more peculiarly into his Service (as he did, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 6. in ſtead of, or in exchange for all the Firſt born of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ver. 12. 13. and 45. and Chap. 8. ver. 18.

               <p n="2">2. Now although it was grounded on a Principle of Moral Juſtice and Equity, that the <hi>Levites,</hi> thus engaged in a continual Attendance on a publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and ſhut out from their Share in the Inheritance of the promiſed Land ſhould receive a ſufficient
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0266900800:19"/>
Maintenance from them, for whom they performed that Service, and who enjoyed their Part of the Land: Yet the aſcertaining of the <hi>Quot a</hi> of that Maintenance to the exact proportion of a <hi>Tenth Part</hi> of the Increaſe of the Land, was not grounded on Moral Juſtice, but had its dependence on the Ceremonial Law, adapted and limited to the Polity of that Diſpenſation and People only. And that it might not be extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its appointed Time and Bounds, it pleaſed the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom, to ſubject it to ſuch Ceremonial Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as plainly rank it amongſt thoſe carnal Ordinances (Rites or Ceremonies) which were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but <hi>till the Time of Reformation,</hi> Spoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. For as God appointed the <hi>Levites</hi> to be offered for a <hi>Wave-Offering,</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Name and on the behalf of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Thou ſhalt bring the Levites to the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and thou ſhalt gather the whole Aſſembly of the Children of Iſrael together; And thou ſhalt bring the Levites before the Lord, and the Children of Iſrael ſhall put their Hands upon the Levites: And Aaron ſhall offer</hi> (in the Margin <hi>Wave) the Levites before the Lord, for an Offering</hi> (in the Margin, <hi>Wave-Offering) of the Children of Iſrael; that they may execute the Service of the Lord,</hi> Num. 8. 9, 10, 11. So the Tythes, which were aſſigned for the Maintenance of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> were to be firſt offered, by the People, as an <hi>Heave-Offering</hi> unto the Lord.

This makes it evident, beyond doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Tythes, which were given by the People to the <hi>Levites,</hi> and by the <hi>Levites</hi> to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, had their Dependence on the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, as that Prieſthood had; And were to ſtand no longer than that Law and that Prieſthood ſtood: Which was but till <hi>Shiloh</hi> came, and by the Offering of himſelf once for all, had put an end to all the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy Offerings under that Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> did ſo well underſtand, that he poſitively declared, that <hi>the Levitical Prieſthood being changed, there was made of Neceſſity a Change alſo of the Law,</hi> (of that Law, by which that Prieſthood and the Maintenance of it had ſtood) See <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. And 'tis alſo evident from Scripture and Primitive Antiquity that neither the Apoſtles themſelves, nor (for ſome ages after them) any of the Chriſtians, did meddle with, or at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themſelves about Tythes; But let them totally fall as they did the other abrogated Part, <hi>viz.</hi> Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But after that the Myſtery of Iniquity, which in the Apoſtles time began to work (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 7.) had wrought to that Degree amongſt ſome Chriſtians, and had drawn them ſo far from the Purity and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Goſpel, as to form and model the Church in many things, by and according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern amongſt other Ceremonial Parts of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, which had been aboliſhed by the Coming and Death of Chriſt. Tythes were preached up again (about the latter end of the fourth Century, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the fifth) by ſome, at firſt, under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0266900800:21"/>
of Alms and Charity (becauſe part of the Tythes under the Levitical Law, were appointed for the Maintenance of the Fatherleſs, the Widow and the Stranger, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 28, 29.) And by others, as then ſtill due by the Moſaic Law, which had required them to be paid to the Levitical Prieſthood. Which Plea afterwards (Corruptions increaſing in the Church, and in thoſe eſpecially who were called the <hi>Church-Men,</hi> or <hi>Clergy</hi>) more and more prevailing, the Payment of Tythes was re-introduced, as due by thoſe Levitical Laws, which had been given to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old. And upon that Bottom, Tythes have ſtood, been claimed and the Claim defended unto this Day.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now, not only he that thus claims, and receives Tythes; but he that conſents to, and complies with ſuch Claim, by paying Tythes thus brought in, and thus claimed, doth thereby implicitly, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally (at leaſt) deny that Chriſt has put an End to the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and conſequently that he is come, and hath ſuffered in his Fleſh for Mankind. And that this may appear as plain as is poſſible, I ſhall draw the Matter into an Argument, thus: <list>
                     <item>To uphold any Thing, as ſtill in force, which was to be taken away, and ceaſe at and by the Death of Chriſt, is to deny that Chriſt is come and hath ſuffered in his Fleſh for Mankind.</item>

But Tythes were a part of the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Therefore Tythes were to be taken away, and ceaſe at and by the Death of Chriſt:</item>
                  </list> The <hi>Major</hi> here again is unexceptionable; And the <hi>Minor</hi> is thus proved.<list>
                     <item>Every <hi>Heave-Offering</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> was <hi>a Part</hi> of the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi>

                     <item>But Tythes were an <hi>Heave-Offering</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> Num. 18. 24.</item>

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. By this it appears, that without regard had of the Perſon to whom, or the Uſe for which Tythes are paid, the paying of Tythes (as well as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them) being <hi>a Part</hi> of the abrogated Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> imports a denyal of the Coming, and Death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Hence it is, that Tythes have been, and are commonly called <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> or <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt.</hi> And hence hath riſen that ſaying (often uſed not only by our antient Friends, but by ſome of the Martyrs long before) <hi>viz. He that pays Tythes, doth thereby deny that Chriſt is come in the Fleſh.</hi> That Concluſion could not have been drawn, from the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Tythes to a wrong Miniſtry, or for a wrong uſe only, though ſuch Payment be evil: Nor could any thing juſtify that Inference, but the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Tythes, depending on the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which muſt of Neceſſity and in courſe fall, and ceaſe when Chriſt ſuffered; the paying of Tythes carries in it a ſuppoſal, that that Law is not yet cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but is ſtill in force: and conſequently that Chriſt, whoſe Death muſt needs have ended it, is not yet come, nor has yet ſuffered in his Fleſh for Mankind.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That other Objection, not leſs weighty than common againſt paying Tythes to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> The unlawfulneſs of upholding a falſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, to perform a falſe Worſhip (being it ſelf ſo

clear and plain, that it needs no illuſtration) I ſhall, in this Diſcourſe, no further meddle with, than to obſerve in my way, how far it may affect thoſe Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes alſo, which the <hi>Impropriators</hi> claim. Wherefore having premiſed what is ſaid before concerning Tythes in general, to what Hand, or for what Uſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever paid, let us now inquire into thoſe Tythes, which are called <hi>Impropriate.</hi>

               <head>Of Impropriate <hi>TYTHES.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THAT theſe Tythes, which are claimed by the <hi>Impropriators,</hi> are of the ſame Nature, and ſtand originally on the ſame Root and Ground, on which the other Tythes ſtand, which are claimed and exacted by the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> is evident from hence, that they were all heretofore, theſe as well as thoſe, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, and paid to ſome or other of the <hi>Romiſh Clergy,</hi> or their Appendices, the Religious Orders (ſo called) and upon the ſame Foot. That is, Theſe <hi>Impropriate Tythes</hi> were paid to thoſe Religious Orders or Houſes, as being due to God, by vertue, of the <hi>Levitic-Law;</hi> as well as the other Tythes were paid to the <hi>Pariſh-Prieſts,</hi> on the ſame ſuppoſed Right, from the ſame Law. But how theſe Ththes came to thoſe Religious Houſes firſt, and how afterwards from them to the <hi>Impropriators,</hi> is next to be inquired.</p>
               <p>Until the <hi>Lateran Council</hi> (ſo named, becauſe it was holden in the <hi>Pope's</hi> Palace at <hi>Rome,</hi> called the <hi>Lateran</hi>) in the Year 1215. It was in the choice of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man to give his Tythes to what Church he pleaſed, ſo he gave them to ſome Church. And even after that Council, the <hi>Popes,</hi> as Heads of that Church, by their diſpencing Power, did give leave to ſuch as would ſue, and pay for it, to give their Tythes from the <hi>Pariſh-Prieſt,</hi> to ſuch Order of Religious People (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Monks, Friers,</hi> or <hi>Nuns</hi>) as they were beſt affected to. By which means, the <hi>Pariſh-Prieſts</hi> (called <hi>Seculars,</hi>)
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0266900800:24"/>
and thoſe of the ſeveral Religious Orders (called by a general Title, <hi>Regulars</hi>) being left to ſcramble, as they could, for maintenance, the <hi>Regulars (mendicant Fryers,</hi> and others) ſwarming in all Places, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, at leaſt, to greater Sanctity, and Auſterity of Life, than the <hi>Pariſh-Prieſts,</hi> prevailed with the People, either living or dying, to give not only very conſiderable Eſtates in Lands, but alſo the Tythes of other Lands, and of whole Pariſhes, from the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Prieſts,</hi> to their Religious Houſes or Convents.</p>
               <p>The Tythes, or Parſonages, ſo given, were then called <hi>Appropriations,</hi> becauſe they were appropriated to this, that, or the other Religious Houſe or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. And I have read, that there were in <hi>England</hi> about 3845 Parſonages thus appropriated. And as Tythes were then held to be <hi>due to God and holy Church;</hi> and thoſe Religious Orders were reputed a part of that Church: So the Tythes, as well as the Lands thus given them, were continued to them, and poſſeſſed by them, till that general Storm aroſe, in K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. his time, which overturned thoſe Religious Houſes and Orders together. And here, by the way, it may be noted, That while thoſe Religious Houſes ſtood, a great part of the Lands which had been given to them, were, by Papal Authority, exempted from paying Tythes: Whence it is, that many of thoſe Eſtates, which had belonged to thoſe Religious Houſes, remain diſcharged from the Burden of Tythes ſtill.</p>
               <p>As Tythes were ſet up here on the Authority of the <hi>Levitic Law,</hi> and in imitation of the <hi>Jewiſh Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> conſonant to that Law: So while thoſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Houſes ſtood, and the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Power prevailed here, not only the <hi>Seculars</hi> or <hi>Pariſh-Prieſts,</hi> but all thoſe <hi>Regulars</hi> who received Tythes, were bound to pay the <hi>Tenths</hi> out of the Tythes they received to the Head of their Church, the <hi>Pope</hi> as the <hi>Levites,</hi> under the Ceremonial Law, were required to do to the Prieſts.</p>
               <p>But after that K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. (upon a Quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

the <hi>Pope</hi> and him, about his Divorce from his firſt Queen <hi>Catharine,</hi> which he earneſtly deſired, and the <hi>Pope</hi> would not grant) fell off from the <hi>Pope</hi> (though not from <hi>Popery:</hi> For after that, he retained the moſt pernicious Doctrines of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> contained in the ſix Articles, and burnt ſome for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them) he threw off the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Supremacy here, and aſſumed it to himſelf; declaring himſelf, and being declared, firſt by the <hi>Clergy</hi> in their <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and ſoon after by <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
