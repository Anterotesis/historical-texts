            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE BY THE EDITOR.</head>
            <p>MR. HENRY THRALE, brewer, in the borough of Southwark (I ſay it without flattery, or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted hopes of reward from his ſurviving relict and daughters), was one of the moſt eminent and opulent traders that England ever had. He was, moreover, a well-built, ſtout man, in his perſon. His wife, Mrs. Heſter Lynch, whoſe maiden name was Saluſbury, was of creditable Welch extraction. She was rather a little woman, but ſmart, of pregnant parts, and ſome ſhare of book-learning. They kept a very plentiful table, both for meat and drink, to which thoſe who are called <hi>Wits,</hi> and alſo many ingenious artiſts, gladly repaired as to a convenient houſe of call, where they had nothing to pay, except their court to Mrs. Thrale, who doubtleſs deſerved, while ſhe was flattered by their compliments. The moſt diſtinguiſhed of them, and, as one may ſay, the foreman of the whole, was Dr. SAMUEL JOHNSON, the celebrated Lichfield au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, who wrote an Engliſh Dictionary, and ſeveral works of a good moral tendency, and was famous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, for ſhrewd ſayings and lively jokes. He was a very large man, and by no means well-looking, but rather the contrary; neither was he neat and cleanly in his perſon and dreſs. He was, notwithſtanding, a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0157300300:5"/>
no ſmall favourite with Mrs. Thrale, both in her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's life-time, and for ſome ſhort while after; and from a collection of their letters, which is extant, and has been put forth in print by herſelf, it appears that there was no over-delicate niceneſs, but truly the plaineſt familiarity between them; as witneſs theſe, and the like paſſages:—"I hope, in time, to be like the great bull." lett. 34.—"Dr. Taylor deſires always to have his compliments ſent. He is, in his uſual way, very buſy getting a bull to his cows, and a dog to his bitches. Old Shakeſpeare is dead, and he wants to buy another horſe to his mares." lett. 180.—"You muſt take the chance of finding me, <hi>better or worſe.</hi> This you may know at preſent, that my <hi>affection</hi> for you is not diminiſhed, and my <hi>expectation</hi> from you is increaſed." lett. 277.—"I am harraſſed by a very diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable operation of the <hi>cantharides,</hi> which I am endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to <hi>control</hi> by copious dilution." lett. 303.—"On the 19th of laſt month I evacuated twenty pints of water." lett. 342.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thrale and his wife had a family of five daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to whom they did not grudge to give every piece of genteel education. Signor Baretti was entertained in the houſe, at bed and board, to teach them the Italian tongue; and Signor Piozzi, it is believed, was liberally rewarded for teaching them to ſing, and play on the harpſichord. Mrs. Thrale had not an <hi>ear,</hi> as the ſaying is, but ſhe had an <hi>eye</hi> to this her daughter's muſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0157300300:6"/>
who, it appears, by her ſaid publication, was permitted to <hi>love</hi> her. "Piozzi, I find, is coming, and when <hi>he</hi> comes, and <hi>I</hi> come, you will have two about you that <hi>love</hi> you." lett. 275. This was in her widowhood; and indeed it is plain that Dr. Samuel Johnſon himſelf had then alſo pretenſions to her; the diſappointment of which, by her preference of Signor Piozzi, whom ſhe afterwards married, no doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, with other conſiderations, to his writing that ſevere anſwer on her informing him of her reſolution, which anſwer ſhe has very prudently ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>Indeed, recently after the death of Mr. Henry Thrale, there were not wanting many who conjectured that a matrimonial union would take place between the widow and Dr. Samuel Johnſon; and ſome went ſo far as to aſſert, that it was his determined purpoſe, not only to carry on the buſineſs under the <hi>firm</hi> of the brewery, but even to aſſume the name and arms of Thrale. Upon this foundation, and no better, the bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or ſome other ſuch rhymſter of the Borough, bantered the buſineſs in the following homely lines:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Hail, Johnſon!</l>
               <l>Thrale Johnſon,</l>
               <l>Brewer of good ale, Johnſon;</l>
               <l>While thus you drive ſo bold a trade,</l>
               <l>Your caſh will never ſail, Johnſon.</l>
               <l>Though Madam's ſomewhat ſtale, Johnſon,</l>
               <l>You'll find ſhe'll yet be frail, Johnſon;</l>
               <l>For many years ſhe tried your head,</l>
               <l>And now ſhe'll try—, Johnſon.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0157300300:7"/>
Whether it was that a copy of this balderdaſh reached Dr. Samuel Johnſon, and made him anxious leſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity ſhould look upon his tender paſſion as of a very coarſe and vulgar nature, or whether he was merely incited by her blandiſhments to give a ſpecimen of his juvenile vivacity, or from whatever other cauſe, it would ſeem, that in the confidence of their being ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily joined in marriage, he ſent her the following wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding verſes; of which, it is probable, ſhe gave a copy to Signor Baretti, or to ſome other perſon with whom ſhe at that time was intimate.</p>
            <p>The ſame having, by ſome ſtrange chance, fallen into my hands, I thought I could not do better than lay them before the publick.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to their being certainly written by Dr. Samuel Johnſon, I honeſtly confeſs I am no judge of ſuch matters, and therefore will not pretend to ſay any thing of my own knowledge upon that head. But I am well aſſured by a perſon of ſkill, that they have the undoubted ſterling mark, and that no other man in the kingdom could make them but himſelf.</p>

            <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
            <p>THE Poet, pleaſed with the reminiſcence of his poetical powers, prepares to concentrate them in his Miſtreſs—He proſtrates his dignity to her in verſatility of character—Plumes himſelf on his fancied felicity, and, by a bold image, equal to any in Anacreon, at once perſonifies, and perſonates that Beer which was the glory of her houſe—Touches on his jealouſy of Signor Piozzi—Exults in his ſuppoſed victory over his rival—Deſcribes the congratulations on the nuptials be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his deareſt dear lady; but characteriſtically hints at the malignity of human nature—Repreſents the envy with which their happineſs is beheld—Weary of continence, ſolaces himſelf with the proſpect of future enjoyment—Paints it with vigorous ſtrokes and glowing colours—Takes care to give it the delicate ſanction of ſentiment—Aſſumes a reflex honour, by projecting illuſtrious matches for his lady's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by her firſt huſband; but maintains his own ſuperiority, by figuring himſelf the father of an heir male—Concludes, in mythological enthuſiaſm, that he is greater than Atlas.</p>
