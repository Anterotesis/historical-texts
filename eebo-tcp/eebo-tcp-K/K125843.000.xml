         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Roguiſh MILLER;
<figure/>
OR, Nothing got by Cheating.
A TRUE BALLAD.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>A Miller there was, and he liv'd at his Mill,</l>
               <l>Which was built on a ſtream at the foot of a hill.</l>
               <l>He cheated all day and he drank all the night,</l>
               <l>For cheating and drinking was all his delight;</l>
               <l>While his moments in tippling unheeded did roll,</l>
               <l>This ſtill was his ſaying—be ſure to take toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Whoever ſent corn to be ground at his Mill,</l>
               <l>He ſpoilt it, he chang'd it, he pilfer'd it ſtill;</l>
               <l>In villainy thus a long courſe he did run,</l>
               <l>For he fancy'd that cheating was very good fun.</l>
               <l>He car'd not what came of his body or ſoul,</l>
               <l>While this was his ſaying—I'll always take toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If you ſent a full Sack of good corn to his Mill,</l>
               <l>A Sack of bad flour he ſent you back ſtill,</l>
               <l>For he fancy'd that when he the wheat had once ground,</l>
               <l>The difference wou'd not be eaſily found:</l>
               <l>Now to change good for bad was as if he had ſtole,</l>
               <l>And he not only chang'd it—but always took toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Neighbours oft ſent him their Money to pay,</l>
               <l>But he always refus'd it and ſent it away;</l>
               <l>Had he taken the Money he'd have got but his due,</l>
               <l>But the payment that's lawful for him wou'd not do;</l>
               <l>What was honeſtly his he deſpis'd on the whole,</l>
               <l>Becauſe he got more from—the taking of toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>One day when a Farmer had ſent a good ſack</l>
               <l>Of his Corn to be ground, and then ſent for it back;</l>
               <l>He call'd to his Man and demanded ſtraitway,</l>
               <l>If for this he had taken the toll on that day.</l>
               <l>The Man ſtrait declar'd, that tho' nought he had ſtole,</l>
               <l>Yet that he had taken—the full of the toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He then call'd his maid, and he aſk'd her good lack</l>
               <l>If toll ſhe had taken from that very ſack;</l>
               <l>She declar'd that ſhe had, but he fond of pelf,</l>
               <l>Said, for fear that you ſhou'd not, I'll take it myſelf;</l>
               <l>So raſhly he ventur'd the loſs of his Soul,</l>
               <l>And mended his practice—by thrice taking toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At length he grew bolder and bolder in ſin,</l>
               <l>And cheating he deeper and deeper got in;</l>
               <l>Of Satan, alas! he was quite at the beck,</l>
               <l>Where he firſt took a pound he at length took a peck,</l>
               <l>No church he frequented to pray for his Soul,</l>
               <l>Who wou'd might go thither—ſo he could take toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Farmer, the Squire, the Parſon likewiſe</l>
               <l>Agreed to obſerve him with ſtill keener Eyes;</l>
               <l>But the Juſtice he cheated to ſuch a degree,</l>
               <l>That no longer with patience his frauds cou'd he ſee;</l>
               <l>So he ſent him to jail by the LAW's juſt controul,</l>
               <l>And a MITTIMUS paid him—for taking of toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Come all honeſt Millers whoever you be,</l>
               <l>And liſten to counſel that's given by me;</l>
               <l>Be content, like fair tradeſmen with moderate gains,</l>
               <l>And look for a lawful reward of your pains;</l>
               <l>If 'tis paid you in money be pleas'd on the whole</l>
               <l>And if you take any—take moderate toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O! ſeek not each way to defraud that you can,</l>
               <l>Nor cheat in the flour, nor cheat in the bran;</l>
               <l>Be honeſt and all Men will flock to your Mill,</l>
               <l>And tho' others want cuſtom, yours ne'er will ſtand ſtill.</l>
               <l>And when to your MAKER you give up your ſoul,</l>
               <l>You'll rejoice that you always—took moderate toll.</l>
