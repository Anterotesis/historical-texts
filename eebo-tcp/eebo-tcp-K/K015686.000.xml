            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Whether this eſſential part of the public ſervice may be beſt executed—by the old laws ſomewhat modified—or your plan, ſubverſive of the whole antient code,—ſhall be the ſhort queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us.—</p>
               <p>Your plan appears to me objectionable as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine too various, and complex in the movements required.—But firſt it would be right to examine the conſtituent parts. I ſhall take them as they ariſe in your bill.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>COMMISSIONERS.</head>
               <p>Were the principle of the bill unexceptionable,—the parliamentary appointment of theſe Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, merely to divide Counties into Diſtricts, would be liable to no material objection.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>DISTRICT COMMITTEE.</head>
               <p>Paſſing over the endleſs nuiſances of the Magiſtrates taking polls in the ſeveral Diſtricts—an election of this Committee by <hi>ballot,</hi> carries the impropriety of ſuch an appointment upon the face of it. If the office of a Diſtrict Committee-man prove a deſirable one, perſons of ſuperior influence will find no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0881100500:6"/>
in engroſſing ſuch power within themſelves.—On the other hand, if it turn out unprofitable, and troubleſome, they will take care to a man, not to be elected, and in that caſe none but the ignorant and incapable will be choſen.—</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>DISTRICT AGENT.</head>
               <p>This Officer to be elected by the firſt <hi>Diſtrict Comlmittee,</hi> will of courſe be the choice of the moſt extenſive pariſhes, ſending a plurality of voices to the ſaid Committee.—The ſmall pariſhes,—dragged reluctantly into the corporation—muſt conſequently be at the mercy of the larger throughout every Diſtrict.—Notwithſtanding all the parade of various Committees, the ſole government of the Diſtrict would center in this ſame Agent. He would be veſted with ſuch full, and abſolute authority by your bill, that he is not even required to make any return of his examination of the three years accounts,—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"unleſs to HIM there ſhall APPEAR any omiſſion, or miſrepreſentation."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"In all matters of doubt and difficulty,—indeed,—he MAY conſult any member or members of the <hi>Diſtrict Committee</hi> near him, and act under his, or their advice, till the next Committee meeting."</q>—But how few <hi>doubts</hi> a man will be troubled with, poſſeſſed of ſuch powers,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0881100500:7"/>
may readily be conceived.—He is further authoriſed to relieve paupers at home, or ſend them to the workhouſe, as he may think proper: the Diſtrict Committee will therefore erect your workhouſes at a conſiderable expence to little or no purpoſe, ſhould their Agent deem it more adviſeable to adminiſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief pretty generally to paupers at their own houſes.—Indeed the <hi>diſcretionary power</hi> to be veſted in this man throughout, may be directed by him, ſo as to clog every wheel of your plan at his pleaſure. But even admitting him diſpoſed to do what is right;—in caſes of difficulty—and many ſuch muſt daily occur—how do you direct him to act?—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"He muſt apply to the <hi>Diſtrict Committee</hi> for inſtructions:"</q>—true—but ſuch Committee may not meet for a month; and after this reference to them, the matter muſt be tried further back to the <hi>County Committee,</hi> who will not aſſemble for a fortnight longer; and even then a ſufficient number of members may not attend to form a board!—What muſt be the ultimatum of all this?—The <hi>Agent</hi> will become COMPTROLLER GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERAL of the Poor throughout his Diſtrict, or leave the diſtreſſes of the indigent, and the intereſts of the pariſhioners, to the hand of chance to regulate!</p>
               <p>Should any reſiſtance be made to the authority of this officer, the bill points out no mode of redreſs; it is probable therefore, that the neighbouring magiſtrate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0881100500:8"/>
muſt in this inſtance, be called upon for his aid, to enforce this novel ſyſtem of juriſprudence.—But after all, what APPEAL is left to the unfortunate pauper, under the probable tyranny of his new taſk-maſter? Here we are left totally in the dark.—You will hardly give ſuch appellant juriſdiction to the Magiſtrates, thus to offend the delicacy of the new created powers. Is the oppreſſed object then to ſearch for redreſs, perhaps for <hi>bread,</hi> through the perplexing mazes of <hi>Diſtrict Agents—Diſtrict Committees</hi>—and <hi>County Committees?</hi>—This would amount to little ſhort of an abſolute prohibition of juſtice; and therefore, you Sir, can beſt explain, by what mode you mean this appeal to be ſecured.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>OVERSEERS.</head>
               <p>Your idea of electing <hi>Overſeers</hi> with a ſalary, I cannot deem adviſeable. In that caſe it will always become an object with the moſt powerful pariſhioner to command the office, either for himſelf, or his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent. The objection to the preſent mode of appointment by the Magiſtrates, in parochial ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, you ſtate to be, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"becauſe no regard is thus paid to the qualification of the perſons nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated."</q>—Do you conceive Sir, that your <hi>elective</hi> mode will leſſen the evil?—I am apprehenſive it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0881100500:9"/>
may have a contrary effect.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"The office of <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer,</hi>"</q> you ſay, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"is proverbially a burthen on thoſe, who are ſo unfortunate as to be liable to it."</q>—It might have been ſo formerly, but the caſe is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially altered<note n="*" place="bottom">At the laſt Midſummer Quarter Seſſions for ESSEX, a ſubſtantial farmer abſurdly appealed againſt the Juſtices' appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of two Overſeers, from an extreme anxiety to ſerve the office himſelf.</note>. Conſiderable ſums are now raiſed by the increaſe of rates; the expenditure of theſe, gives a kind of local patronage, which men ſeem every day more deſirous of obtaining. Indeed this part of your propoſition is done away in the ſame page of your <hi>Conſiderations</hi> [p. 12,] by your own refutation.—You have no ſooner ſtated, that Overſeers are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>againſt their will,</hi>"</q> than you thus inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate the aſſertion. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I am afraid many of theſe officers [<hi>Overſeers</hi>] are ſuch, as are <hi>ſtudious to obtain their ſituations,</hi> in order to convert them to their own advantage, or that of their friends."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Be this as it may, as executive inſtruments only, under the magiſtracy—their proper ſtation—the preſent mode of appointment is evidently the moſt prudent.</p>
               <p>But with what grace would the Overſeer, elected by your plan for his extreme <hi>reſpectability,</hi> ſubmit
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0881100500:10"/>
to be the meer runner of the Diſtrict Agent? Few men of ordinary ſpirit would bend to ſo ſervile a degradation.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Each Overſeer,"</q> you ſay, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"is to be watchful within his pariſh, but the Diſtrict Agent is to be awake to the neceſſities of the whole Diſtrict. <hi>Does any one ſtand in need of relief? Does any want employment? Has an induſtrious man met with an accident that has diſabled him from working? Are children grown too old to be any longer kept in idleneſs? Has any vagrant introduced himſelf into the pariſh, and become an annoyance by begging, or a cauſe of ſuſpicion, by appearing unemployed? The Overſeer is to make repreſentation to the Diſtrict Agent.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are ſuppoſed to be the bounden duties of the <hi>Overſeer,</hi> according to the laws now in force, except the ſervile part of the office—the repreſentation to the Diſtrict Agent.—And do you really believe, Sir, that this reference on every circumſtance that may ariſe, occaſioning endleſs trouble, would facilitate the deſired redreſs?—Suppoſing the Agent even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reſident within his Diſtrict,—what unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able confuſion and expence muſt attend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, and often fruitleſs journies and enquiries, by various Overſeers, after this individual Agent, in order that he may inveſtigate their reſpective com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints!
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0881100500:11"/>
—In a word, giving both Overſeer and Agent full credit for the trueſt zeal, and beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in the diſcharge of their duty, I think it would be found impoſſible for them to execute, what your bill ſeems to require at their hands.</p>

               <head>COUNTY COMMITTEE.</head>
               <p>This Committee, with qualifications equal to that of the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> is to be elected by ballot—and ſeems intended as a board of general controul, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"liable to a penalty of 10l. each for non-attendance, unleſs in caſes of ſickneſs, or ſome unavoidable accident!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>You ſeem, Sir, to build much on the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendence of your plan, being thus veſted in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal gentlemen of the county. Here likewiſe, I fear, you would experience a diſappointment.—You cannot but have obſerved, with what extreme reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance country gentlemen attach themſelves to public buſineſs. To make their appearance at a ſummer Aſſizes, or an occaſional Quarter Seſſions, is generally the utmoſt extent of their county exertions. As a proof of this, I need only inſtance, the neglected Commiſſions of Turnpikes, Sewers, &amp;c.—Under the dread therefore of being dragged into a dry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail

            <div type="introduction">
               <p>I FLATTER myſelf, I ſhall have no great difficulty in proving, that, by a trifling modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and ſpirited enforcement of the exiſting Laws, the three great objects of our enquiry may be completely effected.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Diſcretionary Power,</hi> which Overſeers have too long been ſuffered to exerciſe, contrary to every
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0881100500:15"/>
principle of juſtice and policy,—the alarming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of paupers, as well as poors rates, may fairly be aſcribed.—All the grievances on this ſubject, now crying aloud for redreſs, will be found to ariſe from ſome one or other of the following cauſes, viz.</p>
               <p>From Overſeers permitting idle, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly perſons to remain, after they find they have illegally obtruded themſelves into their ſeveral pariſhes.</p>
               <p>From ſettled inhabitants being ſuffered to grow ſlothful, and live without the viſible means of gaining their bread.</p>
               <p>From the neglect of Overſeers in not ſeeing the children of paupers early brought up to proper habits of induſtry.</p>
               <p>From the partial iſſuing of Pariſh Certificates.</p>
               <p>From wanton, and capricious removals.</p>

                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0881100500:16"/>
From groundleſs appeals to the General Quarter Seſſions.</p>
               <p>From the wanton expenditure of pariſh money in ſearching after paupers, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From unfair rates of partial aſſeſſments, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing charges thereto, not connected with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the poor.</p>
               <p>In all the particulars above ſtated, the Overſeer will be found almoſt invariably to exerciſe his own diſcretion, from the preſent difficulty of puniſhing him for any mal-conduct.<note n="*" place="bottom">In many caſes, Overſeers are enabled to ſet the vague au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Magiſtrate at defiance.</note> A conſiderable ſhare of the poor are rendered helpleſs, and the ſtate is deprived of their induſtry, by the ſhameful negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of pariſh officers. It is high time, therefore, to diſpoſſeſs them of their diſcretionary power, and hold them up to a ſtrict diſcharge of their real duty, by <note n="‖" place="bottom">To be paid to the informer on conviction of the offending officer.</note>fines the moſt exemplary.</p>
               <p>For the three firſt articles, containing <hi>neglect of office,</hi> the penalties to which an Overſeer might be made ſubject, would ſoon operate as an effectual

               <p>Every perſon obtruding himſelf into any pariſh, not being able to give a proper and ſatisfactory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of himſelf, and not departing thence within a certain limited time, after due notice given him by the Overſeer, or Conſtable, ſhould be deemed a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant, and be ſummarily puniſhed accordingly.</p>
               <p>Every perſon, whether ſingle or married, who has been permitted, openly, to reſide forty days ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively in any pariſh, without receiving due no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to depart from it, ſhould be deemed a ſettled inhabitant thereof; and the Overſeer be adjudged to pay a certain fine, in aid of the poor-rates, for ſuch neglect of his office. Some proviſion of this kind might ſtimulate the Overſeer, to what is ſo much wanting, an early diſcharge of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant part of his duty. At preſent, from the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary power which enables him to remove the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding pauper, at his leiſure, the place of ſettlement from various circumſtances, becomes doubtful: and hence ariſe the charges of removal, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional expence of defending it, whether it prove well, or ill founded.</p>

               <head>APPEALS.</head>
               <p>Appeals from orders of removal, form a very heavy part of the parochial burdens. Upon a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate calculation, two-thirds of the appeals heard at the quarter ſeſſions, are either totally groundleſs, or prove wanton litigations between neighbouring pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes. Theſe notions of legal hoſtility are now ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally inculcated, that no Overſeer thinks he makes a decent figure in the records of the pariſh which is honored with his mark, unleſs his pride has been gratified with an expenſive appeal, though the object of ſuch contention, may never become chargeable a ſingle ſix-pence! It appears pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that queſtions of this deſcription might either be prevented, or at leaſt be heard, and decided in a more ſummary way. For this end I would propoſe, that no appeals whatever, from orders of removal, ſhould be admitted, without the previous inveſtigation and ſanction of the major part of the magiſtrates of the diviſion, (at their petty ſeſſions aſſembled) in which the appellant pariſh is ſituate; and where the appellant, and reſpondent pariſhes both lie in the ſame diviſion, that ſuch appeals ſhould be brought to iſſue before the magiſtrates of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion aforeſaid, from whoſe adjudication no further

               <head>RATES.</head>
               <p>The ſhameful inequality of <hi>rates,</hi> has long, and juſtly been complained of, as a grievous oppreſſion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0881100500:22"/>
on the ſmall occupiers in moſt pariſhes throughout the kingdom. It is not a rare inſtance, for the little farmer, renting but ſixty acres, to pay as heavy an aſſeſſment, as the wealthy yeoman, poſſeſſing more than double that quantity of land. An equality of rate, <hi>ad valorem,</hi> would be the moſt effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for this crying evil. To this the common place argument may be objected, of <hi>the impolicy of rating improvements;</hi> but ſurely it is no leſs impoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic to limit them to the <hi>wealthy</hi> only, but for whoſe grinding impoſts, the ſmaller farmers might partake of the profit, as well as the credit of agricultural improvement.</p>
               <p>A pariſh officer, before his rate is paſſed, ſhould be ſworn that no article whatever ſtands charged thereon, but what has been, <hi>bona fide,</hi> expended for the ſole uſe of the poor.—This would be the means of excluding many of thoſe ſmuggled items of <hi>feaſting,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. which lead, in no ſmall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to the enormity of parochial burdens.</p>
               <p>A certain ſum per mile ſhould be limitted for the removal, and bringing home of paupers; for ſo vague and extravagant are the charges at preſent on this occaſion, that pariſhes in general pay from ſeven up to fifteen pounds, for the mere incidental expence of removing two or three paupers, leſs than
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0881100500:23"/>
fifty miles! and the pariſhioners very rarely enquire into ſuch ſhameful conduct. To this we may add, that thoſe accounts are too often paſſed by the mere ſignature of the magiſtrate, not only without a ſingle queſtion of enquiry, but even without the atteſting oath of the officer.—</p>
               <p>The ſeveral duties of the <hi>Overſeer</hi> being once clearly, and expreſsly declared, an intermediate offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer between him and the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the great advantage of the public.

thereof, with all other requiſite matter, to the petty ſeſſions, to be from thence returned to the general quarter ſeſſions, there to be duly enquired into, and the offending parties proſecuted at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the county. I ſee no objection to the <hi>High Conſtable</hi> of the diviſion being employed herein, with an additional ſtipend, and thus raiſed from an uſeleſs, to that of an active civil officer, between the Juſtice and Overſeer, as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated.—</p>
               <p>For the comfortable ſupport of the poor, the puniſhment of the diſorderly, and the economical expenditure of the parochial funds, but little more would be found wanting. Objects of diſtreſs, by the vigilance of active officers, would ſoon be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in their numbers. Children, from their earlieſt years, would be trained in the paths of induſtry; and, in any caſes of mal-conduct on the part of pariſh officers, the neceſſary appeal, through the <hi>Comptroller,</hi> or the neighbouring magiſtrate, would be ſpeedy in its operation, and certain in its effect. Not a ſlothful inhabitant could remain in a pariſh unaccounted for; nor a ſingle individual ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelf therein, without the viſible means of procuring an honeſt livelihood.

this eſſential part of their duty. Great miſchief ariſes from the difficulty which they conceive might attend ſuch rigorous exertions, by virtue of any law at preſent enacted. Juſtices of the peace ſhould, at the ſame time be empowered, on the complaint of pariſh officers, ſummarily to puniſh idle and diſorderly perſons, who refuſe to labour, or are not able to render a good account of themſelves. The preſent, and only mode of ſending them to the houſe of correction, there to await the deciſion of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſeſſions, is of itſelf often a puniſhment too heavy for the offence; and inſtead of operating to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the amendment of the culprit, nine times out of ten only qualifies him by a general contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of morals, for the moſt deſperate atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments!</p>
