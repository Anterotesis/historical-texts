            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>SECTION I.</head>
               <p>BEFORE we proceed, it will be neceſſary to explain, in a ſimple manner, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe bodily powers, which Conſtitute the very Principles of Life.</p>
               <p>The Human Body is ſuſtained and kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, by three principal powers, which like the movements of a Clock or Watch, co-operate and aſſiſt each other: The firſt is the brain and Nervous Syſtem proceeding from it, the grand Source of all Senſation; The Second, is the Heart and Arteries, or blood Veſſels, which give motion and circulation to the Blood; And the Third is the Stomach and Bowels, which prepare the Aliment and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Nouriſhment for thoſe, as well as all parts of the Body.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0672201300:4"/>
               <p>In ſpeaking of Digeſtion it will be remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Stomach loſes its power when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of Nervous Influence; and we ſhould here take notice, that the Regularity and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Heart's motion, chiefly depend on the ſame cauſe.</p>
               <p>As therefore the Brain and Nerves, the Heart and Arteries, and the Stomach and Bowels, are the principal inſtruments of all Senſation, Circulation, Nutrition, Life and Motion, and the very Agents which govern and direct the whole Animal Machine; It will be neceſſarily conſequent, that when any of them becomes diſconcerted, and put out of order, the vital functions of the Body depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon them, muſt then be unduly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. <q>"where one Link's broken, the whole chain's deſtroyed."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Such is the extraordinary Sympathy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe between thoſe ſeveral organs, that like ſo many little provinces, allied by mutual Intereſt, not one of them can exerciſe its full power without the aſſiſtance and concurrence of the reſt; for as the Heart and Stomach cannot act without the aſſiſtance of the Brain, or the Stomach Digeſt without receiving a due Quantity of blood from the Heart; ſo neither can the Heart have ſufficient force to keep up the circulation, without a continual ſupply of nouriſhment from the Stomach;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0672201300:5"/>or even the Brain itſelf exert its Influence over thoſe organs without being duly nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by Both. Although it will evidently appear, that the Nerves are the Immediate or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of all vital motion and Senſation, and the medium by which impreſſions made on the Body are inſtantly conveyed to the mind; yet the preciſe manner by which this miſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intercourſe is carried on, remains a ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret in nature with which, perhaps, we ſhall never be acquainted</p>
               <p>So intimately connected are the Body and Soul, and ſuch their Correſpondence, that Impreſſions made on the one naturally influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the other with the like feelings: Thus, by immoderate grief the digeſtive faculty of the Stomach is impaired and taken away, and by a blow on the head which injures the Brain, the Soul is as it were dethroned, and loſing its empire over the Body, all ſenſe and motion are inſtantly deſtroyed. The Soul, or Intellect, whilſt confined to the Body, "That muddy Veſture of decay," is obliged to ſtoop to the ſtate and condition of the Nerves, whoſe feelings are liable to alteration from a thouſand accidental or unavoidable cauſes, ſo as to occaſion diſeaſes, or being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally aboliſhed, to produce inſtant death. Thoſe, as well as many other circumſtances, concur to prove that the faculties and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0672201300:6"/>of the mind, in a great meaſure, depend on the bodily organs with which they co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and where thoſe are changed from their natural State, ſo are its appetites and oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.</p>
               <p>How different is the State of the Body and Soul when the veſſels are empty or full, viz. after long faſting, or a plentiful meal, in the firſt the pulſe is weak and unequal, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion pale, the Body languid, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits deſponding: But after eating and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate uſe of wine, the Springs of Life are wound up, and the Body and Soul are reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their native vigour.</p>
               <p>The conſent between the Brain and Heart is remarkable, for, intenſe Study or thinking quickens the Pulſe, and a ſudden fright will occaſion palpetations or a convulſive Struggle of the heart, even ſometimes to a mortal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation: in both theſe caſes, the firſt impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is made on the Brain, and the Heart, like a faithfull companion, ſuffers by ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; but whether the Nerves act as Tubes, or Vibrating Cords, like the Strings of a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Inſtrument, or whether they ſerve as conductors to ſome ſubtle fluid ſimilar to that of Electric Fire, we are wholly ignorant The Brain ſeems therefore to the Nerves, what the Heart is to the Blood Veſſels or Arteries; for too violent a degree of Action in the laſt,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0672201300:7"/>will produce heat and increaſe circulation, as may be obſerved after violent exerciſe, or in the time of a Fever: in like manner, when the power of the Brain and Nerves is too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently impreſſed on the Body or Soul, their Senſations will be rendered too quick and exquiſite; like the motion of a watch, which becomes rapid and irregular when the main ſpring acts too ſtrongly on the ſeveral wheels and ſubordinate movements.</p>
               <p>Impreſſions made on the Soul will often totally ſubdue thoſe of the Body: and on the contrary, ſuch as are made on the Body, will remove thoſe of the Soul; all which may ſupply an Intelligent obſerver with uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hints in the cure of ſuch diſeaſes as have been unſucceſsfully treated by medicines.</p>
               <p>Religious doubts which perplex the Soul with alternate Hopes and fears, a Sedentary life, or warm, damp air, all diſpoſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to Melancholy, by weakning the Nervous power. Thoſe are the general cauſes of low Spirits, and acquired melancholy, which always operate moſt powerfully on People of nice Senſations, whoſe Pleaſures and Pains from over-delicacy of the Nervous Syſtem, are too exquiſite for ſenſe; but the preciſe manner in which they produce their effects, or why ſuch cauſes do not always oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſimilar conſequences, in ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular State of the Nerves, is utterly unknown.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0672201300:8"/>
               <q>
                  <l>"Where Joy moſt revels, Grief doth moſt lament;</l>
                  <l>Grief Joys. Joy grieves, on ſlender accident."</l>
               </q>
               <p>Thoſe, on the contrary, of more clumſy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, who are poſſeſſed of little more than Vegetable-feeling, never experience the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Nervous Diſorders; but if they have leſs pleaſure, the account is balanced by their enduring leſs pain.</p>
               <p>We have already obſerved, that the Body and Soul, receive all their information by means of the Brain and Nerves, and that by Thoſe they mutually converſe and ſympathize with each other; hence it will follow, that whenever thoſe Organs are Injured, and like unfaithful Meſſengers, do not truly execute their Office, and repreſent things as they are, the Patient will then be impoſed upon, by Deluſive Perception, and figure to herſelf things which have no exiſtence, but in her own diſtempered Brain.</p>
               <p>They ſuppoſe that every one looks upon them with a malignant eye, and puts the worſt conſtruction on what they ſay and do; In ſhort, though they are induſtrious to torment themſelves, by means which appear ludicrous, they experience ſubſtantial miſery, and are ſometimes driven to deſperation, and Suicide; ſo that in the whole catalogue of earthly evils, human Nature cannot preſent an object more truly pitiable!</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0672201300:9"/>
               <p>What then ſhall be ſaid of thoſe who either from Ambition or the view of gain, ſtifle the feelings of honour and humanity, and ſordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit to form alliances which Entail he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary miſeries on their poſterity, more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous than death itſelf! and who, therefore, inſtead of remembering the Authors of their being with filial affection, muſt behold them with indignation and ſorrow!</p>
               <p>Retirement and bodily eaſe are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the melancholy, for whilſt they ſit ſtill unemployed, they become a prey to their own thoughts. On the contrary, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and ſeverity of Diet, are beneficial; for no one can think or ſtudy with the ſame at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, when impreſſed with the diſagreeable ſenſation of Hunger, or tormented with a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging tooth, as when he is perfectly at eaſe.</p>
               <p>Since we find that painful ſenſations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Body or Mind, often deſtroy health and occaſion Melancholy; by parity of reaſoning it may be concluded, that pleaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able feelings of a contrary nature will bid faireſt to reſtore it: The chiefeſt of thoſe are, Chearful Company, Poetry, Muſic, and Dramatic entertainments of the Comic kind, Frequent exerciſe in the open Fields, or flower Gardens, the waters of Tunbridge or Spa, aſſiſted by that ſovereign remedy the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0672201300:10"/>Peruvian Bark, and the uſe of the cold Bath, will alſo be found powerfully Salutary.</p>
               <p>The Study of Natural Hiſtory, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of delineating ſome of its moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and minute objects arranged under their proper claſſes, as thoſe of Birds, Inſects and Flowers, will afford very pleaſing and rational entertainment and aſſiſt in diverting the mind from things of a more ſerious nature. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular thoughts and reflections of the mind are joined with certain conditions of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and therefore, our manner of living, in a conſiderable Degree, changes our manner of thinking. Hence by Pravelling, the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal benefits of Air, Exerciſe and Diet, will at once be moſt agreeably obtain'd; all which tend to ſtrengthen the Conſtitution, and to wear out diſagreeable impreſſions made on the Body or mind by introducing others of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature.</p>
               <p>The next Sovereign remedy in diſeaſes of the mind is Muſic. Cicero aſſerts it's amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, and Plato Suppoſes the effect of harmony on the mind is equal to that of air on the Body: Its Divine influence is exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by David in the Cure of Saul; and the Eaſtern Monarch who had conquered the world, was himſelf Subdued by the Seraphic Strains of Timotheus's Harp, which ſo capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated his ear, that he was rouſed into mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0672201300:11"/>or ſoothed into melancholy as the ſounds became ſprightly and animated, or Solemn and Slow.</p>
               <p>So wonderful is the empire of Muſic over the mind, as recorded by the antients, that it leads the ſoldier undaunted to the <q>"Immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent deadly breach."</q> and alternately ſtops the rage of conqueſt by its varied power: It mitigates bodily pain, ſuſpends the malignant force of madneſs and deſpair, and lulls the Soul into traquility and peace.</p>
               <p>The effect of muſic however will be differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent according to the ſtile, and manner of its compoſition, and therefore ſhould be adapted to the particular ſtate and diſpoſition of the mind. The plaintive Tone of ſoft Flutes will induce a pleaſing languor, and compoſe it when tortured with rage or irritated by the more violent paſſions; and on the Contrary, the merry pipe and Tabor will exhilerate, and raiſe the moping head of melancholy, depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Religious Deſpair, Diſapointed Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or hopeleſs Love.</p>
               <p>Let us appeal to the refined feelings of thoſe moſt ſuſceptible of the Divine power of harmony, to prove its ſovereign influence over the mind; that it is the true oblivious Antidote, the Nepenthe of the Gods, to heal a wounded Spirit, to exalt the Soul above low-thoughted care, and lap it in Elyſium.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0672201300:12"/>
               <p>This great ſenſibility occaſions people of Rank to be Victims of their moſt favourite feelings; all that afflicts or threatens others, all the evil incident to mankind in general, are to them real grievances, affecting them, very frequently, more than their own private complaints, and eſſentially deſtroy their health; in a word, infinitely more ſenſible of tender impreſſions, and expoſed to a much greater number than the Peaſant, of neceſſity they muſt ſuffer much more.</p>
               <p>Nerves continually agitated by humours which are always irritative, by diſordering the harmony of the Organs, and enfeebling the Body, murder the mental faculties; which are ſo much dependant on the Situation of its ſurrounding body, that whatever diſorders The oeconomy of the one, abſolutely preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices the mode of thinking in the other.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>"That bright'ning ray, by God himſelf beſtow'd,</l>
                  <l>Blends with our Senſes, and like them grows weak."</l>
               </q>
               <p>Nervous diſorders, that diſpoſition to be too eaſily affected and ſuſceptible of irregular and painful emotions, is one of the moſt cruel ſcourges to people of rank that has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. It moſt commonly occurs, and till now, has been particularly unhappy in a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken treatment, becauſe its origin had not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0672201300:13"/>been ſufficiently inveſtigated: it's different Species, which required very different reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, was left unexamined. This Branch of Phyſic is at preſent too much confined to hypotheſis, the Subject of party diſputes, or at leaſt influenced by Faſhion.</p>
               <p>Many Eminent Phyſicians, regarding all diſorders of the Nerves as the Conſequences of relaxed fibres, and weak digeſtions, would effect a cure by means of remedies which are hot, and ſtrengthening, by Gums, Steel, Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Camphire, Caſtor, Muſk, Spirituous Tinctures, Opium, &amp;c. which is an error ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar to the following, in ſpeaking of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion and Stomachic remedies. In attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting all Nervous complaints to one cauſe, they have propoſed but one kind of remedy, which unhappily has no better ſucceſs than in complaints of the Stomach. Nerves inflamed by the immoderate uſe of Aromatics, are not relieved by uſing Aſſafoetida; a ſharper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine than the moſt piquant Aromatic: thoſe who are dried up by the abuſe of Barbadoes Water and Maraſquin, will not find aſſiſtance by drinking great quantities of the Tincture of Gentian, of Valerian, or of Caſtor; but thoſe remedies ſo hurtful, in theſe caſes, are very beneficial in caſes where a weak fibre, or poor and watery Blood are the true cauſes of the complaint, and ſuch caſes often do occur.</p>

               <p>That Tea affects the Nerves of the Stomach is evident, by its communicating diſagreeable Senſations upon the Soul. That the Soul becomes affected when the digeſtion of the Stomach is impaired, is alſo evident, ſo that the Soul cannot be anſwerable in that caſe, for Actions of the Body; for without the Nerves are braced up to the Standard of the Soul, it's ideas are imperfectly connected: ſo that it is clear, the Nerves operate upon the Soul, as the Works of a Clock regulate the Movement in keeping Time.</p>
               <p>That extreme ſenſibility to all Impreſſions, which render many ſo unhappy, ſhould be treated like diſorders of the Nerves, on which it depends, and often requires cold Baths, Milk diet, much exerciſe, and the courage to brave the open Air, and thoſe things which we moſt dread.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the Diſorder only exiſts in the Imagination. The vapouriſh perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they are not able to do any thing, when they are very ſtrong; they fancy every thing incommodious which they are very well able to bear; they deprive themſelves of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, all enjoyments, frighten themſelves with an unexiſting Bugbear, and court a real one. Such Caſes require the Phyſicians ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt penetration: If he is deluded, the Patient is loſt; but if he deceives the Patient, and gains
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0672201300:15"/>his confidence, a Cure is the work of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute. I have ſeen five ſuch Perſons, who fancied they could neither bear light, noiſe, air, or food, keep their Beds in a dark and matted Chamber, where none were ſuffer'd to walk, move, or ſpeak out, but with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt precaution; lived only on Broth and Jellies; thought themſelves dangerouſly ill, ſettled their Affairs, and all this while they were perfectly well: I compelled them to ſee, hear, ſpeak quit their Beds, and even their Houſe, to eat and act like other People, to feel themſelves well, and paſs in one quarter of an Hour from the greateſt Miſery to the greateſt Happineſs.</p>
               <p>We muſt be perſuaded the Nerves are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately affected by the Labours of the Soul: inactivity is alſo ſufficient to deſtroy them, and often produces this effect, even in Perſons whoſe mind is as indolent as their Body The Nerves are the principal parts of the Machine, whenever any of the Animal Functions are diſturbed, they muſt undoubtedly be injured.</p>
               <p>When the Nerves are affected without any ſenſible cauſe, one would be led to ſuppoſe, that ſome diſeaſe would ſoon appear, the ſource of which might poſſibly be diſcovered by attentive obſervation and be the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed before the diſeaſe had come to any height. Some diſorders, (of the Stomach
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0672201300:16"/>eſpecially) ſhew themſelves more readily by the effects they have on the Nerves; for they being a kind of Medium between the Soul and the Body, are expoſed to ſuffer from the irregularities of each, and communicate to the one, the injuries they receive from the other: thus it is that the Soul becomes prejudicial to the Body, and the Body hurtful to the Soul, and that they are both combined in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nervous Syſtem.</p>

               <p>LET us now conſider what is to be done to obtain a cure in Nervous Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, we are exactly to regulate the uſe of non-naturals; For in vain is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of medicines, if the Patient is not directed and willing to obſerve certain regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, in relation to Air, diet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Exerciſe. Chuſe a free open Air, not incumber'd with Hills or Woods A dry cool Air, braces and Invigorates the whole Body; while a Hot, confined, and damp Air, weakens and relaxes the Habit. When the Stomach and Bowels are weak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſhould be well guarded againſt cold and Damps eſpecially in Winter; and there is no dreſs better and more neceſſary to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0672201300:17"/>keep up a due perſpiration, than Flannels worn next the Skin.</p>
               <p>Conſtant exerciſe, every day that allows of it, either in walking, on horſe-back, or in an open Chaiſe, is of vaſt ſervice; it ſhould be as much as the ſtrength will admit, without weakneſs, fatigue or hurry; never weary yourſelf, nor raiſe a Sweat, go no further, than you can return with as much ſpirit as you went out. Exerciſe ſtrengthens the whole Nervous Syſtem, aſſiſts digeſtion, (but retards it after a full meal; therefore after dinner ſit a while) Sangnification, and the diſtribution and ſecretion of all the Animal Fluids. By muſcular motion, the blood and Juices are kept in a due ſtate of Fluidity; their Viſcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity is broken and diſſolved, and all obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions either prevented or removed. The fleſh Bruſh is an excellent thing for ſtrengthening the Solids; as friction, either with the fleſh bruſh, flannel or coarſe Linnen Cloth, ſtrengthens the Body, promotes the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is particularly uſeful in weak Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.</p>
               <p>People of weak Nerves are generally quick thinkers, from the delicacy of their ſenſitive organs, which we therefore more liable to be fatigued and relaxed with exerciſe, than thoſe of a Coarſer make; whence we ſee the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of keeping the mind eaſy, quiet and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0672201300:18"/>chearful, ſince nothing hurts Nervous People more, than fear, grief, and anxiety. Uſe therefore agreeable amuſements, and a little ſlight, entertaining and diverting reading, that requires no thought, for all Study is pernicious and hurtful. Converſation ſhould be agreeable trifling and eaſy, without diſpute or contradiction; amuſements be Innocent, various, and not expenſive: otherways, upon reflection, the money laid out would do more hurt, than the amuſements could recompence. In a word, all thought and care muſt be laid aſide; and rationality muſt give place for a while, to a way of life, which Bath gives a pattern of. I cannot but highly approve of a practice there, of having muſic, while the Patients drink the Water; which has a very great and good effect upon the motion of the finer animal Fibres. Muſic has been allow'd, in all ages of the world, to have a Noble pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in raiſing the dejected ideas of the Soul. Thoſe that have the moſt delicate conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are moſt ſenſible of its good effects; it opens the obſtructions of the fineſt Veſſels; aſſuages the paſſions, and at the ſame time communicates a pleaſure to the Soul, and makes its ideas chearful, gay and lively; by the oſcillatory motion of the Air, vibrating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tempanum of the ear, there is ſuch an impulſive motion given to the fineſt fibres
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0672201300:19"/>of the Brain, (upon which the Soul more immediately diſplays its Faculties) as to enable them to bring regular impulſes to the ſenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</p>
               <p>But muſic, though it reſtores the Tone of the fineſt Fibres of the Brain; yet the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or organs demand coarſer treatment, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them to the Standard of health</p>
               <p>We muſt abridge the Quantity and Quality of our food, which ought to be nouriſhing, eaſy of Digeſtion, and ſuited to the Stomach of the Patient. Fat meats, and heavy ſauces are hurtful; and all exceſs is to be avoided. The Patient ought never to eat more than the Stomach can eaſily digeſt: eat therefore little at a time, but often, of innocent, plain and ſimple meat; for every time the ſtomach is overloaded, the ſtrength is impaired, and its Nerves are diſordered.</p>
               <p>Above all things, heavy ſuppers ought to be avoided; ſince the ſtomach is much more apt to be oppreſſed with the ſame quantity of food, in an horizontal poſition, than in any erect poſture; and ſince the Digeſton goes on Slower in time of ſleep than when awake, as the veſſels are then much relaxed.</p>
               <p>It is a great bleſſing, that loathing, and want of appetite in ſome degree, attend all diſorders, which prevent many people from in fallibly and quickly ruining themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0672201300:20"/>reſource. Thoſe who have only a few tranſient ſymptoms, and are but in the firſt ſtage of Nervous Diſeaſes, ſhould live with a due degree of temperance ſuited to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and abate a little of the quantity of their food, while they are more immediately under the ſymptoms. Indeed, if the diſorder is deep, and hath continued ſo long as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce more violent ſymptoms, there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to be ſtill more careful. Drink ſmall Beer, ſoft fine ale, or Wine and water; but never uſe water alone. Wine in exceſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebles the Body, and impairs the faculties of the Soul; but a few glaſſes of wine, in time of eating, aſſiſt digeſtion. A Glaſs of wine before Dinner, on an empty Stomach, and when one is Languid, feeble or faint, is of great ſervice. Wine in general, is preferable to Malt Liquor; the beſt Wine is Rheniſh, Mountain, or ſmall French Wine. When the ſtomach and Bowels are troubled with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity, water mixed with Rum or Brandy, is preferable to Wine, or Malt Liquor. That too common drink Tea, is very hurtful to both the ſtomach and Nerves, eſpecially if drank hot, with little Bread: I would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recommend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not the diſuſe, but the more moderate uſe of Tea: it were, well, if ſomething elſe was Joined with it in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Or inſtead of Tea, which is almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0672201300:21"/>hurtful to the Neves, a Tea made of Balm and mint, in every diſh of which ſhould be put a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ea ſpoonful of the Balſamic mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Cream and Yolks of Eggs, with two or three drops of Oil of Cinnamon; which makes an agreeable Beverage, and is highly grateful to the ſtomach, as I have myſelf had occaſion to obſerve.</p>
               <p>But of all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the cold Bath is the greateſt ſtrengthener of the Nerves; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves glandular obſtructions, raiſes the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and vivifies and ſtrengthens the whole Man; for Children, delicate conſtitutions, and Women liable to miſcarriages, or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome floodings, nothing can be better. Cold Bathing. I am perſuaded, is analagous to the Bark, which is alſo a very proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, for it ſtrengthens the Stomach, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Nerves, and even the Soul itſelf, and enables them to ſupport freſh fatigues. I have known ſeveral young Perſons throw themſelves into the Cold Bath, after being wearied and depreſſed with Study, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways found upon coming out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a peculiar ſtrength of mind, and a freſh diſpoſition to Study. But I ſhall here obſerve, that where the Stomach, Liver, or other Viſcera are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, the Cold Bath is improper.</p>
               <p>That eminent Phyſician Mr Lewis, ſays, <q>"That of all Remedies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether external or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0672201300:22"/>internal, there is none can equal the virtue of the Cold Bath:—it cools the Body more, ſtrengthens the Nerves better, and promotes perſpiration more effectually than any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine taken down the throat can do."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The uſe of Bark and the Cold Bath toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is pointed out by the Nature of their Virtues; they produce the ſame Effects; and being combined will cure diſorders, which every other Remedy would only have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. Being ſtrengthening, ſedative, and febrifugal, they reinvigorate, diminiſh the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verous and Nervous heat, and calm the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular motions produced by the Spaſmodic diſpoſition of the Nervous Syſtem; they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify a weak Stomach, and quickly diſſipate its attendant pains. They reſtore Appetite, they facilitate digeſtion and nutrition: they promote all the functions, and particularly perſpiration, which render them ſo efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in all cata<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rhous and cutaneous diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in a word, they remove all diſorders occaſioned by weakneſs provided the Patient is not afflicted with indiſſoluble obſtructions, inflammations, or internal Ulcerous obſceſſes, which conditions almoſt neceſſarily exclude the Cold Bath, but which frequently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the Quinquina From my own experience, I can aſſure the Reader, that I have my ſelf plunged into the Cold Bath,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0672201300:23"/>when I have found my Spirits ſo depreſſed, that without the utmoſt exertion of a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reſolution, and being as it were ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaly aſſiſted. I could never have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Yet on coming out I have found my Nerves ſo Braced, and my ſpirits ſo ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, that in a manner I viewed an other and a Spiritual State, with ſuch extacy as made me ready and deſirous to enter into it. I ſhall here too further recite what I once met with at Margate in Kent, where the late King of Britain arrived from Germany, and uſed the Cold Bath, and drank the Waters with great Advantage which is expreſſed, by an inſcription on a ſtatue erected on purpoſe, in this manner.</p>
               <q>"Thy Baths give Vigour, and thy Waters Health."</q>
               <p>For altho' the Water only acts immediately on the Cutaneous Nerves and Veſſels, yet it's ſtrengthening power is, by ſympathy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the inmoſt parts of the Body, and mixes radically with the Fluids.</p>
               <p>Daily experience convinces us of the power of the Soul upon the Stomach. Thoſe moſt addicted to reflection, perform their Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with greater difficulty; on the contrary, thoſe who think little, generally digeſt well. We frequently ſee Perſons of weak under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings eat and drink very freely, without
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0672201300:24"/>ſuffering any inconvenience, although they lead ſedentary lives, and have not remarkably ſtrong conſtitutions. On the contrary, how many ſenſible Men do we ſee, whoſe Digeſtion is performed with much pain and difficulty, although they are of a good habit of Body, and uſe ſome exerciſe.</p>
               <p>The connection of the Soul with the Body is in fact ſo ſtrong, that it's even difficult to conceive how one of them ſhould act, and the other not be ſenſible, in a greater or a leſs degree, of that action. The Organs of Senſe being put in motion, convey the Subject of thought to the Mind, by acting on the Fibres of the Brain; and while the Soul is employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thinking, the parts of the Brain are in a greater or leſs forcible motion, and in a leſs or greater degree of tenſion. Theſe Motions fatigue the medullary or Nervous portion of the Brain; and this delicate ſubſtance, after a long courſe of Meditation, becomes as much exhauſted, as a ſtrong Man is after exerciſe. Whoever has thought intenſely, even once in his Life, muſt have experienced this in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: and there is certainly no very Studious Man, who has not often felt, on coming out of his Cloſet, violent pains in his head, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a great degree of heat in this part. This heat will depend on the proportion of wearineſs and inflammatory tenſion, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0672201300:25"/>the medullary ſubſtance has undergone: the eyes ſoon become ſenſible of this fatigue; and if we conſider a Man who is deeply engaged in thought, we ſhall ſee that the Muſcles of his Face are all upon the ſtretch, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appear even convulſed.</p>
               <p>A great Author has taken notice of the Danger of fixing the Attention too ſtrongly. <q>"When the Action of the Soul is too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful," ſays he, "it attacks the Body ſo violently, that it throws it into a conſuming State: if the Soul exerts itſelf in a peculiar manner, on certain occaſions, the Body is made ſenſible of it, and becomes heated and debilitated."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another Author of note has obſerved the ſame, and ſays; <q>"The union of the Soul with the Body is ſo intimate that they, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally ſhare the good or evil which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to either of them. The Mind or Soul cannot put forth its powers, when the body is tired with immoderate exerciſe: and too cloſe an application to ſtudy deſtroys the Body, by diſſipating the Animal ſpirits, which are neceſſary to recruit it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The brain, which is the immediate ſeat of theſe emotions, the nerves which ariſe from it, and the Stomach, which is furniſhed with many nerves of an exquiſite ſenſation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are the parts firſt attacked, and commonly moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0672201300:26"/>by the immoderate labour of the mind; but if it ſhould continue for any length of time almoſt all the parts of the body become partakers of the injury.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſymptoms which indicate a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Nervous Syſtem, are a kind of puſillanimity we were before ſtrangers to; Diffidence, fear, grief, dejection and Diſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs: he who was the moſt intrepid man now becomes the moſt timorous; the ſlighteſt undertaking frightens him, the moſt trifling unforſeen incident makes him tremble; the ſlighteſt indiſpoſition appears to him a fatal diſeaſe; and the idea of Death fills him with intolerable horrors. Some Tyrants have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned certain Philoſophers, whom they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to death, but have never been able to make them fear it; how much more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally would their cruelty have been exerciſed if by ſuffering them ſtill to Live, they could have inſpired them with thoſe fears of Death hypochondriacs are tormented with? We ſee inſtances every day of men of Learning, who perceiving the firſt ſigns of this diſtemper, have been obliged to forſake their favourite ſtudies; whoſe Nerves being weakened, they become incapable of attention; their memory fails: their Ideas are confuſed; a Senſation of heat in the Head, palpitations, a total dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0672201300:27"/>and the apprehenſion of death makes the pen fall from their hands.</p>
               <p>The injury the mind has done the Body ſoon recoils upon itſelf; for it has been the will of the ſupreme Being, that as long as theſe two Subſtances continued together, the labours of the mind ſhould in a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree depend upon the health of the Body: this truth has been ever acknowledged. An Author has emphatically declared, that <q>"the props of the Body ſupported the Soul," And that, "Health increaſes the powers of the mind; when the body is diſeaſed the mind is not capable of reflection"</q> It is not therefore ſurpriſing that the mind ſhould be weakened, after it has exhauſted the Brain and Debilitated the Nerves.</p>
               <p>An Eminent Phyſician who lived long in a City where learning is much cultivated, ſays, That ſtudy begins by impairing the Stomach and that if the complaint is not relieved, it may degenerate into a melancholy. And that a vitiated Stomach attends Learned People, as ſurely as the ſhadow follows the Body. That he has ſeen Patients who ſuffered for this immoderate thirſt of Learning, firſt by a loſs of appetite, an entire inability of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting Powers, and a total debility which enſued; afterwards they have been tormented
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0672201300:28"/>with ſpaſms, convulſions and at length with a total privation of all their ſenſes.</p>
               <p>When the Digeſtion is imperfect, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours imbibe a crude quality, which renders them unfit for their various deſtinations; and which particularly prevents Nutrition, upon which the reparation of all the Powers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. To be convinced of the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Stomach, it is only neceſſary to obſerve the State of a Perſon who labours under a difficult Digeſtion; the Powers are loſt in a few minutes, a general uneaſineſs makes the weakneſs more inſupportable, the Organs of Senſe are benumbed, the faculties of the Soul are exerciſed very imperfectly, the Memory, and particularly the Imagination, ſeems to be annihilated; in a word, nothing makes a ſenſible Man ſo much reſemble an Idiot, as the difficulty of Digeſtion. This Obſervation equally points out to us, that of all Diſorders, there are none which more quickly affect the Soul, than thoſe of the Nervous Syſtem.</p>
               <p>There is one general precaution, which is, to refrain from all Liquors in great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; they weaken Digeſtion, by relaxing the Stomach, drowning the degeſtive Juices, and by precipitating the Aliments before they are digeſted: they relax all the parts, diſſolve the humours, excite making Water, or draining
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0672201300:29"/>Sweats. I have ſeen diſorders occaſioned by Weakneſs conſiderably diminiſhed without any remedy, but the mere retrenching of the quantity of Liquor the Patient uſually Drunk.</p>
               <p>We know, that an unnatural State of the Nerves of the Stomach may either produc a craving or an averſion to food; that low Spirits and Melancholy often proceed from that cauſe: nor is it to be doubted, that when the Nerves of the Stomach are, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cauſes, affected in a manner ſomewhat different, an indifference for food, a weak Digeſtion, a languor and coldneſs, a ſlow Pulſe, and waſting, may be the conſequences. By proper food, the Nerves of the Stomach are gratefully ſtimulated, and the whole Body is thence enlivened and ſtrengthened; ſo that, beſides its uſe for nutrition, food in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach becomes, altogether neceſſary in ſome delicate Nervous People, for keeping up the ſtrength of the Body, and the due exerciſe of all its ſuctions. The morbid affection of the Nerves of the Stomach, by ſympathy, impairs the Vigour and energy of the whole ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid in Holy Write, <q>"That where much is given, much will be required"</q> May I preſume then to put a Queſtion, which I wiſh to do without giving offence to God or the world. How it has happened in all ages,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0672201300:30"/>That men of the greateſt ſenſibility of Soul, ſhould be endued with ſuch delicate Nerves, as pervert the mental Faculties and prevent the Soul from exerting its nobleſt Powers, to ſhine and illuminate in contemplation of the Works of God?</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this Section with Dr Chene's obſervation, in his Engliſh Malady, the reading of which, ſtrikes the Human Mind with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: <q>"But of all the miſeries that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts human Life, (ſays that Eminent Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician) and which principally relate to the Body, in this Valley of Tears, I think Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous diſorders, in their extreme and laſt Degree, beyond all compariſon the worſt."</q> It was the obſervation of a Great Man, that he had ſeen perſons labouring under the Gout, Stone, Cancer and every other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, which could tear the Human Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine.

Like an unballaſted bark in a troubled Ocean, it becomes the ſport of Winds and tides; and without the aid of Religion, Reaſon, and Philoſophy, is in continual danger of being ſwallowed up and loſt.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, however, very few can properly be ſaid to die of old age merely; for even the Life of Old Parr might probably have been ſtill prolonged, had he not changed his Air and manner of Living.</p>
               <p>Here we may obſerve, that by a kind of Fatal Neceſſity, Animal Bodies are worn out and deſtroyed by that very cauſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes the principles of Life, namely, the circulating power of the Blood; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that the number of years to which man may attain, will probably be in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Velocity of the Pulſe: If ſo, it will then follow, that ſuch a particular ſtate of the Conſtitution as produces the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0672201300:33"/>of ſtrength and vigour in youth, is not moſt likely to prolong Life, that thoſe of weak ſolids, and delicate habits in their early ſtate. grow old more ſlowly than others; and if the Viſcera is ſound, become for a time, more ſtrong and Healthy from the effect of Age</p>
               <p>The diſorders produced by the efforts of the mind fall ſooneſt upon ſuch as are inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly engaged in the contemplation of one object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <q>"Study (ſays Mr Rouſſeau) makes men tender, weakens their Conſtitution, and when once the Body has loſt its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, thoſe of the ſoul are not eaſily preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

               </p>
               <p>The whole Body becomes hard in proceſs of time, and old age itſelf is a general indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. In labouring Men, thoſe parts moſt uſed in their reſpective employmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In Children the Brain is too ſoft in old Perſons too hard, and in the two extremes it is equally unfit to communicate the Oſcillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0672201300:34"/>exerted by thinking. Galen has rightly obſerved, that our memory fails firſt, and forebodes the weakening of our reaſon The Nerves are not the only parts affected by deep thinking, for, as Gunzius has obſerved, the wearineſs of the eyes is alone ſufficient to produce Nervous diſeaſes, There is no one but muſt have experienced, as I have often done, how much the head is weakened by long attention of the ſight. If after a Fever or other Indiſpoſition, it ſhould happen to me, before my ſtrength is well recruited to fix my eyes for a long time on any Object, I am immediately ſeized with Giddineſs, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at ſtomach, and my whole Body ſuffers a painful Senſation of being fatigued and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted</p>
               <p>If ſuch are the Injuries brought on the Conſtitution by irregularity and exceſs of the Paſſions, it ought to be the care of every Rational Being, to guard againſt their inſults, and to oppoſe their Effects with becoming reſolution, and a Virtuous Reſignation to the Will of Providence.</p>
               <p>Happineſs and Miſery are the Lights and Shades which fill up the out-lines in the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait of Human Life Every Man naturally endeavours to attain the one, and avoid the other; but by very different means, which are often diſproportioned to that end.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0672201300:35"/>
               <p>We frequently deceive ourſelves, both in the purſuit and enjoyment of our wiſhes. Extravagance of Hope often ends in diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; and even a conſtant Series of pleaſurable Events will at laſt loſe their power. To give them true reliſh, and make them laſting, the mind muſt refer to ſome former painful ſenſations.</p>
               <p>Thus a Perſon who always poſſeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d Health, is ſcarce ſenſible of its value; but when loſt, let it again return, and he will bleſs the means which reſtored it. None enjoy Riches ſo much as thoſe who have been at great pains to attain them: He who always was affluent, has no competent idea of Indigence, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt ſuch a State, or exalt his enjoyment. Were, our exquiſite pleaſures too laſting, they would lay ſo much ſtreſs on the vital powers of the Body, as would ſoon wear it out. Every extreme, therefore, corrects itſelf; and every Evil works its own cure.</p>
               <p>If the violent Paſſions harrow up the Soul, and diſturb its union with the Body, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience pure and uncorrupted, the ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reward of Virtue, will beſt reconcile them to each other, and cauſe them to dwell in harmony: That will always ſpeak peace to the Mind, whatever the World may ſay, and ſhield it from the impotent attacks of ſlander and abuſe. Whoever is over ſolicitous about
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0672201300:36"/>Cenſure, Fame, or the poſſeſſion of temporal Enjoyments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will ſeldom find repoſe: an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratious look from his ſuperiors, or unmerit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſolence from thoſe below him, will vex and diſcompoſe him. If he is anxious for long life; a Coffin or ſhroud, the apparatus of Death, will alarm and appal his ſenſes; whilſt he who diſpenſes with unavoidable ills with a Philoſphic indifference, who is neither weary of living or affraid to die, will find within himſelf an inexpreſſible, and perpetual calm.</p>
               <p>By giving way to ſorrow, or anger, they at laſt become habitual and reign triumphant: In a word, the government of the paſſions is as eſſential towards preventing diſeaſes of the mind, as Temperance contributes to hinder them attacking the Body.</p>
               <p>That man ought to be deemed richeſt, who is the happieſt; and he is the moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to become ſo, who, with a virtuous reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is prepared for the unavoidable evils which fleſh is heir to; who expoſtulates with the folly and extravagance of his own deſires, and though a hard taſk, at laſt convinces him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that what he likes beſt. is not always beſt for him; who preſerves at all times, a decent equality of mind, is not arrogantly elated with the deluſive ſmiles of Proſperity, nor ſervily caſt down by the ſurly viſage of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0672201300:37"/>
               <p>The Organs of the Body may be entirely unfit to be acted upon by the Soul, when it remains wrapped up in itſelf, like a criminal in a Dungeon. Some people are born with imperfect nerves, which are ſtopt up, and never all their lives, unfold themſelves, and ſhake off the Clog of Matter which obſtruct them.</p>
               <p>Though the Soul has a power over the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary motions of the Body, in a healthy ſtate; yet when the Body is diſeaſed or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly formed, the operation of the Soul then is irregular.</p>
               <p>Even the ſtrength of the Conſtitution is itſelf dangerous. Young people of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Conſtitutions, apply themſelves to ſtudy with indefatigable induſtry; the powerful action of the Soul increaſes that of the Organs, and they are attacked with inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory diſeaſes, the consequence of irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation long kept up in vigorous habits. Sometimes they expire in the firſt attack; more commonly they get the better of that; and if they find themſelves perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, their conſtitution recovering its vigour, they give themſelves up again to the ſame labours, and relapſe into the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. There are frequent inſtances of ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt young men cloſe applying to ſtudy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are attacked with inflammatory fevers every
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0672201300:38"/>year; at laſt, in proceſs of time, being worn out by theſe attacks and by their labours, they loſe their ſtrength, and are ſeized with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive diſeaſes, againſt which they are no longer able to reſiſt.</p>
               <p>Health is frequently deſtroyed by exceſſive devotion. An Author has collected ſeveral intereſting obſervations on this head, in which devout Melancholy is well delineated; its ſymptoms are very unaccountable, alarming, and grievous; and there are few practitioners who have not had opportunities of ſeeing ſome ſhocking inſtances of this diſeaſe. The greatneſs and excellence of the object, and the ſatisfaction the Soul experiences in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſelf up to the contemplation of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, excites too lively a Senſation, and produces in the Brain, attention too violent and too continual, to be ſupported for a long time together without Injury; it ſoon throws the ſoul into fanatical madneſs, and exhauſts the Body. Some moſt amiable young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, led away by an erronious Syſtem, fade and fall into decay, neglecting the duties of their calling, in order to give their thoughts up wholly to the ſupreme Author of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ng, who could not have been more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly glorified than by a ſtrict Attention to thoſe duties. A Student is ſtill regrated, One of the greateſt abilities, born with ſtrong
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0672201300:39"/>powers of the mind, whoſe candour and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Virtues would have been an acquiſition to the Church; But who unfortunately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted himſelf to a ſect, of which he ſoon was the victim, the powers of his Body decaying as faſt as his mind became more zealouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed.</p>
               <p>Sometimes even the moſt lucky thoughts ariſe in the midſt of recreation. One of the greateſt Geniuſes of our age computed his immortal works walking about in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Soul unfolds itſelf in open Air, but is impriſoned within the confined walls of a Study; it is elevated by the fragrance of Flowers, depreſſed by the ſmell of a Lamp. Plutarch's compariſon on this ſubject is very juſt and excellent: "A little water," (ſays he,) "nouriſhes and ſtrengthens "Plants; and a greater quantity ſtifles them." Thus it is with the mind; moderate labour is its food; exceſſive labour deſtroys it. When activity was mentioned as the ſecond cauſe of the diſorders here treated of, exerciſe was certainly repreſented at the ſame time, as one of the moſt powerful preſervatives and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorers of the health of the Learned.</p>
               <p>In the foregoing article, the advantages of open air have been conſidered, theſe are greatly enhanced, if accompanied with ſome degree of motion. The Learned in general,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0672201300:40"/>are not ſufficiently convinced of the influence the Body has on the Soul, although it was well known to our greateſt men, who have been ſenſible that the Mind was ſubject to the powers of Phyſic as well as the Body, <q>"The Soul, ſays Des Cartes, is ſo much influenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Conſtitution, and the State of the Bodily Organs, that if it were poſſible to find out a method of encreaſing our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration, it ſhould certainly be ſought for in Medicine."</q> Walking alone is very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, but not quite ſufficient; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too much recommended to them to ride out frequently on Horſe-back; this kind of exerciſe is of uſe to the Head, the Breaſt, and the Viſcera of the lower Belly, eſpecially by preventing or diſpelling their obſtructions.</p>
               <p>The hypocondriac diſeaſe may alſo be reckoned among the Evils learned Men are expoſed to, from that kind of inactive life, which diſturbing the circulation in the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominal Viſcera, produces obſtructions in them.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0672201300:41"/>ſingle one. To what a wretched condition are the beſt of Men often reduced by it! Their ſtrength and appetite fail; a perpetual gloom hangs over their minds; they live in the conſtant dread of death, and are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in ſearch of relief from Medicine, where, alas! it is not to be found.</p>
               <p>Thoſe moſt liable to this Diſeaſe, are the Virtuous, the Valiant, the Brave, and thoſe of an enlarged underſtanding, whom it would be the intereſt of the world to wiſh, they were free from that and every other illneſs; and except for that alloy, they would have too large a ſhare of human happineſs. To this we owe the irrepareable loſs of Doctor Young, and the beſt and moſt approved Men that have appeared among us.</p>
               <p>Hypochandriac perſons ought never to faſt long, and their food ſhould be ſolid and nouriſhing, all aceſcent and windy vegetables are to be avoided. Fleſh meats agree beſt with them, and their drink ſhould be old Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret or generous Madeira.</p>
               <p>In all perſons afflicted with Nervous diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, there is a great, delicacy and ſenſibility of the whole Nervous Syſtem, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common degree of weakneſs of the Organs of digeſtion. Theſe may be either natural or acquired. When owing to a defect in the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0672201300:42"/>Conſtitution, they are hardly to be removed; but may be mitigated by proper care.</p>
               <p>But Nervous Affections ariſe more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from cauſes which it is, in a great meaſure, in our power to avoid, than from Diſeaſes, or any Original fault in the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Exceſſive grief. intenſe Study, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper diet, and neglect of Exerciſe, are the great Sources of this extenſive Claſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
               <p>Grief indulged deſtroys the appetite and digeſtion depreſſes the ſpirits. and induces an univerſal relaxation and debility of the whole Syſtem. Inſtances of this are daily to be ſeen. The loſs of a relation, or any other misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in Life, is often ſufficient to occaſion the moſt complicated ſeries of Nervous ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms Such misfortunes indeed are not to be avoided, but ſurely their effects, by a vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and proper exertion of the mind, might be renderd leſs hurtful. The effects of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe Study are pretty ſimilar to thoſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by Grief. It preys upon the Animal Spirits, and deſtroys the appetite and digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on To prevent theſe effects, ſtudious Perſons ought, according to the Poet, O<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0672201300:43"/>poſture, and ſhould take care frequently to unbend their minds by muſic, diverſions, or agreeable Company.</p>
               <p>With regard to Diet, I ſhall only obſerve that Nervous diſeaſes may be occaſioned either by exceſs or inanition, both theſe extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes hurt digeſtion, and vitiate the humours.</p>
               <p>But the moſt general cauſe of Nervous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders is Indolence. The active and laborious are ſeldom troubled with them They are reſerved for the Children of eaſe and afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who generally feel their keeneſt force. All I ſhall ſay to ſuch Perſons is, that the means of prevention and cure are both in their own power. If the Conſtitution of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature be ſuch, that man muſt either labour or ſuffer diſeaſes. ſurely, no individual has any right to expect an exemption from the general rule.</p>
               <p>If the ſtomach is bad, either naturally or from errors in diet, this Organ will be affected by the exerciſe of the mind, while the Nerves ſhall remain in a ſound ſtate; on the contrary, if the Nervous Syſtem is weak, and the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach ſtrong, Nervous diſeaſes of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, will be brought on before the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is Injured.</p>
               <p>A fit of Illneſs, undigeſted food, or any ſimilar cauſe often occaſions broken uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected dreams, and prevents our receiving the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0672201300:44"/>ariſing from ſound ſleep; the reaſon of which probably is, the fermentation and diſcordance of the nutritive juices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> incapacitating our ſenſes or organs (thro' which the ſoul is empowred to act) from being in a perfect ſtate of reſt, the ſoul muſt consequently partake of that irregular and unconnected quality, by which the bodily organs are at that juncture actuated: But in Death the caſe is quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed; the Soul, inſtead of being Clogg'd up and embarraſſed by Bodily impediments is abſolutely and entirely freed from them; for we cannot ſuppoſe it is longer confined to Nerves and Arteries, which there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of its ever making any further uſe of, ſuch a ſuppoſition muſt be ridiculous: So that in ſleep the Soul's ſituation is directly contrary to what it muſt be in death; in the firſt caſe it is by material influence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from exerting its powers, whereas in Death, that is, on its enlargement from its Material body it finds itſelf for the firſt time at full Liberty, and in full power of expanding and exerting them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
               <p>It is evident that Virtue and Vice are not Conſtitutional, and dependent on any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular habit of Body, and tho' our material part, has an influence over the ſoul, in regard to the exertion of its Faculties, yet that influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0672201300:45"/>extends only to the enlarging or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting our intellectual faculties, and not to our making a good or ill uſe of thoſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that reſt ſolely in Ourſelves, and if we make a wrong uſe of that power; if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturalize ourſelves, as I may ſay, by deviat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Paths of Virtue, whom are we to blame? The Deity who has formed us as we ſhould be, or ourſelves, who with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful hand, rejected the opportunity he has given us of attaining virtue, and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, eternal felicity?</p>
               <p>Are we not aſſured too, by the Deity, that according to our different abilities, ſituation, various contingencies &amp;c we ſhall hereafter be judged? Our actions will be ſcrutaniz'd in proportion to the talents entruſted to us, and according to the opportunities and incitements we have had, to make uſe of them and not taken in that ſuperficial light, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals look on them: It is not thoſe who have the greateſt ſhare of, but thoſe who make the beſt uſe of their moral and intellectual powers, who will be regarded hereafter; juſtice and goodneſs are the Deity's Attributes, and by them we are hereafter to be judged: As to Idiots, &amp;c who (like the Brute Creation) are under the dominion of matter, at leaſt, have as little power of exerting their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Deity's Juſtice will hardly expect
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0672201300:46"/>from them duties, which it is impoſſible they ſhould perform. What uſe they and many more beings are of in the Creation we know not; but let us not, ſhort ſighted as we are, for that reaſon arraign Divine wiſdom: We are ſure every part of the Creation was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd for ſome wiſe purpoſe, tho' to what end we are perhaps ignorant; And in regard to the diversity of power, talents, &amp;c. which we obſerve among men, ſo far from being a blemiſh, they are a great proſ of the Deity's Wiſdom: Inſtead of their being the cauſe of confuſion it is on that, the link which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports all, chiefly depends: was it otherways, half the omnipotent's Power and goodneſs on earth, would have been in vain.</p>
               <p>We may aſſure ourſelves, That Death, (which is indeed but the Souls Birth) inſtead of being a gloomy Meſſenger, is in reality our beſt Friend, ſince by his means we ſhall be freed from the fetters of the fleſh, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into a ſtate of freedom, Knowledge, and (I hope) Happineſs, where our intellect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual Powers will have full ſcope: where we ſhall he all Ethereal Senſe, and capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Joys which in our preſent ſtate we can have no conception of: as Swans are ſaid to ſing melodiouſly before Death, from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of ſome extraordinary Good approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo ſhould good men rejoice on their

I own I often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the thought, and am never ſo happy as when I am thus, as it were, anticipating eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; beſides, nothing contributes ſo much to cheerfulneſs, Religion, Humanity and all the ſocial virtues, as the contemplation and hopes of a futurity; whereas to the contrary opinion, is ever united a melancholy which rankles within us, which preys upon our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and which by diveſting us or all fears of a future Judgment, encourages Vice; and too often induces us to give ſuch a looſe to our paſſions as makes us incapable of Happineſs either in this world, or the world to come.</p>
               <p>And for the Good and Virtuous, the cauſe of their Immortality is continually
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0672201300:48"/>creaſing even in this world: The longer they exiſt, the more they improve in Knowledge and virtue and conſequently, the more they merit an Eternity. We might as well ſuppoſe, the Deity ſhould annihilate Angels, and other ſuperior Beings, as the Souls of Virtuous Men. When we moſt pleaſe him, to imagine we ſhall be moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed by him, were abſurd; and ſurely to the virtuous and happy, Annihilation muſt be the moſt dreadful of Puniſhments. The Immateriality of the Soul implies too, that it is a Subſtance incorruptible and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable and conſequently eternal, unleſs it ſhall pleaſe the Deity to annihilate it; and can we ſuppoſe, that Truth and Goodneſs, which are emanations from the Divine Creator, will not eternally exiſt?</p>
               <p>Every part of the Creation evinces, in the moſt ſtriking characters, the Exiſtence of a Deity; and becauſe we are not acquainted with the Nature and Eſſence of the Deity, ſhall we for that reaſon alone, doubt there is a Deity?</p>
               <p>The Caſe is the ſame in all immaterial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; nor is it poſſible for us to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a nearer intimacy with them, while we are confined to this bodily priſon, where, as I before obſerved, we can have no diſtinct idea
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0672201300:49"/>of any thing but what is material, ſince all our perceptions are the effects of material impulſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and conveyed through material Organs to the Soul. The human underſtanding is limited to every human boundaries How many things are there, even in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Creation, which ſeem myſterious, and are kept from us? Yet this ſhould not give us the leaſt uneaſiness, ſince what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is available to our happineſs here, or hereafter, is laid open to us. The knowledge of a Deity, and the Soul's exiſtence, are truths abſolutely neceſſary to make us happy and virtuous.</p>
               <p>It is worth obſerving, That we are aſſured in Scripture, —<q>"Angels and other ſpiritual Beings, neither Marry, nor are given in Marriage:"</q> They all have one common Parent, The Almighty.</p>
               <p>Our Bodies, like all other material ſyſtems are not deſigned for eternal duration, are ever variable, and ſo ordered, as to ſtand in need of daily recruits of Food, Sleep, &amp;c.: During our ſleep, a ſwoon, or any ſimilar cauſe, the Soul being embarraſſed and clogged up, as it were, is in a ſtate of Deliquium at leaſt, if it does think, its actions are ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous, as not to be traced in our waking hours notwithſtanding which, we are not to ſuppoſe that the Soul is in reality more defective then,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0672201300:50"/>than at another time; but the Organs, thro' which it is obliged to act, being obſtructed, its faculties are conſequently impeded. If we loſe our Eye-fight Or hearing, the Soul is not in the leaſt maimed thereby, it has but loſt its Inſtrument or Bodily Organ, its original power is ſtill the ſame; and were our optical or auditory Organs reduced to order, the Soul would again re-exert its uſual Faculties.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>"Thus," as an Author obſerves, the Muſician cannot, if his Inſtrument be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd, bring forth any harmony; his ſkill, nevertheleſs, remains; which, on the Inſtrument's being re-put in order, he again exhibits."</q> Idiotiſm, Forgetfulneſs, Dot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, &amp;c. are not Weakneſſes of the Soul, but of the Senſes; and we are not to ſuppoſe, our Immaterial Principle, in ſuch caſes, loſes its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, more than the Sun loſes his meridian brightneſs, when hid from us, by dark clouds intervening. Thus, during Sleep, which is abſolutely neceſſary to the refreſhment of our Bodily part, we muſt ſuppoſe, there is ſuch a relaxation of our material Organs, that our whole Syſtem becomes too languid for the Soul to be capable of exerting its Active fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; but when the Body is recruited with proper ſtrength, the Soul recovers its priſtine power; it again dictates to, and governs the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0672201300:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>Body, and we may perceive it is the ſame thinking Principle, the very ſame Soul that actuated us before Sleep. Matter cannot diveſt the Soul of its faculties, though it can render it impoſſible for it to exert them upon the Body; which may be diſordered ſo, as not to be directed by it. The Soul's Faculties then are not annihilated, but ſuſpended from Action: or to ſpeak more properly, are wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in itſelf. A Being may undoubtedly exiſt, without giving appearance of its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The Soul, therefore, may exiſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving ſigns of its exiſtence, or affecting Matter, ſo as to be conſcious of its own exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: as in ſleep, without dreaming, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the ſame invariable eſſence; though the Indiſpoſition of the Bodily Organs renders it impoſſible to diſplay thoſe faculties, from whence thought and reflection come.</p>
               <p>The Soul h impaſſible, conſequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of change: all the changes that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to an individual, ariſe from the different affections of the Bodily Organs. The Soul of a new-born Child is the ſame as that of an Old Man; and that of a Fool, as that of a Philoſopher.</p>
               <p>The Bodily Organs, on Which the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Soul depend, greatly vary; by which, the exerciſe of its Faculties are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably leſſened or improved: but it's
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0672201300:52"/>particular exiſtence, faculties and powers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the ſame, impaſſible to the Laws of Matter and Motion. The difference between the loweſt and moſt abject, and the higheſt and moſt elevated natural capacity, depends upon the Inſtruments by which the Soul acts, and is affected; which ſeem to us to alter its operations. The cauſe is in the Material Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, which make repreſentations of its oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, according to their juſt or imperfect Mechaniſm. If the Bodily Organs happen to be perfectly Organized, and exactly modu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to receive and convey to the Senſorium or Seat of the Soul, the ideas of Objects, with a proper impulſe, then it exerts its faculties in a reaſonable manner: the Senſes receive a juſt or ſufficient degree of impulſe from the Objects; which impulſe the Organs convey, in a juſt and ſufficient degree, which excites in the Soul, the diſtinct idea of the object.</p>
               <p>The brighteſt Wits, the moſt exalted Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, may be reduced to a level with the moſt abject, ſtupid, and unintelligent Fool. By the Mechanical Affections of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Motion, we often ſee a Man of the brighteſt parts, and moſt enlarged under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, who hath penetrated into the ſecret receſſes of nature, deſpoiled of all his Wiſdom and noble endowments, by the tyranny of a violent Nervous Fever, &amp;c. Thus we behold
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0672201300:53"/>him now diveſted of the exerciſe of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. But can we ſuppoſe this change made in the Soul itſelf? No: certainly it remains the ſame, and differs not from what it was before. Recover him from the Fever, &amp;c. and remove the impediment it hath thrown upon the Organs of the Senſes, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of all the Faculties of the Soul returns; his Parts brighten, his underſtanding revives, and, in ſhort, he becomes in every reſpect, the ſame amiable Perſon as he was, before the Fever, &amp;c ſeized him.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, that the Bodily Organs may be ſo diſorder'd, or the Stimulus, applied to them, ſo great, as to put it out of the Soul's power to ſuſpend or contract them; and tho' it is the ſource of all motion, both voluntary and involuntary, yet it may be reduced to an Inactive paſſive State, or forced into involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Action.</p>
               <p>Though all voluntary Motion proceeds from the immediate influence of the Soul, yet ſome of the voluntary motions, by the force of cuſtom and habit, come at length to be performed with little or no attention of the Soul, tho' it has full power to begin or ſtop the Motion when it pleaſes. Thus a Man may Walk, and not be ſenſible of it; have an Object before him, without ſeeing it; and put his hand to a Thing, without feeling
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0672201300:54"/>it; becauſe he is intent upon ſomething elſe, therefore overlooks theſe ſmaller ſenſations; and theſe voluntary motions are, in ſome degree, mechanically performed.</p>
               <p>I believe it will be allowed, that our Ideas or thoughts are immaterial; that is, are not bodily ſubſtances. Who ever thought there was any thing corporeal in a Judgement, a Doubt, &amp;c? If our Thoughts are corporeal, where could they be lodged? How infinitely complicated and extended muſt that material Soul be, to be able to contain thoſe immenſe volumes of learning, which ſome Men have treaſured up in their Souls.</p>
               <p>The large ſize, the wonderful texture, great care and ſecurity, the God of Nature has employed about the Brain, make it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable, that it is deſigned for the nobleſt uſes:—the Temple, Tabernacle, or Dwelling Houſe of That <hi>Immaterial Being,</hi> That <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Gueſt,</hi> I hat That <hi>Spark of the Deity,</hi> That <hi>Breath of Life,</hi> THE LIVING SOUL or MAN.</p>
               <p>Every thing we ſay or do, our every Action and Thought, proves and aſcertains the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soul: the very doubting its Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is a ſtrong proof of it. Whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Power of Doubting? It is evident, that the particles of matter of which our Bodies are formed were not long ſince life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0672201300:55"/>vegitative Particles, for which we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the Fields that nouriſh'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them, and which are but tranſplanted, as it were, into another ſoil: Theſe particles of matter, tho' differently modified and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a moſt ſurprizing piece of mechaniſm, are in reality (as to their original power and nature) the ſame, and as incapable of thought, ſelf motion &amp;c. as when growing in the Field, Matter, it is true, by a proper modification, may become a fit dwelling for Thinking Being; what then ſhall we call that Principle within us which doubts, which reflects, which dictates to us, and ſways us in every Action of Life? What is it that endows us with the power of ſelf-motion, which enables to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect paſt actions, to look forward into fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, and in a manner, to foretel future conſequences? It is certainly ſomewhat of a Different nature from the lifeleſs particles of which our Bodies are formed: it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, which, tho' we cannot rightly define, we are ſure is ſomewhat; and this it is we call, THE SOUL.</p>
               <p>While the Body is kept in order, the Soul is eaſy; when it is not, the Soul is in pain. When the functions of the Body ceaſe, the Soul quits the Aſſociation, but exiſts in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate ſtate. For as every particle of the body (however transformed) will remain after the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0672201300:56"/>ſeparation, ſo will the Soul alſo; for whatever has once received a Being from God, cannot ceaſe to be without his interpoſition. We are told in Scripture, That man is made after God's own Image. Now, as the Deity cannot be ſuppoſed a material Being, what can it imply but that our Being like him, is an Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Immortal ſubſtance, endowed with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Reflection, and the power of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between good and evil &amp;c It is, it muſt be owned a very bold Eaſtern Metaphor, as the difference and diſtance between us is ſo Inexpreſſible.</p>
               <p>In deſcribing the Bliſs of Immortal Beings, we have while in this life, no ideas more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive than thoſe which depend on the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſeeing and hearing, which ſenſes ſeem principally deſigned for the ſervice of our immortal Part, and may be call'd vehicles for the Soul's Food, as thoſe of taſting, ſmelling and feeling, are deſigned purely for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's uſe. After Death, the Soul will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, be gifted with many powers and inlets to happineſs, or miſery, which we at preſent can have no idea of.</p>
               <p>It has been a received opinion in all ages, that immenſity ſwarms with inviſible imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Beings, who are the Agents of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and witneſſes of our moſt private ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0672201300:57"/>
               <p>The thought of our exiſtance terminating with this Life naturally checks the Soul in any generous purſuit, contracts her views, and fixes them on temporary and ſelfiſh ends; It dethrones the reaſon, extinguiſhes all noble and heroic Sentiments; encourages Luſt, Fraud, Violence, and all kind of Vice, by which, a Man may wickedly make his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or indulge a pleaſure without fear of temporal damage, either in Reputation, Health, or Fortune: In ſhort, the inward compunctions of a wicked, as well as the joys of an upright mind, are grafted on the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of another ſtate.</p>
               <p>Hence ariſe the natural Hopes and fears of men; hence ſpring the means of future rewards, and appearing pleaſing to the Deity, tho' perſecuted in this world, and likewiſe the inward ſtings of Conſcience and dread of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment attending proſperous Vice, tho' hid from Human eyes.</p>
               <p>As it is probable that there may be differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Degrees of happineſs for Souls, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as they have been more or leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it is as probable too, that in thoſe ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Souls will be furniſhed with opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of eternally improving in Virtue and knowlege, and conſequently of increaſing in happineſs; notwithſtanding, which gradation to perfection, they moſt ever remain infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Arethmeticians have figures to compute all the progreſſions of time; Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers have inſtruments to calculate the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Plannets; but what numbers can ſtate, what Lines gauge, the lengths and breadths of Eternity?

Yea, when ages, numerous as the bloom of Spring; encreaſed by the Herbage of Summer, both augmented by the Leaves of Autumn, and all multiplied by the drops of rain, which drown the Winter—when theſe, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand more—more than can be repreſented by any ſimilitude, or imagined by any conception—

Moſt reviving Cordial! equally beneficial to our Animal and intellectual powers: It ſupplies the fleſhly machine, and keeps all its nice Movements in a proper poſture for eaſy play: It animates the think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculties with freſh Alacrity, and rekindles their Ardour for the Studies of the Dawn; without theſe enlivening recruits, how ſoon would the moſt robuſt conſtitution be waſted into a walking Skeleton, and the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sage degenerate into a Hoary Idiot.</p>
                  <p>"How many of our Fellow creatures are, at this very Inſtant, confined to the bed of lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhing, and complaining with that illuſtrious
