            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was not many Days ago that I wrote you a Letter upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your Comedy now upon the point of being acted at <hi>Drury-lane</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre. As I had Reaſons for not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0246901400:3"/>
myſelf, I did not ſubſcribe my Name to it; my Counſel of courſe was deſpiſed. However, I am not one of thoſe anonymous Letter-Writers, who are to be diſcouraged by one Rebuff; for as my Motive, contrary to the Uſage of my Fraternity, was a good one, and had your Benefit in view, I ſhall for your ſake perſiſt in it, and addreſs you now in a more earneſt and more public manner, than in my laſt.</p>
            <p>Your Piece was laſt Winter put into my Hands by a Friend, without any Account whence he came by it. I read it through more than once, and it was upon my own Knowledge of it that I gave you my Advice not to produce it at our Summer Theatre; at the ſame
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0246901400:4"/>
time wiſhing you to reſerve it till the Winter, when it might be ſecure of a better Repreſentation. This I ſaid, not in the leaſt doubting but that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager of either Theatre would accept it gladly and without Heſitation. Since then to my inconceivable Surprize I have been informed that it was offered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed at both Theatres. This accounts for the manner in which I got a ſight of it; for it is plain, while it ought to have been in the Hands of its reſpectable Judges Mr. * * * and Mr. * * * it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated into thoſe of other People, who have no manner of Connection with them.</p>
            <p>I confeſs to you, Sir, I was never more ſurprized in my Life than when I heard
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0246901400:5"/>
this Account. My Surprize however car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried an Exception to it in the Perſon of Mr. * * *; for I might have conſidered that as he has long been in poſſeſſion of the firſt Name for thoſe agile Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances in which our mute Harlequin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, it was not at all likely he ſhould countenance any Invaſion upon his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The dangerous Tendency of this Innovation might juſtly alarm him, leſt all that illuſtrious Collection of Birds and Beaſts, Witches and Wire-Dancers, of which he enjoys the ineſtimable Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, might be rendered uſeleſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible; and in the end the Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the Head (contrary to all Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom and Uſage) be made of more Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than the Operations of the Heels. This Inverſion of things I might have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0246901400:6"/>
thought that experienced Practitioner could never approve of; and indeed how you or your Friends could think of tendering a Piece to him of ſuch a Nature I can't well conceive.</p>
            <p>But that any one who profeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a man of Taſte, a Lover of the Belles Lettres, a ſovereign Critic in Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Performances, and one who is himſelf a Dabbler in the Buſineſs, ſhould ſo far forget himſelf, as to reject a Work of ſo much Wit and Ingenuity, ſo much Novelty, and ſuch inimitable Raillery, ſtaggered me beyond meaſure, and I was led almoſt to think I had miſtaken its Merit, and formed too favorable an Opinion of it. While I was thus wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and almoſt upon the Point of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0246901400:7"/>
receding from my Opinion; I received ſuch a Confirmation of my Judgment, by the Reception it had met with from ſome of the moſt celebrated Wits of the Age, as put an End to my Doubts at once, and left me at a loſs what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to aſcribe its Rejection to. That it ſhould ſpring from Want of Taſte and Diſcernment I was loth to believe; that Jealouſy or Want of Candor was the Cauſe, I was ſtill inclined to think; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when I recollected what half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed miſhapen Productions, that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had of late too frequently gave Birth to, with a Compliance, which although it carried the Appearance of Good Nature with it, certainly did no Credit to his Judgment. This Eaſineſs of Temper to Authors of leſs Merit, led
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0246901400:8"/>
me to believe that there could be no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to your Succeſs; and though I knew him abſolute in his Deciſions, I flattered myſelf he would be juſt. The Event convinced me of my Miſtake, and the Concluſions I draw from it are ſuch, as I never admit without Regret.</p>
            <p>The Perſons, Sir, whom you have had the good Fortune to pleaſe, are ſuch, I underſtand, whoſe Names do honour not only to every one under their Protection, but to the Country to which they belong—nay, (if I am not miſ-informed) I may add a Name to the Liſt, a truly Royal one, whoſe Approbation I dare believe you eſteem above any earthly Favour or Enjoyment whatſoever; this Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I am told was accompanied with a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0246901400:9"/>
Liberality peculiar to himſelf, which though it could ſcarce enhance your Happineſs, I make no doubt increaſed his own. Thus diſtinguiſhed by the Applauſe as well as Bounty of your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, it would be ridiculous to ſuppoſe you any longer regret the Rejection you met with in your Application to the Theatre. If you received any thing like Mortification on that Occaſion, it is now reflected back upon him who occaſioned it, and who had not Taſte to diſcern that Merit, which your Sovereign was pleaſed to reward. The happy Aera is now commenced, which if any one alive has cauſe to regret, it can be he only whoſe Decrees are no longer abſolute, and whoſe Deciſions are now made liable to be reverſed; his Monopoly is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0246901400:10"/>
Men of Wit and Genius have now a new Channel open to their Productions, and he who was before the ſupreme Cenſor of their Works, will now be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to his proper Profeſſion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſubſervient Inſtrument in the Repreſentation of them.</p>
            <p>The Complaint that there are no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies wrote in this Age, does not in my Opinion reflect upon our Writers, but is the Conſequence of our Manners. There are no longer any glaring Characters amongſt us; modern Refinements have poliſhed away all thoſe humourous Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarities which ſupplied Topics of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule to the Pens of <hi>Shakeſpear, John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Fletcher;</hi> even <hi>Cibber</hi>'s Beau no longer exiſts. Our Cotemporaries think
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0246901400:11"/>
they have conjured up a freſh Spirit of Humour in the Paſſion of Jealouſy; it may be ſo; but it is no Mark of the Times; no body is jealous now-a-days; Thanks to the Wives of this Age, they prevent all that painful and excruciating Uncertainty which a more guarded Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour might occaſion. The Comic Writer is now left without Materials: even the Court, his never-failing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource for Invective, is now ſo formed, as to afford no Employment for his Pen, unleſs he ſteps out of his Office, and commences Panegyriſt. In this Dearth of Characters I think great Praiſe is due to you, Sir, who have attempted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce amongſt us theſe whimſical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits, and to tranſplant the Wit of <hi>Italy</hi> into your native Climate. I will not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0246901400:12"/>
venture to ſay your Attempt will ſucceed, and for theſe Reaſons, Firſt, becauſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement is as hard to introduce in this Country, as Prejudice is found difficult to remove. Secondly, our Engliſh Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lequin being in general as great a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite with the Mob, as our Engliſh Punchinello is, I conclude that every Man who can jump through a Hoop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or who delights to ſee another do it, will ſet his Face againſt your Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loper. Thirdly, there being no Feats of Agility in your Piece, by which your Performers are put in manifeſt Danger of their Lives, I cannot ſee how it is poſſible the Galleries can ſet it out. Fourthly, and laſtly; from its being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by all People who have Taſte, and the Oppoſition it has received from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0246901400:13"/>
thoſe who have none, I conclude it will be damned by a very great Majority.</p>
            <p>If in reply to theſe Suggeſtions of mine you remind me of the very powerful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection under which you are ſheltered, I muſt acquaint you that for that very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon every free-born Engliſhman who loves to diſappoint and inſult his Betters, will be your declared Enemy and Oppoſer. If you object to this, that your End is anſwered, that happy in the Approbation you have already obtained, you are above the Cenſure of the Vulgar and indifferent to their Praiſe, I think you judge right; and am,</p>
