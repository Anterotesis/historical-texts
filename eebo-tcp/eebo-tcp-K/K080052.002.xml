            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>DURHAM is a maritime county, and takes its name from the city of Durham; commonly called the biſhopric, and ſometimes the county palatine.</p>
            <p>The deſcription given by Camden is to the following effect <note n="*" place="bottom">Camden's Brit. (Gibſon's edition, 1772) vol. ii. p. 127.</note>: <q>It lies north of Yorkſhire, and is ſhaped like a triangle <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>Geographers deale with countries as aſtronomers with their aſteriſmes, and fancy them into ſhapes; as <hi>Italy</hi> into a man's legge, <hi>Spayne</hi> into an Oxhyde, and the forme of this biſhoprick into a ▵, or an equilateral triangle. It lyeth in the boſome of the Germaine Neptune, and embraced betweene the armes of the two chriſtall rivers <hi>Teeſe</hi> and <hi>Derwent.</hi>—Legend of St Cuthbert.</p>
                  </note>, the apex or top whereof lies to the weſt, being formed there by the meeting of the north boundary and the head of the river Tees: The ſouthern ſide is wholly bounded by the courſe of the Tees: The northern ſide, from about the point of the angle, forms a line to the river Derwent, and then is bounded by that river</q> (till it receives the rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let called Chopwell or Milkburn), <q>and ſo full north to the river Tyne: The baſis of this triangle, to the eaſt, is formed by the ſhore of the German ocean.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Modern geographers have laid down the abuttals ſo variouſly, that in regard to the north-weſt point, we can in general only ſay, the river Tees totally ſeparates the county of Durham from Weſtmorland and Yorkſhire, and a very narrow point of Cumberland intervenes between that river and the confines of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, a ſpace in which the proprietors are not well aſcertained of their real boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries. On the other ſides, Camden's deſcription is accurate.</p>
            <p>The parts of this county, extended into the upper point or apex of the triangle, Camden deſcribes<note n="‡" place="bottom">Camd. Brit. ibid.</note> 
               <q>to conſiſt of naked lands, the woods few, the hills bald, but not deſtitute of veins of iron ore, whilſt the vallies produce plenty of graſs, the Engliſh Appenines interſecting the country at this angle.</q> At the diſtance of two hundred years, we cannot wonder at this picture of our county, or the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of naturaliſts in regard to its produce and riches: The contraſt we ſhall draw, it is hoped, will prove intereſting. Our author then proceeds to deſcribe the eaſtern ſide or baſis of the triangle, where he obſerves, <q>as well as to the ſouth, the ſoil by tillage is rendered fertile, and the country enamelled with meadows, corn-fields, and paſtures, and graced with many towns, the bowels of the earth abounding in coal.</q> Such is the imperfect account given by this great wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>The Magna Britannia deſcribes this county to be thirty-five miles in length, thirty in breadth, and about one hundred and ſeven in circumference: Another account ſays, it is thirty-nine miles long, and thirty-five broad; containing nine hundred and fifty-eight ſquare miles, and ſix hundred and ten thouſand acres of land; and comprehending one city, eleven other market towns, fifty-two pariſhes,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0782100202:8"/>
and twenty-one chapels; two hundred and twenty-three villages, nineteen thouſand nine hundred and eighty-five houſes, and ninety-ſeven thouſand inhabitants; ſixteen rivers, twenty-one parks, and ſeveral caſtles <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>The county is divided into four wards, called Eaſington ward, Stockton ward, Darlington ward, and Cheſter ward. We know no reaſon why the ſeveral diſtricts took thoſe denominations, or derived their names from places of inferior conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and diſtinction.</p>
            <p>The air of the county is generally healthy, though cold on the hills; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſome authors, that of the weſtern parts ſharper than that of the eaſt. It is well watered by rivers and brooks, the chief of which are the Tees and Were <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <p>Hollinſhed's deſcription of theſe two rivers, and the ſeveral ſtreams that join them, is ſo accurate, that we cannot omit the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The THESE, a river that beareth and feedeth an excellent ſalmon, riſeth in the Black Lowes, above two miles flat weſt of the ſoutherlie head of Were called <hi>Burdop,</hi> and ſouth of the head of Weſt Alen, and thence runneth through Tildale foreſt, and taking in the <hi>Langdon-water</hi> from northwdſt, it runneth to Durtpit chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to Newbiggin, and ſo to Middleton, receiving by weſt of each of theſe a rill comming from by north (of which the laſt is called <hi>Hude</hi>) and likewiſe the <hi>Lune</hi> afterward by ſouthweſt, that riſeth at three ſeveral places, whereof the firſt is in the borders of Weſtmerland and there called <hi>Arnegill-becke,</hi> the ſecond more ſoutherlie named <hi>Lune-becke,</hi> and the third by ſouth at Bandor Skarth-hill, and meeting all above Arnegill-houſe, they run togither in one bottome to Lathekirke-bridge, and then into the Theſe. Having therefore met with theſe, it runneth to Mickleton, and there taking in the <hi>Skirkwith-water,</hi> it goeth to Rombaldkirke, croſſing there alſo one rill and the Bander-brooke by ſouthweſt, and then going to Morewood-hag and Morewood-parke, till it come to Bernard's caſtell. Here alſo it receiveth the <hi>Thureſgill-water</hi> coming eaſt of Rere-croſſe in Yorkſhire from the Spittle in Stanmore by Crag almoſt ſouthweſt, and being united with the Theſe, it goeth by Stratford, Egleſdon, Rokeſbie, Thorpe, Wickliffe, Ovington, Winſton, and betwene Barfurth and Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furth meeteth with another rill, that commeth from Langleie foreſt, betwene Rabie caſtell and Standorpe, of whoſe name I have no knowledge. But to proceed, the Theſe being paſt Ramfurth, runneth betwene Perſore and Cliffe, and in the waie to Croftſbridge taketh in the <hi>Skerne,</hi> a pretie water, which riſeth above Trimdon, and goeth by Fiſhburne, Bradburie, Preſton, Braforton, Skirmingham, the Burdons, Haughton and Darling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and there finallie meeting with the <hi>Cocke-becke</hi> or <hi>Dare,</hi> it falleth in the Theſe beneath Stapleton before it come at Croftſbridge, and (as it ſhould ſeeme) is the ſame which Leland calleth Gretteie or Grettie. From thence it runneth to Sockburne, nether Dunſleie, Middleton-row, Newſham, Yarne (croſſing a brooke from Levenbridge) called <hi>Levin,</hi> or <hi>Leuinus</hi> in Latin, whoſe crinkling courſe is notable, and the ſtreame of ſome called <hi>Thorpe.</hi> After this the Theſe haſteth on to Barwic, Preſton, Thorne abbeie, and Arſham, which ſtandeth on the ſoutheaſt ſide of the river almoſt betwene the falles of two waters, whereof one deſcendeth from Weſt Hartburne, by Long Newton, Elton, and Stockton; the other from Stillington or Shillington, by Whitton, Thorpe, Blackeſton, Billingham, and Norton. From Arſham finallie it goeth to Bellaſis, Middleburgh, and ſo into the ſea.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE city of Durham claims our firſt attention. It is in Eaſington ward, and lies near the centre of the county, in latitude 54° 50′, and 1° 27′ weſt lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude from London. From whatever quarter the traveller approaches this place, he is ſtruck with its elegant ſituation, and the grandeur of ſome of its public build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. A few paces from the ſouth road, this Engliſh Zion makes a noble appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. In the centre, the caſtle and cathedral crown a very lofty eminence, girt by the two ſtreets called the Baileys, encloſed with the remains of the ancient city walls, and ſkirted with hanging gardens and plantations which deſcend to the river Were, in this point of view exhibiting the figure of a horſe-ſhoe <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>This reverend aged abbey is ſeated in the heart of the citty, advanced upon the ſhoulders of an high hill, and encompaſſed againe with the higher hills, that he that hath ſeene the ſituation of this citty, hath ſeene the map of Sion, and may ſave a journey to the Jeruſalem. Shee is girded almoſt rownd with the renowned river of Weer, in which, as in a glaſſe of cryſtall, ſhee might once have beheld the beauty, but nowe the ruine of her walls.—<bibl>Legend of St Cuthbert.</bibl>

               </note>. To form the right wing of this pictureſque proſpect, the banks on the oppoſite ſide of the river are high, rocky, ſteep, and ſcattered over with trees; along the brink of which the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0782100202:11"/>
ſtreet of New-Elvet is extended, and terminated by the handſome church of St Oſwald: At the bottom runs Old-Elvet. Acroſs the bridge are the ſtreets of Claypeth and St Giles, which climb the more diſtant eminence, the church termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the line of buildings. The ſlopes of the hills are beautified with hanging gardens and rich meadows. Newton-Hall, one of the ſeats of Sir Henry Liddell, bart. with its adjacent plantations, fills the nearer back-ground; behind which a fine cultivated country is diſcovered, lengthening the proſpect to the diſtance of ten miles, on which Penſhar-Hill, with its peaked brow, is a beautiful object. To form the left wing, the banks oppoſite to the caſtle and cathedral are cloathed with wood and fruit-trees; and South-ſtreet ſtretches along the ſummit. The long canal which the river exhibits to the eye in this part, is croſſed by Framwelgate bridge, of two eliptic arches. Crook-Hall, a ſeat of one of the family of Hopper, is ſeen on the river's banks, with the woodlands of Newton-Hall on the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ground; to the left of which the ſweet villa of Francis Johnſon, <abbr>eſq</abbr> at Aykley-Heads, is ſeen, ſurrounded with irregular mounts <note n="*" place="bottom">Here, it is alledged, was a dru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Approaching the city from the north, it has the moſt romantic and uncommon appearance: It ſeems to be ſcattered over a multitude of irregular hills, (for the ground by which it is approached is thrown up into round mounts), and we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver various parts of the town, the caſtle, and churches, through ſeveral vallies in one point of view, ſo that they appear like ſo many diſtinct places. The weſt front of the caſtle is ſeen on the ſummit of a ragged and ſteep rock, with ſome parts of the cathedral; and the ſtreet of St Giles, as if totally unconnected with the reſt of the town, is ſpread over the brow of a diſtant eminence. The hollow paſſes amongſt the hills on the north-weſt of the city, afford beautiful and pictureſque proſpects. At Caſtle-Chair, where the view is much confined, the caſtle and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral have a noble appearance; the octagon tower of the former, with the mound on which it is placed, have a grand effect. On the eminence oppoſite to Shaw-Wood, the view juſt mentioned is enlarged; yet, the diſtant branches of the town being intercepted by riſing grounds, leave the principal objects in the moſt diſtinct and pictureſque arrangement. Approaching from the eaſt down the ſtreet of St Giles, we command the ſecond nobleſt view of the city: In front, the river Were forms a fine canal through a rich vale, croſſed by Elvet bridge, of ſeven wet arches, and many other land arches; the town crowds the ſwift riſings of the hill, pile upon pile; the caſtle and cathedral church crowning the ſummit of the eminence. To the left are ſeen the banks of Elvet and the church, flanked by a diſtant foreſt of oaks, and the groves which hang on the margin of the river: On the right is a view of Newton-Hall, and the adjacent grounds.—To this general deſcription, more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute particulars will be added as we paſs through the city.</p>
            <p>A ſhort view of hiſtorical facts relative to this place, as each circumſtance aroſe in the reſpective aeras of our prelates, is given in due order in the preceding vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of this work.

            <p>We have not the leaſt evidence of any town where Durham now ſtands, before the monks reſted with the remains of St Cuthbert, after the Daniſh invaſion. It was alſo remarked in the courſe of this work, that there is a place adjacent to the preſent city called Old Durham; but we have neither traces in hiſtory nor records to ſhew that any town exiſted there previous to St Cuthbert's arrival. The legendary tale, alone ſupported by the effigies on the north-weſt tower of the tranſept of the cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral church, (which will be deſcribed when that edifice is treated of) relates, that after the revelation or viſion at <hi>Wedelau,</hi> according to Symeon's text, but <hi>Werdele</hi> by others, and deſcribed to lie eaſt of Durham, the monks were much at a loſs to find the place pointed out by the oracle, where they ſhould reſt from their labour: The name of <hi>Dunholme,</hi> then ſaid to be given them, was not known to any. If they then lay at <hi>Warden Law,</hi> (which from much ſimilarity of name ſome have conceived was the place of the viſion) it was within eight miles; if on the banks of the Were, (where we ſhall by ſome obſervations attempt to ground a ſuppoſition that the monks halted) it was to the eaſt of the city, at a very little diſtance; for that river from its ſource flows almoſt due eaſt to Biſhop-Auckland, and from thence almoſt due north to Old Durham. It would have been ſtrange if <hi>Deiraham, Dureſme,</hi> or <hi>Dunholme,</hi> a place named from the kingdom of Deira in which it was ſituated, or ſome ſuch memorable diſtinction, had then ſtood on the ſcite of Old Durham, and was not known to the inhabitants within ſo ſmall a diſtance as Cheſter, the laſt reſidence of the monks. The diſcovery of the place of their deſtination occurred to the wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers accidentally, as the legend relates; for whilſt they travelled through the country with uncertain ſteps, a woman, ſeeking her cow, was informed by a perſon ſhe met that ſhe would find it in <hi>Dunholme:</hi> The aſtoniſhed monks rejoiced at the propitious voice, and followed their fortunate guide, where indeed they found a country flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with milk and honey. So much for the legend; which we would not have troubled the reader with, but it leads to an argument, that the effigies on the church were placed there in commemoration of the happy poſſeſſion of the rich meads and vallies on the Were, which could not be more aptly expreſſed in emblem than by the figure of the bountiful cow diſtending her udder to diſpenſe charitable gifts to mankind: It was emblematical of the rich country they had obtained, of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious gifts of Providence decreed to them, and the holy benevolence of the church. In purſuance of this idea, it is probable the monks, on diſcovering their deſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſidence with the pious hoſt which accompanied them, ſat down on the plains
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0782100202:14"/>
ſouth-eaſt of the preſent city, by the brink of the river; and there erected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves habitations, till they could build a church wherein to depoſite the ſaint's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains: This conjecture has a ſtrict correſpondence, not only with the name of <hi>Old Durham,</hi> but of the <hi>Burgus vetus,</hi> (which we ſhall point out from ſeveral records) afterwards granted to the convent. On the one ſide of this plain was a fortreſs, perhaps of no leſs antiquity than the times we are ſpeaking of, called the <hi>Maiden Caſtle,</hi>

The remains of extenſive breaſtworks and trenches are to be ſeen a little farther up the vale, ſuch as the people of that age uſed to caſt up for the defence of their habitations; and not far diſtant is an eminence called <hi>Mont-Joye,</hi> from whence the wanderers obtained a view of the Hill of Zion, whereon St Cuthbert was to reſt for ever.<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr Cade of Durham, in his tract on the Roman roads of this county, publiſhed in the Archaeologia, vol. vii. p. 74, has taken great pains to trace the works, and entertains an idea that they were the veſtiges of a Roman winter-camp.—For the ſatisfaction of our readers, we ſhall extract his letter on the ſubject when we deſcribe thoſe places.</note> 
               <hi>Warden-Law</hi> lies ſeveral points to the north-eaſt of the city of Durham, and on the wrong ſide of the river for the monks to approach Cheſter from Ripon. The fords are dangerous and uncertain, and even impaſſable at certain ſeaſons by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers on foot: Warden-Law is alſo at a greater diſtance from Ripon by eight miles than Durham. Such circumſtances counterpoiſe the apparent ſimilarity of names, and induce a belief, that as the religious troop would croſs the river Tees either at Neſeham, Croft, or Piercebridge, they would ſeek the fordable paſſes of the river Were near Durham; and that <hi>Wedelau, Werdale,</hi> and ſuch other names as we find in ancient authors, expreſs the <hi>Dale of Were.</hi> Though names grow corrupt, yet points of the compaſs muſt remain; and if the pious hoſt ſat down eaſt of Durham, on the banks of the Were, there was no other ground ſo ſituated but in the vicinity of Old Durham.

               <hi>Dunholme,</hi> or the eminence on which St Cuthbert was to reſt, is deſcribed to us as being inſufficient for the reception of the multitude that attended the ſaint, till they had cut down the thickets and foreſts which grew upon the ſkirts of the hill. The firſt work the pious labourers engaged in, was to erect an ark or tabernacle with timber and boughs of trees, where they depoſited the ſaint's body; after which they built a compleat edifice, ſimilar to the churches of that age, which was called the <hi>White Church.</hi> This tranſaction all the monkiſh writers fix to the

                  <p>The learned editor of Camden adds, <q>And to omit the many pretended miracles, and other paſſages of leſs moment, he (Symeon) ſays further, that the firſt church erected at Dunholm by biſhop Aldwin was, <hi>facta citiſſime de virgis eccleſiola,</hi> "a little church quickly made of rods;" juſt ſuch another ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as that which is ſaid to have been firſt built at Glaſtenbury, whereof Sir Henry Spelman has given us a draught:</q>

                  </p>
               </note>. It doth not appear that any habitations were erected for the people on the mount where the church was built, for a conſiderable time after their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Dunholme; for we are told, in the courſe of three years from the date of the firſt tabernacle, that a church of ſtone-work was begun and dedicated by biſhop Aldun, wherein the ſaint's remains were depoſited. According to the courſe of events exhibited by the ancient writers, it was not till after the foundation of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun's church was laid; that the foreſt which grew round the eminence was cut down, and the ſkirts of the hill were rendered ſit for human habitation. Much labour was expended; and all the inhabitants between Coquet and Tees rivers, at the command of the earl of Northumberland, are ſaid to have been employed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; workmen drawn from a tract of country not leſs than fifty miles in length: Such was the mighty concourſe which on that occaſion crowded the banks of the Were <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>The topography of <hi>Dunholme</hi> at that tyme was, that it was more beholding to nature for fortification than fertilitie; where thick woods both hindred the ſtarres from viewing the earth, and the earth from the proſpect of heaven. Here the monkes, with extemporary devotion, inſtead of a church, built an arbour of boughs for <hi>St. Cuthbert,</hi> and from thence tranſlated it into <hi>Whitkyrk</hi> (for three years); while <hi>Aldwinus</hi> the biſhop raiſed no ſmall building of ſtone worke for his cathedral church, where all the people betweene <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued</hi> and <hi>Tees</hi> three years were at worke, and were paid for their paynes with treaſure in heaven, than which there was never a dearer or cheaper way to build churches.

                  </p>
               </note>. From the above circumſtances we are led to date the riſe of the town of Durham in the opening of the eleventh century. Biſhop Aldun did not live to ſee his deſign compleated, but left the weſtern part of the edifice, after eighteen years pious care, for his ſucceſſors to finiſh.</p>
            <p>We hear nothing further of the town of Durham till the year 1040, when, ſome authors ſay, it was attacked by Duncan of Scotland; and it ſeems there were then fortifications, for the townſmen, as reported, ſuſtained the invaders aſſaults for a long time, and at length made a victorious ſally, whereby the enemy were totally routed. The heads of ſuch Scots leaders as fell or were taken priſoners, were ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on poles round the market-place. The eminence choſen for the firſt build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings was ſo ſteep on every ſide but one, that it was eaſily defended againſt the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of an enemy: The weakeſt part was on the north-eaſt, where Claypeth, or Clayport-gate, now ſtands, being on the neck of land between the ſtreams of the river: This neck, from brink to brink of the Were, is not much above 200 paces in width in its preſent ſtate; and there are ſufficient appearances on the adjacent ground to encourage a conjecture, that a ſluice or moat croſſed this narrow part, whereby the whole city could on occaſion be compleatly inſulated. The name of <hi>Clayport,</hi> as it is ſtiled in all the ancient writers, appears to be a corruption of <hi>Cluer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> or the gate of the ſluice; <hi>cleur</hi> being a north-country word, in acceptation for a ſluice-gate or ſluice-board, by which a dam-head is ſtopped.

Symeon, who gives us the account of the before-mentioned attack on Durham, takes no notice of any fort or ſtrong-hold which contributed to the gallant defence of the inhabitants; but it is probable the mound on which the octagonal tower of the caſtle ſtands, was cotemporary with the church, and perhaps formed of the ſoil, which was neceſſarily moved when the foundations of that ſtructure were laid. At Warwick there is a mound of the ſame form, with terraces ſimilar to thoſe at Durham; and Dugdale <note n="*" place="bottom">Warwickſhire, p. 308.</note> tells us, <q>If it was preſumption to carry its antiquity higher, to refer the foundation thereof to the renowned lady Ethelſtede, daughter of king Alfred, and lady of the Mercians, I am ſure will not, in regard it appears, that ſhe in 915 (ſcil. in the 16th year of king Edward the Elder) cauſed the dungeon to be made, which is a ſtrong tower or platform, upon a large and high mount of earth, artificially raiſed (ſuch being uſually placed towards the ſide of a caſtle or fort, which is leaſt defenſible) the ſubſtance whereof is yet to be ſeen.</q> This paſſage is quoted, to ſhew the reader there was an example for the people to follow, and that ſuch mounts were of that antiquity. It is ſaid to be the opinion of the ingenious Mr Wright, of Byers-green<note n="†" place="bottom">Author of Louthiania.</note>, that this was a Daniſh mount or fort; but we have no traces in hiſtory of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple having a reſidence here; and indeed the former arguments hold againſt it, as ſuch a work would have rendered the place notorious to the monks of Cheſter, at the diſtance of ſix miles.</p>
            <p>The next event noted in hiſtory, wherein Durham is diſtinguiſhed, was in the year 1069, after the coming in of William the Norman, when he ſent down Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min as governor of Northumberland with a guard of 700 veteran Norman ſoldiers. Deſpiſing biſhop Egelwin's caution and advice, Cumin entered the city with marks of cruelty and tyranny, and through the inſolence of his own ſelf-ſufficiency, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his troops to give themſelves up to rioting and wantonneſs; they forcibly took poſſeſſion of the houſes, were diſperſed through every quarter of the city, and committed various enormities againſt the inhabitants. The Normans, overcome with drunkenneſs and revelling, were totally off their guard; whilſt the people of the adjacent country, arming themſelves, aſſembled in the night, and at the dawn of day forced the gates of the city, fell upon the Normans when they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no violence, and put them to the ſword; ſo that the ſtreets were filled with blood and carcaſes, the houſe where the earl lodged was ſet on fire, and thoſe within endeavouring to fly were immediately ſlain, only one wounded perſon

of the whole band eſcaping death. When the ruthleſs tyrant William, greedy of revenge, marched his army northward, the affrighted inhabitants of Durham fled the city <note n="*" place="bottom">Camd. Brit.</note>; and the monks forſook their convent, leaving the Normans a melancholy ſolitude, on which to wreak their vengeance by fire and deſtruction. As ſoon as the troops retired, the inhabitants came from their hiding places, and the religious hoſt brought back their holy charge after an abſence of four months.</p>
            <p>The king having appointed Walcher to the biſhopric, on his return from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt Malcolm of Scotland in 1072, ordered a caſtle or fortreſs to be built at Durham, at once to protect the biſhop and his convent, to keep the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in ſubjection, and to awe the northern territories, this place being eſteemed a fit ſituation for a barrier. It is certain ſuch an edifice was begun about that period of time; but we have no information of what form it was, though the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonal figure is not unuſual in the Norman buildings. It ſeems, Camden appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the caſtle directed to be built by William was not founded on the ſcite of any ancient fortreſs, his words being <hi>in eminentiori collis parte extruxit;</hi> but that a more elevated ſituation was choſen for the new bulwark than the ſtronghold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to by Gulielmus Gemiticencis, whoſe words he quotes, deſcribing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs: <q>From whence (he ſays) the Engliſh, diſſatisfied with the Norman yoke, made frequent ſallies, and kept themſelves cloſe there, waiting for the expected approach of the Danes; that it was in a part of the country inacceſſible by reaſon of woods and waters; that it had a ſtrong rampier round it, which they called Dunholme.</q> This account ſeems to ſtrengthen the former arguments. William de Malmſbury, whom Camden quotes, and who lived about that time, gives us this deſcription of the city: <q>Durham is a hill riſing gradually from out the valley to its ſummit; and notwithſtanding, by its rugged ſituation and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken rocks, all acceſs for an enemy is cut off, yet lately they have built a caſtle upon a hill, at whoſe foot runs an excellent river.</q> Dugdale, further ſpeaking of the caſtle of Warwick, ſays, <q>In thoſe days (in the Saxons time I mean) were very few ſuch defenſible places as we now call caſtles, that being a French name; ſo that though the Engliſh were a bold and warlike people, yet, for want of the like ſtrongholds, were they much leſs able to reſiſt their enemies, which defect gave great advantage to the Norman conqueror after his victory at Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; whereof he was ſo ſenſible, that he neglected not to raiſe ſtore of ſuch forts through the whole realm, as I have elſewhere obſerved, amongſt which this at Warwick was not the leaſt.</q>

            <p>Biſhop Walcher's aſſumption of the civil juriſdiction, in the character of pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, it is apprehended brought on the tragical cataſtrophe before related <note n="†" place="bottom">See vol. i. p. 130.</note>, in the month of May, 1080; and the city of Durham, after his death, ſuſtained the aſſault of the rioters for four days, who, not able to make any impreſſion, diſperſed themſelves.</p>
            <p>William de Carilepho, who ſucceeded in the biſhopric, was among the malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents on the acceſſion of William Rufus: After the king had quelled the ſouthern

After the biſhop's reſtoration to the See, he improved the fortifications of the city, by extending the walls between the church and the caſtle: He removed all the houſes on the area between thoſe two edifices, and levelled the ground: He fortified the caſtle with a moat, ſtrengthened the banks of the river, and built the beautiful bridge called Framwellgate-bridge.</p>
            <p>In April 1139, this city entertained the members of congreſs, when articles of peace were agreed upon; Maud queen of England, with a great number of barons, on the part of that crown, and prince Henry, with many Scotch nobles, on the other part, being preſent.</p>
            <p>King Henry II. during his diſpleaſure with biſhop Pudſey, took poſſeſſion of the caſtle and city of Durham, and on various pretexts repeatedly deprived him of the cuſtody of this ſtrong place. It was a cuſtom for the burgeſſes, on the demiſe of a prelate, to depoſite the keys of the city gates at the ſhrine of St Cuthbert: On the death of biſhop Pudſey, the officers of the crown, who had ſeized the temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, took violent poſſeſſion of the keys contrary to the ancient uſage. As the election of a prelate was ſtudiouſly delayed, and much oppreſſion happened during the vacancy of the See, under the influence of the crown officers, and as a creature of the king ſucceeded, it is not to be wondered that we hear no further than the mere mention of this infringement of the privilege of the convent.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0782100202:19"/>King Henry III. on his northern excurſion, honoured this city with his reſidence for ſome ſhort time, during the epiſcopacy of biſhop Farnham.</p>
            <p>After the victory of Falkirk, Edward I. halted at Durham, to which place intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was brought that the Scots again appeared in force, which obliged the king to march nothward, and he celebrated the feſtival of Chriſtmas at Tynemouth. In the year 1300, the king was again at Durham, as a mediator between the biſhop and his convent, touching their then bitter diſſentions.</p>
            <p>On Brus's incurſion in the time of Edward II. a party of the Scotch, whilſt the inhabitants were in their beds, ſurpriſed the ſuburbs of Durham, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to aſhes.</p>
            <p>Edward III. with a great army, was at Durham for ſome time, before the Scotch were diſcovered to lie in Stanhope-park: In 1333 he was again at Durham, on his march northward, previous to the victory of Hallidown-hill.</p>
            <p>The walls of the city of Durham having been neglected, and becoming ruinous, were reſtored and put into a ſtate of defence by biſhop Beaumont, who in 1323 re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſevere cenſure from Edward II. for his negligence in matters ſo important to his palatinate. On the 23d of December, 1356, Edward III. was at Durham, and iſſued ſummonſes for the military tenants to attend him on a northern expedition, in which Berwick was beſieged and reduced.</p>
            <p>In 1424 this city was crowded with the nobility of England and Scotland, on the liberation of the Scotch king, and his marriage with the lady Jane Seymour; the hoſtages were received here; a truce for ſeven years was alſo then ſettled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two nations; and certain laws eſtabliſhed for the government of the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: The king and queen of Scotland remained at Durham a conſiderable time, not departing thence until the laſt day of March or firſt of April.</p>

By this charter, of which the plate is a <hi>fac-ſimile,</hi> the people were for ever thereafter diſcharged from the cuſtoms of in-toll and out-toll for all their merchandizes; they were alſo exempted from he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, a duty or tribute eſtabliſhed in very diſtant antiquity, and in the Saxon times given to the lord for his better maintenance in war. Moſt of the ancient writers have diſtinguiſhed heriots in two branches, heriot cuſtom and heriot ſervice: Law definitions have little right to a place here; it muſt ſuffice to ſay, that both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate an eſtate of inheritance, and the heriot ſervice a fee-ſimple.

The additional bounty to the borough, which has reference to the free cuſtoms of Newcaſtle, may not be ſo eaſily explained, no hiſtorian having hitherto informed us what were the original privileges of Newcaſtle, or by whom they were granted. If in the laborious reſearches of the reverend Mr Brand this may be diſcovered, it will add new light to the hiſtory of our city, whoſe burgeſſes, by this grant, were entitled to hold all ſuch free cuſtoms as the burgeſſes of Newcaſtle enjoyed <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>In the time of biſhop Booth, the bye-laws and ordinances of the cordwainers were exemplified and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled, greatly ſimilar to thoſe of the weavers; dated the laſt day of January, 1463. Biſhop James granted a confirmation thereof by letters patent, dated 27th Sept. 1582.</p>
                  <p>In the time of biſhop Tunſtall, the bye-laws, &amp;c. of the goldſmith craft, plumber craft, pewterer craft, potter craft, glazier craft, and painter craft, were confirmed and ratified by that prelate; witneſſed by Robt Hyndmers, chancellor, 22d May, in the third year of his tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>In the time of biſhop Pilkington, the bye-laws, &amp;c. of the mercer craft were confirmed and ratified by that prelate; witneſſed by Robt Swift, chancellor, 6th Oct. 3d of Eliz.</p>
                  <p>In the time of biſhop James, the bye-laws, &amp;c. of thoſe profeſſing the art or myſtery of rough maſons, wallers, ſlaters, paviors, tylers, and plaiſterers, were confirmed by that prelate the 21ſt Jan. 1609, and enrolled the 13th Sept. 1615, in the Heralds book, by Rich. St George, king of arms.</p>
                  <p>In biſhop Morton's time, a charter was granted to the rough maſons, wallers, ſlaters, paviors, plaiſterers, and bricklayers, whereby they were incorporated and made a body politic, by the name of wardens, ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and ſearchers of the company of free maſons, rough maſons, wallers, ſlaters, paviors, plaiſterers, and bricklayers. And the ſame was made patent; dated the 16th Apr. 1638; and enrolled in the cloſe tolls of the Chancery at Durham.</p>
                  <p>The ſadlers have no charter or confirmation, under ſeal, of their bye-laws; but a long roll of orders and bye-laws, ſigned by the ſeveral members as they are admitted, beginning 28th Feb. 1628, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the whole trade 4th Feb. 1688.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0782100202:34"/>
Whereas the city of Durham in the county palatine of Durham is, and time out of mind hath been, an ancient city, of good fame. And the burgeſſes, men
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0782100202:35"/>
and inhabitants of the ſaid city, together with thoſe of Framwelgate, have had and enjoyed divers rights, juriſdictions, liberties, and privileges, as well by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0782100202:36"/>
as by virtue of divers charters, grants, and confirmations, as well from us, as ſeveral of our predeceſſors, biſhops of Durham. And the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0782100202:37"/>
men and inhabitants in time paſt, have ſuffered great damage, by reaſon of the defect of ſome of the ſaid charters; and fearing leſt in time to come they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0782100202:38"/>
ſhould be moleſted in the enjoyment of ſuch their liberties and free cuſtoms, for want of publication, and other cauſes; they have therefore humbly entreated us to expreſs, in ſpecial words, what the ſaid liberties and free cuſtoms are, and to grant the ſame to the ſaid burgeſſes and inhabitants and their ſucceſſors, and to incorporate them,</q> &amp;c. By this charter he conſtituted and granted, that the burgeſſes and inhabitants ſhould be one body politic and corporate, conſiſting of a mayor, twelve aldermen, and commonalty, to continue for ever, by the name of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0782100202:39"/>
mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of the city of Durham and Framwelgate, and by that title to plead and be impleaded in all courts of law within the county, with power to purchaſe lands not exceeding the yearly value of 100 marks, and to have a common ſeal. Hugh Wright was therein appointed the firſt mayor, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in office till the 4th day of October then next following, and then to be an alderman for life, to ſupply the number of twelve without any new election. Robt Sureties, Rich. Hutchinſon, Edw. Wanles, Wm Hall, Ja. Farales, Tho. Pearſon, John Wall, Edw. Taylor, Hugh Hutchinſon, John Heighington, John Pattinſon, and Richard Wright, were appointed aldermen for life. They were directed to chuſe yearly twenty-four diſcreet men out of their ſeveral twelve arts, myſteries, or trades, that is to ſay, two out of the mercers, grocers, haberdaſhers, ironmongers, and ſalters; two of the drapers and taylors, two of the ſkinners and glovers, two of the tanners, two of the weavers, two of the dyers and fullers, two of the cordwainers, two of the ſaddlers, two of the butchers, two of the ſmiths, two of the carpenters and joiners, two of the free maſons and rough maſons, inhabitants of the city and Framwelgate, which, with the mayor and aldermen, ſhould form a common council for the ſaid city, and, on the 4th day of October yearly, to chuſe a mayor out of the body of the ſaid aldermen, it being requiſite to have ſeven aldermen in the majority of votes on that occaſion, with a power for a like majority to deprive or ſuſpend the mayor for any offence committed in his office; and on ſuch occaſion, or on the death of the mayor, another chief magiſtrate ſhould be in like manner elected, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eleven days from the time of ſuch deprivation, to ſupply that year; and within three days after ſuch election, to be ſworn before the biſhop for the time being, or, on the See being vacant, or the biſhop being in diſtant parts, then before the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the county palatine, or, on his abſence out of the juriſdiction, before the aldermen and the twenty-four common-councilmen, or the major part of them. On the fifth day of October, yearly, the ſaid mayor, aldermen, and common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil are directed to chuſe two ſerjeants. On the death of a common councilman, the mayor and aldermen, within twenty days, are to nominate one in his ſtead, out of the ſame trade; and on the vacancy of an alderman within the ſame time, to nominate another out of the burgeſſes and inhabitants of the ſaid city and Fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welgate. Any perſon elected mayor or alderman, and refuſing to take upon him the office, is made ſubject to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, to be levied on the deſaulter's goods and chattles, or committed to the gaol at Durham till the ſame is paid; and ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ines to be applied to the public uſe of the city. They were alſo authorized to make laws, ſtatutes, and ordinances, for the better govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the city, and the markets and fairs therein, and all officers, myſteries, arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and inhabitants, and for regulating their ſeveral trades and myſteries; and the due preſervation and management of the lands and poſſeſſions of the ſaid body corporate. And for the better maintenance, ſtate, and dignity of the ſaid mayor, aldermen, and commonalty, the ſame charter grants them all courts, fairs, markets, tolls, perquiſites, ſtallages, pontages, paſſages, cuſtoms, and all and ſingular liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, franchiſes, profits, commodities, emoluments, and free cuſtoms, which at any time before the date thereof the burgeſſes had enjoyed, or the bailiffs or aldermen

And whereas it was complained to this courte, that ſuch as brought corne to be ſould on the ſaid markett or fayre days were oftentimes conſtreyned to ſtay untill one or two of the clock in the afternoon before they might vent or ſell their ſaid corne, in regard the markett bell hath not been ſooner runge, and this courte was then moved to appoint a certain hour for the moſt convenience and tyme the corne bell ſhould be rung, the rather for that as was alledged, ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie perſons in the winter ſeaſon, whoſe dwellings are ſomewhat more remote from the ſaid city, have been conſtreyned by the late ringing of the ſaid bell to ſtay in the towne all night to their needleſs charge, and ſo to ryde home on the Sunday.

                  <p>Green againſt mayor of Durham.—King's Bench, Hilary Term, 30 Geo. II. 26th Jan. 1757.—Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row's Reports, vol. i. p. 127.</p>
                  <p>This caſe was ſet down in the crown paper as a ſpecial verdict, and was ſo called and argued by one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil on each ſide, in the ſame manner as if it had been a ſpecial verdict: But it was only a verdict on ſix ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral traverſes to the return of a mandamus (on 9 Ann, c. 20) directed to the mayor of Durham, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſwear and admit Robert Green into the place and office of a freeman of the company or frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of freemaſons of the city of Durham.</p>
                  <p>The right ſet up by Robert Green was, his having been duly elected and admitted a freeman of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; but the objection to his being ſworn by the mayor was, "that he had not conformed to certain bye-laws particularly ſpecified in the return, and found by the verdict."</p>
                  <p>The return was, That Durham is, and for time immemorial hath been, an ancient city, &amp;c. and alſo that a power is given by a charter of Tobias, then biſhop of Durham, in 44 Eliz. confirmed by James I. to the mayor, aldermen, and common council for the time being, or the major part of them (of whom the mayor and ſix of the aldermen to be ſeven) to make bye-laws in the ſtead, for, and in the name of the whole corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate body of the city of Durham and Framwelgate.</p>
                  <p>Then the return ſet forth, that certain bye-laws were duly made by the mayor, aldermen, and commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in due manner met and aſſembled at the Guild-hall, &amp;c. on the 8th Nov. 1728, and particularly ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies three ſeveral bye-laws as having been then and there made by them, for calling the names at four meetings, and the penal laws againſt the wardens and the mayor, &amp;c.—<hi>Vide bye-laws on the preceding page.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All which ſaid ſeveral ordinances and bye-laws, the return alledges to have, ever ſince the making thereof, been conſtantly obſerved and kept, &amp;c. and to be ſtill in their full force and virtue, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That Robert Green was not elected and admitted a freeman of the ſaid company of free-maſons, rough-maſons, wallers, paviors, plaſterers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſlaters, and bricklayers.</p>
                  <p>That Green was never duly called to be a freeman of the ſaid city of Durham and Framwelgate, nor ever approved of by the mayor, or one or more alderman or aldermen of the city of Durham and Framwelgate aforeſaid, and the warden and ſtewards of the ſaid company or fraternity of free-maſons, &amp;c. before his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed election and admiſſion to be a freeman of the ſaid company or fraternity, according to the firſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or bye-law above-mentioned, as he ought to have been.</p>
                  <p>And for theſe reaſons, the ſaid mayor has not ſworn and admitted him, nor adminiſtred the oaths uſually taken for the due execution of the ſaid office.</p>
                  <p>Upon this return, Green takes ſix ſeveral traverſes, on which iſſues were tried.—1ſt iſſue, That the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty, did not duly meet, &amp;c. 8th Nov. 1728, in order to make bye-laws, &amp;c. <hi>modo et</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0782100202:45"/>3d iſſue, That they did not in due manner make the ſecond bye-law mentioned in the return. 4th iſſue, The like denial of their making the third bye-law mentioned in the return. 5th iſſue, That he was elected and admitted a freeman of the ſaid company or fraternity of free-maſons, &amp;c. as in the writ is alledged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6th iſſue, That he was duly called to be a freeman of the ſaid city of Durham and Framwelgate aforeſaid, and was approved by the wardens and ſtewards of the ſaid company to be a freeman of the ſaid city of Durham and Framwelgate.</p>
                  <p>The jury find;—as to the 1ſt iſſue, That upon the 8th of Nov. 1728, the then mayor, aldermen, and commonalty did in due manner meet and aſſemble at, &amp;c. in order, &amp;c. in ſuch manner and form as the ſaid mayor by his return hath alledged.—As to the 2d iſſue, That the ſaid mayor, aldermen, and commonalty did then and there in due manner make the firſt bye-law in the return mentioned, in ſuch manner and form as is therein by the ſaid mayor alledged.—As to the third iſſue, That they did in due manner make the ſecond bye-law in manner and form, &amp;c.—As to the 4th iſſue, The like finding with regard to the third bye-law.— As to the 5th iſſue, That Green was elected and admitted a freeman as in and by the writ is alledged; but that before ſuch his admittance, he was not called at any meeting held according to the ſaid bye-law in the ſaid ſecond iſſue mentioned, nor approved of by the then mayor, and one or more alderman or aldermen, and warden and ſtewards of the ſaid company or fraternity, nor by a majority of them according to the ſaid bye-law.—As to the 6th iſſue, That the ſaid Robert Green was not duly called to be a freeman of the ſaid city of Durham and Framwelgate, and approved of by the wardens and ſtewards of the ſaid company or fraternity of free-maſons, rough-maſons, &amp;c. to be a freeman of the ſaid city of Durham and Framwelgate.</p>
                  <p>This caſe was argued on the 24th of Nov. 1756, by Mr Ambler for the plaintiff, and Mr Clayton for the defendant; when the court ordered it to ſtand for judgment to the then next term: And lord Mansfield then delivered the reſolution of the court—The general queſtion depends upon Robert Green's right to the franchiſe which he claims—The objection to his right ariſes from his not being qualified according to the bye-law—If the bye-law is good and binding, and he appears to be an object of it, he is certainly not quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the mayor has returned a ſufficient reaſon for not admitting and ſwearing him—All the objections which have been made, therefore, tend to ſet aſide the bye-law; or if the bye-law be good, to ſhew that Green's caſe is not within it.—It has been argued, that the bye-law is void upon two grounds; 1ſt, for want of authority to make it; 2dly, from the ſubject matter.—As to the firſt, the objection is, that the bye-laws are returned to be made by the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty; whereas the power is given to the mayor, aldermen, and twenty-four common-council, or the major part of them, of whom the mayor and ſix alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould be ſeven.—ANSWER. The power to the ſelect number is, "To make bye-laws in the ſtead, for, and in the name of the whole corporate body." Theſe bye-laws might be made by the ſelect number, acting in the name of the whole incorporate body, and muſt be ſo intended: For the jury find, "That they did in due manner meet, and in due manner make the bye-laws."—As to the ſecond, That the bye-law is unreaſonable and void: For it is likened to the caſe of the taylors of Ipſwich, (2. Co 53.) a bye-law that none ſhould work at his trade until he had preſented himſelf to the company of taylors, and proved that he had ſerved ſeven years as an apprentice, and admitted by them to be a ſufficient workman.— ANSW. In that caſe the bye-law was againſt law; it was againſt the 5th of Eliz. and a further reſtraint than that act made.—But this bye-law is not againſt any law; it is not a reſtraint upon trade, but ſeems a reaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, to prevent perſons being unduly made free, who are not entitled by birth-right, ſervice, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe; it provides a method for previouſly examining into the right of thoſe who claim to be made free.— OBJECTION. That there is no method to compel a meeting of the mayor, alderman or aldermen, and the wardens and ſtewards of companies.— ANSW. This objection extends equally to all corporate aſſemblies, by cuſtom, charter, or bye-law; but there is a known method by Mandamus.—OBJECT. If a perſon has a right to be admitted a freeman, yet unleſs he be approved of by the mayor, &amp;c. he is not to be admitted; and there is no method to compel them to approve.—ANSW. If the mayor, &amp;c. diſapprove without a cauſe, a Mandamus will lie, ſuggeſting the qualification and right of the perſon claiming to be a freeman, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the mayor to approve and admit. But ſuppoſing the bye-law good, it has been argued that this caſe is not within it.—1ſt OBJECT. The Mandamus is to admit Green to the freedom of the company; the bye-law relates only to the freedom of the city.—ANSW. It appears by the ſecond bye-law to be the ſame thing.—2d OBJECT. The bye-law prohibits, indeed, the election of perſons not called and approved, &amp;c. and ſubjects diſobedience to a penalty; but does not make the election void, and cannot transfer the right of election veſted in the electors to the mayor. —ANSW. Theſe objections are ſounded upon a miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the bye-law, and a miſconception of the nature of the caſe. The writ recites "That Green had been duly elected and admitted a freeman," and therefore commands the mayor to ſwear him—The mayor returns the bye law, &amp;c and that before Green's ſuppoſed election and admittance (by the company) to be a freeman, "he was not called and approved by the mayor, &amp;c." And the fact found by the jury is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

So that it appears upon this record, that the intent of the bye-law was, that no perſon ſhould be elected and admitted a freeman of the company, unleſs he was called at the aſſembly and approved, &amp;c. which was a previous act to be done, before the company could elect him,—the way to prevent the abuſe "That the company unduly admitted perſons to their freedom." The ſecond bye-law inflicts a penalty on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany who ſhould make any one free without the previous calling and approbation. And the third bye-law inflicts a penalty on the mayor who ſhould ſwear any ſuch perſon.—The ſtating the fact anſwers both the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections: For the bye-law makes the appearance and approbation a neceſſary qualification to the being made free by the company; and a reſtraint upon them, to elect any one to his freedom, before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to the bye-law: And the right of election is not transferred to the mayor, but remains where it was.—OBJECT. It is not returned, that there was any aſſembly, at which Green might appear to be called.—ANSW. It ſhall be intended: And if in fact there was no aſſembly, Green might have pleaded it excuſe.—OBJECT. He might have been elected and admitted before the making this bye-law.—ANS. The jury have found, "That he was elected and admitted; but that he was not called and approved purſuant to the bye-law:" So that the bye-law was in being at the time of his election.</p>
                  <p>It is to be obſerved, that it is not ſtated, what is the method of the company's electing freemen, nor any thing in the charter concerning it. For aught that appears, the firſt bye-law may be agreeable to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient uſage, and revived by this bye-law, and enforced by penalties. But ſuppoſing it to be introductory of a previous qualification, it ſeems to be reaſonable, and well calculated to prevent improper perſons, not entitled, being made free. It is much more reaſonable than the cuſtom of London, "that no broad cloth ſhould be ſold but what was brought to Blackwell-Hall to be examined," 5. Co. 62. Yet this cuſtom was held good, becauſe it was to prevent fraud.</p>
                  <p>We are of opinion, that none of the objections are well ſounded, and, therefore, that the return ought to be allowed.—Conſequently, as this was the caſe of traverſing the return to a Mandamu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Penes</hi> G.

                                          <p>The title of ſome of the aldermen was diſputed upon the grounds of their not being inhabitants within Durham or Framwelgate at the time of their elections, which is a qualification required by the charter, and had been diſregarded in the election of aldermen in a variety of inſtances at different periods. Informations in the nature of quo warranto were filed in the court of King's Bench at Weſtminſter, againſt the earl of Darlington, the hon. Frederick Vane, John Tempeſt, <abbr>eſq</abbr> Ra. Bowſer, and John Hopper, who were removed from their office of aldermen either by judgment of ouſter or diſclaimer, and the hon. Gilbert Vane reſigned his office.</p>
                                          <p>The election of the common-council on the 3d of Oct. 1766, was attended with diſorder and confuſion, and miſtakes and irregularities were then committed in the choice of ſome of them, which in their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences affected the title of Mr John Lambe in the office of mayor, to which he was elected the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and on an information in the nature of quo warranto, judgment was obtained againſt him for exerciſing the office of mayor under that election, and from that time there has not been any legal mayor.</p>
                                          <p>By the means before ſtated, and by the natural deaths of Mr Tho. Hornſby and Mr Joſ. Gray, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen are reduced to four, namely, Mr Tho. Dunn reſiding in Elvet, Mr Tho. Bainbridge reſiding in Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Mr John Drake Bainbridge reſiding at Durham, Mr Benj. Whitaker reſiding in America and not likely to return, and who before his departure ſignified his intention to reſign his office of alderman.</p>
                                          <p>In this ſituation, the powers and authorities veſted in the corporation are ſuſpended; and as the charter made a greater number of aldermen than at preſent exiſt eſſential to the election of a mayor and aldermen, I conceive it is impoſſible for the corporation to preſerve or continue itſelf by the operation of the ſtat. of 11th Geo. I. or by any other means.</p>
                                          <p>The expediency of a charter to revive the corporation, is admitted by the petitioners, and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied or doubted.

                                          <p>I conceive your lordſhip is poſſeſſed of <hi>jura regalia</hi> within the county palatine of Durham, ſubject to the prohibitions and reſtrictions contained in the ſtat. of 27th Hen.

               <p>"There is a charitable fund belonging to the city of Durham, for which the mayor and aldermen are truſtees <note n="*" place="bottom">This account was taken by Mr Randal from the papers of Mr John Dixon, late of Durham, deceaſed, an eminent attorney at law.</note>. Mr Henry Smith, the great benefactor of the city of Durham whilſt it ſtood incorporated by the name of aldermen and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, by will dated the 20th of July 1598, gave all his coal-mines, then of the clear yearly value of 100l. beſides a perſonal eſtate in money, debts, and goods, beyond debts and legacies, worth 600l. unto the city of Durham, in theſe words: <q>And as touching my colemynes, and that the increaſe thereof may be employed for the benefit of many, I freely give them all to this city of Durham, and the cauſe why I doe ſoe, and further as followeth is, that ſome good trade may be deviſed for ſetting of the youth and other idle perſons to work, as ſhall be thought moſt convenient, whereby ſome profit may ariſe to the benefit of the ſaid city, and reliefe of thoſe that are paſt work.</q>—Then he gives away ſeveral legacies, and adds, <q>All the reſt that remaineth I fully give and bequeath to this city of Durham, as fully and amply as I have done my colemynes, and to the uſes before expreſſed.</q>—And then appoints one alderman <hi>pro tempore,</hi> Edward Wanles, dyer, and William Hall, draper, his executors, to ſee the ſaid will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and died on the 17th of November 1598. Mr Tho. Pierſon was alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at Mr Smith's death, and, together with Wanles and Hall, entered upon his eſtate, and continued the receipt and management thereof, until Tobias Matthew biſhop of Durham, in the year 1602, incorporated the city by the name of mayor and aldermen, and then the ſucceeding mayors joined with the two executors, in the receipt and management thereof, and ſo it continued until the eighth year of K. James I. when a commiſſion of pious uſes was awarded to William biſhop of Durham, and ſeveral others, upon which an inqueſt was taken, and this charity found and decreed againſt the executors, in whoſe hands it was, and ſeveral perſons were appointed to be the governors thereof, particularly the then biſhop, Richard Hutton, <abbr>eſq</abbr> his temporal chancellor, H. Dethick, H. Ewbanke, Rob. Cooper, and ſeveral others. Thoſe governors (14th Aug. 1612) called the executors to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and found in their hands in ready caſh 577l. 10s. 2d. which they received and lodged in the cheſt in the town chamber, which they had bought for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0782100202:69"/>
under four locks, and there alſo placed the bonds and other ſecurities and writings relating to this charity; and then ordered the New-Place <note n="†" place="bottom">The palace of the Nevill family.</note> to be bought, for a trade of cloth-working to be ſet up in, which was accordingly done, and 150l. paid for the purchaſe thereof.</p>
               <p>In May 1614, Henry Doughty and Wm Baſtoe, clothworkers, were employed to begin the work, and were ſettled in the New-Place; and one Richard Thomlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had by copy of court-roll an aſſignment made him of ſome ground upon Braſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Moor, <hi>de novo incremento,</hi> and incloſed it for the benefit of the works, and 200l. was paid them to provide materials, for which ſum Wm Hall the executor, who had recommended theſe three men, was bound.</p>
               <p>In September 1614 a new commiſſion of pious uſes iſſued, to the ſaid biſhop, chancellor Hutton, and ſeveral other commiſſioners, who approved of what the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors had done, and ordered 250l. more to be advanced to the clothiers, upon the ſtatute-merchant of them and two other ſureties, relations of Doughty and Baſtoe, and upon ſurrender of Tomlinſon's Intack; and ſo the works went forward for about two years, and then Doughty and his partners broke, and the governors took in one William Atkinſon, then maſter of the houſe of correction, to ſpin and employ children that way, and gave him 60l. to buy wool: And alſo in the year 1616 the governor employed Thomas Browne and George Beecrofte, two new clothworkers, and bought them in wool, and gave them it to work, and employed William Hall the executor to be their inſpector; and the work went on but ſlowly and to no great purpoſe, till Jan. 1619, and then was diſcontinued; and inſtead thereof, 20l. per annum was ordered to be paid by 5l. per quarter to the ſeveral ſtreets in Durham, and apprentices were ordered to be bound out, ten or more per annum, as the ſtock ſhould anſwer.</p>
               <p>Thus it hath continued ever ſince, with the addition only of two half yearly pays more to the poor of the ſeveral ſtreets; and in the year 1622, Wydop Leezes and Redmyers Houſe were purchaſed for 660l. at the yearly rent of 50l. per annum, 3l. 6s. 8d. being diſcounted for a copyhold rent payable thereout annually to the biſhop.</p>
               <p>After this the governors put their ſtatute-merchant in ſuit againſt Doughty and Baſtoe's relations, and recovered moſt of the 250l. laſt lent; but all that Hall the executor was bound for, and more which he had got into his hands, amounting to 598l. odd money, was loſt.</p>
               <p>The mayors of Durham, from the diſcontinuing of the laſt clothworking in the year 1619 or 20, again received the money ariſing of the ſtock, and yearly account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it to the governors till the year 1659, and then a treaſurer received it; and ſo it continued during the troubles, and till after the reſtoration, to wit, in Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1669, when a commiſſion of pious uſes was awarded to biſhop Coſin, Dr Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury then dean of Durham, and others, and thereupon an inqueſt was taken, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one John Heighington, who had been mayor of Durham, was found debtor for Smith's charity 414l. and for charities given by others almoſt as much more; but all that was got in ſatisfaction thereof was only the houſe and ſhop in the market-place,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0782100202:70"/>
in Mrs Fulthorpe and alderman Paxton's poſſeſſion, valued at 18l. per ann. called Heighington's Burgage.</p>
               <p>In the year 1659 the receipt of the mayors of Durham was diſcontinued, and a treaſurer appointed to receive and pay out the ſtock as the governors ordered. All the collieries are now failed, and have ſo been for many years paſt, ſo that all the ſtock <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <p>Linſell biſhop of Hereford and prebendary of Durham gave by will "for the uſe of the poor people of the city of Durham 100l. to be placed out at intereſt, or lands to be purchaſed therewith."</p>
                     <p>F. Buney by his will dated 20th Jan. 1626, gave to the city of Durham "20l. to be lent to poor men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, by five marks a-piece upon good ſecurity, to be paid at the year's end."</p>
                     <p>Mr Walton archdeacon of Derby gave "to the city of Durham 40l. to be lent gratis to poor tradeſmen by 5l. a-piece for four years together."</p>
                     <p>Dr Hartwell, by will dated 9th March 1724, gave to the corporation of the city of Durham "20l. a-year, to be diſpoſed of to two merchants or tradeſmen of the eſtabliſhed church, 10l. each, that have ſerved out their time in the ſaid city, and want ſome aſſiſtance to ſet up with; which perſons the mayor and ſix alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or more, are unanimouſly to pitch upon, without favour to any but thoſe that ſtand in moſt need of it. And that this benevolence may have its full effect, as deſigned by me, it ſhall be in the power of the mayor and all the reſiding aldermen to beſtow the whole 20l. on any one perſon whom they ſhall judge in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to deſerve it, by the narrowneſs of his circumſtances. Moreover, the ſaid 20l. per ann. is not to be paid but to the perſon or perſons themſelves, choſen by the mayor and aldermen of Durham, according to the limitations herein named, who are to certify their choice under their hands to the truſtees of this part of my laſt will and teſtament."—This charity is chargeable on lands at</p>
                     <p>Lord Crewe gave 100l. a year, as mentioned in page 560 of the firſt volume of this work, for putting out poor children apprentices to ſuch trades as the mayor and aldermen ſhould appoint.</p>

               <head>THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH.</head>
               <p>HAVING ſhewn the government of the city, and privileges of the incorporated body, we beg leave to call the reader's attention to the hiſtory and deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the cathedral church.</p>
               <p>In the preceding volume, under the annals of the biſhops, are ſhewn the origin and foundation of this rich church, which renders it unneceſſary now to revert to many of the facts there ſtated.</p>
               <p>The reader will recollect, that in the firſt inſtitution this church was ſerved by ſecular clergy, who are ſaid to have been governed by a provoſt. Biſhop Walcher firſt projected a change, intending to introduce regular canons, but did not live to effect his purpoſe. His ſucceſſor, William de Carilepho, in the year 1083 ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed that matter, aided by the power of the crown, under the influence of the See of Rome. He applied to pope Gregory the Seventh for his precept or licence, on which he grounded his charter<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. notes vol. i. p. 133, where an extract from this charter is given.</note>, thereby declaring he granted the ſame by the command and council of the holy See, and that the king was preſent at the time of making thereof; and ordained, that all future priors of the church at Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham ſhould poſſeſs the liberties, dignities, and honours of abbots, with the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot's ſeat in the choir of the church; and to hold all their lands, churches, and poſſeſſions in their own hands and free diſpoſition, ſo as the revenues thereof might thereby be increaſed as much as poſſible, exempted from royal cuſtoms<note n="†" place="bottom">Lel. Col. vol. ii. p. 384.—Wharton's Anglia Sacra, p. 785.—Dugdale's Monaſt. Angl. vol. i. p. 42.</note>. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the king's diploma to maintain and ſupport his charter, dated in the year 1084, eſtabliſhing the removal of the ſecular clergy from his epiſcopal church, and tranſlating thither monks from Jarrow and Weremouth monaſteries, who were of the order of St Auguſtine; by which inſtrument the king ordained, that all priors of that monaſtery ſhould poſſeſs the ſame liberties, cuſtoms, dignities, and honours, as abbots <note n="‡" place="bottom">See vol. i. p. 135. for this record.—Monaſt. Ang. vol. i. p. 44.</note>; to hold the left-hand ſeat in the choir; have full power of appointing and removing the officers of the church; ſimilar to the authority of a dean, have the firſt place and voice after the biſhop; when in chapter, the firſt voice in all elections to the See; and, whatever dignities and honours the dean of York held, inferior to the archbiſhop, but ſuperior to the archdeacon, the prior of Durham ſhould equally hold in inferiority to his prelate, but in ſuperiority of the archdeacon. By this inſtrument, the king alſo confirmed whatever the biſhop had granted to his convent; and declared his protection of the monaſtery and its poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as well thoſe then enjoyed, as whatever ſhould thereafter be acquired by the money of St Cuthbert or otherwiſe, with <hi>ſac.</hi> and <hi>ſocne, tol</hi> and <hi>team,</hi> and <hi>infangeon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theof,

               <p>The ſeculars, though removed from the ſeat of dignity, were not ſent abroad unprovided for, ſeveral places being prepared for their reſidence, as will be ſhewn in the courſe of this work.</p>
               <p>Not content with ſolely accompliſhing ſo great a reformation, this prelate gave to the monaſtery, Rennington, the two Pittingtons, Heſſelton, Dalton, Merrington, Shincliff, and Elvet; with Willington and Wall's-End north of Tyne, together with the churches of Lindisfarn, the adjacent villages of Fenham, Norham, and Skirworth, with divers churches in Yorkſhire; and other donations were added by the king, among which are lands in Keverſton and Gretham.</p>
               <p>After the biſhop's return from exile, he furniſhed the altar with various veſſels and ornaments of gold and ſilver, and gave to the convent a large collection of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable books <note n="‡" place="bottom">Lel.

It would be an unprofitable labour in this place to note the ſeveral gifts of lands, as the whole poſſeſſions of the church appear in the endowment after the Reformation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0782100202:75"/>The biſhop, conceiving the church built by his predeceſſors was not of ſuitable magnificence to the dignity and increaſing power of the See, formed a plan for a new erection, ſimilar to the ſuperb ſtructures he had ſeen on the continent; and in the year 1093 he began to erect the ſtately edifice, now the ſubject of our attention. Though the art of making glaſs was introduced from France in the beginning of the ſeventh century, and Eddius, who wrote the life of Wilfrid, and lived about the year 720, aſſerts, that he glazed the windows of the church of York when he repaired that edifice, yet we have no proofs to maintain the aſſertion. It is probable that the uſe of glaſs prevailed greatly when our prelate began this work. The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal form of the windows was of the circular arch, ſimilar to the galleries above the ailes, and they were conſtructed for glazing. Glaſs windows introduced great embelliſhments in public edifices, as the uſe of ſtucco and plaiſtering ſucceeded that improvement; before which the inſides of the walls were regularly chiſſelled and poliſhed; which circumſtance has contributed greatly to the permanency of ancient buildings, the inſide ſurface being as exactly compacted as the outſide. The large windows introduced in this building are apparently of a faſhion and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brication more modern than the eleventh century, their pointed arches in nowiſe correſponding with the mode which is adopted through the greateſt part of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient edifice, that kind of arch being, as our beſt authors agree, introduced ſince the reign of Henry II. The annexed plate, taken from as accurate a drawing as perhaps was ever given to the public, will ſave much deſcription, and convey to the reader the moſt perfect idea of this fabric before the repairs and embelliſhments now carrying on were begun. In the plates given in the Monaſticon, the weſtern towers are ornamented with ſpires, which went to decay, and were removed many years ago. In Willis's Cathedrals is a beautiful plate of the north front, dedicated to biſhop Talbot, but the drawing is contracted and inaccurate.</p>
               <p>The foundation of the church was laid on the 11th of Aug. 1093, with a ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſuited to ſo great and pious a work, the biſhop being aſſiſted therein by Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm king of Scotland, and Turgot the prior: But the prelate departing this life in the year 1095<note n="*" place="bottom">

                                 <p>On the ſouth ſide of the cloyſters, was faſtened to the wall at the ſide of the cloyſter door, a ſeat, having four feet and a back of wood, and boarded under foot for warmth: On this the porter was ſeated, to keep the cloyſter door. The laſt porter was Edward Pattiſon. From the ſtool weſtward, on the ſouth ſide, was a long bench of ſtone, almoſt to the Frater-houſe door, whereon were ſeated certain children in a row, upon Maunday Thurſday, it being intended for that purpoſe. The whole convent of monks had each a boy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him, whoſe feet he was to waſh and dry with a towel, and every monk then kiſſed the feet he had waſhed, and gave to each child thirty pence in money, ſeven red herrings, three loaves of bread, and a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer cake, ſerving every child with drink themſelves: This godly ceremony thus ended; after prayers ſaid by the prior and convent, they all departed in good decorum. At the end of the bench adjoining to the Frater-houſe door, was a fine almery fixed to the wall, and another on the other ſide of the door; the fore part of the almeries was through-carved work, to admit air to the towels, and three doors in the fore part of each almery, and a lock on each, to which every monk had a key, to dry their hands with the towels when they waſhed and went to dinner. This ſtool and bench Tobias Matthew, then dean of Durham, cauſed to be taken down, and made as plain as the reſt of the floor of the cloyſters.</p>

                                 <p>In the ſouth alley of the cloyſters, is a large hall, called the Frater-houſe, finely wainſcotted on the north and ſouth ſides; and in the weſt and nether part thereof, is a long bench of ſtone, in maſon-work, from the cellar door to the pantry or cove door: Above the bench is wainſcot-work two yards and a half high, finely carved, ſet with emboſſed work in wainſcot, and gilded under the carved work. Above the wainſcot was a large picture of our Saviour Chriſt, the bleſſed Virgin, and St John, in fine gilt work, and moſt excellent colours; which pictures having been waſhed over with lime, did long appear through it. This wainſcot had engraven on the top of it, Thomas Caſtell, prior, anno Domini 1518, menſis Julij. Whence it is manifeſt, that prior Caſtell wainſcotted the Frater-houſe.</p>
                                 <p>Within the Frater-houſe door, on the left-hand at entering, is a ſtrong almery in the wall, wherein a great mazer, called the grace-cup, ſtood, which every day ſerved the monks after grace, to drink out of round the table; the cup was finely edged about with ſilver, and double gilt. In the ſame place were kept many large and great mazers of the ſame ſort; among which was one called Judas's cup, edged about with ſilver, and double gilt, having a baſe to ſtand upon of ſilver double gilt: This was never in uſe but on Maundy Thurſday, at night, when the prior and convent met to keep their Maundy. In the ſame almery was a goodly cup, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led St Bede's bowl; the outſide was of black mazer, the inſide of ſilver double gilt, and the edge finely wrought with ſilver, and double gilt; in the midſt was the picture of the holy St Bede, ſitting in a writing poſture; the baſe thereof of ſilver, double gilt, with four joints of ſilver coming down, all double gilt from the edge to the baſe to be taken in pieces. In that almery lay all the beſt plate that ſerved the whole convent in the Frater-houſe on feſtival days; and there was a fine work of carved wainſcot, and a ſtrong lock on the door, ſo that none could perceive there was any almery at all, the key-hole being made under the carved work of the wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot: And there is another large a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Every monk had his mazer to himſelf to drink in, and all other things that ſerved the whole convent, and the Frater-houſe, in their daily ſervice, at their diet, and at their table. All the mazers were finely edged with double gilt ſilver, and another baſon and ewer of latten. On this ewer was pourtrayed a man on horſeback, as riding a-hunting, which ſerved the ſub-prior to waſh his hands in at the aforeſaid table, he ſitting there as chief.</p>
                                 <p>In this Frater-houſe the prior and whole convent of the monks held the great feaſt of St Cuthbert, in Lent, having their meat ſerved out of the dreſſer-window of the great kitchen into the Frater-houſe, and their drink out of the great cellar. From the eaſt end, being the higheſt of the Frater-houſe, adjoining to the deanery, the roof of lead was taken down by dean Whittingham, and that part annexed to his own houſe, making it a flat roof, whereby he gained twenty pounds.</p>
                                 <p>At the eaſt end of the Frater-houſe ſtood a neat table, with a ſcreen of wainſcot over it, being kept for the maſter of the novices, the elects, and the novices, to dine and ſup at, having their meat ſerved to them in at the dreſſer widow from the great kitchen, and their drink out of the great cellar.</p>
                                 <p>At theſe times the maſter obſerved theſe wholeſome and godly orders, for the continual inſtruction of their youth in virtue and learning; that is, one of the novices, appointed by the maſter, read ſome part of the Old and New Teſtament in Latin, during dinner, having a convenient place at the ſouth end of the high table,

On Aldwine's death, Turgot, with the general aſſent of the prelate and monaſtery, was elected prior of Durham in the year 1087, the office of archdeacon being annexed to that dignity. The monaſtery profited greatly by his prudent government; the privileges were enlarged, and revenues conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably increaſed by his influence; and he promoted many improvements in the ſacred edifices.

After filling the office of prior with great dignity and piety for near twenty years, he was elected biſhop of St Andrew's and primate of Scotland in 1107, and conſecrated by archbiſhop Thomas, at York, on the 1ſt of Auguſt, 1109<note n="†" place="bottom">Ang. bac. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                    <head>The CUSTOM of BURYING PRIORS.</head>
                                    <p>The priors of the houſe of Durham were accuſtomed in ancient time to be buried in their boots, and wound in their cowls by the barber, as the monks uſed to be buried. The dead prior was carried out of his lodgings in the priory, to the chamber in the infirmary, called the Dead Man's Chamber, there to remain a certain time: At night he was carried into a chapel oppoſite to that chamber door, called St Andrew's Chapel, and was watched all that night by the children of the almery, reading David's pſalms over him; and two monks either of kindred or kindneſs, were appointed to ſit all night at his feet, mourning for him. In the morning he was carried into the chapter-houſe, where the ſame ſolemn ſervice was performed for him, which the monks had at their burial; thence he was carried through the parlour into the centry-garth to be buried, where every prior lay under a ſine marble ſtone: And the monks and barber buried him with a little chalice of ſilver, other metal, or wax, which was laid upon his breaſt within the coffin, and his blue bed was held over him by four monks till he was buried, which the barber had for his pains, for making the grave and burying him, as he had for the monks.</p>
                                    <p>Afterwards the priors were buried within the church, and not in the centry-garth, in the ſame order and habit, with the mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>After Turgot's departure for the See of St Andrew's, unhappy diſſentions took place between the monaſtery and biſhop Flambard; no prior was appointed for a conſiderable time; and the duties of archdeacon, official, and vicar-general, were ſevered from the office of prior: The biſhop alſo poſſeſſed himſelf of ſeveral of the conventual eſtates, as lands beyond the bridge which he built, called Framwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate or Durham bridge, Staindrop, Blakiſton, lands in Wolviſton and Burdon, and the church of Siggeſton.</p>
                  <p>Before we advance further in the hiſtory of this church, it is neceſſary to obſerve, that the monks tranſlated thither were of the Benedictine order. They followed the rules of St Benedict, who was born at Norſi, in the dukedom of Spoletto, in Italy, about the year 480, and died about 543. But his rule ſeems not to have been confirmed till 52 years after his death, when pope Gregory the Great gave a ſanction to it. The habit of theſe monks was a black looſe coat, or a gown of ſtuff reaching down to their heels, with a cowl or hood of the ſame, and a ſcapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0782100202:79"/>
and under that, a white habit, as large as the former, made of flannel, with boots on their legs; and from the colour of their outward habit, they were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally called Black monks. This rule was introduced into England in king Edgar's time, but never perfectly obſerved till after the Conqueſt. Of this order were all our cathedral priories, except Carliſle and moſt of the richeſt abbeys in England.</p>
                  <p>The Benedictines were obliged to perform their devotion ſeven times within four-and-twenty hours <note n="*" place="bottom">Concord. Regular, collected by St Benedict, and publiſhed with a comment by Friar Aenard 1638.— Fuller's Ch. Hiſt. lib. vi. p. 287.—Collier's Ecc. Hiſt. lib. ii. p. 107.</note>. At cock-crowing, or the NOCTURNAL: This ſervice was performed at two o'clock in the morning: The reaſon for pitching upon this hour, is taken partly from David's ſaying, <hi>At midnight I will praiſe the Lord,</hi> and partly from a tradition of our Saviour's riſing from the dead about that time. MATINS: Theſe were ſaid at the firſt hour, or, according to our computation, at ſix o'clock: At this time the Jewiſh morning ſacrifice was offered: The angels likewiſe were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have acquainted the women with our Saviour's reſurrection about this hour. The TIERCE; which was at nine in the morning, when our Saviour was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſcourged by Pilate. The SEXTE, or twelve at noon.

VESPERS, at ſix in the afternoon: The evening ſacrifice was then offered in the Jewiſh temple; and our Saviour is ſuppoſed to have been taken down from the croſs at this hour. The COMPLINE: This ſervice was performed after ſeven, when our Saviour's agony in the garden, it is believed, begun. The monks going to bed at eight, had ſix hours to ſleep before the Nocturnal began: If they went to bed after that ſervice, it was not, as we underſtand, reckoned a fault; but after mattins they were not allowed that liberty. At the tolling of the bell for prayers, the monks were immediately to leave off their buſineſs; and herein the canon was ſo ſtrict, that thoſe who copied books, or were clerks in any buſineſs, and had begun a text letter, were not allowed to finiſh it. Thoſe who were employed abroad about the buſineſs of the houſe, were preſumed to be preſent, and excuſed other duties; and that they might not ſuffer by being elſewhere, they were parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly recommended to the divine protection. The monks were obliged to go al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways two together; this was done to guard their conduct, to prompt them to good thoughts, and furniſh them with a witneſs to defend their behaviour. From Eaſter to Whitſuntide the primitive church obſerved no faſts; at other times the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious were bound to faſt till three o'clock on Wedneſdays and Fridays; but the twelve days in Chriſtmas were excepted in this canon. Every day in Lent they were enjoined to faſt till ſix in the evening: During this ſolemnity, they ſhortened their refreſhment, allowed fewer hours for ſleep, and ſpent more time in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions; but they were not permitted to go into voluntary auſterities, without leave from the abbot. They were not to talk in the refectory at meals, but hearken to the ſcriptures read to them at that time. The Septimarians, ſo called from their weekly offices of readers, waiters, cooks, &amp;c. were to dine by themſelves, after the reſt. Thoſe who were abſent about buſineſs, had the ſame hours of prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0782100202:80"/>
though not the ſame length of devotions. Thoſe ſent abroad, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to return at night, were forbidden to eat till they came home: But this canon was ſometimes diſpenſed with. The Compline was to be ſolemnly ſung about ſeven at night: The ſervice concluded with this verſe, <hi>Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and keep the door of my lips.</hi> After this ſervice the monks were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to talk, but went to bed immediately. They were all to ſleep in the ſame dormitory, but not two in a bed: They lay in their cloaths. For ſmall faults they were excluded the public table; but for greater, were debarred religious commerce, and the ſervice of the chapel: And thoſe converſing with a perſon under ſuch cenſure, were liable to the ſame puniſhment. Incorrigible criminals were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the monaſteries. When a brother was again received after expulſion, he loſt his ſeniority, and was placed the laſt in the convent. Every monk was to have two coats and two cowls; and when they had new cloaths, their old ones were given to the poor: Each had a table-book, a knife, a needle, and a handkerchief: The furniture of the bed was a mat, blanket, rug, and pillow. The ſuperior was never to dine alone; ſo, when there were no ſtrangers, he was to invite ſome of his brethren to his table.—Such were the regulations of this monaſtery.</p>

                  <p>Hugh Pudſey, after the example of his predeceſſors, was deſirous of contributing to the beauty and magnificence of the church at Durham, and projected a ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous addition towards the eaſt. The only author who mentions this, is Geoffrey de Coldingham <note n="‡" place="bottom">Wharton's Ang. Sac. p. 722, 723.</note>, who tells us, that he began to erect a new work at the eaſt end of the church, for which he imported from abroad marble columns and baſes; but having laid the foundations, and carried up the walls to ſome conſiderable height, employing the moſt ſkilful artiſts therein, the building repeatedly failed and ſhrunk, to the imminent peril of the workmen; which ſufficiently indicated to him, that the intended work was not acceptable to Heaven and St Cuthbert: So that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted therefrom, and built the Gallilee at the weſt end of the church, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of women; where they might have the benefit of the holy offices, being otherwiſe debarred from the ſolemnities. It doth not appear the marble columns were placed in the Gallilee. It muſt be obſerved in this place, that the eaſtern tranſept of the church is rather a ſingularity, and was not built near the time of the other parts; the architecture throughout the whole being different. Great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in architecture were made, from the aera of the foundation by biſhop William, to the time of biſhop Pudſey's death: The more elegant Gothic order

took place of the Saxon, and the pointed arches came in uſe: All the windows of this part of the edifice, in the lower arrangement to the eaſt, are pointed: The cluſtered pilaſters are chiefly of marble, though ſhamefully defaced and bedaubed with a waſh of lime and ochre: There are no marble pilaſters in any other part of the church, or any of the like order of maſonry. Although no hiſtorian tells us who finiſhed this work, yet that it was begun by biſhop Pudſey is certain, and left by him unfiniſhed for reaſons hid in ſuperſtitious allegory; probably it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in the time of biſhop Farnham and prior Thomas Melſonby. The Gallilee, ſaid to be built by biſhop Pudſey, doth not appear to be wholly a new erection; it is probable he improved it, and appropriated the place to the pious purpoſe before aſcribed to it: It is formed with a triple range of pillars, ſo as to divide it into five ailes, nearly of equal width; the arches are circular, and ornamented with zigzag mouldings; the pillars are light, and cluſtered; above the arches is a dead facing or wall, which goes up to the roof, without any apparent utility, and far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ornamental; the windows are pointed. It is noted to us, that a certain part of the moſt ancient churches had a place called the Gallilee, where the proceſſions ended <note n="*" place="bottom">

In the ſecond year of the epiſcopacy of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard de Mariſco a reconciliation took place between the prelate and monaſtery, and the biſhop by his charter confirmed to the prior and convent all the liberties and privileges granted to them by biſhop William de Carilepho; and as an additional bounty, appropriated to them the church of Dalton, (alias Datton) for the better ſupport of their houſe, and alſo confirmed the appropriations of the churches of Aycliff and Pittington.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1228 Richard Poor was tranſlated to the See: He lived on terms of amity with the monaſtery, entering into a convention with the prior and convent, for preventing future diſputes with their biſhops, quieting their poſſeſſions, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaining their privileges <note n="†" place="bottom">

                  <p>was elected prior in 1233; and on the deceaſe of biſhop Richard, in the year 1237, was nominated to ſucceed him, and with much reluctance ſubmitted to the choice. He was objected to by the king, who alledged many things againſt him of a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal nature <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. i. p. 204.</note>, and others perſonal: <q>That he was an infringer of the liberties of the church, was diſeaſed in body, had broken his vow, and diſregarded religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, particularly the ordained faſts; that he was guilty of ſimony, was il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate,</q> and ſuch like charges, equally ſlanderous and untrue. After ſuch an oppoſition, unwilling the See ſhould longer continue vacant, he renounced his elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and biſhop Farnham ſucceeded. Fearful of the king's reſentment, he reſigned his office in the year 1244, and retired to Farne iſland, where in acts of piety and charity he ſpent the remainder of his life. His body was brought to Durham to be interred. In the year 1242 the prior, with the approbation and aſſiſtance of the biſhop, began to remove the whole of the old roof from the cathedral church, and gave this noble edifice the additional elegance of a vault of ſtone-work. Willis aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes this work to the biſhop in theſe words: <q>Biſhop Farnham, (temp. Hen. III.) vaulted over the roof of the church with ſtone.</q> Whoever pays due attention to the mode of architecture in this part of the edifice, will eaſily diſcover that the roof of the choir and eaſtern tranſept are of ſimilar workmanſhip. Grayſtanes, who was a monk of Durham, and lived within a century of the time we are ſpeaking of, is moſt to be credited; and his words are, <q>Anno Domini <hi>1242,</hi> incoepit Thomas prior novam fabricam eccleſiae circum feſtum S.

Againſt this contract our prior appealed, alledging, that he and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent were at all times ready to obey the pope in things lawful and practicable; but to ſpoil their churches of their goods, to ſubvert their liberties, and ſtraiten their maintenance, would be ſuch an indignity to the church, ſcandal to the clergy, and reproach to religion itſelf, that they never could aſſent thereto. It cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but this reply would prove offenſive, as well to the See of Rome as the crown of England; and in 1258 we ſee the prior reſigning his dignity, though the hiſtorians of that time do not immediately expreſs it to be in conſequence of ſuch diſpleaſure. On the 17th of the calends of Auguſt the prior petitioned the convent to admit of his reſignation, and that they would provide a maintenance for his retirement, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging at once his want of conſtitutional abilities to execute the duties of his high office, and alſo the ſervices he had undergone in forty years monaſtic life, fourteen of which he had been prior; he aſſerted, he had obtained a bull for his diſmiſſion, but would not uſe its authority. Meſſengers were accordingly ſent to the biſhop with his requiſition, who in return commanded his commiſſioners to hear the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, and they by virtue of their authority admitted the ſame, and committed the care of the ſpiritualties of the monaſtery to the ſub-prior, and the temporalties to R. de Waltham, conſtable of the caſtle. The convent aſſigned to Bertram for his maintenance, the churches of Pittington, Heighington, &amp;c. Notwithſtanding the great work he had carried on in the church for two years, he left to his ſucceſſor in the conventual treaſury 11,000 marks. He was not only a zealous churchman, giving up his life to acts of piety, but alſo a punctual maintainer of the rights of the monaſtery. He left to the monaſtic library many of his compoſitions and learned works. His name was held in pious veneration by the cloiſter. His frugality was manifeſted in his management of the revenue allotted him, for therewith he not only ſupplied the neceſſities of life, but was enabled to build at Beaurepaire a lodge or ſummer retreat, with a chapel, not inferior in elegance to other erections of the like nature in the dioceſe.</p>

He contributed greatly to the magnificence of his convent. He built the belfry on the ſummit of the great tower of the cathedral church, and enlarged the organ: He alſo emparked Muggleſwick and Beaurepaire. At Wardelau, as one author writes, he erected a lodge or camera, a hall and chapel, which were afterwards deſtroyed by the Scots in their incurſion: He built a lodge or camera at Muggleſwick; the remains of which, and alſo that at Beaurepaire, will be deſcribed in the progreſs of this work <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 741.</note>. In this prior's time, a bull was obtained from the pope for the appropriation of Hoveden church for an addition of ſixteen monks; but, at a conſiderable expence, he procured the appointment to be converted into prebends, apprehending they would prove as honourable and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous promotions, and as acceptable to the clergy whom he wiſhed to ſerve, as if the original inſtitution was maintained.

It is ſaid of him, that the common coinage of a denarius or penny was reduced to five mites, that he might diſtribute handfuls of that ſmall money to a greater number of objects. When advanced in years, and obliged to travel in a chariot, he conſtantly threw money from thence to the poor. He was a perſon of approved wiſdom, as well as of a magnificent mind. Frequent applications were made to the biſhop to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his reſignation, pleading his infirmities and age, which in the event produced an altercation between the convent and prelate concerning profeſſion of obedience by the monks <note n="‖" place="bottom">

                     </note>, the convent alledging their prior was not of the ſame rank with others, he having the privileges of an abbot, and the monk's profeſſion was the right of an abbot. But at length the convent agreed, that the monks ſhould firſt make profeſſion to the prior and then to the prelate, and receive his ſolemn bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: Whereupon they ſent meſſengers to the biſhop, that they were willing

to make their profeſſion and receive his benediction; but the buſineſs was ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, on account of ſome formalities which remained unſettled, until the 10th of January, when the biſhop in the chapter-houſe accepted the prior's reſignation, and the manors of Wardelau (according to our author's words) and Muggleſwick were aſſigned for his maintenance; the biſhop added Ryton thereto. Theſe affairs being ſettled, a converſation took place between one of the monks and the biſhop, in which the biſhop complained with warmth that "he had ſuffered greater indignity and diſreſpect than any of his predeceſſors;" but declared, "he would ſeek ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in God's good time." He had ſcarce departed the gates before his ſeneſcal, with the conſtable of the caſtle and their officers, entered the convent, pronouncing, that they came at the prelate's command, in his place, to have cuſtody of the houſe during the vacancy of the office of prior. The next day the ſeneſcal, calling the ſub-prior and other officers of the houſhold into the hall, commanded the porters, the marſhal, and other ſecular ſervants of the monaſtery, to come forth, ſaying, the houſe was in the cuſtody of the lord biſhop, therefore he deſired to ſee who were proper to take care of it, that he might take their oaths of fidelity, remove thoſe he did not approve, and ſubſtitute others in their places.

When the monks ſaid the inſtrument was in the uſual form, he contradicted them, aſſerting, that after the death of prior Thomas, his predeceſſor biſhop Farnham for the ſame cauſe rejected the conventual petition. On the return of the meſſengers, many of the convent recollected that the cauſe of ſuch precedented rejection was not as alledged by the biſhop; for in the inſtrument referred to, the biſhop was addreſſed as father and patron in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties and temporalties, but the ſeal of the convent by accident had been ſeparated from the inſtrument before it came to the prelate's hands, which occaſioned it to be renewed before he granted his licence. It was accordingly ſet forth in the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on this ſubject, that as the biſhop was in fact patron of the church, no reaſon appeared why he ſhould not be addreſſed as ſuch in their proceſs; which was aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to.

                  <head>RICHARD CLAXTON,</head>
                  <p>prior of the cell of Holy Iſland, was elected prior of Durham on the 26th of Jan. 1273, and in the 12th of the pontificate of biſhop Stichill; on the ſecond day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing he was confirmed at Darlington, was inſtalled by the archdeacon of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham on the day of the purification of the Virgin Mary, and three days afterwards confirmed the proviſion made for his predeceſſor on his reſignation. Before the above inſtance, we are not told by any hiſtorian of the priors having the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of confirmation and inſtallation, though it is probable it was an ancient uſage here. The prior abdicated his office on the 27th of December, 1285: No reaſon is aſſigned by our author for this act, who tells us, that the prior was not only a man of great piety and hoſpitality, but of ſtrict circumſpection and attention touching the rights of the monaſtery; and notwithſtanding the great proviſion made for prior Hugh, and the expenſive litigations proſecuted between the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of York and his church, the convent abounded in wealth during his whole adminiſtration. He had aſſigned him for maintenance the cell of Weremouth, with the tithes of Southwick. In May, 1274, pope Gregory IV. held a council at Lyons, to which the prior was called, but did not attend, having only his proctors there: Biſhop Stichill dying in that year, the archbiſhop during the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of the See appointed a viſitation to be held in the chapter-houſe at Durham the day before the vigil of All-Saints, which was ſubmitted to at that time; after which ceremony the archbiſhop repaired to the caſtle, where he was entertained, Henry de Horncaſtre, then ſacriſt of the cathedral church of Durham, bearing the

Robert de Grayſtanes gives an inſtance of the authority of the prior, which ſhews one of the ancient cuſtoms of the monaſtery, viz. <q>That biſhop Stichill, whilſt he was reſident in the caſtle at Durham, made it his cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to ſend wine to the convent: One day he ordered his butler to carry wine to the ſub-prior's table, which on being preſented gave offence to prior Hugh, who preſided at the upper table, and thereupon he ſtruck the table, and put an end to dinner in the middle of the meſs<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 746, 747.</note>.</q>

That author tells us, the prior came to an agreement with the archbiſhop of York, aſſenting to his exerciſe of juriſdiction over the churches of the dioceſe during a vacancy of the See of Durham, as appears by an inſtrument in writing, dated in the year 1286, on which all preceding cenſures and judicial ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences touching that matter were reſcinded. He ſays, the prior before his ſecond abdication was in a ſuperannuated ſtate of mind, yet ſo obſtinate and reſentful, that when application was made for his removal on account of his incapacity, he ſent meſſengers to the biſhop, with a promiſe of large bribes, to induce him to deny his ſuſpenſion, which did not prevail; whereupon he yielded with great reluctance to a ceſſion of his office.</p>

This prior was of a bold and virtuous mind, and having to do with the overbearing and proud prelate Bek, was obliged to exert himſelf for the preſervation of the privileges of his church: A diſpute ſoon aroſe between them, which was fermented to a violent height, as has already been related in the annals of that prelate<note n="‖" place="bottom">Vol. i. p. 244.</note>; the excommunication, ſuſpenſion, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the prior being at length the conſequence of their conteſt.

                  <p>In the year 1303, on the day of St Peter <hi>ad Vincula,</hi> prior Hotoun returned to Durham, and was received moſt cordially by the convent, who held a feſtival on the occaſion: An inquiſition was afterwards taken by men of the county of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland touching the damages ſuſtained by the convent under the biſhop's perſecution, by the ſeizure of their revenues and deſtruction of their parks, in which the biſhop employed the moſt able advocates the kingdom afforded, whilſt the prior's cauſe was managed by one only, whoſe name was William de Herle, and whom Grayſtanes perpetuates; when the biſhop was juſtly condemned in a large ſum of money. The pope dying ſoon after, the biſhop obtained from his ſucceſſor a bull, requiring the archbiſhop of Canterbury and the biſhops of Lincoln and Wincheſter to viſit the chapter of Durham, on an accuſation lodged againſt the prior for dilapidations and divers offences, touching which the prelates were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

The prior, on his journey to Rome for redreſs, paſſed the winter near Canterbury, ſending from thence two monks of his convent, as proctors: Whilſt he remained there, the biſhop committed the care of the monaſtery to Luceby; and the abbot of Leiceſter with the pope's mandatory letters accompanied him to Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, to give him poſſeſſion; but on their arrival, they ſound the gates ſhut againſt them, and their admittance refuſed; on which, they pronounced an excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation againſt the whole ſociety: This brought on a litigation, at the inſtance of the prior, for an offence againſt the crown, on their preſuming to execute the powers of the See of Rome in matters temporal, and a grievous ſine was impoſed upon the offenders.</p>
                  <p>The prior returned from the South to meet the king at Durham, and on the feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tival of St Oſwald the martyr, celebrated maſs in the royal preſence at the altar of St Oſwald. The king granted him licence to viſit Rome, and recommendatory letters to the pope for redreſs, with which he paſſed into Italy, but did not live to return: He met with a favourable reception from the pope and college, and on the 24th of October obtained a ſentence of reſtitution, but was decreed to pay one thouſand marks to the apoſtolical chamber for the ſame. On the 9th of Jan. (Grayſtanes ſays in the year 1307, but from other authorities in 1308) the prior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this life; and that the See of Rome might be indemnified for the loſs of the fine, all his goods, plate, books, horſes, and effects then in Italy, were confiſcated.</p>
                  <p>Prior Hotoun was not deficient in public works, notwithſtanding the troubles in which he was embarraſſed: He compleated the manor-houſe of Houghhall; with the biſhop's licence he purchaſed Oxford Place, afterwards called Durham College, and made the firſt erections there <note n="†" place="bottom">

called Beaurepaire or Bearpark. The convent received a grant of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warren in their territories at Winſton about this time.</p>
                  <p>During this prior's office, the diſpute which aroſe between Ralph lord Nevill, of Raby, and the convent, in the time of prior Claxton, was continued, and did not ſubſide for ſeveral years. The account we have of it is to the following effect, as given by Dugdale in his Baronage, vol. i. p. 292.</p>
                  <p>"About the 13 Edw. I. 1285, there was much variance between the inhabitants of the biſhopric of Durham and Anthony Beke (that great prelate) then biſhop of Durham, by reaſon he had compelled them to go twice into Scotland with horſe and arms, which they alledged to be contrary to right, in regard they held their lands to defend the body of St Cuthbert; and that they ought not, either for king or biſhop, to go beyond the rivers of Tyne and Tees. Ralph Nevill, then lord of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, was the chief countenancer of thoſe who oppoſed the biſhop. Not long after, another diſpute aroſe between this Ralph and Hugh de Derlyngton then prior of Durham, about the offering of a ſtag every year upon St Cuthbert's day in Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; which (in truth) was rather a rent than an oblation, in regard he held Raby with the eight adjoining townſhips, by the yearly rent of four pounds and a ſtag. For contrary to the cuſtom of his anceſtors, he not only required, that the prior of Durham, at the offering of the ſtag, ought to feaſt him and all the company he ſhould bring, but that the prior's own menial ſervants ſhould for that time be ſet aſide, and his peculiar ſervants and officers put in their ſtead. Whereupon amongſt other of his gueſts he invited John de Baliol of Barnard Caſtle, who refuſed to go with him, alledging, that he never knew the Nevills to have ſuch a privilege there; Sir Wm de Brompton, the biſhop's chief-juſtice, likewiſe acknowledging, that he himſelf was the firſt who began that extravagant practice; for being a young man, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in hunting, he came with the lord Nevill at the offering of the ſtag, and ſaid to his companions, "Come let us go into the abbey and wind our horns," and ſo they did. The prior farther adding, that before the time of this Ralph, none of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors ever made any ſuch claim, but when they brought the ſtag into the hall they had only a breakfaſt; nor did the lord himſelf ever ſtay dinner, except he was invited.</p>
                  <p>In the 5 Edw. III. 1331, Ralph Nevill (ſon of the former) doing his fealty to William de Couton then prior of Durham, upon Lammas-day, for the manor of Raby, he told him he would offer the ſtag as his anceſtors had done; ſaving that, whereas his father required, that the prior's ſervants ſhould be ſet aſide at that time, and his own ſerve in their ſtead; he would be content, that his ſhould attend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with thoſe of the prior: And whereas his father inſiſted, that his ſervants ſhould only be admitted at dinner; he ſtood upon it, that his ſhould be there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained the whole day, and likewiſe the morrow at breakfaſt.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto the prior made anſwer, that none of his anceſtors were ever ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and that he would rather quit the ſtag, than ſuffer any new cuſtom to the prejudice of the church. But to this Ralph replied, that he would perform the whole ſervice or none, and put the trial of his right upon the country. The prior, therefore, knowing him to be ſo powerful, and that the country durſt not diſpleaſe him, declined the offer. However, at length to gain his favour, (in regard he had no ſmall intereſt at court, and might do him a kindneſs or a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure)
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0782100202:97"/>
was content for that one time he ſhould perform it as he pleaſed, ſo that it might not be drawn into example afterwards; and for that purpoſe propoſed, that indentures ſhould be made between them.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon the Lord, Nevill brought but few with him, and thoſe more for the honour of the prior than a burthen, and ſo ſhortly after dinner took his leave, but left one of his ſervants to lodge there all night, and to take his breakfaſt there on the next day; proteſting, that being both a ſon and tenant to the church, he would not be burthenſome to it, in reſpect it would be no advantage to himſelf, but might much damnify it, if he ſhould bring with him as great a train as he would, ſaying, <hi>What doth a breakfaſt ſignify to me? Nothing.</hi> And likewiſe, that if the prior would ſhew, that he had no right to what he ſo claimed, he would free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recede therefrom; and if he had a right, he would accept of a compoſition for it, rather than be burthenſome to the convent; but if they ſhould put him to get his right by law, then he would not abate any thing thereof.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon enquiry being made amongſt the oldeſt monks of the houſe, they affirmed, that being of eight years ſtanding when his father was before repulſed, they had often ſeen the ſtag offered, and that he never ſtaid dinner but when the prior invited him; and ſome ancient men of the country teſtified as much; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that as ſoon as the ſtag was brought, they carried him to the kitchen, and thoſe who brought him were taken into the hall to breakfaſt, as they that brought their rents uſed to be.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, when it happened that any of the lords Nevill were deſired to ſtay dinner with the prior, his cook was admitted into the kitchen to prepare a diſh for him; ſo likewiſe another ſervant in the cellar to chuſe his drink, and in like manner ſome other at the gate, who knew his ſervants and followers, merely to let them in, and keep others out, who, under pretence of being his ſervants, might then intrude; but this was only done by the prior out of courteſy and reſpect, and not at all of right.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon Henry le Scrope, one of the juſtices, affirmed, that he had been of counſel with Ralph Nevill (father of this Ralph) when he brought his writ of <hi>Novell Diſſeiſin</hi> againſt the prior; and told him that he had no right at all: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Ralph let fall his ſuit.</p>
                  <p>Some ſaid, that making this claim out of his own ſee, he ought there, (viz. in the priory) to ſhew ſome ſpecial evidence to aſſert his claim. Others, that as the prior did challenge nothing of him, but what was reſerved by the grant; ſo could not he, unleſs he ſhewed a charter for it. And beſides, claiming to be entertained with as many as he ſhould bring, and not ſpecifying the number, there could be no lawful reaſon for it; becauſe the ſtag was always offered on Holy Rood day, whereupon grew an old ſong in rhyme, as a lamentation for Robert de Nevill, his great grandfather.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Wel I wa, ſal ys Hornes blaw</l>
                     <l>Holy Rode this Day;</l>

                     <l>Was wont to blaw tham ay.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0782100202:98"/>Moreover, it was further ſaid, that it never had been the cuſtom of the prior to make a feaſt on that day, when the ſervants of ſo great a perſon was to offer; and that the prior uſually on St Cuthbert's day had wont to dine with the biſhop at ſome of his own manor-houſes; therefore, who ſhould compel him to make a feaſt at home? Likewiſe, that thoſe lands were given to the anceſtors of this lord Nevill, when they were not ſuch great men as to have a marſhal, a butler, and other ſervants of ſtate; for in thoſe days, they had no more than Raby with its appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which was not then of ſo much worth as it is now; for Brancepeth and Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelfe came to them ſince by marriage; as alſo other lands in Yorkſhire and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondſhire: Therefore it could not be thought that the prior of Durham did give lands of ſuch value, and purchaſe the ſervice to be done for them at ſo high a rate, eſpecially conſidering, that in the prior's land book, not only all the ſervices are exactly regiſtered, but whatſoever others ought to receive of him. And laſtly, that there is not ſo much as mention made of this ſervice in any of their chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles."</p>
                  <p>During the vacancy of the priory, the biſhop ſeized the temporalties of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and by Stephen Mauley (de Malo-lacu) his vicar-general, diſplaced the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prior, the priors of the cells, and many who were adherents of the deceaſed prior, appointing others in their places: The prior of Coldingham alone was continued in his office. This Grayſtanes exclaims againſt as a flagrant breach of the privileges of the convent, though the biſhop alledged the members of the houſe were not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of holding offices, by reaſon of the ſentence of excommunication, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unpurged. In this period much perplexity aroſe touching preſentations to vacant churches, till it was determined they ſhould be made jointly, under the title of <hi>Anthony biſhop of Durham and the convent of Durham, the office of prior being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</hi> In the year 1308, on the morrow of the Purification, the biſhop viſited the chapter in the order preſcribed by pope Boniface, when, for no other irregularity or offence than their attachment to the prior in his ſtruggles againſt the prelate's oppreſſions, he ſuſpended the following members of the ſociety for ten years:— Richard de Aſlakby, who was ſub-prior in prior Hotoun's time; Galfridus de Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, prior of Finchale; and Nicholas de Rothbury, almoner of Durham. But archbiſhop Greenfield, in his viſitation during the vacancy of the See, after the prelate's death, annulled the ſentence<note n="*" place="bottom">Rob. de Grayſtanes.—Wharton's Angl.

                  <p>The king, jointly with the patriarch, applied to the pope in favour of</p>

                  <p>then prior of Wederhall, and he was accordingly appointed Hotoun's ſucceſſor on the 24th of February, 1308: In this act we have a flagrant inſtance of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy See; for the price of his collation was not leſs than 3000 marks to the pontiff, and 1000 to the cardinals. He was inſtalled on the feaſt of St Cuthbert in September following, many of the nobility with ſeveral prelates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent at the ceremony.</p>
                  <p>Under the oppreſſive ſpirit of the prelate, the priory ſuffered greatly; being not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0782100202:99"/>
only much impoveriſhed by the expences incurred, and heavy debt contracted on account of their litigations with him; but alſo greatly embarraſſed and diſtreſſed by the defection of the prior of Coldingham, who renounced his obedience and ſubjection to the monaſtery: The prior of Durham viſited that convent, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed the prior for his offence, appointing another in his room: After having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the homage and fealty of the terr-tenants of the ſhrine, he followed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed prior to Stamford, whither he haſtened to lay his complaint before the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, hoping the king and his miniſters would ſupport him againſt his ſuperior, as he was perſonally known to them, having carried the banner of St Cuthbert in the Scotch war; but in this was diſappointed, for the countenance of the court was denied to ſuch injurious proceedings.</p>
                  <p>The prior of Durham obtained permiſſion to viſit Rome, where he ſtaid till the prelate's death. On the acceſſion of biſhop Kellow, the convent experienced a happy change of circumſtances, and received repeated marks of that prelate's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and favour; he reverſed all the oppreſſive acts of his predeceſſor, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the ancient privileges of the monaſtery, eſpecially in the material point, that during the vacancy of the priory, none ſave the ſub-prior and chapter ſhould intermeddle with the ſpiritualties or temporalties of the convent; the biſhop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the See the right of having one clerk in the houſe as a nominal guardian thereof, with three horſes and three ſervants, without claiming to have any further concern with the goods of the houſe. By the gift of this prelate, the convent had Waſtrophead, with a fiſhery in the river Were.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1313 <note n="*" place="bottom">R. de Grayſtanes.—Wharton's Angl. Sac. p. 755, &amp;c.—Grey's MSS.</note>, the prior finding his health decline, and the attacks of old age haſten upon him, reſigned his office, and had allotted for maintenance the cell of Jarrow and the manor of Wardle <note n="†" place="bottom">It is difficult to aſcertain what place this was; it is wrote different from the <hi>Wardlau</hi> and <hi>Wardlawe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted: Probably it is <hi>Wardale</hi> near Jarrow, at this day part of the prebendal corps land of this church.</note>; he lived in retirement until the month of Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary, 1342, when he departed this life: He is deſcribed to us as a man of good ſtature, a graceful countenance, and pleaſing carriage; laviſh and diffuſive, he was remarked to be improvident of his reſources, delighting in a numerous retinue, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated and ſplendid feaſts.

in Copeland, in the county of Cumberland, was educated in St John's college, Cambridge, where he commenced doctor in divinity, and went out <hi>ad eundem</hi> 9th July 1567. It is ſaid he was nominated to the biſhopric of Durham in 1552, biſhop Tunſtall being then living, who declined accepting it, as the conditions were ſuch he could not approve: <note n="*" place="bottom">Grey's Notes.—Kennet's Hiſt. vol. ii. p. 323.—Burnet's Reſ. vol. ii. p. 64.—Strype's Ann. vol. ii. p. 656.</note> It is certain there was much diſagreement between him and that prelate. Soon after the acceſſion of queen Mary, Horn was ejected, and became a voluntary exile for the cauſe of faith, living abroad the whole of her reign. At the head of the epiſcopal party at Frankfort he greatly diſtinguiſhed himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choſen Hebrew-reader to the Engliſh ſociety there <note n="†" place="bottom">Fuller's Ch.

On the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Elizabeth, being reſtored to his deanry, he continued but a ſhort time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his appointment to the biſhopric of Wincheſter, which happened in the year 1560. At the conference at Weſtminſter, he was choſen one of the diſputants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſervices of the church <note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. lib. 9, p. 56.</note>. A ſuit was proſecuted againſt him by biſhop Bonner, touching the ſupremacy oath<note n="¶" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 79.—Collyer's Eccl. Hiſt. vol. ii. p. 493.</note>, which was ſuperſeded by the fortunate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of the ſtatute on conſecrations. He departed this life on the 1ſt day of June 1579. The place of his interment is variouſly ſpoken of; moſt probably it was in the church at Wincheſter, near the pulpit; but Willis and Stevens ſay in the Minories church, London.

with the whole choir in their proper habits, ſhall meet him in proceſſion at the north door, the bells ringing, the dean on his right-hand, the next in dignity on his left, conducting him to the high altar, where, kneeling, the prayers preſcribed ſhall be uſed. He is to be received in the ſame manner when he comes to viſit; but on other occaſions by the ringing of bells, and without proceſſion. When the biſhop preaches, or performs divine ſervice, the perſon whoſe turn it ſhould be, is excuſed. On his reading any of the offices on great feſtivals, the dean on his right-hand, and the perſon next in dignity on his left; or, in their abſence, the two next ſuperiors ſhall aſſiſt, and attend him from the veſtry to the altar or the throne; and on other occaſions the ſub-dean, or the perſon next in dignity, ſhall miniſter to him and ſupport his book. The dean and the whole choir, coming in or going out, ſhall bow to him, whether he is ſeated in his ſtall or throne. When the biſhop inſtitutes the dean or prebendaries, he is to ſend his letters to the dean and chapter, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and poſſeſſion.</p>

He ſhall hear all cauſes relative to the chapter, and, aſſiſted with their opinions, determine therein; correct exceſſes, and reprehend all obſtinate offenders. He ſhall inveſt the preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries in the preſence of their brethren, and in his and the chapter's name receive the oath preſcribed. Being ſuperior in authority, all ſhall ſtand when he enters or departs the choir or chapter-houſe. He is firſt in place and voice. The ringing of the bells muſt wait for him morning and evening on feſtivals, when he is to perform the offices; but not at other times, unleſs he officiates <note n="*" place="bottom">Niſi cum executor officii ſuerit.</note>. On the like days he is to chant the anthems, or ſuch of the canons as he ſhall appoint for that purpoſe. On reading the ſervice he is not to quit his ſeat. If the biſhop is not preſent, it is the dean's office, or, in his abſence, the next in dignity, to pronounce the confeſſion. All the miniſters of the church ſhall bow to him in his ſtall as they enter or depart the choir. In correcting exceſſes, ſuch is the prerogative of the dean and prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, on account of their prebends, that they ſhall not be convened out of chapter, becauſe ſuch cauſes as relate to the prebends ſhall be determined in chapter, by the judgment of the dean and chapter. Prebendaries' ſervants ought to be corrected by their proper maſters, unleſs their offences are heinous, and their maſters neglect that duty. Leave of abſence ſhall be given by the dean to the minor canons and other officers of the church for one day, or at moſt not exceeding eight days; and in his abſence, by the ſub-dean or ſenior reſident: Abſence for any greater time ſhall not be given without conſent of the chapter.</p>

are to be paid quarterly, at the four great quarter days, except the money which accumulates in each year, from forfeitures by abſentees, mulcts, and ſeal fees, which ſhall be collected in the following manner: The precentor is to mark the days of the dean's and each prebendary's abſence above the ſtatutable allowance; for each day the dean ſhall forfeit 12 s. 5d. and each prebendary 16¼ d. to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the treaſurer; which accumulation <hi>appellavimus communam dividendam.</hi> Further to enable them to keep hoſpitality, <hi>(rem Deo et hominibus longe gratiſſimam)</hi> particular lands, &amp;c. are aſſigned, as ſet forth in the next chapter, which they may occupy or let as they think expedient, ſo as they pay the reſerved rent at the uſual times, and keep the houſes in repair at their expence, except main-timber: The dean and chapter ſhall be judges of the repairs wanted, and on neglect cauſe them to be repaired at the parties expence.

                           <p>For the houſes of the petty canons we certified your lordſhip in your firſt viſitation, that they were all in theſe late bad times deſtroyed. That they were formerly but little houſes or chambers, made only for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married perſons, and who had their diet in common. That we had already made their places better than when they had their old houſes and ſtipends: to which notwithſtanding, we have of our own accord, and upon public coſt, added ſo much, that we hope in a little time, to ſee three good houſes built for them this year, and have ſound out a good way for ſupply of a fourth; and as ſoon as Mr Dury can be removed, of a fifth alſo, though with ſome charges to repair this. The petty canons'-hall and the gueſt-hall, ſince the method of hoſpitality and diet were changed, were of long time uſeleſs and ruined in theſe laſt deſtructive times: But yet our deſign is, by ſome reparation of walls, to render the place of the petty canons'-hall more ſeemly. We found no ſchool-houſe ſtanding, but have built a large one, with addition of divers rooms. In this article it appears, that the ſecond, ſixth, eighth, and ninth prebend houſes were a little before rebuilt in whole, or great part.</p>
                           <p>One of Biſhop Coſin's injunctions at the cloſe of his viſitation, 1668, was, that no one ſhould carry any thing through the church; but that victuals, or any thing of that ſort ſhould be ſeized, and carried to the gaol, to be diſtributed among the priſoners.</p>
                           <p>It appears both by the viſitation papers of Biſhop Coſin and Biſhop Crewe, that <hi>ſackbuts</hi> and <hi>cornets</hi> were then uſed in the church muſic.</p>

                        <hi>An Act of Chapter,</hi> 20 <hi>July,</hi> 1556.</head>
                     <p>Conſidering that this our church, during the late ſchiſm, has been ſpoiled of all its ornaments and much waſted; and moreover, that a very ſmall ſtipend is aſſigned by the ſtatutes to the miniſters of this church, to alleviate which, we the dean and chapter, by common and unanimous conſent, this 20th day of July, in the year of our Saviour 1556, in a general chapter held at Durham, have ordained and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that whoever after this day ſhall be admitted into the place of canon or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendary of this church, however becoming vacant before he be inſtalled, is to pay the precentor three ſhillings and four-pence; the regiſter ſix ſhillings and eight-pence; the two vergers four ſhillings; for bread and wine five ſhillings; to the bell-ringers one ſhilling; the chapter of the reſident prebendaries one pound; to the fabric and ornaments of the church one pound: And this we will to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as a local ſtatute of the church for ever.</p>
                     <p>The ſtipends are then ſtated, as before noted in the 33d chapter, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Analecta Capitularia Ex Archivis Dunelm.</hi> An account of the practices of the church, about the lands and tithes, commonly called <hi>corps</hi> and <hi>bycorps,</hi> lotteries, dividends, reſidences, &amp;c. ſince the erection of the deanry: Extracted out of the regiſter-books and rentals, &amp;c. ſuppoſed to be collected by Dr Baſire. The original ſigned P. Smith, regiſter.</p>
                     <p>It has been the cuſtom ſince the erection, to call the lands aſſigned to the dean and prebendaries for augmentation of reſidence and hoſpitality their corps; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in our local ſtatutes the yearly ſtipend of the dean is ſaid to be given him <hi>pro corpore decanatus ſui,</hi> and of the prebendaries <hi>pro corpore prebendae ſuae;</hi> the word <hi>corps</hi> being uſed herein not otherwiſe, nor <hi>bycorps</hi> at all.</p>
                     <p>Our ſtatutes were made by Queen Mary, in the firſt year of her reign, ſhe being enabled thereto by an act of parliament. The former ſtatutes by King Henry VIII. being defective, as in other things, ſo in point of law, as appears by the preamble of that act. We have, I ſuppoſe, no copy of the old ſtatutes, but by ſome paſſages in our books, we may think they did not differ much from the new, in the matter of corps, and ſome other particulars: Biſhop Tunſtall having, as it is probable, a great hand in both; and there is a traditional commendation of him for the good ſervice he did the church concerning the ſtatutes.</p>
                     <p>But ſearching into the practice, we find theſe corps not ſo diſpoſed of for a good while as they are now. At the erection of the deanry, although their corps with other lands, were ſettled upon the dean and prebendaries, they came not all of them into their hands at the ſame time, the prior and convent had leaſed out ſome, as Houghhall and Witton-Gilbert, for forty years, and South Pittington for thirty-five years, ſome two years before the diſſolution; for if it had been but one year before, the leaſes had been void by an act of parliament. And King Henry VIII. in the interval between the diſſolution and erection, had made a grant of more of them to ſeveral perſons for twenty-one years, &amp;c.</p>

W.) of which the 119th was one; together with the ten commandments, and a prayer, now placed at the end of the verſion. Soon after his return to England, he was employed to accompany Francis, earl of Bedford, on his embaſſy of condolence for the death of the French king, in 1560: And he attended Ambroſe, earl of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, to Newhaven, to be preacher there, whilſt the earl defended it againſt the French; on which occaſion he ſhewed a reproachable diſpoſition, in ſpiriting the people againſt uniformity: The earl, either to be rid of him, or through an eſteem, which even his improprieties could not wean, obtained this deanry of the queen, on Skynner's death, although the ſame had been promiſed by her majeſty to Dr Wilſon, then one of her ſecretaries of ſtate.

Oxon. v. i. p. 154.</note>, of thoſe acts of violence and irreligion, is ſhortly ſtated to the reader; but antecedent thereto, we beg leave to obſerve, that in all ages, and with all people, where civilization and the true ſpirit of religion prevailed, things applied to pious offices and religious ceremonies were held in ſuch veneration, that defiling and employing them in mean and contemptuous uſes, was forbidden and puniſhed. The example of Balthazar, in holy writ, is tremendous; though the ſuperſtitious rites of the Jewiſh temple might render the veſſels he abuſed, as odious to thoſe who ſtripped them from the ſacred places, as ever dean Whittingham held the veſſels of the church at Durham. Diſturbing the aſhes of the dead, is an offence to human nature, ſuch as the moſt ignorant of ſavages refrain from; poliſhed nations of antiquity held ſuch remains in the higheſt veneration, and did not conceive the moſt depraved mind capable of their profanation: The Egyptian who left his father's corps unredeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was denied the privileges of ſociety. In profane hiſtory, the ſtory of Cambyſes affords us reflections of the like nature. The learned Dr Prideaux is a ſufficient authority to quote this inſtance<note n="‡" place="bottom">Prideaux's Connection, &amp;c. v. i. p. 244.</note>; and his words are, <q>As he mounted his horſe for the march, his ſword falling out of the ſcabbard, gave him a wound on the thigh, of which he died a few days after. The Egyptians remarking, that it was in the ſame part of the body, where he had afore wounded the Apis, reckoned it as an eſpecial judgment from Heaven upon him, for that fact, <hi>and perchance they were not much out of it: For it ſeldom happening, in an affront given to any particular mode of worſhip, how erroneous ſoever it may be, but that religion is in general wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby; there are many inſtances in hiſtory, wherein God hath very ſignally puniſhed the profanations of religion in the worſt of times, and under the worſt mode of heathen idolatry.</hi>" Wood proceeds thus, "The works of impiety that Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham performed, while he ſat dean of Durham, were very many, among
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0782100202:158"/>
which I ſhall tell you of theſe. Moſt of the priors of Durham having been buried in coffins of ſtone, and ſome in marble, and each coffin covered with a plank of marble, or free ſtone, which lay level with the paving of the church, (for ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of note that were laid in ſuch coffins, were buried no deeper in the ground than the breadth of a plank to be laid over them, even with the ſurface of the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) he cauſed ſome of them to be plucked up, and appointed them to be uſed as troughs, for horſes to drink in, or hogs to feed in. All the marble and free ſtones alſo that covered them, and other graves, he cauſed to be taken away and broken, ſome of which ſerved to make pavement in his houſe. He alſo defaced all ſuch ſtones as had any pictures of braſs, or other imagery work, or chalice wrought, engraven upon them; and the reſidue he took away and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed them to his own uſe, and did make a waſhing houſe of them, at the end of the centery garth; ſo that it could not be diſcerned afterwards that ever any were buried in the ſaid centery garth, it was ſo plain and ſtraight. The truth is, <hi>he could not abide any thing that appertained to a goodly religiouſneſs, or monaſtical life</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Davies' Rites and Monuments.—This book was written by Anon. (one that had belonged to the choir of Durham), and publiſhed by John Davies of Kidwelly, in 1672.</note>. Within the ſaid abbey church of Durham, were two holy-water ſtones, of fine marble, very artificially made and engraven, and boſſed with hollow boſſes, upon the outerſides of the ſtones, very curiouſly wrought. They were both of the ſame work, but one much greater than the other. Both theſe were taken away by this <hi>unworthy dean,</hi> and carried into his kitchen, and employed to profane uſes by his ſervants, ſteeping their beef and ſalt fiſh in them, having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance in the bottoms of them, to let forth the water, as they had when they were in the church, to let out holy-water, &amp;c. He alſo cauſed the image of St Cuthbert, (which before had been removed from its proper place by dean Robert Horn, who alſo had a hand in ſuch impieties) and alſo other ancient monuments to be defaced and broken all to pieces, to the intent that there ſhould be no memory of that holy man, or of any other who had been famous in the church, and great benefactors thereto, (as the priors his predeceſſors were) left whole and undefaced. I ſay it again, that he did this to the end, that no memory or token of that holy man, St Cuthbert, ſhould be left, who was ſent and brought thither by the power and will of Almighty God, and was thereupon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the erection of the monaſtical church of Durham, where the clergy and ſervants have all their livings and commodities from that time to this day. At length, after his many rambles in this world, both beyond and within the ſeas, and his too forward zeal for promoting his Calviniſtical (if not worſe) opinions, whereby much miſchief happened to the church of England, he did unwillingly (being then full of worldly troubles) ſubmit himſelf to the ſtroke of death, on the 10th day of June, 1579, and was buried in the cathedral church of Durham; ſoon after was a tomb-ſtone laid over his grave, with an epitaph of twelve long and ſhort verſes, engraven on a braſs plate, faſtened thereto; which, with moſt, if not all of the monuments, which were ſet up after his time, were miſerably defaced by the Scots, when they invaded England, in 1640. So that as he had
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0782100202:159"/>
before in a woeful manner, violated the monuments of his predeceſſors and others, ſo was his, by invaders; and nothing now left to preſerve his memory, or perſon to ſhew the place where his carcaſe was lodged.</q> After what Wood has ſaid of our dean, it is juſtice to his character to gather up the ſentiments of other authors<note n="*" place="bottom">

Wood, was likely to be given to dean Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham, ſo noted a Puritan, that he has many an ill word from that Oxonian, who however ſays of him, had he ſtirred in it, and made intereſt with his friend Robert, earl of Leiceſter, he might have obtained it.</q> Bancroft, another ſuch rigid doctor as Whitgift, in a treatiſe of his, ſtiles Whittingham <q>
                        <hi>the falſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy dean of Durham,</hi> for taking upon him that deanry, when he was only maſter of arts, and, by the ſtatutes of the church at Durham, he ſhould have been a doctor or bachelor of divinity: With ſuch ſtraws are theſe men's heads ſtuffed. It gave alſo great offence, that he ſhould content himſelf with a Geneva ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and for this they did not forbear injuring him, in ſaying he encouraged Knox and Goodman, in ſetting up ſedition in Scotland; for the ſettlement made by Knox in Scotland, was the reformed religion, and not ſedition. Dr Sandys, now archbiſhop of York, ſuſpecting that the gentle hand of Dr Pilkington, late biſhop of Durham, had given the Puritans too much encouragement in that dioceſe, reſolved to viſit it himſelf, Dr Barnes, the new biſhop, having complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, of the number of non-conformiſts, whom he could not reduce to the orders of the church. But whatever his pretence was for this grand viſitation, the real deſign was ſuppoſed to be againſt Whittingham, whom Sandys valued not the more for having been a fellow exile with him in Germany, in the bloody reign of queen Mary. He was a divine of great learning, an admirer of Calvin and the church of Geneva, which the late honourable and reverend Dr Compton, biſhop of London, ſtiled his brethren, in a letter he wrote to them, and which the Laudeans treat with contempt or indignation, as ſchiſmatics. It ſeems dean Whittingham had only had Geneva ordination, which I believe as much, as that the ſun is now ſhining in a very fine day, is by the bulk of the inferior clergy, and younger academics, at this time looked upon to be no more an ordination than that of a veſtry would be. There were thirty-four other articles againſt him; but that was like an ignorant ruſtic's inſiſting to have a fellow hanged for ſtealing his gooſe, when he had juſt been convicted of burglary: The latter was ſufficient to hang him, and the gooſe afterwards not worth mentioning. If he was no prieſt, as archbiſhop Sandys urged, on account of his foreign ordination, that would have outed him of courſe, and then what ſignified the other roll of articles: But the dean, inſtead of anſwering the charge, ſtood by the rights of the church of Durham, and denied the archbiſhop's power of viſitation; upon which
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0782100202:160"/>
the archbiſhop excommunicated him, that is, denied him the privilege and benefit of receiving the Lord's ſupper. The dean appealed to the queen, who directed a commiſſion to the archbiſhop, to the lord preſident of the North, and to the dean of York, to hear and determine the validity of his orders, and to enquire into the other miſdemeanors contained in the articles: The lord preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was a favourer of the Puritans, and Dr Hutton, dean of York, of Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham's principles, and boldly averred, that the dean was ordained in a better ſort than even the archbiſhop himſelf; ſo that the commiſſion came to nothing. Sandys, vexed at the diſappointment, and at calling in queſtion his right of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the reader ſees how it goes, the power, the denomination, the ſelf ever uppermoſt, obtained another commiſſion, directed to himſelf, to the biſhop of Durham, the lord preſident, (he muſt come after notwithſtanding his precedency) the chancellor of the dioceſe, and ſome others, whom he could depend upon, to viſit the church of Durham: The aim of Sandys and Barnes was to deprive Whittingham of his deanry, as a layman. When the dean appeared before the commiſſioners, he produced a certificate under the hands of eight perſons, for the manner of his ordination; upon which the lord preſident roſe up, and ſaid, I cannot in conſcience agree to deprive him for that cauſe only, for it will be ill taken by all the godly and learned, both at home and abroad, that we ſhould allow of the popiſh maſſing prieſts in our miniſtry, and diſallow of miniſters made in a reformed church; upon which the commiſſion was adjourned <hi>ſine die.</hi>— One cannot help obſerving here, how the noble and the wiſe abhorred perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and how enlarged their minds were in compariſon with the lordly eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics. Theſe proceedings of the archbiſhop againſt the dean were invidious, and loſt him his eſteem, both in city and county. Beſides the calling the dean's ordination in queſtion, was contrary to the ſtatute 13th Elizabeth, by which the ordinations of foreign reformed churches were declared valid; and thoſe that had no other orders, were made of like capacities with others, to enjoy any place of miniſtry within England. It is ſtrange the archbiſhop of York, and the biſhop of Durham, among other articles againſt the dean, did not think of that mentioned by Wood, the Oxonian, who doubtleſs thought it of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, which was, that he was only graduated maſter of arts, whereas the ſtatutes of the church of Durham required, that the dean ſhould be a bachelor of divinity<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. v. p. 120.</note>.

                                    <p>Walter Belcanqual, dean of Durham, complained of George Grey and Anthony Smith, two of the tenants of the Dean and Chapter of Durham, for miſdemeanors committed by them, in getting diverſe of the tenants of the ſaid Dean and Chapter to ſet their hands and ſeals to diverſe papers and petitions of complaint, againſt the ſaid Dean and Chapter their landlord, and to contribute money for proſecution of their complaints; and as the ſaid Dean did alleage, they did not make known to the Dean and Chapter their grievances, before they came up to complain.</p>
                                    <p>The ſaid Grey and Smith appearing before the lords of the council, did acknowledge, that what was alleaged againſt them was true as to the ſubſcribing the petition; but declared they had cauſe to complain againſt the Dean and Chapter, for that contrary to a decree entred in the court of York and elſewhere, in the time of queen Elizabeth, which did aſcertain their right in the renewing their leaſes, with ſavyor to them in reſpect of their tenant right; and that a ſmall fine (in compariſon of what the Dean and Chapter now required of them) had wont to be paid, of which, they ſaid, they often complained as a grievance, but never obtained hopes of relief from them.</p>
                                    <p>The council-board, after hearing the buſineſs, declared themſelves diſſatisfied with the tenants' proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the archbiſhop of Canterbury moved, that the Dean and Chapter might do well to proceed againſt them in the Star Chamber, and never to renew their leaſes to the tenants, or the children of them who did complain; and that it were fit they ſhould be committed to priſon till they did produce the ſchedule of grievances ſubſcribed by the tenants, to diſcover their names; and that they ſhould pay ſo much money as they received from thoſe tenants (who impowered them to proſecute this their complaint) to one of the clerks of the council, and that nothing ſhould be deducted out of the ſame, to allow the ſaid Grey and Smith any thing towards the defraying of their charges or monies laid out about the proſecution of this buſineſs; for, ſaid the archbiſhop, he was confident it was a practice againſt the church, and did believe there was ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſign in the buſineſs.</p>
                                    <p>Hereupon the council-board ordered, that Grey and Smith be committed to the gatehouſe, and there to lie in priſon, until they produce a ſchedule of the names of the ſubſcribers, and that they did pay the money they had confeſſed to have received, (which was about the ſum of eighty pounds) unto the hands of Sir William Beecher, one of the clerks of the council; which they paid accordingly, but continued in priſon many weeks, becauſe they would not deliver up the liſt of the tenants names that ſubſcribed the petition; but a parliament meeting April 13 next following, they were ſet at liberty by the council-board, without delivering up the liſt of the tenants' names, and the paper of ſubſcription containing their grievances.</p>

                  <p>This period of time muſt not be paſſed over without obſerving, that archbiſhop Laud was very urgent for the eſtabliſhment of decent regulations in the church ſervice, and particularly for placing the communion table at the eaſt end of the church, and encloſing it with a rail, to ſecure it from profanation and common buſineſs: But in 1641, the commons interpoſing their authority in thoſe matters, the table was ordered to be removed, the rails taken away, the chancel levelled, ornaments to be diſuſed, as baſons, tapers, candleſticks, &amp;c. and that bowing at the hallowed name, towards the eaſt, ſhould be forborn. In ſhort, the hour was come, when religious veneration was extinguiſhed, and ſlovenlineſs, diſorder, and irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſimilar to the rudeneſs of a Jewiſh ſynagogue, were tolerated in the churches<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <p>The charges brought againſt Cofins (which in the annals of that biſhop, p. 1178, were referred to this period of the work) were, <q>That he ſet up a marble altar with cherubims, in the cathedral of Durham; that this with the appurtenances, coſt two thouſand pounds; that this ornamental furniture, which he calls appurtenances, was a cope, the repreſentation of the Trinity, and God the Father in the figure of an old man. There was likewiſe ſaid to be a crucifix, with a red beard and blue cap. The dean was likewiſe accuſed for lighting two hundred wax candles about the altar on Candlemas-day: For forbidding the ſinging any pſalms before or after ſermons: For making an anthem to be ſung of the three kings of Cologn, Gaſpar, Balthazar, and Melchior; and for procuring a conſecrated knife, only to cut the bread at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion."—The anſwer Cofins gave in upon both, was to this effect, "That the communion table in the church of Durham, was not ſet up by Cofins, but by the Dean and Chapter, many years before he was prebendary of that church; and that Smart, the accuſer, was one of that chapter; that by the public accounts ſtanding upon the regiſter, the charge did not amount to above a tenth part of what was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. That the copes uſed in that church, were furniſhed long before Cofins' time; and that Smart was prebendary when they were bought, and allowed his ſhare of the charge. That Cofins never approved the picture of the Trinity, or the image of God the Father in any figure; and that to his knowledge, there was no ſuch repreſentation in the church of Durham. That the crucifix, with a blue cap and a golden beard, was nothing but the top of biſhop Hatfield's tomb, which had ſtood in the church above two hundred and fifty years; and that there was no ſuch figure upon any of the copes, as is reported in Fuller's Hiſtory. That by the ſtatutes of the church, to which Smart was ſworn no leſs than Cofins, the treaſurer was to provide a ſufficient number of wax lights for the ſervice of the quire during the winter ſeaſon; that there was never above two fair candles ſet upon the communion table; that there was no more candles uſed upon Candlemas-night than in the Chriſtmas holidays; and that the number of them was leſſened or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in proportion to the congregation. That he never forbad ſinging the metre pſalms in the church, but uſed to ſing them himſelf, with the people at morning prayer. That he was ſo far from directing the ſinging an anthem to the three kings of Cologn, that at his firſt coming to Durham cathedral, he ordered this ſuperſtitious hymn to be cut out of the old ſong books belonging to the choriſters' ſchool: That no ſuch anthem had been ſung in the choir during his being there, nor, as far as his enquiry could reach, for threeſcore years before and upwards.

                                    <p>That afterwards, after the ſaid prior and convent was ſo diſſolved, and their poſſeſſions, reverſions, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and inheritances, veſted and ſettled by act of parliament, in the ſaid king Henry the 8th and his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and conferred over amongſt other lands and poſſeſſions, to a Dean and Chapter by him newly erected, and their ſucceſſors, by his letters patents, bearing date the 16th day of May, in the 33d year of the reign of king Henry the 8th.</p>
                                    <p>That after that, all the tenants of the ſaid prior and convent, with all the ſaid manors, villages, and town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, becoming tenants of the ſaid new erected Dean and Chapter, did continue their holds and poſſeſſions in their ſaid farmholds and land, and could not be prevailed withall by the ſaid Dean and Chapter, to take leaſes for twenty-one years in writing, though but at the old rents, howbeit much laboured and endeavoured by them, as appeared by ſome few inconſiderable leaſes, made by them to ſtrangers of their lands, in the nature of concurrent leaſes, and of the reverſions thereof, which yet were conſtantly, and are to this day enjoyed by the then preſent tenants, or their aſſigns, or ſuch as do derive their intereſt, or have deſcended from them; the ſaid leſſees being employed, as it ſeems, to terrify the ſaid tenants from their old way of holding into new leaſes, who yet continued in that manner, paying and performing the antient yearly rents and ſervices accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed, and very few leaſes were taken, till the 15th or 16th year of the late queen Elizabeth's reign, as by the receipt books and rentals plainly appears.</p>
                                    <p>That then many and great differences enſuing betwixt the ſaid Dean and Chapter and their tenants, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their eſtates, cuſtoms, and ſervices, and the manner of the holds, which the ſaid Dean and Chapter endeavoured to have altered, the then honourable lords of her majeſty's privy council, and the lords preſident and council of the north, who from her majeſty was authoriſed to hear and determine all differences of that nature in the northern counties, called before them the ſaid parties concerned; and upon full and deliberate hearing and conſideration had of the ſeveral demands, objections, and anſwers, of all the ſaid parties, and by and with the conſent of the ſaid Dean and Chapter; did for the further and quiet ſettlement of the ſaid eſtates, cuſtoms, holds, and ſervices, make, decree, declare, and ſett down their order, which was entered, as well in the books of orders and decrees of the ſaid preſident and council, and of the privy council, as in the court of chancery at Durham, bearing date the 17th of Auguſt, in the 19th year of the reign of the ſaid late queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth; thereby ordering amongſt other things, <hi>that the ſaid tenants ſhould hold their lands and tenements from the ſaid Dean and Chapter by leaſe for twenty-one years, and ſo from twenty-one years to twenty-one years for ever, paying only three years fine at the moſt for renewing a leaſe for twenty-one years as aforeſaid;</hi> and in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, the ſaid tenants to continue the performance of their ancient and accuſtomed ſervice in the wars, with horſe, man, and furniture, upon the borders and marches of England towards Scotland, for the ſpace of fifteen days without wages, when the ſaid Dean and Chapter or their ſucceſſors ſhould require.</p>
                                    <p>That the then Dean and Chapter in approbation thereof, and conſenting thereto, did confirm the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Chapter ſeal, bearing date the 27th day of February, in the 20th year of the reign of the late queen, and in obſervation, and purſuance of the ſaid order, in relation to the three years fine therein ſpecified; the ſaid Dean and Chapter did, by their chapter act or grant, bearing date the 12th day of April, Anno Domini, 1626, order and appoint, <hi>that the ſaid tenants ſhould have their leaſes renewed from time to time without difficulty or delay, paying a year's fine every 7th year, without any other exaction or demand, which by true account, is three years fine for a leaſe for twenty-one years,</hi> as by the aforeſaid order is limited and appointed.</p>
                                    <p>And it doth alſo appear unto us, by the oaths of ſeveral perſons produced and ſworn thereby, and by all other lawful means, to inform ourſelves of the truth of the claim made by the ſaid tenants of a cuſtomary eſtate in reverſion, in their tenements and farmholds after the expiration of their preſent leaſes: That the ſaid tenants have accordingly had their leaſes renewed from twenty-one years to twenty-one years, and their fines never exceeded above three years rent at improvement, from time to time for twenty-one years, paying three years rent at the improved value, clear profit, ultra old rent and ſervice, as a fine for a leaſe for 21 years, and to pay and perform their ancient yearly rents and ſervices accuſtomed: And the ſaid tenants have always had their leaſes renewed from twenty-one years to twenty-one years, and their fines never exceeded above three years rent at the improvement as aforeſaid.</p>
                                    <p>And it alſo appeared by the evidence, upon oath of diverſe witneſſes ſworn and examined, that the ſaid tenants right or truſt in any eſtate in reverſion ſo claimed as aforeſaid, of and in the premiſſes, was ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in the general repute of the inhabitants of that county and the parts adjacent, as that the ſaid lands and tenements was uſualy alienated and ſold within three years value at the moſt, of freehold and fee ſimple lands; and that the ſaid tenants did uſualy alienate and ſell their ſaid tenant right or cuſtomary eſtates for five years purchaſe at the leaſt; and that the ſaid Dean and Chapter themſelves, even when all the term of years in ſeveral leaſes of the ſaid tenants were expired, did offer five years purchaſe, and ſometimes more, to ſuch tenants for their tenant right, or cuſtomary eſtate ſo claimed as aforeſaid, in caſe ſuch tenants were not willing or able to pay the uſual fine for renewing their ſaid leaſes.</p>
                                    <p>And it doth further manifeſtly appear unto us, that the livelyhood and ſubſiſtance of many hundred fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in the ſaid county, do ſolely depend upon the ſaid tenements and farmholds, and the benefit they expect by their ſaid claim of a cuſtomary eſtate and tenant right as aforeſaid; and that diverſe of the ſaid tenants and their anceſtors have continued ſome hundreds of years in the poſſeſſion of their tenements, as it appears by the court rolls of the ſaid late Dean and Chapter aforeſaid.</p>

                  <p>was appointed to this deanry: He was born at Weatherſlake, in Weſtmorland, in the year 1612, was educated at Sedbergh ſchool, in Yorkſhire, and admitted of St John's College, Cambridge, in 1631, of which he became a fellow: Was incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated bachelor of divinity at Oxford, in February, 1661; and was chaplain to biſhop Morton, who, in 1645, collated him to a prebend in this church, and when that prelate fell in the political confuſion of the times, Dr Barwick was turned out of his fellowſhip and prebend: It is ſaid he aſſiſted Dr Hewitt in the melancholy duties of the ſcaffold; and was highly inſtrumental in king Charles II.'s reſtoration <note n="*" place="bottom">Each.

Whilſt he held the deanry, he cauſed the cathedral and all the prebendal houſes to be repaired; erected the grammar-ſchool from the ground, and made it a nurſery of good literature. He brought water into the college, to ſupply the occaſions of all the prebendaries' houſes; reformed the manners of his clergy, and augmented the ſalaries of the poorer ſort; and did many other public acts for the benefit of his church<note n="†" place="bottom">

The chapter not only gave their conſent to all theſe matters, but did all in their power to promote them; yet they were ſo far from exacting in the fines on their leaſes, and were ſo beneficial to all the poor, that, in an age very little favourable to the clergy, they are mentioned with honour for their humanity, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and piety. Nay, in many caſes, they were ſo bountiful as to recede from their own right, in favour of their ſucceſſors, that the revenues of the church might deſcend to them with ſome augmentation.—<hi>Tempora mutantur!</hi>

                                       <p>That for divers hundreds of yeares before the diſſolution of the pryor and covent of Durham, your peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners aunceſtors, and thoſe under whome they clayme, held their lands to them and their heirs, under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rents, ſervices, and cuſtomes, by coppy of court roll, as by the entries thereof in the court rolls of the ſaid pryor and covent may appeare.</p>
                                       <p>That the Deane and Chapter imediately after the diſſolution, endeavouring generally to breake the ſaid cuſtomes, prevayled with ſome, and conſtrayned others to take leaſes, whereupon in the tyme of queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, upon complainte made to her majeſtie and privy councell, and upon reference to, and heareing of the ſaid cauſe before the lord preſident and councell in the north, and upon heareing both partyes in the 19th yeare of her raigne: It was decreed <note n="§" place="bottom">See this in page 149.</note>, that the tenants and their heires forgoeing their cuſtomary eſtates. ſhould have their leaſes renewed from twenty-one yeares to twenty-one yeares for ever, according to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent thereunto annexed, with certaine proviſoes of widdowes eſtates, and other agreements in the ſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, confirmed by the Deane and Chapter of Durham the 20th of Elizabeth, and entred in their regiſter, and inrolled in the chauncery of Durham, as by an exemplification thereof, under the countye palatyne ſeale may appeare.</p>
                                       <p>That the ſaid Chapter, conſiſteing of a deane and twelve prebends, deſigneing to breake this way of holding alſoe, devyded the whole deanery amongſt them by lottery, and for raiſeing fines, ſome prebends lett leaſes to kinsfolks and ſervants, over the tenants heads, menaced others, and by ſuch like artifice, gott ſome to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt to leaſes according to the lords' order, and others to accept of leaſes for twenty-one years, (ſimply as
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0782100202:176"/>they termed it) and ſoe to deſtroy the lords order; but for the moſt parte at three yeares old rent for a fine or little more; and afterwards, the ſaid Chapter inſiſted upon three yeares racke-rent for a fine of twenty-one yeares, and afterwards demanded a ſeaven penny, (that is) a full years value every ſeaven years, and halfe a years value for a renewall every three years and a halfe; thus by their power and greatnes overſwaying the tenants into what termes they pleaſed, contrary to the true intent, meaneing, and judgment of the ſaid decree.</p>
                                       <p>That wearied and impoveriſhed in their livelyhoods and eſtates by theſe doeings; the late powers expoſing theſe landes to faile, your petitioners, as well throwgh neceſſity to ſecure them, being all in leaſe for years then generally expireing, as alſoe to reduce their poore perplexed ſelves and eſtates to ſome kind of certainty, did purchaſe the ſame.</p>
                                       <p>That notwithſtonding their auncient holdings as aforeſaide, your majeſties declaration from Breda, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the archbiſhops in behalfe of old tenants and purchaſers, whereby your petitioners were incouraged and hoped to renew leaſes without fine, being in a better and different condition (the cuſtoms of their holde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings conſidered) from moſt of the tenants in England, but on the contrary, the Deane and Chapter demand greater fines of your petitioners than ever were paid in the worſt of tymes, and before they were purchaſers.</p>
                                       <p>But findeinge that the ſaide Deane and Chapter have as little conſideration of your majeſties ſaid declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and letters, as of the juſt deſyres of your petitioners;</p>
                                       <p>Your petitioners are bound in all humility to have recourſe to your majeſties grace and favoure as their laſt refuge, and humbly to beſeeche your majeſtie, either by recommending your petitioners condition to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the two houſes of parliament, or otherwiſe, as to your majeſties princely wiſedome ſhall ſeeme meet, to render your moſt gracious intentions manifeſted in your majeſties ſaid declaration and letters, effectual for the reliefe of your petitioners.</p>

                                       <head>The ANSWER of the Deane and Chapter of Durham, to a petition exhibited againſt them to his majeſtie, by ſome of their tenants, and by his majeſtie referred to the lords and other commiſſioners authorized for examination of the late pretended ſailes of crowne and church lands. IN obedience to your lordſhip's order of the
<date>4th of Aprill, 1662,</date> theſe reſpondents ſay;</head>
                                       <p>That the petition which is not onely againſt the preſent Deane and Chapter, but againſt all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors from the firſt foundation, hath not any thing in it, which is not either impertinent or falſe, as wee are ready to prove in every particular.</p>
                                       <p n="1">I. Whereas they call themſelves the auncient tenants of the Deane and Chapter of Durham, the firſt of them is not ſoe much as a tenant, but onely a purchaſer of a farme belonging to the ſaid Deane and Chapter, which he purchaſed of one that had formerly purchaſed the ſayd farme from the truſtees of the laite uſurpers, but was never the tenant of that farme to the Deane and Chapter: And as for all the reſt of the petitioners, who were formerly tenants to the Deane and Chapter, and do ſtill poſſeſſe their lands, there is not one of them that wee knowe that hath any leaſe in being, or hath made any application to the reſpondents for the renewing of his leaſe, neither hath any one of them pay'd any rent to the church ſince the late pretended diſſolution of deanes and chapters, and ſome of them being required to pay their rents, anſwere, that they have purchaſed their rents.</p>
                                       <p n="2">II. Whereas they alledge, that their anceſtors, and they under whom they hold, held their lands to them and their heires under certaine rents ſervyces, and cuſtomes by copy of court roll, alledgeing for proofe thereof our booke of entries; theſe reſpondents ſay, that they have ſearched their booke of entries, and have not found any one tenant that ever held any of their lands to him and his heires, but onely for a terme of yeares, ſometymes ſix ſometymes nine, but for the moſt parte but three, with condition to be obedient to the pryor and covent, and proviſoe (that if they dyed before that terme were expired) the grant to be voyd.</p>
                                       <p n="3">III. Whereas they alledge, that ymediately after the diſſolution of the priory and covent, the Deane and Chapter endeavoureing generally to breake the ſaid cuſtomes, prevayled with ſome, and conſtrayned others to take leaſes; wee anſwere that it is true, that ymediately after the diſſolution of the priory and covent, the Deane and Chapter did lett almoſt all their lands by leaſes, ſome for ſixty years, ſome for eighty and ſome for more, but generally for but one and twenty years, which way of holding, being much better for the tenants, then that which they had before, wee cannot underſtand, what need there was of any artifices or conſtrainte to bring the tenants to that way of holding their lands.</p>
                                       <p n="4">IV. Whereas they alledge an order of the lord preſident and councell of the north in the tyme of queene Elizabeth, wee anſwere, firſt, that there is a proviſoe in that order that nothing therein conteyned, ſhould extend to ſuch tenants as formerly held their lands by leaſe, but only to ſuch as called themſelves tenants by cuſtomes, and were reputed by the Deane and Chapter to be onely tenants by curtiſy: Secondly the order of the lords concerning thoſe tenants, was made in conſideration of border ſervice, which is long ſince ceaſed: Thirdly, that the order of the lords was ſo little in favoure of the tenants, that ſome of them refuſed to take leaſes, according to that order, and others chuſe rather to take leaſes ſimply: Fourthly, that all the leaſes for diverſe years ſince, are without any referrence to ſuch order, and as if there never had beene any ſuch order.</p>
                                       <p n="5">V. Whereas it is alledged that the Deane and Chapter deſigneing to brake this way of holding, alſo devyded the whole deanery among them by lottery; we anſwere, Firſt, that the Deane and Chapter for diverſe years before the order of the lords, did divyde many leaſes among themſelves by lottery, but never ſince that order, and therefore it could not be with deſigne to breake that order: Secondly, that if the Deane and Chapter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyded the whole deanry by lottery, the petitioners cannot derive their ſucceſſion beyond thoſe lotteryes, and therefore have not reaſon to complaine of them, nor pretence for holding from their aunceſtors before there was any Deane and Chapter as they alledge in the begining of their petition.</p>
                                       <p n="6">VI. Whereas they alledge that ſuch tenants as were brought to accept of leaſes from ſuch prebendaries as they ſell unto by lott, paid but three yeares old rent for five or little more; it is falſe that they paid but three years rent or little more, for compareing the fines with the old rents, wee finde the fines oftentimes above tenn times ſoe much as the old rent, and ſometymes above twelve time ſoe much, as for 2l 6s. 8d. rent, 30l. fine for a farme in Ayckliffe, in the name of Edward Thompſon; and for 33s. 4d. rent, 20l. fine to Richard Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinſon for a farme in Burdon; and for a tenement in Weſtow, 2l. 15s. 4d. rent, 38l. fine, which is neare four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene tymes the old rent, which conſidering the proportion that was then betweene the rent and the true value of the lands, and the great diſproportion, which is now by reaſon of the great increaſe of money, may be thought as great fines, as thoſe which have been demanded ſince.</p>
                                       <p n="7">VII. Whereas they accuſe theſe reſpondents of not regarding his majeſties late gracious declaration and letters, and the juſt deſyres of the petitioners, which are to renew their leaſes without fine: Wee anſwere, that wee conceive they have made this accuſation generall, becauſe they are not able to inſtance any one particular; and we deſyre them to name any one tenant that hath made application to be, who hath not beene offered
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0782100202:178"/>more in conſideration of his purchaſe, and demanded leſſe for fine, then is uſualy offered and demanded by any church in England in treateing with their tenants.</p>
                                       <p>Wee therefore humbly deſire your lordſhips, that the petitioners may be required to make proofe of their allegations, which wee know they cannot; and although wee conceive wee are not bound to diſprove them, wee are ready to ſhew the falſehoode of them, and the truth of every thing wee have affirmed, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to your lordſhips, how impudently they have abuſed his majeſtie, with a complicacion of many falſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legacions, troubled your lordſhipps, and ſlandered theire landlords, by whoſe favours they have enjoyed theire livelyhoods at ſoe eaſye a rate, as ought to have beene acknowledged by them with much thankfulnes.</p>

                  <p>a younger ſon of the loyal and valiant Sir Bevil Granville, and brother to John, the firſt earl of Bath of that family. After a ſuitable education, in September, 1657, he was admitted a fellow commoner of Exeter College, in Oxford. On the 28th of September, 1660, was created maſter of arts; and ſoon after, marrying Anne, youngeſt daughter of biſhop Coſins, was collated by his lordſhip on the 16th of September, 1662, to the archdeaconry of Durham; and to the firſt prebend in the cathedral church, which he exchanged for the ſecond, April 16, 1668. He had alſo, of his gift, the rectories of Eaſington and Elwick; and in the room of the latter, the living of Sedgefield. But he took a very regular and exemplary care of them, in the due diſcharge of all miniſterial functions, as appears by the directions given to his curates, printed among his works, On the 20th of December, 1670, he was created doctor in divinity, being then chaplain in ordinary to his majeſty, as he had been for ſeveral years before; and on the 14th of December, 1684, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled dean of Durham. Thus poſſeſſed of ſuch great preferments, he might have long enjoyed them with much profit and honour to himſelf and friends; and have continued to be an ornament to his function, and a general benefit to the world: But ſome abſurd notions entertained of the unlimited extent of the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, together with his ſtrict adherence to the doctrines of paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance, involved him in inextricable difficulties. For, poſſeſſed with the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0782100202:180"/>
indiſpenſableneſs of their obligation, upon the prince of Orange coming to reſcue this nation from the dangerous attempts made upon our religion and liberties, the dean oppoſed the meaſures taken for our common ſafety to the utmoſt of his power; by preaching, delivering charges to the clergy, ſending up an addreſs to king James, and ſubſcribing a ſum of money for his ſervice. And when all his endeavours proved ineffectual, he was ſo entangled with thoſe abſurd doctrines, that, rather than ſubmit to king William, he choſe to loſe his great preferments, and go into a voluntary exile; and, quitting Durham the 11th December, 1688, he arrived the 19th of March following, at Honfleur, in France. In February, 1689, he took a hazardous journey to England, whereby he got a ſmall ſupply of money, to ſubſiſt abroad. His brother, the earl of Bath, (who was warm in the intereſt of the prince of Orange) endeavoured for ſome time to ſecure his revenues; but as no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations whatever could induce him to ſwear allegiance to king William and queen Mary, he was at length deprived of all his preferments, February 1, 1690. He not only refuſed himſelf, but likewiſe did all in his power to deter, or rather to terrify others from taking the oaths, by repreſenting the revolution as a rebellion and uſurpation. Having no proſpect, after the late king James's defeat in Ireland, of recovering his benefices, he repaired to the abdicated monarch's court, at St Germain; where, though he had reaſon to expect an uncommonly kind reception, yet, becauſe he was a proteſtant, he was ſoon obliged to retire, not only from court, but alſo from the town. 'Tis ſaid, that upon the death of Dr Lamplugh, he had the empty title of archbiſhop of York conferred upon him by king James. In 1695, he came incognito to England, where he found no encouragement to make any ſtay. Having for ſome years enjoyed but an indifferent ſtate of health, he died at his lodgings in Paris, the 8th of April, 1703, aged 64, and was buried at the lower end of the church-yard of the Holy Innocents in that city. His nephew, lord Lanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down, draws his character to great advantage in the following words:—<q>Sanctity ſate ſo eaſy, ſo unaffected, and ſo graceful upon him, that in him we beheld the very beauty of holineſs. He was as chearful, as familiar, as condeſcending in his converſation, as he was ſtrict, regular, and exemplary in his piety; as well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and accompliſhed as a courtier, and as reverend and as venerable as an apoſtle. He was indeed apoſtolical in every thing, for he abandoned all to follow his lord and maſter.</q> From this man's example, we may learn the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and miſchief of propagating abſurd and unreaſonable doctrines. Since there will always be found ſome perſon or other, that will embrace and ſtiffly defend them, though never ſo much to their own, or others prejudice: All not being equally endowed with the ſame penetrating genius, or not having a yielding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience alike <note n="*" place="bottom">

Notes, ſays, he was born at Rouen, in Normandy, but quotes no authority; the place of his education is equally uncertain. The firſt of his being noted to us is under the patronage of biſhop Morton, who ordained him deacon and prieſt whilſt biſhop of Litchfield, and made him his chaplain: In September, 1636, he was collated to the church of Eggleſcliff; in July, 1640, he had the degree of doctor in divinity conferred upon him at Cambridge, by mandate, and was incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated in the ſame at Oxford, in November following; about which time he was made chaplain in ordinary to king Charles I.

At the age of eighteen he was placed at Emanuel College, Cambridge, and matriculated in the year 1634: In 1637, was admitted to the degree of bachelor of arts; and maſter of arts in 1641; the year following, was elected a fellow of his college; and took the degree of bache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor in divinity in 1648, but, refuſing to take the covenant, was ejected from his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in the year 1649; upon which he went abroad, and became intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the moſt conſiderable Engliſh loyaliſts then in exile.

                     </note>. Soon after the Reſtoration, Dr Sancroft came home, and biſhop Coſin, who knew him abroad, appointed him one of his chaplains; and on the 7th of December, 1661, he was collated to the rectory of Houghton-le-Spring, in which year he aſſiſted in renewing the liturgy. By mandamus, he was created doctor in divinity in the month of March, 1661-2; and on the 14th of Auguſt following, was elected maſter of Emanuel College, which he governed with great propriety. In the beginning of the year 1663-4, the doctor was promoted to the deanry of York, which he held but a ſhort time, yet long enough to expend 200l. more than the revenue produced, in repairs and other incident charges; during that ſhort period bringing the church accounts into excellent order. On the death of Dr John Barwick, in 1664, he was removed to the deanry of St Paul's, ſoon after which he reſigned Houghton, and the maſterſhip of Emanuel. He now gave much attention to the repairs of his church, till the fire, in 1666, occaſioned all his thoughts to be employed in rebuilding that fabric, to which he contributed 1400l. beſides un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied endeavours to promote a ſubſcription: He rebuilt the deanry houſe, and improved the revenue thereof, as well as other livings in his gift, as dean.

and hoſpitality. He reſigned this ſtall in 1674, having rebuilt the preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal houſe. He attended king Charles II. on his death bed, when it is ſaid, he made ſome remonſtrances, and preſſed ſundry exhortations on the ſovereign, towards which the complexion of the court had warmed his ſpirit. In 1686, the doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to act in the commiſſion iſſued by king James II. for eccleſiaſtical affairs; and in 1688, was committed to the Tower, with ſix other biſhops, for preſenting a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the king, againſt reading his majeſty's declaration of indulgence. The court pronouncing this petition libellous, on the 29th of June the prelates were tried for a miſdemeanour, but, to the general ſatisfaction of the nation, were acquitted. He engaged his good offices for the diſſenting Proteſtants, foreſeeing the revolution that was approaching. On the 3d of October, accompanied with eight biſhops, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the king, who had demanded their counſel, and then, with a freedom virtue only inſpires, urged the moſt ſerious and important advice to his ſovereign, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unhappy ſituation of the ſtate. A few days after, though very earneſtly preſſed by his majeſty, he refuſed to ſign a declaration of abhorrence of the Prince of Orange's deſigns; and on the 17th of November, he joined in another petition, for a free parliament. On the king's abdication, he ſigned, and concurred with the lords ſpiritual and temporal, aſſembled at Guildhall, in a declaration to the Prince of Orange for a free parliament, ſecurity of our laws, liberties, and properties, and of the church of England in particular, with a due indulgence to Proteſtant diſſenters: But when that prince and his conſort were declared king and queen, he refuſed to take the oaths to their majeſties, was ſuſpended the 1ſt of Auguſt, 1689, and deprived the 1ſt of February following. The above fact counteracts all the principles he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have adopted, and leaves his character under ſuſpicion, or marked with duplicity, inſincerity, and want of truth. The editor<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr Gutch.</note> of the Collectanea Curioſa, embarraſſed at this point, ſays, <q>As for the archbiſhop's character, let it be learned from his actions; for if we go for it to the writers of oppoſite parties, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in different hands, as different as poſſible. He certainly gave the ſtrongeſt inſtance poſſible of ſincerity, in ſacrificing the higheſt dignities, and other the greateſt advantages, to what he thought truth and honeſty.</q> He continued at Lambeth till June, 1691, and then retired to his native place, where he ſpent the remainder of his life in ſtrict retirement, and died on the 24th of November, 1693, aer. 77.

                  <p>EDMUND LAW, D.

He was alſo principally concerned in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing an excellent edition of <hi>Stephens's Theſaurus.</hi> In 1739, he accepted the rectory of Grayſtoke, to which he was preſented by the univerſity. When Mr Howard, now duke of Norfolk, ſold the advowſon, he ſtipulated with the purchaſer in favour of Mr Law, for a preſentation from a Proteſtant patron. Mr Law accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned this rectory, and had a new preſentation from Dr Aſkew, the purchaſer. This allowed him to remove to Salkeld, the corps of the archdeaconry of Carliſle, a much more healthy ſituation, given him by biſhop Fleming. While in Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he publiſhed <hi>Conſiderations on the Theory of Religion,</hi> which has gone through ſeveral editions; <hi>Litigiouſneſs repugnant to the Laws of Chriſtianity,</hi> an aſſize ſermon, at Carliſle, and a charge on the <hi>Nature and Neceſſity of Catechiſing.</hi> In 1747, he proceeded to doctor in divinity: The divinity ſchool was unuſually crowded, and the rigidly orthodox were ſo alarmed at his queſtion, that it gave occaſion to much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercation afterwards, in a variety of publications; but he himſelf, unwilling to give further offence, <q>thought it a part of Chriſtian prudence not to be more explicit on the ſubject, till men appear more willing to ſubmit their vain philoſophy to the authority of God's word, and are diſpoſed to examine things with greater atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0782100202:229"/>
and impartiality; concluding in the words of honeſt biſhop Taylor, that he had been ſo puſhed at by herds and flocks of people, that follow any body that whiſtles to them, or drives them to paſture, that he was grown afraid of any truth that ſeemed chargeable with ſingularity.</q> In 1755, he returned to Cambridge, having been choſen maſter of St Peter's College, when he reſigned the archdeaconry, but kept the rectory. He ſerved the office of vice-chancellor, in 1756, and, having a numerous family, he afterwards accepted the office of principal librarian, and that of caſuiſtical profeſſor; and had alſo the archdeaconry of Stafford, and a ſtall in the church of Lincoln, given him on his promotion to the See of Carliſle, in 1769; he kept the headſhip of his college, and had the rectory of Greyſtoke <hi>in commendam.</hi>— He publiſhed only two or three ſermons afterwards; but, though advanced to a great age, ſuch was his veneration for the great Mr Locke, and his love for freedom of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, that he ſurpriſed the world with an excellent edition of the works of that great philoſopher in four volumes, folio.—He is ſtill living.</p>

                  <p>AFTER a tedious arrangement of the ſeveral eccleſiaſtics who ſat in this church, the reader's attention is required to a deſcription of the ſacred edifices, with a comparative view of their ancient ſtate and ornaments.</p>
                  <p>The traveller is conducted to this cathedral by the Place or Place-Green, where the whole north front lies open to the view. The ſituation is ſingularly grand and noble, the building ſtretching along the crown of an eminence, about eighty feet perpendicular from the ſurface of the river, which waſhes its baſe; on the eaſt ſide
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0782100202:238"/>
the Bailey intervenes between the church and the brink of the hill; and on the weſt this venerable pile riſes on the points of rocks, which ſhew themſelves on the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the mount, and almoſt overhangs the ſtream: On this elevated ground the whole edifice has the moſt ſtriking and auguſt appearance. The towers to the weſt were anciently crowned with ſpires, covered with lead; the windows of the nave are under circular arches, of the original model; in the other parts (excepting the upper tier of the choir) moſt of them are of a different form and age. This front is now under repair, the ſtones being all chiſſeled over, and the decayed parts reſtored; the towers will receive new decorations, very different from the ancient ones, and the niches be ſupplied with new ſculptures; the expence is eſtimated at thirty thouſand pounds, to be paid out of the Chapter's treaſury:—A diſtinguiſhed act of public munificence!</p>
                  <p>As the propoſed changes will effectually remove from the traveller's eye the ancient appearance of this edifice, it was thought expedient to preſent the public with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the church in the ſtate it was before the repairs began; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the elegance of the preſent deſign, it is apprehended ſome of the ornaments might have been choſen with greater propriety: Above the great win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the middle tranſept, in two roundels, were the figures of Benedictine monks, cut in relief; by the mode of the ſculpture, expreſſive of the age of the building. They led the judicious eye immediately to the aera, and gave an example of the ſtate of that art: Theſe roundels are now ſupplied with two fine new figures—the one a prior, ſeated in his inſtallation chair; the other, an effigy of biſhop Pudſey, cut from the figure on his epiſcopal ſeal, as given in the plate of his charter to the city of Durham <note n="*" place="bottom">See page 13.</note>. A century after this the figures will betray the ſpectator into an error, and lead him to determine, that this part of the ſtructure was erected, or at leaſt rebuilt, by that prelate. On the weſt corner tower of the eaſt tranſept, were the effigies of thoſe perſonages who attended the propitious cow, by which the monks diſcovered this ſeat of eaſe and magnificence; the cut ſhews the receſs and ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their decayed ſtate, the figures being now reſtored and finiſhed with much

art. The great tower of the church, as remarked in the preceding part of this work, is much more modern than the reſt, being built as high as the gallery, by prior Melſanby, who acceded in the year 1233, and his ſucceſſor, prior Middleton: Prior Hugh, of Darlington, who was elected in 1258, finiſhed the work, by build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the belfrey or upper tower. The tabernacle work, pointed arches, and ornament on the outſides of the building, confirm thoſe dates; for then the Gothic ſtile was in general acceptation: The buttreſſes of the tower are graced with niches canopied and finiſhed with tabernacle work, in which are ſtatues repreſenting the great patrons of the See, in tolerable ſculpture. The height of this tower, Willis ſays, is two hundred and twenty-three feet, deſcribing the lanthern to be one hundred and ſixty-two feet, and the belfrey ſixty-one feet; but Mr Nicholſon's admeaſurement, which is moſt to be depended upon, makes the whole height two hundred and fourteen feet, that is, the dome or lanthern one hundred and ſixty, and the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey fifty-four feet.</p>
                  <p>It appears that the Place-Green, before prior Algar's time, in 1109, was crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with houſes, and to him we owe that great elegance of an open area between the cathedral and caſtle, giving the two edifices at once to the ſpectator's view; he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſed the buildings to be removed, and the ground to be reduced to a plain. The entrance to the church was by a portico, of much more modern work than the reſt of the building, formed by pilaſters and circular arches, the upper ſtructure ſupported by flanking buttreſſes, from whence ſprung a pointed arch, the whole terminating at a point in the center: The arms of queen Elizabeth, in ſtucco work, were placed on the diviſion of two circular arches, where formerly were the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of a ſmall chapel: The portico, during the late repairs, was rebuilt and highly ornamented: There were anciently two chambers above the north door, where perſons were lodged to hear the call of ſuch as came to claim ſanctuary, and who rang the bell to give notice thereof; after which the fugitive was ſecure from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular authority<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>In ancient time, before the houſe was ſuppreſt, the abbey church, the church-yard, and all the circuit thereof, was a ſanctuary for all manner of men that committed any great offence, as killing of a man in his own defence, or any priſoners who had broken out of priſon, and fled to the church door, knocking to have it opened: Alſo certain men lay in two chambers over the north door for that purpoſe, that when any ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders came and knocked, they inſtantly let them in at any hour of the night; and run quickly to the galilee bell, and tolled it, that whoſoever heard it might know that ſome had taken ſanctuary When the prior had notice thereof, he ſent orders to keep themſelves within the ſanctuary; that is, within the church and church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and that every one ſhould have a gown of black cloth, with a yellow croſs, called St Cuthbert's croſs, at the left ſhoulder, that every one might ſee the privilege granted to St Cuthbert's ſhrine, for offenders to fly unto for ſuccour, and ſafeguard of their lives, till they could obtain their prince's pardon: And that they ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This ſtile prevailed till about the concluſion of king Henry the Firſt's reign, when, what we now call Gothic was inſtroduced into Britain, ſo that in this church we find ſome ſtrokes of the improved ſtile; for as the building was begun in 1093, ſo it was many years before it was completed: The walls were leſt unrooſed by biſhop Flambard at his death; and the reader will recollect that biſhop William brought the deſign with him from Normandy<note n="†" place="bottom">

The gateway, which is ten feet wide, is ornamented within on each hand with pilaſters; the inner one, or that neareſt the gate, very richly emboſſed with foliage, and figures in a light and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſtile; the other plain: The inclining arches are ſemi-circular; the inner mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers carved in the zig-zag figure; the outward one embatteled or dentelled. The venerable pile ſtrikes the viſitor on his entrance with an awful ſolemnity not to be expreſſed; the ſtately and maſſive columns, the long extended ailes, the gloom which ſhadows the ſucceſſion of arches, all contribute to affect the mind with an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention beſt known by being experienced: Ideas ariſe replete with the diſtant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of the place, the piety of thoſe from whom the ſtructure had its origin, and the devotion which warmed the breaſts of the religious whoſe characteriſtic virtues ſhone forth in the holy places. The plan or deſign of this building is more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar than generally to be found in ſtructures of the like age: The length of the whole church within, excluſive of the gallilee, is four hundred and eleven feet; that of the nave, from the weſt window to the center of the columns which ſupport the tower, is two hundred feet, and its width ſeventy-four feet, of which the center aile, from baſe to baſe of the pillars, is twenty-eight feet. The ſuperſtructure is ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on two rows of columns. Mr Pennant ſays, the pillars are vaſt cylinders twenty-three feet in circumference: The two extreme columns to the weſt riſe from baſes of the form of a complicated croſs, having pointed projections from the interior angles; the dimenſions of each baſe are fifteen feet every way, being exactly ſimilar
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0782100202:241"/>
to thoſe which ſupport the columns of the tower and dome, vulgarly called the lanthern; the pillars are cluſtered, having three ſemi-circular pilaſters in each front, divided by an angular projection: The next column eaſtward riſes from a baſe of the form of a croſs, twelve feet each way, ſupporting a cluſtered pillar, the pilaſters of which, towards the center aile, run up to the roof through the facia, between the upper windows; the next riſes from a ſquare baſe of eight feet, and is richly fluted, terminating with a plain capital, which ſupports the gallery above the ſide aile: Each intermediate pillar is cluſtered like thoſe deſcribed in the ſecond place, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the roof, and thoſe in the intervals are circular, making the ſucceſſion conſiſt of a cluſtered pillar, and a round one alternately; the firſt round pillar is fluted as before deſcribed, the ſecond covered with the zig-zag figure, and the third grooved with the figure of a net. The pillars oppoſite to each other are exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſimilar in ornaments and dimenſions: It is alſo to be obſerved, the cluſtered and round pillars through all the building have their baſes of the dimenſions before ſet forth: All the ſide walls are decorated with pilaſters oppoſite to the columns, and the interior ſpaces under the windows are filled with double pilaſters and interſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round arches throughout the whole building, except only in the eaſt tranſept. The arches between the great columns are all ſemi-circular, the outward members dentelled, the interiors zig-zag'd: The under gallery opens to the middle aile, with one round arch divided within into two arches, ſupported on a center pillar. There is an upper gallery of ſingle arches. At the weſt end of the nave is a ſhort croſs aile or tranſcept, in length ninety feet, and eighteen feet wide from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the columns, over the ends of which riſe the weſt towers; according to Willis, one hundred and fifty-eight feet in height, but by Nicholſon's admeaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only one hundred and thirty-eight feet. At the end of each ſide aile is a gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which opens into the gallilee. The ancient ornaments of the north aile are pointed out to the reader in the notes<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>At the entrance of the north aile was a trellice door from pillar to pillar, which opened and ſhut with two leaves, like a folding door. Above it was likewiſe trelliced almoſt to the height of the vault, and on the top of the ſaid trellice were iron pikes, that none ſhould climb over it: It was never opened but on holidays, and at proceſſions; and the north rood on the other ſide of the ſame pillar, at the north end of Jeſus' altar, was likewiſe never opened but to admit ſome proceſſion.</p>
                        <p>There were two holy water ſtones belonging the church, of a fine blue marble; the beſt ſtood within and oppoſite to the north church door, fixed in the corner of the pillar adjoining to the Lady of Pittie's altar, on the left hand as you turn into the gallilee, having a beautiful ſcreen of wainſcot, finely painted with blue and little gilt ſtars: It was kept very clean and freſh water always provided againſt Sunday morning, hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before divine ſervice by one of the monks.</p>
                        <p>The other ſtood within the ſouth door, and ſupplied with freſh water every Sunday morning. That at the ſouth door, ſerved the prior, the convent, and the whole houſe; the other being for the uſe of thoſe who came that way to hear divine ſervice.</p>
                        <p>There was between two pillars, on the left hand, in the north aile, as you go into the gallilee from the north door, our Lady of Pittie's altar, incloſed on each ſide with wainſcot, with the picture of our lady ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting our Saviour on her knee, as he was taken from the croſs.</p>
                        <p>And on the right hand of the ſaid north aile, at going into the gallilee, under the belfrey, called the galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee ſteeple, was St Saviour's altar.</p>
                        <p>In the weſt end of the church, and of the north aile over the gallilee door, is a belfrey, called the gallilee ſteeple, wherein hung four great bells, which were never rung but at principal feaſts, or when the biſhop came to town.</p>
                        <p>Every Sunday a ſermon was preached in the gallilee, from one to three in the afternoon; previous to which, at twelve, the great bell of the gallilee tolled three quarters of an hour, and rung the fourth quarter. There were certain officers of the ſaid houſe, who were always charged, whenever the bells were to be tolled, to be in readineſs to ring them: But after the houſe was ſuppreſſed the bells were never rung. In queen Elizabeth's reign dean Whittingham intended to have them taken down and broken; when Thomas Spark, the biſhop's ſuffragan, having notice of the dean's purpoſe, ſent directly into Yorkſhire for a workman, and cauſed three of the bells to be taken down, and hung up in the new work, called the lanthern, where he made a ſet of chimes, which coſt him thirty or forty pounds.</p>
                        <p>The loweſt window towards the lanthern had three lights divided with ſtone work. The picture of Chriſt crucified was in the middle of the firſt light; and in the ſecond was the picture of our bleſſed Lady; on the other ſide that of St John the Evangeliſt: On one ſide of Chriſt was a monk in a blue habit, kneeling and holding up his hands. And above were ſix turret windows in plain glaſs.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond window had two long lights divided with ſtone work, and in white glaſs, with coloured glaſs about it.</p>
                        <p>In the third were two long lights, divided with ſtone work, having in the firſt light the picture of St Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and underneath her St Oſwald, and below, that of St Cuthbert. In the ſecond light was pictured the bleſſed Virgin, with Chriſt in her arms, and underneath St Bede, and below him St Oſmond, biſhop, and the arms of St Cuthbert and St Oſwald; and four turret windows without pictures, in coloured glaſs.</p>
                        <p>The fourth window was plain, and as the ſecond, with coloured glaſs about it.</p>
                        <p>In the fifth window were two long lights, divided as aforeſaid, in white glaſs without pictures, but having round about coloured glaſs; and five turret windows; firſt four, and one at the top.</p>
                        <p>The ſixth window had two long lights, with a ſtone work partition: In the firſt light was the picture of St Oſwald, and under him St Paul; and in the ſecond light was that of St Peter, and underneath him St James, in fine coloured glaſs: And above four turret lights, with biſhop Skirlaw's arms on the top.</p>
                        <p>Within the church were two marble holy water ſtones, boſſed with hollow boſſes, on the outſides thereof curiouſly wrought: That at the north door was twice as capacious as the other at the ſouth, both of the ſame workmanſhip. Theſe were taken away by dean Whittingham, and removed into his kitchen, and employed to prophane uſes. They ſtood there during his life: his ſervants ſteeped their beef and ſalt fiſh in them, there being a conveyance in the bottoms to let out the water, as they had when in the church. After that dean's death the greater was removed to the lower end of the dean's buttery, where the water conduit is, and next unto the wine cellar, for the ſervants to waſh their pots and cups in, before they ſerved them at table. The baſe of the great holy water ſtone was laid without the north church door, and afterwards placed in the earth, in the ſhop of one Lamb a black-ſmith, upon Framwellgate bridge.—Con. from Davies, Sir John Lawſon's MSS. and Mr Hogg's Roll.</p>

to this aile, but all the old painted glaſs is deſtroyed. The vaultings of the ſide ailes are ſemi-circular, and croſſed with groined arches in plain rolls, interſecting each other in the center. The middle aile of the nave is ſixty-nine and a half feet in height; the roof was vaulted with ſtone about the year 1242, by prior Melſonby; the ribs interſect each other in pointed arches, ornamented with zig-zag workin the fillets: There are ſeven upper windows to the north, and ſix to the ſouth. At the eaſt end of the nave, between the pillars which ſupport the great tower, anciently ſtood Jeſus's altar, with all its decorations, no traces of which remain <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>In the body of the church, between two of the higheſt pillars ſupporting the weſt ſide of the lanthern, oppoſite to the choir door, was Jeſus' altar, where maſs was ſung every Friday in the year; and on the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide was a high ſtone wall, at each end whereof was a door, and called the two rood doors, for the proceſſion to go forth and return at: Each end of the altar was cloſed up with fine wainſcot, like to a porch, adjoining to each rood door, finely varniſhed with red varniſh. In the wainſcot, at the ſouth end of the altar, were four grand almeries, to preſerve the chalices and ſilver crewets, with two or three ſuits of veſtments, and other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments belonging to the ſaid altar, for holy and principal days: And at the north end of the altar, in the wainſcot, was a door to come into the ſaid porch. There was alſo ſtanding on the altar, a moſt curious fine table, with two leaves to open and ſhut, comprehending the Paſſion of our Lord, richly ſet in fine lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, all like burniſhed gold; which table was always locked up, but on principal days. Alſo the fore-part of the ſaid porch, was a door with two broad leaves, to open from ſide to ſide, all of fine through-carved work: On the principal days, when any of the monks ſaid maſs at the ſaid altar, the table was opened, and the door, which compoſed the fore-part of the ſaid porch, that every man might come in and ſee the table.</p>
                        <p>There was alſo in the height of the wall, from pillar to pillar, the whole ſtory and paſſion of our Lord, wrought in ſtone, and curiouſly gilt: And above was the whole ſtory and pictures of the twelve apoſtles, very artifically ſet forth, and finely gilt, extending from one pillar to the other. And on the top above all, a border artificially wrought in ſtone, with fine colours, and gilt, with branches and flowers. And likewiſe above the top of all, upon the wall, ſtood the moſt famous rood that was in all the land, with the picture of Mary on one ſide of our Saviour, and that of St John on the other, with two archangels.</p>
                        <p>Alſo on the back of the ſaid rood, before the choir door, there was a loft, and the clock ſtood in the ſouth end thereof.</p>
                        <p>Every Friday, after evening prayer, an anthem was ſung in the body of the church, before St John's altar, called Jeſus' anthem, which was performed by the maſter and choir, who ſung another anthem ſitting on their knees before Jeſus' altar, one of the gallilee bells tolling.—Davies, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>Thomas Caſtell, prior of Durham, lies buried under a handſome marble ſtone in the body of the church, before Jeſus' altar, being pictured in braſs from the waiſt up, with his epitaph: Oppoſite to which, between two pillars on the north ſide, was a loft, containing a pair of organs for the uſe of the maſter and quiriſters, at ſinging Jeſus' maſs and anthem every Friday, with a deſk to lay the books on in time of divine ſervice.</p>

                     </note>. In the center of the four weſt pillars, is the font, an elegant marble baſon, over which is a fine piece of tabernacle work in red oak, of an octagon form, richly ornamented, and of excellent workmanſhip, ſupported by four columns about eight feet in height, the whole being about thirty feet high, terminating in a pinnacle, and decorated with a dove extending her wings. To the eaſt of the font, between pillar and pillar, is a croſs of black marble laid in the pavement, beyond which women were ſtrictly prohibited advancing towards St Cuthbert's ſhrine <note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <p>There is, betwixt the pillar on the north ſide wherein the holy water ſtone ſtood, and the oppoſite pillar on the ſouth ſide, a row of blue marble in the midſt whereof is a croſs of the ſame coloured marble, in token that all women who came to hear divine ſervice, ſhould not be ſuffered to come above the ſaid croſs: And if it happened that any woman came above it, ſhe was inſtantly puniſhed for certain days, becauſe no woman preſumed to come where the holy man St Cuthbert was, for the reverence they had to his ſacred body.</p>
                        <p>Alſo if any woman happened to come within the abbey gates, or within the precincts of the houſe, ſhe was puniſhed as an example to deter others from doing the like.</p>

                        <p>Divers books of the life and miracles of St Cuthbert have been written, which ſet forth, That St Cuthbert, for a long time, led a moſt recluſe life, in the borders of the Picts; in which time it happened that the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the king of that province was got with child by ſome young man in her father's houſe. The king per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her pregnancy, diligently examined her who was the cauſe of that fact; whereupon ſhe made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: That ſolitary young man who dwelleth hard by, is he who hath overcome me, and by whoſe beauty I am thus deceived. Whereupon the king repaired to the hermit's place, with his deflowered daughter, attended by divers knights, where he inſtantly accoſted the ſervant of God in this manner: What art thou he, who, under the colour of religion, prophaneſt the temple and ſanctuary of God? Art thou he, who, under the cloak and profeſſion of an hermit, exerciſeſt thyſelf in all filthineſs? Behold my daughter, whom thou by thy wile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The king's daughter marking the fierce ſpeeches of her father, very impudently ſtepped forth, and boldly affirmed, that it was he who had done that wicked fact: At which the young man, greatly amazed, perceiving that this calumny proceeded from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of the Devil, applied his whole heart unto Almighty God, ſaying: My Lord, my God, who only knoweſt, and art the diſcoverer of all ſecrets, make manifeſt alſo this work of iniquity, and by ſome token diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ſame, which, though it cannot be done by human policy, make it known by ſome divine token. When the young man had ſpoken theſe words, ſuddenly, and in the ſame place where the ſtood, the earth making a hiſſing noiſe, preſently opened, and ſwallowed her up in the preſence of all the ſpectators.

Whereupon he, with his company, humbly craving pardon of Almighty God, with a further petition to that good man St Cuthbert, that by his prayers he would crave of God to have his daughter again: Which petition the holy father granted, upon condition, that from thence no woman ſhould come near him.

Ralph lord Nevil died in the year 1347, and, as I obſerved before, was the firſt layman ſuffered to be buried within the walls of this church. His remains were brought in a chariot drawn by ſeven horſes, as far as the gates of the church-yard, and then borne on the ſhoulders of his knights into the church: The abbot of St Mary's, of York, performed the funeral offices, and he was interred before the altar of the holy croſs, where he obtained a maſs to be daily ſaid: His wife Alicia was afterwards buried near him. It was then a cuſtom to make offerings at the interment of great men, and eight horſes, four for war, with four men armed and capariſoned, and four for peace, were on this occaſion the holy gift; together with three veſtments of cloth of gold, interwoven with flowers. His ſon, John Nevil, redeemed four horſes by the payment of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred mares: But Mr Pennant obſerves, <q>This favour was not done gratis by the holy men of the place: Ralph had preſented them with a veſtment of red velvet, richly embroidered with gold, ſilk, great pearls, and images of ſaints, dedicated to St Cuthbert <note n="*" place="bottom">

The eaſt end of the porch, where the altar ſtood, was cloſed up with a little ſtone wall higher than the altar, and wainſcotted above the wall; and the weſt end with a little ſtone wall, and an iron grate on the top of it, and the north ſide towards the body of the church was invironed with iron.</p>
                        <p>Alſo on the back part behind Nevil's altar, to the midſt of the pillar behind the church door, in compaſs from pillar to pillar, there was a chamber, where one that kept the church, and rung the bells at midnight lodged: And over the church door, the compaſs of four pillars, two on either ſide, when one entered within the church door, was all covered above head with wainſcot, very finely painted, and varniſhed azure, and ſet out with ſtars of gold. And in the fore-part of the wainſcot, from pillar to pillar, within the church, over the holy water ſtone, there was a brattiſhing on the fore part of the wainſcot or roof, very curiouſly wrought, and gilt with gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the midſt of the brattiſhing was a ſtar of great compaſs, like the ſun, very curiouſly wrought with gold, and enamelled; ſo there could no duſt or filth fall into the holy water ſtone.</p>

                                    <p>There were three pair of organs belonging to the ſaid choir, for maintenance of God's ſervice, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter celebrating thereof. The grandeſt of the three ſtood over the choir door, only opened and played upon on principal feaſts, the pipes being all of the fineſt wood and workmanſhip, partly gilt upon the inſide, and the outſide of the leaves and cover up to the top, with branches and flowers, finely gilt, with the name of Jeſus gilt with gold. There were but two pair more of them in England of the ſame make; one pair in York, and another in St Paul's.</p>
                                    <p>Alſo there was a lettern of wood, like unto a pulpit, ſtanding and adjoining to the wood organs, over the choir door, where they uſed to ſing the nine leſſons in the old time on principal days, ſtanding with their faces towards the high altar.</p>
                                    <p>The ſecond pair ſtood on the north ſide of the choir, being never played upon, but when the four doctors of the church were read, viz. Auguſtine, Ambroſe, Gregory, and Jerome, being a pair of fair large organs, called the cryers.</p>

                        <p>The admeaſurement is here taken from without, but as the pavement of this church was new laid, and the tombſtones removed about the year 1660, and you deſcend into the church by three ſteps, the addition may make 161 feet, 6 inches.</p>
                        <p>In the lanthern, called the new work, hung three fine bells, rung always at twelve o'clock at night; the monks going to mattins at that hour; four men were appointed to ring theſe bells at midnight, and at ſuch times of the day as the monks went to ſerve God; two of the ſaid men belonged to the reveſtry, and kept the copes, the veſtments, and five pair of ſilver cenſers, with the other ornaments pertaining to the high altar, and lay in the chamber over the weſt end of the reveſtry: The other two men lay in a chamber in the north aile, over againſt the ſacriſt's exchequer; they ſwept and kept the church clean, and filled the holy water ſtones every Sunday morning, and locked the church doors every night.</p>
                        <p>The ſteeple of this cathedral, a ſtately fabric, is remarkable as well for its height as ſtrength and juſt archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, having on the inſide a gallery of ſtone work around it, above the turn of the arches of the pillars upon which it is founded; above which are eight long windows, two on each front of the ſteeple, divided in the middle by a croſs bar of ſtone, and handſomely glazed with plain glaſs. Above the windows, on the outſide, is another gallery, and above that a ſuperſtructure, having two windows on each front, wherein hang eight melodious bells. In the eight buttreſſes, on the ſides of the lower windows, alſo in the ſtone work betwixt each window, are niches, containing the ſtatues of the founders, protectors, and benefactors.—Davies, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>As I noted before, theſe eight bells were caſt in 1632, from the metal of the gallilee bells, and thoſe of the lanthern, and coſt 128l. 12s. 7d. and were recaſt in 1693.</p>

in the beginning of the thirteenth century, has many marks of a refined taſte: Round the bottom of the dome is a hanging gallery ſupported on corbles, each intermediate one ſculptured with a human figure; the breaſt work or battlement of the gallery is formed in open roſe work: The ſuperſtructure is ornamented in pannels with pilaſters, terminating in tabernacle work: There are two long windows in each front, ſeparated by a round pilaſter, whoſe capital is pierced in flowers and foliage; pilaſters of the ſame order are placed in the angles, and from the eight pilaſters ſpring the groins of the arched roof or vault of the dome, which are braced at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, and finiſhed with a circle in the center, in a light and beautiful taſte.</p>
                  <p>The aſcent from the tranſept is by two marble ſteps to the choir, entering which, the viſitor is ſtruck with the magnificence and ſolemnity of the ſcene. The choir is one hundred and twenty feet in length, and in width equal to the center aile of the nave, the chief pillars running parallel through the whole building. The ſide ailes are not ſo wide as thoſe of the nave, the width of the choir being only ſeventy-ſix feet. The floor is laid with black and white marble<note n="*" place="bottom">

                                    <p>In the eaſt end of the choir, joining upon St Cuthbert's feretory, ſtood the high altar, with many precious and coſtly ornaments appertaining to it, as well for every principal day, as for every of our Lady's days. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſaid high altar and St Cuthbert's feretory, was all of French Pierre, curiouſly wrought both on the outſide and the inſide, with images of alabaſter, and gilt; being called in the ancient hiſtory Lardoſe. The ſaid French Pierre or Lardoſe, reaching in height almoſt to the middle vault, and containing the breadth of the choir in length. In the midſt whereof, right over the high altar, were placed, in very fine alabaſter, the picture of our Lady ſtanding in the midſt, and the picture of St Cuthbert on one ſide, and of St Oſwald on the other, all richly gilt. And at either end of this altar was a wand of iron faſtened in the wall, whereon hung curtains or hangings of white ſilk daily. The daily ornaments that were hung both before the altar and above, were of red velvet, with flowers of gold, in embroidered work, and many pictures beſides very finely gilt: But the ornaments for the principal feaſt, the aſſumption of our Lady, were all of white damaſk, beſet with pearls and precious ſtones.</p>
                                    <p>Within the ſaid choir, over the high altar, hung a rich and moſt ſumptuous canopy, for the bleſſed ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which had two irons faſtened in the French Pierre, finely gilt; which held the canopy over the midſt of the ſaid high altar, that it could not move or ſtir; whereon ſtood a pelican of ſilver, upon the height of the ſaid canopy, very finely gilt, giving her blood to her young ones. And the pix was of pure gold, curiouſly wrought; and the white cloth that hung over the pix was of very fine lawn, embroidered and wrought with gold and red ſilk; and four great round knobs of gold curiouſly wrought, with taſſels of gold and red ſilk hung at them, and the four corners of the white lawn cloth; and the crook that hung within the cloth, that the pix hung upon, was of gold; and the cord that drew it up and down was made of fine ſtrong white ſilk. And when the monks went to high maſs, they put on their veſtments in the reveſtry, both the epiſtler and goſpeller; And when the office of the maſs began to be ſung, the epiſtler came forth out of the reveſtry, the other two monks following him, at the ſouth choir door, and there ſtood till the Gloria Patri or the office of the maſs began to be ſung; and then with great reverence and devotion, they went all up to the altar; and one of the vergers that kept the reveſtry went before them, with a large tip-ſtaff in his hand. The goſpeller carried a fair book, which had the epiſtles and goſpels in it, and laid it on the altar; which book had on the outſide of the covering, the picture of our Saviour, of ſilver, of goldſmith's work, parcel-gilt; which book did ſerve for the pix in the maſs. The epiſtler, when he had ſung the epiſtle, laid the book again upon the altar; and afterwards when the goſpel was ſung, the goſpeller did lay it down upon the altar likewiſe, until the maſs was done.</p>

Divers of the veſtments were ſet round about with pearls, both ſtoles and ſtannels. There were alſo other very rich jewels and ornaments per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the ſaid high altar.</p>
                                    <p>There were alſo two croſſes to be borne on principal days for proceſſion; one for gold, and the ſtaff it ſtood in was of ſilver, of goldſmith's work, very curiouſly wrought, and double gilt. The other croſs was of ſilver, double gilt, and the ſtaff was of wood, of the ſame workmanſhip, and double gilt. Alſo there was another croſs of cryſtal that ſerved for every day in the week. There was borne before the croſs every principal day, a holy water font, of ſilver, very finely engraved, and parcel-gilt, which one of the novices carried.</p>
                                    <p>In the north ſide of the choir there is an almery nigh to the high altar, faſtened in the wall, to lay any thing in, pertaining to the high altar.</p>
                                    <p>There is likewiſe another almery in the ſouth ſide of the choir, nigh the high altar, incloſed in the wall, to ſet the chalices, baſons, and the crewets in.</p>
                                    <p>At the north end of the high altar there was a very fine lettern of braſs, where they ſung the epiſtle and the goſpel, with a great pelican on the height of it, finely gilt, billing the blood out of her breaſt to feed her young ones, and her wings ſpread abroad, whereon lay the book, in which they ſung the epiſtle and goſpel; it was thought to be the fineſt lettern of braſs in this country. It was all to be taken aſunder with wreſts, every joint from the other.</p>
                                    <p>Alſo there was lower down in the choir another lettern of braſs, not ſo curiouſly wrought, ſtanding in the midſt againſt the ſtalls, a very beautiful one, with an eagle on the height of it, and her wings-ſpread abroad, whereon the monks laid their books when they ſung their legends, at mattins, or other times of ſervice.</p>
                                    <p>Before the high altar were three fine ſilver baſons hanging in chains of ſilver, one on the ſouth ſide of the choir, above the ſteps going up to the high altar; the ſecond on the north ſide, oppoſite to the firſt; the third in the midſt between them both, juſt before the high altar. Theſe three ſilver baſons had latten baſons within them, having pricks for ſerges or great waxen candles to ſtand on; the latten baſons being to receive the drops of the three candles, which burned day and night.</p>
                                    <p>There was alſo another ſilver baſon hanging in ſilver chains before the ſacrament of the aforeſaid high altar, but nearer to the ſaid altars than the others, hanging almoſt over the prieſt's back, which was only lighted in time of maſs, and that ended, extinguiſhed.</p>
                                    <p>Alſo there was a handſome monument belonging to the church, called the paſchal, which uſed to be ſet up in the choir, and there to remain from the Thurſday, called Maunday Thurſday before Eaſter, till the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday after Aſcenſion-day. It ſtood upon a four-ſquare thick plank of wood, againſt the firſt grees or ſtep, behind the three baſons of ſilver that hung before the high altar: At every corner of the ſaid plank was an iron ring, whereunto the feet of the paſchal were adjoined, repreſenting the pictures of the four flying dragons; as alſo the pictures of the four evangeliſts, above the top of the dragons, underneath the nethermoſt boſs, all ſupporting the whole paſchal; and the four quarters have been four chryſtal ſtones, as appear by the holes: And on every ſide of the four dragons there is a curious antique work, as beaſts, men upon horſeback, with bucklers, bows, and ſhafts, and knots, with broad leaves ſpread upon the knots, very finely wrought, all being of the fineſt and moſt curious candleſtick metal, or latten metal, having ſix candleſticks or flowers of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick metal coming from it, three on either ſide, whereon ſtood a taper of wax: And on the height of the ſaid candleſtick was a large pretty flower, being the principal flower, which was the ſeventh candleſtick. The paſchal in latitude contained almoſt the breadth of the choir, in longitude it extended to the height of the lower vault, whereon ſtood a long piece of wood reaching within a man's length to the uppermoſt vault or roof of the church, upon which ſtood a great, long ſquared taper of wax, called the paſchal; having a fine convenience through the ſaid roof of the church to light the taper. The paſchal was eſteemed to be one of the rareſt monuments in England.</p>

                                    <p>Within the church of Durham, upon Good Friday, there was a moſt ſolemn ſervice; in which two of the eldeſt monks took a large beautiful crucifix, all of gold, laying it upon a velvet cuſhion, having St Cuthbert's

And there one of the ſaid monks roſe and went a pretty ſpace from it, ſitting down upon his knees, with his ſhoes put off, crept upon his knees unto the ſaid croſs, and kiſt it; and after him the other monk did ſo likewiſe; and they ſat down on either ſide of the ſaid croſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> holding it betwixt them; after that the prior came out of his ſtall, and ſat down upon his knees with his ſhoes off: And in like manner crept unto the ſaid croſs, and all the monks after him, one after another in the ſame order; in the mean time the whole choir ſinging a hymn. The ſervice being ended, the ſaid two monks carried the croſs to the ſepulchre with great reverence; (which was ſet up that morning on the north ſide of the choir, nigh unto the high altar, before the ſervice time) and there laid it in the ſaid ſepulchre with great devotion, with another picture of our Saviour Chriſt, in whoſe breaſt they incloſed, with great reverence, the moſt holy and bleſſed ſacrament of the altar; ſetting two tapers lighted before it, which burned till Eaſter day in the morning that it was taken forth.</p>

                                    <p>There was in the church of Durham very ſolemn ſervice upon Eaſter day, between three and four o'clock in the morning, in honour of the reſurrection, where two of the eldeſt monks of the choir came to the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre ſet up on Good Friday, covered with red velvet, and embroidered with gold, and then cenſed it, each monk with a pair of ſilver cenſers, ſitting on their knees before the ſepulchre. Then they both riſing came to the ſepulchre, out of which, with great reverence, they took a beautiful image of our Saviour, repreſenting the reſurrection, with a croſs in his hand, in the breaſt whereof was incloſed in cryſtal, the holy ſacrament of the altar; through which cryſtal the bleſſed hoſt was conſpicuous to the beholders. Then after the elevation of the ſaid picture, carried by the ſaid two monks upon a velvet cuſhion embroidered, ſinging the anthem of <hi>Chriſtus Reſurgens,</hi> they brought it to the high altar, ſetting it on the midſt thereof, the two monks kneeling before the altar, and cenſing it all the time that the reſt of the choir were ſinging the aforeſaid anthem of <hi>Chriſtus Reſurgens;</hi> which anthem being ended, the two monks took up the cuſhion and the picture from the altar, ſupporting it betwixt them, and proceeding in proceſſion from the high altar to the ſouth choir door, where there were four ancient gentlemen, belonging to the prior, appointed to attend their coming, holding up a very rich canopy of purple velvet, taſsled round about with red ſilk, and a gold fringe, and at every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the canopy ſtood one of the ancient gentlemen to bear it over the ſaid image, with the holy ſacrament carried by the two monks round about the church, the whole choir waiting upon it with torches and a great number of other lights, all ſinging, rejoicing, and praying to God moſt devoutly, till they returned to the high altar, whereon they placed the ſaid image, there to remain till Aſcenſion day.</p>
                                    <p>Ludovicus de Bello Monte, biſhop of Durham, lies buried before the high altar in the choir, under a moſt curious and ſumptuous marble ſtone, which he prepared for himſelf before he died; being adorned with moſt excellent workmanſhip of braſs, whereon he was moſt excellently and lively pictured, as he was accuſtomed to ſing or ſay maſs, with his mitre on his head, and his croſier ſtaff in his hand, with two angels finely pictur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, one on the one ſide of his head, and the other on the other ſide, with cenſers in their hands cenſing him; and containing alſo pictures and image of the twelve apoſtles, divided and bordered on either ſide of him; and next them are bordered on each ſide of the twelve apoſtles, in another border, the pictures of his anceſtors, in their coats of arms, being of the blood royal of France; he had a white lion placed upon the breaſt of his veſtment, underneath the verſes of his breaſt, with flower-de-luces about the lion; and two lions pictured, one under one foot of him, and the other under his other foot, ſupporting and holding up his croſier ſtaff, his feet adjoining and ſtanding upon the ſaid lions; and two other lions beneath them, in the nethermoſt border of all, being very artificially wrought in braſs.</p>

                        <p>Dr Richard Croſby, maſter of the novices.</p>
                        <p>There was always ſix novices, who went daily to ſchool within the houſe, for the ſpace of ſeven years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one of the eldeſt and moſt learned monks was their tutor. The ſaid novices had no wages, but meat, drink, and apparel, for that ſpace. The maſter, or tutor's office was to ſee they wanted nothing; as cowls, frocks, ſtamyne, bedding, boots, ſocks; and as ſoon as they needed any of theſe neceſſaries, the maſter had charge to call at the chamberlain's for ſuch things. They never received wages, nor handled money in that time, but went daily to their books in the cloyſter: And if the maſter found any of them more apt to learn, and diligently proſecuting his ſtudies, then he gave notice thereof to the prior, and he was ſoon ſent to Oxford, there to learn and ſtudy divinity, and the reſt of the novices were kept at their books, till they could underſtand their ſervice and the ſcriptures. At ſeven years of age they ſung their firſt maſs, and from thence the houſe was no longer charged with finding them apparel; for then they entered into wages, to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with apparel, which was twenty ſhillings a-year each, and had no more to ſupply themſelves withal.— The eldeſt monk in the houſe had no more, except he had an office. His chamber was in the dorter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0782100202:254"/>Dr John Porter, alias Smith, ſacriſtan.</p>
                        <p>The ſacriſt's exchequer was within the church, in the north alley, oppoſite to biſhop Skirlaw's altar, on the left hand as you go up to the abbey of St Cuthbert's feretory.</p>
                        <p>His office was to provide bread and wine for the church, and wax and lights in winter. He had always a tun of wine lying in his exchequer, for the uſe of the church. He had alſo ſacriſtan-heugh in his keeping; it was his charge; and St Mary's cupboard was his office. He was alſo to ſee the glaſs windows repaired, and the plummer's work of the church done; and mending of bells and bell-ropes, and all other works neceſſary to be performed, both within and without the church, and to ſee the church kept clean.</p>
                        <p>His office was alſo to lock up every night the keys of every altar in the church, every altar having its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral almery, and ſome two, to lay the ſaid keys forth every morning between ſeven and eight o'clock, upon the top of the almery, which was of wainſcot, wherein they were locked, which ſtood within the north choir door, that every monk might take the key, and go to what altar he was diſpoſed to ſay maſs at.</p>
                        <p>They alſo went to the chapter-houſe every day between eight and nine o'clock, where all the biſhops in the old time were buried, and there prayed for all their benefactors, and thoſe who had beſtowed any thing upon this church. At nine o'clock a bell was rung to maſs, called the chapter maſs, which was always ſung at the high altar; and he that ſung the maſs had always in his memento, all thoſe who had given any thing to this church. One half of the monks ſaid maſs in the chapter maſs time, and the other half that ſung not the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter maſs, ſaid maſs in the high maſs time.</p>
                        <p>There were at every altar two chalices, and two ſilver crewets appertaining to it, both with albs and veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for principal feaſts; as alſo for all other days beſide. Every altar had its double furniture for adorning all parts of the altar, ſerving both for holidays and principal feaſts.</p>
                        <p>Their founders and benefactors were prayed for every day, and had in remembrance in the time of ſaying maſs.</p>
                        <p>The ſacriſtan's chamber was in the dorter, and he had his meat ſerved from the great kitchen to his exchequer.</p>
                        <p>Other officers of the church.</p>
                        <p>Dr Robert Bennet, bowcer of the houſe: He was the firſt prebendary in the eleventh ſtall. Anno 1542.</p>
                        <p>His exchequer was a little ſtone houſe joining upon the coal-garth pertaining to the great kitchen, a little diſtant from the dean's hall ſtairs.</p>
                        <p>Dr Roger Wright, cellerer of the houſe.</p>
                        <p>His exchequer was afterwards Dr Tod's chamber, joining to the weſt end of the great kitchen, having a pair of ſtairs going up to it, and was the firſt prebendary in the eleventh ſtall. Anno 1542.</p>
                        <p>Dr Roger Watſon, terrer of the houſe.</p>
                        <p>His exchequer was as you go into the gueſt-hall, on the left hand in the entry at going into the great hall.</p>
                        <p>Dr William Forſter, keeper of the garners.</p>
                        <p>The maſter of the garners exchequer was over Mr Pilkington's hall door, all whoſe houſe, and Mr Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's, were garners, where their wheat and other corn lay.</p>
                        <p>Theſe granaries are at preſent the houſes of the ſeventh and eighth prebendaries.</p>
                        <p>The kiln was where Mr Robert Bennet's lodging was, beyond the conduit. This lodging was built at his own expence. It is at this time the houſe of the eleventh prebendary.</p>
                        <p>Dr Thomas Spark, chamberlain, the firſt prebendary in the third ſtall. Anno 1542.</p>
                        <p>His exchequer was near the abbey-gates; now the manſion-houſe of the firſt prebendary.</p>
                        <p>The chamberlain's office was to provide ſtamyne, otherwiſe called linſey-woolſey, for ſheets and ſhirts for the novices and the monks, for they were not permitted to wear linen. He kept a taylor daily at work, in making ſocks of white woollen cloth, both whole and half ſocks; and making ſhirts and ſheets of linſey-woolſey, in a ſhop underneath the exchequer. This taylor was one of the ſervants of the houſe. The cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where he lay was in the dorter.</p>
                        <p>Dr Henry Brown, maſter of the common-houſe.</p>
                        <p>His office was to provide all ſuch ſpices againſt Lent as ſhould be comfortable to the monks, under their great auſterity, both of faſting and praying; and to have a fire conſtantly in the common-houſe hall, for the monks to warm themſelves at when they pleaſed; and to provide always a hogſhead of wine for the monks; and for keeping his O, called O Sapientia, and to provide ſigs and walnuts for Lent. His chamber was in the dorter.</p>
                        <p>Dr William Watſon, the prior's chaplain.</p>
                        <p>His exchequer was over the ſtairs in going up to the dean's hall. He was the firſt prebendary in the twelfth ſtall. Anno 1542.</p>
                        <p>His office was to receive at the bowcer's hands, all ſuch ſums of money as were payable by him to the lord prior's uſe for his maintenance, the expence of his whole houſhold, and his other neceſſaries. The ſaid chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0782100202:255"/>for his table to be ſweet and clean; and that every man executed his office diligently as he ought to do; and that no debate or ſtrife ſhould be within the houſe. He had in his cuſtody all the lord prior's plate and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as well for delivering it out, as receiving it again. He was alſo to diſcharge and pay all the gentlemen, yeomen, and all other the ſervants and officers of the lord prior's houſe their wages, and to diſcharge all other debts of the houſe whatſoever. His chamber was adjoining to the prior's chamber.</p>

                        <p>Upon St Mark's day.</p>
                        <p>St Mark's day was commonly kept a faſt through all the country, and no fleſh eaten upon it: The prior with the monks made a ſolemn proceſſion, and went to Bow church, doing very ſolemn ſervice there; and one of the monks made a ſermon to the pariſhioners and town's men who came thither.</p>
                        <p>The proceſſion on the three croſs days, by the prior and monks.</p>
                        <p>On Monday in croſs-week they had another ſolemn proceſſion, going to St Oſwald's church in Elvet, and there did a ſolemn ſervice: A ſermon was preached by one of the monks, before a numerous audience.— Tueſday, the day following, in another ſolemn proceſſion, they went to St Margaret's church, in Croſgate, with ſolemn ſervice, and a ſermon. On Wedneſday, the next day, they had the like proceſſion to St Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las' church, there doing divine ſervice very ſolemnly, and a ſermon was preached before a great audience.</p>
                        <p>The proceſſion on Holy-Thurſday, Whit-Sunday, and Trinity-Sunday, by the prior and the monks.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, being Holy-Thurſday, they had a general proceſſion, with two croſſes borne before them; one, both croſs and ſtaff, all of gold; the other of ſilver parcel-gilt, with that holy relique St Cuthbert's banner, being carried firſt in the proceſſion, with all the rich copes belonging to the church, every monk one. The prior had an exceedingly rich one of cloth of gold, which was ſo maſſy that he could not go upright with it, unleſs his gentlemen, who at other times bore up his train, ſupported it on every ſide whenever he had it on. He had his croſier ſtaff in his hand, which was of ſilver double guilt, and a rich mitre on his head: Alſo that holy relique St Bede's ſhrine, was carried in the proceſſion by four monks, upon their ſhoulders. And other monks carried about with them in the ſaid proceſſion, ſeveral holy reliques, as the picture of St Oſwald, of ſilver gilt, and St Margaret's croſs, of ſilver double gilt. The proceſſion came out at the north door of the abbey church and through the church-yard, and down Lidgate, by Bow church end, and up the South Bailey, and in at the abbey gates, where a great number of people ſtood, and ſo proceeded through the abbey garth, whither no woman was permitted to go; and ſo through the cloiſters into the church.</p>
                        <p>Upon Whit-Sunday was a general proceſſion, with the ſame ſolemnities as had been obſerved on Holy-Thurſday, with St Bede's ſhrine, St Cuthbert's banner, and all the holy reliques; as the image of St Oſwald, and the image of St Aidanus, and St Margaret's croſs, and divers others.</p>
                        <p>On Trinity-Sunday was another general proceſſion as aforeſaid, with all the above recited reliques, going the ſame circuit.</p>

Advancing towards the altar, where the ſtalls terminate, the pavement is elevated one ſtep, and on the right-hand is the biſhop's throne, erected by biſhop Hatfield, over the vault prepared for his own monument, and built in a ſtile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the proud idea he held of the dignity of his mitre.

                     <note n="*" place="bottom">The throne was repaired by Lord Crewe; and in 1772, was new painted and gilt by biſhop Egerton.</note>. The images are all removed. Below the throne are ſtalls for the prebendaries' ladies: On the oppoſite ſide of the choir, where biſhop Skirlaw's tomb was, are other ſtalls for the ladies of the biſhops, and dean's families and others; and cloſe adjoining is the pulpit, finely ornamented with inlaid figures in the Italian ſtile, repreſenting ſome of the apoſtles, the ground Swediſh oak; the figures are almoſt as large as life, ſo artfully ſhadowed as to appear like a delicate painting in bronze: The ſounding board is ſupported by one column. The opening into the ſide ailes to which you deſcend by five marble ſteps, is by a gate, and two ſide lights of open tracery work, in wood, finely executed and finiſhed above with tabernacle work. The choir com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends four pillars on each ſide, two of them cluſtered, and two round, the round ones cut in the ſpiral figure: The double gallery above the ſide ailes is formed of circular arches, each of the lower openings divided by a ſingle column. The roof was repaired, or rather new vaulted by prior Hotoun, who acceded in 1289; it is of elegant Gothic work, the ribs of the arches terminating in points ornamented with roſes, the fillets pierced in roſes and croſſes: Some of the decorations of the center roſes are ſingular; one next to the organ contains a human figure, with three round balls in an apron, not unuſual among the heathen emblematical effigies. From the altar rails eaſtward, the whole work appears nearly of the ſame date, and by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture of this part of the edifice, we are led to conclude that the building origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally terminated here, and was opened further eaſtward to form a connection with the eaſt tranſept: The columns which riſe at the altar rail, are little more than the plain facing of a common wall, ornamented with long ſmall round pilaſters, ſingle and belted in the middle, their capitals pierced, decorated with figures of animals, and finiſhed above with tabernacle work; the whole appearing like ornaments placed occaſionally there: The opening of the gallery in this part is different from the reſt of the church, conſiſting of three pointed arches, ſupported by columns whoſe capitals are richly pierced, and the fillets of the arches are pierced and highly decorated; there is alſo an interior pillar ſupporting a groined vaulting. Here the building appears to have been broken off and the eaſt wall removed. The vaulting of the roof is continued, and over the altar table finiſhes with a fine pointed arch, ſupported on cluſtered pillars, ranging with the ſide of the eaſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſept; the capitals and the fillets or mouldings of the arch are highly finiſhed with pierced work, and bear no degree of ſimilitude to any of the more weſtern parts of this edifice.

                                 <p>Into this ſumptuous new church was the laſt and great tranſlation of St Cuthbert, but before the day came, prior Turgot, with ſome of his brethren, determined to open his tombe with intent to ſhew his body to the people, if they found it entire: Att night, therefore, they mett at his ſepulchre, and reverently taking off the ſtone, they found a cheſt well fortified with nayles and leather, and in it another wrapt in cloth thrice double, in which they found the booke of the evangeliſts which had fallen into the ſea, a little ſilver altar, a goblet of pure gold, with an Onyx ſtone, and an ivory comb: Laſtly, opening the third cheſt, they found the body of the ſaint (which the grave in ſo many years had not digeſted) lying upon the right ſide to give room to the reſt of the reliques: For in the ſame coffyn were the bones of Venerable Beda, the head of St Oſwald, part of the bones of Aidanus, Eadfrid, and Ethelwold, biſhops of Lindisfarne: All which reliques they placed with due reverence in other parts of the church; and laying St Cuthbert on his back, they placed St Oſwald's head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his bands. At the day of his tranſlation, Ranulphus, the biſhop, publiſhed in his ſermon to the people, the incorruption of St Cuthbert's body, which, after four years was flexible, and now might plead preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the grave to be immortale. And thus in great ſolemnity they inſhrined him beneath the high altar in the preſence of the abbot of St Albans, the abbot of St Maries, in Yorke, the abbot of St Germans, prior Turgot, with thouſands of people ſpectators of the miracle.

                                    <p>Next to the nine altars was the monument of St Cuthbert, having the high altar on the weſt, in the midſt whereof his ſhrine was exalted with moſt curious workmanſhip, of fine green marble, gilt with gold; having four ſeats or places underneath the ſhrine, for pilgrims or lame men, ſitting on their knees to reſt on, in the time of their devout offerings. It was eſteemed one of the moſt ſumptuous monuments in all England, ſo great were the offerings and jewels beſtowed upon it.</p>
                                    <p>At the weſt end of this ſhrine was a little altar for maſs to be ſaid on, only upon the great and holy feaſt of St Cuthbert's day in Lent: At which ſolemnity the prior and the whole convent did keep open houſhold in the frater-houſe, and dined all together, and on no day elſe in the year: And at this feaſt, and certain other feſtival days, they were accuſtomed to draw up the cover of St Cuthbert's ſhrine, being of wainſcot, having ſix very fine ſounding ſilver bells faſtened to the rope; which, at the drawing up of the cover, made a goodly ſound; which ſaid cover on the outſide was very finely and artificially gilded. And on either ſide were painted four lively images; on the eaſt end the picture of our Saviour ſitting on the rainbow to give judgment; on the weſt end was the picture of our Lady, and Chriſt on her knee; and on the height of the cover from end to end was a fine brattiſhing of carved work, cut throughout with dragons, fowls, and beaſts; and the inſide of the cover was all varniſhed and coloured with a fine ſanguine colour; and at every corner of the cover there was a lock to lock it down.</p>
                                    <p>Alſo within the ſaid feretory, both on the north ſide and the ſouth, there were almeries of wainſcot, varniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, finely painted, and gilt over with little images, for the reliques of St Cuthbert to lie in; and within the almeries did lie all the holy reliques that were offered to St Cuthbert; and when his ſhrine was drawn, the almeries were opened, that every man might ſee the holy reliques therein, accounted the moſt ſumptuous
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0782100202:259"/>and richeſt jewels in all this land; for great were the gifts and godly devotion of kings, queens, and other eſtates, at that time, towards God and holy St Cuthbert in this church.</p>
                                    <p>Within this feretory were many little pictures of ſaints, of imagery work, all of alabaſter, ſet in the French Pierre in their ſeveral places, the pictures being curiouſly engraved and gilt; and the Nevil's croſs and bulls head ſet upon the height; and on either ſide of the two doors in the French Pierre, and alſo in divers other places of the French Pierre beſides; which feretory and French Pierre were made at the charges of John lord Nevil.</p>
                                    <p>At the eaſt end of St Cuthbert's feretory were wrought upon the height of the irons towards the nine altars, very fine candleſticks of iron, like unto ſockets, which had lights ſet in them before day, that every monk might have light to ſee to read their books at the ſaid nine altars, when they ſaid maſs; and alſo to give light to all others that came thither to divine ſervice.</p>
                                    <p>The king of Scots' ancient and his banner, with divers other noblemen's ancients, were all brought to St Cuthbert's feretory; and there the ſaid lord Nevil offered the jewels and banners; and there the ſaid banners and ancients ſtood and hung till the ſuppreſſion of the houſe. The lord Nevil's banner ſtaff was all wrythen about with iron, from the midſt upward, and ſtood on the north end of the feretory: And the king of Scots' banner hung over the midſt of the alley of the nine altars, under St Catharine's window, in the eaſt end of the church; and a little after the ſuppreſſion of the houſe, they were all taken down, ſpoiled and defaced, that the memory thereof ſhould be clean taken away, being both a great honour to the realm, and a decent ornament unto the church.</p>

                                    <p>The ſhrine of St Cuthbert was defaced at the viſitation held at Durham, for demoliſhing ſuch monuments, by Dr Lee, Dr Henley, and Mr Blithman, in king Henry the Eighth's reign, at his ſuppreſſion of religious houſes. They found many goodly and valuable jewels, eſpecially one precious ſtone, which was of value ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to redeem a prince. After the ſpoil of ornaments and jewels, they approached near to his body, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting nothing but duſt and aſhes; but perceiving the cheſt he lay in ſtrongly bound with iron, the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith with a ſmith's great fore-hammer broke it open, when they found him lying whole, uncorrupt, with his face bare, and his beard as of a fortnight's growth, and all the veſtments about him, as he was accuſtomed to ſay maſs, and his metwand of gold lying by him. When the goldſmith perceived he had broken one of his legs, in breaking open the cheſt, he was ſore troubled at it, and cried, Alas! I have broken one of his legs; which Dr Henley hearing, called to him, and bade him caſt down his bones: The other anſwered he could not get them aſunder, for the ſinews and the ſkin held them ſo that they would not ſeparate. Then Dr Lee ſtept up to ſee if it were ſo, and turning about, ſpake in Latin to Dr Henley, that he was intire, though Dr Henley not believing his words, called again to have his bones caſt down: Dr Lee anſwered, if you will not believe me, come up yourſelf, and ſee him: Then Dr Henley ſtept up to him, and handled him, and found he lay whole: Then he commanded them to take him down; and ſo it happened contrary to their expectation, that not only his body was whole and uncorrupted, but the veſtments wherein his body lay, and wherein he was accuſtomed to ſay maſs, were freſh, ſafe, and not conſumed. Whereupon the viſitors commanded him to be carried into the reveſtry, till the king's pleaſure concerning him was further known; and upon the receipt thereof, the prior and monks buried him in the ground under the place where his ſhrine was exalted.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0782100202:260"/>to have it drawn, or to ſee it, the clerk of the feretory (called George Bates) gave notice to his maſter, the vice-prior, keeper of the feretory, who brought the keys of the ſhrine, and gave them to the clerk to open it. His office then was to ſtand by and ſee it drawn up. It was always drawn up in mattins time, when Te Deum was ſinging, or in high maſs time, or at even-ſong time when Magnificat was ſung. George Bates was regiſter of the houſe.</p>
                                    <p>There was in the keeping of the vice-prior, a banner belonging to the ſhrine, called St Cuthbert's banner, the ſtaff five yards in length; all the pipes of it were of ſilver, to be ſlidden on along the banner ſtaff, and on the uppermoſt pipe; on the top of it was a little ſilver croſs, and a goodly banner cloth pertaining to it, and in the midſt of the banner cloth was a white velvet half a yard ſquare, and a croſs of crimſon velvet over it; and within the ſaid white velvet was that holy relique, the corporax cloth, wherewith the holy man St Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert covered the chalice when he ſaid maſs; and the reſt of the banner cloth was of crimſon velvet, embroid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with gold and green ſilk moſt ſumptuouſly. The ſaid banner was at the winning of Brankenfield battle, in king Henry the Eighth's time, and brought home with it the king of Scots' banner, and many noblemen's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients of Scotland; which were ſet up in St Cuthbert's feretory, where they remained till the ſuppreſſion of the houſe; at which time St Cuthbert's banner, and theſe ancients of Scotland were defaced. St Cuthbert's ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was thought to be one of the moſt magnificent reliques of any in England, and was not carried out but on principal days, in general proceſſions, as Eaſter day, Aſcenſion day, Whitſunday, Corpus Chriſti day, and St Cuthbert's day, and ſome other feſtival days. It was very maſſy, and ſet up at the eaſt end of the ſhrine. Whenever it was carried in proceſſion, it was the clerk's office to attend it, with his ſurplice on, with a fine red painted ſtaff, having a fork or cleft at the upper end thereof; which cleft was lined with ſoft ſilk, having down under the ſilk, to prevent hurting or bruiſing the pipes of the banner, which were of ſilver, or in taking it down and raiſing it up again, by reaſon of its great weight. There were always four men to go along with it, beſides the clerk, and the man who carried it.</p>
                                    <p>There was alſo a ſtrong girdle of white leather, that he who bore St Cuthbert's banner, did wear whenever it was carried abroad. The banner was made faſt to it with two pieces of white leather, and at each end of the two pieces, a ſocket of horn was faſtened, to put the end of the banner ſtaff into. Davies, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>Betwixt the two laſt altars lieth buried Anthony Beke, biſhop of Durham, and patriarch of Jeruſalem, in a fair marble tomb, underneath a large marble ſtone, being the firſt biſhop that ever attempted to lie ſo near the ſacred ſhrine of St Cuthbert, the wall being broken at the end of the alley, for bringing him in with his coffin <note n="§" place="bottom">His remains were lately diſturbed, his ſcull and ſeveral bones were perfect; his coſſin was a vaſt oak cheſt, bound with iron: Nothing valuable was diſcovered. The coſſin had been a covered with cloth; the impreſſion of the threads remained on the iron and wood.</note>.</p>
                        <p>All the altars had their ſeveral ſkreens and covers of wainſcot; having likewiſe between every altar a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of wainſcot, varniſhed over with branches and flowers, and other imagery work, finely gilded; contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeveral lockers and ambryes for keeping the veſtments and ornaments belonging to every altar; with three or four little ambryes in the wall.</p>
                        <p>There is in the eaſt end of the church, a round window, called St Catharine's window, the breadth of the choir, all of ſtone, very curiouſly wrought and glazed; having in it twenty-four lights; the picture of St Catharine is on the right ſide, as ſhe was ſet upon the wheel to be tormented.</p>
                        <p>And in the window there was a frame of iron, whereon ſtood nine creſſets of earthen metal filled with tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which every night were lighted, to give light to the nine altars, and St Cuthbert's feretory, and burned till day-break.</p>
                        <p>In the ſouth end there is a great window, which hath in it the whole hiſtory, life and miracles of that holy man St Cuthbert, and curiouſly ſet forth in fine coloured glaſs.</p>
                        <p>Alſo in the north end there is another great glaſs window, called Joſeph's window, having in it all the whole ſtory of Joſeph, in fine coloured glaſs.</p>

                                    <p>In the midſt was the altar of St Cuthbert and St Bede, above which was a fine long window, with ſtone work partitions: In the firſt light was St Cuthbert, with king Oſwald's head in one hand, and his croſier ſtaff in the other, in his habit as he uſed to ſay maſs, viz. his albe and red veſtment. In the ſecond light was St, Bede in a blue habit; under their feet were the pictures of two biſhops, with croſier ſtaves in their hands, kneeling, in their epiſcopal attire, with mitres on their heads, one under St Cuthbert, and the other under St Bedu. In the lower lights were the birth of St Cuthbert; and the picture of St Oſwald blowing his horn, and St Cuthbert appearing to St Oſwald: And biſhop Langley's arms in fine coloured glaſs, and four turret win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows containing our bleſſed Lady with the lilly before her, and the ſalutation.</p>
                                    <p>The altar of St Oſwald and St Lawrence, having above it a window of the ſhape of the laſt, having the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of St Oſwald, with a ſceptre in his hand, a golden crown on his head, and a croſs and ball in his left-hand; under him biſhop Langley in his pontifical habit, and above him written, O ſancta mater Dei ora pro me: And under him, Orate pro Thomas Langley, epiſcopo Dunelm. There was alſo the picture of St Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and his gridmon, with the arms and eſcutcheon of biſhop Langley under him, viz. a crown of gold above his helmet, and within the crown, the creſt, a buſh of oſtrich feathers, in red and green painted glaſs.</p>
                                    <p>

In the croſs diviſion are four little lights, bearing four ſtars or mullets. At the top, were four turret windows, with our Saviour Chriſt, our bleſſed Lady, and other figures.</p>
                                    <p>The altar of St Thomas of Canterbury and St Catherine, above which was a window with the like lights, containing the martyrdom of St Thomas in one light: And the ſtory of St Catherine's being brought before the king and tortured on the wheel, with two angels ſeparating the wheels; and after that her commitment to priſon, and then looking out at a grate, and the beheading her afterwards in the king's preſence; with certain arms and eſcutcheons, in the four turret windows, under the midſt of the ſaid window, divided, and the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of four biſhops, in four little turret windows, and the picture of our bleſſed Lady above all, in a blue habit.</p>
                                    <p>The altar of St John the Baptiſt and St Margaret. The window above had St John the Baptiſt on the one ſide, with the lamb and croſs in his hand, with theſe words, Ecce Agnus Dei. Under him a monk, called Thomas Batterby, in a blue habit, and theſe words, Adjuva me divine magiſter Sancte Cuthberte. Alſo his baptizing of Chriſt in Jordan; his being brought before Herod; and after that beheaded. Then follows St Margaret overcoming the dragon, with theſe words, Sancta Margareta; then being brought before the king, ſhe was condemned, and by his command was hanged by the hair of the head, and drawn up by a windlaſs, and put into a tun of oil, which the fire would not conſume, and ſo ſhe was beheaded. And above all are four turret windows, containing the picture of our bleſſed Lady, and others finely coloured.</p>
                                    <p>The fourth altar was ſurmounted by its window. In the firſt light was St Andrew with a croſs over his body, and above his head, Sanctus Andreas. On the other ſide St Mary Magdalen, and under her Sancta Maria Magdalena; and the ſtory of her kneeling at her prayers, and being brought before the king, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to die; with ſome part of the ſtory of Chriſt's anointing and viſiting the ſick. In the four turret win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows are the pictures of the four doctors of the church; St Auguſtine, St Hierome, St Ambroſe, and St Gregory, in fine glaſs.</p>
                                    <p>The altar of St Martin and St Edmund. In the window above, of the ſame architecture, was St Martin in a black habit, with a mitre on his head, and a ſtaff in his hand, with a croſs on the top thereof; above him theſe words, Sanctus Martinus archiepiſcopus. In the ſame window were eſcutcheons charged with coats of arms; and the picture of a wicked ſpirit, in the likeneſs of a woman, who had got into the chamber and bed of St Edmund, intending to tempt the holy man to fornication; but ſhe was ſo abhorred, that he with a rod did beat her out of his bed. Alſo the picture of St Edmund in a red epiſcopal attire, with a croſs, having a ſtaff under it, in his hand, and theſe words over him, Sanctus Edmundus epiſcopus. Above in the turret windows, was biſhop Skirlaw's picture, and an angel finely painted on each ſide. On the other ſide, under St Edmund, were the arms of doctors and noblemen, on the breaſts of four angels in four turret windows.</p>
                                    <p>The altar of St Peter and St Paul, having the like window and lights, containing the picture of St Peter, with croſs keys in his hand, and underneath, Sanctus Petrus: Here was the miracle of Peter's walking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt upon the ſea. Under the middle ſtone work were the pictures of four eſcutcheons charged with arms. Then was repreſented St Paul perſecuting the church at Damaſcus, and his being ſtruck with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the manner of his becoming an apoſtle, having written on his breaſt. Paule, Paule, quid tu me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequeris? And afterwards his being brought before Caeſar, and his being beheaded. And above were four little turret windows with four fine pictures, viz. St Cedda, St Cuthbert, St Aidane, and another biſhop un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known: And above all the picture of God.</p>
                                    <p>The altar of St Aidane and St Helena, with the like windows and lights, preſenting the picture of St Aidane in his epiſcopal attire, with a croſier in his hand; whoſe ſoul after his death was repreſented to be carried to Heaven in a ſheet by two angels. In this were ſome part of the hiſtory of Chriſt, and the picture of a king and other ſaints; as alſo the picture of St Helena in a blue habit; and the picture of our Lady and the angel Gabriel appearing to her, and the Holy Ghoſt overſhadowing her, with the lilly ſpringing out of the lilly pot; and underneath the middle ſtone work were four angels. Above were four turret windows, with apoſtles, and the picture of God above all, in another little window, with Chriſt in his arms.</p>
                                    <p>The altar of the archangel St Michael. Its window contained the pictures of eight ſeveral orders of angels, in eight ſeveral diſtinct pictures, viz. one angel, and under him written, Cherubins, Seraphims. A ſecond, and under him, Arch-angeli. A third, and under him, Angeli. A fourth, and under him, Principatus. A fifth, and under him, Dominationes. A ſixth, and under him, Poteſtates. And above all, in four turret windows, the pictures of four archangels winged, with wheels under their feet, and their names written on their wings. Above all, in one little tower window, the picture of God.—Davies, &amp;c.</p>
                                    <p>Mr Pennant ſays, <q>Beyond this, at the extreme eaſt end ſtood nine altars, dedicated to as many ſaints; above each is a moſt elegant window, extremely narrow, lofty and ſharply arched: Above theſe is a round window, very large, and finely radiated with ſtone work, called St Catharine's wheel, from the form of the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0782100202:268"/>wheel uſed at her martyrdom. In this part of the church is another fine window, divided into circular portions. All the windows in this iſle terminate ſharply; and were the work of a later age than that of the body of the church; probably the time of prior Foſſour.</q> Page 333.</p>
                                    <p>It is to be obſerved that the fine paintings in theſe windows are almoſt totally defaced, or ſo mutilated and confuſed by bunglers who have repaired them, that the hiſtories are not now to be made out, except the ſtory of St Catherine.</p>

                     </note>, the deſcent into which is by ſeveral ſteps: It is one hundred and thirty feet in length, and in width from the ſcreen of the high altar fifty-one feet, making the whole length of the church four hundred and eleven feet. St Cuthbert's feretory projects twenty-ſeven feet into the tranſept, and is elevated
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0782100202:266"/>
about eight feet above the pavement. This tranſept is lighted by one large window
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0782100202:267"/>
at each end, under pointed arches, with much tracery, in the glaſs of one of which
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0782100202:268"/>
was depicted the hiſtory of St Cuthbert, and in the other the hiſtory of Joſeph, both now totally defaced: To the eaſt it is lighted by a double range of windows, the lower tier conſiſting of nine long windows; in the center of the upper tier is a large circular window, called St Catherine's window, having three long windows on each ſide, the arches of which are all pointed. By the engraving given from Mr Nicholſon's drawing and admeaſurement of the whole eaſt end of the church, the reader will diſtinguiſh the ſimilarity of ſtile in this tranſept and the tower; and, we hope, will be convinced that the obſervation as to their date is not ill grounded: On the projections of this front are two effigies, in the printed deſcriptions of the church ſaid to repreſent biſhop William on the ſouth, who began the preſent edifice; and on the north biſhop Flambard, who tranſlated St Cuthbert's body to the ſhrine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him therein; the firſt attired in his mitre and epiſcopal inſignia, the other having his head uncovered: But it is more probable they are the effigies of biſhop Farnham<note n="*" place="bottom">Ob. 1257.</note>, and his contemporary prior Thomas of Melſonby, for biſhop Anthony Beke, who died in 1310, was interred near the altar of St Michael, and the wall was broken through to admit his remains; which is a proof this part of the edifice and its altars were then made. We will conclude theſe obſervations by ſaying, it is preſumed this moſt elegant part of the edifice was finiſhed by prior Richard de Hotoun, who, it is certain, roofed the choir, and acceded to the priory in 1289. The pilaſters of this tranſept, from whence riſe the groins of the roof, are of an angular projection, light and elegant: On each ſide of the great window the pilaſters conſiſt of a cluſter of ſmall circular columns, one of larger dimenſion in front, and ſix on each ſide to form the projecting angle, belted in two places at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, with a triple roll, the capitals pierced in flowers; the pilaſters between each window are compoſed of a front column, and four on each ſide, in an angler pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, belted and capitalled as the larger ones; every other column is of black marble, the intermediate ones of white free ſtone, which had a beautiful effect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were, from the miſtaken zeal of reformation, daubed over and concealed as they now remain, with waſhing and oker. Under each tier of windows a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery runs the whole length of the tranſept: The nine altars were placed one under each window to the eaſt, the wall ornamented with ſhort pilaſters and open niches in the roſe figure, exactly ſimilar to the gallery of the dome: The vaulted roof is ribbed, the ribs meet on three circles; the ſilletings of the ribs are pierced like thoſe of the choir, with roſes and croſſes: The circles are beautifully ornamented, the moſt northern one being pierced with a rich garland of flowers; that in the center is ſculptured with four figures finely relieved, repreſenting the evangeliſts
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0782100202:269"/>
kneeling, with their proper emblems: The ſouthern circle is of elegant ſculpture, exhibiting the revelation of Chriſt's nativity.</p>
                  <p>The gallilee at the weſt end of the church, as was obſerved before, was by ancient authors ſaid to be appropriated by biſhop Pudſey, for the reception of women, being originally deſigned for the ſervice of proceſſions: It is in breadth from eaſt to weſt fifty feet, and from north to ſouth eighty feet; divided into five ailes, by four rows of pillars, running eaſt and weſt; three pillars and two pilaſters, in each range; the pillars formed of four ſmall round columns placed together, whoſe baſe is only two feet ſquare; the pilaſters conſiſt of two round columns, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from the walls, their capitals ornamented with a leaf and mouldings; the arches are circular, and cut underneath and on the ſides with the zig-zag figure; the roof is not vaulted <note n="*" place="bottom">A plate in Smith's Life of Bede.</note>: It is lighted with three large windows to the weſt, with flat or elliptic arches, and one ſmaller window at each extremity under pointed arches; to the ſouth, four windows with pointed arches; the north ſide is built up, and uſed for the regiſter's office: The old entrance was from the north, by a ſmall yard adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the church-yard, ſo that the women need not come within the gates of the church: The door circular, with pilaſters and mouldings, greatly decayed. The gallilee on the ſouth ſide is now ſtalled and benched for the biſhop's conſiſtory court<note n="†" place="bottom">

                        <p>For the comfort of all women and ſolace of their ſoul, there was an ancient church in the Fern Iſland, where the church of that town now ſtandeth; which was appointed for women to repair unto for hearing of maſs, and receiving the ſacraments. For which purpoſe here was a chapel dedicated to the bleſſed virgin Mary, now called the gallilee.</p>
                        <p>Hugh, biſhop of Durham, conſidering the diligence of his predeceſſors in building the cathedral church, finiſhed but a few years before his time, and no chapel being then erected to the bleſſed Virgin, whereunto it ſhould be lawful for women to have acceſs, began to erect a new work at the eaſt angle of the cathedral, for which ſeveral pillars of marble were brought from beyond ſea; and the work being advanced to a ſmall height, begun, through great clifts therein, to fall down; whence it manifeſtly appeared unacceptable to God and holy St Cuthbert. Whereupon that work was left off, and a new one begun and ſoon finiſhed, at the weſt end of the church for women</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0782100202:271"/>It is called the gallilee, by reaſon, as ſome think, of the tranſlation thereof; being once begun, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards removed; to which place whoſoever reſorted, had the benefit of ſundry pardons, as appears by a table there ſet up, containing a catalogue thereof.</p>
                        <p>Within the gallilee, in a chantry made of blue marble, ſtood our Lady's altar, a ſumptuous monument, finely adorned with curious wainſcot work; the wainſcot furniſhed with pictures, in colours and gilding; there maſs was ſung daily by the maſter of the ſong-ſchool, with certain deacons and choriſters, the maſters playing upon a fine organ in time of maſs; wherein the founder, biſhop Langley, was moſt devoutly prayed for: This biſhop magnificently rebuilt the ſaid gallilee. There belonged to this altar very ſumptuous furniture, not only for principal feaſts, but for ordinary ſervice: And for ſafe-keeping thoſe veſtments, and other ornaments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſaid altar, there was at both ends behind the portal two cloſe almeries of wainſcot.</p>
                        <p>Thomas Langley, biſhop of Durham, lies buried under a marble tomb, within the ſaid chantry, before our Lady's altar.</p>
                        <p>On the north ſide of the gallilee was an altar, called the Lady of Pittie's altar, with her picture, carrying our Saviour on her knee, as he was taken from the croſs. This altar was intended for a chantry prieſt to ſay maſs at every day, having above the altar on the wall, a part of our Saviour's paſſion in large pictures, the other part being above St Bede's altar, on the ſouth ſide.</p>
                        <p>There was on the ſouth ſide, between two pillars, a beautiful monument of blue marble, a yard high, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by five pillars, one at every corner, and the fifth under the middle; and above the ſaid marble ſtone and pillars ſtood a ſecond ſhrine, to St Cuthbert's, wherein the bones of St Bede were inſhrined: It uſed to be taken down every feſtival day, when there was any ſolemn proceſſion, and carried by four monks in time of proceſſion and divine ſervice. It is not improper to tranſcribe the following verſes from the ancient hiſtory.</p>
                        <p>Hugh, biſhop of Durham, having finiſhed the chapel called the gallilee, cauſed a feretory of gold and ſilver to be made, wherein were depoſited the bones of Venerable Bede. In the lower part of the work, the following Latin verſes were engraven:
<q>
                              <l>Continet haec Theca Bedae venerablis oſſa,</l>
                              <l>Senſum factori Chriſtus dedit atque datori:</l>

                              <l>Sic in utroque ſuum, veneratus utrumque Patronum.</l>
                              <l>Anno Milleno ter Centum, ſeptuageno</l>
                              <l>Poſtquam Salvator carnem de Virgine ſumpſit</l>
                              <l>Tranſtulit hoc Feretrum Cuthberti de prope tumba,</l>
                              <l>Iſtius Eccleſiae Prior hic, poſcente Richardo</l>

                        </p>
                        <p>It appears that the bones of St Bede were firſt laid in the monaſtery of Jarrow, and afterwards brought to Durham, and placed in a golden coffin on the right ſide of the body of St Cuthbert.</p>
                        <p>Egfridus, a prieſt in that time, viz. 1319, did affirm, that one coffin contained both the body of St Cuthbert, and the bones of the venerable Dr Bede.</p>
                        <p>On the ſouth ſide of the gallilee was St Bede's altar, before which his bones and reliques lay, where his ſhrine was, to whoſe memory an elegant epitaph fairly written on vellum hangs upon the adjoining wall.—See p. 259.</p>
                        <p>The reverend Sir George Wheler, knight, one of the prebendaries of this cathedral, a true admirer of Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Bede, had ſeveral of his children buried near him, and ordered his own body to be interred as near Bede's tomb as it conveniently could, without violating the ſacred aſhes.</p>
                        <p>Adjoining to the bottom of the great window, in the weſt end of the gallilee, was a fine iron pulpit, with iron rails to ſupport the monks in going up, of whom one did preach every holiday and Sunday, at one o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
                        <p>At the weſt end of the ſouth angle was a font for baptizing children, when the kingdom was interdicted by the pope; which Thomas Langley, biſhop of Durham, procured as a privilege, upon ſpecial favour at the pope's hands.</p>
                        <p>In the weſt end of the gallilee are four finely coloured windows.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt towards the ſouth are three lights; the middle having in it the picture of Chriſt crucified, curiouſly painted, with the ſun and moon above the head thereof; in the higheſt part of which light is the picture of the ſtar that appeared to the three wiſe men; together with the picture of the virgin Mary, with Chriſt naked, ſitting upon her knee.</p>
                        <p>In the light towards the north, is pictured in coloured glaſs, the Almighty, having in his hand a ball or globe: And under that the Salutation; and the picture of the Holy Ghoſt appearing in the likeneſs of a dove.</p>
                        <p>In the light towards the ſouth is the picture of our bleſſed Lady, as ſhe was taken up into Heaven, glorified and crowned; and underneath a lively picture of our bleſſed Lady, with Chriſt new born, naked, ſitting on her knee, and ſucking her breaſt.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond, containing ſix fine lights of glaſs, ſevered, three above and three below.</p>
                        <p>The middle light above contains the picture of St Cuthbert, in his ordinary epiſcopal veſtments, the image of St Oſwald's head painted on his breaſt, ſupported with his right-hand, in fine coloured glaſs. Under his
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0782100202:272"/>feet is written, Sanctus Cuthbertus quondam Lindisfarnenſis epiſcopus, hujus eccleſiae &amp; patriae maximus patronus.</p>
                        <p>The light on the north ſide of St Cuthbert has the picture of St Bede, in his blue habit; under his feet is wrote, Sanctus Beda, qui vitam St Cuthberti, &amp; multa alia, ab eccleſia approbata conſcripſit; cujus oſſa, in hac capella in feretro contenta.</p>
                        <p>The light on the ſouth ſide of St Cuthbert hath the picture of Aidanus the biſhop, in fine coloured glaſs, as he was accuſtomed to ſay maſs; Under his feet is written, Sanctus Aidanus epiſcopus Lindisfarnenſis eccleſiae primus; primus in hac ſanctiſſima Dunelmenſi eccleſia, fuit prioratus.</p>
                        <p>Under which three lights, by partitions, are three very curious and larger pictures, in fine coloured glaſs, containing the images of Aidanus, Edmundus, and Eata, three biſhops of Lindisfarne, as they were accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſay maſs. Under Eata's picture is Sanctus Eata Lindisfarnenſis epiſcopus.</p>
                        <p>And above, in the higheſt part of this window, are ſix little glazed lights, in tower manner, in fine coloured glaſs, containing part of the hiſtory of Chriſt's nativity, the marriage in Galilee, and his miracles done upon earth.</p>
                        <p>In the third window are alſo ſix lights parted as before; in the higheſt part are three pictures, in fine colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed glaſs; the middle being the image of the bleſſed virgin Mary, with Chriſt in her arms, under whoſe feet is written, Sancta Maria.</p>
                        <p>On the north ſide of her is the picture of St Oſwald, king, in coloured glaſs, with a beautiful croſs in his hand; under whoſe feet is, Sanctus Oſwaldus fundator ſedis epiſcopalis Lindisfarnenſis, quae nunc eſt Dunel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſis: Cujus anima in feretro St Cuthberti eſt humata.</p>
                        <p>On the ſouth ſide of her is the picture of holy king Henry, in fine coloured glaſs, with his ſceptre in his hand; under whoſe feet is written, Rex Henricus.</p>
                        <p>Under thoſe, in three large lights, and firſt oppoſite to St Mary is placed the picture of Thomas Langley, biſhop, as he uſed to ſay maſs, having his arms excellently blazoned above his head; under whom is written, Thomas Langley, rector eccleſiae, ad honorem Dei, epiſcopus Dunelmenſis; &amp; duas cantarias in eadem fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit &amp; dotavit.</p>
                        <p>And under St Oſwald's, is the picture of biſhop Wilfridus, in fine coloured glaſs, as he uſed to ſay maſs; under whoſe feet is, Sanctus Wilfridus primo Lindisfarnenſis monachus, poſt abbas Ripenſis, ultimo archiepiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus Eboracenſis; uno anno rexit epiſcopatum Lindisfarnenſem.</p>
                        <p>And under king Henry is the picture of biſhop Cedda, in fine coloured glaſs, as accuſtomed to ſay maſs; under his feet, Sanctus Cedda, primo Lindisfarnenſis monachus, poſt abbas in Leſtingham, tribus annis rexit archiepiſcopatum Eboracenſem, &amp; etiam rexit epiſcopatum Lichfeldenſem.</p>
                        <p>In this window, above the former, are ſix little glazed tower windows, repreſenting the flight of Joſeph and Mary with our Saviour into Egypt, being purſued by Herod, together with moſt part of the ſtory thereof.</p>
                        <p>In the fourth window alſo there are ſix fine lights, ſevered as before, containing in the higher part three large pictures in three lights, being the images of three holy kings, great benefactors to the church, and to St Cuthbert, viz. Alured, Guthred, and Elfrid, in their royal apparel, with ſcepters in their hands, in fine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured glaſs.</p>
                        <p>Under them are, in large pictures, in fine coloured glaſs, three biſhops of Lindisfarne, as they uſed to ſay maſs: Under their feet is to be ſeen, Sanctus Egfridus Lindisfarnenſis. Sanctus Ethelwoldus Lindisfarnenſis.</p>
                        <p>Under the third, no writing to be ſeen, but Epiſcopus.</p>
                        <p>In the higheſt part of this window are ſix little tower windows, finely coloured and glazed, containing the moſt part of the ſtory of Chriſt's death, burial, reſurrection, and aſcenſion, moſt excellently pictured in fine coloured glaſs.</p>
                        <p>St Bede's ſhrine defaced.</p>
                        <p>The ſhrine of holy St Bede, before mentioned in the gallilee, was defaced by the viſitors, and his bones were interred under the ſame place, where before his body was exalted.</p>
                        <p>There were two ſtones that belonged to St Bede's ſhrine in the gallilee, of blue marble, which after it was defaced, were brought into the body of the church, and now lie oppoſite to the eaſt moſt tomb of the Nevils, joined together.</p>
                        <p>Many were the rich jewels and reliques appertaining to this church. King Richard gave his parliament robe of blue velvet, wrought with great lions of pure gold, an exceedingly rich cope. There was another cope of cloth of gold given to the church, by another prince.</p>

                     </note>. From the mode of architecture obſerved in this place, together with
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0782100202:274"/>
the circumſtance of the arms above the entrances, we are led to conjecture that the gallilee in the preſent form is to be attributed to cardinal Langley, in the beginning of the fifteenth century, who, as was before obſerved, expended in reparations and additional works therein, 499l. 6s. 7d. The form of the pillars, and the center windows, with the various fragments of ornaments which appear in the outward wall to the weſt, ſtrengthen the ſuppoſition that the preſent edifice was the cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's. Bede died at Jarrow monaſtery in 734; was tranſlated to this church by biſhop Pudſey; and in 1340, found his final reſting place under the care of Richard de Barnardcaſtle in the gallilee, who was interred near the remains <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>While his remains reſted at Jarrow, great reſort was made to his grave, and particularly one Elfrid, a prieſt of Durham, in the beginning of the eleventh century, came yearly upon the day of his death, and ſpent it in watching and prayer at his tomb; and ſuch veneration he entertained for his remains, that he ſtole away his bones, and carried them to Durham. Being aſked by his friends where they lay, he replied; "No one knows but myſelf;" and after being further preſſed by them, he gave this anſwer, <q>Believe me, beloved brethren, and be aſſured, the ſame cheſt that contains the moſt holy body of St Cuthbert, our father, holds alſo that of the venerable doctor and monk Bede.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>In 1054, when St Cuthbert was removed, the bones of Bede were found in the ſame cheſt; and afterwards they were encloſed in a ſeparate cheſt. In 1154, they were again removed into the ſhrine made by biſhop Pudſey, of pure gold and ſilver-ſmith work, enriched with jewels. Speed ſpeaks of this tomb.</p>
                     </note>: The like veneration induced cardinal Langley to repair and embelliſh this edifice, as he choſe to have his body depoſited near the ſaint: The cardinal alſo founded a chantry in the gallilee, to the honour of the bleſſed Virgin, and "glorious confeſſor St Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert <note n="†" place="bottom">

                                    <head>The weſt alley of the cloiſters.</head>
                                    <p>In the weſt alley of the cloiſters, a little to the ſouth of the dormitory door, was a ſtrong houſe, called the treaſury, having a ſtrong door, and two locks upon it. In the midſt of the houſe was a ſtrong grate of iron fixed in the ground-work, and in the roof, and faſtened in each wall the breadth of the houſe, ſo faſt as not to be eaſily broken. In the midſt of the grate was an iron door, with a ſtrong lock, and two great ſlots of iron to guard it; and within the grate was a ſquare table covered with green cloth, for telling their money. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this treaſury were alſo kept the evidences of the houſe, and the chapter ſeal; as alſo the evidences of ſeveral gentlemen's lands in the country, who thought them ſafer than in their own cuſtody, in three great cheſts well locked in the ſaid treaſury, but afterwards it was altered; their treaſure and money being kept in a ſtrong houſe over the eaſt gates of the abbey in the South Bailey, now called the exchequer; but in the ſaid old treaſury the common chapter ſeal is ſtill kept.</p>
                                    <p>Over-againſt the ſaid treaſury-houſe door was a ſtall of wainſcot, where the novices were taught; no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or other perſons being permitted to moleſt the novices, or the monks in their carrels, while at ſtudy in the cloiſters; a porter attending for that purpoſe at the cloiſter door.</p>
                                    <p>A little ſouth of the treaſury was the ſong-ſchool, for the inſtruction of boys, for the uſe of the choir; the ſong-ſchool in the ſouth iſle of the lanthern being decently furniſhed with a reading deſk, convenient ſeats, and all other requiſites, where prayer was daily celebrated at ſix in the morning, except on Sundays and holidays.</p>

                                    <head>The dormitory.</head>
                                    <p>On the weſt ſide of the cloiſters was a large houſe, called the dorter, where the monks and novices lay. Every monk had a little chamber to himſelf. Each chamber had a window towards the chapter, and the partition betwixt every chamber was cloſe wainſcotted, and in each window was a deſk to ſupport their books. On the weſt ſide of the ſaid dorter were the like chambers, with their windows and deſks towards the infirmary and the water; the chambers being all well boarded.</p>
                                    <p>The novices had likewiſe their chambers in the ſouth end of the ſaid dorter, adjoining to the aforeſaid chambers, having eight chambers on each ſide. Every novice had his chamber to himſelf, not having any light but what came in at the foreſide of their chambers.</p>
                                    <p>At each end of the dorter was a ſquare ſtone, wherein was a dozen of creſſets wrought in each ſtone, being always filled and ſupplied by the cooks, as they needed, to afford light to the monks and novices, at their ariſing to their mattins at midnight, and for their other neceſſary uſes.</p>
                                    <p>There was a decent place adjoining to the weſt ſide of the ſaid dorter, towards the water, called the privies. Two great pillars of ſtone ſupported the whole floor thereof; and every ſeat and partition was wainſcotted cloſe on every ſide.</p>
                                    <p>In the dorter every night a private ſearch was made by the ſub-prior, who called at every monk's chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door, to ſee good order kept, and that none ſhould be wanting. The middle part of it was paved with fine tile ſtones the whole length: The ſub-prior's chamber was the firſt, as he was to ſee order kept.</p>
                                    <p>The ſub-prior always dined and ſupped with the convent, ſitting at the upper end of the table; and ſupper being ended, which was always at five o'clock, upon ringing a bell to call one of the novices to ſay grace, they went to the chapter-houſe to meet the prior, there to remain in prayer and devotion till ſix o'clock. Then upon ringing a bell again they went to the <hi>ſalvi,</hi> and all the doors of the cells, the frater-houſe, the dorter, and the cloiſters, were locked, even at ſix o'clock, and the keys delivered to the ſub-prior, till ſeven o'clock the next morning.</p>

                                    <head>The Loft.</head>
                                    <p>There was a door in the weſt end of the frater-houſe, at which the old monks entered, and then aſcended up a pair of ſtairs, having an iron rail into a loft which was at the weſt end of the frater-houſe, above the cellar, where the convent and monks dined and ſupped together. The ſub-prior ſat at the upper end of the table, as chief; and they had their meat ſerved from the great kitchen, in at the dreſſer-window, and brought through the frater-houſe: The ſaid kitchen ſerved both the prior and the whole convent, having two windows into the frater-houſe; the one was large for principal days, the other not ſo large for every day. At the foot of the ſtairs was another door, leading into the great cellar or buttery, where all the drink ſtood that ſerved the whole convent.</p>
                                    <p>This loft, ſince the diſſolution of the monaſtry, was made the dining-room of the fifth prebendary's houſe.</p>
                                    <p>The monks were accuſtomed every day after dinner, to go through the cloiſters, in at the uſher's door, and ſo through the entry under the prior's lodgings into the centry-garth, where the monks were buried, where they all ſtood bareheaded a good ſpace, praying among the tombs for the ſouls of their brethren who were buried there: And when they had done their prayers, they returned to the cloiſter, and ſtaid till three o'clock, that they went to even-ſong.</p>
                                    <p>The monks were the only writers of the acts and deeds of the biſhops and priors of the church, and of other chronicles and hiſtories: They likewiſe recorded other moſt valuable things, as what acts, what occurrences, and what miracles were performed every year. Such were the labours of monks and religious men in ancient times.</p>

                                    <p>On the right hand at going out of the cloiſters into the infirmary, was the common-houſe. It was to have a fire conſtantly by day in winter, for the uſe of the monks, who were allowed no other fire; but the maſter and officers of the houſe had their own ſeveral fires. A garden and bowling alley belonged to the ſaid houſe, towards the water, for the novices to recreate themſelves, leave being firſt granted; their maſter attending to ſee to their good order. In this houſe once in the year, between Martinmas and Chriſtmas, the maſter of it kept his <hi>O Sapientia,</hi> a ſolemn banquet, at which the prior and convent were entertained with figs, raiſins, ale, and cakes, but not to exceſs, being only a moderate ſcholaſtical congratulation among themſelves.</p>

But if any of the temporal men belonging to the houſe offended in the premiſſes, they were puniſhed by the temporal law.</p>

                                    <p>A famous houſe of hoſpitality was kept within the abbey-garth, called the gueſt-hall and was ſituate on the weſt ſide towards the water. The <hi>terrer</hi> of the houſe was maſter thereof, appointed to give entertainment to all eſtates, noble, gentle, or what other degree ſoever came thither as ſtrangers. Their entertainment was not inferior to that of any place in England, both for the goodneſs of their diet, the clean and neat furniture of their lodgings, and all things neceſſary for travellers; and no man was required to depart while he continued honeſt, and of good behaviour.</p>
                                    <p>The houſes belonging to the ſecond, third, fourth and tenth prebendaries, were erected out of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and other offices belonging to the gueſt-hall, the hall itſelf being wholly demoliſhed, nothing remaining except a part of the weſtern wall: But nothing remains to let us know what was in the ſixth and twelfth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendaries houſes.</p>
                                    <p>This hall was a ſtately place, not unlike the body of the church, ſupported on each ſide by very fine pillars, and in the midſt of the hall a large range for the fire. The chambers and lodgings belonging to it were kept very clean, and richly furniſhed. They were very pleaſant to lie in eſpecially one chamber, called the king's chamber, well deſerving that name; ſuch was the ſtatelineſs thereof.</p>
                                    <p>The victuals the gueſts were entertained with came from the great kitchen of the prior, the bread and beer from his pantry and cellars. If they were honourable, they were ſerved as honourably as the prior himſelf, otherwiſe according to their quality.</p>
                                    <p>The <hi>terrer</hi> had certain men appointed to wait at his table, and to attend upon his gueſts and ſtrangers; and for their better entertainment he had always a hogſhead or two of wines kept in a cellar pertaining to the ſaid hall</p>
                                    <p>The prior (whoſe hoſpitality was ſuch as that, in reality there was no need of the gueſt-hall, but that the convent was deſirous to abound in all liberal and free almſgivings) kept a moſt ſplendid and noble houſe being attended by the beſt gentlemen and yeomen in the country, and the magnificent ſervice of his houſe deſerved no leſs; conſtant relief and alms were daily given, not only to the poor of the city, but to thoſe of the country round about.</p>
                                    <p>

                                    <p>There were certain poor children, called the children of the almery, who were educated in learning, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved with the alms and benevolence of the whole houſe, having their meat and drink in a loft on the north ſide of the abbey gates, before the ſuppreſſion of the ſaid houſe. This loft had a long ſlated porch over the ſtair-head, and at each ſide of the ſaid porch were ſtairs to go up to the loft, with a ſtable underneath it, and a door into it, under the ſtair-head, to go into the ſaid ſtable. This edifice, at the ſuppreſſion of the houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Mr Stephen Marley's lodging. Soon after the ſuppreſſion he altered it, and took down the porch and ſtairs that went up to the loft, and made a kitchen where the ſtable was, and his buttery above where the loft was. The children went to ſchool at the infirmary ſchool without the abbey gates. The laſt ſchoolmaſter was Sir Robert Hartburne, who continued maſter till the ſuppreſſion of the houſe. He was bound to ſay maſs twice a week at Magdalen's chapel, near Kepier, and once a week at Kimbleſworth. The meat and drink theſe children had, was what the monks and novices with their maſter had left It was carried in at a door adjoining the great kitchen window, into a little vault at the weſt end of the frater-houſe, like a pantry, called the covie.

                                    <p>The monk, ſeized with ſickneſs, was conveyed, with all his furniture, &amp;c. from his chamber in the dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, to another in the infirmary, in order to have both fire and more convenient attendance; no fire being allowed in the dormitory.</p>
                                    <p>And when his attendants perceived that he could not live, they ſent for the prior's chaplain, who ſtaid with him till he yielded up the ghoſt: Then the barber was ſent for, whoſe office it was to put down the cloths and uncover him, and to put on his feet-ſocks and boots, and to wind him in his cowl and habit. Thence he was carried to a chamber called the dead man's chamber, in the infirmary, there to remain till night. At night he was removed into St Andrew's chapel, adjoining to the ſaid chamber and infirmary, there to remain till eight o'clock in the morning, the chapel being a place ordained only for ſolemn devotion. The night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the funeral two monks were appointed by the prior to be mourners, and to ſit all night on their knees at the feet of the corpſe; and the children of the almery ſitting on their knees, in the ſtalls on each ſide, were to read David's pſalms till eight in the morning, when the corpſe was carried to the chapter-houſe, where the prior and the whole convent met it, and there ſaid their dirge; none being permitted to approach the chapter-houſe during the time of their prayers for his ſoul: When ended, the corpſe was carried by the monks from the chapter-houſe through the parlour, the place where merchants uſed to utter their wares, ſtanding betwixt the chapter-houſe and church-door, and ſo through the ſaid parlour into the centry-garth, where he was buried and a chalice of wax laid upon his breaſt, having his blue bed held over his grave by four monks, during the funeral: Which bed is due to the barber for his duty aforeſaid, and making his grave. At the time of his burial only one peal was rung.</p>
                                    <p>The priors of the houſe of Durham, were accuſtomed in ancient time, to be buried in their boots, and wound in their cowls by the barber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the monks uſed to be buried.</p>

                                    <p>The cuſtom of burying biſhops in the chapter-houſe.</p>
                                    <p>The biſhops of Durham, when they died, were brought to the abbey church to be interred; and the prior and monks met the corpſe at the church-yard gates on the place-green, where they received and carried him through the church into the chapter-houſe: Great ſolemnity and devotion, according to the ancient cuſtom was uſed. The cuſtom was, to bury them with their albe, ſtole, phannel, and other veſtments wherein they uſed to ſay maſs, a mitre on the head, and a croſier ſtaff in his hand, and ſo laid in the coffin, with a little chalice of ſilver, other metal, or wax, placed on the breaſt; which wax chalice, and the knobs, and the edge of the patten or cover, and the baſe were gilded.</p>
                                    <p>The prior and monks had the horſes, chariot, and all other things that came with the deceaſed, due to them by ancient cuſtom.</p>
                                    <p>But afterwards the biſhops were buried in the church; as their predeceſſors were in the chapter-houſe.</p>
                                    <p>At the eaſt end of the chapter-houſe there is a yard, called the centry-garth, where all the priors and monks were buried. In this garth was a vault made to be a charnel-houſe, to put dead men's bones in.</p>
                                    <p>There were many gentlemen of great worth buried in the centry-garth, who deſired to lie near holy St Cuthbert; and among others Mr Racket, who had a fine tomb of white marble, whereon he was pictured in braſs, in his coat of armour, and his ſword girt about him; and at every corner of the marble was an evangeliſt in braſs.</p>
                                    <p>Mr Elmeden was buried in the ſaid garth, with a fine tomb-ſtone upon him: And divers others, whoſe monuments are periſhed.</p>
                                    <p>The priors buried in the centry-garth had each a tomb-ſtone, either of marble or free ſtone, which dean Whittingham cauſed to be pulled down and taken away; and broke and defaced all ſuch ſtones as had any pictures of braſs, or other imagery work, or chalices wrought upon them; and the reſt he took away, and employed them in making a waſhing-houſe.</p>
                                    <p>Within the church were two marble holy water ſtones, boſſed with hollow boſſes on the outſides, curiouſly wrought. Theſe were taken away by dean Whittingham, and removed into his kitchen.</p>
                                    <p>In the centry-garth under the ſouth end of the nine altars, betwixt two pillars, was a ſong-ſchool, erected for teaching ſix children to ſing, who had their meat and drink among the children of the almery, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the houſe. The maſter had his chamber adjoining to the ſong-ſchool, and his diet in the prior's-hall, among the prior's gentlemen.—Davies, &amp;c.</p>
                                    <p>William, biſhop of Durham, before he took down Aldwinus's old fabrick, prepared a beautiful tomb of ſtone in the cloiſter-garth, a yard above the ground, where St Cuthbert was depoſited, over which was laid a large marble. But when his body was tranſlated to the ſeretory, made a large and curious marble image, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting St Cuthbert, with beautiful gilding and painting, in the form he was wont to ſay maſs, which was placed upon the tomb-ſtone as ſoon as his body was inſhrined in the new church, and round the ſame were ſet up wooden ſtanchels, ſo cloſe that a man could only look through it, to view that exquiſite picture. It was covered above with lead, not unlike a chapel. This elegant monument ſtood oppoſite to the parlour door, now turned into a ſtore-houſe, having rooms above where the regiſter-office is kept. Soon after the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, dean Horne demoliſhed this fine monument, converting the lead to his own uſe; the image of St Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert he left perfect. But when dean Whittingham began to govern, he cauſed this image to be defaced and broken.</p>

Theſe two were at the charge of the building and workmanſhip, and cauſed to be painted on the glaſs in the windows, from the cloiſter door to the church door, the whole ſtory and miracles of St Cuthbert. In king Edward the Sixth's days, this hiſtory was taken down by dean Horne, and broken to pieces.</p>

Eighteen aged poor men were appointed to come to the cloiſter that day, having their feet firſt clean waſhed, there to remain till the prior and the convent came, which was about nine o'clock. They ſat between the parlour door and the church door, on a long form, and the prior waſhed the poor men's feet, one after another, and dried them with a towel, and kiſſed them. When he had done this, he beſtowed thirty pence in money, on each of them, and ſeven red herrings a-piece; and ſerved them with drink, three loaves of bread, and certain wafer cakes.</p>
                                    <p>At going out of the cloiſters, through an entry into the deanry, at the top of the ſtairs, behind the door called the uſher-door, on the right-hand, was another going into the regiſter, wherein certain old written books of the records and evidences of the houſe were laid; as alſo a copy of the foundation of Greatham hoſpital, which was alſo regiſtered in the ſaid book of records.

eaſt walk was the old library, now converted into offices for the regiſter, a council chamber, and other conveniencies for the chapter's buſineſs: In this walk is the chapter-houſe, in length ſeventy-five feet, and thirty-five in breadth, a neat build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the form of a theatre, vaulted with ſtone, without any pillars; the ſide walls are ornamented with pilaſters and interſecting arches, like the church: It is lighted by five windows at the ſemicircular end to the eaſt, two ſide lights, and one to the weſt: The groins of the vault ſpring from corbles ſupported by human figures, in the manner Atlas is uſually repreſented; the mouldings of the ribs are cut with the zig-zag figure: three rows of ſtone benches, one above another, run round the building: To the eaſtward of the center is a ſtone chair, with much carved work, the biſhop's ſeat in old times when he viſited, and wherein the prelates are inſtalled. Adjoining to the chapter-houſe, on the ſouth, was a priſon for offending monks; and at the ſouth end of the cloiſter there is a paſſage into the cemetery garth. The building of the chapter-houſe was originally the work of biſhop Rufus, about the year 1136, but it was afterwards vaulted and embelliſhed by ſucceeding prelates, particularly by biſhop Skirlaw, to whom much of the preſent edifice is aſcribed. In this place were interred at the eaſt end, biſhop Rob<hi rend="sup">t</hi> de Inſula, and biſhop Kellow; further to the weſt, biſhops Rufus, William de Sancta Barbara, and biſhop Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard; near to thoſe biſhop Pudſey, and Philip of Poictiers; weſtward of thoſe, biſhops Richard de Mariſco, Aldune, Walcher, Turgot the prior, and biſhop Stichill; and on each ſide of the entrance, biſhops Walter de Kirkham, and Richard de Farnham: Robert de Grayſtanes was alſo interred here. Davies and the old roll place ſome other biſhops in the chapter-houſe, but are the only authorities we find. The monks were buried in the cemetery-garth, and there ſtood that venerable monument Ethelwold's ſtone croſs, which was removed from

                  </note>. We would not have multiplied theſe proofs, but to deduce from thence the following obſervations: It has been apprehended that the mintage of our prelates was carried on in ſome ſtrong place within the gates of the caſtle; or as others would have it, in Silver-ſtreet, from its name; whereas the records prove the mint-maſter's houſe was on the Place-Green; which was ſtiled to be in the caſtle, as being within the ballium and fortifications thereof.</p>
               <p>There were anciently belonging to the monaſtery two ſchools, one in the cloiſter where the novices were taught, in a wainſcotted hall oppoſite to the treaſury door. The maſter was one of the oldeſt and moſt learned of the monks, and the ſtudents were ſupplied, upon his report, with neceſſaries from the chamberlain of the houſe; for they had no appointed ſalary. If any of them ſhewed a particular genius and love of literature, he was ſent to Oxford; thoſe of meaner capacities purſued their
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0782100202:287"/>
ſtudies under the diſcipline of the houſe, were taught to perform the ſervice of the choir, and in the end admitted to ſing maſs; at which ſtage they had twenty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a year as wages: They had commons at a table at the eaſt end of the frater-houſe, and during the meſs one of them read a portion of the holy ſcriptures. Their lodging was at the ſouth end of the dormitory. The other ſchool was in the infirmary out of the abbey gates, where the boys of the almery were taught; they meſſed after the novices, and had the remains of their table: Their maſter had ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical duty, ſaying maſs twice a week at St Mary Magdalen's chapel, near Kepier, once a week at Kimbleſworth, and every holiday and Friday in the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary chapel, where four women conſtantly attended, who dwelt in the infirmary, to take care of the ſick, and were ſupplied with proviſions from the priors table<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide auditor's office.</note>. Theſe appointments, with the reſt of the monaſtic diſpoſitions, were extinguiſhed by the diſſolution, and perhaps occaſioned the inſtitution of the other ſchools after the ſettlement of the chapter. John Newton, maſter of St Edmond's hoſpital, in Gateſhead, and John Thoralby, rector of Gateſhead, and afterwards of Whitburn, clerks, by biſhop Langley's licence, dated the 14th of June, 1414, founded two chanteries at the altars of the bleſſed Virgin and St Cuthbert, in the gallilee, and appointed two chaplains, one of whom was to teach poor boys grammar, and the other ſinging, in ſuch place as that prelate or his executors ſhould appoint: Their ſtipend of forty ſhillings yearly each, iſſued out of lands in Hardwick, nigh Norton, Ryton, Boldon, Caſſop, and Owengate, in the North-Bailey. The boys, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, from the inſtrument of confirmation by the prior and convent were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of thirty of the monaſtery almery: The ſong-maſter, with ſome of his ſcholars, were to come to church on the principal feſtivals in a ſurplice, and ſing; the others to be preſent on the like occaſions; and no women were to be permitted among them: The chantry clerks were not ſuffered to lie a night out of their houſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out licence of the biſhop, or his ſpiritual chancellor, under the penalty of forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chantry; neither might they, (with any licence) be abſent above forty days <hi>conjunctim aut diviſim</hi> in a whole year, and then to have a ſubſtitute. They could not be admitted without licence of the biſhop, or during the vacancy of the prior and chapter, in which expreſs mention was to be made of their taking the oath of reſidence. The biſhop had power to add to or detract from the articles of founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to appoint ſtatutes, or alter and explain them at pleaſure <note n="†" place="bottom">3d Chartulary, p. 284, 285, 286, 287.</note>.</p>
               <p>There appears ſome confuſion touching theſe chantries; whether only one was founded by Newton and Thoralby, and the other was the act of biſhop Langley; for in the nomination of ſome of the clerks, one of them is called biſhop Langley's chantry. Biſhop Nevil, in the firſt year of his epiſcopacy, granted licence to the executors of biſhop Langley, to purchaſe lands of forty pounds per annum value, for maintenance of theſe chantry clerks <note n="‡" place="bottom">Vide Rot. Cl. Nevil.</note>. Mr Thomas Rud, who was maſter of the chapter ſchool in the church-yard, had much occaſion to look into thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and was of opinion, that Newton and Thoralby were in fact the original

After the diſſolution, it is to be apprehended, things of this nature remained ſome time in confuſion; two new ſchools were inſtituted in the ſecond year of queen Mary, under the protection of the dean and chapter; and the queen appointed ſtipends to be paid thereto, out of the revenues of the church: And though it doth not appear the dean and chapter had any right to intermeddle with the money iſſuing out of Kaverdley, in Lancaſhire, yet certain it is, a cuſtom aroſe in the beginning of queen Elizabeth's reign, to pay one half of the ſtipend that belonged to one of biſhop Langley's ſchools, to the maſter of the new grammar-ſchool, and the ſame hath been regularly paid by the king's auditor. One reaſon for this diviſion might be, that from the time of the foundation of the new ſchool, where the Latin tongue was to be taught, that language was diſuſed in the other, and it was appropriated for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh rudiments and writing. Biſhop Langley's ſong-ſchool hath long fallen into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe; the patentee pays no attention to the inſtitution, and it has become a beneficial ſinecure to ſome of the biſhop's domeſtics<note n="‡" place="bottom">

                  <head>The Biſhop's Alms-Houſe, and Schools on the Green.</head>
                  <p>Biſhop Coſin's deed of foundation of the alms-houſes on the Place-Green, and re-eſtabliſhment of the ſchools there, is to the following effect:</p>
                  <p>"John, by God's grace and permiſſion, biſhop of Durham: To all the faithful ſons of Chriſt and holy mother church, that may ſee or hear theſe preſent letters, or this public inſtrument, health and bleſſing. For as much, as among other works of piety and exerciſes of Chriſtian religion, which appertain to the office of a biſhop, we were diligently to provide and take care, that our epiſcopal caſtles, and in them eſpecially our chapels, and ſome other places and buildings adjoining, deſtined for public uſes, (all which indeed we found almoſt quite deſtroyed either by the violence of the times, or the neglect and malice of men) might be duly repaired as ſoon as poſſible, and where neceſſary rebuilt. Know ye, therefore, that we have not only repaired, and brought into better form, in every part, our foreſaid epiſcopal caſtles, and the ſacred chapels therein, at our own proper charges, but alſo have built anew two ſchool-houſes, anciently erected by the appointment of the moſt reverend prelate and lord, lord Thomas Langley, our predeceſſor, on the biſhop's palace-green, in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0782100202:290"/>
Durham, on the eaſt ſide of the ſaid green; (lately almoſt fallen and left waſte by the violence of the times and neglect of men) the one of which ſchools was deſigned for inſtructing boys in the rudiments of learning, unto the Latin and Greek gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar; and the other to inſtruct boys in the art of writing and plain ſongs; with a ſtipend of 8l. 6s. 8d. annexed, for the maſter of each ſchool, to be paid yearly by the king's officers; and with a penſion in like manner of forty ſhillings, to be paid by the officers of us and our ſucceſſors, viz. our auditor and receiver, yearly to the ſame maſter; which we have thought good, as much as in us lies, ſhould be ratified and confirmed. Know ye, furthermore, that we the biſhop aforeſaid, have built and placed between the ſame ſchools, another building or alms-houſe, containing in it eight chambers for the entertainment and dwelling of ſo many poor people, viz. four men and four women. And now for the due maintenance and ſupport of the ſame poor men and women, and the repairs of the houſes aforeſaid, when ſuch ſhall be needful, we make known unto all, that by this our charter, we give and grant an annuity of ſeventy pounds, to iſſue out of the manor or lands of Great-Chilton, in the county of Durham, lately bought with our own proper monies, to be diſtributed among the ſame poor men and women, and duly to be paid yearly, at four quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the year, according to an indenture made between us on the one part, and the honourable Charles lord Gerard, baron of Brandon, together with Sir Henage Finch, knight and baronet, the king's ſolicitor, Sir Gilbert Gerard, knight and baronet, our high-ſheriff in the county palatine of Durham, Sir Nicholas Cole, of Kepier, in the county of Durham, knight and baronet, and George Davenport, clerk, rector of Houghton-le-Spring, in the county of Durham aforeſaid, our truſtees on the other part; and bearing date the 12th day of Auguſt preſent, as it may appear more fully by the ſaid indenture. Therefore we will and ordain by this our charter, that the aforeſaid ſum of ſeventy pounds, for the maintenance and ſupport of eight poor people, living in our hoſpital or alms-houſe aforeſaid, and for the repairs thereof, be diſtributed and paid yearly in this manner as followeth. Firſt of all, ſhall be paid to each of the eight poor people aforeſaid, by the biſhop's auditor and receiver, the yearly penſion of 6l. 13s. 4d. at four feaſts of the year, ſpecified in the aforeſaid indenture, by equal portions: Secondly, that to each of the ſaid poor people be given yearly, by the ſaid auditor and receiver, at the feaſt of St Bartholomew, 15s. for buying coals or fuel, and repairing their chamber windows, as oft as need ſhall require: Thirdly, that the ſum of 5l. every year be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the hands of the ſaid auditor and receiver of the biſhop of Durham for the time being, for buying gowns (called liveries) for the ſaid poor men and women,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0782100202:291"/>
every third year: Fourthly, that the ſum of 20s. in like manner be placed in the hands of the ſaid auditor and receiver, for repairing the ſaid houſes when it may be needful: Fifthly, that the ſum of 4l. in like manner, be paid duly at the feaſts aforeſaid, by equal portions, unto ſome honeſt woman, to be named by us and our ſucceſſors, biſhops of Durham, that may daily attend upon the aforeſaid poor people, in their ſickneſs and other neceſſity: Laſtly, that the aforeſaid auditor and receiver reſerve in their hands yearly 13s. 4d. to purchaſe gloves, as a token for their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and care. Furthermore, we will and ordain, that all ſuch poor people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bachelors or widowers and widows, be of honeſt repute and good converſation, and ſixty, or at leaſt fifty years of age; whereof three men and ſo many women ſhall be natives, or at leaſt inhabitants of Durham, by the ſpace of twenty years: But the other two, that is, one man and one woman, ſhall be choſen out of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage or pariſh of Brancepeth: The cure of which church we anciently had; to be nominated by us during our life, but after our death by our beloved daughters the lady Mary Gerard, the lady Elizabeth Burton, Mrs Frances Gerard, alias Blakeſton, and Mrs Anne Greenvile, in their turns after the order of their ages, and by the longer livers and longer liver of them: And after the death of them all, by our ſucceſſors, the biſhops of Durham in a full See; but by the dean and chapter of our cathedral church of Durham, in a vacancy, from time to time as often as any place of the ſaid poor men and women ſhall happen to be void, for ever. And that this pious and charitable intention of ours may take better effect, we have choſen, named, aſſigned, and conſtituted, and by theſe preſents for us and our ſucceſſors, do chooſe, name, aſſign, and conſtitute our beloved in Chriſt, William Unthanke, William Widdrington, Robert Blunt, and Charles Calvert, and our beloved Grace Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Jane Cummin, Eleanor Pearſon, and Mary Atkinſon, to be the firſt poor men and women of the ſame hoſpital or alms-houſe, there to remain to be maintained and relieved during their natural lives; unleſs in the meanwhile they be removed, or that it ſhall happen that any one of them be removed thence for ſome reaſonable cauſe, by us and our ſucceſſors. We will alſo, and ordain, that all ſuch poor people, and their ſucceſſors, ſhall reſide and lodge in their own chambers. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, we appoint that the poor men and women ſhall duely ſay not only the private prayers aſſigned to them, by us, in their own chambers; but alſo frequent the prayers morning and evening, in the choir of our cathedral church in Durham, unleſs they be detained at home by ſome real ſickneſs: That they all go to church, two by two, both men and women, in their gowns, modeſtly, decently, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: That they ſhall ſit next after the king's beadſmen, ſounded in the ſame cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral church; and there demean themſelves humbly and devoutly. Laſtly, we will and conſtitute, that all ſuch poor people be ſubject as well to the ordinary juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of us and our ſucceſſors, as to all decrees, commands, and ſtatutes, duely and lawfully to be eſtabliſhed and ordained by us and our ſucceſſors, biſhops of Durham. And we do hereby declare, as well the ſaid ſchools, reſtored and built by us, as alſo our new and peculiar foundation of the ſaid alms-houſe, ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever. We put up our moſt humble thanks to the Omnipotent and Gracious Divinity, who hath vouchſafed to grant unto us, whilſt we ſojourn in this

                                    <head>THE COUNTY COURT.</head>
                                    <p>The ſheriff is judge of the county court, and all proceedings there are before him; and yet the office of county clerk hath, time out of mind, been granted by the biſhop by patent for life, and ſuch patentee iſſues all proceſſes, and all pleadings are in his office, and he receives to his own uſe all the profits thereof. And where the debts and damages are above 13s. 4d. the proceſs is capias I obſerve in ſome reaſons offered againſt taking away the county palatine, it is mentioned, that in 1665, there was ſome attempt to diſcourage the practice of arreſting by capias; and that the grand jury made a repreſentation in writing to the judges at the aſſizes, of the great conveniencies ariſing to the county by it, and that the ſame was alſo ſigned by the mayor and aldermen, and the attornies, and publicly read at the aſſizes; and that the ſaid cuſtom of iſſuing capias was approved and allowed by the judges. And in 1666, at the aſſizes of Durham, one <hi>Potter</hi> being in gaol upon a capias, iſſued out of the county court, moved by Mr Stot, for a habeas corpus to bring the defendant to the bar; and the ſheriff in his return ſet forth the cuſtom of arreſting by capias, and the defendant was brought to the bar, and the matter argued by councel; the councel for the defendant at the bar agreed the cuſtom was good and the defendant was remanded. There was alſo a writ of falſe judgment brought by <hi>Dale</hi> at ſuit of <hi>Hall,</hi> and the awarding of a capias was aſſigned for error. Sir T. Turſden, upon hearing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel on both ſides, took time to conſider of the error, and afterwards declared, he had conſulted with his brethren, the judges, at Weſtminſter, who were of opinion, that the cuſtom being in the county palatine by preſcription might be good, and gave orders for affirming the judgment. In the year 1668, three writs of falſe judgment were brought by <hi>Nicholſon</hi> againſt <hi>Huntley,</hi> and the awarding the capias again aſſigned for error; after argument before baron Rainsford, he was attended again at Newcaſtle, and appointed the ſame to be further argued at his chambers in Serjeant's Inn, when he ſaid he had conſulted his brethren, who were of opinion the cuſtom was good, and affirmed the judgment; and ordered Mr Cooke, the aſſociate, to draw a ſpecial rule, and ſet out the cuſtom, which was done.</p>
                                    <p>In the auditor's office is the petition, called a repreſentation of the grand jury, dated the 20th of April, 1664.</p>

                                    <p>The office or place of county clerk hath, time out of mind, been diſappendant as to the high ſheriff's office, who has never received any profit of the ſaid court, though he hath always exerciſed and enjoyed the office of judge of and within that court; and that all pleadings within that court have been held before the ſheriff, and not otherwiſe. The ſaid court hath, time out of mind, had the lawful and unqueſtioned juriſdiction, in all caſes therein to award a capias upon a juſticies, directed to the ſheriff, and no other perſon whatever, which is done at a ſmall charge. Carthew, 207. Comb. 260.</p>
                                    <p>The court commonly called the county court, in fact is a court holden before the ſheriff of the county, and ſo it is ſtiled in writs of falſe judgment; which diſtinguiſhes this court from all other county courts properly ſo called, and of which the ſuitors are judges, and they are ſaid to be holden <hi>coram ſectatoribus.</hi> See I.

                  <p>Before we proceed in the deſcription of the preſent edifice, it is neceſſary to make ſome few obſervations on the form and conſtruction of fortreſſes of the like date.

Towers of an octagonal form, we conceive, were not uncommon with the Normans; yet we do not apprehend the preſent tower was of Norman architecture: The lofty mount moſt probably attracted the founder's attention: But we have met with very little evidence to ſupport ſuch a poſition.

                     <q>The materials of which caſtles were built, varied, according to the places of their erection; but the manner of their conſtruction ſeems to have been pretty uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. The outſides of the walls were generally built with the ſtones neareſt at hand, laid as regularly as their ſhapes would admit; the inſides were filled with the like materials, mixed with a great quantity of fluid mortar, which was called by the workmen grout-work: A very ancient method of building uſed by the Romans, and quoted by Palladio, and all the writers on architecture. The angles were always coigned, and the arches turned with ſquared ſtone, brought from Caen, in Normandy, with which the whole outſide was now and then eaſed. Sometimes inſtead of ſtone the inſides of the walls were formed with ſquared chalk, as is the caſtle of Guildford. When the Normans found the ruins of an ancient building on the ſcite of their intended ſtructure, they either endeavoured to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate it into their work, or made uſe of the materials; as may be ſeen by many buildings of known Norman conſtruction, wherein are fragments of Saxon archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, or large quantities of Roman bricks, which has cauſed them often to be miſtaken for Roman or Saxon edifices. The general ſhape or plan of theſe caſtles depended entirely on the caprice of the architects, or the form of the ground intended to be occupied; neither do they ſeem to have confined themſelves to any particular figure in their towers, ſquare, round, and poligonal, oftentimes occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the original parts of the ſame building. The ſituations commonly choſen were ſteep rocks, cliffs, eminences, or the banks of rivers.</q> To this obſervation we muſt add, that the fortifications on the ground now under conſideration, occupied or encloſed the whole ſummit of the hill; the outward wall running along the very brink of the eminence, and forming an oval figure; at the northern extremity of which the caſtle ſtands, on the neck of land, where the ground deſcends ſwiftly to the lower town, called the borough; the river runs almoſt round the whole walled or fortified eminence, except at that part where Claypath or Cluerport gate ſtands; at which point, the eaſtern or weſtern channels drawing neareſt together, give the walled or fortified part of the town the figure of a horſe ſhoe, ſo that the river to thoſe fortifications ſerved in lieu of a moat: The natural aſcent from the river to the foot of ſome parts of the city wall, is upwards of eighty perpendicular feet. <q>In towns (Mr Groſe ſays, p. 9) the appellation of <hi>ballium</hi> was given to any work fenced with paliſades, and ſome times maſonry, covering the ſuburbs; but in caſtles
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0782100202:295"/>
was the ſpace immediately within the outer wall. When there was a double enceinte of walls, the areas next each wall were ſtiled the outer and inner ballia. The manner in which theſe are mentioned in the ſiege of Bedford caſtle, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently juſtify this poſition: <hi>The caſtle was taken by four aſſaults; in the firſt was taken the barbican, in the ſecond the outer ballia, at the third attack the wall by the old tower was thrown down by the miners, where, with great danger they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed themſelves of the inner ballia, through a chink; at the fourth aſſault the miners ſet fire to the tower, ſo that the ſmoke burſt out, and the tower itſelf was cloven to that degree, as to ſhew viſibly ſome broad chinks, whereupon the enemy ſurrendered.</hi>— This receives further confirmation from the enumeration of the lands belonging to Colcheſter caſtle, wherein are ſpecified "the upper bailey, in which the caſtle ſtands, and the nether bailey, &amp;c." The wall of the ballium in caſtles was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly high, flanked with towers, and had a parapet, embattled, crenellated, or garretted for the mounting of it. There were flights of ſteps at convenient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances; and the parapet often had the merlons pierced with long chinks, ending in round holes, called oillets.</q> Whether, at Durham, there was an inner and outer ballium, is uncertain; the two ſtreets now called the Baileys, are ſometimes diſtinguiſhed by the names of the high and low Bailey, and north and ſouth Bailey, and prompt an idea, that ſuch might be the original form of the fortification; but when the preſent cathedral church was built, the diſtinction and interior wall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was removed, as no remains thereof now appear.</p>
                  <p>Within the ballium were lodgings or barracks, for thoſe whoſe ſervice it was to defend the caſtle perſonally, either as principals or ſubſtitutes; ſo in the Baileys the houſes were anciently held in capite by the ſervice of caſtle ward, and many chief perſonages had tenements therein for greater ſecurity in times of public danger <note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </note>: Beſides the cathedral church and monaſtery, there were included in the ballium, two pariſh churches, St Mary the Great or Le-Bow, and St Mary the Leſs.— <q>The entrance into the ballium was commonly through a ſtrong machicolated and embattled gate, between two towers, ſecured by a herſe or portcullis; over this gate were rooms originally intended for the porter of the caſtle: The towers ſerved for the corps de garde. On an eminence, in the center commonly, though not always, ſtood the keep or dungeon, ſometimes, as in the ſiege of Bedford caſtle, emphatically called the tower; it was the citadel or laſt retreat of the garriſon, often ſurrounded by a ditch, with a draw bridge and machicolated gate, and occaſionally with an outer wall, garniſhed with ſmall towers: In large caſtles it was generally a high ſquare tower, of four or five ſtories, having turrets

at each angle; in theſe turrets were the ſtaircaſes, and frequently as in Dover and Rocheſter caſtles, a well. If inſtead of a ſquare, the keep or dungeon happened to be round, it was called a juliet, from a vulgar opinion that large round towers were built by Julius Caeſar<note n="*" place="bottom">Groſe's Antiq. vol. i. 2d edition, p. 11.</note>.</q> We find mention made of five gates to the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium: The great north gate, which flanked the keep to the eaſt, and filled up the ſpace between it and the wall, which led down into the borough: This was of the greateſt ſtrength, as it commanded the moſt important and leaſt guarded approach: When it was rebuilt by biſhop Langley, he thought it neceſſary to make it as ſtrong as the art of fortification could then render it, not only as a defence to the fortreſs and monaſtery, but as a priſon for criminals and captives, without lodging them in the cells and vaults of the great tower; to thoſe ends he conſtructed the gateway <note n="†" place="bottom">

Henry Egerton, one of the preſent prebendaries of Durham, having purchaſed the adjacent grounds, widened the ſtreet, and promoted the building of a ſpacious arch, of Roman architecture, without gates, in the place of the old gateway: This would have proved little more than an ornament to the city, had not the dean and chapter, with a munificence which diſtinguiſhes that worſhipful body in all their public works, laid it open for the uſe of gentlemen's families; whoſe carriages only are permitted to paſs along the elegant new bridge, lately erected by them: A bounty reſerved to this age.</p>
                  <p>At this gate the ancient wall of the ballium appears, ſtretching along the brink of the hill towards the church of St Mary-le-Bow, where King's-gate anciently ſtood.

When Framwellgate bridge was built by biſhop Flambard, in the opening of the twelfth century, he carried on a ſtrong wall between the caſtle and the church; and it is probable he built the laſt mentioned towers to command the paſs: The bridge had alſo a ſtrong gateway and tower: Building this bridge neceſſarily occaſioned a paſſage to be made from thence into the borough; and on that account, biſhop Flambard ſtrengthened that ſide of the caſtle, between the bridge and the north gate before ſpoken of, with a moat; which, from the example before given, was undoubtedly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with round towers or baſtions. <q>The method of attack and defence of fortified places practiſed by our anceſtors before, and even ſome time after the invention of gunpowder, was much after the manner of the Romans; moſt of the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines being made uſe of, though ſome of them under different names: They had their engines for throwing ſtones and darts of different weights and ſizes: For ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the walls they had moveable towers <note n="‡" place="bottom">Groſe's Antiq. vol. i. 2d ed. p. 14 and 17.</note>.</q> So that the more lofty the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, conſequently it was more difficult of aſſault by the machines uſed in ſieges. "Of the vaſt force" of the engines, <q>ſurpriſing ſtories are related; no wall, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thick, was able to reſiſt their ſtroke; and in the field they ſwept away the deepeſt files of armed men; with them were thrown not only large milſtones, but ſometimes the carcaſes of dead horſes, and even living men <note n="§" place="bottom">
                           <q>The former, according to Froiſſart, was practiſed by John duke of Normandy, ſon of king Philip de Valois, when he beſieged the count of Hainhault, in Thyn-Levêque, in the Low Countries, and whom he thereby obliged to capitulate, on account of the infection cauſed in the town; and, as Camden ſays, it was alſo done by the Turks in Negroponte. The other, namely throwing a living man, is alſo mentioned by Froiſſart. It happened at the ſiege of Auberoche, in Gaſcoigne, where the Engliſh being cloſely preſſed by the count de Laiſle, lieutenant-general to Philip de Valois, they ſent out an eſquire with a letter, which he was to endeavour to deliver to the earl of Derby, their general, but being taken, his letter was read, and afterwards tied round his ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Many of the keeps or dungeons, in the ancient caſtles, are placed in the ſame ſituation of the ballium, as the caſtle of Durham, as Conniſborough caſtle, Tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, Portcheſter, Cambridge, Oxford, Tunbridge, and ſeveral others. The mount on which Durham tower ſtands is near forty-four perpendicular feet in height, from the level of the Place-Green, to the foot of the building, and it appears to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0782100202:299"/>
have been forced from the level; to the above eminence add the natural height of the whole hill from the level of the river, and it will be upwards of one hundred and thirty perpendicular feet. It is the opinion of a ſkilful architect <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr Geo. Nicholſon, who is director of the repairs now making at the cathedral.</note>, that the foundation of this tower goes down to the rock; and by the falling in of ſome arches, we diſcover that the whole erection is vaulted underneath; but as thoſe vaults, from their apparent depth, do not occupy above a fourth part of the height of the mount, we are left to conjecture in what manner the reſt of the eminence was forced or ſupported: It is apprehended, that after the Norman tower was built, the mount did not remain cut out into terraces agreeable to the preſent form, but that the ſides were regularly ſloped from the building to the plain, to render it as difficult to be climbed as poſſible, forming a regular glacis or talus round the tower; and that the approach to the gate of the tower was by a long ſlight of ſteps, from the inner court, ſo narrow that two perſons only could paſs at a time; and ſo open on each ſide that an aſſailant oppoſed might be tumbled headlong to the bottom. Mr King, deſcribing Coningſborough caſtle in the 6th volume of the Archaeologia, ſays, <q>The firſt thing that ſtrikes the eye is a very remarkable ſloping part of the foundation walls, riſing to a great height like a mount, and having in many parts, in conſequence of its being covered with earth and moſs, the appearance of a ſmall hill exactly of the ſame dimenſions as the caſtle itſelf; the bottom of this ſloping part appears almoſt circular, but higher up are ſeen more fully, ſix vaſt projecting buttreſſes, aſcending in a ſtill more ſteep direction, to prop and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the building. Immediately above this ſloping part the tower riſes perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to a great height: Its inſide forms a compleat circle; but on the outſide appear ſix additional ſquare turrets, which are, however, merely the continuation upwards of the buttreſſes juſt mentioned.</q> Before the preſent terraces of our tower were formed, perhaps the ribs of the foundation appeared ſupporting the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of each angle; and by ſuch a baſe, mining, which was much practiſed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, would be impeded or rendered impracticable: The tower of Coningſborough caſtle forms an hexagon; Durham tower an ill-formed octagon of irregular ſides; ſome of the fronts exceeding others in breadth ſeveral feet; the angles are ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by buttreſſes, and a parapet has run round the ſummit of the whole building, with a breaſt wall and embrazure: The diameter of this tower in the wideſt part is ſixty-three feet ſix inches, and in the narroweſt ſixty-one feet: It has contained four ſtories or tiers of apartments, excluſive of the vaults: The great entrance is on the weſt ſide: There is nothing now left of this edifice but the mount, vaults, and outſide ſhell; which latter, from its noble appearance, and the great ornament
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0782100202:300"/>
it is to the city, has been an object of attention of many of the prelates.— Chambrè tells us biſhop Hatfield built a tower to the caſtle; <hi>In caſtello Dunelm. aedificiae quae antiquitate &amp; vetuſtate conſumpta et debilitata fuerant, renovavit; &amp; autam epiſcopalem &amp; aulam conſtabulari cum aliis aedificiis in eodem de novo conſtruxit.

The tower was only lined round the outward wall with apartments, ſo as to leave an inner area or wall from top to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, by which the engines of war, and neceſſaries in time of danger and attack, were drawn up and diſtributed to the ſeveral parts of the building: Thoſe apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been approached by five different ſtaircaſes or turnpikes in the angles, the remains of which are yet viſible, ſo that the parapet could be mounted, the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries lined with armed men, and the apartments guarded in a very ſhort time, and equally as quick the garriſon could deſcend, and be ready for a ſally. At preſent the mount, as we obſerved before, is formed into terraces, as well for ornament as recreation: The uppermoſt terrace is ten feet wide, and laid with gravel, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a proſpect not only of the whole city and its beautiful environs, but alſo an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive view of the country as far as Gateſhead-fell, Penſhaw, Newbottle, Warden Law, and Quarrington, with the nearer objects, Newton-hall, Pittington, Sherburn, Aykley-heads, and other places of note: Between this and the lower terrace is a graſs ſlope, ſupported by a breaſt wall, and you deſcend by twenty-three ſteps; the ſecond terrace is of equal breadth with the other, and laid with gravel, and is in like manner ſeparated from the loweſt terrace by a graſs ſlope and breaſt wall, to which you deſcend by twenty-one ſteps; this terrace is of like width and form as the others, and is twenty-two ſteps above the level of the garden below.</p>
                  <p>Biſhop Pudſey, who acceded to the biſhopric in 1153, reſtored ſome part of the caſtle, which had ſuffered by fire. To this prelate we are induced to attribute the building of the firſt hall to the palace; but with other parts of the caſtle going to decay, the preſent hall, with the conſtable's-hall, were afterwards erected by biſhop Hatfield: This prelate's works were magnificent; an improved taſte prevailed in his time, and much ornament was introduced in buildings of this kind: The hall erected by him, we are told, was near one hundred and twenty yards in length, of a proportionable height and width, and lighted on every ſide; the roof of wood was ornamented in every rafter, and other decorations were given to this ſpacious room.

Biſhop Fox found it too expenſive to keep this ſpacious hall in repair, or it was too large for his neceſſary purpoſes, and therefore he reduced it conſiderably; he took away the ſeat at the ſouth end, and converted that part into a kitchen and ſteward's apartments, ſo that it was leſſened at leaſt one-third of its original ſize; yet there remained room enough for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the princeſs Margaret, and her attendants, in her way to Scotland; on that occaſion, we read, that all the nobility and people of diſtinction of the northern parts, as well ſpirituals as temporals, were preſent, and the ſervices conſiſted of that gorgeous diſplay of proviſions, called by the writers of that time <hi>double dinners.</hi> This prelate began to repair the great tower, and built a hall, kitchen, and ſome other apartments therein, but before his plan was far advanced, he was tranſlated, and no further progreſs was made in that work: We ſee his arms in the partition wall of the great hall. Biſhop Tunſtall made great repairs to the caſtle, he built the preſent gateway and tower, and flanked it with a ſtrong wall on either hand: He brought water to the palace in pipes, it being ſupplied before by wells and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs; he erected the preſent gallery, and made a new approach to the apartments there; he alſo built a beautiful little chapel, which has received improvements from ſucceeding prelates, as the arms of Coſin and Talbot placed therein denote. We ſhould not omit to remark in this place, that on the facing of the entrance into the ſtalls, at the weſt end, is a ſtriking mark of Wolſey's arrogance; on the oak are carved the cardinal's arms, taking the dexter ſide againſt the arms of his principality and See of Durham. Biſhop Barnes and Neile made great repairs: The latter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged the windows, and thereby gave the apartments a new degree of elegance.</p>
                  <p>The great tower became an object of incumbrance ſoon after the Reformation; and at length, in biſhop Morton's time, it was one of thoſe erections for which the biſhops were decreed to be diſcharged from future dilapidations, ſo that nothing but the love of ornament, and the ſolemn grace it added to the aſpect of the caſtle in particular, and to this beautiful city in general, has ſince that period for a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury and a half ſaved it from utter demolition and ruin.</p>
                  <p>Biſhop Morton had the honour of a royal viſit at his caſtle of Durham, and then diſplayed the ancient hoſpitality and magnificence of the prelates of this See; he entertained king Charles I. and all his retinue in the hall of this palace, when he
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0782100202:302"/>
made his tour into Scotland, expending, as it is ſaid, no leſs a ſum than fifteen hundred pounds a day on the occaſion. Biſhop Coſin, whoſe memory is dear to thoſe that venerate the ancient ſeats of our prelates, put the caſtle of Durham into repair, made a new entrance into the hall, renewed the fountain, added many apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and gave much ornament to the exterior parts; he again reduced the hall, by taking off an audience room at the north end, at the foot of the great ſtaircaſe; and put a ſcreen of wainſcot at the ſouth end, to conceal the paſſages to the kitchen and offices; he alſo wainſcotted the hall round about. In its preſent ſtate the hall is one hundred and eighty feet in length, thirty-ſix feet in width, and about fifty feet in height to the rafters; is lighted by three large windows to the weſt, and two to the eaſt. Since biſhop Coſin's time, ſucceeding prelates have made improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, as well as the work of more remote ages, are diſtinguiſhed by the arms placed on various parts of the building. Biſhop Trevor did a great deal, particularly to the north front, which opens upon a terrace eighty paces long above the moat, terminated by the round tower before ſpoken of: He improved many of the apartments by putting in chimney-pieces of ſtone-work, highly wrought in the Gothic ſtile, and well adapted to the figure of the rooms, making very large ſaſh windows in the ſame order, and ſtuccoing the walls and ceilings, in which work he employed the ableſt maſters <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>From the Gaol-gates to the Market-place, you paſs down Sadler-ſtreet, having Elvet-bridge on the right-hand. This ſtreet, or ſome conſiderable part of it, was anciently called the Fleſhewer-raw, and is ſtill occupied by butchers. We are led to lament that want of police in the city which ſhould correct the brutal ſpectacle of ſlaughtering animals in the ſtreet; ſhocking to travellers, who inſtantly turn aſide with diſguſt, and paſs to other places, not only with prejudice of mind againſt the whole place, but with cenſures on its inhabitants: They look back on the magnificent buildings, and whilſt they recollect the royal rights of the powerful prelate, the learned body of men who ſit in the chapter-houſe, the re-infranchiſed body corporate of the city, and the opulent and polite inhabitants in general, they exclaim, <q>In this ſeat of learning, the epiſcopal capital, and center of the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial law, hitherto common decency has not drawn a ſkreen before the execution of the ſlaughtering knife that ſerves their luxury.</q>

               <p>On the weſt ſide of the ſquare is the Town-hall, with commodious apartments for public feſtivals and other uſes, lately rebuilt on a modern plan. The old hall was erected and given to the city by biſhop Tunſtal, ornamented with a large cupola in the center, and in other reſpects exhibiting the elegance which was introduced to theſe northern parts in that prelate's age: Whether before biſhop Tunſtal's time there was a <hi>Common-hall</hi> for the burgeſſes, is not well aſcertained; but there

               <p>The church is very plain and meanly built, being conſtructed of ſmall and periſhable ſtones, ſo that from frequent pointing it is now almoſt covered with mortar. It varies greatly from the ſituation of other churches, evidently to ſuit the ground whereon it ſtands, which ſerves to ſupport the opinion we before gave, that anciently, by a ſluice, the city was here occaſionally inſulated, by bringing in the ſtreams of the Were. The north wall is very ſtrong and lofty, ſupported by ſquare buttreſſes, or rather baſtions. This church hath two ſide ailes, that to the north running the whole length of the building; the ſouth aile is ſhortened by the tower ſtanding on the ſouth-weſt angle. The nave and two ſide ailes are twenty paces in width, and to the chancel the nave is twenty-ſix paces in length: The ſouth aile is formed by one ſmall octagonal column of conſiderable height, ſupporting blunt pointed arches: The north aile hath two ſhort octagonal columns, with wide and lofty blunt pointed arches, riſing from brackets at the extremities. The chancel opens with a pointed arch in the center, to the ſouth a ſmall column with a pointed arch, to the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0782100202:310"/>
north a ſhort round column, and irregular circular arches: The chancel is in length ſix paces to the ſteps, and the receſs for the altar is ſix paces wide. At the opening of the chancel are the ſeats for the mercers company and body corporate, neatly fitted up. The roof of the north aile is ſupported by three half-arches, riſing from octagonal brackets. The gates have circular arches: The ſouth windows are modern and ſaſhed; the north windows irregular, and ſome under pointed arches. This fabric hath been conſtructed at various times; the north aile bears marks of remote antiquity; but no records afford us further light therein, than that we find Galfrid de Elimer rector in 1133; though by the mode of architecture we ſhould be led to give this church a cotemporary date with the firſt ſettlement of the Saxons at Durham.</p>

               <p>Near adjoining to the church is the old city gateway, called Claypeth-gate; a weak edifice, nearly ſimilar to that which lately ſtood in the South-Bailey, called the Water-gate, having no machicolation, and only the appearance of a ſingle pair of gates, built with irregular ſtones and much mortar; the preſent remains of the city wall ſhew it was of ſimilar conſtruction, remarked by Leland to be of mean maſonry: This gate has a foot paſſage at the eaſt ſide. Why this gateway now appears ſo weak, may be owing to the out-works being totally defaced; and here, in particular, if there was a water-ſluice, with a draw-bridge, as we preſume there was, leſs ſtrength was required in the gateway <note n="*" place="bottom">

The arch which ſeparated the chancel from the nave is broken down: The chancel is ten paces long, and of equal width with the reſt of the church; has a modern window to the eaſt, two windows under point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arches to the ſouth with pilaſters, and one ſimilar to the north. The font is a large uncouth cauldron.

                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0782100202:318"/>The traveller who is conducted to this church, ſhould be admitted at the north door, and depart from the ſouth door, where a noble proſpect opens to the view, too extenſive for a picture, and too rich for deſcription. The inadequate ideas which language can convey, are to be lamented by the reader who has a taſte for rural beauties, and the elegance of landſcape. The church of St Giles ſtands upon very elevated ground, open to the ſouth where the view is unobſtructed. In front the meadow grounds form a ſteep deſcent to the river; on one wing cloſed by the wood called Pelaw Wood, on the other by the buildings of the ſtreet. At the foot of the hill the river Were forms a beautiful canal, almoſt a mile in length, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by Elvet bridge to the right, and by the wooded incloſures of Old Durham on the left. On the oppoſite ſhore is the race ground, conſiſting of an extended tract of level meads, from whence, by a gradual aſcent, riſe the two Elvets; the ſtreet of Old Elvet running parallel, the other obliquely, bordered with gardens, and terminated by Elvet church; a handſome ſtructure. The channel of the river lying between New Elvet and the Bailies, affords an agreeable break or change in the objects; the ſloping gardens being ſeen over the buildings of Elvet, ſoftened to the eye with that pleaſing teint which the diſtance produces. On the brink of the aſcent ſtand the Bailies, object riſing gradually above object, guarded with the remains of the town wall, and crowned with the cathedral church, which in this view preſents the north and eaſt fronts, like the mitre which binds the temples of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; giving the nobleſt ſupreme ornament to the capital of the principality. To the right Elvet bridge, with ſeven arches, receives the ſtream, and intercepts a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther view of the progreſs of the river: Over it, tier above tier, riſe the buildings of Sadler-ſtreet, the gloomy and ſolemn towers of the gaol, and the battlement and octagonal tower of the caſtle; the trophies of civil juriſdiction wearing the aſpect of old ſecular authority, and the frowns of feudal power. Between the chief objects, the cathedral and caſtle, on the nearer back ground, South-ſtreet, with its hanging gardens, makes a fine curvature; behind which Brandon Mount, with a ſpit of high land extending towards Auckland, form the horizon. Further to the right,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0782100202:319"/>
from the banks of the river, riſe the buildings of the Market-place, crouding the tower of the church, from whence the ſtreets of Claypeth and Gillygate extend. Thus far deſcription has proceeded without much faultering, but in the other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the ſcene it is faint and totally inadequate: Whoever would know the reſt muſt come and view it <note n="*" place="bottom">See the view placed as a head-piece to the firſt page of this volume.</note>. Over the meadows, in the center, a precipice riſes near one hundred perpendicular feet in height, called MAIDEN CASTLE, fear, or cliff; the ſteep ſides of the hill to the right and left are covered with a foreſt of old oaks, and the foot of the cliff is waſhed by the river, whoſe ſtream appears again at this point. The lofty ridge of hills cloathed with oaks, ſtretching away, forms a ziz-zag figure; at the moſt diſtant point of which, the great ſouthern road, up the new incloſed grounds of Elvet moor, is ſeen climbing the hill, for near a mile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which very diſtant eminences form a blue-tinged horizon. To the left of Maiden caſtle cliff you look upon a rich valley, highly cultivated, extending nearly five miles in length and two in width, bending to the ſouth-weſt, through which the river winds its ſilver ſtream, in the figure of an S: Hanging woods ſhut in each ſide of the nearer vale, where are finely diſpoſed, the pleaſant village of <hi>Shincliff,</hi> the bridge of three arches, the villa of William Rudd, <abbr>eſq</abbr> and <hi>Hough-hall houſe:</hi> The extreme part of the valley is cloſed by the woods of Shincliff, <hi>Butterby,</hi> and <hi>Croxdale,</hi> forming an elegant amphitheatre; over theſe riſe diſtant hills, lined out with incloſures, giving the yellow and brown teint to the landſcape over the richer coloured woods. The whole finiſhed with an elevated horizon, on the wings of which are ſcattered the villages of <hi>Ferryhill</hi> and <hi>Merrington;</hi> the tower of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington church forming a beautiful and lofty obeliſk. One of the greateſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of this landſcape is, that the ground riſes gradually before you, and juſt ſuch a diſtance is maintained as preſerves all the objects diſtinct; not like the landſcapes painted by the Flemiſh and Dutch maſters. To the left you look down upon <hi>Old Durham houſe,</hi> its terraces and hanging gardens, with a fine bend of cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated country ſtretching away through another opening of the hills towards the eaſt, bounded by the high grounds of Quarrington, and the cliffs of Coxhoe Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kilns; more ruſtic than the other views, and being in a ſimpler nature, affords a pleaſing variety to the eye of the man of taſte, who ſtands (if we may be allowed the extravagant expreſſion) <hi>on this enchanted ground</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr Doubleday's houſe, which is covered with lead, commands from the roof the whole of this proſpect, with a wide, though much leſs beautiful, view to the northward.</note>.</p>

                     <hi>Old Durham houſe</hi> is gone to decay, nothing now remaining but apartments for a farmer: It was anciently the ſeat of the Booths, afterwards of the Cockburns, lords of Ormſton, and in more modern times became the eſtate of the Tempeſts, to which latter family it paſſed by intermarriage with the heireſs of the Heaths. The gardens are formed into terraces of a conſiderable length. This ſweet retirement is become a place of public reſort, where concerts of muſic have frequently been performed in the ſummer evenings, and the company regaled with fruit, tea, &amp;c. The gardens are open all ſummer for rural recreation. The terraces command the elegant valley proſpect before deſcribed.</p>

                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0782100202:320"/>At the corner of the garden ſome few years ago were the remains of a very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient building, with a circular window, and other appearances of the chapel form.

And this, as he ſays, chiefly promoted and carried on by a confederacy between the biſhop's chancellor and ſheriff, who, by their under officers and agents, have illegally ſeized upon whatever of his property they can lay their hands on, on pretence of an outlawry or excommunication, of which he had no notice till the ſeizure was actually made: And that upon application to his ſovereign, the biſhop, for redreſs, he has been denied all manner of relief; and therefore intreats me to repreſent his caſe to you the parliament's committee, which I am now preparing to that end. W. Bohun.</q>

                     <p>Mr J. Cade, of Durham, in a tract publiſhed in the 7th vol. of the Archaeologia, p. 75, has mentioned this place, and ſome works at Old Durham, extracts from which are placed here, that the reader, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the traveller, may judge for himſelf on the ſubject. <q>In the firſt place then, I would obſerve, that there are ſeveral camps or ſtations in this county, which were undoubtedly of Roman original; but being ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occupied by different tribes of adventurers, and altered according to their reſpective modes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, this circumſtance has cauſed their primary occupancy to be overlooked by antiquaries.

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0782100202:323"/>five hundred feet in length, &amp;c. Our camp at Maiden Caſtle I ſuppoſe may have derived its name from the Britiſh word <hi>mad</hi> pulcher or fair, which the Rev. Mr Pegge thus ingeniouſly explains, in treating of the maiden way or maiden caſtle, in the county of Weſtmerland, and which term is particularly applicable to the delightful ſituation of Old Durham. It alſo has a better claim to be conſidered as the Condurcum of the Romans, from which it is about two miles diſtant, than the camp near Sunderland bridge, (which is evidently of Daniſh conſtruction) and which the annotator upon Camden ſays, was the opinion of a very great antiquary. I may likewiſe obſerve, with the learned Mr Whitaker and others, that the Romans had generally a ſummer and a winter ſtation, ſituated within a few miles of each other, and often on oppoſite ſides of the ſame river; which entirely coincides with the ſituation of Cheſter and this camp; the former might be the ſummer ſtation, and this the winter. In Hollinſhed's Chronicle, firſt edition, p. 225, we have an account of a memorable ſiege which this place ſuſtained in favour of king Athelſtan, againſt an army of Scots and Danes, commanded by Godfrey brother to Anlaf, and ſon to Sithric, the Daniſh king of the Northumbrians, about the year 930, under the title Dureſme<note n="*" place="bottom">Dureſme appears to have been a name introduced by the Normans, on account of the fortreſs built here after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, to keep the natives in ſubjection.</note>, though the foundations of the preſent city were not laid till ſixty years afterwards; and Marianus mentions a ſynod being held at Dunelhoo, A<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 822. This ſtation, I imagine, was formerly thought of great conſequence, but it at length ſuffered the rate of many others in the northern parts, when William the Conqueror made that horrid devaſtation between York and this place, and erected his caſtrum in the new city<note n="†" place="bottom">A melancholy inſtance of this depopulation, amongſt many others, is to be met with at Acley, (or Acliff) in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which may probably derive its name from Acca, biſhop of Haguſtald, in the beginning of the eighth century, and where Sir Henry Spelman mentions two Saxon councils having been held, annis 782 and 789. About a mile from the aforeſaid village, after the graſs is cut, the foundations of a conſiderable town, with a large church in form of a croſs, are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous.</note>; the fortifications were then partly level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but enough is left to point out its former magnitude and importance; it being, in my opinion, much larger than Dr Stukeley <note n="‡" place="bottom">His deſcription is as follows; Iter Boreale, p. 70. <q>Eaſtward, over the river Were, upon another peninſula of high ground, I ſaw a camp, called Maiden Caſtle, which I judge to be Roman. It is almoſt incompaſſed too by a rivulet fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the river from the eaſt. It is of an oblong form, five hundred feet long, very ſteep on three ſides; the neck is guarded by a rampart, and without that, at ſome little diſtance by a ditch.

A gentleman, with whom I am acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, has carefully ſurveyed the old road from this place by Kepyer hoſpital, and he aſſures me, that in a dry ſeaſon, the piers of a bridge are obvious in the bed of the river, ſeemingly of Roman conſtruction; and I have authority to ſay, that coins have been formerly ploughed up here, and lately ſome of the lower em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire have alſo been diſcovered within its vicinage. The ground plot and ramparts of the watch tower, which ſerved for ſignals to this ſtation, are viſible and almoſt entire at the entrance of Gillygate moor, and exactly correſpond in form with thoſe on the Roman wall in Northumberland. At Newton-hall likewiſe, on the oppoſite ſide of the river, there has been an exploratory caſtrum, ſeemingly for the ſecurity of Old Durham and Cheſter-le-Street.</q>

This ſuppoſed vallum is at preſent ſo much levelled, that if ever it was forced, it now appears no otherwiſe than the ſwift ſlope of the bank on the ſide of the brook, and the mount is only a natural ſwell or rotundity of the back ground. The plot of ground choſen by this gentleman for the ſtation or camp, on the north-weſt ſide neareſt to old Durham, and where the brook doth not run, ſhews ſome deep trenches and high earth fences; but the whole is ſo irregular, that it is not poſſible to derive any diſtinct figure from the remains of the works. He quotes Hollinſhed's Chronicle to ſupport a conjecture, that about the year 930, this place ſuſtained a ſiege. We beg leave to compare this authority with others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to in the 3d page of this volume. We have not been fortunate enough in our reading, hitherto to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any evidence that William the Conqueror, when he laid waſte the country, deſtroyed this place, or <q>that it ſuffered the fate of many others in the northern parts, and that the fortifications were then partly levelled.</q>—Dr Stukeley's deſcription may, perhaps more happily be applied to the place deſcribed by us, and delineated in our plate; it is certainly of "high ground" hanging "over the river." and almoſt full "eaſt" of the city: "Of an oblong form" one hundred and ſeventy paces long on the moſt extended ſide, which comes almoſt accurately to his deſcription, <q>five hundred feet long, very ſteep on three ſides, the neck guarded by a rampart, and without that, at ſome little diſtance, by a ditch.</q> The laſt circumſtance noted by that author fixes the point. "The proſpect is large, more eſpecially eaſtward." The elevation of Old Durham ground, pointed out by Mr Cade, <q>no part is above fifteen feet from the plain, where any ſlope lies upon the margin of the brook; and the proſpect conſequently is bounded eaſtward, by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the vale, at the riſing grounds of Shincliff, not more than a quarter of a mile diſtant.</q>

                     <p>Mr Cade's poſitions, in the treatiſe from whence the foregoing extract is made, may, it is hoped, without an invidious appearance be ſhortly commented on, to the intent the reader may form a competent idea of the circumſtances, or be led to enquire for himſelf upon the ſpot.</p>

the cliff, which is almoſt perpendicular, and about one hundred feet in height. —On the right and left the ſteep ſides of the mount are covered with a thick foreſt of oaks: The crown of the mount conſiſts of a level area or plain, forty paces wide on the ſummit of the ſcar, in the front or north eaſt ſide, one hundred and ſixty paces long on the left-hand ſide, and one hundred and ſeventy paces on the right. The approach is eaſy on the land ſide, from the ſouth-weſt, fortified with a ditch and breaſt work: The entrance or paſſage over the ditch is not in the middle, but made to correſpond with the natural riſe of the outward ground; probably this entrance was guarded by a draw-bridge: The ditch is twelve paces wide, and runs with a little curvature to each edge of the ſlope, now covered with wood as before noted; on one hand being fifty paces in length, on the other eighty paces. After paſſing the ditch there is a level parade or platform,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0782100202:324"/>
twenty paces wide, and then a high earth fence, now nine feet perpendicular, which, as in moſt places of the like kind, it is apprehended, was faced with maſon-work: A breaſt work has run from the earth fence on each hand along the brink of the hill, to the edge of the cliff or ſcar. The earth fence cloſes the whole neck of land, and is in length one hundred paces, forming the ſouth-weſt ſide of the area. Theſe particulars are illuſtrated by the annexed plate. It is moſt probable this was the <hi>vetus burgus Dunelmenſis</hi> noted in the records; it is at a little diſtance from the head of the ſtreet called Old Elvet, in a direct line therewith, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to Old Durham, the river dividing it from the latter place, and almoſt filling up the intervening ſpace: It was ſupported anciently, as is preſumed, by another fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs called the <hi>Peel,</hi> erected on the oppoſite eminence, which now bears the name of Peel Law. Many places in the northern counties retain the name of Peel and Law, implying caſtle and hill, whoſe antiquity may be traced back to the Saxon times. We preſumed to offer an opinion, in the preceding pages, that in the valley over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked by this fortreſs, the wandering Saxons ſat down with the remains of Saint Cuthbert; and we ſubmit to the candour of the reader, whether that idea is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vague and improbable. The name of <hi>maiden</hi> applied to a caſtle is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come indefinite; whether it imples <hi>beautiful,</hi> or a fortreſs which never has been conquered, has not been determined: Our beſt antiquaries give preference to the diſtinction <hi>fair</hi> or <hi>beautiful.</hi> The old fort, on Stainmore, in Weſtmoreland, is called <hi>Maiden Caſtle,</hi> and the adjoining incloſures bear the name of Peel-yard.</p>
               <p>Biſhop Carilepho, on his bringing in the canons regular, granted to the convent, Elvet as a free borough, that they might have forty merchants there, exempted from all dues and duties to him and his ſucceſſors <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide notes vol. i. p. 134.—Mon.

               <p>Having treſpaſſed much on the reader's patience, we proceed with the pariſh of St Oſwald. There are two ſtreets, the one called Old Elvet, the other New Elvet; from New Elvet branches out a ſtreet, called Hallgarth-ſtreet; from the prior's hall, named in the records <hi>Elvet Hall,</hi> the manor and barony houſe ſtanding therein <note n="¶" place="bottom">John de Herdwyck, d. ſ. &amp;c. a meſſ. in Elvet, Durham, held of the prior of Durham, by ſuit at the three head courts yearly, at the priors court at Elvet-hall, &amp;c.—Inq. p. m. q'o Skirlaw, ap.

At the end of this ſtreet is a lofty hill of a conical figure, called Mont'joye, riſing from the plain or valley, (but on the oppoſite ſide of the river to Old Durham) where we have preſumed the Saxons ſat down with the remains of St Cuthbert. In French hiſtory we find a definition of this hiſtorical title, for there the name of Mont-joye is given to heaps of ſtones laid together by pilgrims, on which croſſes are erected, when they come within view of the end of their journey; and ſo betwixt St Dennis, in France, and Paris, they are called St Dennis's mont-joyes. When the travellers, bearing St Cuthbert's remains, arrived here, they would view the whole ground of their deſtination; and it lies in the exact line in which we preſume they made their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs from Ripon. The extremity of New Elvet bears the name of Church-ſtreet.</p>
               <p>The church ſtands in a fine elevated ſituation, on the brink of the river. Much conjecture ariſes in etymologies; perhaps the ſituation gave the name to Elvet, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the French <hi>elevè,</hi> lofty, ſublime. The ſtreet of Old Elvet is very broad, excellently paved, and well built <note n="*" place="bottom">

The roof is flat and ſtuccoed. The veſtry room is alſo very neat. There is much broken painted glaſs in the windows, but no figure perfect. Againſt the ſecond pillar, chained to a deſk, is "The defence of the apology of the church of England," with the ſermon preached at Paul's croſs, by the biſhop of Sarum, 1560, and other curious tracts.

               <p>There was an hoſpital dedicated to St Leonard, in this pariſh; but who was the founder, what was the conſtitution, or the time of its building, remain unknown: It is not named in the Monaſticon, or any other authorities before us, ſave thoſe of the church of Durham. We are led to conjecture that this hoſpital ſtood at Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trove or Butterby, as that manor is tithe-free, and ſituated near the medicinal ſprings hereafter noted.</p>
               <p>Adjoining to the ſouth wall of the church-yard, is a field, called the Anchorage, (or Anchoritage, Hermitage, or Hermit's cloſe) and adjoining thereto is a field called the Palmer's (or Mendicant's) cloſe; but we have met with no evidence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to a hermitage here.</p>
               <p>From the ſouth-weſt corner of the church-yard you enter upon thoſe beautiful natural ſcenes which border the river. A walk is laid open, and kept in order for the recreation of the public, at the charge of the dean and chapter, whoſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence on this and various other occaſions, demands the warmeſt acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Mr Pennant, ſpeaking of the banks, ſays, they <q>are covered with wood, through which are cut numbers of walks, contrived with judgment, and happy in the moſt beautiful and ſolemn ſcenery. They impend over the water, and receive a moſt venerable improvement from the caſtle and ancient cathedral, which tower far above.</q> The banks are ſteep, and cloathed with foreſt trees;
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0782100202:331"/>
in ſeveral parts the rocks break forth, where venerable oaks are ſuſpended: The river, with a pure and tranquil ſtream, glides at the bottom of the hill, reflecting the noble objects which crown her banks: Here the opening valley pours forth a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulet, and there the ſolemn dell, with Nature's wildeſt beauties, yawns with broken rocks, which yield the living fountain from their lips, whilſt each brow is crowded with bending oaks, whoſe naked talons and twiſted arms rival each other in gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſque figure. You ſee the towers of the cathedral riſing ſublimely from the wood, and lifting their ſolemn battlements to the clouds; and beyond thoſe the turrets of the caſtle, on their rocky baſe; whilſt on the other hand, the houſes of South-ſtreet are ſtretched along the ſummits of hanging gardens: In front is an elegant new bridge of three arches, through the bows of which, at the firſt diſtance, are ſeen a fine canal of ſtill water, with a mill; at the ſecond diſtance, Framwelgate bridge, of two elliptic arches; and through the bows of the ſecond bridge, the pleaſant villa of <hi>Crook Hall</hi>

On turning about, you have a view not leſs pleaſing for its ſimplicity; you command the walk before noted, with a fine bend of the river, forming a creſcent; the banks richly cloathed with wood, and crowned with the church of St Oſwald. This walk is much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, and deſervedly has the applauſe of every traveller. We preſent to the reader two plates of thoſe favourite views on the banks.</p>
               <p>The New Bridge was erected in 1781, at the expence of the dean and chapter, by Mr Nicholſon their architect: It is upon a beautiful modern plan, the arches ſemicircular, with a baluſtraded battlement. There was formerly a narrow bridge near this place for horſes to paſs, which was carried away by the floods in 1771 <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>At this bridge there happened a remarkable accident: A Mr Dalſton of the Cothamhall-garth family, forced his horſe over the battlements, in the dark, and was killed; he was paſſing the bridge on return from a country viſit with a large company, and though in the midſt of them, was miſſed by none till they arrived at the houſe where he was to lodge.</p>
                     <p>An account was given of the ſtood in 1771, in the public prints. The waters were eight feet ten inches higher at Durham than ever known before.</p>
                  </note>: The accident proved fortunate for the public, as it occaſioned the preſent hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſtructure <note n="‡" place="bottom">See the plate.</note> to be erected, which being of a ſuitable width, the chapter permit gentlemen's carriages to paſs thereon, without toll.</p>
               <p>FRAMWELGATE BRIDGE, ſeen upon this view, has one pier and two elliptic arches, of ninety feet ſpan, ſo flat as to be conſtructed on the quarter ſection of a circle, calculated to ſuit the low ſhores on each ſide: The maſonry is plain, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, as is proved by its age; it was built by biſhop Flambard, has ſtood near ſeven hundred years, and is perhaps the fineſt model of bridge-building, of that antiquity, in Britain. A gateway tower which ſtood on the city end of the bridge, was removed of late years for the conveniency of carriages, which have encreaſed amazingly in number within this century. Biſhop Bainbrigg granted to prior Caſtel and the convent, all the waſte land between this bridge and Elvet bridge,

                  <p>When the church and other edifices at Finchale were erected, the remains of which are yet ſtanding, it is not poſſible to determine with preciſion, no evidence thereof being found in the archives of the dean and chapter: From the order of building ſeen in ſome parts of the ruins, much may be attributed to Henry the biſhop's ſon; but other parts appear of older date. The ſolemn remains are
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0782100202:338"/>
ſituated in a very deep vale, on the banks of the river, where the ſtream making a ſweep, forms a little level plot, which is almoſt covered with the buildings; ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to the north by the lofty rocks and hanging woods of Cocken, and on every other ſide by ſteep hills. The river flows ſwiftly over a rocky channel; and the murmuring of the waterfalls is re-echoed from the groves and cliffs. The preſent buildings are much diſunited, ſo that it is impoſſible to trace all the ancient offices of this religious manſion.</p>
                  <p>At the entrance into the church, at the weſt end, on the right-hand, is a ſquare vault, the roof of which is groined from the angles and the ſide walls, and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the center by a ſhort octagonal pillar: There was an aqueduct to this place, and it had an upper apartment. The church, though ſmall, is in the form of a croſs; the gateway, at the weſt end, has a pointed arch of ſeveral members, riſing from ſmall round columns or pilaſters, with plain capitals: The nave is twenty-eight paces in length, and ſeven in width. In the center of the croſs it appears there has been a tower or ſpire, ſupported on four circular pillars, very ſhort and heavy, exceeding even part of Durham cathedral for diſproportion: The pillars are ſo maſſive, that one of them contains a turpike ſtaircaſe, which led to the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure; they form a ſquare of equal ſides, twenty-one feet from pillar to pillar, the capitals of an octagonal form: The center had a dome or vaulted roof, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſecting ribs, and on the eaſt ſide one pointed arch remains. In the etching given in Stevens' Monaſticon, drawn by King, a ſhort octagonal ſpire of ſtone is placed on the tower. On the north ſide of the nave, are four pillars ſupporting pointed arches; the pillars round, with capitals formed of double rolls, conſtructed of a durable ſtone, and entire; the ſouth ſide is cloſe, a long cloiſter or paſſage running on the outſide to communicate with the ſouth limb of the croſs. The north and ſouth limbs of the croſs are exactly equal in length and width, being twelve paces long and ſeven broad: They are very ill lighted; one great window in the ſouth limb, towards the eaſt, being the chief: Indeed it appears that thoſe parts have been added to the original ſtructure, or rebuilt; as they are in no wiſe ſimilar to the other parts in maſonry or materials. The choir is remarkable; from the eaſt window, ten paces in length, it is incloſed with high dark walls, and from thence to the croſs, being nine paces, (the whole nineteen paces long) are two round columns on each ſide, ſimilar to thoſe in the nave, bearing three pointed arches: The eaſt window has been ſive paces wide, (as appears from the meaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſole, for all the reſt is gone) with outward buttreſſes, ornamented with ſtone pinnacles, one of which on the ſouth ſide ſtill remains. It is very ſingular that windows of a modern date have been placed between the pillars, to fill up the arches, formed of a yellow and periſhable kind of ſtone; which work now ſeparates itſelf from the arches: The yellow ſtone has been won from the bed of the river, and is of the ſame kind with thoſe of which the out-buildings are conſtructed; the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns and arches are of a bluer nature, and in no wiſe injured by time; they ſeem to be of the Normandy ſtone, much like the columns and caſtings of ſeveral of the ancient caſtles. Allowing this obſervation to be juſt, we ſhould be apt to conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture theſe columns and arches originally divided the center from a ſide aile; but
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0782100202:339"/>
on ſtrict ſearch, no foundations or other work was diſcovered which could encourage this idea: If there were no ſide ailes, then this was a fabric of ſingular conſtruction; for it will follow, that the nave and part of the choir were open to the air on the ſides, like a cloiſter: There is ſomething ſimilar in the abbey of Furneſs, in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire, where a part on the north ſide is open. The founder, in imitation of the ſeverities of St Godric, might think it expedient to deprive the monks of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and leave the church open to the air; but in after ages, when the religious profeſſed more outſide ſhew than real zeal, yielded to the faſcinations of luxury, and ſtudied gratifications and ſoftneſs, they cloſed the arches with windows, made covered paſſages, and transformed this building to its preſent model: As its ſolenm beauties are much admired, if the windows were diſplaced, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns and arches laid open, it would greatly improve its appearance, and render it ſtill a finer objet from the walks of Cocken.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of the monaſtic buildings are very ragged and ruinous: In one part a bow window is projected from a pilaſter in the wall, and ſeems to have appertained to ſome chief apartment. The hall or refectory has been a handſome edifice; it ſtands on the ſouth ſide of a court, nearly of equal ſides, about twenty-ſix paces every way; is twelve paces long, and eight wide, within the walls; having five re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular windows to the ſouth, and four to the north; in the ſtaircaſe or entrance is a large window to the ſouth: The vault underneath is ſupported by a row of four octagonal pillars in the center, without capitals, from whence the groins are ſprung; the pilaſters in the walls and angles are capitalled; the ribs are of hewn ſtone, meeting in points, and the interſtices of the vault wedged with thin ſtones; the whole a fine piece of architecture. This vault is lighted by ſix ſmall windows to the ſouth, and is not above eight feet in height to the crowns of the arches.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid that St Godric, and alſo Henry de Puteaco, or Pudſey, lie interred here; but the floor of the church is covered with ruins, and grown over with brambles and weeds, ſo as to prevent, without much labour, a ſearch for their tombs <note n="*" place="bottom">

No certain etymology of the name of this place is obtained; from its ſituation, in a low and watry plain, we may adopt the word <hi>hough,</hi> which in this country has acceptation for a plain by the ſide of the river; which is ſufficiently deſcriptive of the ſcite of this place. There was in the cathedral church, as before noted, an altar called Howall's altar, erected
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0782100202:341"/>
perhaps by ſome benefactor who beſtowed this place on the church; or indeed it might be called Hotoun's hall, from the prior who built it in the thirteenth century; the corruption to Houghhall ſeems a familiar one. The houſe has been moated round and otherwiſe fortified: Tradition ſays Sir Arthur Hazelrigge poſſeſſed it, and that Oliver lodged there for ſome time; it is certain it was refitted, and perhaps put into a ſtate of defence by ſome of that party; the arms of Cromwell now remain on one of the mantle-pieces in the houſe.</p>

                  <p>anciently written <hi>Beautrove,</hi> from its beautiful ſituation. The river Were runs almoſt round the chief part of the eſtate, the neck of land which divides the ſtreams being only about two hundred yards wide. Here, it has been imagined, ſtood the ancient hoſpital of St Leonard; the founder and inſtitution not now known. The lands are remarkably fertile; the river near the houſe falls ſwiftly over a rough channel, under high rocky ſhores and hanging woods: On the more diſtant ſide of the eſtate the river flows deep and ſlow, forming a canal a mile in length, where the adjacent lands make a conſiderable plain. There is not a ſweeter rural ſcene in the whole county, unadorned and in ſimple nature, for art has not yet extended her hand hither, further than in the ordinary courſe of agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture. As this place is remarkable for its beauty, ſo it is for natural curioſities; ſurrounded with the river, from the fiſſure of a rock, which lies about forty feet from the ſhore, flows a conſiderable ſpring of ſalt water, mixed with a mineral quality. The ſituation of this ſpring ſubjects it to a mixture of freſh water, ſo that it is difficult to know how much ſalt it contains in its pureſt ſtate; on ſeveral trials it has yielded double the quantity produced from ſea water. The ſhore for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance ſhews many ouzings, or ſmall iſſues of ſalt water; from which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, and by a dike or break of the rocks in the channel of the river, a little above the ſpring, it is preſumed a rock or bed of ſalt might be won of ſome value: It has never been ſearched for; the family who lately poſſeſſed the eſtate, from a love of retirement and eaſe, neglected a trial. The ſpring is much reſorted to in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer for its medical qualities; but as the well is not incloſed by any building, it is frequently overflowed by the river. This water is reputed to be an effectual reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for a diſeaſe known among people employed in ſmelting and refining houſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the lead works. Half a pint is ſufficiently purgative for the ſtrongeſt perſon. Within a few yards of the ſalt ſpring, on the oppoſite ſhore, is a fluent ſpring ſtrongly impregnated with ſulphur, without any vitriolic or other compound<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>We find the following account of this ſpring in Gibſon's edition of Camden, which is tranſcribed almoſt literally from Baker's Chronicle.</p>

                        <p>A little below Branſpeth, the Were has many huge ſtones in its channel, never covered but when the river is overflowed by rains: Upon theſe if you pour water, and it mix a little with the ſtone, it becomes brackiſh, a thing which happens nowhere elſe. Nay, at Butterby, a little village, when the river is ſhallow, and ſunk from theſe ſtones in the ſummer time, there burſts out of them a reddiſh ſalt water, which grows ſo white and hard by the heat of the ſun (as hath been thought) that they who live thereabouts uſe it for ſalt. But that the ſaltneſs itſelf proceeds not from the heat of the ſun, is plain by experience, in that which is moſt ſaltiſh, and iſſues out of a rock, in as much as if all the water be laved out of the place, there immediately bubbles out of the body of the rock a water as ſalt as the former; and beſides, the rock out of which it iſſues is a ſalt rock of a ſparkling ſubſtance. On the other ſide of the Were, there is alſo a medicinal ſpring of ſtrong ſulphur; and above it, towards Durham, is a mineral water, of the vitriolic kind, upon which Dr Wilſon wrote his Spadacrene Dunelmenſis.</p>
                        <p>In Lowthorp's Abridgment of the Philoſophical Tranſactions, vol. ii. p. 333, the following account is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, given by Mr Hugh Todd.</p>
                        <p>About a mile and a half out of Durham, on the north eaſt ſide near Butterby, was lately diſcovered a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal ſpring, which is much frequented, and may be of great benefit to the country. It was found by workmen that dug in that place for coal. When they were twelve fathom and a half deep they diſcovered this treaſure of natural phyſic. They then tried the rock about one hundred yards off, where they loſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much about the ſame depth, and inſtead of coal, diſcovered an excellent ſpring of clear water, which iſſues out of the hole their inſtruments made. Theſe ſprings are in a deep gill or valley on the ſhore oppoſite to Butterby.</p>

                  <p>There is a chapel here under St Oſwald's, which being only three miles from Durham, was generally ſerved by a monk from the convent: It is a mean building, conſiſting of a nave or body and chancel, very dark, and in poor repair: No arms or monuments, or any thing memorable. It is in the deanry of Eaſington, and a Peculiar belonging to the dean and chapter of Durham, not certified or in charge, conſequently pays no firſt-fruits or tenths, but only 2s. 6d. as procurations to the biſhop. The real value (1767) was 52l. 10s <note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:0782100202:347"/>A ſmall rivulet runs at the foot of the pleaſure grounds, called Croxdale beck; this water paſſes through a very romantic channel, and ſupplies a paper-mill: It makes its way in a deep and narrow dell, juſt ſufficient to admit a winding road to the mill. The rocks on each hand are ſhaken and columnar, affording ſeveral grand and awful ſcenes; the precipices overhang the vale; and large foreſt trees, bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the cliffs, extend their ſolemn ſhade on every ſide. The natural grottos watered with caſcades, the moſſy banks, the falling ſtreams of the brook, the gloom of the thick foliage, the groteſque rocks, the ſpreading arms of the oaks, the graſſy plots that border the rivulets, all conſpire to pleaſe the mind that has a taſte for ſolitude, romantic ſcenes, and rural meditation. Was a little art employed to ſmooth the paths, to remove ſome few deformities, and with a ſkilful hand to dreſs the wild beauties of the vale, we know not where a more extraordinary ſcene could be found.

                        <p>Extract from Nichol's Anecdotes of Wm Bowyer, Printer, F. S. A. 1782.—"The name of Bedford has occured ſo often in this volume, that it becomes neceſſary to give ſome account of the family. Hilkiah Bedford, of Sibſey, in Lincolnſhire, a Quaker, came to London, and ſettled there as a ſtationer, between the years 1600 and 1625. He married a daughter of Mr Wm Platt, of Highgate, by whom he had a ſon, Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, a mathematical inſtrument maker, in Hoſier-lane, near Weſt-Smithfield. In this houſe (which was afterwards burnt in the great fire of London, 1666) was born the famous Hilkiah, July 23, 1663; who, in 1667, was admitted of St John's college, Cambridge, the firſt ſcholar on the foundation of his maternal grandfather, William Platt. Hilkiah was afterwards elected fellow of his college, and patroniſed by Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage Finch, earl of Winchelſea, but deprived of his preferment (which was in Lincolnſhire) for refuſing to take the oaths at the Revolution, and afterwards kept a boarding-houſe for the Weſtminſter ſcholars. In 1714, being tried in the court of King's Bench, he was fined 1000 marks, and impriſoned three years, for writing, printing, and publiſhing "The Hereditary Right of the Crown of England aſſerted, 1713," folio; the real author of which was George Harbin, a nonjuring clergyman, whom his friendſhip thus ſcreened, and on account of his ſufferings he received 100l. <note n="†" place="bottom">
                              <p>Perhaps the pocketing of the hundred pounds required no ceremony; for Bedford "was proſecuted, and ſuffered impriſonment for fathering" the book; which notorious fact, known to lord Weymouth and all the world, might ſufficiently account for the benefaction to Bedford, whether he was looked upon to be the author of the book or not. But the ſtrange part of the ſtory is, that Harbin, the author of the book, ſhould carry the money to him as the real author.</p>
                           </note> from the earl of Weymouth, who knew not the real author. His other publications were, a tranſlation of an anſwer to Fontenelle's Hiſtory of Oracles, and a Latin life of Dr Barwick, which he afterwards tranſlated into Engliſh. He died in 1724. By his wife Alice, daughter of William Cooper, <abbr>eſq</abbr> he had three ſons; 1. William <note n="‡" place="bottom">I have a number of this gentleman's letters to Dr Z.

Dr John Bedford had alſo two daughters: Elizabeth died ſingle in Auguſt 1765: The other, Alice, (born in 1748) was married in 1766, to — Hall, <abbr>eſq</abbr> of Durham, and is now a widow.</p>

Originally part of the poſſeſſions of the biſhop, it was obtained in exchange by prior Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram, for Moorhouſe; who, having a deſire for a rural retreat for himſelf and ſucceſſors, in this place erected a camera or lodge, with a chapel. Prior Hugh, of Darlington, who ſucceeded him at the diſtance of about fourſcore years, in biſhop Stichill's time, encloſed the park; it is alſo ſaid by the monkiſh writers, he built a camera here, which we may conceive implies he added to or improved prior Bertram's erections. Whilſt biſhop Bek perſecuted the convent, he broke down the fences of the park, and drove out the game. In the reign of king Edward II. the Scotch, among other depredations committed in the environs of the city, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged and defaced this beautiful retreat.

place; to him we may attribute part of the embelliſhments, for the architecture of the chapel points out the improvements of a refined age; and as he acceded to his office in 1342, it may be preſumed he reſtored Beaurepaire after the deſtroying hand of the Scots, in 1346, when David Bruce, as Camden ſays, <hi>ferro &amp; flamma foeviſſet.</hi> As authors are ſilent touching Beaurepaire from this period, it is probable nothing material happened to it till the diſſolution. The manor, with the houſe and park, were part of the poſſeſſions of the monaſtery, reſtored by the king's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment, after the inſtitution of the dean and chapter.</p>
                  <p>In the time of dean Granville, who was inſtituted in 1684, an inquiſition was taken of the deanry poſſeſſions, in which we find Beaurepaire thus deſcribed: "<hi>Proe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter domos ſive aedificia apud Dun. fuit &amp; eſt ſpectan. ad decan. decanat.

The walls of the chapel in the inſide are ornamented with a regular ſucceſſion of ſmall round columns or pilaſters, belted in the midſt, the capitals filled with a garland of open cut foliage, of a delicate work; from whence ſpring pointed arches, three pilaſters and two arches in each ſpace between the windows: The weſt end is equally finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pilaſters and arches; and there is a ſmall window in the center: At each ſide of the eaſt window is a pedeſtal, for a ſtatue, of conſiderable ſize. The apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the chapel is lighted by ſmall ſquare windows; but as the floor of the chapel is gone, it is not eaſy to determine how it was conſtructed. Adjoining to the chapel on the weſt is a long building, the two gabels of which are ſtanding, having a large window of ſix lights to the ſouth: This was moſt probably the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectory.

victory) lay at Beaurepaire. In the Chronique of William de Pakington, it is thus ſpoken of: <q>About this tyme, by the meane of Philip Valoys, king of France, David, king of Scottes enterid yn to the north marches, ſpoiling and burning, and toke by force the pyle of Lydelle, and cauſid the noble knight Walter Selby captayne of it, to be ſlayne afore his owne face, not ſuffering him ſo much as to be confeſſed. And after he cam to the coſte of Dyrham, and lay there at a place caullid Beaurepaire, a manor of the prior of Dureſme, ſet in a parke; and thither reſorted many of the cuntery aboute, compounding with hym to ſpare their groundes and manurs. Then William Souch, archebiſhop of York, the counte of Anegos, Mounſeir John de Montbraye, Mounſeir Henry de Percy, Mounſeir Rafe de Neville, Mounſeir Rafe de Haſtinges, Mounſeir Thomas de Rokeby, then ſheriff of Yorkſhire, and other knightes and good men of the northe, marchid toward the Scottes, and firſt lay yn Akeland park, and in the morning encounterid with Syr William Duglas, killing of his band 200 menne; and he, with much payne, eſcapid to Burepaire, to king David, declaring the cuming of the Engliſh hoſt. Wher then king David iſſued, and faught upon a more nere to Dureſme toune, and there was taken priſoner, and with hym Syr Wylliam Douglas, the Counte of Menethe, and the Counte of Fyfe, and greate numbre of the communes of Scotland ſlayn. The king, becauſe he was wondid in the face, he was caried to Werk, and there he lyd, and thens brought to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</q> We have repeated this account becauſe it contains ſome circumſtances not named by modern authors. The year in which this battle was fought, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of the moſt glorious laurels that wreathed the ſword of Edward III. and the Scotch received ſuch humiliations as that nation never before experienced.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0782100202:355"/>
The king of England, with an army greatly inferior to his foes, by the valour and intrepid conduct of his heroic ſon, obtained a glorious victory at Creſſy. He then formed a blockade before Calais, which, with other diſtreſſes, induced the king of France to ſend propoſals to the court of Scotland, for making an invaſion on the borders: The abſence of Edward, the vaſt ſupplies of men and money which his campaign required, the exhauſted ſtate of England, afforded a probable appearance that David's projected expedition might be attended with ſucceſs: The king of France's object was not honour to the Scotch crown, but to amuſe the king of England, or draw off ſome of his forces: A conſiderable ſum of money and rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of troops were ſent into Scotland, and the king, with the aſſent of his parliament aſſembled at Perth, engaged in the expedition. Edward having enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained doubts, that during his abſence a ſtorm would be gathering on the brow of his known adverſary, diſpatched meſſengers to the court of Scotland, to amuſe by offers of a reſtitution of Berwick, on condition that the Scotch would ſtand neuter in the conflicts between England and France; but contrary to the opinion of many of his moſt ſkilful peers, David rejected the propoſed terms of amity, and prepared to invade England: He collected a powerful army, conſiſting, according to Rapin, of 30,000 men; other authors, particularly Froiſſart, Speed, Barnes, and Knighton greatly exaggerate the numbers; with theſe, in the beginning of October, 1346, David entered England by the weſtern march, ſhewing tokens of a bloody and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage mind in his outſet, by putting the garriſon of Liddell tower to the ſword, and marking his progreſs through Cumberland with wanton ſlaughter and deſolation. He advanced to the county of Durham, and approached the city. The queen of England ſummoned the prelates and military tenants to attend her at York, where meaſures were concerted for oppoſing the invaders, and a body of troops, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to about 16,000 men, were aſſembled with all ſpeed; whilſt David, with his army, lay at Beaurepaire, the aſſociate lords encamped in Auckland park. Douglas, with a choſen troop, reconnoitering the Engliſh, was engaged near Merrington; his detachment was put to the rout, and he eſcaped to the king with much peril. Rapin tells us, the queen of England led the Engliſh forces to battle; but that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is not ſupported by any cotemporary writer of credit: David looked upon his adverſaries as a raw and undiſciplined army, not able to ſtand againſt his hardy veterans, and ſhewed ſigns of great impatience before the troops engaged, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming that victory was certain, and that the riches of the city were due to his plundering ſoldiers: The Engliſh army was drawn up in four diviſions; lord Henry Percy commanded the firſt, ſupported by the earl of Angus, the biſhop of Durham, and ſeveral northern nobles; the ſecond body was led by the archbiſhop of York, accompanied by the biſhop of Carliſle, and the lords Nevill and Haſtings; the biſhop of Lincoln, the lord Mowbray, and Sir Thomas Rokeſby led the third di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; and at the head of the fourth was Edward Baliol, ſupported by the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury, the lord Roos, and the ſheriff of Northumberland: Each diviſion conſiſted of four thouſand men, and the archers and men at arms were diſtributed through the whole corps: The author of the Border Hiſtory, probably from his own conjecture, for he quotes no authority, alledges <q>That beſides the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0782100202:356"/>
forces above named, a ſtrong and gallant party under the lords Deincourt and Ogle, guarded queen Philippa, who, in the morning before the battle, having rode along the ranks, and exhorted every man to do his duty, to maintain the honour of his king and country, and take revenge upon their barbarous inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, recommended her people to the protection of God, and retired to a ſmall diſtance from the place of action.</q> The Scotch army was drawn out in three diviſions; the firſt was led by the high ſteward of Scotland, and the earl of March; the earl of Murray and lord Douglas commanded the ſecond; and the third, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of choice troops, in which were incorporated the flower of the Scottiſh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and gentry, ſuſtained by the French auxiliaries, was commanded by the king in perſon. With much heroic ardour the Scotch king ordered the trumpets to ſound the charge: The high ſteward, who led the van, being ſore galled by the Engliſh archers, ruſhed on with ſuch impetuous fury, that he threw them into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and drove them back on lord Henry Percy's diviſion; and the Scotch puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on vigorouſly with their broad ſwords and battle axes, broke them ſo much, that if relief had not inſtantly been ſent them, they would have been put to the rout; but Baliol, ruſhing in with a body of horſe, threw the Scotch battalion into confuſion, and gave the Engliſh time to rally and regain their ground, whilſt the high ſteward was obliged to retreat and reform his diſtracted array: In this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeuvre he is ſaid to have ſhewn great generalſhip, performing the evolutions in a maſterly manner, and with little loſs. Baliol, with equal ſkill, gave his troops breath, made no purſuit, and when leaſt ſuſpected, rapidly charged the king's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion in flank, whilſt they fought man to man in front: Unrelieved, and diſtreſſed with this complicated battle, the king fought deſperately, repeatedly bringing back his flying troops to the charge, encouraging them by his example, his exhortations and prayers: Aſhamed to deſert their prince in ſuch jeopardy, a brave phalanx threw themſelves around him, and fought till their numbers were reduced to little more than eighty: In this deſperate ſtate, and bleeding with many wounds, David ſcorned to aſk for quarter, hoping he ſhould ſtill be relieved, At length reſiſtance was vain, a tumultuous multitude, with ſhouts of victory, ruſhed upon him; and he at length was made priſoner to John Copeland, a Northumbrian eſquire. The diviſion under Douglas and Murray, ſtruck with a panic at the fate of the royal legion, and overpowered with numbers, were ſoon broken and routed: Murray died on the field, and Douglas was made priſoner, and few of the inferior officers eſcaped the ſword. <q>The Scotch king, though he had two ſpears hanging in his body, his leg deſperately wounded, and being diſarmed, his ſword having been beat out of his hand, diſdained captivity, and provoked the Engliſh by opprobious language to kill him: When John Copeland, who was governor of Roxborough caſtle, adviſed him to yield, he ſtruck him on the face with his gauntlet ſo fiercely, that he knocked out two of his teeth: Copeland conveyed him out of the field as his priſoner. Upon Copeland's refuſing to deliver him up (his royal captive) to the queen, who ſtayed at Newcaſtle during the battle, the king ſent for him to Calais, where he excuſed his refuſal ſo handſomely, that the king ſent him back a reward of 500l. a year in lands, where he himſelf ſhould chuſe it, near his own

dwelling, and made him a knight banneret<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer's Foed. tom. v. p. 542.—Froiſart, l. 1. p. 140.—Rapin, p. 425.</note>.</q> This battle was fought on the 17th of October, 1346, and laſted only three hours, beginning at nine in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the victory being declared by ſound of trumpet at noon: The loſs of the enemy was eſtimated at 15,000, the chief of whom were the earls of Murray and Strathern, the lord conſtable David Hay, the lord marſhal Edward Keith, together with the lords chancellors and chamberlain of Scotland, the lords Philip Meldrum, John Stewart, and Alan Stewart his brother, ſir Alexander Bothwell, the king's ſtandard bearer, ſir Alexander Ramſay, and others of high rank. Among the priſoners were the earls of Fife, Sutherland, Monteith, Carrick, and Wigton, the lord Douglas, the biſhops of St Andrew and Aberdeen, James Douglas, ſir Malcolm Fleming, with many men of diſtinction. Hiſtorians have not mentioned what particular loſs was ſuſtained on the part of the Engliſh. Knighton tells us of four knights and five eſquires only, who fell in the field; and Dugdale ſays the lord Haſtings was mortally wounded: But in ſo bloody a battle it is impoſſible but many men of diſtinction would fall in the Engliſh army.</p>
                  <p>The ground where this battle was fought is hilly, and in many parts very ſteep, towards the river, ſo that it is not poſſible to conceive how ſuch an armament could be arranged and engage in any order. The account given of this battle, and of the ſubſequent tranſactions of the convent, by the writers of that houſe, as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Davies, and contained in Sir John Lawſon's MSS. and Mr Hogg's Roll, is to the effect given in the notes<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <p>In the night before the battle of Durham, there appeared to John Foſſour, then prior of the abbey of Durham, a viſion, commanding him to take the holy corporax cloth, wherewith St Cuthbert covered the chalice when he uſed to ſay maſs, and to put the ſame upon a ſpear point, and next morning to repair to a place on the weſt of the city of Durham, called the Red Hills, and there to remain till the end of the battle.— The prior and monks, accompanied with Ralph lord Nevil, and John Nevil his ſon, lord Percy, and many other nobles, returned to the abbey church, there joining in prayer and thankſgiving to God, and holy St Cuthbert, for the conqueſt obtained that day: In which battle a holy croſs, taken out of Holy Rood Houſe, in Scotland, by king David Bruce, was taken from the ſaid king; which croſs is recorded, by ancient and credible writers, to have come to the ſaid king moſt miraculouſly: Being hunting the hart in a foreſt near Edinburgh, upon Holy Rood day. In the place where this miracle was wrought, now ſprings a fountain, called the Rood well. The night after he was warned in his ſleep to build an abbey in the ſame place.— Many excellent jewels and monuments brought from Scotland, and noblemen's banners, were offered to the ſhrine of St Cuthbert; together with the black rood of Scotland.</p>
                        <p>The banner cloth was a yard broad, and five quarters deep, the bottom was indented in five parts, and fringed, and made faſt all about with red ſilk and gold. It was made of red velvet, on both ſides em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with flowers of green ſilk and gold; and in the midſt was the ſaid corporax cloth incloſed, covered over with white velvet, half a yard ſquare every way, having a croſs of red velvet on both ſides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fringed about the edge and ſkirts with red ſilk and gold, and three fine little ſilver bells faſtened to the ſkirts of the ſaid banner cloth, like unto ſacring bells.</p>
                        <p>On the weſt ſide of the city of Durham, where two roads paſs each other, a moſt famous and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant croſs of ſtone work was erected to the honour of God, for the victory there obtained, known by the name of Nevil's croſs, and built at the ſole coſt of lord Ralph Nevil; which croſs had ſeven ſteps about it, every way ſquared, to the ſocket wherein the ſtalk of the croſs ſtood, which ſocket was faſtened to a large ſquare ſtone, the ſole or bottom ſtone being of a great thickneſs, viz. a yard and a half every way: This ſtone was the eighth ſtep. The ſtalk of the croſs was in length three yards and a half up to the boſs, having eight ſides all of one piece; from the ſocket it was fixed into the boſs above, into which boſs the ſtalk was deeply ſoldered with lead. In the midſt of the ſtalk, in every ſecond ſquare, was the Nevil's croſs: A ſaltire, in a 'ſcutcheon, being lord Nevil's arms, finely cut; and at every corner of the ſocket was a picture of one of the four evangeliſts, finely ſet forth and carved. The boſs at the top of the ſtalk was an octangular ſtone, finely cut and bordered, and moſt curiouſly wrought; and in every ſquare of the nether ſide thereof was Nevil's croſs, in one ſquare, and the bull's head in the next, ſo in the ſame reciprocal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der about the boſs. On the top of the boſs was a ſtalk of ſtone, (being a croſs a little higher than the reſt) whereon was cut, on both ſides of the ſtalk of the ſaid croſs, the picture of our Saviour Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified; the picture of the Bleſſed Virgin on one ſide, and of St John the Evangeliſt on the other, both ſtanding on the top of the boſs. All which pictures were moſt artificially wrought together, and finely carved out of one entire ſtone, ſome parts thereof through carved work, both on the eaſt and weſt ſides of the croſs, with a cover of ſtone likewiſe over their heads, being all moſt finely and curiouſly wrought together out of the ſaid hollow ſtone; which cover of ſtone was covered over. It remained till the year 1589, when the ſame was broken down and defaced by ſome lewd and wicked perſons.</p>

The ſouth front of the church is disfigured by a deep porch of fifteen feet: There is an aile on each ſide of the nave, formed by two rows of three beautiful round pillars ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently proportioned, ſupporting pointed arches, carved with the zig-zag figure; the nave is about forty-five feet in length, and twenty in width, lighted on each ſide by four upper windows, of two lights each, ſquare topt; the ailes exceed the length of the nave ſome few feet, and are not of equal widths, the ſouth aile being about nineteen feet wide, and the north only fifteen, lighted by three regular windows ſimilar in form to thoſe above, and a window at the eaſt end, having a pointed arch: In painted glaſs in this window is a coat of arms, impaling Tempeſt, and under an arch in the ſide wall of this aile is the recumbent effigy of an eccleſiaſtic with his hands elevated, claſping a chalice, well cut in black marble <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>We are inclined to believe this is the tomb of Stephen Auſtell, one of the deans, who died 27 Feb. 1461. The marble of the tomb is of that ſort won near Stanhope, in this county.</p>

               <p>Lancheſter appears to have decreaſed greatly of late years, and now is a mere ſtragling village, placed in a warm and well-ſheltered valley, with a fine ſtream of water, called Smallhop Burn, running through it. The ſcite of the old deanry-houſe encloſed with a moat remains, but no edifice: Several fertile incloſures ſkirt the town, and the improvement of land advances rapidly.</p>
               <p>At the diſtance of a quarter of a mile, on an eminence towards the weſt, are the remains of the great Roman ſtation, which Camden called <hi>Longovicus.</hi> Dr Gale, in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 357, calls it the <hi>Caſtra Stativa,</hi> where the ſoldiers were quartered in time of peace.</p>

                  <q>Mr Horſley ſuppoſes <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Horſley's Britan. Rom. p. 450, 451.</p>
                        <p>Mr Camden was of opinion that Lancheſter was the Roman <hi>Longovicum,</hi> and by what Dr Hunter hath written to the Royal Society about it, we have reaſon to reſt in that conjecture; for he ſays, that ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions have been dug up there, and the Roman ſtreet called <hi>Watling ſtreet</hi> lies through it. It is ſeated on the top of a hill, and overlooked by another. By the ruins we may diſcern it has been a much larger place, in a ſquare form, and fortified with a thick ſtrong ſtone wall, about which now both within and without are nothing but ruins and rubbiſh. It is probable that the buildings within the walls were all public, viz. temples, palaces, and ſtations for the ſoldiers, and perhaps lodgings for the garriſon. No doubt this colony was adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many beautiful buildings. The inſcriptions found here ſince Mr Camden's time are as follows.</p>
                        <p>N. B. <hi>They are all noted in the following extracts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When I was laſt there I looked at the pillars which had ſupported the floors of what is ſuppoſed to have been a balneum They were not all alike, nor of a very regular figure, but yet there was ſome ſimilitude and proportion between them; they are all about two feet and five inches high, perhaps two Roman feet and a half. The angles or corners of four ſquare ſtones reſted on each of theſe pillars, and between each, two pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars was more than a yard diſtance. Upon the ſquare ſtones had been a plaiſtering about four inches thick,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0782100202:375"/>conſiſting of lime and ſmall pieces of brick. The marks of fire and ſmoke were very viſible when they firſt diſcovered the place. I was alſo informed that there was another ſet of pillars underneath, which ſupported another ſuch floor, and ſome ſort of metal upon it, on which the upper ſet of pillars reſted. The lower pillars ſtood upon a blue clay, and the intervals between them were filled up with earth and rubbiſh. It was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that the firſt had failed or been deſtroyed, and that the ſecond had been built on its ruins. Above this (according to the account I had, for there are no remains of it now) was a ſquare room, having each ſide about four yards long, and the walls plaiſtered in the ſame manner, and with the ſame materials as the floor. The altar hereafter deſcribed was found at the eaſt end of this room, with its back undreſſed towards the wall. I have been more particular in this deſcription becauſe it has not been ſufficiently given before; but the other remains and monuments here I ſhall alſo largely deſcribe.</p>
                        <p>There is a very conſiderable tumulus about a mile from Lancheſter, called the <hi>Maiden Law,</hi> and probably the military way has not been far from this tumulus.</p>
                        <p>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2, plate. <hi>Imperator Caeſar, Marcus, Antonius, Gordianus pius felix Auguſtus Balneum cum Baſilica, a ſolo inſtruxit per Gneium Lucilianum legatum Auguſtalem Propraetorem curante Marco Aurelio Quirino praefecto Cobor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis primae Legionis Gordianae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This and the next are two curious and uſeful inſcriptions, which, with moſt of the following, were made public in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 266, 354, from Dr Hunter, and have moſt of them been inſerted in Camden. The originals are now in the library at Durham. Mr Gale thinks, that the <hi>Legio</hi> here called <hi>Gordiana,</hi> was the <hi>legio ſexta victrix,</hi> which continued ſo long in the north, and had its ſtated quarters at York, whilſt the other legions had their's at a much greater diſtance. Yet we have an inſcription at this very place by the leg. xxvv. which was employed not far from hence in building or repairing ſome ſtructure, as appears from the inſcription at Whitley caſtle, in Northumberland. Theſe inſcriptions are valuable, as they have preſerved to us the names of two propraetors, which otherwiſe muſt have been loſt. For as Mr Gale ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, from <hi>Virius Lupus,</hi> who was propraetor under Severus in the year 208, to <hi>Nonnius Phillippus,</hi> (whom he believes to have ſucceeded the latter of theſe here mentioned) to the year 242, the name of no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praetor or legate is any where elſe to be met with. It is highly probable that the two here mentioned imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſucceed one another, becauſe both inſcriptions were erected not only under the ſame emperor, but under the ſame commander of the cohort <hi>Aurelius Quirinus,</hi> who had the care of both theſe works. This, as Dr Hunter informs us, was found about one hundred yards caſt of the fort, the other within the ſort, which confirms Mr Gale's opinion, that the ſoldiers lodged within the ſort. The <hi>Baſaliacae</hi> of the ancients were public buildings, in which cauſes were heard, and merchants met for buſineſs; they were adorned with pillars and covered walks: Vitruvius has given a deſcription of them, and ſo has Palladio from him. This ſtone is broke through the middle, and ſome of the letters are damaged or loſt, but it is eaſy to ſupply them. And this inſcription ſeems rather to be worſe cut, and to be the later of the two. As for the <hi>pre</hi> for <hi>per</hi> and <hi>Gn.</hi> for <hi>Gneium</hi> in the fourth line, it would be eaſy to produce other parallel inſtances, as alſo of <hi>L</hi> for <hi>Legionis.</hi> But Mr Ward is inclined to think <q>that <hi>pre</hi> at the beginning of the fourth line was not deſigned for <hi>per,</hi> and that the following word ſhould not be read <hi>Gneium,</hi> but <hi>Egnatium,</hi> a name that frequently occurs in Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. His reaſon for reading it thus is, that in all ſuch mixtures of ſmaller letters againſt the middle of lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the ſame word, the word always begins with a letter of the larger ſize; and as for the <hi>E</hi> he imagines it was not intended to ſerve both words by being read twice, becauſe in ſuch caſes, which are very rare, the letter to be repeated is always found in a complex character. He ſuppoſes, therefore, that there has either been a ſmall <hi>e</hi> between <hi>PR,</hi> which is now defaced, or that it was deſigned to be put there, but was forgot, as it eaſily might be.</q>—<bibl>

                        <p>So much has been ſaid already concerning this inſcription, under the former and another in Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that little more need be added here; it may not be amiſs to obſerve, that the Emperor's name is here at length <hi>Antonius,</hi> as it is printed alſo in the <hi>Faſti Conſulares.</hi> We have likewiſe ſome other inſtances of it in Montſaucon. Mr Gale ſays, that the <hi>armamentaria</hi> ſignify the arſenal, and <hi>principia</hi> the quarters either of the legionary ſoldiers, called the Principes, or the place where the enſigns are kept. But from a paſſage in Tacitus, one would rather conclude the latter to be the general's pavilion.—<bibl>See Gordon's Itin. Add. p. 14, and Horſley, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 12, p. 290.</bibl>

                        <p>I know not what cohort Publius Aelius Atticus commanded who erected this altar. The word <hi>Praefectus,</hi> without any thing following, is not uncommon in inſcriptions. The perſon where I lodged at Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter told me that this altar was found at the eaſt end of a ſquare room, which they diſcovered within the ſtation, and the back of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar is undreſſed.

                        <p>Mr Horſley's correſpondent had furniſhed him with a very inaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate drawing; the cut was made from the original in the dean and chapter's library, in April 1776.

                        </p>
                        <p>This ſtone looks like a pedeſtal, and ſeems by its regular ſquare cavity at the top to have had ſomething fixed upon it, but it is nothing like the baſe of an altar. The letters are tolerably well cut. I at firſt was doubtful if the firſt line might have been <hi>Genio Praetoris,</hi> but upon examining the original, I ſaw every letter very plain, and was convinced that there neither was nor ever had been an <hi>S</hi> at the end. I then thought it might be a flattering compliment to the un-named praetor, as if he was their genius or tutelar god. But my learned friend Mr Ward, judges this too high a compliment to be paid by a tribune to a praetor, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that <hi>Genius</hi> is a proper name frequent in Gruter. It is therefore my preſent opinion, that this ſtone has ſuſtained ſome pillar, or ſomewhat of that nature; and that the monument has been erected to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Genius the praetor.</hi> If we read <hi>votum poſuit,</hi> the word <hi>votum</hi> muſt by a trope be taken here for the thing vowed, as upon another inſcription we have <hi>memoriam poſuit</hi> for <hi>monumentum;</hi> and upon another <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum fecit,</hi> which expreſſion in the common ſenſe is not to pay a vow, but to make it. And thus Virgil ſeems to have uſed the word <hi>votum,</hi> when he ſays

The cut of the letters, particularly the <hi>G,</hi> looks like the lower empire; but I know no evidence whereby the particular emperor can be determined with any great probability. We have ſeveral other altars at this place, inſcribed alſo to Mars, which have been taken notice of before. I have only to add, that according to Dr Hunter's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in his letter to me, <q>This plate was found in the year 1716, in a heap of rubbiſh caſt out to clear an old foundation without the fortification of the garriſon, a little ſouth from the balneum.</q> It is now in the chapter library at Durham.—<bibl>

Mr Ward ſuppoſes this altar might be erected to the god <hi>Vitires,</hi> and that the letters <hi>Vit</hi> were upon the firſt line, as we find them before; the ſecond line is plainly <hi>votum,</hi> and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing letters upon the third line he thinks may be part of <hi>Solvit.</hi> This conjecture is favoured by another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this county upon an altar dedicated to this deity, which has a boar upon one ſide: But I think it more likely that the latter part of the inſcription has been the name of the perſon erecting the altar: The laſt letters are obſcure and doubtful.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe before mentioned, which are not at Durham, there are ſome curioſities remaining yet in the ſtation or town, and among the reſt a large ſtone almoſt like a mortar.

                        <p>This ſmall altar was in a ſtone wall incloſing a field called Broomlawe near the ſtation, belonging to Mr Rowland Wilkinſon, but I have now got it into my own poſſeſſion. The inſcription has ſuffered very much by the weather. The remains of it look like <hi>Deo Marti;</hi> but it cannot now inform us by whom it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, though the laſt viſible letters look like Acilius, a common Roman name, and which, I think, occurs in another of our inſcriptions.—<bibl>

                        <p>The capital of this altar and a ſmall part of the inſcription is broken off and loſt, and the want of it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſome difficulty as to the reading. When I firſt ſaw this ſtone it was built up in the wall of an incloſure. I viewed it ſeveral times in this ſituation, but then nothing appearing but the imperfect Greek inſcription, the oppoſite part of the ſtone being entirely under cover, and built up within the wall. At firſt view I concluded it to be Greek, but could diſcover no ſatisfactory reading. When I had purchaſed the ſtone, and got it into
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0782100202:378"/>my own poſſeſſion, I was much ſurpriſed to ſee a Latin inſcription on the oppoſite part of the altar. Which is the face and which the back of this altar, or whether like <hi>Janus bifrous,</hi> it was deſigned to be double faced, I ſhall not pretend to determine. However to have inſcriptions both before and behind is a ſingular curioſity, of which I remember no parallel inſtance in Britain, unleſs the beautiful altar in Camberland be taken for ſuch. But to have two ſuch inſcriptions in two different languages is yet more remarkable. Some ſuſpect the Greek inſcription not to be genuine, or that it has been added by a different hand and at a different time from the Latin. But I ſee no juſt reaſon to entertain this ſuſpicion, becauſe I cannot diſcern by whom or with what view it could have been added. So little was this altar regarded or valued, that according to the uſual fate of ſuch monuments, it was uſed as a common ſtone in the wall.</p>
                        <p>The high prices of curious Roman coins have produced a great many forgeries, contrived very artfully; but the little regard that has been had for monuments of ſtone, renders us more ſecure of their being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther genuine. But to return from this digreſſion; the ſight of the Latin inſcription enabled me to read the remains of the Greek one, I humbly think, with great probability; for I take the greateſt part of the one to be much the ſame with the other, excepting the different language and character. I ſhall therefore ſpeak to the Latin inſcription as being more eaſy and perfect.—<bibl>

                        </p>
                        <p>It appears plainly from this, that the altar has been erected by one <hi>Titus Flavius Titianus,</hi> a tribune, but no cohort is mentioned which he commanded. There are ſeveral conſuls of the name <hi>Titianus,</hi> but the other name are different from that of our tribune. <hi>Tiberius Fabius Titianus</hi> appears five times in the Faſti, and at ſuch a diſtance of time as to make it probable they were five different perſons. This made me ſuſpicious that the <hi>T</hi> in our inſcriptions was to be read <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and that the following name might be <hi>Fabius.</hi> But the <hi>Fl</hi> are ſo diſtinct on the ſtone as to leave no room for a doubt. I find <hi>Poſtumius Titianus</hi> was conſul in the year 301, in the time of Diocletian and Maximian. And Almeloveen conjectures, that this may be the ſame with one who is called in Gruter <hi>T. Fl. Poſtumius Titianus.</hi> This comes neareſt the names of our tribune, but there is no arguing from hence with any probability that theſe two <hi>Titiani</hi> lived at or near the ſame time. But thus much for the perſon erecting this altar; the principal queſtion is, to whom it has been inſcribed? We have little to guide us in this but the letters <hi>Pio</hi> at the top, which are certain and diſtinct. I thought of <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> and other emperors, to whom living or dead, and deified, this epithet <hi>Pius</hi> has been applied, ſuch as <hi>Divo Conſtantio Pio</hi> and others. Baron Clerk was ſo obliging as to ſend me ſeveral conjectures about this Latin inſcription, a copy of which I tranſmitted to him. Among other things, this very learned anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary ſuppoſes, that <hi>Pio</hi> may be a part of <hi>Aeſculapio:</hi> This conjecture is more agreeable and ſatisfactory than any thing that has occurred to myſelf, or been offered by any other. I think by the proportion of the altar, that there is not above one line of the inſcription wanting, which might be filled up with <hi>Aeſcula,</hi> or with <hi>Deo Aeſcula.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the Greek inſcription, I believe it has ſtood thus when entire,

                        <p>I obſerve, that there are five lines in the Greek inſcription, and but four remaining in the Latin, and that the ſtone is rather higher on the ſide of the Greek inſcription than the other. This induces me to think that the imperfect remains at the top have been a part of the firſt line of this inſcription. I need ſay nothing to ſhew how ſuitable this reading is to the remains on the ſtone, and to the Latin inſcription on the other ſide. Both the one and the other, I think, appear at firſt ſight. That there were ſome here in this part of the iſland, who were willing to pay regard to the gods who preſided over health and recovery, appears from the ſculpture at Riſingham, in Northumberland. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </p>
                        <p>When I firſt ſaw this ſtone it was in the corner of a cloſe belonging to Nicholas Greenwell, not far from the former; the upper part was broken off and built up in the wall, and the inſcription covered, but upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving it out of the wall, and comparing the two parts together. I perceived they had been originally united. I have ſince this got both the pieces into my poſſeſſion, and ſo have had an opportunity of placing them one upon another. When this was done they tallied with ſo much exactneſs as to render it abſolutely certain that they have originally made up one and the ſame altar. This altar is inſcribed to <hi>Jupiter optimus maximus,</hi> and has been erected, as I take, by the vexillation of an Equeſtrian cohort, of the <hi>Varduli Cranei,</hi> people of Spain. The firſt word in the ſecond line muſt, I think, have been <hi>Vexillatio,</hi> and the <hi>o</hi> perhaps has been a little one, and added near the top of the <hi>I,</hi> as we ſometimes find it. I once thought I diſcerned it there, but own myſelf jealous that my imagination aſſiſted my eye ſight. The next word is plainly <hi>Cohors,</hi> but who the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been of which this cohort conſiſted muſt be more diſtinctly conſidered. When I firſt viewed the two pieces as they lay ſeparate, I read the name <hi>Vardiorum.</hi> Theſe are a people of Dalmatia, mentioned with ſome variation of the name by Strabo, Pliny, and Ptolomy, but ſince I got them home and put them together, I have found that by the largeneſs of the interval there muſt have been two letters between the <hi>D</hi> and <hi>O</hi> in the third line. I have alſo diſcovered the ſure remains of a <hi>V</hi> after the <hi>D</hi> beſides the imperfect letter before the <hi>O,</hi> I make no doubt therefore but the name is <hi>Vardulorum.</hi> The two firſt letters in the fourth line of which there are any remains, ſeem plainly to have been <hi>CR,</hi> which I would have concluded to have been the initial letters of the name <hi>Cranei,</hi> and to have been read <hi>Vardulorum, Craneorum,</hi> or <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> Craneorum</hi> if my firſt conjecture concerning <hi>Craneis</hi> in the Richeſter inſcription could have been ſupported: But that being rejected, I am more at a loſs for any probable reading of this part of the inſcription now before us. I would gladly ſtill make uſe of the one as a key to the other. And therefore if <hi>Conſecraneis</hi> be read in the former, I am moſt inclined to ſuppoſe <hi>CR</hi> to be ſome part of an abbreviation of the ſame word in this. Poſſibly it has been <hi>CSCR,</hi> which ſupply ſeems not unſuitable to the vacant ſpace on the ſtone, and perhaps <hi>ET</hi> has been at the end of the preceding line in letters of the ſame ſize; thus it would be <hi>Fardulorum et Conſecraneorum</hi> in this as <hi>Vardulorum cum Conſecraneis</hi> in the other. <hi>EQ</hi> in this fourth line is no doubt for <hi>Equeſtris</hi> or <hi>Equitum.</hi> The character at the end of this line is much the ſame with an <hi>M</hi> that is uſed for <hi>Mille</hi> in one of the inſcriptions of Glaſgow, but that it here ſignifies 1000 horſe is more than I dare venture to affirm.

                              <p>I confeſs your letter has ſhocked my aſſurance, though I ſtill hope my conjecture will not be quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. <hi>Gravij, Graij,</hi> or <hi>Granij,</hi> as I think it is ſometimes written, are people not far from the <hi>Varduli,</hi> mentioned by Pliny and others. Theſe were the people I meant and thought of. The change from <hi>Granei</hi> to <hi>Cranei</hi> is very eaſy, the word <hi>conſecranei</hi> no where occurs in inſcriptions, and no evidence of its being uſed till after the time of this inſcription: But I only ſend this to beg excuſe for the delay, till I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, when I ſhall examine the Riecheſter ſtone.</p>

                              <p>I have had the happineſs to meet with theſe two altars found lately at Lancheſter, in the Roman ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the firſt within the ancient fortification, having its bottom broken off, and the initial letters of the laſt two lines.

                              </p>
                              <p>Theſe, with two portable altars, without any inſcriptions, and a figure of Ceres, are preſented to the worſhipful James Clavering, <abbr>eſq</abbr> who, in reſpect to ſuch valuable antiquities, intends to entertain them in the avenues of his beautiful garden at Greencroft, about a mile diſtant from Lancheſter.</p>
                              <p>Pliny is the only author we can gather any thing from remarkable concerning the Varduli, and that ſo very conciſe, I think deſerves a place here. In conventum Clunienſem Varduli ducant populos xiv. ex quibus Albanenſes tantum nominare libeat. Nat. Hiſt. lib. iii. c. 3. ſect. 4, of the laſt Paris edition; and in lib. iv. c. 20, ſect. 34, he enumerates the <hi>Vardulorum Oppida, Moroſgi, Menoſca, Veſperies Amanum Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ubi nunc Flaviobriga Colonia,</hi> where Mr Hardoiun recites the modern names. And as Gruter's almoſt infinite collection affords no inſcription where the <hi>Varduli</hi> are named, I preſume the Roman oeconomy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the emperor Trajan, by deſcent a Spaniard, if not ſooner, had aboliſhed the old diſtinctions of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate governments, and reduced the whole province under one general name, Hiſpania, which afterwards the Notitia Imperij occidentalis divides into three conſular provinces, under the direction of four preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, viz. Farraconenis, Carthagineus Tingitania, Inſula Balearium, and places no garriſon of the Varduli in any fortreſs in the eaſtern or weſtern empire.</p>
                              <p>The inſcription upon the firſt is cut very fair. In comparing my copy with Mr Horſley's altar, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 26, Durham, belonging alſo to Lancheſter, which is at preſent in the dean and chapter's library here, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a difference between the firſt letter of the fourth line, where <hi>C</hi> is very apparent: If my copy is true, I hope my reading may be allowed. The figure I call a Ceres is well cut; the left hand leaning upon a globe, which I take to be a <hi>Lapis Molaris,</hi> prompts me to term it ſo. One of the ſmall altars has a toad upon the ſide, the ſame as one of the three mentioned by Mr Horſley in our library.</p>

                              <p>As for the two inſcriptions you ſent me, I will venture to give my thoughts upon them, &amp;c. The firſt of them is very curious, as it gives us the name of a <hi>Legatus Auguſtalis</hi> and propraetor hitherto unknown in Britain, and which ought, as I think, to be read as follows, <hi>Numini Auguſti &amp; genio cohortis ſecundae Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulorum
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0782100202:381"/>Equitate Milliariae ſub Antiſtio advento, Legato Auguſti propraetore. F. Tiranus Tribunus dat dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que rite.</hi> To read <hi>GR</hi> in the fourth line, <hi>Gregalium,</hi> is not a little doubtful: It cannot well be ſuppoſed that the tribune of the cohort would dedicate an altar to the deity of the emperor, and at the ſame time to the genius of the common ſoldiers, excluſive of the genius of the officers, of which he himſelf was one; and how to read it otherwiſe is as uncertain, if the letters are <hi>GR,</hi> as in your copy. But if they are <hi>CR,</hi> as on the altar given us by Mr Horſley, Durham, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 26, in his Brit. Rom. and which you ſay has <hi>C</hi> very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent inſtead of <hi>G,</hi> they may denote <hi>civium Romanorum,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Varduli</hi> people of Spain, and admitted to the freedom of the city of Rome for ſome extraordinary merit, or by ſome emperor's ſavour, perhaps their countryman Trajan's. This was a privilege frequently conferred upon foreigners, even whole towns and nations, and at laſt communicated by Antoninus Pius <hi>omnibus in commune ſubjectis,</hi> by which it ſeems as if this altar had been erected before this general grant of that emperor; for it is no great honour or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for theſe <hi>Varduli</hi> to value themſelves upon, if they had enjoyed it only in common with all the reſt of the world. Monſ. Spanheim obſerves, <hi>Exercit. prima ad conſtitution. Imp. Antonini de civ. Rom. quod ſub. M. Antonino Imp. civitate donati eſſent quicunque in Romani orbis provinciis aut oppidis delecti eſſent milites ut praeſidarij in imperij limitibus conſtituerentur.</hi> This ſeems contradictory to the firſt mentioned grant, ſince it only confers the freedom of the city upon the ſoldiers in garriſon on the frontiers of the empire, and the other gives it to all the ſubjects of the Roman empire without exception. Perhaps the ſoldiers had this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage given them at firſt, and upon finding the encouragement it gave them to defend the countries where they were quartered, it was thought adviſeable to admit all the ſubjects of the empire to the ſame privilege, to intereſt them the more in preſerving the whole from the attacks of the barbarians: But there has been no ſmall uncertainty among the learned to which of the Antonins this conſtitution is owing, ſome attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting it to Antoninus Pius, others to Marcus Aurelius, and Mr Spanheim with great reaſon to Antoninus Caracalla, from Dion Caſſius chiefly, who tells us this privilege was granted to him <hi>omnibus qui in urbe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano erant,</hi> not ſo much for the honour and advantage of it to the people, as for the filling his treaſury, ſince it made them liable to the payment of ſeveral taxes, from which they were before exempted; ſo that the ſoldiers had this benefit conferred on them for their ſervices, and the reſt of the people afterwards moſt likely to drain their purſes. In Gruter's Theſaur. p. 455, 6, is mentioned <hi>Tantiſtius praefectus alae ſulpiciae C. R. i. e. Civium Romanorum:</hi> And in p. 459, 8, <hi>L. Praeſentius praefectus cob.</hi> 1. <hi>Afr. C. R.

                              <p>A <hi>cohors Equitata</hi> was compoſed partly of horſe, partly of foot, as Vegetius informs us, lib. ii. cha. 2. <hi>Prima cohors habet pedites mille centum &amp; quinque; Equites loricatos centum triginta duos et appellantur mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaria.</hi> I muſt own the cohors in this inſcription is called <hi>ſecunda Vardulorum,</hi> of which an inſcription was found at Riecheſter, in Northumberland.—[See Horſley's Brit. Rom. North. 94.] This ſecond <hi>cohors</hi> of the <hi>Varduli</hi> might however be the <hi>prima auxiliaria</hi> of ſome legion, perhaps the ſixth, and in more eſteem for ſome eminent ſervice or fortunate accident than the firſt, not dignified with the honourable title and privileges <hi>civium Romanorum,</hi> perhaps alſo independent of any legion. And after all, the ſole reaſon why one of the cohorts was called the firſt, and the other the ſecond, might have been from the priority of time when they were firſt raiſed. This <hi>Antiſtius Adventus</hi> ſeems alſo to have been <hi>Legatus Auguſti,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praetor in Belgium, from an altar found near Utrecht, where he is called <hi>Caius Antiſtius</hi> (vid.

                              <p>There were many barbarities in the language of the lower empire, and therefore it is hard to determine with any certainty about letters. I cannot approve of the doctor's <hi>Gregalium,</hi> though I believe he would be vaſtly ſond of it, and pleaſed with the invention. Your <hi>Civium Romanorum</hi> is certainly right, if the
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0782100202:382"/>letters be not <hi>G. R.</hi> for <hi>Germanicorum,</hi> for I have ſeen, if I remember right, ſome ſuch inſcription, though I cannot tell where. You will be ſurpriſed at my notion of <hi>Germanicorum,</hi> if I do not explain to you the reading of the altar ſo as to comprehend ſuch a word. If the letters are <hi>G. R.</hi> in the ſenſe I take them the reading muſt relate to the <hi>Cohors Milliaria</hi>
                                 <note n="*" place="bottom">
                                    <q>It is hard to conceive how <hi>Cohors Milliaria Germanicorum</hi> ſhould dedicate an altar <hi>Genio Cob. II.

                              <p>This muſt have been the figure of the goddeſs Fortune ſeated, the wheel that is by her ſide, and the cornucopia ſhe has in her left hand, and the globe at her foot on the other ſide, do all ſhew it to be Fortune, though one of her arms, as well as her head; be now broken off. There are ſeveral altars at Durham inſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Fortune; one found at Lancheſter inſcribed <hi>Fortunae Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſti;</hi> perhaps this has been the image of that Fortune; and by this image with the globe at her feet, may be expreſſed the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's univerſal dominion. The modern letters that are now cut on the baſe, may eaſily, at firſt view, deceive one into an opinion that the image is not Roman or antique; but this only ſhews when it was found, and by whom, namely in the year 1700, by Henry Ornſby, of Lancheſter, whoſe wife's name was Elizabeth. To diſguiſe this figure further, there ſtands on it a Mercury's head, as is plain from the petaſus, ſo that I look upon it as certain that the head and body have belonged to different figures, though now the one is generally ſet upon the other.— This image of Fortune I take to be the ſame with a figure in Mr Gordon, which I can find no where explained. He has made the proportion far too large for the reſt of the figures, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly had forgot the dimenſions.</p>

                        <p>This figure, about twenty-four inches in height, remains in the dean and chapter's library at Durham, and the proper head is to be ſeen there: The ſculpture is uncommonly good, and we prefer cutting the repreſentation from a drawing made in 1776, to a mere imitation of Mr. Horſley's plate.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>This repreſents a curious ſculpture which is on a ſtone built up in the veſtry wall of the church. It is much like that at Netherby, though there is ſome difference in the drapery, and here is no corona on the head, but only the hair plaited. I believe this to be a genius as well as the other, or at leaſt the emperor repreſented as ſuch.</q>

                     </note> the firſt name of this town has been <hi>Glancheſter,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as uſual of the firſt ſyllable of the old Roman name, with the word <hi>Cheſter</hi> annexed to it: The <hi>G,</hi> for the ſake of an eaſier pronunciation, might be dropt. If <hi>Glanoventa</hi> ſignifies a bank, or hill near a river, <hi>ven</hi> or <hi>vent</hi> in the Britiſh tongue ſignifying a river, the ſituation of the ſtation at Lancheſter is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to this etymology; for it ſtands on high ground, with a river on one ſide, and a rivulet on the other, and not far from either. I know two of our greateſt modern antiquaries, Roger Gale, <abbr>eſq</abbr> and Dr Hunter, of Durham, ſuppoſe Lancheſter to be the ancient <hi>Longovicus,</hi> the affinity of name having, as I preſume, inclined them to this opinion; but I have a pretty ſtrong reaſon to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0782100202:375"/>
offer why this cannot be the <hi>Longovicus</hi> in the Notitia, garriſoned by the <hi>Numerus Longovicariorum,</hi> which is this: It is evident that ſome order is obſerved in the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0782100202:376"/>
Notitia in ſetting down the ſeveral places, and <hi>Longovicus</hi> is ſet among the moſt ſoutherly that were under the <hi>Dux Britanniarum;</hi> it is put down as more to the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0782100202:377"/>
ſouth than <hi>Lavatrae</hi> or <hi>Verterae,</hi> and next to <hi>Derventio,</hi> all which are mentioned in the Notitia as well as the Itinerary; and this ſuits much better with the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0782100202:378"/>
of Lancaſter in Lancaſhire, than Lancheſter in the county of Durham; and as none of the military ways on which any of the itinera proceed ſeem to have
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0782100202:379"/>
paſſed by Lancheſter, ſo this may be a good reaſon why <hi>Longovicus</hi> is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Itinerary, though we have it in the Notitia. Upon the whole,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0782100202:380"/>
therefore, I ſee no place bids ſo fair to be the <hi>Glanoventa</hi> in the Itinerary as Lancheſter, eſpecially if we conſider how the reſt of the iter goes on when this foundation is laid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:0782100202:381"/>
                  <q>The ſtation and town have been ſituated on a lingula between the river Browney and the rivulet Smallup. This rivulet runs into the Browney a little
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0782100202:382"/>
below the ſtation, and Browney loſes itſelf and name in the river Were, at Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland bridge, two miles ſouth of Durham. The ſtation is two furlongs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from Smallup, and not ſo much from Browney. It has a high ſituation, and yet the proſpect is bounded quite round about with hills or riſing grounds,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0782100202:383"/>
that are not at a very great diſtance. The ſame ſort of ſituation is obſervable at Elſdon, in Northumberland, and ſeveral other places. This ſituation has this advantage, that an enemy could not come over theſe riſing grounds, but they muſt immediately appear to the garriſon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr Horſley has delineated this ſtation of an exact ſquare figure, whereas it is oblong, one hundred and ſeventy-four paces from north to ſouth, and from eaſt to weſt one hundred and ſixty within the wall. It had ſurvived many ages leſs mutilat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than any ſtructure of the kind, in the northern counties, but of late many of the ſtones have been removed to incloſe the adjacent lands, and make the roads; and the proprietor is regularly deſtroying this piece of antiquity. In ſome parts the wall yet remains almoſt perfect; the outſide is perpendicular, twelve feet in height, built of aſhler work, in regular courſes, each ſtone being about nine inches deep and twelve long: By ſome large ſtones which lie near the foot of the wall, it is evident there was a parapet, with a walk near three feet wide at the top. At the weſt entrance a ſtone, as repreſented in the cut, was lately dug up, from which
<figure/>
the drawing was made in 1783, and ſhews that ſuch fortifications had more orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than is commonly apprehended: The inſide of the vallum is built of aſhler work, but from the ground work upwards, at the diſtance of about twenty inches, it diminiſhes gradually in thickneſs, in ſteps running parallel through the whole ſtructure, by which thoſe within might aſcend the wall, and inſtantly line the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet with troops on the approach of an enemy. The wall where broken through is eight feet thick at the preſent ſurface, diminiſhing to ſomewhat more than four at the top; the interior part between the facings is formed of thin ſtones, placed inclining, feather-wiſe, tier above tier, run full of mortar mixed with rough gravel. What is remarkable, there appear no <hi>throughs,</hi> as the maſons call thoſe ſtones which bind the buildings by going through from face to face, or into the heart of the wall. There was an entrance in the center of each ſide of the ſquare, and to the weſt a wide ditch; the ground has been cultivated many years on the other ſides, as well as within the vallum. We did not diſcern any inſcription on the walls ſave L. xxxv.
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0782100202:384"/>
Mr Greenwell, of the Ford, has preſerved in his garden wall ſeveral rude effigies lately found here; the moſt remarkable are repreſented in the cuts.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>The cup uſed at divine offices in the church has a cover, which was found in this ſtation; the date on it (1571) is preſumed to be the time of finding. It is a Roman pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, and is alſo repreſented in the cut.</p>
               <p>The laſt time we viſited this ſtation, in Auguſt 1783, we diſcovered at a gate on the weſt ſide of the road, the pillar repreſented, which it is preſumed ſtood on the

               <p>An extenſive diviſion of common lands within this pariſh took place by virtue of an act of parliament, in the twelfth year of his preſent majeſty, on which, it was computed, twenty thouſand acres were to be incloſed. The commiſſioners were impowered to diſpoſe of lands, to raiſe money for making all the roads, and paying expences; for which purpoſe they ſold one thouſand five hundred and fifty-one acres for 8174l. or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and three hundred acres were ſet out and veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the juſtices of the peace of the county, for raiſing money to compenſate the owners of allotments, ſuch damages as they ſhould ſuſtain by the lord biſhop of Durham, or his leſſees, winning mines therein: But being afterwards conſidered, that it would be more expedient to ſell an allotment of three hundred acres, ſubject to a rent charge of 30l. a year, an act of parliament was obtained to carry ſuch ſale into effect, and Thomas White, of Retford, in the county of Nottingham, <abbr>eſq</abbr> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0782100202:385"/>
the purchaſer. He ſet a moſt laudable example on this diviſion, and planted two hundred and eleven acres with foreſt trees, and ſixteen acres with fruit trees, which, under the ſhelter of riſing plantations, promiſe to anſwer the adventurer's expectations. Of the three hundred acres purchaſed, Mr White has planted one hundred and fifty acres more with foreſt trees. This vaſt tract of country, which was barren, deſart, and dreary, where the perplexed traveller wandered in the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous tracks with anxiety, is now incloſed, much of it cultivated, and interſected with direct roads, made in the turnpike manner, fit for the reception of any car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; innumerable buildings are ſcattered over the proſpect; merchandiſe has found an expeditious paſſage to villages heretofore almoſt inacceſſible, but in the very midſt of ſummer; and the inhabitants, greatly multiplied, are chearful and proſperous. In one farmhold, totally ſeparated from all ancient incloſures, in the ſummer of 1783, we obſerved thirty-four ſtacks of corn in one yard, the produce of new cultivations. Many parts lie very high, the proſpect conſequently exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive: At a point where the roads leading to Durham, Hexham, Cheſter, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter meet, the view is noble, and commands a vaſt extent of country, even to the mouths of the rivers Tyne, Were, and Tees, beſides a diſtant proſpect to the weſt and north.</p>
               <p>The chapelry of ESH is mentioned before as appertaining to the firſt prebend of Lancheſter. The church was a very mean ſtructure, being in length from eaſt to weſt about nineteen yards, and five yards and a half wide: In the year 1769 biſhop Crewe's truſtees gave one hundred pounds towards rebuilding it<note n="*" place="bottom">

In the thirty-ſixth of the ſame biſhop, Thomas the ſon and heir of William died ſeiſed of the ſame manors, and the male line became extinct, he leaving a daughter and heireſs, Johan, who married Robert de Bland, who in her right poſſeſſed the manor

of Eſh, with Ulſhaw and Heleigh, members thereof. The family of Eſh poſſeſſed a city houſe in the Bailey, Durham, built againſt the caſtle wall. We do not find that Bland had any iſſue, but Johan, his widow, married to her ſecond huſband Thomas Colvill, <abbr>eſq</abbr> who, in the ſeventeenth year of biſhop Skirlaw, died ſeiſed in her right of this manor. Colvill's widow married a Forſter, and by an inquiſition taken on the death of Richard Forſter her ſon and heir, in the ſecond year of biſhop Nevil, it is ſtated, that Johan, by a deed of ſettlement, dated at Staindrop, the laſt day of June, in the year 1428, conveyed to truſtees the manor and vills of Skyrnyngham, Bermton, Eſh, Ulſhawe, Eſtheryngton, 1 meſſ. c. acres of land in Roule, 6 meſſ. cclx. acres of land, and ſeventeen ſhillings rent in Middle Herryng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Weſt Herryngton, 2 meſſ. cc. acres in Cornſhowe, 2 meſſ. and c. acres of land, &amp;c. called the Hugh, in Eſh, a cloſe there called the Neuparke, 1 meſſ. and 60 acres called Underſyd, in Eſh, and 1 meſſ. called Ratonrawe. No licence was obtained. That the manors and vills of Eſh and Ulſhawe, the Hugh and Underſyde, were held of the biſhop by military ſervice of the value of twelve marks. That Matilda, the wife of John Walkerfield, ſiſter and heir of the before-named Richard Forſter, had releaſed her right in the premiſſes to the truſtee, whereby he was in power to make his deed of indenture, dated the 1ſt of November, the eighteenth of Henry VI. whereby he granted to Walter Boynton, arm. 3 meſſ. cxl. acres of land and meadow, in Eſh, Middle Herryngton, and Weſt Herryngton for life, and after his death to William, the ſon of William Hodilſton, and the heirs of his body, remainder to John Walkerfield, the ſon of the before-named Matilda, the ſiſter of Richard Forſter, and the heirs of his body, remainder to Alice, John's ſiſter, remainder to the afore-named Matilda, and the heirs of her body, remainder to the right heirs of Roger de Eſh. And by another indenture, dated the 4th day of the ſame month of November, he granted to the ſame John Walkerfield, ſon of Matilda, ſon and heir of Richard Forſter, who was the ſon and heir of John, the ſon of Thomas, lord of Eſh, the manors and vills of Eſh and Ulſhawe, a meſſ. and c. acres in Roule the Hugh New Park and Underſyde in Eſh, 2 meſſ. and cc. acres in Corneſhowe, 1 meſſ. and c. acres in Heugh, and to the heirs of his body, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to Alice his ſiſter, and the heirs of her body, remainder to Matilda, Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard's ſiſter, and the heirs of her body, remainder to William Hodilſton, Matilda's brother, and the heirs of his body, remainder to the right heirs of Roger de Eſh. The manor of Eſh and lands there were held of the biſhop by military ſervice, and the lands in Corneſhowe were held of Johan counteſs of Weſtmereland.— How the remainders took place it is difficult to aſcertain.

By an inquiſition taken in the fifteenth year of biſhop Langley, 1421, on the death of Richard lord Scrope of Bolton, it is ſtated, that he had diveſted himſelf of the manor and vill of Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley ſome time before his death, and that Ralph Eure, chiv. was ſeiſed thereof to him and his heirs; and by an inquiſition taken on his death, in the ſeventeenth year of the ſame biſhop, he appears to have died poſſeſſed thereof by the name of <hi>Maneria &amp; villa de Langley &amp; le waterfall cum p'tin. que h'uit ex feoffo.

Richard le Scrope and others had been enfeoffed in this manor, with divers other eſtates, by virtue of the licence of biſhop Nevill, but the truſt is not ſpecified: The feoffor Henry left John his ſon and heir, who was grandfather of Henry after mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and probably the confidence repoſed conſiſted of divers limitations in tail, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which it deſcended to Henry lord Scrope the feoffor's grandſon, who by the inſcription after mentioned, is preſumed to have built the hall, of which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ruins are remains. An engraving of this inſcription was publiſhed in the Antiquarian Repertory in 1775, from a drawing made by Mr Rob. Hutchinſon, in 1771, and we preſume communicated by Thomas Gyll, <abbr>eſq</abbr> with the following account<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 285, 286.</note>. <q>At Langley hall, in the pariſh of Lancheſter, is a mantle-piece of ſtone, over a large fire place, with an inſcription thereon in capital letters: The inſcription relates to Henry lord Scrope, of Bolton, in Yorkſhire, who married Margaret the daughter of Thomas lord Dacre, of Gilſland, in Cumberland. The arms on the ſecond quarter are thoſe of Tibetot, or Tiptoft, an heireſs of which family married an anceſtor of the ſaid Henry lord Scrope, whoſe coat of arms are engraved with hers, and the ſame are depicted in the upper windows on the ſouth part of the pariſh church of Richmond, in Yorkſhire. The eſcut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon, by the diviſion on the wife's ſide, on the right hand, looks as if intended for him and his two wives, for he was twice married; but the arms on the ſide of the wives are ſo worn away that they are not diſtinguiſhable. The upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſeems as if ſomething like bars or barry were in them; bars were in the arms of Greyſtock: The other ſhould be Scrope of Upſal, his ſecond wife, whoſe name was Alice, daughter of Thomas lord Scrope, of Upſal, by Margaret his wife, daughter of Thomas lord Dacres, grandfather of Thomas lord Dacres above mentioned.</q> We muſt obſerve further on this inſcription, that the lines are not to be read direct, but are broken in the center, and ſtands thus, ſo far as the letters are diſtinct:

by this it appears he was the eleventh lord of Bolton, and ſhe the daughter of lord Dacre, of Greyſtoke. Mr Allan further illuſtrates this matter by the genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical table on the next page.</p>
                  <p>From the family of Scrope, Langley came into the family of Paulet, by marriage with one of the natural daughters of Emanuel Scrope, earl of Sunderland, and not many years ago was ſold by Mr Paulet, ſon of lord William Paulet, who was the ſecond ſon of the firſt duke of Bolton, to Henry Lambton, <abbr>eſq</abbr> of Lambton, late member of parliament for the city of Durham, and is now the property of John Lambton, <abbr>eſq</abbr> the heir general of that ancient family.</p>

In the twenty-ſixth year of that prelate it appears by an inquiſition taken on the death of John de Howden, that he died ſeiſed of the manor of Rowley, which we preſume implies Eaſt Rowley, held of the biſhop <hi>in capite,</hi> by homage, fealty, ſuit at three chief courts, and ſix ſhillings and eight-pence rent. He left no iſſue, and his eſtates deſcended to his ſiſter's daughters, one of whom, Agnes, married Thomas Beke to her ſecond huſband, having iſſue by her firſt huſband Hugh del Redhugh a ſon, Hugh, who was heir to this manor, and poſſeſſed the ſame after her death, in the eighth year of biſhop Skirlaw: The male line of the family of Redhugh, as obſerved before, fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, their poſſeſſions were ſevered among coheireſſes. The poſſeſſions of Grey, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being in Robert de Nevill for a ſhort time, came to Thomas Grey, who was attainted, and were reſtored to Ralph Grey, with Conſet as before mentioned. The family of Bland held of the prior of Durham a ſmall parcel of land here.</p>

Robert Rhodes died in the ſeventeenth year of biſhop Booth; and by an inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then taken, it is ſtated, that he had conveyed this manor, with the lands called Greenlawe, held under Ralph earl of Weſtmoreland, by his deed dated the 1ſt of April, fourteenth Edward IV. to John Hebburn and William Lawſon, but no truſt is ſpecified; and that he died without iſſue, leaving Alicia, the wife of Richard Bainbrigg, daughter of John Rhodes his brother his heir. This manor was divided by two parceners, and in the ſeventeenth year of biſhop Dudley, Johan, the wife of Robert Robſon, died ſeiſed of one moiety thereof, with a moiety of Greenlawe and Smether Strother, leaving Thomas Hodgſon, her ſon by a former huſband, her heir. The records before us do not point out how the other moiety deſcended.</p>

               <p>The reader will revert to the account given of this place in the annals of the biſhops <note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. i. p. 52.</note>, where he will find more at large the particulars here briefly recapitulated. Biſhop Eardulph, who was the eighteenth prelate of the church of Lindisfarn, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the remains of St Cuthbert before the barbarians who made their ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious deſcent on that iſland, not ſettling at Crake, where he ſat down for a time, reſted at Cheſter, and there began to build a church about the year 883; and the religious body retained this reſidence till the year 995, when they reſted at Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. Tanner ſays, the See removed hither "had probably a chapter of monks, or rather ſecular canons attending it."—Cheſter entertained the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſociety that exiſted at Lindisfarn, and they were again tranſlated to Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, ſo it is pretty certain there was no eſtabliſhment of monks here, but of ſeculars. Egelric, the fourth biſhop of Cheſter, was induced to take down the humble building of wood which his predeceſſor erected for his epiſcopal church,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0782100202:405"/>
and raiſed one more magnificent: Finding great treaſures, he conveyed the ſame out of his biſhopric to enrich the monaſtery of Peterborough, from whence he came: We have already offered conjectures on this treaſure-trove, and therefore ſhall not dwell on it here. On the introduction of canons regular into the cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral church of Durham, Cheſter, it is ſaid, was one of the churches appointed to receive the ſeculars, who, without having committed offence, were removed from the ſeat of dignity, and no doubt were provided for in the moſt ample manner.</p>

                  </note>. It is a handſome edifice of ſtone, covered with lead; the tower from the foundation is ſquare, but when it riſes above the roof, takes an octagonal form, and in this part is apparently much more modern; it is finiſhed with a moſt elegant ſtone ſpire, one of the fineſt in the north of England, being in the whole one hundred and fifty-ſix feet in height: The accurate plate will ſave much deſcription. The whole length of this building on the outſide is fifty-four paces. The church within is of a regular form, having two ſide ailes, ſeparated from the nave by five pointed arches ſupported on pillars, two of which towards the eaſt in each row are light and round, but the third, an odd conceit in the architect, is formed of two cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders put together, the broad ſides facing the nave and ailes: The nave is in length from the foot of the tower thirty paces, and in width, including the ailes, from the north door to the ſouth, fifteen paces: The pulpit is placed againſt the center pillar in the ſouth row; the ſounding board heavy with rude carving. The whole church is decently ſtalled, and kept clean; the pavement is new; there is a handſome white marble font, and a gallery at the weſt end: The ſouth aile is lighted with three regular windows of three lights each, under pointed arches; in the eaſtern one are two coats of arms. The chancel has been altered in modern times, and is only ſix paces wide by eleven long; the arch which ſeparates it is ſupported on light brackets, and the ſtalls are without much ornament. There are four windows to the ſouth, and a large modern-ſaſh to the eaſt.</p>
               <p>The north aile, which now is ſolely appropriated to and filled with a line of tombs of the Lumley family, has anciently been further extended, three arches and two columns appearing in the outſide wall, as if ſome ſmall cloiſter formerly lay contiguous to the church: The windows diſcover the alteration, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was made when the tombs were placed, for there are three ſquare windows within the old arches, and a window under a pointed arch beyond them.

               <p>This ſolemn arrangement of effigies, this aile of death, cannot be viſited with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome emotion by thoſe who know the family, deſcended of an illuſtrious race of anceſtry, or have traced their hiſtory and poſſeſſions. The genealogical table which attends the deſcription of Lumley caſtle will ſave a tedious rehearſal of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numental inſcriptions.</p>
               <p>The firſt effigy at the foot or weſt end of the aile, is by an inſcription on the wall, noted to appertain to Liulphus, that unhappy miniſter of Walcher biſhop of Durham, who provoked the maſſacre at Gateſhead church: The figure is cut in ſtone, but much mutilated, having loſt the feet; the right hand is extended, graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſword, as in the action of drawing the weapon; the legs are ſtraight. It will be neceſſary to note why ſuch different attitudes had acceptance in monumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal effigies. Perſons who died in battle on the victorious ſide, were repreſented with the helmet on the head, the ſhield on the leſt, and the ſword on the dexter ſide, naked, and with the point upwards. Thoſe who died in battle on the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed ſide, were repreſented on their tombs without their coat over their armour, with their feet reſting on a dead lion, having their hands joined on their breaſt, the viſor lifted up, and the ſword in the ſheath. Thoſe who died priſoners were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented without helmet, ſword or ſpur. One who had ſerved a great part of his life in the army, and afterwards became a religious perſon, was repreſented up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the habit of the order he profeſſed, and below in complete armour. A gentleman or knight, who had been killed or vanquiſhed in ſingle combat, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in compleat armour, his battle ax out of his arms, lying by him, and his left arm acroſs his right. If he had been victorious, he was repreſented armed on all points, with his right arm acroſs over the left, and his battle ax in his arms. The ſon of a general, or governor of a caſtle or fortified city, if he died when the place was beſieged, was pourtrayed in complete armour, with his head reſting on an helmet inſtead of a pillow<note n="†" place="bottom">Barley's Diction.</note>.</p>
               <p>The ſecond effigy, <hi>Utredus filius Liulphi,</hi> cut in ſtone, his head, ſhoulders, and arms covered with a coat of mail of chain work, the legs of the ſame, the right hand graſping the ſword hilt in the action of drawing the weapon.</p>
               <p>The third, <hi>William de Lumley,</hi> accoutred the ſame as the laſt; a parrot held by the tail in the right hand, the legs croſſed, the right foot uppermoſt, the feet reſted on a lion couchant—an elegant figure; the folds of the veſt ſkirts eaſy and finely diſpoſed. This William was the ſon of Uchtred, and grandſon of Liul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus before-mentioned.</p>
               <p>The fourth, <hi>William Lumley</hi> mil. in a ſuit of armour, his legs croſſed, the left leg uppermoſt, the feet broken off, his right hand drawing the inſtrument,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0782100202:410"/>
his head reſted on an helmet; his hair cut at the fore-top, and in ſtiff curl.</p>
               <p>The fifth, <hi>William de Lumley</hi> mil. ſon of William, in a ſuit of armour, his head reſted on his helmet, the right hand drawing the ſword; the hair like the fourth; the legs ſtraight, and the feet gone.</p>
               <p>The ſixth, <hi>Roger,</hi> in a ſuit of armour, much mutilated, the legs, hand and ſhield gone, hair curled as the former. This perſonage married Sybil, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and coheireſs of Hugh de Morwic, who had two other daughters, Theophania and Beatrix; and they, in the fourth year of king Edward I. made partition of the knights fees of their inheritance.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh, in a ſuit of armour, a ſhield, no ſword, his right hand on his breaſt, his hair curled, his head ſupported on cuſhions, the legs ſtraight, and feet reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a ſhield of his coat-armour: This tomb belongs to <hi>Robert de Lumley,</hi> eldeſt ſon of Roger, and father of Marmaduke, whoſe tomb is next noted.</p>
               <p>The eighth, <hi>Sir Marmaduke de Lumley,</hi> with a curled beard, a cap in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right folds and terminating in a point, his head reſting on his gauntlets laid acroſs each other, the fingers inwards; his hands elevated on his breaſt, three parrots ſcattered on his garments below the girdle; his legs appear to have been placed ſtraight, but are much mutilated: This perſonage's mother was the eldeſt daughter of Marmaduke de Thweng, a great baron, lord of Kilton and Thweng, with many other manors in Yorkſhire, Lancaſhire, and Weſtmoreland; ſhe and her ſiſter Catharine were coheireſſes of William, Robert, and Thomas de Thweng their brothers: Sir Marmaduke's eldeſt ſon, Robert, was under age at his father's death, and he died during his minority, leaving Ralph his next brother and heir: They derived from their mother the manors of Moreſſome-Magna, Moreſſome Parva, Ocketon, Lythum, Merſke, Brotton, Hylderwell, Skynner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green, Lyvertoun, North Cave, Roteſe-on-the-Wolds, Lound, Langtoſe, Sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe, Thorp juxta Kilton, Foxholes, Thweng, with the advowſon of the church, Kilton caſtle, Stotevil-fee, and Bulmer-fee, all in the county of York<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſc. 49 king Edw.

               <p>The ninth effigy, <hi>Ralph,</hi> firſt lord of Lumley. This is a remarkable figure, cut in coarſe freeſtone, and was one of thoſe removed from the yard of the cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral church at Durham, by virtue of the licence before noted: It is dreſſed in a ſtraight-ſleeved jacket or coat of mail, his viſor is rib'd down the front, and has two tranſverſe ſlits for the ſight; the breaſt is covered with the ſhield bearing three parrots, the ſword under the ſhield unſheathed, the point upwards reſted againſt the face of the viſor; the legs are ſtraight, ſupported on a dog lying at reſt. This perſonage was a knight in the ninth year of king Richard II. and in the retinue of Henry de Percy, earl of Northumberland, in the expedition into Scotland, where he behaved ſo gallantly, that the king in the year ſucceeding appointed him governor of Berwick: In the twelfth year of that reign he was taken priſoner by the Scotch: After his releaſe he held Berwick as the earl's deputy for ſome time: Was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to parliament among the barons from the eighth year of king Richard II. till the firſt of king Henry IV, incluſive, when he was attainted, and had his lands

ſeized for being a confederate with the earl of Kent and others againſt that acceſſion, and oppoſing the diſpoſal of Richard. The aſſociators appeared in arms, and took poſſeſſion of the town of Cirenceſter, whilſt their troops lay encamped without; but on an inſurrection of the inhabitants, the lords were overpowered, and carried priſoners to the king at Oxford, where they ſuffered immediate execution. It ſeems lord Lumley was not among the priſoners, for by the record of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture and attainder, it is ſet forth he died in the field of battle: If we give credit to the device on the monument, when he fell he was of the victorious party. His wife Elianor was daughter of John lord Nevill of Raby, and ſiſter of Ralph earl of Weſtmoreland: In her widowhood, ſhe had in the ſecond year of king Henry IV. an aſſignment of twenty pounds a year during life out of the cuſtoms at Hull, which was confirmed by king Henry V. in the firſt year of his reign, with the further grant of lands and tenements in Beautrove and Stranton, in the biſhopric of Durham, and Holme in Holderneſs. The eldeſt ſon, Thomas, died in the fifth year of king Henry IV. ſeiſed of the caſtle of Lumley Parva, and the manors of Stanley, Stranton, Rickleſden, and Beautrove, in the biſhopric, together with divers other large eſtates in Yorkſhire and Northumberland; dying without iſſue, he left Sir John Lumley, knight, his brother and heir, then twenty years of age.

               <p>The tenth effigy, Sir <hi>John Lumley:</hi> A figure reſembling the laſt deſcribed, and moſt probably the ſecond monument removed from the cathedral church-yard.— To this perſonage king Henry was much attached; in the ſixth year of that reign he had livery of all the caſtles, manors, and lands of which his father was ſeiſed at the time of his attainder; and for his ſervices in Scotland he received the honour of knighthood: He alſo fought bravely in the French war, for which gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant conduct and fidelity to his ſovereign, he had full reſtitution of blood by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the thirteenth year of that reign, as well what was attainted by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of his father, as Thomas his brother; ſo it is expreſſed in the parliament rolls. In the wars of king Henry V. he alſo ſignalized himſelf: Under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Thomas duke of Clarence, the king's brother, he was in the battle of Baugy, in the province of Anjoy, on Eaſter-eve, 1421, to which the Engliſh army was betrayed by one Andrew Forguſa, a Lombard, who was employed by the duke as a ſpy, and falſely repreſented the numbers and ſituation of the enemy: Many of the Engliſh lords were averſe to the enterprize, and diſſuaded the duke from approaching his foes on ſo ſlight and ſuſpicious a report; but the General im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly placing confidence in his emiſſary, reſolved to ſeek the foe and engage; his troops diſdained the idea of deſerting danger, and, when too late, found they were attacking four times their numbers; feats of diſtinguiſhed bravery were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, and all the efforts of intrepid courage exhibited, but in vain; for in the dreadful carnage of a defeat, there ſell the duke, lord Lumley, the earls of Tankerville and Angus, and the lord Roſs, together with many of inferior rank:
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0782100202:412"/>
He left a ſon and heir, <hi>Thomas,</hi> whoſe tomb is not in this arrangement at Cheſter.</p>
               <p>The eleventh effigy, <hi>George lord Lumley:</hi> This figure, like the reſt, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, dreſſed in robes, a heavy ruff or roll about his neck, his hands elevated, curled hair and beard: The dreſs ſimilar to the robes of a peer as now worn. This perſonage was knighted by king Edward IV. He was ſheriff of Northumberland in the ſecond and third years of that reign; an office then not only of great truſt and authority, but of vaſt emolument, for no account was made to the king's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer till the third year of king Edward VI. but the iſſues and profits of the bailiwic were appropriated to the ſheriffs proper benefit, with all debts, fines, and amerciaments, emoluments accruing from alienations, intruſions, wards, marriages, reliefs, &amp;c. the intention of which appropriation was to reward their diligence in protecting the borders againſt the Scots, and for that purpoſe to keep ſufficient guards in pay. But that duty being leſſened by the appointment of wardens of the marches, in the third year of king Edward VI. it was enacted, that the ſheriffs of Northumberland ſhould thenceforth like others account to the exchequer. In the ſixth year of king Edward IV. he, with Sir Robert Folbery, were elected knights of the ſhire for the county of Northumberland, in the parliament ſummoned to meet at Weſtminſter, and in the return of the writ are ſtiled <hi>milites gladiis cincti.</hi> He was appointed ſheriff of Northumberland in the eighth year of that reign, and continued in office four ſucceſſive years. In the twentieth year he was in the duke of Glouceſter's army, at the taking of Berwick, having a great command in that expedition, and in the rolls of the troops is called lord Lumley: He was one that entered Edinburgh at the head of the forces, and with lord Fitz Hugh, the lord Scrope of Maſſam, and others, was made a knight banneret in Hooton-field, as a teſtimony of approved gallantry. On the acceſſion of king Henry VII. he attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the king in his northern progreſs. In the thirteenth year of king Henry VII. he ſerved in lord Surrey's army, when they raiſed the ſiege of Norham caſtle, where the king of Scots lay in perſon; and from thence penetrating into Scotland, made a diverſion, and deſtroyed ſome conſiderable fortreſſes in ſight of the Scotch army. On the eſpouſals of the princeſs Margaret of England with James king of Scotland, 1502, he, with his ſon and their retinue, accompanied by eighty horſemen in their train, apparelled in the family liveries, met the queen at Darlington and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her to Berwick. He married one of the daughters of Roger Thornton, <abbr>eſq</abbr> a merchant at Newcaſtle, by whom he got a large fortune, and among other poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions the manors of Witton in Northumberland, Ludworth and the Iſle, in this county. There happened much litigation touching this lady's fortune, through one Giles Thornton, a natural ſon of her father; and the contention becoming perſonal, lord Lumley ſlew him at Windſor caſtle ditch. Biſhop Sherwood, in the ſixth year of his pontificacy, granted a pardon to George lord Lumley, of all fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and reſtoration of forfeitures<note n="*" place="bottom">Curſitors Rolls.—<bibl>Rudd's MSS.</bibl>

daughter of king Edward IV. by lady Elizabeth Lucy. He appeared on behalf of the clergy and commonalty of the dioceſe of Durham, in the eleventh year of king Henry VII. when the three eſtates of the kingdom were ſummoned to aſſemble at Weſtminſter on the 27th of October, 1495.

               <p>The thirteenth effigy, <hi>Richard lord Lumley,</hi> in robes, with elevated hands, a ruff or roll about the neck. This perſonage was the eldeſt ſon of Thomas Lumley, as before mentioned, and had ſummons to parliament among the barons, in the firſt year of king Henry VIII. He left by Anne his lady, daughter of Sir John Conyers, of Hornby caſtle, his eldeſt ſon John, who ſucceeded to the family ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and eſtates.</p>
               <p>The fourteenth and laſt effigy, <hi>John lord Lumley.</hi> The figure dreſſed in robes. This perſonage, in the fifth year of king Henry VIII. on the Scotch invaſion, joined the earl of Surrey with a large force, and was one of the principal commanders of the van guard of the Engliſh army at the battle of Flodden Field: It is mentioned by ſeveral hiſtorians, that this van guard ſhewed great bravery in the engagement, and were victorious over that body of the enemy commanded by the earls of Crawford and Montroſs, who both fell in the field. In the following year he was ſummoned to parliament, and in the year 1520, he was preſent at the interview the king had with the emperor Charles V. at Canterbury, and that with the king of France near Ardres: He ſerved under the earl of Shrewſbury in the Scotch expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; and in the twenty-firſt of the reign, had ſummons to that parliament which exiſted five years by prorogations, and ſtruck the firſt blow in the diſſolution of religious houſes: He was in the combination that encouraged the king to the divorce of queen Catharine; and at laſt fell from his loyalty, and joined the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern confederates in the pilgrimage of grace, but accepted the terms of the duke of Norfolk's proclamation. His ſon George fell into other broils, and was one of the partizans of the lord Darcy, was apprehended and committed to the Tower, and ſoon after ſuffered death. John the ſon of George Lumley, at the death of his grandfather, was an infant under age; and in the firſt year of king Edward VI. on his petition was reſtored in blood, as ſon and heir of George, and couſin and heir of John, then late lord Lumley, but ſundry parts of the eſtate were ſevered from the family, the act of reſtoration not repealing the attainder of his father.</p>

                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:0782100202:415"/>Gunceastre, or Goncaceastre, was the ancient Saxon name of this place, and as Leland ſays, was derived from the rivulet Cone, which there empties itſelf into Were. In the Itinerary, vol. i. p. 83, it is ſaid, <q>There is no bridge memorable on Were beneath Dureſme but Cheſter bridge. Were cummith within a quarter of a mile of the town ſelf of Cheſter. From Dureſme, over Framagate bridge to Cheſter in the Streate, partly by a little corne ground, but moſt by montainiouſe paſture and ſome mores and firres. Or I came in Cheſter I ſaw ſcant half a mile of it, Lomeley caſtel upon a hill, having praty wood about it, and about Cheſter ſelf is likewiſe ſum woode. The toune of Cheſter is chiefly one ſtreate, of very meane building in height. Ther is beſide a ſmaul ſtreate or 2 about the chirch collegiate, that hath a dean and prebendaries, but it is a very meane building; and in the body of the chirch is a tumbe, with the image of a byſhop, yn token that St Cuthbert ons was buried or remained in his feretre there. At the very ende of the toune I paſſid over Cone brooke, and there is a fair ſtone bridge of 3 arches over it. Thens to Gateſhed vii miles by montainiouſe ground, with paſture, heth, more, and firres; and a litle a this ſide Gatehead is a great cole pit.</q>

               <p>The preſent town of Cheſter is about a mile in length, conſiſting chiefly of one long ſtreet, has many good buildings in it, and is commodiouſly ſituated for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the numerous miners employed in the neighbouring collieries and other works <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>At Whitehill, or Whitwel, in this neighbourhood, is a blaſt furnace, which makes iron metal from iron ſtone dug out of pits in the neighbouring fells. Theſe fells have been very much worked for iron ſtone (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Danes, when they were in poſſeſſion of this kingdom) as appears from the great quantity of ſcoria or cinder which is found upon the fells and extends many miles weſtward. The method in thoſe times had been to melt the iron ſtone with charcoal in a large ſmithy hearth, called a bloomery, and then in another hearth to melt it down again and reduce it to bar iron for all manner of country uſes: And when the wood failed they removed their hearths to where was more plenty, ſo that evidently they muſt have blown their bloomery bellows either by hand or with horſes, or have known the uſe of air furnaces, as the moſt ſcoria or cinder is found upon the high grounds, where no water could be obtained. About three miles weſt of Cheſter is a place called the Old Furnace, where very lately was to be ſeen the bottom of a furnace hearth, according to the uſual method of building them now, but of much ſmaller dimenſions: They had blown the bellows with a water wheel, as appears by the cut of a water race to convey it to the wheel from an upper part of the burne. On the oppoſite ſide of the burne is a place called the Allum Well, from the water having a ſtrong aluminous ſmell and taſte. The method of making metal is by putting into a large furnace about thirty-four feet in height, and twelve or thirteen feet wide in the broadeſt part, but contracted at top and bottom, a certain number of baſkets of coal or cinders, to a certain number of boxes of iron ſtone, calcined for the purpoſe, and a quantity of lime ſtone ſufficient to ſlux it; when a ſufficient quantity is melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the hearth or baſon at the bottom of the furnace, it then is tapped with an iron bar, and run off into metal pigs, or large veſſels prepared in loam, (a compoſition of ſand, clay, &amp;c.) for different uſes, ſuch as brewing veſſels, ſoap pans, engine pumps, cylinders, cannons of all ſizes,; and the iron ſtone and coal uſed here, are allowed by the beſt judges at his majeſty's warren at Woolwich, to make the ſtrongeſt and ſoundeſt cannons that are proved there.—<hi>From the information of Mr Smith, agent to theſe works.</hi>

The chief improvement of this country is attributed to cardinal Langley, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſted the lands, and licenced their being incloſed and brought into tillage.</p>
               <p>As this manor appertained to the biſhop, we muſt naturally conclude there were few free tenants therein: In the fifth year of biſhop Hatfield, Will. de Birtley died ſeiſed of a meſſuage and thirty acres of land here, held by homage, fealty, and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſhillings rent; and Ra. Clerk, in the ſeventh year of the ſame prelate, died ſeiſed of twenty-ſix acres of land, held by fealty and ten ſhillings rent, and ſixty acres of wood, by fealty and rendering two arrows; and they are the only free tenants we have met with noted in the ancient records.</p>
               <p>Camden apprehended Cheſter was the <hi>Condercum</hi> of the Romans: Dr Stukeley, in his Iter-boreale, 1725, ſays, <q>The Hermen ſtreet is very plain, being a ſtraight line hither when we deſcend from Gateſhead fell: I think Bede mentions this ſtation, as called Conceſter, which retains part of the Roman name. Great coal works too hereabouts. The firſt wing of the Aſtures made this their garriſon, as the Notitia tells us, being <hi>ad lineam valli;</hi> for though it be not upon the wall, it is reaſonable to think his expreſſion is not to be ſtrictly taken; it was convenient that ſome of the forces that guarded the wall ſhould be quartered at ſome ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance, that they might have room of country for their maintenance.</q> No inſcriptions or other Roman remains have been diſcovered here; and the name of Cheſter-on-the-Street derived from its ſituation on the Roman way, has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been all that led the antiquaries to conceive it was of Roman origin. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, as Dr Stukeley obſerves, ſome troops were ſtationed at a diſtance from the wall; perhaps they lined the great roads at intervals with ſmall detachments; and this is ſtill more probable, if we admit they knew any thing of pit coal for fuel. But we defer ſpeaking on that till we advance to the banks of Tyne.</p>

                  <p>is the next place of obſervation. This caſtle, one of the ſeats of lord Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, ſtands on a fine elevated ſituation, ornamented with beautiful planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the lands riſe gradually from the channel of the river Were on the ſouth and weſt ſides; and on the north is the rivulet called Lumley beck: The eaſt front of the caſtle ſtands immediately on the brink of a very deep valley, full of wood, through which the brook winds towards the Were. The form of this edifice is ſquare, having a projecting tower at each angle, and a court or area in the center: The corners of each tower are guarded with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>treſſes, crowned with a ſmall turret or obſervatory; what is ſingular in the turrets is, that they are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangular, ſo that they overhang the face of each ſquare of the baſe, and are machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colated or open for the purpoſe of annoying aſſailants by caſting down ſtones, &amp;c. which gives the edifice a ſingular appearance: The caſtle is built of a yellow free-ſtone, which makes it look bright and beautiful at a diſtance. The chief entrance is at the weſt front, by a double ſlight of ſteps, and a platform, which fills the whole ſpace between the tower; the ſouth front is modern, and brought forward almoſt parallel with the tower, ſixty-five paces in length; the north front is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0782100202:421"/>
by offices; and the eaſt front retains its ancient form: There is a gateway in the center of the eaſt front, which projects and is guarded by ſquare turrets at the angles, with obſervatories as before deſcribed; above the gate is a gallery formed in the arch, with apertures to annoy an enemy: Above this gate are ſix ſhields of arms boldly cut in ſtone, with their ſeveral creſts, cotemporary with the building, and which critically give us the date of it.</p>
                  <p>The arrangement of the arms is as follows: In the center, and elevated above the reſt, are the arms of France and England quarterly, being, as we preſume, the arms of king Richard II. as in that reign Sir Ralph Lumley obtained licence from biſhop Skirlaw, dated 1389, to caſtellate his houſe of Lumley; and the architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this front is a grand model of the taſte of that age: The act of Richard II. mentioned by Mr Pennant, had been intruſional or merely confirmatory<note n="*" place="bottom">

                           <q>It is ſaid to have been built in the time of Edward I. by Sir Robert de Lumley, and enlarged by his ſon Sir Marmaduke. Prior to that the family reſidence was at Lumley, (from whence it took the name) a village a mile ſouth of the caſtle, where are remains of a very old hall houſe, that boaſts a greater anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. The former was not properly caſtellated till the year 1392, when Sir Ralph, the firſt lord of Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, obtained from Richard II. <hi>Licentiam caſtrum ſuum de Lomley, do novo aedificandum, muro de petra &amp; calce batellare &amp; kernellare et caſtrum illud ſic batellatum &amp; kernellatum tenere, &amp;c.</hi>

In the center are the arms of <hi>Lumley,</hi> as adopted from the <hi>Thwengs,</hi> whoſe heireſs married into this family; on the dexter ſide the arms of <hi>Percy,</hi> the creſt a lion paſſant; on the ſiniſter ſide, <hi>Nevill,</hi> with the bull's head for the creſt; the loweſt arms on the dexter ſide are thoſe of Cowley, creſt a ram's head; on the ſiniſter ſide the arms of Hilton baron Hilton, and Moſes's head for the creſt. There are three ſtories of apartments in this front, with mullioned windows guarded with iron: Between the walls and the brink of the precipice, is juſt ſpace enough for a terrace, which in early times was guarded with a curtain wall: The dell is very deep, the banks are ſteep, and now filled with large foreſt trees: The uniformity of the eaſt front, the arrangement of the arms, and the whole appearance of the maſonry, teſtify that this was part of the original ſtructure, and a chief entrance; for ſhould we form our conjecture from the appearance of the center area, we ſhould conclude every front of the caſtle was ſimilar to this.</p>
                  <p>Many accounts and prints have been publiſhed of this beautiful place, which ſtrikes the eye of the traveller on the great northern road; the moſt excellent of the prints was by Hearne and Byrne: We will in the firſt place ſelect from the various publications ſuch matter as appears moſt worthy attention, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with our view. All that Camden ſays of it is, <q>that it is encloſed with a park.</q> In Ruſſell and Owen's England Diſplayed, it is deſcribed to contain

                     <q>a great number of ſpacious apartments, ſome antique and others modern: The paintings are valuable, many of them repreſenting the anceſtors of that noble family, for ſome centuries paſt, in the habits of the time. The park, beſides the pleaſantneſs of the ſituation, has another and ſtill more valuable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to recommend it, that of being full of veins of coal; this, together with a navigable river, by which the coals are carried down to Sunderland, render Lumley park an inexhauſtable mine of treaſure to the family.</q> In one of the monthly magazines we are informed by a paper ſigned Edward Barras, <q>that the park is walled round with hewn ſtone, had formerly deer, but after it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and the pales removed, they ſickened and died." And he adds, "there are ſeveral dates upon different parts of the caſtle; one was pointed out to me, on the inner ſide of one of the eaſtern turrets, where the letters I. L. 1550 appear, though almoſt defaced.</q> Much repair has been given to the inner walls of the area; and on one of the eaſtern towers are two long ſtrings of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutcheons cut in ſtone, and placed in the building, nine in each row, with the arms of Lumley in the center at the bottom, and in two ſmall ſhields at the top, a fleur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de-lis on the dexter ſide, and a roſe on the ſiniſter: In thoſe ſtrings the Lumley arms are impaled, with the ſeveral families wherewith they intermarried.</p>
                  <p>There is a tradition at Cheſter, that about a century ago, the remains of an old chapel ſtood about three hundred yards to the north-weſt of the caſtle, with ſeveral vaults and ſubterraneous paſſages: A hill called Chapel hill, is well known, but no one about the caſtle could give any information touching the buildings.</p>

It appears he was equally a favourite with king Edward IV. for in the firſt year of that reign he obtained a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal of his grandfather's attainder; had ſummons to parliament for the remainder of his life, and was employed in various confidential matters by his ſovereign, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the negociations with king James of Scotland, touching his marriage. 12.

                  <p>The great dining-room is in the ſouth-weſt tower, elegantly ſtuccoed, with a vaulted roof; on one ſide it commands a view of the adjacent meadows, the ſloping banks of the river Were, highly cultivated; with a fine canal, formed by a curva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſtream: at the end windows, a proſpect down the avenue, with Cheſter and the chief objects deſcribed from the platform.</p>
                  <p>The little dining-room has ſeveral fine portraits. John lord Lumley, 1563, a three quarter piece; a pleaſing picture: There are other two portraits of this perſonage in the muſic-room, one dated 1588, the other 1591. This John was the ſon and heir of George Lumley, who ſuffered death as before mentioned, and grandſon and heir of John lord Lumley. In the ſixth year of king Edward VI. he was reſtored in blood, and that he and the heirs male of his body ſhould hold and bear the name, dignity, ſtate, and pre-eminence of a baron of this realm, &amp;c. On the 29th of September, 1553, he was made one of the knights of the bath, and attended with his lady at the coronation of queen Mary, he among the barons, and ſhe one of the ſix ladies who ſat in the chariot of ſtate, dreſſed in crimſon velvet, &amp;c. He was one of the two lords who introduced the firſt Ruſſian ambaſſador to audience: Was in employ in the firſt years of queen Elizabeth, but being ſuſpected of intrigue in the affairs of the queen of Scots, was taken into cuſtody with his father-in-law, the carl of Arundel, in the twelfth year of that reign, and was a great favourite with
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0782100202:425"/>
the earl, as appears by his will. He afterwards came into great confidence with the queen, and was one of the lords commiſſioned to ſit in trial of the unhappy victim of Elizabeth's jealouſies, and with a firmneſs ſome hiſtorians have ſpoken of with expreſſions of ſurprize, delivered his opinion <hi>that the ſentence was juſtly pronounced againſt the queen of Scots.</hi> In the forty-fourth year of the queen he was one of the peers who ſat on the trial of Robert D'Evereux, earl of Eſſex. On the acceſſion of king James he experienced many teſtimonies of royal confidence: Camden made moſt honourable mention of him: <q>He was a perſon of entire vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, integrity, and innocence; and in his old age a complete pattern of true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. He had ſo great a veneration for the memory of his anceſtors, that he cauſed monuments to be erected for them in the collegiate church of Cheſter in the Street, in order as they ſucceeded one another, from Liulphus down to his own time, which he had either picked out of the demoliſhed monaſteries or made new.</q> By his will he deviſed his eſtates, particularly the caſtle and manor of Lumley, to Richard Lumley, eldeſt ſon and heir apparent of Roger Lumley, <abbr>eſq</abbr> ſon of Anthony, brother to John lord Lumley his grandfather. He married Jane, the eldeſt of the two daughters of Henry Fitz-Allan, earl of Arundel, and by her had three children, who died in infancy; and to his ſecond wife married Elizabeth, daughter of John lord Darcy of Chiche, who ſurvived him, and by whom he had no iſſue: He died on the 11th of April, 1609, and was buried in the church at Cheam. The ancient barony of Lumley expired at his death.</p>

                           <hi>The Genealogical Table is illuſtrated, and great Additions made thereto, by the following Hiſtorical Notes, taken from <hi>Mr. GYLL'S MSS.</hi> who, in the firſt part of the Collection, remarks, that he took the ſame and others, from a Manuſcript written in the Reign of King Charles I.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In an old manuſcript which I have ſeen of the deſcent of Connyers of Sockbourn, there is written as follow: <q>Sir John Connyers, Knt. ſlew the monſtrous vermine, and poyſonous vermine, or wyverne, or aſke or worm, which overthrew and devoured many and ſundry people in feight, for that the ſent of the poyſon thereof was ſo ſtrong, that no perſonne might abide it. And by the providence of Almighty God, this John Connyers, Knt. overthrew the ſaid monſter, and ſlew it. But before he made this enterpriſe, having but one ſon, he went to the church at Sockburn in compleat armour, and offered up that, his only ſon, to the Holy Ghoſt: the place where this great ſerpent lay, was called Grayſtane.</q> And as it is written in the ſame manuſcript, this John lieth buried in Sockbourn, in compleat armour, before the conqueſt.</p>

                           <hi>Roger Connyers or Cognyers,</hi> was Lord of Sockbourn about the time of the Norman conqueſt, which was An. Dom. 1060.—He was, by William the Conqueror, made conſtable of Durham Caſtle, and keeper of all the arms of the ſoldiers within that caſtle; which was after paſt to him, the ſaid Roger, by deed to him and his heirs male for ever, and under the great ſeal of William de Sancto Carelipho, the then Biſhop of Durham.—This Roger had iſſue Roger, his ſon and heir, and others.</p>

                  <p>the ſeat of the family of Liddells, now of Sir Henry George Liddell, bart. ſtands on the ſide of a hill, ſloping gradually towards the eaſt; a ſituation not choſen for ſtrength. Near to it, by the road ſide, is a ſtone column, but of what event it is a memorial, hiſtory or tradition give no account. The antiquity of this caſtle leads to conjectures as to the etymology of the name; in many old records it is called <hi>Ravens-helm</hi> and <hi>Ravenſwaith,</hi> in the old ſpelling <hi>Raffenſweath.</hi> The Daniſh ſtandard was called <hi>Raffen,</hi> and <hi>weath</hi> is a north country word, now uſed in Scotland for <hi>ſorrow.</hi> "I ſhould be very <hi>weath</hi> to do ſuch an act," is a phraſe very commonly uſed in this country. The application we would make is, that Ravenſworth caſtle is of Daniſh foundation, and had its name from them as Raffens-Helm, or the ſtrong hold of the Daniſh ſtandard; and that ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of that people had occaſioned the name of Raffens-weath, or Daniſh woe. All etymologies, where there is ſuch a mixture of languages as in this country, will be ſubject to much uncertainty, and we offer this only as a vague conjecture. This caſtle has anciently formed a complete ſquare, with a tower at each corner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with a curtain wall: Whether there was any keep or other ſtructure in the center, it is not poſſible to determine; two of the towers form part of the offices to the preſent manſion, the other two project to the front. The apartments are ſmall, but neat, without much ornament; the breakfaſt room and room above it are modern, and face the ſouth, with a bow window; the lower one ſtuccoed; the upper room elegantly fitted up, and hung with tapeſtry of Antwerp; at one end of the room the landſcape work is ſtrikingly beautiful, in the ſtile of Pouſin: There is a ſpacious ſaloon, ſtair-caſe, and a good dining-room. The caſtle is ſhut in to the north and weſt by a fine foreſt of oaks, the nurſery of a large breed of herons, and ſome pheaſants: The ſouth aſpect conſiſts of rich meadow lands, ſcattered over with large trees at irregular diſtances: To the eaſt the vale of Lameſley, beautifully cloathed with wood, is extended to the eye for a mile and a half; immediately oppoſite, at the greateſt diſtance, Gateſhead-fell, wild and ſhaken, with a multitude of hovels and cottages.</p>

                  <p>FARNACRES is not noticed in the aſſignment of the prebends, and probably at that time was included in the deſcription of Lameſley or Ravenſhelm: In ſome of the records it is called of the pariſh of Whickham.

This family fell into female iſſue in the time of biſhop Langley, as is before noted in Holmſide, in the pariſh of Lancheſter. In 1428, Robert Umfrevill obtained licence to found a chantry in the chapel of Farnacres within that manor, which he endowed with the manor; after which, in 1439, the hoſpital of Frereſide was annexed thereto: After the diſſolution, Farnacres was annexed by purchaſe to the Ravenſworth eſtate<note n="†" place="bottom">

                     <hi>Cawſey,</hi> or as it is called in the old records <hi>Caldſit,</hi> is ſituated a little diſtance from Tanfield: This eſtate has for ſome conſiderable time appertained to the family of Claverings. The Dawſons had property and a manſion-houſe at Tanfield, now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Beamiſh eſtate. Beamiſh continued in the family of Monbouchers for ſeveral generations; and in the time of biſhop Nevill, Elizabeth, baroneſs of Hilton, formerly the wife of Bertram Monboucher, died poſſeſſed of Beamiſh and Tanfield, which ſhe held for life. In the fifth year of biſhop Booth, Bertram Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botell died ſeiſed <note n="*" place="bottom">Inq. p. m. cor. Joh.

The manor of Beamiſh is therein ſet out to conſiſt of one hundred and ſixty acres of land, and forty acres of wood. The Hilton name became extinct in female iſſue, Dorothy, one of the coheireſſes, marrying Morton Daviſon of Beamiſh, <abbr>eſq</abbr> The Daviſons alſo failed in male iſſue, and the large poſſeſſions of that family are come to Sir John Eden, baronet, whoſe mother was the ſurviving ſiſter of Morton Daviſon, <abbr>eſq</abbr> eldeſt ſon of the before named Morton.</p>
                  <p>BEAMISH-HOUSE is ſituate in a wooded vale, on the banks of the river Team, and in a deep retirement; the adjacent lands are fertile and well ſheltered, but the hills which ſurround it barren and lofty; yet nature has amply recompenſed all outward deformities, by her riches in mines of coal and iron.</p>
                  <p>Near Tanfield is a great work called <hi>Cawſy-Bridge,</hi> carried over a deep gill or valley, to obtain a level for the coal waggons to paſs, conſtructed at the expence of the Grand Aſſociators in colliery works in this country, known by the local appellation of the Grand Allies: The ſpan of the arch is one hundred and two feet, which riſes in abutments or land piers about nine feet in height, and being ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circular, makes the elevation about ſixty feet; the level is from thence kept up by forced bankings of earth, in ſome parts forty feet in height, and one hundred and forty paces in length; much more expenſive than maſon-work: There is a drift cut through the ſolid rock, to convey the ſtream of the rivulet under the bankings. The valley is wooded, wild, and romantic.</p>

                  <p>We muſt not quit this tract without obſerving, that traces of a Roman way have frequently been diſcovered on the moor north of Urpeth, in a direction lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the north to Cheſter: Within a mile of Urpeth is a round hill, with a trench, one of thoſe temporary fortifications uſed on the incurſion of the Scots, when they came down in ſmall bands to pillage the country: Such are numerous all over the borders. At Lawſome hill is a moſt extenſive proſpect, commanding the Chiviots to the north, Cleveland hills ſouth, Newcaſtle towards the eaſt, with Lumley caſtle, Cheſter, and Durham cathedral on the nearer grounds, the towns of Tanfield and Shield-row, with the mountains at the head of Weredale, on the moſt diſtant ground, to the weſt. The rivulet of Team may truly be called a mechanic ſtream, as there are not in the north any works to be compared to thoſe its waters ſupply: It carries ten mills or more, for the working of iron by Crowley's people, making oil, fulling, and grinding corn. Although mining and trade ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the attention of ſo many inhabitants, yet agriculture and country occupations are not neglected: The farmers have introduced an improved breed of ſheep, by croſſing with the Lincolnſhire ſort, and feed mutton to twenty-five pounds a quarter; the fell ſheep are ſmall and degenerated by want of change: The fell-bred cattle are about twenty-five ſtone weight at the ſlaughter; the better breed come to about ſixty ſtone weight: Such are the ſtocks on the eſtates adjoining the moors; in the lower lands by the banks of the river, the breeds of cattle are much ſuperior. There are iron mines near Tanfield, which appear to have been wrought in very diſtant times: The metal lies at a very inconſiderable depth from the ſurface. If the uſe of coal be ſo important as a late pretended diſcovery ſeemed to promiſe, theſe mines from their ſituation may hereafter prove of very great importance.</p>

               <p>Adjoining to Lancheſter pariſh, on the weſt, lies the pariſh of Muggleſwick. The firſt mention made of this place is in the time of biſhop Pudſey, who granted it to the convent of Durham, in exchange for Hardwick: And in the middle of the thirteenth century, Hugh, prior of Durham, incloſed a park here, and built a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera, conſiſting of a hall, chapel, and lodgings: The remains of thoſe ſtructures yet appear, part of the park wall and the eaſt end of the chapel; the whole camera has had underground apartments for ſecuring cattle during the incurſions of the Scots. Biſhop Bainbrigg granted to the convent a confirmatory charter of Muggleſwick, and alſo of two hundred and ſixteen acres of wood and waſte lands in the vill of Horſeleyhope, given to them by biſhop Kirkham, with licence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe and empark the ſame, accompanied with an inſpeximus of his predeceſſors ſeveral grants<note n="*" place="bottom">Bainbrigg Rot.

                     <p>Several Roman antiquities have been found here, which are taken notice of by Dr Hunter in the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Tranſactions, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 278. One of theſe is a tall altar, but no viſible inſcription upon it. Another is ſaid to be a man in a Roman dreſs, upon a graveſtone near the church door. The image is very obſcure, nor do I ſee how it can now be diſcerned, whether male or female, for there is no inſcription at all, and the features are quite gone. There have been two dolphins, one on each ſide the image, which is ſomewhat pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar. When I viewed it, the ſmall figure at the top appeared like a pine-apple, or perhaps a bunch of ears of corn, and that on the ſide of the image ſeemed deſigned for a wreath. I doubt not but it has been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchral, and that the image was intended to repreſent the perſon deceaſed. <q>When the ancients erected their own tombs in their life time, they often left the inſcriptions, and ſometimes their eſſigies, to be cut by their relations or friends after their deceaſe. So Gorius<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Gor. Monument. libert. &amp;c. Liv. Aug. p. 20.</note>, in his deſcription of a large funeral vault, lately
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:0782100202:455"/>diſcovered near Rome, has given us the draught of a marble coffin, with a buſt of the deceaſed perſon cut upon the ſide, but only a round ball for the head, which doubtleſs was deſigned to have been after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards finiſhed. And upon another there is a whole human figure finiſhed except the head, which is left in the ſame manner with the former. And in ſeveral of the niches made in the ſide of the monument, which contained two urns, the inſcription is cut over one only, and that part of the ſtone which is placed over the other is empty, the perſon being then living for whom that urn was deſigned.</q>

                     <p>This according to the account in Camden, was alſo found in this place. It is a ſmall altar erected to the local god <hi>Vitires,</hi> to whom we find a good number of altars inſcribed.

On one ſide of the altar is a boar, and a toad on the other. It may deſerve to be conſidered, why theſe noxious creatures ſhould be repreſented on altars: Whether it might be, that they who erected the altars were much moleſted with them, and addreſt to the deities to be delivered from them. <q>Tis well known that the ancients uſed to addreſs to different deities for different benefits, and aſcribe names to them ſuited to the favours which they imagined they received from them.

                     <p>We are alſo told in Camden, that an urn was found here of a very uncommon ſhape, near a yard high, and not above ſeven inches wide, with a little cup in the heart of it, perhaps for an oblation of tears, or of wine and milk, ſuch as the Romans uſed at the burying of their dead.</p>
                     <p>Several ſtones of the centurial kind have been found here. One was diſcovered a few days before I came there, and is very clear and diſtinct, having been erected by the fifth cohort of ſome legion; moſt likely of the <hi>Legio ſexta victrix.</hi>

                     <p>There is another centurial ſtone, which I have repreſented at large, in order to ſhew that theſe ſtones were generally like what maſons call <hi>through ſtones,</hi> or however that they were very long, and went a great way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wall, twice or thrice as far as the other facing ſtones. Sometimes they are as this, in the form of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelopepid, and ſometimes of a pyramidal. I can make nothing out of the letters which appear on this.</p>

                     <p>Mr Horſley has placed this amongſt the inſcriptions and ſculptures of Northumberland, and ſays it was of Mr Warburton's collection, and is now in the library at Durham. From whence it came, or where it was found, he does not certainly know.—Rom. Britan. Obſerv. 233. But Dr Hunter tells us it was taken out of the corner of a barn at Ebcheſter, by the direction of Dr Montague, late dean of Durham, to be preſerved in the library at Durham. Mr Horſley ſays, I can't find that this ſtone has ever been publiſhed before, tho' it certainly has been curious when perfect. It has been plainly the face of an altar, and not only the capital and baſe, but part of the plane itſelf is alſo demoliſhed; for a line or more has been broken off the top, and two or three letters at leaſt from every line on the left ſide. <hi>Actarius</hi> was an officer who uſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide corn for the forces.</p>

                        <hi>Vindomora</hi> nine miles diſtant from <hi>Corſtopitum,</hi> according to the Itinerary, and this next ſtation at Ebcheſter is diſtant from Corbridge about ſeven computed miles, and near ten meaſured, as was found on actual men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuration with a chain. This, therefore, is no doubt <hi>Vindomora:</hi> And here again, as in almoſt all caſes, the Roman miles fall ſhort in number of our Engliſh meaſured, almoſt one in ten, which confirms the Roman to be horizontal. The people told me of two or three load of burnt aſhes found here, with ſome large bones and teeth. The Roman inſcriptions and monuments that have been found here may be ſeen in the collection.</p>
                     <p>[In the year 1728, a countryman with his plough fixed upon ſomewhat he could not overturn, he opened the earth, and found an oblong ſquare ſtone, which by more aſſiſtance was removed, finding under it a cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, compoſed of ſix erected ſtones, the interſtices walled up, and therein an urn about eight inches in height <note n="(a)" place="bottom">What is included within the brackets are Dr Hunter's MS. obſervations on the margin of the Britannia, penes Leo, Hartley.</note>.] Dr Gale ſeems to think that <hi>Vindolana</hi> and <hi>Vindolande</hi> in Ravennas are the ſame with <hi>Vindomora</hi> in the Itinerary; and then from the affinity of the ſound concludes <hi>Dolande</hi> to be it: But I believe the name is <hi>Dotland,</hi> and this is rather too near <hi>Corſtopitum,</hi> even though we ſhould prefer the copy that is five miles for the diſtance inſtead of nine. But to wave theſe ſmaller matters, it is certain that <hi>Vindomora</hi> and <hi>Vindo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lana</hi> are two different places, and that <hi>Dotland</hi> can neither be one nor the other, for this is quite off the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary way, and there is no appearance of Roman antiquity here.

                  </note>. We paid attention to the great Roman road which leads to this place from the ſouthward, and found it remarkably perfect where the new incloſures of common lands had not taken place. We traced it for a conſiderable diſtance, ſo as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us ſtrictly to aſcertain the dimenſions: It is formed in three diſtinct parts, with four ditches; a center road, probably made for carriages and cavalry, forty-two feet in width, with a narrow road on each ſide for foot paſſengers, twelve feet wide: As we had not obſerved this form in any of the roads in Northumberland, or on the line of the wall, it made us more attentive to aſcertain the matter.

in this northern ſituation the circumſtance here increaſes our ideas of the Roman power and poſſeſſion, when ſuch a ſtation as Ebcheſter required ſuch conveniencies, either for the eaſe of paſſengers, or to accommodate troops who ſhould line the roads and guard the forage or the baggage of armies.</p>

               <p>About the year 1690, that great patron of manufactory and trade, Sir Ambroſe Crawley, fixed upon this ſituation to eſtabliſh thoſe works which have employed multitudes of people, and cauſed an influx of wealth ſince that happy aera, to this country: He firſt ſat down at Sunderland by the ſea, where, in its infancy, the project was nurſed for five or ſix years, but the ſituation of this place and its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virons, both in regard to coals and water, induced him to tranſplant his Cyclopean colony hither. The town of Winlayton ſtands on a high ridge of country, inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the eaſt, north, and ſouth towards the rivers Tyne and Derwent. Before Sir Ambroſe ſettled his people here, the place conſiſted of a few deſerted cottages, and now contains about fifteen hundred inhabitants, chiefly ſmiths. The works carried on in this town are various; making nails is the chief branch, but there is an eye of jealouſy on enquiry, and the traveller can reap little information as to the various articles manufactured, or quantity produced. The buildings are regular, and calculated for convenience and not ſhew: The ſtreets are well paved. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious chapel was built in the year 1705, which will receive three hundred peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at divine ſervice, and a ſtipend provided for a chaplain <note n="§" place="bottom">
                     <p>The chapel is ſaid to be erected on the ſcite of an old chapel, dedicated to St Ann, deſtroyed in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of the earl of Weſtmoreland: Human bones have been repeatedly dug up, when there was occaſion to break the ſoil to any depth.</p>

                     <p>An account of the re-building of Winlaton chapel was printed in London in 1711, to which is prefixed a letter of lord Crewe's, dated from Durham caſtle, 23d of September, 1710, ſetting forth, that Mr Jonathan Story had been very inſtrumental in that work. The narrative is addreſſed to Henry lord Hyde, by Mr Story, and comprehends an oration delivered by him to the people on occaſion of an attempt to found a diſſenting meeting-houſe at Winlaton, where he repreſents were ſettled in the manufactory above two thouſand ſouls. Mr Story, though not of the church, in his oration firſt expatiated on the excellency of religion in general; ſecond, the advantage it hath in the minds of men; third, the excellency of the Chriſtian religion in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and laſtly, full thoughts on the eſtabliſhed church of England; and he recapitulates the circumſtances attending the year 1641, and the ſucceeding times, with much warmth.—The firſt place for p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

A ſubſcription was next ſet on foot for building the chapel, which was begun the 17th of April, 1705; on the 23d of Auguſt following it was fit to receive the congregation; and in January following it was fully finiſhed and beautified, regularly pewed, and a large gallery at the weſt end, with a turret and clock: Daily ſervice is performed therein.</p>

which in the laſt century was uſed for corn, and had a few cottages near it, now is ſurrounded with a conſiderable village, where the iron works are alſo carried on. It is in a pleaſant ſituation, on the banks of Derwent, with an open proſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the eaſt; the number of people employed there may amount to about three hundred of all ages: A ſtone in the mill dam ſhews the propitious year of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, 1691. The chief work carried on there is making and grinding edge tools, ſlitting bars of iron into long narrow pieces, proper for making nails, &amp;c.

                  <q>After theſe works were brought to anſwer the proprietor's view, his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence dictated to him that it was neceſſary to inſtitute a code of laws for the eſtabliſhment of peace and good order; not only calculated for the profit and uſe of the maſter, but the eaſe, tranquillity, and happineſs of the ſervant; thoſe, after amendments and additions as caſes and exigencies dictated, have become certain and eſtabliſhed. To put thoſe laws in execution, a court of arbitrators was conſtituted at Winlaton, to be holden every ten weeks, for hearing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining caſes among the workmen, to which all have an appeal. The fees are fixed beyond innovation, at a moderate rate. This inſtitution has the moſt happy and extenſive uſe, it quiets the differences of the people, protects their claims to juſtice in an eaſy and expeditious manner, preſerves them from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences and diſtreſs of common law, and the noiſome miſeries of a priſon. As a further protection of civilization, to promote good manners, and inſpire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious principles, ſchools are eſtabliſhed at Winlaton, Winlaton mill, and Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, for the ſole benefit of the workmen's children, where they are inſtructed in reading, writing, and accounts. The poor and diſtreſſed were objects of the founder's ſolicitude; he appointed a ſurgeon for the relief of the whole body of workmen, by whoſe timely aſſiſtance many lives and limbs have been preſerved to the public: When a workman is ill, he has money advanced by the agent; when ſuperannuated or diſabled, he has a weekly maintenance; and when he dies, his family is provided for.</q> What eulogium can be ſuitable to the benevolence here diſplayed, or panegyric expreſs the virtues thus exerciſed! The exulting ſpirits of thouſands daily breathe praiſes before Heaven, which no language can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. Our correſpondent adds, <q>It is in tears the country confeſs, none of this excellent family of the name of Crawley at preſent exiſt. Mrs Theodoſia Crawley, relict of John Crawley, <abbr>eſq</abbr> the laſt of the name, died on the 7th of May, 1782, aet. 88. There is no doubt her ſucceſſors will tread in the ſame ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and benevolent ſteps.</q>

From its eminence the ſouth front of the houſe commands a view of the country adjoining Whickham, and the rich wood-lands of Gibſide; the eaſt front a proſpect of the buſy Tyne, Benwell, Newcaſtle, Gateſhead, and the ſhipping below the bridge; the new bridge of Swalwell of three arches, and the village on the front ground to the right. The old family houſe was called <hi>Whitehouſe,</hi> and ſtood at the diſtance of half a mile to the weſtward of the preſent manſion, in a ſequeſtered ſituation.

               </head>
               <p>The firſt account we have of the manor of Whickham is in the Boldon Book, where the biſhop had xxxv villain tenants, each of whom held an oxgang of land, conſiſting of fifteen acres, at ſixteen pence rent, excluſive of ſervices, which were ſevere. Every villain wrought for the lord three days each week in the year, beſides the labour of harveſt and plowing; they were bound to erect a cottage forty feet long, and fifteen wide, every year, for the maintenance of the town, and carry and fetch from Durham and Bedlington, the biſhop's baggage, &amp;c. when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, with the allowance of the corrody whilſt they wrought. They alſo paid nine ſhillings cornage rent, and provided a milch cow for the lord, and for every oxgang of land they found a hen and ten eggs, and ſerved in the lord's fiſhery in Tyne. The headborough man, who is ſtiled <hi>praepoſitus,</hi> now called the greve, had twenty-four acres of land allotted to him in recompenſe for the duties of his office. The manor was then under firm with the villain ſervice, mills, carts, barrows, fiſheries, and twenty chalder of oats of the biſhop's meaſure, rendering twenty-ſeven pounds, and performing certain ſervices in carriage, for which there was an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of two pence for every horſe. The punder had land aſſigned him, beſides an acknowledgement from every tillage farm by the threave; and he provided the biſhop with forty hens and three hundred eggs. In biſhop Bury's time we find one Robert Bridock held ſome ſmall parcels of land here, by homage and xs. rent at the biſhop's exchequer<note n="*" place="bottom">

The chief parts of the manſion-houſe are old, of the architecture which prevailed in the beginning of the ſeventeenth century, containing many ſpacious apartments: The back part of the houſe is placed ſo near the brink of a very ſteep deſcent, as merely to admit a terrace walk; from whence is a proſpect, though narrow, highly pictureſque and beautiful; you look down into a deep vale of meadow grounds, waſhed by the river Derwent, ſhut in on the right by hanging woods, and on the left by cultivated lands riſing in irregular ſwells from the banks of the river, and terminated in the center by a lofty cliff much ſhaken and torn: Walks are cut through the groves, and wind along the margin of the river: Although nature has ſpread various rich gifts over the ſcene, yet art has beſtowed a multitude of embelliſhments; the buildings before mentioned, the green-houſe, bath, and other edifices, are finiſhed in a good taſte, and ſome of them in a ſuperb ſtile; with regard to the ſylvan beauties, they are not to be paralleled in the whole county.</p>
               <p>There are ſome good pictures in the houſe; among the chief is a large piece of Rubens's wife, whilſt pregnant, in a fruit-ſhop; the expreſſion is inimitable, yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be rivalled by the curioſity of the old woman ſhe addreſſes; the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of fruit is infinite, and well diſplayed. A picture of game, the painter's name not known, the figures large as life; an excellent painting. In the ſtudy is a fine portrait of Sir Martin Bowes. A portrait, marked A. Bowes, 1572, aet. 49, with many other modern portraits of the family.</p>

               <p>The ancient borough of Gateſhead conſiſts chiefly of one long ſtreet, deſcending to the bridge leading over Tyne to Newcaſtle: Much doubt has aroſe with our antiquaries touching the etymology of the name. It muſt content us to accept the Saxon appellation of Gaetsheved as ſufficiently expreſſive of this place; where, if the Romans had a bridge, it is probable they alſo had a tower and gate for its defence; and after the Saxons were poſſeſſors, we may conceive this material paſs was ſtrongly fortified, and thence the name of <hi>Gaetſheved</hi> may be derived, from the circumſtance of the ſtreet leading to the tower and gate of the bridge. The word <hi>gaet</hi> or <hi>gate</hi> is commonly uſed for <hi>way</hi> in this country <note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </note>. In the latter is a tranſcript from the former, where, among the holy men choſen by Peada, ſon of king Penda, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him in the Chriſtian religion, one <hi>Adda is mentioned, who is there ſaid to be brother to Uttan, an illuſtrious preſbyter and abbot of the monaſtery called Goatſhead:</hi> Tanner likewiſe cites Bourne, who in his Hiſtory of Newcaſtle ſays, <hi>the monaſtery of Uttanus was where Mr Riddle's or Gateſhead houſe now is.</hi> From the following paſſage in Leland's Itinerary, vol. vii. part i. page 78, added to the entry before quoted from Dugdale's Catalogue, it appears as if this monaſtery was converted into an hoſpital before the diſſolution of religious houſes; <hi>whereas the hoſpital</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is now of St Edmund at Gateſhed in Wyrale, was ſome tyme a monaſtary as I have hard, and be lykelyhod the ſame that Bede ſpekythe of.</hi> In the Magna Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, publiſhed in 1720, a different relation is given of this houſe, to that taken

From theſe obſcure accounts little to be depended upon can be collected reſpecting its ancient hiſtory; the following is its preſent ſtate: Its remains ſtand in Gateſhead, on the eaſt or right hand ſide of the high ſtreet leading to Newcaſtle bridge, from which it is diſtant about half a mile. The entrance is through a low ſquare ſtone gate, decorated with pilaſters, and ſeemingly of modern conſtruction. The ſcite of the houſe with its offices and gardens, occupied about two acres and a half of land: Towards the eaſt end of it are the ruins of a manſion, which, from the ſtile of its architecture, ſeems to have been built ſince the diſſolution of the monaſtery, perhaps out of its materials. This probably was Mr Riddle's houſe alluded to by Bourne, and the gateway before mentioned was in all likelihood erected at the ſame time. Neareſt the road ſtands the chapel, whoſe weſt end is handſomely ornamented with a number of pointed arches and niches, though the inſide ſeems remarkably plain: It conſiſts of a ſingle aile, twenty-one paces broad, by twenty-ſix long; ſome ſteps at the eaſt end leading to the altar are ſtill remaining; near them is a grave ſtone, on which is cut a croſs ſimilar to that on the jamb of the church door at Jarrow; it has alſo the marks of an inlaid border about it, but the braſs is gone. The arches of the windows (except thoſe of the eaſt and weſt ends, which are entirely pointed) are round within, and pointed on the outſide. A remarkable ornament is mounted on the eaſt end, on a ſlender rod, being a ſmall circle chequered by ſeveral bars croſſing each other at right angles. In the year 1745 or 46, this chapel, being, as it is ſaid, made uſe of by the Roman Catholics, was out of a miſguided zeal ſet on fire by ſome perſons, who perhaps meant to paſs for good Proteſtants, but by this their intolerant fury, ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be actuated by thoſe very principles they affected ſo much to contemn. This monaſtery is now the property of Ralph Clavering, <abbr>eſq</abbr> of Callaly, and is chiefly uſed for garden ground <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>This account is attended with an elegant view of the chapel.</p>
                        <p>The houſe and garden ground, &amp;c. were purchaſed about two years ago by Hen. Elliſon, <abbr>eſq</abbr>—The mines were reſerved upon this ſale.</p>

               <p>This account gives us ground to ſuppoſe, that on the martyrdom of biſhop Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, the old monaſtery and church were reduced to aſhes; but whether they were ſituated where Mr Groſe has attempted to place them, the reader will form his own conjectures. In the quotation from the Magna Britannia, it is ſaid, touching the hoſpital of St Edmund, "who was the founder or benefactor is not known." It is probable that the ruined monaſtery, which had been a ſcene of ſuch violation, ſacrilege, and murder, would lie under the horror of thoſe crimes, deſerted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtored for ſome time; and it was not till the year 1247 that we hear of the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital riſing, as Mr Groſe has preſumed, from its aſhes. In that year, biſhop Farnham founded <hi>the hoſpital of St Edmund the Confeſſor in Gateſhead,</hi> for a maſter

From this deed it may be underſtood, by implication, that the hoſpital had been a ſecond time erected before the time of this charter: The original conſtitution was totally altered, and indeed one may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that the firſt foundation was utterly diſſolved; who had again begun this pious work, or when, we have no record to ſhew. This charter tells us the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which evidenced the foundation and endowment were loſt; ſuch could not be the caſe if it aroſe from the original inſtitution by biſhop Farnham; the more modern foundation, in the diſtraction of thoſe times which intervened between the year 1535 and 1610, might probably be loſt or deſtroyed; and this obſervation gains ſtrength by the reference in the charter to <hi>ſixty years quiet enjoyment, by the maſter appointed thereby and his predeceſſors,</hi> expreſſions not only uſeleſs, but repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to common ſenſe, if the hoſpital was inſtantly riſing under that charter.

There is an irreconcilable confuſion in this ſubject, and we are apt to believe there were two religious foundations here dedicated as before noted, one to St Edmund the confeſſor, appropriated to St Bartholomew in Newcaſtle, which was diſſolved under the ſurrender of that monaſtery, and another of a foundation now unknown, which had been exempted from the diſſolution, and refounded by king James, dedicated to St Edmund king and martyr, notwithſtanding the complex deſcription of lands, &amp;c. in the royal charter.

               <p>TYNE BRIDGE in part appertains to the county of Durham: It is of great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and ſeveral authors of note have ſuppoſed the Romans had an open com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between their ſtations on the northern and ſouthern ſhores of Tyne at this place.

                  <q>After this misfortune happened, the town, who repairs two-thirds of the bridge, and the biſhop the other, laid out their endeavours to raiſe up another bridge of ſtone: Accordingly the biſhop of Durham ſent out indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, and the town procured other biſhops to do the ſame, to all that would aſſiſt, either with money or labour, by which they got a ſum ſufficient. The archdeacon of Northumberland wrote to the clergy of his archdeaconry to aſſiſt the work of the bridge; telling them, their venerable father the lord biſhop of Durham by his letters patent had commanded them without any let or delay, to go about the affair of the indulgences, and that they were to prefer the epiſcopal indulgences to others; and what aroſe from them was to be given to the maſter of the bridge, whoſe name was Laurentius, for the uſe of the bridge. <hi>Lib.

the river Tyne and the bridge and tower thereupon <note n="*" place="bottom">See Annals of biſhop Langley, vol. i. p. 333, records in the notes.</note>. About the year 1512 biſhop Ruthall repaired the ſouth part of the bridge. Under the act of diſſolution of 1553, all the poſſeſſions of the biſhopric were veſted in the crown, and by the act of the ſucceeding year, when Gateſhead was annexed to Newcaſtle, the lands called Salt Meadows, with the whole river of Tyne and the bridge paſſed therewith, and were adjudged to be within the county and ſhire of the town of Newcaſtle, and that the inhabitants of Gateſhead ſhould be under the rule, government, and correction of the mayor and burgeſſes of Newcaſtle. All theſe were reſtored in 1554, as before mentioned. The bridge, after the conflagration in 1248, was rebuilt on twelve ſtone arches, three of which, by the conſtruction of quays, on the Newcaſtle ſide, were thought unneceſſary, and converted into cellars: About the middle of the bridge a tower was erected, with machicolations and iron gates; a little to the ſouthward of which the boundary ſtone was fixed, to diſtinguiſh the diviſion of the counties; the end from thence to Gateſhead belonging to the biſhop of Durham. At the ſouth end was another tower, and from the vacancy in the archings, there wanting an arch near the ſouthern tower, it has been preſumed there was in that ſpace a draw-bridge. The biſhops of Durham have for time immemorial poſſeſſed all rights and privileges of the bridge, from the boundary ſtone ſouthwards, being called a third part, and granted leaſes for lives or years, of all houſes and ſhops erected thereon, and as occaſion required repaired that part of the bridge. In July 1770, biſhop Trevor repaired with ſtone the ſpace before noted, where it is ſuppoſed the draw-bridge was; it was laid with large beams of timber, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thick planks, upon which the pavement was made: This work was begun on Saturday night or Sunday morning, and finiſhed on Thurſday following, all the materials of ſtone being previouſly prepared, and a proper number of workmen, with boats and wherries above and below bridge, for conveying paſſengers and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages over the river during the time of the work. In the night between the 16th and 17th of November, 1771, there was a flood in the river Tyne, greatly exceeding any noted in hiſtory or otherwiſe known, by the force of which an arch north of the toll-gate was firſt ſwept away<note n="†" place="bottom">A curious view of the ruined bridge was engraved and publiſhed by Mr Beilby of Newcaſtle.</note>, then another on the ſouth end fell, with eight houſes on the weſt ſide of it, thoſe on the eaſt hanging by their timbers. On Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 18th, about four in the afternoon, another of the ſouth arches fell, with the houſes thereon, and the remaining parts of the bridge were ſo much ſhattered, that it was neceſſary to take the ſuperſtructure down. Only ſeven perſons were loſt by the fall of the ſeveral houſes. The river began to riſe at Newcaſtle about twelve o'clock on Saturday night, and at five in the morning the arches of the bridge were filled, ſo that a current was forced into the weſt end of the ſtreet called the Cloſe, which runs parallel with the river; it overflowed the Sandhill-ſquare, ſo that boats plied there, and many of the ſhops had five feet water in them: The water exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every other flood of which we have any note; by eight perpendicular feet in height; and infinite loſs and damage was ſuſtained on the ſhores and in the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and craft. In 1772 an act of parliament was obtained for making a temporary
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:0782100202:493"/>
bridge, by the corporate body of Newcaſtle, to continue for ſeven years, (provided a new one of ſtone was not erected, or the old bridge reſtored in leſs time) with toll-gates thereon, and the tolls to be applied in reimburſing to the corporation ſuch money as they ſhould expend therein over and above the ſum of 2400l. which they voluntarily gave to the work: And in the ſame year an act of parliament was made to enable the lord biſhop of Durham and his ſucceſſors to raiſe a competent ſum of money, to be applied for repairing, improving, or rebuilding ſuch part of Tyne bridge as belongs to the See of Durham. The preamble ſets forth, that the lord biſhop of Durham is entitled in right of his See, to one-third part of an ancient bridge extending acroſs the river Tyne, between the town of Gateſhead in the county palatine of Durham, and the town of Newcaſtle upon Tyne; and that by the violence and rapidity of a moſt extraordinary flood, which happened on the 17th day of November, 1771, in the river Tyne, the ſaid bridge was damaged and broken down in ſeveral places, and rendered impaſſable: And in order to reſtore an eaſy and ſafe communication between the counties of Durham and Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, it is highly expedient that the ſaid bridge ſhould be rebuilt, and effectually repaired with all poſſible expedition; and that the neceſſary repairs of one-third part of the ſaid bridge, belonging to the biſhop of Durham in right of his See, and extending from two blue marble or boundary ſtones, on the ſouth ſide of the ſaid bridge, to the town of Gateſhead, will be attended with great expence, and however reaſonable or proper it may be, that the entire ſum neceſſary to be appropriated for, and employed in that uſeful and neceſſary work, ought to be raiſed out of or ſecured upon the revenues and poſſeſſions of the ſaid See of Durham, and that the biſhop of Durham for the time being, ought not to bear any greater burthen than ſhall ariſe from the intereſt or annual charge to be paid in reſpect of the principal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be raiſed for the purpoſe aforeſaid; yet the ſaid lord biſhop conſenting, that a reaſonable and adequate ſum of money may be raiſed by authority of parliament, by granting annuities for lives, which will not only be ſpeedy and effectual, but may be a method leſs burthenſome to the ſucceſſors in the ſaid See than to the ſaid now lord biſhop, by the eventual dropping in of lives and the decreaſe of ſuch temporary charge; it is thereby enacted, that the chancellor of the biſhopric and county palatine of Durham and Sadberge, the ſheriff of the county, &amp;c. the vicar-general and principal official of the dioceſe of Durham, the attorney and ſolicitor general to the lord biſhop of Durham, the principal regiſter or regiſtrar of the dioceſe of Durham, the auditor to the lord biſhop of Durham, the keeper of Auck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land caſtle, the ſteward of the halmote courts of the lord biſhop of Durham, the clerk of the halmote courts of the lord biſhop of Durham, the clerk of the great receipt of the exchequer of Durham, the regiſter of the court of chancery of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the clerk of the court of chancery of Durham, the keeper of the rolls of the chancery aforeſaid, the clerk of the itinerant juſtices and other juſtices whomſoever in the county palatine of Durham and Sadberge, and the bailiff of the borough of Auckland for the time being, or any three of them, are thereby appointed truſtees to put the ſaid act in execution, by and under the direction of the biſhop and his ſucceſſors, for repairing, rebuilding, or improving ſuch part of the ſaid bridge as
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:0782100202:494"/>
belongs to the See of Durham: And to raiſe any ſum not exceeding 12,000 l. for the purpoſes aforeſaid, by granting annuities not exceeding 10 l. per cent. to be paid by the receiver-general of the biſhop and his ſucceſſors, out of the revenues of the See of Durham.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of this act a new bridge has been erected on an elegant plan, and no houſes are permitted to be built on the piers or battlements.</p>

               <p>GATESHEAD CHURCH is a ſpacious building, capable of receiving a very numerous congregation, and kept in that order due to places of divine worſhip: It is very light, and receives a good circulation of air: The chancel, from the altar rails, is nine paces long and ſix wide; the eaſt window conſiſting of five lights; there are alſo three windows to the ſouth, and two to the north, under pointed arches: The communion table is ſupported by cherubs, in ſtone work; near which are three receſſes or ſeats in the wall within the rails, for prieſts officiating in the ancient ſervice, and an aperture for a water baſon. This church is built upon a regular plan, in the form of a croſs, with ſide ailes, ſeparated from the center by five point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arches, ſupported on octagonal columns about fifteen feet high, very light and well proportioned, having this ſingularity, that they are without capitals, the arches ſpringing from the ſhafts, like the ramifications of a tree, which gives them a beautiful appearance; the arches are about ſixteen feet in ſpan: The whole length of the nave is twenty-eight paces, and its width ſixteen; the croſs aile is twenty-four paces long. The ſouth end of the croſs is lighted by one large window of five lights,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:0782100202:495"/>
and two to the eaſt of three lights each; the ailes have each two ſquare windows of three lights: The upper arrangements are regular, conſiſting of five windows un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der circular arches. The church is regularly ſtalled with oak, ornamented with fleur-de-lis, has a pretty ſmall organ, and galleries at the weſt end: The font is a large black marble laver: The pulpit is placed againſt the firſt ſouth pillar. The adjacent ground is called the Anchorage or Anchoritage, where the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe ſtands, with the beadle's houſe and other edifices belonging the church. The ſteeple was rebuilt in 1740<note n="*" place="bottom">

In the church-yard is the monument of one Robert Trollop, a famous architect; it is a ſquare building, the lower part of brick, the upper of ſtone, and of that heavy taſte which prevailed about the time of king James I. when Trollop lived. It was embelliſhed around the top under the cornice with ſeveral ſcripture paſſages, in gold letters on a black ground,

The Pariſh of <hi>JARROW.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>We now approach Jarrow, once a place of great conſequence, and of diſtant antiquity. Little more remained of this once famous town when we viſited it in 1782, than two or three mean cottages, the diſtracted ruins of the old monaſtery, the church, a venerable pile, then patched up ſo as to retain few traces of its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal figure, and the capacious haven, now called the <hi>Slake,</hi> waſhed full of ſand, and left dry by the river Tyne at ebb of tide.</p>
               <p>The monaſteries of Weremouth and Jarrow were the moſt ancient of any within the limits of this county: That of Weremouth, dedicated to St Peter, we are told, was built in the fourth year of king Egfrid, at the inſtance of Benedict a monk, who became the ſuperior or governor of both houſes: The monaſtery of Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, dedicated to St Paul, was erected in the fifteenth year of the ſame king; the place being then called <hi>Gyrwy</hi> or <hi>Girvy.</hi> Retirement and ſecluſion were not the principles which directed the choice of this ſituation; for if the original mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery was placed where the preſent ruins are, the ground is elevated, and forms a curvature towards the great bay called the Slake, which ancient authors tell us was the haven of Egfrid, where, conſiſtent with the burthen of veſſels uſed in that age, a thouſand ſail might lie moored in the greateſt ſecurity.

habitation and church: But their peace was not of long continuance; for in the ſeventh year of Oſbert's reign, the Danes again entered the Tyne, practiſing their accuſtomed rapine and devaſtation, and laying waſte all the religious houſes. In the interval, whilſt the See or epiſcopal ſeat was fixed at Cheſter, we may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably preſume the monaſtery at Jarrow was again reſtored; and from the ſtile and order of architecture, we are led to conjecture, that part of the ſtructures ſtanding at the time we viſited them, were of that age: But the religious body had not yet ſuſtained the laſt of their misfortunes, for though ſubject to all the miſeries of the provincial war which diſtracted this part of the iſland, during the ſtruggles between the Saxon and Daniſh ſovereigns, when they were frequently pillaged and laid under contributions. Upon the enraged Normans marching northward, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the city of Durham deſerted, and the country evacuated, they put their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious hands to this monaſtery, and notwithſtanding they boaſted of the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the goſpel, yet, as ſavage as the unenlightened barbarians of the north, they reduced the ſacred edifices again to aſhes. Having advanced to this period, we ſhould now pay attention to the venerable character of Bede, and preſent to the reader ſome ſhort anecdotes of his life.</p>
               <p>This holy monk was born about the year 672, in a part of this county adjoining the river Were, where the monaſtery of Weremouth afterwards had lands; that houſe not being founded till the year 674, according to his own account thereof: Much controverſy has happened relative to the place of his nativity, but it is well ſettled by hiſtorians, that he was born in the diſtrict before mentioned: At ſeven years of age he was taken into the monaſtery at Weremouth, and under the care of abbot Benedict and his ſucceſſor Ceolfrid received his education; at the age of nineteen was ordained deacon, and became exemplary at that early ſtage for his piety and ſtudious life: The attention paid to him by all ranks of people, ſo far from moving him with vanity, or tempting him to negligence, ſeemed only to excite him to a more eager purſuit of learning, and ſtricter rules of religious conduct, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that his character was held forth as a pattern of Chriſtian virtues, and his life as an example of monaſtic duty. About the year 685, in the fifteenth of king Egfrid, the monaſtery of Jarrow was founded under the conduct and ſuperintendency of Benedict: Bede attained his thirtieth year before he was ordained prieſt, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was performed by John of Beverley, then biſhop of Hexham, who had been his preceptor, and entertained great affection for him; much of his excellent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter was deduced from maxims inſtilled by that great teacher, which he conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſed to follow as the chief principles of his conduct. His great diligence and application, comprehenſive genius, and extenſive learning, rendered his name ſo famous, that he became the ſubject of attention in foreign countries, particularly at Rome, where pope Sergius, ſtruck with the accounts he heard of this illuſtrious ſcholar, wrote to his ſuperior the abbot Ceolfrid to ſend him thither, that he might converſe with him on ſome momentous ſubjects. Bede, as ſingular in his modeſty as accompliſhments, received the ſummons without any of that emotion this flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtinction would have rouſed in many other minds; but attentive alone to his ſtudies, and the due performance of religious duties, he was not to be allured from
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:0782100202:501"/>
his cell by the ſmiles of potentates, and the courteſy of princes. It has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked by many authors, that in purſuance of Ceolfrid's command, he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained prieſt preparatory to his journey to Rome; but why he did not obey the call, has not been accounted for by thoſe writers, further than that it is obſerved the pope died in 701, which event might not be known in England at the time of our monk's receiving ordination. No notice is taken of the foregoing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances by Bede in any of his writings, and the whole reſts chiefly on the account given by William of Malmſbury and his copyiſts. It is certain he ſhewed at all times a particular deſire for privacy and retirement, an avidity for learning, and an inceſſant application to ſtudy, together with a warm affection for his native country; ſuch might operate powerfully with his own mind againſt the journey, whilſt the conſequence he was of to the northern clergy, might influence the great people to ſue for his releaſe from an engagement ſo diſagreeable to his own wiſhes; and contrary to the intereſts of his country. By remaining in his monaſtery, and habituating himſelf to a recluſe life, he had ſufficient time to make himſelf maſter of every branch of literature which at that period had gained a footing in this iſland; and his acquiſitions were made without any apparent deſire of ſame or promotion, but merely to render himſelf uſeful to ſociety, and for the promotion of religion and virtue. It was from ſuch principles that he applied himſelf for ſeveral years in collecting materials for his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, which received in the early ages of the Engliſh church infinite applauſe, and at this time is eſteemed an ineſtimable record; in the compoſition of which great work the ſeveral legendary and miraculous relations are conſidered as merely the errors of the age, and not blots of the excellent pen which related them. Though Bede was bred at Weremouth, yet it is admitted by all writers he took up his reſidence at Jarrow, ſoon after that monaſtery was founded, and the ſame ſuperior govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both houſes, much intercourſe was had between the religious ſocieties; ſo that we ſee him at periods ſpoken of by ſome writers as a monk of Weremouth, and by others of Jarrow, which variance is eaſily reconciled when we conſider the before-related fact. Bede publiſhed his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory in 731, when, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own account, he was fifty-nine years of age; but before this he had written many other books, on a variety of ſubjects, a catalogue of which he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined to that great work. There was a ſtrict friendſhip ſubſiſting between Egbert biſhop of York and Bede, which produced a letter from our monk, deſcriptive of the tempers and characters of both, and giving a picture of the manners of the age, and the ſtate of the church, ſuch as no other authority ſupplies; full of ſervour, religious cenſure, virtuous zeal, and bold condemnation. The letter diſcovers the collective mind of the author, whilſt his prophetic reaſonings and the diſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences he deduced and predicted from the inordinances deſcribed, ſhew the ſhrewdneſs of his judgment, and the capaciouſneſs of his obſervation: He foreſaw the multiplying of religious foundations, and the want of diſcipline which daily broke in upon the conventual rules, would bring on the deſtruction which in after ages took place. When he wrote this epiſtle he was in a bad ſtate of health, his death from that time advancing by a gradual decay; yet in all the progreſſive
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:0782100202:502"/>
ſtages of the diſeaſe he did not neglect his duty, he employed the uſual hours in writing, in ſtudy, in devotion, in exhortation of the brethren, and teaching his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the convent. He endured the attacks of death with great fortitude, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary piety, and holy reſignation, and expired on the 26th of May, being the feaſt of the Aſcenſion, in the year 735 <note n="*" place="bottom">Epilogum de obitu Bedae, ex ſine libri 1<hi rend="sup">i</hi> Gulielm. a Maildulphi curia de reg.—Script.

               <p>Soon after biſhop Walcher was ſettled in the See, he invited certain Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictines to take up their abode at Jarrow; they found the monaſtic buildings in ruin, though it appears ſome walls were yet ſtanding, over which they formed a roof of wood, and thatched it with ſtraw, where they renewed divine offices. The ſociety increaſing rapidly, the biſhop granted various lands for their ſupport, and they began to rebuild their church. The reader will revert to the account given of this ſociety under the annals of biſhop Walcher. Biſhop William de Carilepho confirmed to the monks of Jarrow the endowment made by his predeceſſor; and ſoon after removing the ſeculars from the cathedral church, he tranſlated the monks of this houſe to Durham, and from thenceforth Jarrow became only a cell to the monaſtery of Durham.

The entrance into the church was by a low porch with a circular arch, on the north jamb of which was the figure of a croſier ſtaff, ſtripped from ſome of the ancient tombs: The deſcent into the nave was by three deep ſteps, on the ſide walls of which were two pointed arches, that to the north built up, the other opening into a porch uſed as a veſtry room; the groins were ſprung from brackets, and the ſpan was about twenty feet: The nave was twenty-eight paces in length, and only ſix in width; ſo that, from the height of the ſide walls, which were nearly thirty feet, and the ſmall irregular windows ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on each ſide, the edifice had a very ſingular appearance: Some of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows were under circular arches, others pointed, and all the walling ſo patched and irregular, that it was not to be diſtinguiſhed to what age any particular part of it belonged: The congregation had deſerted the nave for ſome years, perhaps from dread of being buried in its ruins, and the chancel alone was uſed for divine ſervice. Fixed in the ſouth-eaſt corner of the nave was a mount, whereon a ſtone pulpit formerly ſtood. The rood-loft remained, being a gallery of wood work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the church, above the entrance into the chancel, on which were the remains of gaudy painting; here the rood or crucifixion was diſplayed in ancient times, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other paintings or effigies of holy perſonages; and here alſo the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels performed their part in the ſervice.

The argument before the barons of the exchequer in the caſe of Jarrow Slake, upon ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe againſt the decree of that court, and alſo againſt a perpetual injunction to be made for the town of Newcaſtle againſt the dean and chapter aforeſaid.</p>
                           <p>The dean and chapter's council were Mr Sol. General, Mr Serj. Wright, Sir W. Williams Sir T. Powis, Mr Dormer, Mr Brown, Mr Turner, Mr Phipps, and Mr Bowes, to ſhew cauſe againſt the decree made the laſt term, for quieting the plaintiffs in the poſſeſſion of their franchiſes, &amp;c. according to the prayer of their bill, and that the defendants may be ſtopt from erecting any ſhore or wharf at Jarrow Slake. They thereupon inſiſted on theſe three points: 1ſt, That the court ought to make no decree upon this bill, 2d, That they ought not to grant a perpetual injunction. 3d, That before they make their decree abſolute with a perpetual injunction, they ought to grant a new trial, or a reaſonable time to make out a right at law.</p>
                           <p>The rehearſal of theſe arguments is voluminous, I ſhall only ſelect the heads of each ſubject. Newcaſtle preſcribes that no ballaſt wharf was ever erected at Jarrow: A negative preſcription. The thing complained of, is the erection of a public nuiſance upon a public navigable river, for which they alledge no ſpecial right in themſelves but as conſervators: Should have proſecuted in the king's name. They make no title to the ſoil. The decree is to quiet them in all the liberties preſcribed to in the bill, the iſſues related to Jarrow Slake only: The decree would bind the dean and chapter's right in all other parts of the river, and to quiet the plaintiffs in their pretended privileges from Sparhawk to Heddon Streams, fifteen miles. The only ground of their right is the pretended conſervatorſhip; which muſt be derived from the crown, and that by record, which they ſhew not. Second general head: The doctrine of perpetual injunctions. They are new, and nothing found of them in our old books. Originated on trials of ejectment, and deviſed to prevent multiplicity of ſuits for the ſame thing. Judge Hale, the oracle of the law, would never confine a man's right to one trial. It was a new notion for courts of equity to lay ſuch fetters upon the common law. Third general head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Several caſes were cited where new trials were granted, and affidavits of ſeveral records being diſcovered ſince the trial. Counſel then ſtated, 1ſt, That <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> itſelf was a corporation within the time of memory, and ſo incapable of preſcribing time beyond memory. That its ancient name was <hi>Monkcheſter,</hi> and aſſumed the name of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> from the caſtle built there by William Rufus; was afterwards forfeited by Rob. de Mowbray earl of Northumberland, and remained in the crown till king John granted it, which is time within memory, the time of memory being to be computed from the beginning of the reign of king Richard I. 2d, That commiſſions of conſervatorſhip have been frequently granted from the crown to the mayor, &amp;c. whereby it appears they acted from time to time under the crown, and ſo were not conſervators by preſcription. 3d, That the church of Durham has time beyond memory conſtantly enjoyed the ſouth ſide of the river Tyne <hi>uſq. ad filum aquae,</hi> or at leaſt a third part of it, and enjoyed the conſervatorſhip on their own ſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4th, That ballaſt wharfs have not been uſed upon this river for above one hundred years, and ſo cannot be preſcribed to time beyond memory. 5th, That the corporation has claimed them as proprietors of the ſoil, and not as conſervators, &amp;c. Several records were produced and read: 1. A commiſſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatorſhip 45th k. Edw. III. to the mayor and others. 2. Another commiſſion 32d k. Henry VI. directed to the mayor and others for conſervatorſhip of the river inter Sparhawk &amp; Heddon Streams: The very bounds preſcribed to in their bill. 3. K.

By this record the corporation pleads inter alia, that king John and his predeceſſors, kings of England, were time beyond memory ſeiſed of the town of Newcaſtle, and the whole river of Tine, and the whole bridge, and being ſo ſeiſed granted it to them, whereby it appears they derived their original right from king John, which is time
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:0782100202:507"/>within memory. The dean and chapter's council urged this record as an eſtopple againſt their preſcribing in themſelves. 9. Act of parl. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Mariae, for reuniting the town of Gateſhead with the water and bridge to the county palatines juriſdiction, and for repealing the act made 7th king Edw. IV. Beſides the former, many others were ready to be produced. 1. <hi>Recordatio marchiarum,</hi> which Mr Serj. Wright adviſed not to produce, becauſe it appearing thereby that the earl of Northumberland was ſeiſed on the north ſide of the river, and that biſhop Ranulph was ſeiſed on the ſouth ſide, <hi>comitive:</hi> This word he expounded to import <hi>quaſi comites,</hi> or as tenants in common, which he feared might give them ſome colour of right on the ſouth ſide; though others thought that <hi>comitive</hi> might there ſignify that they were each of them ſeiſed <hi>jure comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus;</hi> others that it might ſignify that they were both ſeiſed thereof at one and the ſame time; which if ſo, would be falſe in fact, for Ranulph did not come to the See till after depoſing earl Rob de Mowbray. <hi>Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva, eſt dignitas &amp; munus comitis inferioribus comitatus.—Spelm. Gloſſ.</hi> 2. A record annexed to the <hi>record, marchiar</hi> giving an account hiſtorically how the town of Newcaſtle and county of Northumberland came to the Mowbrays, and were forfeited by them; of its name of Monkcheſter and when it took the name of Newcaſtle. &amp;c. 3. An inſpeximus of king John's charter of incorporation to Newcaſtle, and all their other charters till the time of king Henry VI. whereby it appears they never had the port granted to them as appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant to it, nor the conſervatorſhip of it. Whereupon the defendant's counſel prayed a new trial. The arguments were long, and would afford little pleaſure to the reader, I ſhall therefore only ſelect ſuch ſpecial matters from thence as may ſeem important. As to the iſſues being particular to Jarrow Slake, and the decree general to the whole river, the plaintiff's counſel gave no anſwer. But the lord chief baron wondered how it had crept into the decree, and agreed that the decree could only be particular as to Jarrow Slake. They gave no anſwer to the objection that the plaintiffs ought to derive their conſervatorſhip from the crown. The chief baron cited many inſtances of pepetual injunctions; but it was agreed they have been only in uſe ſince the reign of king Charles I. As to the records, the plaintiff's counſel alledged, that it did not appear any thing was done under the commiſſions of conſervatorſhip, or that the mayor of Newcaſtle ever accepted them; to which it was anſwered, the acceptance muſt be preſumed, if nothing is ſhewn to the contrary. As to the 2d article, the record of king Henry I. being of date beyond memory, ought not to be given in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, without ſhewing an allowance of it in eyre: Caſes cited to the contrary in anſwer. 3d article: Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the reading of it, affirming it to be only an action of treſpaſs proſecuted by the biſhop, for treſpaſs done in taking away ſhips, &amp;c. and being betwixt other parties ought not to be read. This the chief baron over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled, but obſerved it was a ſtrange ſort of commiſſion, being a ſpecial commiſſion of oyer and terminer, to hear and determine one particular treſpaſs, which he thought the king himſelf had not a power to grant.— Mr Dormer anſwered, that there were ſpecial cuſtoms in the county palatine different from the common and ordinary cuſtoms of the realm, and his lordſhip's commiſſion when he ſat there as judge was <hi>ad audiendum &amp; terminand. ſecundum legem terrae &amp; conſuetud. Dunelm.</hi> 4th article: Mr Mulſo objected, that upon attempts by the biſhop, the corporation brought a <hi>ſcire facias</hi> to repeal the laſt grant, a copy whereof was ſaid to be produced at the hearing; and ſince the corporation have had the enjoyment. Art. 5. The lord chief baron produced his notes, which he had taken upon hearing the cauſe of king John's charter, whence he obſerved that king John granted <hi>probis hominibus ejuſdem, inter alia. omnes eaſdem libertates &amp; liberas conſuetudines quas habere conſueverunt tempore Hen.</hi> 2. <hi>patris noſtri:</hi> And ſaid, he looked upon that charter of king John's to be only a charter of confirmation. Serj. Lutwich likewiſe inſiſted that this proves their incorporation time beyond memory. The objections to the ſtat. 1 Mar. over-ruled. The lord chief baron then read notes of a trial in which he was concerned as counſel in <hi>Riley's Placita Parl. fo.</hi> 25, the corporation of Newcaſtle againſt the prior of Tynmouth. To which it was anſwered, the prior of Tynmouth there juſtifies taking wreck, making forſtallage, &amp;c. under a charter granted him by king Rich.

You advance to the chancel under the archings of the tower; the pillars very low, ill proportioned, and ſquare, with capitals remarkably heavy and plain; the arches circular, and without ornament; the dome vaulted with ſtone and rib'd, the groins riſing from the corners, and the ribs uniting in the center: The circumſtance of the pillars not ſtanding ſquare, but forming an oblong north and ſouth, was remarkable; the width of this part was only five paces. The tower ſtanding in the center induces us to conclude that formerly this church was in the form of a croſs, and it is probable, from outward appearances, that the nave had ſide ailes. We do not know one inſtance where the tower ſtands between the chancel and nave that there is not or anciently was a croſs aile, and few have the
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:0782100202:505"/>
tower in that ſituation but churches of more than ordinary conſequence. The length of the chancel from the tower to the altar rails is ten paces, and the width only about five paces, ſtalled on each ſide with old carved oak work: The eaſt win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow conſiſted of three lights under a pointed arch. On the north ſide there were two windows, one under a circular arch, and the other a pointed arch, one win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to the ſouth cloſe by the tower, having alſo a pointed arch; all which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſhew the edifice had undergone innumerable alterations, and indeed we conſidered no part ſo ancient as the tower, which it is preſumed was the chief of what remained after the devaſtation committed by the Normans. We found no remarkable ſculptures here ſave a ſepulchral one, which had the figure of a burning taper, with expanded wings. What, was ſhewn as the greateſt curioſity, and is carefully kept in the veſtry-room, is a great two-armed chair, ſaid to have been the common ſeat of Bede, and which has remained there ſince his time: It is of oak, and appears as rude as if hewn out with an ax, except that at the top of the back the croſs piece is mortiſed to the ſtandards or upright parts, which alſo ſerve for legs; theſe with the ſeat and ſides are very ancient, but the back, according to the information of the perſon who ſhewed it, is modern: It is now become very rough and uneven from the ſuperſtition of people, who, by carrying away a chip from it, preſume they have obtained the ſaint's protection*.</p>

As we obſerved before, when the ground was firſt choſen, this was the royal port where the Northumbrian fleet lay moored; theſe were the moſt populous ſhores, and here was the St Paul's of a powerful nation. A ſhip of one hundred tons burthen was a large veſſel in theſe parts in the ſixteenth century, and ſuch were even brought from abroad, and not conſtructed here<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>Now there were many merchantmen of 3, 4, and 500 tons burthen belonging to ſeveral ports, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 100 veſſels, each of above 200 tons burthen, belonging to Newcaſtle alone, all built at home, and better built than elſewhere; and before the death of king James, our trade was ſo far increaſed, that in the opinion of Sir William Monſon, we were little, if at all, inferior in maritime force to the Dutch.

The barrenneſs of the hiſtory of places in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict, as we before obſerved, is owing to the ancient monaſtery to which they were given; and thence they became involved in the general hiſtory of the church of Durham; or ſuch as were granted out by the crown, are now in the hands of modern poſſeſſors, whoſe eſtates are derived from that period.</p>
               <p>Deſcending into this vale, we found the country in a very different mode of agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture from that we had paſſed: Navigation, trade, and the mines fully occupy the hands of the induſtrious in the neighbourhood of Gateſhead and Whickham. In the valley about Hebborn the lands are laid out in beautiful order, well culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and planted; new roads are formed, the buildings are improved, and a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fertility rewards the attention of the owner. Several beautiful manſions, with plantations and pleaſure-grounds, ornament the ſcene; and the greateſt part of the country from Gateſhead to Shields is remarkably pleaſant.</p>
               <p>The towns of NORTH and SOUTH SHIELDS lie oppoſite to each other. Bourne remarks that North-Shields, in the reign of king Edward I. when the conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Newcaſtle and the priory of Tinmouth happened, had only five or ſix fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's huts, and was become a large place but of late years, the church having been erected in 1659. South-Shields is alſo much improved of late years; it is ſituated on a higher ſhore, whence it is leſs affected by the ſmoke of the ſeveral works carried on there, and ſtands more commodious for keys, ſhip-builders yards, and many other matters material to trade. On a fine plain a large ſquare is lately built, having the church on the ſouth, with ſtreets branching from the centers of each ſide of the ſquare, and a handſome town-hall <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>This is alſo uſed by the dean and chapter as a court-houſe: Notice was given to hold a court leet there on Tueſday the 16th of October, 1770, for the whole manor of Weſtoe.</p>

About fifty years ago it is ſaid there were two hundred ſalt pans wrought here, now there are not more than thirty. But whilſt that trade has declined, others of great conſequence have improved as rapidly; for within the diſtance of

forty years there were not more than four ſhips which belonged to this town, and now we are informed there are about five hundred, of between one hundred and five hundred tons burthen: Eleven ſhips were built and launched from the yards in 1781. There are here three dry docks for repairing, and ten yards for building ſhips: Four glaſs-houſes for making crown glaſs and bottles; and it is ſuppoſed the number of ſettled inhabitants is about fifteen thouſand. Mr Fordyce erected a large barilla work here, but it did not anſwer his expectations; ſome or moſt of the buildings are now uſed for a ſoap-boilery. The victualling and fitting out ſuch a number of ſhips by the ſiſter towns, as reſort to this haven, of which South-Shields has a conſiderable proportion, the many branches of trade and manufacture carried on there, produce a vaſt influx of wealth. The importance of South-Shields has aroſe in little more than a century: The church, a chapel of eaſe under Jarrow, had occaſion to enlarge the burial yard; and, in 1631, biſhop Howſon conſecrated a plot of ground for that purpoſe<note n="*" place="bottom">In MS.

               <p>The antiquity of the church at Shields is not to be deduced with accuracy from any records before us; it was perhaps nearly cotemporary with that of Jarrow: Little can be gathered from the ſtructure, it has been ſo often altered and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

The river thronged with veſſels, and animated with an inceſſant paſſage of ſmall craft, is cloſe on your left hand: The batteries and barracks on the northern ſhore diſplay a ſtriking military ſcene, whilſt on the more diſtant ground, from the brow of lofty rocks, riſe the venerable remains of Tinmouth priory: At the time we ſaw this proſpect, the cliffs were gilded with the evening ſun; the daſhing billows which broke over the bar of the river drove their foam againſt the precipices, over which the ſolemn abbey, in the weeds of ruin, with diſtracted aſpect, ſinking under the deſtroying hand of Time, compleated ſuch an aſſemblage of pictureſque objects as ſeldom are found in a ſpace ſo confined.</p>

               <p>Many judicious antiquaries have been of opinion, that there was a Roman ſtation at the point of land near South-Shields; and indeed the importance of this river was ſuch, that we can ſcarcely imagine ſo cautious and intelligent a people would have neglected the ſouthern ſhore, where an enemy's troops at ſome ſeaſons might ſafely be diſembarked if the coaſt was unguarded<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Horſley's Brit. Rom. p. 286. There has been a Roman ſtation here, and to this belong the three fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing antiquities.</p>
                     <p>An altar was (when I took the draught of it) upon the ſpot where the ſtation has been, lying at the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt corner. Dr Hunter has ſince got it removed to the library of Durham, where I ſaw it, when laſt there.</p>
                     <p>It is of a coarſe brown ſtone, much of the ſame nature with what we frequently meet with in other Roman altars; though the people here tell me, no ſuch ſtone is now to be found in theſe parts The uſual ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing veſſels are upon the ſides of the altars, and the knife upon the back, which is not ſo common.— There has no doubt been an inſcription upon this altar, though it is now entirely effaced. Yet as this was the only original I could recover belonging to this ſtation, I thought proper to give a draught of it.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this, two other altars have been found at this place; one of which, as I am informed, was built up in a quay wall about forty years ago, and is not now to be come at. The other was firſt ſent to York to Dr Liſter, and ſince his death, as I have been told, was ſent to Norwich to one Mr Giles, and I ſuppoſe is now loſt. Dr Liſter publiſhed it in the Tranſactions, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 145, and from thence it has been inſerted in Camden's Brit. and in Dr Gale's edition of Antonine's Itinerary, p. 9.</p>
                     <q>Dis Matribus pro ſalute Imperatoris Marci Aurelii Antonini Auguſti Pii felicis — lubens merito ob reditum.</q>
                     <p>I have taken the draught of the altar and inſcription from the copy of Dr Liſter, compared with the others, and given a reading of the inſcription ſomewhat different from Dr Liſter's, and only pricked thoſe letters or parts of letters which I imagine ought to be ſupplied. As it is not uſual to place the word <hi>Imperator</hi> after the name of the emperor, ſo I ſee no occaſion for doing it here. The Doctor obſerves, that this altar might be erected for Caracalla when going into Caledonia. Severus is, I believe, generally joined to Caracalla in the inſcriptions before the Caledonian expedition, as he was in the expedition itſelf. This makes it leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that Caracalla is intended in the inſcription, and yet <hi>ob reditum,</hi> and the titles <hi>pii felicis</hi> don't ſeem to ſuit Marcus Aurelius, nor <hi>ob reditum</hi> Commodus, though to him <hi>pius felix</hi> are uſually annexed. So that I ſuppoſe it yet more improbable, that either of theſe are intended. Nor do I think there is much in having both <hi>pro ſalute,</hi> and <hi>ob reditum</hi> in the inſcription. It is for his ſafe return: <hi>Pro ſalute itus et reditus</hi> is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common.</p>

                           <p>Dr Liſter, who firſt wrote out this inſcription, and from whoſe copy the others have ſince been taken, tells us, that it contained nine lines, and therefore has left a ſpace between the fifth and ſixth line ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain two others.

                        <q>Give me leave to attempt the recovery of one of the Roman ſtations in this country, both requiſite for the ſecurity of the navigation into the northern ſeas, and the protection of their frontiers beyond the river Tyne, thereby ſaving the great expence and trouble of building the wall as far as the ſea at Tinmouth, no leſs than three miles. I mean that near South-Shields, at the entrance of the river into the ocean, and which cannot but have flouriſhed till the Daniſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions, as Mr Leland has it in his Collectanea, vol. iv. p. 43. <hi>E regione Tine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muthae fuit urbs vaſtata a Danis, Urfa nomine, ubi natus erat Oſwinus rex.</hi> The communication there was with Bincheſter, is viſible in ſeveral places, as is the angle where the paved way goes off from the military way leading to Lancheſter, about three miles to the north of Bincheſter, and paſſes to the north eaſt through Brancepeth-park, thence a little to the ſouth of Brandon<note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <p>Behind Willington the road is very diſtinct: A mile ſtone was lately diſcovered there, with an inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſcribed to be legible; but when we went to look after it, the farmers had totally obliterated the whole, and ſquared the pillar to form ſome part of the ſold for their cattle.</p>

Two elevated pavements in the river Tyne, the one at the weſt end of South-Shields, the other on the north ſide of the river, near the end of the Roman wall, proper for their ſafe landing at different times of the ebbing and flowing tide, fully ſhew its neceſſary correſpondence with <hi>Segedunum,</hi> the firſt ſtation upon the wall. But another military way called <hi>Wreken Dyke</hi>
                           <note n="†" place="bottom">
                              <p>That there has been a Roman ſtation at South-Shields is out of all queſtion; the altars that have been found there, and the military way which has gone from it, are convincing proofs of this. I once imagined
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:0782100202:515"/>this ſtation might have been the old <hi>Glanoventa</hi> (which no doubt was the moſt eaſterly on this rout at that time) mentioned in the Itinerary and in the Notitia, and that this iter had begun here, and proceeded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the military way leading from hence to Lancheſter: But the diſtances in the Itinerary are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the diſtances between the reſpective ſtations on this way, if we begin at South-Shields. Beſides, that the ſlender remains of the ſtation and military way near it, incline me to think it has not been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo late as till the writing of the Notitia, that it was in being at the time of Marcus Aurelius, appears from the altar and inſcription found here, if Dr Liſter's reading be juſt; but I am apt to think it was abandoned not very long after, perhaps at the building of Severus's wall, and the ſtation erected at Couſin's houſe, or a little after. This ſtation ſeems not to be named either in Ptolemy, the Itinerary, or Notitia, unleſs we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Oſtia Vedrae</hi> in Ptolemy to be as well the name of the ſtation as of the river mouth.</p>
                              <p>I know no other name for the Roman ſtation and town at the mouth of the river, (<hi>Vedra</hi> Tine) near South-Shields, but <hi>Oſtia Vedrae.</hi> If we conſider the ſtation itſelf, the altar inſcribed to one of the Antonines, and the nearneſs of the place to the Roman wall, one can ſcarce ſuppoſe, that the river and ſtation ſhould be wholly unknown to Ptolemy; and yet unleſs theſe be their names, they are nameleſs in this geographer. I own the force of this argument is abated, when we conſider, that neither Newcaſtle nor any other of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man places on the wall are mentioned by this ancient author; but it is true, that towns rather than ſorts came under Ptolemy's notice.</p>
                              <p>In this place it will not be amiſs to take notice of Wreken Dyke, the military way ſo called. This military way has no doubt terminated at South-Shields. It ſeems to have come from the ſtation, and to have croſſed the marſh, then poſſibly a branch of the river, not far from the ſtation. Thence it has paſſed moſt probably through, or a little to the eaſt of a houſe called Lay-gate; from thence it ſeems to have gone near a houſe called the Barns, the garden wall probably ſtanding on it, and ſo on to the Dean bridge, cloſe by Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Slake. For this ſpace, the traces of this way are very obſcure and uncertain: In the field beyond this bridge the track of it is plain, and for near the full breadth of the incloſure, ſenſibly raiſed above the level of the reſt of the ground, though it runs croſs the ridges. On the weſt ſide of this field or incloſure there is a ſmall deſcent, and in the bottom a lane, which is the high road from Bowden to Shields, and a ſmall aſcent on the other ſide in the field joining this lane. As the military way aſcends on the one ſide and deſcends on the other, it is bent into a curve, and then falls into the right line, in which it ſeems to be continued all the way to Gateſhead fell for the ſpace of five or ſix miles; from thence it goes towards Lameſley and Kibbleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, which it leaves a little to the ſouth. It was very viſible all the way not many years ago, before Sir Henry Liddell incloſed and improved thoſe grounds. And the gardener at Couſin's houſe, who formerly wrought on Gateſhead fell, aſſured me he had ſeen and helped to dig up ſome ſtones out of Wreken Dyke, which he called Bracken Dyke, ſo that he was altogether of opinion that this part of it had been paved. This way paſſes on towards Beamiſh, and I make no doubt has gone forward to Lancheſter. It is indeed loſt on the moor beyond Beamiſh, nor is it any great wonder it ſhould be ſo, conſidering how moſſy and loſt it is. I was aſſured at Lancheſter that ſeveral trees had been dug up in this moor, which had been cut down with an ax, probably to clear this way; and if theſe trees have been ſunk ſo much below the ſurface, no wonder if a heavy military way be much more ſo. I have heard a traditionary account of this way's paſſing by Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley towards Lancheſter, though I know not how far this may be relied on, but how little of ſuch military ways appear in ſome other places, where it might have been better expected? There is a remarkable tumulus near this way, not far from Ravenſworth: Beſides which, I obſerved another very conſiderable one about a mile from Lancheſter, called the Maiden-Law, and probably the military way has not been far from this tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus. I am ſurpriſed to find the military way which goes from South-Shields uſually repreſented to paſs near to Durham, ſometimes on the eaſt and ſometimes on the weſt ſide of it, when there is ſuch plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration not only of the reality of the way, but of the range and tendency of it; but I believe the military way which is ſuppoſed to have gone from Newcaſtle to Cheſter, and from thence to Watling-ſtreet near Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, has occaſioned the miſtake. The Gardener at Couſin's houſe, ſaid he had obſerved when he wrought thereabouts, this military way from Newcaſtle to Cheſter, and that it lay to the weſt of the preſent high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way through the ſell. Dr Hunter was poſitive he had obſerved the ſame way upon the ſell, as alſo ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining track of a <hi>via vicinalis</hi> beyond Cheſter, between Bincheſter and Brancepeth caſtle, (as I remember) pointing towards Cheſter, which he therefore concluded muſt have gone that way.—<hi>Horſley.</hi>

                              <p>1750. Wreken Dyke is the boundary between Gateſhead fell and Eighton common, and may be ſeen as it paſſes through Eighton quarries, and at the north end of the village of Eighton, from thence down one of lord Ravenſworth's new incloſures, and croſſing the high road leading to Newcaſtle from Cheſter, it appears plain in an incloſure on the weſt ſide of the road, the ridge not having been ploughed, and it is partly over run with broom, and there is a foot path on the ridge of it.</p>

This place, though not above three miles from Cheſter-in-the-Street and four from Lancheſter, ſeems to have had no immediate communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with either of them, no veſtigia of any paved way appearing upon the moors adjoining, and being ſituated as Cheſter itſelf, at the termination of a military way, gives me convincing reaſon to believe the uſe of each has been the ſame, namely, to guard herds of cattle at graſs, for the ſubſiſtence of the two garriſons at South-Shields and <hi>Pons Aelij,</hi> and for victualling ſhips reſorting to the firſt place: Whereas had its elevated ſituation been intended to form a <hi>caſtrum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploratorium,</hi> then muſt the advantage of paved ways to the next ſtation have been neceſſary for the ſpeedy conveyance of intelligence. Though this laſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary way bears the names of Wreken Dyke, I am apt to believe that name is rather due to the way leading from Bincheſter to South Shields, eſpecially from the authority of Ralph Higden, who ſays, that Wreken Dyke, or Reken Dyke, paſſed from the weſt of England and ended at Tinemouth. I dare not affix a Roman name to this our ſtation, without the authority of inſcriptions.</q>

               <p>After the learned definitions given in the notes on the etymology of Wreken Dyke, it may appear preſumptuous to offer new conjectures; but there is a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that this military road was reſtored by the Danes on their making the river Tyne their frequent harbour, for the more eaſy communication with the country, and victualling their navy: At their ſeveral ſtationary intervals where ſentries were placed, their ſtandard, ſo well known in ancient writings by the name of

Raffen, would be diſplayed, and it ſeems but a ſmall treſpaſs on the original word, to imagine it would fall into the corruption of <hi>Raken,</hi> ſo as to make Raffen Dyke ſound Racken Dyke: They were the laſt people who it may be preſumed kept this up as a military road, and thence the name in acceptation in their days, not having been diſuſed by new comers, has remained to our time. We propoſed the like etymology for the name of Ravenſworth, much leſs corrupted from Raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fens-weath, the northern language, and it remains with the reader to determine, whether, ſupported by each other, together with the tumuli of Ravenſworth and Maiden Law, the conjecture is probable, or at leaſt not altogether vague.</p>
               <p>In the road from Shields to Sunderland we paſſed through the village of WESTOE, having ſeveral handſome buildings, ſeated on an eminence, commanding a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proſpect of the harbour and adjacent country.</p>
               <p>The ſcenery around is pleaſant, the cultivation kept in good order, and the roads excellent.</p>

In the thirty-fourth year of biſhop Hatfield, Iſabella the daughter of Tho. de Weſſington, daughter and one of the heireſſes of Jacob de Uſworth, died ſeiſed of a moiety of this manor, and a fourth part of the vill of Great Uſworth.

               <p>The Staiths called FATFIELD STAITHS exhibit a buſy ſcene in the coal trade, where the keels come up to receive their loading for the port of Sunderland. The village is very populous. Near this place is an eminence called the Worm Hill, which tradition ſays was once poſſeſſed by an enormous ſerpent, that wound its hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid body round the baſe; that it deſtroyed much proviſion, and uſed to infeſt the Lambton eſtate, till ſome hero of that family engaged it, caſed in armour ſet with razors, and when it would have cruſhed the combatant by enfolding him, ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thouſand wounds, fell at laſt by his falchion. We thought to have found intrenchments round this mount, and that the fable had reference to ſome Daniſh troop who kept the place as a ſtation, from whence they could commit depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the country, and that the ſtory of the hero imported ſome chief perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age's victory over a public enemy: But there is not the leaſt trace of any ſuch matter, and the whole miraculous tale has no other evidence than the memories of old women.

                  </note>. The villains here were under ſevere duties; for beſides various kinds of labour to be performed for the lord in the field, they rendered money payments at the biſhop's exchequer, and 16d. each for averpennys, which appears to be a payment in lieu of royal averages <q>quietum eſſe de diverſis denariis pro averagiis dom. regis,</q> a ſervice by horſe and carriage for conveying the ſovereign's ammunition and baggage in time of war, &amp;c. The vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains laboured three days in each week throughout the whole year, excepting the weeks of Eaſter and Whitſuntide, and thirteen days at Chriſtmas, and amongſt them to build a houſe for the lord in his park, forty feet long and fifteen broad, for which they were exempt from one-third of their averpennys: They were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileged at the fairs of St Cuthbert to ſet up one booth or hut for every two villains,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:0782100202:523"/>
of whom there were twenty-two in Boldon. The cotmanni or cottagers wrought only two days in each week. The pinder here held twelve acres of land in right of his office, and had a thrave of corn from every carucate of land, rendering to the lord yearly twenty-four hens and five hundred eggs: The whole vill paid ſeventeen ſhillings cornage, and provided a milch cow for the houſehold. The demeſne lands were in farm, and rendered rent in grain, as bread, corn, oats, and barley. In Hatfield's Survey we find the names of the free tenants, among whom is John Hedworth, who ſerved on the biſhop's embaſſies, and was bound to bring up to Durham the biſhop's rents of his manor of Werehall. Peter del Hay held lands, and the lord Neville had the vill of Newton. The bond ſervices vary a little from thoſe ſet forth in Boldon Book; there are malt-pennys and bathe-ſylver mentioned: This is the firſt time the bathe-ſylver has occured in the progreſs of the work, and it is difficult to aſcertain what it was. Buthena is defined to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a park for cattle, and bothena a barony, lordſhip, or ſheriffwick; whether it applied to either of theſe, we confeſs ourſelves at a loſs; perhaps it was ſtallage-money for the booths or ſtalls allowed to many of the villains at St Cuthbert's fairs in the city.</p>
               <p>In biſhop Bury's time, Alicia de Marrays died ſeiſed of lands in Weſt Boldon; and Allan Gategant held certain lands there called Fadreleſs Houſes, held <hi>in capite</hi> by homage and fealty. By an inquiſition taken on the death of Richard de Hethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, or Hedworth, in the ſecond year of biſhop Fordham, it appears he died ſeiſed of various tenements in Boldon, viz. Scots Houſe and all the lands and tenements that theretofore belonged to Ade Rhodes, Gilbert de Boldon, Roger de Burdon, Ambroſe de Southwyk, Ade de Clevedon, and Matilda Gray. This fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily retained their poſſeſſions in Boldon for many generations. The family of Claxtons held lands there called Strothers-field, touching which, in the time of biſhop Neville, Ralph earl of Weſtmoreland came and claimed oyer of an inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken by the eſcheator on the death of William Claxton, wherein Strother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field in Weſt Boldon, was found to be held of the biſhop <hi>in capite,</hi> and by others

Newton, in biſhop Bury's time, gave a local name to a reſident family, and Rob. de Newton, in the fifth year of that prelate, died ſeiſed of conſiderable property there. In biſhop Hatfield's Survey it appears, that lord Neville then held the vill, one moiety of which he purchaſed of William ſon of Tho. Gategan, and the other moiety being the eſtate of John de Hedworth, he aliened the ſame to Will. de Hilton, chiv. who ſold it to the Nevilles<note n="‡" place="bottom">A<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Skirlaw inq.</note>, and Ralph earl of Weſtmoreland aliened the manor to John de Hoton <note n="‖" place="bottom">A<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 6<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Langley inq.</note> of Tudhow, which family afterwards reſided at Hardwick near Sedgefield, but how long they held this manor we have not diſcovered.

In the Boldon Book we find the names of Ketellus and John de Whitbern, with others, holding lands there: There were twelve cottagers in the like ſervitude as thoſe of Boldon, and the pinder had the ſame privilege.

D. 674, Benedict Biſcopius, (whoſe brotherhood from him took the name of Benedictines) having a grant of ſixty hides of lands, founded a religious houſe here, and dedicated it to St Peter. Lambard, p. 400, ſpeaks thus of him and his undertaking <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <p>Bede, lib. iv. cha. 18, gives the following account of this matter. <q>In the reign of Egfrid. king of Northumberland, one Benedict, an Engliſhman, came over from Rome, with John the precenter of St Peter's, who was ſent by pope Agatho to the ſynod convened by The ſorus, and he built the monaſtery of Weremouth, becoming abbot there. Having a grant from the king of ſome lands for an endowment of the abbey, he went to Rome and procured the pope's bull for a further ſecurity in the year 680. At his return the pope ordered John the precentor to go along with him, and teach him and his monks the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſinging uſed at St Peter's in Rome. John, at his coming hither, performed this part of his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, taught the monaſtery church muſic, and pricked out a courſe for the choir for a whole year. This manner of church muſic was quickly ſpread through moſt part of the kingdom of Northumberland.</q>

Benedict in the notes. In Bentham's Hiſtory of Ely, p. 21, we are informed the workmen employed in this edifice were brought by Benedict from France, and that within the compaſs of a year after the foundation was laid, he cauſed the roof to be put on, and divine ſervice to be performed in it: He continues, <q>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when the building was finiſhed, he ſent over to France for artificers ſkilled in the myſtery of making glaſs, (an art till that time unknown to the inhabitants of Britain) to glaze the windows both of the porticos and principal parts of the church; which work they not only executed, but taught the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nation that moſt uſeful art.</q> We are not informed in what manner the monaſtery was reſtored, or by whom, after the Daniſh devaſtations; but when king Malcolm of Scotland made his inroad in the year 1070, he ravaged many parts of this palatinate, and burnt the monaſteries of Weremouth and Hartlepool. We have few accounts of the oſtium of the Were being frequented by ſhipping in theſe early times, but from the choice of ſituations, are induced to believe what led the founders of religious houſes to fix upon Weremouth and Jarrow, was their being the ſtation of mariners, who in all ages were objects for religious reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet another and perhaps not leſs eſſential cauſe occurs, they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to preſent gifts for propitiation, which would aſſiſt the maintenance, if not increaſe the riches, of the religious ſocieties. When Malcolm made that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, he found Edgar with his family and followers embarked, and lying in the haven waiting wind and tide, for their voyage to Scotland; and it is more than probable the king's intention was to cover that retreat. This circumſtance ſhews that the port was of ſome note in the eleventh century <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. It is wonderful that Turgot, who took the monkiſh habit at this place, ſhould not ſpeak of its hiſtory during ſo long a ſpace of time, as from the incurſion of the Danes to the year 1075, a period of 205 years, or mention the reſtored edifice, the return of the ſociety, and the deſtruction made by Malcolm. Thus dark as the long interval remains, we muſt purſue the facts which he delivers down: Part of the religious ſociety of Jarrow (which we are apt to conceive was become too numerous by the monks who were driven from Weremouth ſeeking refuge there) determined to form a colony, with Aldwin at their head, and ſettle in the north, whilſt another prepared for a ſouthern ſettlement, headed by Renfred: Aldwin, with his followers, ſat down at the ruined huoſe of Melros, where they ſuffered much perſecution, refuſing to ſwear allegiance to Malcolm, who then poſſeſſed that territory <note n="†" place="bottom">Vide vol. i. p. 115.

was diſpleaſed with this emigration, which was not only made without his conſent, but alſo militated againſt a plan he had formed, though not made public: He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched meſſengers to entreat the return of the northern colony, and wrote letters of invitation; but in caſe of diſobedience, the meſſengers were charged with more rigorous commands, and the terrors of excommunication were directed to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. On Aldwin's return to this dioceſe, in the year 1075, the biſhop placed him at Weremouth. Turgot then tells us <q>Tunc eccleſiam S. Petri, cujus adhuc ſoli parietes ſemiruti ſteterant, ſucciſis arboribus, cradicatis vepribus &amp; ſpinis, quae totam occupaverant, curarunt expurgare, &amp; culmine impoſito, quale hodie cernitur, ad agenda divinae laudis officia ſtategerant reſtaurare.</q>

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Symeon Dunelm. p. 203, 204, &amp;c.</note> This relation affords ſome ſurpriſe, for according to other authorities, it was only in the year 1070 that Malcolm laid his deſtroying hand on thoſe edifices, and in the ſpace of five years few trees, thorns, or briers could grow over the ruins. Lambard ſtill creates greater confuſion in the matter, who ſays, <q>Aldwyn of Eveſham, or Winchecombe as others ſay, accompanied with two or thre other, toke the place of byſhop Walchers guifte, covered the churche, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what repaired the houſe, and ſtoared it with companie: But before they had longe reſted theare, the deſtruction which William the Conquerour made in the north countrye, and the fire of Malcolme kinge of Scottes came upon theim, and cauſed theim to forſake the place for a ſeaſon. And when they ment to have returned, William, then biſhop of Durham, compelled them to come to Durham abbay, and made the houſe and cell ſubject to the ſame,</q> &amp;c. This account deſtroys every degree of chronology, for biſhop Walcher did not come to the See till 1072. To ſolve the difficulty, it ſeems likely there were two religious edifices, one north of Were, deſtroyed by the Danes, of which Jarrow was a filia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and another erected perhaps after that deſtruction, on the ſouth of Were, which Malcolm ruined: And this conjecture is not totally groundleſs; for Tanner, in his Notitia <note n="†" place="bottom">

                     <p>Tanner's Notitia, p. 14. King Egfrid gave this town to the famous abbot Benedict Biſcopius, who, A. D. 674, founded a monaſtery here, and dedicated it to St Peter. It ſuffered in the Daniſh wars, and was burnt down in the inroad made by Malcolm king of Scotland, A. D. 1070: But was afterwards begun to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edified by Walcher biſhop of Durham, whoſe ſucceſſor William de Carilepho <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lel.

                     <p>Complete Hiſtory of Durham, p. 619. Bede calls it Wiranmuth, now commonly called Monkweremouth, becauſe it lies at the mouth of the river, and before the Reformation belonged to the monks. William of Malmſbury writes thus of it: <q>The Were flowing into the ſea here, kindly receives the ſhips that are brought in with a gentle wind; upon <hi>each bank whereof</hi> Benedict Biſhop built a church, and likewiſe in the ſame places founded two monaſteries, one to St Peter another to St Paul.</q> The author of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to Camden charges this quotation out of Malmſbury with a miſtake, and ſays, our hiſtorians all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that he built St Peter's church at Girwy or Jarrow, which is ſome miles diſtant from this place, but does not produce their words.</p>
                  </note>, makes a miſtake in the ſituation of St Peter's, perhaps through the confuſion there appears in ancient hiſtory. After this laſt ſettlement the biſhop gave the vill of Weremouth, with Sudwick, for the maintenance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious fellowſhip there; but their reſidence was ſoon diſturbed, by biſhop William de Carilepho carrying into effect the deſign of his predeceſſor, and removing the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictine

monks to Durham, in the year 1083; from which period Weremouth became a cell for three or four monks only of that order, ſubordinate to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of Durham. Prior Richard de Claxton, reſigning his government of the monaſtery, had aſſigned for maintenance the cell of Weremouth, with the tithes of Sudwick; and prior Galfrid de Burdon, in the year 1332, had that cell aſſigned him, with the tithes of Fulwell. At the diſſolution, the whole revenues did not, according to the utmoſt eſtimate, amount to more than 26l. 9s. 9d. yearly; and in the thirty-ſeventh year of king Henry VIII. the rights of the monaſtery were granted out to one Thomas Whitehead <note n="*" place="bottom">

The preſent church conſiſts only of the nave and north aile, the ſouth aile having been totally deſtroyed: The tower is moſt ancient, and probably has ſtood from the eleventh century, being ſupported on heavy and low arches, and the chancel is divided from the nave by a heavy circular arch, much like the arches of Jarrow in form, but more lofty and extended: The north aile is formed by two round pillars and three pointed arches, and the eaſt window of the chancel is under a pointed arch, and formed of five lights. The nave is remarkably nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in proportion to its length, being little more than five paces wide, and twenty-two long; the aile is alſo five paces wide. On the north wall of the chancel is a monument of the Hilton family <note n="*" place="bottom">Arms: Hiltons quartering the arms of Muſgrave.</note>; and in an adjoining porch, is the mutilated effigy of a man in a coat of mail, with elevated hands, and a ſword ſheathed at his left ſide, which appears to have belonged to the monument before noted.</p>

In the middle of this bank was found the ſkeleton of a human body, which meaſured nine feet ſix inches in length; the ſhin bone meaſuring two feet three inches from the knee to the ankle; the head lay to the weſt, and was defended from the ſuperincumbent earth by four large flat ſtones, which the relater, a man of great probity, who was preſent when the ſkeleton was meaſured, and who himſelf took the teeth out of the jaw, ſaw removed.

The preſent center of the building is five ſtories in height, and moſt probably is the edifice deſcribed in the record, comprehending the hall and four chambers.

                  <pb n="510" facs="tcp:0782100202:539"/>The following account of the Hiltons is taken from a manuſcript in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Muſgraves of Hayton:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Three hundred years before the Conqueſt, even in the reign of king Athelſtan, one of the Saxon monarchs, the family of Hyltons were ſettled in England in great reputation, as appears by a certain inſcription at Hartlepool. That upon the coming over of William the Conqueror, Lancelot de Hylton, with his two ſons Henry and Robert, eſpouſed his cauſe and joined him; but that Lancelot was ſlain at Feverſham in Kent. That to the elder ſon Henry, the Conqueror gave a large tract of land on the banks of the river Were, not far from Wereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth; a reward for his own and his father's valour. That this Henry built Hylton caſtle in the year 1072, was one of the deputies that treated with the Conqueror concerning the four northern counties, and in the ſervice of that prince, was at laſt ſlain in Normandy. That in the reign of Edward III. John Hylton, who ſent four of his ſons into the wars of France, under the command of the Black Prince, was firſt created baron of Hylton caſtle, for his gallant defence of it againſt the Scots incurſions. That this peerage continued in the family for ſeven ſucceſſions, till at laſt it was forfeited upon account of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded words, whereof the then biſhop of Durham gave the court information, which William the ſeventh and laſt baron of the family ſpoke againſt the queen, and her favourite De Le Pole. That upon the death of this William, which was thought to have been violent, the crown ſeizing upon the eſtate, gave it to the informing biſhop, who held it for ſome time, to the utter excluſion of the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heir. That in proceſs of time however, Lancelot, the grandſon to the aforeſaid William, was reſtored to his caſtle and part of his eſtate, no more of it indeed than what the biſhop thought fit to allow him under this hard condition, that he and his heirs for ever ſhould hold the moiety that was given them under certain rents and ſervices to the Sec of Durham, and have the title of barons (but barons to the biſhopric) annexed to their inheritance; and in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it has continued ever ſince. In the pedigree of the Hyltons there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral names remarkable for their learning and piety, but almoſt innumerable thoſe highly renowned for their martial deeds. War ſeems to have been the pleaſure, genius, and recreation of the Hyltons, nor has any family been more laviſh of their blood in defence of their country's cauſe. Since the time of the Conqueſt it is remarked of the Hyltons, that one was ſlain at Feverſham in Kent, one in Normandy, one at Mentz in France, three in the holy wars under Richard I. one in the ſame under Edward I. three at the battle of Bourdeaux, under the Black Prince, one at Agincourt, two at Berwick upon Tweed againſt the Scots, two at the battle of St Albans, five at Market Boſworth, and four at Flodden Field.</q>

                     <p>There was a chantry of the Bleſſed Virgin Mary in this church, of the yearly value of 3l. 15s. 4d. Cui p'tinuit unum burgagium in Sunderland, cum parcella terrae in poſteriori ejus parte clauſur. et quatuor acrae et dimid. acrae prati cum pertinentiis. Ra. Parkinſon, the laſt incumbent at the diſſolution in 1547, had a yearly penſion of 3l. which he lived to receive in 1553.—<hi>Randal's MSS.</hi>

                  </note>, though disfigured on the outſide by modern faſhed windows, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains much of its ancient form within; the architecture teſtifying that the ſtructure is nearly as ancient as the days of Athelſtan, when the Saxon modes prevailed. The chancel was repaired and greatly altered by Mr Smith, who came to this rectory in 1704. The altar rails form a ſquare, thereby admitting many communicants to the ſervice: The incloſure is ſix paces in length, and three wide ſteps aſcend to the rail; the whole is neatly wainſcotted, and the eaſt end ornamented with taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle work. The eaſt window is under a pointed arch, and formed of five lights;
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:0782100202:542"/>
there are four ſouth windows, and one to the north, having two lights each, under pointed arches. From the ſteps, the chancel on each ſide is double ſtalled with oak, in the cathedral form, ornamented with a carved entablature in open work. The entrance from the nave is under a lofty pointed arch, riſing from a cluſter of ſmall round pilaſters; cloſed with ſtalls and a handſome wood ſcreen, ſuitable to the reſt of the chancel. The whole length of the chancel within the rails and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out is nineteen paces. The nave hath two regular ailes, formed by two rows of three round columns, about fourteen feet in height, uniform, with rolls for capitals, ſupporting circular arches; there are four upper windows on each ſide: The nave and ailes together are fifteen paces in width, and ſixteen in length, regularly ſtalled with oak, and carved with fleur-de-lis. The pulpit is lofty, and well ornamented: Near it, in the end wall of the north aile, is a monument, having the effigy of a man in armour to the waiſt, with elevated hands, in high relief; belonging, as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, to one of the family of Middleton. The tower riſes on ſhort round pilaſters, ſupporting pointed arches on the ſides, and a lofty circular arch towards the nave. The weſt end of the nave is galleried. By the various modes of archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture which are ſeen in this edifice, it is evident, alterations have taken place at different periods, but that the old Saxon mode was the original one.</p>
               <p>The rector of Weremouth for the time being is lord of the manor, and holds his courts, the cuſtoms and copyholds of which are of the ſame nature with the cuſtoms and copyholds of the biſhop's manors. The hiſtory of this place is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the confuſion before noted relative to Monkweremouth, and we are not able to trace the antiquity with any degree of accuracy, either in relation to the foundation of the church or its endowment. Camden was overtaken in the error of William of Malmſbury <note n="*" place="bottom">Lat. edition, p. 576. "In hoc S. Petri. Monaſterio Beda, &amp;c. operam dedit, &amp;c."</note>, and confounded Jarrow with Weremouth.

cottagers, whoſe cuſtoms were ſimilar to thoſe of Boldon. There was a carpenter, alſo a ſmith, who held lands for their work; the two places paid xx s. cornage, and provided two milch cows for the houſhold. The lordſhip was then farmed out, with the increaſe of certain live ſtock appertaining thereto of cattle and ſheep, which, with the mill, produced 20l. a year: The fiſheries gave 6l. and the borough of Weremouth xx s. In biſhop Hatfield's Survey we find an account taken of the products of this manor, in which more minute particulars are noted. Thomas Menvylle then held a place called Hynden, for plying of ſhips, under the rent of 2 s. and the parſon of Weremouth held a paſture called the Hough: The bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men paid 19d. for ſcatpennys; for their privilege on Middlemoor and Littlemoor 10s. 10d. in the whole, and provided each two hens and ten eggs: For one milch cow they paid 6s. for cornage x s. woodlades 8 s. 8d. and for the common furnace 3s. 4d. The bond tenants of Weremouth, Tunſtall, Ryhope, and Birden paid for their mill and brewferm. Among the rents of the bond tenants of Tunſtall we find they paid 19d. for ſcatpennys <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>It hath been aſſerted by various writers, that Sunderland, either was ſo united with Weremouth, or ſo inſignificant in Camden's time, as cauſed him not to mention it. Leland, in his Itinerary, takes no note of it. It is moſt probable the general name of Weremouth prevailed ſo much as occaſioned Sunderland to eſcape the learned writers obſervation, eſpecially as in the charter granted by biſhop Pudſey, the borough had the name of Weremouth.</p>
               <p>That charter is addreſſed, among other perſonages, as priors, archdeacons, &amp;c. to the biſhop's barons, and grants, That the burgeſſes of Weremouth ſhould enjoy the like liberties and free-cuſtoms, as the burgeſſes of Newcaſtle: That all pleas ariſing within the borough, except thoſe of the crown, ſhould be determined there. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes between thoſe plying with ſhips at that port, and merchants to whom the cargoes were ſold, to be determined within the time of the third influx of the tide, that navigation might not be retarded: Merchandize brought by ſea to be landed before ſale, except ſalt and herrings. A year and a day's poſſeſſion of lands, &amp;c. without claim, the claimant being within the realm, and not under age, a ſufficient quietus. A burgeſs's ſon maintained by his father at bed and board, entitled to the like privileges as the father. A villain remaining and holding lands or tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:0782100202:546"/>
in the borough for a year and a day without interruption, to have the ſame franchiſe as a burgeſs. A burgeſs might ſell his lands and go where he pleaſed, if no claim was ſubſiſting againſt him. If a burgeſs was complained againſt, in a matter where battle ought to be waged, by a villain, he was to make defence by thirty-ſix men, unleſs the value in ſuit was one hundred pounds, or the crime im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him ought to be tried by battle. No burgeſs was compelled to fight againſt a villain unleſs he had forfeited his franchiſe. There was not to be within the borough <hi>blodwite, merchete, heriet,</hi> or <hi>blood drawing.</hi> The reve or head-borough was to look after forfeitures touching bread and beer. A burgeſs might bring in his corn from the country when he pleaſed, except at a time of prohibition or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargo. Whatever a burgeſs bought he might ſell without licence of the lord or conſent of his heir. Every burgeſs had liberty to buy timber and ſire wood equally with the burgeſſes of Durham. They ſhould enjoy their common paſture as was originally granted to them, and which the biſhop had cauſed to be perambulated. Cuſtoms of fiſh were reſerved to the biſhop, as Brus had from his people of Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepool.</p>
               <p>The town of Sunderland ſtands on a point of land, having a ſteep deſcent to the river, which affords a convenient and ſafe haven for ſhipping. It was not anciently a port of note, yet not totally unfrequented; for in the preceding charter a proviſion is contained touching ſhips plying there: Yet we cannot form any great eſtimate of this port, when we obſerve in Hatfield's Survey, that John Hedworth had an ancient right of drawing a net in the very haven <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>Biſhop Morton, deſirous of encouraging the trade of Sunderland, in the year 1634, granted a charter of incorporation to the burgeſſes and inhabitants, by the title of mayor, twelve aldermen, and commonalty of the borough of Sunderland<note n="*" place="bottom">Reg. Hunt. penes dec. &amp; cap. Dun.</note>. The charter ſtates, that Sunderland had beyond the memory of man been an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient borough, known by the name of the new borough of Weremouth, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in itſelf a certain part, where ſhips had plyed, bringing and carrying merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, as well to and from foreign parts, as from other ports of this kingdom: The articles of exportation therein ſpecified are ſea coals, grind-ſtones, rub-ſtones, and whet-ſtones. It alſo ſtates, that the trade was then greatly increaſed by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſhips reſorting thither; and that the borough anciently enjoyed divers liberties and free cuſtoms, as well by preſcription as by virtue of ſundry charters from the biſhops of Durham, confirmed to them by the crown; which from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in form proved inſufficient for the ſupport of the ancient liberties, privileges, and free cuſtoms of the borough, or to that effect. This charter granted the market and fairs, and appointed the mayor for the time being clerk of the market.</p>

                  <pb n="522" facs="tcp:0782100202:551"/>For reaſons not pointed out to us, this charter was ſuffered to expire; perhaps the miſeries of thoſe times, and the dreadful convulſions of the ſtate, cauſed it to be neglected. But though the members of the incorporation did not long preſerve their juriſdiction, the privileges granted to the inhabitants were aſſumed, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in ſeveral ſuits at law, particularly touching the herbage of the town-moor, with the ſoil thereof: This common conſiſts of about ſeventy or eighty acres only. In the caſe of Hicks verſus Clerk, Lev. 2d part. p. 252, the cuſtom is ſtated, that <q>Sunderland is an ancient borough, conſiſting of twelve capital burgeſſes, called burgeſſes, and twelve inferior burgeſſes, called ſtallingers, and that each freeman occupying a houſe had commonage for two horſes and four cows, and each ſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger for one cow; and that the widow of a freeman or ſtallinger, being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, had the like commonage after the huſband's death.</q> Upon error the judgment eſtabliſhing this cuſtom was affirmed <note n="*" place="bottom">

Sunderland a diſtinct pariſh from the pariſh of Biſhopweremouth; in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble of which it is ſtated, that Sunderland contained ſix thouſand ſouls and upwards, and that a beautiful church had been erected, with a veſtry-room, and a dwelling-houſe for a miniſter or rector to live in, upon a parcel of ground, part of one of the common fields of Sunderland, and within the manor and borough of Sunderland, called the Intack, and had incloſed or doled out a parcel of ground adjoining thereto for a cemetery or church-yard. By this act Sunderland was made a rectory, the patronage of which ſhould for ever appertain to the biſhop of Durham. A veſtry or aſſociation of inhabitants was inſtituted by this act, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of twenty-four perſons having freehold eſtates of the yearly value of 10l. to be choſen by the pariſhioners, and to continue in office three years, and ſo a ſucceſſion to be choſen every three years, in which veſtry-men was veſted a power to make ordinances and by-laws, for the regulation of the new pariſh, to be ratified by two juſtices, to appoint a ſcavenger, and to aſſeſs on eſtates, real and perſonal, and ſtock in trade, a ſufficient ſum for the purpoſes therein mentioned, and particularly for paying to the rector a yearly ſtipend of eighty pounds, and to the clerk ten pounds, and a competent ſum to the ſcavenger, to be levied by warrant from two or more juſtices of the peace.

               <p>The trade of Sunderland is very conſiderable: In the Deſcription of England and Wales, page 265<note n="*" place="bottom">Alſo England Diſplayed, publiſhed by Ruſſell and Owen, 1769.</note>, it is thus ſpoken of, <q>It is a well-built populous ſea port town, having a fine church, which the late rector, Mr Newcomb, ſpent the greateſt part of his income in beautifying and adorning. He began by building a dome adjoining to the eaſt end, into which he removed the altar, placing it under a canopy of inlaid work, ſupported in front by two fluted columns of the Corinthian order; but this gentleman died before he had finiſhed his intended improvements. From the coal trade the inhabitants derive great wealth: The coal is ſo remarkable for burning ſlow, that it is ſaid to make three fires. The port was formerly ſo ſhallow, that ſhips were obliged to take in their lading in the open road, which was ſometimes attended with very great danger to the keelmen, who bring the coals down to the ſhips; on this account the veſſels which loaded here, were uſually ſmaller than in the neighbouring ports; but as they ride in the open ſea, they no ſooner get in their lading than they are ready to ſail, which is a conſiderable advantage, as they have been known to ſteer from thence, to deliver their coals at London, to beat up againſt the wind in their return, and to get back before the ſhips at Shields, which were loaden before them, had been able to get over the bar: But this inconvenience has been in a great meaſure removed. The town is much improved and increaſed within theſe fifty years. The principal ſtreet is of great length, and of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able breadth, parallel to which runs another, but narrower, beſides a great number of others. The town, with the adjacent hamlets of Biſhopweremouth,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:0782100202:554"/>
Biſhopweremouth ſalt-pans, Monkweremouth, and the north ſhore ſide, contain about twenty thouſand inhabitants. Thoſe who are delighted with ſea proſpects may here ſee twenty or thirty ſail of ſhips coming in with a flowing tide, from the coaſting and foreign parts, fifteen or twenty going out on their reſpective voyages, and thirty or forty ſail at anchor in the road, taking in their cargoes. Here is a very fine pier, which affords a pleaſant walk, as well as ſhelter for the ſhips, and is ſaid to have coſt about 19,000l. They have alſo deepened the ſouth channel, by taking up part of the rock. So great is the trade of Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that in 1752, there belonged to this port alone about one hundred and ninety ſhips, which are chiefly loaden with coals, the ſtaple commodity of the place, and the produce of the adjacent country, whence many people are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and great ſums brought in. In the ſummer ſeaſon there are about ten thouſand tons of lime and lime-ſtone, carried from this river, in ſmall ſloops of about twenty or thirty tons.

                     </table> This account is exactly tranſcribed from the cuſtom-houſe books of that year, and many of theſe ſhips were from one hundred to five hundred tons burthen. The amount of the duties of goods exported and imported from and to foreign parts com. ann. is about 10,000l. And as it is computed that about 260,000 Wincheſter chaldrons of coals are carried coaſtwiſe, whereon there is a duty of five ſhillings a chaldron on delivery, amounting to 65,000l. the whole revenue ariſing to the crown from the imports, exports, and produce of Sunderland, may be reckoned about 75,003l. per annum, ſo that poſſibly, with reſpect to the duty ariſing from it, it may be the ſixth, or at leaſt the ſeventh port in the kingdom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In addition to the preceding account, it is to be obſerved, that the chief or high ſtreet of Sunderland is nearly a mile in length, the houſes well built with brick; the low ſtreet which runs parallel thereto, and adjoins upon the quay, is narrow and extremely populous: There are ſome new ſtreets which run from the upper ſide of the high ſtreet, containing ſeveral elegant buildings. In regard to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, in the year 1681, there were 83 burials in Biſhopweremouth, which being multiplied by 30, (the average number which hath been found on general calculations of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ths in this county) would make the number of ſouls in Were<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth and Sunderland 2490. The number of burials in Weremouth in the year 2781 was 153, and in Sunderland 382, which on the like calculation, will give
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:0782100202:555"/>
16,050, to which if we add 4890 for Monkweremouth, the whole number of ſouls will be 20,940. By the above account it appears the increaſe in population in one century was not leſs than 18,450 ſouls. The pier which was erected at the mouth of the river, in the coal owners caſe in 1766, before referred to, on the 21ſt of December, 1765, had coſt 50,000l. and would then require 30,000l. more to perfect it. There are 350 veſſels and upwards belonging to this port; and from the 5th of July to the 10th of Auguſt, 1776, incluſive, there were cleared at the cuſtom-houſe 980 ſail of ſhips coal-loaden, and above 100 veſſels with lime: 5700 veſſels cleared here in one year; and this navigation was performed by 1100 dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent veſſels <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr Robert Walker's minutes.—Williamſon comptroller's clerk and deputy cuſt.</note>.

No burials are permitted within the church. Above the veſtry is a ſmall parochial library. Beſides this church an elegant chapel was erected by ſubſcription in the year 1769, dedicated to St John: The miniſter's ſtipend, with the clerk's fee, and other inferior officers, are paid by the annual rents of the pews, which are farmed out: It has a good organ. Much attention was paid to this laudable inſtitution by John Thornhill, <abbr>eſq</abbr> who has the right of preſentation for twenty-one years from the time of conſecration. There are alſo three diſſenting meeting-houſes, and one maſs-houſe in this place:

                  </note>: If the ſea, in the beginning of the fourteenth century, formed a creek or bay there, the land on which Sunderland now ſtands would at high water be almoſt totally diſſevered from the main; and the deep gulleys ſhew a probability that ſuch was the caſe: The ſhore has greatly changed its figure in the courſe of four hundred years, and perhaps ſome art was uſed to exclude the ſea from that courſe, when the haven of Sunderland grew into fame, and the coal trade began upon Were.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This town has been honoured by our kings in giving title of earl to ſeveral noble families, viz. Emanuel lord Scroope of Bolton, who having been firſt made preſident of the king's council in the north by king James I. the 6th of February, 1618, was by his ſon Charles I. created earl of Sunderland, the 19th of June, 1628: But dying without lawful iſſue, the ſame king created Henry lord Spencer of Wormleighton (in reſpect to his approved loyalty and adherence to him in the civil wars then on foot) earl of Sunderland, but he enjoyed his honour a ſmall time, being ſlain the ſame year at the battle of Newbury, leaving a ſon Robert earl of Sunderland, who died in 1702, and was ſucceeded by Charles earl of Sunderland.</q>

We were told that in repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chancel, a fire grate and tongs of iron were diſcovered below the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and that the walls are conſtructed of ſtone and mud, without lime. The nave and chancel are of an equal width, there being no ailes; the chancel is nine

paces in length, and the nave ſixteen, and five paces in width. There are three windows to the ſouth and two to the north in the nave, and the like number north and ſouth in the choir, with two ſmall windows to the eaſt. The tower is narrow. In the church yard is a ſtone coffin, with a cover, lately dug up; the cover ridged on the top, as if deſigned to ſhut off any water that might come to it; on one ſide of the cover is an inſcription with ſome Saxon characters, <hi>"Hic jacet Richardus vic. de Sehaiam."</hi> In the liſt of incumbents we find two Richards in antiquity, Richard de Overton in 1293, and Richard de Ledyerde in 1451. The probability that this coffin contained the remains of Overton, reſts on the circumſtances of the Saxon character and ſtone coffins being diſuſed in ſo late an aera as the fifteenth century; it was a degree of elegance uſed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient interments to have ſuch coffins. The body was then wound in fine linens. attired in the moſt honourable veſtments, and laid in ſpices; things not ſuited to mean perſonages. Richard de Overton was of ſuch conſequence, that in the twenty-ſecond of Edward I. he had the king's letters of protection <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Prynn, p. 596.</note>.</p>

Boldon Book there were thirteen cottagers in Houghton, each of whom held twelve acres of land, and wrought for the lord two days in each week throughout the year, and four days at harveſt with all their family, except the houſewife, and paid one hen and five eggs: There were alſo three half-cottagers, who held ſix acres each, and wrought two days in each week from Pentecoſt to Martinmas. Henry <hi>praepoſitus,</hi> the reeve or headborough, held two oxgangs of land, conſiſting of twenty-four acres each, for his ſervice. The ſmith had twelve acres, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter a toft and four acres, the pinder had twenty acres and a thrave of corn from each carucate of land in Houghton, Wardon, and Morton, and rendered ſixty hens and three hundred eggs. Newbottle and Biddick mills, with a moiety of Rainton mill, produced fifteen marcs. The demeſne with the ſtock of ſheep and paſture, were in the lord's hands. By Hatfield's Survey it appears that Will. Milby held the malting or brewery of Houghton, under the yearly rent of 10s. and that one Elwick had the common bakehouſe at 2s. rent; that there was only one free tenant in Houghton, Iſabell the wife of Rob. de Weſſynton, who held lands of 13s. 4d. <hi>fee-farm,</hi> theretofore the eſtate of John de Cornhill; but we are not able to trace down the poſſeſſion by the inquiſitions <hi>poſt mortem,</hi> under the ſucceeding prelates<note n="*" place="bottom">

The chapel was built by Mr Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and ſtalled and wainſcotted with Iriſh oak at the ſame time that he erected the preſent manſion-houſe. The tower was erected by John Kelyng, clerk, about the year 1483. He being rector, began to incloſe, fortify, and embattle a houſe above the lower porch within his rectory, with a wall of lime and ſtone, and to make a fortreſs of it without licence: Biſhop Dudley pardoned the offence, and in conſideration of a fine paid, granted him licence to embattle the houſe, and make it a fortreſs for himſelf and ſucceſſors for ever<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. About eighty years after Kelyng's time, Bernard Gilpin expended upon the rectory and out-buildings near three hundred pounds, as he informs us in his will; but the greateſt improvements were made by Mr George Davenport, who continued rector from 1664 to 1677; he rebuilt the manſion-houſe and chapel at his own expence, as well as the garden walls, and repaired the offices.</p>
               <p>The church ſtands on a riſing ground †, in the center of a ſquare area, formed by the buildings of the lower part of the town: It is in the form of a croſs, with the tower in the center. The chancel is in length fourteen paces to the ſteps which aſcend to the communion table, and within the rail four paces; the width ſix paces. It was ſome years ago wainſcotted, and ſtalled on each ſide, probably by Mr Davenport; for on the north ſide is a ſhield bearing the arms of biſhop <figure>

being much decayed, was removed by the preſent rector, and the chancel is now fitted up with plaiſter in an elegant ſtile. The ſtalls too, being much decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have been repaired. The eaſt window, conſiſting of five lights, is under a pointed arch. There are beſide five other windows in the chancel, one of four lights under a flat arch, three under pointed arches, divided by a ſmall pilaſter, and an adjoining one under a flat arch. The tower ſtands on four columns, giving an interior ſquare of ſix paces, opening on every ſide to form the croſs, and lead to the four limbs of the building. The nave is twenty-four paces in length from the pillars of the ſquare, and has regular ailes formed by rows of three uniform cluſtered columns ſupporting pointed arches, which at the weſtern extremity ſpring from pilaſters of ſimilar form with the pillars; the whole having great ſymmetry, and being of beautiful architecture. The width of the nave, with its ailes, is twelve paces. The ſide lights are regular, four on each ſide, and modern. The weſt window conſiſts of five lights under a pointed arch. The reading deſk is placed againſt the north weſt corner pillar, and the pulpit oppoſite to it. There is at preſent in agitation a plan for rebuilding the ſtalls and ſeating the church, many of which are now ruinous and much decayed; for removing the old organ, and introducing a new one in a gallery to be erected againſt the north wall of the church. The organ is placed in the ſouth limb of the croſs. The windows at the extremities of the croſs are under pointed arches: One limb of this croſs, but whether the north or ſouth we cannot aſcertain, is called Trinity porch. The nave is ceiled and ſtuccoed, and very clean.</p>

                     <p>Gilpin's tomb adjoins to an altar tomb, on which lies the effigy of a man in armour, with a ſhield on his left arm; there is no inſcription to denote what perſonage was interred here, but tradition reports this is the tomb of Sir John Le Spring, knight, of an ancient reſident family that had taken the local name De le Spring. Collyns, in the 3d volume of his Peerage, page 244, gives the following account of the ſame figure: <q>In the church at Houghton is yet remaining a figure of a knight in armour, in a praying poſture, with his ſword by his ſide, repoſing his head on a cuſhion, and at his feet a lion. This is ſaid to be for Sir Rowland Belaſiſe, (of Bewley, knt) knighted at the battle of Lewes in Suſſex, 48th king Henry III. when the king was taken priſoner by Simon Montfort earl of Leiceſter, and other barons.</q>

                  <pb n="544" facs="tcp:0782100202:575"/>The reader perhaps expects ſome ſhort anecdotes in this place, of that excellent man Bernard Gilpin; we have ſelected ſeveral particulars given by William Gilpin, A. M. of Queen's College, Oxford, and others his biographers.</p>
               <p>Bernard Gilpin, deſcended from a good family in Weſtmoreland, was born at Kentmire in that county, in the year 1517<note n="*" place="bottom">His father's elder brother was ſlain in the battle of Boſworth field, being heir in the fifth deſcent to Richard Gilpin, who in the reign of king John was enfeoffed in the lordſhip of Kentmire-hall, by the baron of Kendal, for his ſingular ſervices.</note>. From his earlieſt youth he was inclined to a contemplative life; was thoughtful, reſerved, and ſerious. His firſt years were ſpent at a public grammar ſchool, from whence, at the age of ſixteen, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to Oxford, and entered upon the foundation at Queen's College. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf cloſely to his ſtudies, and made a conſiderable proficiency in the
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:0782100202:576"/>
learning of the times. Having determined to ſtudy divinity, that he might read the ſcriptures, he ſet out with great induſtry to gain a thorough knowledge of the Greek and Hebrew languages, in which he was much aſſiſted by Mr Neal, a fellow of New College, and afterwards profeſſor of Hebrew in Oxford.</p>
               <p>At the uſual term he took the degree of maſter of arts, and about the ſame time was elected fellow of his college: But ſhortly after, on account of his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was made choice of among thoſe who were appointed to ſupply the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege newly founded by Cardinal Wolſey, and to which he was accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
               <p>As Mr Gilpin was bred in the Roman Catholic religion, he continued a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time ſteady to that church, and in defence thereof held a diſputation againſt Hooper, afterwards biſhop of Worceſter, in the reign of Henry VIII. But when Edward VI. mounted the throne, Peter Martyr went to Oxford, and there read divinity lectures in a ſtrain to which the univerſity had been little accuſtomed. Mr Gilpin's credit in the univerſity was become conſiderable, the Popiſh party were therefore very ſolicitous to engage him to ſide publicly with them; and when they made the moſt preſſing applications to him for that purpoſe, they found his zeal much cooler than their own. He was not indeed ſatisfied with the Reformers, having had few opportunities of making himſelf acquainted with their arguments: But on the other hand he never was bigoted in his religion. While his mind was in ſo unſettled a condition, he thought himſelf but ill qualified to eſpouſe either ſide publicly. Such importunity was however uſed with him, that at length he yielded, and appeared next day againſt Peter Martyr.</p>
               <p>Mr Gilpin entered into the controverſy againſt his inclination: He reſolved to lay aſide, as much as poſſible, the temper of a caviller, and to place truth before him as the ſole object of his purſuit, from which he was determined not to be drawn aſide either by prejudice or novelty. The diſputation was therefore ſoon over; for Mr Gilpin had nothing of that pride of heart which leads men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend ſuſpected opinions, but gave up his cauſe with that grace which always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſincerity. He owned publicly that he could not maintain it, and determined to enter into no more controverſies till he gained full information of the ſubject <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Peter Martyr took notice of this difference of behaviour, and frequently ſaid, that he was not much troubled either for Weſton, Morgan, or the reſt, (Gilpin's fellow diſputants) <q>but as for that Gilpin, (ſaid he) I am very much moved concerning him; for he doeth and ſpeaketh all things with an upright heart. The reſt ſeem to me to be men who are carried away as it were with every blaſt of ambition and covetouſneſs. But Gilpin, reſting firmly upon gravity and manners, and the teſtimony of a moſt laudable life, ſeemeth to honour with his own goodneſs the cauſe which he undertaketh.</q> Martyr would likewiſe tell his friends, that it was the ſubject of his daily prayers, that God would be pleaſed to touch the heart of this pious prieſt with the knowledge of true religion.</p>
                  </note>. He communicated ſome of his doubts to biſhop Tunſtall, who was his mother's uncle, and had always expreſſed great regard for him, and alſo conferred with Dr Redman <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>Dr J. Redman, or Redmayne, was nearly related to biſhop Tunſtall, and eminently diſtinguiſhed for his learning, the intereſts of which he greatly promoted at Cambridg by his influence and example. Mr Aſcham, in his Schoolmaſter, ſays, <q>At Cambridge, in St John's college, in my time I do know, that not ſo much the good ſtatutes, as two gentlemen of worthy memory, Sir John Cheke and Dr Redman, by their own example of excellency in learning, of godlineſs in living, of diligence in ſtudying, of councel in exhorting, by good order in all things, did breed up ſo many learned men in that one college of St John's at one time, as I believe the whole univerſity of Louvain in many years was never able to afford.</q>
                     </p>
                  </note>, of whoſe virtue and learning he had formed an high opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="546" facs="tcp:0782100202:577"/>As an academic life afforded the moſt leiſure for ſtudy, ſo Mr Gilpin was moſt inclined thereto: He had too juſt a ſenſe of the duty of a clergyman to be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the qualifications requiſite for its diſcharge, and too mean an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of himſelf to think he was yet maſter of them: He judged more learning was neceſſary in that controverſial age, than he had yet acquired; and his chief argument with his friends, who were continually ſoliciting him to leave the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, was, that he was not yet ſufficiently inſtructed in religion himſelf, to be a teacher of it to others. Theſe thoughts continued him at Oxford till the thirty-fifth year of his age; but about that time the vicarage of Norton, in the dioceſe of Durham, falling vacant, his friends prevailed upon him to accept it, though not without much difficulty. Accordingly a preſentation paſſed in November, 1552. But before he took poſſeſſion of his benefice, he was appointed to preach before king Edward VI. who then reſided at Greenwich; Sir William Cecil having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for him a general licence for preaching.</p>
               <p>Mr Gilpin having ſtaid ſome time in London, repaired to his pariſh, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately entered upon the duties of his function. He failed not as occaſions of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, to uſe the king's licence in other parts of the country; but his own pariſh he conſidered as the place where his chief care was due. Here he made it his principal endeavour to inculcate moral virtue, and to diſſuade from thoſe vices which he obſerved moſt prevalent. He ſeldom handled controverted points, being afraid, leſt endeavouring to inſtruct, he might miſlead. At length he thought he had engaged too ſoon in his office, and that he could not properly diſcharge the duties of it; his mind was not ſatisfied, whilſt he merely gave his hearers moral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, overſpread as the country was with diſputed articles of faith, and he conceived he acted improperly in pretending to be a teacher of religion, if he was unable to oppoſe the prevalent errors. Theſe thoughts made every day a greater impreſſion upon him, and at length growing quite unhappy, he wrote an account of his ſituation of mind to biſhop Tunſtall, who was then in the Tower. The prelate thereupon adviſed Mr Gilpin to provide a truſty curate for his pariſh, and to ſpend a year or two in Germany, France, and Holland, by which means he might have an opportunity of converſing with ſome of the moſt eminent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, both Proteſtants and Papiſts. This advice gave Gilpin much ſatisfaction; for a conference with ſome of the learned men abroad was what he had long earneſtly deſired. His principal objection to the ſcheme was, that it would prove too expenſive: But as to that, Tunſtall wrote to him, that his living would do ſomething towards his maintenance, and he would ſupply deficiences. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, did not remove the difficulty; Mr Gilpin's notions of clerical duty were ſo ſtrict, that he thought no excuſe could juſtify non-reſidence for ſo conſiderable a time as he intended to be abroad. He could not, therefore, think of ſupporting himſelf with any part of the income of his living. He was determined to go abroad, and reſolved, if he ſtaid the ſhorter time, to rely only upon his own frugal
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:0782100202:578"/>
management of the little money he had, and to leave the reſt to the biſhop's generoſity. Accordingly he reſigned his living in favour of a worthy man, with whoſe abilities and character he was well acquainted, and then ſet out for London, to receive his laſt orders from the biſhop, and to embark. The account of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation got to town before him, and gave Tunſtall, who was anxious for his kinſman's thriving in the world, great concern. "Here are your friends," ſaid he, <q>endeavouring to provide for you, and you are taking every method to fruſtrate their wiſhes: But be warned; by theſe courſes you will preſently bring yourſelf to a morſel of bread.</q> Mr Gilpin begged the biſhop would attribute what he had done to a ſcrupulous conſcience, which would not permit him to act otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Before he took leave of the biſhop, the latter put into Mr Gilpin's hands a treatiſe he had written upon the Euchariſt, deſiring he would cauſe it to be printed under his inſpection at Paris. Soon after which he embarked for Holland, and upon his landing, went immediately to Mechlin, to viſit his brother George, who was at that time purſuing his ſtudies there. But after a few weeks he went to Louvain, where he reſolved to ſettle for ſome time. He made frequent excurſions to Antwerp, Ghent, Bruſſels, and other places in the Low Countries; where he ſpent ſome weeks with men of reputation, who held both ſides of the controverſial tenets; but he made Louvain his chief place of reſidence, for which city he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expreſſed a more than common affection. Louvain was then one of the moſt diſtinguiſhed places for ſtudents in divinity; ſome eminent divines on both ſides of the queſtion reſided there, and the moſt important topics of religion were diſcuſſed with great freedom.</p>
               <p>Mr Gilpin's firſt buſineſs there was to get himſelf introduced to thoſe of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence for learning; to whom his own addreſs and attainments were no mean re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations. He was preſent at all public readings and diſputations; commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every thing material to writing; re-examined all his opinions; propoſed his doubts in private to his friends; and in every reſpect made the beſt uſe of his time.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he was thus proſecuting his ſtudies, he and the Proteſtants in thoſe parts were alarmed with the melancholy news of the death of king Edward, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful attempt in favour of lady Jane, and the acceſſion of queen Mary: But it came attended with one agreeable circumſtance; an account of biſhop Tunſtall's releaſe from the Tower, and re-eſtabliſhment in his biſhopric. Soon afterwards Mr Gilpin received a letter from his brother George, intreating him to come to Mechlin, to confer on an affair of importance. On his arrival he found his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had received a letter from the biſhop, informing him, that he had found a benefice of conſiderable value vacant in his dioceſe, which he wiſhed he could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade his brother Bernard to accept, imagining he might by this time have got over his former ſcruples: And accordingly George uſed his utmoſt endeavours for this purpoſe, but without effect; Bernard continuing inflexible in his reſolution, not to accept of any benefice without diſcharging the duties of it. He therefore returned to Louvain; but, however, thought it incumbent on him to give the biſhop his reaſons for not accepting his kind offer. The biſhop was not offended
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:0782100202:579"/>
at this letter; for the unaffected piety of it diſarmed all reſentment, and led him rather to admire a behaviour, in which the motives of conſcience ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo ſuperior to thoſe of intereſt.</p>
               <p>Mr Gilpin continued ſome time longer at Louvain, daily improving in religious knowledge. But while he ſtaid in the Low Countries, he was greatly affected with the melancholy ſight of crouds of his dejected countrymen arriving daily in thoſe parts, to avoid the bloody perſecution then carrying on in England. It gave him, however, ſome pleaſure to find, though he was unable perſonally to aſſiſt them, yet his acquaintance in the country furniſhed him with the means of being uſeful to many of them by his recommendations.</p>
               <p>When he had been about two years in Flanders he left Louvain, and went to Paris, where his firſt care was printing the biſhop's book, which he performed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to his ſatisfaction. During his ſtay at Paris he lodged with Vaſcoſan, an eminent printer, to whom he had been recommended by his friends in the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands. This learned man ſhewed him great regard, did him many friendly offices, and introduced him to the moſt conſiderable perſons in the city.</p>
               <p>Mr Gilpin having ſpent three years abroad, returned into England in 1556, whilſt the perſecution was ſtill carrying on againſt the Proteſtants. Biſhop Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall received his kinſman with great kindneſs, and ſoon after his arrival gave him the archdeaconry of Durham, to which the rectory of Eaſington was annexed. He immediately repaired to his pariſh, where he preached with great boldneſs againſt the vices, errors, and corruptions of the times; and by virtue of his office of archdeacon, he alſo took great pains to reform the manners of the clergy. His free reproofs ſoon rouſed the eccleſiaſtics of thoſe parts againſt him, and put them upon every method in their power to remove ſo inconvenient an enquirer. The popular clamour amongſt them was, that Gilpin was an enemy to the church, a ſcandalizer of the clergy, and a preacher of falſe doctrines; and that religion muſt ſuffer from the hereſies he was daily uttering, if he was ſuffered any longer<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>
                        <q>Some found great fault, for that I preached repentance and ſalvation by Chriſt; and did not make whole ſermons, as they did, about tranſubſtantiation, purgatory, holy water, images, prayers to ſaints, and ſuch like.</q>

                  </note>. In ſhort, a charge of hereſy, conſiſting of thirteen articles, was drawn up againſt him, and he was accuſed in form before the biſhop of Durham. But Tunſtall, who was much practiſed in the world, eaſily found a method of diſmiſſing the cauſe in ſuch a manner as to protect his nephew, without endangering himſelf. The malice of his enemies could not reſt, and they created him ſo much trouble, that not being able to undergo the fatigue of duty, he begged leave of the biſhop to reſign either the archdeaconry or his pariſh, which his lordſhip thought fit: To which the biſhop anſwered, that the income of the former was not a ſupport without the latter, and that he could not conſent to their being ſeparated. Upon this Mr Gilpin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned both of them; but the biſhop ſoon after preſented him with the rectory of Houghton-le-Spring.</p>
               <p>This extenſive rectory, containing no leſs than fourteen villages, had been as much neglected in that dark age, as the cures in the north then generally were.
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:0782100202:580"/>
All ancient cuſtoms and ceremonies were carried higher than in moſt other places, and were conſidered as the eſſentials of religion. And it is ſaid, through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned neglect of biſhops and juſtices of the peace, king Edward's proclamations for a change of worſhip had not even been heard of in this part of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, at the time of that prince's death.</p>
               <p>Such was the condition of the pariſh of Houghton when it was committed to the care of Mr Gilpin; deſcribed by his biographers and other writers, to be then a waſte ſo miſerably uncultivated, that the greateſt induſtry ſeemed neceſſary to bring it into any kind of order; and the greateſt reſolution was requiſite in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. But when the good of mankind was concerned, this true chriſtian mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had reſolution to attempt whatever induſtry could accompliſh. He was grieved to ſee ignorance and vice prevail: But he did not deſpair. The people crouded about him, and heard him with great attention, perceiving him to be a teacher of a very different kind from thoſe to whom they had been accuſtomed.</p>
               <p>When Mr Gilpin took poſſeſſion of Houghton, he found the parſonage-houſe gone ſo to decay, that he could not reſide in it; part of it was ſitted up as ſoon as poſſible for his reception, but he continued improving and enlarging it till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſuitable to his hoſpitable temper, a proper habitation for a man who never intended to keep what he had, to himſelf. Soon after his acceptance of the rectory
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:0782100202:581"/>
of Houghton, Tunſtall urged him to accept of a ſtall then vacant in the cathedral church of Durham, telling him, that there lay not the ſame objection to this as to the archdeaconry, it being quite a ſinecure, and therefore he would have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable pretence for refuſing it. But Mr Gilpin, unwilling to accept it, told the biſhop, that by his bounty he had already more wealth, than, he was afraid, he ſhould give a good account of. He begged, therefore, he might not have an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional charge, but that his lordſhip would rather beſtow this preferment on one by whom it was more wanted.</p>
               <p>Mr Gilpin now lived in a retired manner, and gave no immediate offence to the clergy; the experience he had of their temper made him more reſerved. Indeed he uſed more caution than he could afterwards approve; for in his future life he would often tax his behaviour at this time with weakneſs and cowardice. But all his caution was ineffectual; for he was ſoon formally accuſed before the biſhop of Durham, who again found means to protect him. The malice of his enemies ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in part; for Tunſtall's favour from this time viſibly declined, and he ſtruck him out of his will, of which he had before made him the executor. This loſs gave Mr Gilpin little concern: He was ſorry, indeed, to ſee the biſhop diſguſted; he acknowledged his great obligations to him; and would have given up any thing to have him ſatisfied, except his conſcience. But good conſcience, he was aſſured, was his beſt friend; and he was reſolved not to part with it for any mortal friend upon earth.</p>
               <p>His enemies, in the mean time, were not thus ſilenced. Enraged at this ſecond defeat, they cauſed thirty-two articles to be drawn up againſt him in the ſtrongeſt manner, and laid before Bonner biſhop of London. Here they went the right way to work: Bonner was a man ſuited to their purpoſe; and accordingly gave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate orders for his apprehenſion. Mr Gilpin being no ſtranger to the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing zeal of the biſhop of London, had no ſooner notice of the perſecution, than he prepared for martyrdom: He cauſed a long garment to be provided, that he might go in the more decent manner to the ſtake, and ſet out for London. In his way thither he broke his leg, which put a ſtop for ſome time to his journey. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in whoſe cuſtody he was, it is ſaid, took occaſion from thence maliciouſly to retort upon him an obſervation that he would frequently make, <q>that nothing happens unto us but what is intended for our good,</q> aſking him, whether he thought his broken leg was ſo intended? He anſwered meekly, he made no queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but it was: And indeed ſo it proved in the ſtricteſt ſenſe; for before he was able to travel, queen Mary died, and he was ſet at liberty. Whether all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of this ſtory are true or not, thus much however is certain, that the account of the queen's death met him upon the road, and put a ſtop to any further proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
               <p>Mr Gilpin being thus providentially reſcued from his enemies, returned to Houghton, through crowds of people, expreſſing the utmoſt joy, and bleſſing God for his deliverance. The following year he loſt his friend and relation biſhop Tunſtall; but he ſoon experienced, that worth like his would naturally procure friends. When the popiſh biſhops were deprived, the earl of Bedford recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:0782100202:582"/>
him to queen Elizabeth for the biſhopric of Carliſle, and took care that a congé d'elire ſhould be ſent down to the dean and chapter for that purpoſe: But Mr Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin declined this promotion; and when much preſſed to aſſign his reaſons for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing it, he ſaid, that if any other biſhopric but Carliſle had been offered to him, he poſſibly might have accepted it: <q>But in that dioceſe (ſaid he) I have ſo many friends and acquaintance, of whom I have not the beſt opinion, that I muſt either connive at many irregularities, or draw upon myſelf ſo much hatred, that I ſhould be leſs able to do good there than any one elſe.</q> Mr Gilpin perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his refuſal, the biſhopric was at length given to Dr Beſt. The year after he had an offer made him of the provoſtſhip of Queen's College in Oxford; which he likewiſe declined.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Gilpin continued to reſide at Houghton, diſcharging the duties of his function in the moſt exemplary manner. When he firſt took upon himſelf the care of a pariſh, he laid it down as a maxim, to do all the good in his power there; and accordingly his whole conduct was only one ſtreight line drawn to this point. He ſet out with making it his endeavour to gain the affections of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhioners. Many of his papers ſhew how material a point he conſidered this. To ſucceed in it, however, he uſed no ſervile compliances: He ſtudied that his means ſhould be good as well as his end. His behaviour was free without levity, obliging without meanneſs, and inſinuating without art. He condeſcended to the weak, bore with the paſſionate, and complied with the ſcrupulous; and in a truly apoſtolic manner, "became all things to all men." By theſe means he gained upon his neighbours, and convinced them how heartily he was their friend.</p>
               <p>To his humanity and courteſy he added an unwearied application to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of thoſe under his care. He was not ſatisfied with the advice he gave in public, but uſed to teach in private; and brought his pariſhioners to come to him with their doubts and difficulties. He had a moſt engaging manner towards thoſe whom he thought well-diſpoſed: Nay, his very reproof was ſo conducted, that it ſeldom gave offence; the becoming gentleneſs with which it was urged, made it always appear the effect of friendſhip. Thus, with unceaſing aſſiduity, did he employ himſelf in admoniſhing the vicious, and encouraging the well-diſpoſed, by which means, in a few years, he made a greater change in his neighbourhood than could well have been imagined. A remarkable inſtance what reformation a ſingle man may effect, when he hath the pious purpoſe earneſtly at heart!</p>
               <p>But his hopes were not ſo much in the preſent generation, as in the ſucceeding. It was an eaſier taſk, he found, to prevent vice than to correct it; to form the young to virtue, than to amend the bad habits of the old: He employed much of his time, therefore, in endeavouring to improve the minds of the younger part of his pariſh; ſuffering none to grow up in ignorance of their duty, but preſſing it as the wiſeſt part to mix religion with their labour, and amidſt the cares of this life, to have a conſtant eye upon the next. He attended to every thing which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived might be of ſervice to his pariſhioners. He was aſſiduous to prevent all law ſuits. His hall, it is ſaid, was often thronged with people, who came to ſubmit their differences to his judgment. He was not much acquainted with law, but
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:0782100202:583"/>
could decide equitably, and that ſatisfied: Nor could his ſovereign's commiſſion have given him more weight than his own character. His hoſpitable manner of living was the admiration of the whole country. He ſpent in his family every fortnight forty buſhels of corn, twenty buſhels of malt, and a whole ox, beſides a proportionable quantity of other kinds of proviſion. Strangers and travellers found in his houſe a chearful reception: All were welcome that came; and even their horſes had ſo much care taken of them, that it was humorouſly ſaid, <q>If a horſe was turned looſe in any part of the country, it would immediately make its way to the rector of Houghton's.</q>

               <p>Every Sunday, from Michaelmas till Eaſter, was a ſort of public day with him. During this ſeaſon he expected to ſee all his pariſhioners and their families. For their reception he had three tables well covered: The firſt was for gentlemen, the ſecond for huſbandmen and farmers, and the third for day labourers. This piece of hoſpitality he never omitted, even at ſeaſons when its continuance was rather difficult to him: He thought it his duty, and that was a deciding motive. When he was abſent from home, no alteration was made in his family expences: The poor were fed as uſual, and his neighbours entertained: And he was always glad of the company of men of merit and learning, who greatly frequented his houſe.</p>
               <p>When lord Burleigh, then lord treaſurer, was ſent by queen Elizabeth to tranſact ſome affairs in Scotland, that celebrated ſtateſman reſolved, on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, to pay a viſit to Mr Gilpin. Amidſt the hurry of this journey he could not reſiſt the deſire of ſeeing a man whoſe name was every where ſo reſpectfully men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. His free diſcourſe from the pulpit to king Edward's court, had early re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended him to this noble perſon; from which time the great diſtance between them had wholly interrupted their acquaintance. Lord Burleigh's return was ſo ſudden, that he had no time to give any notice of his intended viſit. But the oeconomy of ſo plentiful a houſe as Mr Gilpin's was not eaſily diſconcerted. He received his noble gueſt with ſo much politeneſs, and treated him and his whole retinue in ſo affluent a manner, that the treaſurer would often ſay, <q>he could hardly have expected more at Lambeth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>While lord Burleigh ſtaid at Houghton, he took great pains to acquaint himſelf with the order and regularity with which every thing was managed. The houſe contained a very large family; and was beſides continually crowded with perſons of all kinds, gentlemen, ſcholars, workmen, farmers, and poor people: Yet there was never any confuſion; every one was conducted to a proper apartment, and entertained, directed, or relieved, as his particular buſineſs required. He could not but pleaſe this wiſe lord, who was ſo well acquainted with the effects of order and regularity in the higheſt ſphere, to obſerve them even in this humble one. Here too he ſaw true ſimplicity of manners, and every ſocial virtue regulated by exact prudence. The ſtateſman began to unbend; and he could ſcarcely avoid compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a kind of envious eye, the unquiet ſcenes of vice and vanity at which he was frequently preſent, with the calmneſs of this amiable retreat. At length with reluctance he took his leave; and with all the warmth of affection, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing his much reſpected friend, told him, <q>He had heard great things in his
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:0782100202:584"/>
commendation, but had now ſeen what far exceeded all that he had heard. If, added he, Mr Gilpin, I can ever be of any ſervice to you, at court, or elſewhere, uſe me with all freedom as one you may depend on.</q> When he had got to Rainton-hill, which riſes about a mile from Houghton, and commands the vale, he turned his horſe to take once more a view of the place; and having kept his eye fixed upon it for ſome time, his reverie broke out into this exclamation: <q>There is the enjoyment of life indeed! Who can blame that man for not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a biſhopric! What doth he want to make him greater, or happier, or more uſeful to mankind!</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr Gilpin continued to diſcharge the duties of his miniſterial office in the moſt conſcientious, benevolent, and laborious manner. But notwithſtanding all this painful induſtry, and the large ſcope it had in ſo extended a pariſh, he thought the ſphere of his benevolence yet too confined. It grieved him to ſee in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent pariſhes ſo much ignorance and ſuperſtition, occaſioned by the ſhameful neglect of the paſtoral care in the clergy of thoſe parts. He was induced to ſupply, as far as he was able, what was wanting in others. For this purpoſe every year he regularly viſited the moſt neglected pariſhes in Northumberland, York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Cheſhire, Weſtmoreland, and Cumberland; and that his own pariſh, in the mean time, might not ſuffer, he was at the expence of a conſtant aſſiſtant. In each place he ſtayed two or three days; and his method was, to call the people about him, and lay before them, in as plain a way as poſſible, the danger of leading wicked, or even careleſs lives; explaining to them the nature of true religion; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them in the duties they owed to God, their neighbour, and themſelves; and ſhewing them how greatly a moral and religious conduct would contribute to their preſent, as well as future happineſs.</p>
               <p>As Mr Gilpin had all the warmth of an enthuſiaſt, though under the direction of a very calm and ſober judgment, he never wanted an audience, even in the wildeſt parts; where he rouſed many to a ſenſe of religion, who had contracted the moſt inveterate habits of inattention to every thing of a ſerious nature. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he came, he uſed to viſit the gaols and places of conſinement, few in the kingdom having at that time any appointed miniſter; and by his labours, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate manner of behaviour, is ſaid to have reformed many very abandoned perſons in thoſe places. He likewiſe employed his intereſt for criminals, whoſe caſes were attended with any hard circumſtances, and often procured pardons.</p>
               <p>Redeſdale and Tinedale, in Northumberland, of all barbarous places in the north, were at that time looked upon to be the moſt barbarous; before the Union, the common theatre where the Scots and Engliſh were continually acting their bloody ſcenes: Inhabited by a kind of deſperate banditti, rendered fierce and active by conſtant rapine, warfare, and alarms; they lived by theft, and uſed to plunder on both ſides of the barrier. In this dreadful country, where no man would then even travel that could help it, Mr Gilpin never failed to ſpend ſome part of the year. He generally choſe the Chriſtmas holidays for this journey, becauſe he found the people at that ſeaſon diſengaged, and moſt eaſily aſſembled. He had ſet places for preaching, which were regularly attended. If he came where there
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:0782100202:585"/>
was a church, he made uſe of it; if not, of barns, or any other large building, where crowds of people were ſure to follow him, ſome for his inſtructions, and others for his charity.</p>
               <p>The diſintereſted pains he took among thoſe barbarous people, and the good offices he was always ready to do them, drew from them the warmeſt and ſincereſt expreſſions of gratitude. Indeed he was little leſs than adored among them. One inſtance that is related, ſhews how greatly he was revered: By the careleſſneſs of his ſervant, his horſes were one day ſtolen: The news was quickly propagated, and every one expreſſed the higheſt indignation at the fact. The thief was rejoicing over his prize, when by the report of the country he found whoſe horſes he had taken. Terrified at what he had done, he inſtantly came trembling back, confeſſed the fact, and returned the horſes.</p>
               <p>We have already ſpoken of Mr Gilpin's generous and hoſpitable manner of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The value of his rectory was about four hundred pounds a year: An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at that time very conſiderable, but yet in appearance very unproportionate to the generous things he did: Indeed he could not have done them, unleſs his frugality had been equal to his generoſity. His friends, therefore, wondered to find him, amidſt his many great and continual expences, entertaining the deſign of building and endowing a grammar ſchool: A project, however, which his exact oeconomy ſoon enabled him to accompliſh, though the expence of it amounted to upwards of five hundred pounds<note n="*" place="bottom">

And if any other livings belong to him, he ſhall farm them forth to others, that they may be no hindrance to his teaching; yet if it ſo happen that he ſhall take any ſpiritual living, then he ſhall not have the benefit of his ſchool above one year after his induction.</q> Then followeth an order touching the maſter's marriage, which is to be with the conſent of both governors and two juſtices of the peace.</p>
                                 <p>Rules concerning the uſher follow in this place. <q>His election ſhall be wholly in the governors' hands, unleſs by ſpecial authority and direction unto the maſter there be power granted to him from the governors to chooſe,</q> &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="555" facs="tcp:0782100202:586"/>
to flouriſh; and there was ſo great a reſort of young people to it, that in a
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:0782100202:587"/>
little time the town was not able to accomodate them. He put himſelf, therefore,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:0782100202:588"/>
to the inconvenience of fitting up a part of his own houſe for that purpoſe, where he ſeldom had fewer than twenty or thirty children. Some of theſe were the ſons of perſons of diſtinction, whom he boarded at eaſy rates; but the greater part were poor children, whom he not only educated, but cloathed and maintained: He was likewiſe at the expence of boarding in the town many other poor children, ſeveral of whom he brought every year from the different parts where he preached, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Redeſdale and Tinedale. For the maintenance of poor ſcholars, whom he ſent to the univerſities, he yearly ſet apart ſixty pounds. This ſum he always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and often more. His common allowance to each ſcholar was about ten pounds a year, which for a ſober youth was at that time a very ſufficient mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſo that he never maintained fewer than ſix. By his will it appears, that at his death he had nine upon his liſt, whom he took care to provide for during their ſtay at the univerſity.</p>
               <p>As to his ſchool, he not only placed able maſters in it, procured from Oxford, but likewiſe conſtantly inſpected it himſelf. And that encouragement might quicken the application of his boys, he always took particular notice of the moſt forward: He would call them his own ſcholars, ſend for them often into his ſtudy,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:0782100202:589"/>
and there inſtruct them himſelf. One method uſed by him to fill his ſchool was a little ſingular. Beſides thoſe whom he ſent from his own ſchool to the univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and there wholly maintained, he likewiſe gave to others, who were in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to do ſomething for themſelves, what farther aſſiſtance they needed. By which means he induced many parents to allow their children a liberal education, who otherwiſe would not have done it. He conſidered himſelf as their proper guardian, and eſteemed himſelf bound to the public for their being made uſeful members of it, as far as it lay in his power. With this view he held a punctual correſpondence with their tutors; and made the youths themſelves frequently write to him an account of their ſtudies. So ſolicitous indeed was he about them, that once every year he made a journey to the univerſities, to inſpect their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. And this uncommon, care was not unrewarded; for many of his ſcholars became ornaments to the church, and exemplary inſtances of piety<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Among thoſe of note who were educated by him, theſe three are particularly mentioned; Henry Ayray, George Carleton, and Hugh Broughton.</p>
                     <p>Henry Ayray became afterwards provoſt of Queen's College in Oxford; where he was in great eſteem for his abilities, and exemplary life.</p>
                     <p>George Carleton was a man of worth and learning, and very deſervedly promoted to the See of Chicheſter. He publiſhed ſeveral pieces, which are enumerated by Anthony Wood, and in particular the life of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor Bernard Gilpin.</p>
                     <p>Hugh Broughton was a very learned man, and particularly ſkilled in rabbinical learning. Broughton is ſaid to have been ſo laboriouſly ſtudious, that unleſs he were prevented by ſomething very extraordinary, he ſtudied twelve or fourteen hours, and often ſixteen hours a day. He had a conteſt with Theodore Beza. He died in 1662, as we are told by the famous Dr Lightfoot, who declares himſelf a child in compariſon of this great maſter of Hebrew and rabbinical learning, and mentions an offer that was once made to him of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's hat.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>Every Thurſday throughout the year he cauſed a very large quantity of meat to be dreſſed, wholly for the poor; and every day they had what quantity of broth they wanted. Twenty-four of the pooreſt were his conſtant penſioners. Four times in the year a dinner was provided for them, when they received from his ſteward a certain quantity of corn, and a ſum of money; and at Chriſtmas they had always an ox divided among them.</p>
               <p>In the diſtant pariſhes where he preached, as well as in his own neighbourhood, his generoſity and benevolence were continually ſhewing themſelves; particularly in the deſolate parts of Northumberland. <q>When he began his journey, (ſays an old manuſcript life of him) he would have ten pounds in his purſe, and at his coming home he would be twenty nobles in debt, which he would always pay within a fortnight after.</q> In the gaols he viſited he was not only careful to give the priſoners proper inſtructions, but uſed alſo to purchaſe for them ſuch neceſſaries as they wanted.</p>
               <p>Of his benevolent temper the following inſtance is preſerved. One day return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home, he ſaw in a field ſeveral people crowding together, and judging ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than ordinary had happened, he rode up, and found that one of the horſes in a team had ſuddenly dropped down, which they were endeavouring to raiſe, but in vain, for the horſe was dead. The owner of it ſeemed much dejected with his misfortune; and declaring how grievous a loſs it would be to him, Mr Gilpin bade him not to be diſheartened; "I'll let you have," ſays he, <q>honeſt
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:0782100202:590"/>
man, that horſe of mine,</q> and pointed to his ſervant's. "Ah! maſter," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the countryman, "my pocket will not reach ſuch a beaſt as that." <q>Come, come,</q> ſaid Mr Gilpin, <q>take him, take him; and when I demand my money, then thou ſhalt pay me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Towards the latter part of his life, Mr Gilpin went through his duty with great difficulty. His health was much impaired; for the fatigue he had undergone ſo many years had broken his conſtitution. Thus he complains in a letter to his friend: <q>To ſuſtain all theſe travels and troubles I have a very weak body, ſubject to many diſeaſes; by the monitions whereof I am daily warned to remember death. My greateſt grief of all is, that my memory is quite decayed: My ſight faileth; my hearing faileth; with other ailments, more than I can well expreſs.</q> While he was thus ſtruggling with an advanced age, and much impaired conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there happened a very unfortunate affair, which entirely diſtroyed his health. As he was croſſing the market-place at Durham, an ox ran at him, and puſhed him down with ſuch violence, that it was imagined the bruiſes he received would have occaſioned his death. He lay long confined; and though he again got abroad, he never recovered the little ſtrength he had before, and continued lame as long as he lived. But ſickneſs was not the only diſtreſs which the declining years of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent man had to ſtruggle with. As age and infirmity began to leſſen the weight and influence he once poſſeſſed, the malice and oppoſition of his enemies prevailed more: And he experienced much ingratitude and ill uſage, at a time when he was already ſinking under a weight of cares.</p>
               <p>His pious reſignation under ſuch evils was not long exerciſed. About the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of February, 1583, finding himſelf very weak, and ſenſible his end muſt be drawing near, he told his friends his apprehenſions, and ſpoke of his death with that happy compoſure which attends the concluſion of a good life. He was ſoon after confined to his chamber; but his ſenſes continued perfect to the laſt. A few days before his death he deſired his friends, acquaintance, and dependents might be called into his chamber; and being raiſed in his bed, he addreſſed himſelf to them in a very pathetic manner, earneſtly exhorting them to the practice of piety and virtue. He alſo ſent far ſeveral perſons who had hitherto made no good uſe of his advice, and upon whom he imagined his dying words might have a better effect. But his ſpeech began to ſaulter before he had finiſhed his exhortations. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining hours of his life he ſpent in prayer, and converſation with ſome ſelect friends, mentioning often the conſolations of Chriſtianity; declaring they were the only true ones, and that nothing elſe could bring a man peace at the laſt. He died on the 4th of March, 1583, in the ſixty-ſixth year of his age.</p>
               <p>He is deſcribed to have been tall of ſtature, ſlender, and hawk-noſed. In his diet he was temperate, or rather abſtemious. His parts were good; his imagination, memory, and judgment lively, retentive, and ſolid. His acquirements were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; for by unwearied application he had gained ſo great a ſtore of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that his biographers have ſaid he was ignorant of no part of learning at that time in eſteem. In languages, hiſtory, and divinity, he particularly excelled. He read poetry with a good taſte; and was himſelf, according to biſhop Charleton, no
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:0782100202:591"/>
mean poet. His temper was naturally warm; and in his youth he ſometimes gave way to paſſion; but at length he entirely corrected that infirmity. His diſpoſition was naturally ſerious; yet among his particular friends he was chearful, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times facetious. His general behaviour was very affable. His ſeverity had no object but himſelf; to others he was humble, candid, and indulgent. He had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſkill in the art of managing a fortune; looking upon himſelf barely as a ſteward for other people, and obſerving that his own deſires ſhould not exceed what calm reaſon could juſtify. Extravagance was conſidered by him as a ſpecies of injuſtice; and amidſt his employments he found leiſure to look into his affairs, well knowing that frugality is the ſupport of charity. His intimacies were but few; for it was his endeavour, as the ſpirit of Chriſtianity required, to dilate rather than to contract his affections: Yet where he profeſſed a particular friendſhip, Mr Gilpin was a religious obſerver of its offices: Was the moſt candid interpreter of the words and actions of others. Where he plainly ſaw failings, would make every poſſible allowance for them: Uſed to expreſs a particular indignation at ſlander; often ſaying, it more deſerved the gallows than theft: Was remarkably guarded when he ſpoke of others; conſidering common fame as the falſeſt medium, and a man's reputation as his moſt valuable property: Ever diſplayed the greateſt ſincerity, as well as humility, in his tranſactions with others: But the principal virtues, and diſtinguiſhing parts of his character, were his conſcientious diſcharge of the miniſterial office, extenſive benevolence, and exalted piety. The conſtant tenor of his life was ſo uniformly agreeable to the ſtricteſt rules of morality and religion, that it gained him among his contemporaries the title of the Northern Apoſtle. In his charitable diſtributions, he had no meaſure but the bounds of his income, of which the leaſt portion was always laid out on himſelf: Was the more particularly careful to give away in his life time whatever could be ſaved for the poor, as he had often ſeen and regretted the abuſe of poſthumous charities. <q>It is my deſign, at my departure, (ſaid he, writing to a friend) to leave no more behind me than what will ſerve to bury me, and pay my debts.</q> What little remained he left wholly to the poor, except a few ſlight tokens of remembrance bequeathed to his friends. His uncommon benevolence made him deſervedly ſtiled the father of the poor<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>In the rebellion of the earl of Weſtmoreland, Mr Gilpin retired to Oxford, and in his abſence the rebels who had poſſeſſed Durham, ſcattered themſelves as far as Houghton, and ſeized his barns and cattle, the chief of the plunderers being a perſon whom he had ſaved from the gallows. On Mr Gilpin's return his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions ſaved from execution many of the poor deluded vaſſals, who bad followed their lords.</p>

In purſuance thereof I do hereby deviſe, direct, and appoint, and limit, that the ſaid Ra. Gowland and Rob.

And my will is, that the yearly ſum of forty ſhillings be given to Mr Davenport's part of the hoſpital of Houghton aforeſaid, for ever, and the yearly overplus or profits of the ſaid cloſes over and above the ſaid ſum of ſeven pounds per annum, and taxes and out rents, I will and hereby deviſe, that my ſervant Rob.

And my will is, that the ſaid R. Chapman be tenant for life of the ſaid two cloſes, ſo as he pay the clear ſum of ſeven pounds yearly by half yearly payments, to the truſtees appointed for theſe my charities, or by their order in ſuch manner as before directed, over and above the biſhop's rent, taxes, and charges of future ſurrenders; and that the ſame cloſes ſhall not be plowed but upon abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for the improvement thereof. And I do hereby direct, that when either of them the ſaid Ra. Gowland or Rob. Chilton ſhall die, the ſurvivor of them ſhall ſurrender the ſaid two cloſes to the uſe of the then rector of the pariſh of Houghton aforeſaid; and the governors of the ſchool and hoſpital there, and the truſt afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, ſhall be and remain, and the premiſſes to be ſurrendered by the ſurviving truſtee to the other two ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the deceaſed from time to time for ever on the truſts in this my laſt will and teſtament mentioned and declared concerning the ſame, and the charge of the ſaid ſurrenders to be paid out of the overplus rent."</p>

performed ſervile duties. There were ſixteen of thoſe farmers, who held twenty five ox-gangs of land, each ox-gang containing twelve acres, the rent being 8d. for each ox-gang. They wrought twenty days in harveſt, with one man for each, and harrowed eight days, with one horſe for every two ox-gangs: They made four portions like the tenants of Wardon, with all their families, except the houſewife, beſides the twenty days work in autumn, and they carted or led ſix days hay and corn, and carried eight loads yearly to Durham or Auckland of the lord's baggage. For every carucate of land, they plowed one acre at Houghton, and rendered for each ox-gang one hen and five eggs. In Hatfield's Survey they are called bond tenants, and the ſervice of carriage is there explained to be either for the lord or his ſeneſchal; and that they performed the uſual work at the mill. The office of punder was executed among themſelves, for which they paid annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly xx hens and 100 eggs.

                  </note>. The etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the name of this place is evident, being compounded of <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>ſhaw,</hi> a woody mount or hill. This eminence is the property of General Lambton, and now bears oak and other timber on its ſkirts, and contains lime-ſtone and free-ſtone quarries, with ſeveral valuable mines of coal. The proſpect from thence is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and noble, comprehending many of the chief objects in the eaſtern part of the county, with a beautiful tract of country towards the ſouth and weſt, in which the city of Durham and Cheſter are particularly conſpicuous.</p>
               <p>SOUTH-BIDICK, the ſeat of Mrs Mary Lambton, lies on the banks of the river Were. By the Boldon Book it ſeems as if this manor had anciently appertained to the See of Durham; for it is thereby ſtated, that the villains of South-Bedic held their vill in firm, rendering five pounds rent, and providing eight ſcore men at harveſt, and thirty-ſix carriages to lead corn at Houghton. But in the ſecond year of biſhop Bury, by an inquiſition taken on the death of Alianora de Colleye, it appears ſhe died ſeiſed of the manor of South-Bedyk, juxta Newbotelle, held of the biſhop <hi>in capite,</hi> by homage, fealty, and the quarter part of a knight's ſee, with ſuit at the county; ſo that it ſeems from thence the manor had been aliened from the See<note n="¶" place="bottom">

It appears that this was of dringage ſervice, as the holder fed dog and horſe in proportion to two parts of a dringe.

                  </note>. In Hatfield's Survey, under the title of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in dringage, it is ſet forth, that Tho. Colvyll, knight, in right of his wife, heireſs of Tho. de Eſhe, held two parts of the manor of Eaſt Herrington by foreign ſervice, rendering yearly for cornage 20s. for two parts of a milch cow 4s. and for work 12d. alſo four quarters of oats, ten buſhels of ſcat or ſcac oat meal, and two quarters of malt; alſo providing according to cuſtom one caſtleman, and plowing and harrowing four acres at Newbottle, and working with twelve men at harveſt, paying 12d. for harveſt work at Newbottle on the demeſne there. And that he and thoſe holding under him, ſhould follow the lords court called the halmote, and there plead and be impleaded, and receive right and juſtice. We find thereby that a family had aſſumed the local name, and that Thomas de Herrington held lands of inheritance there by foreign ſervice, as much as appertained to two parts of a dringe, attending the biſhop's great or foreſt chace with two parts of two greyhounds, leading two parts of a ton of wine, attending the court, ſerving in the biſhop's embaſſies, feeding dog and horſe, and working at the mill as the cuſtom was. Colvyll alſo, in his wife's right, held a place called Hayning, containing by eſtimation 100 acres. Will. Robinſon alſo in this early period, held a meſſuage and two oxgangs of land there.

               <p>The next place, in the arrangement of the book of rates, is NEWBOTTLE, a beautiful village on a fine elevated ſituation, a little to the north-weſt of Houghton. In the Boldon Book it is ſet forth, that Newbottle conſiſted of ſixteen cottagers, who each held twelve acres of land, and worked two days in every week through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the year, made four portions of land in autumn, in which work all the family except the houſewife, were to labour, and each cottager rendered one hen and five eggs. There were three other cottagers, who held ſix acres each, and wrought two days in the week between Pentecoſt and Martinmaſs. The greve or head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, and ſmith, had each twelve acres, their fee of ſervice, and the punder had twelve acres, and alſo a thrave of corn from every carucate of land in Newbottle, Biddick, and Herrington, and rendered 40 hens and ccc eggs. The demeſne, which conſiſted of four carucates of land, with the ſheep and paſture, were then in the biſhop's hands. Hugh Boynton, with ſundry others, held the demeſne lands at the time of Hatfield's Survey, containing 312 acres.

                  </note>. In our attention to the city of Durham certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures were formed touching the tradition, that Wardon hill was the ground where St Cuthbert's remains were miraculouſly ſtaid on the return from Ripon, previous to the ſettlement at Durham; in that place were noted the uncertain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ancient writers, and we preſumed to give an opinion, that Wardon was not the place pointed out by the writers of antiquity. Thoſe who treat of our church hiſtory do not mention that any particular veneration was paid to the ſaint's reſting place, till the time of prior Hugh of Darlington, who built a camera, a hall, and chapel at Wardelau, or Wadele. Wardon was from very early times part of the poſſeſſions of the See, but never of the convent, ſo that the prior had no right to enter therein, and build a lodge or hall for the uſe of the cloiſter. The hill of Wardon is a conſiderable eminence, riſing gradually from all ſides but towards the eaſt, where it is more ſteep: There are no remains of buildings to be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on any part of it. The ſimilitude of name to that of the place mentioned by old writers, has led to the error; but if we conſider the names Wardon and Wardona, we ſhall be led into two probable conjectures touching their etymology, either that the eminence commanding an extenſive proſpect by ſea and land, was the ſtation of the warden of the north, in ſome conflicts with the Danes or Scots, and was called the Warden's Law, or Mount; or that this being a mark and guide for ſailors, when the ſmall veſſels of the ancients kept cloſe under the ſhores, and for want of the compaſs dared not in dark weather to truſt themſelves to an open and ſtormy ſea, it was the point of view which ſtruck the eye on paſſing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory of Flamborough or Souter Point, and guided to the mouth of the river Were, gaining thereby the name of Were-Dun, or the Hill of Were. It is left to the reader to judge of theſe conjectures, we having diſcovered no degree of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſupport the tradition, that by miraculous interpoſition, here began the leading events which were to aggrandize the preſent city of Durham.</p>

               <p>COKEN, the ſeat of Ralph Carr, <abbr>eſq</abbr> lies in this pariſh, on the banks of the river Were, where the river forms a beautiful curvature, almoſt to encloſe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting ſcene. The manſion-houſe is ancient, but the ſituation elevated and fine. Mr Pennant, from ſome inadvertency, ſpeaks of it as being the ſeat of St Godric's auſterities; Finchale, where the hermitage ſtood, being on the oppoſite ſide of the river. We repeat part of the deſcription given by that judicious traveller. <q>12 July, ſaw Coken, the ſeat of Mr Carr; a moſt romantic ſituation, laid out with great judgment: The walks are very extenſive, principally along the ſides or at the bottom of great dells, bounded with vaſt precipices, finely wooded; and many parts of the rocks are planted with vines and other fruit trees, which I was told bore well, but late. The river Were winds along the hollows, and forms two very fine reaches, at the place where you enter theſe walks. Its waters are very clear, and its bottom a ſolid rock. The view towards the ruins of Finchal abbey is remarkably great; and the walk beneath the cliffs has a magnificent ſolemnity, a ſit retreat for its monaſtic inhabitants. This was once called the Deſert, and was the rude ſcene of the auſterities of St Godric, who carried them to the moſt ſenſeleſs extravagance. A ſober mind may even at preſent be affected with horror at the proſpect from the ſummits of the cliffs into a darkſome and ſtupendous chaſm, rendered ſtill more tremendous by the roaring of the waters over its diſtant bottom.</q> The houſe and adjacent grounds are ſituated on an eminence, on three ſides waſhed by the river, and towards the eaſt bounded by deep dells, filled with ſtately foreſt trees. The ſouthern ſide of this peninſula is laid out in pleaſure grounds; one wide and extended terrace runs along the ſummit of the cliffs, another at their feet: From the upper terrace fine openings in the wood afford proſpects of the adjacent lands; and in one point of view, you look down upon the ſolemn vale ſcattered with the ruins of the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:0782100202:603"/>
and abbey. The lower terrace is formed on the ſhelves of the rocky ſhore, from whence the cliffs riſe perpendicular near an hundred feet, crowned with hanging oaks, which ſtrike their roots into the fiſſures of the rock, and ſtretch a ſolemn umbrage over the walk. From this terrace the ruins of the religious edifice appear in all their majeſtic beauties, ſhut in by riſing grounds fringed with woods; the river falls over a rocky channel in troubled ſtreams, and the murmurs of the waters are repeated by a ſoothing echo. For religious contemplation, recluſe piety, and ſelf-denial, never was place better adapted; much pity it was ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced by unmeaning ſeverity and hypocriſy! Various are the beautiful ſcenes this walk affords; deſcription is languid; to viſit the place is the only means of forming ideas of its pictureſque excellencies. Proceeding along the eaſtern ſide of the eminence, the walk is carried on the ſummit of a deep and wooded dell, which relieves the eye for ſome time before you enter upon the northern rocks, which are ſhaken, rugged, and truly auguſt; mighty volumes hang over your head, as if the wind which ſhook the oaks would rend the precipice and tumble it into the vale. Several deep grottos formed by nature, are ſhadowed with trees ſuſpended from their roof; haſty ſtreams fall from the cliffs, and with a hollow clamour increaſe the pleaſing ſolemnity of the vaſt ſcene. The river forms a canal near a mile in length, through an avenue of rocks and hanging foreſts; the ſpire of Cheſter church the terminating object. The woods are noble, conſiſting chiefly of oaks of a great age: Nature has laviſhed beauties on this place, and what art has done with an excellent taſte, has ſmoothed her brow where art was wanted, and opened to the eye thoſe beauties her wildneſs would otherwiſe have concealed. In the time of biſhop Galfrid, one Aellafus, a prieſt, gave Coken to the church of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. This is to be underſtood only of part of the territory now called Coken. The firſt lay perſon we find in the ancient records poſſeſſed of lands in Coken, is Alexander de Kibbleſworth, of whom the family of Birtley, in biſhop Hatfield's time, held lands there; they alſo held other lands in Coken of the priory of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham<note n="*" place="bottom">Inq. p. m.

The Lumleys had lands there in biſhop Langley's time.</p>
               <p>OFFERTON was one of the places given by Athelſtan to the See of Durham, as an appendage of Weremouth.

John de Denum, A<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 10, Beaumont.</note>; but from that period we find few traces of it in the records. The manſion-houſe, the ſeat of Francis Middleton, <abbr>eſq</abbr> lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, is pleaſantly ſituated on the brow of a hill, commanding an extenſive proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect up the valley north-eaſtward.</p>

               <p>properly called DALTON-LE-DALE, the ſmall village with the church lying in a very deep and narrow valley, within a mile of the ſea: The ſcenes are romantic, but for want of wood, are deficient in that richneſs which is ſo pleaſing in the vallies further from the ocean. The church is ſmall, and without ailes. There are two table monuments in the chancel, one with a recumbent effigy in ſtone, of a perſon in armour, but without an inſcription.</p>
               <p>Nearer to the ſea lies DALDEN; the vale ſtill deep and narrow, with ſome little wood, which fringes the margin of the brook: The old tower or houſe of Dalden is in ruins, and ſo much deſtroyed as to furniſh no idea of its former conſequence: From the ſituation it appears to have been merely ſtrengthened againſt wandering robbers. Dalden gave name to a reſident family ſo early as biſhop Hatfield's time, when we find William de Dalden held the manor of the lord de Percy, by homage, fealty, and a knight's fee, for which the lord Percy made ſuit at the biſhop's county<note n="*" place="bottom">Inq. p. m. 25 Hatfield.</note>. It became the poſſeſſion of the Bowes's, who held of Henry earl of Northumberland<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  </note> it is mentioned jointly with Thorp, a place a little to the ſouthward. There were thirty-one villains, who held their lands, and performed their ſervices like thoſe of Boldon. By that record it appears there were only two free tenants, Simon and Galfrid Cokeſmaht, who held each half a carucate of land, and ſerved on the biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op's embaſſies. The carpenter, ſmith, and punder each held lands for their ſervices, and the two vills rendered 30s. cornage, and provided two milch cows. The
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:0782100202:609"/>
demeſne was let out, but the paſture and ſheep ſtock were in the hands of the biſhop. In biſhop Bury's time we find one John Fairey was poſſeſſed of a meſſuage and a parcel of land in Eaſington, held of the biſhop <hi>in capite,</hi> by the ſingular ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <q>aiding the biſhop's bailiff to drive goods diſtrained, atteſting ſummonſes, and ſuperintending the carriage of a dole of wine annually.</q> This family held their ſmall poſſeſſion for ſome ages. In Hatfield's Survey the free tenants are named, and all performed the ſervice of embaſſy. The demeſne lands are therein ſtated to be upwards of 300 acres. It appears there were only twenty-nine bond tenants, who occupied thirty-two meſſuages, each holding two oxgangs of land, computing fifteen acres to an oxgang, and paying for work xi s. ix d. for aid, ſcat, or ſcac. pennys, and plow-pennys, at the feaſt of the Virgin 19d. for ſcot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennys, called by the tenants in that diſtrict malt-pennys 15 d. and for aver or plow-pennys at the two feaſts of St Cuthbert, the feaſt of the Nativity, and John the Baptiſt 12d. for woodloads 8d. and at the feaſt of the Purification ſix buſhels of lot oats, at the feaſt of the Nativity two hens, at the Paſſover ten eggs; and in lieu of other work 13 d. They alſo paid 30s. cornage, 40s. for caſtlemen, 12s. in lieu of one milch cow, and carried a ton of wine. In the ſervice of the cottagers was that of collecting the hens, and carrying them to the biſhop's manors. The parcels of freehold in Thorp and Eaſington being very ſmall, it would not be a profitable labour to trace a ſucceſſion of poſſeſſors, we find among them the Guys, Daltons, and Claxtons.</p>
               <p>The town of Eaſington ſtands on an elevated ſituation, the land gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining towards the ſea. At the upper end of the town, on an eminence, is the church, a lofty building; a ſea mark for mariners. The chancel of this church is twelve paces long and ſix wide, with three ſteps aſcending to the table; is ceiled, ſtuccoed, and neatly wainſcotted, with ſome tabernacle work above the table. The eaſt window is formed of three lights, under a pointed arch, with roſe work tracery; and there are three windows to the ſouth, of two lights each, under point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arches. The chancel is divided from the nave by a pointed arch, riſing from corbles, and cloſed with a neat ſcreen, ornamented with foliage and open work in oak. You deſcend by four ſteps into the nave, the length of which is eighteen

paces; divided uniformly by two ſide ailes, formed by three pillars on each ſide, ſupporting pointed arches, the whole width being thirteen paces; the pillars are light; on the ſouth ſide two are octagonal and one round, and on the north ſide two round and one octagonal: The capitals are formed by two treſſes of ſquare projections, and one roll, which hath a good effect. The pulpit is ſupported by the firſt ſouth pillar. The belfry riſes on a circular arch, and the tower is about ſixty feet in height. The nave is lighted by three windows in the ſouth aile, and four upper windows on each ſide of the center aile; and is ſtalled with oak, orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with fleur-de-lis. In the ſouth aile is a burial vault for the family of Conyers of Horden<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note> The town of Hawthorn is pleaſantly ſituated on a dry hill, within half a mile of the ſea: The ſhore is rocky, and broken into a multitude of deep caverns: The offing is full of rocks and ſhoals, ſo that in ſtormy weather it is tremendous to mariners, whilſt the heavy breaker ſhakes the ſounding coaſt. In the mouth of a deep and narrow creek, where the rocks are the moſt broken, rugged, and romantic, admiral Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banke built a ſummer retreat, which he called Sailor's Hall; at high tide it almoſt hangs over the waves, and looks upon the moſt ſtormy and ſhaken part of the ſhore. The placidneſs of a ſummer evening's calm, when the moon is reflected on the ſmooth boſom of the ocean, is highly pleaſing to the contemplative eye; but when the ſtorm lifts the diſtracted waves, with a horrid gloom confounds the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and mixes the ſpray even with the clouds; when the winds groan in the caverns, and the hoarſe billows thunder along the beach; when the ſhrill cries of diſtreſs and wreck ſtrike the ear from wretches without ſuccour; when the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted cattle bellowing leave the hills, and driving ſhowers ſweep the diſconſolate landſcape, little remains to make ſuch a ſituation eligible. On the ſouth ſide of Hawthorn-dean is an eminence called the Beacon Hill, where fires were formerly raiſed, to keep mariners at a diſtance from this dangerous coaſt.</p>

and frequent repairs. The chancel is nearly fourteen paces in length and ſix in

width: On the north ſide are two arches, now built up, which ſhew it formerly was of greater extent. The eaſt end is lighted by three long narrow windows; but to the ſouth is a large window, ornamented with tracery. The chancel is ſeparated from the nave by a heavy round arch without ornament. The body or nave of the church has two ſide ailes, and is in length about eighteen paces, the ailes being little more than three paces wide: The ſouth aile has undergone much alteration; the pillars have been reſtored in modern times, and ſupport five pointed arches: Three windows, of two lights each, under pointed arches, give light to this ſide. The north aile is alſo formed by a row of four pillars; that to the eaſt is flat, ſupporting a pointed arch; the other three are of the old Saxon architecture, ſhort, with plain capitals, the ſhafts fluted and otherwiſe ornamented: They ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port four circular arches, ornamented with the zig-zag mouldings, and ſeem to be of nearly the ſame date as the nave of Durham cathedral: This aile is lighted with two windows under pointed arches. The tower is low, and ſupported by but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, forming an oblong ſquare of five paces eaſt and weſt, and ſeven paces north and ſouth. In the yard are two remarkable monuments of perſonages un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. The one is the recumbent effigy of a man in armour<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide cut of monument in Whitworth church yard, exactly ſimilar to this: One of the effigies in Cheſter church is alſo like it.</note>, the viſor having only a tranſverſe gaſh or aperture: The ſword in the right hand, with the point elevated to the viſor, and the ſhield on the left arm covering the breaſt.

In Shadforth only one free tenant (Thomas) is named, who held two oxgangs of land, rendering 40 d. fee-farm rent, and ſerving on the biſhop's embaſſies.

Sixteen bond tenants held each a meſſuage and two oxgangs of land, each oxgang containing fifteen acres, rendering 16s. a year, to wit, 8s. per oxgang for work; and at the feaſt of the Purification 19d. for ſcat or ſcacpennys, and at the feaſt of St Martin for ſcatpennys, called by the tenants maltpennys, 15d. and for averpennys at the feaſt of St Cuthbert and St John the Baptiſt 12d. They performed their labour like the bond tenants of Boldon in all things; and beſide the rents before ſtated, they paid for plow money at Michaelmas 16d. for harveſt work 12d. and for averpennys at Michaelmas 12d. for every man of the family 12d. and for thoſe under age 6 d. Alſo each bond tenant rendered to the lord ſix buſhels of oats, at the feaſt of the Nativity two hens, and at Eaſter ten eggs; for a milch cow they paid amongſt

               <p>NORTH and SOUTH SHERBURNE are noted in the Boldon Book as members of Queringdonſhire, and probably took their names from the ſhire brook or burn.

In South Sherburn, Chriſtian Cementarius held 60 acres of moor land of the biſhop's gift, rendering 5s. and two oxgangs of land, which were Arkills, for 14d. but which rents were not demanded whilſt he ſerved the biſhop <hi>in opere cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarij,</hi> perhaps as ſeedſman, or ſower of corn on his demeſne.

Alſo ten cottagers, who each held ſix acres, and wrought from the feaſt of St Peter ad vincula, to the feaſt of St Martin two days in each week, and the other half of the year one day in the week.

               <p>Among the pious works of the opulent prelate Hugh de Puteaco, or Pudſey, there is none ſurviving to this age of ſuch importance as the foundation of Sherburn hoſpital, deſigned for the reception of ſixty-five poor lepers, with a maſter and other officers to ſuperintend the ſame, which great and godly work he effected about the year 1181, when that dreadful malady prevailed grievouſly in this land. He dedicated the houſe to Chriſt, the Bleſſed Virgin, Lazarus, and his ſiſters Mary and Martha <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Shyrburne—Clarus ſons Lat. Lel.—Scyreburna, Saxon.—Here is an hoſpital of poore men, which Hugh Puteac, the joly byſhop of Durham, builded in the reigne of K. Hen. II.—<hi>Lambarde's Topog. Dict. p.</hi> 326.</p>
                     <p>Our Saxon anceſtors dedicated many buildings to what they eſteemed pious, and very few to charitable uſes ſolely. Biſhop Tanner has not noticed ſo many as ſix eſtabliſhed by them; but we ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, from this omiſſion, that they were regardleſs of their fellow creatures labouring under the various calamities incident to human nature, who were unable to help themſelves. In general, the poor were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the religious ſocieties, and the members of each were enjoined by the rules of their reſpective orders, and the expreſs directions of their founders and benefactors, to relieve the wants and diſtreſſes not only of the neceſſitous and infirm in their neighbourhood, but of travelling people alſo. From neglect or the nauſeouſneſs and infection of diſeaſes, the wretchedneſs of the poor would perhaps not be ſufficiently relieved, which induced the benevolent to found hoſpitals for the more immediate and greater relief of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered objects. Within 100 years after the Conqueſt, 59 hoſpitals were erected in this kingdom; and before the end of the reign of Henry III. they were increaſed to 131.</p>
                     <p>The leproſy was a diſorder very prevalent in Europe during the tenth and eleventh centuries; and its ſpreading was doubtleſs the cauſe of eſtabliſhing many hoſpitals. Some perſons have conjectured that in Chriſtendom they amounted to 15000 in number; but without aſſenting to ſo vague a calculation, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that in England there was hardly a large city, or a capital town, near which there was not one at leaſt of theſe lazar-houſes erected: We indeed find none within the walls, for as the diſtemper was ſo violent as to be judged infectious, the afflicted perſons were denied all public commerce.</p>
                     <p>Hoſpitals were originally deſigned for the relief and entertainment of travellers upon the road, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of pilgrims, and therefore were generally built by the way-ſide.—<hi>Burn's Eccl. Law, vol. ii. p.</hi> 455.</p>
                     <p>From the ſituation of Sherburn Hoſpital we may conjecture, that it was partly intended for this benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent purpoſe, as well as for the reception of lepers.</p>
                     <p>The leproſy was much more common in this part of the globe formerly than at preſent, and perhaps near half the hoſpitals that were in England were for lepers. At the five gates of Norwich were five houſes of this ſort; and lepers were ſo numerous in the twelfth century, that by a decree in the Lateran Council un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pope Alexander III. 1179, they were empowered to erect churches for themſelves, and to have their own miniſters (lepers, we may ſuppoſe) to officiate in them.

He was a gentleman of ſo fine accompliſhments that king James I. made choice of him as preceptor. He died on the 9th of April, 1623, being then newly cut for the ſtone, and was buried in the chapel of Eton college.</p>
                                 <p>William Shawe, A. M. was collated to this hoſpital the 11th of July, 1623, by biſhop Neile, on the death of Thomas Murray. He had ſeven acres of land allotted to him in right of the hoſpital, upon a diviſion of the townfields of Sherburn. Died before September 1636.</p>
                                 <p>John Machon, A. M. born in Staffordſhire; was collated to the vicarage of Hartburn in Northumberland, the 24th of September, 1632, and reſigned it for this hoſpital, into which he was inducted the 24th of September, 1636. During the civil wars between the king's army quartered at Durham, and the parliament army ſtationed at Quarring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:0782100202:630"/>the hoſpital was plundered of its cattle and goods, alſo of many of its old charters and muniments, and Mr Machon was much abuſed and diſpoſſeſſed, and one John Fenwick, a tradeſman in Newcaſtle and guide to the Scottiſh army, was put in maſter, who ſoon after got an order from Oliver Cromwell to put in his ſon John Fenwick, a layman, to be maſter there, whereby Machon was kept out of the hoſpital eighteen years. After the reſtoration of king Charles he petitioned the king to be reſtored, and enjoyed it till his death in December 1679: Was buried in the hoſpital chapel without any memorial.</p>
                                 <p>☞ The former maſters of this hoſpital were obliged to leave their ſucceſſors ſtock to the value of 400l. but biſhop Crewe in conſideration of Mr Machon's great loſſes, and ſeventeen years baniſhment, by an order dated the 13th of September, 1676, decreed, that Machon ſhould only leave to his ſucceſſor 200l. in cattle, hay, corn, &amp;c. which rule every ſucceeding maſter has been allowed to follow <note n="(f)" place="bottom">

                                    </note>, ſon of Dr James Stillingfleet, dean of Worceſter; educated at Wadham college, Oxford; was collated to the maſterſhip of this hoſpital in June 1738, when he reſigned Ryton. Died at Briſtol Auguſt 3d, 1759.</p>
                                 <p>David Gregory, D. D. the firſt profeſſor of modern hiſtory at Oxford, appointed by king George I. the 18th of Auguſt, 1724; was collated by biſhop Trevor to this hoſpital the 15th of September, 1759. His benevolence was diffuſive and general; while maſter of this hoſpital he did not confine the old men as heretofore to the ſtrict allowance, which good as it might have been when anciently ſettled on them by their founder, was now become a ſad and ſcanty pittance, but as far as it was in his power, made them enjoy the ſenſe and ſpirit of the benefaction. He demoliſhed all the little wretched huts in which they were huddled together, and erected a handſome commodious ſtone edifice, making it to conſiſt of twenty different apartments, that each might have one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to himſelf; and alſo conſtructed a large room in the centre of the building for their common reception, and comfortably provided it with every neceſſary accommodation: For this purpoſe he cut down and ſold a large wood at Ebcheſter belonging the hoſpital, as it is ſaid, adequate to the expence. He died the 16th of September, 1767.</p>
                                 <p>Mark Hildeſley, D. D. was of Trinity college, Cambridge, and biſhop of Sodor and Man. He was collated to this hoſpital by biſhop Trevor, the 21ſt of September, 1767, and died at Biſhop's Court in the Iſle of Man, the 7th of December, 1772, aged 74 years.</p>
                                 <p>Thomas Dampier, a native of Somerſetſhire, educated at Eton ſchool; was a prebendary of Durham, which he reſigned on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing collated to this hoſpital by Dr Egerton, late lord biſhop of Durham, wherein he was inducted by proxy the 10th of March, 1773. Inſtalled dean of Durham in June 1774, having before reſigned the hoſpital to his ſon the preſent dean of Rocheſter. He died the 2d of Auguſt, 1777.</p>

The hoſpital ſtands at the foot and weſt ſide of a large ſquare area or green, containing near an acre, and conſiſts of a neat but low building, having a hall in the center, and two wings formed into lodgings: On the eaſt ſide of the area, which is a hanging plain gradually deſcending to the weſt, is the maſter's houſe, and a dwelling for the chief farmer: On the north ſide is a porter's lodge and gateway, in the center of the boundary wall; and on the ſouth ſide, at the eaſt corner, ſtands the chapel, which adjoins to the garden. You enter the chapel through the tower; the nave is now totally diſuſed, the chancel only receiving the congregation; the nave is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by three narrow windows to the ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

arches: In the center ſouth window are the arms of the Montagues in painted glaſs. The eaſt window is new, conſiſting of five lights and ſome elegant tracery, with painted glaſs: In the roſes of the upper tracery are the arms of Neville. In the center light is the figure repreſented on the hoſpital ſeal, above which are the arms of lord Crew, and thoſe of the See. The chancel is neatly ſtalled on each ſide for the brethren. Within the altar rails towards the ſouth wall is the tomb of Thomas Lever, who died in 1577. The ſituation of this hoſpital is remarkably healthful, it is ſurrounded with dry and fertile lands, and ſtands about two miles diſtant from Durham.</p>

               <p>By theſe conſtitutions it appears that the chapel firſt erected was dedicated to God, Mary Magdalen, and St Nicholas, and was ſerved by three prieſts and four clerks, part to officiate at the altar of Mary Magdalen; and as the hoſpital was to receive both ſexes, other part to officiate at the altar of St Nicholas, where the women were to hear maſs, the chapel being ſituated at the ſouth door of their houſe; ſo that it ſeems the men and women had houſes at ſeparate ſides of the area. Biſhop Kellaw, for greater decorum, built a new chapel on the north ſide of the great chapel, which he dedicated to the Bleſſed Virgin, and where he ordered maſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

be celebrated daily to the brethren, and to this ſervice he appointed a fourth prieſt. On dominical days and great ſolemnities, he ordered ſervice to be performed by all the prieſts to both men and women; the men being preceded by their prior, and the women by their prioreſs. The procurator or maſter was not confined to be in clerical orders; but was reſtrained to that moderation that he ſhould not keep more than three horſes without ſome urgent neceſſity. The prieſts and clerks were to lie in the chamber next the chapel, unleſs the maſter required one to lodge in his chamber: And the maſter and all others were to dine and ſup in the hall. Biſhop Kellaw appointed the times of ſervice, and the burning of lights before the altar. The number of lepers to be entertained being ſixty-five, the meſs was directed, each to have a loaf and a gallon of beer daily; three days in the week fleſh meat, and four days fiſh, ſo that one diſh of meat, fiſh, cheeſe or butter, ſhould ſerve two: But on great days two diſhes were to be provided, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly on quadrageſima day they were to have freſh ſalmon or other fiſh, if they could be had, for one diſh; and on Michaelmas-day they ſhould have geeſe, a gooſe to every four; but if that feſtival happened on a weekly faſt day, the gooſe feaſt was to be poſtponed to Sunday. They were allowed yearly three yards of woollen cloth, ruſſett or white, ſix yards of linen, and ſix yards of canvas, with other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, as truſſes of ſtraw and bundles of reeds, with four yole clogs for the vigils of our Saviour. The brethren were to chuſe their prior, and the ſiſters their prioreſs. They were allowed fires from Michaelmas-day to the day of All-Saints; the meaſure of the peats<note n="*" place="bottom">Fuel cut from the moſſes of moor lands.</note> being fixed. Certain rules were ordained for the ſick, for funerals, and prayers. From Pentecoſt to Michaelmas red herrings and ſalted viands were prohibited. Two waſhers were appointed, and an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the nurſes who attended the ſick; and each member was allowed in money at two days in the year five-pence, and once in the year five ſhillings.</p>
               <p>It is preſumed the hoſpital continued to be regulated and governed by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going rules till the time of biſhop Langley, when great abuſes were complained of, the pious inſtitution being converted into private emolument, and the buildings ſuffered to go to ruin, that prelate iſſued his commiſſion<note n="†" place="bottom">Commiſſion to enquire into dilapidations of Sherburn hoſpital, by Thomas Langley biſhop of Durham, 4th of September, 1429.</note>, dated the 4th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, 1429, directed to William Chaunceller, his temporal chancellor, and others, to viſit and examine the dilapidations in the hoſpital erections, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the abuſes of the charity. Upon the commiſſioners reporting the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition and poverty thereof, the biſhop thought proper to apply to pope Eugene IV. inſtead of the king, for redreſs, who readily granted a faculty or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the biſhop, to make new rules and ordinances for the better government thereof, which he accordingly made on the 22d day of July, 1434, and thereby appointed, that the future maſter ſhould be in clerical orders, and that he ſhould keep four chaplains, four clerks, or ſinging men, and two boys, chaunters; and ordained certain rules for the celebration of divine ſervice, and for the conduct of the prieſts, clerks and boys<note n="‡" place="bottom">Nova ordinatio ſive reformatio hoſpitalis de Shirburn, per Thomam Langley epiſcopum, ex commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione Eugenii papae quarti, 22 Julii, 1434.</note>.

high altar, inſcribed with the names of biſhop Pudſey, biſhop de Mariſco, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as alſo with the name of Martin de Sancta Cruce, that maſs might be ſaid for them. It thereby appears, that the leproſy (for the relief of thoſe under which affliction this hoſpital was founded) was at that time almoſt eradicated, for he directs, that in remembrance of the original foundation, two lepers ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the hoſpital, if they could be found, but to be kept apart from the reſt of the people admitted to the houſe: To thoſe, thirteen poor people were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to be provided with meat and drink of ten-pence value every week, or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of ready money at their own option, and have yearly the ſum of 6s. 8d. for fuel and cloaths, and to meſs and lodge in the ſame houſe, and daily to attend maſs. Upon the death of a brother, another poor man to be choſen by the maſter within fifteen days, under the penalty of paying a mark to the fabric of the church at Durham. An old woman of good character was to be provided at the maſter's expence, to attend the brethren, waſh their linen, and do other offices. The maſter to have the care of all the goods and buildings of the hoſpital, and to take an oath for the due performance of all things ſtipulated by thoſe ordinances.</p>
               <p>We hear of no further abuſes of the charity till the time of biſhop Tunſtall, when Anthony Salvin, then maſter, in 1557, preſented a petition to that prelate, praying that a commiſſion of enquiry might iſſue, with interrogatories <hi>ad perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi> which commiſſion was accordingly iſſued, and depoſitions were taken thereon the 27th of April, 1557, and duly returned.</p>

                           <p>The maiſter henceforth ſhall not admit nor receive any married man having his wife alive, uſually to lodge and continue within the precinct of the ſaid hoſpital, and ſhall not permit their wives or children, or other friends and acquaintance to reſort into the ſaid hoſpital; and that the ſaid maiſter ſhall not permit any of the ſaid brethren to gadd or range abroad, without eſpecial cauſe allowed and licence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, either by the maiſter or his curate.</p>

                     <hi>ORDINANCES AND RULES,</hi> For the good order and government of <hi>Sherborn Hoſpital,</hi> in the County of Durham.</head>
                  <p>Ordinances and rules for the good order and government of the maſter and brethren of Chriſt's hoſpital at Sherborne, near Durham, and their poſſeſſions, delivered to them the twenty-ſixth day of Auguſt, by Edward, by divine providence lord biſhop of Durham, at his primary viſitation of the ſaid hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, which was begun Auguſt the 14th, 1735, and continued by ſeveral ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journments to that day.</p>
                  <p>EDWARD, by divine providence lord biſhop of Dureſme. To our well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved in Chriſt, Wadham Chandler, clerk, maſter of arts, maſter of the ſaid hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, Richard Grey, John Whitfield, and the reſt of the brethren.</p>
                  <p>If the changes incident to all perſons and things did not inſenſibly introduce deviations from the original conſtitutions of ſocieties alſo, and make frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views of the laws whereby they ſhould be governed neceſſary, for preſerving a conſiſtency between men's practices and their rules, yet the preſent condition of Chriſt's Hoſpital at Sherburn in particular, would demand a ſpeedy proviſion to be made againſt ſome evils the houſe labours under, and which by longer neglect may grow to be very detrimental to it.</p>
                  <p>For having in our viſitation upon the place diſcovered that all the local ſtatutes made by our predeceſſors, ſince the foundation of the ſaid hoſpital by queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, with conſent of her parliament, were either loſt, concealed, or of no validity, for want of a ratification under the epiſcopal ſeal, as is required by her act; that their ſtocks of cattle and corn were deſtroyed and conſumed in the time of the civil wars, by the two armies in the neighbourhood of Sherburn houſe; that no inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory hath been ſince taken of their goods, nor bond given by the entering maſter, for any ſum of money to be paid to every ſucceeding maſter, as a fund in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the occaſions of the ſaid hoſpital, and as was wont formerly to be given, we judged no time was to be loſt in ſettling new rules, without which no ſociety can well ſubſiſt, which may alſo be effectual for ſecuring what goods and chattles
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:0782100202:645"/>
are ſtill remaining, and prevent further ruin to their common eſtate, which in a long chancery ſuit at this diſtance of time, after a ſucceſſion of two or three maſters, under a defect of full proofs, muſt be hazarded with ſmall proſpect of ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>In drawing up theſe rules, we have revived as many ordinances of the firſt founders as could be adapted to the preſent ſtate of things, and followed thoſe of our late predeceſſors where we could preſume of their intentions by their articles of viſitation which we have ſeen, and theſe rules ſo collected and hereafter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we, by the authority given us by act of parliament, as well as the antienter conſtitutions of the firſt founders, biſhops of this dioceſe, do for ourſelves and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, order and appoint to be the ſtanding rules to be obſerved by all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſaid hoſpital, until ſuch time as any of our ſucceſſors ſhall ſee cauſe, or in their wiſdom think proper to alter or amend them.</p>
                  <p>And to prevent confuſion by a diſagreement of theſe with any former rules, (ſhould any ſuch come to light hereafter) we, after the example of our worthy predeceſſor Thomas Langley in his new ordination of the ſaid hoſpital, reſcind and annul all former conſtitutions, rules, and ordinances, made by any of our prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and do ſubſtitute theſe in their place, as the only rules they ſhall be bound to obey. Given at our caſtle at Durham, the twenty-ſixth day of Auguſt, being one of the days and places to which we adjourned our viſitation of the ſaid hoſpital, in the eighteenth year of our conſecration, fifth of our tranſlation, and in the year of our Lord one thouſand ſeven hundred and thirty-five.</p>

                     <head>Concerning the MASTER.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. The maſter ſhall be always a perſon in holy orders, of the degree of maſter of arts at leaſt, a licenſed preacher, and one who is capable of buſineſs and applies himſelf to it, eſpecially for the maintenance and proſperous eſtate of the hoſpital.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The maſter or his deputy appointed by him to act in his name, ſhall uſually reſide within the ſaid hoſpital, for the better ordering and governing the members thereof, according to an ancient conſtitution of Tho. Langley biſhop of Dureſme; ſaving to the ſaid biſhop his ordinary juriſdiction over them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The maſter if he be not conſtantly reſident in perſon, ſhall often repair thither to preach and read lectures on catechetical heads to them, and to enquire and hear the complaints of the brethren when they have any, and ſee them redreſſed.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The common ſeal ſhall be kept by the maſter only, in a box locked up, and not to be truſted with the deputy, and the maſter ſhall be always preſent when the ſeal is put to any inſtrument.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The counterparts of the leaſes ſhall be preſerved in the cuſtody of the maſter himſelf, and as often as there ſhall be occaſion to truſt any writing out of his hands, he ſhall take a note for the ſafe delivery of it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. No demiſe of lands anciently uſed to be demiſed, ſhall paſs otherwiſe than by the common ſeal; and no demiſe of lands not demiſeable by queen Elizabeth's foundation, ſhall be accounted valid in law, though it be duly ſealed with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſeal.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="613" facs="tcp:0782100202:646"/>7. Upon ſealing of any leaſe, twelve-pence and no more ſhall be given to every member that attends to ſign the leaſe.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The demeſnes at Sherburn ſhall never be demiſed by leaſe for years or lives, but the whole or at leaſt the greateſt part thereof ſhall continue in the occupation of the maſter or his deputy, ſteward or agent, ſo that there ſhall always be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained on the ground a full ſtock of young cattle of all kinds, and a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of hay and ſtores of corn and other grain in the granaries, to anſwer all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of the houſe.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Upon the death, ceſſion, or reſignation of every maſter, ſo much of his ſtock and ſtores of all ſorts, as ſhall be prized to the value of two hundred pounds, ſhall be delivered over to the ſucceeding maſter, who ſhall be legally intitled thereto from the preceding maſter, his heirs, or executors, or the ſum of two hundred pounds for and in lieu and in full ſatisfaction for the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. For the better ſecuring of this two hundred pounds, or ſtock or ſtores to the value thereof, every maſter ſoon after his induction, ſhall be bound to the biſhop of Dureſme in the penalty of four hundred pounds, for the payment of two hundred pounds, or ſtock and ſtores of that value to his lawful ſucceſſor, which bond ſhall be lodged in the regiſtry of the biſhop's conſiſtory court, to be delivered up and cancelled upon performance of the condition by the preceding maſter.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. An exact inventory ſhall be taken by every maſter at his coming into his place of all the plate, houſhold goods, kitchen and brewing veſſels, utenſils in the dairy, cellar, and for huſbandry, linen, bedding, and all other furniture, as well belonging to the houſe of the maſter, as the houſes of the brethren, and three copies made thereof and ſigned by the ſaid maſter, the one to be lodged in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtry aforeſaid, with the bond for two hundred pounds, the other to be preſerved by the maſter himſelf, and the third to be kept by the heirs or executors of the preceding maſter, who is obliged to leave the ſame as he received them at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, according to the ſaid inventory.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The original of theſe ſtatutes to be ſafely locked up in the ſame box with the common ſeal, to be delivered with the ſaid ſeal to the next lawful ſucceſſor by the predeceſſor or his executors or adminiſtrators, and a book ſhall be prepared for common uſe, wherein theſe ſtatutes and ordinances, as far as they concern the brethren, ſhall be fairly written, with queen Elizabeth's act of foundation in the 27th year of her reign, and ſuch other rules as ſhall hereafter be made by any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding biſhop.—Theſe rules concerning the brethren are to be read to the inn-brethren at a full meeting once a year.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. A quarto book ſhall be carefully kept by the maſter or his deputy, wherein ſhall be fairly entered the names of all the preſent members, and the time of their coming in, and when and before whom they were ſworn; and as often as any of them die, the brother who ſucceeds him ſhall have his name entered, his country, pariſh, his age, and the day of the year of his being ſworn, and by whom, and whom he ſucceeds, and till this be done, no perſon ſhall be reckoned a brother or member of Sherburn-houſe.</p>

In filling up the vacant places of the inn-brethren, a preference ſhall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten given to the out-brethren, who in the maſter's opinion deſerve to be taken into the houſe, yet ſo as that it ſhall be a matter of choice and diſcretion in the maſter, and not of obliga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="16">16. Theſe qualifications ſhall be required in every man that is admitted into Sherburn houſe as a brother; that he be a ſingle perſon who hath lived well and creditably in the world, and is not at this time worth twenty pounds; that he be born in the county of Durham, unleſs by ſpecial allowance of the biſhop, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be diſpenſed with; and particularly that ſuch as have lived within the manors, and been tenants to the lands of the biſhopric or hoſpital eſtate, if in other reſpects they be as well qualified, ſhall have the preference; that he be of the age of fifty-ſix or upwards, never under; that he be not then labouring under any ſickneſs, or incurable or infectious diſeaſe, though the lame and impotent ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the firſt place.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. He ſhall be a conſtant member of the church of England by law eſtabliſhed, and continue ſo.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. To this end we order, that every man that deſires to be a brother, ſhall preſent a petition to the maſter, ſetting forth his caſe, with a certificate of his age, under the hand of the miniſter of the pariſh where he was born, and another cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate of his peaceable ſocial diſpoſition, and ſober behaviour, and conformity to the church of England for ſome years laſt paſt, under the hands of credible gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and others, neighbours to the place where he hath laſt lived; which peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and certificates ſhall be filed by the maſter, to be produced when he ſhall be called upon.</p>
                     <p n="19">19.

No brother ſhall preſume to be abſent from prayers, to go abroad, much leſs to lie out of the houſe, without leave of the maſter or his deputy, which ſhall be ſparingly allowed, and the time of abſence not above two or three days, and the leave to be noted in a book kept for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. The brethren ſhall attend duly morning and evening prayer, ſermons on the Lord's day, and the holy ſacrament of the Lord's ſupper, as often as it ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered, and they ſhall be there early at the beginning of the reſpective offices, and continue there to the end: And the better to know who performs this duty, the clerk of the chappel ſhall keep a weekly roll, with the names of the brethren, and prick at the name of every one preſent, and on Monday morning deliver this roll to the maſter or his deputy, in order to their receiving admonition or correction according to the heinouſneſs of their offence.</p>

For the employment of their thoughts on the week days, a Bible and Whole Duty of Man ſhall be provided for every inn-brother, which upon the death of any of them, ſhall go with all the furniture of his chamber (bought by the maſter) to his ſucceſſor; and they ſhall be often put in mind of daily prayers in ſecret in their own rooms.</p>

No brother ſhall be allowed to be a drunkard, a fornicator or unchaſte, a caballer or miſchief-maker, profane, a deſpiſer of God, religion or divine worſhip, injurious or unſociable to his fellows, diſreſpectful, ſaucy, or diſobdient to the maſter, or in a word, be guilty of any notorious crime, or live a diſorderly offenſive life.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. In all theſe caſes the maſter to whom the power and authority of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the brethren and ſervants of the houſe is committed, ſhall by himſelf or his deputy, or the chaplain, correct and puniſh the offender, according to the quality and degree of the offence, (that is to ſay) at firſt, by a ſerious admonition and warning, and then by ſuſpending him from his diet for two, three, or more days, according to the maſter's pleaſure: Provided that the ſuſpenſion be never longer than three weeks at a time, and the value of the diet of the ſuſpended perſon be divided among ſuch of the brethren as are not offenders; and if after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of ſuch diſcipline, any brother ſhall go on to offend in the ſame way, the maſter ſhall then carry his complaint of him to the biſhop, that he may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, or otherwiſe puniſhed as the biſhop ſhall think fit.</p>
                     <p n="28">28.

to ſay grace before and after meat, or give God thanks for the bountiful proviſion he hath made for them, and for raiſing up ſuch benefactors to them.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. The woman that is to waſh their cloaths, &amp;c. ſhall be of middle age, of good fame and converſation, as the ſame alſo is required of all the other ſervants and miniſters belonging to the houſe.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. We do revive and enforce the late orders concerning the manner of diet of the brethren throughout the year, with ſome few alterations, as annexed in a ſeparate paper, which we order to be tranſcribed and hung up in the hall where the brethren eat.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. Laſtly, as to the relief of poor travellers at the gate, which hath been cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, and no doubt piouſly intended, we give no injunctions; idle vagrants ſhould be diſcouraged and puniſhed, neceſſitous travellers on their honeſt occaſions ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, but care ſhould be taken that ſuch as have no legal ſettlement be not made burthenſome to the hoſpital, by an indiſcreet relief, as is directed by an act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for aſcertaining of ſettlements.</p>
