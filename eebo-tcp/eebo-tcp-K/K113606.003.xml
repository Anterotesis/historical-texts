            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

         <div n="1" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. I. Of Ruminating Animals.</head>
            <p>OF all animals, thoſe that chew the cud are the moſt harmleſs,
and the moſt eaſily tamed. As they live entirely upon vegetables, it is
neither their intereſt nor their pleaſure to make war upon the reſt of
the brute creation; content with the paſtures where they are placed, they
ſeldom deſire to change, while they are furniſhed with a proper ſupply;
and fearing nothing from each other, they generally go in herds for their
mutual ſecurity. All the fierceſt of the carnivorous kinds ſeek their
food <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0823800103:5"/> in gloomy ſolitude; theſe, on the contrary, range
together; the very meaneſt of them are found to unite in each other's
defence; and the hare itſelf is a gregarious animal, in thoſe countries
where it has no other enemies but the beaſts of the foreſt to guard
againſt.</p>
            <p>As the food of ruminant animals is entirely of the vegetable kind,
and as this is very eaſily procured, ſo theſe animals ſeem naturally
more indolent and leſs artful than thoſe of the carnivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous kinds; and as
their appetites are more ſimple, their inſtincts ſeem to be leſs
capable of variation. The fox or the wolf are for ever prowling; their long
habits of want give them a degree of ſharpneſs and cunning; their life is a
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſcene of ſtratagem and eſcape: but the patient ox, or the
deer, enjoy the repaſt that Nature has abundantly provided; certain of
ſubſiſtence, and content with ſecurity.</p>
            <p>As Nature has furniſhed theſe animals with an appetite for
ſuch coarſe and ſimple nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo ſhe has enlarged the capacity
of the inteſtines, to take in a greater ſupply. In the carnivorous kinds,
as their food is nouriſhing and juicy, their ſtomachs are but ſmall, and
their inteſtines ſhort; but in theſe, whoſe paſture is coarſe, and
where much muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated before any quantity of nouriſhment 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0823800103:6"/> can be obtained, their ſtomachs are large and numerous,
and their inteſtines long and muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. The bowels of a ruminating animal
may be conſidered as an elaboratory, with veſſels in it, fitted for
various tranſmutations. It requires a long and tedious proceſs before
graſs can be tranſmuted into fleſh; and for this purpoſe, Nature, in
general, has furniſhed ſuch animals as feed upon graſs, with four
ſtomachs, through which the food ſucceſſively paſſes, and undergoes
the proper ſeparations.</p>
            <p>Of the four ſtomachs with which ruminant animals are furniſhed,
the firſt is called the paunch, which receives the food after it has been
ſlightly chewed; the ſecond is called the honeycomb, and is properly
nothing more than a continuation of the former; theſe two, which are very
capacious, the animal fills as faſt as it can, and then lies down to
ruminate, which may be properly conſidered as a kind of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting without
effort or pain. The two ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs abovementioned being filled with as much as
they can contain, and the graſs, which was ſlightly chewed, beginning to
ſwell with the heat of the ſituation, it dilates the ſtomachs, and
theſe again contract upon their contents. The aliment, thus ſqueezed, has
but two paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to eſcape at; one into the third ſtomach, 
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0823800103:7"/> which is very narrow; and the other back, by the gullet,
into the mouth, which is wider. The greateſt quantity, therefore, is driven
back through the largeſt aperture into the mouth, to be chewed a ſecond
time; while a ſmall part, and that only the moſt liquid, is driven into the
third ſtomach, through the orifice which is ſo ſmall. The food which is
driven to the mouth, and chewed a ſecond time, is thus ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more ſoft
and moiſt, and becomes at laſt liquid enough to paſs into the conduit
that goes to the third ſtomach, where it undergoes a ſtill farther
comminution. In this ſtomach, which is called the manyfold, from the number
of its leaves, all which tend to promote digeſtion, the graſs has the
appearance of boiled ſpinage, but not yet ſufficiently reduced, ſo as to
make a part of the animal's nouriſhment: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the operation of the
fourth ſtomach for this purpoſe, where it undergoes a complete maceration,
and is ſeparated to be turned into chyle.</p>
            <p>But Nature has not been leſs careful in another reſpect, in
fitting the inteſtines of theſe animals for their food. In the carnivorous
kinds they are thin and lean; but in ruminating animals they are ſtrong,
fleſhy, and well covered with fat. Every precaution ſeems taken that 
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0823800103:8"/> can help their digeſtion: their ſtomach is ſtrong and
muſcular, the more readily to act upon its contents; their inteſtines are
lined with fat, the better to preſerve their warmth; and they are extended to
a much greater length, ſo as to extract every part of that nouriſhment
which their vegetable food ſo ſcantily ſupplies.</p>
            <p>In this manner are all quadrupedes of the cow, the ſheep, or the
deer kind, ſeen to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate; being thus furniſhed with four ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs,
for the macerating of their food. Theſe, therefore, may moſt properly be
called the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant kinds; although there are many others that have this
quality in a leſs obſervable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. The rhinoceros, the camel, the
horſe, the rabbit, the marmotte, and the ſquirrel, all chew the cud by
intervals, although they are not furniſhed with ſtomachs like the former.
But not theſe alone, there are numberleſs other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals that appear to
ruminate; not only birds, but fiſhes, and inſects. Among birds are the
pelican, the ſtork, the heron, the pidgeon, and the turtle; theſe have a
power of diſgorging their food to feed their young. Among fiſhes are
lobſters, crabs, and that fiſh called the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rado. The ſalmon alſo is
ſaid to be of this number: and, if we may believe Ovid, the <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0823800103:9"/> ſcarus likewiſe; of which he ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <l>Ut ſcarus epaſtas ſolus qui ruminat
eſcas.</l>

                  <l>He only ruminates his former food.</l>
               </q> Of inſects, the
ruminating tribe is ſtill larger: the mole, the cricket, the waſp, the
drone, the bee, the graſhopper, and the beetle. All theſe animals either
actually chew the cud, or ſeem at leaſt to ruminate. They have the
ſtomach compoſed of muſcular fibres, by means whereof the food is ground
up and down, in the ſame manner as in thoſe which are particularly
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by the appellation of ruminants.</p>
            <p>But not theſe alone; men themſelves have been often known to
ruminate, and ſome even with pleaſure. The accounts of theſe calamities,
for ſuch I muſt conſider them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to our fellow-creatures, are not
very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to read; yet I muſt tranſcribe a ſhort one, as given us
by Slare, in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, as it may in ſome meaſure
ſhew the ſatisfaction which the lower tribes of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals enjoy while they
ruminate. The man in queſtion was a citizen of Briſtol, of about twenty
years of age, and, what ſeemed more extraordinary ſtill, of a ruminating
family, for <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0823800103:10"/> his father was frequently ſubject to the
ſame infirmity, or amuſement, as he himſelf perhaps would call it. This
young man uſually began to chew his meat over again within about a quarter of
an hour after eating. His ruminating after a full meal generally laſted about
an hour and an half; nor could he ſleep until this taſk was performed. The
victuals, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, taſted even more pleaſantly than at firſt;
and returned as if they had been beaten up in a mortar. If he ate a variety of
things, that which he ate firſt came up again firſt; and if this return was
interrupted for any time, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſickneſs and diſorder, and he was
never well till it returned. Inſtances of this kind, however, are rare and
accidental; and it is happy for mankind that they are ſo. Of all other
animals, we ſpend the leaſt time in eating; this is one of the great
diſtinctions between us and the brute creation; and eating is a pleaſure of
ſo low a kind, that none but ſuch as are nearly allied to the quadrupede,
deſire its prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. Of Quadrupedes of the Cow Kind.</head>
            <p>OF all ruminant animals, thoſe of the cow kind deſerve the
firſt rank, both for their ſize, their beauty, and their ſervices. The
horſe is more properly an animal belonging to the rich; the ſheep chiefly
thrives in a flock, and requires attendance; but the cow is more eſpecially
the poor man's pride, his riches, and his ſupport. There are many of our
peaſantry that have no other poſſeſſion but a cow; and even of the
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages reſulting from this moſt uſeful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the poor are but
the nominal poſſeſſors. Its fleſh they cannot pretend to taſte,
ſince then their whole riches are at once deſtroyed; its calf they are
obliged to fatten for ſale, ſince veal is a delicacy they could not make
any pretenſions to; its very milk is wrought into butter and cheeſe for the
tables of their maſters; while they have no ſhare even in their own
poſſeſſion, but the choice of their market. I cannot bear to hear the
rich crying out for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, while they thus ſtarve their fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and feed them up with an imaginary good, while they monopolize the real
benefits of nature.</p>

better ſubordination, this excellent animal is of more general advantage. In
Germany, Poland, and Switzerland, every peaſant keeps two or three cows, not
for the benefit of his maſter, but for himſelf. The meaneſt of the
peaſants there kills one cow at leaſt for his own table, which he ſalts
and hangs up, and thus preſerves as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy all the year round. There is
ſcarce a cottage in thoſe countries that is not hung round with theſe
marks of hoſpitality; and which often make the owner better contented with
hunger, ſince he has it in his power to be luxurious when he thinks proper. A
piece of beef hung up there, is conſidered as an elegant piece of furniture,
which, though ſeldom touched, at leaſt argues the poſſeſſor's
opulence and eaſe. But it is very different, for ſome years paſt, in this
country, where our lower ruſtics at leaſt are utterly unable to purchaſe
meat any part of the year, and by them even butter is conſidered as an
article of extravagance.</p>
            <p>The climate and paſture of Great Britain, however, is excellently
adapted to this animal's moderate nature; and the verdure and the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of
our plains are perfectly ſuited to the manner of its feeding; for wanting the
upper fore teeth, it loves to graze in an high rich <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0823800103:13"/>
paſture. This animal ſeems but little regardful of the quality of its food,
provided it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in ſufficient abundance; it makes no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
diſtinctions in the choice of its herbage, but indiſcriminately and
haſtily devours the proper quantity. For this reaſon, in our paſtures,
where the graſs is rather high than ſucculent, more flouriſhing than
nutritious, the cow thrives admirably; and there is no part of Europe where the
tame animal grows ſo large, yields more milk, or more readily fattens, than
with us.</p>
            <p>Our paſtures ſupply them with abundance, and they in return
enrich the paſture; for, of all animals, the cow ſeems to give back more
than it takes from the ſoil. The horſe and the ſheep are known, in a
courſe of years, to impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh the ground. The land where they have fed
becomes weedy, and the vegetables coarſe and unpalatable: on the contrary,
the paſture where the cow has been bred, acquires a finer ſofter ſurface,
and becomes every year more beautiful and even. The reaſon is, that the
horſe being furniſhed with fore teeth in the upper jaw, nips the graſs
cloſely, and, therefore, only chuſes that which is the moſt delicate and
ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; the ſheep alſo, though, with reſpect to its teeth, formed like
the cow, only bites the moſt <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0823800103:14"/> ſucculent parts of the
herbage: theſe animals, therefore, leave all the high weeds ſtanding; and
while they cut the finer graſs too cloſely, ſuffer the ranker herbage to
vegetate and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run the paſture. But it is otherwiſe with the cow; as its
teeth cannot come ſo cloſe to the ground as thoſe of the horſe, nor
ſo readily as thoſe of the ſheep, which are leſs, it is obliged to feed
upon the talleſt vegetables that offer; thus it eats them all down, and, in
time, levels the ſurface of the paſture.</p>
            <p>The age of the cow is known by the teeth and horns. This animal is
furniſhed with eight cutting teeth in the lower jaw; at the age of ten
months, the two middlemoſt of theſe fall out, and are replaced by others,
that are not ſo white, but broader; at the age of ſixteen months, the two
next milk-white teeth fall out likewiſe, and others come up in their room:
thus, at the end of every ſix months, the creature loſes and gains, till,
at the age of three years, all the cutting teeth are renewed, and then they are
long, pretty white and equal; but in proportion as the animal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in
years, they become irregular and black, their inequalities become ſmoother,
and the animal leſs capable of chewing its food. Thus the cow often declines
from this ſingle cauſe; for as it is obliged to eat <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0823800103:15"/> a
great deal to ſupport life, and as the ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the teeth makes the
difficulty of chewing great, a ſufficient quantity of food cannot be
ſupplied to the ſtomach. Thus the poor animal ſinks in the midſt of
plenty, and every year grows leaner and leaner, till it dies.</p>
            <p>The horns are another, and a ſurer method of determining this
animal's age. At three years old, it ſheds its horns, and new ones ariſe in
their place, which continue as long as it lives; at four years of age, the cow
has ſmall pointed neat ſmooth horns, thickeſt near the head; at five the
horns become larger, and are marked round with the former year's growth. Thus,
while the animal continues to live, the horns continue to lengthen; and every
year a new ring is added at the root; ſo that allowing three years before
their appearance, and then reckoning the number of rings, we have in both
together the animal's age exactly.</p>
            <p>As we have indiſputably the beſt breed of horned cattle of any
in Europe, ſo it was not without the ſame aſſiduity that we came to
excel in theſe, as in our horſes. The breed of cows has been entirely
improved by a foreign mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, properly adapted to ſupply the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of our own. Such as are purely Britiſh, <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0823800103:16"/> are far inferior
in ſize to thoſe on many parts of the continent; but thoſe which we have
thus improved, by far excel all others. Our Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire kind derive their
ſize from the Holſtein breed: and the large hornleſs cattle that are bred
in ſome parts of England, came originally from Poland. We were once famous
for a wild breed of theſe animals, but theſe have long ſince been worn
out; and perhaps no kingdom in Europe can furniſh ſo few wild animals of
all kinds, as our own. Cultivation and agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture are ſure to baniſh
theſe, wherever they are found; and every addition a country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from
art, drives away thoſe animals that are only, fitted for a ſtate of
nature.</p>
            <p>Of all quadrupedes, the cow ſeems moſt liable to alteration from
its paſture. In the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of our own country, we eaſily
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the great varieties produced among theſe animals, by the richneſs
or poverty of the ſoil. In ſome they grow to a great bulk; and I have
ſeen an ox ſixteen hands high, which is taller than the general run of our
horſes. In others, they appear as diminutive; being not ſo large as an
aſs. The breed of the Iſle of Man, and moſt parts of Scotland, is much
leſs in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral than in England or Ireland: they are differently ſhaped
alſo, the dewlap being much <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0823800103:17"/> ſmaller, and, as the
expreſſion is, the beaſt has more of the ewe neck. This, till ſome
years ago, was conſidered in cattle as a defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; and the cow was
choſen, according to Virgil's direction, with a large dewlap: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at
preſent it is the univerſal opinion, that the cow wants in udder what it
has in neck, and the larger the dewlap, the ſmaller is the quantity of its
milk. Our graziers now, therefore, endeavour to mix the two breeds; the large
Holſtein with the ſmall northern; and from both reſults that fine milch
breed, which excels the cattle of any other part of the world.</p>
            <p>This difference, ariſing from paſture, is more obſervable in
other countries than in our own. The cow kind is to be found in almoſt every
part of the world, large in proportion to the richneſs of the paſture; and
ſmall, as the animal is ſtinted in its food. Thus Africa is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for
the largeſt and the ſmalleſt cattle of this kind; as is alſo India,
Poland, Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and ſeveral other parts of Europe. Among the Eluth
Tartars, where the paſtures are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably rich and nouriſhing, the cow
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo large, that he muſt be a tall man who can reach the tip of its
ſhoulder. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in France, where the animal is ſtinted in 
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0823800103:18"/> its food, and driven from the moſt flouriſhing
paſtures, it greatly degenerates.</p>
            <p>But the differences in the ſize of this animal are not ſo
remarkable as thoſe which are found in its form, its hair, and its horns. The
differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſo very extraordinary in many of them, that they have been
even conſidered as a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kind of creature, and names have been given
them as a diſtinct ſpecies, when in reality they are all the ſame<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. xxiii. p. 78.</bibl>
               </note>. In this
manner the urus and the biſon have been conſidered, from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in
their make, to be diſtinct in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; but they are all in fact the
deſcendants of one common ſtock, as they have that certain mark of unity,
they breed and propagate among each other. Naturaliſts have therefore
laboured under an obvious error, when, becauſe of the extreme bulk of the
urus, or becauſe of the hump upon the back of the biſon, they aſſigned
them different places in the creation, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated a claſs of animals
which was really united. It is true, the horſe and the aſs do not differ
ſo much in form, as the cow and the biſon; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, the former, are
diſtinct animals, as their breed is marked with ſterility; the latter are
animals of the ſame kind, as their breed is fruitful, and a race of animals
is produced, in <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0823800103:19"/> which the hump belonging to the biſon is
ſoon worn away. The differences, therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the cow, the urus, and
the biſon, are merely accidental. The ſame caprice in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that has
given horns to ſome cows, and denied them to others, may alſo have given
the biſon an hump, or encreaſed the bulk of the urus; it may have given the
one a mane, or denied a ſufficiency of hair to the other.</p>
            <p>But before we proceed farther, it may be proper to deſcribe
theſe varieties, which have been thus taken for diſtinct kinds<note n="*" place="bottom">This deſcription is chiefly taken from Klein.</note>. The urus,
or wild bull, is chiefly to be met with in the province of Lithuania; and grows
to a ſize, that ſcarce any other animal, except the elephant, is found to
equal. It is quite black, except a ſtripe mixed with white, that runs from
the neck to the tail, along the top of the back; the horns are ſhort, thick
and ſtrong; the eyes are fierce and fiery; the forehead is adorned with a
kind of garland of black curled hair, and ſome of them are found to have
beards of the ſame; the neck is ſhort and ſtrong, and the ſkin has an
odour of muſk. The female, though not ſo big as the male, exceeds the
largeſt of our bulls in ſize; nevertheleſs, her udder and teats are ſo
ſmall, that they can ſcarcely be <pb facs="tcp:0823800103:20"/>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0823800103:21"/> perceived. Upon the whole, however,
this animal reſembles the tame one very exactly, except in ſome trifling
varieties, which his ſtate of wildneſs, or the richneſs of the paſtures
where he is found, may eaſily have produced.</p>
            <p>The biſon, which is another variety of the cow kind, differs from
the reſt, in having a lump between its ſhoulders. Theſe animals are of
various kinds; ſome very large, others as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutively little. In general,
to regard this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal's fore parts, he has ſomewhat the look of a lion, with
a long ſhaggy mane, and a beard under his chin; his head is little, his eyes
red and fiery, with a furious look; the forehead is large, and the horns ſo
big, and ſo far aſunder, that three men might often ſit between them. On
the middle of the back there grows a bunch almoſt as high as that of a camel,
covered with hair, and which is conſidered as a great delicacy by thoſe
that hunt him. There is no purſuing him with ſafety, except in foreſts
where there are trees large enough to hide the hunters. He is generally taken
by pit-falls; the inhabitants of thoſe countries where he is found wild,
dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holes in the ground, and covering them over with boughs of trees and
graſs; then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the biſon to purſue them, they get on the
oppoſite ſide of the pit fall, while the furious <pb facs="tcp:0823800103:22"/>

running head foremoſt, falls into the pit prepared for him, and is there
quickly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and ſlain.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe real diſtinctions in the cow kind, there have
been many others made, that appear to be in name only. Thus the bonaſus, of
which naturaliſts have given us long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, is ſuppoſed by
Klein and Buffon to be no more than another name for the biſon, as the
deſcriptions given of them by the ancients coincide. The bubalus alſo of
the ancients, which ſome have ſuppoſed to belong to the cow kind, Buffon
places among the lower claſs of ruminant quadrupedes, as it moſt
reſembles them in ſize, ſhape, and the figure of its horns. Of all the
varieties, therefore, of the cow kind, there are but two that are really
diſtinct; namely, the cow, and the buffalo: theſe two are ſeparated by
nature; they ſeem to bear an antipathy to each other; they avoid each other,
and may be conſidered as much removed as the horſe is from the aſs or the
zebra. When, therefore, we have deſcribed the varieties of the cow kind, we
ſhall paſs on to the buffalo, which being a different animal, requires a
ſeparate hiſtory.</p>
            <p>There is ſcarce a part of the world, as was ſaid before, in
which the cow is not found in <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0823800103:25"/> ſome one of its varieties;
either large, like the urus, or humped as the biſon; with ſtrait horns, or
bending, inverted backwards, or turning ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to the cheek, like thoſe
of the ram; and, in many countries, they are found without any horns
whatſoever. But to be more particular, beginning at the north, the few kine
which ſubſiſt in Iceland, are without horns, although of the ſame race
originally with ours. The ſize of theſe is rather relative to the
goodneſs of the paſture, than the warmth or coldneſs of the climate. The
Dutch frequently bring great quantities of lean cattle from Denmark, which they
fatten on their own rich grounds. Theſe are in general of a larger ſize
than their own natural breed; and they fatten very eaſily. The cattle of the
Ukraine, where the paſture is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, become very fat, and are
conſidered as the largeſt breed of all Europe. In Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where the
mountains are covered with a rich nouriſhing herbage, which is entirely
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for their kine, theſe animals grow to a very large ſize. On the
contrary, in France, where they get no other graſs but what is thought unfit
for horſes, they dwindle, and grow lean. In ſome parts of Spain, the cow
grows to a good ſize; thoſe wild bulls, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which they pride
themſelves ſo much in <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0823800103:26"/> combating, are a very mean
deſpicable little animal, and ſomewhat ſhaped like one of our cows, with
nothing of that peculiar ſternneſs of aſpect for which our bulls are
remarkable. In Barbary, and the provinces of Africa, where the ground is dry,
and the paſturage ſhort, the cows are of a very ſmall breed, and give
milk in proportion. On the contrary, in Ethiopia, they are of a prodigious
bigneſs. The ſame holds in Perſia and Tartary; where, in ſome places,
they are very ſmall, and, in others, of an amazing ſtature It is thus, in
almoſt every part of the world, this animal is found to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond in
ſize to the quantity of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion.</p>
            <p>If we examine the form of theſe animals, as they are found tame,
in different regions, we ſhall find, that the breed of the urus, or thoſe
without an hump, chiefly occupies the cold and the temperate zones, and is not
ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed towards the ſouth. On the contrary, the breed of the
biſon, or the animal with an hump, is found in all the ſouthern parts of
the world; throughout the vaſt continent of India; throughout Africa, from
Mount Atlas to the Cape of Good Hope. In all theſe countries, the biſon
ſeems chiefly to prevail; where they are found to have a ſmooth ſoft
hair, are <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0823800103:27"/> very nimble of foot, and in ſome meaſure
ſupply the want of horſes. The biſon breed is alſo more expert and
docile than ours; many of them, when they carry burthens, bend their knees to
take them up, or ſet them down: they are treated, therefore, by the natives
of thoſe countries, with a degree of tenderneſs and care equal to their
utility; and the reſpect for them in India has degenerated even into blind
adoration. But it is among the Hottentots where theſe animals are chiefly
eſteemed, as being more than commonly ſerviceable. They are their fellow
domeſtics, the companions of their pleaſures and fatigues; the cow is at
once the Hottentot's protector and ſervant, aſſiſts him in attending
his flocks, and guarding them againſt every invader; while the ſheep are
grazing, the faithful backely, as this kind of cow is called, ſtands or
grazes beſide them: ſtill, however, attentive to the looks of its maſter,
the backely flies round the field, herds in the ſheep that are ſtraying,
obliges them to keep within proper limits, and ſhews no mercy to robbers, or
even ſtrangers, who attempt to plunder. But it is not the plunderers of the
ſtock alone, but even the enemies of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that theſe backelys are
taught to combat. Every army of Hottentots is furniſhed with a 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0823800103:28"/> proper herd of theſe, which are let looſe againſt
the enemy, when the occaſion is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. Being thus ſent
forward, they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn all before them; they ſtrike every oppoſer down
with their horns, and trample upon them with their feet; and thus often procure
their maſters an eaſy victory, even before they have attempted to ſtrike
a blow. An animal ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, it may be ſuppoſed, is not without
its reward. The backely lives in the ſame cottage with its maſter, and, by
long habit, gains an affection for him; and in proportion as the man approaches
to the brute, ſo the brute ſeems to attain even to ſome ſhare of human
ſagacity. The Hottentot and his backely thus mutually aſſiſt each
other; and when the latter happens to die, a new one is choſen to ſucceed
him, by a council of the old men of the village. The new backely is then joined
with one of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terans of his own kind, from whom he learns his art, becomes
ſocial and diligent, and is taken for life into human friendſhip and
protection.</p>
            <p>The biſons, or cows with an hump, are found to differ very much
from each other in the ſeveral parts of the world where they are found. The
wild ones of this kind, as with us, are much larger than the tame. Some have
horns, and ſome are without any; ſome <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0823800103:29"/> have them
depreſſed, and ſome raiſed in ſuch a manner that they are uſeleſs
as weapons of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance or defence; ſome are extremely large; and others
among them, ſuch as the zebu, or Barbary cow, are very ſmall. They are all,
however, equally docile and gentle when tamed; and, in general, furniſhed
with a fine luſtrous ſoft hair, more beautiful than that of our own breed;
their hump is alſo of different ſizes, in ſome weighing from forty to
fifty pounds, in others leſs; it is not, however, to be conſidered as a
part neceſſarily belonging to the animal; and probably it might be cut away
without much injury: it reſembles a griſtly fat; and, as I am aſſured,
cuts and taſtes ſomewhat like a dreſſed udder. The biſons of Malabar,
Abyſſinia, and Madagaſcar, are of the great kind, as the paſtures there
are plentiful. Thoſe of Arabia, Petraea, and moſt parts of Africa, are
ſmall, and of the zebu or little kind. In America, eſpecially towards the
north, the biſon is well known. The American biſon, however, is found to be
rather leſs than that of the ancient continent; its hair is longer and
thicker, its beard more remarkable, and its hide more luſtrous and ſoft.
There are many of them brought up tame in Carolina; however, their 
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0823800103:30"/> wild diſpoſitions ſtill ſeem to continue, for they
break through all fences to get into the corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields, and lead the whole tame
herd after them, wherever they penetrate. They breed alſo with the tame kinds
originally brought over from Europe; and thus produce a race peculiar to that
country.</p>
            <p>From all this it appears<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol.
xxiii. p. 130.</bibl>
               </note>, that naturaliſts have given various names to
animals in reality the ſame, and only differing in ſome few accidental
circumſtances. The wild cow and the tame, the animal belonging to Europe, and
that of Aſia, Africa, and America, the bonafus and the urus, the biſon and
the zebu, are all one and the ſame, propagate among each other, and, in the
courſe of a few generations, the hump wears away, and ſcarce any veſtiges
of ſavage fierceneſs are found to remain. Of all animals, therefore, except
man alone, the cow ſeems moſt extenſively propagated. Its nature ſeems
equally capable of the rigours of heat and cold. It is an inhabitant as well of
the frozen fields of Iceland, as the burning deſarts of Lybia. It ſeems an
ancient inmate in every climate, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic and tame in thoſe countries
which have been civilized, ſavage and wild in the countries which are leſs
peopled, but capable of being <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0823800103:31"/> made uſeful in all: able
to defend itſelf in a ſtate of nature againſt the moſt powerful enemy
of the foreſt; and only ſubordinate to man, whoſe force it has
experienced, and whoſe aid it at laſt ſeems to require. However wild the
calves are which are taken from the dam in a ſavage ſtate, either in Africa
or Aſia, they ſoon become humble, patient, and familiar, and man may be
conſidered, in thoſe countries, as almoſt helpleſs without their
aſſiſtance. Other animals preſerve their nature or their form with
inflexible perſeverance; but theſe, in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, ſuit
themſelves to the appetites and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of mankind; and as their
ſhapes are found to alter, ſo alſo does their nature; in no animal is
there ſeen a greater variety of kinds, and in none a more humble and pliant
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>

               <head>THE BUFFALO.</head>
               <p>IF we ſhould compare the ſhape of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cow with that of
the biſon, the difference will appear very great. The ſhaggy mane of the
latter, the beard, the curled forehead, the inverted horns, the broad breaſt,
and the narrow hinder parts, give it the appearance rather of 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0823800103:32"/> a lion than a cow; and fit it more for a ſtate of war
with mankind, than a ſtate of ſervitude. Yet, notwithſtanding theſe
appearances, both animals are found to be the ſame; or at leaſt ſo nearly
allied, that they breed among each other, and propagate a race that continues
the kind.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, if we compare the buffalo with our common cow,
no two animals can be more nearly alike, either in their form or their nature;
both equally ſubmiſſive to the yoke, both often living under the ſame
roof, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſame domeſtic ſervices; the make and the turn
of their bodies ſo much alike, that it requires a cloſe attention to
diſtinguiſh them: and yet, after all this, no two animals can be more

remaining, it is probable the race of both would ſhortly be extinct. However,
ſuch is the fixed averſion formed between theſe creatures, that the cow
refuſes to breed with the buffalo, which it nearly reſembles; while it is
known to propagate with the biſon, to which it has, in point of form, but a
very diſtant ſimilitude.</p>
               <p>The buffalo is, upon the whole, by no means ſo beautiful a
creature as the cow; his figure <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0823800103:33"/> is more clumſy and
aukward; his air is wilder; and he carries his head lower, and nearer the
ground; his limbs are leſs fleſhy, and his tail more naked of hair; his
body is ſhorter and thicker than that of the cow kind; his legs are higher;
his head ſmaller; his horns not ſo round, black, and compreſſed, with a
bunch of curled hair hanging down between them; his ſkin is alſo harder and
thicker, more black, and leſs furniſhed with hair; his fleſh, which is
hard and blackiſh, is not only diſagreeable to the taſte, but likewiſe
to the ſmell. The milk of the female is by no means ſo good as that of the
cow; it is however produced in great abundance. In the warm countries, almoſt
all their cheeſe is made of the milk of the buffalo; and they ſupply butter
alſo in large quantities. The veal of the young buffalo is not better eating
than the beef of the old. The hide of this animal ſeems to be the moſt
valuable thing he furniſhes. The leather made of it is well known for its
thickneſs, ſoftneſs, and impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trability. As theſe animals are, in
general, larger and ſtronger than the cow, they are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully employed in
agriculture. They are uſed in drawing burthens, and ſometimes in carrying
them; being guided by a ring, which is thruſt through their noſe. Two
buffaloes yoaked in a <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0823800103:34"/> waggon are ſaid to draw more than
four ſtrong horſes; as their heads and necks are naturally bent downward,
they are thus better fitted for the draught, and the whole weight of their
bodies is applied to the carriage that is to be drawn forward.</p>
               <p>From the ſize and bulk of the buffalo, we may be eaſily led to
conclude that he is a native of the warmer climates. The largeſt quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes
are generally found in the torrid zone; and the buffalo is inferior, in point
of ſize, only to the elephant, the rhinoceros, or the hippopotamos. The
camelopard, or the camel, may, indeed, be taller, but they are neither ſo
long, or near ſo corpulent. Accordingly, we find this animal wild in many
parts of India; and tamed alſo wherever the natives have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for his
ſervices. The wild buffaloes are very dangerous animals, and are often found
to gore travellers to death, and then trample them with their feet, until they
have entirely mangled the whole body: however, in the woods they are not ſo
much to be feared as in the plains, becauſe in the violence of their
purſuit their large horns are apt to be entangled in the branches of the
trees, which gives thoſe who have been ſurprized by them, time to eſcape
the danger. There is ſcarce any <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0823800103:35"/> other method of avoiding
their purſuit; they run with great ſwiftneſs; they overturn a tree of
moderate growth; and are ſuch ſwimmers, as to croſs the largeſt rivers
without any difficulty. In this manner, like all other large animals of the
torrid zone, they are very fond of the water; and, in the midſt of their
purſuit, often plunge in, in order to cool themſelves. The Negroes of
Guinea, and the Indians of Malabar, where buffaloes are in great abundance,
take great delight in hunting and deſtroying them; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they never
attempt to face the buffalo openly, but, generally climbing up a tree, ſhoot
at him from thence, and do not come down till they find they have effectually
diſpatched him. However, when they are tamed, no animal can be more patient
or humble; and though by no means ſo docile as the cow kind, yet they go
through domeſtic drudgeries with more ſtrength and perſeverance.</p>
               <p>Although theſe animals be chiefly found in the torrid zone, yet
they are bred in ſeveral parts of Europe, particularly in Italy, where they
make the food and the riches of the poor. The female produces but one at a
time, in the ſame manner as the cow; but they are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in the
times of geſtation; for the cow, as we know, goes but nine months; whereas
the <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0823800103:36"/> buffalo continues pregnant for twelve. They are all
afraid of fire; and, perhaps, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this, have an averſion to
red colours, that reſemble the colour of flame: it is ſaid, that in thoſe
countries where they are found in plenty, no perſon dares to dreſs in
ſcarlet. In general they are inoffenſive animals, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed; as
indeed all thoſe which feed upon graſs are found to be; but when they are
wounded, or when even but fired at, nothing then can ſtop their fury; they
then turn up the ground with their fore feet, bellow much louder and more
terribly than the bull, and make at the object of their reſentment with
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable rage. It is happy, in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, if the perſon
they purſue has a wall to eſcape over, or ſome ſuch obſtacle,
otherwiſe they ſoon overtake, and inſtantly deſtroy him. It is
remarkable, however, that although their horns are ſo very formidable, they
in general make more uſe of their feet in combat, and rather tread their
enemies to death than gore them.</p>
               <p>Having thus gone through the hiſtory of theſe animals, it may
be proper to obſerve, that no names have been more indiſcriminately uſed
than thoſe of the bull, the urus, the biſon, and the buffalo. It therefore
becomes ſuch as <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0823800103:37"/> would have diſtinct ideas of each, to
be careful in ſeparating the kinds, the one from the other, allowing the cow
for the ſtandard of all. The urus, whether of the large enormous kind of
Lithuania, or the ſmaller race of Spain, whether with long or ſhort horns,
whether with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out long hair in the forehead, is every way the ſame
with what our common breed was before they were taken from the foreſt, and
reduced to a ſtate of ſervitude. The biſon, and all its varieties, which
are known by an hump between the ſhoulders, is alſo to be ranked in the
ſame claſs. This animal, whether with crooked or ſtrait horns, whether
they be turned towards the cheek, or totally wanting, whether it be large or
diminutive, whatever be its colour, or whatever the length of its hair, whether
called the bonaſus by ſome, or the bubalus by others, is but a variety of
the cow kind, with whom it breeds, and with whom of conſequence it has the
cloſeſt connection. Laſtly, the buffalo, though ſhaped much more like
the cow, is a diſtinct kind by itſelf, that never mixes with any of the
former; that goes twelve months with young; whereas the cow goes but nine; that
teſtifies an averſion to the latter; and, though bred under the ſame
roof, or feeding in the ſame paſture, has always kept ſeparate; and 
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0823800103:38"/> makes a diſtinct race in all parts of the world. Theſe
two kinds are ſuppoſed to be the only real varieties in the cow kind, of
which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts have given ſo many varieties. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſome
circumſtances mentioned by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, ſuch as that of many kinds
defending themſelves by voiding their dung againſt their purſuers; this
is a practice which they have in common with other timid creatures when
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and ariſes rather from fear than a deſire of defence. The
muſky ſmell alſo by which ſome have been diſtinguiſhed, is found
common to many of theſe kinds, in a ſtate of nature; and does not properly
make the characteriſtic marks of any. The particular kind of noiſe alſo
which ſome of them are known to make, which rather reſembles grunting than
bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or lowing, is but a ſavage variety, which many wild animals have,
and yet loſe when brought into a ſtate of tameneſs. For theſe
reaſons, Mr. Buffon, whom I have followed in this deſcription, is of
opinion, that the zebu, or little African cow, and the grunting, or Sibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
cow, are but different races of the biſon; as the ſhape of the horns, or
the length of the hair, are never properly characteriſtic marks of any
animal, but are found to vary with climate, food, and cultivation.</p>

                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0823800103:42"/>In this manner the number of animals of the
cow kind, which naturaliſts have extended to eight or ten ſorts, are
reduced to two; and as the utmoſt deference is paid to the opinion of Mr.
Buffon in this particular, I have taken him for my guide. Nevertheleſs, there
is an animal of the cow kind, which neither he, nor any other naturaliſt that
I know of, has hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, yet which makes a very diſtinct
claſs, and may be added as a third ſpecies.</p>
               <p>This animal was ſhewn ſome years ago in London, and ſeemed
to unite many of the characteriſtics of the cow and the hog; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
head, the horns, and the tail of the former; with the briſtles, the colour,
and the grunting of the latter. It was about the ſize of an aſs, but
broader and thicker; the colour reſembling that of an hog, and the hair
briſtly, as in that animal. The hair upon the body was thin, as in the hog;
and a row of briſtles ran along the ſpine, rather ſhorter and ſofter
than in the hog kind. The head was rather larger than that of a cow; the teeth
were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely reſembling thoſe of that animal, and the tongue was rough in
like manner. It fed upon hay; and, conſequently, its internal confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
muſt have reſembled that of the cow <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0823800103:43"/> kind more than the
hog, whoſe food is always choſen of a kind more ſucculent. The eyes were
placed in the head as with the cow, and were pretty nearly of the ſame
colour; the horns were black and flattiſh, but bent rather backwards to the
neck, as in the goat kind; the neck was ſhort and thick, and the back rather
riſing in the middle; it was cloven footed, like the cow, without thoſe
hinder claws that are found in the hog kinds. But the greateſt variety of all
in this extraordinary creature, which was a female, was, that it had but two
teats, and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, in that reſpect, reſembled neither of the
kinds to which, in other circumſtances, it bore ſo ſtrong a ſimilitude.
Whether this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal was a diſtinct kind, or a monſter, I will not pretend
to ſay; it was ſhewn under the name of the bonafus; and it was ſaid, by
the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſhewed it, to have come from India: but no credit is to be
given to intereſted ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; the perſon only wanted to make the animal
appear as extraordinary as poſſible; and I believe would ſcarcely
ſcruple a lie or two, to encreaſe that wonder in us, by which he found the
means of living.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. Of Animals of the Sheep and Goat Kind.</head>
            <p>AS no two animals are found entirely the ſame, ſo it is not to
be expected that any two races of animals ſhould exactly correſpond in
every particular. The goat and the ſheep are apparently different, in the
form of their bodies, in their covering, and in their horns. They may from
hence be conſidered as two different kinds, with regard to all common and
domeſtic pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. But if we come to examine them cloſer, and obſerve
their internal conformation, no two animals can be more alike; their feet,
their four ſtomachs, their ſuet, their appetites, all are entirely the
ſame, and ſhew the ſimilitude between them: but what makes a much
ſtronger connection is, that they propagate with each other. The buck goat is
found to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce with the ewe an animal that in two or three generations
returns to the ſheep, and ſeems to retain no marks of its ancient
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitor<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon paſſim.</bibl>
               </note>. The
ſheep and the goat, therefore, may be conſidered as belonging to one
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; and were the whole races reduced to one <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0823800103:45"/> of each,
they would quickly repleniſh the earth with their kind.</p>
            <p>If we examine the ſheep and goat internally, we ſhall find, as
was ſaid, that their confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is entirely the ſame; nor is their
ſtructure very remote from that of the cow kind, which they reſemble in
their hoofs, and in their chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cud. Indeed, all ruminant animals are
internally very much alike. The goat, the ſheep, or the deer, exhibit to the
eye of the anatomiſt the ſame parts in miniature, which the cow or the
biſon exhibited in the great. But the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences between thoſe animals
are, nevertheleſs, ſufficiently apparent. Nature has obviouſly marked the
diſtinctions between the cow and the ſheep kind, by their form and ſize;
and they are alſo diſtinguiſhed from thoſe of the deer kind, by never
ſhedding their horns. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the form and figure of theſe animals, if
there were nothing elſe, would ſeldom fail of guiding us to the kind; and
we might almoſt, upon ſight, tell which belongs to the deer kind, and which
are to be degraded into that of the goat. However, the annually ſhedding the
horns in the deer, and the permanence in the ſheep, draws a pretty exact line
between the kinds; ſo that we may hold to this diſtinction only, and define
the ſheep and goat kind as ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0823800103:46"/> animals of a
ſmaller ſize, that never ſhed their horns.</p>
            <p>If we conſider theſe harmleſs and uſeful ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals in one
point of view, we ſhall find that both have been long reclaimed, and brought
into a ſtate of domeſtic ſervitude. Both ſeem to require protection
from man; and are, in ſome meaſure, pleaſed with his ſociety. The
ſheep, indeed, is the more ſerviceable creature of the two; but the goat
has more ſenſibility and attachment. The attending upon both was once the
employment of the wiſeſt and the beſt of men; and thoſe have been ever
ſuppoſed the happieſt times, in which theſe harmleſs creatures were
conſidered as the chief objects of human attention. In the earlieſt ages,
the goat ſeemed rather the greater favourite; and, indeed, it continues
ſuch to this day among the poor. However, the ſheep has long ſince become
the principal object of human care; while the goat is diſregarded by the
generality of mankind, or become the poſſeſſion only of the loweſt of
the people. The ſheep, therefore, and its varieties, may be conſidered
firſt; and the goat, with all thoſe of its kind, will then properly
follow.</p>

               <head>THE SHEEP.</head>
               <p>THOSE animals that take refuge under the protection of man, in a
few generations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come indolent and helpleſs. Having loſt the habit of
ſelf-defence, they ſeem to loſe alſo the inſtincts of nature. The
ſheep, in its preſent domeſtic ſtate, is of all animals the moſt
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs and inoffenſive. With its liberty it ſeems to have been
deprived of its ſwiftneſs and cunning; and what in the aſs might rather
be called patience, in the ſheep appears to be ſtupidity. With no one
quality to fit it for ſelf-preſervation, it makes vain efforts at all.
Without ſwiftneſs, it endeavours to fly; and without ſtrength,
ſometimes offers to oppoſe. But theſe feeble attempts rather incite than
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the inſults of every enemy; and the dog follows the flock with
greater delight upon ſeeing them fly, and attacks them with more fierceneſs
upon their unſupported attempts at reſiſtance. Indeed they run together
in flocks; rather with the hopes of loſing their ſingle danger in the
crowd, than of uniting to repreſs the attack by numbers. The ſheep,
therefore, were it expoſed in its preſent ſtate to ſtruggle with its
natural enemies of the foreſt, it would <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0823800103:48"/> ſoon be
extirpated. Loaded with an heavy fleece, deprived of the defence of its horns,
and rendered heavy, ſlow, and feeble, it can have no other ſafety but what
it finds from man. This animal is now, therefore, obliged to rely ſolely upon
that art for protection, to which it originally owes its degradation.</p>
               <p>But we are not to impute to Nature the formation of an animal ſo
utterly unprovided againſt its enemies, and ſo unfit for defence. The
moufflon, which is the ſheep in a ſavage ſtate, is a bold, fleet
creature, able to eſcape from the greater animals by its ſwiftneſs, or to
oppoſe the ſmaller kinds with the arms it has received from Nature. It is
by human art alone that the ſheep is become the tardy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs creature
we find it. Every race of quadrupedes might eaſily be corrupted by the ſame
allurements by which the ſheep has been thus debilitated and depreſſed.
While undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, and properly ſupplied, none are found to ſet any
bounds to their appetite. They all purſue their food while able, and continue
to graze, till they often die of diſorders occaſioned by too much
fatneſs. But it is very different with them in a ſtate of nature: they are
in the foreſt ſurrounded by dangers, and alarmed with unceaſing
hoſtilities; they are purſued <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0823800103:49"/> every hour from one
tract of country to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſpend a great part of their time in
attempts to avoid their enemies. Thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly exerciſed, and
continually practiſing all the arts of defence and eſcape, the animal at
once preſerves its life and native independance, together with its
ſwiftneſs, and the ſlender agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of its form.</p>
               <p>The ſheep, in its ſervile ſtate, ſeems to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
of all inclinations of its own; and of all animals it appears the moſt
ſtupid. Every qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupede has a peculiar turn of countenance, a
phyſiognomy, if we may ſo call it, that generally marks its nature. The
ſheep ſeems to have none of thoſe traits that betoken either courage or
cunning; its large eyes, ſeparated from each other, its ears ſticking out
on each ſide, and its narrow noſtrils, all teſtify the extreme
ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of this creature; and the poſition of its horns alſo, ſhew
that Nature deſigned the ſheep rather for flight than combat. It appears a
large maſs of fleſh, ſupported upon four ſmall ſtrait legs, ill
fitted for carrying ſuch a burthen; its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are aukward, it is eaſily
fatigued, and often ſinks under the weight of its own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulency. In
proportion as theſe marks of human transformation are more numerous, the
animal becomes more helpleſs and ſtupid. Thoſe which live upon a more
fertile paſture, <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0823800103:50"/> and grow fat, become entirely feeble;
thoſe that want horns, are found more dull and heavy than the reſt<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Daubenton upon the Sheep.</bibl>
                  </note>; thoſe
whoſe fleeces are longeſt and fineſt, are moſt ſubject to a variety
of diſorders; and, in ſhort, whatever changes have been wrought in this
animal by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of man, are entirely calculated for human advantage,
and not for that of the creature itſelf. It might require a ſucceſſion
of ages, before the ſheep could be reſtored to its primitive ſtate of
activity, ſo as to become a match for its purſuers of the foreſt.</p>
               <p>The goat, which it reſembles in ſo many other reſpects, is
much its ſuperior. The one has its particular attachments, ſees danger, and
generally contrives to eſcape it; but the other is timid without a cauſe,
and ſecure when real danger approaches. Nor is the ſheep, when bred up tame
in the houſe, and familiarized with its keepers, leſs obſtinately
abſurd: from being dull and timid, it then acquires a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of pert
familiarity; buts with its head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes miſchievous, and ſhews itſelf
every way unworthy of being ſingled out from the reſt of the flock. Thus it
ſeems rather formed for ſlavery than friendſhip; and framed more for the
neceſſities than the amuſements of <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0823800103:51"/> mankind. There is
but one inſtance in which the ſheep ſhews any attachment to its keeper;
and that is ſeen rather on the continent, than among us in Great Britain.
What I allude to is, their following the ſound of the ſhepherd's pipe.
Before I had ſeen them trained in this manner, I had no conception of thoſe
deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the old paſtoral poets, of the ſhepherd leading his
flock from one country to another. As I had been uſed only to ſee theſe
harmleſs creatures driven before their keepers, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that all the
reſt was but invention: but in many parts of the Alps, and even ſome
provinces of France, the ſhepherd and his pipe are ſtill continued, with
true antique ſimplicity. The flock is regularly penned every evening, to
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from the wolf; and the ſhepherd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns homeward at
ſun-ſet, with his ſheep fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him, and ſeemingly pleaſed with
the ſound of the pipe, which is blown with a reed, and reſembles the
chanter of a bag-pipe. In this manner, in thoſe countries that ſtill
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue poor, the Arcadian life is preſerved in all its former purity; but
in countries where a greater inequality of conditions prevail, the ſhepherd
is generally ſome poor wretch who attends a flock from which he is to derive
no <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0823800103:52"/> benefits, and only guards thoſe luxuries which he is
not fated to ſhare</p>
               <p>It does not appear, from early writers, that the ſheep was bred
in Britain; and it was not till ſeveral ages after this animal was
cultivated, that the woollen manufacture was carried on among us<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Britiſh Zoology, vol. i. p. 23.</bibl>
                  </note>. That
valuable branch of buſineſs lay for a conſiderable time in foreign hands;
and we were obliged to import the cloth, manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured from our own materials.
There were, notwithſtanding, many unavailing efforts among our kings to
introduce and preſerve the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture at home. Henry the Second, by a
pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent granted to the weavers in London, directed, that if any cloth was found
made of a mixture of Spaniſh wool, it ſhould be burned by the mayor. Such
edicts at length, although but ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, operated towards the eſtabliſhing
this trade among us. The Flemings, who at the revival of arts poſſeſſed
the art of cloth-working in a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior degree, were invited to ſettle
here; and, ſoon after, foreign cloth was prohibited from being worn in
England. In the times of queen Elizabeth, this manufacture received every
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; and many of the inhabitants of the Netherlands being then
forced, by the tyranny of Spain, to take refuge in this <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0823800103:53"/>
country, they improved us in thoſe arts, in which we at preſent excell the
reſt of the world. Every art, however, has its riſe, its meridian, and its
decline; and it is ſuppoſed by many, that the woollen manufacture has for
ſome time been decaying amongſt us. The cloth now made is thought to be
much worſe than that of ſome years paſt; being neither ſo firm nor ſo
fine, neither ſo much courted abroad, nor ſo ſerviceable at home.</p>
               <p>No country, however, produces ſuch ſheep as England; either
with larger fleeces, or better adapted for the buſineſs of cloathing.
Thoſe of Spain, indeed, are finer, and we generally require ſome of their
wool to work up with our own; but the weight of a Spaniſh fleece is no way
comparable to one of Lincoln or Warwickſhire; and, in thoſe counties, it is
no uncommon thing to give fifty guineas for a ram.</p>
               <p>The ſheep without horns are counted the beſt ſort, becauſe
a great part of the animal's nouriſhment is ſuppoſed to go up into the
horns<note n="*" place="bottom">

teeth; but have eight in the lower jaw: two of theſe drop, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
at two years old; four of them are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0823800103:54"/> at three
years old; and all at four. The new teeth are eaſily known from the reſt,
by their freſhneſs and whiteneſs. There are ſome breeds, however, in
England, that never change their teeth at all; theſe the ſhepherds call the
leather mouthed cattle; and, as their teeth are thus longer wearing, they are
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuppoſed to grow old a year or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt<note n="*" place="bottom">

ſheep bring forth one or two at a time; and ſometimes three or four. The
firſt lamb of an ewe is generally pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellied, ſhort and thick, and of
leſs value than thoſe of a ſecond or third production; the third being
ſuppoſed the beſt of all. They bear their young five months; and, by
being houſed, they bring forth at any time of the year.</p>
               <p>But this animal, in its domeſtic ſtate, is too well known to
require a detail of its peculiar habits, or of the arts which have been uſed
to improve the breed. Indeed, in the eye of an obſerver of Nature, every art
which tends to render the creature more helpleſs and uſeleſs to itſelf,
may be conſidered rather as an injury than an improvement; and if we are to
look for this animal in its nobleſt ſtate, we muſt ſeek for it in the
African deſert, or the extenſive plains of Siberia. Among the degenerate 
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0823800103:55"/> deſcendants of the wild ſheep, there have been ſo
many changes wrought, as entirely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe the kind, and often to
miſlead the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver. The variety is ſo great that ſcarce any two
countries has its ſheep of the ſame kind; but there is found a manifeſt
difference in all, either in the ſize, the covering, the ſhape, or the
horns.</p>
               <p>The woolly ſheep<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>, as it is ſeen among us, is found only in
Europe, and ſome of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate provinces of Aſia. When tranſported
into warmer countries, either into Florida or Guinea, it loſes its wool, and
aſſumes a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering fitted to the climate, becoming hairy and rough; it
there alſo loſes its fertility, and its fleſh no longer has the ſame
flavour. In the ſame manner, in the very cold countries, it ſeems equally
helpleſs and a ſtranger; it ſtill requires the unceaſing attention of
mankind for its preſervation; and although it is found to ſubſiſt, as
well in Greenland as in Guinea<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Krantz.</bibl>
                  </note>, yet it ſeems a natural inhabitant
of neither.</p>
               <p>Of the domeſtic kinds to be found in the different parts of the
world, beſides our own, which is common in Europe, the firſt variety is to
be ſeen in Iceland, Muſcovy, and the coldeſt climates of the north. This,
which <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0823800103:56"/> may be called the Iceland ſheep, reſembles our
breed, in the form of the body and the tail; but differs in a very
extraordinary manner in the number of the horns; being generally found to have
four, and ſometimes even eight, growing from different parts of the forehead.
Theſe are large and formidable; and the animal ſeems thus fitted by Nature
for a ſtate of war: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is of the nature of the reſt of its kind,
being mild, gentle, and timid. Its wool is very different, alſo, from that of
the common ſheep, being long, ſmooth, and hairy. Its colour is of a dark
brown; and under its outward coat of hair, it has an internal covering, that
rather reſembles fur than wool, being fine, ſhort, and ſoft.</p>
               <p>The ſecond variety to be found in this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, is that of the
broad tail'd ſheep, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Tartary, Arabia, Perſia, Barbary,
Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, and Egypt. This ſheep is only remarkable for its large and heavy
tail, which is often found to weigh from twenty to thirty pounds. It
ſometimes grows a foot broad, and is obliged to be ſupported by a ſmall
kind of board, that goes upon wheels. This tail is not covered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath with
wool, like the upper part, but is bare; and the natives, who conſider it as a
very great delicacy, are very careful in attending and <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0823800103:57"/>
preſerving it from injury. Mr. Buffon ſuppoſes that the fat which falls
into the caul in our ſheep, goes in theſe to furniſh the tail; and that
the reſt of the body is from thence deprived of fat in proportion. With
regard to their fleeces, in the temperate climates, they are, as in our own
breed, ſoft and woolly; but in the warmer latitudes, they are hairy: yet in
both they preſerve the enormous ſize of their tails.</p>
               <p>The third obſervable variety is that of the ſheep called
ſtrepſicheros. This animal is a native of the iſlands of the Archipelago,
and only differs from our ſheep, in having ſtrait horns, ſurrounded with
a ſpiral furrow.</p>
               <p>The laſt variety is that of the Guinea ſheep, which is
generally found in all the tropical cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, both of Africa and the
Eaſt-Indies. They are of a large ſize, with a rough hairy ſkin, ſhort
horns, and ears hanging down, with a kind of dewlap under the chin. They differ
greatly in form from the reſt; and might be conſidered as animals of
another kind, were they not known to breed with other ſheep. Theſe, of all
the domeſtic kinds, ſeem to approach the neareſt to the ſtate of
nature. They are larger, ſtronger, and ſwifter than the common race; and,
conſequently, better fitted for a preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious foreſt life. However, they
ſeem to rely, <pb facs="tcp:0823800103:58"/>

ſupport; being entirely of a domeſtic nature, and ſubſiſting only in
the warmer climates.</p>
               <p>Such are the varieties of this animal, which have been reduced
into a ſtate of domeſtic ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude. Theſe are all capable of producing
among each other; all the peculiarities of their form have been made by climate
and human cultivation; and none of them ſeem ſufficiently independent, to
live in a ſtate of ſavage nature. They are, therefore, to be conſidered
as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate race, formed by the hand of man, and propagated merely for his
benefit. At the ſame time, while man thus cultivates the domeſtic kinds, he
drives away and deſtroys the ſavage race, which are leſs beneficial, and
more head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong. Theſe, therefore, are to be found in but a very ſmall
number, in the moſt uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated countries, where they have been able to
ſubſiſt by their native ſwiftneſs and ſtrength. It is in the more
uncultivated parts of Greece, Sardinia, Corſica, and particularly in the
deſarts of Tartary, that the mufflon is to be found, that bears all the marks
of being the primitive race; and that has been actually known to breed with the
domeſtic animal.</p>

bears a ſtronger ſimilitude to the ram than to any other animal; like the
ram, it has the eyes placed near the horns; and its ears are ſhorter than
thoſe of the goat: it alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the ram in its horns, and in all
the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular contours of its form. The horns alſo are alike; they are of a
yellow colour they have three ſides, as in the ram, and bend backwards in the
ſame manner behind the ears. The muzzle, and the inſide of the ears, are of
a whitiſh colour, tinctured with yellow; the other parts of the face are of a
browniſh grey. The general co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the hair over the body is of a brown,
approaching to that of the red deer. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the thighs and belly, are
of a white, tinctured with yellow. The form, upon the whole, ſeems more made
for agility and ſtrength than that of the common ſheep; and the moufflon is
actually found to live in a ſavage ſtate, and maintain itſelf, either by
force or ſwiftneſs, againſt all the animals that live by rapine. Such is
its extreme ſpeed, that many have been inclined rather to rank it among the
deer kind, than the ſheep. But in this they are deceived, as the muſmon has
a mark that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diſtinguiſhes it from that ſpecies, being known
never to ſhed its horns. In ſome theſe are ſeen to grow to a
ſurprizing ſize; many of <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0823800103:63"/> them meaſuring, in their
convolutions, above two ells long. They are of a yellow colour, as was ſaid;
but the older the animal grows, the darker the horns become: with theſe they
often maintain very furious battles between each other; and ſometimes they
are found broken off in ſuch a manner, that the ſmall animals of the
foreſt creep into the cavity for ſhelter<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Gmelin, as quoted by Buffon.</bibl>
                  </note>. When the
muſmon is ſeen ſtanding on the plain, his fore legs are always ſtrait,
while his hinder legs ſeem bent under him; but in caſes of more active
neceſſity, this ſeeming deformity is removed, and he moves with great
ſwiftneſs and agility. The female very much reſembles the male of this
ſpecies, but that ſhe is leſs, and her horns alſo are never ſeen to
grow to that prodigious ſize they are of in the wild ram. Such is the ſheep
in its ſavage ſtate; a bold, noble, and even beautiful animal: but it is
not the moſt beautiful creatures that are always found moſt uſeful to
man. Human induſtry has therefore deſtroyed its grace, to improve its
utility.</p>

               <head>THE GOAT, AND ITS NUMEROUS VARIETIES.</head>
               <p>THERE are ſome domeſtic animals that ſeem as auxiliaries to
the more uſeful ſorts; and, that by ceaſing to be the firſt, are
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as nothing. We have ſeen the ſervices of the aſs
ſlighted, becauſe inferior to thoſe of the horſe; and, in the ſame
manner, thoſe of the goat are held cheap, becauſe the ſheep ſo far
exceeds it. Were the horſe or the ſheep removed from nature, the inferior
kinds would then be invaluable; and the ſame arts would probably be
beſtowed in perfecting their kinds, that the higher order of animals have
experienced. But in their preſent neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſtate, they vary but little
from the wild animals of the ſame kind; man has left them their primitive
habits and forms; and the leſs they owe to his aſſiduity, the more they
receive from nature.</p>
               <p>The goat ſeems, in every reſpect, more fitted for a life of
ſavage liberty than the ſheep<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon.</bibl>
                  </note>. It is naturally more lively, and more
poſſeſſed with animal inſtinct. It eaſily attaches itſelf to man,
and ſeems ſenſible of his careſſes. <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0823800103:65"/> It is alſo
ſtronger and ſwifter, more courageous, and more playful, lively,
capricious, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant: it is not eaſily confined to its flock, but
chuſes its own paſtures, and loves to ſtray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the reſt. It
chiefly delights in climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing precipices; in going to the very edge of danger:
it is often ſeen ſuſpended upon an eminence hanging over the ſea, upon
a very little baſe, and even ſleeps there in ſecurity. Nature has, in
ſome meaſure, fitted it for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing theſe declivities with eaſe;
the hoof is hollow underneath, with ſharp edges, ſo that it walks as
ſecurely on the ridge of an houſe, as on the level ground. It is an hardy
animal, and very eaſily ſuſtained; for which reaſon it is chiefly the
property of the poor, who have no paſtures with which to ſupply it.
Happily, however, it ſeems better pleaſed with the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected wild, than
the cultivated fields of art; it chuſes the heathy mountain, or the ſhrubby
rock; its favourite food is the tops of the boughs, or the tender bark of young
trees: it ſeems leſs afraid of immoderate heat, and bears the warm
climates, better than the ſheep: it ſleeps expoſed to the ſun; and
ſeems to enjoy its warmeſt fervours: neither is it terrified at the
ſtorm, or incommoded by the rain; immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate cold alone ſeems to affect
it, and is ſaid <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0823800103:66"/> to produce a vertigo, with which this
animal is ſometimes incommoded. The inconſtancy of its nature is
perceivable in the irregularity of its gait; it goes forward, ſtops, runs,
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, flies, merely from caprice, and with no other ſeeming reaſon
than the extreme vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity of its diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>There are proofs of this animal's being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally the friend of
man; and that the goat ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom reſumes its primoeval wildneſs, when once
reduced into a ſtate of ſervitude. In the year 1698, an Engliſh
veſſel happening to touch at the iſlands of Bonaviſta, two Negroes
came, and offered the ſailors as many goats as they choſe to take away.
Upon the captain's expreſſing his aſtoniſhment at this offer, the
Negroes aſſured him that there were but twelve perſons in the iſland,
and that the goats were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied in ſuch a manner as even to become a
nuiſance: they added, that inſtead of giving any trouble to catch them,
they followed the few inhabitants that were left with a ſort of obſtinacy,
and rather became importunate with their tameneſs.</p>
               <p>The goat produces but two at a time; and three at the moſt. But
in the warmer climates, although the animal degenerates, and grows leſs, yet
it becomes more fruitful, being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0823800103:67"/> found to bring
forth three, four, and five at a ſingle delivery. The buck is capable of
propagating at the age of one year, and the female at ſeven months; however,
the fruits of this premature generation are weak and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; and their
beſt breeding-time is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally delayed till the age of two years, or
eighteen months at leaſt. One buck is ſufficient for an hundred and fifty
goats; his appetites are exceſſive: but this ardour brings on a ſpeedy
decay, ſo that he is enervated in four years at moſt, and even becomes old
before he reaches his ſeventh year. The goat, like the ſheep, continues
five months with young; and, in ſome places, bears twice a year.</p>
               <p>The milk of the goat is ſweet, nouriſhing, and medicinal; not
ſo apt to curdle upon the ſtomach as that of the cow; and, therefore,
preferable to thoſe whoſe digeſtion is but weak. The peculiarity of this
animal's food, gives the milk a flavour different from that either of the cow
or the ſheep; for as it generally feeds upon ſhrubby paſtures, and heathy
mountains, there is an agreeable wildneſs in the taſte very pleaſing to
ſuch as are fond of that aliment. In ſeveral parts of Ireland, and the
highlands of Scotland, the goat makes the chief poſſeſſion of the
inhabitants. On thoſe mountains, where <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0823800103:68"/> no other uſeful
animal could find ſubſiſtence, the goat continues to glean a ſufficient
living; and ſupplies the hardy natives with what they conſider as varied
luxury. They lie upon beds made of their ſkins, which are ſoft, clean, and
wholeſome; they live upon their milk, with oat bread; they convert a part of
it into butter, and ſome into cheeſe; the fleſh, indeed, they ſeldom
taſte of, as it is a delicacy which they find too expenſive; however, the
kid is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, even by the city epicure, as a great rarity; and the
fleſh of the goat, when properly prepared, is ranked by ſome as no way
inferior to veniſon. In this manner, even in the wildeſt ſolitudes, the
poor find comforts of which the rich do not think it worth their while to
diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them; in theſe mountainous retreats, where the
landſcape preſents only a ſcene of rocks, heaths, and ſhrubs, that
ſpeak the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſoil, theſe ſimple people have their
feaſts, and their pleaſures; their faithful flock of goats attends them to
theſe awful ſolitudes, and furniſhes them with all the neceſſaries of
life; while their remote ſituation happily keeps them ignorant of greater
luxury.</p>
               <p>As theſe animals are apt to ſtray from the flock, no man can
attend above fifty of them at a time. They are fattened in the ſame 
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0823800103:69"/> manner as ſheep; but, taking every precaution, their
fleſh is never ſo good or ſo ſweet, in our climate, as that of mutton.
It is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe between the tropics. The mutton there becomes flabby and
lean, while the fleſh of the goat rather ſeems to improve; and in ſome
places the latter is cultivated in preference to the former. We, therefore,
find this animal in almoſt every part of the world, as it ſeems fitted for
the neceſſities of man in both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes. Towards the north, where the
paſture is coarſe and barren, the goat is fitted to find a ſcanty
ſubſiſtence; between the tropics, where the heat is exceſſive, the
goat is fitted to bear the climate, and its fleſh is found to improve.</p>
               <p>One of the moſt remarkable varieties we find in the goat is in
that of Natolia. The Natolian goat, or, as Mr. Buffon calls it, the goat of
Angora, has the ears longer than ours, and broader in proportion. The male has
horns of about the ſame length with the goat of Europe, but black, and turned
very differently, going out horizontally on each ſide of the head, and
twiſted round in the manner of a cork-ſcrew. The horns of the female are
ſhorter, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle the ear ſomewhat like thoſe of the ram. They are
of a dazzling white colour, and in all the hair is very long, thick, fine, and
gloſſy; <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0823800103:70"/> which, indeed, is the caſe with almoſt all
the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of Syria. There are a great number of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals about Angora, where
the inhabitants drive trade with their hair, which is ſold either raw, or
manufactured into all parts of Europe. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can exceed the beauty of the
ſtuffs which are made from the hair of almoſt all the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of that
country. Theſe are well known among us by the name of camlet.</p>
               <p>A ſecond variety is the Aſſyrian goat of Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which is
ſomewhat larger than ours, with ears almoſt hanging down to the ground, and
broad in proportion. The horns, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, are not above two inches and
an half long, black, and bending a little backwards. The hair is of a fox
colour, and under the throat there are two excreſcences, like the gills of a
cock. Theſe animals are chiefly kept round Aleppo, for the ſake of their
milk. They are driven through the ſtreets, and their milk is ſold to the
inhabitants as they paſs along.</p>
               <p>In the third variety may be reckoned, the little goat of America,
which is of the ſize of a kid, but the hair is as long as that of the
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary breed. The horns, which do not exceed the length of a man's finger,
are thick, and bend downwards ſo cloſe to the head, that they almoſt
enter the ſkin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0823800103:71"/>There is an animal of this kind at the Cape of
Good Hope, called the blue goat, which may be ranked as the fourth variety. It
is in ſhape like the domeſtic, but much larger, being nearly of the ſize
of a ſtag. Its hair is very ſhort, and of a delightful blue; but it loſes
a great deal of its beauty when the animal is dead. It has a very long beard;
but the horns are not ſo long in proportion as in other goats, being turned
ſpirally, in the manner of a cork-ſcrew. It has very long legs, but well
propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and the fleſh is very well taſted, but lean. For this
reaſon, in that plentiful country, it is chiefly killed upon account of its
ſkin. It is a very ſhy animal, and ſeldom comes near the Dutch
ſettlements; but they are found in great abundance in the more uncultivated
parts of the country. Beſides theſe, they are found in this extenſive
region of various colours, and many of them are ſpotted beautifully, with
red, white, and brown.</p>
               <p>In fine, the Juda goat reſembles ours in moſt parts, except in
ſize, it being much ſmaller. This animal is common in Guinea, Angola, and
all along the coaſts of Africa: it is not much larger than a hare, but it is
extremely fat, and its fleſh admirably taſted. It is in that country
univerſally preferred to mutton.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals ſeem all of one kind, with very 
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0823800103:72"/> trifling diſtinctions between them. It is true that they
differ in ſome reſpects; ſuch as having neither the ſame colour, hair,
ears, or horns. But it ought to be conſidered as a rule in natural hiſtory,
that neither the horns, the colour, the fineneſs or the length of the hair,
or the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the ears, are to be conſidered as mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an actual
diſtinction in the kinds. Theſe are accidental varieties, produced by
climate and food, which are known to change even in the ſame animal, and give
it a ſeeming dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of form. When we ſee the ſhapes, the
inclinations, and the internal conformation of ſeemingly different creatures
nearly the ſame; and, above all, when we ſee them producing among each
other, we then have no heſitation in pronouncing the ſpecies, and
aſſerting that theſe are of the goat kind, with which they are ſo
materially connected.</p>
               <p>But, although theſe are evidently known to belong to the goat
kind, there are others nearly reſembling the goat, of whoſe kindred we
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be equally certain. Theſe are ſuch as, being found in a ſtate of
nature, have not as yet been ſufficiently ſubjected to human obſervation.
Hence it is impoſſible to determine with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion to which claſs they
belong; whether they be animals of a particular kind, or merely the 
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0823800103:73"/> goat in its ſtate of ſavage freedom. Were there but
one of theſe wild animals, the enquiry would ſoon be ended; and we might
readily allow it for the parent ſtock; but, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, there
are two kinds that have almoſt equal pretenſions to this honour; and the
claims of which it has been found difficult to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. The animals in
queſtion are the ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moy and the ibex. Theſe both bear very near
approaches to the goat in figure; have horns that never ſhed; and, at the
ſame time, are more different from each other than from the animal in
queſtion. From which of theſe two ſources our domeſtic goat is derived
is not eaſy to ſettle. Inſtead, therefore, of entering into the
diſcuſſion, I will content myſelf with the reſult of Mr. Buffon's
enquiries. He is of opinion that the ibex is the principal ſource, that our
domeſtic goat is the immediate deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and that the ſhammoy is but a
variety from that ſtock, a ſort of collateral branch of the ſame family.
His principal reaſon for giving the preference to the ibex is its having a
more maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine figure, large horns, and a large beard; whereas the ſhammoy
wants theſe marks of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive ſtrength and wildneſs. He ſuppoſes,
therefore, in their original ſavage ſtate, that our goat has taken after
the male of the parent <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0823800103:74"/> ſtock, and the ſhammoy after
the female; and that this has produced a variety in theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, even
before they underwent human cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation.</p>
               <p>However this be, the two animals in queſtion ſeem both well
fitted for their precarious life, being extremely ſwift, and capable of
running with eaſe along the ledges of precipices, where even the wolf or the
fox, though inſtigated by hunger, dares not purſue them. They are both
natives of the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the mountains of Greece; there they
propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate in vaſt numbers, and continue to exiſt in ſpite of the hunter
and every beaſt of prey that is found inceſſantly to purſue them.</p>
               <p>The ibex reſembles the goat in the ſhape of its body; but
differs in the horns, which are much larger. They are bent backward, full of
knots; and it is generally aſſerted that there is a knot added every year.
There are ſome of theſe found, if we may believe Bellonius, at leaſt two
yards long. The ibex has a large black beard, is of a brown colour, with a
thick warm coat of hair. There is a ſtreak of black runs along the top of the
back; and the belly and back of the thighs are of a fawn colour.</p>
               <p>The ſhammoy<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>M. Peroud's Account,
as quoted by Buffon.</bibl>
                  </note>, though a wild animal, is very eaſily
tamed, and docile; and to be found <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0823800103:75"/> only in rocky and
mountainous places. It is about the ſize of a domeſtic goat, and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles one in many reſpects. It is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably lively, and active
beyond expreſſion. The ſhammoy's hair is ſhort, like that of the doe;
in ſpring it is of an aſh colour, and in autumn a dun colour, inclining to
black, and in winter of a blackiſh brown. This animal is found in great
plenty in the mountains of Dauphiny of Piedmont, Savoy, Switzerland, and
Germany. They are peaceful, gentle creatures, and live in ſociety with each
other. They are found in flocks of from four to fourſcore, and even an
hundred, diſperſed upon the crags of the mountains. The large males are
ſeen feeding detached from the reſt, except in rutting time, when they
approach the females, and drive away the young. The time of their coupling is
from the beginning of November to the end of October; and they bring forth in
April and March. The young keeps with the dam for about five months, and
ſometimes longer, if the hunters and the wolves do not ſeparate them. It is
aſſerted that they live between twenty and thirty years. Their fleſh is
good to eat; and they are found to have ten or twelve pounds of ſuet, which
far ſurpaſſes that of the goat in hardneſs and goodneſs. The 
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0823800103:76"/> ſhammoy has ſcarce any cry, as moſt animals are
known to have; if it has any, it is a kind of feeble bleat, by which the parent
calls its young. But in caſes of danger, and when it is to warn the reſt of
the flock, it uſes an hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing noiſe, which is heard at a great
diſtance. For it is to be obſerved that this creature is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
vigilant, and has an eye the quickeſt and moſt piercing in nature. Its
ſmell alſo is not leſs diſtinguiſhing. When it ſees its enemy
diſtinctly, it ſtops for a moment; and then, if the perſon be near, in an
inſtant after it flies off. In the ſame manner, by its ſmell, it can
diſcover a man at half a league diſtance, and gives the earlieſt notice.
Upon any alarm, therefore, or any apprehenſions of danger, the ſhammoy
begins his hiſſing note with ſuch force, that the rocks and the foreſts
re-echo to the ſound. The firſt hiſs continues as long as the time of one
inſpiration. In the beginning it is very ſharp, and deeper towards the
cloſe. The animal having, after this firſt alarm, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a moment,
again looks round, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the reality of its fears, continues to
hiſs by intervals, until it has ſpread the alarm to a very great
diſtance. During this time, it ſeems in the moſt violent agitation; it
ſtrikes the ground with its fore-foot, and ſometimes with 
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0823800103:77"/> both: it bounds from rock to rock; it turns and looks
round; it runs to the edge of the precipice; and, ſtill perceiving the enemy,
flies with all its ſpeed. The hiſſing of the male is much louder and
ſharper than that of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; it is performed through the noſe; and is
properly no more than a very ſtrong breath, driven violently through a
ſmall apperture. The ſhammoy feeds upon the beſt herbage, and chuſes
the moſt delicate parts of the plants, the flower and the tender buds. It is
not leſs delicate with regard to ſeveral aromatic herbs, which grow upon
the ſides of the mountains. It drinks but very little while it feeds upon the
ſucculent herbage, and chews the cud in the intervals of feeding. This animal
is greatly admired for the beauty of its eyes, which are round and ſparkling,
and which mark the warmth of its conſtitution. Its head is furniſhed with
two ſmall horns, of about half a foot long, of a beautiful black, and
riſing from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, almoſt betwixt the eyes. Theſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to
what they are found in other animals, inſtead of going backwards or
ſideways, jet out forward, and bend a little, at their extremities, backward,
in a ſmall circle, and end in a very ſharp point. The ears are placed in a
very elegant manner, near the horns; and there are <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0823800103:78"/> two
ſtripes of black on each ſide of the face, the reſt being of a whitiſh
yellow, which never changes. The horn of this animal is often uſed as the
head of a cane. Thoſe of the female are leſs, and not ſo much bent; and
ſome farriers are ſeen to bleed cattle with them. Theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are ſo
much incommoded by heat, that they are never found in ſummer, except in the
caverns of rocks, amidſt fragments of unmelted ice, under the ſhade of high
and ſpreading trees, or of rough and hanging precipices, that face the north,
and which keep off entirely the rays of the ſun. They go to paſture both
morning and evening, and ſeldom during the heat of the day. They run along
the rocks with great eaſe and ſeeming indifference, and leap from one to
another, ſo that no dogs are able to purſue them. There is nothing more
extraordinary than to ſee them climbing and deſcending precipices, that to
all other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupedes are inacceſſible. They always mount or deſcend in
an oblique direction; and throw themſelves down a rock of thirty feet, and
light with great ſecurity upon ſome excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, or fragment, on the
ſide of the precipice, which is juſt large enough to place their feet upon;
they ſtrike the rock, however, in their deſcent, with their feet, three or
four times, <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0823800103:79"/> to ſtop the velocity of their motion; and,
when they have got upon their baſe below, they at once ſeem fixed and
ſecure. In fact, to ſee them jump in this manner, they ſeem rather to
have wings than legs; ſome, indeed, pretend to ſay that they uſe their
horns for climbing, but this wants confirmation. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that their legs
alone are formed for this arduous employment, the hinder being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther longer
than the former, and bending in ſuch a manner that, when they deſcend upon
them, they break the force of the fall. It is alſo aſſerted, that when
they feed, one of them always ſtands as centinel; but how far this may be
true is queſtionable. For certain, while they feed, there are ſome of them
that keep continually gazing round the reſt; but this is practiſed among
all gregarious animals; ſo that when they ſee any danger, they warn the
reſt of the herd of its approach. During the rigours of winter, the ſhammoy
ſleeps in the thicker foreſts, and feeds upon the ſhrubs and the buds of
the pine-tree. It ſometimes turns up the ſnow with its foot to look for
herbage; and, where it is green, makes a delicious repaſt. The more craggy
and uneven the foreſt, the more this animal is pleaſed with the abode,
which thus adds to its ſecurity. The hunting the <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0823800103:80"/>
ſhammoy is very laborious and extremely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult. The moſt uſual way is
to hide behind the clefts of the rocks and ſhoot them. This, however, muſt
be done with great precaution; the ſportſman muſt creep for a vaſt way
upon his belly, in ſilence, and take alſo the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the wind, which
if it blow from him they would inſtantly perceive. When arrived at a proper
diſtance, he then advances his piece, which is to be rifle barrelled, and to
carry one ball, and tries his fortune among them. Some alſo purſue this
animal as they do the ſtag, by placing proper perſons at all the
paſſages of a glade, or valley, and then ſending in others to rouſe the
game. Dogs are quite uſeleſs in this chace, as they rather alarm than
overtake. Nor is it without danger even to the men; for it often happens that
when the animal finds it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf over-preſſed, it drives at the hunter with
its head, and often tumbles him down the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring precipice. This animal
cannot go upon ice when ſmooth; but if there be the leaſt inequalities on
its ſurface, it then bounds along in ſecurity, and quickly evades all
purſuit.</p>
               <p>The ſkin of the ſhammoy was once famous, when tanned, for its
ſoftneſs and warmth; at preſent, however, ſince the art of tanning has
been brought to greater perfection, the leather <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0823800103:81"/> called
ſhammoy is made alſo from thoſe of the tame goat, the ſheep, and the
deer. Many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal virtues alſo were ſaid to reſide in the blood, fat,
gall, and the concretion ſometimes found in the ſtomach of this animal,
called the German bezoar. The fat, mixed with milk, was ſaid to be good in
ulcers of the lungs. The gall was ſaid to be uſeful in ſtrengthening the
ſight; the ſtone, which is generally about the ſize of a walnut and
blackiſh, was formerly in great requeſt for having the ſame virtues with
oriental bezoar. However, in the preſent enlightened ſtate of phyſic, all
theſe medicines are quite out of repute; and, although we have the names of
ſeveral medicines procurable from quadrupedes, yet, except the muſk or
harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn alone, I know of none in any degree of reputation. It is true, the
fat, the urine, the beak, and even the dung, of various animals, may be found
efficacious where better remedies are not to be had; but they are far
ſurpaſſed by by many at preſent in uſe, whoſe operations we know,
and whoſe virtues are confirmed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated experience.</p>
               <p>Such are the quadrupedes that more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly belong to the goat
kind. Each of theſe, in all probability, can engender and breed with the
other; and were the whole race extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0823800103:82"/> except any
two, theſe would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to repleniſh the world, and continue the
kind. Nature, however, proceeds in her va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations by ſlow and inſenſible
degrees, and ſcarce draws a firm diſtinguiſhed line between any two
neighbouring races of animals what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Thus it is hard to diſcover
where the ſheep ends and the goat begins; and we ſhall find it ſtill
harder to fix preciſely the boundaries between the goat kind and the deer. In
all tranſitions from one kind to the other, there are to be found a middle
race of animals, that ſeem to partake of the nature of both, and that can
preciſely be referred to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That race of quadrupedes, called the
Gazelles, are of this kind; they are properly neither goat nor deer, and yet
they have many of the marks of both; they make the ſhade between theſe two
kinds, and fill up the chaſm in nature.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>THE GAZELLES.</head>
               <p>THE Gazelles, of which there are ſeveral kinds, can, with
propriety, be referred neither to the goat or the deer; and yet they partake of
both natures. Like the goat, they have hollow horns that never fall, which is
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the deer. They have a gall-bladder, <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0823800103:83"/> which
is found in the goat and not in the deer; and, like that animal, they feed
rather upon ſhrubs than graſſy paſtures. On the other hand, they
reſemble the roe-buck in ſize and delicacy of form; they have deep pits
under the eyes like that animal; they reſemble the roe-buck in the colour and
nature of their hair; they reſemble him in the bunches upon their legs, which
only differ in being upon the fore-legs in theſe, and on the hind legs in the
other. They ſeem, therefore, to be of a middle nature between theſe two
kinds; or, to ſpeak with greater truth and preciſion, they form a
diſtinct kind by themſelves.</p>
               <p>The diſtinguiſhing marks of this tribe of animals, by which
they differ both from the goat and deer, are theſe: their horns are made
differently, being annulated or ringed round, at the ſame time that there are
longitudinated de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions running from the bottom to the point. They have
bunches of hair upon their fore-legs; they have a ſtreak of black, red, or
brown, running along the lower part of their ſides, and three ſtreaks of
whitiſh hair in the internal ſide of the ear. Theſe are characters that
none of them are without; beſides theſe, there are others which, in
general, they are found to have, and which are more obvious to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder. 
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0823800103:84"/> Of all animals in the world, the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelle has the moſt
beautiful eye, extremely brilliant, and yet ſo meek that all the eaſtern
poets compare the eyes of their miſtreſſes to thoſe of this animal. A
gazelle-eyed beauty is conſidered as the higheſt cmpliment that a lover can
pay; and, indeed, the Greeks themſelves thought it no inelegant piece of
flattery to reſemble the eyes of a beautiful wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to thoſe of a cow. The
gazelle, for the moſt part, is more delicately and finely limbed than even
the roe-buck; its hair is as ſhort, but finer and more gloſſy. Its hinder
legs are longer than thoſe before, as in the hare, which gives it greater
ſecurity in aſcending or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending ſteep places. Their ſwiftneſs
is equal, if not ſuperior to that of the roe; but as the latter bounds
forward, ſo theſe run along in an even uninterrupted courſe. Moſt of
them are brown upon the back, white under the belly, with a black ſtripe,
ſeparating theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours between. Their tail is of various lengths, but in
all covered with pretty long hair; and their ears are beautiful, well placed,
and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating in a point. They all have a cloven hoof, like the ſheep;
they all have permanent horns; and the female has them ſmaller than the
male.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0823800103:85"/>Of theſe animals, Mr. Buffon makes twelve
varieties; which, however, is much fewer than what other naturaliſts have
made them. The firſt is the Gazella, properly ſo called, which is of the
ſize of the roe-buck, and very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling it in all the proportions
of its body, but entirely differing, as was ſaid, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and
faſhion of the horns, which are black and hollow, like thoſe of the ram, or
the goat, and never fall. The ſecond he calls the Kevel, which is rather
leſs than the former; its eyes alſo ſeem larger; and its horns, inſtead
of being round, are flatted on the ſides, as well in the male as the female.
The third he calls the Corin, which very much reſembles the two former, but
that it is ſtill leſs than either. Its horns alſo are ſmaller in
proportion, ſmoother than thoſe of the other two, and the annular
prominences belonging to the kind are ſcarce diſcernable, and may rather be
called wrinkles than prominences. Some of theſe animals are often ſeen
ſtreaked like the tiger. Theſe three are ſuppoſed to be of the ſame
ſpecies. The fourth he calls the Zeiran, the horns only of which he has
ſeen; which, from their ſize, and the deſcription of travellers, he
ſuppoſes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a larger kind of the gazelle, found in India and
Perſia, under that denomination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0823800103:86"/>The fifth he calls the Koba, and the ſixth
the kob; theſe two differ from each other only in ſize, the former being
much larger than the latter. The muzzle of theſe animals is much longer than
thoſe of the ordinary gazelle; the head is differently ſhaped, and they
have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions under the eyes. The ſeventh he calls after its
Egyptian name, the Algazel; which is ſhaped pretty much like the ordinary
gazelle, except that the horns are much longer, being generally three feet from
the point to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion; whereas, in the common gazelle, they are not
above a foot; they are ſmaller alſo, and ſtraiter, till near the
extremities, when they turn ſhort, with a very ſharp flexure: they are
black and ſmooth, and the annular prominences are ſcarcely obſervable.
The eighth is called the Pazan; or, by ſome, the bezoar goat, which greatly
reſembles the former, except a ſmall variety in their horns; and alſo
with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that as the algazel feeds upon the plains, this is only
found in the mountains. They are both inhabitants of the ſame countries and
climate; being found in Egypt, Arabia, and Perſia. This laſt is the animal
famous for that concretion in the inteſtines or ſtomach, called the
Oriental Bezoar, which was once in ſuch repute all over the world for its
medicinal <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0823800103:87"/> virtues. The word bezoar is ſuppoſed to take
its name either from the pazan or pazar, which is the animal that produces it;
or from a word in the Arabic language, which ſignifies antidote, or
counter-poiſon. It is a ſtone of a glazed blackiſh colour, found in the
ſtomach, or the inteſtines of ſome animal, and brought over to us from
the Eaſt-Indies. Like all other animal concretions, it is found to have a
kind of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleous, or hard ſubſtance within, upon which the external
coatings were formed; for, upon being ſawed through, it is ſeen to have
layer over layer, as in an onion. This nucleus is of various kinds; ſometimes
the buds of a ſhrub, ſometimes a piece of ſtone, and ſometimes a
marcaſite. This ſtone is from the ſize of an acorn to that of a pidgeon's
egg; the larger the ſtone, the more valuable it is held; its price
encreaſing, like that of a diamond. There was a time when a ſtone of four
ounces ſold in Europe for above two hundred pounds; but, at preſent, the
price is greatly fallen, and they are in very little eſteem. The bezoar is of
va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious colours; ſometimes of a blood colour, ſometimes of a pale yellow,
and of all the ſhades between theſe two. It is generally gloſſy,
ſmooth, and has a fragrant ſmell, like that of ambergreaſe, probably
ariſing from the aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0823800103:88"/> vegetables upon which the
animal that produces it, feeds. It has been given in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigoes, epilepſies,
palpitations of the heart, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, jaundice, and, in thoſe places where the
dearneſs, and not the value of medicines, is conſulted, in almoſt every
diſorder incident to man. In all, perhaps, it is equally efficacious, acting
only as an abſorbent powder, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing virtues equal to common
chalk, or crabs claws. Judicious phyſicians have therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded it;
and this celebrated medicine is now chiefly conſumed in countries where the
know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of nature has been but little advanced. When this medicine was in
its higheſt repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, many arts were uſed to adulterate it; and many
countries endeavoured to find out a bezoar of their own. Thus we had occidental
bezoar, brought from America; German be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar, which has been mentioned before;
cow bezoar, and monkey bezoar. In fact, there is ſcarce an animal, except of
the carnivorous kinds, that does not produce ſome of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions in
the ſtomach, inteſtines, kidnies, bladder, and even in the heart. To
theſe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance may impute virtues that they do not poſſeſs;
experience has found but few cures wrought by their efficacy: but it is well
known, that they often prove fatal to the animal that <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0823800103:89"/>
bears them. Theſe concretions are generally found in cows, by their practice
of licking off their hair, which gathers in the ſtomach into the ſhape of a
ball, acquires a ſurprizing degree of hardneſs, and ſometimes a poliſh
like leather. They are often as large as a gooſe-egg; and, when become too
large to paſs, block up the paſſage of the food, and the animal dies. The
ſubſtance of theſe balls, however, is different from the bezoar mentioned
above; being rather a concretion of hair than of ſtone. There is a bezoar
found in the gall-bladder of a boar, and thence called hog bezoar, in very
great eſteem; but perhaps with as little juſtice as any of the former. In
ſhort, there is ſcarce an animal, or ſcarce a part of their bodies, in
which concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not formed; and it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, as Mr. Buffon
juſtly remarks, that the bezoar ſo much in uſe formerly, was not the
production of the pazar, or any one animal only, but that of the whole gazelle
kind; who feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon odoriferous herbs and plants, gave this admirable
fragrance to the accidental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions which they were found to produce. As
this medicine, however, is but little uſed at preſent, our curioſity is
much abated, as to the cauſe of its formation. To return, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the
varieties in the gazelle tribe, the <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0823800103:90"/> ninth is called the
Ranguer, and is a native of Senegal. This differs ſomewhat in ſhape and
colour from the reſt; but particularly in the ſhape of its horns, which are
ſtrait to near the points, where they crook forward, pretty much in the
ſame manner as in the ſhammoy they crook backward. The tenth variety of the
gazelle is the Antelope, ſo well known to the Engliſh, who have given it
the name. This animal is of the ſize of a roe-buck, and reſembles the
gazelle in many particulars, but differs in others: it has deeper eye-pits than
the former; the horns are formed differently alſo, being about ſixteen
inches long, almoſt touching each other at the bottom, and ſpreading as
they riſe, ſo as at their tips to be ſixteen inches aſunder. They have
the annular prominences of their kind, but not ſo diſtinguiſhable as in
the gazelle: however, they have a double flexure, which is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
and ſerves to diſtinguiſh them from all others of their kind. At the root
they have a tuft of hair, which is longer than that of any part of the body.
Like others of the ſame kind, the antelope is brown on the back, and white
under the belly; but theſe colours are not ſeparated by the black ſtreak
which is to be found in all the reſt of the gazelle kinds. There are
different ſorts of this animal, ſome <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0823800103:91"/> with larger horns
than others, and others with leſs. The one which makes the eleventh va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
in the gazelle kind, Mr. Buffon calls the Lidme, which has very large horns;
and the other, which is the twelfth and laſt, he calls the Indian Antelope,
the horns of which are very ſmall.</p>
               <p>To theſe may be added three or four varieties more, which it is
not eaſy to tell whether to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the goat or the gazelle, as they
equally reſemble both. The firſt of theſe is the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus, an animal that
ſeems to partake of the mixed natures of the cow, the goat, and the deer. It
reſembles the ſtag in the ſize and the figure of its body, and
particularly in the ſhape of its legs. But it has permanent horns, like the
goat; and made entirely like thoſe of the gazelle kind. It alſo reſembles
that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal in its way of living: however, it differs in the make of its head,
being exactly like the cow in the length of its muzzle, and in the
diſpoſition of the bones of its ſcull; from which ſimilitude it has
taken its name. This animal has a narrow long head; the eyes are placed very
high; the forehead ſhort and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; the horns permanent, about a foot long,
black, thick, annulated, and the rings of the gazelle kind, remarkably large;
its ſhoulders <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0823800103:92"/> are very high, and it has a kind of bunch
on them, that terminates at the neck; the tail is about a foot long, and tufted
with hair at the extremity. The hair of this animal is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in being
thicker at the middle than at the root: in all other quadrupedes, except the
elk and this, the hair tapers off from the bottom to the point; but in theſe,
each hair ſeems to ſwell in the middle, like a nine-pin. The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus
alſo reſembles the elk in ſize, and the colour of its ſkin; but theſe
are the only ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes between them: as the one has a very large branching
head of ſolid horns that are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually deciduous, the other has black
unbranch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hollow horns that never fall. The bubalus is common enough in
Barbary, and has often been called by the name of the Barbary Cow, from which
animal it differs ſo widely. It par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes pretty much of the nature of the
antelope; like that having the hair ſhort, the hide black, the ears pointed,
and the fleſh good for food.</p>
               <p>The ſecond anomalous animal of the goat-kind, Mr. Buffon calls
the Condoma. It is ſuppoſed to be equal in ſize to the largeſt ſtag,
but with hollow horns, like thoſe of the goat kind, and with varied flexures,
like thoſe of the antelope. They are above three feet long; and, at their
extremities, about two feet <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0823800103:93"/> aſunder. All along the back
there runs a white liſt, which ends at the inſertion of the tail; another
of the ſame colour croſſes this, at the bottom of the neck, which it
entirely ſurrounds: there are two more of the ſame kind running round the
body, one behind the fore legs, and the other running parallel to it before the
hinder. The colour of the reſt of the body is greyiſh, except the belly,
which is white: it has alſo a long grey beard; and its legs, though long, are
well proportioned.</p>
               <p>The third that may be mentioned, he calls the Guiba. It
reſembles the gazelles in every particular, except in the colour of the
belly, which, as we have ſeen, is white in them, but in this is of a deep
brown. Its horns alſo are not marked with annular prominences, but are
ſmooth and poliſhed. It is alſo remarkable for white liſts, on a brown
ground, that are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed along the animal's body, as if it were covered
with a harneſs. Like the former, it is a native of Africa.</p>
               <p>The African Wild Goat of Grimmius is the fourth. It is of a dark
aſh colour; and in the middle of the head is an hairy tuft, ſtanding
upright; on both ſides, between the eyes and the noſe, there are very deep
cavities, greater than thoſe of the other kinds, which contain a 
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0823800103:94"/> yellow oily liquor, which coagulates into a black
ſubſtance, that has a ſmell between muſk and civet. This being taken
away, the liquor again runs out, and coagulates, as before. Theſe cavities
have no communication with the eyes, and, conſequently, this oozing
ſubſtance can have nothing of the nature of tears.</p>
               <p>To this we may add the Chevrotin, or little Guinea Deer, which is
the leaſt of all cloven footed quadrupedes, and perhaps the moſt beautiful;
its legs, at the ſmalleſt part, are not much thicker than the ſhank of a
tobacco-pipe; it is about ſeven inches high, and about twelve from the point
of the noſe to the inſertion of the tail. It is the moſt delicately
ſhaped animal in the world, being completely formed like a ſtag in
miniature; except that its horns, when it has any, are more of the gazelle
kind, being hollow and annulated in the ſame manner. It has two canine teeth
in the upper jaw; in which reſpect it differs from all other animals of the
goat or deer kind, and thus makes a ſpecies entirely diſtinct by itſelf.
This wonderful animal's colour is not leſs pleaſing; the hair, which is
ſhort and gloſſy, being in ſome of a beautiful yellow, except on the
neck and belly, which is white. They are natives of India, Guinea, and the warm
climates between the tropics; <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0823800103:95"/> and are found in great
plenty. But though they are amazingly ſwift for their ſize, yet the Negroes
often overtake them in the purſuit, and knock them down with their ſticks.
They may be eaſily tamed, and then they become familiar and pleaſing; but
they are of ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate conſtitutions, that they can bear no cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
but the hotteſt; and they always periſh with the rigours of ours, when they
are brought over. The male in Guinea has horns; the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male is without any; as
are all the kinds of this animal, to be found either in Java or Ceylon, where
they chiefly abound.</p>
               <p>Such is the liſt of the gazelles; all which pretty nearly
reſemble the deer in form, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of ſhape; but have the horns
hollow, ſingle, and permanent, like thoſe of the goat. They properly fill
up, as has been already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the interval between theſe two kinds of
animals; ſo that it is difficult to tell where the goat ends, and the deer
may be ſaid to begin. If we compare the gazelles with each other, we ſhall
find but very ſlight diſtinctions between them. The turn or the magnitude
of the horns, the different ſpots on the ſkin, or a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of ſize
in each, are chiefly the marks by which their varieties are to be known; but
their <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0823800103:96"/> way of living, their nature, and their peculiar
ſwiftneſs, all come under one deſcription.</p>
               <p>The gazelles are, in general, inhabitants of the warmer climates;
and contribute, among other embelliſhments, to add beauty to thoſe
foreſts that are for ever green. They are often ſeen feeding in herds, on
the ſides of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or in the ſhade of the woods; and fly all
together, upon the ſmalleſt approaches of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. They bound with ſuch
ſwiftneſs, and are ſo very ſhy, that dogs or men vainly attempt to
purſue them. They traverſe thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices with eaſe and ſafety,
which to every quadrupede elſe are quite impracticable; nor can any animals,
but of the winged kind, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them. Accordingly, in all thoſe countries
where they are chiefly found, they are purſued by falcons; and this admirable
manner of hunting makes one of the principal amuſements of the upper ranks of
people all over the eaſt.</p>
               <p>The Arabians, Perſians, and Turks, breed up for this purpoſe,
that kind of hawk called the Falcon Gentle, with which, when properly trained,
they go forth on horſeback among the foreſts and the mountains, the falcon
perching upon the hand of the hunter. Their expedition is conducted with
profound ſilence; their dogs are taught to hang behind; while the men, on 
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0823800103:97"/> the fleeteſt courſers, look round for the game.
Whenever they ſpy a gazelle at the proper diſtance, they point the falcon
to its object, and encourage it to purſue. The falcon, with the ſwiftneſs
of an arrow, flies to the animal; that, knowing its danger, endeavours, but too
late, to eſcape. The falcon ſoon coming up with its prey, fixes its talons,
one into the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal's cheek, the other into its throat, and deeply wounds it.
On the other hand, the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelle attempts to eſcape, but is generally wounded
too deeply to run far. The falcon clings with the utmoſt perſeverance, nor
ever leaves its prey till it falls; upon which the hunters from behind
approaching, take up both, and reward the falcon with the blood of the ſpoil.
They alſo teach the young ones, by applying them to the dead animal's throat,
and accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them betimes to fix upon that particular part; for if it
ſhould happen that the falcon fixed upon any other part of the gazelle,
either its back or its haunches, the animal would eaſily eſcape among the
mountains, and the hunter would alſo loſe his falcon.</p>
               <p>They ſometimes alſo hunt theſe animals with the ounce. This
carnivorous and fierce crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being made tame and domeſtic, generally 
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0823800103:98"/> ſits on horſeback behind the hunter, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
there with the utmoſt compoſure, until the gazelle is ſhewn; it is then
that it exerts all its arts and fierceneſs; it does not at once fly at its
prey, but approaches ſlyly, turning and winding about until it comes within
the proper diſtance, when all at once it bounds upon the heedleſs animal,
and inſtantly kills it, and ſucks its blood. If, on the other hand, it
miſſes its aim, it reſts in the place, without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to purſue
any farther, but ſeems aſhamed of its own inability.</p>
               <p>There is ſtill another way of taking the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelle, which ſeems
not ſo certain, nor ſo amuſing as either of the former. A tame gazelle is
bred up for this purpoſe, who is taught to join thoſe of its kind, wherever
it perceives them. When the hunter, therefore, perceives a herd of theſe
together, he fixes a nooſe round the horns of the tame gazelle, in ſuch a
manner, that if the reſt but touch it, they are entangled; and thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
he ſends his gazelle among the reſt. The tame animal no ſooner
approaches, but the males of the herd inſtantly ſally forth to oppoſe
him; and, in butting with their horns, are caught in the nooſe. In this, both
ſtruggling for ſome time, fall together to the ground; and, 
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0823800103:99"/> at laſt, the hunter coming up, diſengages the one, and
kills the other. Upon the whole, however, theſe animals, whatever be the arts
uſed to purſue them, are very difficult to be taken. As they are
continually ſubject to alarms from carnivorous beaſts, or from man, they
keep chiefly in the moſt ſolitary and inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible places, and find
their only protection from ſituations of the greateſt danger.</p>

            <p>THE more we ſearch into nature, the more we ſhall find how
little ſhe is known; and we ſhall more than once have occaſion to find,
that protracted enquiry is more apt to teach us mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, than to produce
information. Although the number and nature of quadrupedes at firſt glance
ſeems very little known; yet, when we come to examine cloſer, we find
ſome with which we are very partially acquainted, and others that are utterly
unknown. There is ſcarce a cabinet of the curious but what has the ſpoils
of animals, or the horns or the hoofs of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupedes, which do not come within
former deſcriptions. There is ſcarce a perſon whoſe trade is to dreſs
or improve furs, but knows ſeveral creatures by their ſkins, which no
naturaliſt has hitherto had notice of. But of all quadrupedes, there is none
ſo juſtly the reproach of natural hiſtorians, as that which bears the
muſk. This perfume, ſo well known to the elegant, and ſo very uſeful in
the hands of the phyſician, a medicine that has for more than a century been
imported from the eaſt in great quantities, and during all that time has 
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0823800103:101"/> been improving in its reputation, is, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
ſo very little underſtood, that it remains a doubt whether the animal that
produces it be an hog, an ox, a goat, or a deer. When an animal with which we
are ſo nearly connected, is ſo utterly unknown, how little muſt we know
of many that are more remote and unſerviceable! Yet naturaliſts proceed in
the ſame train, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging their catalogues and their names, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
endeavouring to find out the nature, and fix the preciſe hiſtory of thoſe
with which we are very partially acquainted. It is the ſpirit of the
ſcholars of the preſent age, to be fonder of encreaſing the bulk of our
knowledge than its utility; of extending their conqueſts than of improving
their empire.</p>
            <p>The muſk which comes to Europe, is brought over in ſmall bags,
about the ſize of a pidgeon's egg, which, when cut open, appear to contain a
kind of duſky reddiſh ſubſtance, like coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated blood, and which, in
large quantities, has a very ſtrong ſmell; but when mixed and diffuſed,
becomes a very agreeable perfume. Indeed, no ſubſtance now known in the
world has a ſtronger or a more permanent ſmell. A grain of muſk perfumes
a whole room; and its odour continues for ſome days, without dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution. But
in a larger quantity it continues <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0823800103:102"/> for years together; and
ſeems ſcarce waſted in its weight, although it has filled the
atmoſphere to a great diſtance with its parts. It is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly uſed
in medicine, in nervous and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteric diſorders; and is found, in ſuch
caſes, to be the moſt powerful remedy now in uſe: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the animal
that furniſhes this admirable medicine, has been very variouſly
deſcribed, and is known but very imperfectly.</p>
            <p>The deſcription given of this animal by Grew, is as follows. The
Muſk animal is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly neither of the goat nor deer kind, for it has no
horns, and it is uncertain whether it ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates or not; however, it wants the
fore teeth in the upper jaw, in the ſame manner as in ruminating animals;
but, at the ſame time, it has tuſks like thoſe of a hog. It is three feet
ſix inches in length, from the head to the tail; and the head is above half a
foot long. The fore part of the head is like that of a grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound; and the ears
are three inches long, and erect, like thoſe of a rabbit; but the tail is not
above two inches. It is cloven footed, like beaſts of the goat kind; the hair
on the head and legs is half an inch long, on the belly an inch and an half,
and on the back and buttocks three inches; and proportionably thicker than in
any other animal. It is brown and white <pb facs="tcp:0823800103:103"/> 
               <figure>

               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0823800103:104"/>alternately, from the root to the
point; on the head and thighs it is brown, but under the belly and tail white,
and a little curled, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the back and belly. On each ſide of the
lower jaw, under the corners of the mouth, there is a tuft of thick hair, which
is ſhort and hard, and about three quarters of an inch long. The hair, in
general, of this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, is remarkable for its ſoftneſs and fine tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but what diſtinguiſhes it particularly are the tuſks, which are an inch
and an half long, and turn back in the form of an hook; and more particularly
the bag which contains the muſk, which is three inches long, two broad, and
ſtands out from the belly an inch and an half. It is a very fearful animal,
and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it has long ears; and the ſenſe of hearing is ſo quick,
that it can diſcover an enemy at a great diſtance.</p>
            <p>After ſo long and circumſtantial a deſcription of this animal,
its nature is but very little known; nor has any anatomiſt as yet examined
its internal ſtructure; or been able to inform us whether it be a ruminant
animal, or one of the hog kind; how the muſk is formed, or whether thoſe
bags in which it comes to us be really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the animal, or are only
the ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the venders. Indeed, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider

               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0823800103:107"/> the immenſe quantities of this ſubſtance which are
conſumed in Europe alone, not to mention the eaſt, where it is in ſtill
greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute than here, we can hardly ſuppoſe that any one animal can
furniſh the ſupply; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly when it muſt be killed before the
bag can be obtained. We are told, it is true, that the muſk is often
depoſited by the animal upon trees and ſtones, againſt which it rubs
itſelf when the quantity becomes uneaſy; but it is not in that form which
we receive it, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in what ſeems to be its own natural blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Of
theſe, Taverner brought home near two thouſand in one year; and as the
animal is wild, ſo many muſt, during that ſpace, have been hunted and
taken. But as the creature is repreſented very ſhy, and as it is found but
in ſome particular provinces of the eaſt, the wonder is how its bag
ſhould be ſo cheap, and furniſhed in ſuch great plenty. The bag in
common does not coſt (if I do not forget) above a crown by retail, and yet
this is ſuppoſed the only one belonging to the animal; and for the
obtaining of which, it muſt have been hunted and killed. The only way of
ſolving this difficulty, is to ſuppoſe that theſe bags are, in a great
meaſure, counterfeit, taken from ſome other animal, or from ſome part of
the ſame, <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0823800103:108"/> filled with its blood, and a very little of
the perfume, but enough to impregnate the reſt with a ſtrong and permanent
odour. It comes to us from different parts of the eaſt; from China, Tunquin,
Bengal, and often from Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy: that of Thibet is reckoned the beſt, and
ſells for fourteen ſhillings an ounce; that of Muſcovy the worſt, and
ſells but for three; the odour of this, though very ſtrong at firſt,
being quickly found to evaporate.</p>
            <p>Muſk was ſome years ago in the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt as a
perfume, and but little regarded as a medicine; but at preſent its reputation
is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally changed; and having been found of great benefit in phyſic, it is
but little regarded for the purpoſes of elegance. It is thus that things
which become neceſſary, ceaſe to continue pleaſing; and the
conſciouſneſs of their uſe, deſtroys their power of adminiſtering
delight.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. Animals of the Deer Kind.</head>
            <p>IF we compare the ſtag and the bull as to ſhape and form, no two
animals can be more unlike; and yet, if we examine their internal ſtructure,
we ſhall find a ſtriking ſimilitude between them. Indeed, their
differences, except to a nice ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, will ſcarcely be perceivable. All
of the deer kind want the gall-bladder; their kidneys are formed differently;
their ſpleen is alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably larger; their tail is ſhorter; and
their horns, which are ſolid, are renewed every year. Such are the ſlight
internal diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between two animals, one of which is among the
ſwifteſt, and the other the heavieſt of the brute creation.</p>
            <p>The Stag is one of thoſe innocent and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able animals that
ſeems made to embelliſh the foreſt, and animate the ſolitudes of
nature. The eaſy elegance of his form, the lightneſs of his motions,
thoſe large branches that ſeem made rather for the ornament of his head
than its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the ſize, the ſtrength and the ſwiftneſs of this
beautiful creature, all ſufficiently rank him among the firſt of
quadrupedes, among the moſt noted objects of human curioſity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0823800103:110"/>The Stag, or Hart, whoſe female is called a
<hi>hind,</hi> and the young a <hi>calf,</hi> differs in ſize and in horns
from a fallow-deer. He is much larger, and his horns are round; whereas in the
fallow kind they are broad and palmated. By theſe the animal's age is known.
The firſt year, the ſtag has no horns, but an horny excreſcence, which is
ſhort, rough, and covered with a thin hairy ſkin. The next year the horns
are ſingle and ſtraight; the third year they have two antlers, three the
fourth, four the fifth, and five the ſixth; this number is not always
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, for ſometimes there are more, and often leſs. When arrived at the
ſixth year, the ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers do not always encreaſe; and, although the number
may amount to ſix or ſeven on each ſide, yet the animal's age is then
eſtimated ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the ſize of the antlers and the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the
branch which ſuſtains them, than from their variety.</p>
            <p>Theſe horns, large as they ſeem, are, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ſhed
every year, and new ones come in their place. The old horns are of a firm
ſolid texture, and uſually employed in making handles for knives and other
domeſtic utenſils. But, while young, nothing can be more ſoft or tender;
and the animal, as if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of his own imbecility, at thoſe times,
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0823800103:111"/> upon ſhedding his former horns, retires
from the reſt of his fellows, and hides himſelf in ſolitudes and
thickets, never venturing out to paſture, except by night. During this time,
which moſt uſually happens in the ſpring, the new horns are very painful,
and have a quick ſenſibility of any external impreſſion. The flies
alſo are extremely troubleſome to him. When the old horn is fallen off, the
new does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin immediately to appear; but the bones of the ſkull are
ſeen covered only with a tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent perioſteum, or ſkin, which, as
anatomiſts teach us, covers the bones of all animals. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort time,
however, this ſkin begins to ſwell, and to form a ſoft tumour, which
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a great deal of blood, and which begins to be covered with a downy
ſubſtance that has the feel of velvet, and appears nearly of the ſame
colour with the reſt of the animal's hair. This tumour every day buds forward
from the point like the graft of a tree; and, riſing by degrees from the
head, ſhoots out the antlers on either ſide, ſo that in a few days, in
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the animal is in condition, the whole head is completed.
However, as was ſaid above, in the beginning, its conſiſtence is very
ſoft, and has a ſort of bark, which is no more than a continuation of the
integument of <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0823800103:112"/> the ſkull. It is velveted and downy, and
every where furniſhed with blood-veſſels, that ſupply the growing horns
with nouriſhment. As they creep along the ſides of the branches, the print
is marked over the whole ſurface; and the larger the blood-veſſels, the
deeper theſe marks are found to be; from hence ariſes the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of
the ſurface of the deer's horns; which, as we ſee, are furrowed all along
the ſides, the impreſſions diminiſhing towards the point, where the
ſubſtance is as ſmooth and as ſolid as ivory. But it ought to be
obſerved, that this ſubſtance, of which the horns is compoſed, begins
to harden at the bottom while the upper part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſoft and ſtill
continues growing; from whence it appears that the horns grow diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently in
deer from thoſe of ſheep or cows; in which they are always ſeen to
encreaſe from the bottom. However, when the whole head has received its full
growth, the extremities then begin to acquire their ſolidity; the velvet
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, or bark, with its blood-veſſels, dry up, and then begin to fall;
and this the animal haſtens, by rubbing its antlers againſt every tree it
meets. In this manner, the whole external ſurface being ſtripped off by
degrees, at length the whole head acquires its complete hardneſs,
expanſion, and beauty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0823800103:113"/>It would be a vain taſk to enquire into the
cauſe of the animal production of theſe horns; it is ſufficient to
obſerve, that if a ſtag is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated when its horns are fallen off, they
will never grow again; and, on the contrary, if the ſame operation is
performed when they are on, they will never fall off. If only one of his
teſticles are taken out, he will want the horn on that ſide; if one of the
teſticles only be tied up he will want the horn of the oppoſite ſide. The
encreaſe of their proviſion alſo tends to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the growth and the
expanſion of the horns; and Mr. Buffon thinks it poſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard
their growth entirely by greatly retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their food<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. xi. p. 113.</bibl>
               </note>. As a proof of this,
nothing can be more obvious than the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſtag bred in
fertile paſtures and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed by the hunter, and one often purſued
and ill nouriſhed. The former has his head expanded, his antlers numerous,
and the branches thick; the latter has but few antlers, the traces of the
blood-veſſels upon them are but ſlight, and the expanſion but little.
The beauty and ſize of their horns, therefore, mark their ſtrength and
their vigour; ſuch of them as are ſickly, or have been wounded, never
ſhooting out that magnificent profuſion ſo much <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0823800103:114"/>
admired in this animal. Thus the horns may, in every reſpect, be reſembled
to a vegetable ſubſtance, grafted upon the head of an animal. Like a
vegetable they grow from the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; like a vegetable they are for a
while co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a bark that nouriſhes them; like a vegetable they have
their annual production and decay; and a ſtrong imagination might ſuppoſe
that the leafy productions on which the animal feeds, go once more to vegetate
in his horns<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Buffon has ſuppoſed ſomething
like this. 
<bibl>Vid. Paſſim.</bibl>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>The ſtag is uſually a twelvemonth old before the horns begin to
appear, and then a ſingle branch is all that is ſeen for the year
enſuing. About the beginning of ſpring, all of this kind are ſeen to
ſhed their horns, which fall off of themſelves; though ſometimes the
animal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the efforts of nature, by rubbing them againſt a tree.
It ſeldom happens that the branches on both ſides fall off at the ſame
time, there often being two or three days between the dropping of the one and
the other. The old ſtags uſually ſhed their horns firſt; which
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally happens towards the latter end of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, or the beginning of
March. Thoſe of the ſecond head, (namely, ſuch as are between 
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0823800103:115"/> five and ſix years old) ſhed their horns about the
middle or latter end of March; thoſe ſtill younger, in the month of April;
and the youngeſt of all, not till the middle, or the latter end of May; they
generally ſhed them in pools of water, whither they retire from the heat; and
this has given riſe to the opinion of their always hiding their horns.
Theſe rules, though true in general, are yet ſubject to many varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and univerſally it is known that a ſevere winter retards the ſhedding of
the horns.</p>
            <p>The horns of the ſtag generally encreaſe in thickneſs and in
height from the ſecond year of its age to the eighth. In this ſtate of
perfection they continue during the vigour of life; but as the animal grows old
the horns feel the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of age, and ſhrink like the reſt of the
body. No branch bears more than twenty or twenty-two antlers even in the
higheſt ſtate of vigour; and the number is ſubject to great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety; for
it happens that the ſtag at one year has either leſs or more than the year
preceding, in proportion to the goodneſs of his paſture, or the continuance
of his ſecurity, as theſe animals ſeldom thrive when often rouzed by the
hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The horns are alſo found to partake of the nature of the ſoil; in
the more fertile pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures they are large and tender; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, 
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0823800103:116"/> in the barren ſoil they are hard, ſtunted, and
brittle.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the ſtags have ſhed their horns, they ſeparate
from each other, and ſeek the plainer parts of the country, remote from every
other animal, which they are utterly unable to oppoſe. They then walk with
their heads ſtooping down, to keep their horns from ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the
branches of the trees above. In this ſtate of imbecility they continue near
three months before their heads have acquired their full growth and ſolidity;
and then, by rubbing them againſt the branches of every thicket, they at
length clear them of the ſkin which had contributed to their growth and
nouriſhment. It is ſaid by ſome that the horn takes the colour of the
ſap of the tree againſt which it is rubbed; and that ſome thus become
red, when rubbed againſt the heath; and others brown, by rubbing againſt
the oak; this, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is a miſtake, ſince ſtags kept in parks where
there are no trees, have a variety in the colour of their horns, which can be
aſcribed to nothing but nature.</p>
            <p>A ſhort time after they have furniſhed their horns, they begin
to feel the impreſſions of the rut, or the deſire of copulation. The old
ones are the moſt forward; and about the end of <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0823800103:117"/>
Auguſt, or the beginning of September, they quit their thickets, and return
to the mountain in order to ſeek the hind to whom they call with a loud
tremulous note. At this time their neck is ſwolen; they appear bold and
furious; fly from country to country; ſtrike with their horns againſt the
trees and obſtacles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue reſtleſs and fierce until they have
found the female; who at firſt flies from them, but is at laſt compelled
and overtaken. When two ſtags contend for the ſame female, how timor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſoever they may appear at other times, they then ſeem agitated with an
uncommon degree of ardour. They paw up the earth, menace each other with their
horns, bellow with all their force, and ſtriking in a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate manner
againſt each other, ſeem deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon death or victory. This combat
continues till one of them is defeated or flies; and it often happens that the
victor is obliged to fight ſeveral of thoſe battles before it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
undiſputed maſter of the field. The old ones are generally the conquerors
upon theſe occaſions, as they have more ſtrength and greater courage; and
theſe alſo are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by the hind itſelf to the young ones, as the
latter are more feeble, and leſs ardent. However, they are all equally
inconſtant, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0823800103:118"/> to the female but a few days, and
then ſeeking out for another not to be enjoyed, perhaps, without a repetition
of their former danger.</p>
            <p>In this manner the ſtag continues to range from one to the other
for about three weeks, the time the rut continues; during which he ſcarce
eats, ſleeps, or reſts, but continues to purſue, to combat, and to enjoy.
At the end of this period of madneſs, for ſuch in this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal it ſeems
to be, the creature that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fat, ſleek, and gloſſy, becomes
lean, feeble, and timid. He then retires from the herd to ſeek plenty and
repoſe; he frequents the ſide of the foreſt, and chuſes the moſt
nouriſhing paſtures, remaining there till his ſtrength is renewed. Thus
is his whole life paſſed in the alternations of plenty and want, of
corpulence and inanition, of health and ſickneſs, without having his
conſtitution much affected by the violence of the change. As he is above five
years coming to perfection, he lives about forty years; and it is a general
rule, that every ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal lives about ſeven or eight times the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of
years which it continues to grow. What, therefore, is reported concerning the
life of this animal, has ariſen from the credulity of ignorance: ſome
ſay, that a ſtag having been <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0823800103:119"/> taken in France, with a
collar, on which were written theſe words, 
<q rend="inline">"Caeſar hoc me donavit;"</q> this was interpreted
of Julius Caeſar; but it is not conſidered that Caeſar is a general name
for kings, and that one of the Emperors of Germany, who are always ſtiled
Caeſars, might have ordered the inſcription.</p>
            <p>This animal may differ in the term of his life according to the
goodneſs of his paſture, or the undiſturbed repoſe he happens to enjoy.
Theſe are advantages that influence not only his age, but his ſize and his
vigour. The ſtags of the plains, the vallies, and the little hills, which
abound in corn and paſture, are much more corpulent and much taller than
ſuch as are bred on the rocky waſte, or the heathy mountain. The latter are
low, ſmall, and meagre, incapable of going ſo ſwift as the former,
although they are found to hold out much longer. They are alſo more artful in
evading the hunters; their horns are generally black and ſhort, while thoſe
of the lowland ſtags are reddiſh and flouriſhing; ſo that the animal
ſeems to encreaſe in beauty and ſtature in proportion to the goodneſs
of the paſture, which he enjoys in ſecurity.</p>
            <p>The uſual colour of the ſtag in England is red; nevertheleſs,
the greater number in other <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0823800103:120"/> countries are brown. There
are ſome few that are white; but theſe ſeem to have obtained this colour
in a former ſtate of domeſtic tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Of all the animals that are
natives of this climate, there are none that have ſuch a beautiful eye as the
ſtag: it is ſparkling, ſoft, and ſenſible. His ſenſes of
ſmelling and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are in no leſs perfection. When he is in the leaſt
alarmed, he lifts the head and erects the ears, ſtanding for a few minutes as
if in a liſtening poſture. Whenever he ventures upon ſome unknown ground,
or quits his native co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, he firſt ſtops at the ſkirt of the plain
to examine all around; he next turns againſt the wind to examine by the
ſmell if there be any enemy approaching. If a perſon ſhould happen to
whiſtle or call out, at a diſtance, the ſtag is ſeen to ſtop ſhort
in his ſlow mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured pace, and gazes upon the ſtranger with a kind of
aukward admiration: if the cunning animal perceives neither dogs nor fire-arms
preparing againſt him, he goes forward, quite unconcerned, and ſlowly
proceeds without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to fly. Man is not the enemy he is moſt afraid of;
on the contrary, he ſeems to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the ſound of the
ſhepherd's pipe; and the hunters ſometimes make uſe of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
to allure the poor animal to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0823800103:121"/>The ſtag eats ſlowly, and is very delicate
in the choice of his paſture. When he has eaten a ſufficiency, he then
retires to the covert of ſome thicket to chew the cud in ſecurity. His
rumination, however, ſeems performed with much greater difficulty than with
the cow or ſheep; for the graſs is not returned from the firſt ſtomach
without much ſtraining, and a kind of hiccup, which is eaſily perceived
during the whole time it continues. This may proceed from the greater length of
his neck and the narrowneſs of the paſſage, all thoſe of the cow and
the ſheep kind having it much wider.</p>
            <p>This animal's voice is much ſtronger, louder, and more tremulous
in proportion as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in age; in the time of rut it is even ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible.
At that ſeaſon he ſeems ſo tranſported with paſſion that nothing
obſtructs his fury; and, when at bay, he keeps the dogs off with great
intrepidity. Some years ago, the Duke of Cumberland cauſed a tiger and a
ſtag to be encloſed in the ſame area; and the ſtag made ſo bold a
defence, that the tiger was at laſt obliged to fly. The ſtag ſeldom
drinks in the winter, and ſtill leſs in the ſpring, while the plants are
tender and covered over with dew. It is in the heat of the ſummer, and during
the time of rut, that he is ſeen conſtantly fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting 
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0823800103:122"/> the ſide of rivers and lakes, as well to ſlake his
thirſt as to cool his ardour. He ſwims with great eaſe and ſtrength,
and beſt at thoſe times when he is fatteſt, his fat keeping him buoyant,
like oil upon the ſurface of the water. During the time of rut he even
ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures out to ſea, and ſwims from one iſland to another, although
there may be ſome leagues diſtance between them.</p>
            <p>The cry of the hind, or female, is not ſo loud as that of the
male, and is never excited but by apprehenſion for herſelf or her young. It
need ſcarce be mentioned that ſhe has no horns, or that ſhe is more
feeble and unfit for hunting than the male. When once they have conceived, they
ſeparate from the males, and then they both herd together apart. The time of
geſtation continues between eight and nine months, and they generally produce
but one at a time. Their uſual ſeaſon for bringing forth is about the
month of May, or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of June, during which they take great care to
hide their young in the moſt obſcure thickets. Nor is this precaution
without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſince almoſt every creature is then a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable enemy.
The eagle, the falcon, the oſprey, the wolf, the dog, and all the rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
family of the cat kind, are in continual <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0823800103:123"/> employment to
find out her retreat. But, what is more unnatural ſtill, the ſtag himſelf
is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemy, and ſhe is obliged to uſe all her arts to
conceal her young from him as from the moſt dangerous of her purſuers. At
this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, therefore, the courage of the male ſeems transferred to the
female; ſhe defends her young againſt her leſs formidable opponents by
force; and when purſued by the hunter, ſhe ever offers herſelf to
miſlead him from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal object of her concern. She flies before the
hounds for half the day, and then returns to her young, whoſe life ſhe has
thus preſerved at the hazard of her own. The calf, for ſo the young of this
animal is called, never quits the dam during the whole ſummer; and in winter,
the hind, and all the males under a year old, keep together, and aſſemble
in herds, which are more numerous in proportion as the ſeaſon is more
ſevere. In the ſpring they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate; the hinds to bring forth, while
none but the year olds remain together; however, theſe animals are in general
fond of herding and grazing in company; it is danger or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity alone
that ſeparates them.</p>
            <p>The dangers they have to fear from other animals, are nothing when
compared to thoſe from man. The men of every age and nation 
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0823800103:124"/> have made the chace of the ſtag one of their moſt
favourite purſuits; and thoſe who firſt hunted from neceſſity, have
continued it for amuſement. In our own country, in particular, hunting was
ever eſteemed as one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal diverſions of the great<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Britiſh Zoology.</bibl>
               </note>. At firſt, indeed, the
beaſts of chace had the whole iſland for their range, and knew no other
limits than thoſe of the ocean.</p>
            <p>The Roman juriſprudence, which was formed on the manners of the
firſt ages, eſtabliſhed it as a law, that, as the natural right of things
which have no maſter belongs to the firſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, wild
beaſts, birds, and fiſhes, are the property of whoſoever could firſt
take them. But the northern barbarians, who over-ran the Roman empire, bringing
with them the ſtrongeſt reliſh for this amuſement, and, being now
poſſeſſed of more eaſy means of ſubſiſtence from the lands they
had conquered, their chiefs and leaders began to appropriate the right of
hunting, and, inſtead of a natural right, to make it a royal one. When the
Saxon kings, therefore, had eſtabliſhed themſelves into an heptarchy, the
chaces were reſerved by each ſovereign for his own particular amuſement.
Hunting and war, in thoſe uncivilized ages, <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0823800103:125"/> were the
only employment of the great. Their active, but uncultivated, minds were
ſuſceptible of no pleaſures but thoſe of a violent kind, ſuch as gave
exerciſe to their bodies, and prevented the uneaſineſs of thinking. But
as the Saxon kings only appropriated thoſe lands to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the
chace which were unoccupied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo no individuals received any injury.
But it was otherwiſe when the Norman kings were ſettled upon the throne.
The paſſion for hunting was then carried to an exceſs, and every civil
right was involved in general ruin. This ardour for hunting was ſtronger than
the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of religion even in a ſuperſtitious age. The village
communities, nay, even the moſt ſacred edifices, were thrown down, and all
turned into one vaſt waſte, to make room for animals, the objects of a
lawleſs tyrant's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Sanguinary laws were enacted to preſerve the
game; and, in the reigns of William Rufus and Henry the Firſt, it was leſs
criminal to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one of the human ſpecies than a beaſt of chace. Thus
it continued while the Norman line filled the throne; but when the Saxon line
was reſtored, under Henry the Second, the rigour of the foreſt laws were
ſoftened. The barons alſo for a long time imitated the encroachments, as
well as the amuſements, of the monarch; but <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0823800103:126"/> when
property became more happily divided, by the introduction of arts and
induſtry, theſe extenſive hunting grounds became more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited; and as
tillage and huſbandry encreaſed, the beaſts of chace were obliged to give
way to others more uſeful to community. Thoſe vaſt tracts of land, before
dedicated to hunting, were then contracted; and, in proportion as the uſeful
arts gained ground, they protected and encouraged the labours of the
induſtrious, and repreſſed the licentiouſneſs of the ſportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
It is, therefore, among the ſubjects of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotic government only that
theſe laws remain in full force, where large waſtes lie uncultivated for
the purpoſes of hunting, where the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman can find no protection from
the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions of his lord, or the continual depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe animals
which he makes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>In the preſent cultivated ſtate of this country, therefore, the
ſtag is unknown in its wild na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate; and ſuch of them as remain
among us are kept, under the name of red deer, in parks among the fallow deer.
But they are become leſs common than formerly; its exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
viciouſneſs, during the rutting ſeaſon, and the badneſs of its
fleſh, inducing moſt people to part with the ſpecies. The few that
ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0823800103:127"/> wild are to be found on the moors that
border on Cornwall and Devonſhire; and in Ireland, on moſt of the large
mountains of that country.</p>
            <p>In England, the hunting the ſtag and the buck are performed in the
ſame manner; the animal is driven from ſome gentleman's park, and then
hunted through the open country. But thoſe who purſue the wild animal, have
a much higher object, as well as a greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in the chace. To let
looſe a creature that was already in our poſſeſſion, in order to
catch it again, is, in my opinion, but a poor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, as the reward when
obtained is only what we before had given away. But to purſue an animal that
owns no proprietor, and which he that firſt ſeizes may be ſaid to
poſſeſs, has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it that ſeems at leaſt more rational;
this rewards the hunter for his toil, and ſeems to repay his induſtry.
Beſides, the ſuperior ſtrength and ſwiftneſs of the wild animal
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the amuſement; it is poſſeſſed of more various arts to
eſcape the hunter, and leads him to precipices where the danger ennobles the
chace. In purſuing the animal let looſe from a park, as it is unuſed to
danger, it is but little verſed in the ſtratagems of eſcape; the hunter
follows as ſure of overcoming, and feels none <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0823800103:128"/> of
thoſe alternations of hope and fear which ariſe from the uncertainty of
ſucceſs. But it is otherwiſe with the mountain ſtag: having ſpent his
whole life in a ſtate of continual apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; having frequently been
followed, and as frequently eſcaped, he knows every trick to miſlead, to
confound, or intimidate his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers; to ſtimulate their ardour, and
enhance their ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who hunt this animal have their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar terms for the
different objects of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. The profeſſors in every art take a
pleaſure in thus employing a language known only to themſelves, and thus
accumulate words which to the ignorant have the appearance of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. In
this manner, the ſtag is called the firſt year, a <hi>calf,</hi> or
<hi>hind calf</hi>; the ſecond year, a <hi>knobber</hi>; the third, a
<hi>brock</hi>; the fourth, a <hi>ſtaggard</hi>; the fifth, a
<hi>ſtag</hi>; the ſixth, an <hi>hart.</hi> The female is called an
<hi>hind</hi>; the firſt year ſhe is a <hi>calf</hi>; the ſecond, a
<hi>hearſe</hi>; the third, a <hi>hind.</hi> This animal is ſaid to
<hi>harbour</hi> in the place where he reſides. When he cries he is ſaid to
<hi>bell</hi>; the print of his hoof is called the <hi>ſlot</hi>; his tail is
called the <hi>ſingle</hi>; his excrement the <hi>few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>; his horns are
called his <hi>head:</hi> when ſimple, the firſt year, they are called
<hi>broches</hi>; the third year, <hi>ſpears</hi>; the fourth year, that part
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0823800103:129"/> which bears the antlers is called the <hi>beam,</hi> and
the little impreſſions upon its ſurface <hi>glitters</hi>; that which
riſe from the cruſt of the <hi>beam</hi> are called <hi>pearls.</hi> The
antlers alſo have diſtinct names: the firſt that branches off is called
the <hi>antler</hi>; the ſecond the <hi>ſur antler</hi>; all the reſt
which grow afterwards, till you come to the top, which is called the
<hi>crown,</hi> are called <hi>royal antlers.</hi> The little buds about the
tops are called <hi>croches.</hi> The impreſſion on the place where the
ſtag has lain, is called the <hi>layer.</hi> If it be in covert or a thicket,
it is called his <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> Where a deer has paſſed into a thicket,
leaving marks whereby his bulk may be gueſſed, it is called an
<hi>entry.</hi> When they caſt their heads, they are ſaid to <hi>mew.</hi>
When they rub their heads againſt trees, to bring off the peel of their
horns, they are ſaid to <hi>fray.</hi> When a ſtag hard hunted takes to
ſwimming in the water, he is ſaid to <hi>go ſail</hi>; when he turns his
head againſt the hounds, he is ſaid to <hi>bay</hi>; and when the hounds
purſue upon the ſcent, until they have unharboured the ſtag, they are
ſaid to <hi>draw on the ſlot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such are but a few of the many terms uſed by hunters in purſuing
of the ſtag, moſt of which are now laid aſide, or in uſe only among
game-keepers. The chace, however, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0823800103:130"/> in many
parts of the country where the red deer is ſtill preſerved, and ſtill
makes the amuſement of ſuch as have not found out more liberal
entertainments. In thoſe few places where the animal is perfectly wild, the
amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as was ſaid above, is ſtill ſuperior. The firſt great
care of the hunter, when he leads out his hounds to the mountain ſide, where
the deer are generally known to harbour, is to make choice of a proper ſtag
to purſue. His am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is to unharbour the largeſt and the boldeſt of
the whole herd; and for this purpoſe he examines the track, if there be any,
which if he finds long and large, he concludes, that it muſt have belonged to
a ſtag, and not an hind, the print of whoſe foot is rounder. Thoſe marks
alſo which he leaves on trees, by the rubbing of his horns, ſhew his
ſize, and point him out as the proper object of purſuit. Now to ſeek out
a ſtag in his haunt, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that he changes his manner of
feeding every month. From the concluſion of rutting-time, which is November,
he feeds in heaths and broomy places. In December they herd together, and
withdraw into the ſtrength of the foreſts, to ſhelter themſelves from
the ſeverer weather, feeding on holm, elder trees, and brambles. The three
following months they <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0823800103:131"/> leave herding, but keep four or
five in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and venture out to the corners of the foreſt, where they
feed on winter paſture, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times making their incurſions into the
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring corn-fields, to feed upon the tender ſhoots, juſt as they
peep above ground. In April and May they reſt in thickets and ſhady places,
and ſeldom venture forth, unleſs rouzed by approaching danger. In September
and October their annual ardour returns; and then they leave the thickets,
boldly facing every danger, without any certain place for food or harbour.
When, by a knowledge of theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, the hunter has found out the
reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the quality of his game, his next care is to uncouple and
caſt off his hounds in the purſuit: theſe no ſooner perceive the
ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous animal that flies before them, but they altogether open in full cry,
purſuing rather by the ſcent than the view, encouraging each other to
continue the chace, and tracing the flying animal with the moſt amazing
ſagacity. The hunters alſo are not leſs ardent in their ſpeed on
horſeback, cheering up the dogs, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them where to purſue. On
the other hand, the ſtag, when unharboured, flies at firſt with the
ſwiftneſs of the wind, leaving his purſuers ſeveral miles in the rear;
and at length having <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0823800103:132"/> gained his former coverts, and no
longer hearing the cries of the dogs and men that he had juſt left behind, he
ſtops, gazes round him, and ſeems to recover his natural tranquility. But
this calm is of ſhort duration, for his inveterate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers ſlowly and
ſecurely trace him along, and he once more hears the approaching
deſtruction from behind. He again, therefore, renews his efforts to eſcape,
and again leaves the purſuers at almoſt the former diſtance; but this
ſecond effort makes him more feeble than before, and when they come up a
ſecond time, he is unable to outſtrip them with equal velocity. The poor
animal now, therefore, is obliged to have recourſe to all his little arts of
eſcape, which ſometimes, though but ſeldom, avail him. In proportion as
his ſtrength fails him, the ardour of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers is enflamed; he tracks
more heavily on the ground, and this encreaſing the ſtrength of the
ſcent, redoubles the cries of the hounds, and enforces their ſpeed. It is
then that the ſtag ſeeks for refuge among the herd, and tries every
artifice to put off ſome other head for his own. Sometimes he will ſend
forth ſome little deer in his ſtead, in the mean time lying cloſe
himſelf, that the hounds may overſhoot him. He will break into one thicket
after another to find deer, rouzing them, gathering <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0823800103:133"/> them
together, and endeavouring to put them upon the tracks he has made. His old
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, however, with a true ſpirit of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, now all forſake
and ſhun him with the moſt watchful induſtry, leaving the unhappy
creature to take his fate by himſelf. Thus abandoned of his fellows, he again
tries other arts, by doubling and croſſing in ſome hard beaten highway,
where the ſcent is leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable. He now alſo runs againſt the
wind, not only to cool himſelf, but the better to hear the voice, and judge
of the diſtance of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable purſuers. It is now eaſily perceivable
how ſorely he is preſſed, by his manner of running, which from the
bounding eaſy pace with which he begun, is converted into a ſtiff and
ſhort manner of going; his mouth alſo is black and dry, without foam on it;
his tongue hangs out; and the tears, as ſome ſay, are ſeen ſtarting
from his eyes. His laſt refuge, when every other method of ſafety has
failed him, is to take the water, and to attempt an eſcape by croſſing
whatever lake or river he happens to approach. While ſwimming, he takes all
poſſible care to keep in the middle of the ſtream, leſt, by touching
the bough of a tree, or the herbage on the banks, he may give ſcent to the
hounds. He is alſo ever found to ſwim <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0823800103:134"/> againſt the
ſtream; whence the huntſmen have made it into a kind of proverb, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>That he that would his chace find, muſt up
with the river and down with the wind.</hi>
               </q> On this occaſion too he will
often cover himſelf under water, ſo as to ſhew nothing but the tip of his
noſe. Every reſource, and every art being at length ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, the poor
creature tries the laſt remains of his ſtrength, by boldly oppoſing
thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies he cannot eſcape; he therefore faces the dogs and men,
threatens with his horns, guards himſelf on every ſide, and for ſome time
ſtands at bay. In this manner, quite deſperate, he furiouſly aims at the
firſt dog or man that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; and it often happens that he does not die
unrevenged. At that time, the more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, both of the dogs and men, ſeem
willing to avoid him; but the whole pack quickly coming up, he is ſoon
ſurrounded and brought down, and the huntſman winds a <hi>treble mort,</hi>
as it is called, with his horn.</p>
            <p>Such is the manner of purſuing this animal in England; but every
country has a peculiar method of its own, adapted either to the nature of the
climate, or the face of the ſoil. The ancient manner was very different from
that practiſed at preſent; they uſed their dogs only to find out the
game, but not to rouze it. <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0823800103:135"/> Hence they were not curious
as to the muſic of their hounds, or the compoſition of their pack; the dog
that opened before he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his game, was held in no eſtimation.
It was their uſual manner ſilently to find out the animal's retreat, and
ſurround it with nets and engines, then to drive him up with all their cries,
and thus force him into the toils which they had previouſly prepared.</p>
            <p>In ſucceeding times the faſhion ſeemed to alter; and
particularly in Sicily, the manner of hunting was as follows<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Pier. Hieroglyph. lib. vii. cap. vi.</bibl>
               </note>. The
nobles and gentry being informed which way an herd of deer paſſed, gave
notice to one another, and appointed a day of hunting. For this purpoſe,
every one was to bring a croſs-bow, or a long bow, and a bundle of ſtaves,
ſhod with iron, the heads bored, with a cord paſſing through them all.
Thus provided they came to where the herd continued grazing, and caſting
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about in a large ring, ſurrounded the deer on every ſide.
Then each taking his ſtand, unbound his faggot, ſet up his ſtake, and
tied the end of the cord to that of his next neighbour, at the diſtance of
about ten feet one from the other. Between each of theſe ſtakes was hung a
bunch of crimſon feathers, and ſo <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0823800103:136"/> diſpoſed, that
with the leaſt breath of wind they would whirl round, and preſerve a ſort
of fluttering motion. This done, the perſons who ſet up the ſtaves
withdrew, and hid themſelves in the neighbouring coverts: then the chief
huntſman, entering with his hounds within the lines, rouzed the game with a
full cry. The deer, frighted, and flying on all ſides, upon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the
lines, were ſcared away by the fluttering of the feathers, and wandered about
within this artificial paling, ſtill awed by the ſhining and fluttering
plumage that encircled their retreat: the huntſman, however, ſtill
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, and calling every perſon by name, as he paſſed by their
ſtand, commanded him to ſhoot the firſt, third, or ſixth, as he
pleaſed; and if any of them miſſed, or ſingled out another than that
aſſigned him, it was conſidered as a moſt ſhameful miſchance. In
this manner, however, the whole herd was at laſt deſtroyed; and the day
concluded with mirth and feaſting.</p>
            <p>The ſtags of China are of a particular kind, for they are no
taller than a common houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dog; and hunting them is one of the principal
diverſions of the great. Their fleſh, while young, is exceedingly good; but
when they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at maturity, it begins to grow hard and tough: however, the
tongue, the muzzle, and <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0823800103:137"/> the ears, are in particular
eſteem among that luxurious people. Their manner of taking them is ſingular
enough: they carry with them the heads of ſome of the females ſtuffed, and
learn exactly to imitate their cry; upon this the male does not fail to appear,
and looking on all ſides, perceives the head, which is all that the hunter,
who is himſelf concealed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers. Upon their nearer approach, the whole
company riſe, ſurround, and often take him alive.</p>
            <p>There are very few varieties in the red deer of this country; and
they are moſtly found of the ſame ſize and colour. But it is otherwiſe
in different parts of the world, where they are ſeen to differ in form, in
ſize, in horns, and in colour.</p>
            <p>The ſtag of Corſica is a very ſmall animal, being not above
half the ſize of thoſe common among us. His body is ſhort and thick, his
legs ſhort, and his hair of a dark brown.</p>
            <p>There is in the foreſts of Germany, a kind of ſtag, named by the
ancients the Tragelaphus, and which the natives call the Bran Deer, or the
Brown Deer. This is of a darker colour than the common ſtag, of a lighter
ſhade upon the belly, long hair upon the neck and throat, by which it appears
bearded, like the goat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0823800103:138"/>There is alſo a very beautiful ſtag, which
by ſome is ſaid to be a native of Sardinia; but others (among whom is Mr.
Buffon) are of opinion that it comes from Africa or the Eaſt Indies. He calls
it the Axis, after Pliny; and conſiders it as making the ſhade between the
ſtag and the fallow deer. The horns of the axis are round, like thoſe of
the ſtag; but the form of its body entirely reſembles that of the buck, and
the ſize alſo is exactly the ſame. The hair is of four colours; namely,
fallow, white, black, and grey. The white is predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant under the belly, on
the inſide of the thighs, and the legs. Along the back there are two rows of
ſpots in a right line; but thoſe on other parts of the body are very
irregular. A white line runs along each ſide of this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, while the head
and neck are grey. The tail is black above, and white beneath; and the hair
upon it is ſix inches long.</p>
            <p>Although there are but few individuals of the deer kind, yet the
race ſeems diffuſed over all parts of the earth. The new continent of
America, in which neither the ſheep, the goat, nor the gazelle, have been
originally bred, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs produces ſtags, and other animals of the
deer kind, in ſufficient plenty. The Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans have a breed of white ſtags
in their <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0823800103:139"/> parks, which they call Stags Royal<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. xii. p. 35.</bibl>
               </note>. The ſtags of
Canada differ from ours in nothing except the ſize of the horns, which in
them is greater; and the direction of the antlers, which rather turn back, than
project forward, as in thoſe of Europe. The ſame difference of ſize that
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains among our ſtags, is alſo to be ſeen in that country; and, as we
are informed by Ruyſch, the Americans have brought them into the ſame
ſtate of domeſtic tameneſs that we have our ſheep, goats, or black
cattle. They ſend them forth in the day-time to feed in the foreſts; and at
night they return home with the herdſman who guards them. The inhabitants
have no other milk but what the hind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces; and uſe no other cheeſe but
what is made from thence. In this manner we find, that an animal which ſeems
made only for man's amuſement, may be eaſily brought to ſupply his
neceſſities. Nature has many ſtores of happineſs and plenty in
reſerve, which only want the call of induſtry to be produced, and now
remain as candidates for human appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>

               <head>THE FALLOW DEER.</head>
               <p>NO two animals can be more nearly allied than the ſtag and the
fallow deer<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon, vol. xii. p.
36.</bibl>
                  </note>. Alike in form, alike in diſpoſition, in the ſuperb
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of their heads, in their ſwiftneſs and timidity; and yet no two
animals keep more diſtinct, or avoid each other with more fixed animoſity.
They are never ſeen to herd in the ſame place, they never engender
together, or form a mixed breed; and even in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where the
ſtag is common, the buck ſeems to be entirely a ſtranger. In ſhort,
they both form diſtinct families; which, though ſo ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly near, are
ſtill remote; and although with the ſame habitudes, yet retain an
unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable averſion.</p>
               <p>The fallow deer, as they are much ſmaller, ſo they ſeem of a
nature leſs robuſt, and leſs ſavage than thoſe of the ſtag kind.
They are found but rarely wild in the foreſts; they are, in general, bred up
in parks, and kept for the purpoſes of hunting, or of luxury, their fleſh
being preferred to that of any other animal. It need ſcarce be mentioned,
that the horns of the buck make its principal diſtinction, being broad and
palmated; whereas thoſe of the ſtag <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0823800103:141"/> are in every
part round. In the one, they are flatted and ſpread like the palm of the
hand; in the other they grow like a tree, every branch being of the ſhape of
the ſtem that bears it. The fallow deer alſo has the tail longer, and the
hair lighter than the ſtag; in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, they pretty nearly
reſemble one another.</p>
               <p>The head of the buck, as of all other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of this kind, is
ſhed every year, and takes the uſual time for repairing. The only
differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between it and the ſtag is, that this change happens later in the
buck; and its rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-time, conſequently, falls more into the winter. It is
not found ſo furious at this ſeaſon as the former; nor does it ſo much
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt itſelf by the violence of its ardour. It does not quit its natural
paſtures in queſt of the female, nor does it attack other animals with
indiſcriminate ferocity: however, the males combat for the female among each
other; and it is not without many conteſts, that one buck is ſeen to become
maſter of the whole herd.</p>
               <p>It often happens alſo, that an herd of fallow deer is ſeen to
divide into two parties, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage each other with great ardour and
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon, vol. xii. p.
36.</bibl>
                  </note>. They both ſeem deſirous of gaining ſome favourite
ſpot of the park for paſture, <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0823800103:142"/> and of driving the
vanquiſhed party into the coarſer and more diſagreeable parts. Each of
theſe factions has its particular chief; namely, the two oldeſt and
ſtrongeſt of the herd. Theſe lead on to the engagement; and the reſt
follow under their direction. Theſe combats are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular enough, from the
diſpoſition and conduct which ſeems to regulate their mutual efforts.
They attack with order, and ſupport the aſſault with courage; they come
to each other's aſſiſtance, they retire, they rally, and never give up
the victory upon a ſingle defeat. The combat is renewed for ſeveral days
together; until at length the moſt feeble ſide is obliged to give way, and
is content to eſcape to the moſt diſagreeable part of the park, where
only they can find ſafety and protection.</p>
               <p>The fallow deer is eaſily tamed, and feeds upon many things
which the ſtag refuſes. By this means it preſerves its veniſon better;
and even after rutting, it does not appear entirely exhauſted. It continues
almoſt in the ſame ſtate through the whole year, although there are
particular ſeaſons when its fleſh is chiefly in eſteem. This animal
alſo browzes cloſer than the ſtag; for which reaſon it is more
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial among young trees, which it often ſtrips too cloſe for
recovery. The young deer <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0823800103:143"/> eat much faſter and more
greedily than the old; they ſeek the female at their ſecond year, and, like
the ſtag, are fond of variety. The doe goes with young above eight months,
like the hind; and commonly brings forth one at a time: but they differ in
this, that the buck comes to perfection at three, and lives till ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen;
whereas the ſtag does not come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection till ſeven, and lives till
forty.</p>
               <p>As this animal is a beaſt of chace, like the ſtag, ſo the
hunters have invented a number of names relative to him. The buck is the
firſt year called a <hi>fawn</hi>; the ſecond, a <hi>pricket</hi>; the
third, a <hi>ſorel</hi>; the fourth, a <hi>ſore</hi>; the fifth, a <hi>buck
of the firſt head</hi>; and the ſixth, a <hi>great buck</hi>: The female is
called a <hi>doe</hi>; the firſt year a <hi>fawn</hi>; and the ſecond a
<hi>tegg.</hi> The manner of hunting the buck is pretty much the ſame as that
of ſtag hunting, except that leſs ſkill is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the latter. The
buck is more eaſily rouzed; it is ſufficient to judge by the view, and mark
what grove or covert it enters, as it is not known to wander far from thence;
nor, like the ſtag, to change his <hi>layer,</hi> or place of repoſe. When
hard hunted, it takes to ſome ſtrong hold or covert with which it is
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, in the more gloomy parts of the wood, or the ſteeps of the
mountain; not like <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0823800103:144"/> the ſtag, flying far before the
hounds, nor croſſing nor doubling, nor uſing any of the ſubtleties
which the ſtag is accuſtomed to. It will take the water when ſorely
preſſed, but ſeldom a great river; nor can it ſwim ſo long, nor ſo
ſwiftly, as the former. In general, the ſtrength, the cunning, and the
courage of this animal, are inferior to thoſe of the ſtag; and,
conſequently, it affords neither ſo long, ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, nor ſo
obſtinate a chace: beſides, being lighter, and not tracking ſo deeply, it
leaves a leſs powerful and laſting ſcent, and the dogs in the purſuit
are more frequently at a fault.</p>
               <p>As the buck is a more delicate animal than the ſtag, ſo alſo
is it ſubject to greater varieties<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Britiſh
Zoology.</bibl>
                  </note>. We have in England two varieties of the fallow-deer,
which are ſaid to be of foreign origin. The beautiful ſpotted kind, which
is ſuppoſed to have been brought from Bengal; and the very deep brown
ſort, that are now ſo common in ſeveral parts of this kingdom. Theſe
were introduced by king James the Firſt, from Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: for having obſerved
their hardineſs, and that they could endure the winter, even in that ſevere
climate, without fodder, he brought over ſome of them into Scotland, and
diſpoſed of them among his chaces. Since that time, they have 
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0823800103:145"/> multiplied in many parts of the Britiſh em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and
England is now become more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for its veniſon, than any other country in
the world. Whatever pains the French have taken to rival us in this particular,
the fleſh of their fallow-deer, of which they keep but a few, has neither the
fatneſs nor the flavour of that fed upon Engliſh paſture.</p>
               <p>However, there is ſcarce a country in Europe, except far to the
northward, in which this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is a ſtranger. The Spaniſh fallow-deer are
as large as ſtags, but of a darker colour, and a more ſlender neck: their
tails are longer than thoſe of ours, they are black above, and white below.
The Virginian deer are larger and ſtronger than ours, with great necks, and
their colour inclinable to grey. Other kinds have the hoofs of their hind legs
marked out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with a white ſpot; and their ears and tails much longer
than the common. One of theſe has been ſeen full of white ſpots, with a
black liſt down the middle of his back. In Guiana, a country of South
America, according to Labat, there are deer without horns, which are much
leſs than thoſe of Europe, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling them in every other
particular. They are very lively, light of courſe, and exceſſively
fearful; their hair is of a reddiſh ſallow, their <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0823800103:146"/>
heads are ſmall and lean, their ears little, their necks long and arched, the
tail ſhort, and the ſight piercing. When purſued, they fly into places
where no other animal can follow them. The Negroes, who purſue them, ſtand
to watch for them in narrow paths, which lead to the brook or the meadow where
they feed; there waiting in the utmoſt ſilence, for the ſlighteſt
ſound will drive them away, the Negroe, when he perceives the animal within
reach, ſhoots, and is happy if he can bring down his game. Their fleſh,
though ſeldom fat, is conſidered as a great delicacy, and the hunter is
well rewarded for his trouble.</p>

               <head>THE ROE-BUCK.</head>
               <p>THE Roe-buck is the ſmalleſt of the deer kind known in our
climate, and is now almoſt extinct among us, except in ſome parts of the
highlands of Scotland. It is generally about three feet long, and about two
feet high. The horns are from eight to nine inches long, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, round, and
divided into only three branches. The body is covered with very long hair, well
adapted to the rigour of its mountainous abode. The lower part of each hair is
aſh colour; near the ends is a narrow <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0823800103:147"/> bar of black,
and the points are yellow. The hairs on the face are black, tipped with aſh
colour. The ears are long, their inſides of a pale yellow, and covered with
long hair. The ſpaces bordering on the eyes and mouth, are black. The
cheſt, belly, and legs, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the thighs, are of a yellowiſh
white; the rump is of a pure white, and the tail very ſhort. The make of this
little animal is very elegant; and its ſwiftneſs equals its beauty. It
differs from the fallow-deer, in having round horns, and not flatted like
theirs. It differs from the ſtag, in its ſmaller ſize, and the
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable paucity of its antlers: and it differs from all of the goat
kind, as it annually ſheds its head, and obtains a new one, which none of
that kind are ever ſeen to do.</p>
               <p>As the ſtag frequents the thickeſt foreſts, and the ſides
of the higheſt mountains, the roe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buck, with humbler ambition, courts the
ſhady thicket, and the riſing ſlope. Although leſs in ſize, and far
inferior in ſtrength to the ſtag, it is yet more beautiful, more active,
and even more courageous. Its hair is always ſmooth, clean, and gloſſy;
and it frequents only the dryeſt places, and of the pureſt air. Though but
a very little animal, as we have already obſerved, yet, when its young is
attacked, it <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0823800103:148"/> faces even the ſtag himſelf, and often
comes off victorious<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon, vol. xii. p.
75.</bibl>
                  </note>. All its motions are elegant and eaſy; it bounds without
effort, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues the courſe with but little fatigue. It is alſo
poſſeſſed of more cunning in avoiding the hunter, is more difficult to
purſue, and, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though its ſcent is much ſtronger than that of the
ſtag, it is more frequently found to make good a retreat. It is not with the
roe-buck, as with the ſtag, who never offers to uſe art until his
ſtrength is beginning to decline; this more cunning animal, when it finds
that its firſt efforts to eſcape are without ſucceſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns upon its
former track, again goes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and again returns, until by its various
windings it has entirely confounded the ſcent, and joined the laſt
emanations to thoſe of its former courſe. It then, by a bound, goes to one
ſide, lies flat upon its belly, and permits the pack to paſs by very near,
without offering to ſtir.</p>
               <p>But the roe-buck differs not only from the ſtag in ſuperior
cunning, but alſo in its natural appetites, its inclinations, and its whole
habits of living. Inſtead of herding together, theſe animals live in
ſeparate families; the ſire, the dam, and the young ones, aſſociate
together, <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0823800103:149"/> and never admit a ſtranger into their little
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. All others of the deer kind are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant in their affection;
but the roe-buck never leaves its mate; and as they have been generally bred up
together, from their firſt fawning, they conceive ſo ſtrong an
attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the male for the female, that they never after ſeparate. Their
rutting-ſeaſon continues but fifteen days; from the latter end of October,
to about the middle of November. They are not at that time, like the ſtag,
overloaded with fat; they have not that ſtrong odour, which is perceived in
all others of the deer kind; they have none of thoſe furious exceſſes;
nothing, in ſhort, that alters their ſtate: they only drive away their
fawns upon theſe occaſions; the buck forcing them to retire, in order to
make room for a ſucceeding progeny: however, when the copulating ſeaſon
is over, the fawns return to their does, and remain with them ſome time
longer; after which, they quit them entirely, in order to begin an independant
family of their own. The female goes with young but five months and an half;
which alone ſerves to diſtinguiſh this animal from all others of the deer
kind, that continue pregnant more than eight. In this reſpect, ſhe rather
approaches more nearly to the goat kind; from which, <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0823800103:150"/>
however, this race is ſeparated by the male's annual caſting its horns.</p>
               <p>When the female is ready to bring forth ſhe ſeeks a retreat in
the thickeſt part of the woods, being not leſs apprehenſive of the buck,
from whom ſhe then ſeparates, than of the wolf, the wild cat, and almoſt
every ravening animal of the foreſt; ſhe generally produces two at a time,
and three but very rarely. In about ten or twelve days theſe are able to
follow their dam, except in caſes of warm purſuit, when their ſtrength is
not equal to the fatigue. Upon ſuch occaſions, the tenderneſs of the dam
is very extraordinary; leaving them in the deepeſt thickets, ſhe offers
herſelf to the danger, flies before the hounds, and does all in her power to
lead them from the retreat where ſhe has lodged her little ones. Such animals
as are nearly upon her own level ſhe boldly encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; attacks the ſtag,
the wild cat, and even the wolf; and while ſhe has life continues her efforts
to protect her young. Yet all her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are often vain; about the month
of May, which is her fawning time, there is a greater deſtruction among
thoſe animals than at any other ſeaſon of the year. Numbers of the fawns
are taken alive by the peaſants; num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are found out, and worried by the
dogs; <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0823800103:151"/> and ſtill more by the wolf, which has always
been their moſt inveterate enemy. By theſe continual depredations upon this
beautiful creature, the roe-buck is every day becoming ſcarcer; and the whole
race in many countries is wholly worn out. They were once common in England;
the huntſmen, who characteriſed only ſuch beaſts as they knew, have
given names to the different kinds and ages, as to the ſtag: thus they called
it the firſt year an <hi>hind</hi>; the ſecond, a <hi>gyrle</hi>; and the
third, an <hi>hemuſe</hi>; but theſe names at preſent are utterly
uſeleſs, ſince the animal no longer exiſts among us. Even in France,
where it was once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely common, it is now confined to a few provinces; and
it is probable that in an age or two the whole breed will be utterly
extirpated. Mr. Buffon, indeed, obſerves, that in thoſe diſtricts where
it is moſtly found, it ſeems to maintain its uſual plenty, and that the
balance between its deſtruction and encreaſe is held pretty even; however,
the number in general is known to decreaſe; for wherever cultivation takes
place, the beaſts of nature are known to retire. Many animals that once
flouriſhed in the world may now be extinct; and the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of
Ariſtotle and Pliny, though taken from life, may be conſidered as fabulous,
as their archetypes are no longer exiſting.</p>

Theſe they ſhed at the latter end of autumn, and renew during the winter;
differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this from the ſtag, who ſheds them in ſpring and renews
them in ſummer. When the roe-buck's head is completely furniſhed, it rubs
the horns againſt trees in the manner of the ſtag, and thus ſtrips them
of the rough ſkin and the blood-veſſels, which no longer contribute to
their nouriſhment and growth. When theſe fall, and new ones begin to
appear, the roe-buck does not retire as the ſtag to the covert of the wood,
but continues its uſual haunts, only keeping down its head to avoid
ſtriking its horns againſt the branches of trees, the pain of which it
ſeems to feel with exquiſite ſenſibility. The ſtag, who ſheds his
horns in ſummer, is obliged to ſeek a retreat from the flies, that at that
time greatly incommode him; but the roe-buck, who ſheds them in winter, is
under no ſuch neceſſity; and, conſequently, does not ſeparate from
its little family, but keeps with the female all the year round<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>As the growth of the roe-buck, and its arrival 
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0823800103:153"/> at maturity, is much ſpeedier than that of the ſtag,
ſo its life is proportionably ſhorter. It ſeldom is found to extend above
twelve or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years; and if kept tame it does not live above ſix or
ſeven. It is an animal of a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate conſtitution, requiring variety
of food, air, and exerciſe. It muſt be paired with a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and kept in a
park of at leaſt an hundred acres. They may eaſily be ſubdued, but never
thoroughly tamed. No arts can teach them to be familiar with the feeder, much
leſs attached to him. They ſtill preſerve a part of their natural
wildneſs, and are ſubject to terrors without a cauſe. They ſometimes,
in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eſcape, ſtrike themſelves with ſuch force againſt
the walls of their incloſure, that they break their limbs, and become utterly
diſabled. Whatever care is taken to tame them, they are never entirely to be
relied on, as they have ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious fits of fierceneſs, and ſometimes
ſtrike at thoſe they diſlike with a degree of force that is very
dangerous.</p>
               <p>The cry of the roe-buck is neither ſo loud nor ſo frequent as
that of the ſtag. The young ones have a particular manner of calling to the
dam, which the hunters eaſily imitate, and often thus allure the female to
her deſtruction. Upon ſome occaſions alſo they become in a 
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0823800103:154"/> manner intoxicated with their food, which, during the
ſpring, is ſaid to ferment in their ſtomachs, and they are then very
eaſily taken. In ſummer they keep cloſe under covert of the foreſt, and
ſeldom venture out, except in violent heats, to drink at ſome river or
foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. In general, however, they are contented to ſlake their thirſt
with the dew that falls on the graſs and the leaves of trees, and ſeldom
riſque their ſafety to ſatisfy their appetite. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light chiefly in
hilly grounds, preferring the tender branches and buds of trees to corn, or
other vegetables; and it is univerſally allowed that the fleſh of thoſe
between one and two years old is the greateſt delicacy that is known. Perhaps
alſo, the ſcarceneſs of it enhances its flavour.</p>
               <p>In America this animal is much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon than in Europe. With
us there are but two known varieties; the red, which is the larger ſort; and
the brown, with a ſpot behind, which is leſs. But in the new continent the
breed is extremely numerous, and the varieties in equal proportion. In
Louiſiana, where they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely common, they are much larger than in
Europe, and the inhabitants live in a great meaſure upon its fleſh, which
taſtes like mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton when well fatted. They are found alſo in 
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0823800103:155"/> Braſil, where they have the name of Cuguacu Apara,
only differing from ours in ſome ſlight deviations in the horns. This
animal is alſo ſaid to be common in China; although ſuch as have
deſcribed it ſeem to confound it with the muſk-goat, which is of a quite
different nature.</p>

               <head>THE ELK.</head>
               <p>WE have hitherto been deſcribing minute animals in compariſon
of the Elk; the ſize of which, from concurrent teſtimony, appears to be
equal to that of the elephant itſelf. It is an animal rather of the buck than
the ſtag kind, as its horns are flatted towards the top; but it is far beyond
both in ſtature, ſome of them being known to be above ten feet high. It is
a native both of the old and new continent, being known in Europe under the
name of the Elk, and in America by that of the Mooſe-deer. It is ſometimes
taken in the German and Ruſſian foreſts, although ſeldom appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but it is extremely common in North America, where the natives purſue, and
track it in the ſnow. The accounts of this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal are extremely various;

twelve feet high.</p>

peculiarity, ſo it were to be wiſhed that we could come to ſome
preciſion upon that head. If we were to judge of its ſize by the horns,
which are ſometimes fortuitouſly dug up in many parts of Ireland, we
ſhould not be much amiſs in aſcribing them to an animal at leaſt ten
feet high. One of theſe I have ſeen, which was ten feet nine inches from
one tip to the other. From ſuch dimenſions, it is eaſy to perceive that
it required an animal far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſize of an horſe to ſupport them.
To bear an head with ſuch extenſive and heavy ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, required no ſmall
degree of ſtrength; and without all doubt the bulk of the body muſt have
been proportionable to the ſize of the horns. I remember, ſome years ago,
to have ſeen a ſmall mooſe-deer, which was brought from America, by a
gentleman of Ireland; it was about the ſize of an horſe, and the horns were
very little larger than thoſe of a common ſtag: this, therefore, ſerves
to prove that the horns bear an exact proportion to the animal's ſize; the
ſmall elk has but ſmall horns; whereas thoſe enormous ones, which we have
deſcribed above, muſt have belonged to a proportionable creature. In all
the more noble animals, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture obſerves a perfect ſymmetry; and it is not
to be ſuppoſed ſhe fails in this ſingle inſtance. 
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0823800103:160"/> We have no reaſon, therefore, to doubt the accounts of
Jocelyn and Dudley, who affirm, that they have been found fourteen ſpans;
which, at nine inches to a ſpan, makes the animal almoſt eleven feet high.
Others have extended their accounts to twelve and fourteen feet, which makes
this creature one of the moſt formidable of the foreſt.</p>
               <p>There is but very little difference between the European elk, and
the American mooſe-deer, as they are but varieties of the ſame animal. It
may be rather larger in America than with us; as in the foreſts of that
unpeopled country, it receives leſs diſturbance than in our own. In all
places, however, it is timorous and gentle; content with its paſture, and
never willing to diſturb any other animal, when ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied itſelf.</p>
               <p>The European elk grows to above ſeven or eight feet high. In the
year 1742, there was a female of this animal ſhewn at Paris, which was caught
in a foreſt of Red Ruſſia, belonging to the Cham of Tartary<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Dictionaire Raiſonnée des Animaux. An. Nom
Elan.</bibl>
                  </note>; it was then but young, and its height was even at that
time ſix feet ſeven inches; but the deſcriber obſerves, that it has
ſince become much taller and thicker, ſo that we may ſuppoſe this
female at leaſt <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0823800103:161"/> ſeven feet high. There have been no
late op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ſeeing the male; but, by the rule of proportion, we
may eſtimate his ſize at eight or nine feet at the leaſt, which is about
twice as high as an ordinary horſe. The height, however, of the female, which
was meaſured, was but ſix feet ſeven inches, Paris meaſure; or almoſt
ſeven Engliſh feet high. It was ten feet from the tip of the noſe to the
inſertion of the tail; and eight feet round the body. The hair was very long
and coarſe, like that of a wild boar. The ears reſembled thoſe of a mule,
and were a foot and an half long. The upper jaw was longer, by ſix inches,
than the lower; and, like other ruminating animals, it had no teeth (cutting
teeth I ſuppoſe the deſcriber means). It had a large beard under the
throat, like a goat; and in the middle of the forehead, between the horns,
there was a bone as large as an egg. The noſtrils were four inches long on
each ſide of the mouth. It made uſe of its fore feet, as a defence
againſt its enemies. Thoſe who ſhewed it, aſſerted, that it ran with
aſtoniſhing ſwiftneſs; that it ſwam alſo with equal expedition, and
was very fond of the water. They gave it thirty pounds of bread every day,
beſide hay, and it drank eight <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0823800103:162"/> buckets of water. It
was tame and familiar, and ſubmiſſive enough to its keeper.</p>
               <p>This deſcription differs in many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances from that
which we have of the mooſe, or American elk, which the French call the
Original. Of theſe there are two kinds, the common light grey mooſe, which
is not very large; and the black mooſe, which grows to an enormous height.
Mr. Dudley obſerves, that a doe or hind of the black mooſe kind, of the
fourth year, wanted but an inch of ſeven feet high. All, however, of both
kinds, have flat palmed horns, not unlike the fallow-deer, only that the palm
is much larger, having a ſhort trunk at the head, and then immediately
ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above a foot broad, with a kind of ſmall antlers, like teeth, on
one of the edges. In this particular, all of the elk kind agree; as well the
European elk, as the grey and the black mooſe-deer.</p>
               <p>The grey mooſe-deer is about the ſize of an horſe; and
although it has large buttocks, its tail is not above an inch long. As in all
of this kind the upper lip is much longer than the under, it is ſaid that
they continue to go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as they feed. Their noſtrils are ſo large
that a man may thruſt his hand in a conſiderable <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0823800103:163"/>
way; and their horns are as long as thoſe of a ſtag, but, as was
obſerved, much broader.</p>
               <p>The black mooſe is the enormous animal mentioned above, from
eight to twelve feet high. Joſſeleyn, who is the firſt Engliſh writer
that mentions it, ſays, that it is a goodly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, twelve feet high, with
exceeding fair horns, that have broad palms, two fathoms from the top of one
horn to another. He aſſures us, that it is a creature, or rather a
monſter of ſuperfluity, and many times bigger than an Engliſh ox. This
account is confirmed by Dudley; but he does not give ſo great an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion
to the horns, meaſuring them only thirty-one inches between one tip and the
other: however, that ſuch an extraordinary animal as Joſſeleyn
deſcribes, has actually exiſted, we can make no manner of doubt of, ſince
there are horns common enough to be ſeen among us, twelve feet from one tip
to the other.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals delight in cold countries, feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon graſs
in ſummer, and the bark of trees in winter. When the whole country is deeply
covered with ſnow, the mooſe-deer herd together under the tall pine-trees,
ſtrip off the bark, and remain in that part of the foreſt while it yields
them ſubſiſtence. It is at that time that the natives prepare to hunt
them; <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0823800103:164"/> and particularly when the ſun begins to melt the
ſnow by day, which is frozen again at night; for then the icy cruſt which
covers the ſurface of the ſnow, is too weak to ſupport ſo great a bulk,
and only retards the animal's motion. When the Indians, therefore, perceive an
herd of theſe at a diſtance, they immediately prepare for their purſuit,
which is not, as with us, the ſport of an hour, but is attended with toil,
difficulty, and danger<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Phil. Tranſ. vol. ii. p.
436.</bibl>
                  </note>. The timorous animal no ſooner obſerves its enemies
approach, than it immediately endeavours to eſcape, but ſinks at every
ſtep it takes. Still, however, it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues its way through a thouſand
obſtacles: the ſnow, which is uſually four feet deep, yields to its
weight, and embarraſſes its ſpeed; the ſharp ice wounds its feet; and
its lofty horns are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the branches of the foreſt, as it
paſſes along. The trees, however, are broken down with eaſe; and wherever
the mooſe-deer runs, it is perceived by the ſnapping off the branches of
trees, as thick as a man's thigh, with its horns. The chace laſts in this
manner for the whole day; and ſometimes it has been known to continue for
two, nay three days together; for the purſuers are often not leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by famine, than the purſued by fear. <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0823800103:165"/> Their
perſeverance, however, generally ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds; and the Indian who firſt
comes near enough, darts his lance, with unerring aim, which ſticks in the
poor animal, and at firſt encreaſes its efforts to eſcape. In this manner
the mooſe trots heavily on, (for that is its uſual pace) till its
purſuers once more come up, and repeat their blow: upon this, it again
ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons up ſufficient vigour to get an head; but, at laſt, quite tired,
and ſpent with loſs of blood, it ſinks, as the deſcriber expreſſes
it, like a ruined building, and makes the earth ſhake beneath its fall.</p>
               <p>This animal, when killed, is a very valuable acquiſition to the
hunters. The fleſh is very well taſted, and ſaid to be very nouriſhing.
The hide is ſtrong, and ſo thick that it has been often known to turn a
muſket-ball; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is ſoft and pliable, and, when tanned, the
leather is extremely light, yet very laſting. The fur is a light grey in
ſome, and blackiſh in others; and when viewed through a micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope,
appears ſpongy like a bulruſh, and is ſmaller at the roots and points
than in the middle; for this reaſon, it lies very flat and ſmooth, and
though beaten or abuſed never ſo much, it always returns to its former
ſtate. The <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0823800103:166"/> horns alſo are not leſs uſeful, being
applied to all the purpoſes for which hartſhorn is bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial: theſe are
different in different animals; in ſome they reſemble entirely thoſe of
the European elk, which ſpread into a broad palm, with ſmall antlers on one
of the edges; in others they have a branched brow-antler between the bur and
the palm, which the German elk has not; and in this they entirely agree with
thoſe whoſe horns are ſo frequently dug up in Ireland. This animal is
ſaid to be troubled with the epilepſy, as it is often found to fall down
when purſued, and thus becomes an eaſier prey; for this reaſon, an
imaginary virtue has been aſcribed to the hinder hoof, which ſome have
ſuppoſed to be a ſpecific againſt all epileptic diſorders. This,
however, may be conſidered as a vulgar error; as well as that of its curing
itſelf of this diſorder by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the hinder hoof behind the ear. After
all, this animal is but very indifferently and confuſedly deſcribed by
travellers; each mixing his account with ſomething falſe or trivial; often
miſtaking ſome other quadrupede for the elk, and confounding its hiſtory.
Thus ſome have miſtaken it for the rein-deer, which in every thing but
ſize it greatly reſembles; ſome have ſuppoſed it to be the ſame
with the <pb facs="tcp:0823800103:167"/>

barren ſnowy mountains without its aid, ſo this animal can live only there,
where its aſſiſtance is moſt abſolutely neceſſary. From it alone
the natives of Lapland and Greenland ſupply moſt of their wants; it

From this quadrupede alone, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they receive as many advantages as we
derive from three of our moſt uſeful creatures; ſo that Providence does
not leave theſe poor outcaſts entirely deſtitute, but gives them a
faithful domeſtic, more patient and ſerviceable than any other in
nature.</p>
               <p>The rein-deer reſembles the American elk in the faſhion of its
horns. It is not eaſy in words to deſcribe theſe minute differences; nor
will the reader, perhaps, have a diſtinct idea of the ſimilitude, when told
that both have brow-antlers, very large, and hanging over their eyes, palmated
towards the top, and bending forward, like a bow. But here the ſimilitude
between theſe two animals ends; for, as the elk is much larger than the
ſtag, ſo the rein-deer is much ſmaller. It is lower and ſtronger built
than the ſtag; its legs are ſhorter and thicker, and its hoofs much broader
than in that animal; its hair is much thicker and warmer, its horns much larger
in proportion, and branching forward over its eyes; its ears are much larger;
its pace is rather a trot than a bounding, and this it can continue for a whole
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0823800103:172"/> day; its hoofs are cloven and moveable, ſo that it
ſpreads them abroad as it goes, to prevent its ſinking in the ſnow. When
it proceeds on a journey, it lays its great horns on its back, while there are
two branches which always hang over its forehead, and almoſt cover its face.
One thing ſeems peculiar to this animal and the elk; which is, that as they
move along, their hoofs are heard to crack with a pretty loud noiſe. This
ariſes from their manner of treading; for as they reſt upon their cloven
hoof, it ſpreads on the ground, and the two diviſions ſeparate from each
other; but when they lift it, the diviſions cloſe again, and ſtrike
againſt each other with a crack. The female alſo of the rein-deer has horns
as well as the male, by which the ſpecies is diſtinguiſhed from all other
animals of the deer kind whatſoever.</p>
               <p>When the rein-deer firſt ſhed their coat of hair, they are
brown; but, in proportion as ſummer approaches, their hair begins to grow
whitiſh; until, at laſt, they are nearly grey<note n="*" place="bottom">For
the greateſt part of this deſcription of the Rein-Deer, I am obliged to Mr.
Hoffberg; upon whoſe authority, being a native of Sweden, and an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced

about the eyes. The neck has long hair, hanging down, <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0823800103:173"/>
and coarſer than upon any other part of the body. The feet, juſt at the
inſertion of the hoof, are ſurrounded with a ring of white. The hair in
general ſtands ſo thick over the whole body, that if one ſhould attempt
to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate it, the ſkin will no where appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered: whenever it
falls alſo, it is not ſeen to drop from the root, as in other quadrupedes,
but ſeems broken ſhort near the bottom; ſo that the lower part of the
hair is ſeen growing, while the upper falls away.</p>
               <p>The horns of the female are made like thoſe of the male, except
that they are ſmaller and leſs branching. As in the reſt of the deer
kind, they ſprout from the points; and alſo in the beginning, are
furniſhed with an hairy cruſt, which ſupports the blood-veſſels, of
moſt exquiſite ſenſibility. The rein-deer ſhed their horns, after
rutting-time, at the latter end of November; and they are not completely
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed again till towards autumn. The female always retains hers till
ſhe brings forth, and then ſheds them, about the beginning of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember. If
ſhe be barren, however, which is not unfrequently the caſe, ſhe does not
ſhed them till winter. The caſtration of the rein-deer does not prevent the
ſhedding of their horns: thoſe which are the ſtrongeſt, caſt them 
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0823800103:174"/> early in winter; thoſe which are more weakly, not ſo
ſoon. Thus, from all theſe, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, we ſee how greatly this
animal differs from the common ſtag. The female of the rein-deer has horns,
which the hind is never ſeen to have; the rein-deer, when caſtrated, renews
its horns, which we are aſſured the ſtag never does: it differs not
leſs in its habits and manner of living, being tame, ſubmiſſive, and
patient; while the ſtag is wild, capricious, and unmanageable.</p>
               <p>The rein-deer, as was ſaid, is naturally an inhabitant of the
countries bordering on the arctic circle. It is not unknown to the natives of
Siberia. The North Americans alſo hunt it, under the name of the
<hi>caribou.</hi> But in Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, this animal is converted to the utmoſt
advantage; and ſome herdſmen of that country are known to poſſeſs
above a thouſand in a ſingle herd.</p>
               <p>Lapland is divided into two diſtricts, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous and the
woody. The mountainous part of the country is at beſt barren and bleak,
exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively cold, and uninhabitable during the winter; ſtill, however,
it is the moſt deſireable part of this frightful region, and is moſt
thickly peopled during the ſummer. The natives ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reſide on the
declivity of the mountains, <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0823800103:175"/> three or four cottages
together, and lead a chearful and a ſocial life. Upon the approach of winter,
they are obliged to migrate into the plains below, each bringing down his whole
herd, which often amounts to more than a thouſand, and leading them where the
paſture is in greateſt plenty. The woody part of the country is much more
deſolate and hideous. The whole face of nature there preſents a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſcene of trees without fruit, and plains without verdure. As far as the eye
can reach, nothing is to be ſeen, even in the midſt of ſummer, but barren
fields, covered only with a moſs, almoſt as white as ſnow; no graſs, no
flowery landſcapes, only here and there a pine-tree, which may have eſcaped
the frequent conflagrations by which the natives burn down their foreſts. But
what is very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, as the whole ſurface of the country is cloathed
in white, ſo, on the contrary, the foreſts ſeem to the laſt degree dark
and gloomy. While one kind of moſs makes the fields look as if they were
covered with ſnow, another kind blackens over all the trees, and even hides
their verdure. This moſs, however, which deforms the country, ſerves for
its only ſupport, as upon it alone the rein-deer can ſubſiſt. The
inhabitants, who, during the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0823800103:176"/> lived among the
mountains, drive down their herds in winter, and people the plains and woods
below. Such of the Laplanders as inhabit the woods and the plains all the year
round, live remote from each other, and having been uſed to ſolitude, are
melancholy, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and helpleſs. They are much poorer alſo than the
mountaineers, for, while one of thoſe is found to poſſeſs a thouſand
rein-deer at a time, none of theſe are ever known to rear the tenth part of
that number. The rein-deer makes the riches of this people; and the cold
mountainy parts of the country agree beſt with its conſtitution. It is for
this reaſon, therefore, that the mountains of Lapland are preferred to the
woods; and that many claim an excluſive right to the tops of hills, covered
in almoſt eternal ſnow.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the ſummer begins to appear, the Laplander who had
fed his rein-deer upon the lower grounds, during the winter, then drives them
up to the mountains, and leaves the woody country, and the low paſture, which
at that ſeaſon are truly deplorable. The gnats, bred, by the ſun's heat,
in the marſhy bottoms, and the weedy lakes, with which the country abounds
more than any other part of the world, are all upon the wing, and fill the
whole air, <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0823800103:177"/> like clouds of duſt in a dry windy day. The
inhabitants, at that time, are obliged to daub their faces with pitch, mixed
with milk, to ſhield their ſkins from their depredations. All places are
then ſo greatly infeſted, that the poor natives can ſcarce open their
mouths without fear of ſuffocation; the inſects enter, from their numbers
and minuteneſs, into the noſtrils and the eyes, and do not leave the
ſufferer a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at his eaſe. But they are chiefly enemies to the
rein-deer: the horns of that animal being then in their tender ſtate, and
poſſeſſed of extreme ſenſibility, a famiſhed cloud of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects
inſtantly ſettle upon them, and drive the poor animal almoſt to
diſtraction. In this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, there are but two remedies, to which the
quadrupede, as well as its maſter, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to have recourſe. The one
is, for both to take ſhelter near their cottage, where a large fire of tree
moſs is prepared, which filling the whole place with ſmoke, keeps off the
gnat, and thus, by one inconvenience, expels a greater; the other is, to
aſcend to the higheſt ſummit of the mountains, where the air is too thin,
and the weather too cold, for the gnats to come. There the rein-deer are ſeen
to continue the whole day, although without food, rather than to venture down
into the lower parts, <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0823800103:178"/> where they can have no defence
againſt their unceaſing perſecutors.</p>
               <p>Beſides the gnat, there is alſo a gadfly, that, during the
ſummer ſeaſon, is no leſs formidable to them. This inſect is bred
under their ſkins, where the egg has been depoſed the preceding ſummer;
and it is no ſooner produced as a fly, than it again endeavours to depoſite
its eggs in ſome place ſimilar to that from whence it came. Whenever,
therefore, it appears flying over an herd of rein-deer, it puts the whole body,
how numerous ſoever, into motion; they know their enemy, and do all they can,
by toſſing their horns, and running among each other, to terrify or avoid
it. All their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, however, are too generally without effect; the
gadfly is ſeen to depoſite its eggs, which burrowing under the ſkin,
wound it in ſeveral places, and often bring on an incurable diſorder.</p>
               <p>In the morning, therefore, as ſoon as the Lapland herdſman
drives his deer to paſture, his greateſt care is to keep them from
ſcaling the ſummits of the mountains where there is no food, but where they
go merely to be at eaſe from the gnats and gadflies that are ever annoying
them. At this time, there is a ſtrong conteſt between the dogs and the
deer; the one <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0823800103:179"/> endeavouring to climb up againſt the
ſide of the hill, and to gain thoſe ſummits that are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in eternal
ſnows; the other, forcing them down, by barking and threatening, and, in a
manner, compelling them into the places where their food is in the greateſt
plenty. There the men and dogs confine them; guarding them with the utmoſt
precaution the whole day, and driving them home at the proper ſeaſons for
milking.</p>
               <p>The female brings forth in the middle of May, and gives milk till
about the middle of October. Every morning and evening, during the ſummer,
the herdſman returns to the cottage with his deer to be milked, where the
women previouſly have kindled up a ſmoky fire, which effectually drives off
the gnats, and keeps the rein-deer quiet while milking. The fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male furniſhes
about a pint, which, though thinner than that of the cow, is, nevertheleſs,
ſweeter and more nouriſhing. This done, the herdſman drives them back to
paſture; as he neither folds nor houſes them, neither provides for their
ſubſiſtence during the winter, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves their paſture by
cultivation.</p>
               <p>Upon the return of the winter, when the gnats and flies are no
longer to be feared, the Laplander deſcends into the lower grounds; 
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0823800103:180"/> and, as there are but few to diſpute the
poſſeſſion of that deſolate country, he has an extenſive range to
feed them in. Their chief and almoſt their only food at that time, is the
white moſs already mentioned; which, from its being fed upon by this animal,
obtains the name of the <hi>lichen rangiferinus.</hi> This is of two kinds: the
woody lichen, which covers almoſt all the deſert parts of the country like
ſnow; the other is black, and covers the branches of the trees in very great
quantities. However unpleaſing theſe may be to the ſpectator, the native
eſteems them as one of his choiceſt benefits, and the moſt indulgent gift
of nature. While his fields are cloathed with moſs, he envies neither the
fertility nor the verdure of the more ſouthern landſcape; dreſſed up
warmly in his deer-ſkin cloaths, with ſhoes and gloves of the ſame
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, he drives his herds along the deſert; fearleſs and at eaſe,
ignorant of any higher lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury than what their milk and ſmoke dried fleſh
afford him. Hardened to the climate, he ſleeps in the midſt of ice; or
awaking, dozes away his time with tobacco; while his faithful dogs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his place, and keep the herd from wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The deer, in the mean time, with
inſtincts adapted to the ſoil, purſue their food, though covered in the
deepeſt ſnow. They turn it up <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0823800103:181"/> with their noſes,
like ſwine; and even though its ſurface be frozen and ſtiff, yet the hide
is ſo hardened in that part, that they eaſily overcome the difficulty. It
ſometimes, however, happens, though but rarely, that the winter commences
with rain, and a froſt enſuing, covers the whole country with a glazed
cruſt of ice. Then, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, both the rein-deer and the Laplander are undone;
they have no proviſions laid up in caſe of accident, and the only
reſource is to cut down the large pine-trees, that are covered with moſs,
which furniſhes but a ſcanty ſupply; ſo that the greateſt part of the
herd is then ſeen to periſh, without a poſſibility of aſſiſtance.
It ſometimes alſo happens, that even this ſupply is wanting; for the
Laplander often burns down his woods, in order to improve and fertilize the
ſoil which produces the moſs, upon which he feeds his cattle.</p>
               <p>In this manner the paſtoral life is ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued near the
pole; neither the coldneſs of the winter, nor the length of the nights,
neither the wildneſs of the foreſt, nor the vagrant diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the
herd, interrupt the even tenour of the Laplander's life. By night and day he is
ſeen attending his favourite cattle, and remains unaffected, in a ſeaſon
which would be ſpeedy death to thoſe bred up in a milder climate. He 
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0823800103:182"/> gives himſelf no uneaſineſs to houſe his herds
or to provide a winter ſubſiſtence for them; he is at the trouble neither
of manuring his grounds, nor bringing in his harveſts; he is not the
hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of another's luxury; all his labours are to obviate the
neceſſities of his own ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and theſe he undergoes with
chearfulneſs, as he is ſure to enjoy the fruits of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. If,
therefore, we compare the Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander with the peaſant of more ſouthern
cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, we ſhall have little reaſon to pity his ſituation; the climate
in which he lives is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terrible to us than to him; and, as for the
reſt, he is bleſſed with liberty, plenty, and eaſe. The rein-deer alone
ſupplies him with all the wants of life, and ſome of the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies,
ſerving to ſhew how many advantages nature is capable of ſupplying, when
neceſſity gives the call. Thus, the poor, little, helpleſs native, who
was originally, perhaps, driven by fear or famine into thoſe inhoſpitable
cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, would ſeem, at firſt view, to be the moſt wretched of mankind:
but it is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he looks round among the few wild ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals that his
barren country can maintain, and ſingles out one from among them, and that of
a kind which the reſt of mankind have not thought worth taking from a ſtate
of nature; <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0823800103:183"/> this he cultivates, propagates, and
multiplies, and from this alone derives every comfort that can ſoften the
ſeverity of his ſituation.</p>
               <p>The rein-deer of this country are of two kinds, the wild and the
tame. The wild are larger and ſtronger, but more miſchievous than the
others. Their breed, however, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to that of the tame; and the female
of the latter is often ſent into the woods, from whence ſhe returns home
impregnated by one of the wild kind. Theſe are fitter for drawing the
ſledge, to which the Laplander accuſtoms them betimes, and yoaks them to it
by a ſtrap, which goes round the neck, and comes down between their legs. The
ſledge is extremely light, and ſhod at the bottom, with the ſkin of a
young deer, the hair turned to ſlide on the frozen ſnow. The perſon who
ſits on this guides the animal with a cord, faſtened round the horns, and
encourages it to proceed with his voice, and drives it with a goad. Some of the
wild breed, though by far the ſtrongeſt, are yet found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory, and
often turn upon their drivers; who have then no other reſource but to cover
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their ſledge, and let the animal vent its fury upon that.
But it is otherwiſe with thoſe that are tame; no creature can be more
active, patient, and willing: when hard puſhed, <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0823800103:184"/> they
will trot nine or ten Swediſh miles, or between fifty and ſixty Engliſh
miles, at one ſtretch. But, in ſuch a caſe, the poor obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient creature
fatigues itſelf to death; and, if not prevented by the Laplander, who kills
it immediately, it will die a day or two after. In general, they can go about
thirty miles without halting, and this without any great or dangerous efforts.
This, which is the only manner of travelling in that country, can be performed
only in winter, when the ſnow is glazed over with ice; and although it be a
very ſpeedy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of conveyance, yet it is inconvenient, dangerous, and
troubleſome.</p>
               <p>In order to make theſe animals more obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and more
generally ſerviceable, they caſtrate them; which operation the Laplanders
perform with their teeth; theſe become ſooner fat when taken from labour;
and they are found to be ſtronger in drawing the ſledge. There is uſually
one male left entire for every ſix fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males; theſe are in rut from the
Feaſt of St. Matthew to about Michaelmas. At this time, their horns are
thoroughly burniſhed, and their battles among each other are fierce and
obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. The females do not begin to breed till they are two years old;
and then they continue regularly breeding every year till they are
ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perannuated. <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0823800103:185"/> They go with young above eight months,
and generally bring forth two at a time. The fondneſs of the dam for her
young is very remarkable; it often happens that when they are ſeparated from
her, ſhe will return from paſture, keep calling round the cottage for them,
and will not deſiſt until, dead or alive, they are brought and laid at her
feet. They are at firſt of a light brown; but they become darker with age;
and at laſt the old ones are of a brown almoſt approaching to blackneſs.
The young follow the dam for two or three years; but they do not acquire their
full growth until four. They are then broke in, and managed for drawing the
ſledge; and they continue ſerviceable for four or five years longer. They
never live above fifteen or ſixteen years; and, when they arrive at the
proper age, the Laplander generally kills them for the ſake of their ſkins
and their fleſh. This he performs by ſtriking them on the back of the neck,
with his knife, into the ſpinal marrow; upon which they inſtantly fall, and
he then cuts the arteries that lead to the heart, and lets the blood
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge itſelf into the cavity of the breaſt.</p>
               <p>There is ſcarce any part of this animal that is not converted to
its peculiar uſes. As ſoon as it begins to grow old, and ſome time before
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0823800103:186"/> the rut, it is killed, and the fleſh dried in the air.
It is alſo ſometimes hardened with ſmoke, and laid up for travelling
proviſion, when the natives migrate from one part of the country to another.
During the winter, the rein-deer are ſlaughter'd as ſheep with us; and
every four perſons in the family are allowed one rein-deer for their week's
ſubſiſtence. In ſpring, they ſpare the herd as much as they can, and
live upon freſh fiſh. In ſummer, the milk and curd of the rein-deer makes
their chief provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and, in autumn, they live wholly upon fowls, which
they kill with a croſs-bow, or catch in ſpringes. Nor is this ſo ſcanty
an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance; ſince, at that time, the ſea-fowls come in ſuch abundance
that their ponds and ſprings are covered over. Theſe are not ſo ſhy as
with us, but yield themſelves an eaſy prey. They are chiefly allured to
thoſe places by the ſwarms of gnats which infeſt the country during
ſummer, and now repay the former inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, by inviting ſuch numbers
of birds as ſupply the natives with food a fourth part of the year, in great
abundance.</p>
               <p>The milk, when newly taken, is warmed in a cauldron, and thickened
with rennet, and then the curd is preſſed into cheeſes, which are little
and well taſted. Theſe are never found to <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0823800103:187"/> breed
mites as the cheeſe of other countries, probably becauſe the mite fly is
not to be found in Lapland. The whey which remains is warmed up again, and
becomes of a conſiſtence as if thickened with the white of eggs. Upon this
the Laplanders feed during the ſummer; it is pleaſant and well taſted,
but not very nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing. As to butter they very ſeldom make any, becauſe
the milk affords but a very ſmall quantity, and this, both in taſte and
conſiſtence, is more nearly reſembling to ſuet. They never keep their
milk till it turns ſour; and do not dreſs it into the variety of diſhes
which the more ſouthern countries are known to do. The only delicacy they
make from it is with wood ſorrel, which being boiled up with it, and
coagulating, the whole is put into caſks, or deer-ſkins, and kept under
ground to be eaten in winter.</p>
               <p>The ſkin is even a more valuable part of this animal than either
of the former. From that part of it which covered the head and feet, they make
their ſtrong ſnow ſhoes with the hair on the outſide. Of the other
parts they compoſe their garments, which are extremely warm, and which cover
them all over. The hair of theſe alſo is on the outſide; and they
ſometimes line them within with the fur of the Glutton, or ſome other warm
furr'd animal of that cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0823800103:188"/> Theſe ſkins alſo
ſerve them for beds. They ſpread them on each ſide of the fire, upon the
leaves of the dwarf birch-tree, and in this manner lie both ſoft and warm.
Many gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, made of the ſkin of the rein deer, are ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

more ſouthern parts of Europe; and they are found ſo ſerviceable in
keeping out the cold, that even people of the firſt rank are known to wear
them.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, no part of this animal is thrown away as uſeleſs
The blood is preſerved in ſmall caſks, to make ſauce with the marrow in
ſpring. The horns are ſold to be converted into glue. The ſinews are
dried, and divided ſo as to make the ſtrongeſt kind of ſowing thread,
not unlike catgut. The tongues, which are conſidered as a great delicacy, are
dried, and ſold into the more ſouthern provinces. The inteſtines
themſelves are waſhed like our tripe, and in high eſteem among the
natives. Thus the Laplander finds all his neceſſities amply ſupplied from
this ſingle animal; and he who has a large herd of theſe animals has no
idea of higher luxury.</p>
               <p>But, although the rein-deer be a very hardy and vigorous animal,
it is not without its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. I have already mentioned the pain it 
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0823800103:189"/> feels from the gnat, and the apprehenſions it is under
from the gad-fly. Its hide is often found pierced in an hundred places, like a
ſieve, from this inſect, and not a few die in their third year, from this
very cauſe Their teats alſo are ſubject to cracking, ſo that blood
comes inſtead of milk. They ſometimes take a loathing for their food; and,
inſtead of eating, ſtand ſtill, and chew the cud. They are alſo
troubled with a vertigo, like the elk, and turn round often till they die. The
Laplander judges of their ſtate by the manner of their turning. If they turn
to the right, he judges their diſorder but ſlight; if they turn to the
left, he deems it incurable. The rein-deer are alſo ſubject to ulcers near
the hoof, which unqualifies them for travelling, or keeping with the herd. But
the moſt fatal diſorder of all is that which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives call the
ſuddataka, which attacks this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal at all ſeaſons of the year. The
inſtant it is ſeized with this diſeaſe it begins to breathe with
greater difficulty, its eyes begin to ſtare, and its noſtrils to expand. It
acquires alſo an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual degree of ferocity, and attacks all it meets
indiſcriminately. Still, however, it continues to feed as if in health, but
is not ſeen to chew the cud, and it lies down more frequently than before. In
this manner it continues, every day <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0823800103:190"/> conſuming and
growing more lean, till at laſt it dies from mere inanition; and not one of
theſe that are attacked with this diſorder are ever found to recover.
Notwithſtanding, it is but very lately known in that part of the world;
although, during the laſt ten or fifteen years, it has ſpoiled whole
provinces of this neceſſary creature. It is contagious; and the moment the
Laplander perceives any of his herd infected, he haſtens to kill them
immediately, before it ſpreads any farther. When examined internally, there
is a frothy ſubſtance found in the brain, and round the lungs; the
inteſtines are lax and flabby, and the ſpleen is diminiſhed almoſt to
nothing. The Laplander's only cure in all theſe diſorders, is to anoint the
animal's back with tar; if this does not ſucceed, he conſiders the
diſeaſe as beyond the power of art; and, with his natural phlegm, ſubmits
to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of fortune.</p>
               <p>Beſides the internal maladies of this animal there are ſome
external enemies which it has to fear. The bears now and then make
depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the herd; but of all their perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the creature
called the Glutton is the moſt dangerous and the moſt ſucceſsful. The
war between theſe is carried on not leſs in Lapland than in North America,
where the rein-deer is <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0823800103:191"/> called the Caribow, and the
Glutton the Carca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou. This animal, which is not above the ſize of a badger,
waits whole weeks together for its prey, hid in the branches of ſome
ſpreading tree; and when the wild rein-deer paſſes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, it
inſtantly drops down upon it, fixing its teeth and claws into the neck,
juſt behind the horns. It is in vain that the wounded ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal then flies for
protection, that it ruſtles among the branches of the foreſt, the Glutton
ſtill holds its former poſition; and, although it often loſes a part of
its ſkin and fleſh, which are rubbed off againſt the trees, yet it
ſtill keeps faſt, until its prey drops with fatigue and loſs of blood.
The deer has but one only method of eſcape, which is by jumping into the
water; that element its enemy cannot endure; for, as we are told, it quits its
hold immediately, and then thinks only of providing for its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſecurity.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. Of Quadrupedes of the Hog Kind.</head>
            <p>ANIMALS of the hog kind ſeem to unite in themſelves all thoſe
diſtinctions by which others are ſeparated. They reſemble thoſe of the
horſe kind in the number of their teeth, which in all amount to forty-four,
in the length of their head, and in having but a ſingle ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. They
reſemble the cow kind in their cloven hoofs and the poſition of their
inteſtines; and they reſemble thoſe of the claw-footed kind in their
appetite for fleſh, in their not chewing the cud, and in their numerous
progeny. Thus this ſpecies ſerves to fill up that chaſm which is found
between the carnivorous kinds and thoſe that live upon graſs; being
poſſeſſed of the ravening appetite of the one, and the inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
nature of the other. We may conſider them, therefore, as of a middle nature,
which we can refer neither to the rapacious nor the peaceful kinds, and yet
partaking ſomewhat of the nature of both. Like the rapacious kinds, they are
found to have ſhort inteſtines; their hoofs alſo, though cloven to the
ſight, will, upon anatomical inſpection, appear to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with
bones like beaſts of prey; and the <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0823800103:193"/> number of their
teats alſo encreaſe the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: on the other hand, in a natural
ſtate they live upon vegetables, and ſeldom ſeek after animal food,
except when urged by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. They offend no other animal of the
foreſt at the ſame time that they are furniſhed with arms to terrify the
braveſt.</p>
            <p>The Wild Boar, which is the original of all the varieties we find in
this creature, is by no means ſo ſtupid nor ſo filthy an animal as that
we have reduced to tameneſs; he is much ſmaller than the tame hog, and does
not vary in his colour as thoſe of the domeſtic kind do, but is always
found of an iron grey, inclining to black; his ſnout is much longer than that
of the tame hog, and the ears are ſhorter, rounder, and black; of which
colour are alſo the feet and the tail. He roots the ground in a different
manner from the common hog; for as this turns up the earth in little ſpots
here and there, ſo the wild boar plows it up like a furrow, and does
irreparable damage in the cultivated lands of the farmer. The tuſks alſo of
this animal are larger than in the tame breed, ſome of them being ſeen
almoſt a foot long<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. ix. p.
147.</bibl>
               </note>. Theſe, as is well known, grow from both the under and
upper jaw, bend upwards circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0823800103:194"/> and are exceeding
ſharp at the points. They differ from the tuſks of the elephant in this,
that they never fall; and it is remarkable of all the hog kind, that they never
ſhed their teeth as other animals are ſeen to do. The tuſks of the lower
jaw are always the moſt to be dreaded, and are found to give very terrible
wounds.</p>
            <p>The wild boar can properly be called neither a ſolitary nor a
gregarious animal. The three firſt years the whole litter follows the ſow,
and the family lives in a herd together. They are then called beaſts of
company, and unite their common forces againſt the invaſions of the wolf,
or the more formidable beaſts of prey. Upon this their principal ſafety
while young depends, for when attacked they give each other mutual
aſſiſtance, calling to each other with a very loud and fierce note; the
ſtrongeſt face the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; they form a ring, and the weakeſt fall into
the center. In this poſition few ravenous beaſts dare venture to attack
them, but purſue the chace where there is leſs reſiſtance and danger.
How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when the wild boar is come to a ſtate of maturity, and when
conſcious of his own ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior ſtrength, he then walks the foreſt
alone, and fearleſs. At that time he dreads no ſingle creature, nor does he
turn out of his way even <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0823800103:195"/> for man himſelf. He does not
ſeek danger, and he does not much ſeem to avoid it.</p>
            <p>This animal is therefore ſeldom attacked, but at a diſadvantage,
either by numbers, or when found ſleeping by moon-light. The hunting the wild
boar is one of the principal amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the nobility in thoſe countries
where it is to be found. The dogs provided for this ſport are of the ſlow
heavy kind. Thoſe uſed for hunting the ſtag, or the roe-buck, would be
very improper, as they would too ſoon come up with their prey; and, inſtead
of a chace, would only furniſh out an engagement. A ſmall maſtiff is
therefore choſen; nor are the hunters much mindful of the goodneſs of their
noſe, as the wild boar leaves ſo ſtrong a ſcent, that it is
impoſſible for them to miſtake its courſe. They never hunt any but the
largeſt and the oldeſt, which are known by their tracks. When the boar is
<hi>rear'd,</hi> as is the expreſſion for driving him from his covert, he
goes ſlowly and uniformly forward, not much afraid, nor very far before his
purſuers. At the end of every half mile, or thereabouts, he turns round,
ſtops till the hounds come up, and offers to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them. Theſe, on the
other hand, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their danger, keep off, and bay him at a diſtance. After
they have for a while gazed <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0823800103:196"/> upon each other, with mutual
animoſity, the boar again ſlowly goes on his courſe, and the dogs renew
their purſuit. In this manner the charge is ſuſtained, and the chace
continues till the boar is quite tired, and refuſes to go any farther. The
dogs then attempt to cloſe in upon him from behind; thoſe which are young,
fierce, and unaccuſtomed to the chace, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the foremoſt, and
often loſe their lives by their ardour. Thoſe which are older and better
trained are content to wait until the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters come up, who ſtrike at him
with their ſpears, and, after ſeveral blows, diſpatch or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him.
The inſtant the animal is killed, they cut off the teſticles, which would
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe give a taint to the fleſh; and the huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men celebrate the
victory with their horns.</p>
            <p>The hog, in a natural ſtate, is found to feed chiefly upon roots
and vegetables; it ſeldom attacks any other animal, being content with ſuch
proviſions as it procures without danger. Whatever animal happens to die in
the foreſt, or is ſo wounded that it can make no reſiſtance, becomes a
prey to the hog, who ſeldom refuſes animal food, how putrid ſoever,
although it is never at the pains of taking or procuring it alive. For this
reaſon, it ſeems a glutton ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by accident than choice, content with
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0823800103:197"/> food, and only devouring fleſh when
preſſed by neceſſity, and when it happens to offer. Indeed, if we
behold the hog in its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic ſtate, it is the moſt ſordid and brutal
animal in nature<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. ix. p.
14.</bibl>
               </note>. The aukwardneſs of its form ſeems to influence its
appetites; and all its ſenſations are as groſs as its ſhapes are
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſightly. It ſeems poſſeſſed only of an inſatiable deſire of
eating; and ſeems to make choice only of what other animals find the moſt
offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. But we ought to conſider that the hog with us is in an
unnatural ſtate, and that it is in a manner compelled to feed in this filthy
manner from wanting that proper nouriſhment which it finds in the foreſt.
When in a ſtate of wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is of all other quadrupedes the moſt
delicate in the choice of what vegetables it ſhall feed on, and rejects a
greater number than any of the reſt. The cow, for inſtance, as we are
aſſured by Linnaeus, eats two hundred and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty-ſix plants, and
rejects two hundred and eighteen; the goat eats four hundred and forty-nine,
and rejects an hundred and twenty-ſix; the ſheep eats three hundred and
eighty ſeven, and rejects an hundred and forty-one; the horſe eats two
hundred and ſixty-two, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects two hundred and twelve; but the hog, 
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0823800103:198"/> more nice in its proviſion than any of the former,
eats but ſeventy-two plants, and rejects an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventy-one. The
indelicacy of this animal is, therefore, rather in our apprehenſions than in
its nature; ſince we find it makes a very diſtinguiſhing choice in the
quality of its food; and if it does not reject animal putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may be
becauſe it is abridged in that food which is moſt wholeſome and agreeable
to it in a ſtate of nature. This is certain, that its palate is not
inſenſible to the difference of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables; for, where it finds variety, it
will reject the worſt, with as diſtinguiſhing a taſte as any other
quadrupede whatſoever<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Britiſh Zoology, vol.
i. p. 42.</bibl>
               </note>. In the orchards of peach-trees in North America, where
the hog has plenty of delicious food, it is obſerved, that it will reject the
fruit that has lain but a few hours on the ground, and continue on the watch
whole hours together for a freſh windfall.</p>
            <p>However, the hog is naturally formed in a more imperfect manner than
the other animals that we have rendered domeſtic around us, leſs active in
its motions, leſs furniſhed with inſtinct in knowing what to purſue or
avoid. Without attachment, and incapable of inſtruction, it continues, while
it lives, an uſeleſs, or rather a <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0823800103:199"/> rapacious
dependant. The coarſeneſs of its hair, and the thickneſs of its hide,
together with the thick coat of fat that lies immediately under the ſkin,
render it inſenſible to blows, or rough uſage. Mice have been known to
burrow in the back of theſe animals while fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening in the ſty<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon.</bibl>
               </note>, without their ſeeming to perceive
it. Their other ſenſes ſeem to be in tolerable perfection; they ſcent
the hounds at a diſtance; and, as we have ſeen, they are not inſenſible
in the choice of their proviſions.</p>
            <p>The hog is, by nature, ſtupid, inactive, and drowſy; if
undiſturbed, it would ſleep half its time; but it is frequently awaked by
the calls of appetite, which when it has ſatisfied, it goes to reſt again.
Its whole life is thus a round of ſleep and gluttony; and if ſupplied with
ſufficient food, it ſoon grows unfit even for its own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; its
fleſh becomes a greater load than its legs are able to ſupport, and it
continues to feed lying down, or kneeling, an helpleſs inſtance of indulged
ſenſuality. The only time it ſeems to have paſſions of a more active
nature, are, when it is incited by venery, or when the wind blows with any
vehemence. Upon this occaſion, it is ſo agitated as to run violently
towards its ſty, ſcreaming horribly at the ſame time, which ſeems 
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0823800103:200"/> to argue that it is naturally fond of a warm cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.
It appears alſo to foreſee the approach of bad weather, bringing ſtraw to
its ſty in its mouth, preparing a bed, and hiding itſelf from the impending
ſtorm. Nor is it leſs agitated when it hears any of its kind in
diſtreſs: when a hog is caught in a gate, as is often the caſe, or when
it ſuffers any of the uſual domeſtic ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of ringing or ſpaying,
all the reſt are then ſeen to gather round it, to lend their fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
aſſiſtance, and to ſympathize with its ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. They have often
alſo been known to gather round a dog that had teazed them, and kill him upon
the ſpot.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the diſeaſes of this animal ariſe from intemperance;
meaſles, impoſthumes, and ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulous ſwellings, are reckoned among
the number. It is thought by ſome that they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the mire to deſtroy
a ſort of louſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect that is often found to infeſt them; however,
they are generally known to live, when ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to eighteen or twenty
years; and the females produce till the age of fifteen. As they produce from
ten to twenty young at a litter, and that twice a year, we may eaſily compute
how numerous they would ſhortly become, if not diminiſhed by human
induſtry. In the wild ſtate they are leſs prolific; and the ſow of the 
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0823800103:201"/> woods brings forth but once a year, probably becauſe
exhauſted by rearing up her former numerous progeny.</p>
            <p>It would be ſuperfluous to dwell longer upon the nature and
qualities of an animal too well known to need a deſcription: there are few,
even in cities, who are unacquainted with its uſes, its appetites, and way of
living. The arts of fattening, rearing, guarding, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging hogs, fall more
properly under the cognizance of the farmer than the naturaliſt; they make a
branch of domeſtic oeconomy, which, properly treated, may be extended to a
great length: but the hiſtory of nature ought always to end where that of art
begins. It will be ſufficient, therefore, to obſerve that the wild boar was
formerly a native of our country, as appears from the laws of Hoeldda<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Britiſh Zoology, vol. 1. p. 44.</bibl>
               </note>, the
famous Welch legiſlator, who permitted his grand huntſman to chace that
animal from the the middle of November to the beginning of December. William
the Conqueror alſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſuch as were convicted of killing the wild
boar in his foreſts, with the loſs of their eyes. At preſent, the whole
wild breed is extinct; but no country makes greater uſe of the tame kinds, as
their fleſh, which bears ſalt better <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0823800103:202"/> than that of
any other animal, makes a principal part of the proviſions of the Britiſh
Navy.</p>
            <p>As this animal is a native of almoſt every country, there are
ſome varieties found in the ſpecies. That which we call the Eaſt-India
breed, is lower, leſs furniſhed with hair, is uſually black, and has the
belly almoſt touching the ground; it is now common in England, to fatten more
eaſily than the ordinary kinds, and to make better bacon.</p>
            <p>There is a remarkable variety of this animal about Upſal<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Amaenit Accad. vol. v. p. 465.</bibl>
               </note>,
which is ſingle hoofed, like the horſe; but in no other reſpect differing
from the common kinds. The authority of Ariſtotle, who firſt made mention
of this kind, has been often called in queſtion; ſome have aſſerted,
that ſuch a quadrupede never exiſted, becauſe it happened not to fall
within the ſphere of their own confined obſervation; however, at preſent,
the animal is too well known to admit of any doubt concerning it. The hog
common in Guinea differs alſo in ſome things from our own: though ſhaped
exactly as ours, it is of a reddiſh colour, with long ears, which end in a
ſharp point, and a tail which hangs down to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern; the whole body is
covered with ſhort red ſhining hair, without any briſtles, but pretty 
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0823800103:203"/> long near the tail. Their fleſh is ſaid to be
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and they are very tame.</p>
            <p>All theſe, from their near reſemblance to the hog, may be
conſidered as of the ſame ſpecies; the Eaſt-Indian hog, we well know,
breeds with the common kind; whether the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains between it, and
thoſe of Upſal and Guinea, we cannot directly affirm; but where the
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſimilitude is ſo ſtrong, we may be induced to believe, that the
appetites and habits are the ſame. It is true, we are told, that the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea
breed will not mix with ours, but keep ſeparate, and herd only together:
however, this is no proof of their diverſity, ſince every animal will
prefer its own likeneſs in its mate; and they will only then mix with another
ſort, when deprived of the ſociety of their own. Theſe, therefore, we may
conſider as all of the hog kind; but there are other quadrupedes, that, in
general, reſemble this ſpecies, which, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, are very diſtinct
from them. Travellers, indeed, from their general form, or from their habits
and way of living, have been content to call theſe creatures hogs alſo; but
upon a cloſer inſpection, their differences are found to be ſuch as
entirely to ſeparate the kinds, and make each a diſtinct animal by
itſelf.</p>

               <head>THE PECCARY, OR TAJACU.</head>
               <p>THAT animal which of all others moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles an hog, and
yet is of a formation very diſtinct from it, is called the Peccary, or
Tajacu. It is a native of America, and found there, in ſuch numbers, that
they are ſeen in herds of ſeveral hundreds together, grazing among the
woods, and inoffenſive, except when offended.</p>
               <p>The Peccary at firſt view reſembles a ſmall hog; the form of
its body, the ſhape of its head, the length of its ſnout, and the form of
its legs, are entirely alike: however, when we come to examine it nearer, the
differences begin to appear. The body is not ſo bulky; its legs not ſo
long; its briſtles much thicker and ſtronger than thoſe of the hog,
reſembling rather the quills of a porcupine, than hair; inſtead of a tail,
it has only got a little fleſhy protuberance, which does not even cover its
poſteriors; but that which is ſtill more extraordinary, and in which it
differs from all other quadrupedes whatſoever, is, that it has got upon its
back a lump reſembling the navel in other animals which is found to
ſeparate a liquor of a very ſtrong ſmell. The Peccary is the only
creature that has thoſe kind of glands which diſcharge the 
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0823800103:205"/> muſky ſubſtance, on that part of its body. Some
have them under the belly, and others under the tail; but this creature, by a
conformation peculiar to itſelf, has them on its back. This lump, or navel,
is ſituated on that part of the back which is over the hinder legs; it is, in
general, ſo covered with long briſtles, that it cannot be ſeen, except
they be drawn aſide. A ſmall ſpace then appears, that is almoſt bare,
and only beſet with a few ſhort fine hairs. In the middle it riſes like a
lump; and in this there is an orifice, into which one may thruſt a common
gooſe quill. This hole or bag is not above an inch in depth; and round it,
under the ſkin, are ſituated a number of ſmall glands, which diſtil a
whitiſh liquor, which, in colour and ſubſtance, reſembles that obtained
from the civet animal. Perhaps it was this analogy, that led Dr. Tyſon to
ſay, that it ſmelt agreeably alſo, like that perfume. But this Mr. Buffon
abſolutely denies; affirming, that the ſmell is at every time, and in every
proportion, ſtrong and offenſive; and to this I can add my own
teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, if that able naturaliſt ſhould want a voucher.</p>
               <p>But, to be more particular in the deſcription of the other parts
of this quadrupede; the colour of the body is grizly, and beſet with 
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0823800103:206"/> briſtles, thicker and ſtronger than thoſe of a
common hog; though not near ſo thick as thoſe of a porcupine, they
reſemble, in this reſpect, that they are variegated with black and white
rings. The belly is almoſt bare; and the ſhort briſtles on the ſides,
gradually encreaſe in length, as they approach the ridge of the back, where
ſome are five inches long. On the head alſo, between the ears, there is a
large tuft of briſtles, that are chiefly black. The ears are about two inches
and an half long, and ſtand upright; and the eyes reſemble thoſe of a
common hog, only they are ſmaller. From the lower corner of the eye to the
ſnout, is uſually ſix inches; and the ſnout itſelf is like that of an
hog's, though it is but ſmall. One ſide of the lower lip is generally
ſmooth, by the rubbing of the tuſk of the upper jaw. The feet and hoofs are
perfectly like thoſe of a common hog; but, as was already obſerved, it has
no tail. There are ſome anatomical differences in its internal ſtructure,
from that of the common hog. Dr. Tyſon was led to ſuppoſe, that it had
three ſtomachs; whereas the hog has but one: however, in this he was
deceived, as Mr. Daubenton has plainly ſhewn, that the ſtomach is only
divided by two cloſings, which gives it the appearance as if divided into
three; <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0823800103:207"/> and there is no conformation that prevents the
food in any part of it, from going or returning to any other.</p>
               <p>The peccary may be tamed like the hog, and has pretty nearly the
ſame habits and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclinations. It feeds upon the ſame aliments; its
fleſh, though drier and leaner than that of the hog, is pretty good eating;
it is improved by caſtration; and, when killed, not only the parts of
generation muſt be taken inſtantly away, but alſo the navel on the back,
with all the glands that contribute to its ſupply. If this operation be
deferred for only half an hour, the fleſh becomes utterly unfit to be
eaten.</p>
               <p>The peccary is extremely numerous in all the parts of Southern
America. They go in herds of two or three hundred together; and unite, like
hogs, in each other's defence. They are particularly fierce when their young
are attemped to be taken from them. They ſurround the plunderer, attack him
without fear, and frequently make his life pay the forfeit of his raſhneſs.
When any of the natives are purſued by an herd in this manner, they
frequently climb a tree to avoid them; while the peccaries gather round the
root, threaten with their tuſks, and their rough briſtles ſtanding erect,
as in the <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0823800103:208"/> hog kind, they aſſume a very terrible
appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. In this manner they remain at the foot of the tree for hours
together; while the hunter is obliged to wait patiently, and not without
apprehenſions, until they think fit to retire.</p>
               <p>The peccary is rather fond of the mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of the
country, than the lowlands; it ſeems to delight neither in the marſhes nor
the mud, like our hogs; it keeps among the woods, where it ſubſiſts upon
wild fruits, roots, and vegetables; it is alſo an unceaſing enemy to the
lizard, the toad, and all the ſerpent kinds, with which theſe uncultivated
foreſts abound. As ſoon as it perceives a ſerpent, or a viper, it at once
ſeizes it with its fore hoofs and teeth, ſkins it in an inſtant, and
devours the fleſh. This is often ſeen; and may, therefore, be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
credited: but as to its applying to a proper vegetable immediately after, as an
antidote to the poiſon of the animal it had devoured, this part of the
relation we may very well ſuſpect. The fleſh, neither of the toad or
viper, as every one now knows, are poiſonous; and, therefore, there is no
need of a remedy againſt their venom. Ray gives no credit to either part of
the account; however, we can have no reaſon to diſbelieve that it feeds
upon toads and ſerpents; it is only the making uſe of a vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table 
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0823800103:209"/> antidote, that appears improbable, and which perhaps had
its riſe in the ignorance and credulity of the natives.</p>
               <p>The peccary, like the hog, is very prolific; the young ones follow
the dam, and do not ſeparate till they have come to perfection. If taken at
firſt, they are very eaſily tamed, and ſoon loſe all their natural
ferocity; however, they never ſhew any remarkable ſigns of docility, but
continue ſtupid and rude, without attachment, or even ſeeming to know the
hand that feeds them. They only continue to do no miſchief; and they may be
permitted to run tame, without apprehending any dangerous conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. They
ſeldom ſtray far from home; they return of themſelves to the ſty; and
do not quarrel among each other, except when they happen to be fed in common.
At ſuch times, they have an angry kind of growl, much ſtronger
and-harſher than that of an hog; but they are ſeldom heard to ſcream as
the former, only now and then, when frighted, or irritated, they have an abrupt
angry manner of blowing like the boar.</p>
               <p>The peccary, though like the hog in ſo many various reſpects,
is, nevertheleſs, a very diſtinct race, and will not mix, nor produce an
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate breed. The European hog has been <pb facs="tcp:0823800103:210"/>

tranſplanted into America, and ſuffered to run wild among the woods; it is
often ſeen to herd among a drove of peccaries, but never to breed from them.
They may, therefore, be conſidered as two diſtinct creatures; the hog is
the larger, and the more uſeful animal; the peccary, more feeble and local;
the hog ſubſiſts in moſt parts of the world, and in almoſt every
climate; the peccary is a native of the warmer regions, and cannot
ſubſiſt in ours, without ſhelter and aſſiſtance. It is more than
probable, however, that we could readily propagate the breed of this
quadrupede, and that, in two or three ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, it might be familiarized to
our climate: but as it is inferior to the hog, in every reſpect, ſo it
would be needleſs to admit a new domeſtic, whoſe ſervices are better
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the old.</p>

               <head>THE CAPIBARA, OR CABIAI.</head>
               <p>THERE are ſome quadrupedes ſo entirely different from any that
we are acquainted with, that it is hard to find a well known animal to which to
reſemble them. In this caſe, we muſt be content to place them near ſuch
as they moſt approach in form and habits, ſo that the reader may at once
have ſome idea of the creature's <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0823800103:214"/> ſhape or
diſpoſition, although, perhaps, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate and a very confuſed
one.</p>
               <p>Upon that confuſed idea, however, it will be our buſineſs to
work; to bring it, by degrees, to greater preciſion; to mark out the
differences of form, and thus give the cleareſt notions that words can
eaſily convey. The known animal is a kind of rude ſketch of the figure we
want to exhibit; from which, by degrees, we faſhion out the ſhape of the
creature we deſire ſhould be known; as a ſtatuary ſeldom begins his
work, till the rude outline of the figure is given by ſome other
hand.—In this manner, I have placed the Capibara among the hog kind,
merely becauſe it is more like an hog than any other animal commonly known,
and yet, more cloſely examined, it will be found to differ in ſome of the
moſt obvious particulars.</p>
               <p>The Capibara reſembles an hog of about two years old, in the
ſhape of its body, and the coarſeneſs and colour of its hair. Like the
hog, it has a thick ſhort neck, and a rounded briſtly back; like the hog,
it is fond of the water and marſhy places, brings forth many at a time, and,
like it, feeds upon animal and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable food. But, when examined more nearly,
the differences are many and obvious. The head is longer, the eyes are larger,
and the <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0823800103:215"/> ſnout, inſtead of being rounded, as in the
hog, is ſplit, like that of a rabbit or hare, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with thick
ſtrong whiſkers; the mouth is not ſo wide, the number and the form of the
teeth are different, for it is without tuſks: like the peccary, it wants a
tail; and, unlike to all others of this kind, inſtead of a cloven hoof, it is
in a manner web-footed, and thus entirely fitted for ſwimming and living in
the water. The hoofs before are divided into four parts; and thoſe behind,
into three; between the diviſions, there is a prolongation of the ſkin,
ſo that the foot, when ſpread in ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, can beat a greater ſurface
of water.</p>
               <p>As its feet are thus made for the water, ſo it is ſeen to
delight entirely in that element; and ſome naturaliſts have called it the
Water-hog for that reaſon. It is a native of South America, and is chiefly
ſeen frequenting the borders of lakes and rivers, like the otter. It ſeizes
the fiſh upon which it preys, with its hoofs and teeth, and carries them to
the edge of the lake, to devour them at its eaſe. It lives alſo upon
fruits, corn, and ſugar-canes. As its legs are long and broad, it is often
ſeen ſitting up, like a dog that is taught to beg. Its cry more nearly
reſembles the braying of an aſs, than the grunting of an hog. It ſeldom
goes our, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0823800103:216"/> at night, and that always in company.
It never ventures far from the ſides of the river or the lake in which it
preys; for as it runs ill, becauſe of the length of its feet, and the
ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its legs, ſo its only place of ſafety is the water, into
which it immediately plunges when purſued, and keeps ſo long at the bottom,
that the hunter can have no hopes of taking it there. The Capibara, even in a
ſtate of wildneſs, is of a gentle nature, and, when taken young, is
eaſily tamed. It comes and goes at command, and even ſhews an attachment to
its keeper. Its fleſh is ſaid to be fat and tender, but, from the nature of
its food, it has a fiſhy taſte, like that of all thoſe which are bred in
the water. Its head, however, is ſaid to be excellent; and, in this, it
reſembles the beaver, whoſe fore parts taſte like fleſh, and the hinder
like the fiſh it feeds on.</p>

them to rank it among the number: however, when they come to its deſcription,
they repreſent it as having neither the hair, the briſtles, the head, the
ſtature, nor the tail of an hog. Its legs, we are told, are longer, its
ſnout ſhorter, its body more ſlender, and ſomewhat reſembling that of
a ſtag; its hair is finer, of a grey colour, rather reſembling wool than
briſtles, and its tail alſo tufted with the ſame. From theſe
va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties, therefore, it can ſcarcely be called an hog; and yet, in this
claſs we muſt be content to rank it until its form and nature come to be
better known. What we at preſent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally diſtinguiſh it by are four
enormous tuſks, that grow out of each jaw; the two largeſt from the upper,
and the two ſmalleſt from the under. The jaw-bones of this extraordinary
animal are found to be very thick and ſtrong; from whence theſe monſtrous
tuſks are ſeen to proceed, that diſtinguiſh it from all other
quadrupedes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. The two that go from the lower jaw are not above a
foot long, but thoſe of the upper are above half a yard: as in the boar, they
bend circularly, and the two lower ſtand in the jaw as they are ſeen to do
in that animal; but the two upper riſe from the upper jaw, rather like horns
than teeth; and, bending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0823800103:222"/> and backwards,
ſometimes have their points directed to the animal's eyes, and are often
fatal by growing into them. Were it not that the Babyroueſſa has two ſuch
large teeth underneath, we might eaſily ſuppoſe the two upper to be
horns; and, in fact, their ſockets are directed upwards; for which reaſon
Doctor Grew was of that opinion. But, as the teeth of both jaws are of the
ſame conſiſtence, and as they both grow out of ſockets in the ſame
manner, the analogy between both is too ſtrong not to ſuppoſe them of the
ſame nature. The upper teeth, when they leave the ſocket, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
pierce the upper lips of the animal, and grow as if they immediately went from
its cheek. The tuſks in both jaws are of a very fine ivory, ſmoother and
whiter than that of the elephant, but not ſo hard or ſerviceable.</p>
               <p>Theſe enormous tuſks give this animal a very formidable
appearance; and yet it is thought to be much leſs dangerous than the wild
boar<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>.
Like animals of the hog kind, they go together in a body, are often ſeen in
company with the wild boar, with which, however, they are never known to
engender. They have a very ſtrong ſcent, which diſcovers them to the
hounds; and, when purſued, they growl dreadfully, often turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0823800103:223"/> back upon the dogs, and wounding them with the tuſks
of the lower jaw, for thoſe of the upper are rather an obſtruction than a
defence. They run much ſwifter than the boar, and have a more exquiſite
ſcent, winding the men and the dogs at a great diſtance. When hunted
cloſely, they generally plunge themſelves into the ſea, where they ſwim
with great ſwiftneſs and facility, diving, and riſing again at
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and in this manner they moſt frequently eſcape their
purſuers. Although fierce and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible when offended, yet they are peaceable
and harmleſs when unmoleſted. They are eaſily tamed, and their fleſh is
good to be eaten; but it is ſaid to putrefy in a very ſhort time. They have
a way of repoſing themſelves different from moſt other animals of the
larger kind; which is by hitching one of their upper tuſks on the branch of a
tree, and then ſuffering their whole body to ſwing down at eaſe. Thus
ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended from a tooth, they continue the whole night quite ſecure, and
out of the reach of ſuch animals as hunt them for prey.</p>
               <p>The Babyroueſſa, though by its teeth and tuſks it ſeems
fitted for a ſtate of hoſtility, and probably is carnivorous, yet,
nevertheleſs, ſeems chiefly to live upon vegetables and the leaves of
trees. It ſeldom ſeeks to break into <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0823800103:224"/> gardens, like
the boar, in order to pillage the more ſucculent productions of human
induſtry, but lives remote from mankind, content with coarſer fare and
ſecurity. It has been ſaid that it was only to be found in the iſland of
Borneo, but this is a miſtake, as it is well known in many other parts, both
of Aſia and Africa, as at the Celebes, at Eſtrila, Senegal, and
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagaſcar<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>Such are the animals of the hog kind, which are not diſtinctly
known; and even all theſe, as we ſee, have been but imperfectly examined,
or deſcribed. There are ſome others of which we have ſtill more imperfect
notices; ſuch as the Warree, an hog of the iſthmus of Darien, deſcribed
by Wafer, with large tuſks and ſmall ears, and briſtles like a coarſe
fur all over the body. This, however, may be the European hog, which has run
wild in that part of the new world, as no other traveller has taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of
the ſame. The Canary boar ſeems dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from other animals of this kind,
by the largeneſs of its tuſks; and, as is judged from the ſkeleton, by
the apperture of its noſtrils, and the number of its grinders. I cannot
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this account of thoſe animals that are thus furniſhed with
enormous tuſks, without <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0823800103:225"/> obſerving that there is a
ſtrong conſent between theſe and the parts of generation. When
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, it is well known that the tuſks grow much ſmaller, and are
ſcarce ſeen to appear without the lips; but what is ſtill more
remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is, that in a boar, if the tuſks by any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or deſign be
broke away, the animal abates of its fierceneſs and venery, and it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
nearly the ſame effect upon its conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution as if caſtration had

            <head>CHAP. VII. Animals of the Cat Kind.</head>
            <p>WE have hitherto been deſcribing a claſs of peaceful and
harmleſs animals, that ſerve as the inſtruments of man's happineſs, or
at leaſt that do not openly oppoſe him. We come now to a bloody and
unrelenting tribe, that diſdain to own his power, and carry on unceaſing
hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities againſt him. All the claſs of the cat kind are chiefly
diſtinguiſhed by their ſharp and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable claws, which they can hide
and extend at pleaſure. They lead a ſolitary ravenous life, neither uniting
for their mutual defence, like vegetable feeders, nor for their mutual
ſupport, like thoſe of the dog kind. The whole of this cruel and ferocious
tribe ſeek their food alone; and, except at certain ſeaſons, are even
enemies to each other. The dog, the wolf, and the bear, are ſometimes known
to live upon vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table or farinaceous food; but all of the cat kind, ſuch as
the lion, the tiger, the leopard, and the ounce, devour nothing but fleſh,
and ſtarve upon any other proviſion.</p>
            <p>They are, in general, fierce, rapacious, ſubtle and cruel, unfit
for ſociety among each other, and incapable of adding to human hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. 
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0823800103:227"/> However, it is probable that even the fierceſt could
be rendered domeſtic, if man thought the conqueſt worth the trouble. Lions
have been yoked to the chariots of conquerors, and tigers have been taught to
tend thoſe herds which they are known at preſent to deſtroy; but theſe
ſervices are not ſufficient to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the trouble of their
keeping; ſo that ceaſing to be uſeful, they continue to be nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious, and
become rebellious ſubjects becauſe not taken under equal protection with
the reſt of the brute creation.</p>
            <p>Other tribes of animals are claſſed with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; have often
but few points of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance; and, though alike in form, have different
diſpoſitions, and different appetites. But all thoſe of the cat kind,
although differing in ſize, or in colour, are yet nearly allied to each
other; being equally fierce, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious, and artful; and he that has ſeen one
has ſeen all. In other creatures there are many changes wrought by human
aſſiduity; the dog, the hog, or the ſheep, are altered in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and forms, juſt as the neceſſities or the caprice of mankind have found
fitting; but all of this kind are inflexible in their forms, and wear the print
of their natural wildneſs ſtrong upon them. The dogs or cows vary in
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0823800103:228"/> countries, but lions or tigers are ſtill
found the ſame; the very colour is nearly alike in all; and the ſlighteſt
alterations are ſufficient to make a difference in the kinds, and to give the
animal a different denomination.</p>
            <p>The cat kind are not leſs remarkable for the ſharpneſs and
ſtrength of their claws, which thruſt forth from their ſheath when they
ſeize their prey, than for the ſhortneſs of their ſnout, the
roundneſs of their head, and the large whiſkers which grow on the upper
lip. Their teeth alſo, which amount to the number of thirty, are very
formidable; but are rather cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for tearing their prey than for chewing
it; for this reaſon they feed but ſlowly; and while they eat, generally
continue growling, to deter others from taking a ſhare. In the dog kind, the
chief power lies in the under jaw, which is long, and furniſhed with
muſcles of amazing ſtrength; but in theſe the greateſt force lies in
the claws, which are extended with great eaſe, and their gripe is ſo
tenacious that nothing can open it. The hinder parts in all theſe animals are
much weaker than thoſe before; and they ſeem leſs made for ſtrength
than agility. Nor are they endued with the ſwiftneſs of moſt other
animals; but generally owe their ſubſiſtence rather to catching their
prey by ſurprize than <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0823800103:229"/> by hunting it fairly down. They
all ſeize it with a bound, at the ſame time expreſſing their fierce
pleaſure with a roar; and their firſt graſp generally diſables the
captive from all further reſiſtance. With all theſe qualifications for
ſlaughter, they nevertheleſs ſeem timid and cowardly, and ſeldom make
an attack, like thoſe of the dog kind, at a diſadvantage: on the contrary,
they fly when the force againſt them is ſuperior, or even equal to their
own; and the lion himſelf will not venture to make a ſecond attempt, where
he has been once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed with ſucceſs. For this reaſon, in countries
that are tolerably inhabited, the lion is ſo cowardly, that he is often
ſcared away by the cries of women and children.</p>
            <p>The cat, which is the ſmalleſt animal of this kind, is the only
one that has been taken under human protection, and may be conſidered as a
faithleſs friend, brought to oppoſe a ſtill more inſidious enemy<note n="*" place="bottom">This deſcription is nearly tranſlated from Mr. Buffon: what is
added by me, is marked with inverted commas.</note>. It is, in fact, the only
animal of this tribe whoſe ſervices can more than recompence the trouble of
their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and whoſe ſtrength is not ſufficient to make its anger
formidable. The lion or the tiger may eaſily be tamed, and rendered
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0823800103:230"/> to human command; but even in their
humbleſt, and moſt familiar moments, they are ſtill dangerous; ſince
their ſtrength is ſuch, that the ſmalleſt fit of anger or caprice may
have dreadful conſequences. But the cat, though eaſily offended, and often
capricious in her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, is not endued with powers ſufficient to do
any great miſchief. Of all animals, when young, there is none more prettily
playful than the kitten; but it ſeems to loſe this diſpoſition as it
grows old, and the innate treachery of its kind is then ſeen to prevail. From
being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ravenous, education teaches it to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe its appetites,
and to watch the favourable moment of plunder; ſupple, inſinuating, and
artful, it has learned the arts of concealing its intentions till it can put
them into execution; when the opportunity offers, it at once ſeizes upon
whatever it finds, flies off with it, and continues at a diſtance till it
ſuppoſes its offence forgotten. The cat has only the appearance of
attachment; and it may eaſily be perceived, by its timid approaches, and
ſide-long looks, that it either dreads its maſter, or diſtruſts his
kindneſs: different from the dog, whoſe careſſes are ſincere, the cat
is aſſiduous rather for its own pleaſure, than to pleaſe; and often
gains confidence, only to abuſe it. The form of its <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0823800103:231"/>
body, and its temperament, correſpond with its diſpoſition; active,
cleanly, delicate, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous, it loves its eaſe, and ſeeks the
ſofteſt cuſhions to lie on. 
<q rend="inline">"Many of its habits, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are rather the
conſequences of its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, than the reſult of any perverſeneſs in
its diſpoſition; it is timid and miſtruſtful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its body is
weak, and its ſkin tender; a blow hurts it infinitely more than it does a
dog, whoſe hide is thick and body muſcular; the long fur in which the cat
is cloathed, entirely diſguiſes its ſhape, which, if ſeen naked, is
long, feeble, and ſlender; it is not to be wondered, therefore, that it
appears much more fearful of chaſtiſement than the dog, and often flies,
even when no correction is intended. Being alſo the native of the warmer
climates, as will be ſhewn hereafter, it chuſes the ſofteſt bed to lie
on, which is always the warmeſt."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The cat goes with young fifty-ſix days, and ſeldom brings forth
above five or ſix at a time. The female uſually hides the place of her
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from the male, who is often found to devour her kittens. She feeds
them for ſome weeks with her milk, and whatever ſmall ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals ſhe can
take by ſurprize, accuſtoming them betimes to rapine. Before they are a
year old, they are ſit to engender; the female <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0823800103:232"/> ſeeks
the male with cries; nor is their copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation performed without great pain,
from the narrowneſs of the paſſage in the female. They live to about the
age of ten years; and, during that period, they are extremely vivacious,
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to be worried a long time before they die.</p>
            <p>The young kittens are very playful and amuſing; but their ſport
ſoon turns into malice, and they, from the beginning, ſhew a
diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to cruelty; they often look wiſtfully towards the cage,
ſit centinels at the mouth of a mouſe-hole, and, in a ſhort time, become
more expert hunters, than if they had received the inſtructions of art.
Indeed, their diſpoſition is ſo incapable of conſtraint, that all
inſtruction would be but thrown away. It is true, that we are told of the
Greek monks of the iſle of Cyprus, teaching cats to hunt the ſerpents with
which the iſland is infeſted; but this may be natural to the animal
itſelf, and they might have fallen upon ſuch a purſuit without any
inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whatever animal is much weaker than themſelves, is to them an
indiſcriminate object of deſtruction. Birds, young rabbits, hares, rats and
mice, bats, moles, toads and frogs, are all equally purſued; though not,
perhaps, equally acceptable. The mouſe ſeems to be <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0823800103:233"/>
their favourite game; and, although the cat has the ſenſe of ſmelling in
but a mean degree, it, nevertheleſs, knows thoſe holes in which its prey
reſides. I have ſeen one of them patiently watch an whole day until the
mouſe appeared, and continue quite motionleſs until it came within reach,
and then ſeized it with a jump. Of all the marks by which the cat diſcovers
its natural malignity, that of playing and ſporting with its little captive
before killing it outright, is the moſt flagrant.</p>
            <p>The fixed inclination which they diſcover for this peculiar manner
of purſuit, ariſes from the conformation of their eyes. The pupil in man,
and in moſt other animals, is capable but of a ſmall degree of contraction
and dilatation, it enlarges a little in the dark, and contracts when the light
pours in upon it, in too great quantities. In the eyes of cats, however, this
contraction and dilatation of the pupil, is ſo conſiderable, that the
pupil, which by day-light appears narrow and ſmall, like the black of ones
nail, by night expands over the whole ſurface of the eye-ball, and, as every
one muſt have ſeen, their eyes ſeem on fire. By this peculiar
conformation, their eyes ſee better in darkneſs than light; and the animal
is thus <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0823800103:234"/> better adapted for ſpying out and ſurprizing
its prey.</p>
            <p>Although the cat is an inhabitant of our houſes, yet it cannot
properly be called a dependant; although perfectly tame, yet it acknowledges no
obedience; on the contrary, it does only juſt what it thinks fit, and no art
can controul any of its inclinations. In general, it is but half tamed; and has
its attachments rather to the place in which it reſides, than to the
inhabitant. If the inhabitant quits the houſe, the cat ſtill remains; and
if carried elſewhere, ſeems for a while bewildered with its new
ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. It muſt take time to become acquainted with the holes and
retreats in which its prey reſides, with all the little labyrinths through
which they often make good an eſcape.</p>
            <p>The cat is particularly fearful of water, of cold, and of ill
ſmells. It loves to keep in the ſun, to get near the fire, and to rub
itſelf againſt thoſe who carry perfumes. It is exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively fond of
ſome plants, ſuch as valerian, marum, and cat-mint: againſt theſe it
rubs, ſmells them at a diſtance, and, at laſt, if they be planted in a
garden, wears them out.</p>
            <p>This animal eats ſlowly, and with difficulty, as its teeth are
rather made for tearing, than <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0823800103:235"/> chewing its aliments. For
this reaſon, it loves the moſt tender food, particularly fiſh, which it
eats as well boiled as raw. Its ſleeping is very light; and it often ſeems
to ſleep, the better to deceive its prey. When the cat walks, it treads very
ſoftly, and without the leaſt noiſe; and as to the neceſſities of
nature, it is cleanly to the laſt degree. Its fur alſo is uſually ſleek
and gloſſy; and, for this reaſon, the hair is eaſily electrified,
ſending forth ſhining ſparks, if rubbed in the dark.</p>

                  </note>; and, therefore, the latter
may be conſidered only as a variety of the former: however, they differ in
ſome particulars; the cat, in its ſavage ſtate, is ſomewhat larger than
the houſe-cat; and its fur being longer, gives it a greater appearance than
it really has; its head is bigger, and face flatter; the teeth and claws much
more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable; its muſcles very ſtrong, as being formed for rapine; the
tail is of a moderate length, but very thick and flat, marked with alternate
bars of black and white, the end always black; the hips and hind part of the
lower joints of the leg, are always black; the fur is very ſoft and fine: the
general colour of theſe animals, in England, is a yellowiſh white, mixed
with a <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0823800103:236"/> deep grey. Theſe colours, though they appear at
firſt ſight confuſedly blended together, yet, on a cloſe inſpection,
will be found to be diſpoſed like the ſtreaks on the ſkin of the tiger,
pointing from the back downwards, riſing from a black liſt, that runs from
the head, along the middle of the back, to the tail. This animal is found in
our larger woods; and is the moſt deſtructive of the carnivorous kinds in
this kingdom. It inhabits the moſt mountainous and woody parts of theſe
iſlands, living moſtly in trees, and feeding only by night. It often
happens, that the females of the tame kind go into the woods to ſeek mates
among the wild ones. It ſhould ſeem, that theſe, however, are not
original inhabitants of this kingdom, but were introduced firſt in a
domeſtic ſtate, and afterwards became wild in the woods, by ill uſage or
neglect. Certain it is, the cat was an animal much higher in eſteem among our
anceſtors than it is at preſent. By the laws of Howel, the price of a
kitten, before it could ſee, was to be a penny; till it caught a mouſe, two
pence; and, when it commenced mouſer, four pence: it was required, beſides,
that it ſhould be perfect in its ſenſes of hearing and ſeeing, be a
good mouſer, have the claws whole, and be a good nurſe. If it failed in any
of <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0823800103:237"/> theſe qualities, the ſeller was to forfeit to the
buyer the third part of its value. If any one ſtole or killed the cat that
guarded the prince's granary, he was to forfeit a milch ewe, its fleece and
lamb, or as much wheat as, when poured on the cat ſuſpended by the tail
(the head touching the floor) would form an heap high enough to cover the tip
of the former. From hence we diſcover, beſides a picture of the
ſimplicity of the times, a ſtrong argument that cats were not naturally
bred in our foreſts. An animal that could be ſo eaſily taken, could never
have been rated ſo highly; and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions laid down to improve the
breed, would have been ſuperfluous, in a creature that multiplies to ſuch
an amazing degree. 
<p>"In our climate, we know but of one variety of the wild cat;
and, from the accounts of travellers, we learn, that there are but very few
differences in this quadrupede in all parts of the world. The greateſt
difference, indeed, between the wild and the tame cat, is rather to be found
internally than in their outward form. Of all other quadrupedes, the wild cat
is, perhaps, that whoſe inteſtines are proportionably the ſmalleſt and
the ſhorteſt. The inteſtines of the ſheep, for inſtance, unravelled
out, and meaſured according to their length, will be <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0823800103:238"/>
found to be above thirty times the length of its body; whereas, the wild cat's
inteſtines, being meaſured out, will not be found above three times the
length of its body. This is a ſurprizing difference; but we may account for
it, from the nature of the food in the two animals; the one living upon
vegetables, which requires a longer, and a more tedious preparation, before
they can become a part of its body; the other, living upon fleſh, which
requires very little alteration, in order to be aſſimilated into the
ſubſtance of the creature that feeds upon it. The one, therefore, wanted a
long canal for the properly digeſting and ſtraining its food; the other,
but a ſhort one, as the food is already prepared to paſs the uſual
ſecretions: however, a difficulty ſtill remains behind; the inteſtines of
the wild cat are, by one third, ſhorter than thoſe of the tame. How can we
account for this? If we ſay that the domeſtic cat, living upon more
nouriſhing and more plentiful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, has its inteſtines enlarged to
the quantity with which it is ſupplied, we ſhall find this obſervation
contradicted in the wild boar and the wolf, whoſe inteſtines are as long as
thoſe of the hog or the dog, and yet they lead a ſavage life, and, like the
wild cat, are fed by precarious ſubſiſtence. The ſhortneſs,
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0823800103:239"/> of the wild cat's inteſtines, is ſtill
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accounted for; and moſt naturaliſts conſider the difficulty as
inextricable. We muſt leave it, therefore, as one of thoſe difficulties
which future obſervation or accident are moſt likely to
diſcover."</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This animal is one of thoſe few which are common to the new
continent, as well as the old. When Chriſtopher Columbus firſt
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that country, an hunter brought him one, which he had
diſcovered in the woods, which was of the ordinary ſize, the tail very long
and thick. They were common alſo in Peru, although they were not rendered
domeſtic. They are well known alſo in ſeveral parts of Africa, and many
parts of Aſia. In ſome of theſe countries they are of a peculiar colour,
and inclining to blue. In Perſia, Pietro della Valle informs us, that there
is a kind of cat, particularly in the province of Chorazan, of the figure and
form of the ordinary one, but infinitely more beautiful in the luſtre and
colour of its ſkin. It is of a grey blue, without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and as ſoft and
ſhining as ſilk. The tail is very long, and covered with hair ſix inches
long, which the animal throws upon its back, like the ſquirrel. Theſe cats
are well known in France; and have been brought over into <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0823800103:240"/> England, under the name of the <hi>blue cat,</hi> which, however, is
not their colour.</p>
            <p>Another variety of this animal is called by us the <hi>lion
cat</hi>; or, as others more properly term it, the Cat of Angora. Theſe are
larger than the common cat, and even than the wild one. Their hair is much
longer, and hangs about their head and neck, giving this creature the
appearance of a lion. Some of theſe are white, and others of a dun colour.
Theſe come from Syria and Perſia, two countries which are noted for giving
a long ſoft hair to the animals which are bred in them. The ſheep, the
goats, the dogs and the rabbits of Syria, are all remarkable for the fine
gloſſy length and ſoftneſs of their hair; but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the cat,
whoſe nature ſeems to be ſo inflexible, conforms to the nature of the
climate and ſoil, loſes its ſavage colour, which it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves almoſt
in every other part of the world, and aſſumes the moſt beautiful
appearance. There are ſome other varieties in this animal, but rather in
colour than in form; and, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, it may be remarked, that the cat, when
carried into other countries, alters but very little, ſtill preſerving its
natural manners, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and conformation.</p>

very ſmall<note n="*" place="bottom">This deſcription is principally taken
from Mr. Buffon: ſuch parts as are added from others, I have marked with
commas.</note>; he is found to ſubſiſt in all parts of the earth, as well
under the frozen poles, as beneath the torrid zone: but in animals, the climate
may be conſidered as congenial, and a kind of ſecond nature. They almoſt
all have their particular latitudes, beyond which they are unable to
ſubſiſt; either periſhing with a moderate cold, or dying for want of a
frozen air, even in a temperate climate. The rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deer is never ſeen to
depart from the icy fields of the north; and, on the contrary, the lion
degenerates, when taken from beneath the line. The whole earth is the native
country of man; but all inferior animals, have each their own peculiar
diſtricts.</p>
               <p>Moſt terreſtrial animals are found larger, fiercer, and
ſtronger, in the warm than in the cold or temperate climates. They are alſo
more courageous and enterprizing; all their diſpoſitions ſeeming to

                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0823800103:245"/> the burning ſun of Africa, is, of all others, the
moſt terrible, the moſt undaunted. The wolf or the dog, inſtead of
attempting to rival him, ſcarce deſerve to attend his motions, or become
his providers. Such, however, of theſe animals, as are bred in a more
temperate climate, or towards the tops of cold and lofty mountains, are far
more gentle, or, to ſpeak more properly, far leſs dangerous than thoſe
bred in the torrid vallies beneath. The lions of Mount Atlas, the tops of which
are covered in eternal ſnows, have neither the ſtrength nor the ferocity of
the lions of Bildul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerid or Zaara, where the plains are covered with burning
ſands. It is particularly in theſe frightful deſerts, that thoſe
enormous and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible beaſts are found, that ſeem to be the ſcourge and
the terror of the neighbouring kingdoms. Happily, indeed, the ſpecies is not
very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous; and it ſeems to be diminiſhing daily; for thoſe who have
travelled through theſe countries, aſſure us, that there are by no means
ſo many there at preſent, as were known for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; and Mr. Shaw obſerves,
that the Romans carried fifty times as many lions from Lybia, in one year, to
combat in their amphitheatres, as are to be found in the whole country at this
time. The ſame remark is made with regard <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0823800103:246"/> to Turky, to
Perſia, and the Indies; where the lions are found to diminiſh in their
numbers every day. Nor is it difficult to aſſign the cauſe of this
diminution: it is obvious that it cannot be owing to the encreaſe of the
force of other quadrupedes, ſince they are all inferior to the lion, and,
conſequently, inſtead of leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening the number, only tend to encreaſe
the ſupplies on which they ſubſiſt; it muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be
occaſioned by the encreaſe of mankind, who is the only animal in nature
capable of making head againſt theſe tyrants of the foreſt, and
preventing their encreaſe. The arms even of an Hottentot or a Negroe make
them more than a match for this powerful creature; and they ſeldom make the
attack, without coming off victorious. Their uſual manner is to find out his
retreat, and, with ſpears headed with iron, to provoke him to the combat:
four men are conſidered as ſufficient for this encounter; and he againſt
whom the lion flies, receives him upon his ſpear, while the others attack him
behind; the lion, finding himſelf wounded in the rear, turns that way, and
thus gives the man he firſt attacked, an opportunity to recover. In this
manner they attack him on all ſides; until, at laſt, they entirely
diſable, and then diſpatch him. This ſuperiority in the numbers, 
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0823800103:247"/> and the arts of man, that are ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
the lion, ſerve alſo to enervate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him; for he is brave
only in proportion to the ſucceſs of his former encounters. In the vaſt
deſerts of Zaara, in the burning ſands that lie between Mauritania and
Negroland, in the uninhabited countries that lie to the north of Cafraria, and,
in general, in all the deſerts of Africa, where man has not fixed his
habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the lions are found in great numbers, and preſerve their natural
courage and force. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to meaſure their ſtrength with every
animal they meet, the habit of conquering ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them intrepid and terrible.
Having never experienced the dangerous arts and combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of man, they have
no apprehenſions from his power. They boldly face him, and ſeem to brave
the force of his arms. Wounds rather ſerve to provoke their rage than
repreſs their ardour. They are not daunted even with the oppoſition of
numbers; a ſingle lion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert often attacks an entire caravan; and,
after an obſtinate combat, when he finds himſelf overpowered, inſtead of
flying, he continues to combat, retreating, and ſtill facing the enemy till
he dies. On the contrary, the lions which inhabit the peopled countries of
Morocco or India, having become acquainted with human <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0823800103:248"/>
power, and experienced man's ſuperiority, have loſt all their courage, ſo
as to be ſcared away with a ſhout; and ſeldom attack any but the
unreſiſting flocks or herds, which even women and children are ſufficient
to protect.</p>
               <p>This alteration in the lion's diſpoſition ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
ſhews that he might eaſily be tamed, and admit of a certain degree of
educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 
<q rend="inline">"In fact, nothing is more common than for the
keepers of wild beaſts to play with this animal, to pull out his tongue, and
even to chaſtiſe him without a cauſe. He ſeems to bear it all with the
utmoſt compoſure; and we very rarely have inſtances of his reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe unprovoked ſallies of impertinent cruelty. However, when his anger is
at laſt excited, the conſequences are terrible. Labat tells us of a
gentleman who kept a lion in his chamber, and employed a ſervant to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it; who, as is uſual, mix'd his blows with careſſes. This ill-judged
aſſociation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome time; till one morning the gentleman was
awakened by a noiſe in his room, which, at firſt, he could not tell the
cauſe of; but, drawing the curtains, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an horrid ſpectacle; the
lion growling over the man's head, which he had ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the body, and
toſſing it round the <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0823800103:249"/> floor. He immediately,
therefore, flew into the next room, called to the people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and had the
animal ſecured from doing further miſchief."</q> However, this ſingle
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is not ſufficient to weigh againſt the many inſtances we every
day ſee of this creature's gentleneſs and ſubmiſſion. He is often
bred up with other domeſtic animals, and is ſeen to play innocently and
familiarly among them; and, if it ever happens that his natural ferocity
returns, it is ſeldom exerted againſt his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors. As his paſſions
are ſtrong, and his appetites vehement, one ought not to preſume that the
impreſſions of education will always prevail; ſo that it would be
dangerous in ſuch circumſtances to ſuffer him to remain too long without
food, or to perſiſt in irritating and abuſing him: however, numberleſs,
accounts aſſure us that his anger is noble, his courage magnanimous, and
his diſpoſition grateful. He has been often ſeen to deſpiſe
contemptible enemies, and pardon their inſults when it was in his power to
puniſh them. He has been ſeen to ſpare the lives of ſuch as were thrown
to be devoured by him, to live peaceably with them, to afford them a part of
his ſubſiſtence, and ſometimes to want food himſelf rather than
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of that life which his generoſity had ſpared.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0823800103:250"/>It may alſo be ſaid that the lion is not
cruel, ſince he is ſo only from neceſſity, and never kills more than he
conſumes. When ſatiated, he is perfectly gentle; while the tiger, the wolf,
and all the inferior kinds, ſuch as the fox, the pole-cat, and the ferret,
kill without remorſe, are fierce without cauſe, and, by their
indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate ſlaughter, ſeem rather to ſatisfy their malignity than
their hunger.</p>
               <p>The outward form of the lion ſeems to ſpeak his internal
generoſity. His figure is ſtriking, his look confident and bold, his gait
proud, and his voice terrible. His ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not overgrown, like that of
the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, or rhinoceros; nor is his ſhape clumſy, like that of the
hippopotamos, or the ox. It is compact, well proportioned, and ſizeable; a
perfect model of ſtrength joined with agility. It is muſcular and bold,
neither charged with fat or unneceſſary fleſh. It is ſufficient but to
ſee him in order to be aſſured of his ſuperior force. His large head
ſurrounded with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mane; all thoſe muſcles that appear under the
ſkin ſwelling with the ſlighteſt exertions; and the great breadth of
his paws, with the thickneſs of his limbs, plainly evince that no other
animal in the foreſt is capable of oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. He has a very broad face
that, as ſome have imagined, reſembles the human. It <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0823800103:251"/>
is ſurrounded with very long hair, which gives it a very majeſtic air. The
top of the head, the temples, the cheeks, the under jaw, the neck, the
breaſt, the ſhoulder, the hinder part of the legs, and the belly, are
furniſhed with it, while all the reſt of the body is covered with very
ſhort hair, of a tawny colour. 
<q rend="inline">"The length of the hair in many parts, and the
ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it in others, ſerves a good deal to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe this
animal's real figure. The breaſt, for inſtance, appears very broad, but in
reality it is as narrow and contracted in proportion as that of the generality
of dogs and horſes. For the ſame reaſon, the tail ſeems to be of an
equal thickneſs from one end to the other, on account of the inequality of
the hair with which it is encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed; it being ſhorter near the
inſertion where the fleſh and bones are large, and growing longer in
proportion as its real thickneſs leſſens towards the point, where it ends
in a tuft. The hair about the neck and breaſt is not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that on
the reſt of the body, except in the length of it; nor is each hair pointed as
in moſt other animals, but of an equal thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from one end to the
other. The neck is very ſtrong, but not compoſed of one ſolid bone, as
Ariſtotle has imagined; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, though very ſhort and muſcular,
it has <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0823800103:252"/> as many bones as the camel or the horſe; for it
is univerſal to all quadrupedes to have ſeven joints in the neck; and not
one of them have either more or leſs. However, the muſcles in the neck of
the lion, that tye the bones toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are extremely ſtrong, and have
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the appearance of bones; ſo that ancient authors, who have
treated of this animal, have miſtaken the whole for a ſingle bone. The
tongue is rough, and beſet with prickles as hard as a cat's claws; theſe
have the grain turned backwards; ſo that it is probable a lion, if it
ſhould attempt to lick a man's hand, as we are told it ſometimes does,
would tear off the ſkin. The eyes are always bright and fiery; nor even in
death does this terrible look forſake them. In ſhort, the ſtructure of
the paws, teeth, eyes, and tongue, are the ſame as in a cat; and alſo in
the inward parts theſe two ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals ſo nearly reſemble each other, that
the anatomiſt's chief diſtinction ariſes merely from the ſize."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The lion has, as was obſerved before, a large mane, which grows
every year longer as the animal grows older: the lioneſs is without this
ornament at every age. This mane is not coarſe or rough as in an horſe, but
compoſed of the ſame hair with the reſt of the body, lengthened, 
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0823800103:253"/> and ſhining. The mane, as well as the reſt of the
body, is of a yellow colour; nor is there ever any difference to be found in
the colour of one lion from that of another. What the ancients might have
ſaid concerning black lions, or white, or ſtreaked like the tiger, is not
confirmed by modern experience; ſo that theſe varieties have never been
ſeen, or exiſt no longer.</p>
               <p>It is uſually ſuppoſed that the lion is not
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the ſenſe of ſmelling in ſuch perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as
moſt other animals. It is alſo obſerved, that too ſtrong a light
greatly incommodes him. This is more than probable from the formation of his
eyes, which, like thoſe of the cat, ſeem fitted for ſeeing beſt in the
dark. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he ſeldom appears in open day, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages chiefly
by night; and not only the lion, but all other animals of the cat kind, are
kept off by the fires which the inhabitants light to preſerve their herds and
flocks; the brightneſs of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lame dazzles their eyes, which are only fitted for ſeeing in the
dark; and they are afraid to venture blindly into thoſe places which they
know to be filled with their enemies. 
<q rend="inline">"It is equally true of all this kind, that they
hunt rather by the ſight than the ſmell; and it ſometimes happens that
the lion purſues either <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0823800103:254"/> the jackall or the wild dog,
while they are hunting upon the ſcent; and, when they have run the beaſt
down, he comes in and monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizes the ſpoil. From hence, probably, may have
ariſen the ſtory of the lion's provider: theſe little induſtrious
animals may often, it is true, provide a feaſt for the lion; but they have
hunted merely for themſelves, and he is an unwelcome intruder upon the fruits
of their toil."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The lion, when hungry, boldly attacks all animals that come in his
way; but, as he is very formidable, and as they all ſeek to avoid him, he is
often obliged to hide, in order to take them by ſurprize. For this purpoſe
he crouches on his belly, in ſome thicket, or among the long graſs, which
is found in many parts of the foreſt; in this retreat he continues, with
patient expectation, until his prey comes within a proper diſtance, and he
then ſprings after it, fifteen or twenty feet from him, and often ſeizes it
at the firſt bound. If he miſſes the effort, and in two or three
reiterated ſprings cannot ſeize his prey, he continues motionleſs for a
time, ſeems to be very ſenſible of his diſappointment, and waits for a
more ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful opportunity. In the deſerts and foreſts, his moſt
uſual prey are the gazelles and the <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0823800103:255"/> monkeys, with
which the torrid regions abound. The latter he takes when they happen to be
upon the ground, for he cannot climb trees like the cat or the tiger. He
devours a great deal at a time, and generally fills himſelf for two or three
days to come. His teeth are ſo ſtrong that he very eaſily breaks the
bones, and ſwallows them with the reſt of the body. It is reported that he
ſuſtains hunger a very long time, but thirſt he cannot ſupport in an
equal degree, his temperament being extremely hot; ſome have even
aſſerted that he is in a continual fever. He drinks as often as he meets
with water, lapping it like a cat; which, as we know, drinks but ſlowly. He
generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires about fifteen pound of raw fleſh in a day; he prefers
that of live animals, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe which he has juſt killed. He
ſeldom devours the bodies of animals when they begin to putrify; and he
chuſes rather to hunt for a freſh ſpoil than to return to that which he
had half devoured before. However, though he uſually feeds upon freſh
proviſion, his breath is very offenſive, and his urine
inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable.</p>
               <p>The roaring of the lion is ſo loud, that when it is heard in the
night, and re-echoed by the mountains, it reſembles diſtant thunder. This 
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0823800103:256"/> roar is his natural note; for when enraged he has a
different growl, which is ſhort, broken, and reiterated. The roar is a deep
hollow growl, which he ſends forth five or ſix times a day, particularly
before rains. The cry of anger is much louder and more formidable. This is
always excited by oppoſition; and upon thoſe occaſions, when the lion
ſummons up all his terrors for the combat, nothing can be more terrible. He
then laſhes his ſides with his long tail, which alone is ſtrong enough to
lay a man level. He moves his mane in every direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it ſeems to riſe
and ſtand like briſtles round his head; the ſkin and muſcles of his
face are all in agitation; his huge eye-brows half cover his glaring eye balls;
he diſcovers his teeth, which are formed rather for deſtruction than
chewing his food; he ſhews his tongue covered with points, and extends his
claws, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear almoſt as long as a man's fingers. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in this
manner for war, there are few ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals that will venture to engage him; and
even the boldeſt of the human kind are daunted at his approach. The elephant,
the rhinoceros, the tiger, and the hippopotamos, are the only animals that are
not afraid ſingly to make op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0823800103:257"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Nevertheleſs, neither the leopard nor the wild
boar, if provoked, will ſhun the combat; they do not ſeek the lion to
attack, but will not fly at his approach; they wait his onſet, which he
ſeldom makes unleſs compelled by hunger; they then exert all their
ſtrength, and are ſometimes ſucceſsful. We are told of the combat of a
lion and a wild boar, in a meadow near Algiers, which continued for a long time
with incredible obſtinacy. At laſt, both were ſeen to fall by the wounds
they had given each other; and the ground all about them was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with
their blood. Theſe inſtances how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are very rare, for the lion is in
general the undiſputed maſter of the foreſt. Man is the only creature
that attacks him with almoſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſucceſs; with the aſſiſtance
of dogs and horſes, which are trained to the purſuit. Theſe animals that,
in a ſtate of nature, would have fled from the preſence of the lion, in an
agony of conſternation, when conſcious of the aſſiſtance of man,
become purſuers in turn, and boldly hunt their natural tyrant. The dogs are
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of the large breed; and the horſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as Gaſner
aſſures us, muſt be of that ſort called Charoſſi, or lion eyed, all
others of this kind flying at the ſight of the lion, and 
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0823800103:258"/> endeavouring to throw their riders. When the lion is
rouzed, he recedes with a ſlow proud motion; he never goes off directly
forward, nor meaſures his paces equally, but takes an oblique courſe, going
from one ſide to the other, and bounding rather than running. When the
hunters approach him, they either ſhoot or throw their javelins; and in this
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſable him before he is attacked by the dogs, many of whom he would
otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. He is very vivacious, and is never killed at once, but
continues to fight deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately even after he has received his mortal blow.
He is alſo taken by pit-falls; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives digging a deep hole in the
ground, and covering it ſlightly over with ſticks and earth; which,
however, give way beneath his weight, and he ſinks to the bottom, from whence
he has no means of eſcape. But the moſt uſual manner of taking this
animal is while yet a cub, and incapable of reſiſtance. The place near the
den of the lioneſs is generally well known by the greatneſs of her
depredations on that occaſion; the natives, therefore, watch the time of her
abſence and, aided by a ſwift horſe, carry off her cubs; which they
ſell to ſtrangers, or to the great men of their country."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:0823800103:259"/>The lion, while young and active, lives by
hunting in the foreſt at the greateſt diſtance from any human habitation;
and ſeldom quits this retreat while able to ſubſiſt by his natural
induſtry; but when he becomes old, and unfit for the purpoſes of
ſurprize, he boldly comes down into places more frequented, attacks the
flocks and herds that take ſhelter near the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of the ſhepherd or
the huſbandman, and depends rather upon his courage than his addreſs for
ſupport. It is remarkable, however, that when he makes one of theſe
deſperate ſallies, if he finds men and quadrupedes in the ſame field, he
only attacks the latter, and never meddles with men, unleſs they provoke him
to engage. It is obſerved that he prefers the fleſh of camels to any other
food; he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſaid to be fond of that of young elephants; theſe
he often attacks before their trunk is yet grown; and, unleſs the old
elephant comes to their aſſiſtance, he makes them an eaſy prey.</p>
               <p>The lion is terrible upon all occaſions, but particularly at
thoſe ſeaſons when he is incited by deſire, or when the female has
brought forth. It is then that the lioneſs is ſeen followed by eight or ten
males, who ſight moſt bloody battles among each other, till one of them
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0823800103:260"/> victorious over all the reſt. She is ſaid
to bring forth in ſpring, and to produce but once a year. 
<q rend="inline">"With reſpect to the time of geſtation,
naturaliſts have been divided, ſome aſſerting that the lioneſs went
with young ſix months, and others but two. The time alſo of their growth
and their age have hitherto been left in obſcurity; ſome aſſerting that
they acquired their full growth in three years, and others that they required a
longer period to come to perfection; ſome ſaying (and among this number is
Mr. Buffon) that they lived to but twenty, or twenty-two years at moſt;
others making their lives even of ſhorter duration. All theſe doubts are
now reduced to certainty; for we have had ſeveral of theſe animals bred in
the Tower; ſo that the manner of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, the time of their
geſtation, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they bring forth, and the time they take to come to
perfection, are all pretty well known. Although the lion emits his urine
backwards, yet he couples in the ordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and, as was ſaid before,
his internal ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in almoſt every reſpect reſembles that of a
cat. The lioneſs, however, is upon theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions particularly fierce,
and often wounds the lion in a terrible manner. She goes with young, 
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0823800103:261"/> as I am aſſured by her keeper, no more than five
months; the young ones, which are never more than two in number when brought
forth, are about the ſize of a large pug dog, harmleſs, pretty, and
playful; they continue the teat for twelve months, and the animal is more than
five years in coming to perfection. As to its age, from its impriſoned
ſtate, we can have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; ſince it is very probable that, being
deprived of its natural climate, food, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, its life muſt be very
much abridged. However, naturaliſts have hitherto been greatly miſtaken as
to the length of its exiſtence. The great he-lion, called Pompey, which died
in the year 1760, was known to have been in the Tower for above ſeventy
years; and one lately died there, which was brought from the river Gambia, that
died above ſixty-three. The lion, therefore, is a very long-lived animal;
and, very probably, in his native foreſts, his age exceeds even that of man
himſelf."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this animal, all the paſſions, even of the moſt gentle
kind, are in exceſs, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the attachment of the female to her
young. The lioneſs, though naturally leſs ſtrong, leſs courageous, and
leſs miſchievous than the lion, becomes terrible when ſhe has got young
ones <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0823800103:262"/> to provide for. She then makes her incurſions
with even more intrepidity than the lion him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſhe throws herſelf
indiſcriminately among men and other animals; deſtroys without
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; loads herſelf with the ſpoil, and brings it home reaking to
her cubs; whom ſhe accuſtoms betimes to cruelty and ſlaughter. She
uſually brings forth in the moſt retired and inacceſſible places; and
when ſhe fears to have her retreat diſcovered, often hides her tracks, by
running back her ground, or by bruſhing them out with her tail. She
ſometimes alſo, when her apprehenſions are great, tranſports them from
one place to another; and, if ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, defends them with determined
cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and fights to the laſt.</p>
               <p>The lion is chiefly an inhabitant of the torrid zone; and, as was
ſaid, is always moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable there: nevertheleſs, he can
ſubſiſt in more temperate climates; and there was a time when even the
ſouthern parts of Europe were infeſted by him. At preſent, he is only
found in Africa and the Eaſt-Indies; in ſome of which countries he grows to
an enormous height. The lion of Bildulgedid is ſaid to be nearly five feet
high, and between nine and ten feet from the tip of the noſe to the
inſertion of the tail. <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0823800103:263"/> We have in the Tower, at
preſent, one of above four feet high, that was brought from Morocco, which is
the largeſt that for ſome time paſt has been ſeen in Europe. The
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſize is between three and four feet; the female being in all her
dimenſions about one third leſs than the male. There are no lions in
America; the Puma, which has received the name of the America Lion, is, when
compared, a very contemptible animal, having neither the ſhape, the ſize,
nor the mane of the lion; being known to be extremely cowardly, to climb trees
for its prey, to ſubſiſt rather by its cunning than its courage, and to
be inferior even to the animal that goes by the name of the American Tiger. We
ought not, therefore, to confound this little treacherous creature with the
lion, which all the ancients have concurred in deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating the king of
beaſts, and which they have deſcribed as brave and merciful. 
<q rend="inline">"In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the numerous accounts which they have
given us of this animal's generoſity and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhew that there
muſt be ſome foundation for the general belief of its good qualities; for
mankind ſeldom err when they are all found to unite in the ſame ſtory.

the bright yellow colour of the ground which they diverſify, at once ſtrike
the beholder. To this beauty of colouring is added an extremely elegant form,
much larger indeed than that of the leopard, but more ſlender, more delicate,
and beſpeaking the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſwiftneſs and agility. Unhappily,

indulgence can tame."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The chief and moſt obſervable diſtinction in the tiger, and
in which it differs from all others of the mottled kind, is in the ſhape of
its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which run in ſtreaks or bands in the ſame direction as his
ribs from the back down to the belly. The leopard, the panther, and the ounce,
are all partly covered like this animal, but with this difference, that their
colours are broken in ſpots all over the body; whereas in the tiger they
ſtretch lengthwiſe, and there is ſcarce a round ſpot to be found on his
ſkin. Beſides this there are other obſervable diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: the tiger
is much larger, and often found bigger even than the lion himſelf: it is much
ſlenderer alſo in proportion to its ſize; its legs ſhorter, and its
neck and body longer. In ſhort, of all other animals, it moſt reſembles
the cat in ſhape; and, if we conceive the latter <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0823800103:269"/>
magnified to a very great degree, we ſhall have a tolerable idea of the
former.</p>
               <p>In claſſing carnivorous animals, we may place the lion
foremoſt<note n="*" place="bottom">The remainder of this deſcription is taken
from Mr. Buffon, except where marked with commas.</note>; and immediately after
him follows the tiger, which ſeems to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of all the noxious qualities
of the lion without ſharing any of his good ones. To pride, courage, and
ſtrength, the lion joins greatneſs, clemency, and generoſity; but the
tiger is fierce without provocation, and cruel without neceſſity. The lion
ſeldom ravages except when excited by hunger; the tiger, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
though glutted with ſlaughter, is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, ſtill continues the
carnage, and ſeems to have its courage only enflamed by not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſiſtance. In falling in among a flock or an herd, it gives no quarter,
but levels all with indiſcriminate cruelty, and ſcarce finds time to
appeaſe its appetite while intent upon ſatisfying the malignity of its
nature. It thus becomes the ſcourge of the country where it is found; it
fears neither the threats nor the oppoſition of mankind; the beaſts both
wild and tame fall equally a ſacrifice to its inſatiable fury; the young
elephant and the rhinoceros become <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0823800103:270"/> equally its prey, and
it not unfrequently ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to attack the lion himſelf.</p>
               <p>Happily for the reſt of nature, that this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is not common,
and that the ſpecies is chiefly confined to the warmeſt provinces of the
eaſt. The tiger is found in Malabar, in Siam, in Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and in all the
ſame countries which are inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the elephant or the rhinoceros. Some
even pretend that it has a friendſhip for, and often accompanies the latter,
in order to devour its excrements, which ſerve it as a purge. Be this as it
will, there is no doubt but that they are often ſeen together at the ſides
of lakes and rivers; where they are probably both compelled to go by the
thirſt which in that torrid climate they muſt very often endure. It is
likely enough alſo that they ſeldom make war upon each other, the
rhinoceros being a peaceable animal, and the tiger knowing its ſtrength too
well to venture the engagement. It is ſtill more likely that the tiger finds
this a very convenient ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, ſince it can there ſurprize a greater
num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of animals, which are compelled thither from the ſame motives. In
fact, it is generally known to lurk near ſuch places where it has an
opportunity of chuſing its prey, or rather of multiplying its maſſacres.
When it has <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0823800103:271"/> killed one it often goes to deſtroy
others, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their blood at large draughts, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather
glutted than ſatiated with its abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>However, when it has killed a large ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, ſuch as an horſe,
or a buffalo, it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately begins to devour it on the ſpot, fearing to be
diſturbed. In order to feaſt at its eaſe, it carries off its prey to the
foreſt, dragging it along with ſuch eaſe, that the ſwiftneſs of its
motion ſeems ſcarce retarded by the enormous load it ſuſtains. From
this alone we may judge of its ſtrength; but, to have a more juſt idea of
this particular, let us ſtop a moment to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the dimenſions of this
moſt formidable creature. Some travellers have compared it for ſize to an
horſe, and others to a buffalo, while others have contented themſelves with
ſaying that it was much larger than a lion. We have recent accounts of this
animal's magnitude that deſerve the utmoſt confidence. Mr. Buffon has been
aſſured by one of his friends that he ſaw a tiger, in the Eaſt-Indies,
of fifteen feet long. 
<q rend="inline">"Suppoſing that he means including the tail,
this animal, allowing four feet for that, muſt have been eleven feet from the
tip of the noſe to the inſertion of the tail. Indeed, that which is now in
the Tower is not ſo large, being as <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0823800103:272"/> well as I could
meaſure ſix feet from the tip to the inſertion, and the tail was three
feet more. Like all the reſt of its kind, its motions are irregular and
defaltory; it bounds rather than runs; and like them rather chuſes to take
its prey by ſurprize than to be at the trouble of hunting it down."</q> How
large a leap it can take at once we may eaſily judge, by comparing what it
might do to what we ſee ſo ſmall an animal as the cat actually perform.
The cat can leap ſeveral feet at a bound; and the tiger, who is ten times as
long, can no doubt ſpring proportionably.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">"The tiger is the only animal whoſe ſpirit
ſeems untameable. Neither force nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, neither violence nor
flattery, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the leaſt on its ſtubborn nature. The
careſſes of the keeper have no influence on their heart of iron; and time,
inſtead of mollifying its diſpoſition, only ſerves to encreaſe its
fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and malignity. The tiger ſnaps at the hand that feeds it as
well as that by which it is chaſtiſed; every object ſeems conſidered
only as its proper prey, which it devours with a look; and, although confined
by bars and chains, ſtill makes fruitleſs efforts, as if to ſhew its
malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity when incapable of exerting its force."</q>

                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0823800103:273"/>To give a ſtill more complete idea of the
ſtrength of this terrible creature, we ſhall quote a paſſage from
Father Tachard, who was an eye-witneſs of a combat between a tiger and two
elephants at Siam. For this purpoſe, the king ordered a lofty paliſade to
be built of bambou cane, about an hundred feet ſquare; and in the midſt of
this were three elephants appointed for combating the tiger. Their heads and a
part of their trunk was covered with a kind of armour, like a maſk, which
defended that part from the aſſaults of the fierce animal with which they
were to engage. As ſoon, ſays this author, as we were arrived at the place,
a tiger was brought forth from its den, of a ſize much larger than we had
ever ſeen before. It was not at firſt let looſe, but held with chords,
ſo that one of the elephants approaching, gave it three or four terrible
blows, with its trunk, on the back, with ſuch force, that the tiger was for
ſome time ſtunned, and lay without motion, as if it had been dead. However,
as ſoon as it was let looſe, and at full liberty, although the firſt
blows had greatly abated its fury, it made at the elephant with a loud
ſhriek, and aimed at ſeizing his trunk. But the elephant, wrinkling it up
with great dexterity, received the tiger on his great teeth, and toſſed it
up into the air. <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0823800103:274"/> This ſo diſcouraged the furious
animal, that it no more ventured to approach the elephant, but made ſeveral
circuits round the palliſade, often attempting to fly at the ſpectators.
Shortly after, three elephants were ſent againſt it, and they continued to
ſtrike it ſo terribly with their trunks, that it once more lay for dead;
and they would certainly have killed it, had not there been a ſtop put to the
combat.</p>
               <p>From this account, we may readily judge of the ſtrength of this
animal, which, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to captivity, and held by chords, though firſt
diſabled, and ſet alone againſt three, yet ventured to continue the
engagement, and even that againſt animals covered and protected from its
fury.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Captain Hamilton informs us, that in the Sundah
Rajha's dominions there are three forts of tigers in the woods, and that the
ſmalleſt are the fierceſt. This is not above two feet high, appears to be
extremely cunning, and delights in human fleſh. The ſecond kind is about
three feet high, and hunts deer and wild hogs, beſides the little animal
which has been already deſcribed, under the name of the Chevrotain, or Guinea
deer. The tiger of the largeſt ſort, is above three feet and an half high;
but, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though endued with greater powers, is, by no <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0823800103:275"/>
means, ſo rapacious as either of the former. This formidable animal, which is
called the Royal Tiger (one of which we have at preſent in the Tower) does
not ſeem ſo ravenous nor ſo dangerous, and is even more cowardly. A
peaſant in that country, as this traveller in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, had a buffalo fallen
into a quagmire, and, while he went for aſſiſtance, there came a large
tiger, that, with its ſingle ſtrength, drew forth the animal, which the
united force of many men could not effect. When the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the
place, the firſt object they beheld was the tiger, who had thrown the buffalo
over its ſhoulder, as a fox does a gooſe, and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it away, with
the feet upward, towards its den; however, as ſoon as it ſaw the men, it
let fall its prey, and inſtantly fled to the woods: but it had previouſly
killed the buffalo, and ſucked its blood; and, no doubt, the people were very
well ſatisfied with its retreat. It may be obſerved, that ſome
Eaſt-Indian buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faloes weigh above a thouſand pounds, which is twice as
heavy as the ordinary run of our black cattle; ſo that from hence we may form
a conception of the enormous ſtrength of this rapacious animal, that could
thus run off with a weight at leaſt twice as great as that of itſelf. 
<p>
                        <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0823800103:276"/>"Were this animal as common as the
panther, or even as the lion himſelf, thus fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as it is with the
power to deſtroy, and the appetite for ſlaughter, the country would be
uninhabitable where it reſides. But luckily the ſpecies is extremely
ſcarce; and has been ſo ſince the earlieſt accounts we have had of the
tiger. About the times of Auguſtus, we are aſſured by Pliny<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <bibl>Plin. Hiſt. Nat. lib. viii. c. 17.</bibl>
                        </note>, that
when panthers were brought to Rome by hundreds, a ſingle tiger was
conſidered as an extraordinary ſight; and he tells us, that the emperor
Claudius was able to procure four only; which ſhews how difficultly they were
procured. The incredible fierceneſs of this animal may be, in ſome
mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the cauſe of the ſcarcity which was then at Rome, ſince it
was the opinion of Varo, that the tiger was never taken alive<note n="†" place="bottom"> 
                           <q rend="inline">Tigris vivus capi ad huc non potuit.

                           </q>
                        </note>: but its being a
native only of the Eaſt-Indies, and that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the warmer regions,
it is not to be wondered that the ſpecies ſhould be ſo few."</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We may, therefore, conſider the ſpecies of true ſtreaked
tiger, as one of the ſcarceſt of animals, and much leſs diffuſed than
that of the lion. As to the number of its young, we have <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0823800103:277"/>
no certain accounts; however, it is ſaid, that it brings forth four or five
at a time. Although furious at all times, the female, upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
exceeds her uſual rapacity; and, if her young are taken from her, ſhe
purſues the ſpoiler with incredible rage; he, to ſave a part, is
contented to loſe a part, and drops one of her cubs, with which ſhe
immediately returns to her den, and again purſues him; he then drops another,
and by the time ſhe has returned with that, he generally eſcapes with the
remainder. If ſhe loſes her young entirely, ſhe then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
deſperate, boldly approaches even the towns themſelves, and commits
incredible ſlaughter. The tiger expreſſes its reſentment in the ſame
manner with the lion; it moves the muſcles and ſkin of its face, ſhews
its teeth, and ſhrieks in the moſt frightful manner. Its note is very
different from that of the lion; being rather a ſcream than a roar: and the
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients expreſſed it very well, when they ſaid that, 
<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>tigrides indomitae rancant rugiunt que
leones.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſkin of theſe animals is much eſteemed all over the
eaſt, particularly in China; the Mandarines cover their ſeats of juſtice
in the public places with it, and convert it into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings for cuſhions in
winter. In Europe, theſe ſkins, though but ſeldom to be met with, 
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0823800103:278"/> are of no great value, thoſe of the panther and the
leopard being held in much greater eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. This is all the little
benefit we derive from this dreadful animal, of which ſo many falſehoods
have been reported; as, that its ſweat was poiſonous, and the hair of its
whiſkers more dangerous than an envenomed arrow. But the real miſchiefs
which the tiger occaſions while living are ſufficient, without giving
ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary ones to the parts of its body when dead. In fact, the Indians
ſometimes eat its fleſh, and find it neither diſagreeable nor
unwholſome.</p>
               <p>There is an animal of America, which is uſually called the Red
Tiger, but Mr. Buffon calls it the Cougar, which, no doubt, is very different
from the tiger of the eaſt. Some, however, have thought proper to rank both
together; and I will take leave to follow their example, merely becauſe the
cougar is more like a tiger in every thing, except the colour, than any other
animal I know, having the head, the body and the neck, ſhaped very much in
the ſame manner. Of theſe ſlight differences, words would give but a very
faint idea; it will be, therefore, ſufficient to obſerve, that they are
both equally ſlender, and are ſmaller where the neck joins the head, than
others of the panther kind. There is one at <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0823800103:279"/> preſent in
the Tower; and it ſeemed to me, as well as I could ſee it through the bars,
that were it properly ſtreaked and coloured, it would in all things
reſemble a ſmall tiger. It is, however, of a very different colour, being
of a deep brown, and the tail very long and pointed. It is rather darker on the
back; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the chin it is a little whitiſh, as alſo on the lower part of
the belly.</p>
               <p>Of all the American animals, this is the moſt formidable and
miſchievous; even their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended lion not excepted. It is ſaid, there are
ſeveral ſorts of them; and, as well as I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I have ſeen one
or two here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, both differing from the preſent, in ſize and
conformation. It is, indeed, a vain endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to attempt to deſcribe all the
leſs obvious varieties in the cat kind. If we examine them minutely, we
ſhall find the differences multiply upon us ſo much, that, inſtead of an
hiſtory, we ſhall only be paid with a catalogue of diſtinctions. From
ſuch of them as I have ſeen, within theſe laſt ſix years, I think I
could add two animals of this ſpecies, that have not been hitherto
deſcribed, and with the names of which he that ſhewed them was utterly
unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. But it is a poor ambition, that of being eager to find out new
diſtinctions, or <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0823800103:280"/> adding one noxious animal more, to a
liſt that is already ſufficiently numerous. Were the knowing a new variety
to open an unknown hiſtory, or in the leaſt to extend our knowledge, the
enquiry would be then worth purſuing; but what ſignifies mentioning ſome
trifling differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and from thence becoming authors of a new name, when the
difference might have ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally proceeded either from climate, ſoil, or
indiſcriminate copulation?</p>
               <p>The cougars are extremely common in South America, and, where the
towns border upon the foreſt, theſe make frequent incurſions by night
into the midſt of the ſtreets, carrying off fowls, dogs, and other
domeſtic creatures. They are, however, but weak and contemptible, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the great tiger, being found unable to cope with a ſingle man. The Negroes
and Indians are very dextrous in encountering them; and ſome, even for the
ſake of their ſkins, ſeek them in their retreats. The arms in this
combat, ſeemingly ſo dangerous, are only a launce of two or three yards
long, made of heavy wood, with the point hardened in the fire; and a kind of
ſcymitar, of about three quarters of a yard in length. Thus armed, they wait
till the tiger makes an aſſault againſt the left hand, which holds the
lance, and is <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0823800103:281"/> wrapped up in a ſhort cloak of baize.
Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the animal, aware of the danger, ſeems to decline the combat; but
then its antagoniſt provokes it with a ſlight touch of the launce, in
order, while he is defending himſelf, to ſtrike a ſure blow. As ſoon,
therefore, as the creature feels the lance, it graſps it with one of its
paws, and with the other ſtrikes at the arm which holds it. Then it is that
the perſon nimbly aims a blow with his ſcymetar, which he kept concealed,
with the other hand, and hamſtrings the creature, which immediately draws
back enraged, but inſtantly returns to the charge. But then, receiving
another ſtroke, it is totally deprived of the power of motion: and the
combatant, killing it at his leiſure, ſtrips the ſkin, cuts off the head,
and returns to his companions, diſplaying theſe as the trophies of his
victory.</p>
               <p>This animal, as we are aſſured, is often more ſucceſsful
againſt the crocodile; and it is the only quadrupede in that part of the
world, that is not afraid of the engagement. It muſt be no unpleaſant
ſight to obſerve, from a place of ſafety, this extraordinary combat,
between ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals ſo terrible and obnoxious to man. Such as have ſeen it,
deſcribe it in the following manner. When the tiger, impelled by thirſt, 
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0823800103:282"/> that ſeems continually to conſume it, comes down to
the river ſide to drink, the crocodile, which makes no diſtinction in its
prey, lifts its head above water to ſeize it; the tiger, not leſs rapacious
than the other, and unacquainted with the force of the enemy, boldly ventures
to ſeize it, and plunges its claws into the eyes of the crocodile, which is
the only vulnerable part of its body: upon this the crocodile inſtantly dives
under water, and the tiger goes down with him, for it will ſooner die than
let go its hold. In this manner the combat continues for ſome time, until the
tiger is drowned, or eſcapes, as is ſometimes the caſe, from its
diſabled enemy.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals are common in Guiana<note n="*" place="bottom">

ſeen ſwimming over, in great numbers, into the iſland of Cayenne, to
attack and ravage the flocks and herds of the inhabitants. In the beginning,
they were a terrible ſcourge to the infant colony; but, by degrees, they were
repulſed and deſtroyed, and are now ſeen no longer at that place. They
are found in Brazil, in Paraguay, in the country of the Amazons, and in
ſeveral other parts of South America. They often climb trees in queſt of
prey, or to avoid their purſuers. They <pb facs="tcp:0823800103:283"/>

venture near thoſe places where they ſee it kindled, as they are always
ſure of their enemies being near, and their nocturnal eyes are dazzled by the
brightneſs of the blaze. From the deſcription of this animal, one would be
hardly led to ſuppoſe, that its fleſh was good for food; and yet we have
ſeveral accounts which alledge the fact, ſome aſſerting it to be
ſuperior even to mutton; however, what Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Des Marchais obſerves,
is moſt likely to be true; namely, that the moſt valuable part of this
animal is its ſkin, and that its fleſh is but indifferent eating, being
generally lean, and uſually having a ſtrong fumet.</p>

               <head>THE PANTHER, AND THE LEOPARD.</head>
               <p>WE have hitherto found no great difficulty in diſtinguiſhing
one animal from another, each carrying its own peculiar marks, which, in ſome
meaſure, ſerve to ſeparate it from all the reſt. But it is otherwiſe,
when we come to theſe of the cat kind, that fill up the chaſm between the
tiger and the cat. The ſpots with which their ſkins are diverſified, are
ſo various, and their ſize ſo equivocal, that it is no eaſy matter to 
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0823800103:288"/> diſtinguiſh the ſpecies, particularly as we have
little elſe but the ſpots and the ſize to guide us in making the
diſtinction. If we regard the figure and diverſity of the ſpots, we
ſhall find many varieties not taken notice of by any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt; if we are
led by the ſize, we ſhall find an imperceptible gradation from the cat to
the tiger. It would be vain, therefore, to make as many varieties in theſe
animals as we ſee differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in ſpots or ſtature; it will be
ſufficient to ſeize the moſt general diſtinctions, and leave the reſt
to ſuch as are fond of more minute diſquiſitions.</p>
               <p>Of all this tribe, whoſe ſkins are ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſpotted, and whoſe natures are ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, the Panther may be
conſidered as the foremoſt. This animal has been by many naturaliſts
miſtaken for the tiger; and, in fact, it approaches next to it in ſize,
fierceneſs and beauty. It is diſtinguiſhed, however, by one obvious and
leading character; that of being ſpotted, not ſtreaked; for, in this
particular, the tiger differs from the panther, the leopard, and almoſt all
the inferior ranks of this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous family.</p>
               <p>This animal, which Mr. Buffon calls ſimply the Panther, Linnaeus
the Pard, Geſner the Pardalis, and the modern Latins the Leopardus; 
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0823800103:289"/> this animal, I ſay, which goes by too many names, and
which the Engliſh have indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately called by the name of the panther
or the leopard, may be conſidered as the largeſt of the kind, and is
ſpotted in a manner ſomewhat different from thoſe that are ſmaller. As
thoſe ſpots, however, make the principal difference between it and the
leſſer animals, which it otherwiſe reſembles in ſhape, ſize,
diſpoſition, and beauty, I will firſt ſhew thoſe ſlight
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, and mention the names each animal has received in
conſequence thereof; and then proceed to give their hiſtory together,
ſtill marking any peculiarity obſervable in one of the ſpecies, which is
not found in the reſt.</p>
               <p>Next to the great panther, already mentioned, is the animal which
Mr. Buffon calls the Leopard, a name which he acknowledges to be given
arbitrarily, for the ſake of diſtinction. Other naturaliſts have not much
attended to the ſlight differences between this and the great panther, nor
have they conſidered its diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations as ſufficient to entitle it to
another name. It has hitherto, therefore, gone under the name of the Leopard,
or Panther of Senegal, where it is chiefly found. The differences between this
animal and the former are theſe: the large panther is often found to be ſix
feet long, from <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0823800103:290"/> the tip of the noſe to the inſertion
of the tail; the panther of Senegal is not above four. The large panther is
marked with ſpots in the manner of a roſe, that is, five or ſix make a
kind of circle, and there is generally a large one in the middle. The leopard
of Senegal has a much more beautiful coat, the yellow is more brilliant, and
the ſpots are ſmaller, and not diſpoſed in rings but in cluſters. As
to the reſt, they are both whiteiſh under the belly; the tail in both is
pretty long, but rather longer in proportion in the latter, than the former. To
theſe two animals, whoſe differences ſeem to be ſo very minute, we may
add a third; namely, the <hi>Jaguar</hi> or Panther of America. This, in every
reſpect, reſembles the two former, except in the diſpoſition of its
ſpots, and that its neck and head are rather ſtreaked than ſpotted. The
jaguar is alſo ſaid to be lower upon its legs, and leſs than the leopard
of Senegal. Theſe three quadrupedes, as we ſee, have but very ſlight
differences, and the principal diſtinction uſed by Mr. Buffon, is taken
from the ſize; the firſt, as he ſays, is uſually ſix feet long; the
ſecond, four feet; and the laſt, about three: however, it appears from the
particular ſubjects of his deſcription, that the panther in his
poſſeſſion was not above three feet ſeven inches long; that

leopard's ſkin which he deſcribes, was about four; and that the jaguar, at
two years old, was between two and three feet long, which, when come to its
full growth, would, no doubt, be four feet long, as well as the two former.
From hence, therefore, we may conclude, that the ſize in theſe animals is
not ſufficient to make a diſtinction among them; and that thoſe who
called them all three by the indiſcriminate names of the leopard and the
panther, if not right, were at leaſt excuſeable. Of thoſe which are now
to be ſeen in the Tower, the jaguar, or the American panther, is rather the
largeſt of the three; and is by no means the contemptible animal which Mr.
Buffon deſcribes it to be: the leopard is the leaſt of them, and has, by
ſome travellers, been ſuppoſed to be an animal produced between the
panther and the ounce, an animal which reſembles, but is leſs than any of
the former. Theſe three animals we may, therefore, rank together, as they
agree pretty nearly in their robe, their ſize, their diſpoſitions, and
their ferocity.</p>
               <p>We come next to an animal confeſſedly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from any of
the former, being much ſmaller, and its colour more inclining to white. Its
name, however, in our language, has cauſed no ſmall confuſion It has been
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0823800103:295"/> called by foreigners, the Onza, or the Ounce,
and this name ſome of our own writers have thought proper to give it; but
others of them, and theſe the moſt celebrated, ſuch as Willoughby, have
given this name to a different animal, with a ſhort tail, and known to the
ancients and moderns by the name of the Lynx. I confeſs myſelf at a loſs,
in this caſe, whom to follow; the alteration of names ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
made with great caution, and never but in caſes of neceſſity. If we
follow Willoughby, there will be an animal of the panther kind, very
diſtinguiſhable from all the reſt, left without a name; and if we recede
from him, it will ſerve to produce ſome confuſion among all the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
claſs of readers and writers who have taken him for their guide: however, as
he ſeems himſelf to have been an innovator, the name of the lynx having
been long adopted into our language before, it was unneceſſary to give the
animal that bore it another name, and to call that creature an ounce, which our
old writers had been accuſtomed to know by the Latin appellation, for this
reaſon, therefore, we may ſafely venture to take a name that has been long
miſapplied, from the lynx, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it to the animal in queſtion. We
will, therefore, call that animal of the panther kind, <pb facs="tcp:0823800103:296"/>

remain in poſſeſſion of that name by which it was known among all our
old Engliſh writers, as well as by all antiquity.</p>
               <p>The Ounce, or the Onca of Linnaeus, is much leſs than the
panther, being not, at moſt, above three feet and a half long: however, its
hair is much longer than that of the panther, and its tail ſtill more ſo.
The panther of four or five feet long, has a tail but of two feet, or two feet
and an half. The ounce, which is but about three feet, has a tail often longer
than the reſt of its body. The colour of the ounce is alſo apparently
different, being rather more inclining to a cream colour, which is deeper on
the back, and whiter towards the belly. The hair on the back is an inch and an
half long; that on the belly, two inches and an half, which is much longer than
that of the panther. Its ſpots are diſpoſed pretty much in the ſame
manner as the large panther, except that on the haunches it is rather marked
with ſtripes than with ſpots.</p>
               <p>Deſcending to animals of this kind that are ſtill ſmaller,
we find the Catamountain, which is the Ocelot of Mr. Buffon, or the Tiger Cat
of moſt of thoſe who exhibit it as a ſhow. It is <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0823800103:300"/>
leſs than the ounce, but its robe more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully variegated. It is an
American animal, and is about two feet and an half in length, from the noſe
to the inſertion of the tail. It is extremely like a cat, except that it is
larger and ſlenderer, that its colours are more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and its tail
rather ſhorter. The fur is of a reddiſh colour, the whole beautified with
black ſpots, and ſtreaks of different figures. They are long on the back,
and round on the belly and paws. On the ears are black ſtripes, which run
acroſs; but, in other reſpects, they entirely reſemble thoſe of a cat.
Theſe colours, however, which naturaliſts have taken great pains minutely
to deſcribe, are by no means permanent, being differently diſpoſed in
differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent animals of the ſame ſpecies. I remember to have ſeen an animal
of this ſize, but whether of this ſpecies I will not pretend to ſay,
ſome years ago, that was entirely brown, and was ſaid alſo to have come
from America.</p>
               <p>From this tribe of the cat kind with ſpotted ſkins and a long
tail, we come to another, with ſkins diverſified in like manner, but with a
ſhorter tail. The principal of theſe is the Lynx, the name by which the
animal was known to Aelian, among the ancients; and to all our old Engliſh
writers, among thoſe of a <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0823800103:301"/> more modern date. This name
has been corrupted by the Portugueſe into the word Ouze; and this corruption
has been adopted by Ray, who has improperly called this animal the Ounce, after
ſome of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign travellers. The firſt ſtriking diſtinction between
the lynx, and all thoſe of the panther kind, is in its tail, which is at
leaſt half as ſhort in proportion, and black at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. Its fur is
much longer, the ſpots on the ſkin leſs vivid, and but confuſedly
mingled with the reſt. Its ears are much longer, and tipped at the points
with a black tuft of hair. The colour round the eyes is white, and the
phyſiognomy more placid and gentle. Each hair of this animal is of three
different colours: the root is of a greyiſh brown; the middle red, or of an
aſh colour; and the ends white. This whiteneſs at the ends takes up ſo
ſmall a part of the particular hair, that it does not prevent us from
ſeeing the principal colour, which is that of the middle part; ſo that it
only makes the ſurface of the body appear as if it was ſilvered over:
however, the hair of which the ſpots conſiſt, has no white at the ends,
and at the roots it is not quite ſo black as the other part. This animal is
not above the ſize of the ounce, but is rather ſtronger built, and it has 
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0823800103:302"/> but twenty-eight teeth; whereas all the reſt of the
cat kind already mentioned have thirty.</p>
               <p>Another animal of this kind is called the Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſh, or, as Mr.
Buffon names it, the Caracal. It is a native of the Eaſt-Indies, and
reſembles the lynx in ſize, in form, and even in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of
being tufted at the tips of the ears. However, the ſiaguſh differs in not
being mottled as the lynx is; its fur, or rather hair, is rougher and
ſhorter; its tail is rather longer; its muzzle more lengthened; its
phyſiognomy more fierce, and its nature more ſavage.</p>
               <p>The third, and laſt animal that need be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of this kind,
is that which Mr. Buffon calls the Serval, and which he has firſt
deſcribed. It is a native of Malabar, reſembling the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in its
ſpots, but the lynx in the ſhortneſs of its tail, in its ſize, and in
its ſtrong built form.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeem to be all the principal diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among
animals of the panther kind, from the largeſt of this tribe down to the
domeſtic cat, which is the ſmalleſt of all theſe fierce and
miſchievous varieties. In all, their nature ſeems pretty much the ſame;
being equally fierce, ſubtle, cruel, and cowardly. The pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, including
the leopard and the jaguar, or American panther, as they are the largeſt,

                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0823800103:306"/> alſo
are they the moſt dangerous of this kind; for the whole race of cats are
noxious in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their power to do miſchief. They inhabit the moſt
torrid latitudes of India, Africa, and America, and have never been able to
mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply beyond the torrid zone. They are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally found in the thickeſt
and the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled foreſts, and often near remote habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where
they watch to ſurprize all kinds of domeſtic animals. They very ſeldom
attack man, even though provoked by him; they ſeem rather deſirous of
finding ſafety by flight, or by climbing trees, at which they are very
expert. In this manner alſo, they often purſue their prey; and, being
expert at ſeizing it, as well above as below, they cauſe a vaſt
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Of all other animals, theſe are the moſt ſullen, and,
even to a proverb, untame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. They ſtill preſerve their fierce and
treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous ſpirit; and at thoſe places where they are expoſed to be
ſeen among others, we often obſerve, that while their keeper is familiar
with the lion or the bear, yet he is apprehenſive of the large panther, and
keeps it bound with the ſhorteſt chain.</p>
               <p>As the ounce differs from theſe in figure and ſize, ſo
alſo it ſeems to differ in diſpoſition, being more mild, tractable, and
tame. Theſe <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0823800103:307"/> we frequently ſee as harmleſs and
innocent as cats; and there is one at preſent in the Tower with which the
keeper plays without the ſmalleſt apprehenſion. I own I was not a little
uneaſy, at firſt, for the man, when he put his hand through the bars, and
called the animal by its name; but was a good deal ſurprized to ſee the
creature, which one might ſuppoſe irritated by long confinement, come
gently up to him, ſtroak his hand with its face, in the manner of a cat, and
teſtify the utmoſt gentleneſs of diſpoſition. The ounce, therefore,
is remarkable for being eaſily tamed; and, in fact, it is employed all over
the eaſt for the purpoſes of hunting. Not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but that panthers
themſelves are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed for this purpoſe, but they are never
thoroughly ſubdued like the former, being uſually brought to the field in a
carriage, and kept chained and caged until they are ſhewn the gazelle, or the
leveret, which is their prey. This they purſue rather by three or four great
ſprings than by running. If they ſeize it by this ſudden effort, it finds
no mercy; but if it eſcapes from their firſt effort, they never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to
purſue, and appear quite diſappointed and confounded at their miſchance.
It ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens that they are ſo much enraged at it, that they attack
even their employer, and <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0823800103:308"/> his only reſource to avoid
their fury is to throw them ſome ſmall pieces of meat, which he has brought
with him for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The ounce, however, is not ſo dangerous; and is treated with
more confidence and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity. It is uſually brought to the field
hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winked behind one of the horſemen. When the game appears, the ounce is
inſtantly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and ſhewn where it lies; upon which the fierce
creature darts like an arrow to the place, and ſeizes it at once, or,
miſſing it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains motionleſs in the place. It would be vain to attempt
retrieving its diſgrace by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the purſuit; for, although it bounds
with greater agility than moſt other animals, yet it is ſlow and aukward in
running, and has no means of finding the animal it purſues by the ſmell, as
is common among thoſe of the dog kind. From hence, therefore, it appears how
much ſuperior the European method of hunting is to that of the Aſiatic;
ſince what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever amuſement this exerciſe affords muſt ariſe from the
continuance of the chace, and from the fluctuation of doubt and expectation,
which raiſe and depreſs the purſuers by turns. All this an Aſiatic
hunter is deprived of; and his greateſt pleaſure can ſcarcely be more
than what among us is called courſing, in which the <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0823800103:309"/>
dog purſues the animal, and keeps it conſtantly in view.</p>
               <p>But it muſt not be ſuppoſed that it is from choice the
Aſiatics uſe this method of chace; for, no doubt, were dogs ſerviceable
among them as they are in Europe, they would be employed for the ſame
purpoſes. But the fact is, that the extreme heat of the tropical climates
produces ſuch univerſal putrefaction, and ſends up ſuch various and
powerful ſcents, that dogs are at firſt bewildered in the chace, and at
laſt come to loſe the delicacy of their ſcent entirely. They are,
therefore, but little uſed in thoſe warm countries; and what could they
avail in places where almoſt every other animal of the foreſt is ſtronger
and more rapacious? The lion, the tiger, the panther, and the ounce, are all
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural enemies to the dog, and attack him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he appears with
ungovernable fury. The breed, therefore, in thoſe places, would quickly be
deſtroyed; ſo that they are obliged to have recourſe to thoſe animals
which are more fitted to ſerve them; and thus convert the ounce to thoſe
purpoſes for which dogs are employed in Europe.</p>
               <p>The Catamountain, or Ocelot, is one of the fierceſt and, for its
ſize, one of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive animals in the world. It is, as was 
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0823800103:310"/> before obſerved, a native of South-America, and by no
means capable of the ſame education as the ounce, which it more approaches in
ſize than in diſpoſition. Two of theſe, from whom Mr. Buffon has taken
his deſcription, were brought over from Carthagena, and having been taken
from the dam when very young, were afterwards ſuckled by a bitch. But, before
they were three months old, they had ſtrength and ingratitude ſufficient to
kill and devour their nurſe. Their ſucceeding fierceneſs and malignity
ſeemed to correſpond with their firſt efforts; for no arts could tame or
ſoften their natures; and while they continued in their cages, they ſtill
teſtified an unceaſing diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for ſlaughter. When their food
was given them, the male always ſerved himſelf before the female ventured
to touch a bit; and it was not till he was ſatisfied that the other began. In
their ſavage ſtate, theſe animals are ſtill more deſtructive; having
great ſtrength and agility, they very eaſily find and overtake their prey,
which they purſue among the tops of the trees as well as on the ground; but
what renders them ſtill more miſchievous is, their unceaſing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
rather for the blood than the fleſh of their prey. They ſuck this with the
greateſt avidity, but frequently leave the carcaſe otherwiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, 
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0823800103:311"/> in order to purſue other animals for the blood in like
manner. They generally continue on the tops of trees, like our wild cats; where
they make their neſt, and often bring forth their young. When they ſpy any
animal they can maſter, and there are but few in the foreſt but what are
inferior, they dart down upon it with inevitable exactneſs.</p>
               <p>The whole tribe of animals of the panther kind, with long tails,
are chiefly inhabitants, as was ſaid, of the torrid zone; but thoſe of the
ſhort tailed kind, and particularly the lynx, is principally found in the
cold countries that are bordering on the pole. The lynx is chiefly to be met
with in the north of Germany, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuania, Muſcovy, Siberia, and North
Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Thoſe of the new continent, however, are rather ſmaller than in
Europe, as is the caſe with almoſt all their quadrupedes; they are
ſomewhat whiter alſo, but in other reſpects there is ſcarce any
difference to be found among them<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon.</bibl>
                  </note>. This animal has been called by ſome
<hi>Lupus Cervarius,</hi> or a creature compounded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a wolf and a
ſtag; but for what reaſon is hard to gueſs; it no way reſembles either
in ſhape or in diſpoſition. In its nature, it exactly reſembles the
cat, except that, being bigger and <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0823800103:312"/> nearly two feet long,
it is bolder and fiercer. Like the cat, it climbs trees, and ſeeks its prey
by ſurprize; like the cat, it is delicate and cleanly, covering its urine
with its paws; and it reſembles the wolf in nothing except its cry, which
often deceives the hunters, and induces them to think they hear a wolf and not
a lynx. This animal alſo, is rather more delicate than the cat; and, after
having once feaſted upon its prey, will never return to it again, but hunts
the woods for another. From hence may have ariſen the common report of the
lynx having, of all other quadrupedes, the ſhorteſt memory. This, however,
is not the only idle ſtory that has been propagated of it: as of its ſeeing
with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity as to perceive objects through walls and mountains;
as of having its urine of ſuch a quality, as to harden, and become a precious
ſtone; with ſeveral others, propagated by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or impoſture.</p>
               <p>The Siaguſh and the Serval are both ſo like all the reſt of
the cat kind in diſpoſition, that it is but repeating the ſame account
once more to give their diſtinct hiſtory. As the lynx is found only in cold
countries, ſo the ſiaguſh is to be met with only in the warm tropical
climates. It is uſed, in the ſame manner as the ounce, for hunting; but it
ſeems to have a property which <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0823800103:313"/> the other has not;
namely, that of being able to overtake its prey by purſuing it. Whether this
is performed by having a finer ſcent than the former, or greater
ſwiftneſs, we are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; being only told that when it overtakes
either the gazelle or the antelope, it leaps upon their backs, and, getting
forward to their ſhoulders, ſcratches their eyes out, by which means they
become an eaſy prey to the hunters. Some have called this animal the lion's
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vider; and it is ſaid that when it calls him to purſue his prey, its
voice very much reſembles that of one man calling another<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Thevenot, vol. ii. p. 114.</bibl>
                  </note>. From hence we may
conjecture that this animal purſues its prey in full cry, and that the lion
only follows to partake or ſeize the ſpoil. The ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is given
alſo of the jackal; and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it may be true, not only of theſe
animals, but of ſome others, ſince it is natural enough to ſuppoſe that
the lion will purſue whenever he is taught to diſcover his prey.</p>
               <p>We had one of theſe animals a few years ago ſent over from the
Eaſt-Indies, but it was not able to endure the change of climate, and it died
in a very ſhort time after it was brought to the Tower. Whether conſumed by
diſeaſe or not I cannot tell, but it ſeemed to me much 
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0823800103:314"/> ſlenderer than the cat or the lynx, and its ears were
much longer; however, it is a very ſtrong creature for its ſize, and has
been known to kill a large dog in ſingle combat<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon.</bibl>
                  </note>: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, it is, like all of
the cat kind except the lion, remarkable for its cowardice, and will never,
except in caſes of neceſſity, attack an animal that is its equal in
ſtrength or activity. For this reaſon, when brought into the field, and put
upon a ſervice of danger, it obſtinately refuſes, and is alert only in
the purſuit of animals that are too feeble for reſiſtance, or too timid
to exert their ſtrength.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid of this rapacious tribe, we perceive a
ſimilitude in the manners and diſpoſitions of them all, from the lion to
the cat. The ſimilitude of their internal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, is ſtill more
exact; the ſhortneſs of their inteſtines, the number of their teeth, and
the ſtructure of their paws. The firſt of this claſs is the Lion,
diſtinguiſhable from all the reſt by his ſtrength, his magnitude, and
his mane. The ſecond is the Tiger, rather longer than the lion, but not ſo
tall, and known by the ſtreaks and the vivid beauty of its robe; including
alſo the American tiger or cougar; diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable by its ſize, next
that of the tiger, <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0823800103:315"/> its tawny colour, and its ſpots.
The third is the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Leopard. The four this the Ounce, not ſo
large as any of the former, ſpotted like them, but diſtinguiſhable by the
cream coloured ground of its hair, and the great length of its tail, being
above the length of its body. The fifth is the Catamountain or Tiger cat,
leſs than the ounce, but differing particularly in having a ſhorter tail,
and being ſtreaked down the back like a tiger. The ſixth is the ſhort
tailed kind; namely, the Lynx, of the ſize of the former, but with a ſhort
tail, ſtreaked, and the tips of its ears tufted with black. The ſeventh is
the Syaguſh, differing from the lynx in not being mottled like it, in not
being ſo large, and in having the ears longer, though tipped with black, as
before. The eighth is the Serval, reſembling the lynx in its form, and the
ſhortneſs of its tail; ſtreaked alſo like it, but not having the tips
of its ears tufted. Laſtly, the Cat, wild and tame, with all its varieties;
all leſs than any of the former, but, like them, equally inſidious,
rapacious, and cruel.</p>
               <p>This whole race may be conſidered as the moſt formidable enemy
of mankind; there are others indeed ſtronger, but they are gentle, and never
offer injury till injured: there are others <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0823800103:316"/> more
numerous, but they are more feeble, and rather look for ſafety by hiding from
man, than oppoſing him. Theſe are the only qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupedes that make good
their ground againſt him; and which may be ſaid to keep ſome kingdoms of
the earth in their own poſſeſſion. How many extenſive countries are
there in Africa, where the wild beaſts are ſo numerous, that man is
deterred from living amongſt them; reluctantly giving up to the lion and the
leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, extenſive tracts, that ſeem formed only for his delight and
convenience!</p>

            <head>CHAP. VIII. Animals of the Dog Kind.</head>
            <p>THE ſecond claſs of carnivorous quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes may be denominated
thoſe of the dog kind. This claſs is neither ſo numerous nor ſo
powerful as the former, and yet neither ſo treacherous, rapacious, or
cowardly. This claſs may be principally diſtinguiſhed by their claws,
which have no ſheath, like thoſe of the cat kind, but ſtill continue at
the point of each toe, without a capability of being ſtretched forward, or
drawn back. The noſe alſo, as well as the jaw, of all the dog kind, is
longer than in the cat; the body is, in proportion, more ſtrongly made, and
covered with hair inſtead of fur. There are many internal diſtinctions
alſo; as in the inteſtines, which are much longer in the dog kind, than in
thoſe of the cat; the eye is not formed for night viſion; and the olfactory
nerves are diffuſed, in the dog kinds, upon a very exrenſive membrane
within the ſcull.</p>
            <p>If we compare the natural habitudes of this claſs with the former,
we ſhall find that the dog kinds are not ſo ſolitary as thoſe of the
cat, but love to hunt in company, and encourage each other with their mutual
cries. In this manner <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0823800103:318"/> the dog and the jackall purſue
their prey; and the wolf and fox, which are of this kind, though more
ſolitary and ſilent among us, yet, in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where leſs perſecuted,
and where they can more fearleſs diſplay their natural inclinations, they
are found to keep together in packs, and purſue their game with alternate
howlings.</p>
            <p>Animals of the dog kind want ſome of the advantages of the cat
kind, and yet are poſſeſſed of others in which the latter are
deficient. Upon obſerving their claws, it will eaſily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that
they cannot, like cats, purſue their prey up the ſides of a tree, and
continue the chace among the branches; their unmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able claws cannot ſtick
in the bark, and thus ſupport the body up along the trunk, as we ſee the
cat very eaſily perform: whenever, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, their prey flies up the tree
from them, they can only follow it with their eyes, or watch its motions till
hunger again brings it to the ground. For this reaſon, the proper prey of the
dog kind, are only thoſe animals that, like themſelves, are unfitted for
climbing; the hare, the rabbit, the gazelle, or the roebuck.</p>
            <p>As they are, in this reſpect, inferior to the cat, ſo they
exceed it in the ſenſe of ſmelling; by which alone they purſue their
prey with certainty of ſucceſs, wind it through all its 
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0823800103:319"/> mazes, and tire it down by perſeverance. It often
happens, however, in the ſavage ſtate, that their prey is either too much
diminiſhed, or too wary to ſerve for a ſufficient ſupply. In this
caſe, when driven to an extremity, all the dog kinds can live for ſome time
upon fruits and vegetables, which, if they do not pleaſe the appetite, at
leaſt ſerve to appeaſe their hunger.</p>
            <p>Of all this tribe, the Dog has every reaſon to claim the
preference, being the moſt intelligent of all known quadrupedes, and the
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged friend of mankind. The dog<note n="*" place="bottom">The reſt of
this deſcription of the dog is taken from Mr. Buffon: what I have added, is
marked as before.</note>, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant of the beauty of his form, his vivacity,
force and ſwiftneſs, is poſſeſſed of all thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
qualifications that can conciliate the affections of man, and make the tyrant a
protector. A natural ſhare of courage, an angry and ferocious
diſpoſition, renders the dog, in its ſavage ſtate, a formidable enemy
to all other animals: but theſe readily give way to very different qualities
in the domeſtic dog, whoſe only ambition ſeems the deſire to pleaſe;
he is ſeen to come crouching along, to lay his force, his courage, and all
his uſeful talents, at the feet of his maſter; he waits his orders, to 
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0823800103:320"/> which he pays implicit obedience; he conſults his
looks, and a ſingle glance is ſufficient to put him in motion; he is more
faithful even than the moſt boaſted among men; he is conſtant in his
affections, friendly without intereſt, and grateful for the ſlighteſt
favours; much more mindful of benefits received, than injuries of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; he is
not driven off by unkindneſs; he ſtill continues humble, ſubmiſſive,
and implor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; his only hope to be ſerviceable, his only terror to
diſpleaſe; he licks the hand that has been juſt lifted to ſtrike him,
and at laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms reſentment, by ſubmiſſive perſeverance.</p>
            <p>More docile than man, more obedient than any other animal, he is not
only inſtructed in a ſhort time, but he alſo conforms to the
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and the manners of thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him. He takes his
tone from the houſe he inhabits; like the reſt of the domeſtics, he is
diſdainful among the great, and churliſh among clowns. Always aſſiduous
in ſerving his maſter, and only a friend to his friends, he is indifferent
to all the reſt, and declares himſelf openly againſt ſuch as ſeem to
be dependant like himſelf. He knows a beggar by his cloaths, by his voice, or
his geſtures, and forbids his approach. When at night the guard of the 
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0823800103:321"/> houſe is committed to his care, he ſeems proud of
the charge; he continues a watchful centinel, he goes his rounds, ſcents
ſtrangers at a diſtance, and gives them warning of his being upon duty. If
they attempt to break in upon his territories, he becomes more fierce, flies at
them, threatens, fights, and either conquers alone, or alarms thoſe who have
moſt intereſt in coming to his aſſiſtance; however, when he has
conquered, he quietly repoſes upon the ſpoil, and abſtains from what he
has deterred others from abuſing; giving thus at once a leſſon of
courage, temperance, and fidelity.</p>
            <p>From hence we ſee of what importance this animal is to us in a
ſtate of nature. Suppoſing, for a moment, that the ſpecies had not
exiſted, how could man, without the aſſiſtance of the dog, have been
able to conquer, tame, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to ſervitude, every other animal? How
could he diſcover, chace, and deſtroy, thoſe that were noxious to him? In
order to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and to become maſter of all animated nature, it was
neceſſary for him to begin by making a friend of a part of them; to attach
ſuch of them to himſelf, by kindneſs and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes, as ſeemed
fitteſt for obedience and active purſuit. Thus the firſt art employed by
man, was in conciliating the favour of the dog; and <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0823800103:322"/> the
fruits of this art were, the conqueſt and peaceable poſſeſſion of the
earth.</p>
            <p>The generality of animals have greater agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, greater
ſwiftneſs, and more formidable arms, from nature, than man; their
ſenſes, and particularly that of ſmelling, are far more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: they
having gained, therefore, a new aſſiſtant, particularly one whoſe
ſcent is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite as that of the dog, was the gaining a new
ſenſe, a new faculty, which before was wanting. The machines and
inſtruments which we have imagined for perfecting the reſt of the
ſenſes, do not approach to that already prepared by nature, by which we are
enabled to find out every animal, though unſeen, and thus deſtroy the
noxious, and uſe the ſerviceable.</p>
            <p>The dog, thus uſeful in himſelf, taken into a participation of
empire, exerts a degree of ſuperiority over all animals that require human
protection. The flock and the herd obey his voice more readily even than that
of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd or the herdſman; he conducts them, guards them, keeps them
from capriciouſly ſeeking danger, and their enemies he conſiders as his
own. Nor is he leſs uſeful in the purſuit; when the ſound of the horn,
or the voice of the huntſman calls him to the field, he teſtifies his
pleaſure by every little art, and purſues with <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0823800103:323"/>
perſeverance, thoſe animals, which, when taken, he muſt not expect to
divide. The deſire of hunting is indeed natural to him as well as to his
maſter, ſince war and the chace are the only employment of ſavages. All
animals that live upon fleſh hunt by nature; the lion and the tiger, whoſe
force is ſo great that they are ſure to conquer, hunt alone and without
art; the wolf, the fox, and the wild dog, hunt in packs, aſſiſt each
other, and partake the ſpoil. But when education has perfected this talent in
the domeſtic dog, when he has been taught by man to repreſs his ardour, to
meaſure his motions, and not to exhauſt his force by too ſudden an
exertion of it, he then hunts with method, and always with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"Although the wild dog, ſuch as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he
came under the protection of mankind, is at preſent utterly unknown, no
ſuch animal being now to be found in any part of the world, yet there are
many that, from a domeſtic ſtate, have turned ſavage, and entirely
purſue the dictates of nature."</q> In thoſe deſerted and uncultivated
countries where the dog is found wild, they ſeem entirely to partake of the
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the wolf; they unite in large bodies, and attack the moſt
formidable animals of the foreſt, the cougar, the panther, and the biſon. 
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0823800103:324"/> In America, where they were originally brought by the
Europeans, and abandoned by their maſters, they have multiplied to ſuch a
degree, that they ſpread in packs over the whole country, attack all other
animals, and even man himſelf does not paſs without inſult. They are
there treated in the ſame manner as all other carnivorous animals, and killed
wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they happen to come: however, they are eaſily tamed: when taken
home, and treated with kindneſs and lenity, they quickly become
ſubmiſſive and familiar, and continue faithfully attached to their
maſters. Different in this from the wolf or the fox, who, though taken never
ſo young, are gentle only while cubs, and, as they grow older, give
themſelves up to their natural appetites of rapine and cruelty. In ſhort,
it may be aſſerted, that the dog is the only animal whoſe fidelity is
unſhaken; the only one who knows his maſter, and the friends of the family;
the only one who inſtantly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes a ſtranger; the only one who
knows his name, and anſwers to the domeſtic call; the only one who ſeems
to underſtand the nature of ſubordination, and ſeeks aſſiſtance;
the only one who, when he miſſes his maſter, teſtifies his loſs by
his complaints; the only one who, carried to a diſtant place, can find the
way <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0823800103:325"/>

and whoſe education is always ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful.</p>
            <p>In the ſame manner, as the dog is of the moſt complying
diſpoſition, ſo alſo is it the moſt ſuſceptible of change in its
form; the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of this animal being too many for even the moſt careful
deſcriber to mention. The climate, the food, and the education, all make
ſtrong impreſſions upon the animal, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce alterations in its
ſhape, its colour, its hair, its ſize, and in every thing but its nature.
The ſame dog, taken from one climate, and brought to another, ſeems to
become another animal; but different breeds are as much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, to all
appearance, as any two animals the moſt diſtinct in nature. Nothing appears
to continue conſtant with them, but their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal conformation; different
in the figure of the body, in the length of the noſe, in the ſhape of the
head, in the length and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ears and tail, in the colour, the
quality, and the quantity of the hair; in ſhort, different in every thing but
that make of the parts which ſerve to continue the ſpecies, and keep the
animal diſtinct from all others. It is this peculiar conformation, this power
of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing an animal that can reproduce, that <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0823800103:328"/> marks
the kind, and approximates forms that at firſt ſight ſeem never made for
conjunction.</p>
            <p>From this ſingle conſideration, therefore, we may at once
pronounce all dogs to be of one kind; but which of them is the original of all
the reſt, which of them is the ſavage dog from whence ſuch a variety of
deſcendants have come down, is no eaſy matter to determine. We may eaſily
indeed, obſerve, that all thoſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals which are under the influence of
man, are ſubject to great variations. Such as have been ſufficiently
independant, ſo as to chuſe their own climate, their own nouriſhment, and
to purſue their own habitudes, preſerve the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal marks of nature,
without much devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and it is probable, that the firſt of theſe is
even at this day very well repreſented in their deſcendants. But ſuch as
man has ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, tranſported from one climate to another, controlled in
their manner of living, and their food, have moſt probably been changed
alſo in their forms: particularly the dog has felt theſe alterations more
ſtrongly than any other of the domeſtic kinds; for living more like man, he
may be thus ſaid to live more irregularly alſo, and, conſequently, muſt
have felt all thoſe changes that ſuch variety would naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.
Some other cauſes alſo may be aſſigned <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0823800103:329"/> for this
variety in the ſpecies of the dog: as he is perpetually under the eye of his
maſter, when accident has produced any ſingularity in its productions, man
uſes all his art to continue this peculiarity unchanged; either by breeding
from ſuch as had thoſe ſingularities, or by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying ſuch as
happened to want them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as the dog produces much more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
than ſome other animals, and lives a ſhorter time, ſo the chance for its
varieties will be offered in greater proportion.</p>
            <p>But which is the original animal, and which the artificial or
accidental variety, is a queſtion which, as was ſaid, is not eaſily
reſolved. If the internal ſtructure of dogs of different ſorts be
compared with each other, it will be found, except in point of ſize, that in
this reſpect they are exactly the ſame. This, therefore, affords no
criterion. If other animals be compared with the dog internally, the wolf and
the fox will be found to have the moſt perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance; it is
probable, therefore, that the dog which moſt nearly reſembles the wolf or
the fox externally, is the original animal of its kind: for it is natural to
ſuppoſe, that as the dog moſt nearly reſembles them internally, ſo he
may be near them in external reſemblance alſo except where art or accident
has altered <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0823800103:330"/> his form. This being ſuppoſed, if we
look among the number of varieties to be found in the dog, we ſhall not find
one ſo like the wolf or the fox, as that which is called the Shepherd's Dog.
This is that dog with long coarſe hair on all parts except the noſe,
pricked ears, and a long noſe, which is common enough among us, and receives
his name from being prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally uſed in guarding and attending on ſheep.
This ſeems to be the primitive animal of his kind; and we ſhall be the more
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in this opinion, if we attend to the different characters which
climate produces in this animal, and the different races of dogs which are
propagated in every country: and, in the firſt place, if we examine thoſe
countries which are ſtill ſavage, or but half civilized, where it is moſt
probable the dog, like his maſter, has received but few impreſſions from
art, we ſhall find the ſhepherd's dog, or one very like him, ſtill
prevailing amongſt them. The dogs that have run wild in America, and in
Congo, approach this form. The dog of Siberia, Lapland, and Iceland, of the
Cape of Good Hope, of Madagaſcar, Madura, Calicut, and Malabar, have all a
long noſe, pricked ears, and reſemble the ſhepherd's dog very nearly. In
Guinea, the dog very ſpeedily takes <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0823800103:331"/> this form; for, at
the ſecond or third gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the animal forgets to bark, his ears and his
tail become pointed, and his hair drops off, while a coarſer, thinner kind
comes in the place. This ſort of dog is alſo to be found in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
climates in great abundance, particularly among thoſe who, prefering
uſefulneſs to beauty, employ an animal that requires very little
inſtruction to be ſerviceable. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this creature's
deformity, his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and ſavage air, he is ſuperior to all the reſt
of his kind in inſtinct; and, without any teaching, naturally takes to
tending flocks, with an aſſiduity and vigilance that at once
aſtoniſhes, and yet relieves his maſter.</p>
            <p>In more poliſhed and civilized places, the dog ſeems to partake
of the univerſal refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and, like the men, becomes more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
more majeſtic, and more capable of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming an education foreign to his
nature. The dogs of Albany, of Greece, of Denmark, and of Ireland, are larger
and ſtronger than thoſe of any other kind. In France, Germany, Spain, and
Italy, the dogs are of various kinds, like the men; and this variety ſeems
formed by croſſing the breed of ſuch as are imported from various
climates.</p>
            <p>The ſhepherd's dog may, therefore, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered 
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0823800103:332"/> as the primitive ſtock from whence theſe varieties
are all derived. He makes the ſtem of that genealogical tree which has been
branched out into every part of the world. This animal ſtill continues pretty
nearly in its original ſtate among the poor in temperate climates; being
tranſported into the colder re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, he grows leſs and more ugly among the
Laplanders; but becomes more perfect in Ice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Ruſſia and Siberia, where
the climate is leſs rigorous, and the people more civilized. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
differences there may be among the dogs of theſe countries, they are not very
conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as they all have ſtrait ears, long and thick hair, a
ſavage aſpect, and do not bark either ſo often or ſo loud as dogs of
the more cultivated kind.</p>
            <p>The ſhepherd's dog, tranſported into the temperate climates, and
among people entirely civilized, ſuch as England, France, and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, will
be diveſted of his ſavage air, his pricked ears, his rough, long, and thick
hair, and, from the ſingle influence of climate and food alone, will become
either a Matin, a Maſtiff, or an Hound. Theſe three ſeem the immediate
deſcendants of the former; and from them the other varieties are
produced.</p>
            <p>The Hound, the Harrier, and the Beagle, <pb n="284" facs="tcp:0823800103:333"/>
ſeem all of the ſame kind; for although the bitch is covered but by one of
them, yet in her litters are found puppies reſembling all the three. This
animal, tranſported into Spain or Barbary, where the hair of all quadrupedes
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſoft and long, will be there converted into the land-ſpaniel, and
the water-ſpaniel, and theſe of different ſizes.</p>
            <p>The Grey Matin Hound, which is the ſecond branch, tranſported to
the north, becomes the great Daniſh dog; and this, ſent into the ſouth,
becomes the grey-hound, of different ſizes. The ſame, tranſported into
Ireland, the Uk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine, Tartary, Epirus, and Albania, becomes the great wolf
dog, known by the name of the Iriſh wolf dog.</p>
            <p>The Maſtiff, which is the third branch, and chiefly a native of
England, when tranſported into Denmark, becomes the little Daniſh dog; and
this little Daniſh dog, ſent into the tropical and warm climates, becomes
the animal called the Turkiſh dog, without hair. All theſe races, with
their varieties, are produced by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of climate, joined to the
different food, education, and ſhelter, which they have received among
mankind. All other kinds may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as mongrel races, produced by the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of theſe, and found rather by croſſing <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0823800103:334"/> the breed than by attending to the individual. 
<q rend="inline">"As theſe are extremely numerous, and very
different in different countries, it would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endleſs to mention
the whole; beſides, nothing but experience can aſcertain the reality of
theſe conjectures already made, although they have ſo much the appearance
of probability; and until that gives more certain information, we muſt be
excuſed from entering more minutely into the ſubject. 
<p>"With regard to the dogs of our country in particular, the
varieties are very great, and the number every day encreaſing. And this
muſt happen in a country ſo open by commerce to all others, and where
wealth is apt to produce capricious predilection. Here the uglieſt and the
moſt uſeleſs of their kinds will be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained merely for their
ſingularity; and, being imported only to be looked at, they will loſe even
that ſmall degree of ſagacity which they poſſeſſed in their natural
climates. From this importation of foreign uſeleſs dogs, our own native
breed is, I am informed, greatly dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, and the varieties now to be
found in England much more numerous than they were in the times of Queen
Elizabeth, when Doctor Caius attempted their natural hiſtory. Some of theſe
he mentions are no longer to be found <pb n="286" facs="tcp:0823800103:335"/> among us, although
many have ſince been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, by no means ſo ſerviceable as thoſe
which have been ſuffered to decay.</p> 
                  <p>"He divides the whole race into three kinds. The firſt is, the
generous kind, which conſiſts of the tarrier, the harrier, and the
blood-hound; the gaze-hound, the grey-hound, the leymmer, and the tumbler; all
theſe are uſed for hunting. Then the ſpaniel, the ſetter, and the
water-ſpaniel, or finder, were uſed for fowling; and the ſpaniel, gentle,
or lap-dog, for amuſement. The ſecond is the farm kind; conſiſting of
the ſhepherd's dog and the maſtiff. And the third is the mongrel kind;
conſiſting of the wappe, the turn-ſpit, and the dancer. To theſe
va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties we may add at preſent, the bull-dog, the Dutch maſtiff, the
harlequin, the pointer, and the Dane, with a variety of lap-dogs, which, as
they are perfectly uſeleſs, may be conſidered as unworthy of a name.</p> 
                  <p>"The Tarrier is a ſmall kind of hound<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Britiſh Zoology.</bibl>
                     </note>, with rough hair, made
uſe of to force the fox or the badger out of their holes; or rather to give
notice, by their barking, in what part of their kennel the fox or badger
reſides, when the ſportſmen intend to dig them out.</p> 
                  <p>"The Harrier, as well as the beagle and the <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0823800103:336"/>
fox-hound are uſed for hunting; of all other animals, they have the
quickeſt and moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing ſenſe of ſmelling. The properly
breeding, matching, and training theſe, make up the buſineſs of many
men's lives.</p> 
                  <p>"The Blood-hound was a dog of great uſe, and in high eſteem
among our anceſtors. Its employ was to recover any game that had eſcaped
wounded from the hunter, or had been killed, and ſtolen out of the foreſt.
But it was ſtill more employed in hunting thieves and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by their
footſteps. At that time, when the country was leſs peopled than at
preſent, and when, conſequently, the footſteps of one man were leſs
croſſed and obliterated by thoſe of others, this animal was very
ſerviceable in ſuch purſuits; but at preſent, when the country is every
where peopled, this variety is quite worn out; probably becauſe it was found
of leſs ſervice than formerly.</p> 
                  <p>"The Gaze-hound hunted, like our grey-hounds, by the eye and not
by the ſcent. It chaced indifferently the fox, hare, or buck. It would
ſelect from the herd the fatteſt and faireſt deer, purſue it by the
eye, and if loſt recover it again with amazing ſagacity. This ſpecies is
now loſt or unknown among us.</p> 
                  <p>"The Grey-hound is very well known at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, 
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0823800103:337"/> and was formerly held in ſuch eſtimation, that it
was the peculiar companion of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; who, in the times of
ſemi-barbariſm, was known by his horſe, his hawk, and his grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound.
Perſons under a certain rank of life are forbidden, by ſome late game-laws,
from keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this animal; wherefore, to diſguiſe it the better, they cut
off its tail.</p> 
                  <p>"The Leymmer is a ſpecies now unknown to us. It hunted both by
ſcent and ſight, and was led in a leyme or thong, from whence it received
its name.</p> 
                  <p>"The Tumbler was leſs than the hound, more ſcraggy, and had
pricked ears; ſo that by the deſcription it ſeems to anſwer to the
modern lurcher. This took its prey by mere cunning, depending neither on the
goodneſs of its noſe nor its ſwiftneſs. If it came into a warren, it
neither barked nor ran on the rabbits; but, ſeemingly inattentive, approached
ſufficiently near till it came within reach, and then ſeized them by a
ſudden ſpring.</p> 
                  <p>"The Land Spaniel, which probably had its name from Spain, where
it might have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the ſoftneſs of its hair, is well known at
preſent. There are two varieties of this kind; namely, the Slater, uſed in
hawking to ſpring the game; and the Setter, that crouches down 
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0823800103:338"/> when it ſcents the birds, till the net be drawn over
them. I have read ſomewhere that the famous poet, Lord Surry, was the firſt
who taught dogs to ſet; it being an amuſement to this day only known in
England.</p> 
                  <p>"The Water Spaniel was another ſpecies uſed in fowling. This
ſeems to be the moſt docile of all the dog kind; and this docility is
particularly owing to his natural attachment to man. Many other kinds will not
bear correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but this patient creature, though very fierce to ſtrangers,
ſeems unalterable in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and blows and ill uſage ſeem only
to encreaſe his regard.</p> 
                  <p>"The Lap-dog, at the time of Doctor Caius, was of Malteſe breed;
at preſent it comes from different countries; in general, the more auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or extraordinary theſe are, the more they are prized.</p> 
                  <p>"The Shepherd's dog has been already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and as for the
maſtiff he is too common to require a deſcription. Doctor Caius tells us,
that three of theſe were reckoned a match for a bear, and four for a lion.
However, we are told that three of them overcame a lion in the times of King
James the Firſt; two of them being diſabled in the combat, the third
obliged the lion to ſeek for ſafety by ſlight.</p>

                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:0823800103:339"/>"As to the laſt diviſion, namely, of the
Wappe, the Turn-ſpit, and the Dancer, theſe were mongrels, of no certain
ſhape, and made uſe of only to alarm the family, or, being taught a variety
of tricks, were carried about as a ſhow.</p> 
                  <p>"With regard to thoſe of later importation, the Bull-dog, as Mr.
Buffon ſuppoſes, is a breed between the ſmall Dane and the Engliſh
maſtiff. The large Dane is the talleſt dog that is generally bred in
England. It is ſomewhat between a maſtiff and a grey-hound in ſhape,
being more ſlender than the one and much ſtronger than the other. They are
chiefly uſed rather for ſhew than ſervice, being neither good in the yard
nor the field. The higheſt are moſt eſteemed; and they generally cut off
their ears to improve their figure, as ſome abſurdly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The
harlequin is not much unlike the ſmall Dane, being an uſeleſs animal,
ſomewhat between an Italian grey-hound and a Dutch maſtiff. To theſe
ſeveral others might be added, ſuch as the pug dog, the black breed, and
the pointer; but, in fact, the varieties are ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous as to fatigue even
the moſt ardent cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity."</p>

            <p>Of theſe of the foreign kinds, I ſhall mention only three, which
are more remarkable than any of the reſt. The Lion Dog greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles 
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0823800103:340"/> that animal, in miniature, from whence it takes the
name. The hair of the fore part of its body is extremely long, while that of
the hinder part is as ſhort. The noſe is ſhort, the tail long, and tufted
at the point, ſo that in all theſe particulars it is entirely like the
lion. However, it differs very much from that fierce animal in nature and
diſpoſition, being one of the ſmalleſt animals of its kind, extremely
feeble, timid, and inactive. It comes originally from Malta, where it is found
ſo ſmall that women carry it about in their ſleeves.</p>
            <p>That animal falſely called the Turkiſh Dog, differs greatly from
all the reſt of the kind, in being entirely without hair. The ſkin, which
is perfectly bare, is of a fleſh colour, with brown ſpots; and their figure
at firſt view is rather diſguſting. Theſe ſeem to be of the ſmall
Daniſh breed, brought into a warm climate, and there, by a ſucceſſion
of generations, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of their hair. For this reaſon, they are
extremely chilly, and unable to endure the cold of our climate; and even in the
midſt of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer they continue to ſhiver as we ſee men in a froſty
day. Their ſpots are brown, as was ſaid, well marked, and eaſily
diſtinguiſhable in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but in the cold of winter they entirely
diſappear. They are called the Turkiſh breed, <pb n="292" facs="tcp:0823800103:341"/>
although brought from a much warmer climate; for ſome of them have been known
to come from the warmeſt parts of Africa and the Eaſt-Indies.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"The laſt variety, and the moſt wonderful of all
that I ſhall mention, is the Great Iriſh Wolf Dog; that may be conſidered
as the firſt of the canine ſpecies. This animal, which is very rare even in
the only country in the world where it is to be found, is rather kept for
ſhew than uſe, there being neither wolves nor any other formidable beaſts
of prey in Ireland, that ſeem to require ſo powerful an antagoniſt. The
wolf dog is therefore bred up in the houſes of the great, or ſuch gentlemen
as chuſe to keep him as a curioſity, being neither good for hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
hare, the fox, or the ſtag, and equally unſerviceable as an houſe dog.
Nevertheleſs, he is extremely beautiful and majeſtic to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, being
the greateſt of the dog kind to be ſeen in the world. The largeſt of
thoſe I have ſeen, and I have ſeen above a dozen, was about four feet
high, or as tall as a calf of a year old. He was made extremely like a
grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound, but rather more robuſt, and inclining to the figure of the French
matin, or the great Dane. His eye was mild, his colour white, and his nature
ſeemed heavy and phlegmatic. This I aſcribed to his having been bred up to
a <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0823800103:342"/> ſize beyond his nature; for we ſee in man, and all
other animals, that ſuch as are overgrown are neither ſo vigorous nor alert
as thoſe of more moderate ſtature. The greateſt pains had been taken with
theſe to enlarge the breed, both by food and matching. This end was
ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually obtained, indeed; for the ſize was enormous; but, as it ſeemed
to me, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the animal's fierceneſs, vigilance, and ſagacity.
However, I was informed otherwiſe; the gentleman who bred them aſſuring
me that a maſtiff would be nothing when oppoſed to one of them, who
generally ſeized their antagoniſt by the back: he added, that they would
worry the ſtrongeſt bull-dogs, in a few minutes, to death. But this
ſtrength did not appear either in their figure or their inclinations; they
ſeemed rather more timid than the ordinary race of dogs; and their ſkin was
much thinner, and conſequently leſs fitted for combat. Whether with theſe
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages they were capable, as I was told, of ſingly coping with
bears, others may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; however, they have but few oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, in
their own country, of exerting their ſtrength, as all wild carnivorous
animals there are only of the vermin kind. Mr. Buffon ſeems to be of opinion
that theſe are the true Moloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian dogs of the ancients; he gives no
reaſon <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0823800103:343"/> for this opinion; and I am apt to think it ill
grounded. Not to trouble the reader with a tedious critical diſquiſition,
which I have all along avoided, it will be ſufficient to obſerve, that
Nemeſianus, in giving directions for the choice of a bitch, adviſes to have
one of Spartan or Moloſſian breed; and among ſeveral other perfections,
he ſays that the ears ſhould be dependent, and fluctuate as ſhe runs<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <q> 
                        <l>Elige tunc curſu facilem, facilemque recurſu,</l>

                     </q>
                  </note>. This, however, is by no
means the caſe with the Iriſh wolf dog, whoſe ears reſemble thoſe of
the grey-hound, and are far from fluctuating with the animal's motions. But of
whatever kinds theſe dogs may be, whether known among the ancients, or
whether produced by a later mixture, they are now almoſt quite worn away, and
are very rarely to be met with even in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. If carried to other countries,
they ſoon degenerate; and even at home, unleſs great care be taken, they
quickly alter. They were once employed in clearing the iſland of wolves,
which infeſted it in great plenty; but theſe being deſtroyed, the dogs
alſo are wearing <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0823800103:344"/> away, as if Nature meant to blot out
the ſpecies when they had no longer any ſervices to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. 
<p>"In this manner ſeveral kinds of animals fade from the face of
nature that were once well known, but are now ſeen no longer. The enormous
elk of the ſame kingdom, that, by its horns, could not have been leſs than
eleven feet high, the wolf, and even the wolf-dog, are extinct, or only
continued in ſuch a manner as to prove their former plenty and exiſtence.
From hence it is probable that many of the nobler kinds of dogs, of which the
ancients have given us ſuch beautiful deſcriptions, are now utterly
unknown; ſince among the whole breed we have not one that will venture to
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the lion or the tiger in ſingle combat. The Engliſh bull-dog is
perhaps the braveſt of the kind; but what are his moſt boaſted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
to thoſe mentioned of the Epirotic dogs by Pliny, or the Indian dogs by
Aelian. The latter gives us a deſcription of a combat between a dog and a
lion, which I will take leave to tranſlate.</p> 
                  <p>"When Alexander was purſuing his conqueſts in India, one of
the principal men or that country was deſirous of ſhewing him the value of
the dogs which his country produced. <pb n="296" facs="tcp:0823800103:345"/> Bringing his dog
into the king's preſence, he ordered a ſtag to be let looſe before him,
which the dog, deſpiſing as an unworthy enemy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained quite regardleſs
of the animal, and never once ſtirred from his place. His maſter then
ordered a wild boar to be ſet out; but the dog thought even this a
deſpicable foe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained calm and regardleſs as before. He was next
tried with a bear; but ſtill deſpiſing his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he only waited for an
object more worthy of his courage and his force. At laſt, they brought forth
a tremendous lion, and then the dog ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his antagoniſt, and
prepared for combat. He inſtantly diſcovered a degree of ungovernable
ardour; and, flying at the lion with fury, ſeized him by the throat, and
totally diſabled him from reſiſtance Upon this, the Indian, who was
deſirous of ſurprizing the king, and knowing the conſtancy and bravery of
his dog, ordered his tail to be cut off; which was eaſily performed as the
bold animal was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in holding the lion. He next ordered one of his legs
to be broken; which, however, did not in the leaſt abate the dog's ardour,
but he ſtill kept his hold as before. Another leg was then broken; but the
dog, as if he had ſuffered no pain, only preſſed the lion ſtill the
more. In this cruel manner, all his legs were <pb n="297" facs="tcp:0823800103:346"/> cut off,
without abating his courage; and at laſt, when even his head was ſeparated
from his body, the jaws ſeemed to keep their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hold. A ſight ſo
cruel did not fail to affect the king with very ſtrong emotions, at once
pitying the dog's fate and admiring his forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Upon which the Indian,
ſeeing him thus moved, preſented him with four dogs of the ſame kind,
which in ſome meaſure alleviated his uneaſineſs for the loſs of the
former.</p> "The breed of dogs, however, in that country, is at preſent very
much inferior to what this ſtory ſeems to imply; ſince, in many places,
inſtead of dogs, they have animals of the cat kind for hunting. In other
places alſo, this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and faithful animal, inſtead of being applied
to his natural uſes, is only kept to be eaten. All over China there are
dog-butchers, and ſhambles appointed for ſelling their fleſh. In Canton,
particularly, there is a ſtreet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that purpoſe; and what is
very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, wherever a dog-butcher appears, all the dogs of the place
are ſure to be in full cry after him; they know their enemy, and perſecute
him as far as they are able."</q> Along the coaſts of Guinea, their fleſh
is eſteemed a delicacy by the Negroes; and they will give one of their cows
for a dog. But, among this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous <pb n="298" facs="tcp:0823800103:347"/> and brutal people,
ſcarce any thing that has life comes amiſs; and they may well take up with
a dog, ſince they conſider toads, lizards, and even the fleſh of the
tiger itſelf, as a dainty. It may perhaps happen that the fleſh of this
animal, which is ſo indifferent in the temperate climates, may aſſume a
better quality in thoſe which are more warm; but it is more than probable
that the diverſity is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in man than in the fleſh of the dog; ſince
in the cold countries the fleſh is eaten with equal appetite by the
ſavages; and they have their dog-feaſts in the ſame manner as we have
ours for veniſon.</p>
            <p>In our climate, the wild animals that moſt approach the dog are
the wolf and the fox; theſe in their internal conformation greatly
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble each other, and yet in their natures are very diſtinct. The
ancients aſſerted that they bred together; and I am aſſured by credible
perſons that there are many animals in this country bred between a dog and a
fox. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, all the endeavours of Mr. Buffon to make them engender, as he
aſſures us, were inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. For this purpoſe, he bred up a young wolf,
taken in the woods, at two months old, with a matin dog of the ſame age. They
were ſhut up together, without any other, in a large <pb n="299" facs="tcp:0823800103:348"/>
yard, where they had a ſhelter for retiring. They neither of them knew any
other indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual of their kind, nor even any other man but he who had the
charge of feeding them. In this manner they were kept for three years; ſtill
with the ſame attention, and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining or tying them up. During
the firſt year the young animals played with each other continually, and
ſeemed to love each other very much. In the ſecond year they began to
diſpute about their victuals, although they were given more than they could
uſe. The quarrel always began on the wolf's ſide. They were brought their
food, which conſiſted of fleſh and bones, upon a large wooden platter,
which was laid on the ground. Juſt as it was put down, the wolf, inſtead of
falling to the meat, began by driving off the dog; and took the platter in his
teeth ſo expertly, that he let nothing of what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained fall upon the
ground; and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner carried it off; but as he could not entirely
eſcape, he was frequently ſeen to run with it round the yard five or ſix
times, ſtill carrying it in a poſition that none of its contents could
fall. In this manner it would continue running, only now and then ſtopping to
take breath, until the dog coming up, the wolf would leave the victuals to
attack him. The dog, however, <pb n="300" facs="tcp:0823800103:349"/> was the ſtronger of the
two; but as it was more gentle, in order to ſecure him from the wolf's
attack, he had a collar put round his neck. In the third year, the quarrels of
theſe ill paired aſſociates were more vehement, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats more
frequent; the wolf, therefore, had a collar put about its neck, as well as the
dog, who began to be more fierce and unmerciful. During the two firſt years,
neither ſeemed to teſtify the leaſt tendency towards engendering; and it
was not till the end of the third, that the wolf, which was the female,
ſhewed the natural deſire, but without abating either in its fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or obſtinacy. This appetite rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed than repreſſed their
mutual animoſity; they became every day more intractable and ferocious, and
nothing was heard between them but the ſounds of rage and reſentment. They
both, in leſs than three weeks, became remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably lean, without ever
approaching each other, but to combat. At length, their quarrels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo
deſperate, that the dog killed the wolf, who was become more weak and feeble;
and he was ſoon after himſelf obliged to be killed, for, upon being ſet
at liberty, he inſtantly flew upon every animal he met, fowls, dogs, and even
men themſelves not eſcaping his ſavage fury.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0823800103:350"/>The ſame experiment was tried upon foxes,
taken young, but with no better ſucceſs, they were never found to engender
with dogs; and our learned naturaliſt ſeems to be of opinion that their
natures are too oppoſite ever to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke mutual deſire. One thing,
however, muſt be remarked, that the animals on which he tried his
experiments, were rather too old when taken, and had partly acquired their
natural ſavage appetites, before they came into his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. The
wolf, as he acknowledges, was two or three months old before it was caught, and
the foxes were taken in traps. It may, therefore, be eaſily ſuppoſed,
that nothing could ever after thoroughly tame thoſe creatures, that had been
ſuckled in the wild ſtate, and had caught all the habitudes of the dam. I
have ſeen theſe animals, when taken earlier in the woods, become very tame;
and, indeed, they rather were diſpleaſing by being too familiar than too
ſhy. It were to be wiſhed that the experiment were tried upon ſuch as
theſe; and it is more than probable that it would produce the deſired
ſucceſs. Nevertheleſs, theſe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments are ſufficient to prove
that neither the wolf nor the fox are of the ſame nature with the dog, but
each of a ſpecies perfectly diſtinct, <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0823800103:351"/> and their
joint produce moſt probably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful.</p>
            <p>The dog, when firſt whelped, is not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely finiſhed
animal. In this kind, as in all the reſt which bring forth many at a time,
the young are not ſo perfect as in thoſe which bring forth but one or two.
They are always produced with the eyes cloſed, the lids being held together,
not by ſticking, but by a kind of thin membrane, which is torn as ſoon as
the upper eye-lid becomes ſtrong enough to raiſe it from the under. In
general, their eyes are not opened till ten or twelve days old. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that
time, the bones of the ſcull are not completed, the body is puffed up, the
noſe is ſhort, and the whole form but ill ſketched out. In leſs than a
month the puppy begins to uſe all its ſenſes; and, from thence, makes
haſty advances to its perfection. At the fourth month the dog loſes ſome
of his teeth, as in other animals, and theſe are renewed by ſuch as never
fall. The number of theſe amount to forty-two, which is twelve more than is
found in any of the cat kind, which are known never to have above thirty. The
teeth of the dog being his great and only weapon, are formed in a manner much
more ſerviceable than thoſe of the former; and there is ſcarce any
quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0823800103:352"/> that has a greater facility in rending,
cutting, or chewing its food. He cuts with his inciſors, or fore-teeth, he
holds with his four great canine teeth, and he chews his meat with his
grinders; theſe are fourteen in number, and ſo placed that, when the jaws
are ſhut, there remains a diſtance between them, ſo that the dog, by
opening his mouth ever ſo wide, does not loſe the power of his jaws. But it
is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the cat kind, whoſe inciſors or cutting teeth are very
ſmall, and whoſe grinding teeth, when brought together, touch more
cloſely than thoſe of the dog, and, conſequently, have leſs power.
Thus, for inſtance, I can ſqueeze any thing more forcibly between my thumb
and fore finger, where the diſtance is greater, than between any other two
fingers, whoſe diſtance from each other is leſs.</p>
            <p>This animal is capable of reproducing at the age of twelve

are leſs delicate in their food; and yet there are many kinds of birds which
the dog will not venture to touch. He is even known, although in a ſavage
ſtate, to abſtain from injuring ſome which one might ſuppoſe he had
every reaſon to oppoſe. The dogs and the vultures which live wild about
Grand Cairo in Egypt, (for the Mahometan law has expelled this uſeful animal
from human ſociety) continue together in a very ſociable and friendly
manner<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>. As they are both uſeful in devouring ſuch carcaſes as
might otherwiſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefy, and thus infect the air, the inhabitants ſupply
them with proviſions every day, in order to keep them near the city. Upon
theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, the quadrupedes and birds are often ſeen together
tearing the ſame piece of fleſh, without the leaſt enmity; on the
contrary, they are known to live together with a kind of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and bring
up their young in the ſame neſt.</p>
            <p>Although the dog is a voracious animal, yet he can bear hunger for a
very long time. We have an inſtance, in the Memoirs of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy of
Sciences, of this kind, in which a bitch that had been forgotten in a
country-houſe, lived forty days, without any other nouriſhment 
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0823800103:354"/> than the wool of a quilt which ſhe had torn in pieces.
It ſhould ſeem that water is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the dog than food; he
drinks often, though not abundantly; and it is commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that when
abridged in water, he runs mad. This dreadful malady, the conſequences of
which are ſo well known, is the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience that reſults from
the keeping this faithful domeſtic. But it is a diſorder by no means ſo
frequent as the terrors of the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous would ſuppoſe; the dog has been
often accuſed of madneſs, without a fair trial; and ſome perſons have
been ſuppoſed to receive their deaths from his bite, when either their own
ill-grounded fears, or their natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders were the true cauſe.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>THE WOLF.</head>
               <p>THE dog and the wolf are ſo very much alike internally, that the
moſt expert anatomiſts can ſcarce perceive the difference; and it may be
aſſerted alſo, that, externally, ſome dogs more nearly reſemble the
wolf than they do each other. It was this ſtrong ſimilitude that firſt
led ſome naturaliſts to conſider them as the ſame animal, and to look
upon the wolf as the dog in its ſtate of ſavage freedom: however, 
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0823800103:355"/> this opinion is entertained no longer; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
antipathy thoſe two animals bear to each other; the longer time which the
wolf goes with young than the dog, the one going over an hundred days, and the
other not quite ſixty; the longer period of life in the former than the
latter, the wolf living twenty years, the dog not fifteen; all ſufficiently
point out a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, and draw a line that muſt for ever keep them
aſunder.</p>
               <p>The wolf, from the tip of the noſe, to the inſertion of the
tail, is about three feet ſeven inches long, and about two feet five inches
high; which ſhews him to be larger than our great breed of maſtiffs, which
are ſeldom found to be above three feet by two. His colour is a mixture of
black, brown, and grey, extremely rough and hard, but mixed towards the roots
with a kind of aſh coloured fur. In comparing him to any of our well known
breed of dogs, the great Dane, or mongrel greyhound, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he will
appear to have the legs ſhorter, the head larger, the muzzle thicker, the
eyes ſmaller and more ſeparated from each other, and the ears ſhorter and
ſtraiter. He appears, in every reſpect, ſtronger than the dog; and the
length of his hair contributes ſtill more to his robuſt appearance. The
feature which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0823800103:356"/> diſtinguiſhes the
viſage of the wolf from that of the dog, is the eye, which opens
ſlant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly upwards, in the ſame direction with the noſe; whereas, in the
dog, it opens more at right angles with the noſe, as in man. The tail alſo,
in this animal, is long and buſhy; and he carries it rather more between his
hind legs than the dog is ſeen to do. The colour of the eye-balls in the wolf
are of a fiery green, and give his viſage a fierce and formidable air, which
his natural diſpoſition does by no means contradict<note n="*" place="bottom">The reſt of this hiſtory of the wolf is taken from Mr. Buffon,
and I look upon it as a complete model for natural hiſtory. If I add or
differ, I mark it as uſual.</note>.</p>
               <p>The wolf is one of thoſe animals whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite for animal
food is the moſt vehement; and whoſe means of ſatisfying this appetite
are the moſt various. Nature has furniſhed him with ſtrength, cunning,
agility, and all thoſe requiſites which fit an animal for purſuing,
overtaking, and conquering its prey; and yet, with all theſe, the wolf moſt
frequently dies of hunger, for he is the declared enemy of man. Being long
proſcribed, and a reward offered for his head, he is obliged to fly from
human habitations, and to live in the foreſt, where the few wild animals to
be found there, eſcape him <pb n="308" facs="tcp:0823800103:357"/> either by their
ſwiftneſs or their art; or are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in too ſmall a proportion to
ſatisfy his rapacity. He is naturally dull and cowardly; but frequently
diſappointed, and as often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the verge of famine, he becomes
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious from want, and courageous from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. When preſſed with
hunger, he braves danger, and comes to attack thoſe animals which are under
the protection of man, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſuch as he can readily carry away,
lambs, ſheep, or even dogs themſelves, for all animal food comes then
equally agreeable. When this excurſion has ſucceeded, he often returns to
the charge, until having been wounded or hard preſſed by the dogs, or the
ſhepherds, he hides himſelf by day in the thickeſt coverts, and only
ventures out at night; he then ſallies forth over the country, keeps peering
round the villages, carries off ſuch animals as are not under protection,
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks the ſheep-folds, ſcratches up and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the threſholds of
doors where they are houſed, enters furious, and deſtroys all before he
begins to ſix upon and carry off his prey. When theſe ſallies do not
ſucceed, he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the thickeſt part of the foreſt, content to
purſue thoſe ſmaller animals, which, even when taken, afford him but a
ſcanty ſupply. <pb n="309" facs="tcp:0823800103:358"/> He there goes regularly to work,
follows by the ſcent, opens to the view, ſtill keeps follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hopeleſs
himſelf of overtaking the prey, but expecting that ſome other wolf will
come into his aſſiſtance, and then content to ſhare the ſpoil. At
laſt, when his neceſſities are very urgent, he boldly faces certain
deſtruction; he attacks women and children, and ſometimes ventures even to
fall upon men, becomes furious by his continual agitations, and ends his life
in madneſs.</p>
               <p>The wolf, as well externally as internally, ſo nearly
reſembles the dog, that he ſeems mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delled upon the ſame plan; and yet he
only offers the reverſe of the medal. If his form be like, his nature is ſo
different, that he only preſerves the ill qualities of the dog, without any
of his good ones. Indeed, they are ſo different in their diſpoſitions,
that no two animals can have a more perfect antipathy to each other. A young
dog ſhudders at the ſight of a wolf; he even ſhuns his ſcent, which,
though unknown, is ſo repugnant to his nature, that he comes trembling to
take protection near his maſter. A dog who is ſtronger, and who knows his
ſtrength, briſtles up at the ſight, teſtifies his animoſity, attacks
him with courage, endeavours to put him to ſlight, and does all in his power 
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0823800103:359"/> to rid himſelf of a preſence that is hateful to him.
They never meet without either flying or fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; fighting for life and
death, and without mercy on either ſide. If the wolf is the ſtronger, he
tears and devours his prey: the dog, on the contrary, is more generous, and
contents himſelf with his victory; he does not ſeem to think that 
<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>the body of a dead enemy ſmells
well;</hi>
                  </q> he leaves him where he falls, to ſerve as food for birds of
prey, or for other wolves, ſince they devour each other; and when one wolf
happens to be deſperately wounded, the reſt track him by his blood, and are
ſure to ſhew him no mercy.</p>
               <p>The dog, even in his ſavage ſtate, is not cruel; he is
eaſily tamed, and continues firmly attached to his maſter. The wolf, when
taken young, becomes tame, but never has an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment; nature is ſtronger
in him than edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; he reſumes, with age, his natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
and returns, as ſoon as he can, to the woods from whence he was taken. Dogs,
even of the dulleſt kinds, ſeek the company of other animals; they are
naturally diſpoſed to follow and accompany other creatures beſide
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and even by inſtinct, without any edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, take to the care
of flocks and herds. The wolf, on the contrary, is the enemy of all 
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0823800103:360"/> ſociety; he does not even keep much company with
thoſe of his kind. When they are ſeen in packs together, it is not to be
conſidered as a peaceful ſociety, but a combination for war: they teſtify
their hoſtile intentions by their loud howlings, and by their fierceneſs
diſcover a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for attacking ſome great animal, ſuch as a ſtag or
a bull, or to deſtroy ſome more redoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able watch-dog. The inſtant their
military ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition is completed, their ſociety is at an end; they then
part, and each returns in ſilence to his ſolitary retreat. There is not
even any ſtrong attachments between the male and female; they ſeek each
other only once a year, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main but a few days together: they always couple
in winter; at which time ſeveral males are ſeen following one female, and
this aſſociation is ſtill more bloody than the former: they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
moſt cruelly, growl, bark, fight, and tear each other; and it ſometimes
happens that the majority kill the wolf which has been chiefly preferred by the
female. It is uſual for the ſhe wolf to fly from them all with him ſhe
has choſen; and watches this opportunity when the reſt are aſleep.</p>
               <p>The ſeaſon for coupling does not continue above twelve or
fifteen days; and uſually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences among the oldeſt, thoſe which are 
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0823800103:361"/> young being later in their deſires. The males have no
fixed time for engendering; they paſs from one female to the other, beginning
at the end of December, and ending at the latter end of February. The time of
pregnancy is about three months and an half; and the young wolves are found
from the latter end of April to the beginning of July. The long continuance of
the wolf's pregnancy is ſufficient to make a diſtinction between it and the
dog; did not alſo the fiery fierceneſs of the eyes, the howl inſtead of
barking, and the greater duration of its life, leave no doubt of its being an
animal of its own particular ſpecies. In other reſpects, however, they are
entirely alike; the wolf couples exactly like the dog, the parts are formed in
the ſame manner, and their ſeparation hindered by the ſame cauſe. When
the ſhe-wolves are near their time of bringing forth, they ſeek ſome very
tufted ſpot, in the thickeſt part of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; in the middle of this
they make a ſmall opening, cutting away the thorns and briars with their
teeth, and afterwards carry thither a great quantity of moſs, which they form
into a bed for their young ones. They generally bring forth five or ſix, and
ſometimes even to nine at a litter. The cubs are brought forth, like thoſe
of the bitch, with the eyes cloſed; <pb n="313" facs="tcp:0823800103:362"/> the dam ſuckles
them for ſome weeks, and teaches them betimes to eat fleſh, which ſhe
prepares for them, by chewing it firſt herſelf. Some time after ſhe
brings them ſtronger food, hares, partridges, and birds yet alive. The young
wolves begin by playing with them, and end by killing them. The dam then
ſtrips them of their feathers, tears them in pieces, and gives to each of
them a ſhare. They do not leave the den where they have been littered, till
they are ſix weeks, or two months old. They then follow the old one, who
leads them to drink to the trunk of ſome old tree where the water has
ſettled, or at ſome pool in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. If ſhe apprehends any
danger, ſhe inſtantly conceals them in the firſt convenient place, or
brings them back to their former retreat. In this manner they follow her for
ſome months; when they are attacked, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends them with all her
ſtrength, and more than uſual ferocity. Although, at other times, more
timorous than the male, at that ſeaſon ſhe becomes bold and fearleſs;
willing perhaps to teach the young ones future courage by her own example. It
is not till they are about ten or twelve months old, and until they have ſhed
their firſt teeth, and completed the new, that ſhe thinks them in a
capacity to ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <pb n="314" facs="tcp:0823800103:363"/> Then when they
have acquired arms from nature, and have learned induſtry and courage from
her example, ſhe declines all future care of them, being again engaged in
bringing up a new progeny.</p>
               <p>The males and females are in a capacity to engender when two years
old. It is probable that the females of this ſpecies, as well as of moſt
others, are ſooner completed than the males; but this is certain, that they
never deſire to copulate until their ſecond winter; from whence we may
ſuppoſe that they live fifteen or twenty years; for allowing three years
for their complete growth, this multiplied by ſeven gives them a life of
twenty-one; moſt animals, as has been obſerved, living about ſeven times
the number of years which they take to come to perfection. Of this, however,
there is as yet no certainty, no more than of what huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men aſſert, that
in all the litters there are more males than females. From them alſo we learn
that there are ſome of the males who attach themſelves to the female, who
accompany her during her geſtation, until the time of bringing forth, when
ſhe hides the place of her retreat from the male, leſt he ſhould devour
her cubs. But after this, when they are brought forth, that the then takes the
ſame care of them as the <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0823800103:364"/> female, carries them
proviſions, and, if the dam ſhould happen to be killed, rears them up in
her ſtead.</p>
               <p>The wolf grows grey as he grows old, and his teeth wear, like
thoſe of moſt other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, by uſing. He ſleeps when his belly is
full, or when he is fatigued, rather by day than night; and always, like the
dog, is very eaſily waked. He drinks frequently; and in times of drought,
when there is no water to be found in the trunks of old trees, or in the pools
about the foreſt, he comes often, in the day, down to the brooks, or the
lakes in the plain. Although very voracious, he ſupports hunger for a long
time, and often lives four or five days without food, provided he be ſupplied
with water.</p>
               <p>The wolf has great ſtrength, particularly in his fore-parts, in
the muſcles of his neck and his jaws. He carries off a ſheep in his mouth
without letting it touch the ground, and runs with it much ſwifter than the
ſhepherds who purſue him; ſo that nothing but the dogs can overtake, and
oblige him to quit his prey. He bites cruelly, and always with greater
vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence in proportion as he his leaſt reſiſted; for he uſes
precautions with ſuch animals as attempt to ſtand upon the defenſive. He
is ever cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly, <pb n="316" facs="tcp:0823800103:365"/> and never fights but when under a
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſatisfying hunger, or making good his retreat. When he is
wounded by a bullet, he is heard to cry out; and yet, when ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the
peaſants, and attacked with clubs, he never howls as the dog under
correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but defends himſelf in ſilence, and dies as hard as he
lived.</p>
               <p>His nature is, in fact, more ſavage than that of the dog; he has
leſs ſenſibility and greater ſtrength. He travels, runs, and keeps
plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering for whole days and nights together. He is in a manner
indefatigable; and perhaps of all animals he is the moſt difficult to be
hunted down. The dog is good natured and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous; the wolf, though
ſavage, is ever fearful. If he happens to be caught in a pit-fall, he is for
ſome time ſo frightened and aſtoniſhed, that he may be killed without
offering to reſiſt, or taken alive without much danger. At that inſtant,
one may clap a collar round his neck, muzzle him, and drag him along, without
his ever giving the leaſt ſigns of anger or reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At all other
times he has his ſenſes in great perfection; his eye, his car, and
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly his ſenſe of ſmelling, which is even ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to the two
former. He ſmells a carcaſe at more than a league's diſtance; he alſo
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives <pb n="317" facs="tcp:0823800103:366"/> living animals a great way off, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
them a long time upon the ſcent. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he leaves the wood, he always
takes care to go out againſt the wind. When juſt come to its extremity, he
ſtops to examine, by his ſmell, on all ſides, the emanations that may
come either from his enemy or his prey, which he very nicely diſtinguiſhes.
He prefers thoſe animals which he kills himſelf to thoſe he finds dead;
and yet he does not diſdain theſe when no better is to be had. He is
particularly fond of human fleſh; and perhaps, if he were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
powerful, he would eat no other. Wolves have been ſeen following armies, and
arriving in numbers upon the field of battle, where they devoured ſuch dead
bodies as were left upon the field, or but negligently interred. Theſe, when
once accuſtomed to human fleſh, ever after ſeek particularly to attack
mankind, and chuſe to fall upon the ſhepherd rather than his flock. We have
had a late inſtance of two or three of theſe keeping a whole province, for
more than a month, in a continual alarm.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes happens that a whole country is called out to
extirpate theſe moſt dangerous invaders. The hunting the wolf is a
favourite diverſion among the great of ſome countries; and it muſt be
confeſſed it ſeems to be the moſt <pb n="318" facs="tcp:0823800103:367"/> uſeful of
any. Theſe animals are diſtinguiſhed by the huntſmen into the <hi>young
wolf,</hi> the <hi>old wolf,</hi> and the <hi>great wolf.</hi> They are known
by the prints of their feet; the older the wolf, the larger the track he
leaves. That of the female is narrower and longer than that of the male. It is
neceſſary to have a very good ſtarter to put up the wolf; and it is even
convenient to uſe every art to encourage him in his purſuit; for all dogs
have a natural repugnance againſt this animal, and are but cold in their
endeavours. When the wolf is once put up, it is then proper to have grey-hounds
to let fly at him, in leaſhes, one after the other. The firſt leaſh is
ſent after him in the beginning, ſeconded by a man on horſe-back; the
ſecond are let looſe about half a mile farther, and the third when the
reſt of the dogs come up with, and begin to bait him. He for a long time
keeps them off, ſtands his ground, threatens them on all ſides, and often
gets away; but uſually the hunters arriving come in aid of the dog, and help
to diſpatch him with their cutlaſſes. When the animal is killed, the dogs
teſtify no appetite to enjoy their victory, but leave him where he falls, a
frightful ſpectacle, and even in death hideous.</p>
               <p>The wolf is ſometimes alſo hunted with har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, but as he
always goes ſtraight forward, <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0823800103:368"/> and often holds his
ſpeed for a whole day toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this kind of chace is tedious and
diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, at leaſt if the harriers are not aſſiſted by grey
hounds, who may harraſs him at every view. Several other arts have been
alſo uſed to take and deſtroy this noxious animal. He is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
and wounded by men and large houſe-dogs; he is ſecured in traps; he is
poiſoned by carcaſes prepared and placed for that purpoſe, and is caught
in pit-falls.

multiplying in great numbers, particularly in countries where the woods are

However, ſome centuries after, theſe animals were again encreaſed to
ſuch a degree, as to become the <pb n="320" facs="tcp:0823800103:369"/> object of royal
attention; accordingly Edward the Firſt iſſued out his mandate to one
Peter Corbet to ſuperintend and aſſiſt in the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.
They are ſaid to have infeſted Ireland long after they were extirpated in
Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; however, the oldeſt men in that country remember nothing of theſe
animals; and it is probable that there have been none there for more than a
century paſt. Scotland alſo is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally free.</p>
               <p>The colour of this animal differs according to the different
climates where it is bred, and often changes even in the ſame country.
Beſide the common wolves, which are found in France and Germany, there are
others with thicker hair, inclining to yellow. Theſe are more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage and
leſs noxious than the former, neither approaching the flocks nor habitations,
and living rather by the chace than rapine. In the northern climates they are
found ſome quite black, and ſome white all over. The former are larger and
ſtronger than thoſe of any other kinds.</p>
               <p>The ſpecies is very much diffuſed in every part of the world,
being found in Aſia, Africa, and in America, as well as Europe. The wolves of
Senegal reſemble thoſe of France, except that they are larger and much
fiercer than thoſe <pb n="321" facs="tcp:0823800103:370"/> of Europe. Thoſe of Egypt are
ſmaller than thoſe of Greece. In the eaſt, the wolf is trained up for a
ſhew, being taught to dance and play tricks; and one of theſe thus educated
often ſells for four or five hundred crowns. 
<q rend="inline">"It is ſaid that in Lapland the wolf will never
attack a rein-deer that is ſeen haltered; for this wary animal, being well
acquainted with the nature of a trap, ſuſpects one wherever it perceives a
rope. However, when he ſees the deer entirely at liberty, he ſeldom fails
to deſtroy it. 
<p>"The wolf of North America is blacker and much leſs than
thoſe in other parts of the world, and approaches nearer in form to the dog
than thoſe of the ordinary kind<note n="*" place="bottom">

of as ſuch by the ſavages till the Europeans introduced others; and even
now, on the remoter ſhores, or the more inland parts of the country, the
ſavages ſtill make uſe of theſe animals in hunting. They are very tame
and gentle; and thoſe of this kind that are wild are neither ſo large nor
ſo fierce as an European wolf, nor do they ever attack mankind. They go
together in large packs by night to hunt the deer, which they do as well as any
dogs in England; and it is confidently aſſerted that one 
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0823800103:371"/> of them is ſufficient to run down a deer<note n="*" place="bottom">

they are ſeen along the banks of thoſe rivers near which the wandering
natives pitch their huts, it is taken for granted that the biſon or the deer
are not far off; and the ſavages affirm that the wolves come with the
tidings, in order to have the garbage, after the animal has been killed by the
hunters. Cateſby adds a circumſtance relative to theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which,
if true, invalidates many of Mr. Buffon's obſervations in the foregoing
hiſtory. He aſſerts, that theſe being the only dogs uſed by the
Americans, before the arrival of the Europeans among them, they have ſince
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered together, and that their breed has become prolific; which proves
the dog and the wolf to be of the ſame ſpecies. It were to be wiſhed that
this fact were better aſcertained; we ſhould then know to a certainty in
what a degree the dog and wolf reſemble each other, as well in nature as in
conformation; we might then, perhaps, be enabled to improve the breed of our
dogs, by bringing them back to their native forms and inſtincts; we might, by
croſſing the ſtrain, reſtore that race of thoſe bold animals, which
the ancients aſſure us were more than a match for the lion."</p>

               <head>THE FOX.</head>
               <p>THE Fox very exactly reſembles the wolf and the dog internally;
and, although he differs greatly from both in ſize and carriage, yet when we
come to examine his ſhapes minutely, there will appear to be very little
difference in the deſcription. Were, for inſtance, a painter to draw from a
natural hiſtorian's exacteſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription the figure of a dog, a wolf,
and a fox, without having ever ſeen either, he would be very apt to confound
all theſe animals together; or rather he would be unable to catch thoſe
pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <pb n="324" facs="tcp:0823800103:376"/> out-lines that no deſcription can ſupply.
Words will never give any perſon an exact idea of forms any way irregular;
for although they be extremely juſt and preciſe, yet the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
diſcriminations to be attended to will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found each other, and we ſhall
no more conceive the preciſe form than we ſhould be able to tell when one
pebble more was added or taken away from a thouſand. To conceive, therefore,
how the fox differs in form from the wolf or the dog, it is neceſſary to
ſee all three, or at leaſt to ſupply the defects of deſcription by
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the difference in a print.</p>
               <p>The fox is of a ſlenderer make than the wolf, and not near ſo
large; for as the former is above three feet and a half long, ſo the other is
not above two feet three inches. The tail of the fox alſo is longer in
proportion and more buſhy; its noſe is ſmaller and approaching more
nearly to that of the grey-hound, and its hair ſofter. On the other hand, it
differs from the dog in having its eyes obliquely ſituated, like thoſe of
the wolf; its ears are directed alſo in the ſame manner as thoſe of the
wolf, and its head is equally large in proportion to its ſize. It differs
ſtill more from the dog in its ſtrong offenſive ſmell, which is
peculiar to the ſpecies, and often the cauſe of their death. However,
ſome are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly of opinion that it will keep off infectious 
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0823800103:377"/> diſeaſes, and they preſerve this animal near their
habitations for that very purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The fox has ſince the beginning been famous for his cunning and
his arts, and he partly merits his reputation<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. Without attempting to
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe either the dogs or the ſhepherds, without attacking the flock, or
alarming the village, he finds an eaſier way to ſubſiſt, and gains by
his addreſs what is denied to his ſtrength or courage. Patient and prudent,
he waits the opportunity for depredation, and varies his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct with every
occaſion. His whole ſtudy is his preſervation; although nearly as
indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, and actually more ſwift than the wolf, he does not entirely
truſt to either, but makes himſelf an aſylum, to which he retires in
caſe of neceſſity; where he ſhelters himſelf from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and brings
up his young.</p>
               <p>As among men, thoſe who lead a domeſtic life are more
civilized and more endued with wiſdom than thoſe who wander from place to
place, ſo, in the inferior ranks of animated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the taking

choice of the ſituation for this domicil, the art of making it convenient, of
hiding its entrance, and ſecuring it againſt more powerful 
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0823800103:378"/> animals, are all ſo many marks of ſuperior ſkill
and induſtry. The fox is furniſhed with both, and turns them to his
advantage. He generally keeps his kennel at the edge of the wood, and yet
within an eaſy journey of ſome neighbouring cottage. From thence he
liſtens to the crowing of the cock, and the cackling of the domeſtic fowls.
He ſcents them at a diſtance; he ſeizes his opportunity, conceals his
approaches, creeps ſlyly along, makes the attack, and ſeldom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
without his booty. If he be able to get into the yard, he begins by levelling
all the poultry without remorſe, and carrying off a part of the ſpoil,
hides it at ſome convenient diſtance, and again returns to the charge.
Taking off another fowl in the ſame manner, he hides that alſo, but not in
the ſame place; and this he practiſes for ſeveral times together, until
the approach of day, or the noiſe of the domeſtics, give him warning to
retire. The ſame arts are practiſed when he finds birds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in
ſpringes laid for them by the fowler; the fox takes care to be beforehand,
very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertly takes the bird out of the ſnare, hides it for three or four
days, and knows very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly when and where to return to avail himſelf of
hidden treaſure. He is equally alert in ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the young hares and
rabbits, before they <pb n="327" facs="tcp:0823800103:379"/> have ſtrength enough to eſcape
him, and when the old ones are wounded and fatigued he is ſure to come upon
them in their moments of diſtreſs, and to ſhew them no mercy. In the
ſame manner he finds out birds neſts, ſeizes the partridge and the quail
while ſitting, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys a large quantity of game. The wolf is moſt
hurtful to the peaſant, but the fox to the gentleman. In ſhort, nothing
that can be eaten ſeems to come amiſs; rats, mice, ſerpents, toads, and
lizards. He will, when urged by hunger, eat carrots and inſects; and thoſe
that live near the ſea-coaſts will, for want of other food, eat crabs,
ſhrimps, and ſhell fiſh. The hedge-hog in vain rolls itſelf up into a
ball to oppoſe him, this determined glutton teizes it until it is obliged to
appear uncovered, and then he devours it. The waſp and the wild bee are
attacked with equal ſucceſs. Although at firſt they fly out upon their
invader, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually oblige him to retire, this is but for a few minutes,
until he has rolled himſelf upon the ground, and thus cruſhed ſuch as
ſtick to his ſkin; he then returns to the charge, and at laſt, by
perſeverance, obliges them to abandon their combs; which he greedily devours,
both wax and honey.</p>
               <p>The chace of the fox requires leſs preparation 
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0823800103:380"/> than that of the wolf, and it is alſo more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
and amuſing. As dogs have a natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance to purſue the wolf, ſo
they are equally alert in following the fox; which chace they prefer even to
that of the hare or the buck. The huntſmen, as upon other occaſions, have
their cant terms for every part of this chace. The fox the firſt year is
called <hi>a cub</hi>; the ſecond, <hi>a fox</hi>; and the third, an <hi>old
fox</hi>; his tail is called the <hi>bruſh</hi> or <hi>drag,</hi> and his
excrement the <hi>billiting.</hi> He is uſually purſued by a large kind of
harrier or hound, aſſiſted by tarriers, or a ſmaller breed, that follow
him into his kennel, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack him there. The inſtant he perceives
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf purſued, he makes to his kennel, and takes refuge at the bottom of
it, where for a while he loſes the cry of his enemies; but the whole pack
coming to the mouth, redouble their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence and rage, and the little tarrier
boldly ventures in. It often happens that the kennel is made under a rock, or
among the roots of old trees; and in ſuch caſes the fox cannot be dug out,
nor is the tarrier able to contend with him at the bottom of his hole. By this
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance he continues ſecure; but when he can be dug out, the uſual way
is to carry him in a bag to ſome open country, and there ſet him looſe
before the hounds. The hounds and the <pb n="329" facs="tcp:0823800103:381"/> men follow,
barking and ſhouting wherever he runs; and the body being ſtrongly
employed, the mind has not time to make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the futility of the
purſuit. What adds to this entertainment is the ſtrong ſcent which the
fox leaves, that always keeps up a full cry; although as his ſcent is
ſtronger than that of the hare, it is much ſooner evaporated. His ſhifts
to eſcape when all retreat is cut off to his kennel are various and
ſurprizing. He always chuſes the moſt woody country, and takes thoſe
paths that are moſt embarraſſed with thorns and briars. He does not
double, nor uſe the unavailing ſhifts of the hare; but flies in a direct
line before the hounds, though at no very great diſtance; manages his
ſtrength; takes to the low and plaſhy grounds, where the ſcent will be
leſs apt to lie; and at laſt, when overtaken, he defends himſelf with
deſperate obſtinacy, and fights in ſilence to the very laſt gaſp.</p>
               <p>The fox, though reſembling the dog in many reſpects, is
nevertheleſs very diſtinct in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, refuſing to engender with it;
and though not teſtifying the antipathy of the wolf, yet diſcovering
nothing more than indifference. This animal alſo brings forth fewer at a time
than the dog, and that but once a year. Its <pb n="330" facs="tcp:0823800103:382"/> litter is
generally from four to ſix, and ſeldom leſs than three. The female goes
with young about ſix weeks, and ſeldom ſtirs out while pregnant, but
makes a bed for her young, and takes every precaution to prepare for their
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. When ſhe finds the place of their retreat diſcovered, and that
her young have been diſturbed during her abſence, ſhe removes them one
after the other in her mouth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to find them out a place of
better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. A remarkable inſtance of this animal's parental affection
happened while I was writing this hiſtory, in the county of Eſſex. A
ſhe-fox that had, as it ſhould ſeem, but one cub, was unkennelled by a
gentleman's hounds, near Chelmsford, and hotly purſued. In ſuch a caſe,
when her own life was in imminent peril, one would think it was not a time to
conſult the ſafety of her young; however, the poor animal, braving every
danger, rather than leave her cub behind to be worried by the dogs, took it up
in her mouth, and ran with it in this manner for ſome miles. At laſt,
taking her way through a farmer's yard, ſhe was aſſaulted by a maſtiff,
and at laſt obliged to drop her cub, which was taken up by the farmer. I was
not diſpleaſed to hear that this faithful creature eſcaped the purſuit,
and at laſt got off in ſafety. <pb n="331" facs="tcp:0823800103:383"/> The cubs of the fox
are born blind, like thoſe of the dog; they are eighteen months or two years
in coming to perfection, and live about twelve or fourteen years.</p>
               <p>As the fox makes war upon all animals, ſo all others ſeem to
make war upon him. The dog hunts him with peculiar acrimony; the wolf is
ſtill a greater and more neceſſitous enemy, who purſues him to his very
retreat. Some pretend to ſay that, to keep the wolf away, the fox lays at the
mouth of its kennel a certain herb, to which the wolf has a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
averſion. This, which no doubt is a fable, at leaſt ſhews that theſe
two animals are as much enemies to each other as to all the reſt of animated
nature. But the fox is not hunted by quadrupedes alone; for the birds, who know
him for their mortal enemy, attend him in his excurſions, and give each other
warning of their approaching danger. The daw, the magpye, and the black bird
conduct him along, perching on the hedges as he creeps below, and, with their
cries and notes of hoſtility, apprize all other animals to beware; a caution
which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtand, and put into practice. The hunters
themſelves are often informed by the birds of the place of his retreat, and
ſet the dogs into thoſe thickets where they ſee them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly 
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0823800103:384"/> noiſy and querulous. So that it is the fate of this
petty plunderer to be deteſted by every rank of animals; all the weaker
claſſes ſhun, and all the ſtronger purſue him.</p>
               <p>The fox, of all wild animals, is moſt ſubject to the influence
of climate; and there are found as many varieties in this kind almoſt as in
any of the domeſtic animals<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon,
Renard.</bibl>
                  </note>. The generality of foxes, as is well known, are red; but
there are ſome, though not in England, of a greyiſh caſt; and Mr. Buffon
aſſerts that the tip of the tail in all foxes is white; which, however, is
not ſo in thoſe of this country. There are only three varieties of this
animal in Great Britain, and theſe are rather eſtabliſhed upon a
difference of ſize than of colour or form. The grey-hound fox is the
largeſt, talleſt, and boldeſt; and will attack a grown ſheep. The
maſtiff fox is leſs, but more ſtrongly built. The cur fox is the leaſt
and moſt common; he lurks about hedges and out-houſes, and is the moſt
pernicious of the three to the peaſant and farmer.</p>
               <p>In the colder countries round the pole, the foxes are of all
colours; black, blue, grey, iron grey, ſilver grey, white, white with red

                  </note>. The common kind, however, is
more univerſally diffuſed than any of the former, being found in Europe, in
the temperate climates of Aſia, and alſo in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; they are very rare in
Africa, and in the countries lying under the torrid zone. Thoſe travellers
who talk of having ſeen them at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licut, and other parts of Southern India,
have miſtaken the jackall for the fox. The fur of the white fox is held in no
great eſtimation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the hair falls off; the blue fox ſkins are
alſo bought up with great avidity, from their ſcarceneſs; but the black
fox ſkin is of all others the moſt eſteemed, a ſingle ſkin often
ſelling for forty or fifty crowns. The hair of theſe is ſo diſpoſed,
that it is impoſſible to tell which way the grain lies; for if we hold the
ſkin by the head the hair hangs to the tail, and if we hold it by the tail it
hangs down equally ſmooth and even to the head. Theſe are often made into
men's muffs, and are at once very beautiful and warm. In our temperate climate,
however, furs are of very little ſervice, there being ſcarce any weather
ſo ſevere in England from which our ordinary cloaths may not very well
defend us.</p>

               <head>THE JACKALL.</head>
               <p>THE Jackall is one of the commoneſt wild animals in the whole
eaſt; and yet there is ſcarce any leſs known in Europe, or more
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly deſcribed by natural hiſtorians. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, we are
aſſured that it reſembles the fox in figure and diſpoſition, but we
are ſtill ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of thoſe nice diſtinctions by which it is known to be
of a different ſpecies. It is ſaid to be of the ſize of a middling dog,
reſembling the fox in the hinder parts, particularly the tail; and the wolf
in the fore-parts, eſpecially the noſe. Its legs are ſhorter than thoſe
of the fox, and its colour is of a bright yellow, or ſorrel, as we expreſs
it in horſes. This is the reaſon it has been called in Latin the Golden
Wolf; a name, however, which is entirely unknown in the countries where they
are moſt common.</p>
               <p>The ſpecies of the jackall is diffuſed all over Aſia, and is
found alſo in moſt parts of Africa, ſeeming to take up the place of the
wolf, which in thoſe countries is not ſo common. There ſeems to be many
varieties among them; thoſe of the warmeſt climates appear to be the
largeſt, and their colour is rather of a reddiſh brown than of that
beautiful yellow by which the ſmaller jackall are chiefly
diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:0823800103:390"/>Although the ſpecies of the wolf
approaches very near to that of the dog, yet the jackall ſeems to be placed
between them; to the ſavage fierceneſs of the wolf it adds the impudent
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity of the dog<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon vol. xxvii. p.
52.</bibl>
                  </note>. Its cry is an howl, mixed with barking, and a lamentation
reſembling that of human diſtreſs. It is more noiſy in its pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
even than the dog, and more voracious than the wolf. The jackall never goes
alone, but always in a pack of forty or fifty together. Theſe unite regularly
every day to form a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination againſt the reſt of the foreſt. Nothing
then can eſcape them; they are content to take up with the ſmalleſt
animals; and yet, when thus united, have they courage to face the largeſt.
They ſeem very little afraid of mankind; but purſue their game to their
very doors, without teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either attachment or apprehenſion. They
enter inſolently into the ſheep-folds, the yards, and the ſtables, and,
when they can find nothing elſe, devour the leather harneſs, boots, and
ſhoes, and run off with what they have not time to ſwallow.</p>
               <p>They not only attack the living but the dead. They ſcratch up
with their feet the new made graves, and devour the corpſe how putrid
ſoever. <pb n="336" facs="tcp:0823800103:391"/> In thoſe countries therefore where they
abound, they are obliged to beat the earth over the grave, and to mix it with
thorns, to prevent the jackalls from ſcraping it away. They always
aſſiſt each other as well in this employment of exhumation as in that of
the chace. While they are at this dreary work, they exhort each other by a
moſt mournful cry, reſembling that of children under chaſtiſement; and
when they have thus dug up the body, they ſhare it ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably between them.
Theſe, like all other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage animals, when they have once taſted of
human fleſh, can never after refrain from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing mankind. They watch the
burying grounds, follow armies, and keep in the rear of caravans. They may be
conſidered as the vulture of the quadrupede kind; every thing that once had
animal life, ſeems equally agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them; the moſt putrid
ſubſtances are greedily devoured; dried leather, and any thing that has
been rubbed with greaſe, how inſipid ſoever in itſelf, is ſufficient
to make the whole go down.</p>
               <p>They hide themſelves in holes by day, and ſeldom appear abroad
till night-fall, when the jackall that has firſt hit upon the ſcent of
ſome larger beaſt gives notice to the reſt by an howl, 
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0823800103:392"/> which it repeats as it runs; while all the reſt, that
are within hearing, pack in to its aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The gazelle, or whatever
other beaſt it may be, finding itſelf purſued, makes off towards the
houſes and the towns; hoping, by that means, to deter its purſuers from
follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but hunger gives the jackall the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of boldneſs that
ſcar gives the gazelle, and it purſues even to the verge of the city, and
often along the ſtreets. The gazelle, however, by this means, moſt
frequently eſcapes; for the inhabitants ſallying our, often diſturb the
jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the chace; and as it hunts by the ſcent, when once driven off, it
never recovers it again. In this manner we ſee how experience prompts the
gazelle, which is naturally a very timid animal, and particularly fearful of
man himſelf, to take refuge near him, conſidering him as the leaſt
dangerous enemy, and often eſcaping by his aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>But man is not the only intruder upon the jackall's induſtry and
purſuits. The lion, the tiger, and the panther, whoſe appetites are
ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to their ſwiftneſs, attend to its call, and follow in ſilence
at ſome diſtance behind<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Linnaei Syſtema, p.
60.</bibl>
                  </note>. The jackall purſues the whole night with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing
aſſiduity, keeping up the cry, and with <pb n="338" facs="tcp:0823800103:393"/> great
perſeverance at laſt tires down its prey; but juſt at the moment it
ſuppoſes itſelf going to ſhare the fruits of its labour, the lion or
the leopard comes in, ſatiates himſelf upon the ſpoil, and his poor
provider muſt be content with the bare carcaſs he leaves behind. It is not
to be wondered at, therefore, if the jackall be voracious, ſince it ſo
ſeldom has a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency; nor that it feeds on putrid ſubſtances,
ſince it is not permitted to feaſt on what it has newly killed. Beſide
theſe enemies, the jackall has ſtill another to cope with, for between him
and the dog there is an irreconcileable anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, and they never part without
an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Indian peaſants often chace them as we do foxes; and have
learned, by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, when they have got a lion or a tiger in their rear.
Upon ſuch occaſions they keep their dogs cloſe, as they would be no match
for ſuch formidable animals, and endeavour to put them to flight with their
cries. When the lion is diſmiſſed, they more eaſily cope with the
jackall, who is as ſtupid as it is impudent, and ſeems much better fitted
for purſuing than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating. It ſometimes happens that one of them
ſteals ſilently into an outhouſe, to ſeize the poultry, or devour the
furniture, but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others in full cry without at a diſtance, 
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0823800103:394"/> without thought, it inſtantly anſwers the call, and
thus betrays its own depredations. The peaſants ſally out upon it, and the
fooliſh ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal finds, too late, that its inſtinct was too powerful for its
ſafety.</p>

               <head>THE ISATIS.</head>
               <p>AS the jackall is a ſort of intermediate ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies between the
dog and the wolf<note n="*" place="bottom">In this deſcription I have followed
Mr. Buffon.</note>, ſo the iſatis may be conſidered as placed between the
dog and the fox. This animal has hitherto been ſuppoſed to be only a
variety of the latter; but from the lateſt obſervations, there is no doubt
of their being perfectly diſtinct. The iſatis is very common in all the
northern countries bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon the Icy ſea; and is ſeldom found, except
in the coldeſt countries. It extremely reſembles a fox, in the form of its
body, and the length of its tail; and a dog, in the make of its head, and the
poſition of its eyes. The hair of theſe animals is ſofter than that of a
common fox; ſome are blue, ſome are white at one ſeaſon, and at another
of a ruſſet brown. Although the whole of its hair be two inches long,
thick, tufted and gloſſy, yet the under <pb n="340" facs="tcp:0823800103:395"/> jaw is
entirely without any, and the ſkin appears bare in that part.</p>
               <p>This animal can bear only the coldeſt climates, and is chiefly
ſeen along the coaſts of the Icy ſea, and upon the banks of the great
rivers that diſcharge themſelves therein. It is chiefly fond of living in
the open country, and ſeldom ſeen in the foreſt, being moſtly found in
the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous and naked regions of Norway, Siberia, and Lapland. It burrows,
like the fox; and when with young, the female retires to her kennel, in the
ſame manner as the fox is ſeen to do. Theſe holes, which are very narrow,
and extremely deep, have many out-lets. They are kept very clean, and are
bedded at the bottom with moſs, for the animal to be more at its eaſe. Its
manner of coupling, time of geſtation, and number of young, are all ſimilar
to what is found in the fox; and it uſually brings forth at the end of May,
or the beginning of June.</p>
               <p>Such are the particulars in which this animal differs from thoſe
of the dog kind, and in which it reſembles them: but its moſt ſtriking
peculiarity remains ſtill to be mentioned; namely, its changing its colour,
and being ſeen at one time brown, and at another perfectly white. As was
already ſaid, ſome are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally blue, and their colour never changes; but
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0823800103:396"/> ſuch as are to be white, are, when brought forth, of a
yellow hue, which, in the beginning of September, is changed to white, all
except along the top of the back, along which runs a ſtripe of brown, and
another croſſing it down the ſhoulders, at which time the animal is
called the <hi>croſt fox</hi>; however, this brown croſs totally
diſappears before winter, and then the creature is all over white, and its
fur is two inches long: this, about the beginning of May, again begins to fall;
and the molting is completed about the middle of July, when the iſatis
becomes brown once more. The fur of this animal is of no value, unleſs it be
killed in winter.</p>

               <head>THE HYAENA.</head>
               <p>THE hyaena is the laſt animal I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among thoſe
of the dog kind, which it in many reſpects reſembles, although too
ſtrongly marked to be ſtrictly reduced to any type. The hyaena is nearly of
the ſize of a wolf; and has ſome ſimilitude to that animal in the ſhape
of its head and body. The head, at firſt ſight, does not appear to differ,
except that the ears of the hyaena are longer, and more without hair; but, upon
obſerving more cloſely, we ſhall find the head broader, the noſe
ſlatter, and <pb n="342" facs="tcp:0823800103:397"/> not ſo pointed. The eyes are not placed
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, but more like thoſe of a dog. The legs, particularly the hinder,
are longer than thoſe either of the dog or the wolf, and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from all
other quadrupedes whatſoever, in having but four toes, as well on the fore
feet as on the hinder. Its hair is of a dirty greyiſh, marked with black,
diſpoſed in waves down its body. Its tail is ſhort, with pretty long
hair; and immediately under it, above the anus, there is an opening into a kind
of glandular pouch, which ſeparates a ſubſtance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
but not of the odour, of civet. This opening might have given riſe to the
error of the ancients, who aſſerted, that this animal was every year,
alternately, male and female. Such are the moſt ſtriking diſtinctions of
the hyaena, as given us by naturaliſts; which, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, convey but a
very confuſed idea of the peculiarity of its form. Its manner of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
head ſeems remarkable; ſomewhat like a dog, purſuing the ſcent, with
the noſe near the ground. The head being held thus low, the back appears
elevated, like that of the hog, which, with a long briſtly band of hair that
runs all along, gives it a good deal the air of that animal; and, it is
probable that, from this ſimilitude it firſt took its name, the word
<hi>huoina</hi> 
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:0823800103:398"/> being Greek, and derived from
<hi>hus,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a ſow.</p>
               <p>But no words can give an adequate idea of this animal's figure,
deformity, and fierceneſs, more ſavage and untameable than any other
quadrupede, it ſeems to be for ever in a ſtate of rage or rapacity, for
ever growling, except when receiving its food. Its eyes then gliſten, the
briſtles of its back all ſtand upright, its head hangs low, and yet its
teeth appear; all which give it a moſt frightful aſpect, which a dreadful
howl tends to heighten. This, which I have often heard, is very peculiar: its
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning reſembles the voice of a man moan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and its latter part as if
he were making a violent effort to vomit. As it is loud and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, it
might, perhaps, have been ſometimes miſtaken for that of a human voice in
diſtreſs, and have given riſe to the accounts of the ancients, who tell
us, that the hyaena makes its moan, to attract unwary travellers, and then to
deſtroy them: however this be, it ſeems the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable, and, for
its ſize, the moſt terrible of all other quadrupedes; nor does its courage
fall ſhort of its ferocity; it defends itſelf againſt the lion, is a
match for the panther, and attacks the ounce, that it ſeldom fails to
conquer.</p>
               <p>It is an obſcene and ſolitary animal, to be 
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0823800103:399"/> found chiefly in the moſt deſolate and unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
parts of the torrid zone, of which it is a native<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon.</bibl>
                  </note>. It reſides in the caverns of
mountains, in the clefts of rocks, or in dens that it has formed for itſelf
under the earth. Though taken never ſo young, it cannot be tamed; it lives by
depredation, like the wolf, but is much ſtronger, and more courageous. It
ſometimes attacks man, carries off cattle, follows the flock, breaks open the
ſheep cots by night, and ravages with inſatiable voracity. Its eyes ſhine
by night; and it is aſſerted, not without great appearance of truth, that
it ſees better by night than by day. When deſtitute of other proviſion,
it ſcrapes up the graves, and devours the dead bodies, how putrid ſo ever.
To theſe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, which are ſufficiently noxious and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable,
the ancients have added numberleſs others, which are long ſince known to be
fables; as, for inſtance, that the hyaena was male and female alternately;
that having brought forth and ſuckled its young, it then changed ſexes for
a year, and became a male. This, as was mentioned above, could only proceed
from the opening under the tail, which all animals of this ſpecies are found
to have; and which is found in the ſame manner in no other quadrupede,

the badger. There is, in the weaſel kind indeed, an opening, but it is lower
down, and not placed above the anus, as in the badger and the hyaena. Some have
ſaid that this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal changed the colour of its hair at will; others, that a
ſtone was found in its eye, which, put under a man's tongue, gave him the
gift of prophecy; ſome have ſaid that he had no joints in the neck, which,
however, all quadrupedes are known to have; and ſome, that the ſhadow of
the hyaena kept dogs from barking. Theſe, among many other abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

            <head>CHAP. IX. Of Animals of the Weaſel Kind.</head>
            <p>HAVING deſcribed the bolder ranks of carnivorous animals, we now
come to a minuter and more feeble claſs, leſs formidable indeed than any of
the former, but far more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and, in proportion to their ſize, more
active and enterprizing. The weaſel kind may be particularly
diſtinguiſhed from other car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivorous animals, by the length and
ſlenderneſs of their bodies, which are ſo fitted as to wind, like worms,
into very ſmall openings, after their prey; and hence alſo they have
received the name of vermin, from their ſimilitude to the worm in this
particular. Theſe animals differ from all of the cat kind, in the formation
and diſpoſition of their claws, which, as in the dog kinds, they can
neither draw in nor extend at pleaſure, as cats are known to do. They differ
from the dog kind, in being cloathed rather with fur than hair; and although
ſome varieties of the fox may reſemble them in this particular, yet the
coat of the latter is longer, ſtronger, and always more reſembling hair.
Beſide theſe diſtinctions, all animals of the <pb n="347" facs="tcp:0823800103:405"/>
weaſel kind have glands placed near the anus, that either open into it, or
beneath it, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſubſtance that, in ſome, has the moſt
offenſive ſmell in nature, in others, the moſt pleaſing perfume. All of
this kind are ſtill more marked by their habitudes and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
than their external form; cruel, vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and cowardly, they ſubſiſt
only by theft, and find their chief protection in their minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They are
all, from the ſhortneſs of their legs, ſlow in purſuit; and, therefore,
owe their ſupport to their patience, aſſiduity, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. As their
prey is precarious, they live a long time without food; and if they happen to
fall in where it is in plenty, they inſtantly deſtroy all about them before
they begin to ſatisfy their appetite, and ſuck the blood of every animal
before they begin to touch its fleſh.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the marks common to this kind, all the ſpecies of
which have a moſt ſtriking reſemblance to each other; and he that has
ſeen one, in ſome meaſure, may be ſaid to have ſeen all. The chief
diſtinction in this nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous claſs of animals, is to be taken from the
ſize; for no words can give the minute ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities of that outline by
which one ſpecies is to be diſtinguiſhed from that which is next 
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0823800103:406"/> it. I will begin, therefore, with the leaſt and the
beſt known of this kind, and ſtill marking the ſize, will proceed
gradually to larger and larger, until we come from the weaſel to the glutton,
which I take to be the largeſt of all. The weaſel will ſerve as a model
for all the reſt; and, indeed, the points in which they differ from this
little animal, are but very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable.</p>
            <p>The Weaſel<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Britiſh Zoology, vol.
i. p. 83.</bibl>
               </note>, as was ſaid, is the ſmalleſt of this numerous
tribe; its length not exceeding ſeven inches, from the tip of the noſe to
the inſertion of the tail. This length, however, ſeems to be very great, if
we compare it with the height of the animal, which is not above an inch and an
half. In meaſuring the wolf, we find him to be not above once and an half as
long as he is high; in obſerving the weaſel, we find it near five times as
long as it is high, which ſhews an amazing diſproportion. The tail alſo,
which is buſhy, is two inches and an half long, and adds to the apparent
length of this little animal's body. The colour of the weaſel is of a bright
red on the back and ſides, but white under the throat and the belly. It has
whiſkers like a cat; and thirty two teeth, which is two more than any of the
cat kind; and theſe <pb n="349" facs="tcp:0823800103:407"/> alſo ſeem better adapted for
tearing and chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than thoſe of the cat kind are. The eyes are little and
black. The ears ſhort, broad, and roundiſh; and have a fold at the lower
part, which makes them look as if they were double. Beneath the corners of the
mouth, on each jaw, is a ſpot of brown.</p>
            <p>This animal, though very diminutive to appearance, is,
nevertheleſs, a very formidable enemy to quadrupedes an hundred times its own
ſize. It is very common and well known in moſt parts of this country; but
ſeems held in very different eſtimation, in different parts of it. In
thoſe places where ſheep or lambs are bred, the weaſel is a moſt
noxious inmate, and every art is uſed to deſtroy it; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in
places where agriculture is chiefly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, the weaſel is conſidered as
a friend that thins the number of ſuch vermin as chiefly live upon corn:
however, in all places, it is one of the moſt untameable and untractable
animals in the world<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. xv. p.
37.</bibl>
               </note>. When kept in a cage, either for the purpoſes of
amuſement or inſpection, it will not touch any part of its victuals while
any body looks on. It keeps in a continual agitation, and ſeems frighted ſo
much at the ſight of mankind, that it will die, if not permitted to hide
itſelf from <pb n="350" facs="tcp:0823800103:408"/> their preſence. For this purpoſe, it
muſt be provided, in its cage, with a ſufficient quantity of wool or hay,
in which it may conceal itſelf, and where it may carry whatever it has got to
eat; which, however, it will not touch until it begins to putrefy. In this
ſtate it is ſeen to paſs three parts of the day in ſleeping; and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the night for its times of exerciſe and eating.</p>
            <p>In its wild ſtate, the night is likewiſe the time during which
it may be properly ſaid to live. At the approach of evening, it is ſeen
ſtealing from its hole, and creeping about the farmer's yard for its prey. If
it enters the place where poultry are kept, it never attacks the cocks or the
old hens, but immediately aims at the young ones. It does not eat its prey on
the place, but, after killing it by a ſingle bite near the head, and with a
wound ſo ſmall that the place can ſcarcely be perceived, it carries it
off to its young, or its retreat. It alſo breaks and ſucks the eggs, and
ſometimes kills the hen that attempts to defend them. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
active; and, in a confined place, ſcarce any animal can eſcape it. It will
run up the ſides of walls with ſuch facility, that no place is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from it; and its body is ſo ſmall, that there is ſcarce any hole but what
it can wind <pb n="351" facs="tcp:0823800103:409"/> through. During the ſummer, its
excurſions are more extenſive; but in winter, it chiefly confines itſelf
in barns and farm-yards, where it remains till ſpring, and where it brings
forth its young. All this ſeaſon it makes war upon the rats and mice, with
ſtill greater ſucceſs than the cat; for being more active and ſlender,
it purſues them into their holes, and, after a ſhort reſiſtance,
deſtroys them. It creeps alſo into pidgeon-holes, deſtroys the young,
catches ſparrows, and all kind of ſmall birds; and, if it has brought forth
its young, hunts with ſtill greater boldneſs and avidity. In ſummer, it
ventures farther from the houſe; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly goes into thoſe places
where the rat, its chiefeſt prey, goes before it. Accordingly, it is found in
the lower grounds, by the ſide of waters, near mills, and often is ſeen to
hide its young in the hollow of a tree.</p>
            <p>The female takes every precaution to make an eaſy bed for her
little ones: ſhe lines the bottom of her hole with graſs, hay, leaves, and
moſs, and generally brings forth from three to five at a time. All animals of
this, as well as thoſe of the dog kind, bring forth their young with cloſed
eyes; but they very ſoon acquire ſtrength ſufficient to follow the dam in
her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, and aſſiſt in her projects of petty 
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0823800103:410"/> rapine. The weaſel, like all others of its kind, does
not run on equably, but moves by bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and when it climbs a tree, by a
ſingle ſpring it gets a good way from the ground. It jumps in the ſame
manner upon its prey; and, having an extremely limber body, evades the attempts
of much ſtronger animals to ſeize it.</p>
            <p>This animal, like all of its kind, has a very ſtrong ſmell; and
that of the weaſel is peculiarly foetid. This ſcent is very
diſtinguiſhable in thoſe creatures, when they void their excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for
the glands which furniſh this foetid ſubſtance, which is of the
conſiſtence of ſuet, open directly into the orifice of the anus, and
taint the excrement with the ſtrong effluvia. The weaſel ſmells more
ſtrongly in ſummer than in winter; and more abominably when ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated or
purſued, than when at its eaſe. It always preys in ſilence, and never has
a cry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when ſtruck, and then it has a rough kind of ſqueaking, which
at once expreſſes reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and pain. Its appetite for animal food
never forſakes it; and it ſeems even to take a pleaſure in the vicinity
of putrefaction. Mr. Buffon tells us of one of them being found, with three
young ones, in the carcaſs of a wolf that was grown putrid, and that had been
hung up, by the hind legs, as a terror to others. <pb n="353" facs="tcp:0823800103:411"/> Into
this horrid retreat the weaſel thought proper to retire to bring forth her
young; ſhe had furniſhed the cavity with hay, graſs, and leaves; and the
young were juſt brought forth when they were diſcovered by a peaſant
paſſing that way.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>THE ERMINE, OR STOAT,</head>
               <p>NEXT to the weaſel in ſize, and perfectly alike in figure, is
the Ermine. The difference between this and the former animal is ſo very
ſmall, that many, and among the reſt Linnaeus, who gives but one
deſcription of both, have confounded the two kinds together. However their
differences are ſufficient to induce later naturaliſts to ſuppoſe the
two kinds diſtinct; and as their lights ſeems preferable, we chuſe to
follow their deſcriptions<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon, Britiſh
Zoology.</bibl>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>The ſtoat, or ermine, differs from the weaſel in ſize, being
uſually nine inches long; whereas the former is not much above ſix. The
tail of the ermine is always tipped with black, and is longer in proportion to
the body and more fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with hair. The edges of the ears and the ends of
the toes in this animal are of a yellowiſh white; and although it is of the
ſame colour with the weaſel, being of a lightiſh <pb n="354" facs="tcp:0823800103:412"/>
brown, and though both this animal, as well as the weaſel, in the moſt
northern parts of Europe, changes its colour in winter, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes white; yet
even then the weaſel may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the ermine by the
tip of the tail, which in the latter is always black.</p>
               <p>It is well known that the fur of the ermine is the moſt valuable
of any hitherto known; and it is in winter only that this little animal has it
of the proper colour and conſiſtence. In ſummer, the ermine, as was
ſaid before, is brown, and it may at that time more properly be called the
ſtoat. There are few ſo unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with quadrupedes as not to perceive
this change of colour in the hair, which in ſome degree obtains in them all.
The horſe, the cow, and the goat, all manifeſtly change colour in the
beginning of ſummer, the old long hair falling off, and a ſhorter coat of
hair appearing in its room, generally of a darker colour, and yet more
gloſſy. What obtains in our temperate climate, is ſeen to prevail ſtill
more ſtrongly in thoſe regions where the winters are long and ſevere, and
the ſummers ſhort and yet generally hot in an extreme degree. The animal
has ſtrength enough during that ſeaſon, to throw off a warm coat of fur,
which would but incommode it, and continues for two or <pb n="355" facs="tcp:0823800103:413"/>
three months in a ſtate ſomewhat reſembling the ordinary quadrupedes of
the milder cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates. At the approach of winter, however, the cold
encreaſing, the coat of hair ſeems to thicken in proportion; from being
coarſe and ſhort it lengthens and grows finer, while mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of
ſmaller hairs grow up between the longer, thicken the coat, and give it all
that warmth and ſoftneſs which are ſo much valued in the furs of the
northern animals.</p>
               <p>It is no eaſy matter to account for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable warmth of
the furs of northern qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupedes, or how they come to be furniſhed with
ſuch an abundant covering. It is eaſy enough, indeed, to ſay that Nature
fits them thus for the climate; and, like an indulgent mother, when ſhe
expoſes them to the rigour of an intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate winter, ſupplies them with a
covering againſt its inclemency. But this is only flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing; it is not
eaſy, I ſay, to tell how Nature comes to furniſh them in this manner. A
few particulars on this ſubject are all that we yet know. It is obſervable
among quadrupedes, as well as even among the human ſpecies itſelf, that a
thin ſparing diet is apt to produce hair; children that have been ill fed,
famiſhed dogs and horſes, are more hairy than others whoſe food has been
more plentiful. This may, therefore, be one <pb n="356" facs="tcp:0823800103:414"/> cauſe that
the animals of the north, in winter, are more hairy than thoſe of the milder
climates. At that ſeaſon, the whole country is covered with deep ſnow,
and the proviſions which theſe creatures are able to procure can be but
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious and ſcanty. Its becoming finer may alſo proceed from the
ſeverity of the cold, that contracts the pores of the ſkin, and the hair
conſequently takes the ſhape of the aperture through which it grows, as
wiers are made ſmaller by being drawn through a ſmaller ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. However
this may be, all the animals of the artic climates may be ſaid to have their
winter and ſummer garments, except very far to the north, as in Greenland,
where the cold is ſo continually intenſe and the food ſo ſcarce, that
neither the bears nor foxes change colour at all<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Krantz's Hiſtory of Greenland, vol. i. p.
72.</bibl>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>The ermine, as was ſaid, is remarkable among theſe for the
ſoftneſs, the cloſeneſs, and the warmth of its fur. It is brown in
ſummer, like the weaſel, and changes colour before the winter is begun,
becoming a beautiful cream colour, all except the tip of the tail, as was
ſaid before, which ſtill continues black. Mr. Daubenton had one of theſe
brought him with its white winter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur, which he put into a cage and kept, <pb n="357" facs="tcp:0823800103:415"/> in
order to obſerve the manner of moulting its hair. He received it in the
beginning of March, and in a very ſhort time it began to ſhed its coat, and
a mixture of brown was ſeen to prevail among the white, ſo that at the
ninth of the ſame month its head was nearly become of a reddiſh brown. Day
after day this colour appeared to extend at firſt along the neck and down the
back, in the manner of a ſtripe of about half an inch broad. The fore-part of
the legs then aſſumed the ſame colour; a part of the head, the thighs,
and the tail, were the laſt that changed; but at the end of the month there
was no white remaining, except on thoſe parts which are always white in this
ſpecies, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the throat and the belly. However, he had not the
pleaſure of ſeeing this animal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume its former whiteneſs, although
he kept it for above two years; which, without doubt, was owing to its
impriſoned ſtate; this colour being partly owing to its ſtinted food, and
partly to the rigour of the ſeaſon. During its ſtate of confinement, this
little animal always continued very wild and untractable; for ever in a ſtate
of violent agitation, except when aſleep, which it often continued for three
parts of the day. Except for its moſt diſagreeable ſcent, it was an
extremely pretty creature, its <pb n="358" facs="tcp:0823800103:416"/> eyes ſprightly, its
phyſiognomy pleaſant, and its motions ſo ſwift that the eye could
ſcarce at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them. It was fed with eggs and fleſh, but it always let them
putrify before it touched either. As ſome of this kind are known to be fond
of honey, it was tried to feed this animal with ſuch food for a while; after
having for three or four days deprived it of other food, it ate of this, and
died ſhortly after; a ſtrong proof of its being a diſtinct ſpecies from
the pole cat or the martin, who feed upon honey, but otherwiſe pretty much
reſemble the ermine in their figure and diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>In the north of Europe and Siberia, their ſkins make a valuable
article of commerce, and they are found there much more frequently than among
us. In Siberia they burrow in the fields, and are taken in traps baited with
fleſh. In Norway they are either ſhot with blunt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows or taken in traps
made of two flat ſtones, one being propped with a ſtick, to which is
faſtened a baited ſtring, which when the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals attempt to pull away, the
ſtone drops and cruſhes them to death. This animal is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found
white in Great Britain, and is then called a white weaſel. Its furs, however,
among us are of no value, having neither the thickneſs, the cloſeneſs,
nor the whiteneſs of thoſe which <pb n="359" facs="tcp:0823800103:417"/> come from Siberia.
The fur of the ermine, in every country, changes by time; for, as much of its
beautiful whiteneſs is given it by certain arts known to the furriers, ſo
its natural colour returns, and its former whiteneſs can never be reſtored
again.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>THE FERRET.</head>
               <p>THE animal next in ſize to the ermine, is the ferret; which is a
kind of domeſtic in Europe, though ſaid to be originally brought from
Africa into Spain, which being a country abounding in rabbits, required an
animal of this kind, more than any other: however this be, it is not to be
found at preſent among us except in its domeſtic ſtate; and it is chiefly
kept tame, for the purpoſes of the warren.</p>
               <p>The ferret is about one foot long, being nearly four inches longer
than the weaſel. It reſembles that animal in the ſlenderneſs of its
body, and the ſhortneſs of its legs; but its noſe is ſharper, and its
body more ſlender, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its length. The ferret is commonly of a
cream colour; but they are alſo found of all the colours of the weaſel
kind; white, black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, brown, and party-coloured. Thoſe that are of the
whitiſh kind, have their eyes red, as is almoſt general with all animals
entirely of that <pb n="360" facs="tcp:0823800103:418"/> colour. But its principal diſtinction
from the weaſel, is the length of the hair on its tail, which is much longer
in the ferret than the weaſel. Words will not well expreſs the other
diſtinctions; and what might take up a page in dull diſcrimination, a
ſingle glance of the eye, when the animals themſelves are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, can
diſcover.</p>
               <p>As this animal is a native of the torrid zone<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon.</bibl>
                  </note>, ſo it cannot bear the rigours of
our climate, without care and ſhelter; and it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally repays the trouble
of its keeping, by its great agility in the warren. It is naturally ſuch an
enemy of the rabbit kind, that if a dead rabbit be preſented to a young
ferret, although it has never ſeen one before, it inſtantly attacks and
bites it with an appearance of rapacity. If the rabbit be living, the ferret is
ſtill more eager, ſeizes it by the neck, winds itſelf round it, and
continues to ſuck its blood, till it be ſatiated.</p>
               <p>Their chief uſe in warrens, is to enter the holes, and drive the
rabbits into the nets that are prepared for them at the mouth. For this
purpoſe, the ferret is muzzled; otherwiſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of driving out the
rabbit, it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent itſelf with killing and ſucking its blood at 
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0823800103:419"/> the bottom of the hole; but, by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, being
rendered unable to ſeize its prey, the rabbit eſcapes from its claws, and
inſtantly makes to the mouth of the hole with ſuch precipitation, that it
is inextricably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the net placed there for its reception. It often
happens, however, that the ferret diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engages itſelf of its muzzle, and
then it is moſt commonly loſt, unleſs it be dug out; for, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all
its wants ſatisfied in the warren, it never thinks of returning to the owner,
but continues to lead a rapacious ſolitary life while the ſummer continues,
and dies with the cold of the winter. In order to bring the ferret from his
hole, the owners often burn ſtraw and other ſubſtances at the mouth; they
alſo beat above, to terrify it; but this does not always ſucceed; for as
there are often ſeveral iſſues to each hole, the ferret is affected
neither by the noiſe or the ſmoke, but continues ſecure at the bottom,
ſleeping the greateſt part of the time, and waking only to ſatisfy the
calls of hunger.</p>
               <p>The female of this ſpecies<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon.</bibl>
                  </note>, is ſenſibly leſs than the male,
whom ſhe ſeeks with great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and, it is ſaid, often dies, without
being admitted. They are uſually kept in boxes, <pb n="362" facs="tcp:0823800103:420"/> with
wool, of which they make themſelves a warm bed, which ſerves to defend them
from the rigour of the climate. They ſleep almoſt continually; and the
inſtant they awake, they ſeem eager for food. They are uſually fed with
bread and milk, and they breed twice a year. Some of them devour their young as
ſoon as brought forth; and then they become fit for the male again. Their
number is uſually from five to ſix at a litter; and this is ſaid to
conſiſt of more females than males. Upon the whole, this is an uſeful,
but a diſagreeable and offenſive animal; its ſcent is foetid, its nature
voracious, it is tame without any attachment, and ſuch is its appetite for
blood, that it has been known to attack and kill children in the cradle. It is
very eaſy to be irritated; and, although at all times its ſmell is very
offenſive, it then is much more ſo; and its bite is very difficult of
cure.</p>
               <p>To the ferret kind we may add an animal which Mr. Buffon calls the
Vanſire, the ſkin of which was ſent him ſtuffed, from Madagaſcar. It
was thirteen inches long, a good deal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the ferret in figure, but
differing in the number of its grinding teeth, which amounted to twelve;
whereas, in the ferret, there are but eight: it differed alſo in colour, 
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0823800103:421"/> being of a dark brown, and exactly the ſame on all
parts of its body. Of this animal, ſo nearly reſembling the ferret, we have
no other hiſtory but the mere deſcription of its figure; and in a
quadrupede whoſe kind is ſo ſtrongly marked, perhaps this is ſufficient
to ſatisfy curioſity.</p>

               <head>THE POLECAT.</head>
               <p>THE Polecat is larger than the weaſel, the ermine, or the
ferret, being one foot five inches long; whereas, the weaſel is but ſix
inches, the ermine nine, and the ferret eleven inches. It ſo much reſembles
the ferret in form, that ſome have been of opinion they were one and the
ſame animal; nevertheleſs, there are a ſufficient number of
diſtinctions between them: it is, in the firſt place, larger than the
ferret; it is not quite ſo ſlender, and has a blunter noſe; it differs
alſo internally, having but fourteen ribs, whereas the ferret has fifteen;
and wants one of the breaſt bones, which is found in the ferret: however,
warreners aſſert, that the pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat will mix with the ferret; and they are
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obliged to procure an intercourſe between theſe two animals,
to improve the breed of the latter, which, by long confinement, is ſometimes 
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0823800103:422"/> ſeen to abate of its rapacious diſpoſition. Mr.
Buffon denies that the ferret will admit the pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat; yet gives a variety,
under the name of both animals, which may very probably be a ſpurious race
between the two.</p>
               <p>However this be, the polecat ſeems by much the more pleaſing
animal of the two; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the long ſlender ſhape of all theſe
ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min tribes gives them a very diſagreeable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, yet the
ſoftneſs and colour of the hair in ſome of them, atones for the defect,
and renders them, if not pretty, at leaſt not frightful. The polecat, for the
moſt part, is of a deep chocolate colour; it is white about the mouth; the
ears are ſhort, rounded, and tipt with white; a little beyond the corners of
the mouth a ſtripe begins, which runs backward, partly white and partly
yellow: its hair, like that of all this claſs, is of two ſorts; the long
and the furry: but, in this animal, the two kinds are of different colours; the
longeſt is black, and the ſhorter yellowiſh<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>: the throat, feet and tail,

a ſingle polecat is often ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to deſtroy a whole warren; for,
with that inſatiable thirſt for blood which is natural to all the weaſel
kind, it kills much more than it can devour; and I have ſeen twenty rabbits
at a time taken out dead, which they had deſtroyed, and that by a wound which
was hardly perceptible. Their ſize, however, which is ſo much larger than
the weaſel, renders their retreats near houſes much more precarious;
although I have ſeen them burrow near a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, ſo as ſcarcely to be
extirpated. But, in general, they reſide in woods or thick brakes, making
holes under ground of about two yards deep, commonly ending among the roots of
large treets, for greater ſecurity. In winter they frequent houſes, and
make a common practice of robbing the hen-rooſt and the dairy.</p>
               <p>The polecat is particularly deſtructive among pidgeons<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon.</bibl>
                  </note>, when it gets into a
dove-houſe; without making ſo much noiſe as the weaſel, it does a great
deal more miſchief; it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches each with a ſingle wound in the head;
and, after killing a great number, and ſatiating itſelf with their blood,
it then begins to think <pb n="366" facs="tcp:0823800103:424"/> of carrying them home. This it
carefully performs, going and returning, and bringing them one by one to its
hole; but if it ſhould happen that the opening by which it got into the
dove-houſe be not large enough for the body of the pidgeon to get through,
this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous creature contents itſelf with carrying away the heads,
and makes a moſt delicious feaſt upon the brains.</p>
               <p>It is not leſs fond of honey, attacking the hives in winter, and
forcing the bees away. It does not remove far from houſes in winter, as its
prey is not ſo eaſily found in the woods dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſeaſon. The
female brings forth her young in ſummer, to the number of five or ſix at a
time; theſe ſhe ſoon trains to her own ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious habits, ſupplying the
want of milk, which no carnivorous quadrupede has in plenty, with the blood of
ſuch animals as ſhe happens to ſeize. The fur of this animal is
conſidered as ſoft and warm; yet it is in leſs eſtimation than ſome
of a much inferior kind, from its offenſive ſmell, which can never be

               <head>THE MARTIN.</head>
               <p>THE Martin is a larger animal than any of the former, being
generally eighteen inches long, and the tail ten more. It differs from the
polecat, in being about four or five inches longer; its tail alſo is longer
in proportion, and more buſhy at the end; its noſe is flatter; its cry is
ſharper and more piercing; its colours are more elegant; and, what ſtill
adds to their beauty, its ſcent, very unlike the former, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being
offenſive, is conſidered as a moſt pleaſing perfume. The martin, in
ſhort, is the moſt beautiful of all Britiſh beaſts of prey: its head is
ſmall, and elegantly formed; its eyes lively; its ears are broad, rounded and
open; its back, its ſides, and tail, are covered with a fine thick downy fur,
with longer hair inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed; the roots are aſh colour, the middle of 
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0823800103:429"/> a bright cheſnut, the points black; the head is brown,
with a ſlight caſt of red; the legs, and upper ſides of the feet, are of
a chocolate colour; the palms, or under ſides, are covered with a thick down,
like that of the body; the feet are broad, the claws white, large and ſharp,
well adapted for the purpoſes of climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but, as in others of the weaſel
kind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being ſheathed or unſheathed at pleaſure; the throat
and breaſt are white; the belly of the ſame colour with the back, but
rather paler; the hair on the tail is very long, eſpecially at the end, where
it appears much thicker than near the inſertion.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a variety of this animal, called the yellow
breaſted martin, which in no reſpect differs from the former, except that
this has a yellow breaſt, whereas the other has a white one: the colour of
the body alſo is darker; and, as it lives more among trees than the other
martin, its fur is more valuable, beautiful and gloſſy. The former of
theſe Mr. Buffon calls the Fouine; the latter, ſimply the Martin; and he
ſuppoſes them to be a diſtinct ſpecies: but as they differ only in
colour, it is unneceſſary to embarraſs hiſtory by a new diſtinction,
where there is only ſo minute a difference.</p>
               <p>Of all animals of the weaſel kind, the martin 
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0823800103:430"/> is the moſt pleaſing; all its motions ſhew great
grace, as well as agility; and there is ſcarce an animal in our woods that
will venture to oppoſe it. Quadrupedes five times as big are eaſily
vanquiſhed; the hare, the ſheep, and even the wild cat itſelf, though
much ſtronger, is not a match for the martin: and although carnivorous
animals are not fond of engaging each other, yet the wild cat and the martin
ſeldom meet without a combat. Geſner tells us of one of this kind that he
kept tame, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely playful and pretty; it went among the houſes
of the neighbourhood, and always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home when hungry: it was extremely
fond of a dog that had been bred up with it, and uſed to play with it as cats
are ſeen to play, lying on its back, and biting without anger or injury. That
which was kept tame by Mr. Buffon, was not quite ſo ſocial: it was
diveſted of its ferocity, but continued without attachment; and was ſtill
ſo wild as to be obliged to be held by a chain. Whenever a cat appeared, it
prepared for war; and if any of the poultry came within its reach, it flew upon
them with avidity. Though it was tied by the middle of the body, it frequently
eſcaped: at firſt it returned after ſome hours, but without ſeeming
pleaſed, and as if it only <pb n="370" facs="tcp:0823800103:431"/> came to be fed; the next
time it continued abroad longer; and, at laſt, went away without ever
returning. It was a female, and was, when it went off, a year and an half old;
and Mr. Buffon ſuppoſes it to have gone in queſt of the male. It ate
every thing that was given it, except ſallad or herbs; and it was remarkably
fond of honey. It was remarked that it drank often, and often ſlept for two
days together; and that, in like manner, it was often two or three days without
ſleeping. Before it went to ſleep, it drew itſelf up into a round, hid
its head, and covered it with its tail. When awake it was in continual
agitation, and was obliged to be tied up, not leſs to prevent its attacking
the poultry than to hinder it from breaking whatever it came near, by the
capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wildneſs of its motions.</p>
               <p>The yellow breaſted martin is much more common in France than in
England; and yet even there this variety is much ſcarcer than that with the
white breaſt. The latter keeps nearer houſes and villages to make its petty
ravages among the ſheep and the poultry; the other keeps in the woods, and
leads in every reſpect a ſavage life, building its neſt on the tops of
trees, and living upon ſuch animals as are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely wild like itſelf.
About night-fall it <pb n="371" facs="tcp:0823800103:432"/> uſually quits its ſolitude to
ſeek its prey, hunts after ſquirrels, rats, and rabbits; deſtroys great
numbers of birds and their young, takes the eggs from the neſt, and often
removes them to its own without breaking<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Brooke's
Natural Hiſtory.</bibl>
                  </note>. The inſtant the martin finds itſelf
purſued by dogs, for which purpoſe there is a peculiar breed, that ſeem
fit for this chace only, it immediately makes to its retreat, which is
generally in the hollow of ſome tree, towards the top, and which it is
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to come at without cutting it down. Their neſt is generally
the original tenement of the ſquirrel, which that litttle animal beſtowed
great pains in compleating; but the martin having killed and
diſpoſſeſſed the little architect, takes poſſeſſion of it for
its own uſe, enlarges its dimenſions, improves the ſoftneſs of the bed,
and in that retreat brings forth its young. Its litter is never above three or
four at a time; they are brought forth with the eyes cloſed, as in all the
reſt of this kind, and very ſoon come to a ſtate of perfection. The dam
compenſates for her own deficiency of milk, by bringing them eggs and live
birds, accuſtoming them from the beginning to a life of carnage and rapine.
When ſhe leads them from the neſt into the woods, the <pb n="372" facs="tcp:0823800103:433"/> birds at once diſtinguiſh their enemies and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them, as we
before obſerved of the fox, with all the marks of alarm and animoſity.
Wherever the martin conducts her young, a flock of ſmall birds are ſeen
threatening and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting her, alarming every thicket, and often directing
the hunter in his purſuit.</p>
               <p>The martin is ſtill more common in North-America than in any
part of Europe. Theſe animals are found in all the northern parts of the
world, from Siberia to China and Canada. In every country they are hunted for
their furs, which are very valuable, and chiefly ſo when taken in the
beginning of winter. The moſt eſteemed part of the martin's ſkin is that
part of it which is browner than the reſt, and ſtretches along the
back-bone. Above twelve thouſand of theſe ſkins are annually imported
into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land from Hudſon's Bay, and above thirty thouſand from Canada.</p>

               <head>THE SABLE.</head>
               <p>MOST of the claſſes of the weaſel kind would have continued
utterly unknown and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded were it not for their furs, which are finer,
more gloſſy and ſoft, than thoſe of any other quadrupede. Their
diſpoſitions are fierce and untameable; their ſcent generally
offenſive; <pb n="373" facs="tcp:0823800103:434"/> and their figure diſproportioned and
unpleaſing. The knowledge of one or two of them would, therefore, have
ſufficed curioſity; and the reſt would probably have been confounded
together, under one common name, as things uſeleſs and unintereſting, had
not their ſkins been coveted by the vain, and conſidered as capable of
adding to human magnificence or beauty.</p>
               <p>Of all theſe, however, the ſkin of the ſable is the moſt
coveted, and held in the higheſt eſteem. It is of a browniſh black, and
the darker it is it becomes the more valuable. A ſingle ſkin, though not
above four inches broad, is often valued at ten or fifteen pounds<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Regnard.</bibl>
                  </note>; the fur differing from others in
this, that it has no grain; ſo that, rub it which way you will, it is equally
ſmooth and unreſiſting. Nevertheleſs, though this little animal's robe
was ſo much co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted by the great, its hiſtory till of late was but very
little known; and we are obliged to Mr. Jonelin for the firſt accurate
deſcription of its form and nature<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon, vol. xxvii. p. 113.</bibl>
                  </note>. From him we learn
that the ſable reſembles the martin in form, and ſize, and the weaſel
in the number of its teeth; for it is to be obſerved, that whereas the martin
has thirty-eight teeth, the weaſel has but thirty-four; in this reſpect,
therefore, the ſable ſeems to <pb n="374" facs="tcp:0823800103:435"/> make the ſhade
between theſe two animals; being ſhaped like the one, and furniſhed with
teeth like the other. It is alſo furniſhed with very large whiſkers about
the mouth; its feet are broad and, as in the reſt of its kind, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with five claws on each foot. Theſe are its conſtant marks; but its fur,
for which it is ſo much valued, is not always the ſame. Some of this
ſpecies are of a dark brown over all the body, except the ears and the
throat, where the hair is rather yellow; others are more of a yellowiſh
tincture, their ears and throat being alſo much paler. Theſe in both are
the colours they have in winter, and which they are ſeen to change in the
beginning of the ſpring; the former becoming of a yellow brown, the latter of
a pale yellow. In other reſpects they reſemble their kind, in vivacity,
agility, and inquietude; in ſleeping by day and ſeeking their prey by
night; in living upon ſmaller animals, and in the diſagreeable odour that
chiefly characterizes their race.</p>
               <p>They generally inhabit along the banks of rivers, in ſhady
places, and in the thickeſt woods. They leap with great eaſe from tree to
tree, and are ſaid to be afraid of the ſun, which tarniſhes the luſtre
of their robes. They are chiefly hunted in winter for their ſkins, 
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0823800103:436"/> during which part of the year they are only in
ſeaſon. They are moſtly found in Siberia, and but very few in any other
country of the world; and this ſcarcity it is which enhances their value. The
hunting of the ſable chiefly falls to the lot of the condemned criminals, who
are ſent from Ruſſia into theſe wild and extenſive foreſts that,
for a great part of the year, are covered with ſnow; and in this inſtance,
as in many others, the luxuries and ornaments of the vain, are wrought out of
the dangers and the miſeries of the wretched. Theſe are obliged to
furniſh a certain number of ſkins every year, and are puniſhed if the
proper quantity be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
               <p>The ſable is alſo killed by the Ruſſian ſoldiers, who
are ſent into thoſe parts to that end. They are

yearly, like the former, and are obliged to ſhoot with only a ſingle ball,
to avoid ſpoiling the ſkin, or elſe with croſs-bows and blunt arrows.
As an encouragement to the hunters, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ſhare among
themſelves the ſurplus of thoſe ſkins which they thus procure; and
this, in the proceſs of ſix or ſeven years, amounts to a very
conſiderable ſum. A colonel, during his ſeven years ſtay, gains about
four thouſand crowns for his ſhare, and the common men ſix or ſeven
hundred each for theirs.</p>

               <p>THE Ichneumon, which ſome have inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly denominated the
Cat of Pharaoh, is one of the boldeſt and moſt uſeful animals of all the
weaſel kind. In the kingdom of Egypt, where it is chiefly bred, it is uſed
for the ſame purpoſes that cats are in Europe, and is even more
ſerviceable, as being more expert in catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mice than they. This animal is
uſually of the ſize of the martin, and greatly reſembles it in
appearance, except that the hair, which is of a griſly black, is much rougher
and leſs downy. The tail alſo is not ſo buſhy at the end; and each hair
in particular has three or four colours, which are ſeen in different
diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of its body. Under its rougher hairs, there is a ſofter fur
of a browniſh colour, the rough hair being about two inches long, but that of
the muzzle extremely ſhort, as likewiſe that on the legs and paws. However,
being long ſince brought into a domeſtic ſtate, there are many varieties
in this animal; ſome being much larger than the martin, others much leſs;
ſome being of a lighter mixture of colours, and ſome being ſtreaked in
the manner of a cat.</p>
               <p>The Ichneumon, with all the ſtrength of a cat, has more
inſtinct and agility; a more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal <pb n="377" facs="tcp:0823800103:438"/> appetite for
carnage, and a greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of powers to procure it<note n="*" place="bottom">The reſt of this deſcription is extracted from Mr. Buffon,
except where marked with commas.</note>. Rats, mice, birds, ſerpents, lizards
and inſects, are all equally purſued; it attacks every living thing which
it is able to overcome, and indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately preys on fleſh of all kinds.
Its courage is equal to the vehemence of its appetite. It fears neither the
force of the dog nor the inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious malice of the cat; neither the claws of
the vulture nor the poiſon of the viper. It makes war upon all kinds of
ſerpents with great avidity, ſeizes and kills them how venomous ſoever
they be; and we are told that when it begins to perceive the effects of their
rage, it has recourſe to a certain root, which the Indians call after its
name, and aſſert to be an antidote for the bite of the aſp or the
viper.</p>
               <p>But what this animal is particularly ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the
Egyptians for is, that it diſcovers and deſtroys the eggs of the crocodile.
It alſo kills the young ones that have not as yet been able to reach the
water; and, as fable uſually goes hand in hand with truth, it is ſaid that
the ichneumon ſometimes enters the mouth of the crocodile, when it is found
ſleeping on the ſhore, boldly attacks the enemy in the inſide, 
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0823800103:439"/> and at length, when it has effectually deſtroyed it,
it eats its way out again.</p>
               <p>The ichneumon when wild generally reſides along the banks of
rivers; and in times of inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation makes to the higher ground, often
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching inhabited places in queſt of prey. It goes forward ſilently
and cautiouſly, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its manner of moving according to its
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. Sometimes it carries the head high, ſhortens its body, and
raiſes itſelf upon its legs; ſometimes it lengthens itſelf and ſeems
to creep along the ground; it is often obſerved to ſit upon its hind legs,
like a dog when taught to beg; but more commonly it is ſeen to dart like an
arrow upon its prey, and ſeize it with inevit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able certainty. Its eyes are
ſprightly and full of fire, its phyſiognomy ſenſible, its body nimble,
its tail long, and its hair rough and various. Like all of its kind, it has
glands that open behind and furniſh an odorous ſubſtance. Its noſe is
too ſharp and its mouth too ſmall to permit its ſeizing things that are
large; however, it makes up by its courage and activity its want of arms; it
eaſily ſtrangles a cat though ſtronger and larger than itſelf; and
often fights with dogs, which, though never ſo bold, learn to dread the
ichneumon as a formidable enemy. It alſo takes the water like an otter, and,
as we are told, will continue under it much longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:0823800103:440"/>This animal grows faſt and dies ſoon. It
is found in great numbers in all the ſouthern parts of Aſia, from Egypt to
Java; and it is alſo found in Africa, particularly at the Cape of Good Hope.
It is domeſtic, as was ſaid, in Egypt; but in our colder climates it is not
eaſy to breed or maintain them, as they are not able to ſupport the rigour
of our winters. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they take every precaution that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct can
dictate to keep themſelves warm; they wrap themſelves up into a ball,
hiding the head between the legs, and in this manner continue to ſleep all
day long. 
<q rend="inline">"Seba had one ſent him from the iſland of
Ceylon, which he permitted to run for ſome months about the houſe. It was
heavy and ſlothful by day, and often could not be awaked even with a blow;
but it made up this indolence by its nocturnal activity, ſmelling about
without either being wholly tame or wholly miſchievous. It climbed up the
walls and the trees with very great eaſe, and appeared extremely fond of
ſpiders and worms, which it preferred probably from their reſemblance to
ſerpents, its moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural food. It was alſo particularly eager to
ſcratch up holes in the ground; and, this added to its wildneſs and
uncleanlineſs, obliged our naturaliſt to ſmother it in ſpirits, in
order <pb n="380" facs="tcp:0823800103:441"/> to preſerve, and add it to the reſt of his
col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This animal was one of thoſe formerly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped by the
Egyptians, who conſidered every thing that was ſerviceable to them as an
ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Deity, and worſhipped ſuch as the beſt
repreſentatives of God below. Indeed, if we conſider the number of eggs
which the cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile lays in the ſand at a time, which often amount to three
or four hundred, we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to admire this little animal's

               <head>THE STINKARDS.</head>
               <p>THIS is a name which our ſailors give to one or two animals of
the weaſel kind, which are chiefly found in America. All the weaſel kind,
as was already obſerved, have a very ſtrong ſmell; ſome of them indeed
approaching to a perfume, but the greateſt number moſt inſupportably
foetid. But the ſmell of our weaſels, and ermines, and polecats, is
fragrance itſelf when compared to that of the <hi>ſquaſh</hi> and the
<hi>ſkink,</hi> which have been called the Polecats of America. Theſe two
are found in different parts of America, both differing in colour and

                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:0823800103:443"/> fur, but both obviouſly of the
weaſel kind, as appears not only from their figure and odour, but alſo from
their diſpoſition. The <hi>ſquaſh</hi> is about the ſize of a
polecat, its hair of a deep brown, but principally differing from all of this
kind in having only four toes on the feet before, whereas all other weaſels
have five. The <hi>ſkink,</hi> which I take to be Cateſby's Virginia
polecat, reſembles a polecat in ſhape and ſize, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly differs
in the length of its hair and colour. The hair is above three inches and an
half long, and that at the end of the tail above four inches. The colour is
partly black and partly white, variouſly diſpoſed over the body, very
gloſſy, long, and beautiful. There ſeem to be two varieties more of this
animal, which Mr. Buffon calls the Conepate and the Zorille. He ſuppoſes
each to be a diſtinct ſpecies: but as they are both ſaid to reſemble
the polecat in form, and both to be cloathed with long fur of a black and white
colour, it ſeems needleſs to make a diſtinction. The conepate reſembles
the ſkink in all things except in ſize, being ſmaller, and in the
diſpoſition of its colours, which are more exact, having five white
ſtripes upon a black ground, running longitudinally from the head to the
tail. The Zorille reſembles the ſkink, but is rather ſmaller and more

diſtinct, and the colours of its tail being black at its inſertion and
white at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; whereas in the ſkink they are all of one grey
colour.</p>
               <p>But whatever differences there may be in the figure or colour of
theſe little animals, they all agree in one common affection, that of being
intolerably foetid and loathſome. I have already obſerved that all the
weaſel kind have glands furniſhing an odorous matter, near the anus, the
conduits of which generally have their aperture juſt at its opening. That
ſubſtance which is ſtored up in theſe receptacles, is in ſome of this
kind, ſuch as in the martin, already mentioned, and alſo in the genet and
the civet, to be deſcribed hereafter, a moſt grateful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume; but in the
weaſel, the ermine, the ferret, and the polecat, it is extremely foetid and
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive. Theſe glands in the animals now under conſideration are much
larger, and furniſh a matter ſublimed to a degree of putreſcence that is
truly amazing. As to the perfumes of muſk and civet, we know that a ſingle
grain will dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe itſelf over a whole houſe, and continue for months to
ſpread an agreeable odour, without diminution. However, the perfume of the
muſk or the civet is nothing, either for ſtrength or <pb n="383" facs="tcp:0823800103:447"/>
duration, to the inſupportable odour of theſe. It is uſually voided with
their excrement; and if but a ſingle drop happens to touch any part of a
man's garment, it is more than probable that he can never wear any part of it
more.</p>
               <p>In deſcribing the effects produced by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement of theſe
animals, we often hear of its raiſing this diabolical ſmell by its urine.
How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, of this I am apt to doubt; and it ſhould ſeem to me, that, as all
the weaſel kind have their excrements ſo extremely foetid from the cauſe
above-mentioned, we may conſider theſe alſo as being foetid from the
ſame cauſes. Beſides, they are not furniſhed with glands to give their
urine ſuch a ſmell; and the analogy between them and the weaſel kind
being ſo ſtrong in other reſpects, we may ſuppoſe they reſemble
each other in this. It has alſo been ſaid that they take this method of
ejecting their excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to defend themſelves againſt their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers;
but it is much more probable that this ejection is the convulſive effect of
terror, and that it ſerves as their defence without their own concurrence.
Certain it is that they never ſmell thus horridly except when enraged or
affrighted, for they are often kept tame about the houſes of the planters of
America without being very offenſive.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:0823800103:448"/>The habitudes of all theſe animals are the
ſame, living like all the reſt of the weaſel kind, as they prey upon
ſmaller animals and birds eggs. The ſquaſh, for inſtance, burrows like
the pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat in the clefts of rocks, where it brings forth its young. It often
ſteals into farm-yards, and kills the poultry, eating only their brains. Nor
is it ſafe to purſue or offend it, for then it calls up all its ſcents,
which are its moſt powerful protection. At that time neither men nor dogs
will offer to approach it; the ſcent is ſo ſtrong that it reaches for
half a mile round, and more near at hand is almoſt ſtifling. If the dogs
continue to purſue, it does all in its power to eſcape, by getting up a
tree, or by ſome ſuch means; but if driven to an extremity, it then lets
fly upon the hunters; and if it ſhould happen that a drop of this foetid
diſcharge falls in the eye, the perſon runs the riſque of being blinded
for ever<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>The dogs themſelves inſtantly abate of their ardour when they
find this extraordinary battery played off againſt them; they inſtantly
turn tail, and leave the animal undiſputed maſter of the field; and no

<q rend="inline">"In the year 1749," ſays Kalm, "one of theſe
animals came near the farm where I <pb n="385" facs="tcp:0823800103:449"/> lived. It was in
winter time, and during the night; and the dogs that were upon the watch,
purſued it for ſome time, until it diſcharged againſt them. Although I
was in my bed a good way off, I thought I ſhould have been ſuffocated; and
the cows and oxen themſelves, by their lowings, ſhewed how much they were
affected by the ſtench. About the end of the ſame year, another of theſe
animals crept into our cellar, but did not exhale the ſmalleſt ſcent,
becauſe it was not diſturbed. A fooliſh woman, however, who perceived it
at night, by the ſhining of its eyes, killed it, and at that moment its
ſtench began to ſpread. The whole cellar was filled with it to ſuch a
degree, that the woman kept her bed for ſeveral days after; and all the
bread, meat, and other proviſions, that were kept there, were ſo infected,
that they were obliged to be thrown out of doors."</q> Nevertheleſs, many of
the planters, and the native Americans, keep this animal tame about their
houſes; and ſeldom perceive any diſagreeable ſcents, except it is
injured or frighted. They are alſo known to eat its fleſh, which ſome
aſſert to be tolerable food; however, they take care to deprive it of
thoſe glands which are ſo horridly offenſive.</p>

               <head>THE GENETT.</head>
               <p>FROM the ſquaſh, which is the moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive animal in
nature, we come to the Genett, which is one of the moſt beautiful and
pleaſing. Inſtead of the horrid ſtench with which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer affects us,
this has a moſt grateful odour; more faint than civet, but to ſome, for
that reaſon, more agreeable. This animal is rather leſs than the martin;
though there are genetts of different ſizes; and I have ſeen one rather
larger. It alſo differs ſomewhat in the form of its body. It is not eaſy,
in words, to give an idea of the diſtinction. It reſembles all thoſe of
the weaſel kind, in its length, compared to its heighth; it reſembles them
in having a ſoft beautiful fur, in having its feet armed with claws that
cannot be ſheathed, and in its appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite for petty carnage. But then it
differs from them in having the noſe much ſmaller and longer, rather
reſembling that of a fox than a weaſel. The tail alſo, inſtead of being
buſhy, tapers to a point, and is much longer; its ears are larger, and its
paws ſmaller. As to its colours, and figure in general, the genett is
ſpotted with black, upon a ground mixed with red and grey. It has two ſorts
of hair, the one ſhorter and <pb n="387" facs="tcp:0823800103:451"/> ſofter, the other
longer and ſtronger, but not above half an inch long on any part of its body,
except the tail. Its ſpots are diſtinct and ſeparate upon the ſides,
but unite towards the back, and form black ſtripes, which run longitudinally
from the neck backwards. It has alſo along the back a kind of mane or
longiſh hair, which forms a black ſtreak from the head to the tail, which
laſt is marked with rings, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately black and white, its whole
length.</p>
               <p>The genett, like all the reſt of the weaſel kinds, has glands,
that ſeparate a kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume, reſembling civet, but which ſoon flies
off. Theſe glands open differently from thoſe of other animals of this
kind; for, as the latter have their apertures juſt at the opening of the
anus, theſe have their aperture immediately under it; ſo that the male
ſeems, for this reaſon, to the ſuperficial obſerver, to be of two
ſexes.</p>
               <p>It reſembles the martin very much in its habits and
diſpoſition<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  </note>; except, that it ſeems tamed much more eaſily. Bellonius
aſſures us, that he has ſeen them in the houſes at Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople as
tame as cats; and that they were permitted to run every where about, without
doing the leaſt miſchief. For this reaſon they <pb n="388" facs="tcp:0823800103:452"/>
have been called the Cats of Conſtantinople; although they have little elſe
in common with that animal, except their ſkill in ſpying out and
deſtroying vermin. Naturaliſts pretend that it inhabits only the moiſter
grounds, and chiefly reſides along the banks of rivers, having never been
found in mountains, nor dry places. The ſpecies is not much diffuſed; it is
not to be found in any part of Europe, except Spain and Turky; it requires a
warm climate to ſubſiſt and multiply in; and yet it is not to be found in
the warmer regions either of India or Africa. From ſuch as have ſeen its
uſes at Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, I learn, that it is one of the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
cleanly, and induſtrious animals in the world; that it keeps whatever houſe
it is in, perfectly free from mice and rats, which cannot endure its ſmell.
Add to this, its nature is mild and gentle, its colours various and gloſſy,
its fur valuable; and, upon the whole, it ſeems to be one of thoſe animals
that, with proper care, might be propagated amongſt us, and might become one
of the moſt ſerviceable of our domeſtics.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>THE CIVET.</head>
               <p>PROCEEDING from the ſmaller to the greater of this kind, we
come, in the laſt place, <pb n="389" facs="tcp:0823800103:453"/> to the Civet, which is much
larger than any of the former; for as the martin is not above ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen inches
long, the civet is found to be above thirty. Mr. Buffon diſtinguiſhes this
ſpecies into two kinds; one of which he calls the Civet, and the other the
Zibet. The latter principally differs from the former in having the body longer
and more ſlender, the noſe ſmaller, the ears longer and broader; no mane
or long hair running down the back in the latter; and the tail is longer and
better marked with rings of different colours, from one end to the other.
Theſe are the differences which have induced this great naturaliſt to
ſuppoſe them animals of diſtinct ſpecies; and to allot each a
ſeparate deſcription. How far future experience may confirm this
conjecture, time muſt diſcover; but certain it is, that if ſuch ſmall
varieties make a ſeparate claſs, there may be many other animals equally
entitled to peculiar diſtinction that now are claſſed together. We
ſhall, therefore, content ourſelves, at preſent, with conſidering, as
former naturaliſts have done, theſe two merely as varieties of the ſame
animal, and only altered in figure, by climate, food, or education.</p>
               <p>The civet reſembles animals of the weaſel kind in the long
ſlenderneſs of its body, the <pb n="390" facs="tcp:0823800103:454"/> ſhortneſs of its
legs, the odorous matter that exudes from the glands behind, the ſoftneſs
of its fur, the number of its claws, and their inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of being ſheathed.
It differs from them in being much larger than any hitherto deſcribed; in
having the noſe lengthened, ſo as to reſemble that of the fox; the tail
long, and tapering to a point; and its ears ſtrait, like thoſe of a cat.
The colour of the civet varies: it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly aſh, ſpotted with black;
though it is whiter in the female, tending to yellow; and the ſpots are much
larger, like thoſe of a panther. The colour on the belly, and under the
throat, is black; whereas the other parts of the body are black or ſtreaked
with grey. This animal varies in its colour, being ſometimes ſtreaked, as
in our kind of cats called Tabbies. It has whiſkers, like the reſt of its
kind; and its eye is black and beautiful.</p>
               <p>The opening of the pouch or bag, which is the receptacle of the
civet, differs from that of the reſt of the weaſel kind, not opening into
but under the anus. Beſide this opening, which is large, there is ſtill
another lower down; but for what purpoſes deſigned, is not known. The pouch
itſelf is about two inches and an half broad, and two long; its opening makes
a chink, from the top downwards, that is about <pb n="391" facs="tcp:0823800103:455"/> two
inches and an half long; and it is covered on the edges, and within, with
ſhort hair: when the two ſides are drawn aſunder, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cavity may
be ſeen, large enough to hold a ſmall pullet's egg; all round this are
ſmall glands, opening and furniſhing that ſtrong perfume which is ſo
well known, and is found, in this pouch, of the colour and conſiſtence of
pomatum. Thoſe who make it their buſineſs to breed theſe animals for
their perfume, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally take it from them twice or thrice a week, and
ſometimes oftener. The animal is kept in a long ſort of a box, in which it
cannot turn round. The perſon, therefore, opens this box behind, drags the
animal backwards by the tail, keeps it in this poſition by a bar before, and,
with a wooden ſpoon, takes the civet from the pouch, as carefully as he can;
then lets the tail go, and ſhuts the box again. The perfume, thus procured,
is put into a veſſel, which he takes care to keep ſhut; and when a
ſufficient quantity is procured, it is ſold to very great advantage.</p>
               <p>The civet<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon, vol.
xix.</bibl>
                  </note>, although a native of the warmeſt climates, is yet found
to live in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and even cold countries, provided it be defended
carefully from the injuries of the air. <pb n="392" facs="tcp:0823800103:456"/> Wherefore, it is
not only bred among the Turks, the Indians, and Africans, but great numbers of
theſe animals are alſo bred in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where this ſcraping people make
no ſmall gain of its perfume. The perfume of Amſterdam is reckoned the
pureſt of any; the people of other countries adulterating it with gums, and
other matters, which diminiſh its value, but encreaſe its weight. The
quantity which a ſingle animal affords generally depends upon its health and
nouriſhment. It gives more in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as it is more delicately and
abundantly fed. Raw fleſh, haſhed ſmall, eggs, rice, birds, young fowls,
and particularly fiſh, are the kinds of food the civet moſt delights in.
Theſe are to be changed and altered, to ſuit and entice its appetite, and
continue its health. It gets but very little water; and although it drinks but
rarely, yet it makes urine very frequently; and, upon ſuch occaſions, we
cannot, as in other animals, diſtinguiſh the male from the female.</p>
               <p>The perfume of the civet is ſo ſtrong that it communicates
itſelf to all parts of the animal's body; the fur is impregnated thereby, and
the ſkin penetrated to ſuch a degree that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to preſerve the
odour for a long time after it is ſtript off. If a perſon be ſhut up with
one <pb n="393" facs="tcp:0823800103:457"/> of them in a cloſe room, he cannot ſupport the
perfume, which is ſo copiouſly diffuſed. When the animal is irritated, as
in all the weaſel kind, its ſcent is much more violent than ordinary; and
if it be tormented ſo as to make it ſweat, this alſo is a ſtrong
perfume, and ſerves to adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate or encreaſe what is otherwiſe obtained
from it In general, it is ſold in Holland, for about fifty ſhillings an
ounce; though, like all other commodities, its value alters in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to
the demand. Civet muſt be choſen new, of a good conſiſtence, a
whitiſh colour, and a ſtrong, diſagreeable ſmell. There is ſtill a
very conſiderable traffic carried on from Buſſerah, Calicut, and other
places in India, where the animal that produces it is bred; from the Levant
alſo, from Guinea, and eſpecially from Braſil, in South America,
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Mr. Buffon is of opinion that the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is a native only of the Old
Continent, and not to be found wild in the New. The beſt civet, however, is
furniſhed, as was obſerved, by the Dutch, though not in ſuch quantities
at preſent as ſome years paſt, when this perfume was more in faſhion.
Civet is a much more grateful perfume than muſk, to which it has ſome
reſemblance; and was ſome years ago uſed for the ſame purpoſes in
medicine. But, <pb n="394" facs="tcp:0823800103:458"/> at preſent, it is quite diſcontinued
in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; and perſons of taſte or elegance ſeem to proſcribe
it even from the toilet. Perfumes, like dreſs, have their viciſſitudes;
muſk was in peculiar repute, until diſplaced by civet; both gave ground,
upon diſcovering the manner of preparing ambergreaſe; and even this is now
difuſed for the leſs powerful vegetable kinds of fragrance, ſpirit of
lavender, or otter of roſes.</p>
               <p>As to the reſt, the civet is ſaid to be a wild fierce animal;
and, although ſometimes tamed, is never thoroughly familiar. Its teeth are
ſtrong and cutting, although its claws be feeble and inflexible. It is light
and active, and lives by prey, as the reſt of its kind, purſuing birds, and
other ſmall animals that it is able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. They are ſometimes ſeen
ſtealing into the yards and outhouſes, to ſeize upon the poultry: their
eyes ſhine in the night, and it is very probable that they ſee better in
the dark than by day. When they fail of animal food, they are found to
ſubſiſt upon roots and fruits, and very ſeldom drink; for which
reaſon they are never found near great waters. They breed very faſt in
their native climates, where the heat ſeems to condu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <head>THE GLUTTON.</head>
               <p>I WILL add but one animal more to this numerous claſs of the
weaſel kind; namely, the Glutton; which, for ſeveral reaſons, ſeems to
belong to this tribe, and this only. We have hitherto had no preciſe
deſcription of this quadrupede; ſome reſembling it to a badger, ſome to
a fox, and ſome to an hyaena. Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus places it among the weaſels, from
the ſimilitude of its teeth; it ſhould ſeem to me to reſemble this
animal ſtill more, from the great length of its body, and the ſhortneſs
of its legs, from the ſoftneſs of its fur, its diſagreeable ſcent, and
its inſatiable appetite for animal food. Mr. Klein, who ſaw one of them
which was brought alive from Siberia, aſſures us, that it was about three
feet long<note n="*" place="bottom">He ſays it was an ell, eight inches long; I
have, therefore, given its length as ſuppoſing it to be a Flemiſh ell,
which is twenty-ſeven inches.</note>, and about a foot and an half high. If
we compare theſe dimenſions with thoſe of other animals, we ſhall find,
that they approach more nearly to the claſs we are at <pb n="396" facs="tcp:0823800103:463"/>
preſent deſcribing than any other; and that the glutton may very juſtly
be conceived under the form of a great overgrown weaſel. Its noſe, its
ears, its teeth, and its long buſhy tail, are entirely ſimilar; and as to
what is ſaid of its being rather corpulent than ſlender, it is moſt
probable that thoſe who deſcribed it thus ſaw it after eating, at which
time its belly we are aſſured is moſt monſtrouſly diſtended:
however, ſuſpending all certainty upon this ſubject, I will take leave
rather to follow Linnaeus than Buffon in deſcribing this animal; and leave
future experience to judge between them.</p>
               <p>The glutton, which is ſo called from its vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racious appetite, is
an animal found as well in the north of Europe and Siberia, as in the north
parts of America, where it has the name of the Carcajou. Amidſt the variety
of deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have been given of it, no very juſt idea can be
formed of its figure; and, indeed, ſome naturaliſts, among whom was Ray,
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely doubted of its exiſtence. From the beſt accounts, however, we
have of it, the body is thick and long, the legs ſhort; it is black along the
back, and of a reddiſh brown on the ſides; its fur is held in the higheſt
eſtimation, for its ſoftneſs and beautiful gloſs; the tail is buſhy,
like that of the weaſel, but rather ſhorter; and <pb n="397" facs="tcp:0823800103:464"/> its
legs and claws better fitted for climbing trees, than for running along the
ground. Thus far it entirely reſembles the weaſel; and its manner of taking
its prey is alſo by ſurprize, and not by purſuit.</p>
               <p>Scarce any of the animals with ſhort legs and long bodies,
purſue their prey; but, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own incapacity to overtake it by
ſwiftneſs, either creep upon it in its retreats, or wait in ambuſh, and
ſeize it with a bound. The glutton, from the make of its legs, and the length
of its body, muſt be particularly ſlow; and, conſequently, its only
reſource is in taking its prey by ſurprize. All the reſt of the weaſel
kind, from the ſmallneſs of their ſize, are better fitted for a life of
inſidious ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine than this; they can purſue their prey into its retreats,
they can lurk unſeen among the branches of trees, and hide themſelves with
eaſe under the leaves: but the glutton is too large to follow ſmall prey
into their retreats; nor would ſuch, even if obtained, be ſufficient to
ſuſtain it. For theſe reaſons, therefore, this animal ſeems naturally
compelled to the life for which it has long been remarkable. Its only
reſource is to climb a tree, which it does with great eaſe, and there it
waits with patience until ſome large animal paſſes underneath, upon 
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0823800103:465"/> which it darts down with unerring certainty, and
deſtroys it.</p>
               <p>It is chiefly in North America that this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racious creature is
ſeen lurking among the thick branches of trees, in order to ſurprize the
deer, with which the extenſive foreſts of that part of the world abound.
Endued with a degree of patience equal to its rapacity, the glutton ſingles
out ſuch trees as it obſerves marked by the teeth or the antlers of the
deer; and is known to remain there watching for ſeveral days together. If it
has fixed upon a wrong tree, and finds that the deer have either left that part
of the country, or cautiouſly ſhun the place, it reluctantly deſcends,
purſues the beaver to its retreat, or even ventures into the water in
purſuit of fiſhes. But if it happens that, by long attention, and keeping
cloſe, at laſt the elk or the rein-deer happens to paſs that way, it at
once darts down upon them, ſticks its claws between their ſhoulders, and
remains there unalterably firm. It is in vain that the large frighted animal
encreaſes its ſpeed, or threatens with its branching horns; the glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
having taken poſſeſſion of its poſt, nothing can drive it off; its
enormous prey drives ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly along amongſt the thickeſt woods, rubs
itſelf againſt the largeſt trees and tears down <pb n="399" facs="tcp:0823800103:466"/>
the branches with its expanded horns; but ſtill its inſatiable foe ſticks
behind, eating its neck, and digging its paſſage to the great
blood-veſſels that lie in that part. Travellers who wander through thoſe
deſarts, often ſee pieces of the glutton's ſkin ſticking to the trees,
againſt which it was rubbed by the deer. But the animal's voracity is greater
than its feelings, and it never ſeizes without bringing down its prey. When,
therefore, the deer, wounded, and feeble with the loſs of blood, falls, the
glutton is ſeen to make up for its former ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, by its preſent
voracity. As it is not poſſeſſed of a feaſt of this kind every day,
it reſolves to lay in a ſtore to ſerve it for a good while to come. It is
indeed amazing how much one of theſe animals can eat at a time! That which
was ſeen by Mr. Klein, although without exerciſe or air, although taken
from its native climate, and enjoying but an indifferent ſtate of health, was
yet ſeen to eat thirteen pounds of fleſh every day, and yet remained
unſatisfied. We may, therefore, eaſily conceive how much more it muſt
devour at once, after a long faſt, of a food of its own procuring, and in the
climate moſt natural to its conſtitution. We are told, accordingly, that
from being a lank thin animal, which it naturally is, it then gorges 
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0823800103:467"/> in ſuch quantities, that its belly is diſtended, and
its whole figure ſeems to alter. Thus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raciouſly it continues eating
till, incapable of any other animal function, it lies totally torpid by the
animal it has killed; and in this ſituation continues for two or three days.
In this loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and helpleſs ſtate it finds its chief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from
its horrid ſmell, which few ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals care to come near<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Linnaei Syſt. p. 67.</bibl>
                  </note>; ſo that it continues
eating and ſleeping till its prey be devoured, bones and all; and then it
mounts a tree, in queſt of another adventure.</p>
               <p>The glutton, like many others of the weaſel kind, ſeems to
prefer the moſt putrid fleſh to that newly killed; and ſuch is the
voraciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this hateful creature, that, if its ſwiftneſs and
ſtrength were equal to its rapacity, it would ſoon thin the foreſt of
every other living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But, fortunately, it is ſo ſlow that there is
ſcarce a quadrupede that cannot eſcape it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the beaver. This,
therefore, it very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently purſues upon land; but the beaver ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
makes good its retreat by taking to the water, where the glutton has no chance
to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. This purſuit only happens in ſummer; for in the winter all
that remains is to attack the beaver's houſe, as at that time it never
ſtirs <pb n="401" facs="tcp:0823800103:468"/> from home. This attack, however, ſeldom
ſucceeds; for the beaver has a covert way bored under the ice, and the
glutton has only the trouble and diſappointment of ſacking an empty
town.</p>
               <p>A life of neceſſity generally produces a good fertile
invention. The glutton, continually preſſed by the call of appetite, and
having neither ſwiftneſs nor activity to ſatisfy it, is obliged to make
up by ſtratagem the defects of nature. It is often ſeen to examine the
traps and the ſnares laid for other animals, in order to anticipate the
fowlers. It is ſaid to practiſe a thouſand arts to procure its prey, to
ſteal upon the retreats of the rein-deer, the fleſh of which animal it
loves in preference to all others; to lie in wait for ſuch animals as have
been maimed by the hunters; to purſue the iſatis while it is hunting for
itſelf; and, when that animal has run down its prey, to come in and ſeize
upon the whole, and ſometimes to devour even its poor provider; when theſe
purſuits fail, even to dig up the graves, and fall upon the bodies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
there, devouring them bones and all. For theſe reaſons, the natives of the
countries where the glutton inhabits, hold it in utter deteſtation, and
uſually term it the vulture of quadrupedes. And yet, it is extraordinary
enough, that, being <pb n="402" facs="tcp:0823800103:469"/> ſo very obnoxious to man, it does
not ſeem to fear him<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon.</bibl>
                  </note>. We
are told by Gemelin of one of theſe coming up boldly and calmly where there
were ſeveral perſons at work, without teſtifying the ſmalleſt
apprehenſion, or attempting to run until it had received ſeveral blows,
that at laſt totally diſabled it. In all probability it came among them
ſeeking its prey; and, having been uſed to attack animals of inferior
ſtrength, it had no idea of a force ſuperior to its own. The glutton, like
all the reſt of its kind, is a ſolitary animal; and is never ſeen in
company except with its female, with which it couples in the midſt of winter.
The latter goes with young about four months, and brings forth two or three at
a time<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Linnaei Syſtem. p.
67.</bibl>
                  </note>. They burrow in holes as the weaſel; and the male and
female are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally found together, both equally reſolute in defence of
their young. Upon this occaſion the boldeſt dogs are afraid to approach
them; they fight obſtinately and bite moſt cruelly. However, as they are
unable to eſcape by flight, the hunters come in to the aſſiſtance of
the dogs, and eaſily overpower them. Their fleſh, it may readily be
ſuppoſed, is not fit to be eaten; but the ſkins amply recompence the
hunters for their toil and danger. The fur has <pb n="403" facs="tcp:0823800103:470"/> the
moſt beautiful luſtre that can be imagined, and is preferred before all
others, except that of the Siberian fox, or the ſable. Among other
peculiarities of this animal, Linnaeus informs us, that it is very difficult to
be ſkinned; but from what cauſe, whether its abominable ſtench, or the
ſkin's tenacity to the fleſh, he has not thought fit to inform us.</p>
