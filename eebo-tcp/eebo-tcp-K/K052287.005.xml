            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>THUS my Lord, in the recent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of ſuch a Son, forgot all his Loſſes, and caſt the whole Weight of his late Calamities behind him. His Eye could not be tired with ſeeing him, neither his Ear with hearing the Sweetneſs of his Voice; and he continued to hold, to gaze at him, to careſs him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of aught elſe, unmindful even of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0237300105:3"/>his Friend <hi>Meekly,</hi> who ſat enraptured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide him.</p>
            <p>Will you leave me again, my Child? cried out the Earl; do you intend to go from me again, my <hi>Harry?</hi> you muſt not, you ſhall not leave me, not for an Hour, no not for a Minute; a ſecond Loſs of my Son would quickly bring my grey Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave. Never, never, my Lord, will I leave you, tenderly cried <hi>Harry;</hi> never, for a Moment, will I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake you again, my Father. I come pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to watch over, to comfort, to tend you, while I have Life, with all poſſible Tenderneſs, Affection and Duty.</p>
            <p>But where, haſtily aſked the Earl, where is the Murderer who ſtabbed my Peace? where is that old Thief, that Robber, who rent my Child from me? Ah! my Lord, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> he is very far from meriting ſuch opprobrious Epithets; He is a Summary of all that is excellent, all that is amiable in Nature. He reſpects and loves you too, above the World, and all that is in it deſerving of Love. O, had you lately ſeen his Grief for your Loſſes, the Floods of Tears he ſhed,—for—for—for!—Here <hi>Harry</hi> could no more, but, on the Recollection of his Mother and Brother, burſt into Tears.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0237300105:4"/>
But tell me, my Dear, continued the Earl, tell me who and what he is, whom you commend ſo highly?</p>
            <p>Even the Son of your own Mother, my Lord; my much loved, my revered, my moſt honoured Uncle.</p>
            <p>Impoſſible, my Child. That old deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable Man my Brother. No no, my <hi>Harry,</hi> he muſt have deceived you. My Brother was All that was amiable upon Earth; <hi>the Faireſt among ten Thouſand,</hi> the ſtraiteſt Cedar in the Foreſt.</p>
            <p>And ſuch he is at this Day, my Lord. But, alas, alas, he has been broken by the Batteries of many Afflictions; a Man wholly made up of Sorrows, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with killing Griefs. You wanted me not, when he took me, my Father. You had other and richer Treaſures, Comforts that were infinitely more worthy your Regard. But, little and deſpicable as I was, He had nothing but me. I became his only Comfort, the only Treaſure in which he delighted. Yet, as ſoon as he hear'd that you wanted Conſolation, he choſe rather to be without it himſelf; and ſo he reſtores me to you, if I may be any little Matter of Comfort to you, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0237300105:5"/>
And where is this dear Uncle, this precious Brother, my <hi>Harry?</hi> Is he come with you, ſhall I be ſo bleſſed to take him in with my Eye, to take him in with my Arms, to petition, to obtain his Pardon, to preſs him to my Boſom, to my Heart, to my Soul, where is he, where is this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Brother, my <hi>Harry?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is not come with me, my Lord, he feared, as he ſaid, that you would not forgive him the carrying off of your <hi>Gany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede,</hi> but he is deſirous of attending you, on the firſt Intimation.</p>
            <p>Then you muſt write to him, for that Purpoſe, to Morrow, my Son, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch your Invitation by ſome of our ſwifteſt Horſes. The Influence of his Darling will, unqueſtionably, be greater than that of an offending and unnatural Brother. Is this Letter from him, <hi>Harry?</hi> — it is, my Lord. — Then, I will not peruſe it, till I get by myſelf. It probably contains Reproaches but too well merited; or, poſſibly, Matters of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, too tender for me to bear. — But, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> my deareſt <hi>Meekly,</hi> ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pardons! — <hi>Harry,</hi> take to your Arms the Man, in the World, next to your Uncle, moſt deſerving of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, moſt deſerving of your Heart!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0237300105:6"/>
Here, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> kiſſed and embraced our Hero, with all the Tenderneſs of a Father and the Ardour of an old Friend.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> cried <hi>Harry,</hi> looking ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and fondly at him, do I not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſomething of that Face, Mr. <hi>Meekly?</hi> Are you not the Gentleman, for whom I, long ſince, conceived ſuch an Attachment, to whom my Heart cleaved, as I may ſay, from my Infancy?</p>
            <p>I am, my heavenly Creature, anſwered <hi>Meekly,</hi> I am the Man indeed whoſe Soul was knit to yours, like the Soul of <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> the firſt Moment I beheld you; and who ſaw in you, then, all thoſe noble, generous, and divinely humane Propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that I ſee arrived to their Maturity at this happy Day!</p>
            <p>While Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> was thus rejoicing, <hi>Harry</hi> happened to turn his Head aſide, and ſpying the lively Portraits of my Lady and Lord <hi>Richard,</hi> he ſtarted, he roſe, and, gazing on them a Minute; he went ſoftly to the Window, and, taking out his Handkerchief, kept his Back to the Company, while he vented his Emotions in a ſilent Paſſion of Tears. His Father and Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> perceived what he was about, but they did not diſturb him. He
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0237300105:7"/>brought freſh to their Remembrance all the Paſſages of late Affliction, and they ſilently joined a Flow of Grief to his. But their Tears were the Tears of ſympathiſing Humanity: or rather Tears of Delight, on obſerving the ſweet Senſibilities of their Darling.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time Mr. <hi>Frank,</hi> who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on <hi>Harry,</hi> had whiſperingly given the mourning Domeſtics an Intimation, concerning the Perſon of the Stranger who had arrived. Some of them well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered him; and All of them had hear'd of him, and conceived a very kindly Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our <hi>Harry.</hi> They firſt expreſſed their mutual Joy, by Kiſſes, Embraces, and ſilent Shakes of the Hand; but, in a little Space, their Congratulations became more loud and tumultuous, and the Voice of Exultation was hear'd through all the lower Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry,</hi> hereupon, felt himſelf ſecretly hurt, and turning to his Father his yet tearful Countenance, my Lord, ſays he, I beſeech you to ſuppreſs this unſeaſonable Sound of Joy among your Servants, in a Houſe that ought ſo juſtly to be the Houſe of Mourning. — My Love, mildly and kindly anſwered the Earl, I cannot wholly refuſe, to my poor and afflicted People,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0237300105:8"/>ſome Share of that Comfort which I myſelf feel on the Return of my <hi>Harry.</hi> They are All my old and true Servants, my Child, this is no other than an Expreſſion of their Love to you and to me, and I requeſt you to receive them affectionately for my Sake.</p>
            <p>Here the Earl rung a Bell, and deſired tha tall his Domeſtics ſhould come in.</p>
            <p>They accordingly entered. <hi>Harry</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly recollected Mr. <hi>John,</hi> the Steward, Mr. <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Butler, and old Mrs. <hi>Mary,</hi> the Cook. He called them by their Names, reminded them of old Times, and took them in his Arms with much Affection. He then turned to the other Servants. He took Each of them by the Hand in Turns, and ſpoke to them, with ſuch a natural Eaſe and Lowlineſs, as though he himſelf deſired, in his Father's Houſe, to become alſo, <hi>as One of his hired Servants.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, gathering All about him, they catched and kiſſed his Hand by Force; and then, kneeling around, they promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly petitioned for Bleſſings on his Head; and riſing, retired in a pleaſing Paſſion of Sobs and Tears; while the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raptured Earl beheld All; with a Mixture of ſuch bliſsful Senſations, as he had never felt before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0237300105:9"/>
It now began to grow late, and, after a ſhort Repaſt of ſome ſmall Matters; my Lord propoſed their retiring to Bed, but, my Friend, ſaid he to <hi>Harry,</hi> you muſt content yourſelf with being my Priſoner for the preſent; you muſt lie in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; I will not truſt my Lamb from my Side, for Fear of its going once more aſtray. Ah, my Lord, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> there is no Fear of that. My Heart is wholly your Property, and you have, thereby, a ſure Hold of all that I am or can have.</p>
            <p>The next Morning, <hi>Harry</hi> impatiently roſe, before the Servants were ſtirring; and unlocking the great Door, and cloſing it ſoftly after him, he went out exulting on his premeditated Expedition. He recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitred and recollected the quondam Scenes of his Childhood, and, flying like a Bird over the Hedges and other Obſtacles, he made the ſhorteſt Way to his ſtill precious Mammy's.</p>
            <p>When he approached the Place of his infant Endearments, he met his Foſterfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther going forth to his Field, with a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and melancholy Air, on his uſual Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations. <hi>Harry</hi> inſtantly remembered the Features, once ſo delightful, and ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and catching at him, he kiſſed and claſped him repeatedly, and cried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, my Daddy, my Daddy, my dear,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0237300105:10"/>dear Daddy <hi>Dobſon!</hi> how glad am I to ſee you once again! how is my Mammy, my dear Mammy? how is little <hi>Tommy</hi> and little <hi>Rachel,</hi> and all our dear Family?</p>
            <p>The old Man then, reſpectfully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing a Space, I don't know you, my ſweet Maſter, ſaid he; I never ſaw you before. Indeed but you did; many and many a time and oft, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> you carried me in your Arms, almoſt the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long Day, and preſſed and huſhed me to ſleep at Night in your Boſom. Don't you remember, your little <hi>Harry?</hi> don't you remember my two Dogs, don't you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my Cock?</p>
            <p>O, exclaimed the good old Man, I now believe that you are my Child, the deareſt Child that ever was born! But, I never hoped to ſee him ſuch a Thing as you are; I never thought to ſee ſuch a glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon Earth!</p>
            <p>Here, old <hi>Dobſon</hi> returned <hi>Harry</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes with a two-fold Force, and, blubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all aloud, had like to have ſmothered him with the Intenſeneſs of his Embraces.</p>
            <p>Bring me, bring me, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> to the Sight of my deareſt Mammy, I am all impatient, to behold her!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0237300105:11"/>
Not ſo faſt, ſaid Gaffer <hi>Dobſon,</hi> I love my old loving <hi>Cate,</hi> and, ſhould ſhe find you out, of a ſudden, ſhe would certainly die of Joy. But, I will bring you to her as a Stranger, and ſo you may bring Matters about. And, indeed, I fear that my own Head is likely to be crazed by this Buſineſs; for I do not find that I am the ſame Man that I was a while agone, I ſhall grow too proud, I doubt, and look down upon all my better Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Goodman <hi>Dobſon</hi> then conducted <hi>Harry</hi> to their ancient Habitation. Nurſe <hi>Dobſon</hi> was juſt up, and preparing to comb the Heads of her Children, when they entered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cate,</hi> ſays he, I have brought to you a young Stranger, who ſays he can give you ſome Account of our little <hi>Harry,</hi> who ſays he is ſtill alive, notwithſtanding all your Frights, and will ſhortly pay a Viſit to ſome Parts of this Country; and who knows then, but that we, among Others, may happen to ſet our Eyes upon him, and that, I think, would be a great Bleſſing, my <hi>Cate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O, no, no, no, exclaimed Nurſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deigning to caſt her Eyes on the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; he is dead, he is gone from me theſe many many Years; I once hoped to have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0237300105:12"/>his Infant on my Knee and in my Boſom, but that Hope is quite gone; never, never ſhall I behold my Darling again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> had ſeated himſelf juſt oppoſite to Nurſe; when, looking up, ſhe ſtarted, and ſtared eagerly in his Face. Don't impoſe upon me, <hi>William,</hi> ſays ſhe; tell me, tell me at once, mayhap this is my Child! Ah, againſt the World, the Dimple in that Smile, is the Dimple of my <hi>Harry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Harry</hi> ſprung up and, at one Leap, caught his riſing Nurſe in his Arms, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my Mammy, my Mammy, my deareſt Mammy, do I live to be preſſed once more to your dear Boſom!</p>
            <p>But the poor Woman breathed ſhort, and could not get out a Word. Twenty times ſhe put him from her, and catched him to her again, gazing at him, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, with a frantic Affection. At length, ſhe caſt herſelf back, on the Bench that was behind her, and, clapping her Hands together, ſhe gave a great Shout, and burſt into an hyſterical Paſſion of Tears; while <hi>Harry</hi> ſeated himſelf beſide her, and gently drawing her Head to him, placed it fondly on his Boſom, and mixed his Tears with her's.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0237300105:13"/>
This Guſh came very ſeaſonably for our loving Nurſe's Relief. She ſoon recovered her Breath and her Senſes; and, ſeeing ſome Drops on her <hi>Harry</hi>'s Cheeks, ſhe drew them in with her Lips, crying, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pearls be theſe! I would not exchange One of them for the brighteſt Diamond in the Mines.</p>
            <p>Mammy, ſays <hi>Harry,</hi> I ſtole away to come and ſee you, while my Father was aſleep, or elſe I ſhould not have had Leave to ſtir from him a Foot. But You and my Daddy muſt promiſe to come and dine with me, we will have a Table by Our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And do You, my dear Mammy, ſtep to our Houſe, and, if my Father ſhould miſs me, tell him I am gone into the Town and will be back with him before Breakfaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then ſtepped to the Village, and, remembering Gaffer <hi>Truck</hi>'s Houſe, he went familiarly in, and enquired of the good Woman how all the Family was. Pray, how is my honeſt old <hi>Bartholemew,</hi> ſays he, and how is your pretty Daughter <hi>Molly,</hi> and above all what is become of my old Friend <hi>Tom?</hi> The poor Woman, all in Amazement, cried, a pretty <hi>Tom</hi> he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, to be Friend to ſuch a ſweet young Gentleman as You are. But Truth is that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0237300105:14"/>our <hi>Tom</hi> is at prentice to a Barber at next Door. Well, ſays <hi>Harry,</hi> when Gaffer <hi>Truck</hi> comes Home, tell him that his old Acquaintance, <hi>Harry Clinton,</hi> called to ſee him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tom</hi> had juſt finiſhed an Operation on a Neighbour, as our Hero entered. How are you <hi>Tom,</hi> ſays he, careleſsly. <hi>Tom</hi> gaped, and ſtared, and gaped; but anſwered not a Word. Will you give me a Caſt of your Office, <hi>Tom?</hi> Ay, that I will, Maſter, as ſoon you get a Beard. Why, <hi>Tom,</hi> you are grown a huge hulking Fellow ſince I ſaw you laſt; will you ſtep to yonder Green and wreſtle one Fall with me? No, no, Maſter, I ſhould hurt you; methinks I could throw a Dozen of ſuch fairweather Gentlemen as You are, Maſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> inſtantly ſeized <hi>Tom,</hi> by the Breaſt with one Hand, and by the Shoulder with the Other; when <hi>Tom,</hi> feeling the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Hurt of his Gripe, immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted his Powers, and grappled with his Adverſary. But <hi>Harry,</hi> giving him a ſlight Foot, laid him on the broad of his Back in the Middle of his own Floor; but kept him, with both Hands, from being hurt againſt the Ground.</p>
            <p>I believe, ſaid <hi>Tom,</hi> riſing, You muſt zertainly be the Devil; and come, as they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0237300105:15"/>ſay, to fling poor Sinners in the Shape of an Angel of Light. Ah, <hi>Tom, Tom,</hi> cried <hi>Harry,</hi> this is not the firſt Struggle that you and I have had. Do you remember the Bag of Nuts and poor blind <hi>Tommy?</hi> have you forgot your old Friend, your lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Harry Clinton?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bleſs'd Mercy! exclaimed <hi>Tom,</hi> can you be my young Lord, my Heart's dear young Maſter? I am indeed, anſwered <hi>Harry,</hi> your old Acquaintance, my dear <hi>Tom,</hi> your loving Friend, <hi>Harry Clinton.</hi> And ſo ſaying, he took <hi>Tom</hi> about the Neck and kiſſed him very cordially.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tom,</hi> ſays <hi>Harry,</hi> I want you to take a Walk with me; <hi>Tom</hi> inſtantly aſſented, and out they went.</p>
            <p>As they walked along, <hi>Harry</hi> began to grow ſad. <hi>Tom,</hi> ſaid he, do you know where my dear Brother <hi>Dickey</hi> was buried? Yes, Sir, ſaid <hi>Tom,</hi> a great Way off, in yonder Church Yard below the Town's End. Do you know where the Sexton lives, <hi>Tom?</hi> In a little white Houſe, Sir, juſt joining the Yard.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they arrived, <hi>Tom</hi> called out the Sexton, and <hi>Harry,</hi> putting a Guinea into his Hand, ordered him directly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock the Family Vault.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0237300105:16"/>
The Man looked aſtoniſhed, but obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Silence, and <hi>Harry,</hi> as he entered, deſired the Sexton and <hi>Tom</hi> to wait at a Diſtance, and promiſed to be with them, by and by.</p>
            <p>He put to the Door after him, juſt leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Light enough to diſtinguiſh the recent Depoſits of the Dead.</p>
            <p>O, ſaid he, as he advanced, thou true Houſe of Mourning, thou ſilent End of all Men, how ſad art thou to Senſe! how ſad to me above All, who beareſt in thy dark Boſom ſuch precious and beloved Relicks.</p>
            <p>Then, caſting himſelf on the Coffins of my Lady and Lord <hi>Richard,</hi> as they lay Side by Side; and claſping his Arms about them as far as he could reach; O, he cried, my Mother, my Brother, my deareſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my deareſt Mother, you are gone, you are gone from me, and You never knew the Love that your Son and Brother had for You. Ah, how did I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, what Happineſs did I not propoſe, in attending, ſerving, and pleaſing You; in doing thouſands of tender, kindly and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing Offices about You! but you are ſnatched from me, my Mother, you are ſnatched from me, my Brother! all my Proſpects are defeated and cut away for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0237300105:17"/>ever. You will no more return to me, but I ſhall go to You; and O, that I were laid with You this Minute in this ſtill and peaceful Manſion; where Hopes and Fears ceaſe, and All are humbled together!</p>
            <p>Mean while, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> and gone abroad on his Morning's Walk. He met Nurſe on her Way to the Manſion Houſe, and, accoſting her in a kind of Triumph, my good Nurſe, ſays he, we have bleſſed Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings for you, Your <hi>Harry,</hi> your Hero, is come to the Country. I know it, Sir, I know it, anſwered Nurſe, it is but a little while ago that my Babe left my Boſom.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> then proceeded in order to join his young Friend, enquiring of All he met which Way Lord <hi>Henry</hi> went, till at laſt he was directed to the Church Yard. There he found <hi>Tom</hi> and the Sexton who, on further Queſtion, ſilently pointed to the Door of the Family Vault, that hung on the jar.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> felt himſelf affected, and withdrew to a greater Diſtance; but ſtill keeping his tearful Eye on the ſad Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that now held the Living with the Dead.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>Harry</hi> came forth, drying his Cheeks with his Handkerchief. He aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0237300105:18"/>a conſtrained Air of Chearfulneſs, and joining <hi>Tom</hi> and the Sexton, obſerved that a great Crowd was gathering in the Town.</p>
            <p>Who are Thoſe, <hi>Tom?</hi> ſays he; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, anſwered <hi>Tom,</hi> your Honour's Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and old Acquaintances, who are get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together to welcome You to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. If that is the Caſe, <hi>Tom,</hi> we muſt go and ſalute them; and You ſhall intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me and tell me who is who.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> perceiving that <hi>Harry</hi> was on his Return, kept onward, aloof from him, but with an Eye on his Motions.</p>
            <p>By this Time, the Crowd had ſorted themſelves, the Principals of the Families into one Group, the young Men into Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the fair Maidens into Another. And, as <hi>Harry</hi> approached, They all ſet up a joint Shout of Triumph.</p>
            <p>Pleaſe your Honour, ſays <hi>Tom,</hi> this is my Father; and this is Gaffer <hi>Gubbins,</hi> and this Goodman <hi>Demſter,</hi> and this Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Felſter,</hi> and ſo on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry,</hi> with the Lowlineſs of a Waſher of Feet, would have kiſſed and embraced them All in Turns; but, preſſing about him, they ſeized a Hand on either Side,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0237300105:19"/>and eagerly kiſſed them, as alſo the Skirts of his Clothes all round.</p>
            <p>God bleſs your ſweet Face, God bleſs your ſweet Face! cried Goodman <hi>Demſter,</hi> who ſo ſees it in a Morning, can't fail, I think, of proſpering the live-long Day.</p>
            <p>When he came, in Succeſſion, to the Companions of his Infancy, as he kiſſed and ſhook Hands with Each, in turn; Some reminded him of his having beat them at Boxing, Others at Wreſtling, and All of his having play'd with them at Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-Bars, Leapfrog, Shoot the Gate, and ſo forth.</p>
            <p>Mean while, the Girls panted, gazed at him, and longed to get him to themſelves. Sir, ſays <hi>Tom,</hi> here is your old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, my Siſter <hi>Molly;</hi> there is not a Lad, in the Town, whom ſhe is not able to toſs, except your Honour. <hi>Molly</hi> looked full of Health as <hi>Haebe,</hi> and roſey as the May, and <hi>Harry</hi> caught her about the Neck and kiſſed her very cordially. Do you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me, <hi>Molly?</hi> O, anſwered <hi>Molly,</hi> I ſhall never forget, ſince your Honour's Lordſhip and I uſed to wreſtle every Day behind our Houſe. Ay, <hi>Molly,</hi> cried <hi>Harry,</hi> there was no Harm in it then; but a Fall, at this Day, might be Dangerous to One of us; above all things take Care of that,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0237300105:20"/>my good <hi>Molly.</hi> And, if you know ere a pretty Lad, to whom you have a Liking, I will give You fifty Guineas, for old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance ſake, toward making up your Portion.</p>
            <p>The Reſt of the Girls now preſſed for their Share of <hi>Harry,</hi> and it was with Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty that he divided himſelf with any ſatisfactory Equality among them, as they All kiſſed him ſo cloſe, and ſeemed ſo loth to part.</p>
            <p>At length, <hi>Harry</hi>'s Watch reminded him that it was Time to attend his Father, and, as he parted, they ſhouted after him, long Life and Health and Honours, to our Townſman, our own Boy, our own dear ſweet Child!</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Home, with his Heart full of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to the Earl. When <hi>Harry</hi> arrived, Breakfaſt was on Table, and he perceived that his Father had been in Tears. But, no Notice was taken of the Affair at the Charnel Houſe, on either Part.</p>
            <p>When Breakfaſt was over, <hi>Harry</hi> called in <hi>John.</hi> Mr. <hi>John,</hi> ſays he, can you tell me how many Families there are in this Village of Yours? Twenty five Families exactly, my Lord. Then <hi>Harry</hi> turned to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0237300105:21"/>his Father and ſaid, if your Lordſhip will be pleaſed to lend me five hundred Guineas for the preſent, I will pay you very honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Hour that my Uncle comes to the Country. Why, Sirrah, cried the Earl pleaſantly, what Right has your Uncle to pay your Debts, eſpecially to ſuch a great Amount as you ſpeak of? O, my Lord, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Harry,</hi> I have already ſquandered away above fifty thouſand Pounds of his Money, and this is but a Trifle which, I am ſure, I may very ſafely add to the Reſt.</p>
            <p>Here the Earl looked truely aſtoniſhed. Fifty thouſand Pounds! he exclaimed, impoſſible, <hi>Harry.</hi> Why, you had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch Ponds or Lakes, as mine, in <hi>London,</hi> wherein you might make Ducks and Drakes of them. How, in the World, could you contrive it, where did you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them?</p>
            <p>In Hoſpitals and in Priſons, my Father, anſwered <hi>Harry.</hi> In Streets and Highways, among the Wretched and the Indigent. Supplying Eyes to the Blind, and Limbs to the Lame; and Chearfulneſs to the Sorrowful and broken of Heart; for ſuch was my Uncle's Orders.</p>
            <p>Let me go, let me go from this Place, my Lord, cried <hi>Meekly!</hi> this Boy will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely kill me, if I ſtay any longer. He
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0237300105:22"/>overpowers, he ſuffocates me with the Weight of his Sentiments.</p>
            <p>Well, <hi>Harry,</hi> ſaid the Earl, go to my Deſk, here is the Key of the Drawer on the left Hand, and I make you a Preſent of the Key and the Contents; perhaps you may find there nearly as much as will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer your preſent Exigencies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> went and, opening the Drawer, was aſtoniſhed to ſee it quite full of Gold. However he took no more than juſt the Sum propoſed and, returning to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid, what ſhall I do, my Lord, with that vaſt Heap of Money? Why, you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Rogue, replied the Earl, there is not as much in it as will pay the Debt you have contracted with one Man. O, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> I am quite eaſy upon that Score; I will never affront my Uncle by the Offer of a Penny. And, don't you think, ſaid the Earl, that we have got Poor among us in the Country, as well as you have in the City, <hi>Harry?</hi> I believe you may have got Some, my Lord, but then I am much more difficult, than you may think, in the Objects on whom I would chooſe to confer Charity. I look upon the Money, amaſſed by the Wealthy, to have been already extracted from the Earnings of the Poor, the poor Farmer, the poor Craftsman, the hard-handed Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0237300105:23"/>and the Day Labourer, whoſe ſeven Children perhaps ſubſiſt on the Milk of a Couple of Cows. Wherefore, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, on whom we beſtow theſe Gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ought at leaſt to be ſomething poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and more worthy of Compaſſion than Thoſe from whom the Money was exacted. So ſaying, he ſtepped out.</p>
            <p>Amazing Boy! cried Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> how new, and yet how juſt was that Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! I am, cried the Earl, as it were in a Kind of delicious Dream, and can ſcarce yet believe myſelf ſo bleſſed as to be the Father of ſuch a Child!</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Harry</hi> had called <hi>John</hi> aſide. Mr. <hi>John,</hi> ſays he, here are five hundred Guineas. Be pleaſed to ſtep and diſtribute them by twenty Guineas to Each of the Families in the Village. I would ſave you the Trouble, and give them my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but that, for the preſent, my Heart turns with Diſguſt from their Thanks and their Honours. Tell them that this is a Token, in Memory of my dear Brother, to keep them in mind of him. Tell them further that I will have no Carouſals, no Rejoycings, on Account of my Arrival; and that it would pleaſe me infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if my Return would bring their late Loſſes to their Remembrance, and ſet them All in Tears and Lamentations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0237300105:24"/>
My Lord now propoſed a Saunter into the Park, in order to procure an Appetite for Dinner. Accordingly the Gate was ordered to be unlocked; and they entered on a Gravel Walk, that was walled in on the left Hand, and paled in on the Right, along the Verge of five Canals that fell, ſucceſſively, in Caſcades, the One into the Other. Beyond the Canals, a vaſt Lawn fled the Eye, thinly interſperſed with Trees of different Hues and Natures. The Lawn again was cloſed by an extenſive Lake; and, on the further Side of the Lake, there roſe and ſunk ſeveral Glens, that varied their Forms to the Proſpect, as they walked. Beyond the Glens there aroſe, again, to the Eye, a huge Foreſt of time-immemorial Oaks. And, beyond All, there aſcended a Range of romantic Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, whoſe Fronts were whitened here and there with impending Rocks; but whoſe Tops ſcaled the Heavens, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded their Forms and Colours with the Clouds.</p>
            <p>As they talked and walked along, they met with a ſix barred Gate that directly thwarted their Paſſage; and my Lord reached his Hand, through the Rails, for the Key, that the Keeper had left in the Lock on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, but he could not get at it. We are All at a full Stop now, ſaid he, unleſs <hi>Harry</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0237300105:25"/>could make a Shift to climb over the Gate; but no, don't, my Dear, your Foot might happen to ſlip between the Rails and hurt you. I will obey your Lordſhip, anſwered <hi>Harry,</hi> I will not venture a Foot upon One of them. So ſaying, he catched at the topmoſt Bar with his left Hand, and, throwing himſelf ſlightly over, opened the Gate for his Companions. The Earl and Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> ſtood mute, in utter Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At length the Earl cried, Child, you muſt ſurely be of more than mortal Mould, or elſe you have a familiar Spirit that conveys you through the Air. I have indeed a familiar Spirit, my Lord, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Harry,</hi> a Spirit much humbled by the Senſe of its own Defects.</p>
            <p>On their Return, <hi>John</hi> called his Maſter aſide, and told him of his due Diſtribution of <hi>Harry</hi>'s Bounty to the Villagers. But my Lord, ſaid he, when I went down I found them All very buſily employed, in prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bonfires and Illuminations in Honour of my young Lord. This, however, I was obliged to countermand, by his ſpecial Order; and it has greatly mortified all your poor People. Well, well, ſaid the Earl, it can't be helped for the preſent; we muſt not dare to offend our <hi>Harry</hi> at any Rate; and ſo thoſe Matters of Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing may reſt in Reſerve till the Arrival of my Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0237300105:26"/>
Soon afterward, our Hero's Foſterers came, decked out in their beſt Attire; and <hi>Harry</hi> ordered a ſide Table to be covered for him and them, but my Lord inſiſted on their dining all together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> placed himſelf very lovingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, at Table, that he might help them and prevail upon their Baſhfulneſs to eat.</p>
            <p>When the Repaſt was nearly over, Nurſe enquired after the little Beggar-Boy, whoſe Abſence, ſhe imagined, had cauſed the Elopement of her Darling. He is come to great Fortune, anſwered <hi>Harry,</hi> he has found his Father and Mother, and is Heir to a large Eſtate. <hi>Harry</hi> then told the Manner in which <hi>Ned</hi> had been diſcovered, and they were All highly pleaſed and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Relation.</p>
            <p>But Mammy, ſays <hi>Harry,</hi> what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of my Siſter <hi>Nelly</hi> on whoſe Milk I was ſuckled? and what is become of my little Brother <hi>Tommy,</hi> who was but two Years younger than myſelf?—They are both dead, my Precious; but God has been pleaſed to give me Others in their Room. — Well, Mammy, I find we muſt all die, and, ſome time or other, that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0237300105:27"/>will be a great Grief to One of us, which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of us ſhall happen to outlive the Other. I am ſatisfied to die once, ſaid Nurſe, but, never let me hear again of your dying, my Angel, I can't ſuffer the Thought, ſhe cried, and burſt forth into Tears; I cou'dn't bear, I cou'dn't bear to die a thouſand Deaths in the Death of my <hi>Harry!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Mammy, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> in order to divert her Paſſion, you have not yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after the Man with the Beard. O, the old Rogue, exclaimed Nurſe, I can't think of him with Patience. Ay, but, Mammy, you muſt know that, that ſame old Rogue is my own darling Uncle, an own and only dear Brother to my own dear Father here. If that is the Caſe, ſaid Nurſe, I don't wonder he ſhould ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yearn after you; and indeed I would rather wonder if all the World did not yearn and long after you, my Love!</p>
            <p>And now, Mammy, to ſhew you how much you are obliged to this ſame darling Uncle, he has ordered me to make you a Preſent of five hundred Pounds, in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he ſays, of the Grief he has coſt you. And take no Heed for your Children, Mammy, I will take that Care upon my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for this ſame dear Uncle has made me a Gift of the Lands, and Houſe, and Plate, and Furniture that he has in this
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0237300105:28"/>Town, and ſo you ſee I am well able to provide for you All.</p>
            <p>Here, my Lord caſt an Eye of tender Jealouſy upon <hi>Harry.</hi> I perceive, my Son, ſaid he, that your Uncle is your only Truſt, the only Dependance that you chooſe to have upon Earth. <hi>Harry,</hi> with a Glance of his Eye, inſtantly caught the Meaning of the Eye of his Father; and, throwing himſelf at his Feet, O, pardon, my Lord, he cried, pray, pardon the Overflowings of a grateful and ſimple Heart! My Uncle is my Property, but I am your's, my Father, to be diſpoſed of in Life, and in Death, at your Pleaſure. I do truſt, I do depend upon you, my Father, and you have already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd me with the Weight of your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
            <p>My Lord's Eyes then gliſtened, and raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son, and taking him fondly to his Boſom, I believe I have been wrong, my Love, ſaid he; and hereafter I ſhall always think ſo, rather than think any thing amiſs in my <hi>Harry.</hi> But, tell me, my Dear, and tell me ſincerely; you ſpeak of your Uncle, as One of the richeſt and greateſt Men upon Earth; as a Prince, as an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, enabled to give away Fortunes and Provinces at Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0237300105:29"/>
And he is, my Lord, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> he is greater than any Prince or Emperor upon Earth. To ſpeak only of his temporal Wealth and Power, the moſt inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Part of his Value. He can do, as I may ſay, what he pleaſes in <hi>England.</hi> The Miniſtry are at his Beck, they profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves his Servants; and even his Majeſty acknowledges himſelf deeply his Debtor, and owes him, I dare ſay, Half a Million of ſterling <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet this is the Man, exclaimed the Earl, (turning an Eye of Penitence on Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi>) this is the Man, as I told you, my Friend, on whom I looked down with ſuch provoking Contempt; whom I treated with ſuch unpardonable Inſolence and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy.</p>
            <p>My Lord then enquired concerning the perſonal Adventures of our Hero in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the Account of which would have been more entertaining, had not <hi>Harry</hi> ſuppreſſed, throughout his Narration, whatever he apprehended might tend to his own Honour.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Foſterers had taken their leave, my Lord propoſed a Walk to his Gueſts, in the Gardens; and, after a few Turns, they ſat down in a rural Arbour, that was interwoven, all about, with Jeſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and Honeyſuckle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0237300105:30"/>
Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> ſaid the Earl, I have often longed to hear the Particulars of your Life, and how you came to live by Faith and not by Sight, and to hold your Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Heaven, as you do at this Day.</p>
            <p>I can ſoon obey your Lordſhip, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Meekly,</hi> for my Story is very ſhort and very ſimple, and no way adorned with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Incidents.</p>
            <p>My Mother died a few Hours after I was born. My Father did not ſurvive her two Years; and I fell to the Care of my only Kinſman, an Uncle by my Father's Side.</p>
            <p>My Uncle was an old Batchelor, and though he was of a cold Temper and had no Tenderneſs for any One, he yet ſpared no Coſt in my Education. He ſent me to <hi>Eaton</hi> School, and from thence to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where I remained till I took my Degrees. I then went to <hi>London,</hi> bought a Sword and Sword-Knot, and commenced fine Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Though my Head had been duly ſtored, by my Tutors, in the Rudiments of our Religion, my Heart had not yet felt any of its Precepts; and I conceived that, to go regularly to Church, receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, confeſs myſelf a miſerable Sinner,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0237300105:31"/>and avoid groſs Vices, was the Sum of Chriſtianity. I therefore entered, without Scruple, into all the faſhionable Pleaſures and Vanities of the Age; and I held that, to pardon an Affront, would have been One of the deadly Sins, in a <hi>Gentleman-Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Day, at <hi>James</hi>'s Coffeehouſe, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Stannard</hi> and another Gentleman en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, at Backgammon, for five hundred Guineas; and, as the Stake was ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and both Parties celebrated for their Skill in the Game, we all crowded about them, to ſee the Iſſue.</p>
            <p>I happened to be next behind the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel's Chair, and Others preſſed behind me, eagerly bending and looking over my Shoulders. At length he began to fret, as the Game was drawing to a Cloſe and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt him. Pray, Gentlemen, he would cry, don't bear upon me ſo; for Heaven's Sake keep off, you will make me loſe the Game. Hereupon, I did my utmoſt to bear back from him, but the Company preſſed me forward, in Spite of all I could do. Till the Colonel, giving an unhappily deciſive Caſt, turned about in a Fury, and ſpit directly in my Face.</p>
            <p>Indignation gave me ſudden and unuſal Strength, and, caſting All off who had
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0237300105:32"/>borne upon me, I inſtantly drew my Sword and ran the Colonel through the Body. The Company cried out that all was fair, and opening a Window for me, they urged me to eſcape. Accordingly I got off, rode Poſt to <hi>Dover,</hi> and there embarqued for <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Colonel, God be praiſed, did not die of his Wound. He lay under the Hands of the Doctors for about ſeven Months, then recovered and went to join his Regiment in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this my Uncle ſent me Advice, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me at the ſame Time that I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with ſafety. Yes, thought I, with ſafety to my Life, but with Death to my Honour! I have taken Revenge indeed, but not Satisfaction; the Colonel muſt be compelled to make me perſonal Reparation for the Affront which he dared to put upon me. His Recovery has again daſhed the Spit into my Face; and I will purſue him through the World, till it is wiped from the Obſervation and Remembrance of all Men.</p>
            <p>With this deadly Determination, I went Poſt, from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and traced the Colonel from Place to Place, till I found him in a Village, on the Road to <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0237300105:33"/>
I believe, Sir, ſaid I bluntly, you mayn't remember me, for our Acquaintance was ſudden and of very ſhort Duration; I am the Man in whoſe Face you ſpit publickly, at <hi>James</hi>'s Coffeehouſe. Then, Sir, ſaid he, I am ſcarce yet recovered of the Cauſe which you gave me to bear you always in Mind; but pray, what may your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands be with me, for the preſent? I am come to demand a Remedy, at your Hands, for the Wound which you gave my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and which otherwiſe muſt remain for ever incurable. Ah, he cried, no Man ever exacted ſo ſevere a Satisfaction as you have already taken; what then may be the Nature of the further Reparation, that you are pleaſed to require? Either to aſk my Pardon, or fight me within this Hour.</p>
            <p>That is very hard upon me, indeed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Colonel; the Honour of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion will not allow me to beg Pardon of any Man, at leaſt in order to avoid a Combat; ſo Sir, if you inſiſt upon it, I muſt obey your Summons, though very reluctantly, I confeſs. Then Sir, ſaid I, meet me in Half an Hour, with your Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols and Sword, behind yonder little Hill.</p>
            <p>The Colonel was punctual to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. We both graſped a Piſtol, at a Diſtance of twenty Paces, and advancing,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0237300105:34"/>Step by Step, cried fire! fire! fire! Each ſeeming determined to make ſure of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary; till, coming within Arm's length, I fired directly in his Face, but the Ball paſſed through his Hat, and only grazed the Skin of his left Temple.</p>
            <p>The Colonel then took his Piſtol into his left Hand, and reaching out his Right to me, with a Smile of great Complacence, I think Sir, ſaid he, I may now aſk your Pardon with Honour And to convince you that I did not come to engage You in Malice, be pleaſed to examine my Arms, you will not find ſo much as a Grain of Powder in the One or the Other.</p>
            <p>Ah, Colonel, I then exclaimed, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you my Conqueror both in Honour and Humanity. Had I been ſo unhappy as to kill you, and find your Arms unload<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſhould certainly have done you Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, by ſhooting myſelf through the Head. But, why did I purſue you from Kingdom to Kingdom; why was I unappeaſed by all the Blood that I ſhed? was it from any Malignity of Heart toward you? by no Means; but, while I lamented the Miſery I had already occaſioned You, I was impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to finiſh your Deſtruction, by a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian World, or rather, by the bloody Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers of Cuſtom, whoſe Cenſure I dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, worſe than Death, or even Futurity.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0237300105:35"/>Courage, Colonel, incites Soldiers to fight for their Country; but it is Cowardiſe alone that drives Duelliſts together.</p>
            <p>For three affectionate Days, I remained with my late Enemy, but now warm Friend. He then was obliged to return to Quarters; and we parted, with a Regret much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Hoſtility with which we had met.</p>
            <p>On the Departure of the Colonel I went to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> from whence I drew upon my Uncle to the amount of £700. For I reſolved, before my Return, to take a Tour through the Seven Provinces, though I had gone for a very different Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>During nine Months I reſided, or jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyed from Place to Place, among that People. <hi>Holland</hi> is, unqueſtionably, the wealthieſt, the buſieſt, and moſt populous State upon Earth. Not a Hand is unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, not a Foot of Ground unoccupied; and, for a long time, I aſcribed their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Proſperity to an Induſtry and Ingenuity peculiar to them alone. But, on further Obſervation, I diſcovered the true Source as well of their Induſtry as their Opulence, and am perſuaded that any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, bordering on the Ocean, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the like Proſperity from the ſame Spring.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0237300105:36"/>
Not, my Lord, that I think Opulence a real Benefit to a People, for <hi>Man's Life conſiſteth not in the Abundance of his Poſſeſſions.</hi> But I look upon Induſtry, the natural Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Opulence, to be as well a Bleſſing as a Duty to Man, from the Time that he was appointed to <hi>earn his Bread in the Sweat of his Brow.</hi> Many mental Virtues, alſo, as well as temporal Benefits follow in the Train of Induſtry; it makes Men health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, brave, honeſt, ſocial, and pacific. He, who labours hard to acquire a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, will ſtruggle hard to preſerve it, and Exerciſe will make him active, robuſt and able for the Purpoſe. As the Man of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry hath, in himſelf, a living Fund of Competence for his own Occaſions, he will be the leſs tempted to plunder or prey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Others; and the poignant Senſe and Apprehenſion of being deprived of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, ſo juſtly acquired, will give him the nicer and ſtronger Senſe of ſuch an Injury to Others. Induſtry further incites to Commerce and good Neighbourhood, in order to diſpoſe of mutual Redundancies for the Supply of mutual Wants. And, laſtly, it delighteth in Peace, that its Time and its Labours may not be interrupted, nor the Fruits thereof endangered, by Rapine and Invaſion; and all this may be ſaid of Nations, as well as of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0237300105:37"/>
Your Obſervations, ſaid the Earl, are perfectly juſt; the Works of Induſtry are, unqueſtionably, the Works of Peace, and tend to open the Avenues wherein the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues may walk. But, how to incite Men or Nations to Induſtry, that is the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The finer Arts, we ſee, may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and promoted by National Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as now in <hi>France;</hi> but there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the Bulk of the People to Induſtry, in like Manner; that would be, as though the Public ſhould grant a Bounty to itſelf. Nations certainly differ from Nations as Man differs from Man; Some are, by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, induſtrious and ingenious, ſuch as <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> it is their Propenſity, their Talent; while Others, like <hi>Ireland,</hi> are naturally lazy and liſtleſs, and therefore remain in well merited Indigence.</p>
            <p>You have greatly miſtaken this Point indeed, my Lord. <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> are induſtrious and ingenious, becauſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were through good Hap or good Policy, they hit upon the only Method whereby Induſtry and Ingenuity could be duely promoted. Whereas <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are totally ignorant of the ſaid Method to this Day, though Both of them highly capable of having it put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0237300105:38"/>
You ſurpriſe me, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> ſaid the Earl, a Method to make Men ingenious, a Method to make them induſtrious! how can that be?</p>
            <p>Experience has proved it to be even ſo, my Lord; for where a Method may be found for encouraging and promoting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and Induſtry, that Method will, infallibly, make People become both inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and induſtrious. No Man will work, my Lord, without ſome Hire, or Wages, or Return for his Labour; neither will Any, who are in Want, refuſe to work, when aſſured of a due Reward for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>When the good Houſholder walked out to the Marketplace, and found Labourers loitering there, when it was now toward Evening, he aſked them, <hi>why ſtand ye here all the Day idle?</hi> And when they anſwered, <hi>becauſe no Man hath hired or given us Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,</hi> he took this for a ſufficient Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, he had Compaſſion upon them, and he ſupplied them with the divineſt of all Kinds of Charity, <hi>the Means of earning their own Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, throughout <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> no Perſon is in Want, becauſe All are hired, All employed, the Young and the Old,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0237300105:39"/>the Lame and the Blind; and All find a ready Sale, without Anxiety or Loſs of Time, without Travel or Delay, for the Products of their Induſtry. Throughout <hi>Great Britain,</hi> on the contrary, Nineteen in Twenty are in real Want; and in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as I am told, Forty nine, in Fifty, are nearly in a State of Beggary, merely for want of being employed, for want of Encouragement to Labour.</p>
            <p>Permit me, then, to explain to your Lordſhip, how ſome Men, and ſome Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, come to be encouraged to Induſtry, and Others to be diſcouraged, or, in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, prohibited from it.</p>
            <p>Different Men are endowed with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Talents and Powers, inſufficient in many Reſpects, though ſuperfluous in Others, to their own Occaſions. Different Countries are alſo endowed with different Productions, ſuperfluous in many Reſpects to the Natives, though neceſſary or deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for the Well-being of Foreigners.</p>
            <p>Now, theſe alternate Qualities, of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficience and Abundance, at once invite and impel all Men, and all Countries, to claim and to impart that reciprocal Aſſiſtance which is denominated Commerce. Each gives what he can ſpare, Each receives
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0237300105:40"/>what he wants; the Exchange is to the mutual Advantage of all Parties. And, could a Method be found out for encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Manufacturers to perſevere in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and improve in their Arts, by a ready Conveyance and Sale of all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancies, neither Want nor Superfluity could find Place upon Earth.</p>
            <p>All this is quite clear and ſelf-evident, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> but how to procure this ready Sale is the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip muſt allow that the Way to procure it would be to bring Barterers and Commuters, Buyers and Sellers! All who mutually want and mutually abound, together. For this is the End and Purpoſe of every Market upon Earth.</p>
            <p>Now, in <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in all Continents or inland Countries, the ſeveral Deſarts, Mountains, Marſhes, and other Obſtacles, with the Difficulty, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and Toil of Travel, and the great Expence of Land Carriage, have utterly precluded all Commerce and Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any conſiderable Extent. Inſomuch that it would be eaſier and cheaper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey a Commodity, of any Burden, to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Indies,</hi> than from many Parts of <hi>Great Britain</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> to Others, by Land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0237300105:41"/>
While God appears to ſeparate the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations of the Earth from Each other, by the Intervention of Seas, Lakes, and Rivers, he hath actually and intimately united them thereby.</p>
            <p>WATER ſerves to the Art and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man, as Air ſerves to the Wings of the feathered Species. It is the eaſy and ſpeedy Medium, the ready Conduit and Conveyance, whereby all Redundancies are carried, and all Wants ſupplied. It makes Man, as it were, a Denizen of every Country on the Globe. It ſhortens every Diſtance, and ties the remoteſt Regions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. It carries and communicates the Knowledge, the Virtues, Manufactures, and Arts of each Climate to All. It gives new Springs and Motives to Induſtry, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Invention. It gives a general Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the meaneſt Manufacturer. It gives to each Man an Intereſt in whatever is done upon Earth, the Productions of every Region, and the Tribute of every Nation.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> are the only Countries upon Earth, who have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably availed themſelves of this capital Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Water-Carriage, or Water-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; and therefore they are, incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, the moſt populous and moſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous of all Countries in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0237300105:42"/>
               <hi>China,</hi> as your Lorſhip knows, extends from under the Tropic of <hi>Cancer</hi> to about thirteen hundred Miles <hi>North,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by contains within itſelf all the Variety of Climate, and Degrees of Heat and Cold, that are requiſite for the ſundry Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon Earth. Inſpired by ſome Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt, or Sagacity, not imparted to the reſt of Mankind, they cut and quartered this vaſt Continent, by as many navigable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals as anſwer to the Ducts and Veins in the human Body, for the Diſpenſation of Life and Nouriſhment. Theſe Canals ſerve as Links or Chords to the grand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> they bind Region to Region, Houſe to Houſe, and Man to Man, and hold the Whole as one Syſtem or Family together. This great Kingdom is, thereby, become as one City, and the Canals as ſo many Streets, through which Plenty is diffuſed by Commerce to every Part. If any Art or uſeful Invention com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences or receives Improvement in any Place, it is immediately conveyed to every Place for Imitation and Promotion. No Portion of this wide Continent lies waſte or uncultivated, becauſe the Canals are as ſo many Markets brought to every Man's Door, and, by the perpetual Demand of whatever is ſaleable, incite the Natives to exert themſelves in providing all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancies they poſſibly can, that they may derive Wealth to themſelves by ſupplying
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0237300105:43"/>the reſpective Wants of Others. Thus, throughout the expanded Dominion of <hi>China,</hi> nothing is waſted, nothing loſt, nothing ſuperfluous, nothing wanting. All are employed, active, induſtrious, ingenious, and thriving. Their Canals are intimately to them, what Seas are diffuſively to the reſt of the Globe. They are thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, as a World within themſelves, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to their own Happineſs and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. They never change their Manners or Policy. They never enterpriſe War againſt Others. And <hi>China</hi> is affirmed at this Day, to contain one hundred and twenty Million of proſpering Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> alſo, about a hundred and forty Years ago, followed the Example of the <hi>Chineſe.</hi> Their Country is now become as one great and extended Metropolis to the Univerſe; and through their Canals as through paved and ſpacious High-Ways, the World reſorts with all its Wealth. So encouraged and ſo incited, neither the Lame, nor the Blind, nor the Maimed, ſit unemployed. Every Child is taught its Trade from the Moment it can apply its little Hands to a regular Motion, and they bring to the Parents vaſt Sums, in lieu of an infinite Variety of Toys and Trifles that are diſperſed among the Idle of the other Children of Men. For, Barterers, and Commuters, Buyers and Sellers, Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0237300105:44"/>and Merchants, like <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thiſbe,</hi> want nothing but the removal of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Obſtacles, to meet and to multiply a ſimilary Progeny.</p>
            <p>From what has been premiſed, my Lord, it is moſt evident, That Induſtry is the Parent of the Wealth of this World. That no Man's Induſtry is ſufficient to his own Occaſions. That the mutual Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance denominated Commerce is, therefore, neceſſary to the Well-being of all People. That the reciprocal Advantage of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce conſiſts in ſupplying mutual Wants with mutual Redundancies. That this Commerce, however, cannot be carried on without a Medium for the Conveyance of ſuch Supplies. That ſuch a Medium, by Land, even where it is practicable, is tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, toilſome, expenſive, extremely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging, and cannot be puſhed to any conſiderable Extent or Effect. That God, however, hath opened for the Purpoſe, an eaſy, ſpeedy and univerſal Medium of Seas, Lakes, and Rivers, Part of which he hath left unnavigable, that Man might finiſh, by Art, what Nature had prepared, and contribute in ſome Degree to his own Advantages. That accordingly <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> (and <hi>France</hi> of late) have purſued the Path ſo divinely appointed, and that Power, Wealth and Proſperity have flowed in upon them, in Proportion as they have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0237300105:45"/>opened the Medium of Water-carriage for their Reception. And, that Cauſes which have produced their concomitant Effects, without Variation, from the earlieſt Ages to the preſent Period, muſt be preſumed to produce the like Effects, through all Countries and Ages to the End of Time.</p>
            <p>I proteſt, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> exclaimed the Earl, you have puſhed this Matter into mathematical Demonſtration. What a happy, what a glorious Proſpect now opens to my View! How eaſily, how ſpeedily, how profitably might this Method be put in Execution, throughout the Earth! There is no Deficiency of Rivers, or collateral Streams for the Purpoſe. The Sinking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earth would give Vent to new Springs, and extract Plenty of Water in all Places for an inland Navigation; and Half the Number of Hands, that periſh through War and Want, might be peacefully and plentifully employed in accompliſhing this Weal of Mankind. Famine and Depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would then ceaſe. Nation would no longer riſe up againſt Nation, nor Man againſt Man. The Earth, by Culture, would ſoon become capable of ſuſtaining tenfold the Number of its preſent Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. We ſhould no more be tempted to puſh Each Other from Exiſtence. We ſhould find ourſelves mutually intereſted in preſerving and multiplying the Lives of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0237300105:46"/>All from whoſe Labours we were to derive ſuch Advantages. All would be Plenty, All Peace and Benevolence throughout the Globe. The Number of Inhabitants, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being a Burden, would then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Riches of every Climate. All Hands would be ſet to Work, when thus aſſured of a Purchaſer for every Effect of Labour. The Buzz of Wheels, Reels, and Looms; the Sound of Hammers, Files, and Forges; with the Shouts of Vintage, and the Songs of Harveſt, would be heared in all Lands! I am quite aſtoniſhed that a Work, ſo full of Benefit and Bleſſing to the Univerſe of Man, is not already commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, advanced, and compleated.</p>
            <p>How comes this to paſs, Mr. <hi>Meekly?</hi> Have You yet mentioned this Matter to Any of our Great Ones?</p>
            <p>I have, my Lord, to Several. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed themſelves convinced of the Utility of the Scheme; and, could Each of them be aſſured of engroſſing to himſelf the moſt conſiderable Part of the Profits that would thereby accrue to the Public, the Work would inſtantly be begun, and would ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perfected. For, ſuch is the Nature of unregenerate Man, that he grudges to Others any Portion of thoſe Goods which he ſo eagerly craves and grapples after for himſelf. He would hedge in the Air, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0237300105:47"/>make a Property of the Light. In Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as he ſees his Neighbours in compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Want, he exults in the Accumulation of imaginary Wealth. But, ſhould he deem them, in a Meaſure, more proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than himſelf, he ſighs at his inmoſt Soul, and grows wretched and repining.</p>
            <p>I proteſt, cried the Earl, were I young, I would to Morrow Morning, at my own Coſt, ſet about this great Work of national, or rather of univerſal Beneficence. But, my <hi>Harry</hi> here has Youth enough, with an Abundance of Benevolence alſo for the Purpoſe; and I recommend it to him as the greateſt of Charities, a Charity to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> a Charity to Mankind. What would you think, my Lord, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> of my expending your whole Drawer of Gold upon this Buſineſs? great as it is, it would be but a ſmall Matter toward the Value of purchaſing Peace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, and the Sons of Peace, upon Earth, will be likelieſt to be the Sons of Love in Heaven. So that we cannot lay out our Money to better Advantage, in any Purchaſe for the Benefit of the Brothers of our own Frailty.</p>
            <p>Alas, my Love, rejoined Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> though you were Maſter of Half the Wealth of the People of <hi>England,</hi> and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0237300105:48"/>were willing to employ the Whole for their Emolument in this Way, the People them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would oppoſe you in every Step you ſhould take.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0237300105:49"/>interrupt You. Pray proceed in your Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.</p>
            <p>On my Return to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> from my Tour through the Seven Provinces, I grew affected, one Evening, in a Manner I had never before experienced. I did not feel myſelf any way ſick or in pain, and yet I wiſhed to exchange my Senſations for any other Species of Malady. I was wholly pervaded by a gloomy Deſpondence. I looked abroad for Comfort, but it was no where to be found, every Object gave Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt to my diſcontented Imagination. I ſecretly enquired of my Soul, if Riches, Honours, Dignities, if the Empire of the World would reſtore her to Joy? But She turned from them and ſaid, All theſe Things are Strangers, and Aliens to my Peace. Alas, ſaid I, tell me then where your Peace may be found? I know not, ſhe replied, but I feel that I am wretched.</p>
            <p>For three Days I continued under this Oppreſſion of Spirit. And on the third Night an increaſing Horror, of deep and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0237300105:50"/>heavy Darkneſs, fell upon me. All Hope died within me, and Miſery ſeemed to open a Gulph of ever deepening Deſtruction in my Soul. I lay all the Night, bathed in Drops of unutterable Anguiſh. I wiſhed and ſtruggled to ariſe and change my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, but I felt that my Mind was its own Place and its own Hell, from whence there was no Removal, no poſſible Eſcape.</p>
            <p>I now concluded that, ſome how, I muſt have ſinned beyond the Meaſure of all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſince my Damnation was deeper than that of any Other. I therefore turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God and wiſhed to repent; but, as I did not feel Conviction for the Sins of which I accuſed myſelf, no Place for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance was found in my Soul.</p>
            <p>Tremendous Author! I cried, I find that thou can'ſt ſink and ſlay at Pleaſure, but can'ſt thou not alſo raiſe up and make alive? If all Things have their Exiſtence in thee, O God! is it not near and eaſy unto thee to impart to us ſome Senſation of thine own Exiſtence alſo? ſome Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thine own Peace, the Senſe that it is thou alone who can'ſt be our Suſtainer? Save me, <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſave me from the Hell of mine own Nature! Save me, thou Son of <hi>David,</hi> O ſave me from Myſelf!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0237300105:51"/>
While I thus prayed in an Agony, my whole Frame was ſuddenly overpower'd and ſunk, as I ſuppoſe, into a State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility, till the following Day was far advanced. At length I perceived that I ſtill exiſted.</p>
            <p>I dreamed that I found myſelf in a deep and noyſome Dungeon, without a ſingle Ray that might even ſuffice to ſhew me the Horrors of my Situation. I attempted to riſe and grope about, but I perceived that I was tied and faſtened down to Earth by a Number and Variety of Bands and Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>At length a ſudden Light appeared, and diffuſed itſelf throughout the Darkneſs of my Manſion. When, looking up, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the Keeper of my Priſon had entered, the Doors being yet locked. His Head, as I thought, was bound about with a Tiara, from whence the Glory aroſe that ſhone around me. In the Coronet, inſtead of Gems, were inſerted a Number of Thorns, whoſe Points ſtreamed with inceſſant and inſufferable Brightneſs. And on the golden Circlet was engraved, in all Languages, JESUS OF NAZARETH KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
            <p>Immediately my Shackles looſened and fell away of themſelves, and I wiſhed to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0237300105:52"/>caſt my whole Exiſtence under the Feet of my Lord, but was ſo overcome with Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy that I could not riſe. When, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon me with a Smile of ineffable Graciouſneſs, he approached and took me by the Hand, and, at the Contact, I ſprung up a great Height in my Bed, and awoke to Senſations of indeſcribable Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>You are come then, my Lord, my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, you are come, my Maſter! I cried; and I will cling inſeparably to you, never, O, never more will I ſuffer you to depart. Ah, I have felt, ſeverely felt what it is to be without you. For, in your Abſence, though but for a Moment, lies the Eſſence of Hell and Miſery; but, in your Preſence, my Beloved, in your Preſence is Peace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, and Joy for ever more!</p>
            <p>From that Day, my Nature became, as it were, wholly inverted. All the Honours and worldly Reſpects, for which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly riſqued my Life, were now my Averſion, and I turned from carnal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence and Senſuality with Loathing.</p>
            <p>Nothing could now affront, nothing could now offend me. As I totally deſpiſed myſelf, ſo I wiſhed, after the Proceſs of my divine Maſter, to be deſpiſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of Men. This made all others, the very meaneſt of human Creatures, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0237300105:53"/>unto me. Even in Reprobates, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, I diſcerned ſome uneraſed Traces of the Image and Superſcription of my God, and I bowed down before it.</p>
            <p>If Any attempted to injure, or defraud me of my Property, I yielded it without Variance, and thereby I found myſelf cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially enriched.</p>
            <p>I grew weary of my own Will and of my own Liberty, and I earneſtly prayed my Lord that he would rid me of them, and be, inſtead thereof, a controuling Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within me, ever influencing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting me according to his own Pleaſure. Turn me, <hi>Jeſus</hi> Maſter! O turn me, I cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from all the evil Propenſities of my own evil Nature, though thou ſhou'dſt turn me, as thou didſt <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> with thy ruling Rein on my Neck, thy Bridle in my Mouth, and thy Hook in my Noſe! Take my Heart and Affections captive, and into thine own divine Guidance! compel me into all the Ways and all the Works of thy Commandments; till thy Yoke ſhall become eaſy and thy Burden light and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome; till I ſhall move, as down a Deſcent, wherever thy Goodneſs would guide me; till I ſhall feelingly find and know that all thy Ways are Ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all thy Paths the Paths of Peace!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0237300105:54"/>
This, my Lord, may look ſomewhat like Boaſting, but it boaſteth of Nought, excepting <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified, or rather ariſen in me, whereby all worldly Matters are crucified unto me.</p>
            <p>Within about a Fortnight after my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, I received a Letter from a Friend in <hi>London,</hi> informing me that my old Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle had ſecretly married a young Creature, who was lately delivered of a Son. That he now openly acknowledged her for his Wife; and that this, as he feared, did not bode me any Good.</p>
            <p>At another Time, theſe Tidings would have greatly alarmed me; but I was now equally reſigned and indifferent to all Events.</p>
            <p>In a few Days after, as I was ſtepping out of my Lodgings, I was arreſted in the Name, and at the Suit of my Uncle, for £.700, the preciſe Sum for which I had drawn upon him about nine Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. All the Conſequences of this Caption immediately occurred to me. I perceived that my Uncle intended to deprive me of my Patrimony, in Favour of his new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; and, as I had no Means for oppoſing his Machinations, ſave what lay in his own
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0237300105:55"/>Hands, I concluded that a Jail was to be my Portion for Life. Wherefore, I lifted up my Heart and ſaid, within myſelf, to Priſons and to Death give me chearfully to follow thee, O thou who, in Death, art the Life and Reſurrection!</p>
            <p>My Spirit had no ſooner uttered this ſhort Ejaculation, than I felt ſuch a Weight of Peace deſcending upon me, that my Heart leaped within me at the Proſpect of Suffering, and I would not have exchanged my Priſon for a Throne.</p>
            <p>While I quietly walked with the Officers toward the Place of my Durance, they came to a great Tavern, where they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and propoſed to regale themſelves at my Expence.</p>
            <p>Mean time, a <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant of great Eminence, happened to be, with his Lady, in the principal Room, and, hearing a Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the Houſe, he enquired the Cauſe, and ſent for the chief Bailiff.</p>
            <p>Soon after, I was conducted into their Preſence. They Both roſe as I entered; and the Gentleman, approaching, took me familiarly by the Hand and ſaid in <hi>Dutch,</hi> Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> I hear You are in Diſtreſs, and that is ſufficient to recommend you to my Services; but your Appearance exacts
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0237300105:56"/>Something more from my Inclinations. Pray let me know wherein, and how far it may be requiſite for you to command me.</p>
            <p>I muttered Somewhat, as I ſuppoſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>articulately toward an Anſwer. For I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, my Lord, I was ſo ſtruck, ſo awed, ſo confounded, by his Preſence, that I was loſt, for the Time, to the Conſideration of my own Affairs. Mean while he placed me at Table juſt oppoſite to the heavenly Viſion of his Bride, and then went and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed his Seat beſide her; while I, gazing in Silence and utmoſt Wonder, recollected thoſe Lines of <hi>Milton</hi> where, ſpeaking of Adam and Eve, he calls them
<q>
                  <l>"the lovelieſt Pair</l>
                  <l>"That ever ſince in Love's Embraces met;</l>
                  <l>"<hi>Adam,</hi> the goodlieſt Man of Men ſince born</l>
                  <l>"His Sons, the faireſt of her Daughters, <hi>Eve."</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Gentleman perceived my Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and graciouſly ſmiling, again aſked me what Sum was requiſite to extricate me from my preſent Difficulty. Ah, Sir, ſaid I, it is a Sum that far exceeds all human Bounty, and, indeed, I would not accept the Obligation from any Man, unleſs I were aſſured of being ſhortly in a Capacity to reimburſe him, of which I ſee no Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, I think no Poſſibility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0237300105:57"/>
Here I told him, in few Words, how my Father had left me an Infant at the Diſpoſal of my Uncle, who had now put me under Arreſt for £.700, which, ſome time ſince, he had freely remitted to me, as in my own Right.</p>
            <p>I ſee, ſaid the Gentleman, your Uncle is a Villain, and means, by caſting You in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Priſon, in a ſtrange and diſtant Place, to deprive you of the Power of bringing him to Account. But he muſt be detected, it is a Juſtice which you owe to the Public, as well as yourſelf. And, as the Amount of the pretended Debt is not ſufficient for that Purpoſe, here is an Order on the Bank in Town for double the Sum. For this you muſt give me your Note of Hand. Be pleaſed to reimburſe me when it is your Convenience. If that ſhould never happen, be under no Concern; for I hold myſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready repaid with Uſury, in the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſerving an injured and a worthy Man.</p>
            <p>O Sir, I cried, I cannot, indeed I cannot, I will not accept it on any Account. I am patient, nay I am pleaſed with the Lot that is appointed me. Shall I, in an Inſtant, break the Yoke and caſt the Burden which my gracious Maſter, but this Inſtant, has
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0237300105:58"/>laid upon me? No, Sir, I ſubmit myſelf to it with Thankfulneſs; I take his Croſs to my Boſom and preſs it to my Heart.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Meekly,</hi> ſaid he, you are a very miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Chriſtian, if you think yourſelf entitled either to aſſume or retain your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Croſſes at will. There is too much of Self-Righteouſneſs, in ſuch a Zeal, <hi>Meekly.</hi> Humility would rather bid the Will of our Maſter to be done; and he offers you Enfranchiſement by my Hand. Do, my dear Sir, cried the Angel beſide him, do, let me petition, let me perſuade you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this little Inſtance of our good Will to ſo good a Creature. Though my Lord here has not been able to prevail, a Lady has ſuperior Claims, and I muſt not be refuſed.</p>
            <p>Quite ſunk, quite overwhelmed, I drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped involuntarily on my Knees before them. Bleſſed Pair, I exclaimed, bleſſed and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous beyond Expreſſion; if Angels are like You, what Happineſs muſt be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! I could no more, my Words were choaked by my riſing Emotions.</p>
            <p>My Benefactor then roſe, and coming tenderly toward me, he took me warmly in his Arms. My <hi>Meekly,</hi> ſays he, do not oppreſs me, I pray you, by this Exceſs of Acknowledgment; I am but a worthleſs
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0237300105:59"/>Inſtrument in the Hands of your Beloved; for from him, and him alone, is every good Gift, and even the Will of the Giver. O, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> added the Lady, her Eyes glittering through Water, we thank you, we cordially thank you, Mr. <hi>Meekly;</hi> you have occaſioned us much Pleaſure this Day, I aſſure you; and the Means of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs ſhould be delightful in our Eyes.</p>
            <p>My Patron then rung a Bell, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his principal Gentleman into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; when, putting the Order into his Hand, here, ſays he, take this, with the Bailiff, directly to the Bank; there pay him his Demand of £.700 and Fees; and bring me a hundred Pounds in Caſh, and the Remainder in Bills on <hi>London.</hi> Then, calling for Pen and Ink, he drew the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſhort Note, <q>I owe You fourteen hundred Pounds.</q> To which I ſigned <hi>Charles Meekly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Return of the Meſſenger, I was put in Poſſeſſion of the Caſh and Bills, and a Dinner of little Elegancies was ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up.</p>
            <p>After a ſhort Repaſt, the Decanters and Glaſſes being placed, and the Attendants diſmiſſed, my two Patrons gave a looſe to ſocial Joy, and invited me to be a Partaker
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0237300105:60"/>in their Feſtivity. Never was I, nor ever ſhall I again, be witneſs to ſuch Flights of Fancy, ſuch a ſpontaneous Fluency of Heart-ſpringing Glee! with what Pleaſure did Erudition caſt off its formal Garb! how delightingly did Wiſdom aſſume the Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and, at Times, the very Phraſe of Childhood! they laughed, they rallied me, themſelves, and the World. Their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment was as the Breaking forth and Exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance of overflowing Innocence and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Conceive to yourſelf, my Lord, a large Room ſurrounded with Benches, whereon are ſeated the principal Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Literati, Lawyers, Stateſmen, chief Captains, and chief Conquerors in all Ages; then think you behold two ſportively ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant Children in the Midſt, looking and laughing at the Inſignificance of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sages; taking off and holding up the Solemnity and Self-importance of each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in Charicature; and ſetting the whole World, with all its Wiſdom, its Toils, and boaſted Acquirements, its So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitudes, Applications, and Atchievements at nought.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman, indeed, pretended, and only pretended, to defend the Sophiſts, the Valiant, and the Renowned of his Sex; but he evidently exulted in his own Defeat; while the Lady, with a Drollery amazingly
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0237300105:61"/>valuble, ran through the Schools of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, the Syſtems of human Policy, and Hiſtories of Heroiſm, unpluming the Creſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bringing the Lofty low, and depreciat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reducing all Magnitude to Minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And all this She did with an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch pleaſant Meaning; with ſuch Looks, Eyes, and Attitudes of bewitching Tranſition, as would have infuſed Faſcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into old Age and Uglineſs; what then muſt it have done when accompanied by a Beauty that ſcarce ever was equalled, that could not be exceeded? Did the <hi>Sarah</hi> of the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> reſemble her, I wonder not that Nations ſhould have been enamoured of her at the Age of Fourſcore.</p>
            <p>At length, the enraptured Huſband; no longer able to contain, bent toward her with Looks of Soul-darting Delight, and, reſtraining his Arms that would have cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to his Boſom, O, my <hi>Louiſa,</hi> he cried, You are too much, too pearly, too precious a Treaſure for me! But, giving him a ſweetly petulant Pat on the Cheek, away, you Rogue, ſhe ſaid, I'll none of your Mockeries!</p>
            <p>What can Expreſſion add further to this divinely preeminent of human Creatures? whatever was her preſent Glance, Aſpect, or Poſture, you would have wiſhed to fix her in it, that you might gaze and admire
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0237300105:62"/>for ever. But, when ſhe varied the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment of her Action and Attitude, you forgot the former Attractions; and She became as it were a Newneſs of ever riſing Delight!</p>
            <p>Alas, how tranſient, how momentary was the Bliſs I then enjoyed! A Chariot and ſix pied Horſes drove up to the Door, attended by a Retinue of ten or twelve Men, All armed, gallantly mounted, and in rich Apparel.</p>
            <p>My dear <hi>Meekly,</hi> mournfully ſaid my Benefactor, I am ſorry that we are deſtined to different Departments. Hodge to night at a Villa belonging to one of my Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondents, and To-morrow we ſet out to viſit ſome of the <hi>German</hi> Courts. Fare, fare you well, <hi>Meekly,</hi> for a ſhort Seaſon at leaſt!</p>
            <p>I would have eaſt myſelf at his Feet. It was an Emotion, a Propenſity which I could not reſiſt; but he prevented me, by kiſſing and caſting his Arms affectionately about me. The Lady then turned to me, and, with a Smile of Heart-captivating Graciouſneſs, God be with You, God be with You, my good Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> ſhe cried, perhaps we may meet ere long in your own <hi>England.</hi> I anſwered not, but bending on
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0237300105:63"/>one Knee, I caught her Hand, preſſed it fervently to my Lips, and permitted her to depart.</p>
            <p>Alas, they did depart. I ſaw them for the laſt Time. They mounted their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and being ſeated, they bent forward, and, bowing to me with a fix'd Regard, off they drove, and tore away with them, as I thought, the beſt Part of my Soul.</p>
            <p>I followed them with ſtraining Eyes: when out of ſight, methought I held them ſtill in view; and I bleſſed and kiſſed, in Imagination, the very Ground over which they went. At length I awoke from my Delirium, and with ſlow and heavy Steps turned back into the Houſe.</p>
            <p>I had not yet, through Shame, ſo much as enquired the Name of my Benefactor. I therefore called to my Hoſt, in order to inform myſelf of all that I could learn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him; as alſo to make out a Bill, for it had not been called for, and I pleaſed myſelf with the Thought of diſcharging a Reckoning that my Friends had forgotten. When I queſtioned my Hoſt on this Head, he put his Hands to his Sides and broke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a violent Fit of Laughter; no, no, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaid he, there's nothing for any One to pay in this Houſe, I aſſure You; Myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heer never troubles himſelf about thoſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0237300105:64"/>Matters, his Major Domo pays all, ay, and for every Gueſt too that happens to be in the ſame Inn with his Maſter.</p>
            <p>Why pray, ſaid I, is he a Lord? A Lord, quotha? not ſo little as that comes to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; no Sir, he is a Prince, the very Prince of our Merchants, and our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are Princes above all Lords. And pray how do they ſtile or call him? He has many Names and Titles, when our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſpeak of him, they call him Mynheer <hi>Van Glunthong,</hi> but Others ſtile him my Lord of Merchants, and Others my Lord the Brother-Man, and my Lord the Friend of the Poor.</p>
            <p>The Remainder of my Story is very ſhort, and ſtill more inſignificant. I ſoon ſet out for <hi>England,</hi> in order to file a Bill againſt my Uncle, and compel him to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what Patrimony my Father had left me. But God was pleaſed, in the mean Space, to cut off all Debate; his Wife and Child had died of an epidemic Diſtemper, and he did not ſurvive them above a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. He left me a penitential Letter, with a ſmall Will encloſed, whereby I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came entitled to three hundred a Year in right of my Father, and an additional four Hundred in right of my Uncle, with a Sum of near three thouſand Pounds in ready Money.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0237300105:65"/>
If I know my own Heart, the only Cauſe of rejoicing, that I felt on that Occaſion, was that it put it in my Power to diſcharge my Pecuniary Obligations to my late gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Preſerver. I immediately wrote and tranſmitted Bills to <hi>Holland</hi> for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but the Bills were returned, and I could hear no Tidings concerning the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my Patron. I then put out his £.1400 on the beſt Securities that I could procure. It is now cloſe upon five and thirty Years ſince I ſaw him; and, in that Time, the Principal, with Intereſt upon Intereſt, yearly turned into Capital, has amounted to nearly five thouſand Pounds, one Penny of which I never touch, but hold the Whole as ſacred.</p>
            <p>Mean Time, it has coſt me Hundreds upon Hundreds in Correſpondencies, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements, and even in ſpecial Meſſengers to ſeveral Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> to diſcover where this Greateſt, this moſt eminent of Men could have concealed himſelf; but alas, my Search proved as fruitleſs as that of the Miſer in hunting after the Pearl of mighty Price!</p>
            <p>During thoſe five and thirty Years, the Image of the Perſons of thoſe my two gracious Patrons never left my Memory, were ever at my Heart. Ah, I would ſay
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0237300105:66"/>to myſelf, they are dead, they are dead; or rapt, perhaps, like <hi>Ebjah</hi> alive into Heaven; Fleſh and Blood, reſmed as theirs, might eaſily paſs from its little Impurities, through the Fire of the Love of God, to the Place of its Bliſs. And again it was my daily and ardent Petition, that, if their Mortal was not yet ſwallowed up of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, I might once ſet my Eyes upon them before I died.</p>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> ended. — I thank you, my dear Friend, ſaid the Earl, for your Hiſtory; it has entertained me moſt pleaſingly, and I have alſo been highly edified by ſome Paſſages in it. But, with Reſpect to the Glimpſe that you had of your two wonderful Friends, I think it muſt have been a Viſion, or merely a Matter of Imagination; for, I never ſaw in Nature, nor read in Fiction of any thing comparable to the Excellencies that you have deſcribed in that exalted Pair. If it was a Viſion, my Lord, it muſt have been one of bleſſed Angels indeed; but I hope you will allow that the Benefits, which they conferred, were no way viſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. O, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> ſaid <hi>Harry</hi> with a Sigh, the Picture, that you have drawn of that dear Lady, has almoſt given me a Diſtaſte to all the reſt of her Sex. Ah, might I meet hereafter ſome Daughter,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0237300105:67"/>ſome Deſcendent, ſome diſtant Likeneſs of her, how happy ſhould I think myſelf! May Heaven ſucceed your ominous Wiſh, my deareſt Child, cried <hi>Meekly!</hi> It is juſt, perhaps prophetic that it ſhould be ſo. For, never did I ſee ſo perfect a Reſemblance between any two Creatures, as between the Conſort of that bewitching Woman and yourſelf; it ſtruck me, the other Night, the Moment you enter'd the Room; and I thought that I beheld my very Benefactor newly ariſen, like a young <hi>Phoenix,</hi> from the Aſhes of old Age.</p>
            <p>Near a Fortnight more elapſed, without any News or Notice from Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> or from the Meſſenger who was ſent diſpatch for him. <hi>Harry</hi> daily advanced in the Favour and Familiarity of his Father. And Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> continued with them in a moſt pleaſing Society.</p>
            <p>On a fine Morning, as they were walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together toward the Village, this is the firſt Time, my <hi>Harry,</hi> ſaid the Earl with a Sigh, that I have ventured to turn my Face this Way, ſince the Death of my Wife and the Interment of your dear Brother. O my Lord, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> I would gladly exchange my Lot in Life with the meaneſt of yonder Cottagers, who earns his daily Bred by the Labour of his Hands, provided I might thereby reſtore
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0237300105:68"/>them Both to your Boſom. Not ſo, not ſo, my Son, fervently replied the Earl, I would not loſe my <hi>Harry,</hi> tho' I were thereby to reſuſcitate All that are dead in <hi>England!</hi> I have no Cauſe, no Manner of Right to complain; I am ſtill happy, wonderfully happy, too happy in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of ſuch a Child!</p>
            <p>Juſt then, a great Shouting and Uproar was heard in the Village. The huge Maſtiff, belonging to <hi>Peregrine Pelt</hi> the Tanner, had run mad, and came foaming up the Road, purſued by thirty of the Townſmen, armed with Staves, Spits, and Pitchforks. The Dog ruſhed on at ſuch a Rate, that there was no Poſſibility for our Company to eſcape him; and <hi>Harry,</hi> obſerving that he made directly toward his Father, threw himſelf full in his Way. Inſtantly the envenomed Monſter ſprung up and caſt himſelf open Mouth upon our Hero; but <hi>Harry,</hi> with a wonderful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mind, having wrapped his left Arm in the Skirt of his Coat daſhed it into the frothing Jaws of the terrible Animal, when, giving a Trip, at the ſame Time, to his hinder Legs, he threw him flat on the Ground, and, ſpringing up into the the Air, he deſcended upon him with all the Force of his Heels, and daſhed his Bowels to Pieces; whereupon the Creature
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0237300105:69"/>uttered a faint Howl, ſprawled awhile, and expired.</p>
            <p>The Earl and Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> ſtood, yet a while, pale, aſtoniſhed, and unaſſured; and my Lord, looking about in a Pannic, cried, where is the Dog, what's become of the mad Dog? In the mean time the Villagers came on in full Purſuit, crying out, the mad Dog, the mad Dog, take Care of the mad Dog! But, when they All arrived, and beheld their huge Enemy looking formidable even in Death, never was Amazement equal to theirs. They ſtared at the Earl, <hi>Meekly,</hi> and <hi>Harry,</hi> in Turns; and ſeeing no Weapon in any of their Hands; God, cried Goodman <hi>Demſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> God has been wonderfully gracious in your Deliverence, my Lord; for nothing leſs than a Thunderbolt could ſo ſuddenly have ſtricken this Monſter dead. I proteſt, ſaid the Earl, I was ſo much alarmed that I know not how it happened; I remember nothing further than that my dear Child here thruſt himſelf between his Father and Danger. But I beheld, ſaid <hi>Meekly,</hi> when, with one Stroke of his Arm, he daſhed the Creature to the Ground, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly cruſhed him to death with his Feet. Not I, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> modeſtly replied <hi>Harry,</hi> God gave me Strength, for the Seaſon, in Defence of my Father. But are you not bit, are you not hurt, my Child, cried
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0237300105:70"/>the Earl, coming up tremblingly to his Son? Not touched, indeed, my Lord. Glory for that in the Higheſt, exultingly cried the Earl!</p>
            <p>I knew, exclaimed <hi>Tom Truck,</hi> with a Shout and Look of Triumph, I knew it could be no Other but my brave and noble young Maſter who did the Feat. On my Life, cried Farmer <hi>Felſter,</hi> he is able, with his naked Arm, like another young <hi>David,</hi> to ſave his Lambs from the Jaws of the Lion and the Paws of the Bear.</p>
            <p>Though theſe Praiſes ſerved only to put our Hero to Confuſion, they went trickling, like Balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> to the Heart of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Pelt,</hi> ſaid the Earl, let it be your Taſk to flea and tan me the Hide of your own Dog. I will have his Skin ſtuffed with Incenſe, and his Nails of ſolid Gold; and he ſhall hang up in my Hall, from Generation to Generation, to commemorate the Piety and Proweſs of my Son! Mean while, my good Friends, I invite you All, with your Families, Kinsfolk, and Neighbours, to come and feaſt with me this Day. Sorrow hath endured her Night; but Joy cometh, with my Child, and ariſeth on us as a new Morning!</p>
            <p>In the Afternoon, all the Towns-Folk and Neighbours, with their Wives and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0237300105:71"/>Children, convened to the great Houſe, having their Cattle and themſelves heavy laden with Faggots, for a magnificent Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination. The whole Court was ſpread with Tables, and the Tables with Victuals and Liquors; beſide two Hogſheads of <hi>October</hi> that ſtood apart.</p>
            <p>The Earl, in the Joy for his own Eſcape, and the recent Proweſs of his young Hero, went forth with a chearful Countenance and graciouſly welcomed all his Gueſts; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, they wiſhed Health and long Life to his Lordſhip and their young Lord, and, giving a joint Huzza, ſat down to their Banquet. From whence, after a Night far ſpent in Carouſal, their great Fire being out, and their great Hogſheads exhauſted, they peacefully helped Each-Other to their reſpective Homes; regretting, however, that they had not been honoured with the Preſence of their young Maſter among them. For <hi>Harry</hi> had beſought his Father to diſpenſe with him, yet awhile, from partaking in any Party or Scene of Feſtivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eſpecially when appointed in his own Honour; and Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> highly approved and applauded his Motion.</p>
            <p>On the Eve of the following Day, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> rode abroad on a charitable Viſit to a dying Man in the Neighbourhood; and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0237300105:72"/>my Lord was fondly toying and patting the Cheek of his Darling, as they ſtood at the Hall Door; when <hi>Harry</hi> ſpied a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coach turning up the lower End of the great Avenue, and inſtantly cried out, there's my Uncle, my Lord, my Uncle, my deareſt Uncle! and off he ſhot like Lightning. The Coach drove but ſlowly, <hi>Harry</hi> was up with it in a Twinkling, and vaulting in at the Window, was, in the Inſtant, in the Boſom of his beſt Friend and Patron.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Earl had retired into the Houſe in great Agitation. He feared and was jealous of the Manner in which his Brother would meet him; and this gave him equal Doubt and Heſitation reſpecting the Manner in which he ought to receive his Brother. Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> on the other Hand, was not wholly without ſome ſimilary Emotions; ſo that, when <hi>Harry</hi> introduced his Uncle into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, no two noble Perſonages could ſalute Each other with a more diſtant Reſpect.</p>
            <p>The Earl, however, on caſting a Glance upon the Face of his Brother, felt a Tide of returning Affection, and lifting up his Hands and Eyes, exclaimed, it is he, it is he! my <hi>Harry,</hi> my <hi>Harry Clinton!</hi> my dear, my long loſt, my long ſought Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! then haſtened forward, in a Guſh of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0237300105:73"/>Paſſion, and caught him in his eager Arms. When Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> alternately folding the Earl to his Boſom, cried, I am content, O my God! give me now to depart in Peace, ſince at laſt, I find, and feel that I have indeed a Brother!</p>
            <p>Our Hero, obſerving the Violence of their Emotion, interpoſed with a gentle Care, and ſupporting them to Seats, placed them tenderly by each other.</p>
            <p>For a while they Both ſat ſilent, with a Handkerchief at their Eyes; till the Earl turned, and plaintively ſaid, you don't for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, <hi>Harry Clinton;</hi> you never will, you never can forgive me, my Brother! Whereupon, Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> caught up the Earl's Hand to his Lips, and, preſſing it with a fervent Reſpect, cried, my Brother and my Lord, my Brother and my Lord!</p>
            <p>O then, ſaid the Earl, you do forgive me, I find; but, never can I, never will I forgive myſelf. My Faults toward you, my nobleſt Brother, for theſe many long Years have been ever before me; my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects, my Pride and Inſolence, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous Treatment of One, ſo highly my Superior; of my <hi>Harry,</hi> the only Boaſt and Glory of our Houſe!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0237300105:74"/>
Mean while, our Hero ſtood aloof with his Head averted, weeping and ſobbing with evident Agitation. Till Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> cried, no more, my Brother, no more, I beſeech you! It is already too much; I cannot bear my preſent Exceſs of grateful Affection for you; it ſtruggles to ruſh forth, but Utterance is not given. Beſide, we ſhall break the Heart of our dear Child there; his Nature is too tender to ſupport ſuch a Scene as this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then ſmilingly turned his Face, toward his Parents, all ſhining through Tears, as the Sun in a Shower. And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, and kneeling before them, as they ſat; he took the Hands of Each, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately, and preſſed them in Silence to his Lips.</p>
            <p>In about an Hour after, while their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were ſtill at the higheſt, but their Spirits ſomewhat compoſed, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> returned. The Earl immediately roſe, and advancing, took him by the Hand with a cordial Familiarity. Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> ſays he, I ſhall now have the Pleaſure of introducing you to that ineſtimable Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of whom you have heard me ſpeak ſo often; Brother, this is Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> my beſt and worthieſt Friend!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0237300105:75"/>
Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> roſe and advanced; and <hi>Meekly</hi> approached with an abaſed Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, not venturing to look up, but ſaluted him, as he would have ſaluted an Angel of Light!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meekly, Meekly,</hi> cried Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> I have ſurely heard that Name before! Pray, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> were you ever abroad? have you travelled, Sir? were you ever in <hi>Holland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Meekly?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, <hi>Meekly</hi> ſtarted, as awaked by the Sound of a Voice, whoſe recollected Tune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings went thrilling to his Heart; and lifting up his Eyes, and beholding the Traces of Features, once ſo lovely, and ever deeply endeared to his Memory; he ſtarted, and ſtaggering back ſome Steps, he ſunk down on a Chair behind him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in a fainting Fit.</p>
            <p>The Earl, greatly alarmed, went up, and taking him by the Hand, what is the Matter, my Friend, ſays he? are you taken ſuddenly ill, are you not well, my <hi>Meekly?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O, my Lord — he pantingly cried — there he is — as ſure as I live — my Patron — my Benefactor — the wondrous Man that I told you of — there
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0237300105:76"/>he ſtands, in his own precious Perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us!</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> then approached, and, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Seat beſide him, leaned toward him with a melting Complacence. Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> ſaid he, I expected ere this to have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced you in Heaven; but I rejoice to meet you even on Earth; for I have ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a very affectionate Impreſſion of you; and I more eſpecially rejoice to meet you in the preſent Society.</p>
            <p>But then — but then you come alone — you come alone, my Lord and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! — Alas, you wipe your Eye! — O then, it muſt be ſo! — And here he broke into a paſſionate Guſh of Tears.</p>
            <p>My Lord and our Hero, hereupon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting the engaging Circumſtances of a Character, on whoſe Deſcription they had been ſo lately enamoured, could not refuſe their Tribute to the Memory of that admirable Lady, to whoſe Perſon they now found themſelves endearingly attached by Affinity.</p>
            <p>At length Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> diſtreſſed to the laſt Degree for the Diſtreſs in which he ſaw the forlorn <hi>Meekly,</hi> ſweetly turned from his own Affliction to the Conſoling of that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0237300105:77"/>Friend whom he found ſo deeply afflicted for him.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> ſays he, let us not weep for the Living, but rather for the Dead! for thoſe who are yet in the Vale of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. Shall we mourn the Condition of Angels, ſhall we lament that a Weight of Glory is fallen on thoſe whom we loved? No, let us rather rejoice in the Proſpect of being ſpeedily Partakers!</p>
            <p>When Supper was over, <hi>Harry</hi> laid hold of the firſt Interval of Converſe, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after his Friends in Town, more eſpecially Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> his <hi>Arabella,</hi> and their little <hi>Dicky.</hi> They are come, ſaid Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> to ſudden and great Affluence. Old <hi>Clement</hi> is thoroughly reconciled to his Son, and is doatingly fond of <hi>Arabella</hi> and her Child. I am glad of it with all my Heart, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> clapping his Hands; but pray, how did this Matter come about, Sir? By an Event, my Dear, in which the Arm of Providence was ſignally viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But, before I ſay how it came to paſs, you ought to give our Company a ſhort Hiſtory of this worthy Family, they will then become intereſted in their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0237300105:78"/>
               <hi>Harry,</hi> willingly and gracefully, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Taſk enjoined him; and then his Uncle proceeded.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Day after you leſt me, a Man of a genteel Appearance, but pale and bleeding, was carried, ſtretched on a Door, by ſome of our charitable Townſmen, and brought to my Houſe. I was then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with <hi>Clement</hi> on a Viſit to your old Friend <hi>Vindex;</hi> but the Stranger was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly admitted; and, while ſome of the Servants rode off for a Surgeon, others tenderly undreſſed and put him into a warmed Bed.</p>
            <p>Soon, after I had returned and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of what had paſſed, the Surgeon arrived, and, putting five Guineas in his Hand, I deſired him to attend his Patient and bring me Word of his Eſtate. In Half an Hour he came forth and, ſhaking his Head, ſaid, our Patient, Sir, will not do. He is wounded in the Groin with a Piſtol Bullet. The Ball has got within the Abdomen, my Inſtruments will not reach it, and, if it has entered the Viſcera, he will die of Convulſions in leſs than three Hours. I have accordingly told the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman what I thought of him, and adviſed him immediately to ſettle his worldly Affairs. He tells me his Name is <hi>Saint-Belial,</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0237300105:79"/>and he requeſted me, as ſoon as I reached <hi>London,</hi> to ſend Mr. <hi>Clement</hi> to him, who lives over againſt the blue Poſts on the Strand.</p>
            <p>The Name of <hi>Clement</hi> made me curious to know who the Party was, and, entering his Chamber, I took a Chair and ſat down ſoftly by the Side of his Bed. But, the Moment that I caſt my Eye on his Viſage, I ſhrunk inward at the Shock; for all the Malignity and Horrors of Hell were jointly legible on his Countenance.</p>
            <p>Humanity, however, compelled me to addreſs him. I am ſorry to hear, Sir, ſaid I, that you are not for this World, but I truſt that your Hope looks forward to a better Home. I have no Hope, ſaid he, ſave ſuch as my Faith has been, that, ſince I muſt die, I ſhall die wholly.</p>
            <p>I proteſt, I was ſo ſtunned and diſconcert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Words and Looks of the Man, that I found no Anſwer, and he proceeded.</p>
            <p>As I have no further Concern with this World, I have ſent for an old Gentleman with whom I had ſome Connections, and reſolve to do an Act of Juſtice before I die, the only One that ever I did during my Life-time. For, your Charity, and that of your People, has half frightened me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0237300105:80"/>a Notion, that there may be ſomething of that, which is called Goodneſs, upon Earth; and then how fearful, how tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous muſt my Situation be! Wherefore, as old <hi>Clement</hi> may not arrive in Seaſon, I will, with your Permiſſion, inform you of ſuch Things as concern him. For, as I have nothing to hope, through all Eternity, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I any thing to fear on this Side of it.</p>
            <p>My Father's Name was <hi>Belcher Saint-Belial.</hi> He was an under Retainer to the Law, and raked up a little Fortune by ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long Practices; ſo that he grew ambitious of preferring me, his only Child, to the Bar, and, in that View, ſent me to School, and from School to <hi>Oxford</hi> College. But, I ought to have began my Hiſtory ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier.</p>
            <p>If there are Devils, I ſurely had One be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaw the Light, and was filled with the evil Spirit from my Mother's Womb; inſomuch that my Nurſe died of a Cancer in her Breaſt occaſioned by the envenomed Bites I gave her Nipple, with my toothleſs Gums, while ſhe ſuckled me.</p>
            <p>While an Infant, I took a heart-felt Pleaſure in diſmembering Flies and impale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Worms alive upon Pins; and, when
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0237300105:81"/>at School, I was the Promoter of all Parties for worrying and torturing Cats and Dogs to death. But my principal Amuſement lay in catching and fleaing Frogs, in ſeeing them ſpring about in the Rage of their Pains, and ſo leaving them to periſh in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable Anguiſh.</p>
            <p>As I grew in Stature, I grew alſo in the Strength of my Malignity. Evil became my Good. My Enjoyments lay in the Loſs, Damage, and Detriment of Others. I conceived a Kind of envious Hate againſt Thoſe who had done me a Benefit. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited open Friendſhip with hidden Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence; and I cannot remember that ever I felt a Senſe of any thing that goes by the Name of Gratitude, Humanity or Virtue.</p>
            <p>I uſually carried about me a walking Stick or Cane, in the hollow Part of which an Iron Spike was contained, which I could cauſe to ſpring forth with a Shake of my Arm, and again return to its Caſe, at Pleaſure. With this, as I ſtrolled the Fields, which I often did for the Purpoſe, I ſtabbed the Cattle of the Neighbours in the Belly or Fundament, and chuckled to ſee them leap, and kick, and plunge about in their Agonies. In ſhort, I drew to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Kind of Comfort from a Compariſon with the Miſeries that I inflicted on other Creatures; and, had the Elements been at
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0237300105:82"/>my Controul, nothing but Peſt and Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, Diſtemper and lingering Death ſhould have ariſen and prevailed throughout the State of Nature.</p>
            <p>At the College I got acquainted with one <hi>Clement,</hi> a gentle tempered but weak Lad, of whom I made a Property. And I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon him to turn away ſeveral of his Servants, under Colour of their having ſtollen the Caſh, Books, and other Effects, of which I had ſecretly plunder'd him.</p>
            <p>At length I had private Intelligence that my Father had been pilloried for Forgery and other double handed Dealings; that he had died of the Bruiſes which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on the Execution of his Sentence; and that his Effects had been ſeized by a Variety of Claimants. Wereupon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any Notice of my Father or Family, I made my ſhorteſt way to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> with All that I could borrow or lay a light Hand upon among my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>The firſt Thing I did, at the City, was to wait upon old <hi>Clement,</hi> the Father of my Friend, with a forged Draught upon him for a hundred Pounds; on the Sight of which, he ſo fretted, and exclaimed, and walked about in ſuch Perturbation, that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0237300105:83"/>I greatly feared I had overſhot my Mark. At length, however, he laid me down the Money, but catching up a Book, ſwore that it was the laſt Penny his Son ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him for ſix Months to come.</p>
            <p>He then began to queſtion me touching the Character of the young Gentleman, and, under Colour of praiſing him for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles to which I perceived the old Man had an Averſion, I exaſperated him to ſuch a Degree, that he again ſwore he would hold no further Correſpondence with him, until he ſhould be fully aſſured of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            <p>Having thus effectually cut off all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between my Friend and his Father, I caſt aſide my Fears of being ſuddenly brought to Account for my late Acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I was even ſo daring as to take Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the very next Door, where I got in League with a young Woman of a moſt ſeducing Face and Perſon, but whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligacy of Manners was, artfully, covered by the moſt artleſs Appearance of ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced Innocence that ever graced the feigned Character of any Actreſs, on any Stage.</p>
            <p>She did not attempt, however, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon me, for kindred Minds, like Ours, inſtantly ſaw into Each Other; and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0237300105:84"/>we ſoon concerted a Plan for her marrying Goodman <hi>Clement,</hi> and dividing the Spoils of the old Miſer between us.</p>
            <p>This we eaſily brought about, and never was Man ſo happy, in being ſo impoſed upon, while I ſhared with him in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his Purſe and his Bride.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, as I had promiſed to procure him Intelligence concerning his Son, I produced ſeveral forged Letters from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Correſpondents in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch Accounts of the Galantries and other Extravagancies of young <hi>Clement,</hi> as wholly alienated his Father's Affections from him, and he ſent him a final Note, whereby he diſcarded him from his Fortune for ever.</p>
            <p>About two Years thus paſſed, in the full Enjoyment of All that could glut Fleſh and Blood; though, in order to ingratiate my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the old Man, I appeared to him the moſt frugal and abſtemious of Mankind. But, one Night, while Mrs. <hi>Clement</hi> and I ſat together, indulging ourſelves in the Hope that the good Man had been knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Head, or had fallen dead of an Apoplexy; He was brought to us in a Chair, pale and wounded, and told us that he ſhould have been certainly murdered, had he not, by the moſt wonderful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0237300105:85"/>met with his Son, who bravely knocked down the Robber and happily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him; and that he had given him what Caſh he had about him, with a Note for £. 500, on the Bank.</p>
            <p>All in a Pannic, and thunderſtruck as I was by this News, I yet pretended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate him on the Return of his Son to Duty, but adviſed him to Bed directly for the Recovery of his Health and Spirits.</p>
            <p>The Remainder of the Night, I walked about, agonizing, and racking my Brain for ſome Expedient to divert the inſtant Ruin that impended, when a ſudden Thought ſtarted, or was rather infuſed into me, and, at Dawn of Day, I went to an Agent, who had done ſeveral Jobbs for me, of no very laudable Tendency.</p>
            <p>When I had given him his Leſſon, and put twenty Guineas into his Hand, he haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily went and deſired to ſee Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> on Buſineſs of great Conſequence, when, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his Knees, he confeſſed, with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing Penitence, that he was the Perſon who had wounded him the foregoing Night; that he did not intend to hurt him ſo much, but that young Mr. <hi>Clement</hi> had hired him for the Purpoſe, and lay in wait hard by, in order that he might appear to come in to his Reſcue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0237300105:86"/>
This Tale was ſo feaſible, that the old Man ſwallowed it, as a greedy Fiſh ſwallows the Bait that, at the ſame time, conveys the Barb into his Bowels. He thereupon had me called to him in a Hurry, told me what he had diſcovered, and gave me an Order to ſtop Payment of the £.500, with a haſty Note to be left at the Bank for his Son.</p>
            <p>On the Way, I recollected an Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the public Papers that offered a large Reward for the Caption of one <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella Clement,</hi> who had been guilty of the Murder of the late Lord <hi>Stivers;</hi> and it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly occurred to me that She was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Wife of my quondam Friend and Patron. Wherefore, as ſoon as I had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched my Buſineſs at the Bank, I ran and collected a Number of Conſtables, and waited with them aloof, till I ſaw the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, whom I dreaded and deteſted above Plague and Poiſon, enter and return diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented from the Counting-Houſe. We then dogged him at a Diſtance till we ſaw him ſafe lodged and, following ſoftly up Stairs, we demanded a Woman who ſtood before us for our Priſoner.</p>
            <p>Young <hi>Clement</hi> then, all enraged, exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf with wonderful Action and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity. With one Stroke of a Poker, he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0237300105:87"/>tore off my right Ear and cleft my Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Bone; then drove us All down Stairs, though ſeveral Shot were fired at him.</p>
            <p>What happened to him afterward I knew only from Report, for I lay ill of my Wounds for ſeveral Months together, and on my Recovery, could learn no Tidings concerning him.</p>
            <p>In the mean Space, my continual Fears of his Appearance made my Life extremely miſerable. My Paramour and I had often Thoughts and Conſultations touching the Expediency of making away with the old Gentleman; but it occurred to us that young <hi>Clement</hi> might ſtill be alive and, on the Death of his Father, might bring us to a ſevere Account for his Subſtance.</p>
            <p>At length, about ſix Weeks ago, as I returned from tranſacting an Affair at <hi>St. Albans,</hi> I met, and inſtantly recognized my old Enemy, walking with a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, about a Mile above this Town. Immediately I ſtopped, and, pulling my Hat over my Eyes, pray Gentlemen, ſaid I, am I on the right Road to <hi>London?</hi> for I have travelled far, and fear I may have gone aſtray. You are on the direct Road, ſaid the Lad, but if you chooſe to ſtop ſhort, you
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0237300105:88"/>are heartily welcome to a Lodging with us for the Night. Why, Gentlemen, ſaid I, do you live in yonder Town? We do, ſaid <hi>Clement.</hi> In that Anſwer I had all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence I deſired, and away I ſpurred.</p>
            <p>From that Time, ſcarce a Day paſſed wherein I did not take an Airing on the ſame Road, ſtill expecting and panting to meet my Adverſary. I rode armed with one Caſe of Piſtols before me, and Another in my Pockets; and I determined, though I ſhould meet <hi>Clement</hi> in the Midſt of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men, to ſhoot him directly through the Head, and truſt to the Speed of my Horſe for my Eſcape. But, this Day, as I returned near the farther End of the Town, a white Goat, purſued by a Dog, ruſhed ſuddenly through a Hedge, whereupon my Horſe plunged, and one of the Piſtols that was ready cocked in my Waſtcoat Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket went off, and reduced me to the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which you behold me.</p>
            <p>His laſt Words were ſcarce intelligible. He was ſeized with Convulſions and lay ſpeechleſs near two Hours. At length old <hi>Clement</hi> arrived; his Servants helped him out of his Coach; I met him in the Hall, and led him into the Parlour.</p>
            <p>There, being both ſeated, I ſuccinctly gave him the Heads of <hi>Saint Belial</hi>'s Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0237300105:89"/>When, looking earneſtly at me, you appear, Sir, ſaid he, to be much of the Gentleman, but, if you were an Angel, I would credit nothing againſt the Honeſty of that good Young Man; and leaſt of all to the Prejudice of the dear young Innocent that I have married.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I was ſomewhat piqued at this ſudden Rebuff; but, ſuppreſſing the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency that I had to Reſentment, I wiſh, ſaid I, you had come Time enough to be preſent at the unhappy Man's Confeſſion, but it may yet pleaſe God to open your Eyes to your own Wrongs before he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires.</p>
            <p>So ſaying, I conducted him to the Room where the Wretch lay, to all Appearance, inſenſible. I then recollected an approved Elixir that I had in my Cloſet, and ſending for it, I infuſed a Tea-ſpoon full, Drop by Drop, into his Mouth.</p>
            <p>In a Quarter of an Hour he came perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Senſes, and, turning his languid Eyes toward the old Man, You are come then, ſaid he, to hear my dying Words. — I forged the Note for which you gave me a hundred Pounds — I forged all the Letters that you received to your Son's Prejudice — I was the Father of the Child which the Strumpet, with whom
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0237300105:90"/>you live, brought into the World — She is not your Wife — She is Wife to <hi>Caleb Cable</hi> the Boatſwain, who lives by the Monument. — He has got Hundreds of your Money for keeping Counſel — It was, in truth, your Son who reſcued you from the Hands of the Robber — I forged the Tale, and bribed the Man who deceived you in that Matter — Often, as you lay in Bed, <hi>Moll Cable</hi> has urged me to diſpatch you before Morning — Had I murdered your Son, as I long ſince intended, you ſhould not have ſurvived him four and twenty Hours. —</p>
            <p>Here, turning his eager and ghaſtly Viſage upon me, O Sir, ſaid he, is there, is there, for certain, a Judgment to come? Alas! I anſwered, Death, Judgment, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Hell, are the four capital Things of which the Univerſe affords the higheſt and deepeſt Aſſurance. O, then, he cried, I am going, down! down! down!</p>
            <p>This he ſpoke with all the viſible Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Deſperation, conceivable in <hi>Judas,</hi> when juſt about fixing the Rope to his Neck; and, lapſing into his laſt Agonies, he ſoon after expired.</p>
            <p>All pale and aſtoniſhed, the old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſat ſilent and panting; and, ſeeing he
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0237300105:91"/>was about to faint, I ordered ſome Drops and Water, with a Bottle of Wine, while I ſupported him from falling.</p>
            <p>When he was ſomewhat reſtored, and had recovered his Speech, he laid hold on my Hand and ſaid, I beg your Pardon, Sir, I would do it, if I were able, upon my Knees. But, who could have thought this?—I wiſh that I had indeed been murdered—I would that I had died, before I was thus undeceived in the only Objects of my Love.—Alas, Sir, I have now no Relation, no Kindred, no Friend except yourſelf upon Earth. All Others are equally Plunderers and Murderers in my Eyes.—Theſe Words were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by a Flood of Tears.</p>
            <p>Having conſoled him in the kindeſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I could, Word was brought that Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was ſerved, and I led him, partly by Conſtraint, to the Table; but whiſpered private Orders that <hi>Arabella</hi> and her <hi>Dickey</hi> ſhould not appear, for <hi>Clement</hi> ſtaid to dine with his Friend <hi>Vindex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After Dinner and three Glaſſes, which was all I could force upon him, I remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the Expediency of his immediate Return, to ſecure his Effects; leſt all ſhould be ſpirited away upon any Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the preſent Accident. Ah, Sir, ſaid
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0237300105:92"/>he, I ſhall ſcarce, I fear, be able to bear the Sight of a Place in which I ſo long thought myſelf ſo very happy; but if you will be ſo gracious as to accompany me I will venture. I will, ſaid I, on Condition, that you engage to return and ſleep here this Night.</p>
            <p>Early in the Afternoon we arrived at his Houſe, in my Coach, attended by his two Servants and Four of mine, well arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As we entered the Parlour, his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Wife roſe in an Alarm that ſhe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently endeavoured to ſuppreſs. What is the Matter, Lovee? ſaid ſhe, advancing; for what did <hi>Saint Belial</hi> ſend to you? it became him much better to have attended on You, methinks. I fear my Lovee is ſadly tired. But, pray, what did he want with you? To tell me, anſwered old <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that he was a dying Man, that I was a Dupe and a Cuckold, and that you were a Strumpet.</p>
            <p>O fye, Lovee, ſaid ſhe, thoſe are very naughty Names; but you cannot be in earneſt.</p>
            <p>Step, ſaid he, and enquire of <hi>Caleb Cable</hi> the Boatſwain; tell him, at the ſame time, that I cannot afford to maintain his Wife any longer, and that he has ſeen the very laſt of his huſh Money. Ah, <hi>Polly, Polly,</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0237300105:93"/>he continued, meltingly, all this I could almoſt away with; but Murder is a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thing; who could think that my <hi>Polly</hi> would murder her old Man?</p>
            <p>O then, ſhe cried, I ſee that the Villain has betray'd me. I ſee that I'm undone. My Youth and Beauty caſt away, my Arts and Time ſpent in vain! Why, you doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, driveling Wretch, your Fortune was little enough to compenſate the Pains I took in diſguiſing my Averſion to you. But, you ſhall not live to triumph in my Diſappointment.</p>
            <p>So ſaying, ſhe ſprung forward and, graſping his Neck in both her Hands, he inſtantly grew black in the Face, his Eyes rolled, his Jaws expanded, and he muſt have expired on the Spot. But I ſtepped haſtily to her and, ſeizing both her Wriſts, I gave them a ſudden Wrench, whereupon ſhe looſed her Hold, ſhouting out that her Arms were broke, and throwing herſelf, groaning, into a Chair, ſhe called for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Perdition on me, the crazy Dotard, herſelf, and all the World.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the old Gentleman had ſunk panting to the Floor. But, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him gently, I placed him on a large Sofa, where he began to reſpire with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0237300105:94"/>
I then ſent for a Sergeant at Mace and his Attendants, and giving our Heroine, with a Mittimus into his Hands, I deſired him to provide her with a decent Room and ſuitable Accommodations, and not to admit any Company, except her Servant, till further Orders. Ay, away with her, away with her, at any Rate! exclaimed the old Man, ſhe has the Looks of a very <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> and every Hair of her Head is turned into a frightful Serpent.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ſhe was gone, I called her principal Maid and, putting a few Pieces into her Hand, I deſired her to follow her Miſtreſs and to ſerve her with Care and Tenderneſs; and further to intimate to her that, when ſhe gave any Proofs of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Reformation, ſhe ſhould yet be humanely and generouſly provided for.</p>
            <p>Having thus far ſettled Matters, I gave Commiſſion to <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> with a male Domeſtic in whom the old Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided, to remain and take care of the Houſe and Effects; and, taking the Keys of the Cabinets with us, we ſet off on our return to <hi>Hamſtead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Way, Mr. <hi>Clement</hi> grew deeply dejected, and ſighing ſaid, O Sir, how
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0237300105:95"/>ſtrong, how very ſtrongly is the Deſire of Society impreſſed on the human Heart; when, even in the Abſence of Robbers and Murderers, I feel a Want and Diſconſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I cannot expreſs. I have now no Relation, no Friend but Yourſelf, no Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or Connection with any Other upon Earth. To You, indeed, I owe my Life, and all elſe that I am worth; and, if you will not chaſe me from You, if you will allow me to remain with You, You ſhall be all the World to me, the Heir and ſole Poſſeſſor of all that I poſſeſs.</p>
            <p>But, have You not a Son? I cannot think I have, ſaid he; it is now above eight Years ſince I ſet Eyes on my dear <hi>Hammel,</hi> the precious Pearl whom, in my Dotage, I madly caſt away. But, were he ſtill living, after what is paſt, I could never more have the Courage to look him in the Face. A cruel and a falſe Pelican have I proved to my Little One; inſtead of foſtering him with my Vitals, I have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held and torn from him even the common Means of Life.</p>
            <p>Do you know None of your Name, ſaid I, who may claim your Subſtance under Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of being of your Blood? Not Any, Sir; my Father was a Foreigner, and I never heard of any Other of the Name in this Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0237300105:96"/>
There is One of your Name, ſaid I, who lives in our Town. But then, he is in flowing Circumſtances, quite above the Deſire of encreaſing his Fortune by baſe or low Means. He is my moſt intimate Friend, a very accompliſhed Gentleman, and has one of the fineſt Women to Wife, and two of the lovelieſt Children that I have ſeen. If you pleaſe, I will invite and introduce them to You, to Night, or to Morrow.</p>
            <p>On our Arrival, I left old <hi>Clement</hi> a while in the Parlour, while I ſtepped to give pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Directions reſpecting the Conduct of your Tutor, <hi>Harry,</hi> and the Interview which I propoſed between him and his Father.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid I as I returned, I have taken the Liberty to invite your Nameſakes to ſup with You. They are a very amiable Family, and I hope that their Company and Acquaintance will prove a Matter of Conſolation, perhaps a Bleſſing to You. Ah, he cried, my Claims are of a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nature; I have no Right to Bleſſings or Conſolations of any Kind.</p>
            <p>Some time before Supper, a Rapping was heard, and <hi>Arabella</hi> enter'd, leading in a little Daughter of about four Years
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0237300105:97"/>old, and followed by her Son, <hi>Dickey,</hi> All elegantly dreſſed.</p>
            <p>Madam, ſaid I, this is a Nameſake of Yours, my worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> pray let me have the Pleaſure of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing You to each Other.</p>
            <p>When they were both ſeated, the old Gentleman took out his Perſpective, and, peering at her for ſome Time, ah, he cried, what lovely Faces there are in the World, but All have not proved lovely throughout, like You, Madam.</p>
            <p>He then called <hi>Dickey</hi> to him, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by both Hands, and bringing him forward between his Knees; what is your Name, my Dear, ſays he? <hi>Richard Clement,</hi> Sir, ſo pleaſe You. I would it were <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew,</hi> replied the old Gentleman; but Names ſignify nothing, You are a ſweet little Fellow, and perhaps may be ſomething the better for my Death. I would not wiſh your Death, Sir, ſaid <hi>Dickey,</hi> for All that I could get by You. O, how very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, exclaimed the old Man, how hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly is the Simplicity and Diſintereſtedneſs of Infants!</p>
            <p>He next requeſted <hi>Arabella</hi> to ſpare her little Daughter to him, for a Minute; and ſhe accordingly took and led her to him:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0237300105:98"/>When, fondly careſſing her, and ſeating her on his Knee, Could you find in your Heart, ſays he, to love ſuch an ugly old Thing as I am? Yes, me could, ſays ſhe, and me has got ſome Comforts for you in my Pocket. Whereupon ſhe produced a little Paper and, unfolding it, preſented him with ſome candied Seeds and Almonds. O, my God, cried the old Man, what a Heaven I ſhould yet enjoy upon Earth, could I but purchaſe the Society of theſe dear Infants!—I heard him, with a moiſtening Eye, and rejoiced in the ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fruits of my little Project.</p>
            <p>Pray, Madam, ſays I, what is become of our good Friend your Huſband, are we not to have the Happineſs of his Company to Night? Sir, ſays ſhe, he was engaged on indiſpenſable Buſineſs at the Time, but will certainly attend you before Supper.</p>
            <p>She had ſcarce ſpoke when a ſecond Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping was heard, and in came our <hi>Hammel,</hi> not in gay but coſtly Apparel, as I had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
            <p>On introducing the Son, to his venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Father, they reſpectfully ſaluted Each other as utter Strangers. For, our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Hammel</hi> was more different from the meagre and threadbare <hi>Hammel</hi> that his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0237300105:99"/>Father had laſt ſeen, then <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s fat Kine could be from his lean Ones.</p>
            <p>During Supper, and after, I purpoſely threw out occaſional Topics, and gave ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Opens, wherein I knew that <hi>Hammel</hi> could ſhine; and he accordingly made Uſe of them with great Spirit and Advantage.</p>
            <p>His Father gazed at him with a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Admiration, and at length exclaimed, You are an Ornament, an Honor, Sir, to your Name, to your Lineage, and the Country wherein you were born. But pray of what Family? Alas, Sir, you add Stings to the Recollection of my Faults this Day: I once had a Son, a Son who, in an humble Degree, might now have reſembled your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but my Unkindneſs muſt, long ſince, have broken his gentle Heart. My Child ſaved me from Murderers, and I in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn was the Murderer of my Child. O, <hi>Hammel,</hi> my <hi>Hammel,</hi> my Son, my Son <hi>Hammel,</hi> would to God I had died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wronged thee! Would God I had died for thee, O <hi>Hammel,</hi> my Son, my Son!</p>
            <p>His laſt Words were broken and nearly ſuppreſſed by a Guſh of Tears; when the tender hearted <hi>Hammel</hi> turned an Eye upon me, and cried, O, Sir, we have gone too far! — Then, haſtily advancing, he threw
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0237300105:100"/>himſelf at the Knees of his Father. I am here, Sir, he cried, your <hi>Hammel,</hi> your own <hi>Hammel,</hi> in all Duty and Affection, ſubmiſſive and proſtrate before you.</p>
            <p>You my <hi>Hammel,</hi> are you my <hi>Hammel,</hi> aſked the old Man? Ah, had you but his famiſhed Face and his tattered Garment, I would take you to my Arms, to my Heart, into my Vitals.</p>
            <p>O, my Father, cried <hi>Hammy,</hi> look not ſo ſtrange and wild upon me! I am indeed your Child, once the Darling of your Heart, whom you foſtered ſo tenderly, and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured at School and College; the true Son of your true Wife, look upon me, my Father! You often told me that I was her Picture; do you not ſee the very Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of my dear Mother in my Face?</p>
            <p>Yes, yes, I think I do.—But then I have been mightily impoſed upon of late. I would you were leaner and worſe clad, my Child! however, if you come in the Name of my Son, I alſo will kneel down and crave his Pardon and your Pardon?</p>
            <p>Here the old Gentleman ſunk down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Knees, and poor <hi>Hammel,</hi> ſtarting up at the ſame inſtant, cried aloud, Alas! Sir, he is beſide himſelf, and I too ſhall go diſtracted!</p>
         </div>
         <div n="102-204" type="pages">
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0237300105:101"/>
            <p>I then was grieved at Heart for the Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem I had made Uſe of, to connect this worthy Family the more endearingly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And coming ſoothingly to him, and raiſing him in my Arms, I replaced him in his Seat, and ſaid, believe me, truſt to me, my dear Mr. <hi>Clement;</hi> this is your true Child, your only Child, your true <hi>Hammel!</hi> He has lived with me many Years, I can prove him to be your's by a thouſand Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, by thoſe who can witneſs what he has ſuffered, on account of being your Son.</p>
            <p>Well, well, well, ſaid he, whiſperingly, it does not ſignify much, for I have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther One coming, my <hi>Polly</hi> is now in the ninth Week of her Reckoning.—Ay, but, that <hi>Saint Belial,</hi> who knows but the Child may be an Imp of his Begetting?—A curſed Couple they are, I'm ſure; ſhe a Succubus, and he the Devil himſelf incarnate—I hope they didn't hear me—ſhut the Door!—O, there they are!—Save me, ſave me!—they come upon me!—My Throat, they gripe my Throat!—My Breath, my Breath!—O—h—</p>
            <p>Here he ſwooned. But, on taking a little Blood, he came to himſelf. So I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0237300105:102"/>all to be kept quiet about him; and, getting him to Bed, he ſwallowed a ſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rific Draught, ſlept ſoundly till Morning, and awoke in his perfect Senſes.</p>
            <p>I then went to bid him Good-morrow, and took a Chair by his Bedſide.—That was a mighty agreeable Family, ſaid he, who ſupped with you laſt Night, Sir. The very worthieſt, I replied, that I know upon Earth.—You called them <hi>Clement,</hi> I think.—That is their Name, Sir.—Pray, did they go Home?—No, they are here ſtill; at Times, we make but one Family and one Houſehold.</p>
            <p>While I ſpoke, I was ſurpriſed to ſee <hi>Clement</hi> enter, dreſſed in the ſame ſhabby Clothes in which we firſt found him, <hi>Harry;</hi> and the old Gentleman, turning his Head to the Door, ſtarted up in his Bed and cried, if I am a living Man, that is ſurely my <hi>Hammel,</hi> my very Son <hi>Hammel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On hearing this, poor <hi>Clement</hi> leaped haſtily forward and, falling by the Bed, ſeized One of his Father's Hands, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly kiſſed it, and wept upon it. You are reſtored to me then, he cried, my Father, my Father! God be praiſed, God be praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! You are reſtored to me entire, I truſt, with all that paternal and melting Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which was once the Bleſſing and the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0237300105:103"/>Treaſure that I prized above the World. No, <hi>Hammy,</hi> ſaid the old Man, I will not deceive you, I cannot love you as I once loved you, becauſe you never can forgive me. If you could forgive me, <hi>Hammy,</hi> I would love you with a double Love, a Love paſſing the Love of Fathers.</p>
            <p>O, my Father, exclaimed <hi>Hammel,</hi> this one happy Moment of Reconciliation am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply cancels all Offences, and outweighs all Sufferings. Permit me then, my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Father, to introduce Thoſe to you who have an equal Right to your Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>So ſaying, off he went, and brought in <hi>Arabella,</hi> with her attending Children, and all the Four kneeled down by the Side of the old Man.</p>
            <p>O, my God, he cried out, you are too bountiful, too gracious, you oppreſs, you cruſh me to nothing with this exceeding Weight of your Benefits! I was a withered and a blaſted Branch, and you have cauſed me, like <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod to Bud and Bloſſom anew, and to bear theſe bleſſed Fruits, I truſt, to your Glory!</p>
            <p>When Breakfaſt was laid, and the old Gentleman dreſſed, I ſent up for him, and when we were ſeated, <hi>Clement</hi> entered with
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0237300105:104"/>his Family, All elegantly dreſſed, as on the preceding Night. <hi>Hammy,</hi> ſaid I, how came you by that Diſguiſe which you put on this Morning? You looked ſo unlike your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf you almoſt frightened me.—Don't you remember that Dreſs, Sir?—How ſhould I remember what I never ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?—O, you did ſee them before, Sir; thoſe were the Weeds I wore, when you ſaved me and Mine from famiſhing; and I have ever ſince preſerved, and ſhall ever preſerve them, as the precious Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of my Obligations to you. What, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the old Gentleman, my Life, and your Life! has he ſaved your Life alſo, my Son? Yes, Sir, cried the grateful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, All who are alive here live only by—Here, while I put one Hand to the Mouth of my Friend, his venerable Father ſeized hold on the Other, and, bending one Knee, he preſſed it to his Lips, in a Silence that paſſed all poſſible Utterance.</p>
            <p>But pray, Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> ſaid I, to turn aſide the Subject, what do you propoſe to do with Mrs. <hi>Cable?</hi> You know that, in Caſe of Penitence, I promiſed to have her taken Care of. To be ſure, Sir, ſaid he, I will make good all your Engagements, and I will further do whatever ſhe deſires, on Condition of her reſiding in a different Country, or rather in a different Kingdom; for I would not, for the World, that ſhe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0237300105:105"/>ſhould come within the Reach of me, by fifty Leagues at leaſt; unleſs you were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be with me for a Safeguard.</p>
            <p>I laughed, and, immediately, Mrs. <hi>Cable</hi>'s Maid entered all in a Heat, with a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and imploring Countenance. So my good Girl, ſaid I, how is your Miſtreſs, to Day? Ah Sir! ſhe cried, I have but a very ſad Account to give you of my Commiſſion. My Miſtreſs is dead, and I doubt that I, myſelf, have been ignorantly her Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.</p>
            <p>Soon, after ſhe was ſhewn to her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Hetty,</hi> ſays ſhe, I find myſelf grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſick, pray ſtep and bring me the little Bottle of Cordial, that you will find ſtanding in ſuch a Corner of my Cloſet. I did as I was ordered and, returning in all Haſte, I preſented her with the Bottle. When, looking mournfully at it, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a heavy Sigh, Ay, ſhe cried, this is the right Cordial, this will do the Buſineſs; then calling for a Wine Glaſs, ſhe filled and drank it off.</p>
            <p>In a little while after, ſhe complained of being drowſy, whereupon I undreſſed and helped her to Bed, and lighting a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, I ſat down to watch beſide her. For a Time, ſhe appeared to ſleep quite ſound and eaſy, but again, began to moan and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0237300105:106"/>toſs the Clothes. In a while after, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe ſeemed quite compoſed. But, toward the Dead of Night, not hearing her breathe, I held up the Candle, and ſaw that her fine Face was livid and ghaſtly, and her Skin all diſcoloured.</p>
            <p>I then thought that I, myſelf, ſhould have dropped dead on the Spot. I gave a great Shriek, and, I believe, continued ſhrieking till the Keeper and a Servant Maid came in. So Sir, if your Honour is pleaſed to think that the Blame of this Matter belongs to me, I am come to deliver my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to Juſtice.</p>
            <p>No, my Girl, ſaid I, you are not at all ſuſpected. I don't perceive any Intereſt that you could poſſibly have in this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Event. No, Sir, ſaid old <hi>Clement,</hi> I can anſwer for her Innocence; ſhe is but a late Comer; ſhe was particularly tender of me, and, I dare ſay, knew nothing of the ill Deſigns of her Miſtreſs. And ſo, <hi>Hetty,</hi> I will recommend you to a better Miſtreſs, <hi>Hetty,</hi> an Angel of a Miſtreſs, even to my own deareſt Daughter, who ſits bluſhing before you there.</p>
            <p>That Night, after the Inqueſt of the Coroners, Mrs. <hi>Cable</hi> was ſecretly buried in the Fields, and my Servants interred her Confederate on the high Road; for I did
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0237300105:107"/>not chooſe to have the ſacred Ceremony of our Church profaned over a Reprobate who rejected the Hope of a bleſſed Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>The Day before I ſet forward, our kind-hearted <hi>Clement</hi> earneſtly petitioned to accompany me, and urged his Impatience to embrace You, my <hi>Harry;</hi> but this I peremptorily refuſed, as I was ſenſible that his own Affairs demanded his Preſence. So I came away, alone, yet attended by the Tears and good Wiſhes of the happieſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily that is, I think, within his Majeſty's Dominions.</p>
            <p>My deareſt Brother, ſaid the Earl, the latter Part of your Story is exceedingly pleaſing, and yet ſcarce makes Amends for the Horrors that preceded. My Fleſh, as well as my Spirit, ſtill ſhudders at the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of that accurſed <hi>Belial.</hi> I did not think that ſuch a Malevolence and Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Diſpoſition could be generated in the Bottom of Hell itſelf.</p>
            <p>And yet, my Lord, I am perſuaded, ſaid Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> that could it pleaſe God, at this Inſtant, to withdraw from me the Influence of his holy and happy Spirit, I ſhould become altogether as evil as <hi>Belia</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0237300105:108"/>
I cannot think ſo, my Brother, replied the Earl, You would ſtill continue a Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and free Creature. There is certainly a Diſtinction in the Nature of Things; there is the Beautiful and Deformed, the Amiable and Deteſtable; your Judgment would approve the One and reject the Other; and your Freedom of Agency would act conformable to your Election.</p>
            <p>Ah, my Lord, cried Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> what Things, what Beauty, what Amiableneſs, what Freedom is this that you ſpeak of? Have you found out another Univerſe, or another Deity beſide Him in whom our Life ſubſiſts? Are there any Things in Nature, ſave the Things of our God? Or what Beauty or Amiableneſs can they poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly exhibit, ſave what they derive from him; ſave ſome Quality or Impregnation, ſome Manifeſtation or Impreſſion of his own Beauty or Amiableneſs?</p>
            <p>To make this Matter clear, let us go ſomewhat deeper, quite back, if you pleaſe, my Lord, to the very Birth of Things.</p>
            <p>Throughout Nature, we find that God can impart to his Creatures a Being, an Identity, a Fire of Life, an Intelligence or Sagacity, a Conſciouſneſs, a Force or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Will, and a Freedom, diſtinct from
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0237300105:109"/>himſelf, and diſtinct from each Other; and this is the utmoſt Extent of Creaturely Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whether reſpecting the Powers that are in Hell or in Heaven, whether reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the higheſt Seraphim that are in Bliſs or in Perdition.</p>
            <p>Now, all theſe Powers or high Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, although diſtinct from God, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely far from being independent of him, for he will not, he cannot depart from his Supremacy, nor that Univerſality of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, by and in whom alone all Eſſences ſubſiſt. He can, indeed, impart the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Powers to any limited Degree that he pleaſes; but then, in their higheſt Degree of Fire, Life, or Sagacity, Force, Action, or Freedom, you will perceive, on the ſlighteſt Reflection, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Beautiful</hi> or <hi>Amiable,</hi> that You ſpoke of; but that they are equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable, and may be equally exerciſed to evil, or good Purpoſes, according to the Nature or Diſpoſition of the Agent.</p>
            <p>Your Pardon, for one Minute, my noble Brother! I have already ſpecified the many great and wonderful Powers that God can impart to his Creatures, diſtinctly, though not independently, from Himſelf. But there is one Power, one Quality which God cannot make Creaturely; which, with all his Omnipotence, he cannot poſſibly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0237300105:110"/>impart, in any Kind of Diſtinction or Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rability from himſelf; and this Quality is called GOODNESS.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear Lord, in order to convince You of this moſt capital and moſt important of all Truths, a Truth upon which, Time, Eternity, and the Univerſe all turn, as on their Axis; it may be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to enquire what GOODNESS is.</p>
            <p>It will be anſwered, that GOODNESS is various and infinite in its Kinds and Degrees. It is ſo indeed, for it is, at once, ONE and MANY. It ſprings forth from our God, as the living Fountain in Paradiſe, that thence divided it into Rivers and numberleſs Streams, to water and repleniſh the whole Earth. All thoſe Streams, however, were but ſo many Parts or Portions of the one variouſly bleſſing Fountain, and that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is LOVE, it is the LOVE of Others, my Lord.</p>
            <p>There is no Species of allowed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Virtue, that is not reducible under the Standard of this, their great Leader, and all generating Parent, called LOVE. GOOD WILL is the eternal Bleſſer of All to whom it is beneficent, and alſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates its own Bleſſing in the very Act of its Love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0237300105:111"/>
Here lies the great and impaſſable Gulph, between God and his Productions, between the Creature and the Creator. The Will of God is an Eternal FIRE OF LOVE to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his Creatures, and goes forth in Bleſſings upon them as wide and univerſal as his own Exiſtence. But the Will of the Creature is confined and limited like its Eſſence. While it is diſtinct, or uninform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Will of God, it cannot poſſibly act beyond or out of itſelf; it cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly feel for any Thing except itſelf; it cannot wiſh any Welfare except its own Welfare, and this it endeavours to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs by the Exertion of all its Powers. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, we may as well ſuppoſe that a crude Rock, at the Extremity of either Pole, while compaſſed by perpetual Darkneſs and compacted by perpetual Froſt, ſhould yet kindle itſelf, and beam forth in Light and Warmth upon All around; as that any creaturely Will ſhould, of its own Powers, go forth in Affection or Kindneſs upon Others.</p>
            <p>From this diſtinct, ſelfiſh, and craving Will of the Creature ſprings every poſſible Evil, whether natural or moral. From the Preference of its own Identity to that of Others, ariſeth Pride. From the Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its graſping at all Advantages to itſelf, ariſeth the Envy of any imaginary
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0237300105:112"/>Advantage to Another. Pride, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Envy beget Hatred, Wrath and Contention, with every Species and Degree of Malevolence and Malignity; and the Diſappointment of theſe Paſſions produces Rancour and Miſery; and, Altogether, they conſtitute the whole Nature and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Hell itſelf in the Soul.</p>
            <p>But, when God is pleaſed to inform the Will of the Creature with any Meaſure of his own benign and benevolent Will, he ſteals it ſweetly forth in Affection to Others. He ſpeaks Peace to the Storm of rending Paſſions; and a new and delightful Dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ariſes on the Spirit. And thus, on the grand and final Conſummation, when every Will ſhall be ſubdued to the WILL OF GOOD TO ALL, our <hi>Jeſus</hi> will take in Hand the reſigned Chordage of our Hearts, he will tune them, as ſo many Inſtruments, to the Song of his own Sentiments, and will touch them with the Finger of his own divine Feelings. Then ſhall the Wiſdom, the Might, and the Goodneſs of our God become the Wiſdom, Might, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all his intelligent Creatures. The Happineſs of Each ſhall multiply and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow, in the Wiſhes and Participation of the Happineſs of All. The Univerſe ſhall begin to ſound with the Song of Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and all Voices ſhall break forth in an eternal Hallelujah, of Praiſe tranſcending
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0237300105:113"/>Praiſe, and Glory tranſcending Glory! to God and the Lamb!</p>
            <p>Haſten, haſten that bleſſed Period, great God, we beſeech thee! exclaimed the Earl. But, tell me, my heavenly Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for it is ſurely in Heaven that you hold your Converſation, and from whence you derive all your Knowledge and Lights; tell me then, is there no Diſtinction, no Preference, in Matter of Goodneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Creature and Creature, between Man and Man? For this ſeems to be the Conſequence of what You have ſet forth very nearly, I acknowledge, to mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>Your Queſtion, my dear Lord, is very deep, ſaid Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and ſtill leads to greater Depths than I would chooſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe before our <hi>Harry,</hi> yet awhile. I will however attempt, in few and ſimple Words, to give you ſome Satisfaction on this moſt intereſting Article.</p>
            <p>There are two great and capital Errors, under which the World of Man hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, and ſtill continues to labour ever ſince the Creation. The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, that of aſcribing and imputing, to Ourſelves, every Emotion and Inclination, toward Virtue or Goodneſs, that we ſeel within us: The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0237300105:114"/>is, that, as free Agents, we are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to elect and reject, merely by the Act of an own Will independent of any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe or Bias whatever.</p>
            <p>I have already ſhewn your Lordſhip that every creaturely Will, independent of the Will of its God, can be no other than an eager Craving after its own Happineſs, and cannot poſſibly be affected in Behalf of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Creature, who is wholly diſtinct from it and wholly an Alien to it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, every creaturely Will, in ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate and adverſe State, is altogether as an <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> whoſe Hand is againſt every One, and every One's Hand againſt him.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, I have ſhewn You that God (the ſole Fountain of all Being and Bleſſedneſs) can, in his Nature and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, be nothing but LOVE; and that, even in loving Himſelf, he muſt love his own Productions, the Realizing of his own Ideas, and the Works of his own Power. What, indeed, ſhould hinder our God from being wholly a God of Love? Was there any thing before him, was there any thing coaeval with him to controul or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him? Had he any thing to envy, had he any thing to excite his Anger, except his own Conceptions, and Theſe he was at Liberty to bring, or not to bring into Exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0237300105:115"/>or Perceptibility, even at his own Pleaſure. What then ſhould affect him with the ſlighteſt Tincture of Malignity? Could he add to his own Happineſs by rouſing the hateful Paſſions within his own bleſſed Boſom? We may more rationally ſuppoſe that the Sun, in his diſtant Zenith of burning Superiority, ſhould have his Light impaired by the Squirt of a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, than that the Deity ſhould be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with any Touch of Malevolence, by any Creature, or by all the Creatures that his Omnipotence can produce.</p>
            <p>Purblind Reaſon, here, will ſay; even the Goodneſs of God himſelf, in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Heart, will ſay, if our God is all LOVE, if he is a Will to all Rectitude and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Creatures, why did he ſuffer any Evil to begin in Nature or Creature? Could Evil have ariſen contrary to the Will of Omnipotence, if Omnipotence had willed that it ſhould not ariſe?</p>
            <p>Ah, my Friends, no Evil ever did nor ever can approach the Will of God; neither can he will or affect any Species of Evil in Nature or Creature, but he can allow a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Evil in the Creature, as a Travail toward its Birth into the more eminent Degree of that Goodneſs and Happineſs which God affects. God cannot affect or take Delight in the Sufferings of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0237300105:116"/>moſt abandoned Reprobate that ever blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed his Name; but, he can will that the Sinner ſhould be reclaimed, to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even by Suffering, when there are no other Means, in Nature, whereby he may be reclaimed.</p>
            <p>Could Creatures, without the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of any Lapſe or Evil, have been made duely ſenſible of the Darkneſs and Dependance of their creaturely Nature, and of the Diſtance and Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelves and their God; could they have known the Nature and Extent of his Attributes, with the Infinity of his Love; could they have known the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſequences of falling off from him, without ſeeing any Example, or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riencing any Conſequence of ſuch a Fall; could they have, otherwiſe, felt and found that every Act of creaturely Will, and every Attempt at creaturely Power, was a Forſaking of that eternal Wiſdom and Strength in which they ſtood; could all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Creatures have been continued in that Lowlineſs, that Reſignation, that Gratitude of burning Affection which the ſlain. Will of the mortified Sinner feels, when called up into the Grace and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his God; could thoſe endearing Relations have ſubſiſted in Creation, which have ſince newly ariſen, between God and his lapſed Creatures, wholly ſubſequent
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0237300105:117"/>thereto; thoſe Relations, I ſay, of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Regeneration, of a Power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion that extracts Good out of Evil, of a Love that no Apoſtacy can quench, that no Offences can conquer; if theſe eternal Benefits could have been introduced, without their Ground or Foundation in the Admiſſion of Evil, no Lapſe or Falling off would ever have been.</p>
            <p>To make this Matter ſtill clearer, if poſſible — In the dark and the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Mirror, called Nature, God beheld and contemplated, from all Eternity, the Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of his own Light and the Beauty of his own Ideas, even thoſe Ideas to which he had determined to impart Perceptibility, or a Conſciouſneſs and Feeling of an Owneſs of Exiſtence, in Him. He alſo contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated, therein, the whole Infinity of Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, all Cauſes with their Conſequences in the remoteſt Relation, all Events that ever ſhould or ever could come to paſs.</p>
            <p>He ſaw that, without an intelligent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, no Creature could be excellent, or formed in his Likeneſs. But he ſaw alſo that, unleſs ſuch Intelligence ſhould be ruled by his Wiſdom, and ſuch a Deſire wholly conformable to his Will, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could not be wiſe, the Creature could not be happy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0237300105:118"/>
In the Poſſibility of the Creature's Deſire of Independence, God ſaw the Poſſibility of moral and natural Evil: But he ſaw that ſuch partial and temporary Evil might be converted to the Production of an Infinity of Good; and he ſaw that, without the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſuch Evil, the Good that bore Relation thereto could not ariſe.</p>
            <p>He knew that, till the Lapſe or Falling off of ſome of his Creatures, his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Attributes could not duely be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, could not be duely adored in the Glory of their Contraſt. That no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, till then, could be duely ſenſible of its own Fallibility, could be duely ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Sufficiency and Perfection were ſolely in God, and that all Things depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him as well for every Quality of Bleſſedneſs as of Being.</p>
            <p>He foreſaw all the Miſery that ſhould attend upon Error; but he ſaw alſo how amiable, how beneficial was the Senſe of ſuch Error; how it might ſerve to ſap the Self-Confidence of the Creature, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him to caſt his Truſt where his Strength alone lay. And he the more willingly permitted the Sufferings of all his fallen Offspring, as the future bliſsful Period was already preſent to him, when the Miſeries of the ſhort Parentheſis (called
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0237300105:119"/>Time) ſhould be for ever ſhut up between the two Eternities; and when all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and rectified Creatures ſhould enter upon the Fullneſs of the Enjoyment of their God.</p>
            <p>From the Blackneſs of Guilt, and the Cloud of Pains, Calamities, Diſeaſes, and Deaths, God ſaw Remorſe, Contrition, Humility, Patience, and Reſignation, beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth into new Wonders of Light and eternal Life. He ſaw new Relations, new Connections, new Endearments ariſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Creatorly</hi> Good and <hi>Creaturely</hi> Evil, between Tranſgreſſion and Redemption, Repentance and Pardon; and he joyed (without Beginning) in calling his loved Offspring from Error to Rectitude, from Lowlineſs to Exaltation, from Death into Life, from Time to Eternity, and from tranſitory Afflictions into ever enduring and ever encreaſing Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>God foreſaw, in future Worlds of new and wonderful Conſtruction, the Frailty and Lapſe of his favourite Family of Man. He ſaw him ſunk into the Inclemency of outward Elements, and into the inward Darkneſs and Wrath of his diſtinct and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Nature; externally beſieged and tempted by lying Offers of Enjoyment, and internally rent by diſappointed Deſires and malignant Paſſions. But, he had provided
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0237300105:120"/>a Redemption of ſuch ſtupendous Potency, as would not ſuffer the perverſe Creature to tear itſelf out of the Arms of his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He had provided a Seed of the SON OF HIS LOVE, that ſhould take Root in Man's World of inward and outward Evil; that ſhould grow as a fragrant Flower, through Corruption and Abomination, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Freedom, the Light and the Purity of Heaven; that ſhould reprove his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, that ſhould convict him of Wickedneſs, that ſhould convince him of Weakneſs, and ſoften him into Sorrow for his own Tranſgreſſions; that ſhould melt him into a Senſe of the Calamity of others; that ſhould diffuſe as a dawning Light through his dark and angry Nature, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing his Pride, aſſuaging his Paſſions; calling him forth from Self into the Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Benevolence, into all the Charities and Amities, the Feelings and Offices of the human Heart thus made divine; and laſtly, maturing in him a different Nature and a new Creature; that God may be in all Men the ONE WILL TO THE ONE GOODNESS; thereby uniting all Men, as one Man, in their God. For deep, indeed, are all his Counſels; and all the Mazes of his Providence will finally unwind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Rectitude and Fulneſs of the Wiſdom of his Love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0237300105:121"/>
That a Creature, inexperienced or newly brought into Being, ſhould ſtand in the State in which he felt his Delight: Or even, that he ſhould fall therefrom, by attempting at ſomething, through an own Will, and the Preſumption of an own Power; does not appear to have any Thing very wonderful in it. But that a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, already fallen into the Miſery and Depravity of a ſecond and baſe Nature, ſhould riſe again ſuperior to its original Goodneſs and Glory; this is the Work, produced in Time, that will be Matter of chief Amazement throughout the ſecond Eternity.</p>
            <p>That Man, I ſay, fallen into a Body of beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Fleſh and Members, fallen into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a dark and wrathful Nature; fallen into circling Elements of Hoſtility, Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature and Diſſolution to his Frame; that Man, I repeat it, thus degraded and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, thus oppreſſed and aſſaulted from within and from without, ſhould yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and proceed through his Courſe of appointed Warfare, denying his own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, pulling down his own Pride, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating Sufferings with Patience, ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Injuries with Love, delighting to labour under the hinder Part of that Croſs which <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Cyrenian</hi> was compelled to bear; conquering, riſing, triumphing over
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0237300105:122"/>Deſires, Diſappointments, Tribulations, Languor, Sickneſs, failing Exiſtence and Death; and All this, without any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint or Violation of that Principle of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which his ETERNALLY FREE PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GENITOR imparted unto him; this indeed is a Wonder to <hi>Cherubim</hi> and <hi>Seraphim,</hi> and, from Eternity to Eternity, the GREATEST WORK of God.</p>
            <p>Here, Brother, ſaid the Earl, you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly acknowledge that Man is a free Agent.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge, anſwered Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> that Man has a Principle or Seed of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty within him, a Power of turning, or at leaſt of leaving his Will to the Impulſe of Good, on the one Hand, or of Evil on the Other, he could not otherwiſe be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and this brings me directly to your Lordſhip's Queſtion reſpecting the Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Matter of Merit, between Man and Man.</p>
            <p>KNOW THYSELF, was the wiſeſt of all the <hi>Saws</hi> in the ancient Schools; for the moſt uſeful of all Studies, to Man, is that of Man.</p>
            <p>MAN has been repreſented, by the Boaſtings of pagan Philoſophy, as equal in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0237300105:123"/>many Reſpects, and in ſome Articles ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to what they conceived of Godhead.</p>
            <p>They define him a rational and lordly Intelligence, ſole Dictator to his own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Controuler of his own Paſſions, and of Powers, Virtues, and Faculties, wholly free and independent. But, what ſays Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on this Head?</p>
            <p>Man goes out of this World, even as he comes into it, quite paſſive and without his own Conſent. From the Womb to the Time of his maturing in Reaſon, and even till ſome Degree of Power is awakened in him toward governing his Appetites and reſiſting his Inclinations, he is as merely a ſenſual and ſervile Machine as any inferior Animal or Brute in the Creation. His Pulſes beat, his Blood cruclates, and all the Offices of Reſpiration, Secretion, and Perſpiration are performed, alike awake as aſleep, without any more Attention or Care, on his Part, than if he had no Intereſt or Concern therein.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, he is begirt by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Objects, and outward Elements, that hold an intimate Correſpondence and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Communication with his Fleſh, with all his Organs, and his animal Life; excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him a Variety of Appetites and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that he can no more reſiſt, than a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0237300105:124"/>Twig can ſwim againſt a Torrent; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that, were this the Whole of the Man, with Reſpect to his Appetites, he would of Neceſſity be a Brute, and with Reſpect to his Paſſions, he would of Neceſſity be a Devil.</p>
            <p>Thus far, my Lord, you ſee that Man is wholly acted upon, and does nothing but as he is incited or impelled thereto; and were there no other Agent within him to act upon him on the oppoſite Part, had he no preſent Friend to combat with and controul the evil Propenſities of his Nature, he would be as totally a Slave to his carnal and diabolical Luſts, as the Galley-Rower is to the Bench whereon he is chained.</p>
            <p>But, bleſſed be our all-creating, all-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming, and all-loving Friend, who is ever preſent in us and to us, and does not leave our Impotence deſtitute of his Help; who, in the Centre of our old and reprobat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Adam,</hi> hath implanted a divine Seed of a new Nature and a new Creature; even the renewed Image of himſelf in our Souls. It is this infant Reſemblance of himſelf in our Eſſence, which God always cheriſhes, which he always elects, which he purſues; which he calls upon by the Word of the Son of his Love, which he informs with the Breath of his holy Spirit, whiſpering
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0237300105:125"/>into it the ſtill Voice of his own beatifying Affections.</p>
            <p>Now, though theſe two Seeds or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are ſo intimately united in us, that very few obſerve any Diſtinction between them, yet no two Things can be more oppoſite than they are to Each Other, both in their Natures and Propenſities. And, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, the great Apoſtle, <hi>Paul,</hi> hath ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and marked out their ſeparate Offices and Departments with the moſt exact Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. Reach me yonder Bible, <hi>Harry,</hi>— Here it is.—</p>
            <p>
               <q>That which I do, I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. If then I do that which I would not, I conſent unto the Law, that it is good. Now then it is no more I that do it, but Sin that dwelleth in me. For I know that in me (that is, in my Fleſh) dwelleth no good Thing; for to will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not. For the Good that I would, I do not; but the Evil which I would not, that I do. Now, if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but Sin that dwelleth in me. I find then a Law, that when I would do Good, Evil is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with me. For I delight in the Law of God, <hi>after the inward Man.</hi> But I
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0237300105:126"/>ſee another Law in my Members, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in my Members. O, wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me from the Body of this Death!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here, my Friends, You ſee, the Apoſtle diſtinguiſhes, moſt preciſely, between the oppoſite Natures and Tendencies of the two ſeveral Seeds of the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> between the <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Inward,</hi> the <hi>Vitiated</hi> and <hi>Regenerate,</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New Man.</hi> The <hi>Old</hi> warring againſt the <hi>New,</hi> and endeavouring to bring him into Captivity to Sin and Death; inſomuch that our own evil <hi>Cain</hi> would willingly ſlay out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right the good <hi>Abel</hi> that is in us.</p>
            <p>Now, between theſe adverſe Offsprings of the earthly and heavenly <hi>Adams,</hi> our <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Principle of Freedom,</hi> or <hi>Power of Election,</hi> is placed.</p>
            <p>On the one Part, we are beſieged and aſſailed by a World of tempting and ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Objects, that hold intimate Intercourſe with our Fleſh and carnal Senſibilities, and impel their Influences on our Spirit, through every Organ. While the Rulers in Darkneſs, enter through the ſaid ſenſual Avenues, excite their diabolical Paſſions
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0237300105:127"/>within us, and begin to open a Kingdom of their own in our Soul.</p>
            <p>On the contrary Part, our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is graciouſly pleaſed to act upon us, through the kindred Seed of that divine Nature which he had implanted in our Eſſence. He attracts us ſtrongly though not forcibly; and he ſheds into us a Species of mental Feelings and Affections, to which Fleſh and Blood is wholly an Alien.</p>
            <p>Here then, when the Will turns away, from divine Influence, and delivers itſelf up to the Impulſes and Operations of the evil Agents, the whole Man becomes a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in the Regions of Darkneſs and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Death, and Nothing but intenſe Sufferings can awake him to a Senſe of the Error, Inſufficiency, and Folly of his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, and of the Loſs and Horror of the State in which he lies.</p>
            <p>But, when the Will turns and yields it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the gracious Drawings and Influence of God's bleſſing Spirit; God opens him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto it, and attracts it ſtill more powerfully, till he gradually delivers it from the Slavery of Senſe, of Sin, and of Self, into the perfect Freedom of a willing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0237300105:128"/>
Above all, when the Will is aſſaulted by violent, preſſing, and permanent Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; if yet, with the Aſſiſtance of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Grace, it ſtrives and ſtruggles to maintain the Fight, and to tear itſelf away from the Cuſtody of Evil, though anguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Strife, and pierced, even to the dividing of the Bone from the Marrow; then is the Scripture fulfilled that ſays, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth Violence, and the Violent take it by Force;</hi> then is our <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the higheſt Height of his Throne and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; then does he deem all his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings overpaid; and he will, himſelf, be the Champion in the Will of ſuch a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, and he will fight the good Fight, and run the good Courſe, and hold faſt the good Faith both in him and for him, and he will impute the Whole of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts to the willing Inſtrument of his Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and will crown him with the Crown of his own Glory, and will ſtretch out his Exiſtence to the Reception and Expanſion of his whole Heaven within him.</p>
            <p>Here then, my honoured Brother, You have your Queſtion fully anſwered touching the Difference, in Point of Merit, between Man and Man; ſince no Creature can have any Merit ſave ſo far as he opens his Will to the Impreſſions of the Goodneſs of God upon his Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0237300105:129"/>
What, you will ſay, is this the utmoſt Merit that the Beſt of Men can boaſt, that of barely yielding his Will to the Drawings and Influence of the Spirit of Goodneſs? —It is, indeed, my Lord, the very Whole of the Merit that any Creature can have, as his own Merit; the very utmoſt that he can do toward co-operating with his God, and conducing, in any Degree, to his own Salvation and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>O, that all Men, that all Men had this Merit, my Friends! that All would open the Gates of their everlaſting Souls, and humbly and earneſtly petition the King of Glory to come in! This would lead to ever during and ever encreaſing Merit; for our God would then impute his own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits unto us, not by an outward but inward Imputation, even the feeling Senſe and Participation of his Nature, his Powers, and Qualities within us. We ſhould become good in his Goodneſs, wiſe in his Wiſdom, and ſtrong in his Omnipotence. By reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſurrendring, to him, our dark, empty, hungry, and uncomfortable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; we ſhould gain, in lieu thereof, the Plenitude of the rich and illuminating Creator. The Fulneſs of all Delight would become our Portion and Inheritance; and the Proprietor of the Univerſe would be our Property and Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0237300105:130"/>
Here Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> pauſed, and his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors continued in a kind of reſpectful Muſing, as attentive to what he might further offer. At length the Earl exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Never, never more, my Brother, will I debate or queſtion with You, further than aſking your Advice or Opinion, to which I ſhall inſtantly and implicilty ſubmit, as I would to that of the higheſt Seraph in Heaven. Our dear <hi>Meekly,</hi> here, and I had ſome former Converſe on a few of theſe deep Subjects, and I received much Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Inſtruction from him; but he was not quite ſo explicit and convincing as You have been.</p>
            <p>Ah, my Lord, cried <hi>Meekly,</hi> were I as intimate with the Fountain of all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as your precious Brother is, You would not then have poſed me in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation we laſt held on thoſe Heads.</p>
            <p>On the following Day, at Breakfaſt, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> took out his Pocket-Book, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Bank and Stock-Bills to the amount of ſomething upward of three thouſand Pounds. He then preſented them to Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and ſaid, Here, Sir, is a little Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter toward Repayment of the Loan I had from You in <hi>Holland.</hi> I bleſs, I bleſs my God, that he has enabled me, thus far, to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0237300105:131"/>approve myſelf an honeſt Man; but, above all, I bleſs him for giving me once more a Sight of the gracious Countenance of my Patron. But for You, I had miſerably periſhed in a Dungeon; to You, Sir, I owe my Liberty, to You I owe my Life, to You I owe the Recovery of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of my Fathers. With Reſpect to ſuch Obligations I am indeed a beggar'd Inſolvent. But, my Heart is pleaſed with the Thought, that the Connection between us, of Creditor on your Part and of Debtor on mine, ſhould remain on Record to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Here, the worthy <hi>Meekly</hi> became op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed under Senſations of grateful Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and, putting his Handkerchief to his Eyes, he ſobbed out his Paſſion.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> held the Bills in his Hand, and careleſly caſting his Eye over them perceived the Amount. As ſoon as he ſaw that his Friend's Emotion had partly ſubſided, You have, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> ſays he, You have been quite a Goſpel Steward, and have returned me my Own with moſt unlooked for Uſury, and I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily pray God, in Recompenſe of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, to give You the Principality of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cities in the coming Kingdom of his Son. But what ſhall I do with this Money,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0237300105:132"/>my dear <hi>Meekly?</hi> My Wealth already overflows, it is my only Trouble, my only Incumbrance. It claims my Attention, indeed, as it is a Truſt for which I know I am ſtrictly accountable. But I heartily wiſh that Providence would reclaim the Whole to himſelf, and leave me as One of his Mendicants, who daily wait on the Hand that ſupplieth All, who ſeek his Kingdom, with neceſſary Things. For my <hi>Harry</hi> has enough, and more than enough, now, in the Abundance of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Father. You muſt therefore keep theſe Bills to yourſelf, my worthy Friend; retain, or give, or diſpoſe of them, even as it ſhall pleaſe You; whether as your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty or as my Property, it matters not Six-pence; but, take them back, you muſt take them back indeed, my <hi>Meekly.</hi> And ſo ſaying, he ſhoved them over from him, on the Table.</p>
            <p>Ah, my moſt honoured Sir, exclaimed the repining <hi>Meekly,</hi> ſure You would not ſerve me ſo! My Soul is but juſt eaſed of a Load that lay heavy on it for many, many Years. Be not then ſo ſevere as to replace the Burden upon me. It would break my very Heart, ſhould you perſiſt in refuſing this little Inſtance of Acknowledgment from One of your warmeſt Lovers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0237300105:133"/>
Here, <hi>Harry</hi> found himſelf affected and diſtreſſed for the Parties, and, in order to relieve them, took the Deciſion of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, ſays he, I will, with your good Pleaſure, put a very quick End to this Diſpute, and I offer myſelf to You, as your joint Truſtee, to be your Almoner and Diſpoſer of theſe Bills.</p>
            <p>As I was lately on my Rambles, through ſome Villages near <hi>London,</hi> the Jingle of a Number of infant Voices ſtruck my Ear, and turning, and looking in at the Ground-Floor of a long Cottage, I perceived about thirty little Girls neatly dreſſed in a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and All very buſily and variouſly employed, in hackling, carding, knitting, or ſpinning, or in ſewing at their Sampler, or in learning their Letters and ſo forth.</p>
            <p>The adjoining Houſe contained about an equal Number of Boys, moſt of whom were occupied in learning the Rudiments of the ſeveral Handy-Crafts; while the reſt were buſied in cultivating a back Field, intended as a Garden for theſe two young Families.</p>
            <p>I was ſo pleaſed with what I ſaw, that I gave the Maſters and Miſtreſſes ſome ſmall
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0237300105:134"/>Matter; and I reſolved, within myſelf, if ever I ſhould be able, to gather together a little Family of my own for the like Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Now, Gentlemen, here comes Mr. <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>'s Money quite in Seaſon for ſaving juſt ſo much of my own. But hang it, ſince I am grown ſuddenly rich, I think I will be generous for once in my Life, and add as much more out of my proper Stock. I ſhall alſo make ſo free as to draw on my Uncle there for the like Sum; and theſe, totted together, will make a pretty Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my little Project. As to my poor Father here, he has nothing to ſpare, for he has already laviſhed all his Wealth on his naughty Boy.</p>
            <p>My Lord and the Company laughed hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily at <hi>Harry</hi>'s little Pleaſantry—But hearkee, honeſt Friend, added the Earl, you muſt not think to expoſe me, by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me out of your Scheme; can't you lend me as much, <hi>Harry,</hi> as will anſwer my Quota? Yes, my Lord, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> upon proper Securities, I think I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. You are a Rogue, and a Darling, and my Treaſure, and my Honour, and my Ornament, cried the Earl, turning and bending fondly toward him. While <hi>Harry</hi>'s Eyes began to ſwim with Pleaſure, and,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0237300105:135"/>caſting himſelf into his Father's Boſom, he there hid the Tears of his ſwelling De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; while Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> ſat, ſilently wrapt in the Enjoyment of the tender Scene.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Harry</hi> was reſeated, Gentlemen, ſays he, I muſt bid you adieu. I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged on a Party in the Village this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For this Day, I muſt quit the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being your Lordſhip's Son, and ſhall content myſelf with the Station of One of your Vaſſals or Dependants; and ſo ſaying he roſe, and away he ſhot.</p>
            <p>Immediately the Earl rung the Bell, and Mr. <hi>John</hi> entered. <hi>John,</hi> ſaid he, do you know any thing of <hi>Harry</hi>'s Expedition into our Town to Day? Why, my Lord, ſaid <hi>John,</hi> our loving Townſmen have agreed to do all the Honour they can to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival and Welcome of your honourable Brother. The Day is to be ſpent in Sports; and To-morrow is to be lighted up with the Bonfires and 'Luminations of this very Night. There is a Football alſo to be, and I fancy that my Maſter <hi>Harry</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to be no better than a Hail Fellow among them.</p>
            <p>Tell me then, my good <hi>John,</hi> could you contrive ſo as to place us where we might ſee ſome of theſe Diverſions without
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0237300105:136"/>being ſeen? Why, pleaſe your Honours, the Football is to be in our Park; and I can raiſe a Stage of Boards where, by the Help of a Step Ladder, your Honours may get up, and peep over, and ſo ſee all that paſſes. Get it done then, get it done, good <hi>John,</hi> immediately.</p>
            <p>When <hi>John</hi> had gone out to execute his Commiſſion, I believe Sir, ſaid <hi>Meekly</hi> to Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> that there is not ſuch a Boy, as your Nephew, no, not in the whole Univerſe; every Look and Accent, every Motion, Fibre and Member, ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully anſwering, to the Meekneſs and Modeſty, the Honour, the Galantry and Intrepedity of his Spirit. He ſhrinks from Praiſe, he is aſhamed before it; and yet his Words ſink, as Balm on the Heart, and his Actions compel People to affront him with rejected Honours whereever he goes. While I look on his lovely and lowly Countenance, and inwardly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him as I would a Part or Portion of my God; I ſecretly ſay to myſelf, you are a Proof, my <hi>Harry,</hi> that the lower the Roots of Humility ſtrike into the Depths beneath, the more the exalted Branches aſcend the Heights of Heaven! I attend, I ſtudy him, as well for my Inſtruction as Delight, and look upon and revere him, as the moſt perfect Copy that ever yet was
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0237300105:137"/>taken of the omnipotent Babe in the Manger.</p>
            <p>The other Day, he preſerved his noble Father and me from being rent in Pieces by a mad and foaming Monſter of a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff. But, his Calmneſs of Courage with his Quickneſs of Action, his Proweſs and Power, on that Occaſion, exceeded all that I ever met with in Fable. Pray, my Lord, have you not yet told you Brother of that wonderful Incident? No indeed, ſaid the Earl, my <hi>Harry</hi> continued with us, till within this Minute, and I was cautious of offending him by mentioning the Matter before him. For, he can ſcarce bear to be thanked for the Charity that he gives, and much leſs to be praiſed for any Virtue or Accompliſhment. O, my Brother, my Brother, what do I not owe you? a Debt immenſe indeed, never, never, to be paid, for this precious, this ineſtimable Treaſure of a Boy!</p>
            <p>Ah, my Lord, cried Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> I am already overpaid; your Pearl has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid me for all my poliſhing. Nay, I am become his Debtor, I am indebted to him for my Life, if that were a Thing of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. It is now about three Weeks ſince he delivered me from the greateſt Peril I ever was in, and in the wonderful Manner I am going to tell you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0237300105:138"/>
The Day before he ſet out for this Place, I deſired him to take a Walk with me in the Fields, where I inteded gradually to diſcover to him the heavy Tidings of the Death of his Mother and Brother.</p>
            <p>Juſt as I began to open the Matter to him, I heard a ſudden and terrifying Roar, and turning my Eye to the Place from whence it came, I perceived a monſtrous Bull, tearing the Ground with his Foot, and denouncing his Wrath in the Voice of Thunder, when, quitting a few Kine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom he ſtood, he made directly at us. Inſtantly I cried out to <hi>Harry,</hi> and charged him to fly for his Life, but inſtead of obeying me, he advanced with a haſty Pace to meet the enraged Animal.</p>
            <p>Never was I in ſuch a Pannic as I then was for our precious Boy. I ſhook from Head to Foot, and was juſt going to drop, when the furious Beaſt ſtooped his Head to daſh our Child to Pieces; but <hi>Harry,</hi> quick as Thought, laid hold on a Horn with one of his Hands, and riſing into the Air, threw himſelf aſtride upon the Creature's Neck.</p>
            <p>The Bull plunged, and toſſed, and tore about at a frantic Rate, endeavouring to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0237300105:139"/>diſencumber himſelf of his Rider, while <hi>Harry</hi> took out his Penknife and urged him to greater Madneſs by pricking him with the Point. At length the Monſter, all panting, and white with Foam, ſtood ſtill as a Poſt. When <hi>Harry,</hi> ſtooping, made Way through his Hide, opened the jugular Vein, and cut his Windpipe in two, and, after ſome imperfect Roars, the Creature ſunk breathleſs beneath him.</p>
            <p>Think of my Tranſports then, my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when I ſaw my Hero ſafe and ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly triumphant. I ſaid and did Things, I believe, that were quite beſide my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but I ſhall not be ſo readily alarmed for him, hereafter, as I ſee that his Action, Intrepidity, and Preſence of Mind, make him more than a Match for any living Creature.</p>
            <p>In ſome Time after, <hi>John</hi> returned and gave his Lord Notice that their Station was prepared, whereupon our Company iſſued forth and aſcended their Seat of Eminence, where, through the Cover of ſome Trees, they could ſee and obſerve without being obſerved.</p>
            <p>After they had been ſeated and had talked awhile, of Truth, the LORD, OUR RIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEOUSNESS, of Heart felt Peace, and the fearful looking out for Judgment from the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0237300105:140"/>God of Love, a promiſcuous Crowd of many Hundreds of Old and Young, Male, and Female, entered and flooded the Park.</p>
            <p>As All thronged about <hi>Harry</hi> with an affectionate Familiarity; he appointed that Football ſhould begin the Sports; and, two Champions being choſen, Each of them choſe his Man, and that Man Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, alternately, till about forty ſtrenuous and active Youths were ranged on either Side.</p>
            <p>The Field was then divided, and the Ball being toſſed aloft in the Midſt, they All mingled and joſtled together, like Hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones; till, after much running, wreſtling and ſweating, two Games were ſucceſſively loſt on the Side of the Party where <hi>Harry</hi> had ranged himſelf.</p>
            <p>Ah, cried the Earl, my poor <hi>Harry,</hi> I find, is not accuſtomed to rude Sports of this Kind; whereupon Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> laughed and cried, he is a Rogue, he is a Rogue, as you will quickly ſee, my Lord.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Harry,</hi> Maſter <hi>Harry,</hi> exclaimed his Aſſociates, had you ſtaid among us, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of going to that dull and heavy heeled <hi>London,</hi> we would have taught you to play Football better than you do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0237300105:141"/>
I never play right, anſwered <hi>Harry,</hi> but when the Girls are on my Side. And here I lay a Wager of twenty Guineas, in Hands of my Daddy <hi>Dobſon,</hi> that, give me but my Choice, Twenty of theſe pretty Laſſes, and I will beat your two Parties of Fourſcore from one Barrier to the other. What ſay you, <hi>Polly Truck,</hi> will you be on my Side? I will ſide with your Honour againſt the World, cried <hi>Polly,</hi> and away went her Clothes to her Jacket and under Petticoat.</p>
            <p>On this facetious Propoſal of our Hero's, a loud Roar and Laugh was ſet up, that laſted a long Time. Well, well, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> I will give you leave to double your Laugh as ſoon as you are Winners. In the mean Time, my good <hi>Polly,</hi> be pleaſed to chooſe me out the reſt of our fair Fellows at Football.</p>
            <p>When this was done, <hi>Harry</hi> took them All, both Males and Females, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the Barrier juſt oppoſite to his Father, extending to about a Mile in Length; and, while the Girls ſtood pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through Fear and Emulation behind him, he took the Ball in Hand, and, throwing it into the Air, gave it a Kick, as it deſcended, aloof from his Adverſaries who were ranged directly againſt him, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0237300105:142"/>then following it, like a Bullet, he gave it another Kick before it touched the Ground, and purſued and purſued it, with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rapidity, till he gave it the laſt Kick, high over the Trees that reached high over the Wall and over the Heads of his Parents.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, <hi>Polly Truck,</hi> had followed her beloved Patron with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Zeal and Speed, and had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run all the Lads by near a Furlong. At laſt ſhe came up to <hi>Harry</hi> panting and quite ſpent, and wiſhed to wiſh him much Joy but was not able.</p>
            <p>While theſe Things were in Agitation, our Company beheld All from behind their Cover, and, as <hi>Harry</hi> approached, their Hearts beat a quick and equal Meaſure with his Feet, even with ſuch Emotions as <hi>Virgil</hi> aſcribes to the Boſom of <hi>Latona,</hi> while ſhe beholds and contemplates her fair Daughter <hi>Dian</hi> ſo eminently tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Choruſes of her Nymphs in Grace, Beauty, and Excellence.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as <hi>Polly Truck</hi> was come to her Speech, Laws, your Honour! ſays ſhe, where in the World do you contrive to hide your Wings? I have nine Holland Smocks that I won by running at nine
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0237300105:143"/>Wakes, and never was beaten before, in my Life. <hi>Harry</hi> laughed, and gave his quondam Playfellow a friendly Shake of the Hand.</p>
            <p>The Company now began to come in apace, though yet awhile incapable of Utterance; but, gathering about <hi>Harry,</hi> they ſilently eyed him from Head to Foot, and beheld him with a Kind of venerating Aſtoniſhment. At laſt, young <hi>Felſter</hi> (the Wit of the Town) cries, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways heared, till now, that All were Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows at Football, but here is One, I am ſure, who has no Fellow. I will bet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Head, or rather on his Heels, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ninety-nine Shires, and deſire no better than Cripples to ſide him.</p>
            <p>At length Old and Young, Men and Maidens, got once more together; and the Queſtion was ſtarted concerning the next Sports upon which they ſhould enter, when they beheld a mighty Giant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching with Strides that would have ſuited the Arch of a River. He was called, by way of Eminence, the great <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Roſstown,</hi> and was accompanied by his Kinſman, <hi>Pelt</hi> the Tanner.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as <hi>Roger</hi> came up, he very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately ſaluted thoſe of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0237300105:144"/>aſking, what Sport have ye got forward, my brave Boys? The beſt Sport, anſwered <hi>Jack Felſter,</hi> would be to ſee your Highneſs, Mr. <hi>Roger,</hi> get a Fall before Night. That Man, cried <hi>Pelt,</hi> does not ſtep on <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ground who will ever be able to crack of that Feat. Why, as to that Matter, ſaid <hi>Roger,</hi> though I roſe early this Morning, I have a ſtrong Fancy that I am up for the whole Day. <hi>Tom Truck,</hi> cries <hi>Felſter,</hi> if you will get on one Side of him, I will get on 'tother, and try what Hand we can make of this famous Champion.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the Attack began; but <hi>Roger</hi> ſmiled ſuperior, and handled and played them together as a Show-Man plays his Puppits. Another Wreſtler was then added, and then Another, but the Four could no more move him than if he were a Tower; while he lifted them up, in Turns, and laid them ſucceſſively on the Ground, with the beſt natured Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then came ſmilingly up and ſaid, Mr. <hi>Roger</hi> if you'll be ſo kind to teach me the Art of Wreſtling, I will make you a Preſent of twenty Guineas for your Pains, my Daddy <hi>Dobſon</hi> there has the Money in his Pocket. <hi>Roger</hi> here ſurveyed our Hero
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0237300105:145"/>with the moſt inquiſitive Attention. I rejoice to ſee your Honour, ſays he, with all my Heart; and indeed, it was for that only Purpoſe that I came here to Day, having already heard the Story of my Couſin's great Maſtiff. But, Sir, as you were propoſing, and as I honeſtly think, you may do wonderfully well for a Wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of Quality; for you are exceeding finely made as any Thing can poſſibly be for the Volume of you; and, as the Jockeys ſay, are the prettieſt Fellow of your Inches I ever ſet my Eyes on. But, you want ſomething of my Bulk, Maſter, to give you the full Powers. However, I thank your Honour for your generous Proffer, I am ready to enter on my Office whenever you pleaſe; and I hope to make the very moſt of the little Matter that is in you.</p>
            <p>They then grappled, not as Combatants, but as Tutor and Pupil, and the Rogue <hi>Harry</hi> ſubmitted himſelf, as a pliant Twig in his Hands, while <hi>Roger</hi> continued to initiate him in this Trip and that Trip, and in the various Methods of aſſailing and evading. When <hi>Harry,</hi> perceiving his Inſtructor a little overpoiſed, ſuddenly gave him an inſide Foot, and a Puſh at the ſame Inſtant toward the Part to which he inclined. — Strait, like a Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſapped with all its Pines, nine Paces
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0237300105:146"/>huge the Giant ſidelong veered, the tenth, on bended Knee, his mighty Arm upſtaid. — Amazement filled the ruſtic Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to ſee with ſuch Slight moved their Mightieſt, and a univerſal Shout rent the wide Welkin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roger</hi> roſe and returned ſomething abaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his Foil; but ſaid, with apparent good Humour, I am ſorry that I have not twenty Guineas in my Pocket to pay your Honour, for ſhewing me that ſame Trip. However, I hope you will give me one Turn more for the Victory. I now engage you, as a Learner, not as a Teacher. As you will, ſays <hi>Harry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, <hi>Roger</hi> laid hold on <hi>Harry,</hi> with a truly hoſtile Gripe, while <hi>Harry</hi> ſeized his brawny Muſcles, as with little Cramps of Steel. Then was ſeen, on either Side, the long calculated Proportions of Weight againſt Action, and of Action againſt Weight. <hi>Roger</hi> ſeveral Times aſſayed to lift our Hero between his Hands, and to lay him, as he had ſerved the other Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, on the Ground, but could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel him to quit his Gripes. He then ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him hither and thither, and thruſt him from him and pulled him to him, and hooked and tripped him on every Side, but felt himſelf often ſtaggered by the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0237300105:147"/>quick Efforts of <hi>Harry,</hi> while the Scales of Conteſt ſeemed alternately inclining to either Part. At length, <hi>Roger,</hi> beginning to find himſelf overbreathed, plucked his Adverſary to him, and, bending heavily forward, overſhadowed and overbore our Hero to the Earth.</p>
            <p>Great <hi>Roger</hi> then roſe triumphant, and <hi>Harry</hi> alſo aroſe in the beſt Humour ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. Mr. <hi>Roger,</hi> ſays he, I hold it truly an Honour that you think me worthy of Contention, although you have conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But this has been a Kind of Fling for which I don't owe you a Farthing, till you can make me of a Bulk approaching to yourſelf. But come, Mr. <hi>Roger,</hi> I will not take you at an Advantage, recover your Breath, and then, as you ſaid to me, I hope you will give me another Chance for the Victory.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Combatants again engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and mutually exerted their very ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; <hi>Roger</hi> for ſaving his Honour, and <hi>Harry</hi> for preventing an open Diſgrace before the Face of ſo great an Aſſembly. They ſtruggled, they put every Power of Strength and Art to the Proof; till <hi>Roger,</hi> finding himſelf beginning to fail, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to his former Stratagem, and, plucking <hi>Harry</hi> ſuddenly to him, would again have overlaid him; but our Hero,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0237300105:148"/>now aware, ſlipped nimbly from under him, and ſetting his right Foot before the right Foot of his Adverſary, he gave a Shove, with his left Hand to the Other's right Shoulder, and proſtrate fell the great <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Roſstown,</hi> extended over half a Rood of Ground.</p>
            <p>Then, indeed, the Clamours became immoderately high; young <hi>Felſter,</hi> above all Others, grew inſolently triumphant, and the Girls could ſcarce be detained on the Ground, while they clapped Hands, and ſhouted, and ſprung up aloft, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation of <hi>Harry</hi>'s unexpected Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
            <p>Our Hero then very affectionately ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forward, and gave <hi>Roger</hi> a Hand to help him up, but he roſe very ſlowly, as he was ſomething hurt by his Fall. Mr. <hi>Roger,</hi> ſays <hi>Harry,</hi> I am now doubly your Debtor, and will accordingly pay you dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wages, as you have taught me, not only to throw Others, but to throw your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo. Adad, cried <hi>Roger,</hi> I find and feel too, that you are already but too well taught to my Hand.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as <hi>Harry</hi> had paid <hi>Roger</hi> his forty Guineas, Part of which he borrowed from Goodman <hi>Demſter, Roger</hi> ſeized his Hand, and kiſſing it ardently, he cried,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0237300105:149"/>O my Conqueror, my Hero, my noble Child! throughout Life may all Enemies fall before you, nor Death itſelf be able to fling my Boy!</p>
            <p>Juſt then the great Bell rung loudly for Dinner, and <hi>Harry,</hi> turning and meaſuring the Height of the Park Wall with a Glance of his Eye, took a ſhort Race, and running up it ſome Steps, caught hold of the Cope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and threw himſelf over, while all the Aſſembly poured after him a Shout of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> happened to alight within a few Paces of the Stage where his Father and Uncle ſat; but not attending to that, he was haſtening homeward, when Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> cried out, Ho, ho, honeſt Friend, whither away ſo faſt? <hi>Harry</hi> ſtopped and ſtarted, and turning about, looked ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed to find that his ſo highly revered Friends had been the Spectators of his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Feats and Follies; however he advanced toward them in order to help them down, while the Earl whiſpered to his Brother and ſaid, Now we ſhall ſee how proud our <hi>Harry</hi> will be of having overcome the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Roſstown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While they ſat over a temperate Meal, why <hi>Harry,</hi> ſaid the Earl ſomewhat ſlily,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0237300105:150"/>the great <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Roſstown</hi> was but a Babe in your Hands. Ah, my Lord, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> ſmiling and bluſhing, you are not yet rightly apprized how that Matter ſtands. It coſt me no leſs than forty Guineas to prevail upon Mr. <hi>Roger</hi> to let me caſt him; but, when your Lordſhip was a Boy, perhaps you would have thought it but a ſmall Matter for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Honour, eſpecially in the Eyes of the pretty Wenches. Indeed, my <hi>Harry,</hi> ſaid the Earl, I was a very, very naughty Boy at your Years; and, had I been ſuch a Fellow as you are at this Day, I ſhould have kept as large a Seraglio as the <hi>Sophy</hi> himſelf, and that alſo of willing and kind hearted Girls.</p>
            <p>Juſt then <hi>John</hi> entered with Tidings that an Ambaſſy of a Score of Wenches waited at the Hall-Door, and were puſhing before them the prettieſt Maiden he ever beheld, to be their Spoke's-woman.</p>
            <p>Immediately my Lord ordered that they ſhould All be introduced, and quickly after a Clatter was hear'd without, crying, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, indeed now, Miſs <hi>Aggy,</hi> You muſt and ſhall ſpeak for us.</p>
            <p>The Door was then thrown open, and a young Creature enter'd, colouring, panting,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0237300105:151"/>and palpitating, and followed by the Group of Wenches who put her forward before them.</p>
            <p>The Earl, in Pain for her ſweet Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did his beſt to encourage her, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Harry</hi> to help them round with a Glaſs of Wine. By the Time that this was done, Miſs <hi>Aggy</hi> became a little better aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, but had not yet dared to look One of them in the Face, but kept her Eyes bent on the Ground, as though ſhe had been aſhamed of their Brightneſs.</p>
            <p>If—if—my Lord, ſaid ſhe, (tremblingly and whiſperingly) if your honoured—your very honourable Brother is here—we come to invite him and his Company to our Town-Ball.—And we will attend you with Pleaſure, my little Angel, cried the Earl. But, pray who are you, and where do you live?—So pleaſe You, my Father's Name is <hi>Abel Jeſſamin,</hi> and he is lately come Tenant to Part of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Eſtate.—Then I will make him a Preſent of at leaſt a Year's Rent for his fair Daughter's Sake. Here, <hi>John,</hi> give five Guineas apiece to theſe pretty Laſſes to buy each of them a Riband. And, do you hear, bring me twenty Guineas for this their chief Ambaſſadreſs.—Not for the World, my Lord, indeed I will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Farthing. My Father, though poor,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0237300105:152"/>is very jealous of his Honour, and ſhould I take any thing from any Man living, he would never ſuffer me to darken the Light that ſhines in at his Door.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aggy</hi> then made an elegant Courteſey to the Ground, and retreated, attended by her own Graces, and by the revereing and affectionate Regards of the Company.</p>
            <p>Who can this Creature be, cried out the Earl, ſo lovely, ſo uncommon, ſuch a ſweet Diſtinction about her! Ah, exclaimed Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> what a Pity it would be that ſuch Innocence ſhould be ſeduced, and ſuch Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity corrupted! And yet, that is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be the Caſe, ſaid Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> ſince Beauty is the Bawd that procures its own undoing, and Lovelineſs the very Magnet that attracts Men to its Deſtruction. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> half ſuppreſſed a Sigh, but ſaid nothing.</p>
            <p>The Horſes were now immediatly order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be put to, and our Company drove into the Town, accompanied by the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of Hundreds upon Hundreds who lined the Way.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they came to the Market Place, the Coach ſet them down near a ſpacious Flooring that was raiſed, in open Air, about a Foot from the Ground, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0237300105:153"/>ſurrounded with Benches behind Benches, and Benches above Benches, to a great Elevation.</p>
            <p>When they were ſhewn to the Seats prepared for them, they were ſerved with a Variety of Wines and Cakes; for our open hearted Townſmen had ſpared no Coſt for the Entertainment of their noble Gueſts and their Neighbours. The Band of Muſic (the choiceſt that could be got) then ſtruck up, and the Jubilee was opened in full Triumph.</p>
            <p>My Lord then wiſhed, in ſecret, that <hi>Harry</hi> and Miſs <hi>Jeſſamin</hi> would lead the Ball; but, obſerving that his Son looked ſomething dejected, he imputed it to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, and ſuppreſſed his Deſire. In the mean Time, the Lads and Laſſes entered upon the Stage, and ſeveral footed it away featly and with all due Applauſe.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Harry</hi> had not yet opened his Lips to the too, too amiable <hi>Aggy,</hi> nor even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his Hand to lead her out, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined every other Hand that was offered to her. At length, as the Day began to loſe of its Luſtre. Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> whiſpered to <hi>Harry,</hi> and requeſted the Favour that he would dance an <hi>Entry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0237300105:154"/>
The Deſire of Father or Uncle was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, to <hi>Harry,</hi> the ſame as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Grand Signior to his Slave. He roſe, ſtood forth, and appointed the Air, and began to move with a ſlow and graceful Meaſure. But, as the Notes of the Tune quickened, he quickened his Motions. Ether now appeared to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his native Element. No Eye could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that his Foot condeſcended to claim Acquaintance with Earth. He trod Air. He ſpun around. He ſoared aloft like a Pyramid of Fire; while his Limbs preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Meaſure, and his Heels traverſed each other, as he ſhot forward or ſideways, with a Quickneſs that dazzled the Sight. Till poor <hi>Aggy,</hi> in the Exuberance of her Admiration, very innocently and very inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently exclaimed, Sure, ſure, that Girl is not born who can deſerve to have him. All to herſelf.</p>
            <p>Happily for <hi>Aggy,</hi> the Company was ſo intent on the Motions of our Hero, that Few attended to her, ſave <hi>Harry</hi> himſelf, who hear'd what ſhe ſaid to the very Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his Heart.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Aggy,</hi> utterly confounded, at the Recollection of what ſhe had uttered, thought that the Company and the whole World were privy to her Shame. Her
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0237300105:155"/>Face, Neck, and Boſom were inſtantly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed with Crimſon; and ſhe did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to raiſe her Eye to any Face, or any Object, till ſhe gently pulled her elderly Aunt by the Sleeve, and, ſtealing away, deprived the Aſſembly of its principal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Ornament.</p>
            <p>That Night, after Supper, while <hi>Harry</hi> joined with the Company in a Kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained Chearfulneſs, they began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment him on the Atchievements and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Day, when <hi>Harry</hi> replied, in evident Diſcontent, No more, no more, my Friends! Indeed, I never ſo thoroughly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and deteſted myſelf as I do at this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. And ſo ſaying, he roſe haſtily and withdrew to his Chamber.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> ſoon followed, for he was to lye in the ſame Room. And he ſat down, in Silence, while <hi>Harry</hi> was ſlowly undreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. My dear young Friend, ſays he at length, I grieve to ſee you indiſpoſed. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Sir, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> I am not quite as I wiſh, and fear I ſhall diſturb you. Ah, my dear Boy, cried <hi>Meekly,</hi> I know your Diſorder perfectly well. I marked the Riſe and the Progreſs, I ſaw the Whole as plain as <hi>Paul</hi>'s. Had <hi>Aggy Jeſſamin</hi> been indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to you, You would have danced and converſed as familiarly with her as with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0237300105:156"/>any other Wench. But, you dreaded your own Feelings, and you dreaded, ſtill more, that thoſe Feelings ſhould be betrayed to the Obſervation of Others. I know <hi>Aggy Jeſſamin</hi> and her Father, She is indeed very lovely and very deſerving; but yet She is no Mate for you, my <hi>Harry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah, Sir, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> ſince you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeen ſo far into my Soul, I think I had better open my whole Boſom to you, You will look down upon me, to be ſure, you will hold me in the utmoſt Contempt, but, no Matter for that, ſo You promiſe not to love me the leſs.</p>
            <p>Here, I am deemed a mighty clever Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, forſooth, at leaping high Walls, and flinging huge Giants; while alas I am flung, myſelf, by the leaſt of my own Infirmities, and can no more wreſtle againſt one of my Paſſions than if Each of them were a <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Hercules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I own to you, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> that I love <hi>Aggy Jeſſamin,</hi> my Heart alſo tells me that I ſhall always love her. What then muſt be the Conſequence of my unhappy Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Neither my Father nor Uncle will ever approve of our Union, and I would rather pine to Death, than offend the One or the Other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0237300105:157"/>
Should I happen to meet the ſweet Girl apart, I fear, nay I feel, that I could not be able to reſiſt the Temptation, and, ſhould ſhe happen to yield, what a Ruin muſt enſue! If ſhe loved me, it would break the poor Thing's Heart to be forſaken, and the Breaking of her's would break my Heart alſo. And yet, I could never think of continuing in a criminal Commerce.</p>
            <p>Ah, my dear Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> pity the Weakneſs of your Friend, and pity the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that he is in of his own Spirit. My Heart exulted this very Day in its own Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, while it felt itſelf inſenſible to the Acclamations of the Vulgar, and while I reflected that a few Years would ſoon crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Performer of ſuch trifling Exploits, or poſſibly render me, in old Age, the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Boaſter of the Feats of my Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. But, when the ſweet Breath of <hi>Aggy</hi> gave its pleaſing Applauſe to my little Matters, Vanity and Self-eſteem ſunk, with her Approbation, deep into my Boſom, and I have not yet been able to diſpoſſeſs them.</p>
            <p>O, ſuch is my Paſſion for her, that, could I get a Diſpenſation but for a ſingle Treſpaſs, I would willingly do, for it, whole Years of hermitical Penance in the Wilderneſs. But, what would that avail, my Friend, or how might a whole Eternity
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0237300105:158"/>atone for the Seduction of Innocence and Corruption of Virtue?</p>
            <p>O, help me then, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> help me to ſtruggle againſt myſelf; better is it to ſuffer All that the cruel Conflict may coſt me, than to ſuffer the Stings of that never ending Remorſe which would tear my Soul for having injured the Object of my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meekly</hi> was in Tears, and could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for ſome time.—Yes—ſays he at length, I will aſſiſt you in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, a Combat more glorious than ever was fought by all the <hi>Caeſars</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> that ever drew Sword. And I will pray to the Captain of our Salvation, in your Behalf; that he may ſight the good Fight both in you and for you, and finally crown you with the Wreath of eternal Glory! But then you muſt be ruled, you muſt conform to the Preſcriptions of your ſevere but wholeſome Phyſician; in ſhort, my dear Child, you muſt not ſee her any more.—What, never, Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> never ſee her any more? That is hard, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:—It is a neceſſary Hardſhip; could you anſwer to yourſelf the Conſequences of ſuch an Indulgence?—I could not, I could not, I confeſs it, my Friend.—I will prevail upon her Father to ſend her far from you; and I will look out for ſome
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0237300105:159"/>agreeable and kind hearted Man who may make her a worthy Huſband, and be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of her Merits.—</p>
            <p>O, you bear too hard upon me, too hard, indeed, cried <hi>Harry.</hi> What, give her to Another? And yet that's an ungenerous Regret; for, why ſhould I grudge that Happineſs to Another which I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy? Well then, be it ſo, ſince it muſt be ſo, Mr. <hi>Meekly.</hi> Take her, bear her, tear her away from my Sight, from my Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals! But then ſhe muſt not go empty. Take for her two thouſand, three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, five thouſand Pounds; ſhe is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, ſhe is welcome to All that I am worth.</p>
            <p>Here, <hi>Harry</hi> ſat down and wept, and was accompanied by his Friend. But, the Conflict was now over; and though his Heart was deeply grieved, it was much more at Eaſe.</p>
            <p>The next Morning, at Breakfaſt, <hi>Harry</hi> appeared to be quite compoſed. When the Earl, taking a Bundle of Papers from his Pocket, turned, with a fond and conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating Air, to Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and ſaid: My deareſt Brother, when You ſhall be at Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to caſt your Eye over this Parcel, You will find that I have not been altogether, at leaſt not all along, the unnatural Kinſman
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0237300105:160"/>you had Cauſe to apprehend. Theſe are Copies of the Letters which I ſent in ſearch of You, through ſeveral Parts of Europe, and in which I petitioned you to pardon my paſt Offences, and to return and poſſeſs yourſelf of your Rights in the Half of my Fortune and the Whole of my Heart.</p>
            <p>Precious Pledges, cried Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> are all Things to me that bring me any Inſtance of the Affection of ſo dear a Brother; and ſo ſaying he put the Papers into his Boſom.</p>
            <p>But tell me, my ever amiable <hi>Harry Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> continued the Earl, where in the World could you hide yourſelf from my Enquiries theſe twenty Years paſt? I have got ſome ſcattered Sketches of your Hiſtory from Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> and my Son here, and have been burning to learn the Whole, but dreaded to aſk you that Favour, leſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of ſome Paſſages ſhould give You Diſtreſs. I refuſe no Pain to do you a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, my Brother.</p>
            <p>Here, the honourable Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> began his Story, as formerly recited, and that Night ſent his Auditors weeping to Bed.</p>
            <p>On the following Morning, when he came to that Part of his Narrative where Lady <hi>Maitland</hi> broke away, he proceeded as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0237300105:161"/>
Having travelled through ſeveral Parts of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> I took <hi>Germany</hi> in my Tour. I ſtaid ſome time at <hi>Spa</hi> where I drank the Waters, and within the Year arrived, in perfect Health, at <hi>Rotterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On a Viſit to Mr. <hi>De Wit,</hi> at his Villa near the City, he told me, over our Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that he had, at that Time, in his Houſe and in his Guardianſhip, one of the moſt extraordinary Women in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. Though ſhe is now, ſays he, advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward the Decline of Life, ſhe is by far the moſt finiſhed Female I ever beheld, while all ſhe ſays, and all ſhe does, give a Grace to her Perſon that is quite indiſcriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. She has a Youth too, her Son, with her, who is nearly as great a Rarity as her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and, were it not that his Complexion is ſallow, and that he is ſomething ſhort of a Leg, and Blind of one Eye, he would poſitively be the moſt lovely of all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Species.</p>
            <p>You put me in mind, ſaid I laughing, of the <hi>Barratarian</hi> Wench, who was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, to Governor <hi>Sancho,</hi> as the moſt accompliſhed Beauty within a League, with this Exception only, that one Eye was blind, and that the Other ran with Brimſtone and Vermilion. But pray who are theſe Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0237300105:162"/>
That, ſaid he, I either cannot or muſt not declare. They are evidently People of the firſt Faſhion, and muſt have ſome uncommon Reaſons for their preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, as they live quite retired and admit of no Company.</p>
            <p>I proteſt, ſaid I, you have raiſed my Curioſity in Earneſt; is there no managing ſo as to procure me a ſhort <hi>tête a tête</hi> with 'em? I wiſh there was, ſays he, for I long to know how far your Sentiments agree with mine in this Matter. Yeſterday the Lady told me that ſhe intended to go and reſide ſome Time in <hi>England,</hi> and that I would oblige her by getting a Perſon, duely qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, to initiate her and her Son in the Language of the Country. And now, if ſuch a fine Gentleman could condeſcend to undreſs himſelf, you might come To-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as a Perſon who wanted Hire, and I might introduce you to an Interview by the way of treating, provided you are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Honour not to reveal any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them or their Place of Abode</p>
            <p>The next Morning I waited on Mr. <hi>De Wit,</hi> under the Appearance of a reduced Gentleman, a Character that excites a Mixture of Contempt and Compaſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0237300105:163"/>
The Lady received and ſpoke to me with that dignified Complacence, which awes while it engages, and, while it attracts, forbids an irreverent Familiarity. She was, indeed, every thing that my Friend had boaſted of her; for though her Perſon was all Majeſty, her Manner was all Grace. Will you anſwer for the Diſcretion of this young Man, Mr. <hi>De Wit?</hi> I will, Madam, ſays he. I bowed to them both.</p>
            <p>On turning, I perceived that her Son eyed me with much Attention, and I, on my Part, ſurveyed him with the utmoſt Aſtoniſhment. He laboured indeed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently, under all the Diſadvantages that my Friend deſcribed; but Enchantment lurked in his Accents and in the dimpling of his Lips; and, when he ſmiled, Heaven itſelf was infuſed through the fine Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Olive-coloured Countenance.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, I felt ſuch a ſudden Attachment to theſe extraordinary Perſonages, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to keep on the Deception, at leaſt for a few Days, and accordingly engaged with them at a ſtated Salary</p>
            <p>I entered on my Province. My young Pupil, eſpecially, began to improve apace. And, as I was particularly cautious of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the diſtant Reſpect that ſuited my
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0237300105:164"/>Station, I grew into great Favour both with Mother and Son.</p>
            <p>How long, Mr. <hi>De Wit,</hi> would ſay, do you propoſe to carry on this Farce? Till I can prevail upon them, I anſwered, to accompany me to <hi>England.</hi> For I feel my Affections ſo tied to them that I cannot think of parting.</p>
            <p>On a Day as I ſat with my Pupil in his Apartment, he happened to let his Book fall, and, as I ſtooped to take it up, the Picture of my <hi>Matilda,</hi> that was richly enamelled, and ſet with Brilliants, to a great Value, ſuddenly looſed from its Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and dropped thro' the Boſom of my Shirt upon the Floor.</p>
            <p>I ſtood concerned and greatly abaſhed by this Accident, but my Pupil, ſtill more alarmed, ſtarted up and, catching at it, gazed upon it intenſely. Ha, my Friend, ſaid he, I doubt you are an Impoſtor. The Proprietor of this Jewel would never ſet himſelf out to hire without ſome ſiniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Deſign. Who, Sir, and what are you?</p>
            <p>I own, ſaid I, my ſweet Fellow, that I am not what I ſeem, I am of noble De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lcent, and of Riches ſufficient to purchaſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0237300105:165"/>a Principality. — And what then could induce you to impoſe upon us as you have done? — Curioſity at firſt, and then the ſtrong Inclination which I took both to you and your Mother at our firſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view; neither did I propoſe to reveal my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf till we ſhould reach my native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where all Sorts of Honours and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence attend you. — Tell me then, ſaid he, whoſe Picture is this, a very love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One indeed; is this the Face, Sir, of your Miſtreſs or your Wife? (looking very inquiſitively at me.) Ah, ſaid I, ſhe was once Miſtreſs of thouſands of Hearts, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles waited before her Drawing Room, and Dukes near her Toilet. She was once alſo my Wife: But the dear Saint is now eternally bleſſed in a more ſuitable Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom.</p>
            <p>Will you indulge me, Sir, ſaid he, with the Story of your Loves? It may atone in great Meaſure for your late Deception which, however well meant, was very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming.</p>
            <p>Here I related to him the ſhort pathetic Hiſtory that I told you of my <hi>Matilda,</hi> with which he was ſo affected and in ſuch violent Agitation, that I was quite affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him and ſtopped ſeveral Times, but he inſiſted on my proceeding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0237300105:166"/>
Ah, ſaid he, when I concluded, ſhould I ever be conſorted in the Manner that you and your <hi>Matty</hi> were, how bleſſed I ſhall think myſelf! I have, ſays I, a little Couſin in <hi>England,</hi> perhaps the lovelieſt Child in the World, and if you will marry her, when you Both come to proper Years, I will ſettle ten Million of <hi>French</hi> Money upon you. Mean Time I beſeech you to ſay nothing to your Mamma of what has paſſed. I will not, ſaid he, unleſs I ſee a diſcretionary Neceſſity for it.</p>
            <p>That Night, I went to the City to ſettle the Affairs of my Houſhold. On my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn next Morning, I met Mr. <hi>De Wit</hi> at the Gate of his Court. Ah, my Friend, ſaid he, our amiable Gueſts are departed. Gone, I cried, gone! which Way, where to, I pray you? That alſo is a Secret, ſaid he, which I am not permited to tell you. Late in the Evening there arrived a Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of about twenty Servants, ſtrongly armed and mounted, with a flying Chaiſe and ſix Horſes, and a Packet of Letters. The Lady did not go to Bed, but ordered all Things to be in Readineſs for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture againſt the Riſing of the Moon, When they were near ſetting out, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bid me adieu, Have you no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Madam, ſaid I, for the good young
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0237300105:167"/>Man your Tutor? Not a Penny, ſays ſhe, I can't afford Wages equivalent to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of his Quality. How, Madam, ſaid I, is my Friend then detected? But, it was a very innocent and friendly Fraud I aſſure you; I ſhould not have impoſed him upon your Ladyſhip, did I not know you to be ſafer in his honourable Hands than in thoſe of any Other.</p>
            <p>I then gave them an Account of your Family, your vaſt Fortune, nor was I quite ſilent as to your Merits, my dear <hi>Harry;</hi> and I added, that I was ſenſible you would be deeply afflicted at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of Perſons to whom you were ſo ſtrongly attached. There is no Help for it, replied my Lady, we have Reaſons of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Import for not diſcloſing ourſelves to him. Tell him, however, that we eſteem him highly — affect him tenderly — ſhall think of him — ſhall pray for him — and — and — laſtly — that you ſaw us drop a grateful Tear to his Remembrance.</p>
            <p>As I could extort no further Intelligence from my Friend, Mr. <hi>De Wit,</hi> I parted in a half Kind of Chagrin, and prepared to purſue my Fugitives, though I knew not what Road to take, nor where to turn me for the Purpoſe. At all Adventures, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I ſet out on the Way to <hi>France,</hi> as
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0237300105:168"/>they appeared to be of that Country, as well by the Elegance of their Manners, as by their Fluency in the Language.</p>
            <p>I was attended by eleven of as brave and faithful Fellows as ever thruſt themſelves between their Maſter and Danger.</p>
            <p>On the fifth or ſixth Day, as we got on the Borders of <hi>French Flanders,</hi> in an open and deſolate Way, with a Foreſt far on the left, a Man rode toward us on the Spur, and approaching cried out, Help, Gentlemen, for Heaven's Sake, help to reſcue my dear Ladies, who are plundered and carried away by the Banditti. They have already killed twenty of my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and I alone am left to cry out for Relief — I bid him lead, and we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed!</p>
            <p>In a few Minutes we came where we ſaw a great Number of the Dead and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, covering the Sand and thin Herbage. But our Leader cried out, Stop not here, my noble Friends! Yonder they are, yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they are, they have but juſt taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all our Horſes, Luggage, and Coach, and are now at the Plunder. I am weak thro' Loſs of Blood, but will help you the beſt I may.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0237300105:169"/>
Here he ſpurred again toward the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but his Horſe would not anſwer his Courage. I then looked about to obſerve if any Advantage could be taken; for I perceived that the Ruffians were ſtill very numerous, about Thirty who had ſurvived the late Combat; but, ſeeing that the Country was quite open, and that we had nothing but Reſolution and our God to help us, I commended myſelf to him in ſo good a Cauſe, and, putting my Horſe to Speed, I rode full at the Foe, confident of being well and gallantly ſeconded.</p>
            <p>When the Banditti perceived us, they inſtantly quitted the Plunder, and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a Group, they prepared their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabines, and diſcharged them full at us as we drew near.</p>
            <p>As I happened to be foremoſt I received the greateſt Damage. One of their Balls gave me this Mark in my Neck; Another paſſed through the Fleſh of my left Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and Another through my Hat, and left this Scar in my Head.</p>
            <p>But, when we came in upon them, as the <hi>Romans</hi> ſay, <hi>comminus enſe,</hi> Hand to Hand, had they doubled their Numbers, they would have been as nothing to us. My faithful <hi>Iriſhman</hi> levelled Half a Score
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0237300105:170"/>of them with his own Hand, and in leſs than three Minutes we had no Opponent in the Field. I then rode up to the Coach and perceived two Ladies in it, pale as Death, and ſunk ſenſeleſs to the Bottom.</p>
            <p>Immediately I ordered <hi>James,</hi> my Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's Mate, to take a little Blood from them, and, on their Recovery, to follow me, with all my People, and all the Horſes, Baggage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the neareſt Inn. Then, feeling my Wounds begin to ſmart, I took my Surgeon with me and gallopped away.</p>
            <p>In about a League, we came to a large Houſe of Entertainment, and, finding my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſick and qualmiſh, through the great Effuſion of Blood, I had my Wounds di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly dreſſed and, taking a Draught of Wine Whey, got into a warm Bed.</p>
            <p>After a Night of uneaſy Slumbers the Curtain of my Bed was gently drawn aſide, and awaking, I heard a Voice ſay, in ſoft Muſic, Ah, my dear Mamma, it is he, it is he himſelf!</p>
            <p>On lifting my feeble Eyes, I perceived a Viſion at my Side, of a female Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but more wonderful and more lovely than any thing I had ever conceived of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0237300105:171"/>Inhabitants in Bliſs. Her Eyes ſwam in Glory, and her whole Form ſeemed a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſing or Subſtantiation of Harmony and Light.</p>
            <p>While I gazed in ſilent Aſtoniſhment, I heard another Voice ſay, Don't you know us, my Son, my dear Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> don't you remember your Pupils, don't you remember your blind, lame and tawny <hi>Lewis?</hi> he is now turned into that paſſable Girl there, whoſe Honour and whoſe Life you Yeſterday preſerved at the great Peril of your own.</p>
            <p>Here, ſeizing her Hand, I preſſed it to my Lips and cried, Am I then ſo bleſſed, my honoured Madam, as to have done ſome Service to the two deareſt Objects of my Heart's fixed Affections? Soft, ſays ſhe, none of theſe Tranſports, your Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon tells us that Repoſe is neceſſary for you. Mean time we will go and prepare the beſt Regimen that the Place can afford for your Nouriſhment. And, after that, I will ſend a Diſpatch to my Lord, and let him know how far, how very deeply He, and we, and all his Houſe are indebted to you.</p>
            <p>For that Day, and the following Week, as my Fever grew ſomething high, I ſaw no more of the Daughter, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0237300105:172"/>ſtaid no longer than to adminiſter ſomething to me, or barely to enquire how I was. At length I got a Cool and began to recover, when the former Viſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended upon my raviſhed Senſes, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that <hi>Louiſa,</hi> the Sight of whom never failed to bring Cheer to the Eyes and Delight to the Hearts of all Beholders.</p>
            <p>They ſat down by my Side, and my Lady, taking my Hand and looking ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly at me, what would you think, ſaid ſhe ſmiling, of my <hi>Louy</hi> for a Wife? Ah, Madam, I exclaimed, She would be too much of Bliſs, too precious, too glorious, too overpowering for the Heart and Senſes of any Mortal. Don't tell me, cries my Lady, in my Eyes, my <hi>Harry,</hi> you are full as amiable for a Huſband as ſhe can be for a Wife. Beſide, you have earned her, my Son, ſhe is your own dear Purchaſe, by a Service of infinite Value, and at the Price of your precious Blood. She has told me the Story of your firſt Love, and the Recollection of it never fails to bring Tears from my Eyes. But I muſt, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, hear the Whole from your own Mouth, with all your other Adventures, the ſmalleſt Incident will be very intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, I aſſure you. O, my dear, my ſweet Fellow, you are to a Hair the very Man I wiſh for my <hi>Louiſa,</hi> the brave, the tender, gentle and generous Heart; juſt
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0237300105:173"/>the Thing I would have wiſhed for myſelf, when I was at the Age of my <hi>Louy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, my deareſt, my honoured Madam, loved and honoured next to Heaven, you have not yet told me how your <hi>Louiſa</hi> is inclined. Whereupon, the bewitching Creature, archly ſmiling, and bluſhing, and reaching forth a poliſhed Hand of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Alabaſter, Here, ſhe cried, I preſent you with this Trifle, in Token that I don't hate you—very much.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Clinton,</hi> ſaid my Lady, I have ſent off my favourite Servant <hi>Gerard,</hi> with my Diſpatches to my Lord. He is the only One that remains of all my Retinue. Your Surgeon has dreſſed his Wound, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces it ſo ſlight as not to incommode him in his Journey. I choſe him more particularly for the Carrier of my Purpoſes, as he was the Witneſs of your Valour, as he can teſtify to my Lord with what Intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity you ruſhed foremoſt, into the Thick of the Aſſaſſins, and with what unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled Bravery you defeated, in a ſhort Time, a Body of four or five times your Number. Theſe Things, I truſt, will have their due Weight; for, though my Lord is of a lofty and inflexible Nature, he is yet alive to the Feelings of Honour and Juſtice, ſo that our Affairs have a hopeful and auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0237300105:174"/>Aſpect. But, you are a little fluſhed, my Child; we will not encroach further upon you till To-morrow.</p>
            <p>During the three following Weeks, though confined to my Bed, I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſit up, and my Wounds, though not ſkinned, were healing apace. What Happineſs did I enjoy during that ecſtatic Interval! the maternal and filial Angels ſcarce ever left my Side. One Morning, when I juſt awoke from a terrifying Dream, they both entered with Peace and Comfort and Healing in their Countenances.</p>
            <p>What is the Matter, my <hi>Harry,</hi> ſaid my Lady, your Face does not ſeem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to that Fortitude and Complacence which is ſeated in your Heart. Ah, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I cried, I have been all Night tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the moſt alarming and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Viſions I ever had in my Life. Three times I dreamed, ſucceſſively, that my <hi>Louiſa</hi> and I were walking Hand in Hand, through the Fields of <hi>Elyſium,</hi> or on the Banks of <hi>Meander,</hi> or in the Gardens of <hi>Alcinous,</hi> gazing and drinking in large Draughts of Love from Each Other: when at one Time a huge and tremendous Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and again a ſudden Earthquake, and again an impetuous Hurricane came, and caught, and ſevered us far aſunder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0237300105:175"/>
But my Viſions, my honeſt Friend, ſaid the heavenly ſmiling <hi>Louiſa,</hi> have been of a very different Nature. I dreamed that, while we were ſtanding on the Brink of a frightful Precipice together, your <hi>Matilda</hi> deſcended, all celeſtial, and a thouſand Times more lovely than ſhe appears in the lovely Portrait that you carry about you. At firſt I feared that ſhe came to reclaim you to herſelf; but, inſtead of that, ſhe ſmiled upon me and began to careſs me, and taking my right Hand ſhe put it into Yours. Then, aſcending in her Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe hovered awhile on high, and caſting down upon me a Look of fixed Love, ſhe gave me a Beck with her Hand, as it were to follow, and was immediately loſt in Glory.</p>
            <p>O, my dear Children, cried the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs (for ſuch ſhe was) might I but once ſee ye united, how I ſhould lift my Head! or rather how ſatisfied I ſhould be to lay it down in Peace, having nothing further to care for on this Side of Eternity.</p>
            <p>That Night I ſlept ſounder than uſual, and did not awake till the Day was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing advanced. On opening the Curtain, I ſaw <hi>James</hi> ſeated in a moody Poſture by the Side of my Bed. How are the Ladies, <hi>James?</hi> ſaid I. Gone, Sir. Gone, gone! I
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0237300105:176"/>cried out. Yes, Sir, gone indeed, but with very heavy Hearts, and Both of them drowned in Tears. Here has been a large Body of the <hi>Gens d'Armes</hi> ſent for them, ſo that there was no reſiſting. Poor <hi>Gerard</hi> went on his Knees to his Lady, to beg Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to throw himſelf at your honoured Feet, as he ſaid, and to bid you adieu, but She would not allow him. Mean time, ſhe charged me with this Watch and Ring, and this Letter for your Honour.</p>
            <p>I catched at the Letter and, tearing it open, read over and over, a thouſand Times, what will for ever be engraven in my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and on my Heart.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                  <p>WE leave you, we leave you, moſt Beloved of Men, and we are miſerable in ſo doing, but alas we are not our own Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes. My Lord, for this Time, has proved unjuſt and ungrateful; and refuſes your <hi>Louiſa,</hi> as well to my Prayers; as to your infinite Merits. He has affianced her, as it ſeems, to a Prince of the Blood, and his Ambition has blinded him to all other Conſiderations. Be not yet in Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, we ſhall exert our very utmoſt to get this injurious Sentence reverſed; and if your <hi>Louiſa</hi> inherits my Blood or Spirit, not all the Engines in <hi>France</hi> will ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel her to give her Hand to Another.

            <p>Yes, I cried, ye precious Relicks, ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Memorandums, to my Lips, to my Heart! Be ye the Companions of my Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rude, the Conſolers of my Affliction! ſooner ſhall this Arm be torn off, and Time itſelf paſs away, than One or the Other ſhall be divided from my Cuſtody.</p>
            <p>Ah, how uſeleſs are Admonitions to the Impatience of a Lover! Fervent Love can know no Fears. I was no ſooner able to ſit my Horſe than I ſet off directly for <hi>Paris,</hi> with this Precaution only, that my People
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0237300105:178"/>would call me by my Mother's maiden Name of <hi>Goodall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we knew not the Names or Titles of thoſe after whom we were in ſearch, our Eyes became our only Inquiſitors, and we daily ranged the Town, poreing into every Carriage of Diſtinction for a Sight of the Mother or Daughter; and even prying among the Lacqueys and Liveries for the Face of our Friend <hi>Gerard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On a Day, as my valiant <hi>Tirlah</hi> and I rode a broad, reconnoitring the Suburbs, we hear'd a Noiſe and a Shout of Diſtreſs that iſſued from a diſtant Farm-Houſe; and, as we haſtened up, the Tumult grew louder, and the Cry of Help! and Murder! was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Times repeated.</p>
            <p>We inſtantly knocked at the Door, but were refuſed Admittance; when <hi>Tirlah,</hi> alighting, ran againſt it and, breaking through Bars and all with his Foot, threw the Door off its Hinges.</p>
            <p>On entring, we ſaw a Man ſtretched on the Broad of his Back in the Floor, with four Others about him, who were going to uſe him very barbarouſly. Stay your Hands, I cried, I will ſhoot the firſt Man through the Head who ſhall dare to proceed in this Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0237300105:179"/>
Why Sir, ſaid a young Fellow, riſing, this Man wanted to be gracious with my pretty young Wife, I caught him in the very Attempt, and ſo I think it but fair and honeſt to ſpoil him at ſuch Sport for Time to come. Ay but, ſaid I, you might mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and I can't ſuffer that. Come, my Friend, no Harm appears to be done as yet, and if he pays a handſome Penance for the Wickedneſs of his Intention, I would adviſe you to paſs Matters over for the preſent. Say, how much do you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? Five hundred Louis d'Ors, ſaid the Fellow; if he pays that, he ſhall be quit for this Turn.</p>
            <p>Five hundred Louis d'Ors! I exclaimed; why, all the Clothes on his Back are not worth the hundredth Part of the Sum. True, Maſter, ſaid the Peaſant, winking, but his Pockets may happen to be richer than his Clothes. Well, ſaid I, if he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures you in Half the Sum, I think you may be ſatisfied. Why, Maſter, ſince you have ſaid it, I will not go back. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the aſtoniſhed Priſoner was permitted to riſe.</p>
            <p>What do you ſay, you ſad Man you, are you willing to pay this Fellow the Sum I agreed for, in Compenſation of the Injury
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0237300105:180"/>you attempted to do him? I am, Sir, ſaid he, with many Thanks for your Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then, haſtily putting his Hand to his Pocket, he took out a Note on the Cuſtoms which, with ſome ſmall Matter of Caſh, made up the Money, and we departed the Houſe together.</p>
            <p>As I was juſt going to mount, he came up and accoſted me with Elegance and Dignity. Sir, ſaid he, You have made me your Debtor, beyond Expreſſion, beyond the Power of Princes to pay. Be pleaſed however to accept the little I have about me, here are five thouſand <hi>Louis,</hi> in this little Note-Book. Not a Penny, Sir, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I am by no Means in want. You muſt not refuſe, ſaid he, ſome Token of my Acknowledgment, here is a Stone valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at double the Sum I offer'd you. Then, taking from a Pocket the Diamond Button of his Hat, he preſented it to me. You muſt excuſe me, Sir, ſaid I, I can accept of no Conſideration for doing an Action of Humanity, and I rejoice to have preſerved a Perſon of your Diſtinction and Generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I then turned my Horſe, and, tho' he called after me, I rode away, being neither deſirous of knowing or being known.</p>
            <p>My Reſearches hitherto being altogether fruitleſs, I imagined I might, with better
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0237300105:181"/>Likelihood, meet my Beloved, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Walks, public Theatres, or Rooms of diſtinguiſhed Reſort.</p>
            <p>One Night, as I ſat alone in a ſide Box at the Opera, intently gazing and hungering around for ſome Similitude of my <hi>Louiſa;</hi> there entered One of the lovelieſt young Fellows I ever beheld. He careleſly threw himſelf beſide me, looked around; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew his Eyes; and then looked at me with ſuch a long and piercing Inquiſition as alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and gave me Cauſe to think I was diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Though the <hi>French</hi> ſeldom heſitate, he ſeemed at once backward and deſirous of accoſting me. At length he entered upon Converſe touching the Drama and the Muſic, and ſpoke with Judgment and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance ſuperior to the Matter; while I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd him with due Complacence, but in a Manner that partook of that Regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs for Trifles which then ſat at my Heart.</p>
            <p>Between the Acts, he turned and caſt his Eye ſuddenly on me. Sir, ſays he, do you believe that there is ſuch a Thing as Sympathy? Occaſionally, Sir, I think it may have its Effect, though I can't credit all the Wonders that are reported of it. I am ſorry for that, ſaid he, as I ardently
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0237300105:182"/>wiſh that your Feelings were the ſame as mine at this Inſtant. I never ſaw you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Sir, I have no Knowledge of you, and yet I declare that, were I to chooſe an Advocate in Love, a Second in Combat, or a Friend in Extremity, You, You are the very Man upon whom I would pitch.</p>
            <p>I anſwered not, but ſeized his Hand and preſſed it to my Boſom. I conceive, Sir, continued he, notwithſtanding your Fluency in the Language, that you are not a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. My Name is <hi>D'Aubigny,</hi> I live at ſuch a Place, and, if you will do me the Pleaſure of a ſingle Viſit, all the Honours, Reſpects, and Services, that our Houſe can confer, ſhall be yours without Reſerve. Sir, ſaid I, I am of <hi>England,</hi> my Name is <hi>Goodall,</hi> and as ſoon as a certain Affair allows me to admit of any Acquaintance in <hi>Paris,</hi> You ſhall be the firſt Elected of my Arms and my Heart.</p>
            <p>In a few Nights after, as <hi>Tirlah</hi> and I were turning a Corner of the <hi>Rue de St. Jaques,</hi> we ſaw three Men, with their Backs to the Wall, attacked by nearly three times their Number. We did not heſitate a Moment what Part to take. At the firſt Paſs, I ran one of the Aſſaſſins through the Body; <hi>Tirlah</hi> levelled Two more with his oaken Staff, and the reſt took to Flight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0237300105:183"/>
Gentlemen, ſaid One of the Three, I thank you for this brave and ſeaſonable Aſſiſtance.—<hi>Roche,</hi> run for a Surgeon, I am wounded, I doubt, dangerouſly.—<hi>Pierre,</hi> lend me your Arm—Come, Gentlemen, we have but a little Way to my Houſe.</p>
            <p>Though the Night was too dark for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining Features, I thought that the Voice was not quite unknown to me. Within a few Minutes we arrived at a Palace that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, inward, from the Houſes that were ranged on either Hand On pulling the Hanger of a Bell, the great Door opened upon a ſumptuous Hall, which led to a Parlour, enlightened by a ſilver Sconce that hung from the Vaulting.</p>
            <p>As we enter'd, the Maſter turned ſhort upon me, and looking full in my Face, and ſtarting and lifting his Hands in Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, Great Ruler of Events! he cried, the very Man I wiſhed my Brother and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion thro' Life, and this is the very Man You have ſent to my Reſcue!</p>
            <p>Juſt then the Surgeon arrived, and I hear'd him haſtily aſking where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis was. On entering, he ſaid, I'm ſorry for your Misfortune, my Lord, but Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may be better than we apprehend.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0237300105:184"/>And immediately he took out his Caſe of Inſtruments. One of the Ruffians, ſaid the Marquis, before I was aware, came behind and ran me through the Back.</p>
            <p>The Surgeon then tipt open his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Waſtecoat, and changed Colour on ſeeing his Shirt drenched in Blood. But, getting him quickly undreſſed, and having probed his Wound, he ſtruck his Hands together and cried, Courage, my Friends! it is only a Fleſh-buſineſs, the Weapon has paſſed clear of the Ribs and Vitals.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Marquis's Wound was dreſſed, and that we had got him to Bed, I fancy, Sir, ſaid I to the Surgeon, I may have ſome ſmall Occaſion for a Caſt of your Office, I feel a little Smart in my Sword Arm.</p>
            <p>On ſtripping, he found that a chance Thruſt had entered about Half an Inch into the Muſcle above my Elbow, and had ripped up ſome of the Skin. But, he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied the proper Dreſſing, and I was preparing to take my Leave, when the Marquis cried out, You muſt not think of parting, my dear Friend; You are the Maſter of the Maſter here, and Lord of this Houſe and of All that is in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0237300105:185"/>
The Surgeon then ordered his Lordſhip to compoſe himſelf as ſoon as poſſible; and, having wiſhed him a good Night, I ſent <hi>Tirlah</hi> to my Lodgings to let my People know that I was well and in friendly Hands. I was then conducted by the Domeſtics to a ſuperb Apartment, where a Bed was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and where a ſmall Supper of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies lay fuming on the Sideboard.</p>
            <p>Having ſwallowed a few Bits, with a Glaſs or two of Wine, I roſe and ſauntered through the Room, muſing on my <hi>Louiſa,</hi> heavily ſighing, and nearly deſpairing of being ever able to find her.</p>
            <p>Some time after, I ſat down, to undreſs and get to Bed, when a Number of the Officers of Juſtice ſilently entered my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſeiz'd my Sword that I had put off, and coming whiſperingly to me, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to accompany them, without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Noiſe.</p>
            <p>I ſaw that it was Madneſs to reſiſt, and, as I went with them, I obſerved that two of the Family Liveries had joined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Officers. It then inſtantly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred that I was in the Houſe of my Rival; that the Marquis was the very Perſon to whom my <hi>Louiſa</hi> had been deſtined; that I was ſomehow diſcovered; and that they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0237300105:186"/>were conducting me to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> of which I had hear'd as many affrighting Stories as are uſually told of the Inquiſition.</p>
            <p>Ah, Traitor, ſaid I to myſelf, is it thus you ſerve the Man who but now ſaved your Life at the Expence of his own Blood? Let no One hereafter truſt to the bleating of the Lamb or the courting of the Turtle; the roaring of the Lion, and the Pounces of the Vulture, may thus deceitfully lurk under the One and the Other.</p>
            <p>After paſſing ſome Streets, they took me to a large Houſe, where dwelt One of their chief Magiſtrates, being alſo a Member of their Parliament. Having knocked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully at the Gate and waited ſome Time, at length we were admitted, and they took me to a kind of Lobby, where we ſtaid, while One of the Poſſe went to adviſe the Juſticiary of my Attendance. At length he returned and, accoſting me in a Tone of ſurly and diſcouraging Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Friend, ſays he, my Lord is engaged and not at Leiſure to Night; To-morrow, perhaps, he may hear what you have to plead in your own Defence. So ſaying, he and his Fellows thruſt me into a waſte Room, and locked and chained the Door upon me, and, laughing, bid me to warm or cool my Heels at Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0237300105:187"/>
Fool, Fool that I was, ſaid I, to quit the Side of my brave and faithful Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, how quickly ſhould we have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited this Magiſtrate and all his Hoſt! but I muſt be a Knight Adventurer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, and draw my Sword in the Defence of every Scoundrel who goes the Street.</p>
            <p>I then went and felt the Windows, to try if I could force a Paſſage for making my Eſcape; but, finding that all were grated with ſtrong and impaſſable Bars of Iron; O, I cried, that this Marquis, this ungrateful <hi>D'Aubigny</hi> were now in his fuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Strength and oppoſed to me, Point to Point, that I might reclaim from him, in an Inſtant, the Life I have given!</p>
            <p>I then traverſed the Room with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent Pace, now raſhly reſolving on furious Events; and again more ſedately deliberating on what I had to do. Till, having ruminated thus for the Remainder of the Night, I at laſt became more at Eaſe, and reſigned myſelf to the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of All-diſpoſing Providence, though, I confeſs, with a gloomy and reluctant Kind of Content.</p>
            <p>When the Day appeared and was ſomething advanced, I hear'd my Door
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0237300105:188"/>unlocking and the Chain taking away, and I concluded that they came to ſummon me to my Tryal. But, inſtead of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Juſtice, I ſaw near twenty Men in the Marquis's Livery, who ſilently bowed down before me, and reſpectfully ſhewed me, with their Hand, the Way out of my Priſon. I followed them alſo in Silence, and getting into the Street, I wiſhed to know if I was really free, and turned from them down the Way that led to my Lodgings; whereupon they caſt themſelves before me, and, in a ſupplicating Poſture, beſought me to go with them.</p>
            <p>Finding then that I was ſtill their Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I gave a longing Look out for my valiant Fellows; but, as they did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, I ſuffered myſelf to be reconducted to the Marquis's Palace, and followed my obſequious Commanders into the proud Apartment, to which they had led me the preceding Night, and where, bowing to the Ground, they all left me and retired.</p>
            <p>As I had been much fatigued in Body and Mind, I threw myſelf on the Bed, leaving Events to their Iſſues, and fell into a Kind of ſtarting and intermitting Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when I heard a Voice, at my Side, ſhout out, in once loved Accents, O, my deareſt Mamma, it is He, indeed, 'tis he, it is he himſelf!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0237300105:189"/>
On this I awoke, and rouzed myſelf, and lifting my languid Eyes, and fixing them on the Object that ſtood before me; and are you then, I cried, are you alſo, <hi>Louiſa,</hi> in the Confederacy againſt me?—Say nothing, you are not the <hi>Louiſa</hi> I once knew.—I will ariſe, I will go forth, not all your Gates and Bars and Bolts ſhall hold me, I will tear my Body and my Soul too, if poſſible, from you for ever!—Go to your Betrothed, to your Beloved! and leave me to periſh, it is a Matter of no Import—I am yet pleaſed that I ſaved your Choſen; as it may one Day ſerve to reproach you with the Merits of the Man whom he has ſo unworthily treated!</p>
            <p>I could no more. A long Silence on all Sides enſued, ſave the Language that was uttered by Heavings and Sobbings. When the Marchioneſs, coming and caſting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on her Knees by my Bed; you have Reaſon, Sir, ſhe exclaimed, you have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reproach and to deteſt every Branch of our ungrateful Family for ever! you ſaved myſelf, you ſaved my Daughter, and yet the Father and the Huſband proved averſe to your Deſervings, and turned your Benefits into Poiſon. You have now ſaved our Son, the only One who can convey our Name to Poſterity, and yet,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0237300105:190"/>from the Beginning, you have received nothing in Return, ſave Wounds, Pains and Sickneſs, Loſſes, Damages and Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, and, at this very Day, the moſt ignominious Uſage, where you merited end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Thanks and everlaſting Renown. Blame my <hi>Louiſa</hi> then, and me, but blame not my Son, Sir, for theſe unworthy Events; he is quite innocent of them, he is ſhocked and diſtracted by them; he reſpects and loves you more than ever <hi>Jonathan</hi> loved the Son of <hi>Jeſſe.</hi> But he will not, he dare not ſee you, till we have, in ſome Meaſure, made his Peace.</p>
            <p>How, Madam! I cried,—but, no more of that Poſture, it pains me paſt bearing—Is it a Fact, can it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Marquis <hi>D'aubigny</hi> ſhould be your Son? Is he not of the Blood royal, the very Rival whom your Letter rendered ſo formidable to me? and, was it not by his Order that I was diſgracefully confined in a Dungeon all Night?</p>
            <p>No, no, ſaid my Lady, he would have ſuffered the Rack firſt. He is in Deſpair, quite inconſolable on that Account. Let us go, my deareſt <hi>Harry,</hi> let us go and carry Comfort to him of whom you are the Beloved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0237300105:191"/>
Ah no, my Mamma, cried out <hi>Louiſa,</hi> let us put no Conſtraint on Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> I pray you! there has been enough of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, we leave him now to his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; let him go, even where, and to whom he likes beſt. Once, indeed, we could have tied this all-conquering Champion with the Spinning of a Silkworm; but now he tells us that neitheir Gates, Bars, not Bolts ſhall hold him to us.</p>
            <p>Here, I threw myſelf precipitately at her Feet, Pardon, pardon, my <hi>Louiſa,</hi> I cried, O pardon the miſdeeming Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports of your Lover, and pardon the Faults that Love alone could commit. My Enemies are foreign to me, they and their Injuries affect me not; but you are Regent within, my <hi>Louiſa,</hi> you ſit throned in my Heart, and the Preſumption of an Offence from you makes ſtrange Uproar in my Soul. Well, ſays ſhe, reaching her Hand and ſmiling through Tears, ſince it is ſo, poor Soul, here is the golden Sceptre for you, I think I muſt take you to Mercy.</p>
            <p>I caught her Hand, and impreſſed my very Spirit on the Wax, and my Lady, caſting her Arms about us, and kiſſing us both, in Turns, requeſted that we ſhould
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0237300105:192"/>go and carry ſome Conſolation to her dear repining <hi>Lewis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we entered his Chamber, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs cried out, here he comes, my Son, we have brought your Beloved to you, yet not your Mr. <hi>Goodall,</hi> as you thought, but One who is, at once, both your Good Angel and our good Angel, even our own <hi>Harry Clinton,</hi> the Betrothed of our Souls.</p>
            <p>I took my Seat on the Side of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis's Bed, and looking fondly upon him, would have enquired of his Health, but my Speech for the Time was overpowered by my Affections. Then, taking my Hand in his, the Power of this Hand, ſays he, I have found to be great, but, has your Heart the Power to pardon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults and Outrage you have received in the Houſe of him who is ſo deeply your Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? My Lord, ſaid I, I have already drank largely of <hi>Lethe</hi> on that Head; nothing but my Diffidence of your Regard can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me.</p>
            <p>You know not, ſaid my Lady, you know not yet, my dear <hi>Harry,</hi> how this provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Buſineſs came about. I will explain it in a few Words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0237300105:193"/>
On our Return to <hi>Paris,</hi> and on our Remonſtrances to my late Lord of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Services you had rendered to his Family, he enquired your Character among the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and, notwithſtanding the Report of the Nobility of your Birth and your yet nobler Qualities, hearing alſo that you had acquired Part of your Fortune in Trade, he conceived an utter Contempt for you, and took an utter Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to you.</p>
            <p>Some Time after, as he took Notice that <hi>Louiſa</hi> and I wanted our Watch and our Ring, I dreaded his Diſpleaſure, and gave him Room to think that the Robbers had taken them from us in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and this Report became current among our Domeſtics.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time my Lord became importunate with our <hi>Louiſa,</hi> reſpecting her Marriage with the Prince of <hi>C</hi>—who was then with the Army, and her Prayers and Tears, hitherto, had been the only Artillery which ſhe had uſed in her Defence. But, when the Couriers brought Word that the Prince was on his Return, my Lord ſent for <hi>Louiſa,</hi> and gave her inſtant and abſolute Orders to prepare for her Nuptials. But ſhe, full as poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and peremptorily, replied that her Soul
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0237300105:194"/>was already wedded, that ſhe would never proſtitute her Body where her Heart was an Alien, and that all the Tortures of the Inquiſition ſhould not change her Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Her Father, thereupon, roſe to ſuch ungovernable Fury, that, with one Blow of his Hand he ſtruck her ſenſeleſs to his Feet. But, when he ſaw my Lamb, my Darling, all pale and as dead before him, the Tide of Nature returned, and the Conflict of his Paſſions became ſo violent, that an Impoſtume broke in his Stomach, and, falling, he was ſuffocated, and expired on the Spot.</p>
            <p>Soon after, the Prince arrived. He had never ſeen my Daughter, but his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to poſſeſs a Beauty of whom the grand Monarch, himſelf, was ſaid to have been enamoured, had cauſed him to demand her in Marriage. For that Purpoſe he alſo did us the Honour of a Viſit. <hi>Louiſa</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to appear; and I told his Highneſs, with the beſt Grace I could, that ſhe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be pre-engaged. In a few Days after, he met my Son in the <hi>Thuilleries</hi> and accoſted him to the ſame Intent, but my Son had been previouſly prejudiced in your Favour, my <hi>Harry,</hi> and anſwered the Prince with ſo cold or ſo haughty an Air, that further Words enſued, they both drew, and his Highneſs was ſlightly wounded,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0237300105:195"/>but, as Company interpoſed, the Affair was huſhed up and, ſhortly after, the Prince was killed in a nightly Broil upon the <hi>Pont neuf.</hi> We then wrote to our Friend <hi>De Wit</hi> to advertiſe you of theſe Matters, and to haſten you hither; but you arrived, my Child, you arrived before there could be any Expectation of an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Two Days ago, as I obſerved that my Lamb's Spirits were ſomething dejected, I prevailed upon her to take an Airing to our Country Villa. On our Return this Morning, we were ſtruck half dead with the News that our <hi>Lewis</hi> was wounded and dangerouſly ill in his Bed. We flew into his Room, and were ſtill more alarmed to find him in a Fury that is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, while <hi>Jacome,</hi> his old Steward, was on his Knees, all pale and quaking at a Diſtance before him. Villain, he cried, what have you done with my Friend, what have you done with my Champion, the Preſerver of my Life? — Pleaſe your Lordſhip, ſaid he, trembling, I took him for a Highwayman, I ſaw my Lady's Ring and my young Miſtreſs's Watch in his Cuſtody, I will ſwear to the Property be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſo I lodged him in Priſon — till — till —</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0237300105:196"/>
Go, Wretch, cried my Son, recall your Information, take all your Fellows with you, and inſtantly bring me back my Friend, or your Ears ſhall be the Forfeit, but conduct him to his own Chamber, I cannot yet bear to ſee him, I cannot bear the Reproach that his Eye muſt caſt upon me.</p>
            <p>All afflicted, and yet more aſtoniſhed, my <hi>Louiſa</hi> and I ſat down by the Side of my Son, caſting Looks of Surpriſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Doubt on Each Other. At length I ſaid, what is this that I hear of our Ring, and our Watch? Alas, he is no Highway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who took them from us, they were our own free Gift, a Mite in Return for a Million of Services. But do you know any thing of the Poſſeſſor? I know, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Lewis,</hi> that he is the lovelieſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the Preſerver of my Life, and that his Name is <hi>Goodall.</hi> Ah! ſcreamed out <hi>Louiſa,</hi> there we are loſt again; this <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> muſt certainly have murdered our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Clinton,</hi> and poſſeſſed himſelf of our Gifts, he would never have parted with them while he had Life. O my Siſter, ſaid my Son, when you ſee my Friend <hi>Goodall</hi> you will think nothing of your <hi>Harry Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> why, why were you ſo haſty, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate in your Choice? a Robber, a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer? no. Had I a thouſand Lives, I would
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0237300105:197"/>pawn them all for the Probity that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has made apparent in the Face of my Preſerver.</p>
            <p>It is with Shame and great Reluctance, my deareſt Brother, that, at Times, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Paſſages tending ſo much to my own Praiſe; and yet, did I omit them, I ſhould do great Injuſtice to the kind and amiable Partiality of Thoſe who were ſo fondly my Lovers and my Beloved.</p>
            <p>But, Madam, ſaid I to the Marchioneſs, did you not hint ſomething of his Majeſty's being enamoured of my <hi>Louiſa?</hi> Ah, ſuch a Rival would be a terrible Buſineſs indeed, eſpecially in a Country of unlimited Power.</p>
            <p>There is no Fear of that now, ſaid my Lady. The King has changed his Fancy, from young Miſtreſſes and old Counſellors, to young Counſellors and old Miſtreſſes. But, what I mentioned was once very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and alarming.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Louiſa</hi> was ſcarce turned of fourteen, when the Dutcheſs <hi>de Choiſſeul</hi> requeſted her Company to <hi>Marlay</hi> where the Court then was. The King fixed his Eye on her and enquired who ſhe was, but took no further Notice at that Time. Miſſing her, however, at the next, and again at
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0237300105:198"/>the following Drawing-Room, he aſked the Marquis what became of his fair Daughter, ſaid he had a Place in his Eye for her, and deſired, in an Accent of Authority, that he would ſend her to Court.</p>
            <p>The Marquis inſtantly took the Alarm. He was ever jealous of his Honour, and ſingularly nice in Matters of female Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. He gave his Majeſty a Sort of equivocal Conſent, and, hurrying Home, ordered me directly to prepare for carrying my Daughter out of the <hi>French</hi> Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Night was employed in haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and packing. We diſguiſed our <hi>Louiſa</hi> in the Manner as you ſaw her metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſed at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and ſet off for <hi>Holland</hi> before Day. The reſt you know, my <hi>Clinton,</hi> as You were the principal Mover in all our Concerns. — But, tell me, my <hi>Lewis,</hi> can you conjecture on what Account thoſe Aſſaſſins ſet upon you? — I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, Madam, ſaid the Marquis, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; perhaps they miſtook me for Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or, now I recollect, it might be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome familiar Chat which I had, the other Night, with a pretty Opera Girl, who is ſaid to be in the keeping of a very great Man. But, Madam, you forgot to tell my Brother how my Father was baniſhed, on Account of <hi>Louiſa,</hi> to his paternal Seat in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> on the Borders of the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean.</hi> Very true, ſaid the Marchioneſs,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0237300105:199"/>and was not recalled till Madame <hi>Maintenon</hi> was taken into ſupreme Favour.</p>
            <p>But, I wonder what is become of our faithful <hi>Gerard,</hi> I thought that he would have been the firſt to come and to throw himſelf at the Feet of his Hero. Indeed, my <hi>Harry,</hi> he would have tired Any, who loved you leſs, with his Praiſes and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual talking of you and your Exploits. — O, here he comes. — Step in, <hi>Gerard.</hi> Is there any One in this Company that you remember, beſide the Family?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gerard</hi> then advanced with a half-frantic Aſpect, and kneeling, and grappling at my Hand, ſeemed deſirous of devouring it. God be praiſed, he cried, God be praiſed, my noble my glorious Maſter, that I ſee you once again, and above all that I have the Bleſſing of ſeeing you in a Place, where a Throne of beaten Gold ſhould be raiſed to your Honour. O, had I been here, all Sorts of Reſpects and Worſhips, inſtead of Indignities, ſhould have been paid to your Deſervings But, I have provided for the Hangdog <hi>Jacome,</hi> I have tied him Neck and Heels, and tumbled him into the dark Vault.</p>
            <p>Ay, ſaid I, but, my good Friend <hi>Gerard,</hi> I have not yet got my Share of Satisfaction upon him, pray ſhew me where he is. I
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0237300105:200"/>then followed <hi>Gerard</hi> to the Place where the deplorable Wretch was caſt; and, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all his Cords, I led him back to the Company, and warmly joined his Petition for Pardon and Reſtoration.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as <hi>Jacome</hi> and <hi>Gerard</hi> were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn. Ah, my Brother, cried the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, what new Name ſhall we find for a Man of your new Character? Moreover, what ſhall we do with you, what ſhall we do for you? You have quite overpower'd us, we ſink, we drown under the Senſe of our Obligations. We have nothing worth your Acceptance, ſave this ſimple Wench, and what is She in Compariſon of what we owe you? Ah, I cried, She is That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom all Things are nothing; She is the living Treaſure, the <hi>Rachel</hi> of <hi>Rachels;</hi> ſeventy times ſeven Years were too ſhort a Service for her! I would not exchange this little pearly Joint of this very little Finger for all the Gems that glow in the Mines of <hi>India,</hi> and ſo ſaying, I preſſed the precious Finger with my Lips; while <hi>Louiſa</hi> turned upon me an Eye of ſuch ineffable Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and melting Acknowledgment, as ſunk upon my Soul and wrapt it in <hi>Elyſium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ay but, my <hi>Harry,</hi> ſaid the Marquis, you ought not to prize your <hi>Louy</hi> as much as me; She did not fall in love with you at
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0237300105:201"/>firſt Sight as I did. How do you know that, honeſt Friend, cried <hi>Louiſa.</hi> Is there a Neceſſity that our Tongues as well as our Bluſhes ſhould be Telltales? Are Maidens to trumpet forth their Thoughts, like You broad fronted Men, <hi>whoſe Ornament is your Boldfacedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus happy, above All ſtiled happy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, we joyed and lived in Each Other, continuing a mutual Commerce of delightful Senſibilities and Love for Love.</p>
            <p>Alas, our bliſsful Junto was ſoon to be broken in upon. In a few Days, One of the royal Pages came and intimated to the Marchioneſs that his Majeſty required her immediate Preſence at Court. And we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in a Kind of fearful and fluctuating Suſpenſe, till her Return.</p>
            <p>As She entered, the Conſternation in her Countenance inſtantly ſtruck an Alarm to all our Hearts. O, my Children, my dear, my dear Children, we muſt part, ſhe cried, and that too, ſpeedily. Our Hour of Bliſs is paſt, our Sunſhine is over, and the Clouds gather thick upon us, heavy laden with Wretchedneſs. Alas, my Heart miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave me ever ſince that inauſpicious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the other Morning. As we came from our Villa a great Funeral met us (a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0237300105:202"/>bad Omen as I have heard) Our Carriage ſtopped to let them paſs, and the Carriage of the Duke of <hi>Ne—rs</hi> drove up beſide us. As we remained within a few Paces of each other, he gazed at <hi>Louiſa</hi> with ſuch an unmanner'd Intenſeneſs, as cauſed her to colour and turn aſide. However, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted us not, nor enquired concerning us; it ſeems our Arms and Livery were too ſure an Indication of our Name and Quality. In ſhort, on my approaching the Preſence, the King affected to ſmile very graciouſly upon me, and ſaid, I have provided, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, a noble and princely Huſband for your Daughter; it is the Duke of <hi>Ne—rs.</hi> Ah, I cried, bending my Knee in a ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Poſture, my Daughter is already engaged by Bands of the moſt endearing and indiſſoluble Obligations, to a Man who has preſerved the Lives and Honours of all our Family, to a Man who, I truſt, by his eminent Courage and Qualities, will become the brighteſt Jewel in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Crown. Madam, ſaid he ſeverely, you muſt withdraw your Election, I find I have ordered Matters ſuperior to your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but my Will is the Law here, and ſhall be obeyed. I roſe, dejectedly curtſied, and withdrew without Reply.</p>
            <p>Ah, I exclaimed, on what Summit does this Rival hold his Abode? I will inſtantly
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0237300105:203"/>go and ſcale it, and at once put an End to his Life and his Pretenſions! My Lady then, throwing her Arms about my Neck, and preſſing her Lips to my Cheek, what Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, ſays ſhe, is this, my <hi>Harry?</hi> would you at once fight the Duke, and the King, and the whole Army of <hi>France?</hi> No, my Child, Prudence reduces us to more ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, however deplorable Meaſures. We muſt part, my <hi>Harry,</hi> we muſt part this very Night, and my <hi>Louiſa</hi> muſt depart with you. My Chaplain ſhall, this Minute, unite you by Ties that Death alone can ſunder. Alas, my precious Babes, I little expected that your Nuptials ſhould be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by Tears and Wailings! But, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe than no Nuptials. When You are once joined I ſhall care little for myſelf. And, if we meet no more here, we may yet meet hereafter, as happily as the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians who tear us aſunder.</p>
            <p>The Chaplain was then ſummoned and, having performed his Office, no Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations nor Salutations enſued, ſave a Kiſs and a Sigh of mine on the Hand of my Angel. The Marquis then called me, and drawing me down to him, he preſſed me ardently to his Boſom, cried O my <hi>Harry,</hi> O my <hi>Harry!</hi> burſt into Tears and diſmiſs'd me.</p>
         </div>

            <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0237300105:204"/>
            <p>Mean while, all was in Buſtle and Hurry throughout the Palace. No Feſtival was prepared, no Bridal Bed laid. Horſes, Arms, and Carriages were all the Cry, and the Marchioneſs, with an anguiſhing Heart, but amazing Reſolution, iſſued her Orders with a Preſence of Mind that ſeemed ſerene in the Midſt of Tempeſt.</p>
            <p>I then ſent for my brave Fellows, with Orders to double their Arms, and to double their Ammunition. They came according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It was now within three Hours of Day. All was diſpatched, all in Readineſs, the Carriages were at the Gate. Silence ſat on every Tongue and a Tear on every Cheek. I threw myſelf at my Mother's Feet, I claſped, I clung to them; ſhe wept aloud over me, but neither of us uttered a Word. When, rending myſelf away, I took my ſobbing <hi>Louiſa</hi> under my Arm, ſeated her gently in her Chariot, placed myſelf to ſupport her, and away we drove.</p>
            <p>When we got clear of the Town, and were ſpeeding on the Way, my <hi>Louiſa</hi> ſtarted and cried out, O, how faſt, how very faſt they take me from you, my Mamma! Whither, whither do they carry me, perhaps never to return, never to meet again! I anſwered not, but kiſſed her Head and drew her gently to me, and ſhe
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0237300105:205"/>ſeemed more at Eaſe. But, after a while, I felt her Agitation at my Boſom, and ſhe exclaimed, From my Birth to this Hour of Wee, my bleſſed Mamma, never was I from thoſe dear Arms of yours; ſhall I ever, ſhall I ever again behold thoſe Eyes that uſed to look with ſuch Fondneſs upon me?</p>
            <p>Here, I could no longer contain, but taking her Hands between mine, and weeping upon them, I ſaid, will you then, my Angel, are you reſolved upon breaking the Heart of your <hi>Harry?</hi> O no, ſays ſhe, no, not for Worlds upon Worlds would I break that dear and feeling Heart, the Heart of my Heart, the Heart of which I became enamoured. She then leaned her Head fondly over and, in awhile, fell faſt aſleep; while my Arms gently encircled and my Soul hovered over her, as the Wings of a Turtle over her new-begotten.</p>
            <p>When She awoke and found herſelf ſo endearingly ſituated; ſhe gave me a Look that overvalued the Ranſom of a Monarch; ſhe kiſſed my Hands, in turns, ſhe kiſſed the Skirts of my Garments. O, ſhe cried, I will endeavour, I will do my beſt to be more compoſed. I know I ought not to repine. I am too rich, too happy. I ought to wiſh for nothing more, I ought to wiſh for no One more; ſince my <hi>Harry</hi> is ſo near me, ſince I have him to myſelf. —
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0237300105:206"/>But — but — And here her lovely Lips began again to work; and the Drops that trembled in her living Brilliants could hardly be reſtrained from breaking Priſon. — Soon after, the Grief of her Heart overweighed her Spirits, and ſhe fell again aſleep into my Arms, that opened of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to receive her.</p>
            <p>On ſetting up for the Night, I rejoiced to find that my <hi>Louiſa</hi> was ſomething more alive; and that her Repoſe on the Way had greatly deducted from the Fatigue that I apprehended.</p>
            <p>When we had eaten a Bit of Supper, She looked to me and from me, with down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt Lids; and, with changing Looks and a faultring Accent began to ſay; Will you, will you permit me, my Love, to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent for a little Time, and in a very trifling Matter? Allow me only to be Governeſs for a few Days, and I promiſe that you ſhall be my ſupreme Lord and ſweet Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the reſt of my Life.</p>
            <p>I ſwear, ſaid I in a Tranſport, by that precious Head, that you are already Queen-Regent of all my Thoughts and Actions; and that, during my Exiſtence, you ſhall diſpoſe of all that I have and all that I am, at Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0237300105:207"/>
O then, ſaid ſhe, my <hi>Harry,</hi> we muſt lye apart for ſome Nights. I would not have our chaſte and bleſſed Bridal ſtained by Tears and Dirges. Nay, no Heſitation, you have ſworn that I am Ruler, and I will be obeyed.</p>
            <p>I then caſt myſelf at her Knees and, hiding my Face in her Lap, Cruel, cruel <hi>Louiſa,</hi> I cried, I find You are not yet mine. What ſhall I do to earn You? But, I will be patient, if poſſible; I would not, for the World, put the Colour of Conſtraint on the Love of my Beloved. And ſo I kiſſed her Gown, in Token of due Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
            <p>Ariſing, I called her Maids, and deſired that they would order their Miſtreſs's Chamber to be prepared, as alſo a Bed for themſelves in the ſame Apartment. I then ſecretly ordered that a Pallet ſhould be ſpread for myſelf before her outer Door, and, laying myſelf down, with my Arms at my Side, I guarded, like the Dragon of old, the precious Fruit of my <hi>Heſperia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length we reached <hi>Calais,</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent to the Beach to engage a Ship for wafting us over to the Land of Freedom and Rights, but the Wind was contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0237300105:208"/>
Mean while the Day advanced toward Evening, and my <hi>Louiſa</hi> and I ſat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Arbour of a little Pleaſure-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that lay behind the Houſe, when <hi>James</hi> came haſtening to us and cried, Hide your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Madam, for Heaven's Sake hide yourſelf! here is the Duke de <hi>Ne—rs</hi> with a large Party of the King's light Horſe.</p>
            <p>Poor <hi>Louiſa</hi> ſtarted up and attempted to fly, but She trembled and grew faint, and ſunk down again on her Seat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James</hi> ſaid I, ſtay and take care of your Miſtreſs. Then, turning with haſty Steps to the Houſe, I recommended my Spirit in a ſhort Ejaculation, and entered, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that the Duke ſhould accompany me in Death. His Highneſs was in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. I advanced fiercely toward him. So, Sir, ſays he, you have coſt us a warm Chaſe — Heavens, what do I ſee! — and, ſo crying out, he threw himſelf back into an Arm Chair, all panting, and his Aſpect working with Diſtraction and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment. — Curſed Chance! he again exclaimed, are you the Man, <hi>Clinton?</hi> — Ah, I muſt not hurt You, I ought not to injure You, but, what is then to be done? — Where have you put my <hi>Louiſa?</hi> — But, no Matter, let her not
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0237300105:209"/>appear, let me not ſee her, I could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Conſequence. — I would be juſt if I could, <hi>Clinton</hi> — O Love, O Honour, how you do diſtract me! — You refuſed my Treaſures and Jewels, <hi>Clinton,</hi> but then you have rent from me a Gem more eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable than my Dukedom — Help Saints, help Angels, help me to wreſtle with myſelf! — Honour, Virtue, Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, O, compel me to be juſt! — Tear, tear me away, while there's Strength to depart! — Adieu, <hi>Clinton,</hi> you are recompenſed; ſhould we happen to meet again, I may aſſail you without Reproach. And ſo ſaying, he roſe ſuddenly and ruſhed out of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>I then haſtened to ſeek my Love, but had ſcarce entered the Garden, when I ſaw <hi>James</hi> on his Knees before her, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to oppoſe her Way to the Houſe. But ſhe cried, away, Villain, let me paſs, they are murdering my Lord, they are murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Huſband, I will go and periſh with him: Then breaking away from him, ſhe ſhot along like a Lapwing, till, ſeeing me advancing, ſhe ſprung upon my Boſom, crying, O my <hi>Harry,</hi> O my <hi>Harry,</hi> are you ſafe, are you ſafe? and fainted away in my Arms.</p>
            <p>The reſt of my Story, my Lord, is no way material or entertaining. The Serene
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0237300105:210"/>of heart-felt Happineſs has little of Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in it, and is only intereſting to the Poſſeſſors.</p>
            <p>Having ſettled my Affairs in <hi>London,</hi> and carrying my <hi>Eden</hi> along with me, I paſſed into <hi>Holland</hi> to ſettle and be quit of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there alſo. For the World that I wiſhed was in my Holding, and all Things elſe appeared either nugatory or encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering.</p>
            <p>It was there that I met our <hi>Meekly,</hi> and taking a pleaſant Tour through the Skirts of <hi>Germany,</hi> we entered <hi>France,</hi> and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Paris</hi> on the right Hand, we reached the Marquis's Country Seat, ſituate near twenty Leagues beyond the Metropolis.</p>
            <p>What a Meeting, what an Interview! My <hi>Louiſa</hi> ſunk in Tears, for Half an Hour, on the Boſom of her Mother. And the Marquis would put me from him and pull me to him again, all panting with Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport and inſatiate of his Careſſes! It was too much of Joy, it was Pleaſure to pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Domeſtics would no longer be eſtrained from their Share of the Felicity; they ruſhed in and, as though we had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ew deſcended Divinities, they dropped on their Knees, they fell proſtrate and clung about us, kiſſed our Feet, our Hands, our
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0237300105:211"/>Garments, and broke forth into Cries, as though it had been the Houſe of Mourning and Lamentation.</p>
            <p>On retiring, they got my <hi>Louiſa</hi>'s <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> to themſelves; he now became a Man of mighty Importance among them. They crowded about him and, in a joint Voice, but a Diſtraction of Queſtions, enquired after our Travels, our Adventures, our good and evil Occurrences, and all that concerned us.</p>
            <p>The Marchioneſs then coming, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her honoured Arms around me, and weeping upon me, cried aloud, O <hi>Harry,</hi> my Son, my Son, I delivered my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to you, even as <hi>Edna</hi> committed her <hi>Sarab,</hi> of ſpecial Truſt, to <hi>Tobias,</hi> and I ſee that you have entreated her very kindly, my Son, my Son!</p>
            <p>As my <hi>Louiſa</hi> now began to be apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pregnant, I earneſtly preſſed my precious Mother and Brother to accompany us to <hi>England,</hi> the Place where Law was Regent, where there was no Apprehenſion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions or Baſtiles; and where the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant was guarded, as with a Bulwark of Adamant, againſt every Encroachment of arbitrary Power. They aſſented with Joy, and the Marquis, going to his Eſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toir, brought forth Bills to the amount
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0237300105:212"/>of ten Million of Livres, the Produce of ſome Concerns which he had diſpoſed of for the Purpoſe. Here, my Brother, ſays he, if I am not able to be grateful, if I am not able to be generous, I will at leaſt be juſt; here is the Patrimony to which my lovely Siſter is entitled. But, I ſaid to the Marquis, my <hi>Louiſa</hi> can admit of no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Value. Keep your Goods to yourſelf. Remember how <hi>Eſau</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jacob,</hi> I have enough, enough, my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, theſe Things can add nothing to the Abundance of my Bleſſings. But then, he cried, you muſt accept them, as a Token of our Loves, and ſo he conſtrained and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them upon me.</p>
            <p>Soon after, we paſſed to <hi>London,</hi> where we continued ſome Months, and where my <hi>Louiſa</hi> was delivered of my little <hi>Eloiſa,</hi> who was ſaid to be the beautiful Likeneſs of her Father.</p>
            <p>We then retired to my Seat near <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> on the fatal <hi>Avon,</hi> the chief of the landed Poſſeſſions that Mr. <hi>Golding</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed me; where we remained ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upward of five Years, happy, I think, above All that ever were happy upon Earth. For my <hi>Louiſa</hi> was perpetual Feſtivity to our Sight and to our Hearts; her Eyes beamed with living and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0237300105:213"/>Glory, her Attitudes were Grace, her Movements were Muſic, and her Smiles were Faſcination. Still varying yet exhibiting the ſame Delight, like the <hi>Northern</hi> Aurora ſhe ſhone in all Directions. And ſhe ſported as though ſhe had gone to Heaven, from Time to Time, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed all her Plays from the Kingdom of little Children.</p>
            <p>But, ſhe needed not to go to Heaven, ſince Heaven was ever in her and round about her, and that ſhe could no more move from it than ſhe could move from herſelf. She had been, from her earlieſt Years, the beloved Diſciple of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Madam <hi>Guyon;</hi> and the World, with all its Concerns, its Riches and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, had fallen off from her, as the Cloak fell away from the burning Chariot of <hi>Elijah.</hi> She looked at nothing but her Lord in all Things, ſhe loved nothing but him in any Thing. She was the ſweeteſt Playfellow that ever lived for the Babe of the Manger of <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> and he was, in her Heart, a Pleaſure paſſing Senſe, as well as a Peace that paſſed Underſtanding. Even in conjugal Endearment, her Manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and chaſtened the Senſe of Poſſeſſion and her Pudicity awed me in the Midſt of Tranſport.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0237300105:214"/>
Our Friends now prevailed upon us to accompany them, in our Turn, to <hi>France;</hi> together with our prattling <hi>Eloiſa,</hi> who was become the darling and inſeparable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of her Grandmother and her Uncle. We again took <hi>London</hi> in our Way. I there renewed, for a while, my old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with my Fellows in Trade, and they perſuaded me to join them in a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to his Majeſty for the Reſtoration of ſome of the lapſed Rights of their Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as your Lordſhip may remember.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Calais</hi> we turned and, by long but pleaſant Journeys, at length arrived at the Marquis's paternal Seat in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> that opened a delightful Proſpect on the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> And here we continued upward of five Years more, even as <hi>Adam</hi> continued in Paradiſe, compaſſed in by Bliſs, from the reſt of the World.</p>
            <p>During this happy Period I often preſſed my dear Marquis to marry, but he would take me to his Arms and ſay, O my <hi>Harry,</hi> ſhew me but the moſt diſtant Reſemblance of our <hi>Louiſa,</hi> and I will marry and be bleſſed without Delay.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, my Angel made me he joyful Father of a little Son, who was, alſo, ſaid to be the happier Reſemblance
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0237300105:215"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0237300105:217"/>of his happy Father. Then, though I had long diſregarded the World and all its Concerns, as I ſaw a Family encreaſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and alſo conſidered the Poor as my appointed and ſpecial Creditors; I reſolved once more to return and ſettle my long ſuſpended Accounts.</p>
            <p>As for the Marchioneſs, ſhe proteſted that ſhe could not think of parting with her little <hi>Eloiſa,</hi> and that ſhe ſhould not be able to ſurvive her Abſence ten Days. So my <hi>Louiſa</hi> and I, and my little <hi>Richard,</hi> who was named after you, my Lord, ſet out by Sea and, after a favourable Voyage, arrived in <hi>England;</hi> comforted however with the Promiſe that our Friends would join us as ſoon as poſſible in <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within the ten ſubſequent Months, we received the joyful Tidings that our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was married to the Third Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Alenſon,</hi> that they were all in the higheſt Triumph, and would ſpeedily be with us in a joint Jubilate on the Banks of the <hi>Avon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after, as my <hi>Louiſa</hi> and I rode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the River, pleaſing ourſelves with the Proſpect of a ſpeedy Union with Perſons ſo dear to us, and talking and laughing away at the Cares of the Covetous and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0237300105:218"/>of the High-minded; a Fowler inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently fired a Shot behind us; and my Horſe, bounding aloft, plunged with me into the Current, from whence however I was taken, and unwillingly reſerved to Years of inexpreſſible Miſery, of a Miſery that admitted not of a Drop of Conſolation.</p>
            <p>Mean while my Love had fallen, with a Shriek, from her Horſe and lay ſenſeleſs on the Sod. Some of my People flew back, and bringing a Carriage conveyed us gently home, where my <hi>Louiſa</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed and put into a Bed, from whence ſhe never roſe. Her Fright had given ſuch a Shock to her Blood and Spirits as threw her into a violent Fever.</p>
            <p>On the ſecond Day, while I ſat with the Phyſicians by her Side, <hi>James</hi> put in his Head and beckoned me forth. Ah, my deareſt Maſter, ſays he, I pray God to give you the Strength and Patience of <hi>Job;</hi> you have great Need of them, for your Calamities, like his, come All in a Heap upon you. Here is a Meſſenger diſpatched from <hi>France</hi> with very heavy Tidings, that my ſweet young Lady, your darling <hi>Eloiſa,</hi> was caſt away, in a Sloop, upon a Party of Pleaſure, and that the good old Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did not outlive her five Days. Then lifting my Eyes to Heaven, Strip, ſtrip me,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0237300105:219"/>my God, I cried, to the Skin, to the Bone, leave, leave but my <hi>Louiſa,</hi> and I will bleſs thy Diſpenſations!</p>
            <p>On the next Day, my little <hi>Dickey</hi> was taken ill of a ſevere Cold that he caught, through want of due Attention during the Sickneſs of his Mother. As he was of a florid Complexion, his Diſorder fell ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in an Inflammation, on his Lungs, and in leſs than twenty-four Hours, he went to join his little Brother and Siſters in their Eternity. Did I not feel theſe Loſſes? Yes, yes, my Friends; they wrung, they rent my Vitals. Yet I ſtill lifted my Heart in an eager Prayer, and repeatedly cried, Take, take All, even the laſt Mite, leave, leave me but my <hi>Louiſa,</hi> and I will bleſs thee, O my Creator!</p>
            <p>Alas, what could this avail! Can an Inſect arreſt the Motion whereby the round Univerſe continues its Courſe? On the fifth Day I perceived that the Eyes of my <hi>Louiſa,</hi> the Lamps of my Life, began to loſe their Luſtre. The Breath that was the Balm of all my Cares and Concerns grew difficult and ſhort. The Roſes of my Summer died away on her Cheek. All agonizing, I felt and participated her Changes, and ſhe expired, while I dropt and lay ſenſeleſs beſide her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0237300105:220"/>
I knew not what our People did with her or me afterward. For three Weeks I lay in a Kind of doſing but uneaſy Stupor; neither do I recollect, during that Period, when, or whether I received any Kind of Suſtenance.</p>
            <p>At length I awoke to the Poignancy and Bitterneſs of my Situation. I did not awake to Life, but rather to the blackeſt Gloom of the Regions of Death. And yet it was from this Depth and enfolding of Death alone, that my Soul could find, or would accept an Alleviation of its Anguiſh.</p>
            <p>O Earth, I cried, where is thy Centre, how deeply am I ſunk beneath it! How are the Worms exalted over me! How much higher are the noxious Reptiles that crawl upon Earth! I will not accuſe thee, thou great Diſpoſer, I have had my Day, the ſweeteſt that ever was allotted to Man; but O, thy paſt Bleſſings ſerve only to enhance my preſent Miſeries, and to render me the moſt accurſed of all thy Creatures.</p>
            <p>I then roſe, and threw myſelf along the Floor; and my faithful and valiant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions immediately gathered to me. But, finding that I would not be removed, they caſt themſelves around me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0237300105:221"/>
All Light was ſhut out, ſave the Glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of a Taper, and for ſeven Nights and ſeven Days we dwelt in Silence, except the ſolemn Interruptions of ſmothered Sobs and Wailings.</p>
            <p>At length my Spirit reproved me. What Property, ſaid I to myſelf, have theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in my Sufferings, or why ſhould I bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thoſe who love me with my Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? I then conſtrained myſelf and went and took out a Drawer. Here, my Friends, I ſaid, here is ſomething that may help hereafter to dry up your Tears. Divide theſe Thouſands among ye; neither theſe Counters nor your Services are now of further Uſe. Fare ye well, fare ye well, my worthy and beloved Brothers! God will give you a more gracious Maſter, but—but—ſuch another Miſtreſs ye ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver—never will find! I then took Each of them to my Arms, and kiſſed them, in turns, and the Houſe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly filled with heart-tearing Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>I now expected and wiſhed to be left wholly alone, but <hi>James</hi> and two Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics remained againſt my Will. I then endeavoured to ſeem eaſy, I even ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled to appear chearful, that I might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the leſs of Grief to the voluntary
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0237300105:222"/>Sharers in my Miſery. O World, World, I ſaid to myſelf, thou once pleaſant World, we have now bid a long an eternal Adieu to Each Other! From thee I am cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thou art annihilated to me, and we mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually reject every Kind of future Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
            <p>Ah, how much deeper was my Death than that of thoſe in the Tomb, <hi>where the Wicked ceaſe from troubling, and where the Weary are at Reſt.</hi> While I was dead to every Reliſh of Light and of Life, I was wholly alive to all the Gloom and Horrors of the Grave. The Rays of the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an Offence to my Soul, the Verdure of the Fields, the whole Bloom of Nature were blaſted and blaſting to my Sight; and I wiſhed to ſink yet deeper, and to own a lower Bottom to myſelf of Darkneſs and Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>I no longer regarded what the World thought of me, or what it did to me, and I left my Hairs and my Nails, even as thoſe of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> to grow like Eagle's Feathers and Birds Claws.</p>
            <p>My Friend <hi>James,</hi> in the mean Time, took a Place for me in this Town, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to remove me from Scenes that could only ſerve to perpetuate or aggravate my
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0237300105:223"/>Miſery, by reminding me of the Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that I had once enjoyed.</p>
            <p>He was now become my Controuler. I was patient and paſſive to any Thing, to every Thing, and ſo he conducted me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I neither knew nor cared how.</p>
            <p>In all this Time, though I panted after a State of Inſenſibility, even as a Traveller, in the burning Deſart, thirſts after a cool and ſlaking Stream. I never attempted to lay a violating Hand on the Work of my Creator. I did not even wiſh an Alleviation of my Miſery, ſince my God had appointed that I ſhould be ſo very miſerable.</p>
            <p>At length, my Spirit roſe from its Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to a Kind of calm Twilight. I called for a Bible and, ſince this World was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of a Drop of Conſolation, I wiſhed to know if the next had Any in Store.</p>
            <p>As I read, the Whole of the Letter, and of the Facts contained therein, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſo many Seals and Veils that remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from before my Eyes, and diſcovered Depths under Depths, and Heavens above Heavens to my amazed Apprehenſion. I had no Viſion, no Revelation of theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but the Conviction was impreſſed as ſtrongly on my Soul, as though an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0237300105:224"/>or God himſelf had revealed them to me.</p>
            <p>How this came to paſs I know not; <hi>Homer</hi> gives to his Heroes a Sight into Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity at the Time that their Spirits are breaking away from the Shackles of Fleſh and Blood. And it is not unlikely that the Eye of the Soul when wholly turned from all carnal and earthly Objects, can pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate with the greater Scope and Clarity into Concerns that are merely celeſtial and divine.</p>
            <p>I have now told ye the Whole of my dreary Hiſtory, my Friends, till I met with our <hi>Harry,</hi> and the reſt our <hi>Harry</hi> can tell.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Harry</hi> was in no Manner of Vein, at preſent, for entertaining or receiving Entertainment from any One. His Eyes were ſwelled with weeping, his Spirits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally depreſſed, and getting up, as with the Burden of fourſcore Years on his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he retired ſlowly and ſilently to his Apartment.</p>
            <p>Here, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> took the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Hero's Abſence, to appriſe the Company of what had paſſed reſpecting the fair <hi>Aggy Jeſſamin.</hi> And why, my dear <hi>Meekly,</hi> ſaid the Earl, why would you
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0237300105:225"/>baulk my Boy? I would rather than fifty thouſand broad Pieces get any Offspring of my <hi>Harry</hi> into my Arms, however little it might be, legitimate or illegitimate. He is a glorious Fellow, he cannot be debaſed by marrying a Kitchen Wench, although his Alliance would ennoble a Princeſs. What's your Opinion, Brother? Indeed, ſaid Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> if the Girl is virtuous, as her Countenance promiſes, I have no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> inſtantly went, with theſe indulgent Tidings to <hi>Harry,</hi> but he ſhook his Head, and ſaid, No no, my Friend, I will not abuſe their Goodneſs. Beſide, ſince I hear'd the Story of my Uncle's <hi>Louiſa,</hi> my Paſſion is not quite ſo violent. I have formed a perfect Idea of the Bride I would wiſh; and, if I get not ſome One anſwering to the Image in my Heart, I will go unmarried to my Tomb. Yet, as I ſtill ardently love the ſweet Girl, I would not for the World riſque the Temptation of a Meeting with her; and I am willing to pay roundly for her Removal. Be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then, my dear Friend, to ſettle this Matter with her Father, the ſtipulated Sum ſhall be ready, on Demand, to any Amount that you pleaſe, if they may ſerve to promote her Happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0237300105:226"/>
On the next Day, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> introduced to <hi>Harry</hi> a tall and comely young Man in a peaſant Dreſs, but of an Air and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment much ſuperior to his Appearance. My Lord, ſaid <hi>Meekly</hi> as he entered, you muſt quit all further Thoughts of the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miſs <hi>Jeſſamin.</hi> I have here brought a prior Claimant to whom, I am confident, the Probity, the Generoſity of your Heart will give Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> roſe to receive him, when the Stranger, looking earneſtly and amazedly at him, cried out, Ah no, we muſt All give Place here, I find. Does ſhe know him, has <hi>Aggy</hi> ſeen him? I will then go and bury myſelf where my Heart may break in Deſpair of ever reclaiming her Affections.</p>
            <p>No fear, Sir, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> reaching his Hand, give me but to know that you have entitled yourſelf to her Regards, and my own Heart ſhall break in a thouſand Pieces, rather than oppoſe or diſturb the Peace of two gentle Lovers.</p>
            <p>I will give you our Story, my Lord, in a very few Words. Mr. <hi>Jeſſamin</hi> and my Father <hi>Jeſſop</hi> ſerved an Apprenticeſhip to the ſame Merchant, and, when that was expired, they joined in Trade to the <hi>Levant.</hi> But, as my Father was of the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0237300105:227"/>more adventurous Temper, they ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter broke Partnerſhip. My Father traded to <hi>Turkey</hi> and the Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jeſſamin</hi> confined himſelf to the <hi>Italian</hi> Coaſt.</p>
            <p>In one of his Voyages to <hi>Genoa,</hi> he there married and begot the charming <hi>Aggy,</hi> and, returning to <hi>London</hi> after a Number of Years, he fitted out a Ship of conſiderable Force in order to convoy his Wife and Daughter, with all his Treaſures to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On their Way home they were taken by a <hi>French</hi> Privateer. Their Ship and rich Cargo were ſent to <hi>Toulon.</hi> And Mrs. and Miſs <hi>Jeſſamin,</hi> with ſome other Priſoners, were taken on board the Enemy's Veſſel, that proceeded on her Cruiſe for further Captures.</p>
            <p>I happened, at the Time, to be on my Return homeward, in a Ship called, WEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COME ENEMIES; ſhe had the Appearance of a Merchant, but was actually better fitted for War than Trade.</p>
            <p>The ſame Privateer came up with us, and bearing on us, with Confidence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to ſtrike; but we anſwered them with an unexpected Broadſide and,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0237300105:228"/>coming to cloſe Quarters, we nearly cleared their Deck by the Diſcharge of our ſmall Arms. Soon after, we grappled and board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when, haſtening down to the Cabbin, I there for the firſt Time beheld my <hi>Aggy,</hi> in a fainting Fit, with her lovely Head re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined on the Lap of her Mother.</p>
            <p>As I kneeled to give Aſſiſtance toward her Recovery, ſhe firſt opened the Morning of her Eyes upon me, then turning them to her Mother, cried, Ah, Madam, what new Misfortune has been added to our Miſery? I hope we have not fallen into the Hands of the Infidels. No, Miſs, I ſaid, you are free, you are free, and you are freed by Hands that offer themſelves of their own Accord to your Shackles.</p>
            <p>When we came to Port, I divided the Freight of our Prize among the brave Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows who had ſeconded me ſo gallantly. And, having ſold the Veſſel for three and twenty hundred Pounds, I compelled Mrs. <hi>Jeſſamin</hi> to accept of it, as ſome ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the Loſſes that her Family had ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I had paid my Duty to my Father, and that the Warmth of his firſt Careſſes was over. Sir, ſaid I, I have melancholy News to tell you. I fear your old Friend and Partner, Mr. <hi>Jeſſamin,</hi> is
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0237300105:229"/>undone, as to Trade; great Part of his Fortune has been ſeized by the <hi>French,</hi> and that may prove a heavy Loſs to myſelf alſo. He has but one Daughter, and might I prevail upon her to accept of my Hand, I ſhould thereby become entitled to all her Father's Poſſeſſions. But, Sir, I cried, caſting myſelf paſſionately at his Feet, if the Happineſs of your Son is of any Weight with you, You will ſtill aſſent to our Union, and thereby make me the moſt bleſſed of all human Beings!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Everard,</hi> ſaid my Father, ſedately, you know I love you, and I am willing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide that Love between your Fancy and your Fortune. If <hi>Jeſſamin</hi> lays down twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Pounds, in Hand, toward portioning your four Siſters, I will conſent to your Union. And that's what I would not do, with any other Wench, under double that Sum.</p>
            <p>As I knew my Father's Diſpoſition to be as obſtinate as it was affectionate, I roſe and retreated without Reply. I inſtantly went to Mr. <hi>Jeſſamin</hi>'s, I found my Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer alone. I threw myſelf at her Knees. I ſolicited, I urged her to an immediate Marriage. When, bluſhing like the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when it ariſes as aſhamed of the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that it brings, Sir, ſaid ſhe, we owe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0237300105:230"/>you all Things, I never can refuſe you any Thing that Virtue will allow me to grant. Ah, how cold is that, I cried; I will not accept You as a Debt, my <hi>Aggy,</hi> if your Heart is not a free-will Offering, then let mine burſt in ſunder, they can have no Commerce together. Indeed, ſays ſhe, giving her Hand, I never had an Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for any Other, and I have in the World but the one Objection to you. What is that, what is that?—It is, ſhe cried, with filling Eyes, that I fear to hurt You by a Match ſo very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned to your Merits.</p>
            <p>Her Parents entered and found me ſtill at her Feet. I roſe in much Confuſion and, taking a Seat, I candidly told them what had paſſed between my Father and me; and urged the ſame Petition to them that I had to their Daughter; when Mr. <hi>Jeſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> recollecting himſelf, gave me an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer deſerving of everlaſting Memorial.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Jeſſop,</hi> ſays he, had I a Province to beſtow along with my Child, you ſhould have it as freely as I would give, of my Water-Ciſtern, to a thirſty Traveller. But here it happens that the ineſtimable Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which you have heaped upon my Family, are quite averſe to the Promotion of your preſent Deſires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0237300105:231"/>
In the firſt Place, as a Man of Probity, if I wiſh, one Day, to merit the Happineſs of your Alliance, I cannot conſent to be a Party in any clandeſtine Matter. Again, ſhall a Heart, full, and burſting with Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, be a Partaker in bringing either Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or Diſgrace, on the only One whom I account my Benefactor and Patron? Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhall a Father, who eſtimates the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Child, as a Pearl above the World's Purchaſe; ſhall he ſubject her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, perhaps her melting Gratitude, to the Temptation of yielding further than ſhe ought? or even to the Temptation of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her virtuous Affections beyond the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Retreat? This would be too ſevere a Tribute even for All that you have done for us. Do not exact it, my Son. My Heart wrings under the Neceſſity of reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Suit. You cannot be pained as I am by this Refuſal. But it is inevitable. You and my Daughter muſt meet no more till theſe Clouds are overpaſſed and that a new Light, of happier Influence, begins to dawn upon us.</p>
            <p>I anſwered not. I wept where I ſat for Half an Hour, I was not unaccompanied, and I then withdrew.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, I begin to grow tedious in Spite of my Intentions. I returned to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0237300105:232"/>my Father and requeſted him, in order, as I ſaid, to get rid of my preſent Paſſion, that he would diſpatch me abroad upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Voyage.</p>
            <p>I had given him a very lucrative Account of my laſt, and that made him the leſs inquiſitive reſpecting the Prize we had taken.</p>
            <p>He aſſented with Joy, as he feared that my Love might yet contend, and prevail in the Combat againſt Duty. And he took upon himſelf the Care of equipping out my Ship in a more gallant Plight than ever.</p>
            <p>The Day before I went on board, I ſtepped to Mr. <hi>Jeſſamin</hi>'s. My <hi>Aggy</hi> did not appear, and I found her Parents em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in preparing for a diſconſolate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to the Country. I told them I came to take my Leave, and aſked if they would ſend any Venture by me. The very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Man then went to his Deſk and, taking out the Bills of the Sale of the Privateer, here, my <hi>Everard,</hi> ſays he, I have nothing to adventure with you ſave your own free Gift. The Remainder of the Wreck of my Fortune is little enough to ſupply us with very frugal Accommodations, in our deſired Excluſion from the World and its Ways. And here is a little Note of the Place of our Retreat, if ever, my Child, if
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0237300105:233"/>ever—if ever we ſhall happen to meet on this Side of Eternity! O, I cried, kiſſing the Bills, if I do not bring you a good Account of theſe Ventures, never, indeed, ſhall we meet, till parting ſhall be no more!</p>
            <p>We then ſet about taking Leave, and having ſeveral Times ruſhed alternately into the Arms of Each other, we again ſat down and wept, till no Tears were left; when, rending myſelf away from them, and nearly blind to the Way that I went, I departed.</p>
            <p>Within a Year and a Half I returned, and, in a Storm, put in at <hi>Plymouth.</hi> But notwithſtanding the Intrepidity, and great Affection of my Companions; though I had made Death and Succeſs as Matters equally indifferent, and on one of which I was determined; yet, our high Hopes and Enterprizings had failed us on ſeveral Occaſions, and I am come back with little more than ten thouſand Pounds for Mr. <hi>Jeſſamin,</hi> over the Produce of the Voyage which my Father may exact from me.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, with poſt Horſes, and a beating Heart, I have croſſed the Country in Diſguiſe, impatient, yet fearful, to know, how the Heart of the nobly inexorable
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0237300105:234"/>
               <hi>Jeſſamin,</hi> may be affected toward me, and this Morning, as I ſkulked about the Houſe, this Gentleman met me and, having queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned me, brought me directly to your Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Harry</hi> covered his Eyes with his Hand, and muſing for a Time, at length ſaid, I fear, my Friends, it may be difficult to bring this Matter about with Propriety. I would not willingly affront Mr. <hi>Jeſſop</hi> here, by a Gift of the Sum that is deficient to his Happineſs. Neither, indeed, would it be duely delicate in Mr. <hi>Jeſſop</hi> to offer, to his Father-in-law, a Penny beyond what his Venture, ſo well ſupported by Mr. <hi>Jeſſop</hi>'s Bravery, had acquired. You therefore, my dear Mr. <hi>Meekly,</hi> ſhall be the Conduit of the Expedient that I propoſe on the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I queſtion if the War was proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when <hi>Jeſſamin</hi>'s Ship was made Prize; but, be that Matter as it may, I truſt I have Intereſt ſufficient to procure a Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the firſt Treaty of Peace. Do you therefore, my Friend, get me an Order from <hi>Jeſſamin</hi> for £.10000, on the firſt of his Effects in <hi>France,</hi> (with legal Intereſt however) and then take this Key and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to our Friends the very utmoſt of the Sum required by the Father of the darling Fellow who is now before me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0237300105:235"/>
               <hi>Meekly</hi> then ſprung up, advanced in Years as he was, and catching and clinging about <hi>Harry,</hi> O my Hero, my <hi>Scipio,</hi> he cried, you are the Champion whom Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven delighteth to empower to ſubdue itſelf by Violence! Go on, till the Wreath of Triumph ſhall be bound to your Head in all its prepared Glories!</p>
            <p>Mean while, young <hi>Jeſſop,</hi> lay proſtrate, in the Oppreſſion and Agony of Gratitude, at the Feet of his younger Patron. But <hi>Harry</hi> gently and affectionatly diſengaging himſelf from them, withdrew to his Cloſet, ſaying to his own Heart; now <hi>Aggy</hi> adieu, adieu <hi>Aggy,</hi> for ever!</p>
            <p>For three ſucceeding <hi>Sundays,</hi> our Hero hear'd the Bands of Marriage publiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Everard Jeſſop</hi> and <hi>Agnes Jeſſamin,</hi> all which he bore with the Firmneſs of a Stoic, or rather with the Reſignation of a Chriſtian who keeps a Look forward to a more pearly Hope.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, ſome may be curious to know how <hi>Aggy</hi> ſtood affected in regard to our young Lord. Let it ſuffice to be told that ſhe made the worthieſt of Wives to the very worthy <hi>Everard,</hi> notwithſtanding that he had the Imprudence to tell her of <hi>Harry</hi>'s Regard for her, as alſo of the Obligations by
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0237300105:236"/>which he had bound them. <hi>Aggy,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, could not juſtly refuſe <hi>Harry</hi> a Share in her Friendſhip, and there is ſomething extremely tender in the Friendſhip of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Female.</p>
            <p>Be that as it may, in about three Weeks after her Marriage, as ſhe walked, with two fair Viſitants, in a pleaſant Field behind the Town, ſhe ſaw our Hero coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her, attended by two Servants, and galantly mounted on a proud young Steed, whom he had undertaken to dreſs, and was now gracefully riding to the Manage.</p>
            <p>She felt a ſudden Alarm ſhe knew not why, and, as <hi>Harry</hi> approached, ſhe turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away that he might not recognize her. But, as ſoon as he had paſſed, ſhe gave one Look after him, and feeling herſelf diſcompoſed by a little hyſterical Fit, ſhe ſat down on the Graſs between her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and wept till ſhe was reſtored to her Strength and Spirits.</p>
            <p>In a few Days after, ſhe ſet out for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> where ſhe became the daily Idol of her Father-in-law, and ſaw our <hi>Harry</hi> no more.</p>
            <p>On an Evening, after Coffee, as the Earl ſtood fondly fooling with his <hi>Harry,</hi>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0237300105:237"/>as one Child with Another, he turned to Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> and ſaid, How came it to paſs, my Brother, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſuffered near four thouſand Years to elapſe, before he became incarnate for the Salvation of the World, although it was by him alone that the World could be ſaved?</p>
            <p>We may as well demand of God, ſaid Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> why he ſuffered near four Days of Creation to lapſe, before he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted yon glorious Body of far beaming Light. For, this Matter was barely a Type, and the Sun himſelf but a Shadow of the CHRIST that was to come. But, did the World want Light, before Light became incorporated in its illuſtrious Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcription? No, my Lord. JESUS, who was from Eternity the Illumination of the dark Immenſity of Nature; <hi>Jeſus</hi> who, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, is the living Light of Spirit, Soul, and Sentiment; the perpetual Fountain of the Streams of Beauty and Truth; he ſaid, LET THERE BE LIGHT! and inſtantly, through the Darkneſs of a ruined World, the <hi>Internity</hi> of his ever living Light kindled up an <hi>Externity</hi> of corporeal Irradiation, that has its Effluence from him, and cannot beam but by him.</p>
            <p>Now, as a Day is as a thouſand Years, and a thouſand Years as a Day, in the Sight of God; you ſee that the fourth Day of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0237300105:238"/>wherein the Light of this outward World was compacted into the glorious Body of the Sun, preciſely anſwers to the four thouſandth Year, wherein <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Light of Eternity was to become embodied and incarnate in Chriſt the SUN OF RIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEOUSNESS.</p>
            <p>But, as the World wanted not Light, before the Sun opened his firſt Morning in the Eaſt, neither did it want the Means of Salvation before the bleſſed Doctrine of MESSIAH was promulged upon Earth!</p>
            <p>All Sorts of Sectarians, All Perſons of ſelfiſh and little Minds would make a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly of the SAVIOUR, they would ſhut him up into a Conventicle, and ſay to their God, <hi>thus far ſhalt thou go, and no further.</hi> But he is not ſo to be confined. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our <hi>Jeſus</hi> bloweth wide and where he liſteth. And he is at once both the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier and Redeemer, as well of all Nations, as alſo of all Nature.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, we ſee that the <hi>Turks,</hi> who are wholly unbleſſed by true Religion or Liberty; who live the Slaves of Slaves; without a Form of civil Government; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally ſubjected to the Will of a Tyrant; and ſpiritually to the Worſhip of a ſenſual Impoſtor; yet want not the Feelings of our JESUS in their Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0237300105:239"/>
Even the wild <hi>Indians,</hi> who never liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Toll of a Bell, nor ever were called into any Court of civil Judicature; Theſe want not their Attachments, their Friendſhips, their Family-feelings, nor the ſweet Compunctions and Emotions of the human Heart, by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> forming to DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINE.</p>
            <p>The Truth is that People live, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more, by Impulſe and Inclination than by Reaſon and Precept. Reaſon and Precept are not always within our Beck; to have their due Influence, they require frequent Inculcation and frequent Recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but Impulſe and Inclination are more than at Hand, they are within us, and, from the Citadel, rule the Outworks of Man at Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of CHRIST, affirms that <hi>there is no other</hi> NAME <hi>under Heaven whereby a Man may be ſaved.</hi> And again, when he affirms that Thoſe, <hi>who have not received the Law, are a Law unto themſelves.</hi> He intends one and the ſame Thing. He intends that CHRIST, from the Fall of Man, is a PRINCIPLE OF RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEMPTION in the Boſoms of All Living. That he is not an <hi>outward</hi> but an <hi>inward Redeemer,</hi> working out our Salvation <hi>by
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0237300105:240"/>the Change of our depraved Nature.</hi> That in and from Him, alone, ariſe all the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Senſibilities, that warm the Heart with Love, that expand it with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that wring it with Compunction, or that heave it with the Story of diſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. And that He alone can be qualified to be Judge at the laſt Day, Who, from the firſt Day to the laſt, was internally a Co-Operator and Witneſs of all that ever paſſed within the Boſoms of all Men.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that, although the Chriſtian Countries have received the <hi>two Tables</hi> of the Laws of Chriſt, his <hi>external</hi> as well as <hi>internal Revelation,</hi> (Each witneſſing to the Other that the God of our <hi>Goſpel</hi> is the God of our <hi>Nature</hi>) the Nations however, who are Strangers to his Name, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his Influence, they do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>hear,</hi> but they <hi>feel</hi> the Precepts of that LIGHT <hi>which lighteth every Man who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My deareſt Brother, ſaid the Earl, my Conceptions are quite clear with reſpect to the Omnipreſence of Chriſt's Divinity. But, as his Body is circumſcribed by external Features and Lineaments, I can form no Notion of its being in ſeveral Places at once. How then will it be, I pray you, at and after the laſt Day? Will he be preſent to, and approachable only by a ſelect Number
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0237300105:241"/>of his Saints; or will he go certain Journeys and Circuits through the Heavens, bleſſing All, in Rotation, with his beatific Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?</p>
            <p>Is not the Body of yonder Sun circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, my Lord? Moſt certainly — It is now, ſaid Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> at a Diſtance of many Millions of Leagues from You, and yet You ſee it as evidently and feel its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence as powerfully as if it were within your Reach. Nay, it is more than within your Reach, it is within your Exiſtence. It ſupplies Comfort and Life to your animal Body and Life; and you could not ſurvive an Hour without its Influence and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Now, this is no other than the apt Type and prefiguring Promiſe of what Chriſt will be to his New-begotten in the Reſurrection, when <hi>Corruption ſhall be ſwallowed up of Glory and Mortal of Immortality.</hi> The ſame bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Body which, for the Redemption of commiſerated Sinners, went through the ſhameful and bloody Proceſs of Scourges, Thorns, Spittings, and Buffettings; which hung ſix agonizing Hours on the Croſs; which deſcended into the Grave, and thence opened the Way through Death into Life, and through Time into Eternity; Even this Body ſhall then ſhine forth in ineffable
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0237300105:242"/>Beauty and Beatitude, in effentially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative Grace and Glory; through the Heighth and through the Depth, through the Length and through the Breadth, beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wide beyond the Univerſe, from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity to Infinity.</p>
            <p>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, will then become co-embodied in this divine Body; they will be the Repletion of it, they will operate all Things by it. To bring the Creator nearer to his Creatures, the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Godhead will then become viſible, the Infinite circumſcribed, the Unapproachable acceſſable, and the Incomprehenſible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, within the Humanity of our CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Then will his Croſs be exalted, for an Enſign to the circling, bending, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Univerſe. His Wreath of Thorns will kindle all Nature with the Dartings and Caſtings forth of its Corruſcations. And his Reed of Mockery will become the Sceptre of unlimited Domination.</p>
            <p>From his five Wounds ſhall be poured forth inceſſant Floods of Glory and wide diffuſing Bleſſedneſs upon all his Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Adoring Worlds, in ſelf-Abjection, ſhall ſtrive to ſink beneath the Abjection that became their Salvation. Theſe ever apparent Enſigns of ſo dearly purchaſed
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0237300105:243"/>Benefits ſhall inevitably attract the Wills of all Creatures, they ſhall cauſe all Hearts and Affections to ruſh and cleave to him, as Steel Duſt ruſhes to Adamant, and as Spokes ſtick in the Nave whereon they are centred. There ſhall be no Lapſe thence-forward, forward, no Falling away, for ever. But God in his Chriſt, and Chriſt in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, ſhall be a Will and a Wiſdom, and an Action and a Mightineſs, and a Goodneſs and a Graciouſneſs, and a Glory riſing on Glory, and a Bleſſing riſing on Bleſſedneſs, through an ever beginning to a never ending ETERNITY.</p>
            <p>O Brother, Brother, Brother! exclaimed the Earl, I am enraptured, I am entranced! — I ſee it all, I feel it all. I am already, with all my Corruptions, with all my Tranſgreſſions, deſirous of being cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Nothing under the Foot of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. But he comforts inſtead of cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me. O that I were this Night, this very Moment to be diſſolved and to be with my Chriſt!</p>
            <p>That Night, the Earl was quite happy and pleaſant, and affectionate even beyond his Cuſtom. He ſaid and did every Thing that could be endearing to his <hi>Harry</hi> and to his Friends. He careſſed them at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Bed. He ſmilingly ſhook Hands with all the Domeſtics that approached
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0237300105:244"/>him; and, in the Morning, was found dead, without any Notice or Warning to the Servants who attended and lay in the Room.</p>
            <p>A ſudden and grievous Alarm was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly given through the Family, and quickly reached the Town, and ſpread through the adjacent Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> fell upon his Father's Face, and wept upon him, and kiſſed him, and wept aloud, and kiſſed him again, crying, my Father, O my Father!</p>
            <p>And they laid his Remains in a plated Coffin, under Eſcutcheons and a ſable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy of Velvet. And the Houſe and the Court was circled with Mourners from all Parts. And they mourned for him fifty and nine Days. And, on the ſixtieth Day, he was depoſited in his Family Tomb; but Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> would not permit <hi>Harry</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Funeral of his Father.</p>
            <p>Our Hero was now the Maſter of Millions, approaching to the Prime of Youth, glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Health, Action and Vigour, of Beauty incomparable, beloved of All who knew him, and the Attraction and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of every Eye where he paſſed. Yet all theſe Advantages, with all his higher
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0237300105:245"/>Accompliſhments, became as Matters of no Value, they ſunk and ſickened to his Senſe, while he felt a Void in his Boſom, eager after he knew not what, ſighing he knew not why; keen and craving in his Deſires, yet pining and languid in the Want of Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>What is the Matter, my Love? ſaid Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> my dear Brother died in a good old Age. Such Things ſhould be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we know that they muſt be, and we ought not to grieve as Perſons who are without Hope.</p>
            <p>True, Sir, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> and yet it is a very melancholy Thing for a poor Man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect how very rich he was a very little while ago. I lately had a dear Brother, a dear Mother, and the deareſt of Fathers, but where are they All now? I look round the World and ſee nothing but yourſelf therein. And — ſhould you too — ſhould you too — Here <hi>Harry</hi> could no more. His Uncle alſo broke into Tears, at the Thoughts of parting with his Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Harry,</hi> though it were to join his <hi>Louiſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Harry,</hi> ſays he at laſt, we have yet two precious Treaſures left upon Earth, if we did but know where to find them; it is your Couſin the Counteſs of <hi>Maitland,</hi>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0237300105:246"/>and the Brother of my <hi>Louiſa</hi> the Marquis <hi>D'Aubigny.</hi> Let us go in Search of them, my Son. Next to my <hi>Louiſa</hi> they are the lovelieſt of all Living. They abound in all human and divine Affections, and will careſs us with kindred and correſponding Hearts.</p>
            <p>Soon after, they ſet out for <hi>France</hi> and, by a roundabout Tour of ſhort but pleaſant Journeys, arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ordered his large Retinue to his ancient Inn, and, taking only two Footmen, he and <hi>Harry</hi> went in their Poſt-Chaiſe to the Marquis's Palace.</p>
            <p>On the ringing of the Bell and the opening of the Gate, a ſingle Domeſtic came forth. Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> perceived that all was dark in the Hall, and this inſtantly gave an Alarm to his ever ready Feelings.</p>
            <p>He alighted, however, and, ſtepping with his <hi>Harry,</hi> up the Flight of Marble, Where is your Maſter, ſays he, where is my Brother the Marquis? Heaven bleſs us, cried the Fellow, are you my Maſter's Brother? I have heard a Deal of and about your Lordſhip, though I never was ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to ſee your Face before. Ho! he continued, and rung another Bell, come All of You! attend the Brother of your
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0237300105:247"/>Lord, attend the preſent Maſter and Lord of your Houſhold!</p>
            <p>Immediately the Palace was in Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Parlour and Hall were lighted up, and All ſeemed to have acquired a Set of Wings to their Motions.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> looked with Eagerneſs at Each of the Domeſtics, endeavouring to recollect the Features of ſome old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but all the Faces were ſtrange to him. Pray tell me, my Friends, ſays he, where is your Maſter, where and how are he and his Lady, are they ſtill in good Health, has he had any Children by her?</p>
            <p>Pleaſe your Honour, ſaid an elderly Man, my Maſter's firſt Lady died of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, and her Infant periſhed with her. But, he is ſince married to One of the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Women in the World. He is gone, a Year ſince, on an Embaſſy into <hi>Africa;</hi> his Lady would not be left behind, we lately heard from them, they are Both in Health; and we expect that leſs than a Month will bring them ſafe to us; indeed, the Sum of our Prayers is for their happy and ſpeedy Return.</p>
            <p>What, ſaid Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> are there none of my old Friends, not one of our ancient Domeſtics to the fore? — Pleaſe your
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0237300105:248"/>Lordſhip, <hi>Jacome,</hi> the white headed Steward, is ſtill left, but, though in good Health, he is very little more than half alive. — Pray go and tell him that an old Friend of his is here, and would be very glad to ſee him, but don't do Things ſuddenly, and be very tender and careful in bringing him to me.</p>
            <p>Old <hi>Jacome</hi> was wheeled in, wrinkled, pale, and paralytic, and all enfeebled as he ſat reclining in an eaſy Chair, he ſeemed to recover Life and new Spirits, as they brought him forward. Bring me to him, bring me to him; my Eyes are wondrous dim; bring me cloſer, that I may know if it is my very Maſter indeed. Bring me but once to know that it is his ſweet par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Face and then let me die with all my Sins upon me, I care not.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> then took him very lovingly by the Hand, my good Friend <hi>Jacome,</hi> ſays he, we are both growing old I find, I rejoice however to ſee you once more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth. O, cried the old Man, a well known and a ſweet tuned Voice is that Voice; it is you then, it is you yourſelf, my Maſter! Alas, for all your Loſſes ſince laſt we parted! I have got a ſalt Rheum in my Eyes of late, and I never thought of you but it began to come down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0237300105:249"/>
Here <hi>Jacome,</hi> ſobbing aloud, provoked the joint Tears of his attending fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; though they had never been Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers in the foregone Calamities, farther than by the Ear, whence they were now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected and carried home to their Hearts.</p>
            <p>My Lord, ſays <hi>Jacome</hi> at laſt, I am not the only One that remains of your old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Your <hi>Gerard</hi> too, who (Bleſſings on his Hands) once tied me Neck and Heels, <hi>Gerard</hi> too is forthcoming and near at Hand. Your Honour's wonderful Bounty made a Gentlemen of him at once, and he is now in a high Way with a Wife and three Children. A hundred and a hundred Times have we waſhed your Remembrance with our Tears. And indeed I think your Honour ought not to ſend for him, leſt he ſhould ſuddenly die or run diſtracted at your Sight.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, One of the Lacqueys had officiouſly gone and informed <hi>Gerard</hi> of the Arrival of his Patron. He came panting, and ruſhed forward, as it were to caſt himſelf at the Feet of his Lord. But ſtopping ſuddenly, and drawing back ſome Steps, he nailed his Eyes, as it were, on the Face of Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and ſpreading his Hands, cried:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:0237300105:250"/>
You live then, my Lord, you ſtill live, my deareſt Maſter! you ſurvive all your Deaths and Sufferings, and the Weight of ten Mountains has not been able to cruſh you! — O, the Times, the Times, my Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, never more to return! — will there be ſuch Times in Heaven, think you? — Will there be ſuch Angels there as we once lived with upon Earth?</p>
            <p>Here he clapped his Hands together, and ſet up ſuch a Shout of bitter Lamentation, as was enough to ſplit the Heart of every Hearer, and, in a Manner, to ſplit the Graves of the Perſons whom he deplored.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> and his two old Friends had parted, for the Night: Tell me, my dear Sir, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> are there different Kinds of Grief, or is it, merely, that Grief affects us in different Manners?</p>
            <p>When I wept for my dear Father, my Mother and Brother, my Affliction was anguiſhing and altogether bitter, without any Species of alleviating Senſation to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate my Miſery. But, it was far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with me to Night; when I grieved in the Grief of your old and faithful Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics, I felt my Heart breaking, but I was pleaſed that it ſhould break; I felt that it was my Happineſs ſo to grieve; and I
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0237300105:251"/>could wiſh a Return of the ſame ſweet Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon is this, my Love: When you lamented your Parents, you lamented Yourſelf in your private and perſonal Loſſes. Your Affliction was juſt, it was natural, it was laudable. But ſtill it was confined, it participated but little of the Emotion that is excited by the Affliction of Others, and the Anguiſh was the keener by being nearly limited to your own Boſom and your own Concerns.</p>
            <p>But, in the Griefs of my old and loving Servants, this Night; you became wholly expanded; you went beyond, you went out of yourſelf. You felt, without Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how delightful it is to go forth, with your God, in his ſocial, generous, noble, and divine Senſibilities. And you delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully felt, my <hi>Harry,</hi> that ſuch a Houſe of Mourning is more joyous to your Soul, than all the Feſtivals that Fleſh and Senſe can open before you.</p>
            <p>And now, my Child, I will finally, and once for all, lay open the very horrible and deteſtable Nature of SELF in your Soul.</p>
            <p>SELF appears to us, as the Whole of our Exiſtence, as the Sum total of All, in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0237300105:252"/>which we are intereſted or concerned. It is as a NARCISSUS, ſelf-delighted, ſelf-enamoured. It deſires, it craves, and claims, as its Right, the Loves, Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Reſpects of all Mankind. But, does it acquire them, my <hi>Harry?</hi> O, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, never. SELF never was beloved, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will be beloved, never was honourable or reſpectable in the Eye of any Creature. And the Characters of the <hi>Patriot,</hi> the <hi>Hero,</hi> the <hi>Friend,</hi> and the <hi>Lover,</hi> are only ſo far amiable, ſo far revereable, as they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have gone forth from the Confines of SELF.</p>
            <p>As Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> propoſed to wait the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Marquis, he employed the mean Seaſon in Endeavours to amuſe his Darling, and to diſpel the Cloud of Melancholy that continued to hang over him.</p>
            <p>For this Purpoſe, he went with him to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and to the many other elegant Environs of <hi>Paris.</hi> He alſo ſhewed him the <hi>Thuilleries</hi> and other public Walks, where our Hero became oppreſſed by his involuntary Attraction of all Eyes upon him.</p>
            <p>One Night, happening to go to the Play, without the Company of his Guardian, as he came forth, with the Crowd, a Carriage
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0237300105:253"/>was opened for him which he took to be his own, and in he ſtepped, and away he was taken.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> waited Supper for him, and began to grow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy when the Clock ſtruck Twelve. At laſt his Carriage and Servants returned with Tidings that they ſtaid for him, above an Hour, at the Theatre, after the Play was over, and had ever ſince been in Search of him, to no Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Though Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> was, by Nature, of an intrepid Spirit, and was ſtill more aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Reliance on Providence, he yet found himſelf agitated in a very alarming Manner. He therefore retired to his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and there, on his Knees, fervently commended his <hi>Harry</hi> to the Protection of his God.</p>
            <p>At length the Clock ſtruck Three. Soon after, the Bell was heard from the Hall, and <hi>Harry,</hi> entering, with a Page in a rich Livery, flew like Lightening up Stairs, and caſt himſelf into the Boſom of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron.</p>
            <p>My Father, my Father! he cried, I have been in ſad Pannics for you. I knew the Love that you bore to your good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0237300105:254"/>
               <hi>Harry.</hi> But, indeed I could not help it. I could not get to you till this Inſtant. I have been a Priſoner, Sir, and here is my dear Deliverer.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they were ſomething com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and All ſeated; <hi>Harry</hi> proceeded to ſatisfy the Impatience of his Uncle.</p>
            <p>As I came out of the Theatre, ruminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a Paſſage in one of <hi>Racine</hi>'s Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, I found a Chariot in the Spot where I had left my own, and ſtepping heedleſly into it, I was ſoon ſet down, and haſtening through the great Hall, flew up Stairs to ſalute you. But, think how I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, when I ſuddenly found myſelf in the moſt ſumptuous Chamber, perhaps, in the Univerſe. It was wainſcotted with Mirrors of the moſt perfect Poliſh, whoſe Plates were artfully buttoned and buckled together by Diamonds and other Gems of a moſt dazzling Luſtre.</p>
            <p>All aſtoniſhed, I recoiled, and was going to withdraw, when I was met by a Lady who followed and accoſted me. Have you Commands, Sir, ſays ſhe, for any One in this Houſe?—A thouſand Pardons, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I perceive my Error! I really thought I was ſet down at my own Lodgings.—No great Offence, Sir, but now that I
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0237300105:255"/>look at you again, I think you ought to pay the Forfeit of your Intruſion, by giving me one Hour of your Company, at leaſt.—You muſt excuſe me, Madam, my Guardian would be under the moſt terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Alarms for me.—A Fig for Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, ſhe cried, You are now my Priſoner, and nothing leſs than my Friend <hi>Lewis,</hi> with his Army at his Back, ſhall be able to take you out of my Hands.</p>
            <p>So ſaying, ſhe rung a Bell, and, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately a folding Door of pannelled looking-Glaſs flew open, and ſhewed us to another Apartment, where a Supper, compoſed of all the Elegancies of the Seaſon, was ſerved up, as by Magic, and lay fuming on the Table.</p>
            <p>She then took me by the Hand and, having graciouſly ſeated me, placed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf oppoſite. A Number of Servants then vaniſhed, on the Inſtant, leaving a dumb Waiter of Silver behind them.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid ſhe, we are not to have any further Company. You alone were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, you alone are deſired, All Others are forbidden. In ſhort, I have ſeen you often at the public Walks and Theatres. You did more than ſtrike my Fancy, you laid hold on my Heart. I enquired every Thing about you. I know your Rank,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0237300105:256"/>Title and Fortune. I made uſe of this Night's Stratagem to decoy you to me, and, though there are few Women, in <hi>Europe,</hi> of equal Opulence or Dignity, I think I cannot much demean myſelf by an Alliance with a ſweet Fellow whom I ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently love. But come, our Supper cools.</p>
            <p>I gazed at her with Admiration. She was indeed the moſt finiſhed Beauty I ever beheld. And I was inwardly flattered, and in a Manner attached to her by her Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in my Favour.</p>
            <p>After Supper, and ſome futile and inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Chat, ſhe drew her Chair nearer to me. What ſay you, my Lord, ſays ſhe, fondly, am I to live, or to periſh?</p>
            <p>Ah Madam, I cried, Love is, as a little Bird, if you cage it, it will beat itſelf to Pieces againſt its Priſon. Not that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard your late Threats of Confinement; my own Arm is at all Times ſufficient to deliver me from your Thraldom; but, in Truth, I am partly become a willing Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to You; and Time may, poſſibly, reconcile me to your different Cuſtoms.</p>
            <p>What Cuſtoms, I pray you? Why, Madam, the Ladies, in my Country, uſe no Paint, except the Rouge of Nature's
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0237300105:257"/>Bluſh and the Paleneſs of Chaſtity. Love alſo, in <hi>England,</hi> is a Kind of Warfare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sexes, juſt ſuch as once happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the <hi>Parthians</hi> and old <hi>Rome;</hi> our Ladies conquer, by flying, and our Men are vanquiſhed while they purſue.</p>
            <p>Perſons, Sir, of a certain Rank, ſaid ſhe, are diſpenſed with from conforming to little Matters of Decorum. However, if you will endeavour to adopt the Manners of my Country, I will do my beſt, on my Part, to conform to thoſe of Yours.</p>
            <p>So ſaying, ſhe looked languiſhingly at me, and drew her Chair quite cloſe; when, by an involuntary Motion, I put mine further back. Don't be alarmed, my Lord, ſays ſhe, Women of my Condition know always where to ſtop. Right, Madam, ſaid I, but poſſibly you might not be quite ſo ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in teaching me where to be ſtopped.</p>
            <p>Cold conſtitutioned Boy! ſhe cried (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignantly riſing and colouring) your Bed lies yonder, you may go to it, if you like, and ruminate till Morning on the Danger of ſlighting and inſulting a Princeſs. So ſaying, ſhe ſwept haughtily out of the Room, and locked me in.</p>
            <p>During an Hour after ſhe had withdrawn, while I walked about, conſidering what I
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0237300105:258"/>had to apprehend from the Threats of this extraordinary Woman, I hear'd a great Buſtling in and about the Falace; but, within another Hour All was quiet and ſtill again.</p>
            <p>I then conceived Thoughts of attempting my Eſcape. But again, I held it beneath me to be caught in the Manner; and ſo I reſolved to wait till Morning, and then to force my Paſſage through her Guards in open Day.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, I imagined that a Pannel in the Wainſcot ſtirred. And, ſoon after, it was removed, and my young Friend, here, entered my Chamber on Tiptoe. He beckoned me to Silence and, taking me by the Hand, he led me through the Way by which he came.</p>
            <p>We then deſcended a narrow Pair of back Stairs, and, groping along a dark Entry, he cautiouſly unbolted a Door that opened into a Garden; and hurrying with me, acroſs, he unlocked another Door that opened to the Street, and out we got, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing!</p>
            <p>Soon after, we met a Party of the Guards, who were patroling the Streets, and, putting a few Pieces into their Hand,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0237300105:259"/>I requeſted their ſafe Convoy, and they conducted us Home.</p>
            <p>My Lords, ſaid <hi>Perrè,</hi> (for that was the Page's Name) it would be extremely dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for Ye to remain another Day, or even till Morning in <hi>Paris.</hi> The Princeſs is the moſt intimate Friend of Madame <hi>Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and through her can do what ſhe pleaſes with the King. During my Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with her, ſhe grew tired of two hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Lovers, in Succeſſion; but they told no Tales; and no One can yet tell what became of them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> was quite of <hi>Perrè</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. He inſtantly ſent for his People. All was Hurry, Pack and Diſpatch, and, toward Dawning, they ſet out on a Road that led to the Cantons. But, changing their Courſe again, for ſeveral ſucceſſive Mornings, they arrived at <hi>Calais</hi> by a long Tour of near five Weeks travel.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> ſet up at his old Inn, and after Dinner, the Hoſt entered to pay his Compliments. Have you any News, Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord? Nothing at preſent, my Lord, all is quiet again. But here has been a fearful Buſtle about three Weeks ago. The King's Army came down, in Purſuit of young <hi>Engliſhman</hi> who ran away with a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0237300105:260"/>of Quality from <hi>Paris.</hi> For my Share, continued he, looking earneſtly at <hi>Harry,</hi> I fear that You, pretty <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lads, will hardly leave us a lovely Wench in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Harry</hi> looked quite ſecure, being wholly innocent of any preſent Deſign on the Sex; but poor little <hi>Perrè</hi> turned as pale as the Table Cloth.</p>
            <p>I remember, continued our talkative Hoſt, that juſt ſuch another Affair hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, when I was a Boy and Servant in this Houſe. Here came a young <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> juſt ſuch another ſweet Fellow as this before me; and he brought with him an Angel of a Creature, the like of whom my Eyes never did, nor ever ſhall open upon till they cloſe in Death. After him came one of our great Dukes, with a Party of the King's Army, and terrible Things were expected. But, they made it up in a Manner I know not how. And my Lord <hi>Anglois</hi> carried off his Prize in Triumph! Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> ſtooped his Head, and dropt a ſilent Tear, but held no further Converſe with our Landlord on the Subject.</p>
            <p>That Evening, a Gale ſprung up and, going on Board, they were ſafe anchored, before Morning, in the Bay of <hi>Dover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They then mutually embraced; and <hi>Harry,</hi> catching his beloved Deliverer to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0237300105:261"/>his Boſom, we are now upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ground, ſays he; welcome to my Arms, my dear <hi>Perrè,</hi> no longer my Page or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but my Friend and my Brother! You can't conceive what Pain your Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs has hitherto coſt me, but, there muſt be no more of this; You ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be ſerved and attended as I am, nay, I myſelf will gladly ſerve You to the utmoſt of my Power and the Extent of my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>Ah, my Lord, cried the lovely <hi>Perrè,</hi> gently falling at the Feet of his Maſter, if you deprive me of the Pleaſure of ſerving You, you deprive me of all the Pleaſure that the World can afford me. If you knew the Delight I find in being always about you, in watching your Thoughts and Motions, in looking into your fine Eyes and there reading your Deſires, before they riſe to Expreſſion, You could not find in your Heart to deprive me of ſuch a Bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Well then, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> raiſing him fondly in his Arms, our future Conteſt ſhall be, which of us ſhall ſerve the Other with moſt Affection and Sedulity.</p>
            <p>After Dinner, the Evening being calm and ſhiny, <hi>Harry</hi> took his <hi>Perrè</hi> with him along the Shore that ſtretches under the ſtupendous Cliffs of <hi>Dover.</hi> They had not
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0237300105:262"/>walked far when, getting out of the Sight of People within the Winding of a Creek, a Man advanced toward them, and, taking out a Piſtol, called to <hi>Harry,</hi> and ordered him to throw down his Purſe. Our Hero did not regard his Purſe, but, thinking it an Indignity to be robbed by one Man, he put his Hand to his Sword. Hereupon, the Villain cocked and levelled his Piſtol, and the faithful <hi>Perrè,</hi> obſerving that he was going to fire, inſtantly jumped in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her Maſter and Danger and received the Ball into her own lovely Boſom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> ſaw his Darling drop, and, flying all enraged at the Robber, he ran him thrice through the Body and pinned him to the Ground. Then, flying as ſwiftly back, he threw himſelf by the Side of his dying <hi>Perrè,</hi> and gently raiſing her lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Head, placed it fondly on his Boſom.</p>
            <p>You are wounded, my Friend, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly wounded I fear, ſays <hi>Harry.</hi> Yes, my Lord, I am wounded juſt as I could wiſh; and I would not exchange my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent bleſſed Death for the longeſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt Life that the World could beſtow.—But, it is Time to undeceive, and eveal a Secret to you, which nothing but death ſhould ever have extorted from me
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0237300105:263"/>—I am not what I ſeem, my moſt beloved Maſter!—I am a fooliſh and fond Girl who, at the firſt Glance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Paſſion for you.—My Name is <hi>Maria de Lauſanne;</hi>—I am Niece to that bad Woman whom you juſtly rejected.—But, what did I propoſe by this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe? Firſt your Deliverance, my Lord, and that I effected.—But, did I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſpire to the Honour of your Hand? Far from it, far from it—I felt my own Unworthineſs, I did not think you could be mated by any Thing leſs than an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel—But then to ſee you, to hear you, to ſerve, to touch, to be near you, to fix my Eyes on you unheeded, and, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to win your Attention by the little Offices of my Fondneſs, this was my Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, the Whole of the Heaven that I propoſed upon Earth—I have had it, I have enjoyed it;—and I ought to die content—But, alas, to part from you, there is the Pang of Pangs.—O, if this Day merits any Thing, by the Offer of my own Life for the Preſervation of my Beloved.—Then cauſe my chaſte Clay to be kindly depoſited in the Tomb of your Anceſtors—that—when Time ſhall come—my Duſt may be neigh boured—to your precious Duſt—and there ſleep in Peace—beſide you—till we ſpring—together—from
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0237300105:264"/>Corruption—into Glory and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality!</p>
            <p>During theſe ſhort Sentences and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Reſpirations, <hi>Harry</hi> could anſwer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing—He was ſuffocated by his Grief.—But, putting his ſpeechleſs Lips to the fading Lips of his <hi>Maria,</hi> he drew her lateſt Breath into his own affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Boſom, and Angels inſtantly caught her Spirit into the Regions of Purity, of Love, and of Faith unfailing!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry,</hi> then, plucking up Strength from Oppreſſion, and Courage from Deſpair, preſſed his Lips to the pale, and unfeeling Lips of his true Lover, and cried, Yes, my <hi>Maria,</hi> our Duſt ſhall be joined, and I feel that our Spirits too ſhall ſhortly be wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded!—Then, raiſing her in his Arms, and preſſing her to his Boſom, he bore her to the Town, while he poured upon her, all the Way, the two Fountains of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>When he got to the Inn, and came to is Uncle; Here, Sir, ſaid he, I preſent you with a very precious little Burden, a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that lies much heavier on my Heart than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> did in my Arms. He then related to Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> the Whole of what had paſſed; then, heavily ſighing, and ſhedding a Tear, Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> cried, Ah, my <hi>Harry,</hi> I would
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0237300105:265"/>to Heaven that your <hi>Maria</hi> had lived, She exceeds your <hi>Aggy Jeſſamin</hi> all to nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> ordered a Carriage, on Purpoſe, for himſelf and his Beloved. She was depoſited in a Coffin hurried up for the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; and, notwithſtanding all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances and Entreaties of his Parent, <hi>Harry</hi> proved a Rebel, for the firſt Time, and would not be divided from his <hi>Maria,</hi> till they reached <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There, our Hero ordered a Coffin of unallayed and beaten Silver to be prepared for her Reception. And, tho' near five Days had paſſed ſince the Departure of her Spirit, her chaſte Fleſh remained as pure and untainted, as that of a Lamb newly ſlain.</p>
            <p>While they were putting her into her ſolemn Repoſitory. Ah, Sir, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> I pretend not to compare with you, your Loſſes, I own, have been greater than mine. You are a Man, like your divine Maſter, wholly made up of Sorrows and acquainted with killing Griefs. But ſtill you muſt allow that, for my little Time I have had a competent Share. It matter not. I am reconciled to them. I begin to be pleaſed with them. And indeed Joy is become my utter Averſion, while I think
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0237300105:266"/>on this loved Creature, who willingly bled and died for my Sake.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Harry</hi> thought it his Duty, ſo he thought it would be his Delight to weep and lament his <hi>Maria</hi> for ever. But Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſeldom are permanent, and Time, though it may not wholly efface, daily wears away an inſenſible Portion of the deepeſt Impreſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> cauſed the Coffin of his Deliverer to be exalted on a Cabinet in his Bedcham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that it might be always in his Sight. But the Familiarity of affecting Objects daily leſſens their Force; and <hi>Harry,</hi> Week after Week, began to contemplate the Repoſitory of the loved Remains of his <hi>Maria,</hi> with abating Affliction.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> received a Letter, by the <hi>French</hi> Mail, in anſwer to One which he had left for his Brother-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, at <hi>Paris.</hi> And, this Letter informed him, under the Marquis's Hand, that he had returned from his Ambaſſy to the Court of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and that he and his Lady would be ſhortly in <hi>England.</hi> And, at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom he found written, in a different Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Will it be any Satisfaction to ſee them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by your once loved</hi>—FANNY GOODALL.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0237300105:267"/>
We have found them, my <hi>Harry,</hi> he cried, we have found them, our long and far ſought Friends; the two Treaſures which our God had graciouſly laid in Store, for the Comfort of us poor People who loſt All beſide. But, don't let us do them the Diſgrace, my Son, of meeting and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with Tears and Dirges. Let me then prevail upon you to permit your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Perrè</hi> to be conducted by ſome of our People, with an honourable Train of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers to <hi>Enfield,</hi> and there to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up in your Family Vault, where I ſhall ſpeedily join her, and whereto even my <hi>Harry</hi> muſt finally adjourn.—<hi>Harry</hi> wiped his Eye and ſaid, be it as you pleaſe, my Father!</p>
            <p>Within the following Fortnight, as our Hero ſtood with a ſingle Attendant in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide</hi> overagainſt the <hi>Devil Tavern,</hi> where the Club, called <hi>Legion Club,</hi> was kept; he was accoſted by a glittering Appearance, who took him by the Hand and ſaid, How are you, Maſter <hi>Fenton?</hi>—Well, Sir, I thank you; Lord <hi>Bottom</hi> I preſume!—The ſame, Sir—And pray how are the worthy Lord and Lady <hi>Mansfield,</hi> as alſo your lovely Siſter, the Lady <hi>Louiſa?</hi>—Paſſable, Sir; but what makes you in black? I hope Mr. <hi>Fenton</hi> is ſtill in the Land of the Living.—He is, my Lord.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0237300105:268"/>But Black is a cheap Kind of Wear, it is a Matter of Frugality to kill a Couſin once in a Twelve-month.—Well, be that as it may, I inſiſt on your ſtepping over the Way to take one Glaſs with me—Your Lordſhip muſt excuſe me, I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Wharf, to enquire concerning ſome Friends whom I expect from <hi>France.</hi> O, I proteſt, Maſter <hi>Fenton,</hi> you ſhall not diſappoint me, I inſiſt on renewing our old Acquaintance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> could hardly have found it in his Heart to refuſe the Requeſt of an avowed Enemy, much leſs could he think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting an Invitation that was made under a warm Appearance of Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>When Lord <hi>Bottom</hi> had ſeated his old Enemy (as he ſtill ſuppoſed him to be) in the Midſt of fourteen or fifteen Bloods and Bucks, <hi>Harry</hi> would gladly have retreated; but rejected the Thought, leſt they ſhould think that he was intimidated.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, cried Lord <hi>Bottom,</hi> give me Leave to introduce a Phenomenon to you, my Friend yonder is a CHRISTIAN! A Chriſtian, cried One; a Chriſtian, cried Another? Ay, ſaid Lord <hi>Bottom,</hi> a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian of the right Caſt, he literally conforms to the Example of his Maſter. If you
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0237300105:269"/>ſmite him on the one Cheek, he will turn the Other to you, and you cannot delight him more than by Kickings, Spittings, and Spurnings.</p>
            <p>Pray Sir, ſaid One of the Company, are you actually a Chriſtian? I hope ſo, Sir, ſaid <hi>Harry.</hi> And may I ſpit in your Face, Sir, ſaid Another, without Fear of Chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement? You may, Sir, ſaid <hi>Harry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told ye ſo, Gentlemen, I told ye ſo, exclaimed Lord <hi>Bottom.</hi> I have myſelf put the Chriſtianity of my Friend there to the Proof. I have made him the But and the Jeſt of all Companies. I have dubbed him with the Title of FOOL. I have paſted it on his Back in Capitals, in the Midſt of the Levee, and in the Preſence of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. And yet, he never ſhewed the leaſt Inſtance of his being offended. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample now, and ſo ſaying, he ſpit directly in <hi>Harry</hi>'s Face.</p>
            <p>Another then, and then Another, and ſo on, in a numerous Succeſſion ſpit full at our Hero. While he, without the ſmalleſt apparent Emotion, barely took out his Handkerchief and wiped the Moiſture from his Face.</p>
            <p>At rength a luſty-looking young Man arore Damn the Raſcal, ſaid he, I will
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0237300105:270"/>not demean myſelf by ſpitting at him, I will piſs upon the Raſcal; which he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly prepared to do. But <hi>Harry,</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Approach, turned mildly and ſaid, I do not recollect, Sir, that this was any of the Indignities to which my Lord and Maſter ſubmitted. Then, without riſing from his Seat, he gave him a Knuckle in the Temple which laid him aſleep on the Floor.</p>
            <p>'Sbl—d, cried One of the Company, I fear, <hi>Jemmy Bottom,</hi> you have brought us into the wrong Box. You have certainly miſtaken your Man.</p>
            <p>He has indeed, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> calmly. He calls me <hi>Fenton,</hi> but my Name is not <hi>Fenton,</hi> my Name is <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and you ſhall, every Man, lie theſe twelve Months in <hi>Newgate</hi> for this Day's Breach of Privilege againſt a Peer of the Realm. Here is my Star, Gentlemen; I can put my Riband on at Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The whole <hi>Legion</hi> were inſtantly ſtruck with mute Terror and Aſtoniſhment. They lifted up their Hands, or ſunk to their Knees in petitioning Poſtures. But <hi>Harry</hi> ſaid, with a firm and alarming Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, I deſire your Reformation, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and I will endeavour to compleat it.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0237300105:271"/>I have hitherto, only ſhewn you the firſt Part of Chriſtianity in the Example of meek and lowly Sufferance. The ſecond Part remains. It is to teach You, abject Wretches, to ſuffer in your Turn. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I am not of a very vindictive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and if All of you will be upon Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to give me your Hands, I will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don what is paſt and diſmiſs you in Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
            <p>Lord <hi>Bottom</hi> and his Friend <hi>Rakely</hi> were the firſt who advanced, lowly bowing, to claim the propoſed Terms of Peace, when <hi>Harry,</hi> ſeizing <hi>Bottom</hi>'s Hand with a ſtrong and agile Gripe, cruſhed the Bones and the Griſles as it were into one Maſs, and <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,</hi> giving a huge Scream, dropt roaring on the Floor. <hi>Rakely</hi> then would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiled, but <hi>Harry,</hi> catching at him, ſent him to join his Brother in Iniquity and Affliction on the Boards.</p>
            <p>Well, Gentlemen, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> what keeps you in your Seats? Why do ye not come and give me the Honour of your Hands as was agreed? If you do not do it directly, I will take Each of you, very quietly, by the Noſe, and kick you through the Crowd of Attendants down Stairs.</p>
            <p>My Lord, cried One of the Company, I will not give you my Hand, neither ſhall
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0237300105:272"/>any Man living take me by the Noſe. So ſaying he ſprung up, and catching at his Sword, which lay with Others on a Table, he haſtily drew it and ſtood on his Defence.</p>
            <p>O fye, Sir, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> without moving from his Seat, you don't put yourſelf in a Poſture. Any Man, who was not a very good natured Man, might take you at an Advantage, and run you under the Open that you give to your right Flank. But Sir, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> riſing, I will only caution you by a little Puncture in the Sword Arm; I don't mean you much Hurt. And, ſo ſaying, he paſſed his Sword through the Fleſh of his Adverſary's right Arm, and, taking him to the Door, he wiſhed him a good Evening, and turned him down Stairs to ſeek for a Surgeon.</p>
            <p>He then returned to the Company, and, taking Each of the intimidated Wretches (in Succeſſion) by the Noſe; he led them out, and footed them down Stairs, through the Midſt of their own Servants, the Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> crying, a Kicking to all the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and ſcoundrel Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> who dare to ſpit at Chriſtianity!</p>
            <p>Then, calling two of the Drawers, Here is ſomething for yourſelves, my Lads, ſays he; and here I leave you yonder Swords and theſe two very fine Gentlemen in pawn
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0237300105:273"/>for your Reckoning. So ſaying, he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quite compoſedly away, through the Midſt of two long Ranges of bowing Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, who lined the Stairs and the Entry, and thus <hi>Harry</hi> diſſolved the <hi>Legion Club.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Morning early before Mr. <hi>Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was up, while <hi>Harry</hi> ſat ſipping a Diſh of Tea, dreſſed in a dark grey Frock, his Hair ſlightly bound up after the Footman Faſhion, and his long Staff of quarter cleft Oak, without Knot or Flaw, ſtanding po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed beſide him, Mr. <hi>Frank</hi> introduced a young Man, whom he recommended to his Lordſhip's Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> meaſured him, with a Glance, from Top to Toe, and was inſtantly ſtruck by the viſible Action, Power, and Energy of his Proportions.</p>
            <p>Sit down, <hi>Frank,</hi> ſays <hi>Harry,</hi> while your Friend and I treat. What is your Name, my Lad? <hi>John Sutton,</hi> ſo pleaſe you. And what Wages do you deſire? From one Pound to one hundred yearly. — A great Difference indeed, <hi>John.</hi> — Why, pleaſe your Honour, if I mayn't happen to like you I ſhall march without aſking a ſingle Penny. But if I ſhould have the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to love you, as your Countenance threatens, I ſhall certainly deſerve the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0237300105:274"/>whole of my Demand, by All that I ſhall do, and dare to do in your Service.</p>
            <p>Can you wreſtle, <hi>Jack?</hi> — When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your Honour ſhall get a Man, through the Shires of <hi>England,</hi> who is able to fling me, I will ſerve you the Remainder of my Life for nothing. Can you cudgel, <hi>Jack?</hi> — I was born a Fencer, ſo pleaſe your Lordſhip, my Father was a famous Prize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fighter, and my Mother could beat my Father himſelf at the Quarter Staff. — Did you ever read the Hiſtory of <hi>Robin Hood, Jack?</hi> — I did, Sir. — Then you may remember that honeſt <hi>Robin</hi> never took an Abettor into Pay, ſave ſuch a One as was able to cope with himſelf. <hi>Frank</hi> here ſhall ſit and ſee fair Play.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then roſe, and taking two Sticks, gave one of them to his Opponent, then, putting a Braſs Helmet upon <hi>Jack</hi>'s Head, there is ſomething, ſaid he, to ſave you from Hurt, and now, come at the Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Skull as faſt as you can!</p>
            <p>To it they ſtrait fell, with equal Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Ability. But <hi>Harry,</hi> perceiving that <hi>Jack</hi> intended to ſpare him, cried, Come, <hi>Jack,</hi> the beſt, the very beſt that you can do, or not a Penny, a ſingle Penny of Wages, I aſſure you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:0237300105:275"/>
               <hi>Jack</hi> then exerted his utmoſt, and put nearly the fulleſt Powers of our Hero to Proof, till <hi>Harry,</hi> dazzling his Eyes by a ſudden Flouriſh, gave him a ſmart Stroke on his brazen Head-piece, and drove him ſtunned and ſtaggering ſeveral Paces back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, till he reſted againſt the Wall that ſtood behind him.</p>
            <p>Ha, ſaid <hi>Jack,</hi> recovering, and caſting his Cap aſide, that indeed was a Blow which neither my Father nor Mother ever taught me to fence.</p>
            <p>Well, my Friend, ſaid our Hero, as ſoon as you are reſted, we muſt have a little Turn or ſo at Wreſtling. No, no, cried <hi>Jack,</hi> I would not adviſe your Lordſhip to that, there lies all my Excellence, the very beſt of my Manhood. Well, <hi>Jack,</hi> ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> a Fling on this Floor can't hurt us a Whit more than a Fall on the Downs.</p>
            <p>They cloſed, they grappled, they griped under and over, at Hip and at Shoulder, alternately lifting and lifted, till they were nearly overbreathed. Then, parting for a Moment, they ruſhed forward and ſeized each other by the Breaſt, when <hi>Harry,</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Adverſary a ſudden Twiſt on one Side and then an agile Jerk and Foot on the other, caſt him ſidelong on the Carpet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0237300105:276"/>
Poor <hi>Jack</hi> roſe, aſtoniſhed and in utter Abaſement, aſhamed even to lift his Eyes toward the Eyes of his Friend <hi>Frank;</hi> when <hi>Harry</hi> took him by the Hand and forcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſeated him at the Tea-table. Come, <hi>Jack,</hi> ſays he, don't be diſcouraged. You have put me harder to it than did the great <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Roſſ-town,</hi> though I think I am much abler than I was at that Day. Here <hi>Frank,</hi> order us ſomething more ſubſtantial for Breakfaſt, while your Friend and I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to accommodate our Differences.</p>
            <p>When Breakfaſt was over, <hi>Harry</hi> looked fixedly at his late Opponent and ſaid, I will give you, <hi>Jack,</hi> a little Matter above the Extent of your Demand; I will give you one Hundred a Year for your Cudgelling, another Hundred for your Wreſtling; and as you ſay you can love, I will lay another Hundred in ſtore for you, till that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is put to Proof; and here is twenty Guineas as Earneſt of our Agreement. <hi>Jack</hi> then threw himſelf proſtrate before the Feet of his new Maſter. Keep your Bounties, keep your Bounties for my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors, he cried, for I feel that, when your Service demands my Life, I ſhall not ſurvive another Minute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then roſe and, putting another Quarter-ſtaff into the Hand of his new Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0237300105:277"/>here is a Horſe for you, <hi>Jack,</hi> ſays he, in caſe you ſhould tire; for we have a long Walk from Pal-Mall here, to the Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-houſe Wharf and back again.</p>
            <p>As they drew near the Quay, <hi>Harry</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a great Crowd, all in Motion, and ſhouting as in the Midſt of an Affray. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately he haſtened up, and, making way through the Mob, perceived that they were kicking, and wounding, and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging above twenty unhappy Foreigners along the Pavement. While a Lady, who ſtood with her Women on the Stairs, cried aloud, five hundred, a thouſand, five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds to Any who will ſave my poor People!</p>
            <p>Come, <hi>Jack,</hi> ſays our Hero, let us try to deliver theſe abuſed Strangers from the Cruelty of our ſavage Countrymen.</p>
            <p>On the Word, <hi>Harry</hi> found himſelf well ſeconded by <hi>Jack,</hi> and, in leſs than a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, above thirty of the Aſſailants lay ſprawling on the Area; while the wounded and bruiſed Foreigners aroſe as well as they could, or crawled and got in a Group to the Feet of their Miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>The Mob, thereupon, rallied, and, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering to the Number of ſome Hundreds,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0237300105:278"/>advanced in a formidable Body againſt our two Champions. But, they had better have kept aloof. For <hi>Harry,</hi> running up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, overturned the Firſt he met with one End of his Staff, and laid a Second at his Feet with the Revolution of the other End, inſomuch that at every Motion, as it were, he diſpatched two Men.</p>
            <p>Neither was <hi>Jack</hi> unactive. The Crowd began to recoil, when, ruſhing into the Midſt, they overthrew ſuch as oppoſed them, and, whirling their Staffs about their Heads, they quickly opened and cleared large Room for themſelves. No One dared to abide within the Wind of their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; and the Mob, flying ſeveral Ways, left our Hero quiet Maſter of the Field of Battle.</p>
            <p>Mean time, the Lady ſtood fixed in utter Aſtoniſhment at the Feats which ſhe had ſeen, when <hi>Harry,</hi> gracefully approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I think myſelf happy, Madam, ſays he, in having done ſome ſmall Service to a Lady of your fair and noble Appearance; of what Country may I preſume? Of <hi>England,</hi> Sir, ſays ſhe, and I am ready to diſcharge my Promiſe of five thouſand Pounds for the gallant Reſcue which you brought to me and my People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0237300105:279"/>
No, Madam, ſaid our Hero, I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe the little Merit of my Humanity by the Acceptance of a Bribe. But I ſhall not be eaſy till I ſee You and your Attendants out of the Reach of theſe <hi>London</hi>-Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. They may return with different Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and a larger Reinforcement. He then called to ſome Porters and, throwing them a Parcel of Silver, ordered them to bring all the Coaches they could muſter. And go You, <hi>Jack,</hi> ſays he, to the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, enquire after the Friends that I told you of, and then follow me to the White Croſs Tavern in <hi>Cheapſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Coaches came, and <hi>Harry</hi> aſſiſted his Porters in carrying, helping, and gently ſtowing the Maimed and the Wounded into half a Dozen of them. He then hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Lady, and next, coming to a Blackamoor Boy, who had a Coronet of Diamonds inſerted in his Cap, he offered to lift him in. But the Youth, bending one Knee to the Duſt, and ſeizing on <hi>Harry</hi>'s Hand, eagerly and repeatedly kiſſed it, crying out in <hi>French,</hi> heavenly, heavenly Creature! and then, breaking into Tears, ſprung into the Coach, and ſat down by the Lady.</p>
            <p>Our Hero then beſtowed the four female Attendants, with ſuch Luggage as was
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0237300105:280"/>brought on Shore, into the four remaining Coaches. Then, graſping his Quarterſtaff, and ordering the Porters to attend, he guarded and eſcorted All ſafe to the White Croſs.</p>
            <p>The firſt Thing he then did was to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der private Apartments for the Lady and her Attendants. He next diſpatched the Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for all the Surgeons in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. He then locked the Room where he ſaw the Luggage ſafe lodged; ordered a ſumptuous Dinner to be prepared as ſoon as poſſible; and, laſtly, diſcharged the Coaches and Porters, who poured their parting Bleſſings upon his Head; and all this he did with wonderful Diſpatch, for <hi>Harry</hi> was now in the wide Element of his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, as a Whale in the Ocean.</p>
            <p>Four Surgeons then came, and our Hero, putting five Guineas apiece into their Hands, deſired them to examine and dreſs their Patients; and ſtaid till he hear'd the delighting Tidings that None of them were incurable. He then ſent up to the Lady to deſire Permiſſion to attend her. She roſe and met him as he entered; Child of Heaven, ſaid ſhe, from which of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Angels have you deſcended? I have heared as well as ſeen what you have won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully done for us. Madam, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> endeavouring to turn the Diſcourſe, I
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0237300105:281"/>would not adviſe you to remove your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for ſome Time: I have ordered Beds and Apartments for them in this Houſe; where thoſe, who are tolerably well, may aſſiſt the Doctors to attend their ſick Fellows till All ſhall be reſtored. In the mean time I have ſent to my Father's for his Coach and Chariot to convey You, and this young Gentleman, and your Women, to our Houſe, where you can want for no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſince my Father, and I, and All will be truely and tenderly your Servants. We are your Property, Sir, ſaid the Lady, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of us as you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>But, pray Madam, ſaid our Hero, what could provoke the Rabble to inſult You and Yours, in the Manner that they did this Day? I proteſt, Sir, ſaid ſhe, I cannot conceive, except it be that, as ſome One ſays in LEAR, <hi>our Countenances liked them not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a little Time after, Dinner was ſerved up, and <hi>Harry,</hi> happening to turn his Head, perceived the black Youth by ſtealth kiſſing the Hat, and preſſing the Gloves to his Boſom that he had laid on a Table.</p>
            <p>Whatever the Darkneſs or Deformity of any Aſpect or Perſon may happen to be, if the ſentimental Beauty of Soul ſhall burſt through the Cloud upon us, the Dark be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0237300105:282"/>Light, the Deformed quite comely, and we begin to affect what was lately our Averſion. Thus it was that <hi>Harry</hi> found himſelf ſuddenly and inevitably attached by the two recent Proofs that this outlandiſh Youth had given of his Affection.</p>
            <p>Being all ſeated, <hi>Harry</hi> looked earneſtly at the young Moor, and turning to the Lady ſaid: I now perceive, Madam, how ridiculous all Sorts of Prejudices are, and find that Time and Obſervation may change our Opinions to the Reverſe of what they were. I once had an Averſion to all Sorts of Blacks, but I avow that there is ſomething ſo amiable in the Face of this Youth, and his Eyes caſt ſuch a Luſtre over the Darkneſs of his Countenance as is enough, as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has it, to make us in love with Night, and pay no more Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the gaudy Sun.</p>
            <p>The Moor, hereat, ſmiled celeſtial Sweetneſs, and Joy beamed from his Eyes and throughout his dimpling Aſpect.</p>
            <p>But who can you be, my ſweet Fellow, ſaid the Lady, who are the Picture, the Image, almoſt the Thing itſelf that I was ſo ſadly in love with five and thirty Years ago? Why, Madam, ſaid our Hero, you could not have been born at that early
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0237300105:283"/>Day. Ah you Flatterer, ſays ſhe, I am turned of Forty. But, pray Madam, who was he that was ſo happy as to attract your infant Affections? — His Name was <hi>Harry Clinton</hi> — Why, Madam, <hi>Harry Clinton</hi> is my Name. — <hi>Harry Clinton, Harry Clinton!</hi> ſcreamed out the Lady, and ſtarted up from her Chair; — Yes, Madam, I am Son to the Earl of <hi>Moreland,</hi> and I almoſt dare to hope that you were once the enchanting <hi>Fanny Goodall.</hi>—Yes, my lovely Kinſman, I am indeed your <hi>Fanny Goodall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then ſprung forward, and ſeizing her Hand, kept it dwelling on his Lips. But, diſengaging it, ſhe opened her Arms and claſped him to her Boſom, and wept over him as a Mother would over a long-loſt Son. While the young <hi>Moor</hi> ran and danced about the Room, like a mad Thing, clapping Hands, and ſpringing, like an <hi>Antelope,</hi> almoſt to the Cieling.</p>
            <p>When they were ſomething compoſed, the <hi>Moor</hi> caught the Lady about the Neck and kiſſing her, cried, Joy, Joy, my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Madam, the greateſt of all Joys! Then turning to our Hero, he took each of his Hands, in Turns, and preſſed them to his Lips, while <hi>Harry,</hi> kiſſing his Forehead, cried, my Brother, my Brother!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0237300105:284"/>
When they were again ſet to Dinner, <hi>Jack</hi> entered. My Lord, ſays he, I have been all along the Quays and the Shipping, but can learn no Tidings of the Marquis <hi>D'Aubigny,</hi> nor of any <hi>French</hi> Family ſave that of the Dutcheſs <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who, this Morning, came up the River with a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Train.</p>
            <p>Well, ſays <hi>Harry,</hi> our Happineſs has been already quite ſufficient to the Day. To morrow may crown our Wiſhes with full Succeſs.</p>
            <p>No, my Love, ſaid the Lady, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the Marquis for ſome Time. The Truth is that you find, in me, your <hi>Fanny Goodall,</hi> the Marchioneſs <hi>D'Aubigny,</hi> and the Ducheſs <hi>de Bouillon.</hi> But theſe Matters ſhall be explaimed more clearly, when I am bleſſed with the Sight of your precious Uncle.</p>
            <p>News was now brought that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages were at the Door, when, taking a haſty Bit or two, they viſited and left Orders for the Care of the Sick and Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then ſet out in a Hurry for <hi>Pal Mall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they arrived, the Dutcheſs haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened in, enquiring for Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0237300105:285"/>when ſhe came where he was, ſhe cried out, as ſhe advanced, and as he roſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her, your <hi>Fanny,</hi> your <hi>Fanny Goodall,</hi> my Couſin! and throwing herſelf into his Arms, dwelt there for a Minute. Then recoiling awhile, ſhe looked fondly at him and cried, your Siſter alſo, my Brother, your Siſter <hi>D'Aubigny!</hi> the Wife of the Brother of your heavenly <hi>Louiſa!</hi> then claſping him to her Arms, ſhe broke into Tears; and again, quitting him, ſat down to quiet her Emotions.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> having ſeated himſelf affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately beſide her, ſaid: Theſe are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous Things that you tell me, my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Siſter; by what Miracle have theſe Bleſſings been brought about?</p>
            <p>I am too much agitated at preſent, ſays ſhe, let me have a little Coffee, and the Matter ſhall be unravelled.</p>
            <p>As they were ſettling to the Tea-table, give me Leave, Sir, ſaid the Ducheſs, to introduce my little black Companion to your Notice. He is a ſweet Fellow I aſſure you, notwithſtanding his Complexion. He is Child to our royal Friend the Emperor of <hi>Morocco,</hi> who has entruſted him to our Guardianſhip for his Travel and Education. However he might have come by his ſable Outſide, his Father, the great <hi>Abenamin,</hi>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0237300105:286"/>is the leaſt of the tawny of any Man I ſaw in <hi>Africa,</hi> and his Mother is one of the faireſt and fineſt Women that ever opened a Pair of living Diamonds to the Light; but, ſhe took Fright, while ſhe was preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, at the ſudden Sight of a <hi>Blackamoor.</hi> But, my Brother, I ſhall more particularly recommend him to your Regard, by tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you that he is an exceedingly pious Chriſtian, though as playful as Lambs and as chuckling as Infancy.</p>
            <p>She then turned and, taking the little <hi>Abenamin</hi> by the Hand, led him up and placed him before her Brother. When the Youth, ſuddenly dropping on his Knees, looked up to Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> with Eyes that ſpoke Love and reverential Awe, and beſought his Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>The old Gentleman found himſelf ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizingly affected and, lifting up his Hands, cried, God be gracious to you, my Child, and make your Soul as bright as your Countenance is ſable! and may the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhine with Power upon you, and ſoon diſperſe or illumine every Shade that is about You. The Prince embraced his Legs, kiſſed his Knees, and aroſe.</p>
            <p>Soon as the Coffee was removed, You may remember, my deareſt Couſin, ſaid
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0237300105:287"/>the Ducheſs, in what a Hurry I laſt parted from you. Mr. <hi>Fairface,</hi> with whom the Bulk of my Fortune was depoſited, went off with above a hundred thouſand Pounds of my Subſtance, beſide four times that Value entruſted to him by Others.</p>
            <p>I traced him to <hi>Paris,</hi> and there he had the Impudence to give me an Interview, but at the ſame Time had the Impudence to bid me Defiance.</p>
            <p>Immediately I commenced Suit, and ſent diſpatch to <hi>London</hi> for my Papers and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
            <p>On the Opening of my Cauſe in Court, I was ſummoned by the Title of Counteſs of <hi>Maitland,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Frances Goodall.</hi> On hearing the Name, a Gentleman who was near me ſtarted, and turning and coming up, Pray, Madam, ſays he, are you any way related to the honourable <hi>Harry Clinton,</hi> who once went by that Name in this City? I am Sir, ſaid I, almoſt the neareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he has upon Earth. — He is, Madam, my deareſt Friend and Brother. Pray ſpeak to your Advocates to poſtpone your Suit for a few Days, till I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Nature and Merits of your Cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0237300105:288"/>
This was accordingly done. He deſired to know where I lodged, and in leſs than an Hour his Chariot was at my Door.</p>
            <p>Except yourſelf, my Couſin, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis had the moſt lovely and winning Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and Perſon that ever I beheld. I ſoon convinced him of the Equity of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and of the Villainy of my Truſtee, and made him perfect Maſter of the whole Affair. But he ſtill continued to viſit, and to ſtay with me a conſiderable Part of every Day, under Colour of being better inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed touching this and t'other Particular, the remaining Time was ſpent in ſoliciting for me.</p>
            <p>At length a Hearing came on; and, after a ſhort Trial honeſt <hi>Fairface</hi> was caſt in Principal and double Coſts. He was inſtantly taken into Cuſtody, and put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Confinement, till he diſcharged the whole Amount of the Judgment in my Favour.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was one Suit over, wherein I was Plaintiff, but Another was commenced wherein I happened to prove but a very weak Defendant. The Marquis now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Solicitor for himſelf, but with ſuch a ſweet Timidity as ſeemed to doubt, and greatly dread the Succeſs of his Cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0237300105:289"/>
I could not refuſe my Time to him who had devoted the Whole of his Time and Aſſiduity to me. We ſpent whole Days together. But O, what Floods of Tears did that Time (at Times) coſt both him and me, while he pathetically and feelingly related your Hiſtory, from the Place where you broke off, to the Death of your <hi>Louiſa</hi> and your precious Infants.</p>
            <p>I believe, my Couſin, that, as Grief is a greater Softener, ſo it is a greater Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter of Hearts than any other Paſſion. I gave the Marquis, in my Turn, my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Story, and dwelt on every tender Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteneſs of my infant Paſſion for you. Ah, ſaid he, what a pity that a Heart, ſo ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of all divine and humane Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſhould ſit as a lonely Turtle, upon the Houſe-top, without a ſuitable Mate.</p>
            <p>I took him for that Mate, my Couſin, and in a Huſband I found the trueſt and tendereſt of Lovers. I became pregnant, for the firſt Time of my Life, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of a ſweet and promiſing little Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, whom we left at Nurſe in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Seat, while I attended my Lord on his Embaſſy to <hi>Morocco:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, here I muſt ſtop, my Brother, I am under the poſitive Interdiction of an
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0237300105:290"/>imperial Thing called a Huſband, not to divulge a Word further till he ſees you Face to Face. But I truſt that he has bleſſed Tidings for you, my Brother, he ſays that he, otherwiſe, would not have dared to preſent himſelf before you, after his Loſs of your <hi>Eloiſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> ſmiled (careleſs) as at the Impoſſibility of any conſoling Event upon Earth. Again, ſmiling archly, I proteſt, my Siſter, ſaid he, you appear to me to grow younger for your Years. I ſee no Manner of Alteration, ſave that you are ſomething plumper, and not quite ſo ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as when we parted. O, ſays ſhe, laughing, there may be a Reaſon in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for that.</p>
            <p>I rejoice at Heart to hear it, ſaid Mr. <hi>Clinton;</hi> but pray, when may we expect my Brother? — In about two Months; at preſent he is engaged with the King, who is extremely fond of him, and lately created him a Duke, on account of the Services which he rendered the State in <hi>Africa.</hi> We received your dear Letter, my deareſt Brother, at <hi>Paris,</hi> but wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who the ſweet Fellow could be who was ſaid to accompany you.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, our Hero and the young Prince were in cloſe Combination.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0237300105:291"/>
               <hi>Abenamin</hi> ſtepped about, and about <hi>Harry,</hi> and toyed with him, and twiſted the Curls of his careleſs Locks around his Fingers. Then turning and looking fondly up in his Face, Ah, how fair, ſays he, does this black Viſage of mine ſhew in thoſe fine Eyes of yours! It is in Truth, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> ſo fair in my Eyes, that I would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change it for fifteen of the faireſt female Faces in <hi>Britain.</hi> The Prince then caught his Hand and preſſed it to his Boſom. But what ſhall I call you, ſays he, you are a great Lord in this Country, and, in my own Country I am greater than a Lord. But I hate the Formality of Titles between Friends, and I will call you my <hi>Harry,</hi> provided you promiſe to call me your <hi>Abe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namin.</hi> A Bargain, ſays <hi>Harry,</hi> let us ſeal it with a Kiſs! No, no, ſays the Prince, we never kiſs Lips in <hi>Africa,</hi> but I will kiſs your Head, and your Hands, and your Feet too with Pleaſure. But tell me, <hi>Harry,</hi> what makes you ſo mighty clever a Fellow, will you teach me to be a clever Fellow alſo? Ay, that I will, ſays <hi>Harry,</hi> and to beat myſelf too, provided you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe not to hit me over hard. <hi>Abenamin</hi> fell a laughing, and aimed a little Fiſt as though he meant to overturn him.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as <hi>Harry</hi>'s Grief, for his late <hi>Maria,</hi> would allow him to aſſociate, he
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0237300105:292"/>had been to ſeek his old Friend and Tutor Mr. <hi>Clement,</hi> but he found only a ſingle Domeſtic at home, who told him that the old Gentleman had been ſome Time dead, and that the Family were lately gone to take Poſſeſſion of a new Seat that they had purchaſed in the Country.</p>
            <p>However, as <hi>Harry</hi> found himſelf quite happy in the preſent Society, he ſought no further Acquaintance or Amuſement in <hi>London.</hi> In leſs than three Weeks, the Retinue of the Prince and the Dutcheſs were well reſtored, and they All ſet out for <hi>Enfield,</hi> there to await the wiſhed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the Duke.</p>
            <p>They ſlept the firſt Night at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and toward the Noon of the third Day they ſet up at the Angel Inn in <hi>Coventry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It happened to be a Seaſon of Feſtivity in the Town. Over againſt the front Windows, a Stage had been erected for a Mountebank and his Merry Andrew; and, as ſoon as they had diſmounted, it became a Stage for Combatants. Two Quarterſtaffs and a Pair of Baſket-hilted Cudgels lay thereon; while an adjoining Pole was hung with a Variety of Prizes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined to the Conquerors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:0237300105:293"/>
Immediatley two Champions mounted, with two Seconds appointed to ſee fair Play. But One of the Combatants was quickly diſmiſſed with a broken Head. Another then ſucceeded, and then Another, to the Amount of half a Score, but the firſt Hero ſtill kept the Field of Battle. While <hi>Harry</hi> ſat, with his Company, looking out of the Dining-Room Windows at the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>Jack</hi> came behind his Lord, and giving him a Touch on the Shoulder, whiſperingly begged his Permiſſion to claim the Stage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> aſſented. <hi>Jack</hi> was up in a Twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and quickly diſpatched the Victor, as he had ſerved his Predeceſſors. A Number of Candidates then ſucceeded, but with no better Fortune; and the Prize was taking down to be deliver'd to our Friend <hi>Jack;</hi> when an elderly looking Man deſired to be lifted on the Stage.</p>
            <p>Come, ſays he to <hi>Jack,</hi> you ſeem to be a clever Fellow, let us quit this Boy's Play, and take up the Quarterſtaff; when <hi>Jack,</hi> remembering a Piece of an old Ballad, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, <hi>accurſs'd be he, Earl</hi> Piercy <hi>ſaid, by whom it is deny'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0237300105:294"/>
They graſped their formidable Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and Each threw himſelf into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Poſture of Defence. Then began the Work to grow warm, and theſe Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had twice traverſed the whole Round of the Stage, before a Wound or Bruiſe was received on either Part.</p>
            <p>At the third Bout, the old Stager made a Feint at his Adverſary's left Leg, and, in attempting to defend it, the Sconce of our Friend <hi>Jack</hi> was cover'd with Blood, and he ſprung off the Stage and inſtantly vaniſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then ſtepped backward and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Servant to be called, and, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cried, Ah my poor <hi>Jack!</hi> I knew what would be your Fate the Moment I ſaw the Face of your Opponent. You unfortunatley met with the famous <hi>Oakum,</hi> the old Prizer of <hi>Iſlington;</hi> many and many a Leſſon have I got from him. But, you may happen to get ſome Satisfaction ere long. Run, and give yonder Fool a Crown, for the Loan of his patched Coat for a few Minutes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jack</hi> flew on his Embaſſy, while <hi>Harry</hi> burned a Stick at a back Room Fire, with which he made to himſelf very formidable Eyebrows and Whiſkers. Then, hurry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0237300105:295"/>on the Fool's Coat, he ſtepped forth and deſired to be lifted on the Stage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oakum</hi> little expected a ſecond Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but, when he ſaw the Merry-Andrew, as he ſuppoſed, he had like to be ſuffocated by a ſudden Fit of Laughter, while the Crowd tore the Elements to Fritters with their Clamour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then put himſelf in an aukward and peaſant-like Poſture, while <hi>Oakum,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing careleſly, made a ſlight but, as he thought, demoliſhing Stroke at him. But <hi>Harry,</hi> ſetting it aſide with the one End of his Staff, gave <hi>Oakum,</hi> with the other End, as it were a chance Chuck under the Chin, and toſſed him on the broad of his Back along the Stage.</p>
            <p>The Shouts of the Populace were then redoubled. At length <hi>Oakum,</hi> ariſing, fixed his Eyes upon <hi>Harry</hi> with an inquiſitive Aſtoniſhment, as deſirous of knowing how this Buſineſs came about. While <hi>Harry,</hi> with a Grin of ſtupid Amazement, ſeemed equally to wonder at what he had done.</p>
            <p>Again they ſet themſelves in hoſtile Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. <hi>Oakum</hi> then aimed a diſabling Stroke at <hi>Harry's</hi> right Shin; but <hi>Harry,</hi> quick as Thought, ſlipping his Leg back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0237300105:296"/>gave the Weapon Room to paſs, and, at the ſame Time, beſtowing a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Tip on the Crown of his old Maſter, he cut him along the Skull, and gave him once more to meaſure his Length upon the Boards.</p>
            <p>The Crowd ſtood awhile ſilent, as ſcarce crediting what had paſſed before their Eyes, till <hi>Oakum,</hi> riſing and ſtaggering, and again faſtening his Sight upon our Hero, cried aloud, either You muſt be the DEVIL or young HARRY FENTON.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then ſtepped up, and put his Mouth to the Ear of his Adverſary. <hi>Oakum,</hi> ſays he, here are five Guineas to help toward the Cure of your broken Head. But remember that it is not honourable for the Maſters of our Science to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Competition againſt the Ignorant. <hi>Oakum</hi> bowed and withdrew; crying, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be praiſed that it is no Other than my own Scholar who foils me.</p>
            <p>The Clamours of the Populace now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came outrageous. The Prize of a ſilver'd Coronet interwoven with Laurel, was pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down in a hurry and placed on the Head of our Hero. All the Towns-people then put their Hands in their Pockets, and, muſtering their Shillings and Sixpences, threw them in Showers on the Stage;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0237300105:297"/>while the Dutcheſs, Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and the generous <hi>Abenamin</hi> alſo emptied their Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, to reward the Proweſs of the Man who had vindicated the Quarrel of their favourite <hi>Jack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this Profuſion of Money was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gathered up, by the two Seconds, and delivered in a Hat full of Silver to <hi>Harry,</hi> who, beſtowing a Handful on Each, delivered the Remainder to his Man <hi>Jack</hi> who ſtood by the Stage.</p>
            <p>The Crowd then aſcended, and, laying violent Hands on our Hero, bore him tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly away. They then placed him in an Arm-Chair erected on long Poles, and, hoiſing his Carriage on their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they carried him in the Midſt of Peals of Shouts up the Street, while an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Herald went before them and cried, O the FOOL, the FOOL, the brave, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble FOOL, who beats the Skill of the Wiſe, and the Acts of the Mighty to Pieces! At length, <hi>Harry,</hi> growing tired of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, put his Hand on the Head of one of his Carriers, vaulted lightly over, inſtantly vaniſhed from their Sight, and flew up Stairs to his Company.</p>
            <p>His Friends now began to recognize their <hi>Harry,</hi> in the Coat of the Fool, and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0237300105:298"/>broke into repeated Fits of Laughter. <hi>Abenamin</hi> then turned to his beloved Friend and cried, what's become of my handſome <hi>Harry?</hi> why, he is turned to almoſt as ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Fellow as myſelf. Then, kiſſing his Forehead and ſtroaking his Cheeks, he ſaid, O, It was the clevereſt and darlingeſt FOOL that ever I knew in the livelong Days that I have paſſed upon Earth.</p>
            <p>When the Populace perceived their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Fool ſeated in the Midſt of Quality, they All gathered to the Inn, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced their Shouts anew. But <hi>Harry,</hi> calling for his Hat of Silver, as alſo for all the Change that could be muſtered in the Houſe, amounting to the Value of about thirty Guineas, he threw his Caſh in Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls on every Side, till he was nearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and that the Crowd cried out, Enough, enough, your Honour, too much, too much indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O, that All would equally learn to ſet Bounds to their Avarice!</p>
            <p>When Dinner was over, and that <hi>Harry</hi> was reſtored to his former Self, our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, again, ſet out on their Journey, amidſt the Bleſſings and Acclamations of the whole City, who had ranged themſelves on, each Side, to behold and pay them Obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance as they paſs'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:0237300105:299"/>
The next Day, as they ſtopped at a Village to repair the fractured Harneſs of an over mettled Horſe; <hi>Harry,</hi> mean while, took a walk with his <hi>Abenamin</hi> along the Road. In their Way they came to a long and waſte Cottage, where they heared the confuſed clattering of junior Voices. <hi>Harry</hi> ſtepped to the Door, and, looking in, perceived about forty or fifty Boys rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Benches of Turf, while a Man of a pale Aſpect ſat on a decayed Chair, inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in their Leſſons.</p>
            <p>Your Servant, Sir, ſays <hi>Harry,</hi> pray what Language do you teach? — I can teach <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> too, ſo pleaſe your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but the People of this Country chooſe to confine themſelves to the Language of old <hi>England.</hi>—If I am not too free, Sir, pray what is your Name?—<hi>Longfield,</hi> ſo pleaſe your Honour.—<hi>Longfield, Longfield?</hi> I have ſurely heared that Name before. Pray, were you ever acquainted with a Man called <hi>Hammel Clement? — Hammel Clement,</hi> Sir? he was my deareſt Friend, the Friend whom I injured, the Friend of my Heart! — Then, cries <hi>Harry,</hi> you are the Friend of my Heart too, my <hi>Longfield,</hi> and ſo ſaying, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and preſſed him to his Boſom.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="299-348" type="pages">
            <pb n="299" facs="tcp:0237300105:300"/>
            <p>The poor Man ſhrunk back, in half Wonder and half Terror at what this might mean, but the benevolent <hi>Harry</hi> ſoon quieted his Apprehenſions. Your Friend <hi>Clement,</hi> ſays-he, is come to great Fortune, and, I dare anſwer for him, would be nearly diſtracted with Joy at your Sight, and would gladly divide his Subſtance with you; but, if you pleaſe, you ſhall be no Incumbrance upon his growing Family. You ſhall inſtantly come with me, and, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jacob,</hi> regard not your Stuff, for the Good of all my Lands lies before You, my <hi>Longfield.</hi> And I rejoice more in acquiring ſuch a Heart as Yours, than if I had acquired the Poſſeſſion of a Province.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then called a few of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in, and giving them ſome Guineas, to be changed and divided among the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in order to enable them to ſee a new Maſter, He and <hi>Abenamin</hi> took the thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare <hi>Longfield,</hi> on each Side, under the Arm, and carried him away.</p>
            <p>When they came to the Turn that led to the Manſion Houſe, <hi>Harry</hi> perceived with much Pleaſure, that the two School-Houſes, which he had put in Hand before the Death of his Father, were now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated. They ſtood oppoſite to each
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0237300105:301"/>other, with the Road between them. Their Fronts were of hewn Stone; and a ſmall Cupola roſe over Each, with Bells to ſummon the Children to Meals and to Leſſon.</p>
            <p>Here, <hi>Longfield,</hi> ſays our Hero, is to be your Province. You are to ſuperintend theſe Schools, at a Salary of three hundred a Year. And I will ſoon ſend you, with proper Means, throughout the Country, to muſter me a Hundred choſen Children of each Sex, for I yearn to be a Father, <hi>Longfield,</hi> and to gather my Family of Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Ones under my Eye and my Wing.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they alighted, Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> and his <hi>Harry</hi> once more welcomed the Dutcheſs and her <hi>Abenamin</hi> to their Home and their Hearts, and the late Houſe of Mourning became a Houſe of Joy.</p>
            <p>Above All, <hi>Abenamin</hi> inſpired Mirth and Good humour throughout the Family; and Melancholy fled before him wherever he turned. He was daily inventive of new Matters of Entertainment. He danced <hi>African</hi> Dances, for them, with wonderful Action and Grace; and he ſung <hi>African</hi> Songs that imitated and exceeded the wild and inarticulate Warblings of the Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale. So that he became the Darling and little Idol of the whole Houſhold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0237300105:302"/>
               <hi>Harry</hi> had ſent for the Town Taylor, and got <hi>Longfield</hi> fitted with three or four Suits from his Father's Wardrobe. He then ſent him on his Commiſſion, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Mr. <hi>Truſtly</hi> the Agent, whom he ordered to ſhew him the Country, to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to the ſeveral Families of the Peaſantry, and to furniſh him with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Sums he ſhould call for.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, our Hero and <hi>Abe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namin</hi> became inſeparable. He made the Prince a Preſent of his little dreſſed Jennet, and at Times rode out with him, and taught him the Manage. At other Times they would run and wreſtle, and play a hundred Gambols through the Walks and the Gardens.</p>
            <p>Did you ever ſee the Chaſe of the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope, <hi>Harry?</hi>—Not I truely.—You ſhan't be long ſo, ſays the Prince. Go, gather me all the Houſe, Man, Woman, and Child before the Door here. You ſhall be the Huntſman, and I will be the Antelope, and if any of your People can catch me, in a Mile's Running, they ſhall have my Cap for a Kerchief.</p>
            <p>Immediately the whole Poſſe was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, to the amount of about ſixty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0237300105:303"/>Male and Female; and Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> and the Dutcheſs, hearing what they were about, came laughing to the Door to ſee the Diverſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then gave his royal Antelope about fifty Yards Law, then cried, away! and inſtantly all Heels and all Voices were looſed after him.</p>
            <p>The Prince then turned, and bounded over an Aha, that was ſunk on the right Side of the Avenue, then, clearing ſeveral other Obſtacles, whereby he threw out the greateſt Number of his Purſuers, he at length reached the Fields, and ſhot away like an Arrow.</p>
            <p>Our Friend <hi>Jack</hi> headed about nine fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and domeſtic Footmen, who ſtill held the Chaſe, though at a Diſtance; while <hi>Abenamin</hi> led them a Round of above a Mile. Then, turning ſhort homeward, he came flying up the Avenue, with only <hi>Jack</hi> and two Followers puffing far behind. At length, reaching near the Door, the Prince threw himſelf precipitately into the Arms of his Friend, as it were for Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, crying, Save me, my <hi>Harry,</hi> ſave, ſave your little Antelope!</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> and the Dutcheſs, then, ſucceſſively embraced the Victor, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0237300105:304"/>him Joy. I proteſt, <hi>Harry,</hi> cried Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> I will bet a thouſand Pieces with you, on the Head of my <hi>Abenamin</hi> againſt your famous <hi>Polly Truck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Night, as our Hero ſat with the Prince in his Apartment, Have You ever been in Love, my <hi>Harry,</hi> ſays he? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> that I have had my Twitches and Tendencies that Way.</p>
            <p>He then gave him a Narrative of the Struggles of his Heart, reſpecting the fair <hi>Aggy Jeſſamin.</hi> And again he related to him the Tragedy of his faithful <hi>Maria,</hi> which coſt the Prince the drenching of a Handkerchief in Tears.</p>
            <p>Ah, exclaimed the Prince, never, never will I forgive your <hi>Maria</hi> her Death! Why was it not my Lot, by ſome ſeverer Doom, to prove to you the Superiority of my Friendſhip and Affection? What, cried <hi>Harry,</hi> would you not leave me a ſingle Companion upon Earth? when my <hi>Abena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> quits the World, I ſhall alſo bid it adieu!</p>
            <p>When Tears were wiped away, the Prince took his Friend by the Hand and ſaid: I have a Siſter, my Brother, a Siſter twinned with me in the Womb, and as fair
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0237300105:305"/>as I am black. All <hi>Africa</hi> is pleaſed to hail her as the Beauty of the Univerſe, but the Truth is, that I think but poorly of her. The Duke brought her with him to <hi>France,</hi> and, ſhould he bring her to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> beware of your Heart, my <hi>Harry!</hi> for, though I am prejudiced againſt her, ſhe is the Idol of all Others, who bow down to her, as before a little Divinity. This has made her ſo exceſſively vain, that ſhe holds herſelf of a different Species from the reſt of Mankind, and thinks the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the World nothing leſs than her Right. And now, my <hi>Harry,</hi> though I earneſtly wiſh to be allied to you, by a Tie, nearer if poſſible than that of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, yet I would not wiſh my own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, at the Expence of your Peace; and ſo I give you timely Warning againſt this dangerous and haughty Girl.</p>
            <p>Our Company had now been upward of ſix Weeks at the Manſion Houſe. <hi>Harry,</hi> hitherto, had never ſeen any Part of the Country, or any Part of his own Eſtate, above a Mile from the Houſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, leaving his Friend <hi>Abenamin</hi> in Bed, in the Preſumption of his being tired with his laſt Day's Fatigue, He iſſued early forth, accompanied only by <hi>Jack</hi> and his Agent's Runner, who knew and was known every where.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:0237300105:306"/>
With their Staffs in their Hands, they croſſed and quartered the Country, at Pleaſure, without Let or Obſtacle.</p>
            <p>At length, they came within Proſpect of a Houſe ſumptuouſly fronted, and of a happy Situation. <hi>Harry</hi> ſtopped here, with Pleaſure, comparing, as he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Acquirements of Art with the Advantages of Nature; when a Servant iſſued forth, and humbly beſought him to walk in. <hi>Harry</hi> heard the Voice of Muſic. What is your Maſter's Name, ſays he? <hi>Fielding,</hi> ſo pleaſe your Honour, and we are this Day celebrating the Nuptials of his Son, the young Squire.</p>
            <p>The Maſter of the Family met our Hero at the outward Door. <hi>Harry</hi> recoiled at recognizing the Face of the Mr. <hi>Fielding,</hi> whom he had ſeen at <hi>Hamſtead,</hi> but, taking no Notice, walked with him into the Houſe.</p>
            <p>Breakfaſt, ſoon after, was uſhered in, and Mrs. <hi>Fielding,</hi> and Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharines,</hi> and <hi>Ned</hi> came with his bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bluſhing Bride to the Table.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> chuckled and rejoiced at Heart, but ſtill took no Note; when, after ſome
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0237300105:307"/>curſory Converſation, <hi>Ned</hi> looked at him with an eager Diſturbance and cried, Bleſs me, my Heart tells me that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in that Face which is not quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me. If I could think, after my many and late Enquiries, that my Patron was alive, bating the Difference of Years, I ſhould verily believe that you were—your <hi>Harry Fenton,</hi> cried our Hero, ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, your <hi>Harry Fenton,</hi> my dear <hi>Ned!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then opened his Arms to receive his Friend, while <hi>Ned</hi> leaped and catched at him, as the grapling Iron of a Corſair would catch at a Ship from which great Prize was expected,</p>
            <p>All the Family then, ſo highly as they had been obliged by our Hero and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtruggled who ſhould be foremoſt in their Acknowledgments and Careſſes. The holy <hi>Catharines,</hi> fondly taking him to his Arms cried, Chriſt be gracious to you, my Child! and may the God, who has formed you as an Angel upon Earth, make you alſo of the higheſt Order of Angels in Heaven!</p>
            <p>After Dinner, <hi>Harry</hi> roſe and took his Leave, but they all got in a Group and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Paſſage, telling him he muſt be their Priſoner for that Night. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, only on this Condition, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0237300105:308"/>that you promiſe to dine with me, All, To-morrow. Why pray Sir, where do you live, ſays Mr. <hi>Fielding?</hi> At <hi>Enfield,</hi> with the young Earl of <hi>Moreland,</hi> ſays <hi>Harry,</hi> but he has a great Friendſhip for me, and the Houſe is as it were my own.</p>
            <p>Much Company arrived in the Evening, and the Ball was opened and held till late. But our Hero declined dancing, that his Friend <hi>Ned</hi> might ſtand forth peerleſs in the Eyes of his Bride.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> roſe, by the Dawning, and footed it in an Hour to <hi>Enfield.</hi> He flew up Stairs to ſalute the Family, but found no One, ſave Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> from whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, at once, a warm Bleſſing and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace.</p>
            <p>Where is the Dutcheſs, Sir, and my Friend <hi>Abenamin?</hi> Gone, <hi>Harry,</hi> ſays his Uncle, about Breakfaſt Time Yeſterday; a Courier arrived with the joyful Tidings that my Brother was on the Road, and ſo my Siſter and our <hi>Abenamin</hi> haſtened to meet him. By this Time I ſuppoſe they are All on their Return. And now take Care of yourſelf, my <hi>Harry.</hi> The Duke brings with him the Siſter of our <hi>Abenamin,</hi> the fair Princeſs <hi>Abenaidè;</hi> the Dutcheſs tells me that a lovelier Creature never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0237300105:309"/>the Light; ſo that you muſt guard your Heart with double Bars, againſt the Power of this Beauty.—She is vain and diſdainful, Sir, exceſſively vain, I am told, ſo that her Pride will prove an Antidote againſt the Poiſon of her Charms. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I will haſte to meet and welcome your moſt noble Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> was mounted on a haughty Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that coſt fifteen hundred Guineas when a Colt in <hi>Mauritania.</hi> He was white as new fallen Snow, ſave a black Mane and Tail, one Foot jet Black to the Joint of the Fetlock, and three large blood-like Spots on the far Shoulder. He was ſo perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and ſubdued to the Manage, that he ſeemed to have no Will ſave the Will of his Rider, while <hi>Harry</hi>'s leaſt Motion, like Electricity, informed every Joint and Member. O, that the Wills of all Men were equally ſubdued to the Sceptre of the Prince of Righteouſneſs, reigning and ruling within them!</p>
            <p>The Princeſs came foremoſt in an open Chariot drawn by ſix ſpotted Arabians. The Chariot was plated all around in bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Gold emblazoned with Gems of Luſtre. But, if the Eye could ſcarce bear the Blaze of the Vehicle, much leſs could it ſupport the Brightneſs of the Beauty who ſat enthroned within it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:0237300105:310"/>
               <hi>Harry</hi> bowed twice, as he approached, but ſhe ſcare deigned a perceptible Nod of Acknowledgment to his Salute.—Our Hero felt himſelf piqued. Proud Beauty! thought he, I thank you for your timely Prevention of a Paſſion that, perhaps, might have proved unhappy to me. He then paſſed forward with affected Careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſalute the Duke.</p>
            <p>When he came up, the Coach ſtopped, and <hi>Harry,</hi> flying from his Saddle, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Window, while his Steed ſtood trembling but motionleſs behind him.</p>
            <p>My Lord, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> ſeizing the Duke's Hand and reſpectfully kiſſing it, if you were ſenſible of the Joy that my Heart receives from your Preſence, I think it would make you nearly as happy as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. My ſweet Fellow, ſaid the Duke, I have often heard of you at <hi>Paris,</hi> as alſo by the Letters of my Love here; my Longing at laſt is gratified, though my Wonder is encreaſed.</p>
            <p>But Madam, ſays <hi>Harry,</hi> what have you done with my little Playfellow, what's become of my <hi>Abenamin?</hi> O, cried the Dutcheſs, laughing, he is forthcoming I
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0237300105:311"/>warrant you; but what has ſo bewitched you to him? I think you could not be fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if he were a Miſtreſs. True, Madam, anſwered <hi>Harry,</hi> ſighing, I never look to have a Miſtreſs that I ſhall love half as well; but pray put me out of Pain, and let me know where he is. Be pacified, ſaid the ſmiling Duke, he is not far off; and here is my Hand and Promiſe that you ſhall ſee him before Night.</p>
            <p>Our Hero then turned, and touching his left Hand to the Shoulder of his Horſe, he roſe perpendicular, like a Pyramid of Fire, and again deſcended on his Seat, as a Flake of Snow on a Roſe-Bud. He then touched his white Wand to the Neck of his Steed, who inſtantly mounted the Air, like a winged <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> while the Dutcheſs ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, thinking her <hi>Harry</hi> a gone Man, but he returned as compoſed, as though he were ſeated on a Bed of Cotton.</p>
            <p>The Coach now began to move, and <hi>Harry</hi> put his Wand to the Flank of his Horſe, who, turning his Head to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as of his own Accord, moved ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long toward <hi>Enfield,</hi> with a proud but gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Prancing; while the Duke cried out, Look, look! O the Boy, O the Boy, the lovely glorious Boy!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:0237300105:312"/>
As our Hero attended the Carriage of the Duke, the Princeſs and her Train had got to the Houſe and alighted, while <hi>Harry</hi> opened the Coach Door, and handed out the noble Pair, who alternately kiſſed and took him to their Arms. Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> then came forth and received them All with Tranſport. But <hi>Harry,</hi> under ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, walked away, ruminating, in order to avoid the diſdainful Regards of the young Lady.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, our Company, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, and careſſing Each other all the Way, had got ſlowly, though very loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the great Manſion Parlour. The Duke then, reſpectfully taking the young Lady by the Hand, Permit me, Brother, ſays he, to recommend to you my lovely Ward, the fair Princeſs of <hi>Morocco.</hi> The Lady then gently bent one Knee toward the Ground, while ſhe received the cordial Bleſſing and Salute of the old Gentleman.</p>
            <p>They then took their Seats. When, Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> while he looked more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the Princeſs, grew ſuddenly affected, and called out for a Glaſs of fair Water and Hartſhorn. When he drank it, be found himſelf in a Meaſure reſtored, and, lifting his Hands, he cried, I proteſt One would think that Nature had copied this
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0237300105:313"/>young and lovely Creature from an Image that has lain impreſſed upon my Heart, near theſe forty Years.</p>
            <p>You are in the right, my Brother, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the Duke, it is even as you ſurmize. Allow me then, once more, to introduce to you the Counterpart of our once adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Louiſa,</hi> to introduce to you my Niece and your own Offspring, my Brother, even the Daughter of your ſtill living and ever precious <hi>Eloiſa.</hi> The Princeſs then ſprung forward, and, dropping precipitately at the Feet of her Grandfather, ſhe put her Face between his Knees, and, ſeizing both Hands, ſhe bathed them with her Tears, crying, My Father, O my Father, my dear, my deareſt Father, how inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bleſſed I think myſelf, to be the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of ſuch a Father! Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> then raiſing her, and ſeating her fondly on his Knee, and graſping her to his Boſom, I will not aſk, he cried, how theſe Miracles came about, it is enough that I feel the Attraction which pulls you into my Heart. And ſo ſaying, their Tears flowed, till they mingled on the Flooring.</p>
            <p>Go, my Angel, ſaid Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> and take yonder Seat, that I may view and delight my Soul with your Sight, at Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. My Eyes begin, at theſe Years, to ſee beſt at a Diſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:0237300105:314"/>
At length, the ſoft Voice of our <hi>Harry</hi> was heard in the Hall, and the Duke, whiſpering his Brother, requeſted him, for a little Time, to take no Notice of what had paſſed.</p>
            <p>Our Hero then entered, bowing reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and gracefully, but careleſly toward the Side where the Princeſs ſat. He then took his Seat beſide the Duke, and bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fondly to him, and ſeizing a Hand, with both his Hands, he preſſed it to his Lips and cried, Welcome, welcome, my deareſt Lord, to the Houſe and the Hearts of your trueſt Lovers!</p>
            <p>Then, giving a Glance to the Side where the Princeſs ſat, he caught a Glimpſe of her Attractions and, ſighing, ſaid to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, O, the Pity, the Pity! But, no Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; her Pride ſhall never ſuffer a ſingle Charm to take Place; and, ſo thinking, he turned his Eyes aſide.</p>
            <p>Mean time, <hi>Abenaidè</hi> aroſe, with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Noiſe as a Hare from her Seat; and ſtealing round, like a Cat circumventing a Mouſe, She came behind <hi>Harry</hi>'s Chair, and reaching, and covering an Eye, with each of her Hands, ſhe turned his Head to her, and made a Sound with her Lips,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0237300105:315"/>as though ſhe had kiſſed him. <hi>Harry</hi> opened his Eyes in utter Aſtoniſhment, while in a Twinkling ſtanding before him, ſhe chuckled a Laugh and cried, Ha, ha, he, — my <hi>Harry,</hi> what, have you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got me, don't you remember your old Playfellow, your little Friend <hi>Abenamin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi>'s Eyes were now opened, in the Midſt of the Hurry and Agitation of his Soul. At a Glimpſe he took in the whole Oppreſſion of her Beauties; and, caſting himſelf, quick as a Glance of Lightning, at her Feet, he ſeized the Hem of her Robe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and glued it to his Mouth.</p>
            <p>At length, lifting up his Eyes, he cried, Ah, what are all theſe Wonders to me, or my Happineſs, unleſs my <hi>Abenamin</hi> will alſo become my <hi>Abenaidè?</hi> That, replied the Princeſs, is not at my Option, there ſits my Lord and Father at whoſe Diſpoſal I am.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then roſe, and, throwing himſelf at the Feet of his revered Patron, embraced his Legs in Silence, while Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> cried out, Yes, my <hi>Harry,</hi> I underſtand you; nothing ſhall ever be wanting to the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of my Darling, that the Power of his tender Parent and loving Uncle can effect. I can have nothing in Heaven or Earth,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0237300105:316"/>that is not the Property of my <hi>Harry. Harry</hi> kiſſed his Feet and ſprung up.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> then continued, I aver, I am ſtill in a Labyrinth. Did you not ſay, my <hi>Abenaidè,</hi> that you were alſo our <hi>Abena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min?</hi> I did, my Lord, ſays ſhe, but I did not dare to avow myſelf. Ah what a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Struggle did that Reſtriction coſt me! while I panted to catch and to cling to your honoured Feet; while I uſed to look, and gaze upon you, unperceived; while my Heart ſwelled with Affection, and my Eyes with reſtrained Tears, and while I kiſſed, in ſecret, the Book that you read, and the Ground that you trod on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abenaidè</hi> then ſat down, and <hi>Harry,</hi> lightly throwing himſelf on the Ground beſide her, looked beſeechingly around and cried, My Lord, my deareſt Lady, our ſtill precious <hi>Fanny Goodall,</hi> can you vouch, can ye warrant that I am ſafe in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Then, looking up to the Princeſs, and drinking her in; No, he cried, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not engage it, I feel that I ſhall periſh in the very Ecſtaſy of the Expectation of being united to her.</p>
            <p>Juſt then, Mr. <hi>Meekly</hi> came in. He had been long and far away, upon many a bleſſed Tour of doing good through the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0237300105:317"/>Earth. But, as ſoon as he heared of the Arrival of his beloved Patron and young Lord, he rode poſt to embrace them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> ſprung from Love to Friendſhip, and catching him in his Arms, cried, O, my <hi>Meekly,</hi> my deareſt <hi>Meekly,</hi> how ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably you come, to temper, by your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the inſufferable Tranſports of my Soul; behold the Regent of my Heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Queen of all my Wiſhes!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meekly</hi> then fixed his Eyes upon the Princeſs, and ſoon after exclaimed; Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Father! what do I ſee? Can <hi>the Louiſa</hi> be reſuſcitated and new raiſed from the Dead? O then, it muſt be ſo, ſhe muſt be her Deſcendent. No One, ſave my peerleſs Patroneſs, could produce the Likeneſs of my Patroneſs. But how this bleſſing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle was brought about is the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>That is my Queſtion too, my dear <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> if my moſt noble Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would be ſo good as to ſolve it. I will gratify you, Gentlemen, ſaid the Duke, in as few Words as poſſible. Mean while, the Princeſs withdrew.</p>
            <p>On my Embaſſy to the Court of <hi>Morocco,</hi> I had ſeveral private Interviews with the Emperor, before my Credentials were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Public. I had the good Fortune to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0237300105:318"/>be liked by him, ſo that he ſuffer'd no Day to paſs without ſeeing me. His Name was <hi>Abenamin,</hi> he was accounted a great Captain, he exceeded All in his Dominions for Grace of Perſon and Beauty of Aſpect; and that which render'd him ſtill more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular was, that he had given Liberty to all the Ladies of his Seraglio, and, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years, had kept conſtant to the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sultana, ſaid to be the moſt exquiſite Beauty upon Earth.</p>
            <p>As we grew more intimate, in the Exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance of his Affection for his Empreſs, he could not refrain from ſpeaking of her to me, and he promiſed that, before I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, I ſhould ſee and converſe with her; a Grace, he ſaid, never granted to any other Man.</p>
            <p>At length, the Day being appointed for my public Entry, I rode through the City, attended by a ſumptuous Train, and alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Palace, advanced to the Hall of Audience.</p>
            <p>The Emperor was ſeated, with his Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana at his right Hand, upon a Throne of Ivory. As ſoon as I had approached the Preſence, and began to open my Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Empreſs gave a great Shriek, and fell over in a Swoon upon the Boſom of her Huſband.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:0237300105:319"/>
The royal <hi>Abenamin</hi> inſtantly turned pale as Death, tore off her Veil with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Hands to give her Air, and called me to his Aſſiſtance, as it is accounted Profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for any Moor to touch the Perſon of the Empreſs. But, O Heaven, O my Friend! think what was my Aſtoniſhment when, in the pale Face of the Queen, I beheld the loved Features of our darling <hi>Eloiſa!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Court broke up in Confuſion, and her Women came hurrying with Drops and Eſſences. As ſoon as ſhe recover'd, ſhe opened her Eyes upon me, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out her Arms, and catching me to her, ſhe cried. O my Uncle, my deareſt Uncle, am I ſo bleſs'd then as to behold you before I expire.</p>
            <p>The Monarch, in the mean Time, looked upon me with a jealous Eye, and twice put his Hand to the Haft of his Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but checked his riſing Indignation, till he ſhould have the Myſtery of his Queen's Behaviour explained. The Women then raiſed her up and bore her to her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; while the Emperor, turning to me, with no very friendly Aſpect, ordered me to follow him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0237300105:320"/>
When I had attended a conſiderable Time in the Antichamber, He came forth with a ſerene and joyous Countenance, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing me, cried, O my Friend, my dear Kinſman, how tranſported I am to find and acknowledge You for ſuch; the Parent of my Angel becomes a Part of myſelf.</p>
            <p>He then led me by the Hand into the Bedchamber of my <hi>Eloiſa,</hi> where we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed our Careſſes without Reſtraint. But the Monarch, fearing that theſe Emotions would be too much for her, told me that he had ſomething for my private Ear till Dinner; and took me into an adjoining Cloſet.</p>
            <p>There, ſeating, and taking me affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately by the Hand, I will now tell you, my Uncle, ſays he, how I came by this ineſtimable Treaſure of your Niece.</p>
            <p>I had fitted out a royal Ship of my own, not as a Corſair, but rather for Trade in the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> On their Return from the Coaſt of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as they paſt, after a violent Hurricane, within Sight of old <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> my People perceived, at a Diſtance, a Sloop ſtranded on a Shoal of Sand about a League from the Shore. Immediately they ſent out a Boat and took the diſtreſſed
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0237300105:321"/>Company in, conſiſting of my Charmer, two female Companions, and three Servants in Livery, beſide the Boatmen.</p>
            <p>The Intendants of my Ship behaved themſelves with all poſſible Reſpect toward the young Lady and her Attendants, and endeavoured to quiet her Terrors, by aſſuring her that ſhe was free, and that their Prince was a Perſon of too much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Humanity to derive any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from the Diſaſters of the Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
            <p>The Moment that they brought her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, pale, trembling and in Tears; while ſhe dropt on her Knees, and lifted to me her fine Eyes in a petitioning Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the Gates of my Soul opened to the ſweetly affecting Image, and ever after cloſed, of their own accord, upon it.</p>
            <p>Ah, I cried, heavenly Creature, calm, calm your cauſeleſs Fears! I ſwear by our Prophet and the God of our Prophet, that I would rather ſuffer the Gaunch, than put the ſmalleſt Conſtraint on your Perſon or Inclinations. You are free, Madam, you ſhall ever be free, ſave ſo far as I may bind you by my tender Offices and Affections.</p>
            <p>I raiſed her, and ſhe grew ſomething better aſſured; when, bending a Knee in
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0237300105:322"/>my Turn, I kiſſed her Robe and cried, Look not upon me as your Tyrant, look not on me as your Lover; but look upon me as your Friend, the tendereſt and trueſt of Friends, who ſhall ever be ready to ſacrifice his own Happineſs to Your's.</p>
            <p>From that Time I ſtudied every Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, every Diverſion, that might ſerve to diſſipate the timid Shrinkings of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Apprehenſions. While I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted myſelf toward her, with a diſtant though fond Reſpect, not even preſuming to touch her ivory Hand.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, my Soul ſicken'd, and grew cold to all other Women. If you were ever in Love, my dear <hi>D'Aubigny,</hi> you know that it is a chaſte as well as a tender Paſſion. I languiſhed indeed for her, I longed and languiſh'd to Death; but then it was rather for her Heart than her Perſon that I languiſhed.</p>
            <p>One Day, as ſhe heaved a heavy but half ſuppreſs'd Sigh, Ah my Angel, I cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I can have no Joy but Your's, and yet You have Griefs to which you keep your Friend, your <hi>Abenamin</hi> a Stranger. True, my Lord, ſays ſhe, Tears breaking from her, all your Bounties have not been able to ſilence the Calls of Kindred or Claims of Nature within me. Ah, my Parents, my
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0237300105:323"/>dear Parents; I feel more for You, than I feel even for myſelf, in being torn from you.</p>
            <p>The Weight of her Affliction fell, like a Mountain, on my Soul and cruſhed me to her Feet. You would leave me then, <hi>Eloiſa,</hi> you wiſh to leave me, but your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity delays to tell me ſo, for fear of breaking my Heart.—Well, be it ſo—go from me—you know I cannot ſurvive you—but, my Death is of no Conſequence, my <hi>Eloiſa</hi> ſhall be happy.—I will go this Inſtant, I will diſpatch my ſwifteſt Galley to <hi>Languedoc</hi>—I will write Word to your Parents that you are ſafe, that you are beloved, and yet pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, ſince reſpected as a Deity.—I will invite them to come and take Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my Treaſures, my Dominions, my Heart: But—ſhould they reject my Suit, I again ſwear, by <hi>Alla,</hi> to ſend You to them, laden with Wealth, though I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhould drop dead at the Inſtant of your Departure.</p>
            <p>The noble Soul of my <hi>Eloiſa</hi> became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly affected. She caught a Hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both of hers, and bathing it with Tears, cried, O, now indeed you have bound me by Chains infinitely ſtronger than all the Shackles that faſten the Slaves to the Gallies of <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:0237300105:324"/>
I kept firm to my Engagement, and, in a few Weeks, my winged Meſſengers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. But, O the Tidings, the very doleful Tidings for my Beloved! They brought Word that they found no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſave two ancient Domeſtics in the great Hotel, as two Ravens in the Midſt of a lonely Foreſt.</p>
            <p>From theſe they learned, that my <hi>Eloiſa</hi>'s Mother and little Brother were dead, that her Grandmother was dead, her Aunt the Marchioneſs alſo dead, and that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis had retired they knew not whither.</p>
            <p>She wept inceſſantly, and I wept with her.—At length ſhe ſoftly ſaid; You have conquer'd, my Lord, you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd; I am ſubdued by your Weight of Affection! O, that You could but conform to one Article more, that we might be united as one Heart, and one Soul, and one Sentiment for ever!</p>
            <p>It was now, for the firſt Time, that I dared to ſeize her Hand, I cruſhed it to my Lips, and thruſt it into my Soul. What would you enjoin, I cried, I would do any Thing, dare any Thing to be united to my <hi>Eloiſa!</hi> in Life and in Death, Body to Body and Duſt to Duſt, never never to be ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0237300105:325"/>till her Spirit ſhould make the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of my Spirit hereafter.</p>
            <p>Ah, ſhe ſuddenly exclaimed, that, that is the very Thing I ſo eagerly deſire. Let the God of my Heart be the God of your Heart, let the God of my Spirit be the God of your Spirit, ſo ſhall we be united in him, and jointly partake of his Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs through Eternity!</p>
            <p>Ah, I cried, can I forego the divine Precepts of our Prophet? Your Prophet, ſays ſhe, preaches only to the Eye and the Ear, and this is all that he does or can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to: But <hi>Chriſt,</hi> my Prophet, preaches, in the Heart, to the Affections. From him is every good Motion divine or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, He is the unknown God of your Spirit, my Maſter, my <hi>Abenamin,</hi> and you feel his precious Power while you diſavow his Name.</p>
            <p>I was puzzled, I was ſilenced. I bent a Knee in Reverence, kiſſed her Hand, and withdrew.</p>
            <p>I ſent for the Chief of the Chriſtian Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries, throughout the City and Country. I conſulted Each of them in private, but received no Satisfaction from them. They All appeared equally zealous for my Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0237300105:326"/>but attempted it by different and even by oppoſite Arguments.</p>
            <p>Some would have perſuaded me to be Chriſtian, by ſhewing the Abſurdity of every Religion that was not Chriſtian. Others affirmed that my eternal Salvation depended on my Conformity to certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Rules and Penances. While the greateſt Number inveighed againſt the Chriſtians of every other Denomination; and would have thruſt me wholly from Chriſt, if I did not conſent to receive him within their ſtinted Pale.</p>
            <p>I knew not what to do: I was put to a Stand, and quite confuſed by this Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of conflicting Opinions. At length, a Countryman of my own came to me from the Deſart. He had been a great Sinner, but was converted by the Senſe of his Sins, and he was revered and reſorted to by All the Friendleſs and Afflicted.</p>
            <p>I opened my Soul to him, with all its Doubts and Difficulties.—My Friend in CHRIST, ſaid he, with a gentle and ſtill Voice, they have been leading you all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, quite away from the Haven that ſtretches forth its Arms for the Reception of long toiled Mariners, whom Storms have, at length, compelled to ſeek a final Port.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:0237300105:327"/>
The God of your Creation can alone be your Redemption, the God of your Nature can alone be the Salvation of the Nature that he imparted. But, who ſhall convince you of this? Not all the Angels in Heaven, nor all the Doctors upon Earth, till the Chriſt of your Heart ſhall be pleaſed to convince you that you are, as indeed you are (however mighty a Monarch) a poor, frail, erring, vile, and deſpicable Creature; ſubjected to innumerable Lapſes and Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Sickneſs, Paſſions, and Croſſes, Griefs, Agonies and Death. When this is effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually done, the Whole of the Buſineſs is done. You will call for and catch at a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in the Senſibility of your Want of him. When you come thus laden with your Sins to him, he will in no wiſe caſt you out. But he will take you, as <hi>Noah</hi> took the wearied Dove into the Ark. He will take you within the Veil of his own Temple of Reſt, and all Sects, Forms, and Ceremonies will be as the outward Courts, with which you ſhall have no Manner of Commerce or Concern.</p>
            <p>My Heart felt the Weight and the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Conviction. I took him to my Arms and requeſted inſtant Baptiſm. My <hi>Eloiſa</hi> was called, we locked ourſelves in. And I was waſhed by Water and Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, while my kneeling Angel wept a Stream of Delight beſide me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:0237300105:328"/>
It is ſaid that Poſſeſſion cloys. But I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, my dear <hi>D'Aubigny,</hi> that Love never cloys. Every Day, with my <hi>Eloiſa,</hi> ſeemed to triumph, in heart-felt Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, over my firſt bridal Day. But O, what was the Joy, the Exultation of my fond Heart, when ſhe gave me to be the Father of a little Daughter of Paradiſe!</p>
            <p>One Day, while we were toying and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the ſmiling Infant, and throwing her, as ſhe crowed, from the One to the Other. Ah, my Huſband, cries <hi>Eloiſa,</hi> how poor I was lately, no Parents, no Kindred, nothing but my <hi>Abenamin</hi> upon the whole Earth; and now God has been pleaſed to make my Affliction to laugh, and to give this Babe for a further Band, a precious Link of Love between us.</p>
            <p>He was juſt in this Part of his Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the Muſic ſounded to the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. We inſtantly roſe and joined our <hi>Eloiſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Collation was removed. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid I to the Empreſs, have you ever heard of a Relation, of yours, chriſtened by the Name of <hi>Fanny Goodall,</hi> and lately Counteſs of <hi>Maitland?</hi> I have, ſaid ſhe, often heard my fond Father ſpeak of her with filling Eyes. She is in this City, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0237300105:329"/>She is no longer Counteſs of <hi>Mait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> She is now doubly your Relation, your Aunt as well as your Couſin, and goes by the Title of the Marchioneſs <hi>D'Aubigny.</hi> With the good Leave of my Lord here, I will bring her to you directly.</p>
            <p>I went to the Palace appointed for my Reſidence: I there gave my <hi>Fanny</hi> a few Heads of the Story of our <hi>Eloiſa,</hi> and took her haſtily to the Preſence.</p>
            <p>The Ladies looked at Each other, in long and ſilent Admiration. Then, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Arms, and ruſhing together, they continued ſome Minutes locked in mutual Embraces.</p>
            <p>Madam, ſaid the Emperor, ſmiling, I think I ought to be allowed the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties with my Aunt, that your Huſband took with his Niece. Whereon, he wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed and careſſed her with an affectionate Fervour.</p>
            <p>O, exclaimed the royal Fair, how very poor, and how very rich our God can ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly make us! But then, Lord of my Life, to think of parting, of parting with theſe dear Friends again, perhaps never to ſee them more, that's what ſinks and wrings my Heart, in the very Midſt of Exultation!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:0237300105:330"/>
That, my Love, ſaid the Emperor, is the very important Article on which I wiſh to conſult with you and our Friends here, our dear Kindred in Chriſt. But I muſt firſt ſhew them their young Relation, my little Enchantreſs, my priceleſs Pearl, my Eye delighting <hi>Abenaide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He then ſtept forth, and, after a while, led in a gracefully moving Creature, but veiled from the Head to the Waiſt. Throw up your Veil, my Love, ſays he; here are none but your Friends, your very dear Relations, your lovely Aunt and your Uncle, the Marquis and Marchioneſs <hi>D'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She did as ſhe was ordered, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly broke upon my Sight, like a new Glory ariſen upon Mid-day.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Fanny</hi> ſeized upon her, as deſirous of devouring her. And I, in turn, took her to me, with tearfull Eyes, as almoſt perſuaded that I embraced the newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived Perſon of my deareſt Siſter <hi>Louiſa;</hi> ſo perfect was the Reſemblance in every Grace and Feature.</p>
            <p>When we had nearly oppreſſed the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial looking Maid with our inſatiate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes;
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0237300105:331"/>She ſeized our Hands and, kiſſing them, cried, What a bleſſed Day is this, that enriches <hi>Abenaidè</hi> with two Parents more; another precious Father, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lovely Mother, happy, happy <hi>Abe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naidè.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her royal Father then gave a Beck, and ſhe inſtantly vaniſhed; while her Abſence ſeemed to caſt a Shade throughout the Room.</p>
            <p>The Monarch then, deeply muſing and heavily ſighing, began—I am now, my deareſt Friends, Friends beloved above the World and all that it contains, I am now to open to you my inmoſt Heart, and to reveal a Purpoſe whereon I have been ruminating theſe many Months, but could not hit on an Expedient for bringing it to paſs. How opportune has our <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſent you to us on this Occaſion!</p>
            <p>I have but the two Children living; my <hi>Abenaidè,</hi> and a Son, by a former Woman of my Seraglio. His Name is <hi>Abencorrage;</hi> he is a Youth renowned in the Field, but of a proud and impetuous Demeanour. He had long conceived an illicit Paſſion for his young and lovely Siſter. At length the Fire broke forth, and he lately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted her Honour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:0237300105:332"/>
I would inſtantly have put him to death, had I any other Heir to ſucceed to my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. I therefore contented myſelf with baniſhing him my Court and my Preſence, though I am ſenſible that this has not availed for the extinguiſhing his horrid Flame.</p>
            <p>Now, my Friends, ſhould I die, or ſhould this violent Boy break into Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, for he is the Favourite of the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Soldiery, I tremble to think what would become of my bright eyed Dove, within the Talons of ſuch a Vulture.</p>
            <p>This, together with my eager Deſire of quitting a Kingdom of Infidels, and of join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the bleſſed Society and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, has, after ſome Struggles, determined me to abdicate my Throne, as ſoon as I can amaſs and tranſmit a Fund ſufficient for ſupporting my <hi>Eloiſa</hi> and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with becoming Dignity, in her native Country.</p>
            <p>Ah, my Lord, I cried, claſping him paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately in my Arms, regard not your Treaſures, delay not a Moment for that! your <hi>Eloiſa</hi>'s Relations, both by Father and Mother, are poſſeſſed of princely Fortunes, and they will all be freely at the Diſpoſal of your Majeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:0237300105:333"/>
Ah, my <hi>D'Aubigny,</hi> ſaid he, I am not yet ſo duely mortified a Chriſtian as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly to elect a State of Dependance, or willingly to deſcend at once from the King to the Beggar. I have however been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring: I have already converted a large Part of my Effects into Bills and Jewels, of high Value but light Portage, to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, as I think, of about Sixty Million of <hi>French</hi> Money; this I will tranſmit by you, and as ſoon as I ſhall have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed an equal Sum, I will ſtay no longer in <hi>Africa,</hi> I will fly to your Boſoms, my precious Friends.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, this violent and luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Boy gives no Reſt to my Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. It is therefore neceſſary that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my <hi>Abenaidè</hi> to your Truſt. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, I ſay, that I tear away my choiceſt Limb, the deareſt Part of my Vitals! Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me, Chriſt, in the Trial, but it muſt be gone through.</p>
            <p>This, however, muſt be done with all poſſible Privacy. I am perſuaded that my young Villain has his Spies in and about my Palace. I ſhall therefore requeſt my dear Aunt, to diſguiſe my little Girl in Boy's Apparel, and to blacken every Part of her viſible Complexion, that ſhe may paſs unnoticed, as your Page, through the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0237300105:334"/>Midſt of my Attendants. As alſo that it may prove, during the Travels of my Darling, a Preſervative againſt the Luſt of the Eye, and any further Attempt tending to Violation.</p>
            <p>At length the Time approached and preſſed for my Departure, but how to part was the Queſtion. All Attendants were ordered to avoid the Preſence, far away. Our metamorphoſed <hi>Abenaidè</hi> ſtood weeping beſide us, while her Father and Mother cruſhed us, ſucceſſively, to their Boſoms. All was Paſſion, a Guſh of Tears, but not a Word was uttered on any Part.</p>
            <p>O, my <hi>D'Aubigny,</hi> cried the Emperor at length, Friend, Brother of my Heart, can you conceive what I feel at this Inſtant? I regard not the World, nor the Things of the World. Omit ſuch neceſſary Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations as are common to us with Brutes; and All, belonging to the immortal and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Humanity of Man, is Magnetiſm, is Fellowſhip, the Feeling, as of Steel to Adamant, and of Adamant to Steel. There is the Friendſhip, the Endearment, the Love, paſſing Love, and ſurpaſſing all other Enjoyment. If we meet again, my <hi>D'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigny,</hi> I ſhall anticipate my Heaven!</p>
            <p>Again, he embraced his little Angel, and again he embraced his Queen, and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0237300105:335"/>beſought her to be comforted. We then took Leave, as for the laſt; and again they called us back, and embraced and took Leave again; till, ſeeing no End, I ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broke away, hurrying with us our <hi>Abenaidè,</hi> for fear of Obſervation. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, however, to tell You that, the Day before our Departure, the royal <hi>Abenamin</hi> had enjoined me to ſet apart twenty Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Livres, for the Portion of his Child, in caſe ſhe ſhould be married to any great Prince or Potentate, requeſting me, at the ſame Time, not to put any Conſtraint on the Inclinations of his Lamb.</p>
            <p>I have little further to ſay, my Brother. We arrived ſafe at <hi>Paris,</hi> where we receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Letter; and, impatient to make you happy, I diſpatched my <hi>Fanny</hi> with her Train and your <hi>Abenaidè</hi> before me; enjoining them, however, not to reveal our Secret till my Arrival. For, as I had charged myſelf with the Loſs of your <hi>Eloiſa,</hi> I deemed myſelf beſt entitled to make you Reparation in Perſon. But, I ought not to omit that, before I left <hi>Paris,</hi> I received a further Remittance of twenty Million from your Son-in-law, ſo that we may ſpeedily look to have the royal Pair in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after, a Poſt Chaiſe whirled into the Court, and <hi>Harry,</hi> flying out, caught <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Arabella</hi> into his ſtrict Embrace.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0237300105:336"/>He then hurried them in, where Mr. <hi>Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> received and careſſed, and introduced them to the Duke and Dutcheſs, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of great Merit, and his highly valued Friends. He then preſented to them his <hi>Abenaidè,</hi> who accordingly ſaluted <hi>Clement,</hi> and embraced <hi>Arabella</hi> with an affectionate Familiarity.</p>
            <p>O Sir, cried our Hero, kiſſing his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle's Hand, am I to be the laſt Perſon in the World, whom you will honour with a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute from your bewitching Daughter? I aſk your Pardon, my Lord, ſaid Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> (ſolemnly) Allow me then, at length, to repair my Omiſſion by preſenting to your Earlſhip her little Highneſs <hi>Abenaidè.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke and Dutcheſs and <hi>Meekly</hi> laughed. But <hi>Harry</hi> was not a whit the ſlower in laying hold of his Advantage. He kiſſed her Forehead, her Eyes, her Cheeks, and laſtly dwelt upon her Lips, as though he would have infuſed his Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. <hi>Harry, Harry,</hi> cried Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> I will never introduce you to my Girl again, unleſs you promiſe not to kiſs ſo hard and bring ſo much Blood into her Face.</p>
            <p>Juſt then a Footman entered; My Lord, ſays he to <hi>Harry,</hi> here are three Carriages and ſeveral Horſemen waiting
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0237300105:337"/>without the Gate, they enquire for one Maſter <hi>Fenton</hi> who, they ſay, lives with the Earl of <hi>Moreland,</hi> but I aſſured them there was no ſuch Perſon in the Houſe. O Sir, ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> theſe are our old Friends the <hi>Fieldings,</hi> and out he flew.</p>
            <p>As he approached the Carriages, the Company gave a Shout of Joy. Why, Sir, ſaid Mr. <hi>Fielding,</hi> a Servant denied you to us, and ſaid that no One of the Name of <hi>Fenton</hi> lived here. O, ſays <hi>Harry,</hi> don't heed the Puppy, he is but a new Comer.</p>
            <p>He then opened the Doors of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and handed and kiſſed them, in Turns, as they came out, Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Fielding,</hi> the reverend Mr. <hi>Catharines</hi> and his ſainted <hi>Phaebe,</hi> and <hi>Ned</hi> and his bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bride.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> received them at the Door, with the Joy of his Heart apparent in his Countenance. He then introduced them to his moſt noble Brother and Siſter, to his Friend <hi>Meekly,</hi> and laſtly he preſented his <hi>Abenaidè</hi> to them, on whom they all gazed in mute and reverential Aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then obſerving that his Uncle had not equally preſented his Daughter to <hi>Ned.</hi> Sir, ſays he, I apprehend that this is not quite fair; I have already kiſſed the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0237300105:338"/>fair Bride of my Friend, with all my Heart, and it is but honeſt that he ſhould be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with a Salute from Mine, in turn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then took <hi>Ned</hi> by the Hand and preſented him to his Beloved. While <hi>Ned</hi> bent the Knee, and touching her Hand tremblingly, looked awfully to her Face, and ſaid: Yes, Bride of <hi>Eden,</hi> lovely Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of every Beauty! You alone can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, You alone can deſerve him, You alone are fitted to be the Mate of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Lord and Maſter, my Patron and Preſerver! So ſaying, he lightly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Lips to the poliſhed Hand. But the Praiſes of her <hi>Harry</hi> had gone, with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Trickling, to the Heart of <hi>Abenaidè,</hi> and, gently raiſing <hi>Ned,</hi> ſhe affectionately ſaluted him, with a gliſtening Eye.</p>
            <p>Pray Sir, ſaid Mr. <hi>Fielding,</hi> whiſpering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> is the Earl of <hi>Moreland</hi> in Company?—That is he, Sir, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Harry.</hi>—O then, cried <hi>Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> he is titled below his Merits, it was for an Emperor that Nature intended him.</p>
            <p>Dinner was then ſerved.—During the Repaſt the Duke ſaid, Let us not, my Brother, keep our <hi>Harry</hi> in Pain: Why ſhould we delay the Happineſs of Children ſo very dear to us? With Regard to your Child's Marriage to ſome mighty Prince,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0237300105:339"/>as your Son-in-law hinted, I think her more ennobled and more illuſtrious, by her Marriage with our Hero here, who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed her, at his Peril, than if ſhe were mated to the greateſt Potentate on Earth.</p>
            <p>You muſt excuſe me, my noble Brother, ſaid Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> I will have no clandeſtine Doings in this Buſineſs. My Girl ſhall be married in the Face and witneſſing of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; left hereafter, this young Rogue ſhould have the Effrontery to deny her. What Day of the Week is this, <hi>Thurſday,</hi> I think, let <hi>Monday</hi> Sennight be the Day!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> roſe and preſs'd and kiſs'd the Hand of the Duke with Rapture, and then kiſſed the Hand of his Patron in ſilent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>They kept the <hi>Fieldings</hi> with them for three Days. But <hi>Harry</hi> would not part with his <hi>Clement,</hi> nor <hi>Abenaidè</hi> with <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> till the Marriage ſhould be over. <hi>Harry,</hi> in the Preſence of theſe two Friends, attempted to take ſome little accuſtomed Liberties, under her Name of <hi>Abenamin.</hi> But, the Proprietor of his Heart ſweetly repulſed him and cried, No, no, honeſt Friend, I will box with you whenever, and as often as you pleaſe, but, no more wreſtling, my <hi>Harry!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:0237300105:340"/>
In the mean Time, all Preparations were puſhed into Forwardneſs by Mr. <hi>Clinton.</hi> The many Shops of the many Towns, within many Miles around, were emptied of their Boards and Sheeting, their Knives and Forks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thouſands of Tables and Forms were framed, Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Tents were erected. Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made in every Village, and all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, within thirty Miles, invited to the Wedding.</p>
            <p>When the Day approached, one hundred Oxen were ſlain, five hundred Sheep, three hundred Swine, with fifty fat Deer, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> The Spits fried, and the Cauldrons ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the Fires of many a Field.</p>
            <p>At length the auſpicious Morning roſe; and <hi>Harry</hi> and his Bride were already up and dreſſed in their reſpective Apartments. <hi>Harry</hi> wore a Jacket and Drawers of white Satin. His Locks flowed through a Knot of oriental Pearl. And a Mantle of purple Velvet, embroidered with Needle wrought Flowers of Gold, hung over his left Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and came under the right Arm in floating Skirts, joined at the Ends by a Buckle of Carbuncles.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs was habited, after the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Faſhion, in a Veſt of Silver Brocading,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0237300105:341"/>ſcollop'd over a Petticoat of the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric, that flowed in a Train behind. A Scarf of cerulean Tint flew between her right Shoulder and her left Hip, being buttoned at each End by a Roſe of Rubies. Her ſhining Treſſes of jetty Black, bound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at her Neck beneath a huge Amethyſt, fell down in luxuriant Ringlets, and ſhaded and revealed, by Turns, the fine Bend of her tapering Waiſt. A Coronet of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, through which there waved a white Branch of the Feathers of the Eſtrich, was inſerted on the left Decline of her lovely Head. And a Stomacher of ineſtimable Brilliants roſe beneath her dazzling Boſom, and, by a fluctuating Blaze of unremitted Glory, checked and turned the Eye away from too preſumptuous a Gaze.</p>
            <p>Our Hero, coming forth, beheld her, as a Pillar of Fire, juſt iſſuing from her Antichamber. He ſtepped back, as ſhe advanced, and fixed his Eyes upon her in mute Aſtoniſhment; then ſpringing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he fell proſtrate and kiſſed the Hem of her Robeing. Again riſing on one Knee, he lifted his Hands toward Heaven, and his Eyes to her glowing Countenance. Oppreſſive Power of Beauty! he cried, O, may every Day riſe, like this, on my Soul-enrapturing <hi>Abenaidè,</hi> encircling her with Friendſhip, Love, and Joy, and the Knee of admiring Thouſands!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:0237300105:342"/>
               <hi>Arabella</hi> attended her royal Friend, and <hi>Clement</hi> his noble Pupil, juſt as <hi>Longfield</hi> entered to give an Account of his Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But, he had ſcarce begun his Detail, when, catching the Image that had long ſince made an Impreſſion on his Heart, he ſtarted and turned pale, and breaking off he cried, Bleſs me, my Lord, Mrs. <hi>Clement,</hi> I think! Yes, my <hi>Longfield,</hi> ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> and here too is your old and faſt Friend <hi>Hammel Clement. Clement</hi> would not have known <hi>Longfield</hi> in his preſent genteel Plight; but, hearing his Name, and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting him at a Glance, he flew and ſeized upon him with a ſtrenuous Embrace. <hi>Arabella</hi> then advanced to welcome her old Friend; but poor <hi>Longfield</hi> reſpectfully bowed and ſhrunk back.</p>
            <p>You ſhall not eſcape me ſo, my dear Mr. <hi>Longfield,</hi> ſays ſhe; I cannot forget what I owe you, even my Life and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; and I bleſs the Father of Mercies, who has put it in our Power to pay Part of our Debt, and ſo ſaying ſhe embraced him with Freedom and Cordiality. Yes, my dear <hi>Longfield,</hi> cried <hi>Hammel,</hi> your's is the Half of our Fortunes, and more than the Half of our Hearts. Your Heart, Sir, ſaid <hi>Longfield,</hi> will ever be moſt valuable; but as to any Thing additional, the Bounty of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0237300105:343"/>my young Maſter has rendered all further Fortune quite ſuperfluous to me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Longfield</hi> then beckoned his Lord forth, that he might relate to his Eye, rather than to his Ear, the Succeſs of his Commiſſion. They haſtened to a long Barn, where he ſhewed <hi>Harry</hi> two Ranges of beautiful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, One of a hundred choſen Girls, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of a hundred choſen Boys, All dreſſed in a clean and elegant Uniform. <hi>Harry</hi> walked between the Ranks, his Heart ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting in the Senſe of its own divine Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. Then, embracing his Agent, Yes, my <hi>Longfield,</hi> he cried, Theſe ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed my Children; and I will prove a true and affectionate Father to them. But let us haſten to beſtow upon them a tender Mother too, I truſt.</p>
            <p>He flew back, as a Glimpſe of Lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſeizing and half devouring the Hand of his Bride, Will you pardon me, my Beloved, ſays he, ſome Matters that happened before our Union? I have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected all the Children I ever had before Marriage. I ſcorn any Thing that is clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine. They wait for your Inſpection; and I hope that you will not prove a hard Stepmother to them. You are a Rogue, ſays ſhe, archly ſmiling, and giving him a Pat on the Cheek; but come along, and ſo ſaying, away they tripped.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:0237300105:344"/>
The Princeſs walked, with a ſilent and muſing Attention, up and down the Ranges. Her Heart grew ſtrongly affected, and, taking out her Handkerchief, ſhe wiped away the dropping Tear. And has my Lord, ſays ſhe to <hi>Longfield,</hi> has he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed taken upon him to be a Father to all this pretty Hoſt of Little Ones? He has, ſo pleaſe your Highneſs, ſays <hi>Longfield,</hi> and has accordingly cloathed and provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them. O, ſhe cried, under the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, which is in Heaven, he is the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and ſweeteſt Father that ever was upon Earth! So exclaiming, ſhe ſprung at <hi>Harry,</hi> and notwithſtanding her late Coyneſs, ſcarce vouchſafing a Hand to his Lips, ſhe now grappled about his Neck, half ſmothering him with the Repetition of her Kiſſes and Careſſes; and then thruſting her Face into his Boſom, ſhe vented her Paſſion in Tears.</p>
            <p>On their Return, they perceived Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> the Duke and Dutcheſs, all ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the great folding Door, and flying up the marble Steps, they Both bent the Knee, and received the joint Bleſſings and ſucceſſive Careſſes of their three exulting Parents.</p>
            <p>Juſt then <hi>Harry</hi> ſpied Goodman <hi>Dobſon</hi> and his Dame coming diffidently but puff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0237300105:345"/>up the Avenue. Inſtantly he caught his Angel by the Hand and haſtened to meet them. He took them ſucceſſively in his Arms, and kiſſed them with warm Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, while with yearning Hearts and Bowels, they wiſhed him Joy upon Joy. They then kneeled down on each Side of the Princeſs, kiſſing her Hands and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and bleſſing her for beſtowing ſuch a Heaven of Beauty upon their <hi>Harry.</hi> But, as ſoon as <hi>Harry</hi> told her that they were his Foſterers, his very dear Daddy and Mammy; ſhe raiſed and kiſſed them, in turns, with her Arms about their Necks; and beſought them to be her Daddy and Mammy alſo; for, alas, ſays ſhe, my Daddy and Mammy are far away. <hi>Harry</hi> then gave them into the Hands of his Man <hi>Jack,</hi> with Orders to take them to the Larder.</p>
            <p>The Multitude, before this, began to thicken apace. And the Youth had got together in the great Lawn, caſting the Coit and the Sledge, and leaping over a Cord that was raiſed between two Poſts.</p>
            <p>My lovely <hi>Harry,</hi> cried the Duke, I have heard Things, almoſt incredible, of your Proweſs and Action, but never ſaw any Sample ſave the mounting of your <hi>Bucephealus.</hi> Will you be ſo good to give
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0237300105:346"/>me ſome Inſtance of your Excellence among yonder young Competitors, whom I ſuppoſe to be the moſt eminent that the Shire can exhibit? Do, my <hi>Harry,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> claſping and kiſſing him, indulge my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Brother on this our Day of Jubilee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> bowed, and ordered <hi>Jack</hi> to bring him his Quarterſtaff, and diſpatched Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a Cord and two long Poles. He then walked down the Avenue, attended by the Males and Females of the whole Family.</p>
            <p>As they approached the Lawn, a Youth, of uncommon Vigour, had cleared the former Cord, though raiſed to ſomething upward of five Feet in Height, but All, who attempted to follow, either recoiled or pitched over.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> then cauſed his two Poles to be erected to an Elevation of ten Feet, with a Cord reaching from Top to Top. The Multitude came down, in Thouſands, to ſee what they were about. When <hi>Harry,</hi> having cleared the conteſted Cord with a ſtanding Hop, went backward from his lofty Poles, about the Diſtance of thirty Paces; then, ruſhing forward, he advanced one End of his Staff to the Ground, and ſpringing, and raiſing, and riſing upon the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0237300105:347"/>oppoſite End, he pitched himſelf over the elevated String, while the Multitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him, as a new riſen Phenix, ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and glittering in the Air, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting, as winged, on the other Side.</p>
            <p>The Elements were rent by a univerſal Shout, which followed and undulated after our Company, till they ſheltered themſelves within the Houſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fieldings</hi> then arrived, with the reverable Mr. <hi>Catharines,</hi> who was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to join the angelic Pair.</p>
            <p>After Breakfaſt, the Carriages were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered out. Firſt, Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi> and his <hi>Meekly</hi> moved away, in Mr. <hi>Clinton</hi>'s Coach and Six to the Church. The Family of the <hi>Fieldings</hi> then followed, in a Coach and Six, and two Chariots. Next went <hi>Clement</hi> and his <hi>Arabella,</hi> in their Poſt Chaiſe and Four. The Duke and Dutcheſs then ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, in a ſumptuous Coach proudly drawn by Six <hi>German</hi> Greys, attended by a long Retinue of <hi>French</hi> Liveries, and the Dutcheſs's Women in a Coach and Four. Laſt advanced the Princeſs's four faithful <hi>Moors,</hi> mounted on fiery Courſers, and All gliſtering in <hi>Barbaric</hi> Gems and Adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And laſt of all came our Hero and his <hi>Abenaidè,</hi> enthroned in her open Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0237300105:348"/>as two Pearls of the Orient in a Caſe of burniſhed Gold; her ſix ſpotted <hi>Arabians,</hi> reſtraining their Impatience, beat Meaſures with their Feet, ſcarce ſeeming to advance the Pace of a Tortoiſe.
