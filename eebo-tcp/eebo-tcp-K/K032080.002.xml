            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>The adult shells of this species are from three quarters of an inch, to an inch and a quarter in diameter; the colours various, generally brownish or ashen colour, inclining in some to red, in others to yellow; the young shells are whitish and more transparent.</p>
                  <p>It is very common in ponds and rivers. The animal is blackish brown, and has two red capillary horns<note n="*" place="bottom">"This fish emits a fine <hi>scarlet humour,</hi> if a grain of salt of any kind, or a little pepper or ginger, be put into the mouth of the shell. It emits this fine scarlet humour all the year, especially in April and September. Dr. Lister gives a full account of it. He says, this scarlet humour may be readily got, and in great quantity, if a large parcel of these shells be wrapped up in a cloth bag, sprinkling over it a little salt; then the scarlet liquor will ouze plentifully. The colouring part of this humour immediately subsides, if sprinkled with powdered allum, and the rest of it remains like clear water. The colouring part may be strained through a filtering paper, but the elegance of its colour is lost, and it changes into a dull, unpleasant rusty brown. Moreover, if mired with vinegar, spirit of wine, deliquated vegetable salts, or common salt dissolved, this elegant scarlet colour perishes in the same manner as when mixed with allum. Neither can this liquor be kept by itself pure and unmixed; for in vain did the doctor strive to preserve it in narrow mouthed bottles or phials, perfectly well closed, and with oil or honey thrown over it. Thus this colour is of so fugitive a nature, that no acid or astringent has been found sufficient, to preserve the elegance of its tint."
<p>"Dr. Lister further recites some observations and experiments he made on this scarlet fluid, to discover whether it was a humour of the body, or to be got by lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or incision, as blood; a saliva from the throat or stomach; or a particular hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour contained in certain vessels or parts; but the nicety and difficulty of the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rendered it impossible for him to determine it preci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb facs="tcp:0622700302:12"/>This species is found in several countries of Europe. In Great Britain it seems to be a local and rather uncommon kind. Da Costa says "though found in many parts of England, is not met with in any plenty, but is scarce. I have found them on the rocks, at and near Matlock, in Derbyshire, about Bath, in Somersetshire, also on rocks; in Surrey, Wiltshire, and Hampshire, in the moss on the bodies of large trees, and in woods. Dr. Lister found them on the grass in Lincolnshire; Mr. Petiver, in hedges, between Charlton and Woolwich, in Kent<note n="*" place="bottom">Not uncommon last summer in the woods of Kent.</note>; Mr. Morton, in hedge-bottoms, in Oakly Parva, in Northamptonshire; and Mr. Wallis, on the rocks in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland: but they are not common or frequent any where." page 56.</p>

               <p>We are informed by Pennant that this shell was discovered by the Reverend Hugh Davies; that it is a rare and new species, and is sometimes dredged up off Priestholme Island, Anglesea.</p>
               <p>It is about half the size of Mytilus Modiolus, and in some respects resembles it; but is distinguished by the very remarkable and peculiar
<pb facs="tcp:0622700302:15"/>structure of its hinge; the space opposite to it is bent inwards, in a winding manner, into a deep rugged cavity, which when the shells are closed, form a deep hollow, or umbilicus, as if bruised in. On one valve this depression is more deeply inflected inwards than on the other.</p>

               <p>The figure of this shell in the plate of Da Costa above quoted, is so very indifferent and devoid of true character, that were we not in possession of the specimen he represents, it would be difficult to ascertain it. In the general description he says the outside is a little uneven, <hi>but not rugged</hi> nor of <hi>a leaved or flakey structure</hi> as the common Oyster: he adds that the ridges are longitudinal, about the thickness of a thread, very numerous, irregular, and run one into another; but towards the bottom always furcate or divide. This description is accurate but does not accord with the figure, in which the longitudinal ridges appear of a flakey structure or like laminae, and not numerous, irregular threadlike striae as in the shell, We have selected several characteristic specimens of this species in the annexed plate.</p>
               <p>This shell is thick, strong, and nearly opake: it is usually about an inch in diameter; the valves unequal, the under one being very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave, the upper one flattish. Within, it is of a livid green and rather glossy, the hinge broad, deep, somewhat triangular and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated transversely. In many shells there is a remarkable white mark exactly resembling a thick spot of white oil paint, placed a little below the hinge, this spot always appears in radiated wrinkles from the centre, and is formed by the muscle of the shell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0622700302:31"/>It is found on many of our shores, as Kent, Sussex, Dorsetshire, &amp;c. in abundance, and of various colours; some are very fine like japan lacquer, and others of a violet, green, pink, yellow or pearly tint when much worn. It is remarkable, however, that the upper valves are so scarce, that hundreds of the lower valves are found to one of them.</p>

               <p>This shell is found in abundace on many of the English shores, especially the northern and western coasts, and those of Scotland and Ireland.</p>
               <p>The antients esteemed this fish a delicious food, and Dr. Lister informs us he thought it nearly as rich and palatable as the Lobster. In England and Scotland it is at present mostly used for baits, and nor for the table; but in Ireland is much eaten in Lent.—It is in season in spring.</p>
               <p>From the hinge to the opposite margin the length is about half an inch, and its breadth from five to seven inches; but some shells are found much larger. The outside is covered with a thin transparent yellow-brown cuticle or epidermis, like glue, which peels off soon after the fish is dead or exposed to the shores. Under this epidermis the shell is smooth, very glossy, and marked with many concentric transverse wrinkles from the middle to one extreme, the other half is striated lengthways. Inside white and glossy.</p>

               <p>It is an elegant shell, the outside being beautifully marked with numerous delicate striae like strokes of engraving, and tinged with a fine rose or flesh colour.

Mytilus Anatinus is rarely more than half the size of Mytilus Cygneus, is more compressed, and has the cartilage side extended in a straight line to an acute angle at one end.</p>
               <p>The usual length of Mytilus Cygneus is about two or three inches, its breadth five or six inches. The valves deep, or concave. The outside is wrinkled transversely, and varies in colour according to the state of the Shell. The external covering, or epidermis, is thin, but strong, and of a greenish colour; under this the Shell is varied with bright brown, and when the coating is worn off, the whole Shell is pearly. The inside is often rugged with small pearls.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:0622700302:72"/>The Mactra lutraria is so very similar in general appearance to the Mya Arenaria, that without attending to the foliated hinge of the latter, they may be confounded with each other. Both shells are scarce on the British coasts, except in certain situations. Da Costa says the Mactra lutraria is found in plenty at Scarborough, in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, Lancashire, &amp;c. and on the shores of Scotland. Dr. Maton found them on the coast of Cornwall; and we met with them very fine, perfect, and beautifully coloured, on the sands near Laugharn, South Wales.</p>
               <p>The general colour is yellowish, tinged with orange, and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly clouded with brown; and often glossed with a delicate white; the epidermis brown.</p>

Dr. Lister says it is the most elegant of all our snails, and is found near Oglethorpe and Burwell woods in Lincolnshire, in Yorkshire, and in Kent. Petiver found it about Charlton, in Kent; also Morton, in Northamptonshire; Pennant, in the woods of Cambridgeshire; and Da Costa, in Surrey. It is no where common.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:0622700302:90"/>In referring this ambiguous Shell to the Tellina genus, we may incur censure, as it does not certainly possess every characteristic of a tellen, yet we conceive less impropriety in altering the genera than in retaining it as a trigonella.</p>
                  <p>This Shell has been admitted as the Venus borealis of Linnaeus and from the Synonyms of Lister's figure, not without probability. We do not, however, think the Linnaean descriptions agree suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently with our Shell; it may be a variety of it, though we hesitate to admit it as such.</p>
                  <p>Pennant has described this Shell twice, the old Shell is Tellins Crassa, No. 28, and the young one Venus borealis, No. 52 of that author; he adds indeed "the <hi>Tellina crassa</hi> has the habit of Venus borealis, but its sides are unequal, one being more extended than the other."</p>
                  <p>Da Costa has been under similar difficulties, he gives it as a species of his genus trigonella, though he says in the general description, that "the hinge of this kind is of a <hi>different structure from the</hi> TRIGONELLAE, for it consists of two minute, thin, plate-like, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel teeth, aside of which is a large triangular cavity, and has no lateral teeth."</p>

                  <p>The English naturalist is indebted to Dr. William Maton, author of the Tour of the Western Counties, for the discovery of this new and interesting British species. The first account of it appeared in a paper presented by him to the Linnaean Society, and afterwards inserted in their Transactions; and it is to this gentleman also our thanks are due for the specimens figured in the annexed plate. We have seen it since in the Collection of William Pilkington, Esq. Whitehall; who recently found it in the river near Hungerford in Berkshire.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Maton, in his remarks on this species, says, "It does not appear to have been described, and probably was never seen by Linnaeus, nor has it been noticed by any English writer on Conchology; a figure, however, of it occurs in <hi>Gualteri's Index, Testacrum. Conchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorum (Tab.</hi> 7. <hi>fig. C. C.</hi>) but has been referred to by Professor
<pb facs="tcp:0622700302:92"/>Gmelin, in his edition of the Systema Naturae of Linnaeus for <hi>Tellin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> cornea,</hi> though it evidently differs from the latter in shape, which Linnaeus considers as one of the most certain <hi>criteria,</hi> whereby species are to be distinguished. <hi>Gualtieri</hi> mentions the Shells al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to as <hi>"Musculus fluviatilis, striatus, subflavus pellucidus,"</hi> which is a vague and imperfect description, and by no means sufficient to shew in what respect it differs from T. cornea." The difference consists chiefly in the T. rivalis being of a more oblique and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ovated form, and in having the hinge near one end; T. cornea is somewhat globose, and in particular has the hinge and beaks placed in a more central manner.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Maton has generally found Tellina rivalis on chalky parts of the bed of the river Avon, and in rivulets communicating with it near Salisbury; but has never seen it in any considerable abundance. He conceives, that if diligently sought after, it may be discovered in most rivers and streams which are inhabited by <hi>Tellina cornea.</hi>

It appears that the latter species came into the possession of Da Costa after the work was published, for it stands corrected in some MSS. notes in his collection, though it is not noticed in his publication. Gmelin in his Systema Natura admits Da Costa's Shell as the Linnaean Zonaria; Pennant's Shell is not described by either author.</p>
               <p>It inhabits dry sandy soils and banks, and, as Da Costa observes, is common only in some parts, as in the grass on Heddington-heath in Oxfordshire, and in Hampshire in plenty. It is also found in Corn-wall, and was met with by Petiver on Newmarket-heath in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeshire.</p>

               <p>This shell was first described by Pennant in his Zoology; he says it very much resembles the Pholas crispatus but is never found larger than a hazed not. Da Costa describes it also, but doubts whether it
<pb facs="tcp:0622700302:107"/>is a diſtinct species or only a young shell of that kind. As both authors have however figured and described it separately, we have given it a place as a distinct, or at leaſt doubtful species.</p>
               <p>Pennant says he found these shells in masses of fossil wood in the shores of Abergelli in Denbighshire: the bottom of their cells were round and appeared as if nicely turned with some instrument. According to this author they will also perforate the hardest oak plank that is accidentally lodged in the water. Da Costa says they are found in great quantities on the same coasts as the other kind (Pholas crispatus) nitched in the rocks and stones, and adds that there is an amazing abundance at Scarborough and Whitby in Yorkshire, nitched in the Alum and other stones.</p>

               <p>We believe this species is rather an uncommon, or at least local kind on the British shores, though Da Costa says it is found on the coasts of Devonshire, Cornwall, Dorsetshire, Pwlhely in Caernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire, and in plenty on the coasts of Norfolk. The collection of that author contains but a single specimen, it is a worn Shell and indifferently expressed by the figure above quoted. The most cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristic Shells of this species we have seen, we found on the rocky
<pb facs="tcp:0622700302:113"/>shores of Aberſraw, on the western side of Anglesea, and at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachty the remotest part of the same island.</p>
               <p>This Shell is large, thick, and conic or shaped like a trochus. The general colour is ashen with little variation, the lines in some are dark or almost black, in others of a pale brown, or brown tinged with red; when the external covering is worn off the Shell appears of a fine mother of pearl.</p>
               <p>Turbo lineatus is not described by any English Author except Da Costa.</p>

               <p>This is one of the heterostrope Shells, or such as have the mouth placed on the right side instead of the left, as is usual in most spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. In general, heterosphe Shells are mere accidental varieties only of such as turn in the usual manner<note n="*" place="bottom">Reversed shells of the common garden snail have been found, though very rarely. One is mentioned by Dr. Latham in his Synopsis of Birds.</note>; but in the present instance, it constitutes a striking character of the species itself.</p>
               <p>It is a matter of some difficulty to reconcile the various opinions of authors respecting the several varieties and growths of this species; Da Cos'a has entered into the enquiry; and the result of his remarks appear at least satisfactory to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0622700302:117"/>"These smaller ones," says Da Costa, "are the young Shells, but always with them are found old ones of double or treble the size; in every other respect like these, but proportionally larger and stronger in their several parts and work. The plaits or foldings near the mouth are deep and very strong; the striae stronger and more distinct; the border round the mouth greatly turned outwards, very broad, flat, thick, milk white, and the sinuosities, jags or teeth, within, are large, white, and very conspicuous; some are bidentated, and most of these old ones have eleven, and some even twelve spires.</p>
               <p>"From these circumstances, authors run into confusion, by making the different growths different species. The accurate and judicious Lister himself has formed two species, in his tit. 10. and 11. on the difference of the number of the spires and other slight parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. The several figures in Gualtieri are only varieties; and the bidens of Linné, Syst. Nat. p. 1240. No. 649. and of Mr. Pennant, Brit. Zool. No. 117. tab. 81, fig. 117. is apparently no other than an old Shell, for such large and bidentated ones I have not unfrequently found nestled with these common smaller Shells.</p>
               <p>"Though the number of spires in a Shell is a criterion, yet it is not an infallible one, for the number of spires vary in some species, either from the growths or sexes: in such cases the young Shells have always a less number, and the males have their spires less numerous than the females. This very species is, perhaps, as strong an instance of the difference in the number of the spires as can be, for it is found from six to twelve spires, as Linné has also noted in his Fauna Suecica."</p>
               <p>Linnaeus, and Gmelin in his last Systema Naturae, distinguish the
<pb facs="tcp:0622700302:118"/>two species Bidens and Perversus chiefly by the number of teeth. The latter is described with three teeth, the former of course with only two. Fig. 1.1. denotes the natural size. Fig 2. magnified.</p>
