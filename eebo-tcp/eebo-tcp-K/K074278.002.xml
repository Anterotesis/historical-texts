            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Tamerlane invades Hindoſtan.</note>AMIR TIMUR, being informed of
the commotions and civil wars of Hindoſtan, began his expedition into that
country, in the eight hundredth year of the Higerah, and, on the twelfth of
Mohirrim, in the following year, arrived on the banks of the Chule Jallali<note n="*" place="bottom">A river on the frontiers of Hindoſtan.</note>. He
immediately diſpatched Amir Shech Noor ul Dien to diſpoſſeſs Shab ul
Dien Mubarick, who had, in charge, the defence of the frontier diſtricts.
When Shech Noor <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0828000202:7"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</note>ul Dien had arrived
within a few miles of Shab ul Dien Mubarick, he ſummoned him to ſubmit to
Timur. But as the imperial general had previouſly retreated into a ſtrong
hold, on the bank of the river, round which he had drawn a ditch, forming the
place into an iſland, he determined to defend himſelf to the laſt.</p>
               <p>Shech Noor ul Dien, however, found means, upon making his
approaches, to fill up the ditch: but at night he ſuffered a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
loſs, by a violent ſally of the beſieged; whom, in the end, he
repulſed, and forced to take ſhelter within their walls. Amir Timur
himſelf advanced againſt the enemy, with his whole army. Shab ul Dien
intimidated, by the approach of Timur, ſtowed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, in forty boats, his
treaſure and family, and fell down the river, being two days purſued in
vain, by Shech Noor ul Dien, who was detached with a party after him. The
garriſon, after the departure of their leader, immediately ſurrendered.</p>
               <p>Amir Timur proceeded down the river to the conflux of the Jimboo
and Chinab, where there was a ſtrong fort and town, known by the name of
Tulmubini. He ordered a bridge to be laid acroſs, by which his army might
paſs. 
<note place="margin">Tamerlane lays Tulmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bini under
contribution.</note>Having pitched his camp, without the town, he laid it under
a heavy contribution. But whilſt the inhabitants were very buſy in
collecting the ſum demanded, a complaint being made in the camp, of the
ſcarcity of proviſions, orders were iſſued to ſeize grain wherever it
ſhould be found. The ſoldiers, upon this, haſtened to ſearch the town,
but not being content to take proviſions alone, the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
was, that a general plunder enſued.

               <p>To beſiege the citadel would but retard the deſigns of Timur.
He therefore marched, the next day after the maſſacre, to a town called
Shawnawaze, where he found more grain than was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0828000202:8"/>

army. 
<note place="margin">Shawnawaze pillaged.</note>He therefore ordered,
that what could not be carried away ſhould be burnt; having previouſly cut
off Jiſſerit, the brother of Shuha Giker, who had attempted to defend the
place with two thouſand men. Timur marched, on the third day, from
Shawnawaze, and, croſſing the Bea, came into a rich and plentiful
country.</p>
               <p>It may not be improper here to ſay ſomething concerning the
proceedings of Mirza Pier Mahummud, after his having, as has been already
mentioned, taken Moultan. The Solſtitial rains hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtroyed a great

ſituation were the affairs of that prince, when his grandfather, Amir Timur,
entered Hindoſtan, who immediately reinforced Mahummud with a detachment of
thirty thouſand choſen horſe, and ſoon joined him with his whole army.
The prince carried in his mind great animoſity againſt the governor of
Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenize, who had chiefly diſtreſſed him. Amir Timur himſelf, to
chaſtiſe the governor, ſelected ten thouſand horſe, with which he
marched directly towards him. When he reached Adjodin, he was ſhewn the tomb
of Shech Ferid Shuckergunge, the poet, in reſpect to whoſe memory he
ſpared the few inhabitants who remained in the place, the greater part having
fled to Delhi and Battenize.</p>

continued then his march to Battenize, croſſing the river of Adjodin, and
encamping at Chaliſkole, from which place, in one day, he marched fifty
crores to Battenize. Upon his arrival, the people of Debalpoor, and other
adjacent towns, crowded into <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0828000202:9"/>

Raw Chillige, who was governor of the place, ſeeing the enemy ſo few in

battle. The Moguls, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, upon the firſt onſet, drove him back within

advantage, and the degenerate Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doos were, in a few minutes, totally routed,
without making one brave effort for their country, lives, and fortunes. The
conqueror purſued them, with great ſlaughter, to the very gates of Delhi,
near which he fixed his quarters.</p>

capital; the former flying to Guzerat, the latter taking the route of Berren.
Timur, having intelligence of their flight, detached parties after them, one of
which coming up with Sultan Mamood, killed a great number of his retinue, and
took his two infant ſons, Seif ul Dien and Choda Daad, priſoners. Timur
received the ſubmiſſion of all the great men of the city, who crowded to
his camp, and were promiſed protection upon paying great contributions; and,
upon the Friday following, he ordered the Chutba in all the moſques, to be
read in his own name. Upon the ſixteenth of the ſame month he placed guards
at the gates, and appointed the ſcriviners of the city, and magiſtrates, to
regulate the contribution according to the wealth and rank of the inhabitants.
Information was, in the mean time, lodged, that ſeveral omrahs and rich men
had ſhut themſelves up in their houſes, with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, and
refuſed to pay down their ſhare of the ranſom. This obliged Timur Shaw to
ſend troops into the city, to enforce the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the magiſtrates. A
general confuſion, uproar, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, immediately enſued, which could

buſy in his camp, in celebrating a grand feſtival, on account of his

citizens fell upon them, and killed ſome of the Moguls. This circumſtance
being reported to the Mogul king, he ordered a general pillage, and, upon
reſiſtance, a maſſacre to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence. This account carries greater
appearance of truth along with it, both from Timur's general character of
cruelty, and the improbability of his being five days cloſe to the city
without having intelligence of what paſſed within the walls.</p>
               <p>But the race of the Mogul prince take, to this day, great pains to
invalidate this opinion, nor do they want arguments upon their ſide. The
principal one is this, that, in conſequence of a general plunder, the king
would have been deprived of the ranſom, which muſt have been exceedingly
great, and for which he only received the elephants and regalia. Neither have
we any account of his taking any part of the plunder from his army afterwards,

the ſtones of which he had inſcribed the hiſtory of his reign, being
eſteemed a maſter-piece of architecture and taſte, took ſo much the

others put them up in the niches of the apartment.</p>
               <p>Hamid Chan aſked them the reaſon of that extraordinary

their ſeats upon the carpet, one of them began to praiſe the flowers, and
brightneſs of the colours, ſaying, He would be extremely glad to have
ſuch a carpet, to ſend home to his own country, to make caps for his boys.
Hamid Chan laughed, and told him, he would give him velvet or brocade for that
purpoſe. When the plates and boxes of perfumes were laid before them, ſome
began to rub the fineſt otter of roſes all over them, others to drink it,
and others to devour whole feſtoons of flowers, while the beetle ſtood no

vizier were almoſt burſting with laughter.</p>
               <p>The vizier, imagining that this behaviour proceeded from the

pleaſed, and had no ſuſpicion of men given to ſo much mirth. The next
viſit the king paid to Hamid Chan, a greater number of his attendants were
admitted; but as Hamid Chan had ſtill a greater number of his own friends
within the court, it was neceſſary to gain admiſſion for ſome more of
the king's people, who were ſtopped without by the guards. The king having
before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them how to proceed in this caſe, they began loudly to
wrangle with the guard, and threw out bitter invectives againſt the king, for
permitting them to be ſo unworthily treated. They even ſwore that they

aſſurances, a peace was immediately concluded. Mahummud Shaw returned to
Jionpoor, and Sultan Beloli took the rout of Delhi.</p>
               <p>Before the ſultan arrived at the capital, he received a letter
from Shumſh Chatoon, the ſiſter of Cuttub Chan, conjuring him, in the
moſt tender manner, not to ſuffer her brother to remain in captivity. This
prevailed upon Beloli to break up the peace he had juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and to
march towards Jionpoor. Mahummud Shaw met him near Sirſutti. The younger
brother of Mahummud Shaw, Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Chan, fearing his brother's reſentment
for ſome treſpaſs, took this opportunity of marching off, with all his
adherents, to Kinnoge. Sittal Chan, his other brother, ſoon followed him, but
the detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Sultan Beloli had ſent after Haſſen Chan, met
Sittal Chan on the way, and took him priſoner. The ſultan determined to
keep him as a ranſom for Cuttub Chan.</p>

               <p>Much about this time, the mother of Sultan Haſſein, Bibi Raja,
died at Attava, and the Raja of Gualier and Cuttub Chan Lodi, went to conſole
him upon that occaſion. When in diſcourſe, Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tub Chan perceived that
Haſſein Chan was a bitter enemy of Beloli, he began to flatter him after
this manner:—Beloli is one of your dependants, and cannot think of
contending long with you. If I do not put you in poſſeſſion of Delhi,
look on my word as nothing. He then, with much art, got leave to depart from
Haſſein's court, and returned to Delhi, and there he told to Sultan Beloli

ſpears, and Sultan Haſſein marched homeward. 
<note place="margin">Beloli's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy.</note>But Sultan Beloli, in a
perfidious manner, broke the peace, and purſuing Haſſein, attacked him
upon his march, killing a great number, and taking forty omrahs priſoners,
beſides part of his treaſure and equipage. Beloli purſued his victory,
and took ſeveral diſtricts belonging to Sultan Haſſein, ſuch as
Campul, Pattiali, Shumſeabad, Sickite, Marhera, Sittali, and Koli, appointing
agents to manage them under him. But when he had purſued Haſſein as far
as Arumbidger, the latter ſtood his ground, and engaged Beloli. The victory
being dubious, a peace was patched up between them, the village of Doupamou
being ſettled as the boundary between the empires. After this pacification,
Sultan Haſſein proceeded to Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beri, and Sultan Beloli returned to
Delhi.</p>
               <p>Sultan Haſſein could not, however, forget the perfidy of
Beloli. He recruited his army, and ſome time after marched againſt him, and
met him at the village of Sinhar, when an obſtinate battle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, in
which Sultan Haſſein was defeated, and loſt all his treaſure and
baggage; which, together with an addition of reputation, greatly promoted the
affairs of Beloli. Sultan Haſſein having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to Raberi, he was
followed thither by Beloli, and upon ſtanding a ſecond engagement, he was
again totally defeated. After the battle, he retreated towards Gualier; the
raja of Gualier brought him ſome lacks of rupees, elephants, horſes,
camels, and a fine ſet of camp equipage, and accompanied him to Calpie.</p>
               <p>Sultan Beloli went, in the mean time, to Attava, where he

proceeded to Calpie; Sultan Haſſein met him upon the banks of the river,
where they remained for ſome months. But Rai Muluck Chand of Buxar, coming
over to Sultan Beloli, ſhewed him a paſſable ford in the river, by which
he croſſed, and attacking Sultan Haſſein, defeated him, and drove him
to Jionpoor, upon which Sultan Beloli turned off to the left towards Kinnoge.
Sultan Haſſein again met him near that city, but he was once more defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with great ſlaughter. His regalia and equipage were taken, and alſo the
chief lady of his ſeraglio, Bibi Conzah, the daughter of Sultan Alla ul Dien,
who was treated with great reſpect. Sultan Beloli returned, after this
victory, to Delhi.</p>
               <p>Having recruited and regulated his army, he advanced the ſpear
of hoſtility again towards Jionpoor. He conquered that country, and gave it
to Mubarick Chan Lohani, leaving Cuttub Chan Lodi, Chan Jehan, and other
omrahs, at Migouli, to ſecure his conqueſts. He himſelf went to Budaoon,
where he ſoon after heard of Cuttub Chan's death. Chan Jehan, Mubarick Chan,
and other omrahs, though they kept up the appearance of fidelity, were, after
the death of Cuttub, concerning meaſures to throw off the ſultan's
yoke.</p>
               <p>Beloli being apprized of their intentions, marched towards
Jion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poor, and drove away Haſſein, who had made an attempt to recover it,
and placed Barbee Shaw, one of his own ſons, upon the throne of Jionpoor. He
himſelf returned to Calpie, which he took, and gave to his grandſon, Azim
Hamaioon Ben Baizied. He directed then his march to Dolepore, raiſing a
tribute upon the raja of that place, who began to rank himſelf among Beloli's
ſubjects. The ſultan went from thence to a place in the diſtricts of
Rintimpore, which he plundered, and ſoon after returned to Delhi.</p>

               <p>The ſultan, in the month of Shuban, nine hundred and fourteen,
marched from Narvar; but after he had advanced to the river, he began to
conſider that it would be proper to ſurround that fortreſs with another

arriving at Hitgat, ſent a detachment againſt ſome rebels in that

Secunder dying at Agra, his ſon Ibrahim immediately ſucceeded him in the
throne. 
<note place="margin">Proud and arrogant.</note>This prince, contrary
to the manners and policy of his father and grandfather, behaved himſelf with
inſupportable pride and arrogance to his friends and family. One fooliſh
expreſſion of his was, that king's had no relations, but that every body
ſhould be the ſlaves of royalty. The omrahs, who were always before honored
with a ſeat in the preſence, were now conſtrained to ſtand by the
throne, with their hands croſſed before them. They were ſo much
diſguſted with this inſolence, that they privately became his
enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</note>A conſpiracy therefore
was formed, in which it was agreed to leave Ibrahim in poſſeſſion of
Delhi, and a few dependent provinces, <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0828000202:80"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1516. Hig. 922.</note>
                  <note place="margin">The empire divided.</note>and to place the prince Jellal Chan, his
brother, upon the throne of Jionpoor. Jellal Chan marched from Calpie, by the
aid and advice of the diſaffected omrahs, and mounted the throne of Jionpoor.
He appointed Fatte Chan his viſier, who brought over all the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs of
theſe parts to his intereſt.</p>
               <p>Chan Jehan Lohani came at that time from Beri, to congratulate
Sultan Ibrahim upon his acceſſion, and, in a very high ſtrain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to
blame the omrahs for dividing the empire, which, he ſaid, would be attended
with many evil conſequences. 
<note place="margin">Deſigns to reunite it.</note>The omrahs,
ſenſible of the impropriety of their conduct, determined, as Jellal Chan
could not yet be well eſtabliſhed, to call him back, and ſo diveſt him
of his new-aſſumed royalty. They accordingly ſent Hybut Chan, with
deceptious letters, to recal him, ſaying, that there was a ſcheme for him
in agitation, and that it was neceſſary he ſhould ſpeedily come to
ſupport it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The omrahs endeavour in vain to inveigle
Jel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lal from Jion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poor.</note>But Hybut Chan having over-acted his part, by
flattery and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, Jellal Chan ſuſpected a plot againſt
himſelf, and wrote them a genteel excuſe. They, however, not diſcovering
his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, ſent Shah Zadda Mahummud Firmilli, Malleck Iſmaiel
Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wani, Caſi Mudgeid ul Dien Hadjib, and Siſſil Hadjib, to enforce the
requeſt of Hybut Chan; but Jellal took no notice of their ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations
or intrigues.</p>
               <p>Sultan Ibrahim, and his omrahs, finding that theſe baits would
not take with Jellal, iſſued a proclamation, declaring all the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs, who
ſhould join him, traitors to the ſtate; at the ſame time ſending
preſents and envoys to all the principal officers in thoſe parts. Theſe
means had the deſired effect, and the omrahs, on the ſide of Jellal, were
brought over from his intereſt, by degrees.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Jellal has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to arms.</note>The affairs of Jellal Chan
declining in this manner, he ſaw that nothing but a reſolute attempt could
retrieve them. He accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly marching to Calpie, ſecured his family in that
fort; and, collecting all his ſtrength, aſſumed the title of Sultan
Jellal ul Dien, and was determined to try his fortune in the field. He ſent,
at the ſame time, a truſty ambaſſador to Azim Humaioon, who hold
Callinger for Sultan Ibrahim, and had a great army in pay, to beg his
aſſiſtance. 
<note place="margin">Is joined by Azim Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maioon,</note>Azim was
prevailed upon to join him; and a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was formed, firſt to ſettle
the countries about Jionpoor, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to think of affairs of ſtill

Mubarick Chan Lodi, ſuba of Oud, whom they drove to Lucknore.</p>
               <p>Sultan Ibrahim hearing of theſe tranſactions, marched his army
to that quarter, ſending his other brothers, in confinement, to Haſſi,
where he penſioned them for life. 
<note place="margin">who deſerts him.</note>Upon his march towards
Oud, he was informed that Azim Humaioon had deſerted Jellal ul Dien, and was
now upon his way to meet him, which gave him great joy. He ſent ſome omrahs
to eſcort him to his camp, where he was very favorably received. A number of
other omrahs, of thoſe parts, joined Ibrahim; and he diſpatched the
greateſt part of his army, under the command of Azim Humaioon Lodi, againſt
Jellal ul Dien.

marched directly towards Agra; while Azim Humaioon laid ſiege to Calpie.</p>
               <p>Jellal ul Dien had it now in his power either to take

Calpie, and other advantages, without having any powers of treating from the
king.</p>
               <p>Malleck Adam ſent the whole to Ibrahim, and acquainted him of
every particular. But the ſultan having now taken Calpie, and the treaty
being concluded without his authority, he took no notice of it, but marched
againſt Jellal ul Dien, 
<note place="margin">and flies to Gualier. Ibrahim re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to
Agra.</note>who, now deſerted by his army for his puſillanimity, was
obliged to fly to Gualier, and ſolicit the protection of the raja of that
place. Ibrahim came to Agra, where he remained to regulate the affairs of the
government, which, ſince the death of Secunder, had fallen into great
confuſion. Karim Daad Twa was ſent to take charge of Delhi, and Shah Zadda
Mungu to Chunderi.</p>
               <p>About this time, the king, without any apparent reaſon,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a diſguſt at Miah Boah, who was formerly viſier to Secunder,
and put him in chains, conferring at the ſame time great honours upon his
ſon. 
<note place="margin">Sends an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt Gualier.</note>He then
formed a reſolution of reducing Gualier, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Azim Humaioon to march
from Kurrah againſt it, with thirty thouſand horſe, and three hundred
elephants. Seven other omrahs, with armies, were ſent to reinforce Azim.</p>
               <p>Jellal Chan, who had taken refuge in Gualier, being intimidated,
fled to the king of Malava. 
<note place="margin">Gualier be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.</note>The imperial army
arriving before Gualier, inveſted the place, and in a few days Raja Maan
Singh, who was a prince of great valour and capacity, died, and his ſon
Bickermagit ſucceeded him in the rajaſhip. After the ſiege had been
carried on ſome months, the army of Ibrahim at length poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
themſelves of an outwork at the foot of the hill, upon which the ſort,
called Badilgur, ſtood. They found in that place a Brazen Bull, which had
been a long time worſhiped there, and ſent it to Agra; from whence it was
afterwards conveyed to Delhi, and placed at the gate of Bagdat.</p>

ſatisfied with the death of Jellal; he imbrued his hands in the blood of
ſeveral omrahs of great diſtinction.

was ſent to take his government.</p>
               <p>The ſultan having received advices of the reduction of Gualier,
which had been for a hundred years in the hands of the Hindoos, he had
leiſure to turn all his power to ſuppreſs the rebellion at Kurrah. Azim

to go to their jagiers at Lucknore; where, joining the intereſt of Iſlam

ambuſh with five thouſand horſe, and having cut off a number of the
imperial troops, made good his retreat.</p>
               <p>The ſultan was greatly exaſperated againſt Ahmed, upon
receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intelligence of this defeat. He wrote to him not to expect his
favor, if he did not quickly exterminate the rebels; at the ſame time, by way
of precaution, ſending another army to ſupport him.</p>
               <p>The rebels were now about forty thouſand ſtrong in cavalry,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides five hundred elephants, and a great body of infantry. When Ahmed
Chan had received the reinforcement which we have mentioned, and the two armies
came in ſight of each other, Shech Raja Bochari, who was eſteemed the
firſt man for parts in that age, was deſirous of bringing affairs to an
amicable accommodation. 
<note place="margin">They treat about a peace.</note>Overtures being
made, the rebels conſented to diſmiſs their army, upon condition that
Azim Humaioon ſhould be ſet at liberty. Ibrahim would not hearken to
theſe terms. He ſent orders to Diria Chan Lohani, ſuba of Behar, to
Niſir Chan Lohani, and Shech Zadda Mahummud Firmilli, to advance from that
quarter, againſt the rebels. The inſurgents fooliſhly permitted

                  <note place="margin">Ibrahim's tyranny and cruelty.</note>Ibrahim now gave full ſcope
to his hatred and reſentment againſt the omrahs of Secunder, and many of
them were barbarouſly put to death. Azim Humaioon Sirwani, Miah Boah, and
others, who were in confinement, were, at the ſame time,
aſſaſſinated, and fear and terror took poſſeſſion of every
heart. Theſe cruelties and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinations gave riſe to another
rebellion. Diria Chan Lohani, ſuba of Behar, Chan Jehan Lodi, and Miah
Haſſen Firmilli, turned their heads from the yoke of obedience. The
ſultan having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived intelligence of this defection, ſent a private
order to the ſhechs of Chunderi, to take off Miah Haſſen Firmilli, ſuba
of that country, and theſe holy perſons accordingly aſſaſſinated
him in his bed. This freſh inſtance of Ibrahim's baſeneſs and tyranny
ſerved only to create him more enemies.</p>
               <p>Diria Chan, ſuba of Beria, died about this time, and his ſon
of the ſame name, aſſumed the title of Sultan Mahummud, with all the
enſigns of royalty. 
<note place="margin">Another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</note>He was joined by all
the diſcontented omrahs, and found himſelf at the head of a hundred
thouſand horſe, with which he took poſſeſſion of all the countries
as far as Simbol, defeating the ſultan's troops in repeated engagements.</p>
               <p>Ghazi Chan Lodi came about this time with the army from Lahore, by
the ſultan's orders. But having heard of his tyrannies, by the way, he was
apprehenſive of danger to himſelf, and returned to his father, Dowlat Chan,
at Lahore. Dowlat, ſeeing no ſafety but in extremes, revolted from the
ſultan, and ſollicited Baber, who then reigned in Cabul, to come to the
conqueſt of Hindoſtan. The firſt thing, however, that Dowlat did, was to
obtain from Sultan Baber, Alla ul Dien, the brother of Ibrahim, now in the
ſervice of Cabul. Supporting him, as a cover to his meaſures, with his
whole force, he reduced the country as far as Delhi. Alla was joined by the
omrahs of thoſe parts, ſo that his army now conſiſted of upward of
forty thouſand horſe, with which he inveſted Delhi. <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0828000202:86"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1525. Hig. 932.</note>Ibrahim reſolved
to march againſt him, but when he came within ſix crore of Alla ul Dien's
army, he was ſurprized by that prince in the night. A confuſed and
tumultuous fight was maintained to day-light, when Ibrahim found that he was
deſerted by ſome of his omrahs, who had joined Sultan Alla ul Dien. Sultan
Ibrahim ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, in the morning, that the troops of Alla ul Dien were
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, in plundering his camp, rallied a number of his troops, and the
greateſt part of his elephants, returned to the attack, and drove him off the
field, with great ſlaughter. Ibrahim entered Delhi in triumph, and Alla ul
Dien, ſeeing no hopes of reducing it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to Punjaab.</p>
               <p>In the year nine hundred and thirty two, Zehir ul Dien Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hummud
Baber drew his army againſt Ibrahim, as will be hereafter related at large,
overthrew him in the field of Panniput, deprived him of his life and kingdom,
and transferred the empire to the family of Timur. Sultan Ibrahim reigned
twenty years.</p>

Haſſein Birlaſs. The ſecond, on the right towards the center, was
commanded by Chin Timur Sultan, Mirza Mahummud Kokultaſh, and Shaw Munſoor.
The ſecond, to the left towards the center, by Meer Chalifa, Tirdi Beg, and
Mihib Alli Chalifa. Chuſero Kokultaſh, Mahummud Alli Jungjung, and Mirza
Soliman, were appointed to command the light horſe, or herawils, in the
front. Abdul Aziz and Bar Tirrah, in the rear of the right, and Kirrah Keri
Bahadur and Willi Kizil, in the rear of the left. Beſides which, there was a
reſerve in the rear of both lines, that on the right commanded by Malleck
Caſim, and that on the left by Alli Bahadur. The king himſelf took his

the Moguls to the Patans, from their known courage and ſteady order, that the

advanced were repulſed with great bravery, but when they ſought to retreat,
they found themſelves ſurrounded; for the two bodies of reſerve, in the
rear of the Mogul line, had wheeled round their flanks, and meeting in the
center, fell upon the rear of thoſe who had advanced to the charge, by which
means the Afghans were almoſt all cut to pieces. The reſerve having
performed this ſervice, retired to their poſt in the rear, and the Mogul

               <p>Sultan Baber did not fail to make the beſt uſe of his victory.
He immediately after the battle detached Humaioon, and three of his principal
omrahs, to Agra, before they could have time to recover from their
conſternation, or to remove their wealth. He alſo ſent Mahummud Sultan,
and three other omrahs, to Delhi, to take poſſeſſion of that capital,

ſtill extant, and reckoned one of the beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the kind in the
Eaſt.</note>, was certainly ſuperior to that of any former conqueror.
Sultan Mahmood of Ghizni was not only a powerful emperor, but the country was,
at that time, divided into a number of kingdoms, which greatly facilitated his
enterprizes. Shab ul Dien Ghori brought an army of one hundred and twenty
thouſand men with him, when the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0828000202:120"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1526. Hig. 933.</note>was not ſo
powerful. The like may be ſaid of Timur, who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaged Hindoſtan when it was
torn to pieces by civil commotions. But the army of Sultan Baber was but a
handful in proportion to that of Sultan Ibrahim, who poſſeſſed all the
countries between the Sind and Behar, and could bring five hundred thouſand
men to the field; while Baber only poſſeſſed the poor countries of
Cabul, Buduchſhan, and Candahar, the revenues of which were very
inconſiderable.</p>
               <p>To what then can we attribute this extraordinary conqueſt, in a
natural light, but to the great abilities and experience of Baber, the bravery
of his few hardy troops, trained up to war, for their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and
now fired with the hopes of glory and gain? But what contributed moſt to
weigh down the ſcale of conqueſt, was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy of the Patans,
effeminated by luxury and wealth, and dead to all principles of virtue and
honor, which their corrupt factions and civil diſcords had totally effaced;
it being now no ſhame to fly, no infamy to betray, no breach of honor to
murther, and no ſcandal to change parties. When, therefore, the fear of
ſhame and the love of fame were gone, it was no wonder that a herd, without
unanimity, order, or diſcipline, ſhould fall into the hands of a few brave
men. This is the general tendency of wealth in all governments, if the reins
are not held faſt, the laws punctually executed, and the progreſs of
corruption checked both by private and public oeconomy.</p>

not a ſingle dinar for himſelf, but divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it among his omrahs and
troops; the ſhare of the former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to two lacks of rupees each; and
thoſe of others were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to their rank and ſtations. A part was

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His religion.</note>He was of the ſect of the

his great vigor in war, he was much addicted to wine and women, and all the

it will be proper to follow his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy further back into antiquity. The
great Chingez Chan, the ſon of Piſſuka, the ſon of Pirna, had four
ſons of renown, who were all kings, and the fathers of nations. Their names
were Oktai Chaân, Chigittai Chan, Judgi Chan, and Tooli Chan. Though
Oktai Chaân was not the eldeſt ſon, yet he was, by his father,
appointed his ſucceſſor, and ruled in Kirrakerim and Kilwarân,
which were the original territories of Chingez Chan. Oktai Chan died, by

               <p>Chigittai Chan, the ſecond ſon, poſſeſſed the kingdoms
of Maver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulnere, Tarkiſtân, Balich, and Buduchſhan, and became the

Timur, was one of his omrahs, and, at length, captain general of all his

Mahummud HUMAIOON, immediately after the death of Baber, mounted the throne of
his father, in Hindoſtan. He was a great aſtronomer, and took much delight
in judicial aſtrology. He ſitted up ſeven houſes of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and
named them after the ſeven planets. In each he gave public audience,
according to the ruling planet of the day, ordering all the furniture,
paintings, and alſo the dreſſes of thoſe who waited upon him, to bear
ſomething that was an emblem of the tutelar ſtar of the houſe. He even
endeavored to ſuit the people, who came to pay their reſpects, to the
ſuppoſed influence of the planet, which preſided over the time of their

follow long theſe innocent whims. Such only ſuited the days of peace, when

<note place="margin">Deſigns of his brother againſt him.</note>He
ſcarcely had aſcended the throne, when his brother, Mirza Camiran, who was
then in Cabul, formed a deſign of making himſelf maſter of Punjaab. To
conceal his intentions, he gave out, that he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Hindoſtan, to
congratulate Humaioon upon his acceſſion. The king being, however, apprized
of Camiran's views, by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior in thoſe countries through which he
paſſed, and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely unwilling to make war upon his brother,
conſented to let him govern Punjaab, Piſhawir, Lemghan, Cabul, Candahar,
and Biana. This effectually ſtopped the progreſs of Mirza Camiran.

prevailed in the kingdom, while private acts of treachery diſhonored the

which he would by no means permit his ſubjects to ſhare with him. We ought,
perhaps, to aſcribe this vice to the ambition of Shere. Had he been born to
the muſnud, he might have been juſt, as he was valiant and politic in war:
Had he confined his mind to his jagier, he might merit the character of a
virtuous omrah; but his great ſoul made him look up to the throne, and he

appointed readers of the Koran and Imams. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that at every ſerai,
all travellers, without diſtinction of country or religion, ſhould be

returned to his brother for anſwer,

accordingly the four omrahs to Adil Shaw, to aſſure him, in the moſt

               <p>Adil Shaw, upon theſe aſſurances, proceeded to Agra. When he

flattery and diſſimulation. He even proceeded ſo far, as to lay hold of
Adil's hand, to place him upon the throne. Adil Shaw, who was naturally a
timorous and indolent man, rejected this propoſal, knowing how little he had
to truſt from the omrahs, and a deceitful, ambitious brother. Selim Shaw was

                  <note place="margin">Humaioon arrives in Perſia.</note>WE have already ſeen that
Humaioon, having arrived at Kizvi in Iran, diſpatched Byram Chan to the
Perſian monarch at Iſpahan. That omrah accordingly waited upon Shaw
Tamaſp at Nilack Kidar, between Abher and Sultania, and received an anſwer
which teſtified the king's great deſire to have an interview with Humaioon,
The unfortunate ſultan accepted, with joy, of the invitation, and in the
month of Jemmad ul Awil, in the year nine hundred and fifty one, had a
conference with Shaw Tamaſp, the ſon of Shaw Iſmaiel Suffvi, and was
royally entertained.</p>
               <p>The king of Iran, one day, in converſation, aſked Humaioon, By
what means his weak enemy became ſo powerful? Humaioon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, 
<q rend="inline">"By the enmity of my brothers."</q> The Perſian
then told him, 
<q rend="inline">"The political manner of treating brothers is not
ſuch as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from you."</q> And being, at that time, at table, as
ſoon as Shaw Tamaſp was done eating, Byram Mirza, his brother, who attended
him, as a ſervant, came with the baſon and ewer for him to waſh<note n="*" place="bottom">To attend the ſovereign in any menial office about his
perſon, is the greateſt honor that can be conferred upon a ſubject in the
Eaſt.</note>. When this was done, Tamaſp turned to Humaioon, and reſuming
the diſcourſe, ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"In this manner you ought to have treated your
brothers."</q> Humaioon, out of compliment to the king, ſeemed to aſſent
to what he ſaid; which ſo much offended Byram Mirza, the king's brother,
that he never after could forgive him, while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided at court. He took
every opportunity to calumniate Humaioon to the king, and was ever harping in
his ears, how much againſt the intereſt of Perſia it was, that a prince
of the line of Timur ſhould ſit <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0828000202:199"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1544. Hig. 951.</note>upon the throne of
Hindoſtan. This maxim Byram Mirza took care to inculcate upon all who had the
king's confidence. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance greatly retarded the affairs of
Humaioon, and, at length, wrought ſo viſibly upon the king's
diſpoſition, that the unfortunate fugitive began to fear death or
impriſonment.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The king's ſiſter and ſome omrahs favor

ſiſter, and Cuſi Jehan of Kizvi, the high chancellor, in conjunction with
Hakîm Noor ul Dien, one of the king's privy counſellors, taking
compaſſion upon Humaioon's diſtreſſed ſituation, joined their
intereſts to work a reconciliation, and to reinſtate him in the favor of
the king. The wit of Sultanum Begum had a great effect upon this occaſion.
She, one day, produced a ſtanza of verſes to the king, of her own
compoſition, in the name of Humaioon, extolling his devotion and happy turn
of expreſſion in the praiſe of Ali. This greatly pleaſed Tamaſp,
zealous for the ſect of the Shiahs, who differ from the Sinnites, the ſect
whoſe tenets Humaioon followed. The Shiahs hold Ali to be the only
aſſiſtant of Mahommed in his apoſtolic function, but the Sinnites
believe in four, adding Oſman, Omar, and Abubecker to Ali.</p>
               <p>The king, in ſhort, told his ſiſter, That if Humaioon
ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Shiah, and enforce that doctrine in Hindoſtan, he would
aſſiſt him to recover his empire. Sultanum Begum having acquainted
Humaioon of theſe particulars, he was not ſo much wedded to a ſect, as to
loſe a kingdom for an immaterial difference in a point of religion. He
accordingly returned for anſwer, 
<q rend="inline">"That he had always privately favored the opinions
of the Shiahs, which was partly the occaſion of the animoſity
ſubſiſting between him and his brothers."</q>

accordingly was, in a ſhort time, got in readineſs, and Humaioon took leave
of the Perſian king. He told him, that he had long propoſed to take a tour
through Tibrez and Ardebiel, to viſit the tomb of Shech Suffi, and then to

fearing that his wound was mortal, forſook him. But that valiant man, drew
the eye out of the ſocket, with the arrow; and, in that terrible condition,
continued the fight with unequalled reſolution and courage. He encouraged the
few who remained by his ſide, and advanced through a bloody path which his
weapons made; till Kulli Chan Mhiram ſtretched his ſpear to kill the driver
of Himu's elephant: that timorous wretch, to ſave his own life, pointed to

requeſt, by obſerving how formidable the power of his miniſter was become

which he and his family lay to that able man, he could not think of removing
him: to leſſen how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in ſome meaſure, the apprehenſions of Ahmed
Chan, the king wrote Byram that he had of his own accord proceeded to Delhi,
and not at the inſtigation of any perſon, but merely to pay his reſpects
to his mother; that therefore a letter from him to appeaſe the minds of
thoſe who were apprehenſive of his diſpleaſure, would be extremely

of Byram Chan and killed him. Byram, for this offence, commanded that the
keeper of the king's ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants ſhould be put to death, without giving any
notice to the ſultan. Akbar was greatly diſpleaſed with this piece of
cruelty, eſpecially when he found that the poor man was innocent, having
loſt all his command over the outrageous animal. Soon after, continues Abul
Fazil, as Byram Chan was taking his pleaſure in a barge on the river, one of
the elephants, which had been carried down to the water, run furiouſly
againſt the barge, and had almoſt ſunk it, before, by the uncommon
efforts of the rider, he was brought to obedience. The miniſter, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
of a ſuſpicious and unforgiving temper, imagined that theſe were actually
plots laid againſt his life; and he publickly petitioned the king to puniſh
the rider of the elephant. The king, to appeaſe Byram, and to remove all
ſuſpicions, ordered that the elephant-rider ſhould be ſent to him, to
be puniſhed at diſcretion. But Byram, either to make an example to others,
or to gratify his reſentment againſt the innocent man, who might even be
ſaid to have ſaved his life, ordered him alſo to be put to death.</p>
               <p>The king was highly incenſed by theſe two inſtances of
Byram's preſumption and cruelty. His diſpleaſure became viſible to the
court; and there were not wanting many, who made it their buſineſs by
private inſinuations, to encreaſe his reſentment. The king, at length,
came to the reſolution of depriving Byram of the reins of government, which
required ſome delicacy in the preſent ſituation of affairs. Some authors
mention a ſcheme <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0828000202:231"/>

he obtained permiſſion of the king to ſubdue a country called Gurrah or
Kattuck, lying between the provinces of Rintimpore, Malava, Behar and the
Decan. At that time, the kingdom of Gurrah<note n="*" place="bottom">Now part of

Durgautti, famous for her beauty and accompliſhments: her dominions were
about one hundred and fifty crores in length, <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0828000202:250"/>

there were about ſeventy thouſand towns and villages well inhabited; which
had the good fortune never to have fallen under the dominion of foreigners.</p>
               <p>Aſaph Chan, having heard of the riches of this country,
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed the peaceable inhabitants, unaccuſtomed to the ſound of war,
with conſtant depredations; he at length marched againſt them with ſix
thouſand horſe, and about double that number of infantry. The queen, with
fifteen hundred elephants, eight thouſand horſe and ſome foot, prepared
to oppoſe him. Like a bold Heroine ſhe led on her troops to action,
cloathed in armour, with a helmet upon her head, mounted in a howdar, on an
ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, with her bow and quiver lying by her ſide, and a burniſhed lance
in her hand. Though her troops had not been accuſtomed to action, the love of
liberty, and the example of their queen, inſpired every breaſt with a
lion's courage. Their eagerneſs to engage, made them march in diſorder
towards the enemy, which the queen obſerving, commanded them to halt, and
forming her line anew, gave her troops ſtrict orders to march on ſlowly, as
compact as poſſible, and to obſerve the ſignal to engage, when it

for a night attack upon the enemy, before they could recover from their

addreſſed her chiefs, and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited them, one by one, to accompany her
to ſtorm the Mahom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan camp: none of them, however, had the ſpirit to

would of their own accord evacuate the country.</p>
               <p>The Omrahs of Gurrah, ſoon found that they were fatally
fruſtrated in their hopes. Aſaph Chan, to wipe away the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace which
he ſuſtained the day before, and finding what enemy he had to deal with,
advanced in the morning towards the queen, with his artillery; which, in the
preceding action, he had left behind him, on account of the badneſs of the
roads. The queen, upon Aſaph's approach, advanced to a narrow paſs, and
prepared to oppoſe him. The Mogul, ſcouring the paſs with his artillery,
ſoon opened to himſelf a way into the plain beyond it, where the queen's
army were drawn up in order of battle. Raja Bier Shaw, the queen's ſon, a
young prince of great hopes, as ſoon as the Mahommedan army came into the
plain, made a reſolute charge, and exhibited prodigies of valour. He
repulſed the enemy twice, but in the third attack, being wounded, he became
faint with loſs of blood. When he was juſt falling from his horſe, his
mother, who was mounted on an elephant in the front of the battle, obſerved
her ſon ready to expire. She immediately called to ſome of her people to
carry him back to the rear; many of them accordingly crowded around him, ſome
with a friendly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſerve him, but more to have an opportunity to
quit the field. The loſs of the Raja, in ſhort, together with the retreat
of ſo many with his body, ſtruck a pannic into the reſt, ſo that the

heroine, however, ſeemed no ways affected by her deſperate ſituation;
ſhe ſtood her ground with her former fortitude, till ſhe received an
arrow in her eye; ſhe endeavoured to extricate it from the wound, but as
ſhe tugged it, part of the ſteel broke ſhort, and remained behind. In the

out, but nature ſinking under the pain, a dimneſs ſwam before her eyes,
and ſhe began to nod from ſide to ſide of the howdar<note n="*" place="bottom">A wooden tower on the back of the elephant.</note>. She, however,
recovered from her fainting by degrees; and a brave officer of her houſhold,
by name Adhar, who drove her elephant, ſingly repulſed numbers of the enemy
whitherſoever he turned the outragious animal; begged permiſſion, as the
day was now irretrievable, to carry the queen from the field. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the
propoſal with a noble diſdain: 
<q rend="inline">"It is true, ſaid ſhe, we are overcome in war,
but ſhall we ever be vanquiſhed in honor? Shall we, for the ſake of a

been ſo ſolicitous to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire? No: let your gratitude now repay that

               </p>
               <p>Adhar burſt into tears, and begged, that as the elephant was
ſwift of foot, he might be permitted to leave the field, and carry her to a
place of ſafety. In the mean time, the queen, finding that the enemy crowded
faſt around her, and that ſhe muſt be taken priſoner, ſhe, ſuddenly
leaning forward, ſeized the dagger of Adhar, and plunging it into her
boſom, expired. The death of the queen, rendered Aſaph Chan's victory
compleat. Six Hindoo chiefs, upon their elephants, ſtill ſtood firm: and

               <p>Aſaph Chan, a few days after this battle, laid ſiege to
Joragur, where all the treaſures of this noble family had been for ten
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations depoſited. The hopes of gain rendered the Moguls deſperate;
they begun to attack the fort with uncommon reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till the place was
taken. The young Raja, bravely exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what little ſtrength he had left,
loſt his life in defence of his independence and kingdom. The unfortunate

place, they found two women ſtill alive, and untouched by the flames; one of
them was called Camela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willi, the ſiſter of the deceaſed queen, and the
other the daughter of the Raja of Biragur, who had been brought to be
eſpouſed by the young Raja of Gurrah. Theſe two ladies were reſerved by
Aſaph Chan, for the king. The riches of Joragur, in gold, ſilver, jewels
and precious effects were invaluable; of gold alone, there were found, in one
treaſury, one hundred and one cheſts of mhers. When Aſaph Chan had
glutted his avarice and ambition with the blood and treaſure of this brave,
though peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able family, he took up his reſidence in that country. His view
was to maintain his conqueſt agaiſt the king; and he, therefore, did not

taken great advantage of the king's diſtreſs. This determined Akbar,
without remaining long at Agra, to march againſt him. The king having arrived
before the fort of Suiſoob, the governor evacuated the place and retreated to
his maſter Surjun Raja of Rintimpore. Akbar left a garriſon in Suiſoob,
and proceeded to the fort of Kakeran, on the frontiers of Malava. The ſons of

but before they could retreat it blew up, and killed above five hundred of the
Moguls, and about double that number of the enemy who were crouded on the

himſelf in the center to receive him: Raja Alli Chan and Raja Ram Chund being
at the head of a body of Herawils in his front, to begin the attack. The charge
was made with ſuch intrepidity on the ſide of the Moguls, that they broke
through the Herawils of the enemy, and fell upon Joheil Chan. They were however
repulſed by a heavy diſcharge of artillery, ſmall arms and rockets, which
did great execution particularly among the Rajaputs and the troops of Chandez,
who advanced under Raja Alli Chan and Raja Ram Chund. Both thoſe chiefs were
killed, with above three thouſand of their horſe. The center being broke,
the Uſbecks and Moguls on the left wing gave way alſo, and Joheil Chan
remained maſter of the field on that ſide: but Chan Chanan, who had
ſhifted his poſt to the right during the action, had made an impreſſion
there, and was purſuing the enemy, without knowing what had happened on the
left. Night in the mean time coming on, and Joheil Chan equally ignorant of
what had happened on his left, thought he had gained a complete victory: he
however contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as it was now dark, with keeping
poſſeſſion of the field, and permitted his troops to plunder the
baggage. To ſecure their plunder, half of his army deſerted to lodge their
ſpoils in places of ſecurity. Joheil Chan with the remainder ſat in the

this perplexing ſituation, Joheil Chan's troops began to light up fires and
flambeaus where they ſtood, having heard that Chan Chanan was near. The Mogul
General being informed alſo by his ſpies, that the enemy was in his
neighbourhood, he ordered ſome pieces of artillery to be loaded and fired
among them, which threw them into great confuſion. Joheil Chan immediately
ordered all the fires to be extinguiſhed, and ſhifting his ground, ſent
ſcouts all round to collect ſuch of his troops as were diſperſed over
the plain and in the adjacent villages.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Chan Chanan blew his trumpets and beat to arms,
according to his manner, which being heard by ſuch of his troops as were
diſperſed over the field, they haſtened towards him in ſmall
detachments. Several of the Moguls meeting with others of the enemy in the
dark, they fought and formed ſuch a ſcene of horror and confuſion, as is
not eaſy to be deſcribed; while Allah! Allah! reſounded from all ſides,
and every eye was fixed upon the eaſt in expectation of the dawn. When the
day exalted his beams, Joheil Chan was ſeen marching towards the Moguls with
twelve thouſand horſe. Though the army of Chan Chanan did not exceed four
thouſand, he determined once more to diſpute the field, and formed his line
to oppoſe the enemy. The battle now joined with redoubled fury on both
ſides, but Joheil Chan after exhibiting the moſt daring acts of valor,
ſunk at laſt under fatigue and wounds, and fell from his horſe. A body of
his dependants bore him inſtantly off: his army according to cuſtom
followed him, and left Chan Chanar maſter of a bloody field. Chan Chanan in
no condition to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the run-a-ways, returned to Shapoor, to join the

After the ſiege had continued a conſiderable time, the air in the place on

prince endued with many ſhining virtues. His generoſity was great, and his
clemency without bounds: this latter virtue he often carried beyond the bounds
of prudence, and in many inſtances paſt the limits of that juſtice which
he owed to the ſtate; but his daring ſpirit made this noble error ſeem to
proceed from a generous diſpoſition, and not from an effeminate weakneſs
of mind.</p>
               <p>His character as a warrior was rather that of an intrepid
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan, than of a great general: he expoſed his perſon with unpardonable
raſhneſs, and often attempted capital points with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſing that power
which at the time he poſſeſſed.—But fortune and a daring ſoul
ſupplied the place of conduct in Ak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar: he brought about at once by
deſperate means, what calm caution would take much time to accompliſh. This
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſpread the terror of the name of this ſon of true glory
ſo wide, that Hindoſtan, ever ſubject to the convulſions of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
became ſettled and calm in his preſence. He raiſed a wall

               <p>He loved glory to exceſs, and thirſted after a reputation for
perſonal valor: he encouraged learning with the bounty of kings, and
delighted in hiſtory, which is in truth the ſchool of ſovereigns. As his
warm and active diſpoſition prompted him to perform actions worthy of the
divine pen of the poet, ſo he was particularly fond of heroic compoſitions
in verſe.—In ſhort, the faults of Akbar were virtues carried to
extremes; and if he ſometimes did things beneath the dignity of a great king,
he never did any thing unworthy of a good man.</p>

               <p>MAHUMMUD CASIM FERISHTA, the author of the preceding hiſtory,
finiſhes his account of the kings of Delhi with the death of Akbar. The
tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator is ſtill in hopes of being able to procure original and
au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic hiſtories of the empire of Hindoſtan, from that period down to
the preſent times. He, therefore, will not break in <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0828000202:310"/> upon
his deſign of giving, ſome time or other, to the public, a complete
hiſtory of the reigns of the poſterity of Timur in India, by retailing the
very imperfect accounts already publiſhed in Europe.</p>
               <p>But as, to tranſlate from the Perſian language is a taſk
of labor and difficulty, his engaging further, in works of this kind, will
depend entirely upon the reception the public ſhall give to his firſt
attempt in that way. If he ſhall find that he is not capable to acquit
himſelf, in ſome degree, to the ſatisfaction of the world, he will, in
prudence, lay down his pen; and leave that field to men of greater abilities,
who may hereafter turn their thoughts to the ſubject.</p>
               <p>The tranſactions of the court of Delhi, ſince the invaſion
of Nadir Shaw, are very little known in the Weſt. They have not, even in
Aſia, been hitherto committed to writing; and if the preſent confuſions
of the Mogul empire ſhall long continue, it is probable the memory of them
will die with thoſe who were principally concerned in them. This
conſideration has induced the tranſlator of Feriſhta's hiſtory, to
throw together the moſt material events, which happened in the empire,
ſince the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable irruption of the Perſians, in the year 1738. He
derives his authority, for ſome of the facts, from a Perſian manuſcript,
now in his hands, concerning ſix years of the reign of Mahummud Shaw; and as
to the reſt, he principally follows a ſhort ſketch of the affairs of the
empire, given to him in writing, by his intimate friend the Rai Raiân,
ſecretary of ſtate to the preſent mogul.</p>
               <p>To continue the line of connection, between the preceding
hiſtory and the reign of Mahummud Shaw, who ſat upon the throne of Delhi
when the invaſion of Nadir Shaw happened, it may not be improper, juſt to
mention the ſucceſſion of the kings, <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0828000202:311"/> from Akbar to
that period. It is neceſſary to obſerve, that, after conſulting the

increaſed by theſe conqueſts, he remitted none to the Delhi; and, at the
ſame time, to weaken the empire, he encouraged, or at leaſt, permitted the
Mahrattors to make hoſtile incurſions into the interior provinces. Theſe
ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular marauders ravaged the kingdoms of Malava, Narvar, Biana and Ajmere,
in ſuch a manner, that no revenues could be paid by the unfortunate
inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The weak Mahummud, inſtead of checking this inſolence by the
ſword, diſgraced the dignity of the houſe of Timur, by ſubmitting to
become, in a manner, tributary to theſe deſpicable banditti. He agreed to
pay them the Chout, or fourth part of the revenues of thoſe provinces, which
had been ſubject to their <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0828000202:314"/> depredations. From this
puſillanimous conduct of Mahummud, we may date the irretrievable decline of
the Mogul empire. That opinion, which ſupports government in every country,
was now deſtroyed in India; and each petty chieftain began to ſtart into a
prince, as he had nothing to fear from a government which had betrayed ſuch
evident ſymptoms of timidity.</p>
               <p>Chan Dowran Sumſam ul Dowla was, at this time, Amir ul Omrah,
or captain-general of the empire. As the offices of paymaſter-general and
commander in chief of the troops are injudiciouſly joined in one perſon, in
Hindoſtan, Chan Dowran had ſuch an influence in the ſtate, that he
engroſſed to himſelf all the miniſterial power. He left, in ſhort,
nothing but their names in the government to the king and his vizier, Kimmir ul
Dien Chan.</p>
               <p>Chan Dowran was ſly, artful, inſinuating; of an active and
intriguing diſpoſition; in appearance aſſuming no authority, when, at
the ſame time, he directed every thing. He executed, in public, as by the
king's orders, whatever he himſelf had reſolved upon in private. As the
indolent Mahummud was even averſe to the trouble of thinking, the
ſuggeſtions of this artful Omrah, who was full of plauſibility, and
prompt to execute whatever he adviſed, were always grateful to the royal ear.
The captain-general, though perſonally brave, permitted his maſter's
authority to be daily inſulted by deſpicable enemies. He foreſaw that to
take the field, without the king, would probably put an end to his influence
over him; for he knew that the diſpoſition of Mahummud was ſickle and
inconſtant; and apt to be ſwayed to any thing, by every artful perſon
near him.</p>
               <p>Dowran made many unſucceſsful attempts to perſuade
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hummud to accompany him to the field. The diſſolute monarch was not to
be removed from the luxurious indolence of the <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0828000202:315"/> palace. The
Mahrattors, in the mean time, continued their inroads. They ravaged the
province of Guzerat, and raiſed the Chout as far as the Indus. They returned
back from that river, by the way of Ajmere and Biana, and ſpread their
devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the very gates of Agra.</p>
               <p>The captain-general, though much againſt his inclination,
found himſelf obliged to march againſt theſe plunderers. But, inſtead
of chaſtiſing them, he ingloriouſly promiſed to pay them the Chout,
upon condition they ſhould immediately evacuate the provinces.</p>
               <p>The barbarians, gaining courage by this ſubmiſſion, and
truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very little to promiſes extorted by fear, from Dowran,
croſſed the Jumna, near Calpee, with a deſign to plunder the province of
Oud. Sadit Chan, who then poſſeſſed that ſubaſhip, oppoſed them,
between the rivers in the diſtrict of Korah, and gave them a total defeat.
They fled to Feridabad near Delhi, whither they were cloſely purſued by
Sadit, who had, on his way, joined the imperial army under Dowran.</p>
               <p>Before the united armies under Dowran and Sadit came up, the
Mahrattors made an attempt to plunder Delhi. They were oppoſed, without the
walls, by two imperial Omrahs, Haſſen Chan and Amir Chan, the former of
whom was killed in the action. The Mahrattors had now poſſeſſed
themſelves of the ſuburbs, when Kimmir the vizier, coming up with an army,
put them to flight. But notwithſtanding theſe repeated defeats, the
Mahrattors found means to retreat, with a great booty to the Decan.</p>
               <p>The king and his miniſters, finding that the Nizam of the
Decan favored the incurſions of the Mahrattors, deviſed many 
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0828000202:316"/> ſchemes to inveigle him to court, that they might
deprive him either of his life or government. The crafty Nizam, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
into their deſigns, conceived an implacable reſentment againſt Chan
Dowran, who, he knew, was at the bottom of the whole affair. But as the empire,
notwithſtanding its grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imbecillity, was ſtill ſufficiently ſtrong
to reduce the Nizam, had he broke forth in open rebellion, he thought it moſt
prudent to obey the royal command. He, however, previouſly, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
his intereſt at court, by a coalition with many great Omrahs, who were
diſguſted with the inſolence of Dowran.</p>
               <p>Cuttulich Chan, having taken a ſtep ſo neceſſary for his
own ſafety, ſet out for court, leaving his ſon Ghazi ul Dien in the
govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Decan. He arrived at Agra, with a retinue, or rather an army
of 20000 men; and, as he held the office of Vakeel Muttuluch<note n="*" place="bottom">For the nature of this office ſee the preface.</note>, he
expected to command Chan Dowran, and to draw all the reins of government into
his own hands.</p>
               <p>Sadit Chan, Suba of Oud, pluming himſelf upon his ſucceſs
againſt the Mahrattors, aſpired to the miniſterial power. The king
continued to favor Dowran, and to ſupport him againſt the Nizam; for,
however weak Mahummud was, he could not but ſee through that ambitious
governor's deſigns, by his behavior for ſome years back. But, as the Nizam
had, upon the ſpot, a force to protect his perſon, and a ſtrong party at
court; and as his ſon, a man of great parts, commanded all the provinces of
the Decan, the king was aſſured, that to deprive Cuttulich Chan of his
government, would occaſion a revolt, which, in its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, might
prove fatal to the royal houſe of Timur.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Sadit Chan, finding that he could not effect
any thing againſt the united intereſts of the Nizam and vizier, 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0828000202:317"/> who had joined factions, was eaſily brought over to
their party. The terms of this coalition were, that when the Nizam and Vizier
ſhould force themſelves into the management of the affairs of government,
Sadit Chan ſhould be appointed buckſhi<note n="*" place="bottom">Paymaſter-general of the forces.</note>, with the title of Amir
ul omrah, which Dowran at that time poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>The acceſſion of Sadit and his party did not render the
faction of the Nizam and Vizier ſufficiently ſtrong to turn Dowran from his
high employ. He had abſolute poſſeſſion of the royal ear, and the
army, who depended upon him for their pay, remained firm to his intereſt. The
faction of the malcontents was reduced to deſpair; and Nizam ul muluck, to
gratify his reſentment againſt Dowran, concerted, with Sadit, a plan, which
gave the laſt ſtroke to the tottering authority of the crown.</p>
               <p>The famous Nadir Shaw, king of Perſia, was, at this juncture,
in the province of Candahar. The diſaffected Omrahs reſolved to invite him
to Hindoſtan. They foreſaw that a Perſian invaſion would occaſion
confuſions and diſtractions in the empire, which muſt facilitate their
own ſchemes of independence in their reſpective governments; it muſt, at
any rate, ruin Chan Dowran, which was a very capital object to men
poſſeſſed of ſuch inveterate animoſities againſt that
miniſter.</p>
               <p>Whether the Nizam did not even extend his views to the empire
itſelf, admits of ſome doubt. Many ſenſible men in India think that he
did; and affirm, that his opinion was, that Nadir Shaw would depoſe Mahummud;
and, to ſecure his conqueſt, extirpate the family of Timur: he argued with
himſelf, that as it was not probable that the Perſian would fix his
reſidence in Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan, he hoped, for his ſervices, to ſecure to
himſelf the vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royſhip <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0828000202:318"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1738.</note>of that empire; and that
afterwards time and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would point out the line of his future
proceedings.</p>
               <p>Full of theſe ambitious projects, and at the ſame time to
avenge himſelf of his political enemy, the Nizam, in conjunction with Sadit,
wrote to Nadir Shaw. That monarch received their letters at Candahar, and, in
an anſwer to them, pointed out many difficulties which he had to ſurmount
in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed invaſion. He repreſented to them, that it would be
extremely difficult to penetrate even into Cabul and Peſhawir, which
provinces Naſir Chan had governed for twenty years, with great reputation,
and kept in pay a formidable army of Moguls and Afgans: that ſhould he even
force his way through the government of Naſir, there were five great rivers
to croſs in Punjâb, where Zekirriah Chan, ſubadâr of Lahore,
would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly oppoſe him; and that even ſhould he get over thoſe
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, the imperial army ſtill remained to be defeated.</p>
               <p>Nizam ul muluck, and his colleague in treaſon, endeavoured to
remove the king's objections, by aſſuring him, that they would bring over
the governors of the frontier provinces to their faction; and that, as they
themſelves commanded one half of the imperial army, little danger was to be
dreaded from the other. Nadir Shaw began his march from Candahar, with a great
army, 
<note place="margin">March.</note>about the vernal equinox of the
1149 of the Higera. He took the rout of Ghizni, and the governor of that city
came out with preſents, and ſubmitted himſelf and the province to the
king, agreeing to pay the uſual revenues to Perſia. Nadir Shaw continued
his march from Ghizni to Cabul, which city he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inveſted. Shirza
Chan, an omra of ſeventy years of age, was, at this time, governor of Cabul.
Being ſummoned, <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0828000202:319"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1738.</note>he refuſed to ſurrender,
and made the proper diſpoſitions for an obſtinate defence.</p>
               <p>The king of Perſia finding that neither fair promiſes nor
threats could induce Shirza to open the gates of Cabul, aſſaulted the place
for ſix days together. In this deſperate manner, many of the braveſt
ſoldiers, who ſuffer moſt upon theſe occaſions, fell; without making
any impreſſion on the beſieged: upon the ſeventh day, Nadir Shaw found
means to bring over to his party Naſir Chan, governor of the province of
Cabul, the ſon of that Naſir, who was, for twenty years, ſubadâr of
Peſhawir. That traitor, with the provincial army, preſented himſelf at
that gate of the city which was oppoſite to the ſide of the attack, and
ſent a letter to the gallant Shirza. He requeſted immediate admittance to
the place, to prevent his being cut off by the enemy; inſinuating, that his
forces, when joined with the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, would be a match for the Perſians
in the field.</p>
               <p>The unfortunate Shirza, not ſuſpecting the treachery of the
young Omrah, conſented to receive within the walls the women and baggage of
the provincial army; but inſiſted that the troops ſhould encamp before
the gate, till they ſhould conſult together what was beſt to be done upon
this urgent occaſion.</p>
               <p>The women and baggage were accordingly admitted, with a proper
guard, and Shirza, with a few attendants, went out to have an interview with
Naſir. No ſooner was Shirza out of the city, than the king of Perſia
began a general aſſault; while one Abdul Rahim, an officer of the traitor
Naſir, ſeized upon Shirza, and confined him.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0828000202:320"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1738.</note>The two ſons of Shirza,
ignorant of their father's fate, in the mean time defended the gates with great
firmneſs and reſolution; till one of them was killed by that part of
Naſir's army that had been admitted into the city. The remaining brother, in
this deſperate ſituation, knew not which enemy he ought to oppoſe, while
the garriſon, ſtruck with terror and confuſion, deſerted their poſts
upon the wall. Nadir Shaw took advantage of this panick, forced open the gates,
took the place, maſſacred many of the inhabitants, and inhumanly put to
death the gallant Shirza Chan and his ſon.</p>
               <p>The king of Perſia found in the treaſury of Cabul two crores
of roupees, and effects to the value of two crores more: in theſe were
included four thouſand complete ſuits of armour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with gold; four
thouſand of poliſhed ſteel, four thouſand mails for horſes, and a
great quantity of fine tiſſues and dreſſes, depoſited in Cabul by
Shaw Jehan. Nadir Shaw remained at Cabul ſeven months, before he would
attempt to croſs the Indus. He, in the mean time, kept up a correſpondence
with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators in Delhi, and maturely ſettled his plan of
operations. He, at length, put his army in motion, and directed his march to
Piſhawir.</p>
               <p>Naſir Chan, ſubadar of Piſhawir, had wrote, repeatedly, to
the court of Delhi, for ſuccours; but Chan Dowran, in his anſwers, affected
to deſpiſe the king of Perſia; and inſinuated, that it was
impoſſible he could meditate the conqueſt of Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan. He, however,
promiſed, from time to time, that he himſelf would march with the imperial
army, and drive the invader back to Perſia. The diſaffected Omrahs wrote,
at the ſame time, to Naſir, to make the beſt terms he could with Nadir 
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0828000202:321"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1738.</note>Shaw; for that there was
little hopes of his being reinforced with any part of the royal army.</p>
               <p>Naſir Chan, finding himſelf neglected by the court, after a
faint reſiſtance, ſurrendered himſelf priſoner to the king of
Perſia, 
<note place="margin">Novemb. 20.</note>upon the 20th of
Shabân. He was ſoon after taken into favor by that monarch, and
appointed one of his viziers. Nadir Shaw had, by this time, croſſed the
Attock or the Nilâb, one of the moſt conſiderable of the five
branches of the Indus. He iſſued out an order to ravage the country, to
ſpread the terror of his arms far and wide.</p>
               <p>Daily advices of the approach of the Perſians came to Delhi. A
general conſternation among the people, and a diſtraction in the councils
of the government enſued. The king and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, Dowran, were ſo
weak, that either they did not ſuſpect the treachery of the diſaffected
Omrahs, or took no meaſures to prevent their deſigns. New obſtacles were
daily thrown in the way of the military preparations of Dowran, till the Nizam
and his colleagues thought, that the procraſtination which they had
occaſioned, had ſufficiently weakened the imperial cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">December 1.</note>Upon the firſt of Ramzan,
the Vizier, the Nizam ul muluck, and Dowran, incamped without the city, with a
great train of artillery, and began to levy forces. Nadir Shaw, during theſe
tranſactions, croſſed the Bea, and on the firſt of Shawal appeared
before Lahore. Zekeriah Chan, governor of the city and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, who was
incamped with 5000 horſe before the walls, retreated into the city. He, the
next day, marched out and attacked the Perſians.

Nadir Shaw, with a nazir of half a lack of roupees, was politely received by
that monarch, and Lahore was preſerved from being plundered.</p>
               <p>The king of Perſia continued his march towards Delhi, and, 
<note place="margin">February 14.</note>upon the 14th of Zicada,
appeared in ſight of the imperial army. Mahummud Shaw was incamped upon the
plains of Karnal; ſo that only the canal, which ſupplied Delhi with water,
divided the armies. The Moguls had only poſſeſſed themſelves of that
ground about two days before the arrival of Nadir Shaw, and had thrown up
entrenchments and redoubts before them, mounted with five hundred pieces of
artillery. The army, which the king now commanded in perſon, conſiſted of
150,000 horſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of irregular infantry. This unweildy body of
militia was compoſed of all ſorts of people, collected indiſcriminately
in the provinces, by the Omrahs, who thought that a ſufficient number of men
and horſes was all that was neceſſary to form a good army. Subordination
was a thing unknown in the Mogul camp: the private ſoldier, as well as the
Omrah, acted only by the impulſe of his own mind.</p>
               <p>The Perſians, though not ſo numerous as the Moguls, were
under ſome degree of regulation. The rank of Nadir Shaw's officers was
determined; and his own commands were inſtantly and implicitly obeyed. Severe
to exceſs, he pardoned no neglect or diſobedience in his Omrahs. He has
even been known to ſend an eſſawil<note n="*" place="bottom">A
mace-bearer.</note> to a general, at the head of 5000 horſe; with orders to
make him halt and receive corporal puniſhment, for a miſdemeanor, in the
front of his own men. Though this rigor may be thought in Europe too tyrannical
and repugnant to a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary ſpirit; yet, in a country where the principles
of honor are <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0828000202:323"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1739.</note>little known, fear is the
ſtrongeſt motive to a ſtrict performance of duty.</p>
               <p>Sadit Chan, 
<note place="margin">February 14.</note>upon the 14th of Zicada,
having out-marched his baggage, joined the imperial army. Juſt as he was
receiving an honorary dreſs from Mahummud Shaw, advice came that the Herawils
of Nadir Shaw had attacked his baggage. Sadit Chan requeſted of the king to
be permitted to march out againſt the Herawils. The whole of this attack was
a plan concerted between Nadir Shaw and the traitor, in order to draw the
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guls from their entrenchments. The king, however, laid his commands upon
Sadit to wait until the next morning, when, 
<q rend="inline">"by the favor of God,"</q> he intended to march
out, with his whole army, to give the Perſians battle.</p>
               <p>But ſo little did Sadit regard Mahummud's orders, that, as
ſoon as he had quitted the preſence, he iſſued out with 10000 horſe,
which he had brought from his government, and attacked the enemy. A mock
engagement now commenced, between Sadit and a part of the Perſian army; who
were ordered to retreat before him. He ſent repeated meſſages, from the
field to the king, requeſting more troops, and that he would drive the enemy
back to Perſia.</p>
               <p>Mahummud, juſtly incenſed at the diſobedience of Sadit,
would not, for ſome time, permit any ſuccours to be ſent to him. Chan
Dowran, at length, prevailed with the king to permit him, with 15000 men, to
ſupport Sadit. When Chan Dowran came up to the field, Sadit, in a feigned
attack, joined the Perſians, and permitted himſelf to be taken priſoner.
His deſign was to get the ſtart of his partner in treaſon, Nizam ul

engagement. Chan Dowran was immediately attacked on all ſides, by the bulk of
the Perſian army. He, however, for ſome time, maintained his ground with
great firmneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; and was at length unwillingly drawn from
the field, though he had received a wound which ſoon after proved mortal, by
three repeated meſſages from the king, commanding his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
attendance.</p>
               <p>Mahummud Shaw was, with good reaſon, apprehenſive that Nizam
ul muluck, who was then in the camp, was preparing to ſeize him, which made
him ſo anxious for the preſence of Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran. When the wounded general
appeared before the king, he told him the ſituation of affairs, and
earneſtly intreated him to permit him to return to the field, with the troops
which were under his immediate command, as captain-general, conſiſting of
36000 men, together with two hundred pieces of cannon. 
<q rend="inline">"Grant my requeſt," ſaid he, "and you

               </p>
               <p>The king was now perplexed beyond meaſure. He dreaded the
deſigns of the Nizam, ſhould Dowran be abſent, and, at the ſame time,
he durſt not permit the traitor to march out of the lines, for fear he
ſhould join the Perſians. He, therefore, fell into the common error of weak
minds, and heſitated, in hopes that delay would give birth to a more
favorable concurrence of events.—He was deceived: the happy moment, for
the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of himſelf and the empire, was now upon the wing. His
troops maintained ſtill their ground, under Muzziffer, the gallant brother of
Dowran; and a reinforcement would turn the ſcale of victory in their
favor.</p>

field, the command of thoſe Moguls, who were engaged, devolved upon his
brother Muzziffer. That brave Omrah made a violent charge upon the Perſian
army, and penetrated to the very door of Nadir Shaw's tent. There, for want of
being ſupported from the camp, Muzziffer, Aſſil Ali Chan, Dowran's ſon,
Raja Gugermull, Meer Mullu, Eadgar Chan, and twenty-ſeven officers of
diſtinction, covered one ſmall ſpot of ground with their bodies. Ten
thouſand common Mogul ſoldiers were ſlain in this deſperate action;
which had almoſt proved fatal to Nadir Shaw, for his whole army were upon the

pleaſure, ſet a treaty on foot with Nadir Shaw, for the immediate return of
that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch into Perſia. So little hopes had the Perſian, at this time,
of conquering the Mogul empire, that he actually agreed for the pitiful ſum
of fifty lacks of roupees to evacuate Hindoſtan.</p>
               <p>Sadit Chan, who, we have already obſerved, was in the
Perſian camp, hearing of theſe tranſactions, uſed all poſſible
means to break off the treaty. The regard of Nadir Shaw to his plighted faith,
was not proof againſt the lucrative offers of Sadit. That Omrah promiſed to
pay to the Perſian two crores of roupees out of his own private fortune, upon
condition he ſhould reduce the Nizam, and place himſelf at the head of the
adminiſtration.—In the mean time, the Nizam, who was now appointed Amir
ul omrah, by Mahummud, finding that Nadir Shaw broke the treaty, began to talk
in a high ſtrain, and to make preparations for coming to action with the
Perſians, to which the king ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly urged him. But the active
ſpirit of Nadir Shaw was not idle during theſe tranſactions. He
poſſeſſed himſelf of ſeveral ſtrong poſts, round the Indian
camp, and totally cut off their ſupplies of proviſions. The Nizam
perceiving that he muſt act with great diſadvantage, if he ſhould march
out of his lines and attack the Perſians, began to renew the treaty, and
offered more than Sadit had done to Nadir Shaw.</p>

communication, were making ſeparate bargains, about himſelf and his empire,
and that he even had not the ſhadow of authority in his own camp, took a
ſudden reſolution to throw himſelf upon the clemency of Nadir Shaw. 
<q rend="inline">"A declared ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my," ſaid he to the few
friends who ſtill adhered to him, "is by no means to be dreaded ſo much as
ſecret foes, under the ſpecious character of friends."</q> Having,
therefore, previouſly acquainted the Perſian of his intentions, he ſet
out in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 20th, in his travelling throne, with a ſmall
retinue, for Nadir Shaw's camp.</p>
               <p>The king of Perſia, upon the Mogul's approach, ſent his
ſon, Niſir Alla Mirza, to conduct him to the royal tent. Nadir Shaw
advanced a few ſteps from his Muſnid, and embraced Mahum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud, and,
ſitting down, placed him upon his left hand. The ſubſtance of their
converſation has been already given to the public by Fraſer: and,
therefore, we ſhall only obſerve here, that Nadir Shaw ſeverely
reprimanded Mahummud, for his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimous behaviour, in paying the Chout
to the Mahrattors, and for ſuffering himſelf to be inveſted in his camp,
in the very center of his dominions, without making one ſingle effort to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the invaſion.</p>
               <p>Nadir Shaw, after this converſation, retired to another tent,
called to him his vizier, and conſulted with him what was beſt to be done
with Mahummud, in this critical ſituation. The vizier told him, that,
ſhould he confine the king, the Nizam, who commanded the army, would
immediately act for himſelf; and, as he was an able officer, they might meet
with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in reducing him. But that, ſhould the king be
permitted to return to the camp with aſſurances of friendſhip and

that would, at leaſt, be a ballance againſt the influence of the Nizam.</p>
               <p>Nadir Shaw ſaw the propriety of what his vizier adviſed. He
immediately returned to the royal tent, and told Mahummud, that, as hitherto
the imperial houſe of Timur had not injured the Perſians, it was far from
his intentions to deprive Mahum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud Shaw of his kingdom. 
<q rend="inline">"But," ſaid he, with a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined look, "the

                  <note place="margin">February 24.</note>The emperor made little
reply to Nadir Shaw's diſcourſe. He was, however, permitted to return to
his camp, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian began to lay ſchemes to ſeize the Nizam. One
Caſim Beg was employed in this affair. He, in Nadir Shaw's name, made the
Nizam many proteſtations of friendſhip, and obtained a promiſe, that he
would viſit that monarch in his camp. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, upon the 24th, ſet
out, and was, immediately upon his arrival in the Perſian lines, ſeized,
and, together with ſome great Omrahs who attended him, confined.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">February 26.</note>Mahummud Shaw, looking
upon the Nizam's confinement as a plan laid by the traitor himſelf, in order
that he might negotiate matters with the Perſian with more ſecurity,
determined to pay a ſecond viſit to Nadir Shaw.—That monarch had, by
this time, ſecured moſt of the Mogul omrahs, one after another, and when
Mahummud, upon the 26th, arrived in the camp, a tent was pitched for him near
the royal pavilion. The unfortunate Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hummud was carried into his tent, and
left for ſome time alone. A collation was brought him, and he ate very
heartily; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out betraying any ſymptoms of being affected with his unhappy

                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1739.</note>ſituation. Nadir Shaw was
greatly aſtoniſhed when he heard of Mahummud's behavior, and exclaimed: 
<q rend="inline">"What kind of man muſt this be, who can, with
ſo much indifference, give his freedom and empire to the wind? But we are
told, by the wiſe, that greatneſs of mind conſiſts in two extremes: to
ſuffer patiently, or to act boldly; to deſpiſe the world, or to exert all
the powers of the mind to command it. This man has choſen the former: but the
latter was the choice of Nadir Shaw."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Though Mahummud was hindered from returning to his own camp, he
was permitted to have all his domeſtics about him, who amounted to three
thouſand. A thouſand Kiſſelbaſh horſe mounted guard upon him: but
this pretended honor, which was conferred upon him, was a certain badge of his
forlorn condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the mean time, Kummir ul dien, the vizier, Surbullind
Chan, Nizam ul muluck, and all the principal Mogul omrahs, were kept in the
ſame kind of honorable confinement. The Perſian had now nothing to fear
from an army without officers. He entered the camp, ſeized upon the ordnance,
the military cheſt, the jewel-office, the wardrobe and armory.—He
ordered three months pay to be immediately advanced to his troops, and the
beſt of the artillery he ſent off to Cabul.</p>

Nadir Shaw moved from Karnâl towards Delhi. The emperor, guarded by ten

the Perſians, the front of whoſe column was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced two miles beyond the

finding himſelf in poſſeſſion of Delhi, called Nizam ul muluck and
Sadit Chan into his preſence, and addreſſed them in the following
extraordinary manner; 
<q rend="inline">"Are not you both moſt ungrateful villains to
your king and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; who, after poſſeſſing ſuch wealth and
dignities, called me, from my own dominions, to ruin them and yourſelves? But
I will ſcourge you all with my wrath, which is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the
vengeance of God."</q> Having ſpoke theſe words, he ſpit upon their
beards, and turned them, with every mark of indignity, from his preſence.</p>
               <p>After the traitors were thruſt out into the court of the
palace, the Nizam addreſſed himſelf to Sadit Chan, and ſwore, by the
holy prophet, that he would not ſurvive this indignity. Sadit Chan applauded
his reſolution, and ſwore he would ſwallow poiſon upon his return home;
the Nizam did the ſame; and both determined in appearance upon death, retired
to their reſpective houſes.</p>
               <p>Sadit Chan, in the mean time, ſent a truſty ſpy to bring
him intelligence when the Nizam ſhould take his draught. The Nizam, being
come home, appeared in the deepeſt affliction: but having privately intimated
his plot to a ſervant, he ordered him to bring him the poiſon. The
ſervant acted his part well. He brought him an innocent draught, with great
reluctance. The Nizam, after ſome heſitation, and having formally ſaid
his prayers, drank it off in the preſence of Sadit's ſpy, and ſoon after
pretended to fall down dead.</p>
               <p>The ſpy haſtened back to his maſter, and told him that the
Nizam had juſt expired. Sadit, aſhamed of being outdone in a point of honor
by his fellow in iniquity, ſwallowed a draught of <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0828000202:331"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1739.</note>real poiſon, and became
the juſt inſtrument of puniſhment to his own villainy. The Nizam was not
aſhamed to live, though none had greater reaſon. He even prided in that
wicked trick, by which he had rid himſelf of his rival, and afterwards
actually enjoyed the intended fruits of all his villainies.</p>
               <p>The Perſian, in the mean time, placed guards upon the gates of
Delhi, with orders to permit no perſon whatever to paſs in or out without
his ſpecial licence. Theſe ſtrict injunctions were given to prevent the
inhabitants from evacuating the place, and from carrying away their wealth. He,
at the ſame time, iſſued his commands, that no perſon whatſoever
ſhould be moleſted; but he demanded twenty-five crores, as a contribution
for ſparing the city.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the magiſtrates were contriving ways and means to
raiſe this enormous ſum, by laying a tax in proportion to their wealth on
individuals, famine began to rage in the city, as all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the
country was cut off. 
<note place="margin">March 10.</note>Upon the 10th Nadir Shaw
ordered the granaries to be opened, and ſold rice at a certain price. This
occaſioned a prodigious mob in all the public Bazars, particularly in the
Shawgunge, or royal market. A Perſian kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelbaſh in this market,
ſeeing a man ſelling pigeons, ſeized by force upon his baſket. The
fellow, to whom the pigeons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, made a hideous outcry, and proclaimed
aloud, That Nadir Shaw had ordered a general pillage.</p>
               <p>The mob immediately fell upon the Kiſſelbaſh, who was
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by ſome of his own countrymen. A great tumult aroſe, and ſome
perſons, bent upon more miſchief, cried aloud, That Nadir Shaw was dead;
and that now was the time to drive the Perſians out of the city. The
citizens, who in general carried <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0828000202:332"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1739.</note>arms, drew their ſwords,
and began to cut to pieces the Perſians, wherever they could be found. The
report of the death of Nadir Shaw flew, like lightning, through every ſtreet
in Delhi; and all places were filled with tumult, confuſion, and death. It
was now dark, and the Perſians, who had been ſtraggling through the city,
returned to the citadel, except two thouſand who were killed by the mob.</p>
               <p>About twelve o'clock at night, the king of Perſia was informed
of theſe tranſactions. He immediately ordered what men he had with him
under arms, and, putting himſelf at their head, marched out as far as the
Muſgid of Roſhin ul Dowlat. He thought it prudent to halt there till
day-light ſhould appear. He, in the mean time, ſent for the Nizam,
Sirbillind Chan, and Kimmir ul dien, and threatened to put them to inſtant
death, charging them with fomenting theſe tumults. They ſwore upon the
Coran, that they were innocent, and he pardoned them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">March 11.</note>When day began to appear, a
perſon from a neighbouring ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race ſired upon Nadir Shaw, and killed an
officer by his ſide. The king was ſo enraged, that, though the tumult had,
by this time, totally ſubſided, he ordered the officers of the cavalry to
lead their ſquadrons through the ſtreets, and ſome muſqueteers to
ſcour the terraces, and to commence a general maſſacre among the
unfortunate inhabitants. This order was executed with ſo much rigor, that,
before two o'clock in the afternoon, above 100,000, without diſtinction of
age, ſex, or condition, lay dead in their blood, though not above one third
part of the city was viſited by the ſword. Such was the panic, terror and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of theſe poor wretches, that inſtead of bravely oppoſing
death, the men threw down their arms, and, with their wives and children,
ſubmitted themſelves like ſheep to the ſlaughter. <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0828000202:333"/>

                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1739.</note>One Perſian ſoldier
often butchered a whole family, without meetings with any reſiſtance. The
Hindoos, according to their barbarous cuſtom, ſhut up their wives and
daughters, and ſet fire to their apartments, and then threw themſelves into
the flames. Thouſands plunged headlong into wells and were drowned; death was
ſeen in every horrid ſhape; and, at laſt, ſeemed rather to be ſought
after than avoided.</p>
               <p>The king of Perſia ſat, during this dreadful ſcene, in the
Muſgid of Roſhin ul Dowlat. None but his ſlaves durſt come near him,
for his countenance was dark and terrible. At length, the unfortunate emperor,
attended by a number of his chief Omrahs, ventured to approach him with
downcaſt eyes. The Omrahs, who preceded Mahummud Shaw, bowed down their
foreheads to the ground. Nadir Shaw ſternly aſked them what they wanted?
They cried out, with one voice, 
<q rend="inline">"Spare the city."</q> Mahummud ſaid not a
word, but the tears flowed faſt from his eyes. The tyrant ſheathed his
ſword, and ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"For the ſake of Mirza Mahummud, I
forgive."</q>
               </p>
               <p>No ſooner had he pronounced theſe words than, according to
our author, the maſſacre was ſtopt; and ſo inſtantaneous was the
effect of his orders, that in a few minutes every thing was calm in the city.
He then retired into the citadel, and inquired into the original cauſe of the
tumult. Seid Neaz Chan, the ſuperintendant of the royal market, for having
been active in this affair, was put to death. Kiſrah Chan, a brave Omrah, for
having defended his houſe againſt the Perſians who came to maſſacre
his family, but who had not been concerned in the tumult, was beheaded.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0828000202:334"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1739.</note>The tyrant's thirſt for
blood was not yet ſatisfied. He ſent detachments daily to plunder the
villages near Delhi, and to put all the inhabitants to the ſword. Six
thouſand of the inhabitants of Mogulpurra were cut off for a very trivial
offence. He ſent a party into the royal market, where the tumult firſt
aroſe, and ordered ſeven hundred perſons to be ſeized
indiſcriminately, and to cut off their noſes and ears.</p>
               <p>When now all diſturbances were quelled by the blood of the
unfortunate Delhians, the king of Perſia had leiſure to pillage the city at
pleaſure. He ſeized upon the public treaſure and the regalia of Mahummud
Shaw. In the treaſury ſeveral vaults were diſcovered, in which much
wealth lay concealed, as well as many valuable effects. In the public
treaſury was found in ſpecie, three crores of roupees: in the private
vaults near two crores more. The Jewaer Channa<note n="*" place="bottom">The
jewel-office.</note> was eſtimated at twenty-five crores, including the Tucht
Taoos, which alone coſt ten. The royal wardrobe and armory were valued at
five crores. Six crores were raiſed in ſpecie, by way of contribution, upon
the city, and about eight crores in jewels; all which, together with horſes,
camels and elephants, amount to about fifty crores, or ſixty-two millions
five hundred thouſand pounds of our money.</p>
               <p>Great cruelties were exerciſed in levying the contributions
upon the city. Under an arbitrary government, like that of India, individuals
find it neceſſary to conceal their wealth. Some Omrahs, therefore, who had
very little were taxed very high, whilſt others who were rich came off with a
moderate ſum. Many of the former, under the ſuppoſition, that they
actually poſſeſſed more wealth, were, after they had given all they
were <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0828000202:335"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1739.</note>worth in the world, tortured
to death; whilſt others, to avoid pain, ſhame and poverty, put, with their
own hands, an end to their miſerable exiſtence.</p>
               <p>Upon the 21ſt of Mohirrim, the king of Perſia celebrated the
nuptials of his ſon, Mirza Naſir Alli, with the daughter of Ezidan Bukſh,
the ſon of Kaam Bukſh, and grandſon of the famous Aurungzebe. The Shaw
himſelf diſcovered a violent deſire to eſpouſe the beautiful daughter
of Muziſſer Chan<note n="*" place="bottom">The brother of Chan Dowran. He was
ſlain in the battle at Karnal.</note>; but he was prevented by one of his
wives, who had the art to command the furious ſpirit of Nadir Shaw, which the
reſt of the world could not controul.</p>
               <p>During all theſe tranſactions the gates of the city were
kept ſhut. Famine began to rage every day more and more; but the Shaw was
deaf to the miſeries of mankind. The public ſpirit of Tucki, a famous
actor, deſerves to be recorded upon this occaſion. He exhibited a play
before Nadir Shaw, with which that monarch was ſo well pleaſed, that he
commanded Tucki to aſk what he wiſhed ſhould be done for him. Tucki fell
upon his face, and ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"O king, command the gates to be opened, that
the poor may not periſh."</q> His requeſt was granted, and half the city
poured out into the country; and the place was ſupplied in a few days with
plenty of proviſions.</p>
               <p>The king of Perſia, having now raiſed all the money he could
in Delhi, reinſtated Mahummud Shaw in the empire, upon the third of Siffer,
with great ſolemnity and pomp. He placed the crown upon his head with his own
hand, and preſented him with a rich chelat; diſtributing, at the ſame
time, forty more among the Mogul omrahs. He then gave to the emperor ſome
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions concerning the regulation of his army; to which he 
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0828000202:336"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1739.</note>added ſome general maxims
of government. He put him upon his guard againſt the Nizam, who, he plainly
perceived, aſpired above the rank of a ſubject. 
<q rend="inline">"Had not I," ſaid the king of Perſia,
"fooliſhly paſſed my word for his ſafety, the old<note n="*" place="bottom">The Nizam was near ninety years of age.</note> traitor ſhould
not now live to diſturb Mahummud."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Every thing being ready upon the 7th, for Nadir Shaw's return to
Perſia, ſtrict orders were iſſued to his army to carry no ſlaves
away, nor any Indian women, contrary to their inclinations, upon pain of
immediate death. Before his departure, he obliged Mahummud formally to cede to
the crown of Perſia, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Cabul, Peſhawir, Kandahâr,
Ghizni, Moultan and Sind, or, in general, all thoſe countries which lie to
the north-weſt of the Indus and Attoc. The whole of the treaſure which
Nadir Shaw carried from Hindoſtan, amounted, by the beſt computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to
eighty millions of our money.</p>
               <p>When this deſtructive comet, to uſe the expreſſion of
our Indian author, rolled back from the meridian of Delhi, he burnt all the
towns and villages in his way to Lahore, and marked his rout with devaſtation
and death. 
<q rend="inline">"But before he diſappears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the
mountains of Perſia," ſays our author, continuing the metaphor of the
comet, "it may not be improper to throw ſome light on the character of this
ſcourge of Hindoſtan."</q> Nadir Shaw, together with great ſtrength of
body, was endued with uncommon force of mind. Innured to fatigue from his
youth, ſtruggling with dangers and difficulties, he acquired vigor from
oppoſition, and a fortitude of ſoul, unknown in a life of eaſe. His
ambition was unbounded and undiſguiſed: he never fawned for power, but
demanded it as the property of his ſuperior parts. Had he been born to a
throne, he deſerved it; had he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0828000202:337"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1739.</note>a ſubject, his glories
would have been leſs dazzling, but more permanent and pure.</p>
               <p>In a country where patriotiſm and honor are principles little
known, fear is the only means to inforce obedience. This ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Nadir Shaw
ſo cruel and inexorable, that often, in his rage and the hurry of action, he
inflicted general puniſhments for the crimes of a few. Courage, which he
poſſeſſed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the lion, was his only virtue; and he owed
his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the great defects of his mind. Had his eye melted at human
miſeries, had his ſoul ſhuddered at murder, had his breaſt glowed once
with benevolence, or, had his heart revolted at any injuſtice, he might have
lived to an old age, but he would have died without the name of Nadir<note n="*" place="bottom">Wonderful.</note>.</p>

               <head>SECTION II. The Concluſion of the Reign of MAHUMMUD
SHAW.</head>
               <p>THE king of Perſia having evacuated Hindoſtan, the Nizam
began to diſcover his own ambitious deſigns. His rivals were now all
removed; ſome by his villainy, and others by favorable accidents. Without
oppoſition, the management of affairs fell into his hands. Though he
ingroſſed, in fact, the whole power, he delegated the great offices of
ſtate to others. The name of vizier was retained by Kimmir ul Dien, and that
of Buckſhi, or captain-general, was conferred upon the Nizam's ſon, Ghazi
ul Dien Chan. He appointed Emir Chan ſubadâr of Allahabad, which ſo
diſguſted Mahomed Chan Bunguiſh, to whom that government was promiſed
by the former adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he left the court without leave, and
repaired to his Jagier at Ferochabad.</p>
               <p>The government of Oud being vacant by the death of Sadit Chan,
that ſubaſhip was conferred upon an Omrah, called Seifdar Jung, together
with the title of Burhan ul muluck. The Nizam, having nothing to fear from the
ſubas of the other provinces, continued them in their employs.
Notwithſtanding the ſevere blow which the empire had juſt received, no
meaſures were taken to revive the declining power of the crown. This was, by
no means, the intereſt of the Nizam, who now aſſumed every thing of the
king, but the name.</p>
               <p>Mahummud Shaw having ſuffered himſelf to be diveſted of
his power in his capital, it could not be expected that his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould
be much regarded in the provinces. The nabobs <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0828000202:339"/> and rajas,
throughout the empire, paid now little attention to the firmâns of the
court of Delhi. Each of them entertained ideas of independence, and actually
poſſeſſed a regal authority in their governments.—The Mahrattors,
who had, for ſome time back, made large ſtrides to eſtabliſh the
ancient Hindoo government in India,

incurſion into the Carnatic with an army of eighty thouſand horſe, under
the command of Ragojee. Having forced the paſſes of the mountains, they
fell unexpectedly upon Dooſt Ali, nabob of that province, in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
to the Nizam, who was governor-general of the Decan. The forces of Dooſt Ali
were defeated, and he himſelf, together with his ſon, Haſſin Ali, fell
in the action, after having exhibited extraordinary feats of bravery and
firmneſs.</p>
               <p>Sipadar Ali, the ſon, and Chunder Saib, the ſon-in-law of
Dooſt Ali, had ſtill conſiderable armies under their command. But both
having views upon the government of the province, inſtead of oppoſing the
Mahrattors, committed hoſtilities upon one another. The conſequence was,
that they were obliged to ſhut themſelves up in places of ſtrength, the
firſt in Velour, and the latter in Trichinopoly. The enemy were, by this
means, permitted to ravage the province at their leiſure, and to raiſe
heavy contributions upon the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Sipadar Ali, finding he could effect nothing in the field
againſt the Mahrattors, ſet a negotiation on foot with them, by the means
of his father's miniſter, who had been taken priſoner in the action by
thoſe barbarians. It was at laſt determined in private, that, upon
condition the Mahrattors ſhould immediately evacuate the Carnatic, they
ſhould receive one hundred lacks of roupees, at ſtated periods; and that,
as a ſecurity for the payment of this ſum, they ſhould be put in
poſſeſſion of the territory of <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0828000202:340"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1740.</note>Trichinopoly. One of the
terms was, that Sipadar Ali-ſhould be acknowledged nabob of the Carnatic.</p>
               <p>Ali, having thus ſtrengthened himſelf with the alliance of
the Mahrattors, his brother-in-law thought it prudent to pay him homage at
Arcot; not knowing that Trichinopoly, and thoſe diſtricts which he
poſſeſſed, had been made over to the Mahrattors. The barbarians, in the
mean time, returned to their own domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; but, about ſix months
thereafter, they made a ſecond ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption into the Carnatic, to take
poſſeſſion of the territories which had been privately ceded to them by
Sipadar Ali. Chunder Saib ſhut himſelf up in Trichinopoly; and after
ſuſtaining a ſiege of three months, was, upon the ſeventh of Mohirrim,
1154, obliged to ſurrender at diſcretion.</p>
               <p>Theſe tranſactions in the Decan did not diſturb the peace
at Delhi. The king and his miniſters continued in a profound lethargy ever
ſince the invaſion of Nadir Shaw, and ſeemed indifferent about the
affairs of the diſtant provinces. But a preſſing danger at home rouſed
them for a moment. A fellow, from the low rank of a graſs-cutter, raiſed
himſelf to the command of a gang of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. As in the debilitated ſtate
of government, he committed, for ſome time, his depredations with impunity,
his banditti, by degrees, ſwelled to an army of twelve thouſand men. He
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately aſſumed the imperial enſigns, under the title of Daranti
Shaw. This muſhroom of a king was, however, ſoon deſtroyed. Azim Alla, a
gallant Omrah, was ſent againſt him with an army from Delhi. He came up
with the rebels, cut the moſt of them to pieces, and ſlew Daranti in the
action. This happened in the 1153 of the Higera.</p>

Sipadar Ali, nabob of the Carnatic, was aſſaſſinated by his
brother-in-law, Mortaz Ali, who immediately acceded to the Muſnud. But a
general mutiny ariſing in the army, the murderer was obliged to fly from his
capital, in a female dreſs; and Mahummud Chan, the ſon of Sipadar, was
proclaimed ſuba of the Carnatic.</p>
               <p>The Nizam, who claimed the ſovereignty of the Decan, ſeeing
theſe repeated revolutions in the Carnatic, without his concurrence, began to
prepare to leave the court of Delhi. He ſettled his affairs with the
miniſtry, and returned to Hydrabad. He imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately collected an army, and,
in the month of Ramzan, 1155, marched towards the Carnatic with near
three-hundred thouſand men. In the Siſſer of 1156, the Nizam arrived at
Arcot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppoſition; and found the country in ſuch anarchy and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that no leſs than twenty petty chiefs had aſſumed the
titles of Nabob. The Nizam made a regulation, that whoever ſhould take the
name of Nabob, for the future, without permiſſion, ſhould be publickly
ſcourged; and raiſed immediately Abdulla Chan, one of his own generals, to
the ſubaſhip of Arcot; ordering the ſon of Sipadar Ali into confinement.
He, at the ſame time, poſſeſſed himſelf of the city of Trichonopoly
by means of a ſum of money which he gave to Malhar Raw, who commanded there
on the part of the Mahrattors.</p>
               <p>The Nizam, without drawing the ſword, thus ſettled the
affairs of the Carnatic. He returned in triumph to Golcondah, whither Abdulla
Chan, the new governor of Arcot, accompanied him. Abdulla, returning towards
his government, was, the firſt night after his taking leave of the Nizam,
found dead in his bed; not without ſuſpicion of poiſon from Anwar ul Dien
Chan, who ſucceeded him in the nabobſhip of Arcot, in the year 1157.</p>

manner diſpoſed of the provinces of the Decan, without the concurrence of
the court, and actually became king of that country, though he never
aſſumed that title. In the mean time, the Nizam's ſon, Ghazi ul Dien
Chan, overawed Mahummud Shaw at Delhi, and left that indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent prince no more
than the mere ſhadow of royalty.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the Decan, that great limb of the Mogul empire, was cut
off by the Nizam, Aliverdi Chan uſurped the government of Bengal, Behar, and
Oriſſa. This fellow was once a common ſoldier, who, together with his
brother Hamed, came from Tartary in queſt of ſervice to Delhi. In that city
they continued for ſome time in the ſervice of the famous Chan Dowran, and
afterwards became menial ſervants to Suja Chan, nabob of Cattack. Suja Chan,
after the death of Jaſſier Chan, ſucceeded to the government of the three
provinces of Bengal, Behar, and Oriſſa.</p>
               <p>The two Tartars, being poſſeſſed of good natural parts
and ſome education, roſe gradually into office, and were greatly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
by the nabob. Hodjee Hamed had, in a manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his prime miniſter, and,
by his political intrigues in the Haram, obtained the place of Naib, or deputy
of the province of Behar, for his brother Aliverdi, who was then a captain of
horſe.</p>
               <p>Aliverdi was not long eſtabliſhed in his high employ, when
he began to tamper with the venal miniſtry of Delhi, for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
commiſſion for the province, which he then held of Suja Chan. Money, which
has great influence in every country, is all powerful in Hindoſtan. Aliverdi
ſtrengthened his ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0828000202:343"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1741.</note>with a round ſum, and, by
the means of Chan Dowran, became independent ſuba of Behar.</p>
               <p>Suja Chan dying ſoon after, was ſucceeded in the
ſubaſhip of Bengal by his ſon Sirfaraz Chan. We do not mean to
inſinuate, that he had any right of inheritance to his father's government,
or that the ſubadary had been eſtabliſhed in his family by any grant of
the crown, which was contrary to the eſtabliſhed laws of the empire: but
the government was now ſo weak, that the nabobs took upon themſelves to
bequeath their governments to their ſons, which were afterwards, through a
fatal neceſſity, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally confirmed to them from Delhi.</p>
               <p>Sirfaraz, being a man of a haughty and imperious
diſpoſition, ſoon loſt the affection of all his officers. He
diſgraced Hodjee Hamed, and tarniſhed the honor of the powerful family of
Jagga Seat. Hamed, however, took advantage of the general diſaffection to
Sirfaraz's government. He formed a conſpiracy againſt the nabob, and
invited his brother Aliverdi to invade Bengal. Aliverdi accordingly marched
from Patna, in the month of Ramzan 1154, and entering Bengal, defeated and
killed Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faraz Chan, at Geriah, near Muxadabad, and, without further
oppoſition, became ſuba of the three provinces.</p>
               <p>The weak emperor, inſtead of chaſtiſing the uſurper with
an army from Delhi, fell upon an expedient, at once diſgraceful and
impolitic. The Mahrattors threatened Mahummud for the Chout, which, before the
Perſian invaſion, he had promiſed to pay them; and he gave them a
commiſſion to raiſe it themſelves upon the revolted provinces. The
Suu<note n="*" place="bottom">Suu, in the Shanſcrita language, ſignifies
<hi>Glorious.</hi>
                  </note> Raja, the chief of the Mahrattors, ſent accordingly
an army of 50000 horſe, from <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0828000202:344"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1742.</note>his capital of Sattara, to
invade Bengal. This force, under the conduct of Boſcar Pundit, ravaged, with
fire and ſword, all thoſe diſtricts which lie to the weſt of the
Ganges.</p>
               <p>Aliverdi, who was a brave ſoldier, defended himſelf with
great reſolution. But he owed more to his villainy than to his arms. Having
found means to aſſaſſinate the leader of the Mahrattors, he forced them
to retreat.—When the news of this horrid murder reached the ears of the
Suu Raja, he ordered two other armies into Bengal; one by the way of Behar, and
another by that of Cattack. The firſt was, commanded by Balla Raw, and the
latter by Ragojee.—Aliverdi, not being able to cope with this great force
in the field, had recourſe to art. He ſowed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention between the two
chiefs; ſet a private treaty on foot with Balla Raw; who, having received two
years Chout, evacuated the provinces, leaving his colleague to make the beſt
terms he could for himſelf. The ſcale was now turned againſt the
Mahrattors. Ragojee retreated to Cattack, and, with conſtant incurſions and
flying parties, greatly harraſſed the provinces. The good fortune of
Aliverdi at length prevailed, and he ſaw himſelf independent ſovereign of
Bengal, Behar, and Oriſſa: though, to quiet the minds of the people, he
pretended to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs grants from the court, which he himſelf had
actually forged.</p>
               <p>We have been purpoſely ſuccinct on the manner in which the
Decan and Bengal were diſmembered from the empire, as the facts are already
pretty well known in Europe. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, now, to, the affairs of the interior

                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1744.</note>During theſe
tranſactions, nothing happened at Delhi, but the intrigues and factions of a
weak and corrupt adminiſtration. In the year 1157, Ali Mahummud, a Patan of
the Rohilla tribe, Zemindar of Bangur, and Awla, began to appear in arms. Ali
was a ſoldier of fortune, and a native of the mountains of Cabuliſtan, who,
ſome years before his rebellion, came to Delhi, with about three hundred
followers of his own tribe, and was entertained in the ſervice of Mahummud
Shaw. Being eſteemed a gallant officer, the command of a ſmall diſtrict,
upon the road between Delhi and Lahore, was conferred upon him; where he
entertained all vagrants of his own clan, who came down in queſt of military
ſervice, from their native mountains. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Ali expended all the
rents of his diſtrict, and he was hard preſſed for the payment of the
crown's proportion of his income, by the fogedar of Muradabad, to whom he was
accountable.</p>
               <p>Hernind, the fogedar, deſpairing to get any part of the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue from Ali Mahummud, by fair means, prepared to uſe force. He raiſed
15000 of his own vaſſals, with a deſign to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel or chaſtiſe the
refractory Zemindar. Ali, by the aſſiſtance of his northern friends, who
lived upon him, defeated the fogedar, with great ſlaughter, and thus laid the
foundation of the Rohilla government, now ſo formidable in Hindoſtan.</p>
               <p>Kimmir ul Dien, the vizier, upon receiving intelligence at Delhi
of this blow to the regal authority, diſpatched his own ſon, Meer Munnu, a
youth of great bravery, with an army of 30000, againſt the rebels. Meer
Munnu, croſſing the Jumna, advanced to a place called Gurmuchtiſher, on
the banks of the Ganges, and found that Ali Mahummud had acquired ſo much
ſtrength ſince his late victory, that he feared the iſſue of an
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. A negotialion, therefore, was ſet on foot, and, after 
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0828000202:346"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1745.</note>the armies had lain three
months in ſight of one another, a treaty was concluded. The conditions were,
that Ali Mahummud ſhould keep poſſeſſion of the countries, formerly
comprehended in the government of Hirnind, upon paying the ancient revenues to
the crown, and that, in the mean time, one year's payment ſhould be advanced
in four months.</p>
               <p>After this treaty was ratified, Meer Munnu returned to Delhi:
but the appointed time elapſed, without any payments on the part of Ali
Mahummud. He continued to ſtrengthen himſelf, annexed more diſtricts to
his government, and ravaged the neighbouring countries to ſubſiſt his
army. He, in ſhort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came formidable enough to rouſe the indolent
Mahummud Shaw from his lethargy. That monarch took the field, with fifty or
ſixty thouſand horſe, and, in the year 1158, croſſed the Jumna.</p>
               <p>Ali Mahummud, upon the king's approach, retreated acroſs the
Ganges, and ſhut himſelf in Bangur, a place of ſome ſtrength, where the
imperial army inveſted him. The rebel, for the firſt two nights, made
ſucceſsful ſallies, and killed many in the camp of Mahummud Shaw. The
king, however, having drawn lines of circumvallation round the fort, after a
ſhort but bloody ſiege, obliged the garriſon to capitulate. Ali made
terms for his own life, and he was brought priſoner to Delhi, where he
remained in confinement for ſix months.</p>
               <p>The Patan chiefs, who were always, in private, enemies to the
government of the Moguls, caſting their eyes upon Ali Mahum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud, as a very
proper perſon to raiſe their own intereſt, ſolicited the emperor for
his releaſe. The weak monarch granted their requeſt; but the Patans, not
yet ſatisfied, obtained for Ali Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hummud <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0828000202:347"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1747.</note>the fogedarſhip of
Sirhind.—This was ſuch wretched policy in the court of Delhi, that
nothing but downright infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, folly, and the laſt degree of corruption
in the miniſtry, could ever have permitted it to take place. The
conſequence was, that Ali Mahummud collected his diſperſed tribe, kept
poſſeſſion of Sirhind, of ſeveral diſtricts between the rivers and
beyond the Ganges, without remitting one roupee to court.</p>
               <p>We have already ſeen, that all the provinces to the
north-weſt of the Indus were ceded to Nadir Shaw. When that conqueror was
aſſaſſinated in Perſia, Achmet Abdalla, a native of Herat, who had
raiſed himſelf in his ſervice, from the office of Chobdar, or
mace-bearer, to that of Chazanchi, or treaſurer, found means, with the
aſſiſtance of his own tribe, in the confuſion which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded the
Shaw's death, to carry off three hundred camels loaded with wealth, to the
mountains of Afganiſtan. This treaſure enabled Abdalla to raiſe an army,
and to poſſeſs himſelf by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the diſtricts of the mountains,
Herat, part of Chor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſan, and all the provinces ceded by the crown of
Hindoſtan to the king of Perſia. Thus Abdalla laid the foundation of an
empire, in thoſe countries, which formerly compoſed the great monarchy of
Ghizni.</p>
               <p>Achmet Abdalla, perceiving the declining ſtate of the Mogul
government in Hindoſtan, croſſed the Attock, in the beginning of the year
1160, and raiſing contributions upon his march, advanced towards Delhi, with
50000 horſe. The poor Delhians were ſtruck with univerſal panic. The king
himſelf was ſick; and there were diſtractions in the councils of the
miniſters. The preſſure of the danger cemented all their differences.
Ahmed Shaw, the prince royal, Kimmir ul Dien, the vizier, Seid Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labit 
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0828000202:348"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1747.</note>Chan, and Seifdar Jung, took
the field, with 80000 horſe, and marched to oppoſe the invader.</p>
               <p>The imperial army left Delhi upon the 18th of Siſſer, and
advanced to a place called Minoura, ten crores beyond Sirhind. Abdalla's army
were here in ſight; and both, afraid of the iſſue of a battle, ſtrongly
entrenched themſelves. In this ſituation they remained for thirty days;
ſometimes ſkirmiſhing, and at other times negotiating; but Ahmed Shaw
having no money to give, Abdalla would not retreat.</p>
               <p>Abdalla, in the mean time, found means to advance ſome pieces
of artillery, which bore upon the flank of the imperial army. In the evening
the vizier, being at prayers, received a ſhot in the knee, and died that
night. As he was very much eſteemed by the army, which in reality he
commanded, though the prince bore the name, it was propoſed to Ahmed Shaw, by
Meer Munnu, the vizier's ſon, to conceal his death, leſt the troops, who
depended upon his courage and capacity, ſhould be affected by that accident.
The prince, ſeeing the propriety of this meaſure, called together a few of
his principal Omrahs, and held a council of war. It was reſolved, that the
body of the vizier ſhould be mounted upon his own elephant, in the Howadar,
ſupported with pillows; and that in the morning, by day-break, they ſhould
iſſue out of the camp and engage the enemy.</p>
               <p>Orders were accordingly given that night to the Omrahs, to hold
their troops in readineſs, and their reſpective ſtations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to
each. In the morning, before day, the imperial army was in motion; but Abdalla,
having previous notice of their intentions, had prepared to receive them in his
camp. The young prince Ahmed led the attack with uncommon bravery, 
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0828000202:349"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1747.</note>and was gallantly ſeconded
by Meer Munnu, who performed ſurprizing feats of perſonal valour.—The
Perſian defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with equal reſolution, for the ſpace of three
hours. At length, his entrenchments were trodden down by the elephants, and the
imperial army poured into his camp.</p>
               <p>An unfortunate circumſtance, at this inſtant, totally
changed the face of affairs. Iſſur Singh, the ſon of Joyſingh, raja of
Amere, who commanded twenty thouſand horſe, rode up to the vizier's
elephant for orders, and diſcovered that he was dead. Iſſur Singh was
naturally a coward, and only wanted an excuſe to hide his head from danger.
He turned immediately his face from the field, and was followed by all his
troops. The flight of ſo great a part of the army drew many after them,
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Seifdar Jung, nabob of Oud. Abdalla not only recovered his troops
from their confuſion, but preſſed hard upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts in his
turn.</p>
               <p>Meer Munnu, upon this urgent occaſion, diſplayed all the
bravery of a young hero, together with all the conduct of an old general. He
formed in a column, and encouraging his troops, by words and example, bent his
whole force againſt Abdalla's center. He, at the ſame time, diſpatched a
meſſenger to Iſſur Singh and Seifdar Jung, aſſuring them that
Abdalla was already defeated, and if they would return and aſſiſt him in
the purſuit, he would permit none of them ever to repaſs the Indus. The
ſtratagem had the deſired effect. They returned in full gallop to the
field, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the charge with great bravery.</p>
               <p>Abdalla, having almoſt aſſured himſelf of the victory,
was, by this unexpected check, thrown into great confuſion. Meer Munnu took
immediate advantage of the enemy's conſternation, <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0828000202:350"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1747.</note>drove them off the field,
and purſued them five crores beyond their camp. The loſs was nearly equal
on both ſides; but a compleat victory remained to the Moguls; for which they
were entirely indebted to the ſurpriſing efforts of Meer Munnu.</p>
               <p>A ſingle defeat was not enough to diſcourage Abdalla, who
was a brave officer. He collected his diſcomfited army, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced ſome
of his chief Omrahs, conferred their rank and honors upon others, rewarded
thoſe who had behaved well, and, with his ſword drawn, riding through and
through his troops, encouraged them again to action. The Moguls were not a
little ſurprized, next morning, to ſee Abdalla, whom they prepared to
purſue, with his army drawn up in order of battle before their
camp.—This uncommon confidence in a defeated enemy, threw a damp upon the
courage of the conquerors. They contented themſelves with forming the line,
and with ſtanding in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the charge.—Abdalla, as the prince
had ſome advantage of ground, at the ſame time declined coming to action,
and, in the evening, encamped at a ſmall diſtance.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day was ſpent in ſkirmiſhes, and a diſtant
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonade: but, upon the third, to uſe a Perſian expreſſion, the
interval of battle was cloſed, and the ſhock was very violent. Though
irregular armies of horſe make little impreſſion upon a ſolid body of
well-diſciplined infantry; yet when they engage one another, upon equal
terms, each truſts to the ſtrength of his own arm, and the battle is in
general extremely bloody. This irregular kind of attack, it muſt be allowed,
requires a greater degree of perſonal courage, where man to man is oppoſed,
than to ſtand wedged in a cloſe battalion, where the danger may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be
as great, but not ſo apparent.</p>

diſtinguiſhed himſelf in a particular manner in this action; and Meer
Munnu, tenacious of the glory he had already acquired, was not to be
reſiſted. Abdalla, after an obſtinate reſiſtance, was again driven
off the field, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued acroſs the Suttuluz. Here Abdalla, in ſpite
of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, like an able and gallant commander, put the beſt face
upon his affairs. He had loſt all his artillery and baggage, and being now
leſs incumbered than the imperial army, he made a forced march, and, taking a
circuit to the right, repaſſed the river, and next day, to the
aſtoniſhment of the prince and Meer Munnu, was heard off eighteen crores in
their rear, in full march towards Delhi.</p>
               <p>Intelligence of Abdalla's march being received in the capital,
every thing fell into the utmoſt confuſion, and a general panic prevailed.
Ghazi ul Dien, the nizam's ſon, being at court, collected what forces he
could, and marched out of the city to oppoſe Abdalla. The enemy hearing of
this army in their front, would proceed no further. His troops, with one voice,
told Abdalla, That, before they advanced towards Delhi, it was neceſſary to
defeat the imperial army which was behind them. He was therefore conſtrained
to march back towards the prince and Meer Munnu, who expected a third battle:
but Abdalla thought it prudent to decline it; and, by night, repaſſed the
Moguls, and continued his rout to Lahore.</p>
               <p>A change of affairs at the court of Delhi happening at this
time, prevented the prince and Meer Munnu from purſuing Abdalla. They
encamped on the banks of the Suttuluz, where Ahmed Shaw propoſed to confer
the ſubaſhip of Lahore upon any of his Omrahs who would undertake to
recover it from Abdalla. After this offer had been declined by all of them, it

                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1747.</note>was accepted upon theſe
terms by Meer Munnu; who, with a diviſion of the army, marched towards
Lahore, while Ahmed Shaw returned with the reſt to Delhi. Mahummud Shaw had
an inviolable friendſhip for his vizier, Kimmir ul Dien Chan. In the
tottering ſtate of the regal authority, all his confidence was repoſed in
that miniſter. When therefore the news of Kimmir's death came to him at
Delhi, he immediately conſidered his own affairs as deſperate. He retired
to a private apartment, and wept bitterly all night. In the morning he mounted
the throne as uſual, to give public audience; and, whilſt every flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
courtier was running out in praiſe of the deceaſed, the emperor ſeemed
much affected. He, at laſt, exclaimed: 
<q rend="inline">"O cruel fate! thus to break the ſtaff of my
old age.—Where now ſhall I find ſo faithful a
ſervant?"—</q>With theſe words he fell into a fit, to which he was
ſometimes ſubject, and expired ſitting upon his throne.</p>
               <p>The death of Mahummud Shaw happened upon the 8th of Ribbi ul
Sani, in the 1160 year of the Higera, after a diſaſtrous reign of thirty
years. The court endeavored to conceal his death till his ſon prince Ahmed
ſhould arrive. He accordingly, upon the 7th day after his father's deceaſe,
entered Delhi; being ſent for by expreſs from Ghazi ul Dien Chan, who was
ſuppoſed by the ignorant vulgar, who are always ready to aſcribe ſudden
deaths to violence, to have made away with Mahummud Shaw.</p>
               <p>MAHUMMUD SHAW was remarkably comely; of a ſtately ſtature
and affable deportment. He was no ſmall proficient in the learning of his
country; and he wrote the Arabic and Perſian languages with the greateſt
elegance and propriety. He was perſonally brave; but the eaſineſs and
equality of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per made his actions appear undeciſive and irreſolute.
Good-natured <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0828000202:353"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1747.</note>to a fault, he forgave, in
others, crimes which his own ſoul would abhor to commit; and thus he
permitted his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to become a victim to an ill-judged clemency.
Naturally indolent and diffident of his own abilities, his mind perpetually
fluctuated from one object to another. His paſſions therefore took no
determined courſe of their own; but were eaſily diverted into any channel,
by whatever perſon was near him.— 
<q rend="inline">"The ſoul of Mahummud," ſaid a Mogul who
knew him well, "was like the waters of a lake, eaſily agitated by any
ſtorm, but which ſettle immediately after the winds are laid,"</q> If his
eaſineſs or irreſolution in politicks led him into many errors, he bore
with indifference, if not with ſortitude, the miſfortunes which were their
natural conſequence.</p>
               <p>Born in the ſunſhine of a court, brought up in the boſom
of luxury, confined within the walls of a zennana, and, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, educated
among eunuchs, as effeminate as thoſe whom they guard, we are not to wonder
that the princes of the Eaſt ſhould degenerate in a few generations. If to
theſe obſtructions to the exertion of the manly faculties of the ſoul, we
add the natural lenity of Mahummud, a common but unfortunate virtue in the race
of Timur, it ought not to ſurprize us, that in a country like India, his
reign ſhould be crowded with uncommon misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. Had his fate placed
Mahummud in Europe, where eſtabliſhed laws ſupply the want of parts in a
monarch, he might have ſlumbered with reputation upon a throne; and left
behind him the character of a good, though not of a great, prince.</p>

               <head>SECTION III. The Hiſtory of the Reign of AHMED SHAW.</head>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1747.</note>UPON the 17th of Ribbi ul
Sani, in the year 1160 of the Higera, AHMED SHAW, the ſon of Mahummud,
mounted the throne of Delhi. The firſt act of this reign, was the
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Seifdar Jung, the irreſolute ſuba of Oud, to the vizarit.
This fellow was originally a merchant of Perſia, known there by the name of
Abul Munſur. He travelled to India to ſell his commodities; and was
retained there as an accomptant, by the famous Sadit Chan, governor of Oud. He
behaved ſo much to his maſter's ſatisfaction in that ſtation, that he
advanced him to a command in the army, and conferred upon him his daughter in
marriage. His alliance with Sadit ſo much raiſed his intereſt at the
court of Delhi, that, upon the death of his father-in-law, he was raiſed to
the ſubaſhip of Oud. Though he was a very bad ſoldier, ſuch was the
ſmoothneſs of his tongue and plauſibility of behavior, that he paſſed
upon the weak as a man of conſiderable parts; which, together with ſome
know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the finances, paved his way to the high employ of vizier. Ghazi
ul Dien continued bukſhi; and no other material changes in the
adminiſtration happened upon the acceſſion of Ahmed.</p>
               <p>The war with Abdalla, which was now carried on in Punjab by Meer
Munnu with various ſucceſs, ingroſſed the attention of the court of
Delhi; for the greateſt part of the imperial army was employed in that
ſervice. Advices, in the mean time, arrived from the Decan, of the death of
the famous Nizam ul muluck, in the one hundred and fourth year of his age; and 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0828000202:355"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1747.</note>that his ſecond ſon,
Naſir Jung, acceded to the government. It may not, perhaps, be out of place
here, to give a ſhort ſketch of the character of the Nizam, who for a long
time made ſo great a figure in India.</p>
               <p>The Nizam, though no great warrior, was reckoned a conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
politician, in a country where low craft and deceit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any principles of
honor and integrity, obtain the appellation of great parts. The dark deſigns
of his mind lay always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed behind an uncommon plauſibility and
eloquence of tongue. His paſſions were ſo much under his command, that he
was never known to diſcover any violent emotion even upon the moſt critical
and dangerous occaſions: but this apathy did not ariſe from fortitude, but
from deep diſſimulation and deſigns. It was with him an unalterable maxim
to uſe ſtratagem rather than force; and to bring about with private
treachery, what even could be accompliſhed with open force. He ſo
habituated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to villainy, that the whole current of his ſoul ran in
that channel; and it was even doubtful whether he could for a moment divert it
to honeſty to bring about his moſt favored deſigns. If the Nizam ſhewed
any tendency to virtue, it was by ſubſtituting a leſſer wickedneſs
for a greater. When fraud and circumvention could accompliſh his purpoſe,
he never uſed the dagger or bowl. To ſum up his character in a few words;
without ſhame, he was perfidious to all mankind; without remorſe, a traitor
to his king and country; and, without, terror, a hypocrite in the preſence of
his god.<note n="*" place="bottom">Naſir Jung, the nizam's ſon, having
rebelled, was at the head of a great army. The deceitful old man counterfeited
ſickneſs ſo well, and wrote ſuch pathetic letters to Naſir,
requeſting to ſee him before he died, that the young fellow was taken in
the ſnare, viſited his father, and was impriſoned.</note>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0828000202:356"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1748.</note>When the news of Nizam ul
muluck's death came to Delhi, Ghazi ul Dien, who was his eldeſt ſon,
applied to the king for his ſubaſhip. But Naſir Jung, being
poſſeſſed of his father's treaſure, raiſed a great army, and
marched from Aurungabad towards Delhi; not on pretence of war, but to pay his
reſpects to the emperor. Ahmed dreaded nothing more than this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
viſit from a man at the head of ſo great a force. He judged that Naſir
Jung, under that ſpecious pretext, covered a deſign to extort from him a
confirmation of the ſubadary of the Decan. He therefore durſt not favor the
pretenſions of Ghazi to the provinces of the Decan, and conſequently was
reduced to the neceſſity of confirming Naſir Jung in his uſurpation.
Thus the ſtorm was diverted, and the new Nizam returned to Aurungabad.</p>
               <p>In the year 1161, Caim Chan Bunguiſh, jagierdâr of
Feroch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abad, having differed with Ali Mahummud, a neighbouring Zemindar, they
both drew out their vaſſals and dependents, and fought about ten crores
above Ferochabad, and Caim Chan was defeated and ſlain. Seifdar Jung, the
vizier, being informed of theſe tranſactions, ſent orders to Raja Nevil
Roy, his deputy in the province of Oud, to confiſcate the eſtate of Caim
Chan. The deputy rigorouſly executed the vizier's orders. He ſeized upon
Caim Chan's five ſons, together with five of his adopted ſlaves, confined,
and afterwards aſſaſſinated them at Allahabad. Ahmed Chan, another
ſon of Caim Chan, remained ſtill alive; and, in order to revenge the death
of his brothers, raiſed the Patan tribe, of which he was now acknowledged
chief, and marched againſt Nevil Roy, who had collected all his forces to
oppoſe him.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0828000202:357"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1748.</note>In the beginning of the year
1162, the two armies met at a place near Lucknow, called Callinuddi. The Patans
were ſcarcely four thouſand ſtrong; but the army of the deputy of Oud
conſiſted of at leaſt twenty thouſand. The Patan chief, inſpired by
revenge, and vigorouſly ſupported by his friends, attacked in perſon
Nevil Roy in the very center of his army, and ſlew his enemy with his own
hand. The army of Nevil Roy, ſeeing him fall, immediately quitted the field.
Their artillery and baggage, and ſoon after almoſt the whole province of
Oud, fell into the victor's hands.</p>
               <p>When the news of this diſaſter arrived at Delhi, Seifdar
Jung, the vizier, talked in a very high ſtrain, and requeſted of the
emperor, that he might be permitted to lead an army againſt Ahmed Chan. The
ſultan conſented; but the ſeaſon being far ſpent before the army was
levied, the expedition was deferred till the ſolſtitial rains ſhould be
over. In the month of Mohirrim, 1163, the vizier, with an army of eighty
thouſand men, marched from Delhi; and, without diſtinction of age, ſex,
or condition, put all the Patans he could find to the ſword. Ahmed Chan was
not intimidated by this great force. With ſcarce twelve thouſand men he
marched from Ferochabad, and met the imperialiſts at Shuru Sahawir, near that
city.</p>
               <p>The day happened to be very windy, and Ahmed improved that
circumſtance to his own advantage. He wheeled to windward, and the duſt
flew in ſuch clouds in the face of the imperial army, that they did not
diſcover the motions of Ahmed; but aſcribed the darkneſs which involved
themſelves to the effects of a whirlwind, common at that ſeaſon of the
year. The enemy, however, like a thunderbolt, iſſued from the boſom of
this ſtorm, and at once ſtruck the Moguls with terror and diſmay. 
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0828000202:358"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1749.</note>The Patans made ſuch good
uſe of their ſwords, that they ſoon covered the field with dead; and the
cowardly Seifdar Jung, without making one effort, was the firſt of his army
who fled. The Jates and Rohillas, though thus ſhamefully deſerted by their
general, made head againſt Ahmed Chan, and found means to carry off the
greateſt part of the artillery, which conſiſted of twelve hundred pieces
of various bores. But neither of thoſe tribes returned the guns to the king:
they carried them to their own forts, to ſtrengthen themſelves againſt
his authority.</p>
               <p>This overthrow was a dreadful ſtroke to the tottering empire.
The greateſt part of the province of Oud was loſt; the Jates, a numerous
tribe of Hindoos, who poſſeſſed a large territory near Agra; and the
Rohillas, a Patan nation, who inhabited the greateſt part of the country
between Delhi and Lucknow, ſeeing the whole imperial force baffled by a petty
chief, began to throw off their allegiance. Seifdar Jung, in the mean time,
arrived with a ſmall part of his army at Delhi; and Ghazi Chan adviſed the
king to put him to death for the diſgrace which he had drawn upon his arms.
This puniſhment would not have been too ſevere for the vizier's bad
behaviour: but that miniſter had ſtrengthened his intereſt by a coalition
with Juneid Chan, the chief eunuch.</p>
               <p>The queen-mother, Begum Kudſia, being a woman of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
had, for want of a better lover, fixed her affection upon the chief eunuch. She
had the addreſs to direct the weak monarch in every thing, and to keep him in
leading-ſtrings upon the throne. Juneid Chan, though in no public employ, by
means of Kudſia's favor, held the helm of government; and, by his influence,
not only ſaved the vizier's life, but continued him in his office.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0828000202:359"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1750.</note>In the courſe of the
ſame year, a treaty was concluded with the Mahrattors, who were ſpreading,
their devaſtations over the ſouthern provinces. The Chout was ſtipulated
to be regularly paid by the empire to thoſe troubleſome barbarians. Ahmed
Shaw ordered an army to be levied, to recover the province of Oud; and it was
ſoon compleated by the acceſſion of forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Mahrattors, who
inlifted themſelves in the imperial ſervice. But inſtead of putting
himſelf at the head of his forces, the weak emperor, by the advice of his
mother and her gallant, gave the command of it to his vizier, that he might
have an opportunity to retrieve his loſt honour.</p>
               <p>Raja Sourage Mull, prince of the Jates, by the acquiſition of
the Mahrattors to the imperial army, judged it prudent once more to join the
vizier with all his forces; ſo that the miniſter's army now conſiſted
of no leſs than one hundred thouſand men. Seifdar Jung marched from Delhi,
in the year 1164, againſt Ahmed Chan: but the Raja of the Jates, inſtead of
aiding him, found means to fruſtrate all his deſigns. Having ſpent a
whole campaign without coming to action, he patched up a very diſhonorable
peace, and returned to Delhi with the Mahrattor mercenaries at his heels,
mutinous for want of their pay.</p>
               <p>The demand of the Mahrattors amounted to fifty lacks of roupees,
which the government was in no condition to pay: and the ſum gradually
increaſed with the delay. Ghazi ul Dien, who had been for ſome time
ſoliciting for a royal commiſſion for the ſubaſhip of the Decan,
promiſed to pay off the Mahrattor debt, upon condition he ſhould receive
from the emperor that appointment. Ahmed Shaw was glad upon any terms to pet
rid of thoſe clamorous and dangerous mercenaries, and accordingly iſſued
out the imperial ſunnuds to Ghazi. That Omrah having <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0828000202:360"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1751.</note>ſatisfied the Mahrattors
in their demands upon Ahmed, engaged them immediately in his own ſervice; and
having added to them a great army of either troops, obtained his own office of
buckſhi for his ſon Ghazi, a youth of fifteen years of age, and marched
towards the Decan.</p>
               <p>The elder Ghazi's brother, Naſir Jung, ſuba of the Decan,
and his ſon Muziffer, who had ſucceeded him in the government, were both
dead. Sillabut Jung, the third ſon of the old Nizam, now ſat upon the
Muſnud, which Ghazi claimed by the right of primogeniture. In the month of
Zehidge, 1165, he, with an army of one hundred and fifty thouſand men,
arrived in the environs of Aurungabad. The forces of his brother, Sillabut
Jung, the reigning ſuba, were ſomewhat inferior in number, but they were
ſtrengthened by a body of French mercenaries, which, in all probability,
would inſure to him the victory. Sillabut Jung, however, was afraid of the
iſſue of a general battle; and, after ſome ſlight ſkirmiſhes, he
found means to prevail with his uncle's wife to take off his competitor with
poiſon. Thus did the perfidious Sillabut Jung ſecure to himſelf the
empire of the Decan, without a rival.</p>
               <p>But to return to the tranſactions of the court of Delhi:
Seifdar Jung, the vizier, finding that his own influence declined, and that
Juneid Chan, the favorite eunuch, carried all before him, invited him to an
entertainment, and, contrary to the laws of hoſpitality, and altogether
forgetful that he owed to Juneid his own life and fortune, aſſaſſinated
him by the hands of Iſhmaiel Chan, one of his adopted ſlaves. Ahmed Shaw,
being informed of this preſumptuous villainy, flew into a violent rage,
degraded Seifdar Jung from the vizarit, and baniſhed him the court. This was
the effect of a ſit of paſſion; for the unfortunate king was 
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0828000202:361"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1751.</note>in no condition, in fact, to
exert ſo far his authority. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious vizier, finding that he had
nothing to hope from ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, broke out into open rebellion. He
ſoon after, by the aſſiſtance of the Jates, advanced to Delhi, and
beſieged Ahmed Shaw and young Ghazi, the buckſhi, in that city.</p>
               <p>The ſon of Kimmir ul Dien, who, in the reign of Mahummud, held
ſo long the vizarit, was raiſed, under the title of Chan Chanan, to the
vacant employ of Seifdar Jung, and began to ſhew ſome abilities in his new
office. Young Ghazi, who was a youth of extraordinary parts, defended the city
with great reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for three months. The rebels were at laſt ſo
diſpirited, that Ghazi ventured to attack them in the field, and gained a
complete victory. Seifdar Jung fled towards his former ſubaſhip of Oud, and
left his allies, the Jates, under Raja Sourage Mull, to extricate themſelves
from the perilous ſituation to which he had brought them.</p>
               <p>The rebellion of Seifdar happened in the year 1166. The Jates
being deſerted by him, were in no condition to keep the field againſt
Ghazi. They fled before the imperial army under Akebut Chan, to their own
territories near Agra. That general inveſted the ſtrong fortreſs of
Billemgur, which he took by capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation; but ſo little did he regard his
plighted faith to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, that he put them all to the ſword. The
Jates, in the mean time, came before the imperial army; but diffident of their
own ſtrength in the field, they ſeparated their forces, and ſhut
themſelves up in their forts. The imperial general alſo divided his army
into detachments, and laid at once ſiege to the two ſtrong forts of Dieg
and Combere, lying in the territory between Agra and Delhi.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0828000202:362"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1752.</note>Ghazi ul Dien, in the mean
time, to carry on more effectually the war againſt the Jates, obtained
permiſſion from the emperor, to call in forty thouſand Mahrattors, under
their two chiefs, Jeiapa Malhar Raw, and Raganut Raw. By this acquiſition of
ſtrength, the imperialiſts were enabled to carry on the ſieges with
vigor. At Delhi, young Ghazi and the new vizier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the command of
the army. This conteſt was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fatal in its conſequences; but for
the preſent Ghazi ul Dien prevailed. He marched with a reinforcement from
Delhi; and, upon his arrival in the country of the Jates, took the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of
the imperial army.</p>
               <p>The ſieges continued two months after the arrival of Ghazi;
and the garriſons were reduced to the laſt extremities. The
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts, in the mean time, had expended all their ammunition; and Ghazi
was, upon that account, obliged to diſpatch Akebut Mahmood to Delhi, with a
good force, to bring him the neceſſary ſtores. The vizier ſeeing that
the ſtrong holds of the Jates muſt ſoon fall into the hands of Ghazi,
ſhould he be ſupplied with ammunition, and being extremely jealous of any
thing that might throw honor upon his rival, poiſoned the mind of the weak
king againſt his buckſhi, by means of forged letters and villainous
inſinuations, that the young Omrah aſpired to the throne. The enterprizing
genius, and great abilities of Ghazi, gave ſome color to ſuſpicions of
that kind; and the unfortunate Ahmed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of promoting his own cauſe
againſt the Jates, took every meaſure to prevent the ſucceſs of
Ghazi.</p>
               <p>The king accordingly begun to levy forces in Delhi, and wrote a
letter to Raja Sourage Mull, the chief of the Jates, to make an obſtinate
defence, and that he himſelf would ſoon relieve him: that, under pretence
of joining the army under Ghazi, he would <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0828000202:363"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A.D. 1752.</note>attack that general in the
rear, and at the ſame time diſplay a ſignal to the Raja, to ſally from
the fort of Combere.—Thus the king, as if infatuated by his evil genius,
planned his own ruin. His letter fell into the hands of Ghazi, whoſe friends
at court had informed him of the intrigues of the vizier. Struck with the
king's ingratitude, and urged on by ſelf-defence, he immediately reſolved
upon open hoſtility. He raiſed the ſieges, and croſſed the Jumna, to
oppoſe Ahmed Shaw and his vizier, who were marching down between the
rivers.</p>
               <p>The king, hearing of Ghazi's approach, halted at Secundra, and
endeavoured, by fair promiſes, to bring back that Omrah to his duty. Ghazi,
in anſwer to the king's meſſage, returned to him his own letter to Raja
Sourage Mull. He wrote him, at the ſame time, that 
<q rend="inline">"he could place no confidence in a man, who
plotted againſt his life, for no crime; if to ſerve the ſtate was not
one. What mercy," continued Ghazi, "can I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from Ahmed, in the days of
rebellion, when he treated me as a traitor, in the days of loyalty and
friendſhip? A prince, that is weak enough to liſten to the baſe
inſinuations of every ſycophant, is unworthy to rule over brave men; who,
by the laws of God and nature, are juſtified to uſe the power which
providence has placed in their hands, to protect themſelves from
injuſtice."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The king perceived, by the ſtrain of this letter, that Ghazi
was reſolved to puſh him to the laſt extremity. He, however, durſt not
engage him in the field. He made the beſt of his way to Delhi, and was ſo
cloſely purſued by Ghazi, that that Omrah poſſeſſed himſelf of
one of the gates; upon which Ahmed Shaw and the vizier ſhut themſelves up,
with a ſmall party, in the citadel. Ghazi immediately inveſted the place;
and the <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0828000202:364"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1753.</note>king, after a faint
reſiſtance, ſurrendered himſelf. Ghazi, after reproaching him for his
intentions againſt his life, committed him and the vizier to the charge of
Akebut Mahmood. The unfortunate ſultan was deprived of ſight, the next day,
by the means of an hot iron. It is ſaid, by ſome, that this was done by
Akebut Mahmood, without orders, to ſhew his zeal for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his
patron; but, from the general character of Ghazi, we have no reaſon to doubt
his being concerned in this crime.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the reign of the unfortunate Ahmed Shaw: a prince,
who, in his firſt exploits, appeared with ſome luſtre. When he mounted
the throne, as if action degraded royalty, he altogether gave himſelf up to
indolence. To ſave the trouble of thinking, he became the dupe of every
ſpecious flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, and at laſt fell the unlamented victim of his own
folly. He poſſeſſed all the clemency of the houſe of Timur; but that
virtue was now, in ſome meaſure, a vice, in a country ſo corrupt, and in
an age ſo degenerate. Though Ahmed was not defective in perſonal courage,
he may truly be ſaid to be a coward in mind: dangers appeared formidable to
him, through a troubled imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which, upon trial, he had fortitude to
ſurmount.—He ſat upon the throne of Delhi ſeven lunar years and one
month; and was depoſed in the month of Jemmad ul awil, in the 1167 of the
Higera.</p>
               <p>The power and extent of the empire were very much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
in the reign of Ahmed Shaw. All the provinces, except thoſe between the
frontiers of the Jates, a few miles to the eaſt of Delhi, and Lahore to the
weſt, were, in fact, diſmembered from the government of the houſe of
Timur, though they paid a nominal allegiance. The rich kingdom of Guzerat was
divided between the Mahrattors and a Patan tribe, called Babbé; the

Allahabad, by Mahummud Kuli; and the countries round Agra, by Raja Sourage
Mull, the chief of the Jates.—Budaoon, and all the provinces to the north
of Delhi, were in the hands of Mahum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud Ali, Sadulla Chan, and other chiefs of
the Rohilla tribe of Patans. A number of petty Rajas ſtarted up into
independent princes in Malava: Bucht Singh ſeized upon the extenſive
ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of Marwâr, and Madoo Singh reigned in the provinces round
Joinagur and Amere.</p>
               <p>The gallant Meer Munnu ſtill oppoſed the torrent of
invaſion from the north. He maintained the war with ſucceſs, againſt
Abdalla, for the provinces of Moultan and Punjab, and, for a ſhort ſpace of
time, ſupported the declining empire. Every petty chief, in the mean time, by
counterfeited grants from Delhi, laid claim to jagiers and to diſtricts: the
country was torn to pieces by civil wars, and groaned under every ſpecies of
domeſtic confuſion. Villainy was practiſed in every form; all law and
religion were trodden under foot; the bands of private friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and
connections, as well as of ſociety and government, were broken; and every
individual, as if amidſt a foreſt of wild beaſts, could rely upon nothing
but the ſtrength of his own arm.</p>

               <head>SECTION IV. The Hiſtory of the Reign of ALLUMGIRE
SANI.</head>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A.D. 1753.</note>UPON the ſame day that
Ahmed Shaw was deprived of ſight, Ghazi ul Dien releaſed from confinement
Eaz ul Dien, the ſon of Moaz ul Dien, and grandſon of Bahadar Shaw, the
ſon and ſucceſſor of the famous Aurungzebe. This prince was placed by
Ghazi upon the throne, by the name of ALLUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIRE. To begin his reign with an
act of beneficence, he ordered ſeventeen perſons of the imperial houſe of
Timur to be releaſed from priſon, to grace his coronation. It may not be
improper here to ſay ſomething concerning the inauguration of the Mogul
emperors.</p>
               <p>When a prince is, for the firſt time, ſeated upon the
throne, with the royal umbrella over his head, the Omrahs, according to their
dignity, are ranged in two lines before, one upon his right, the other to his
left hand. A herald then proclaims his titles; and the Omrahs, each in his
ſtation, advance with an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in gold, which he himſelf receives from
their hands. The ſuperintendant of the kitchen brings then a golden ſalver,
with bread, confections, and other eatables, over which the king, joined by the
whole court, repeats a form of grace; and then he eats a little, and
diſtributes the remainder, with his own hand, among the nobility. This latter
is an ancient Mogul ceremony, introduced by the family of Timur. The emperor
mounts then his ſtate-elephant, and, attended by all the court, moves
ſlowly towards the great Muſgid, throwing, as he advances, gold, ſilver,
precious ſtones, and pearls, among the populace. In the Muſgid he repeats a
prayer, and afterwards divine ſervice is performed by <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0828000202:367"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1753.</note>the Sidder ul
ſuddûr, or the metropolitan of Delhi. The Chutba, or the genealogy and
titles of the king, are then read, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the palace with the
ſame magnificence and pomp. The Mogul emperors are never crowned: but upon
ſome feſtivals they ſit in ſtate, under a large golden crown, which is
ſuſpended by a chain to the roof of the preſence-chamber, and ſerves
the purpoſe of a canopy.</p>
               <p>Allumgire found himſelf as much a priſoner upon the throne,
as he was formerly in his confinement. He was not a man of parts ſufficient
to extricate himſelf from the toils of that power, to which he owed his
advancement; but had he made no efforts to acquire ſome authority, the empire
might have been, perhaps, reſtored to its original dignity and ſplendor, by
the very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary abilities of Ghazi ul Dien.—That Omrah now
poſſeſſed the office of the vizarit. Allumgire, without the capacity of
guiding the operations of government himſelf, began to turn all his mean
parts to thwart the ſchemes of the vizier. Without conſidering whether the
meaſure was right or wrong, it was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that it came from the
vizier, for the emperor to oppoſe it by his minions.</p>
               <p>This averſion in the king to Ghazi, did not long eſcape the
penetrating eyes of that young Omrah. He knew that he was ſurrounded by many
enemies, and therefore was unwilling to reſign an employ, from which he
derived protection to his own perſon. In the mean time all buſineſs was
ſuſpended, and the two factions, like armies afraid of the iſſue of a
battle, watched the motions of one another.—Nothing remarkable happened
at Delhi, during the firſt year of Allumgire, but the aſſaſſination
of the former vizier, about ſix months after his impriſonment, by the
orders of Ghazi ul Dien.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0828000202:368"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1754.</note>But, in the courſe of this
year, the empire received a ſevere blow on its frontiers, by the death of the
gallant Meer Munnu, by a fall from his horſe. He had, in many engagements,
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated Abdalla, and recovered from him the whole province of Lahore. No
ſooner was this brave Omrah dead, than Abdalla re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquered all he had
loſt; and, advancing to Lahore, confirmed his ſon, then an infant, in the
government of that place, under the direction of an experienced Omrah.</p>
               <p>The great ſucceſs of Abdalla, in the north-weſt, began to
rouſe the court of Delhi. It was at laſt reſolved, that Ali Gohar<note n="*" place="bottom">The preſent emperor.</note>, Allumgire's eldeſt ſon,
ſhould, in conjunction with Ghazi ul Dien, the vizier, march with the
imperial army againſt the Perſians. The treaſury was now empty; and the
few provinces, ſubject to the empire, were grievouſly oppreſſed for
money to raiſe a force for this expedition.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the year 1169, the imperial army,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 80000 men, under the prince and young Ghazi, took the field.
They advanced to a place called Matchiwarra, about twenty crores beyond
Sirhind. They found Abdalla ſo well eſtabliſhed in his new conqueſts,
that they thought it prudent to proceed no further. The whole campaign
paſſed in ſettling a treaty of marriage, between the vizier and the
daughter of Meer Munnu. It ſeems that Omrah, to ſtrengthen his intereſt
at the court of Delhi, had, before his death, promiſed his daughter to Ghazi;
but, after that event, both the young lady and her mother were extremely
averſe to the match. When the imperial army lay at Matchiwarra, the vizier
inveigled both the ladies from Lahore to the camp, and finding all intreaty was
in vain to obtain their conſent, he, with peculiar baſeneſs, cloſely
confined them, to intimidate them into a compliance. This together with
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0828000202:369"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1755.</note>the provinces, through which
he marched, comprehended the whole exploits of Ghazi on this expedition. After
ſpending all the public money in this vain parade, the prince and vizier,
without ſtriking a blow, returned to Delhi.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of this inaction of the vizier proceeded from
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which he daily received from court. The king and his faction gained
ſtrength during his abſence; and he foreſaw his own ruin, in caſe he
ſhould meet with a defeat from Abdalla. Upon his return to Delhi, he found it
neceſſary, in order to ſupport his declining authority, to act with great
rigor and tyranny. Some Omrahs he removed with the dagger, and others he
deprived of their eſtates. He confined the king in the citadel, and did
whatſoever he pleaſed, as if he himſelf was veſted with the regal
dignity.</p>
               <p>Allumgire, finding himſelf in this diſagreeable ſituation,
adopted a very dangerous plan to extricate himſelf. He wrote privately to
Abdalla, to advance with his army, to relieve him from the hands of his
treacherous vizier. He promiſed, that upon his arrival on the environs of
Delhi, he ſhould be joined by the bulk of the imperial army, under the
command of Nigib ul Dowla, a Rohilla chief, to whom Ghazi had delegated his own
office of buckſhi, when he roſe to the employ of vizier. Thus the weak
Allumgire, to avoid one evil, plunged headlong into greater misfortunes.</p>
               <p>Abdalla, having received theſe aſſurances from the king,
marched from Cabul, where he then kept his court, entered Hindoſtan with a
great army, and, in the year 1171, appeared before Delhi. The vizier marched
out with the imperial forces to give him battle; but, in the field he was
deſerted by his <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0828000202:370"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1757.</note>friend, Nigib ul Dowla, with
the greateſt part of his army. The ignorance of Ghazi ul Dien of a plot ſo
long carried on, is a great proof of his extreme unpopularity. The
conſequence was, that Ghazi was obliged to throw himſelf upon the clemency
of Abdalla, who had ſworn vengeance againſt him, ſhould he ever fall into
his hands. But ſuch was the addreſs of the vizier, that he not only found
means to mollify the Perſian, but even to make him his friend. He was,
however, at firſt turned out of his office, but he was ſoon after
reſtored by Abdalla himſelf, who now diſpoſed of every thing, as if he
was abſolute king of Delhi.</p>
               <p>Abdalla entered the city, and laid the unfortunate inhabitants
under a contribution of a crore of roupees; a ſum now more difficult to
raiſe than ten crores, in the days of Nadir Shaw. The Perſian remained two
months in Delhi. The unhappy Allumgire, not only found that his capital was
robbed, but that he himſelf was delivered over again into the hands of a
perſon, who had now added reſentment to ambition and power.</p>
               <p>The Perſian, after theſe tranſactions, took the prince,
Hedad Buxſh, brother to the preſent emperor, as hoſtage for Allumgire's
future behavior; and, having forced Meer Munnu's daughter to ſolemnize her
marriage with Ghazi, marched towards Agra. He, on his way, laid ſiege to
Muttra, took it by aſſault; and, having ſacked the place, put the
inhabitants to the ſword, for the enormous crime of attempting to defend
their lives and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. After this ſcene of barbarity, Abdalla advanced to
Agra, which was held on the part of the king<note n="*" place="bottom">Though the
Jates had all the country round Agra, they had not yet poſſeſſed
themſelves of that city.</note> by Fazil Chan. This Omrah defended the city
with ſuch reſolution, that Abdalla, <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0828000202:371"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1757.</note>after ſuſtaining ſome
loſs, thought it prudent to raiſe the ſiege; but, being exaſperated at
this repulſe, he ſpread death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation through the territories of
the Jates, who, unable to cope with him in the field, had retired into their
ſtrong holds; from which, they at times iſſued, and cut off his
ſtraggling parties.—The Perſian returned to a place called Muxadabad,
about eight crores from Delhi. Allumgire came out to pay his reſpects to him;
and, by his conduct, ſeems to have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly infatuated. When the cries
of his diſtreſſed people reached heaven, that contemptible monarch,
inſtead of endeavoring to alleviate their miſeries, either by force or
negotiation, was wholly bent on the gratification of a ſenſual appetite.
The cauſe of his viſit to Abdalla, was to obtain his influence and
mediation with Sahibe Zimany, the daughter of Mahummud Shaw, whom he wanted to
eſpouſe; the princeſs herſelf being averſe to the match. When kings,
inſtead of exerting their talents for the protection of their people,
ſuffer themſelves to be abſorbed in indolence and ſenſuality,
rebellion becomes patriotiſm, and treaſon itſelf is a virtue.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the news of ſome incurſions from the
weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Perſia, into the territories of Abdalla, recalled that prince from
India. Malleké Jehan, the widow of Mahummud Shaw, and her daughter
Sahibe Zimany, claimed his protection againſt Allumgire. He carried them both
to Cabul, and ſome time after eſpouſed the daughter himſelf.—The
Perſian having evacuated the imperial provinces, the vizier became more cruel
and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive than ever: he extorted money from the poor by tortures, and
confiſcated the eſtates of the nobility, upon falſe or very frivolous
pretences. To theſe tyrannies he was no leſs driven by the neceſſity of
ſupporting an army to inforce his authority, than he was by the natural
avidity and cruelty of his own unprincipled mind.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0828000202:372"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1758.</note>The king and his eldeſt
ſon, Ali Gohar, were, in the mean time, kept ſtate priſoners. The latter
made his eſcape in the year 1172, and levying ſix thouſand men at Rowari,
began to raiſe the revenues of the adjacent territories. After he had
continued this vagrant kind of life for nine months, the vizier, by the means
of inſidious letters, in which Ittul Raw, chief of the Mahrattors, Raja
Dewali Singh, Raja Nagor Mull, and many other Omrahs, ſwore to protect him,
inveigled him to Delhi. But, in violation of all oaths and fair promiſes, he
was inſtantly confined by Ghazi, in the houſe of Alla Murda Chan, where he
remained for the ſpace of two months.</p>
               <p>The vizier having received intelligence that the prince was
privately attaching ſome Omrahs to his intereſt, and fearing that, by their
means, he might again make his eſcape, determined to remove him to the
citadel. He ordered a detachment of five hundred horſe to execute this
ſervice. The prince not only refuſed to comply with the vizier's orders for
his removal, but ordered the gates of the houſe to be ſhut, and, with a few
friends, betook himſelf to arms. The houſes of the nobility in Hindoſtan
are ſurrounded by ſtrong walls; and, in fact, are a kind of ſmall forts.
The vizier's troops found it therefore extremely difficult to reduce the
prince. He was beſieged cloſely for two days; and, finding that he could
not defend himſelf much longer from the thouſands that ſurrounded the
houſe, he formed the gallant reſolution to cut his way through the
enemy.</p>
               <p>He imparted his intentions to his friends, but they ſhrunk
from his propoſal as impracticable. At laſt, ſix of them, ſeeing him
reſolved to attempt this deſperate undertaking alone, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to
accompany him. On the morning of the third day, <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0828000202:373"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1758.</note>they mounted their horſes
within the court. The gate was ſuddenly thrown open, and they iſſued
forth ſword in hand, with the prince at their head. He cut his way through
thouſands of Ghazi's troops, with only the loſs of one of his gallant
follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Raja Ramnat, and Seid Ali, were the two principal men concerned in
this extraordinary exploit; the other four being common horſemen. Seid Ali
was wounded, but four and the prince eſcaped without any hurt.</p>
               <p>The prince having thus forced his way through the vizier's army,
iſſued out of the city, and arrived at a place, called Vizierabad, about
ſix crores from the ſuburbs. Ittul Raw, the Mahrattor chief, lay encamped
with ten thouſand horſe at Vizier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abad. Ittul had been hired as a mercenary
by the vizier, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him in his tyrannical proceedings: but reſenting
Ghazi's breach of promiſe to the prince, and not being regularly paid, he now
thought of plundering the country under the ſanction of Ali Gohar's name. He
received him, therefore, with very great reſpect, and promiſed to ſupport
him.</p>
               <p>The prince, and Ittul Raw, accordingly continued, for the
ſpace of ſix months, to raiſe contributions on the provinces to the
ſouth of Delhi: but as the petty chiefs of villages had, during the
confuſions of the empire, conſtructed mud forts, whither they retired with
their families and effects, at the approach of danger, the Mahrattors found
great difficulty in ſupporting themſelves, as none of thoſe forts could
be reduced without a regular ſiege, in which they were very little ſkilled.
Ittul Raw, tired of this kind of unprofitable war, propoſed to the prince to
retire to Gualiêr, where the Mahrattors had now eſtabliſhed a
government, promiſing to give him a tract of country for his maintenance. 
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0828000202:374"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1759.</note>Ali Gohar thanked the
Mahrattor for his generous propoſal, but declined to accept of it.</p>
               <p>His eyes were now turned to another quarter. Nigib ul Dowla, who
had, at the king's requeſt, betrayed Ghazi ul Dien to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalla, was, upon the
reinſtatement of the vizier in his office, obliged to fly to his jagier of
Secundra, between the rivers, about forty crores below Delhi. The prince looked
upon him as the moſt proper perſon to conduct his affairs. He accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
took leave of Ittul Raw, croſſed the Jumna, arrived at Secundra, and was
received with great reſpect by Nigib ul Dowla, who, however, did not think
proper to join heartily in his cauſe.</p>
               <p>To return to the tranſactions at Delhi: Ahmet Abdalla had no
ſooner ſettled his affairs, than he prepared for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other expedition into
Hindoſtan. He reſolved to ſupport his army with the plunder of that
country, and to keep them in action there for other enterprizes more arduous.
He accordingly marched from Candahar, and, in the month of Ribbi ul awil, 1174,
arrived in the environs of Delhi. The unhappy Allumgire applied to him for
relief; and, if poſſible, exaggerated his own miſfortunes, and the
unheard of villainies of his vizier. He, at the ſame time, by his
emiſſaries, ſtirred up factions in the army of Ghazi, who had marched out
of the city to give battle to Abdalla. The diſcerning mind of that miniſter
ſoon penetrated into the king's machinations againſt him. He did not for a
moment heſitate what to do; his hands had already been imbrued in blood, and
he ſtarted not at murder. He reſolved to take off the king, and then to let
future events direct his line of action.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0828000202:375"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A.D. 1760.</note>Though the king was in ſome
meaſure a priſoner, he was permitted to keep his guards and a great retinue
of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. They pitied his misfortunes, and became firmly attached to his
intereſt. Abdalla, who was near with his army, ſeemed to give ſome
encouragement to Allumgire, and that prince's party acquired ſtrength every
day. The vizier ſaw himſelf hemmed in upon all ſides by enemies; he,
therefore, thought it high time to aſſaſſinate his maſter.—He
knew the weakneſs and ſuperſtition of the mind of Allumgire. He,
therefore, trumped up a ſtory concerning a Fakier, who propheſied and
wrought miracles at the Kottulah of Feroſe Shaw. The poor enthuſiaſtic
king, juſt as Ghazi expected, expreſſed a great deſire to ſee the
holy Fakier. As it would derogate from the reputation of the pretended ſaint,
to pay a viſit, even to a king; Allumgire reſolved to confer upon him that
piece of reſpect.—But he had no ſooner entered the apartment where
the holy impoſtor ſat, than two aſſaſſins ſtarted from behind a
curtain, cut off his head with a ſcimiter, and threw his body, out of a back
window, upon the ſands of the Jumna. It lay there two days without interment;
none daring to pay the laſt office to the remains of their unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate king.
This tragedy was acted at Delhi, in the month of Ribbi ul Sani, 1174.</p>
               <p>Such was the end of Allumgire, who, in an age of peace and
tranquillity, might have lived with ſome reputation, and have died with the
character of a ſaint. But the times required uncommon abilities in a king,
and the moſt vigorous exertion of the manly faculties of the ſoul; neither
of which that unhappy monarch in any degree poſſeſſed. His ſtruggles,
therefore, againſt the ambition of Ghazi, were puerile and impotent. Had he
employed the aſſaſſin againſt the breaſt of that treacherous
mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, juſtice would have warranted the blow; had he poſſeſſed 
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0828000202:376"/>

his own hand, a thouſand oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities were not wanting. What then can be
ſaid in favor of a man, who durſt not make one manly effort for his
authority, or reſent indignities which he daily received in perſon?</p>
               <p>The perfidious vizier ordered the body of the king, after lying
two days expoſed on the ſand of the Jumna, to be privately interred. He
then took another prince of the blood, and placed him upon the throne, by the
name of Shaw Jehan.</p>

ſome time before the aſſaſſination of Allumgire, made up matters with
the vizier, had the addreſs to retain the office of buckſhi. Shocked at the
villainy of Ghazi, or deſirous to transfer to himſelf the whole power, he
again betrayed that miniſter, and went over with all his forces to Abdalla.
Ghazi, in conſequence of this deſertion, found himſelf obliged alſo to
make peace with the invader.</p>
               <p>Theſe factions proved fatal to the unhappy Delhians. Abdalla
laid the city under heavy contributions, and inforced the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection with
ſuch rigor and cruelty, that the unfortunate inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, driven to
deſpair, took up arms. The Perſian ordered a general maſſacre, which,

Durannies<note n="*" place="bottom">The tribe, of which Abdalla is the chief, are
diſtinguiſhed by that name.</note> were not even then glutted with
ſlaughter, but the ſtench of the dead bodies drove them out of the city. A
great part of the buildings were, at the ſame time, reduced to aſhes, and
many thouſands, who had eſcaped the ſword, ſuffered a lingering death
by famine, ſitting upon the ſmoaking ruins of their own houſes. Thus the
imperial city of Delhi, which, in the days of its glory, extended itſelf

unfortunate Delhians were not yet at an end. The Mahrattors, who now, without
intermiſſion, traverſed the empire for plunder, advanced to partake of
the ſpoils of Delhi with Abdalla. Jincow and Malharraw, accordingly, occupied
the environs of the city. The Perſian marched but againſt them, and both
armies joined battle at a place called Mudgenu Tuckia, two crores from the
depopulated capital. The Mahrattors were defeated, and purſued one hundred
and fifty crores from the field: but they, in the mean time, gave Abdalla the
ſlip, turned his rear, and ſet out in full march for Delhi. The Durannies,
however, were ſo cloſe to their heels, that, before they could attempt any
thing againſt the city, they were a ſecond time obliged to retreat.</p>
               <p>In the mean time news arrived, that the Mahrattor chiefs were
advancing with another very numerous army from the Decan, with a profeſſed
deſign to re-eſtabliſh the ancient Hindoo government. Biſſwaſs Raw,
Baow, and Ibrahim Chan Ghardi, commanded this force, which, independent of the
army of Mahrattors, whom Abdalla had already defeated, conſiſted of one
hundred thouſand horſe. The Mahommedans were ſtruck with terror; they
thought it neceſſary to join Abdalla, to ſupport the faith: Suja ul
Dowlat, who had ſucceeded his father, the infamous Seifdar Jung, in the
province of Oud, Ahmed Chan Bunguiſh, chief of the Patans and all the petty
chieftains of the Rohillas, haſtened with their forces to Delhi.</p>
               <p>The Mahrattors had now entered the territories of the Jates, and
ſummoned Raja Sourage Mull to join them. Though Sourage Mull, as a Hindoo,
wiſhed for the extirpation of Mahommediſm in India, he was too jealous of
the power of the Mahrattors, to obey their orders. Enraged at his obſtinacy, 
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0828000202:379"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1761.</note>they carried fire and
ſword through his dominions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him at laſt to join them with fifty
thouſand men.</p>
               <p>The Maharattors now conſiſted of two hundred thouſand
horſe, and the Mahommedans, whom Ahmet Abdalla commanded in chief, of near
one hundred and fifty thouſand. The eyes of all India were now turned towards
the event of a war, upon which depended, whether the ſupreme power ſhould
remain with the Mahommedans, or revert again to the Hindoos. Upon the approach
of the Mahrattors, Abdalla evacuated Delhi, and, having croſſed the Jumna,
encamped on the oppoſite bank.</p>
               <p>The Mahrattors immediately entered the city, and filled every
quarter of it with devaſtation and death. Not content with robbing the
miſerable remains of Abdalla's cruelty of every thing they poſſeſſed,
they ſtripped all the males and females quite naked, and wantonly whipped
them before them along the ſtreets. Many now prayed for death, as the
greateſt bleſſing, and thanked the hand which inflicted the
wound.—Famine begun to rage among the unfortunate citizens to ſuch a
degree, that men fled from their deareſt friends, as from beaſts of prey,
for fear of being devoured. Many women devoured their own children, while
ſome mothers, of more humanity, were ſeen dead in the ſtreets, with
infants ſtill ſucking at their breaſts.—But let us now draw a veil
over this ſcene of horror.</p>
               <p>Ghazi ul Dien found, by this time, that Abdalla was become his
enemy, and inclined to the intereſts of Nigib ul Dowla. He therefore
endeavoured to make up matters with the Mahrattors, but his propoſals were
rejected. He then turned himſelf to the Raja of the Jates, who was in the
field an unwilling auxiliary to the Mahrattors, and perſuaded him to deſert
their cauſe, and <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0828000202:380"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1761.</note>retire to his own country,
whither he himſelf accompanied him. Thus ended the public tranſactions of
Ghazi ul Dien, who crowded into a few years of early youth more crimes and
abilities, than other conſummate villains have done into a long life of
wickedneſs and treachery. Though he did not poſſeſs the Decan, the
fruits of his grandfather's uncommon crimes, he may truly be ſaid to have
been the genuine heir of the parts and treaſons of that monſter of iniquity
and villainy.</p>
               <p>The Mahrattors, when they entered Delhi, confined Shaw Jehan,
who had borne the title of royalty for a few weeks; and, to quiet the minds of
ſome Mahommedan omrahs, who aided them, raiſed to the throne Jewan Bucht,
the eldeſt ſon of prince Ali Gohar, who had by this time aſſumed the
title of Shaw Allum in Behar. But this young prince, had he even abilities to
reign, had now no ſubjects left to command; for he may be conſidered as the
image of a king, ſet up by way of inſult in the midſt of the ruins of his
capital.</p>
               <p>Abdalla being informed of the deſertion of the Jates, was
extremely deſirous of repaſſing the Jumna, and to come to battle with the
Mahrattors. He, for this purpoſe, marched up along the bank oppoſite to the
enemy, to Kungipurra, a place of ſome ſtrength, poſſeſſed by
Nizabat Chan, an independent Rohilla chief. The Perſian ſummoned him to
ſurrender, which he refuſed, and the place was conſequently taken by
aſſault, and the garriſon and inhabitants put to the ſword.—The
Mahrattors, at the ſame time, marched up upon the ſide of Delhi, and, too
confident of their own ſtrength, permitted Abdalla, without oppoſition, to
croſs the Jumna, by the ford of Ramra: but obſerving him more bold in his
motions than they expected, they became ſomewhat afraid, and intrenched
themſelves at <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0828000202:381"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1761.</note>Karnâl, in the very
ſame ground which was occupied formerly by Mahummud Shaw, while Abdalla
choſe the more fortunate ſituation of Nadir Shaw.</p>
               <p>Both armies lay in their entrenchments, for twelve days,
ſkirmiſhing at times with ſmall parties. Abdalla, in the mean time, found
means to cut off ſome Mahrattor convoys, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and, by the
vigilance and activity of his Durannies, to prevent all ſupplies from coming
to the enemy's camp.—As famine began to rage among the Mahrattors, they
were neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to march out of their lines, upon the 20th of Jemmad ul
Sani, 1174, and to offer battle to Abdalla, which he immediately accepted. The
firſt ſhock was extremely violent: the Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rattors advanced with great
reſolution, and charged Abdalla ſword in hand with ſuch vigor, that he
was upon the point of being driven off the field, when Suja ul Dowlat, well
known to the Britiſh in India, and Ahmed Chan Bunguiſh, the Patan chief of
Doab, fell upon the flank of the Mahrattors, with ten thouſand
horſe.—This circumſtance immediately turned the ſcale of victory.
Abdalla recovered from his confuſion, renewed the charge, and drove back the
enemy. Should we credit common report, fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Mahrattors fell in
this action, and in the purſuit: but be that as it will, the battle was
extremely bloody, for all the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of the vanquiſhed, excepting Malhar
Raw, who fled upon the firſt charge, were ſlain.</p>
               <p>Abdalla, after having purſued the Mahrattors for the ſpace
of three days, returned to Delhi. He wrote from thence letters to prince Ali
Gohar, who had proclaimed himſelf king in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Behar, under the
title of Shaw Allum, requeſting him to return to Delhi, and to take upon him
the management of the affairs of government. Shaw Allum was too prudent to 
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0828000202:382"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1761.</note>truſt himſelf in the
hands of Abdalla, and therefore that prince, whoſe affairs on the ſide of
Perſia required his preſence, confirmed Jewan Bucht<note n="*" place="bottom">The preſent emperor's eldeſt ſon.</note> upon the throne of
Delhi, under the tuition of Nigib ul Dowla, from whom he exacted an annual
tribute. Abdalla, after theſe tranſactions, returned to Cabul.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had Abdalla evacuated Delhi, than the Jates
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced hoſtilities againſt Nigib ul Dowla. They ſeized upon Camgar
Chan, Zemindâr of Ferochagur, and appropriated to themſelves his wealth
and territory. The miniſter, upon this, took the field. The Jates advanced
againſt him, with a great army, under the conduct of their chief, Raja
Sourage Mull. The Jates being much ſuperior to the force of Nigib ul Dowla,
became confident of ſucceſs; ſo that, when the armies approached within a
few miles of one another, near Secundra, the Raja went careleſsly out, with
ſome of his officers, upon a hunting party. Nigib ul Dowla, being informed of
this circumſtance by means of his ſpies, immediately detached a party of
five hundred horſe, under Seidu, a bold partizan, in queſt of the Raja.</p>
               <p>Seidu fell in with Sourage Mull, whoſe party conſiſted of
about three hundred. They engaged ſword in hand, with great reſolution on
both ſides; but, at length, the Jates were cut off to a man, and the Raja's
head was brought to Nigib ul Dowla, who was then upon his march to attack the
enemy. The unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected appearance of Nigib, in the abſence of their prince
and beſt officers, ſtruck the Jates with univerſal panic; when, at that
very inſtant, a horſeman advancing at full ſpeed, threw the Raja's head
into their line. This circumſtance compleated their confuſion, ſo that
Nigib ul Dowla defeated them with eaſe, and purſued them, ſword in hand,
ſome crores from the field of battle.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0828000202:83"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1762.</note>The miniſter, after this
victory, returned to Delhi. But he had not long remained in that capital,
before Joahir Singh, the ſon and ſucceſſor of Sourage Mull, hired
twenty thouſand Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rattors, under Malhar Raw, and advanced with all his
forces to Delhi. Nigib ul Dowla was not capable to cope with the Jates and
their auxiliaries in the field. He ſhut himſelf up in the city, where he
was beſieged for three months, and at laſt reduced to great diſtreſs.
However, a handſome preſent to Malhar Raw ſaved him upon this critical
occaſion. The Jates, finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves betrayed by their mercenaries,
were obliged to patch up a peace, and retire into their own country. Theſe
tranſactions happened in the year 1175 of the Higera. Nigib ul Dowla has been
ſince frequently attacked by the Jates to the eaſt, and the Seiks to the
weſt, but he ſtill maintains his ground with great reſolution and
ability.</p>
               <p>But to return to the adventures of the prince Ali Gohar, who,
under the title of emperor, now reigns in the ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Allahabad:
we have already obſerved, that he, after parting with the Mahrattors, threw
himſelf upon Nigib ul Dowla at Secundra. He could not, however, prevail upon
that Omrah to take up arms in his favor, He, therefore, left Secundra, with a
ſmall retinue of ſervants, who lived at their own expence, in hopes of
better days, with their prince. With theſe he arrived at Lucknow, one of the
principal cities of the province of Oud, where Suja ul Dowlat kept then his
court. Suja ul Dowlat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the king with ſeeming great reſpect, and
paid him royal honors; but this was only the falſe politeneſs of an Indian
court; which is always leſs deficient in ceremony than in ſaith. It was not
the intereſt of Suja ul Dowlat, who, by the villainies of his father, the
infamous Seifdar Jung, had become an independent prince, to revive the power of
the empire, he therefore declined <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0828000202:384"/> all connection with the
affairs of Ali Gohar. He, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, made him a Naſir of ſome elephants,
horſes, and half a lack of roupees in money, and inſinuated to him, to
leave his court.</p>
               <p>Ali Gohar, in this diſtreſſed ſituation, turned towards
Alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habad. Mahummud Kuli Chan, at that time, poſſeſſed that city and
province. Mahummud received the prince with friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as well as reſpect;
for being a man of an enterprizing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, he entertained great hopes of
raiſing himſelf with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of the Shaw Zadda<note n="*" place="bottom">Shaw Zadda literally ſignifies the king's ſon: a title by
which Ali Gohar was diſtinguiſhed during the life of his father Allumgire
Sani.</note>. After maturely deliberating upon the plan of their future
operations, it was reſolved, that, inſtead of relieving the unfortunate
Allumgire from the tyranny of Ghazi at Delhi, they ſhould endeavor to
poſſeſſ themſelves of the provinces of Bengal and Behar, the revenues
of which might enable them to ſupport a ſufficient army to reſtore the
power of the empire. Though the Shaw Zadda was the undoubted heir of the
empire, yet, to take away every pretence of right from Jaffier Ali Chan, whom
the Britiſh, on account of his villainies, had raiſed to the government of
Bengal, he obtained a private grant of the ſubaſhips of the three provinces
from his father at Delhi.</p>
               <p>Every thing being now concerted, public orders were iſſued
to the neighbouring rajas and ſogedars, to repair to the ſtandard of the
Shaw Zadda; while Mahummud Kuli Chan raiſed all the troops of Allahabad.
Camgar Chan, one of the principal foge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars of Behar, Pulwan Singh, raja of
Budgepoor, Bulbidder, raja of Amati, and many other, both Hindoo and Mahomedan 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0828000202:385"/> chiefs, obeyed the ſummons, and joined the prince.
Soldiers of fortune, in the mean time, ſtocked to him from all quarters, ſo
that Ali Gohar found himſelf ſoon at the head of ſixty thouſand
men.</p>
               <p>In the month of Ribbi ul Sani, of the year 1173, the Shaw Zadda
marched from Allahabad towards Bengal. The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of this war are well
known. Let it ſuffice to mention here, that the prince was unſucceſsful
in all his attempts upon Bengal; and was, at laſt, obliged to ſurrender
himſelf to the commander of the Britiſh forces, at Geiah in Behar. He
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived intelligence, ſoon after, of the aſſaſſination of his
father at Delhi. He was accordingly proclaimed emperor at Patna; but nothing
being done for him, by the Britiſh, the unfortunate prince found himſelf
obliged to throw himſelf into the hands of Suja ul Dowlat, who, in the
abſence of Kuli Chan, had ſeized upon the province of Allahabad. The
villainy of Suja ul Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat did not reſt there: he invited Kuli Chan to a
conference, and baſely aſſaſſinated him.</p>
               <p>Suja ul Dowlat, having poſſeſſed himſelf of the king's
perſon, cloſely confined him. He, at the ſame time, mocked the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
man with a farce of royalty, and obliged him to ratify all grants and
commiſſions, which might ſerve his own purpoſes. Under the ſanction
of theſe extorted deeds, Suja ul Dowlat made war upon the neighboring
ſtates, in which, however, he was not very ſucceſsful. When Caſſim
Ali Chan was driven from the ſubaſhip of Bengal, Suja ul Dowlat joined him,
in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his government. He was defeated at Buxar, by the
Britiſh, and the king being, in his flight, left behind him, threw himſelf
a ſecond time under our protection.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0828000202:386"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1764.</note>He hoped, now, that as Suja
ul Dowlat's dominions fell into the hands of the Britiſh, in conſequence of
this victory, that they would confer them upon him. But the unfortunate prince
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himſelf. He had no money, and conſequently had no friends. Suja
ul Dowlat was ſtill poſſeſſed of wealth: and the virtue of the
conquerors was by no means proof againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. They reſtored to him
his dominions, and, by a mere mockery of terms, called injuſtice by the name
of generoſity. A ſmall part of the province of Allahabad was allotted to
the king, for a ſubſiſtence, and the infamous ſon of a ſtill more
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Perſian pedlar enjoys the extenſive province of Oud, as a reward
for a ſeries of uncommon villainies.—But the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the
BRITISH SUBAS in India, will furniſh materials for a diſtinct hiſtory. We
ſhall not, therefore, break in upon that ſubject in this place; as to
mention them ſlightly would be, in ſome meaſure, detracting from the
fame, which thoſe GREAT MEN have ſo juſtly acquired.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1764.</note>THE ſhort ſketch which
we have given in the preceding ſections, of the Hiſtory of Hindoſtan, may
ſerve to throw light on the decline of the great empire of the Moguls in that
part of the world. We ſaw it gradually ſhrinking into itſelf, till the
race of Timur are, at laſt, confined within the narrow limits of an
inſignificant province. It muſt, however, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that the uncommon
miſfortunes of that family, proceeded no leſs from their own weakneſs,
than from the villainy of their ſervants. Had a man of parts ſucceeded the
debility of Mahum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud Shaw's government, the ancient glory of the empire might
have been ſtill reſtored. The revolted ſubas were not, then, well
eſtabliſhed in their independence; and the gallant reſiſtance which
Abdalla met with, in the reign of Ahmed, ſhewed that the Moguls could ſtill
defend themſelves from foreign invaſions.</p>
               <p>This, like other great ſtates, fell into pieces, more by
do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic factions, than by foreign arms. Even the miniſters of the
unfortunate Mahummud were men of parts; thoſe who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the affairs of
Ahmed were poſſeſſed of great abilities; and, in the reign of Allumgire
Sani, young Ghazi diſplayed an uncommon and enterprizing genius. But virtue
had fled from the land: no principle of honor, patriotiſm, or loyalty,
remained; great abilities produced nothing but great crimes; and the eyes of
individuals being wholly intent upon private advantage, the affairs of the
public fell into ruin and confuſion.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0828000202:388"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1764.</note>As from the ruins of the
extenſive empire of the Moguls, many independent governments have ſtarted
up of late years, it may not be improper, in this place, to take a curſory
view of the preſent ſtate of Hindoſtan. To begin with the northern
provinces. We have already obſerved, that Candahar, Cabul, Ghizni,
Piſhawir, with a part of Moultan and Sind, are under the dominion of Ahmet
Abdalla. That prince poſſeſſes alſo, upon the ſide of Perſia, the
greateſt part of Chorraſſân and Seiſtan, and all Bamia, on that
of Tartary. Abdalla, in ſhort, reigns over almoſt all the countries which,
formed the empire of Ghizni, before it deſcended from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of
Afganiſtân to Lahore and Delhi. It is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that, as Kerim
Chan has ſettled the weſtern Perſia, he may ſoon extend the empire to
its ancient boundaries towards the eaſt, and drive Abdalla into Hindoſtan;
ſo that a third dynaſty of kings of India may ariſe from among the
Afgans.</p>
               <p>The revenues of Abdalla are very conſiderable, amounting to
about three crores of roupees. But as he is always in the field, and maintains
an army of 100,000 horſe, to defend himſelf from the Perſians and
Tartars, he is in great diſtreſs for money. This circumſtance obliges
him, not only to oppreſs his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but alſo to carry his
depredations to foreign countries. During the competition of the ſeven
conſpirators for the throne of Perſia, Abdalla had little to fear from that
quarter. But as Kerim Chan has eſtabliſhed himſelf, by the defeat and
death of his rivals, it is extremely probable, that Abdalla will ſoon feel,
as we have already obſerved, the weight of his arms, as Chorraſſân
and Seiſtan are properly provinces of the Perſian empire.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0828000202:389"/> However, Abdalla is, at preſent, at
peace with Kerim, and has taken that favorable opportunity for invading
Hindoſtan. He had, in April 1767, defeated the Seiks in three different
actions, and advanced to Sirhind, about forty crores from Delhi, with an army
of fifty thouſand horſe. It is ſuppoſed that Nigib ul Dowla, who, in
the name of the preſent emperor's ſon, manages the affairs of Delhi, had,
as he himſelf was hard preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Seiks and Jates, called in
Abdalla, to take upon him the government. Nigib ul Dowla, by our beſt
intelligence, marched out of the city to meet his ally, with forty thouſand
men. The armies lay in fight of one another, and they were buſy in
negotiation, and in ſettling a plan for their future opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Abdalla, in
the mean time, wrote circular letters to all the princes of India, commanding
them to acknowledge him KING OF KINGS, and demanding a tribute. Suja ul Dowlat,
in particular, had received a very ſharp letter from him, upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him for
his alliance with INFIDELS, and demanding the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial revenues, which that
ſuba had converted to his own uſe for ſome years back.</p>
               <p>Such was the ſituation of the affairs of Ahmed Abdalla, by our
laſt accounts from Delhi. This prince is brave and active, but he is now in
the decline of life. His perſon is tall and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt, and inclinable to
being fat. His face is remarkably broad, his beard very black, and his
complexion moderately fair. His appearance, upon the whole, is majeſtic, and
expreſſive of an uncommon dignity and ſtrength of mind. Though he is not
ſo fierce and cruel as Nadir Shaw, he ſupports his authority with no leſs
rigor, and he is by no means leſs brave than that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary monarch. He,
in ſhort, is the moſt likely perſon now in India, to reſtore the
ancient power of the empire, ſhould he aſſume the title of king of
Delhi.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0828000202:390"/> The SEIKS border upon the Indian
dominions of Abdalla. That nation, it is ſaid, take their name of SEIKS,
which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies DISCIPLES, from their being followers of a certain
philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher of Thibet, who taught the idea of a commonwealth, and the pure
doctrine of Deiſm, without any mixture of either the Mahommedan or Hindoo
ſuperſtitions. They made their firſt appearance about the commencement of
this century, in the reign of Bahadar Shaw, but were rather reckoned then a
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſect than a nation. Since the empire began to decline, they
have prodigiouſly increaſed their numbers, by admitting proſelytes of all
religions, without any other ceremony than an oath, which they tender to them,
to oppoſe monarchy.</p>
               <p>The Seiks are, at preſent, divided into ſeveral ſtates,
which in their internal government are perfectly independent of one another,
but they form a powerful alliance againſt their neighbors. When they are
threatened with invaſions, an aſſembly of the ſtates is called, and a
general choſen by them, to lead their reſpective quotas of militia into the
field; but, as ſoon as peace is reſtored, the power of this kind of
dictator ceaſes, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, in a private capacity, to his own
community. The Seiks are now in poſſeſſion of the whole province of
Punjâb, the greateſt part of Moultan and Sind, both the banks of the
Indus from Caſhmire to Tatta, and all the country towards Delhi, from Lahore
to Sirhind. They have, of late years, been a great check upon the arms of
Abdalla; and, though in the courſe of the laſt year they have been
unſucceſsful againſt that prince in three actions, they are, by no means
ſubdued, but continue a ſevere clog upon his ambitious views in India.</p>
               <p>The chief who leads at preſent the army of the Seiks, is
Jeſſarit Singh; there is alſo one Nitteh Singh, who is in great 
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0828000202:391"/> eſteem among them. They can, upon an emergency,
muſter 60000 good horſe; but, though in India they are eſteemed brave,
they chuſe rather to carry on their wars by ſurprize and ſtratagem, than
by regular operations in the field. By their principles of religion and
government, as well as on account of national injuries, they are inveterate
enemies to Abdalla, and to the Rohilla powers.</p>
               <p>To the eaſt of the dominions of the republic of the Seiks lie
the countries which are poſſeſſed by the Rohilla Afgans. Nigib ul
Dowla, whoſe hiſtory is comprehended in the preceding ſections, is, from
his power, as well as from the ſtrength of his councils and his own bravery,
reckoned their prince. He poſſeſſes the city of Delhi, in the name of
the family of Timur, together with a conſiderable territory around it, on
both the banks of the Jumna, and his revenues amount to one crore of roupees.
He publickly acknowledges the unfortunate Shaw Allum, at Allahabad, king, and
allows a penſion to his ſon Jewan Bucht, who, without any power, maintains
a kind of regal dignity at Delhi.</p>
               <p>Nigib ul Dowla has been known, when hard preſſed by his
hoſtile neighbors, to raiſe 60000 horſe; but his revenues are not
ſufficient to ſupport one tenth part of that number. He continues to take
the held under the name of buckſhi, or captain-general of the Mogul empire;
and though he has not the power, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the inclination, to aſſiſt
the king, he keeps up a friendly correſpondence with him, and, without any
neceſſity, proſeſſes obedience and a ſhew of loyalty.</p>
               <p>Beſides Nigib ul Dowla, there are chiefs of the Rohilla race,
who are perfectly independent; but when danger preſſes, they unite with him
their forces. The moſt reſpectable of theſe chiefs <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0828000202:392"/>
is Haſiz Rhimut, who poſſeſſes a conſiderable diſtrict between
the rivers. The next to him, in power, is Doondi Chan; and with him we may
number Mutta Huſſein, Jacob Ali Chan, Fatte Chan Zurein, and others of
leſs note, who command inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent tribes beyond the Ganges to the north of
Delhi.</p>
               <p>The whole power of the Rohillas may amount to 100,000 horſe,
and an equal number of infantry, upon an emergency; but theſe are ſo
wretchedly appointed and ill paid, that they furniſh more of ridicule, than
they can impreſs of terror in the field. Their infantry are armed with
rockets, pointed with iron, which they diſcharge in vollies among cavalry,
which frighten more with their noiſe and uncommon appearance, than by the
execution which they make. The Rohillas are remarkable for nothing more than
their natural antipathy to the Mahrattors, which might be turned to advantage
by the Britiſh in their future views upon Hindoſtan: but the truth is, that
the Hindoos and Mahommedans ſo equally ballance one another in that country,
that by ſupporting one, we may, with great facility, command both.</p>
               <p>There is a ſmall government of the Patans to the eaſt of the
Rohilla tribes. Their diſtrict is bounded by the dominions of the preſent
king, by thoſe of Suja ul Dowlat, and by the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Jates. The
capital of this petty principality is Fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabad, which is ſituated upon the
banks of the Ganges, a few crores above the ruins of the celebrated city of
Kinnoge. Ahmed Chan Bunguiſh, who made a great figure againſt Seifdar Jung,
the father of Suja ul Dowlat, rules over this diſtrict. Ahmed is more
diſtinguiſhed by his abilities and perſonal bravery, than by the extent
of his power. His revenues do not exceed fifty lacks; but he always keeps a
ſtanding force of two or three thouſand <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0828000202:393"/> good horſe,
which he pays well; and, upon an emergency, he raiſes all his vaſſals,
who conſiſt of about 20000 men. His country is full of forts; and he has,
conſequently, been hitherto able to defend himſelf againſt the
Mahrattors, Jates, and Suja ul Dowlat, who have reſpectively invaded his
dominions.</p>
               <p>The city of Agra, and a very conſiderable tract of country
round it, extending along the Jumna, from forty crores below that city to
within five of Delhi, and ſtretching back to Gualier and Barampulla, are now
in the hands of a Hindoo nation, called the Jates. The raja who, commands the
Jates, is deſcended of the ancient race of the Jits, who poſſeſſed
the banks of the Indus, as far back as the reign of Sultan Mahmood of Ghizni.
From their prince, the whole body of the Jates, though made up of many
diſtinct tribes and ſects, take their name; but others, with leſs
probability, trace it to JATE, which in the Hindoo language ſignifies a
labourer.</p>
               <p>The Jates made no figure in the Mogul empire, as a nation, till
the reign of Allumgire, commonly known in Europe by the name of Aurungzebe. In
that monarch's expedition to the Decan, they were firſt heard of as a gang of
banditti, under an intrepid fellow, called Chura Mun. They were then ſo
daring as to harraſs the rear of the imperial army. After the death of
Allumgire, the Jates took advantage of the growing imbecility of the empire,
and fortifying themſelves among the hills of Narvar, ſpread their
depredations to the gates of Agra. Mokun Singh, who, after the death of Chura
Mun, commanded the Jates, took upon himſelf the title of Raja. Their power
increaſed under Bodun Singh and Sourage Mull, which laſt was dignified with
titles from the emperor.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0828000202:394"/> Joahir Singh, the ſon of Sourage Mull,
now reigns over the Jates, and is a very weak prince. His revenues do not
exceed two crores of roupees; his dominions, like the reſt of India, being
harraſſed by the Mahrattors. He may, upon ſome occaſions, be able to
bring into the field ſixty or ſeventy thouſand men, but he cannot keep
long in pay one third of that number. The dominions of the Jates abound with
ſtrong fortreſſes, ſuch as Dieg, Cumbere, and Aliver; in one of which
their prince frequently reſides, though he ſpends the moſt part of his
time at Agra.</p>
               <p>To the ſouth-weſt of the Jates, Mudoo Singh, a rajaput raja,
poſſeſſes a very conſiderable territory, and reſides for the moſt
part at Joinagur. He is the ſon of Joy Singh, a prince famous for his
knowledge in aſtronomy, and other mathematical ſciences. He entertained
above a thouſand learned brahmins for ſome years, in rectifying the
kalendar, and in making new tables for the calculation of eclipſes, and for
determining the longitude and declination of the ſtars.—The revenues of
Mudoo Singh are not very conſiderable, being reckoned only eighty lacks; his
domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions being woody, mountainous, and conſequently ill cultivated. He can,
however, raiſe forty thouſand men; and he himſelf is eſteemed a good
ſoldier.</p>
               <p>Bordering upon Mudoo Singh, upon the frontiers of the Decan, is
the extenſive country of Marwar, ruled, at preſent, by Bija Singh, the
ſon of Bucht Singh, and grandſon of Jeſſawind Singh. Marwar, when the
empire was in a flouriſhing condition, yielded annually five crores of
roupees: at preſent its revenues do not amount to half that ſum, on account
of the inceſſant depredations of the Mahrattors, its next neighbours.</p>
               <p>The next Hindoo government to Marwar, is that of Odipour. The
raja of this country is diſtinguiſhed by the name of Rana. 
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0828000202:395"/> That prince, more from his nobility of family than from
his power, aſſumes a ſuperiority over all the rajas of Hindoſtan. His
dominions were formerly very extenſive, but, of late years, they have been
circumſcribed within narrower bounds. His territories abound with mountains
and foreſts, and are almoſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the kingdoms of Malava and
Guzerat. His revenues are inconſiderable, and he cannot bring into the field
above fifteen thouſand men.—In the vallies between the mountains of
Odipour, there are many petty independent rajas; Bundi, Cottu, Rupnagur,
Jeſſelmere, and Bianere, being governed by their reſpective princes, each
of whom can muſter ſix or eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men.</p>
               <p>The Mahrattors are the moſt conſiderable Hindoo power in
Hindoſtan. The principal ſeat of their government is Sattarah, and
ſometimes Puna, on the coaſt towards Bombay. Though the genuine Mahrattors
all over India do not exceed 60000 men, yet, from their ſuperior bravery and
ſucceſs in depredation, thouſands of all tribes enliſt themſelves
under their banners. Theſe, inſtead of pay, receive a certain proportion of
the plunder. By this means an army of Mahrattors increaſes like a river, the
farther it advances; ſo that it is no uncommon thing for a force of ten or
twelve thouſand genuine Mahrattors to grow into 100,000, before they arrive
in the place which they deſtine to plunder.</p>
               <p>The preſent chief of the Mahrattors is Ragenot Raw, the ſon
of Bagiraw. He poſſeſſes one half of Guzerat, and all the territories
between that province and the Decan. He has, of late years, extended his
conqueſts to all the provinces of Malava, and to a part of Allahabad; having
reduced Himmut Singh, raja of Gualier, Anarid Singh, raja of Badawir, Anarid
Singh, of Chunderi, and the princes of Dittea, Orcha, Elichpoor, Bandere, 
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0828000202:396"/> and Jaſſey; all of whom have become tributary to the
Mahrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. They have, moreover, poſſeſſed themſelves of Oriſſa,
which ought, in propriety, to be annexed to the ſubaſhip of Bengal,
according to the late grant of the king to the Britiſh. Thus the dominions of
the Mahrattors extend quite acroſs the peninſula of India, from the bay of
Bengal to the gulph of Cambait or Cambay.</p>
               <p>The amount of the revenues of the Mahrattors cannot eaſily be
aſcertained. They muſt, however, be very conſiderable. They ſubſiſt
their armies by depredations on their neighbors, and are become the terror of
the Eaſt, more on account of their barbarity than their valour. They never
want a pretence for hoſtilities. They demand the Chout, or fourth part of the
reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of any province; and, in caſe of a refuſal, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade,
plunder, and lay waſte the country. Their horſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very hardy, their
incurſions are ſudden, unexpected, and dreadful. They generally appoint a
place of rendezvous, and their invaſions are carried on by detached parties.
Should a conſiderable force at any time oppoſe them, they decline coming to
action; and, as they invigorate their hardy horſes with opium, their flight,
like their incurſions, is very expeditious.</p>
               <p>The armies of the Mahrattors do not, like the troops of other
Indian powers, incumber themſelves with bazars or markets. They truſt for
their ſubſiſtence to the countries through which they march. They are
armed with firelocks, ſome with match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock guns, and others with bows,
ſpears, javelins, ſwords and dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. They have, within three years back,
made ſome advances towards forming a diſciplined army of infantry. They
have, accordingly, at preſent, ten or twelve battalions of Seapoys, uniformly
cloathed and armed.—All the powers of India being now ſenſible of the
advantages which the Britiſh have gained by diſciplined infantry, turn
their thoughts to a ſimilar regulation in <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0828000202:397"/> their armies,
and to improve their artillery, which was formerly too unweildy and
ill-mounted, to be of any ſervice in the field.</p>
               <p>To the eaſt of Malava, and to the ſouth of Allahabad, is the
country of Bundelcund, governed by Hindoput. His territories are of a
conſiderable extent and very fertile, and he moreover draws great wealth from
his diamond mines of Hieragur and Punagur. He alſo claims a right to the
mines of Sommelpour, but another raja poſſeſſes them at
preſent.—The annual revenues of Hindoput amount to near two crores of
roupees, including the profits ariſing from his mines. Theſe he farms out
to merchant-adventurers, who purchaſe a certain number of ſuperficial feet
of ground, and they are permitted to dig down perpendicularly as far as they
pleaſe. Diamonds beyond a certain weight are the property of the prince, who
has inſpectors, to ſuperintend the works.</p>
               <p>The raja of Bundelcund poſſeſſes the impregnable
fortreſs of Callinger and ſeveral other conſiderable ſtrong holds. He
has, notwithſtanding, been obliged to compound for a certain tribute with the
Mahrattors, who generally paid him an annual viſit. Between Bundelcund and
Cattack, in Oriſſa, lie the rajaſhips of Patna and Sommelpour, which are
not very conſiderable; the country being mountainous, woody, and unhealthy,
and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants barbarous in every reſpect.</p>
               <p>Part of the province of Allahabad is now poſſeſſed by
SHAW ALLUM, by birthright and title, though nothing leſs ſo in power,
emperor of Hindoſtan. He keeps the poor reſemblance of a court at
Allahabad, where a few ruined Omrahs, in hopes of better days to their prince,
having expended their fortunes in his ſervice, ſtill exiſt the ragged
penſioners of his poverty, and burthen his gratitude with their preſence.
The diſtricts of Korah and Allahabad, in the king's poſſeſſion, are
rated at thirty <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0828000202:398"/> lacks, which is one half more than they
are able to bear. Inſtead of gaining by this bad policy, that prince,
unfortunate in many reſpects, has the mortification to ſee his poor
ſubjects oppreſſed by thoſe who farm the revenue, while he himſelf is
obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with the farmers for half the ſtipulated ſum.
Beſides the revenue ariſing from Allahabad and Korah, which we may at a
medium eſtimate at twelve lacks, the Britiſh pay to the king twenty-ſix
lacks out of the revenues of Bengal; which is all Shaw Allum poſſeſſes
to ſupport the dignity of the imperial houſe of Timur.—It may not,
perhaps, be unacceptable to the public, to delineate, in this place, the
character of that unfortunate prince.</p>
               <p>SHAW ALLUM is robuſt in his perſon, and about ſix feet
high. His complexion is rather darker than that which was common to the race of
Timur, and his countenance is expreſſive of that melancholy which naturally
aroſe from his many misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. He poſſeſſes perſonal courage;
but it is of the paſſive kind, and may be rather called fortitude to bear
adverſity, than that daring boldneſs which loves to face danger.—He
has been ſo often diſmounted in the courſe of ambition, that he now fears
to give it the rein; and ſeems leſs deſirous to make any efforts to
retrieve the power of his family, than to live quietly under the ſhadow of
its eclipſed majeſty.—His clemency borders upon weakneſs, and his
good nature has totally ſubverted his authority. He is daily induced, by
importunity, to iſſue out orders which he takes no means to inforce, and
which, he is certain, will not be obeyed. From this blemiſh in the character
of Shaw Allum, aroſe the half of his misfortunes; for the great ſecret of
eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing authority, is to give no orders which cannot be inforced, and
rather to ſuffer ſmall injuries, than ſhew reſentment, without the
power of puniſhing.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0828000202:399"/> His generoſity is more than equal to
his abilities, and, too often, ill beſtowed. He is too much addicted to
women, and takes more pains to maintain his Haram, than to ſupport an
army.—But though we cannot call him a great prince, we muſt allow him
to be a good man. His virtues are many; but they are thoſe of private life,
which never appear with luſtre upon a throne. His judgment is by no means
weak; but his paſſions are not ſtrong: the eaſineſs of his temper is
therefore moulded like wax by every hand; and he always gives up his own better
opinion for thoſe of men of inferior parts.—He is affable in his
converſation, but ſeldom deſcends to pleaſantry. Upon the whole, though
Shaw Allum is by no means qualified to reſtore a loſt empire, he might have
maintained it with dignity in proſperous times, and tranſmitted his name,
as a virtuous prince, to poſterity. It is with great regret that the author,
from his regard to truth, cannot ſpeak more favorably of a prince, to whom
his gratitude and attachment are due, for repeated teſtimonies of his
eſteem and friendſhip.</p>
               <p>The territories of Suja ul Dowlat, who poſſeſſes the
province of Oud, border upon thoſe of the king. His revenues amount to near
two crores of roupees, out of which he pays nothing to the emperor, though he
pretends to recognize his title as his ſovereign. Since his defeat at Buxar,
Suja ul Dowlat attends very much to the diſcipline of his army, and the
proper regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his finances. He has already formed ten battalions of
Seapoys, and has made great improvements in his artillery. When the news of
Abdalla's late invaſion came, he levied twelve thouſand horſe, upon a
better footing than is generally practiſed in Hindoſtan. He is now the ally
of the Britiſh in India, and as his revenues will never enable him to
ſupport himſelf in the field againſt them, it is probable his principle
of <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0828000202:400"/> fear, for he has none of honor or gratitude, will make
him ſtand to the letter of the treaty.</p>
               <p>Suja ul Dowlat is extremely handſome in his perſon; about
five feet eleven inches in height, and ſo nervous and ſtrong, that, with
one ſtroke of the ſabre, he can cut off the head of a buffalo. He is
active, paſſionate, ambitious; his penetrating eye ſeems, at firſt
ſight, to promiſe uncommon acuteneſs and fire of mind: but his genius is
too volatile for depth of thought; and he is conſequently more fit for the
manly exerciſes of the field, than for deliberation in the
cloſet.—Till of late he gave little atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to buſineſs. He was
up before the ſun, mounted his horſe, ruſhed into the foreſt, and
hunted down tigers or deer till the noon of day. He then returned, plunged into
the cold bath, and ſpent his afternoons in the Haram among his
women.—Such was the bias of Suja ul Dowlat's mind till the late war.
Ambitious without true policy, and intoxicated with the paſſions of youth,
he began a wild career, in which he was ſoon checked. Stung with the loſs
of reputation, his paſſions have taken another courſe. His activity is
employed in diſcipling his army, and he now ſpends more time at the
comptoir of his finances, than in dallying with the ladies of his ſeraglio.
His authority, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is eſtabliſhed, his revenues increaſed, and
his army on a reſpectable footing. But, with all his ſplendid qualities, he
is cruel, treacherous, unprincipled, deceitful: carrying a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
appearance, purpoſely to betray, and when he embraces with one hand, will
ſtab with the other to the heart. Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with being heir to the fruits of
his father's crimes, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herits all his latent baſeneſs of mind; for, if
we except perſonal courage, he poſſeſſes not one virtue more than
Seiſdar Jung.</p>
               <p>The province of Oud is ſituated to the north-eaſt of the
Ganges, bordering upon Behar, from which it is, on the one ſide, divided by
the river Deo, or Gagera, and on the other by <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0828000202:401"/> the
Carumnaſſa. The country is level, well cultivated and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. It is
divided, on the north, by a chain of mountains from Thibet. In the vallies,
which interſect that immenſe ridge of hills, there are ſeveral
independent rajas, too inconſiderable to be formidable to Suja ul Dowlat.</p>
               <p>The provinces of Bengal and Behar are poſſeſſed by the
Britiſh Eaſt-India company, in reality, by the right of arms, though, in
appearance, by a grant from the preſent emperor. This is not a proper place
to enter into particulars concerning thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces: it may ſuffice to
obſerve, that Bengal and Behar, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding what is called the company's lands
and duties upon mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, yielded in April, 1766, 33,025,968 Sicca,
roupees. The expences of government, the tribute to the king, and a penſion
to a nabob, ſet up on account of the villainies of his father, amounted to
22,450,000 roupees, and conſequently the ballance in favor of the company was
10,575,968 roupees, or 1,321,994l. 15s. of our money.—The Britiſh force
in Bengal conſiſts of three battalions of Europeans, and thirty of Seapoys,
regularly armed, diſciplined, and uniformly cloathed; ſo that we are much
ſuperior, even upon that eſtabliſhment, to any other power at preſent
in Hindoſtan.</p>
               <p>In the Decan the Britiſh are almoſt as powerful as in
Bengal. We ſupport Mahommed Ali, as nominal nabob of the Carnatic, while, in
fact, we govern the country without control, having the poſſeſſion of
the garriſons and the diſpoſal of the revenues. The power of the Nizam,
who reſides at Hydrabad, though he poſſeſſes all the province of
Golconda, is, of late, very much circumſcribed. He, however, ſtill
maintains an army of 60 or 70000 men; but without diſcipline, and ill paid
they are by no means formidable. He, ſome time ago, entered into a treaty
with the Britiſh, but he has, of late, ſhewn no diſpoſition to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to it long.</p>
               <p> 
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0828000202:402"/> Hydernaig, a ſoldier of fortune, who,
by his, perſonal merit, raiſed himſelf from a common Seapoy, to be
ſovereign of almoſt all the coaſt of Malabar, threatened, laſt year, to
attack the Nizam, if he did not break his unnatural alliance with the
Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh. The part which the Nizam will take upon this occaſion, will
entirely depend on the ſpirit of the councils of the Britiſh on the
coaſt.—As Hydernaig had alſo threatened Mahommed Ali, nabob of the
Carnatic, it was judged prudent to march an army againſt him in March, 1767;
but what ſucceſs may have attended the expedition, has not hitherto reached
Europe.</p>
               <p>Hydernaig is ſaid to have thirty diſciplined battalions of
Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poys, twenty thouſand good horſe, and a great train of artillery,
wrought by five hundred European renegadoes. This prince having ſerved in
perſon in European armies, models his troops upon their plan, pays
punctually, and enforces diſcipline with rigor. Together with being an able
politician, he is a daring, active, and impetuous ſoldier, and if he is not
immediately cruſhed, he may prove the moſt dangerous enemy that the
Britiſh have hitherto met with in the Eaſt. He is, at preſent, the moſt
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable prince in all India, and he will, no doubt, take advantage of the
divided ſtate of that country, and endeavor to extend his conqueſts.</p>
               <p>Thus have we, in a few words, endeavored to give a general idea
of the preſent ſtate of Hindoſtan. The reflexions which naturally ariſe
from the ſubject, might ſwell this work into a volume. It is apparent,
however, from what has been ſaid, that the immenſe regions of Hindoſtan
might be all reduced by a handful of regular troops.—Ten thouſand
European infantry, together with the Seapoys in the company's ſervice, are
not only ſufficient to conquer all India, but, with proper policy, to
main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, for ages, as an appendage of the Britiſh crown.—This
poſition may, at firſt ſight, appear a paradox, to people unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted 
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0828000202:403"/> with the genius and diſpoſition of the inhabitants of
Hindoſtan: but to thoſe who have conſidered both with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the
thing ſeems not only practicable, but eaſy.</p>
               <p>That ſlavery and oppreſſion, which the Indians ſuffer
from their native princes, make the juſtice and regularity of a Britiſh
go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment appear to them in the moſt favorable light. The great men of the
country have no more idea of patriotiſm, than the meaneſt ſlaves; and the
people can have no attachment to chiefs whom they regard as tyrants. Soldiers
of fortune are ſo numerous in India, that they comprehend one fourth of the
inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of that extenſive country. They are never paid one third of the
ſtipulated ſum, by the princes of Hindoſtan, which renders them mutinous
and diſcontented; but they would moſt certainly approve themſelves
obedient, faithful, and brave, in the ſervice of a power who ſhould pay
them regularly.</p>
               <p>In a country like India, where all religions are tolerated, the
people can have no objection to the Britiſh, on account of theirs. The army
might be compoſed of an equal number of Mahom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medans and Hindoos, who would
be a check upon one another, while a ſmall body of Europeans would be a
ſufficient check upon both. The battalions ought to be commanded altogether
by European officers, who, if they do their duty properly, and behave with
juſtice to their men, may attach them to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with ſtronger
ties than any troops born in Europe. But if juſtice is not obſerved to
ſoldiers, human nature, in this, as in all countries, will and muſt revolt
againſt oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>At preſent, the black officers of the Seapoys muſt riſe
from the ranks. This is ſound policy, and ought to be continued. Men of
family and influence are deterred, by this circumſtance, from entering into
the ſervice. Theſe officers are, therefore, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely our creatures, and
will never deſert a people, among whom <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0828000202:404"/> alone they can
have any power; for no acquired diſcipline will give weight to a mean man,
ſufficient to bring to the field an army of Indians.</p>
               <p>The advantages of a conqueſt of Hindoſtan to this country
are obvious. It would pay as much of the national debt, as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhould
pleaſe to diſcharge. Should the influx of wealth raiſe the price of the
neceſſaries and conveniences of life, the poor, on the other hand, by being
eaſed of moſt of their taxes, would be more able to purchaſe
them.—But, ſay ſome grave moraliſts, how can ſuch a ſcheme be
reconciled to juſtice and humanity?—This is an objection of no
weight.—Hindoſtan is, at preſent, torn to pieces by factions. All
laws, divine and human, are trampled under foot.—Inſtead of one tyrant,
as in the times of the empire, the country now groans under thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; and
the voice of the oppreſſed multitude reaches heaven. It would, therefore,
be promoting the cauſe of juſtice and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, to pull thoſe petty
tyrants from the height to which their villainies have raiſed them, and to
give to ſo many millions of mankind, a government founded upon the principles
of virtue and juſtice.—The taſk is no leſs glorious than it is
prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable; for it might be accompliſhed with half the blood which is often
expended, in Europe, upon an ideal ſyſtem of a ballance of power, and in
commercial wars, which muſt be attended with little eclat, as they are
deſtitute of ſtriking and beneficial conſequences.</p>
