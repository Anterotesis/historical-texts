         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU did me honour by permitting me to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
to you my Tranſlation of your illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
work; and I am now proud to exerciſe the
privilege you ſo politely conferred upon me. The
important Information it contains, and the Eloquence
of its Compoſition, joined to the Ingenuity, Taſte, and
Erudition with which it every where abounds,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0195400701:4"/>
induced me to think that a Verſion of it into the
Engliſh language, by diffuſing the knowledge of
Nature, would increaſe the number of her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers.
The taſk, it muſt be acknowledged, was
arduous; but your approbation and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by redoubling my vigour, diminiſhed the
difficulty of the labour.</p>
            <p>It was with the livelieſt pleaſure that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
your Communications reſpecting the valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Performances you have already publiſhed,
and concerning thoſe undertakings which now
engage your attention and cares. I failed not to
announce to your friends in this country the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
which Science and Literature have yet
to expect from you; and I need hardly obſerve,
that their wiſhes and my own, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of your purpoſes, are in proportion to
the greatneſs of your talents.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſs which the Tranſlation met with,
when publiſhed ſeparately in volumes, I imputed
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0195400701:5"/>
to the celebrity of your name, and to the high
value of the original; and theſe cauſes, I truſt,
will juſtify my anxious attention in laying it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Public in its collected and more perfect
form.</p>
            <closer>I have the honour to be,
With the moſt entire reſpect,
<salute>SIR,</salute>
               <signed>Your moſt obedient, and
Moſt humble ſervant,

BY
THE TRANSLATOR.</head>
            <div type="section">
               <p>NATURAL HISTORY is the moſt extenſive,
and perhaps the moſt inſtructive and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
of all the ſciences. It is the chief
fource from which human knowledge is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
To recommend the ſtudy of it from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of utility, were to affront the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the reader. Its importance, accordingly,
in the arts of life, and in ſtoring the mind with
juſt ideas of external objects, as well as of their
relations to the human race, was early percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by all nations in their progreſs from rudeneſs
to refinement.</p>
               <p>But, notwithſtanding the great advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing
from the knowledge of Nature, Ariſtotle
is the only antient writer on ZOOLOGY who me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
attention. Inſtead of retailing fictions, or
facts founded upon ignorance and credulity, he
inveſtigated the relations and diſcrepances which
connect and diſtinguiſh the various tribes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals.
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0195400701:9"/>
What had been only a chaos of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached,
uncertain, and often fabulous narrations
and deſcriptions, he reduced into a ſcientific
form, with a ſucceſs ſo amazing, that, to this
hour, no ſyſtematic view of animated beings has
been attempted, the principles of which have
not been adopted from Ariſtotle's hiſtory of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
His analogies and diſtinctions are taken
not only from the inſtruments of motion, the
teeth, the eyes, the heart, or other external and
internal organs of the body, to which the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our modern methodiſts has been chiefly
confined, but from magnitude, figure, manners,
faculties and diſpoſitions of mind. He attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to arrange and define every known ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
This labour he left to men of leſs geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
and more patience. His work conſiſts entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of philoſophical diſſertations on the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſtructure, manners, and diſpoſitions of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;
and his particular facts are always employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſupport the principles which he is endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to eſtabliſh.</p>
               <p>Pliny and Aelian, though they had the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
example of Ariſtotle before them, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
nothing but crude collections, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
much taſte, judgment, or knowledge
of the ſubject.</p>
               <p>From this period, till the voluminous Geſner
and Aldrovandus appeared, the knowledge of
Nature, like other branches of literature, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in the general gloom of ignorance and
ſuperſtition. It was the object of theſe authors
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0195400701:10"/>
to amaſs every thing that had been ſaid of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
by poets, ſhepherds, grammarians, philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
phyſicians, and old women. Their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity,
of courſe, is inſufferable. Their labours,
however, may be regarded as rude quarries,
from which ſome valuable materials may be dug
up; but the expence of removing the rubbiſh
will, perhaps, overbalance their intrinſic value.</p>
               <p>In the ſame claſs, with little exception, may
be ranked, Wotton, Belon, Rondeletius, Salvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Johnſon, and a multitude of ſimilar writers.
They all tranſcribed, and ſometimes abridged,
the labours of their predeceſſors; but they uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
loſt ſight of philoſophy and ſcience.</p>
               <p>This race of phlegmatic writers was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by our celebrated countrymen Mr Ray
and Mr Willoughby, who were admirers of
Nature, and lamented the ſlovenly dreſs in which
ſhe had been generally exhibited. They
knew the value of her treaſures, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſhow them in their native brilliancy.
They rejected dubious and fictious relations.
They added, from obſervation and experiment,
many new facts: They arranged animals under
proper claſſes and ſubdiviſions: They deſcribed
with accuracy and preciſion: They pointed out
the importance of the ſcience, and recommended
the ſtudy of it by the ſolidity and clearneſs of
their views, and by the brevity and perſpicuity
of their compoſitions. This taſte continued ſome
time, and produced the works of Reaumur,
Trembley, Buffon, and ſimilar publications.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0195400701:11"/>
From beginnings ſo proſperous much was to
be expected. But the excellency of method was
no ſooner recogniſed, than the philoſophy of the
ſcience was nearly extinguiſhed by a profuſion
of new terms and arrangements. The juſtly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
Linnaeus, by perſevering induſtry, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the utility of his technical Dictionary<note n="*" place="bottom">Syſtema Naturae, which, with regard to quadrupeds, can be conſidered in no other light.</note>,
unfortunately turned the attention of moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts,
though contrary to the learned author's
deſign, from the great views of Nature to the
humble ambition of ſyſtem-making. It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to ſpecify examples. Every philoſopher
muſt have obſerved, with regret, that inundation
of methodical diſtributions which have ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
appeared during the courſe of theſe laſt
thirty or forty years. Since the publiſhing of
Linnaeus's works, the attention of Naturaliſts
has been principally occupied with criticiſing
former arrangements, and fabricating new ones.
The philoſophy of the ſcience has, of courſe,
been almoſt totally neglected. It has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
in its moſt forbidding aſpect, which has
limited the ſtudy of it to a few, and thoſe often
not of the moſt brilliant talents; for it has been
remarked, that the parade of learning, reſulting
from technical phraſes and definitions, allure
ſome men to become what is called <hi>great natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts,</hi>
whoſe chief knowledge of Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0195400701:12"/>
in the knack of being able to name, with
facility, a great number of her productions.</p>
               <p>This propenſity toward multiplying metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
diſtributions, and diſputing about their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
merits, has brought much obloquy on
the ſcience of Nature. Men of ſenſe perceive
the folly of diſcuſſions concerning the local ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of an animal in a book. They conſider
the authors as learned triflers; and, what is
worſe, they are apt to regard a ſubject, which
affords no better entertainment or information,
as barren and unprofitable. To no other ſource
are to be aſcribed the following ſentiments, ſo
frequently expreſſed by men of no inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
talents: 'That natural hiſtorians have ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
diſcovered extenſive views; that they
confine their chief attention to the mere tech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
part of the ſcience; that they rarely take
notice of manners and inſtincts, or the cauſes
and oeconomy of animal action; and that they
never purſue theſe great and uſeful objects
with a degree of taſte and philoſophical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy,
proportioned to the importance of the
ſubject.' Theſe ſtrictures are common: It were
to be wiſhed that they had no foundation in
truth.</p>
               <p>In natural hiſtory, two ends only can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by ſyſtem. Both of them are uſeful,
but extremely different in their kinds. Syſtem
may be employed either to facilitate the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0195400701:13"/>
of objects, or to aſcertain their relations in
the ſcale of being.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſpecies of ſyſtem, it is obvious, muſt
conſiſt entirely of a ſeries of external or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
characters. It is of little moment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the objects ranked under particular OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERS
be mutually connected; becauſe, if we
may judge from the many laborious, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortive
attempts which have been made, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſeems not to have expreſſed ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections
in characters recogniſable by our ſenſes.
A ſyſtem ſo limited in its principles and deſign,
can never aſſume any other form than that of a
technical index or dictionary. If the general
and particular characters be ſo marked, that a
ſtudent, after learning the diviſions and language
of the author, can inveſtigate the proper names
of the objects preſented to him, then is this ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem
perfect; becauſe its ſole and primary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Were every naturaliſt of the ſame ſentiments
with regard to this point, many incumbrances,
which now load the ſcience, would be removed;
the tyro would not be diſguſted and retarded by
an infinity of ſynonimes; natural hiſtory would
acquire a more ſimple and intelligible form; and
the number of its votaries would ſoon be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſpecies of ſyſtem is more elevated
and ſublime. But, as it includes the whole phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
of Nature, it requires a depth of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a ſuperiority of genius, an extent of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0195400701:14"/>
which are ſeldom united in the ſame
perſon. Natural objects are wonderfully diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified
in their ſtructure, oeconomy, and faculties.
But, in theſe, as well as in many other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
they are no leſs wonderfully connected.
Here, then, are foundations for conſtructing the
ſyſtem of Nature. To mark the diſtinctions,
to inveſtigate the relations, to aſcertain the great
chain that unites the numerous tribes which
people and adorn the univerſe, would demand
talents ſuperior, perhaps, to thoſe of humanity.
We ought not, however, to deſpair. Hardly
any bounds can be ſet to the combined force of
different minds acting ſucceſſively upon the ſame
ſubject. Something has already been done.
More may in time appear: Nature, in ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
period, may happily unite Philoſophy and
Natural Hiſtory, a phaenomenon which has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
been but partially exhibited.</p>
               <p>Among thoſe authors, whether antient or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
who have contributed to unfold the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
of Natural Hiſtory, the COUNT DE
BUFFON holds the moſt diſtinguiſhed rank.
This learned and eloquent writer has introduced
into his ſubjects a greater variety of diſquiſition,
and given more comprehenſive views of Nature,
than any preceeding or contemporary hiſtorian.
His facts are, in general, collected with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and fidelity; and his reaſonings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
are not only bold and ingenious, but
adorned with all the beauties of expreſſion, and
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0195400701:15"/>
all the charms of novelty. They every where
lead to reflections which are momentous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting.
They expand the mind and baniſh
prejudices. They create an elevation of thought,
and cheriſh an ardour of inquiry. They open
many great and delightful proſpects of the oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
of Nature, of the alterations and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
to which ſhe is liable, of the cauſes of her
improvement or degeneration, and of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
relations that connect the whole, and give
riſe to all the diverſities which characteriſe and
conſtitute particular orders of exiſtence<note n="*" place="bottom">Notwithſtanding the ſplendid talents of the Count de Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon, the tranſlator thinks it incumbent upon him to caution the reader againſt a favourite and dangerous doctrine which the author, in ſome paſſages of his work, ſeems too anxious to incl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. Like many of our modern French writers, he endeavours to baniſh final cauſes from the univerſe. It is a ſubject of much regret, that philoſophers, the perſons who are beſt qualified to unfold the myſteries of Nature, inſtead of comforting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming mankind, by ſhowing that her moſt hoſtile forms are real expreſſions of benevolence, and that the great chain of cauſes and effects, whether in the natural or moral world, are all intended to promote general felicity, ſhould ſo frequently ſtretch their fancy for the perverſe purpoſe of throwing a gloom over all her productions, and of excluding deſign from the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of her great Author. Becauſe they cannot comprehend the ſupreme Being, becauſe they are unable to perceive his mode of acting upon matter, they, therefore, ſeem willing to diſbelieve his exiſtence. They have a partial knowledge of ſome of the properties of matter. Theſe properties they conſider as the only ſprings which produce and regulate all the movements exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both in animate and inanimate beings; and hence they raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that ſuperior powers are unneceſſary.—This is not a proper place for reaſoning. It ſhall only be remarked, that a univerſe without deſign and intelligence, is more incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible than an active machine without a moving principle.</note>.</p>

                  <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0195400701:16"/>
The original work, of which a tranſlation is
now attempted, was undertaken and carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
execution under the munificent encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a great monarch. The deſign was to
compoſe a hiſtory which ſhould record not only
every phaenomenon in the univerſe that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
known; but to examine, deſcribe, and
delineate from the life, all the animals which
could be procured by royal influence. A plan
ſo extenſive required the joint operation of, at
leaſt, two perſon; the one to compoſe the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
part, the other to diſſect and minutely
deſcribe every animal, both native and foreign,
that ſhould be obtained. The literary character
and philoſophic talents of the COUNT DE BUF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FON
pointed him out for the execution of the
firſt department, and the acuteneſs and anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
ſkill of M. DAUBENTON, recommended
him for that of the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Three volumes of this great work were given
to the public in the year 1749. Theſe volumes
exhibited ſuch diſplays of learning, taſte, genius,
and eloquence, as procured to the author un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
admiration, and excited a ſtrong and
general deſire for the completion of his plan;
which however, from various cauſes, was not
accompliſhed till the year 1767.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0195400701:17"/>
The COUNT DE BUFFON, in the year 1776,
favoured the world with a ſupplementary vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
to his hiſtory of quadrupeds, which, beſide
an ingenious diſſertation on Mules, contains re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and figures of ſeveral new animals, and
valuable additions to moſt of thoſe deſcribed in
the original publication.</p>
               <p>It would be improper to enter more minutely
into the hiſtory or contents of this magnificent
work. Such is the fertility of the author's ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
and ſuch his ardour for philoſophic inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that, when treating of the moſt common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
he often aſtoniſhes his reader with the
profoundneſs of his remarks, and the beauty of
his analogical diſcuſſions.</p>
               <p>But, though the publication was a great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſiſition
to literature; yet the high price of
SIXTEEN GUINEAS, which was an unavoidable
conſequence of its ſplendour, and of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
number of its elegant engravings, confined
its utility to men of opulence. Senſible of this
inconvenience, the COUNT DE BUFFON, a few
years ago, publiſhed an edition in 12<hi>mo</hi>; and,
to bring it within the reach of common purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,
he excluded from it the long and minute
anatomical diſſections and menſurations.</p>
               <p>After this ſhort ſketch of the COUNT DE
BUFFON's Hiſtory of Nature, it may ſeem ſtrange
that no decent tranſlation of it has hitherto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the Engliſh language. To ſuch an
undertaking, the great expence of the engravings
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0195400701:18"/>
was one ſolid objection. Another aroſe from
the vaſt variety of learning employed by the
author. When to theſe are added the exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his fancy, the eloquence and force of
his diction, the delicacy and acuteneſs of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions,
we ſhould rather wonder how any
man could reconcile himſelf to a taſk ſo labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and which required the union of ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified
talents.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <p>The tranſlation which is now ſubmitted to the
judgment and candour of the public, was projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and begun about ſeven years ago. The tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator,
unſuſpicious of rivals, proceeded with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.
When the ingenious Dr Goldſmith's
Natural Hiſtory appeared, ſome aſſiſtance was
expected, as he tranſlates many paſſages from
Buffon. But this expectation was abortive; for
Dr Goldſmith, though he follows our author in
general, omits and patches according to his own
fancy, ſeldom giving any article entire, or in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and never exerting thoſe talents as a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator
which he employs ſo ſucceſsfully in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
compoſitions.</p>
               <p>Dr Goldſmith's Natural Hiſtory, however,
ſuggeſted to ſome bookſellers the idea of a cheap
tranſlation of Buffon's Hiſtory of Quadrupeds.
The preſent tranſlator, knowing the difficulty and
labour of his undertaking, was naturally alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0195400701:19"/>
when he ſaw this new publication announced.
But, upon the peruſal of it, he was ſurpriſed to
find, that, in many places, it was nearly a literal
tranſcript of the paſſages which Dr Goldſmith
had tacked together to anſwer his own views,
without intending to tranſlate, or to exhibit fully
the ideas of Buffon<note n="*" place="bottom">See Tranſlation, vol. 1. p. 65. Goldſmith's Nat. Hiſt. vol. 2. p. 82. and Buffon, Nat. Hiſt. vol. 2. p. 521. 4to edit. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever compares the pages referred to, will find a curious ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of book-manufacture. Dr Goldſmith omits a paſſage of Buffon's work, and, inſtead of it, inſerts ſome remarks of his own. The tranſlator copies the whole verbatim, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the original. This is one inſtance out of many that might be quoted, where the remarks of Dr Goldſmith are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the public as the property of the Count de Buffon.

                     <p>Take the following examples. The Count de Buffon having conceived the idea, that, by a certain management of animals at birth, the <hi>foramen ovale</hi> of the heart, inſtead of ſhutting ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſpiration, might be kept open for life, inſtituted a ſet of experiments to determine the point. Through the whole of theſe experiments, the <hi>foramen ovale</hi> of the heart is tranſlated the <hi>navel</hi>; and the Count de Buffon is repreſented by our authors as drawing this ſtrange concluſion: 'This experiment I never car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried further; but I ſaw enough to convince me, that reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is leſs neceſſary to a new born, than to a grown animal; and that it might be poſſible, with proper precautions, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, in this manner, the NAVEL from being <hi>cloſed,</hi> and thus produce excellent <hi>divers,</hi> and different kinds of <hi>amphibious</hi> ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which might live equally in air and water;' Tranſ. vol. 1. p. 15.</p>
                     <p>In vol. 1. p. 40. when enumerating the effects of caſtration, the tranſlators make Buffon exclaim: 'How great, for example, is the difference between <hi>an</hi> bull and <hi>a</hi> ox, between a <hi>ram</hi> and an <hi>ewe!</hi>'—Speaking of the foetus in utero, vol. 1. p. 165. we have the following paſſage: 'It poſſeſſes then very little oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to exerciſe the ſenſe of <hi>ſeeing,</hi> which depends ſolely on the fineneſs of the <hi>ſkin,</hi> and which is <hi>common</hi> to all the body.' In vol. 1. p. 27. where mention is made of the uſe of the ſaliva of the mother, in promoting the digeſtion of the more ſolid kinds of nouriſhment taken by infants, Buffon is repreſented as ſaying.

The ſtyle, too, is not only ſlovenly
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0195400701:21"/>
and inaccurate, but often perfectly unintelligible.
In a word, this tranſlation muſt be, and actually
is, conſidered by every intelligent reader, as a
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0195400701:22"/>
mere literary impoſition. It is painful to mark
the blunders of other men; and, were it not for
a regard to literature, and to the reputation of
the COUNT DE BUFFON, no notice ſhould have
been taken of this ſtrange performance. But
the examples given in the notes will fully juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the ſeeming ſeverity of theſe ſtrictures.</p>
               <p>The following tranſlation comprehends what
is contained in the original fifteen volumes in
quarto, together with the ſupplementary volume
to the hiſtory of quadrupeds, excepting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the King's cabinet, the dry and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſting
anatomical diſſections and menſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which can be of little uſe but to profeſſed
anatomiſts, and have been properly omitted by
the author in the laſt Paris edition. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of ſtudying Natural Hiſtory; the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of methodical diſtributions; and the
mode of deſcribing animals, are likewiſe omitted.
The chief intention of theſe diſcourſes is to ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule
the authors of ſyſtematic arrangements, and
particularly the late ingenuous and indefatigable
Sir Charles Linnaeus, whoſe zeal and labours in
promoting the inveſtigation of natural objects
merit the higheſt applauſe. There is a ſtronger
reaſon for this omiſſion: The ſame remarks and
arguments are, perhaps, too frequently repeated
in the hiſtory of particular animals.</p>
               <p>To render this Engliſh verſion more valuable,
the tranſlator has added ſhort diſtinctive deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to each ſpecies of quadrupeds. For theſe
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:0195400701:23"/>
he has been indebted to the labours of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ingenious Mr Pennant, who has alſo,
with that politeneſs, and diſintereſted regard to
ſcience, which ought always to adorn the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and the ſcholar, frankly permitted the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graving
of ſeveral new animals from his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Synopſis<note n="*" place="bottom">Synopſis of quadrupeds, by Thomas Pennant, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 8vo, 1771.</note>. Beſide theſe uſeful additions,
the ſynonimes, and the generic and ſpecific cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters

other naturaliſts, are ſubjoined to the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of each ſpecies.</p>
               <p>Where the author commits miſtakes, or where
he recommends practices, regarding the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of particular animals, which differ
from thoſe obſerved in this country, the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
has taken the liberty of animadverting upon
ſuch paſſages in notes: But he has ſeldom ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
any notice of peculiar theories or doctrines.
Theſe muſt reſt upon the facts and arguments
employed by the author. It was not the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the tranſlator to write a commentary upon
his original.</p>
               <p>The great variety of ſubjects diſcuſſed by the
Count de Buffon, has already been mentioned.
It is unneceſſary to remark, that every ſubject
demands a peculiar ſtyle. A bare enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of facts, or deſcriptions of the dimenſions,
figure, and colour of animals, admit of no other
ornament than that of perſpicuity. Topics of
philoſophy and argument require a higher and
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:0195400701:24"/>
more figurative expreſſion: And addreſſes to
the paſſions, and the finer feelings of men, give
full ſcope to the exerciſe of genius and taſte. Of
theſe different ſpecies of writing, the examples
are numerous in the works of the COUNT DE
BUFFON. The tranſlator has endeavoured to
follow the original, as far as his abilities would
permit. The degree of ſucceſs he has attained
muſt be ſubmitted to the impartial determination
of the public. He ſhall only ſay, that his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
though he is conſcious of no vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
negligence, are much greater than his
hopes.</p>

               <p> In the dimenſions of animals, the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator

            <head>THE
HISTORY AND THEORY
OF THE
EARTH.</head>
            <p>THE figure of the earth<note n="*" place="bottom">See ſubſequent proofs of the theory of the earth, art. I.</note>, its motions, or
the external relations which ſubſiſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
it and the other parts of the univerſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
not to our preſent inquiry. It is the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſtructure of the globe, its form and manner
of exiſtence, that we here propoſe to examine.
The general hiſtory of the earth ought to precede
that of its productions. Details of particular
facts relating to the oeconomy and manners of
animals, or to the culture and vegetation of
plants, are not, perhaps, ſo much the objects of
natural hiſtory, as general deductions from the
obſervations that have been made upon the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
materials of which the earth itſelf is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
as its heights, depths, and inequalities;
the motions of the ſea, the direction of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
the ſituation of rocks and quarries, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
and effects of currents in the ocean, &amp;c.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0195400701:27"/>
This is the hiſtory of nature at large, and of her
principal operations, by which every other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
or leſs general effect is produced. The the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
of theſe effects conſtitutes what may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the primary ſcience, upon which a preciſe
knowledge of particular appearances, as well as
of terreſtrial ſubſtances, ſolely depends. This
ſpecies of ſcience may be conſidered as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to phyſics; but, is not all phyſical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
where ſyſtem is excluded, a part of the
hiſtory of nature?</p>
            <p>In ſubjects of an extenſive kind, the relations
of which it is difficult to trace, where ſome
facts are but partially known, and others ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
it is more eaſy to form a fanciful ſyſtem,
than to eſtabliſh a rational theory. Thus the
theory of the earth has never hitherto been
treated but in a vague and hypothetical manner.
I ſhall, therefore, exhibit only a curſory view
of the notions of ſome authors who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
upon this ſubject.</p>
            <p>The firſt hypotheſis I ſhall mention is more
conſpicuous for its ingenuity than ſolidity. It
is the production of an Engliſh aſtronomer<note n="*" place="bottom">Whiſton; See the proofs, art. II.</note>,
who was an enthuſiaſtic admirer of Sir Iſaac
Newton's ſyſtem of philoſophy. Convinced
that every poſſible event depends upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and direction of the ſtars, he endeavours
to prove, by means of mathematical calculations,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0195400701:28"/>
that all the changes this earth has undergone
have been produced by the tail of a comet.</p>
            <p>For another hypotheſis we are indebted to a
heterodox divine<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet. See proofs, art. III.</note>, whoſe brain was ſo fully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with poetical illuſions, that he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
he had ſeen the univerſe created. After
telling us the ſtate of the earth when it firſt
ſprung from nothing, what changes have been
introduced by the deluge, what the earth has been,
and what it now is, he aſſumes the prophetic
ſtyle, and predicts what will be its condition af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the deſtruction of the human kind.</p>
            <p>A third writer<note n="†" place="bottom">Woodward. See proofs, art. IV,</note>, a man of more extenſive ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
than the two former, but equally crude
and confuſed in his ideas, explains the principal
appearances of the globe by the aid of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
abyſs in the bowels of the earth; which,
in his eſtimation, is nothing but a thin cruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing
this vaſt ocean of fluid matter.</p>
            <p>Theſe unſtable hypotheſes are all conſtructed
on tottering foundations. The ideas they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
are indiſtinct, the facts are confounded, and
the whole is amotely jumble of phyſics and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
They, accordingly, have never been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted
but by people who embrace opinions
without examination, and who, incapable of
diſtinguiſhing the degrees of probability, are
more deeply impreſſed with marvellous chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras
than with the force of truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0195400701:29"/>
Our ideas on this ſubject will be leſs extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
and may appear unimportant when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the grand ſyſtems juſt mentioned.
But it ought not to be forgotten, that it is the
buſineſs of an hiſtorian to deſcribe, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent;
that no gratuitous ſuppoſitions are to be
admitted in ſubjects that depend upon fact and
obſervation; and that, in hiſtorical compoſitions,
the imagination cannot be employed, unleſs for
the purpoſe of combining obſervations, of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
facts more general, and of forming a
connected whole, which preſents to the mind
clear ideas, and probable conjectures: I ſay, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;
for it is impoſſible to give demonſtrative
evidence on this ſubject. Demonſtration is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to the mathematical ſciences. Our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in phyſics and natural hiſtory depends en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
on experience, and is limited to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of reaſoning by induction.</p>
            <p>With regard to the hiſtory of the earth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we ſhall begin with ſuch facts as have been
univerſally acknowledged in all ages, not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thoſe additional truths that have fallen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our own obſervation.</p>
            <p>The ſurface of this immenſe globe exhibits to
our obſervation heights, depths, plains, ſeas,
marſhes, rivers, caverns, gulfs, volcano's; and,
on a curſory view, we can diſcover, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of theſe objects, neither order nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity.
If we penetrate into the bowels of the
earth, we find metals, minerals, ſtones, bitumens,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0195400701:30"/>
ſands, earths, waters, and matter of every kind,
placed as it were by mere accident, and without
any apparent deſign. Upon a nearer and more
attentive inſpection, we diſcover ſunk moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains<note n="*" place="bottom">See Senec. Quaeſt. lib. 6. cap. 21. Strab. Geog. lib. 1. Oroſius, lib. 2. cap. 18. Plin. lib. 2. cap. 19. Hiſt. de l'acad, des ſciences, année 1708, p. 23.</note>,
caverns filled up, ſhattered rocks, whole
countries ſwallowed up, new iſlands emerged
from the ocean, heavy ſubſtances placed above
light ones, hard bodies incloſed within ſoft bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
in a word, we find matter in every form,
dry and humid, warm and cold, ſolid and brittle,
blended in a chaos of confuſion, which can be
compared to nothing but a heap of rubbiſh, or
the ruins of a world.</p>
            <p>Theſe ruins, however, we inhabit with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ſecurity. The different generations of men,
of animals, and of plants, ſucceed one another
without interruption: The productions of the
earth are ſufficient for their ſuſtenance; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the ſea, and the currents of the air, are
regulated by fixed laws<note n="†" place="bottom">See the proofs, art. XIV.</note>; the returns of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are uniform, and the rigours of winter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably
give place to the verdure of the ſpring.
With regard to us, every thing has the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of order: The earth, formerly a chaos, is
now a tranquil, an harmonious, a delightful ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
where all is animated and governed by
ſuch amazing diſplays of power and intelligence,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0195400701:31"/>
as fill us with admiration, and elevate our minds
to the contemplation of the great Creator.</p>
            <p>But, let us not decide precipitantly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the irregularities on the ſurface of the earth,
and the apparent diſorder in its bowels: We ſhall
ſoon perceive the utility, and even the neceſſity
of this arrangement. With a little attention,
we ſhall perhaps diſcover an order of which we
had no conception, and general relations which
cannot be apprehended by a ſlight examination.
Our knowledge, indeed, with regard to this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
muſt always be limited. We are entirely
unacquainted with many parts of the ſurface of
this globe<note n="*" place="bottom">See proofs, art. VI.</note>, and have but very partial ideas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the bottom of the ocean, which, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places, has never been ſounded. We can
only penetrate the rind of the earth. The
greateſt caverns<note n="†" place="bottom">Phil. tranſ. abridged, vol. ii. p. 323.</note>, the deepeſt mines<note n="‡" place="bottom">Boyle's works, vol. iii. p. 232.</note>, deſcend
not above the 8th thouſandth part of its diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Our judgment is therefore confined to the
upper ſtratum, or mere ſuperficial part. We
know, indeed, that, bulk for bulk, the earth is
four times heavier than the ſun: We likewiſe
know the proportion its weight bears to that of
the other planets. But ſtill this eſtimation is
only relative. We have no ſtandard. Of the
real weight of the materials we are ſo ignorant,
that the internal part of the globe may be either
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0195400701:32"/>
a void ſpace, or it may be compoſed of matter
a thouſand times heavier than gold. Neither is
there any method of making farther diſcoveries
on this ſubject. It is even with difficulty that
rational conjectures can be formed<note n="*" place="bottom">See proofs, art. I.</note>.</p>
            <p>We muſt therefore confine ourſelves to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
examination and deſcription of the ſurface
of the earth, and of ſuch inconſiderable depths
as we have been able to penetrate. The firſt
object which attracts the attention, is that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
body of water with which the greateſt
part of the globe is covered. Theſe waters oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy
the loweſt grounds; their ſurface is always
level; and, notwithſtanding their uniform ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to equilibrium and reſt, they are kept in
perpetual agitation by a powerful agent<note n="†" place="bottom">Proofs, art. XII.</note>, which
counteracts their natural tranquility, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
to them a regular periodic motion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately
elevating and depreſſing their waves,
and which produces a concuſſion or vibration
in the whole maſs, even to the moſt profound
depths. This motion of the water is coeval with
time, and will endure as long as the ſun and
and moon, which are the cauſes of it.</p>
            <p>In examining the bottom of the ſea, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it to be equally irregular as the ſurface of
the dry land<note n="‡" place="bottom">Proofs, art. XIII.</note>. We diſcover hills and valleys,
plains and hollows, rocks and earths of every
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0195400701:33"/>
kind<note n="*" place="bottom">See M. Buache's chart of the depths of the ocean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Africa and America.</note>: We diſcover, likewiſe, that iſlands are
nothing but the ſummits of vaſt mountains,
whoſe foundations are buried in the ocean<note n="†" place="bottom">Varenii Geog. gen. p. 218.</note>;
we find other mountains whoſe tops are nearly
on a level with the ſurface of the water; and
rapid currents which run contrary to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
movement<note n="‡" place="bottom">Proofs, art. XIII.</note>. Theſe currents ſometimes run
in the ſame direction; at other times their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is retrograde<note n="‖" place="bottom">Varen. p. 140. and Voyages de Pirard, p. 137.</note>; but they never exceed their
natural limits, which ſeem to be as immutable
as thoſe which bound the efforts of land-rivers.
On one hand, we meet with tempeſtuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
where the winds blow with irreſiſtible fury,
where the heavens and the ocean, equally convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
are mixed and confounded in the general
ſhock; violent inteſtine motions, tumultuous ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings<note n="§" place="bottom">Shaw's travels.</note>,
water-ſpouts<note n="**" place="bottom">Proofs, art. XVI.</note>, and ſtrange agitations,
produced by volcano's, whoſe mouths, though
many fathoms below the ſurface, vomit forth
torrents of fire, and puſh, even to the clouds,
a thick vapour, compoſed of water, ſulphur,
and bitumen; and dreadful gulphs or whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pools<note n="††" place="bottom">The Maleſtroom in the Norwegian ſea.</note>,
which ſeem to attract veſſels for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
purpoſe than to ſwallow them up. On
the other hand, we diſcover vaſt regions of an
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0195400701:34"/>
oppoſite nature, always ſmooth and calm, but
equally dangerous to the mariner<note n="*" place="bottom">The calms and tornados in the Aethiopian ſea.</note>. Here the
winds never exert their force; the nautical art
is of no utility; the becalmed voyagers muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
immoveably fixed, till death relieve them
from miſery. To conclude, directing our eyes
toward the ſouthern or northern extremities of
the globe, we diſcover huge maſſes of ice<note n="†" place="bottom">Proofs, art. VI. and X.</note>,
which, detaching themſelves from the polar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
advance, like floating mountains, to the
temperate climates, where they diſſolve and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
from our view<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Buache's chart 1739.</note>.</p>
            <p>Beſide theſe grand objects, the ocean preſents
us with myriads of animated beings, almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
in variety: Some clothed in light ſcales,
ſwim with amazing ſwiftneſs; others, loaded
with thick ſhells, trail heavily along, leaving
their traces in the ſand: To others nature has
given ſins reſembling wings, with which they
ſupport themſelves in the air, and fly before
their enemies to conſiderable diſtances. Laſtly,
the ſea gives birth to other animals, that, totally
deprived of motion, live and die immoveably
fixed to the ſame rocks: All, however, find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of food in this fluid element. The
bottom of the ocean, and the ſhelving ſides of
rocks, produce plentiful crops of plants of many
different ſpecies; its ſoil is compoſed of ſand,
gravel, rocks, and ſhells; in ſome places, it is a fine
clay, in others, a compact earth; and, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0195400701:35"/>
the bottom of the ſea has an exact reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to the dry land which we inhabit.</p>
            <p>Let us next take a view of the land: What
prodigious differences take place in different
climates? What a variety of ſoils! what inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
in the ſurface! But, upon a more attentive
obſervation, we will perceive, that the great
chains of mountains lie nearer the equator than
the poles<note n="*" place="bottom">Proofs, art. IX.</note>; that, in the Old Continent, their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
is more from eaſt to weſt than from
ſouth to north; and that, on the contrary, in
the New Continent, they extend more from north
to ſouth than from eaſt to weſt. But, what is
ſtill more remarkable, the figure and direction
of theſe mountains, which have a moſt irregular
appearance<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. art. IX XII.</note>, correſpond ſo wonderfully, that the
<hi>prominent</hi> angles of one mountain are conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppoſite to the <hi>concave</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Saliant</hi> and <hi>re entering</hi> angles; Muller's fortification.</note> angles of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
mountain<note n="‖" place="bottom">Lettres Phil. de Bourguet, p. 181.</note>, and of equal dimenſions,
whether they be ſeparated by an extenſive plain,
or a ſmall valley. I have further remarked, that
oppoſite hills are always nearly of the ſame
height; and that mountains generally occupy
the middle of continents, iſlands, and promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
dividing them by their greateſt lengths<note n="§" place="bottom">Varen, Geog. p. 69.</note>.
I have likewiſe traced the courſes of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
rivers, and find that their direction is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perpendicular to the ſea-coaſts into which
they empty themſelves; and that, during the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0195400701:36"/>
greateſt part of their courſes, they follow the
direction of the mountains from which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
their origin<note n="*" place="bottom">Proofs, art X.</note>. The ſea-coaſts are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bordered with rocks of marble, and other hard
ſtones, or rather with earth and ſand accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by the waters of the ſea, or brought down
and depoſited by rivers. In oppoſite coaſts, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
only by ſmall arms of the ſea, the different
ſtrata or beds of earth are of the ſame materials<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. art. VII.</note>.
I find that volcano's never exiſt but in high
mountains<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. art. XVI.</note>; that a great number of them
are entirely extinguiſhed; that ſome are connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to others by ſubterranean paſſages, and their
eruptions not unfrequently happen at the ſame
time<note n="‖" place="bottom">Kircher Mund. ſubter. in praeſ.</note>. There are ſimilar communications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
certain lakes and ſeas. Some rivers ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
diſappear<note n="§" place="bottom">Varen. Geog. p. 43.</note>, and ſeem to precipitate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into the bowels of the earth. We likewiſe
find certain mediterranean or inland ſeas, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
receive, from many and great rivers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
quantities of water, without any aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
of their bounds, probably diſcharging
by ſubterraneous paſſages all thoſe extraneous
ſupplies. It is likewiſe eaſy to diſtinguiſh lands
which have been long inhabited, from thoſe new
countries where the earth appears in a rude ſtate,
where the rivers are full of cataracts, where the
land is either nearly overflowed with water, or
burnt up with drought, and where every place
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0195400701:37"/>
capable of producing trees is totally covered with
wood.</p>
            <p>Proceeding in our examination, we diſcover
that the upper ſtratum of the earth is univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ſame ſubſtance<note n="*" place="bottom">Proofs, art. VII.</note>; that this ſubſtance,
from which all animals and vegetables derive
their growth and nouriſhment, is nothing but
a compoſition of the decayed parts of animal
and vegetable bodies, reduced into ſuch ſmall
particles that their former organic ſtate is not
diſtinguiſhable. Penetrating a little deeper, we
find the real earth, beds of ſand, lime-ſtone, clay,
ſhells, marble, gravel, chalk, &amp;c. Theſe beds
are always parallel to each other<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. and Woodward, p. 41. &amp;c.</note>, and of the
ſame thickneſs through their whole extent. In
neighbouring hills, beds or ſtrata of the ſame
materials are uniformly found at the ſame le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
though the hills be ſeparated by deep and
large valleys. Strata of every kind, even of the
moſt ſolid rocks, are uniformly divided by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
fiſſures<note n="‡" place="bottom">Proofs, art. VIII.</note>. Shells, ſkeletons of fiſhes,
marine plants, &amp;c. are often found in the bowels
of the earth, and on the top of mountains<note n="‖" place="bottom">Proofs, art. VIII.</note>, even
at the greateſt diſtances from the ſea. Theſe
ſhells, fiſhes, and plants, are exactly ſimilar to
thoſe which exiſt in the ocean. Petrified ſhells
are to be met with, almoſt every wher, in
prodigious quantities: They are not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
in rocks of marble and lime-ſtone, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0195400701:38"/>
well as in earths and clays, but are actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
and filled with the very ſubſtances
in which they are incloſed. In fine, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
by repeated obſervation, that marbles,
lime-ſtones, chalks, marles, clays, ſand, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all terreſtrial ſubſtances, wherever ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
are full of ſhells and other ſpoils of the
ocean<note n="*" place="bottom">Steno, Woodward, Ray, Bourguet, Scheuchzer, Phil. Tranſ. Mem. de I'Acad. &amp;c.</note>.</p>
            <p>Having enumerated theſe facts, let us try
what concluſions can be drawn from them.</p>
            <p>The changes which the earth has undergone,
during the laſt two or three thouſand years,
are inconſiderable, when compared with the
great revolutions which muſt have taken place
in thoſe ages that immediately ſucceeded the
creation. For, as terreſtrial ſubſtances could
not acquire ſolidity but by the continued action
of gravity, it is eaſy to demonſtrate, that the
ſurface of the earth was at firſt much ſofter than
it is now; and, conſequently, that the ſame
cauſes which at preſent produce but ſlight, and
almoſt imperceptible alterations during the courſe
of many centuries, were then capable of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
very great revolutions in a few years. It
appears, indeed, to be an uncontravertible fact,
that the dry land which we now inhabit, and
even the ſummits of the higheſt mountains,
were formerly covered with the waters of the
ſea; for ſhells, and other marine bodies, are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0195400701:39"/>
ſtill found upon the very tops of mountains. It
likewiſe appears, that the waters of the ſea have
remained for a long track of years upon the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the earth; becauſe, in many places, ſuch
immenſe banks of ſhells have been diſcovered,
that it is impoſſible ſo great a multitude of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
could exiſt at the ſame time. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
ſeems likewiſe to prove, that, although
the materials on the ſurface of the earth were
then ſoft, and, of courſe, eaſily diſunited,
moved, and tranſported, by the waters; yet
theſe tranſportations could not be ſuddenly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
They muſt have been gradual and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive,
as ſea-bodies are ſometimes found
more than 1000 feet below the ſurface. Such
a thickneſs of earth or of ſtone could not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated
in a ſhort time. Although it ſhould
be ſuppoſed, that, at the deluge, all the ſhells
were tranſported from the bottom of the ocean,
and depoſited upon the dry land; yet, beſide the
difficulty of eſtabliſhing this ſuppoſition, it is
clear, that, as ſhells are found incorporated in
marble, and in the rocks of the higheſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
we muſt likewiſe ſuppoſe, that all theſe
marbles and rocks were formed at the ſame
time, and at the very inſtant when the deluge
took place; and that, before this grand revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there were neither mountains, nor marbles,
nor rocks, nor clays, nor matter of any kind ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
to what we are now acquainted with,
as they all, with few exceptions, contain ſhells,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0195400701:40"/>
and other productions of the ocean. Beſide, at
the time of the univerſal deluge, the earth muſt
have acquired a conſiderable degree of ſolidity,
by the action of gravity for more than ſixteen
centuries. During the ſhort time the deluge
laſted, it is, therefore, impoſſible, that the waters
ſhould have overturned and diſſolved the whole
ſurface of the earth, to the greateſt depths that
mankind have been able to penetrate.</p>
            <p>But, without inſiſting longer on this point,
which ſhall afterwards be more fully canvaſſed,
I ſhall confine myſelf to known and eſtabliſhed
facts. It is certain, that the waters of the ſea
have, at ſome period or other, remained for a
ſucceſſion of ages upon what we now know to
be dry land; and, conſequently, that the vaſt
continents of Aſia, Europe, Africa, and Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
were then the bottom of an immenſe ocean,
replete with every thing which the preſent ocean
produces. It is likewiſe certain, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſtrata of the earth are horizontal, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
to each other<note n="*" place="bottom">Proofs, art. VII.</note>. This parallel ſituation
muſt, therefore, be owing to the operation of
the waters, which have gradually accumulated
the different materials, and given them the ſame
poſition which water itſelf invariably aſſumes.
The horizontal poſition of ſtrata is almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal:
In plains, the ſtrata are exactly horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
It is only in the mountains that they are
inclined to the horizon; becauſe they have ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0195400701:41"/>
been formed by ſediments depoſited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an inclined baſe. Now, I maintain, that theſe
ſtrata muſt have been gradually formed, and are
not the effect of any ſudden revolution; becauſe
nothing is more frequent than ſtrata compoſed
of heavy materials placed above light ones,
which never could have happened, if, according
to ſome authors, the whole had been blended
and diſſolved by the deluge, and afterwards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated.
On this ſuppoſition, every thing
would have had a different aſpect from what
now appears. The heavieſt bodies would
have deſcended firſt, and every ſtratum would
have had a ſituation correſponding to its ſpecific
gravity. In this caſe, we ſhould not have ſeen
ſolid rocks or metals placed above light ſand,
nor clay under coal.</p>
            <p>Another circumſtance demands our attention.
No other cauſe than the motion and ſediments
or water could poſſibly produce the regular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the various ſtrata of which the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
part of this earth is compoſed. The higheſt
mountains conſiſt of parallel ſtrata, as well as
the loweſt valleys. Of courſe, the formation of
mountains cannot be imputed to the ſhocks of
earthquakes, or to the eruptions of volcano's.
Such ſmall eminences as have been raiſed by
volcano's or convulſions of the earth, inſtead of
being compoſed of parallel ſtrata, are mere maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of weighty material, blended together in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0195400701:42"/>
utmoſt confuſion.<note n="*" place="bottom">Proofs, art. XVII.</note>. But this parallel and hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal
poſition of ſtrata muſt neceſſarily be the
operation of a uniform and conſtant cauſe.</p>
            <p>We are, therefore, obliged to conclude, from
repeated and uncontrovertible facts and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
that the dry and habitable part of the
earth has remained for a long time under the
waters of the ſea, and muſt have undergone the
ſame fluctuation and changes which are preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
going on at the bottom of the ocean. To
diſcover, therefore, what has formerly happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the dry land, let us examine what paſſes
in the bottom of the ſea; and we ſhall ſoon be
enabled to make ſome rational concluſions with
regard to the external figure, and internal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the earth.</p>
            <p>The ocean, from the creation of the ſolar ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem,
has been conſtantly ſubject to a regular
flux and reflux. This motion, which happens
twice in twenty-four hours, is principally occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by the action of the moon, and is greater
in the equatorial regions than in other climates.
The earth likewiſe performs a rapid motion on
its axis, and, conſequently, has a centrifugal
force, which is alſo greateſt at the equator.
This laſt circumſtance, independent of actual
obſervations, proves, that the earth is not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ſphere, but that it muſt be more elevated
under the equator than at the poles. From theſe
two combined cauſes, the tides, and the motion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0195400701:43"/>
of the earth, it may be fairly concluded, that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
this globe had been originally a perfect
ſphere, its diurnal motion, and the ebbing and
flowing of the tides, muſt neceſſarily, in a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of time, have elevated the equatorial
parts, by gradually carrying mud, earth, ſand,
ſhells, &amp;c. from other climates, and depoſiting
them at the equator<note n="*" place="bottom">Proofs, art. XII.</note>. On this ſuppoſition, the
greateſt inequalities on the ſurface of the earth
ought to be found, and, in fact, are found, in
the neighbourhood of the equator. Beſides, as
the alternate motion of the tides has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
and regular ſince the exiſtence of the
world, is it not natural to think, that, at each
tide, the water carries from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a ſmall quantity of matter, which falls to
the bottom as a ſediment, and forms thoſe hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal
and parallel ſtrata that every where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear?
The motion of the waters, in the flux
and reflux, being always horizontal, the matter
tranſported by them muſt neceſſarily take the
ſame parallel direction after it is depoſited.</p>
            <p>To this, it may be objected, that, as the flux
is equal to, and regularly ſucceeded by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux,
the two motions will blance each other;
or, that the matter brought by the flux will be
carried back by the reflux; and, conſequently,
that this cauſe of the formation of ſtrata muſt
be chimerical, as the bottom of the ocean can
never be affected by a uniform alternate motion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0195400701:44"/>
of the waters; far leſs could this motion change
its original ſtructure, by creating heights, and
other inequalities.</p>
            <p>But, in the firſt place, the alternate motion of
the waters is by no means equal; for the ſea
has a continual motion from eaſt to weſt: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
the agitations occaſioned by the winds, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
great inequalities in the tides. It will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be acknowledged, that, by every motion
in the ſea, particles of earth, and other mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
muſt be carried from one place, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited
in another; and that theſe collections
of matter muſt aſſume the form of parallel and
horizontal ſtrata. Farther, a well known fact
will entirely obviate this objection. On all
coaſts, where the ebbing and flowing are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible<note n="*" place="bottom">Proofs, art. XIX.</note>, numberleſs materials are brought in
by the flux, which are not carried back by the
reflux. The ſea gradually increaſes on ſome
places, and recedes from others, narrowing its
limits, by depoſiting earth, ſand, ſhells, &amp;c.
which naturally take a horizontal poſition.
Theſe materials, when accumulated and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a certain degree, gradually ſhut out the
water, and remain for ever in the form of dry
land.</p>
            <p>But, to remove every doubt concerning this
important point, let us examine more cloſely
the practicability of a mountain's being formed
at the bottom of the ſea, by the motion and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0195400701:45"/>
of the water. On a coaſt which the
ſea waſhes with violence during the flow, ſome
part of the earth muſt be carried off by every
ſtroke of the waves. Even where the ſea is
bounded by rock, it is a known fact, that the
rock is gradually waſted by the water<note n="*" place="bottom">See Shaw's travels.</note>; and,
conſequently, that ſmall particles are carried off
by the retreat of every wave. Thoſe particles
of earth or ſtone are neceſſarily tranſported to
ſome diſtance. Whenever the agitation of the
water is abated, the particles are precipitated in
the form of a ſediment, and lay the foundation
of a firſt ſtratum, which is either horizontal, or
inclined, according to the ſituation of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
upon which they fall. This ſtratum will
ſoon be ſucceeded by a ſimilar one, produced
by the ſame cauſe; and thus a conſiderable
quantity of matter will be gradually amaſſed,
and diſpoſed in parallel beds. In proceſs of
time, this gradually accumulating maſs will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a mountain in the bottom of the ſea, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
reſembling, both in external and internal
ſtructure, theſe mountains which we ſee on the
dry land. If there happened to be ſhells in
that part of the bottom of the ſea where we
have ſuppoſed the ſediments to be depoſited,
they will be covered, filled, and incorporated
with the depoſited matter, and form a part of
the general maſs. Theſe ſhells will be lodged
in different parts of the mountains, correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0195400701:46"/>
to the times they were depoſited. Thoſe
which lay at the bottom, before the firſt ſtratum
was formed, will occupy the loweſt ſtation;
and thoſe which were afterwards depoſited, will
be found in the more elevated parts.</p>
            <p>In the ſame manner, when the bottom of the
ſea, at particular places, is troubled by the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the water, earth, clay, ſhells, and other
matter, muſt neceſſarily be removed from theſe
parts, and depoſited elſewhere. For we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
by all divers, that the bottom of the ſea,
at the greateſt depths to which they deſcend<note n="*" place="bottom">Boyle's works, vol. 3. p. 232.</note>,
is ſo ſtrongly affected by the agitation of the
water, that earth, clay, and ſhells, are removed
to great diſtances. Tranſportations of this kind
muſt, therefore, be conſtantly going on in every
part of the ocean; and the matters tranſported,
after ſubſiding, muſt uniformly raiſe eminences
ſimilar, in every reſpect, to the compoſition and
ſtructure of our mountains. Thus the motions
produced by the flux and reflux, by winds and
currents, muſt uniformly create inequalities in
the bottom of the ocean.</p>
            <p>Further, we muſt not imagine that theſe
matters cannot be carried to great diſtances,
ſince we daily find grain, and other productions
of the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, arriving on our
coaſts<note n="†" place="bottom">Particularly on the coaſts of Scotland and of Ireland; See Ray's Diſcourſes.</note> Theſe bodies are, indeed, ſpecifically
lighter than water; but the other ſubſtances
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0195400701:47"/>
are ſpecifically heavier. Still, however, as they
are reduced to an impalpable powder, they may
be kept long ſuſpended in the water, and, of
courſe, tranſported to any diſtance.</p>
            <p>It has been conceived, that the agitation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the winds and tides is only ſuperficial,
and does not affect the bottom, eſpecially when
it is very deep. But it ought to be remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that, whatever be the depth, the whole maſs
is put in motion by the tides at the ſame time;
and that, in a fluid globe, this motion would be
communicated even to the centre. The power
which occaſions the flux and reflux is penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
it acts equally upon every particle of the
maſs; ſo that the quantity of its force, at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
depths, may be determined by calculation.
Indeed, this point is ſo certain, that it admits
not of diſpute.</p>
            <p>We cannot, therefore, heſitate in pronouncing,
that the tides, the winds, and every other cauſe
of motion in the ſea, muſt produce heights and
inequalities in its bottom; and that theſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences
muſt uniformly be compoſed of regular
ſtrata, either horizontal or inclined. Theſe
heights will gradually augment; like the waves
which formed them, they will mutually reſpect
each other; and, if the extent of the baſe be
great, in a track of years, they will form a vaſt
chain of mountains. Whenever eminences are
formed, they interrupt the uniform motion of
the waters, and produce new motions, known
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0195400701:48"/>
by the name of currents. Between two neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
heights in the bottom of the ocean,
there muſt be a current<note n="*" place="bottom">Proofs, art. XIII.</note>, which will follow
their common direction, and, like a river, cut a
channel, the angles of which will be alternately
oppoſite through the whole extent of its courſe.
Theſe heights muſt continually increaſe; for,
during the flow, the water will depoſite its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
ſediment upon their ridges, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which are impelled by the current will force
along, from great diſtances, quantities of matter,
which will ſubſide between the hills, and, at the
ſame time, ſcoup out a valley with correſponding
angles at their foundation. Now, by means of
theſe different motions and ſediments, the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the ocean, though formerly ſmooth,
muſt ſoon be furrowed, and interſperſed with
hills and chains of mountains, as we actually
find it at preſent. The ſoft materials of which
the eminences were originally compoſed, would
gradually harden by their own gravity. Such
of them as conſiſted of ſandy and cryſtalline
particles, would produce thoſe enormous maſſes
of rock and flint in which we find cryſtals and
other precious ſtones. Others, compoſed of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particles mixed with ſhells, give riſe to thoſe
beds of lime-ſtone and marble, in which vaſt
quantities of ſea-ſhells are ſtill found incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Laſtly, all our beds of marle and chalk have
derived their origin from particles of ſhells mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0195400701:49"/>
with a pure earth, collected and depoſited at
particular places in the bottom of the ſea. All
theſe ſubſtances are diſpoſed in regular ſtrata;
they all contain heterogenous matter, and vaſt
quantities of ſea-bodies ſituated nearly in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to their ſpecific gravities. The lighter
ſhells are found in chalk; the heavier in clay
and lime-ſtone. Theſe ſhells are uniformly fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the matter in which they are found,
whether it be ſtone or earth; an inconteſtible
proof, that they have been tranſported along
with the matter which fills and ſurrounds them,
and that this matter was then in the form of an
impalpable powder. In a word, all thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
the horizontal ſituation of which has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſen
from the waters of the ſea, invariably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their original poſition.</p>
            <p>It may here be objected, that moſt hills whoſe
ſummits conſiſt rocks of moor-ſtone, or
of marble, are founded upon ſmall eminences,
compoſed of leſs heavy materials, of clay, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
or of light ſand, the ſtrata of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
extend over the neighbouring plains. If
the above theory be juſt, what could bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
an arrangement ſo ſingular, ſo contrary to
the laws of gravity? But this phaenomenon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of an eaſy and natural explication. The
waters would operate firſt upon the upper ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
either of coaſts, or the bottom of the ſea:
This upper ſtratum conſiſts generally of clay or
ſand; and theſe light ſubſtances, being carried
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0195400701:50"/>
off and depoſited previous to the more denſe and
ſolid, they would of courſe from ſmall eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and become foundations for the more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
particle to reſt upon. After the light ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
ſubſtances are removed, the harder and
more ponderous would next be ſubjected to the
attrition of the water, reduced to a fine powder,
and carried off and depoſited above the hillocks of
ſand or clay. Theſe ſmall ſtony particles would,
in a ſucceſſion of ages, form thoſe ſolid rocks
which we now find on the tops of hills and
mountains. As particles of ſtone are heavier
than ſand or clay, it is probable that they were
originally covered and preſſed by ſuperior ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
of conſiderable depth; but that they now oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy
the higheſt ſtations, becauſe they were laſt
tranſported by the waves.</p>
            <p>To confirm this reaſoning, let us inveſtigate
more minutely the ſituation of thoſe materials
which compoſe the ſuperficial part of the globe,
the only part of which we have any adequate
knowledge. The different ſtrata of ſtones in
quarries are almoſt all horizontal or regualrly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.
Thoſe founded upon hard clay, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſolid matter, are evidently horizontal, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in plains. The diſpoſition of quarries,
where flint or browniſh free-ſtone are found in
detached portions, is indeed leſs regular. But
even here the uniformity of nature is not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;
for the horizontal or regularly inclining
poſition of the ſtrata is apparent in granite and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0195400701:51"/>
brown free-ſtone, wherever they exiſt in large
connected maſſes. This poſition is univerſal,
excepting in flint and brown free-ſtone in ſmall
detached portions, ſubſtances, the formation of
which we ſhall demonſtrate to have been poſterior
to thoſe juſt now mentioned. The ſtrata of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
vitrifiable ſand, clays, marbles, calcareous
ſtones, chalk, and marles, are always parallel or
equally inclined. In theſe the original forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is eaſily diſcoverable; for the ſtrata are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
horizontal, and very thin, being placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
each other like the leaves of a book. Beds
of ſand, of ſoft and hard clay, of chalk, and of
ſhells, are likewiſe either horizontal or uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inclined. Strata of every kind preſerve the
ſame thickneſs through their whole extent, which
is often many leagues, and might, by proper
obſervations, be traced ſtill farther. In a word,
the diſpoſition of ſtrata, as deep as mankind have
hitherto penetrated, is the ſame.</p>
            <p>Thoſe beds of ſand and gravel which are
waſhed down from mountains muſt, in ſome
meaſure, be excepted from the general rule.
They are ſometimes of a conſiderable extent in
valleys, and are ſituated immediately under the
ſoil, or firſt ſtratum. In plains, they are level,
like the more antient and interior ſtrata. But
near the bottom, or upon the ridges of hills,
they have an inclination correſponding to that
of the ground upon which they have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited.
As theſe beds of ſand and gravel are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0195400701:52"/>
formed by rivers and brooks, which, eſpecially
in the valleys, often change their channels, it is
not ſurpriſing that they ſhould be ſo frequent.
A ſmall rivulet is ſufficient, in a courſe of time,
to ſpread a bed of ſand or gravel over a very
large valley. In a champaign country, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with hills, whoſe baſe, as well as the upper
ſtratum of the plain, conſiſted of a hard clay, I
have often obſerved, that, above the origin of
the brooks or rivers, the clay was ſituated imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
under the vegetable ſtratum; but, in the
low grounds, there was a ſtratum of ſand, about
a foot thick above the clay, extending to a great
diſtance from the banks of the rivers. The ſtrata
formed by rivers are not very antient; they
are eaſily diſtinguiſhed by their frequent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
and the inequality in thickneſs, which
is conſtantly varying; but the antient ſtrata
uniformly preſerve the ſame dimenſions through
their whole extent. Beſides, theſe modern ſtrata
may be diſtinguiſhed, with certainty, by the
form of the ſtones and gravel they contain,
which bear evident marks of having been roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſmoothed, and rounded by the motion of
water. The ſame obſervation may be made with
regard to thoſe beds of turf, and corrupted ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables,
which are found in marſhy grounds,
immediately below the ſoil: They have no claim
to antiquity, but have derived their exiſtence
from ſucceſſive accumulations of decayed trees,
and other plants. The ſtrata of ſlime, or mud,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0195400701:53"/>
which occur in many places, are alſo recent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
having been formed by ſtagnating wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or the inundations of rivers. They are not
ſo exactly horizontal, or ſo uniformly inclined,
as the more antient ſtrata, produced by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
motions of the ſea. In ſtrata formed by
rivers, we meet with river, but ſeldom with ſea
ſhells; and the few that occur are broken, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached,
and placed without order. But, in the
antient ſtrata, there are no river-ſhells; the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhells
are numerous, well preſerved, and all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the ſame manner, having been tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and depoſited at the ſame time, and by the
ſame cauſe. From whence could this beautiful
regularity proceed? Inſtead of regular ſtrata,
why do we not find the matters compoſing the
earth huddled together without order? Why are
not rocks, marbles, clays, marles, &amp;c. ſcattered
promiſcuouſly, or joined by irregular or vertical
ſtrata? Why are not heavy bodies uniformly
found in a lower ſituation than light ones? It is
eaſy to perceive, that this uniformity of nature,
this ſpecies of organization, this union of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
materials by parallel ſtrata, without regard
to their weights, could only proceed from a
cauſe equally powerful and uniform as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the ſea, produced by regular winds, or
by the flux and reflux, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe cauſes act with ſuperior force under
the equator than in other climates; for there
the tides are higher, and the winds more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0195400701:54"/>
The moſt extenſive chains of mountains
are likewiſe in the neighbourhood of the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
The mountains of Africa and Peru are the
higheſt in the world, often extending through
whole continents, and ſtretching to great diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
under the waters of the ocean. The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Europe and Aſia, which extend from
Spain to China, are not ſo elevated as thoſe of
Africa and South America. According to the
relations of voyagers, the mountains of the north
are but ſmall hills, when compared to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the equatorial regions. Beſides, in the
northern ſeas, there are few iſlands; but, in the
Torrid Zone, they are innumerable. Now, as
iſlands are only the ſummits of mountains, it is
apparent, that there are more inequalities on the
ſurface of the earth, near the equator, than in
northerly climates.</p>
            <p>Thoſe prodigious chains of mountains which
run from weſt to eaſt in the Old Continent, and
from north to ſouth in the New, muſt have been
formed by the general motion of the tides. But
the origin of the leſs conſiderable mountains
and hills, muſt be aſcribed to particular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
occaſioned by winds, currents, and other
irregular agitations of the ſea: Their formation
may, indeed, be owing to a combination of all
thoſe motions, which are capable of infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations;
for the winds, and the ſituation of
different iſlands and coaſts, conſtantly change
the natural courſe of the tides, making them
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0195400701:55"/>
run in every poſſible direction. It is, therefore,
by no means ſurpriſing to ſee conſidrable
eminences having no determined direction in
their courſes. But, for our preſent purpoſe, it
is ſufficient to have ſhown, that mountains have
not been produced by earthquakes, or other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
cauſes, but that they are effects equally
reſulting from the general laws of nature, as
their peculiar ſtructure, and the ſituation of the
materials of which they are compoſed.</p>
            <p>But how has it happened, that this earth,
which we and our anceſtors have inhabited for
ages, which, from time immemorial, has been
an immenſe continent, dry, compact, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the reach of the water, ſhould, if
formerly the bottom of an ocean, be now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
to ſuch a height above the waters, and ſo
compleatly ſeparated from them? Since the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
remaiend ſo long upon the earth, why have
they now deſerted it? What accident, what
cauſe, could introduce a change ſo great? Is it
even poſſible to conceive a cauſe poſſeſſed of
power ſufficient to operate ſuch an amazing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?</p>
            <p>Theſe are difficult queſtions. But, as the
facts are uncontrovertible, the preciſe manner
in which they have happened may remain a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
without prejudice to the concluſions which
ought to be drawn from them. A little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
however, will furniſh us at leaſt with
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0195400701:56"/>
plauſible ſolutions<note n="*" place="bottom">See proofs, art. XIX.</note>. We daily obſerve the ſea
gaining ground on certain coaſts, and loſing it
on others. We know, that the ocean has a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and uniform motion from eaſt to weſt;
that it makes violent efforts againſt the rocks
and low grounds which encircle it; that there
are whole provinces which human induſtry can
hardly defend from the fury of the waves; and
that there are inſtances of iſlands which have
but lately emerged from the waters, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
inundations. Hiſtory informs us of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations
and deluges of a more extenſive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Ought not all this to convince us, that
the ſurface of the earth has experienced very
great revolutions, and that the ſea may have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
given up poſſeſſion of the greateſt part of
the ground which it formerly occupied? For
example, let us ſuppoſe, that the Old and New
worlds were formerly but one continent, and
that, by a violent earthquake, the antient Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantis
of Plato was ſunk. What would be the
conſequence of ſuch a mighty revolution? The
ſea would neceſſarily ruſh in from all quarters,
and form what is now called the Atlantic Ocean;
and vaſt continents, perhaps thoſe which we
now inhabit, would, of courſe, be left dry. This
great revolution might be effected by the ſudden
failure of ſome immenſe cavern in the interior
part of the globe, and an univerſal deluge would
infallibly ſucceed. I would rather incline to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0195400701:57"/>
think, that ſuch a revolution would not be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
accompliſhed, but that it required a very
long period. However theſe conjectures ſtand,
it is certain, that the revolution has happened,
and I even believe that it happened naturally;
for, if a judgment of the future is to be formed
from the paſt, we have only to attend carefully
to what daily paſſes before our eyes. It is a
fact, eſtabliſhed by the repeated obſervation of
voyagers, that the ocean has a conſtant motion
from eaſt to weſt. This motion, like the trade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds,
is not only perceived between the
tropics, but through the whole temperate cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
and as near the poles as navigators have
approached. As a neceſſary conſequence of this
motion, the Pacific Ocean muſt make continual
efforts againſt the coaſts of Tartary, China, and
India; the Indian Ocean muſt act againſt the
eaſt coaſt of Africa; and the Atlantic muſt act
in a ſimilar manner againſt all the eaſtern coaſts
of America. Hence the ſea muſt have gained,
and will always continue to gain on the eaſt, and
to loſe on the weſt. This of itſelf would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to prove the poſſibility of the change of
ſea into land, and of land into ſea. If ſuch is
the natural effect of the ſea's motion from eaſt
to weſt, may it not reaſonably be ſuppoſed, that
Aſia, and all the eaſtern continent, is the moſt
antient country in the world? and that Europe,
and part of Africa, eſpecially the weſt parts of
theſe continents, as Britain, France, Spain, &amp;c.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0195400701:58"/>
are countries of a more recent date? Both hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and phyſics concur in eſtabliſhing this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.</p>
            <p>But, beſides the conſtant motion of the ſea
from eaſt to weſt, other cauſes concur in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the effect juſt mentioned. There are many
lands lower than the level of the ſea, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
only by a narrow iſthmus of rock, or by
banks of ſtill weaker materials. The action of
the waters muſt gradually deſtroy theſe barriers,
and, conſequently, ſuch lands muſt then become
part of the ocean. Beſides, the mountains are
daily diminiſhing, part of them being conſtantly
carried down to the valleys by rains. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
well known, that every little brooke carries
earth, and other matters, from the high grounds
into the rivers, by which they are at laſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to the ocean. By theſe means, the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the ſea is gradually filling up, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the earth is approaching to a level, and
nothing but time is wanting for the ſea's ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
changing places with the land.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak not here of cauſes removed beyond
the ſphere of our knowledge, of thoſe convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of nature, the ſlighteſt throe of which
would be fatal to the globe. The near approach
of a comet, the abſence of the moon, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
of a new planet into the ſyſtem, &amp;c.
are ſuppoſitions upon which the imagination
may rove at large. Cauſes of this kind will
produce any effect we chuſe. From a ſingle hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0195400701:59"/>
of this nature, a thouſand phyſical ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
might be drawn, and their authors might
dignify them with the title of <hi>Theory of the
Earth.</hi> As an hiſtorian, I reject theſe vain ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations:
They depend upon mere poſſibilities,
which, if called into action, neceſſarily imply
ſuch a devaſtation in the univerſe, that our
globe, like a fugitive particle of matter, eſcapes
our obſervation, and is no longer worthy of our
attention. But, to give conſiſtency to our ideas,
we muſt take the earth as it is, examine its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
parts with minuteneſs, and, by induction,
judge of the future, from what at preſent exiſts.
We ought not to be affected by cauſes which
ſeldom act, and whoſe action is always ſudden
and violent. Theſe have no place in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
courſe of nature. But operations uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repeated, motions which ſucceed one another
without interruption, are the cauſes which alone
ought to be the foundation of our reaſoning.</p>
            <p>Some examples ſhall be given: We ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
particular effects with general cauſes, and
give a detail of facts, which will illuſtrate and
explain the different alterations that the earth
has undergone, whether by irruptions of the ſea
upon the land, or by the ſea's retiring from
lands which it formerly covered.</p>
            <p>That irruption which gave riſe to the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean<note n="*" place="bottom">Proofs. art. XI. and XIX. p. 209.; Plot. Hiſt. Nat. &amp;c.</note>,
is undoubtedly the greateſt<note n="†" place="bottom">Ray's Diſcourſes,</note>. The
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0195400701:60"/>
ocean runs with prodigious rapidity through a
narrow paſſage between two promontories<note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. Tranſ. abridged, vol. 2. p. 289. Siculus, Strabo.</note>, and
then forms a vaſt ſea, which, excluſive of the
Black Sea, is about ſeven times larger than the
kingdom of France. The motion through the
Straits of Gibraltar is contrary to the motion in
every other ſtrait. The general motion of the
ſea is from eaſt to weſt; but, in the Straits of
Gibraltar, it is from weſt to eaſt: An inconteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
proof, that the Mediterranean Sea is not an
antient gulf, but that it has been formed by an
irruption, produced by ſome accidental cauſe,
ſuch as an earthquake ſwallowing up the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,
or a violent effort of the ocean, occaſioned
by the wind's forcing its way through the bank,
between the two promotories of Gibraltar and
Ceuta. This opinion is ſupported by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the antients<note n="†" place="bottom">Diodorus</note>, who inform us, that
there was a time when the Mediterranean had
no exiſtence. It is likewiſe confirmed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
hiſtory, and by obſervations upon the ſtrata
in the oppoſite coaſts of Africa and Spain,
where, as in neighbouring mountains, the beds
of earth and ſtone are preciſely the ſame at the
ſame levels.</p>
            <p>When the ocean forced this paſſage, it ran
through the Straits with much more rapidity
than at preſent, and inſtantly deluged that large
tract of land which formerly jointed Europe to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0195400701:61"/>
Africa. The waters covered all the grounds
which were lower than the level of the ocean;
and no part of them is now to be ſeen, except
the tops of ſome of the mountains, ſuch as part
of Italy, Sicily, Malta, Corſica, Sardinia, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,
Rhodes, and the iſlands of the Archipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lago.</p>
            <p>I have not mentioned the Black Sea as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of this irruption; becauſe the quantity of
water it receives from the Danube, the Nieper,
the Don, and other rivers, is more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
both to form and ſupport it. Beſides, it
runs with great rapidity through the Boſphorus
into the Mediterranean<note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. Tranſ abridged, vol. 2. p. 289.</note>. It may even be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
that the Black and Caſpian Seas were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two large lakes, which were perhaps joined
by a narrow communication, or rather by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs,
or ſmall lake, uniting the Don and the
Wolga about Tria, where theſe two rivers run
very near each other. It is likewiſe probable,
that theſe two ſeas, or lakes, were formerly of
a much greater extent; for the large rivers
which fall into the Black and Caſpian Seas muſt
have gradually brought down a quantity of earth
and ſand ſufficient to ſtop up the communication,
and to form that neck of land by which theſe
two ſeas are divided. We know, that large ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
in a courſe of time, block up ſeas, and form
new lands, as in the province at the mouth of
the Yellow river in China; Louiſiana at the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0195400701:62"/>
mouth of the Miſſiſippi; and the northern part
of Aegypt, which derived its exiſtence<note n="*" place="bottom">Shaw's Travels.</note> from the
inundations of the Nile<note n="†" place="bottom">Proofs, art. XIX.</note>. Such quantities of
earth are brought down, by the rapidity of the
Nile, from the interior parts of Africa, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited
during the inundations, that you may
dig fifty feet deep before you can reach the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the ſlime and mud. Louiſiana, and the
province of the Yellow river have, in the ſame
manner, been original formed by the ſlime
of rivers.</p>
            <p>Farther, the Caſpian Sea is a real lake. It has
no communication with any other ſea, not even
with the Lake Aral, which appears to have
been a part of it, being only ſeparated by a large
tract of ſand, in which neither river nor canal
for carrying off the waters have been diſcovered.
This ſea, therefore, has no external communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with any other; and I doubt much if there
is any reaſon to ſuſpect a ſubterraneous commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
with the Black Sea, or with the Gulf
of Perſia. The Caſpian, it is true, receives the
Wolga, and ſeveral other rivers, which appear
to furniſh as much water as is loſt by evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But, independent of the difficulties attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch calculations, if it communicates with any
other ſea, a uniform and rapid current towards
the place of communication would be an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
conſequence; but no ſuch thing has yet
been diſcovered. Travellers of the beſt credit
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0195400701:63"/>
aſſure us of the contrary; we, therefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the Caſpian Sea receives juſt as much
water from the rivers and clouds as it loſes by
evaporation.</p>
            <p>It is not improbable, that the Black Sea will,
ſome time or other, be entirely divided from the
Mediterranean; and that the Boſphorus will be
chocked up, whenever the rivers ſhall have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated
a ſufficient quantity of materials to
bring about that effect. It is impoſſible to ſix
the aera of this event; but time, and the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of waters in rivers, in proportion as the
mountains are lowered by the cauſes mentioned
above, will one day exhibit this phaenomenon to
the world.</p>
            <p>The Caſpian and Black Seas ſhould, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
be conſidered rather as lakes than as gulfs
of the ocean; becauſe they exactly reſemble o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lakes that receive a number of rivers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any viſible outlet, as the Dead Sea, ſeveral
lakes in Africa, and elſewhere. Beſides, the ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of theſe two ſeas is not nearly equal to that
of the Mediterranean or the ocean; and it is an
agreed point, that the navigation in the Caſpian
and Black ſeas, on account of their numberleſs
ſhoals, rocks, and banks, is ſo extremely hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that only ſmall veſſels can be uſed in them
with ſafety. This circumſtance proves farther,
that theſe ſeas ought not to be conſidered as gulfs
of the ocean, but as vaſt collections of water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſed
by large rivers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0195400701:64"/>
If the iſthmus which ſeparates Africa from
Aſia were cut, it would neceſſarily create a great
irruption of the ſea upon the land. This was
formerly projected by the Kings of Aegypt, and
adopted ſince by the Califs. I doubt whether
the pretended communication between the Red
Sea and Mediterranean be ſufficiently eſtabliſhed.
The Red Sea is a narrow branch of the ocean:
Through its whole extent, not a ſingle river runs
into it from the Aegyptian ſide, and very few
from the oppoſite. This ſea will not, therefore,
be ſubject to diminution, like thoſe ſeas or lakes
which are actually impaired by the ſlime and
ſand brought down by large rivers. The Red
Sea receives all its waters directly from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,
and the motion of the tides in it are very
diſcernible; of courſe, it muſt be affected by the
general motions of the ocean. The Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean,
on the other hand, muſt be lower than the
ocean; becauſe the current through the Straits is
exceedingly rapid. Beſides, it receives the Nile,
which runs parallel to the weſt coaſt of the Red
Sea, and paſſes through the longeſt extent of
Aegypt, which is a very low country. From
theſe circumſtances, it is at leaſt probable, that
the Red Sea is higher than the Mediterranean,
and, conſequently, that, if the iſthmus of Suez
were cut, a great inundation, and a conſiderable
augmentation of the Mediterranean, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue;
eſpecially if the waters were not reſtrained
by dikes and ſluices placed at proper diſtances.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0195400701:65"/>
This precaution was probably uſed, if ever the
antient canal exiſted.</p>
            <p>But, not to ſpend too much time on conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which, however well founded, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
appear raſh, we ſhall give ſome certain and
recent examples of the changes of ſea into land,
and of land into ſea<note n="*" place="bottom">Proofs, art. XIX.</note>. At Venice, the bottom of
the ſea is conſtantly riſing: If the canals had
not been carefully kept clean, the moats and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
would, long ere now, have formed a part of
the continent. The ſame thing may be ſaid of
moſt harbours, bays, and mouths of rivers. In
Holland, the bottom of the ſea is elevated in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places; the gulf of Zuderzee and the ſtraits
of the Texel, cannot receive ſuch large veſſels
as formerly. At the mouth of almoſt every ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
we find ſmall iſlands, and banks of earth
and ſand brought down from the higher grounds;
and it is uncontravertible, that the ſea is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
dammed up, wherever great rivers empty
themſelves. The Rhine is loſt in the ſands
which itſelf has accumulated. The Danube, the
Nile, and all large rivers, after having tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
great quantities of ſlime, ſand, &amp;c. never more
arrive at the ſea by a ſingle channel; they ſplit
into branches, the intervals of which conſiſt of
the materials which they themſelves have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.
Marſhes are daily drained; lands, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
by the ſea, are now plowed and ſown;
we navigate whole countries now covered by the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0195400701:66"/>
waters; in a word, we ſee ſo many inſtances of
land changed into water, and water into land,
that we muſt be convinced of the continual,
though ſlow progreſs of ſuch changes in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
So that, in time, the gulfs of the ocean will
become continents; the iſthmuſes will be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into ſtraits; and the tops of the mountains
will be metamorphoſed into ſhoaly rocks in the
ſea.</p>
            <p>The waters, then, have covered, and may ſtill
cover, every part of the earth which is now dry.
Our aſtoniſhment at finding the productions of
the ſea diſperſed every where, and a compoſition
of bodies which could not be effected by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
means than the operation of the waters,
ought forever to ceaſe. We have already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
how the horizontal ſtrata of the earth
were formed. But thoſe perpendicular ſiſſures,
which are equally diffuſed through rocks, clays,
and every conſtituent material of the globe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to be conſidered. The perpendicular fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
are indeed placed at greater diſtances from
each other than the horizontal; and the ſofter
the matter, the more diſtant are the fiſſures. In
marble and hard ſtone, the fiſſures are only a
few feet aſunder. If the maſs of rock be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive,
the diſtance betwixt the fiſſures is ſome
fathoms: Sometimes they extend from the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the baſe of the rock, and ſometimes they
terminate after arriving at a horizontal fiſſure.
They are uniformly perpendicular in the ſtrata
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0195400701:67"/>
of all calcareous ſubſtances, as chalk, marles,
marble, &amp;c. But they are more oblique and
leſs regularly ſituated, in vitreſcent bodies, brown
free-ſtone, and rocks of flint, where they are
often adorned with cryſtals and other minerals.
In quarries of marble, or of calcareous ſtone, the
fiſſures at filled with ſpar, gypſum, gravel, and
an earthy ſand, which contains a conſiderable
portion of chalk. In marles, and every other
ſpecies of earth, except ſand-ſtone, the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
fiſſures are either empty or filled with
ſuch matters as have been tranſported thither by
water.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of perpendicular fiſſures is eaſily
inveſtigated. As various materials conſtituting
the different ſtrata were tranſported by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and depoſited in the form of ſediments,
they would at firſt be in a very diluted ſtate, and
would gradually harden and part with the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
quantity of water they contained. In
the proceſs of drying, they would naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and of courſe ſplit at irregular diſtances.
Theſe fiſſures neceſſarily aſſumed a perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
direction; becauſe, in this direction, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of gravity of one particle upon another is
equal to nothing; but it acts directly oppoſite
to this deſcription in a horizontal ſituation: The
diminution in bulk could have no ſenſible effect
but in a vertical line. I ſay, the contraction of
the parts in drying, not the contained water
forcing an iſſue, as has been alledged, is the cauſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0195400701:68"/>
of perpendicular fiſſures; for I have often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,
that the ſides of thoſe fiſſures, through
their whole extent, correſpond as exactly as the
two ſides of a ſplit piece of wood. Their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces
are rude and irregular; whereas, if they
had taken their riſe from the motion of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they would have been ſmooth and poliſhed.
Hence theſe fiſſures muſt have been produced,
either ſuddenly or gradually, by drying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting,
like the cracks and fiſſures in green
wood; and the greateſt part of the water the
bodies contained, muſt have evaporated by the
pores. In the chapter upon minerals, we ſhall
demonſtrate, that ſome part of the original wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſtill remains in ſtones and ſeveral other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
and that cryſtals, minerals, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bodies, owe their exiſtence to this water.</p>
            <p>Perpendicular fiſſures vary greatly as to the
extent of their openings. Some are about half
an inch, or an inch, others a foot, or two feet;
ſome extend ſeveral fathoms, and give riſe to
thoſe vaſt precipices which ſo frequently occur
between oppoſite parts of the ſame rocks in the
Alps and other high mountains. It is plain,
that the fiſſures, the openings of which are ſmall,
have been occaſioned ſolely by drying. But
thoſe which extend ſeveral feet, are partly ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to another cauſe; namely, the ſinking of
the foundation upon one ſide, while that of the
other remains firm. If the baſe ſinks but a line
or two, when the height of the rock is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0195400701:69"/>
an opening of ſeveral feet, or even fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms,
will be the conſequence. When rocks
are founded on clay or ſand, they ſometimes
ſlip a little to a ſide; and the fiſſures are of courſe
augmented by this motion. I have not hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mentioned thoſe large openings, thoſe prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
cuts which are to be met with in rocks and
mountains: Theſe could not be produced by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other means than the ſinking of immenſe
ſubterraneous caverns that were unable longer
to ſuſtain their incumbent load. But theſe cuts
or intervals in mountains are not of the ſame
nature with perpendicular fiſſures: They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to have been ports opened by the hand of
nature for the communication of nations. This
ſeems to be the intention of all large openings
in chains of mountains, and of thoſe ſtraits by
which different parts of the ocean are connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
as the Straits of Thermopyle, of Gibral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
&amp;c.; the gaps or ports in Mount Cauca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
the Cordeliers, &amp;c. A ſimple ſeparation,
by the drying of the matter, could not produce
this effect: Large portions of earth muſt have
been ſunk, ſwallowed up, or thrown down<note n="*" place="bottom">Proofs. art. XVII.</note>.</p>
            <p>Theſe great ſinkings, though occaſioned by
accidental and ſecondary cauſes<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, are leading
facts in the hiſtory of the earth, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
greatly in changing the appearance of
its ſurface. Moſt of them have been produced
by ſubterraneous fires, the exploſions of which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0195400701:70"/>
give riſe to earthquakes and volcano's. The
force of inflamed matter ſhut up in the bowels
of the earth is irreſiſtible<note n="*" place="bottom">Agricola de rebus quae effluunt e terra. Phil. tranſ. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brid. vol. ii. p. 391. Ray's diſcourſes. p. 272.</note>. By the action of
ſubterraneous fires, whole cities have been ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up, mountains, and large tracts of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
have been overturned and rendered unfit for
the habitation of men. But, though this force
be great, though its effects appear to be prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
we cannot aſſent to the opinions of ſome
authors, who ſuppoſe that theſe ſubterraneous
fires are only branches of an immenſe abyſs of
flame in the centre of the earth. Neither do we
credit the common notion, that theſe fires have
their ſeat at a great depth below the ſurface; for
matter cannot begin to burn, or at leaſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation
cannot be ſupported, without air.
In examining the materials that iſſue from vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's,
even in their moſt violent eruptions, it
is eaſy to perceive that the furnace is not very
deep, and that the inflamed ſubſtances are the
ſame with thoſe on the top of the mountain,
only disfigured by calcination and the melting
of the metallic particles they contain. To be
convinced that the matter thrown out by vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's
do not come from any conſiderable depth,
we need only attend to the height of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and conſider the immenſe force which
would be neceſſary to project ſtones and mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
to the height of half a league; for Aetna,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0195400701:71"/>
Hecla, and other volcano's, have at leaſt that
elevation.</p>
            <p>Now, it is well known, that fire acts equally
on all ſides; it cannot, therefore, act upwards
with a force ſufficient to throw large ſtones half
a league high, without an equal re-action on
the baſe and ſides. But the ſides of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
would very ſoon be pierced and blown to
pieces by this re-action; becauſe the materials
of which it conſiſts are not more denſe or firm
than thoſe which are projected. How, then, can
it be imagined, that the cavity, which muſt be
conſidered as the tube or cannon, could poſſibly
reſiſt a force neceſſary to raiſe ſuch heavy bodies
to the mouth of the volcano? Beſides, ſuppoſe
the cavity deeper, as the external orifice is not
great, it would be impoſſible for ſo large a
quantity of liquid and burning matters to iſſue
forth at a time, without claſhing againſt each
other, and againſt the irregular ſides of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;
and, in paſſing through ſo long a ſpace,
they would be in danger of cooling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealing.
Rivers of melted ſulphur and bitumen,
projected from volcano's along with ſtones and
minerals, run from the tops of the mountains
into the plains. Is it natural to think, that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo fluid, ſo little able to reſiſt violent action,
could be projected from a very great depth?
Every obſervation which can be made on this
ſubject will tend to prove, that the fire in vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's
is not very diſtant from the tops of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0195400701:72"/>
mountains, and never deſcends ſo low as the
level of the plains<note n="*" place="bottom">Borelli de incendiis Aetnae.</note>.</p>
            <p>This account of volcano's, however, is not
inconſiſtent with their being the cauſe of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
earthquakes; neither does it contradict
the communication of one volcano with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by means of ſubtertaneous paſſages<note n="†" place="bottom">Phil. Tranſ. abridged, vol. 2. p. 392.</note>. But
the depth of the furnace is the object of our
preſent inveſtigation; and it cannot be very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
from the mouth of the volcano. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an earthquake in a plain, it is not neceſſary
that the bottom of the volcano ſhould be below
the level of that plain, nor that there ſhould be
ſubterraneous cavities filled with the ſame burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
matter under it. A violent exploſion,
with which eruptions are uniformly accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
may, like that of a powder-magazine,
give ſuch a concuſſion as to produce, by its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
an earthquake of conſiderable extent.</p>
            <p>I mean not to ſay that there are no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
which derive their exiſtence from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean
fires<note n="‡" place="bottom">Proofs, art. XVI.</note>; but that there are earthquakes
produced ſolely by the exploſion of volcano's.
In confirmation of what has been ſaid upon this
ſubject, volcano's ſeldom or never appear in
plains; on the contrary, their mouths, or cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
are always found on the tops of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
mountains. If the ſubterraneous fire of vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's
ſtretched below the plains, would not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0195400701:73"/>
new paſſages be opened there during violent
eruptions, rather than in the tops of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
where the reſiſtance is greater? In the
firſt eruption, would it not have been eaſier to
pierce a plain, than a mountain of half a league
in height?</p>
            <p>It is not difficult to diſcover the reaſon why
volcano's appear only in mountains. Greater
quantities of minerals, ſulphur, and pyrites, exiſt
in mountains, and nearer the ſurface than in
plains. The mountains have likewiſe this far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advantage; they are more ſubject to the
impreſſions of the air, and receive more rain and
moiſture, by which mineral ſubſtances are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being fermented to ſuch a degree as to
produce actual inflammation.</p>
            <p>To conclude, it has often been obſerved, that,
after violent eruptions, the mountains have ſunk
and diminiſhed, nearly in proportion to the
quantity of matter thrown out, which is another
proof that volcano's are not ſo deep as the baſe
of the mountains, and even that they are not
much below the ſummit.</p>
            <p>In many places, earthquakes have formed
conſiderable hollows, and even ſome large gaps
in mountains. All other inequalities are coeval
with the mountains themſelves, and owe their
exiſtence to currents in the ocean; for, in every
place which has not been diſturbed by acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
convulſions, the ſtrata of mountains are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0195400701:74"/>
and their angles correſpond<note n="*" place="bottom">Proofs, art. XVII.</note>. It is not
difficult to diſtinguiſh ſubterraneous caverns and
excavations formed by volcano's, from thoſe
produced by water. The latter conſiſt only of
ſolid rocks, the ſand and clay with which they
were formerly filled being carried off by water,
which is the origin of caverns in hills; for thoſe
found in plains are commonly nothing but old
pits and quarries, like the ſalt-quarries of Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht,
the mines of Poland, &amp;c. But natural
caverns are proper to the mountains; the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
or higher parts, furniſh them with water,
which afterwards iſſues out to the ſurface where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it can find a paſſage. Theſe are the ſources
of ſprings and rivers. When a large cavern of
this kind is ſuddenly filled up by the falling of
its roof, an inundation is generally the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence<note n="†" place="bottom">Phil. Tranſ. abridged, vol. 2. p. 322.</note>.</p>
            <p>From theſe facts, it is eaſy to perceive how
much ſubterraneous fires have contributed to
change both the ſurface and internal part of the
globe. This cauſe has power enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
very great effects. But it is difficult to
conceive how any ſenſible alterations upon the
land can be introduced by the winds<note n="‡" place="bottom">Proofs, art. XV.</note>. Their
dominion would appear to be confined to the
ſea. Indeed, next to the tides, nothing has ſuch
a powerful influence upon the waters; the flux
and reflux proceed with an uniform pace; their
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0195400701:75"/>
operations are always the ſame; but the action
of the winds is capricious and violent. They
ruſh on with irreſiſtible fury, and excite ſuch
impetuous commotions, that the ocean, from a
ſmooth and tranquil plain, in an inſtant is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
with waves that emulate the height of
mountains, and daſh themſelves in pieces againſt
the ſhores. The ſurface of the ocean is ſubject
to conſtant alterations from the winds. But
ought not the ſurface of the land, which has ſo
ſolid an appearance, ever to remain uninfluenced
by a cauſe of this kind? It is conſonant to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
however, that the winds raiſe mountains of
ſand in Arabia and Africa; that they overwhelm
large plains with it; and that they frequently
carry theſe ſands many leagues into the ſea, where
they accumulate in ſuch quantities as to form
banks, downs, and even iſlands<note n="*" place="bottom">Bellarmin. de aſcen. mentis in Deum. Varen. Geog. p. 282. Voyag. de Pyrand, tom. 1. p. 470.</note>. It is alſo
well known, that hurricanes are the ſcourge of
the Antilles, of Madagaſcar, and of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
where their impetuoſity is ſo great, that
they ſweep away trees, plants, and animals, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the ſoil which nouriſhed them.
They drive back, they annihilate rivers, and
produce new ones; they overthrow rocks and
mountains; they ſcoup out holes and gulphs in
the earth, and totally change the face of thoſe
unhappy countries that give birth to them. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0195400701:76"/>
few climates are expoſed to the violence of
thoſe dreadful agitations of the air.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt changes upon the ſurface of
the earth are occaſioned by rains, rivers, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
from the mountains. Theſe derive their
origin from vapours raiſed by the ſun from the
ſurface of the ocean, and which are tranſported
by the winds through every climate. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of theſe vapours, which are ſupported by
the air, and tranſported at the pleaſure of the
winds, is interrupted by the tops of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
where they accumulate into clouds, and
fall down in the form of rain, dew, or ſnow.
At firſt, theſe waters deſcended into the plains
without any fixed courſe<note n="*" place="bottom">See proofs, art. X. and XVIII.</note>; but they gradually
hollowed out proper channels for themſelves.
By the power of gravity, they ran to the bottom
of the mountains, and, penetrating or diſſolving
the lower grounds, they carried along with them
ſand and gravel, cut deep furrows in the plains,
and thus opened paſſages to the ſea, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
receives as much water by rivers, as it
loſes by evaporation. The windings in the
channels of rivers have uniformly correſponding
angles on their oppoſite banks; and, as moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and hills, which may be regarded as the
banks of the valleys by which they are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
have likewiſe ſinuoſities with correſponding
angles, this circumſtance ſeems to demonſtrate,
that the valleys have been gradually formed by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0195400701:77"/>
currents of the ocean, in the ſame manner as
the channels of rivers have been produced.</p>
            <p>The waters which run upon the ſurface, and
ſupport the verdure and fertility of the ſoil,
compoſe not perhaps one half of the quantity
that is produced by vapour. Numberleſs veins
of water ſink deep into the bowels of the earth.
In ſome places, you are certain of obtaining
water by digging; in others, none can be found.
In almoſt all the valleys and low grounds, at a
certain depth, water is uniformly to be met
with. But, in all high grounds, it is impoſſible
to extract water from the bowels of the earth.
It muſt be collected from the heavens. There
are extenſive countries where no wells can be
obtained; there men, and other animals, are
ſupplied with drink from ciſterns and pools. In
the caſt, and eſpecially in Arabia, Aegypt, and
Perſia, wells and ſprings are great and valuable
rarities. To ſupply their place, the inhabitants
have been obliged to make large reſervoirs to
collect the water that falls from the heavens.
Theſe works, projected and executed from public
neceſſity, conſtitute the moſt beautiful and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
monuments of the eaſt. Some eaſtern
reſervoirs have more than two ſquare leagues of
ſuperficies, and fertilize whole provinces by
numberleſs ducts and canals let out from all ſides.
But, in plain countries, furniſhed with large ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
it is impoſſible to break the ſurface of the
earth without finding water. In camps ſituated in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0195400701:78"/>
the neighbourhood of rivers, it often happens,
that every tent may have its own well, by giving
a few ſtrokes with a pick-ax.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the water, ſo liberally diffuſed through
low grounds, comes from the neighbouring hills
and eminences. During great rains, or the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
melting of ſnow, part of the water runs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſurface; but moſt of it penetrates the
earth and rocks, by means of ſmall chinks and
fiſſures. This water riſes again to the ſurface,
whenever it can find an iſſue; but it often drills
through ſands, and creeps along till it finds a
bottom of clay, or hard earth, and there forms
ſubterraneous lakes, brooks, and perhaps rivers,
of which the channels are for ever buried in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blivion.
Subterraneous rivers, however, muſt
follow the general law of nature, and uniformly
run from the higher to the lower ground; their
waters muſt of courſe either fall at laſt into the
ſea, or be collected in ſome low place, whether
at the ſurface, or in the bowels of the earth:
For there are ſeveral lakes which neither receive
nor give riſe to any river. A ſtill greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
receive no conſiderable river, but are the
ſources of the largeſt rivers on earth; as the
lakes from which the river St Laurence iſſues;
the lake Chiamè, from which two large rivers
ariſe, that water the kingdoms of Aſem and
Pegu; the lakes of Aſſiniboil in America; thoſe
of Ozera in Muſcovy; thoſe that give riſe to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0195400701:79"/>
the Bog and the Irtis, and many others<note n="*" place="bottom">Proofs, art. XI.</note>. It
is plain, that theſe lakes muſt derive their exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from the waters of ſuperior grounds, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
through ſubterraneous paſſages. Some,
indeed, have affirmed, that lakes are to be met
with on the tops of the higheſt mountains. But
this is incredible; for the lakes found on the
Alps, and other elevated ſituations, are all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topped
by higher mountains, and derive their
origin from the waters which run down the
ſides, or are filtered through the bowels of theſe
ſuperior eminences, in the ſame manner as the
lakes in valleys are ſupplied.</p>
            <p>From this reaſoning, the exiſtence of ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
collections of water, eſpecially under
large plains, is apparent<note n="†" place="bottom">Proofs, art. XVIII.</note>: For mountains, hills,
and heights of every kind, are expoſed on all
ſides to the weather. The waters that fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their ſummits, and upon elevated plains, after
penetrating the earth, muſt, from the declivity of
the ground, break out at many places in the form
of ſprings and fountains: Of courſe, little water
will be found in the bowels of mountains. But,
in plains, as the water filtrated through the
earth can find no iſſue, it muſt be collected in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
caverns, or diſperſed in ſmall veins,
among ſand and gravel. This is the origin of
the water ſo univerſally diffuſed through low
grounds. The bottom of a pit or well, is only
a ſmall artificial baſon, into which the water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0195400701:80"/>
itſelf from the higher grounds. At firſt
it generally falls in by drops; but afterwards,
when the paſſages become more open, it receives
freſh ſupplies from greater diſtances, and runs
in ſmall continued veins or rills. To this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
it is owing, that, although water may
be found in any part of a plain, only a certain
number of wells can be ſupplied. This number
is in proportion to the quantity of water diffuſed,
or rather to the extent of the higher grounds
from which it comes.</p>
            <p>To find water, it is unneceſſary to dig below
the level of the river. It is commonly found at
ſmaller depths. The water of rivers ſeldom
ſpreads far in the earth by filtration. Even
what is found in the earth below the level of
rivers, is not derived from them; for, in rivers
which have been dried up, or whoſe courſes have
been changed, no greater quantity of water is
obtained by digging, than in the neighbouring
ground at an equal depth. Five or ſix feet of
earth is ſufficient to contain water, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
its eſcape: I have often remarked, that the
banks of rivulets or pools have no ſenſible
moiſture at the diſtance of ſix inches from the
water. It is true, the filtration is always in
proportion to the penetrability of the ground.
But, upon examining the ſtagnating pools with
a ſandy bottom, it is remarkable that the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
ſpreads but a few inches. Neither is the
extent of it great in a vegetable ſoil, which is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0195400701:81"/>
much more looſe and porous than ſand or hard
earth. A garden-bed, though plentifully wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
communicates little or no moiſture to thoſe
adjoining. I have examined level heaps of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-earth,
of ſix or eight feet thick, which had
remained undiſturbed for ſome years, and found
that the rain-water had never reached above
three or four feet deep. I have made the ſame
obſervation upon earth which had lain 200 years
in ridges: Below the depth of three or four feet,
it was as dry as duſt. Hence the ſpreading of
water by filtration alone, is not ſo extenſive as
has generally been imagined. Very little can
deſcend in this way to the bowels of the earth.
But water, by its own gravity, deſcends from the
ſurface to the greateſt depths. It ſinks through
natural conduits, or forces paſſages for itſelf: It
follows the roots of trees, the ſiſſures of rocks,
or their interſtices. It divides and expands on
all hands into an infinite number of ſmall branches
or rills; and uniformly deſcends till its progreſs
is ſtopped by clay or a ſolid earth, where it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulates
and breaks out to the ſurface in form
of a ſpring or fountain.</p>
            <p>It would be no eaſy taſk to make an exact
calculation of the quantity of ſubterraneous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which have no apparent iſſue<note n="*" place="bottom">Proofs, art. X. XI. and XVIII.</note>. Many
pretend that it greatly ſurpaſſes all the waters
on the ſurface: Not to mention thoſe who think
that the interior part of the globe is entirely fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0195400701:82"/>
with water, it is imagined by ſome, that
there is an infinite number of rivers, rills, and
lakes, in the bowels of the earth. But this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ſeems to have no proper foundation; and
it is probable, that the quantity of ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
waters which never appear at the ſurface, is
very inconſiderable; for, if the number of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
rivers were ſo great, Why do we
never ſee any of their mouths break out, like
ſprings, on the ſurface? Beſides, rivers produce
conſiderable changes on the ſurface of the earth;
they carry off the ſoil; they wear away the moſt
ſolid rocks, and remove every thing that oppoſes
their paſſage. The ſame effects would reſult from
ſubterraneous rivers. But no ſuch changes have
ever been diſcovered; nothing below the ſurface
is diſplaced; the different ſtrata every where
preſerve their parallel and primitive poſition;
and it is only in very few places that ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
veins of water, of any conſideration,
have been diſcovered. Thus, the internal ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of water, though great, is not affected by
the motion of it in large bodies: As it is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into an infinity of ſmall veins, which are
often ſhut up by numberleſs obſtacles, it gives
riſe to many ſubſtances, which are totally differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
both in form and ſtructure, from thoſe of
the primitive matter.</p>
            <p>From what has been advanced, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the flux and reflux of the ocean have
produced all the mountains, valleys, and other
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0195400701:83"/>
inequalities on the ſurface of the earth; that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of the ſea have ſcouped out the valleys,
elevated the hills, and beſtowed on them their
correſponding directions; that the ſame waters
of the ocean, by tranſporting and depoſiting
earth, &amp;c. have given riſe to the parallel ſtrata;
that the waters from the heavens gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the effects of the ſea, by continually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing
the height of the mountains, filling
up the valleys, and choaking the mouths of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
and, by reducing every thing to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
level, they will, in time, reſtore the earth to
the ſea, which, by its natural operations, will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
create new continents, interſperſed with
mountains and valleys, and every way ſimilar to
thoſe which we now inhabit.</p>

               <p>NATURAL hiſtory being our ſubject, we

related to the heavenly bodies, and as obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of this kind illuſtrate more fully thoſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
we have already advanced, it is neceſſary to
give ſome general ideas of the formation, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and figure of the earth, and other planets.</p>
               <p>The earth is a globe of about 3000 leagues in
diameter; it is ſituated 30 million of leagues from
the ſun, round which it revolves in 365 days.
This annual revolution is the effect of two
forces; the one may be conſidered as an impulſe
from right to left, or from left to right; the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0195400701:85"/>
other as an attraction from above downwards, or
from below upwards, to a common centre. The
direction and quantity of theſe forces are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined,
and ſo nicely adjuſted, that they produce
a uniform motion in an ellipſe approaching to
a circle. Like the other planets, the earth is
opaque, throws out a ſhadow, and reflects the
rays of the ſun, about which it revolves in a
time proportioned to its relative diſtance and
denſity. It likewiſe revolves about its own axis
in 24 hours; and its axis is inclined to the plane
of its orbit 66½ degrees. Its figure is that of a
ſpheroid, the two axes of which differ from each
other about 165th part; and it revolves round
the ſhorteſt axis.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the principal phaenomena of the
earth, the reſults of diſcoveries made by means
of geometry, aſtronomy, and navigation. It is
unneceſſary here to enumerate the proofs and
obſervations by which theſe facts have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed.
We ſhall confine our remarks to
ſuch objects as are ſtill doubtful; and ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
proceed to give our ideas concerning the
formation of planets, and the changes they have
undergone, previous to their arriving at the ſtate
in which we now perceive them. To the many
ſyſtems and hypotheſes that have been framed
concerning the formation of the earth, and the
different ſtates it has paſſed through, we may be
allowed to add our own conjectures, eſpecially
as we are determined to ſupport them with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0195400701:86"/>
degree of probability; and we are the
more encouraged to deliver our notions on this
ſubject, becauſe we hope to enable the reader to
diſtinguiſh between an hypotheſis which conſiſts
only of poſſibilities, and a theory ſupported by
facts; between a ſyſtem, ſuch as we are about to
give, of the formation and primitive ſtate of the
earth, and a phyſical hiſtory of its real condition,
which has been given in the preceding diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Galileo having traced the laws of falling bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and Kepler having obſerved, that the areas
which the principal planets deſcribe in moving
round the ſun, and thoſe of the ſatellites round
the planets to which they belong, were propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to the periods of their revolutions, and
that theſe periods were as the ſquare roots of the
cubes of their diſtances from the ſun, or from
the principal planets. Newton diſcovered that the
power of gravity extended to the moon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it in its orbit; that the force of gravity
diminiſhed in exact proportion to the ſquares of
the diſtances, and, conſequently, that the moon
is attracted by the earth; that the earth, and all
planets, are attracted by the ſun; and, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that all bodies which revolve about a centre,
and deſcribe areas proportioned to the periods of
their revolution, are attracted by that luminary.
Gravity, therefore, is a general law of nature.
The planets, comets, the ſun, the earth, are all
ſubject to its laws; and it is the ſource of that
harmony which prevails in the univerſe. Nothing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0195400701:87"/>
in phyſics is better eſtabliſhed than the exiſtence
of this power in every material body. Repeated
experience has confirmed the effects of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
and the labour and ingenuity of geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters
have determined its quantity and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>This general law being once diſcovered, the
effects of it would be eaſily explained, if the
action of thoſe bodies which produce them were
not too complicated. A ſlight view of the ſolar
ſyſtem will convince us of the difficulties which
attend this ſubject. The principal planets are
attracted by the ſun, the ſun by the planets, the
ſatellites by the principal planets, and each pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
attracts all the others, and is attracted by
them. All theſe actions and re-actions vary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the quantities of matter and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and give riſe to great inequalities, and
even irregularities. How are ſo many relations
to be combined and eſtimated? Among ſuch a
number of objects, how is it poſſible to trace
any individual? Theſe difficulties, however,
have been ſurmounted; the reaſonings of theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
have been confirmed by calculation; every
obſervation has produced a new demonſtration;
and the ſyſtematic order of the univerſe is now
laid open to every man who is able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
truth from error.</p>
               <p>The force of impulſion, or what is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called the centrifugal force, is ſtill unknown;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0195400701:88"/>
but it affects not the general theory. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that, as the attractive force continually
draws all the planets towards the ſun, they
would fall in a perpendicular line into that lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary,
if they were not kept at a diſtance by
ſome other power, forcing them to move in a
ſtraight line. If, again, this impulſive force
were not counteracted by that of attraction, all
the planets would fly off in the tangents of their
reſpective orbits. This progreſſive or impulſive
force was unqueſtionably at firſt communicated
to the planets by the Supreme Being. But, in
phyſical ſubjects, we ought, as much as poſſible,
to avoid having recourſe to ſupernatural cauſes;
and, I imagine, a probable reaſon may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
for the impulſive force of the planets,
which will be agreeable to the laws of mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics,
and not more ſurpriſing than many revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that muſt have happened in the univerſe.</p>
               <p>The ſphere of the ſun's attraction is not limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the orbits of the planets, but extends to
an indefinite diſtance, always decreaſing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the ſquares of the augmented diſtances.
The comets, it is evident, which eſcape our ſight
in the heavenly regions, are, like the planets,
ſubject to the attraction of the ſun, and by it their
motions are regulated. All theſe bodies, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
of which are ſo various, move round
the ſun, and deſcribe areas proportioned to their
periods, the planets in ellipſes, more or leſs cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and the comets, in narrow ellipſes of vaſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0195400701:89"/>
extent. The motions, therefore, both of planets
and comets, are regulated by impulſive and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
forces continually acting upon them,
and obliging them to deſcribe curves. But it is
worthy of remark, that comets run through the
ſyſtem in all directions; that the inclinations of
the planes of their orbits are ſo very different,
that though, like the planets, they be ſubject to
the law of attraction, they have nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with regard to their progreſſive or impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
motions, but appear, in this reſpect, to be
abſolutely independent of each other. The pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
on the contrary, move round the ſun in
the ſame direction, and nearly in the ſame
plane, the greateſt inclination of their planes
not exceeding 7½ degrees. This ſimilarity in
the poſition and motion of the planets indicates,
that their impulſive or centrifugal forces muſt
have originated from one common cauſe.</p>
               <p>May we not conjecture, that a comet falling
into the body of the ſun might drive off ſome
parts from its ſurface, and communicate to
them a violent impulſive force, which they ſtill
retain? This conjecture appears to be as well
founded as that of Mr Leibnitz, which ſuppoſed
the earth and planets to have formerly been
ſuns; and his ſyſtem, of which an abridgement
will be given in art. V. would have been more
comprehenſive, and more conſonant to probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
if it had embraced the above idea. We
agree with him, that this effect was produced at
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0195400701:90"/>
the time when God is ſaid by Moſes to have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
the light from darkneſs; for, according
to Leibnitz, the light was ſeparated from the
darkneſs when the planets were extinguiſhed.
But, on our ſuppoſition, there was a real phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
ſeparation; becauſe the opaque bodies of the
planets were detached from the luminous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of which the ſun is compoſed.<note n="*" place="bottom">If M. de Buffon had known, that the nucleus of the ſun was a ſolid and opaque matter, a diſcovery lately made by the ingenious Dr Wilſon of Glaſgow, his hypotheſis would have laboured under fewer difficulties.</note>.</p>
               <p>This notion concerning the cauſe of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifugal
force of the planets will appear to be
leſs exceptionable, after we have collected the
analogies, and eſtimated the degrees of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
by which it may be ſupported. We ſhall
firſt mention, that the motion of the planets
have one common direction, namely, from weſt
to eaſt. By the doctrine of chances, it is eaſy
to demonſtrate, that this circumſtance makes it
as 64 to 1, that the planets could not all move
in the ſame direction, if their centrifugal forces
had not proceeded from the ſame cauſe.</p>
               <p>This probability will be greatly augmented,
if we take in the ſimilarity in the inclinations
of the planes of their orbits, which exceed not
7½ degrees; for, by calculations it has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
that it is 24 to 1 againſt any two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
being found, at the ſame time, in the moſt
diſtant parts of their orbits; and, conſequently,
24<hi rend="sup">5</hi>, or 7692624 to 1, that this effect could not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0195400701:91"/>
be produced by accident; or, what amounts to
the ſame, there is this great degree of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that the planets have been impreſſed with
one common moving force, from which they
have derived this ſingular poſition. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could beſtow this common centrifugal
motion, excepting the force and direction of the
bodies by which it was originally communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
We may, therefore, conclude, that all the
planets have probably received their centrifugal
motion by one ſingle ſtroke. Having eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this degree of probability, which almoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to a certainty, I next inquire what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
bodies could produce this effect; and I can
find nothing but comets capable of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
motion to ſuch vaſt maſſes.</p>
               <p>Upon examining the courſe of comets, it is
eaſy to believe that ſome of them muſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally
fall into the ſun. The comet 1680 ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
ſo near, that, at its perihelion, it was
not more diſtant from the ſun than a ſixteenth
part of its diameter; and, if it returns, which is
extremely probable, in the year 2255, it may
then fall into the ſun. This muſt depend upon
the accidents it meets with in its courſe, and the
retardations it ſuffers in paſſing through the ſun's
atmoſphere<note n="*" place="bottom">See Newt. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</note>.</p>
               <p>We may, therefore, preſume, with the great
Newton, that comets ſometimes fall into the
ſun. But they may fall in different directions.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0195400701:92"/>
If they fall perpendicularly, or in a direction
not very oblique, they will remain in the body
of the ſun, ſerve the purpoſes of feuel, and, by
their impulſe, remove the ſun from his place,
in proportion to the quantity of matter they
contain<note n="*" place="bottom">Quaer. Would not ſuch an event, by augmenting the ſun's quantity of matter, and, conſequently, his attractive power, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce other changes in the ſolar ſyſtem?</note> But, if a comet falls in a very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique
direction, which will moſt frequently
happen, it will only graze the ſurface, or pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
to no great depth. In this caſe, it may
force its way paſt the ſun, detach certain por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his body, to which it will communicate
a common impulſive motion; and theſe portions
puſhed off from the ſun, and even the comet
itſelf, may turn planets, which will revolve
round this luminary in the ſame direction, and
nearly in the ſame plane. A calculation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
might be made of the quantity of matter,
velocity, and direction, a comet ought to have,
in order to force from the ſun maſſes equal to
thoſe which compoſe the ſix planets and their
ſatellites. But it is ſufficient here to obſerve,
that the whole planets, with their ſatellites,
make not a 650th part of the ſun's maſs<note n="†" place="bottom">See Newt. p. 405.</note>; for,
although the denſity of Saturn and Jupiter be
leſs than that of the ſun, and though the earth
be four times, and the moon near five times
more denſe than the ſun; yet they are only
atoms when compared to his immenſe volume.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0195400701:93"/>
It muſt be acknowledged, that, although a
650th part of a whole may ſeem inconſiderable,
it would require a very large comet to detach
this part from the ſun. But, if we conſider the
prodigious rapidity of comets in their perihelion,
the near approach they make to the ſun; the
denſity and the ſtrong coheſion of parts neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to ſuſtain, without deſtruction, the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
heat they undergo; and the ſolid and
brilliant nucleus which ſhines through their dark
atmoſpheres; it cannot be doubted that comets
are compoſed of matters extremely denſe and
ſolid; that they contain, in ſmall limits, a great
quantity of matter; and, conſequently, that a
comet of no enormous ſize may remove the ſun
from his place, and give a projectile motion to
a maſs of matter equal to the 650th part of his
body. This remark correſponds with what we
know concerning the reſpective denſities of the
planets, which always decreaſe in proportion to
their diſtances from the ſun, having leſs force of
heat to reſiſt. Accordingly, Saturn is leſs denſe
than Jupiter, and Jupiter much leſs than the
earth. Thus, if the denſity of the planets, as
Newton alledges, be in proportion to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of heat they ſupport, Mercury will be ſeven
times denſer than the earth, and 28 times denſer
than the ſun, and the comet 1680 28,000 times
more denſe than the earth, or 112,000 times
denſer than the ſun. Now, ſuppoſing the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of matter in this comet to be equal to a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0195400701:94"/>
ninth part of the ſun, or, allowing it to be only
100dth part of the bulk of the earth, its quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of matter would ſtill be equal to a 900dth
part of the ſun: Hence a body of this kind,
which would be but a ſmall comet, might puſh
off from the ſun a 900dth or a 650th part, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when the amazing rapidity of comets, in
their perihelion, is taken into the calculation.</p>
               <p>The correſpondence between the denſity of
the whole planets, and that of the ſun, deſerves
alſo to be noticed. Upon and near the ſurface
of the earth, there are ſubſtances 1400 or 1500
times denſer than others; the denſities of air
and gold are nearly in this proportion. But the
interior parts of the earth and planets are more
uniform, and differ little with regard to denſity;
and the correſpondence in the denſity of the
planets and that of the ſun is ſo great, that, out
of 650 parts, which comprehends the whole
denſity of the planets, there are more than 640
nearly of the ſame denſity with the ſolar mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and there are only ten of thoſe 650 that
are of a ſuperior denſity; for the denſity of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
and Jupiter is nearly the ſame with that
of the ſun; and the quantity of matter in thoſe
two planets is at leaſt 64 times greater than
what is contained in the four inferior planets,
Mars, the Earth, Venus, and Mercury. We
may, therefore, conclude, that, in general, the
matter of the planets is very nearly of the ſame
kind with the ſolar matter, and, of courſe, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0195400701:95"/>
the former may have been ſeparated from the
latter.</p>
               <p>To this theory, it may be objected, that, if the
planets had been driven off from the ſun by a
comet, in place of deſcribing circles round him,
they muſt, according to the law of projectiles,
have returned to the ſame place from whence
they had been forced; and, therefore, that the
projectile force of the planets cannot be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the impulſe of a comet.</p>
               <p>I reply, that the planets iſſued not from the
ſun in the form of globes, but in the form of
torrents, the motion of whoſe anterior particles
behoved to be accelerated by thoſe behind, and
the attraction of the anterior particles would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
accelerate the motion of the poſterior; and
that this acceleration, produced by one or both
of theſe cauſes, might be ſuch as would neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
change the original motion ariſing from the
impulſe of the comet, and that, from this cauſe,
might reſult a motion ſimilar to what takes place
in the planets, eſpecially when it is conſidered,
that the ſhock of the comets removes the ſun
out of its former ſtation. This reaſoning may
be illuſtrated by an example. Suppoſe a muſket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball
diſcharged from the top of a mountain,
and that the force of the powder was ſufficient
to puſh it beyond a ſemidiameter of the earth,
it is certain that this ball would revolve round
the earth, and return at every revolution to the
place from whence it had been diſcharged. But,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0195400701:96"/>
inſtead of a muſket-ball, if a rocket were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
the continued action of the fire would
greatly accelerate the original impulſive motion.
This rocket would by no means return to the
ſame point, like the ball; but, <hi>caeter is paribus,</hi>
would deſcribe an orbit, the perigee of which
would be more or leſs diſtant from the earth in
proportion to the greatneſs of the change pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in its direction by the accelerating force
of the fire. In the ſame manner, if the original
projectile force impreſſed by the comet on the
torrent of ſolar matter was accelerated, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that the planets formed by this torrent
acquired their circular or elliptical movements
around the ſun.</p>
               <p>The appearances exhibited in great eruptions
from volcano's may give ſome idea of this acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
of motion. When Veſuvius begins to
groan and throw out inflamed matter, it has been
often remarked, that the motion of the cloud
firſt ejected is flower than the ſucceeding ones,
and that they go on increaſing in celerity, till at
laſt ſulphur, lava, melted metal, and huge ſtones
are thrown up; and that, though theſe obſerve
nearly the ſame direction, they alter conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
that of the firſt cloud, and elevate it to a
greater height than it would otherwiſe have
reached<note n="*" place="bottom">This reaſoning is ingenious; but its ſolidity is ſuſpicious. The evomitions from volcano's, and the elevation the matter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, are effects of ſucceſſive impulſes. The impulſe from a comet upon the ſun muſt neceſſarily be ſingle and inſtantaneous; which ſeems to weaken the analogy which the author means to eſtabliſh.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0195400701:97"/>
The objection will be ſtill farther obviated, if
it is conſidered, that the impulſe of the comet
muſt, in ſome degree, have communicated a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the ſun, and removed it from its former
ſituation; and that, although this motion may
now be ſo ſmall as to eſcape the notice of aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers,
it may ſtill, however, exiſt, and make
the ſun deſcribe a curve round the center of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the ſyſtem. If this be allowed, as I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
it will, the planets, inſtead of returning to
the ſun's body, would deſcribe orbits, the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helions
of which would be as diſtant from the
ſun as the ſpace which he preſently occupies is
diſtant from his original ſtation.</p>
               <p>It may be further objected, that, if motion
be accelerated in the ſame direction, no change
in the perihelion could take place. But, is it
credible, that no change of direction can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in a torrent whoſe particles ſucceed each
other? On the contrary, it is extremely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that a change was actually produced ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to cauſe the planets move in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
orbits.</p>
               <p>It may ſtill be objected, that, if the ſituation
of the ſun had been changed by the ſhock of a
comet, it would move uniformly; and, of courſe,
this motion being common to the whole ſyſtem,
no alteration would be effected. But, previous
to the ſhock, might not the ſun move round
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0195400701:98"/>
the centre of the cometary ſyſtem; and might
not this primary motion be augmented or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
by the ſtroke of the comet? Is not
this ſufficient to account for the actual motion
of the planets?</p>
               <p>If none of theſe ſuppoſitions be admitted,
may it not be preſumed, that the elaſticity of the
ſun might elevate the torrent above his ſurface,
in place of puſhing it directly forward? This of
itſelf would be ſufficient to remove the perihe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and endow the planets with their preſent
movements. Neither is this ſuppoſition deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of foundation: The ſolar matter may be
exceedingly elaſtic; ſince light, the only part
of it we are acquainted with, ſeems, by its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
to be perfectly elaſtic. I acknowledge
that I cannot determine which of the cauſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
aſſigned has actually produced an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the projectile force of the planets; but
they at leaſt ſhow that ſuch a change is not
only poſſible, but probable; and this is enough
for my preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Without farther inſiſting on the objections
that may be made againſt my hypotheſis, or the
analogical proofs that might be brought in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of it, I ſhall proſecute my ſubject, and draw
the proper concluſions. Let us firſt examine
what might happen to the planets, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to the earth, when they were impreſſed
with their projectile forces, and what was their
ſtate after their ſeparation from the body of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0195400701:99"/>
ſun. A projectile motion having been commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
by the ſtroke of a comet, to a quantity
of matter equal to a 650th part of the ſun's
maſs, the light particles would ſeparate from
the denſe, and, by their mutual attractions, form
globes of different ſolidities. Saturn being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of the largeſt and lighteſt parts, would be
removed to the greateſt diſtance from the ſun;
Jupiter, being denſer than Saturn, would have
a nearer ſtation; and ſo of the reſt. The largeſt
and leaſt ſolid planets are moſt diſtant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they received a greater projectile force
than the ſmaller and denſer; for the projectile
force being proportioned to the ſurfaces to which
it is applied, the ſame ſtroke would make the
larger and lighter parts of the ſolar matter move
with more rapidity than the ſmaller and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier.
The parts, therefore, which differed in
denſity would ſeparate from each other in ſuch
a manner, that, if the denſity of the ſolar matter
be equal to 100, that of Saturn will be equal to
67, of Jupiter, = 94½, of Mars, = 200, of the
Earth, = 400, of Venus, = 800, of Mercury,
= 2800. But, as the attractive force acts not
in proportion to the ſurface, but to the quantity
of matter, it would retard the progreſs of the
more denſe parts of the ſolar matter; and it is
for this reaſon that we find the moſt denſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
neareſt the ſun, and which move round
him with more rapidity than thoſe that are more
diſtant, and leſs denſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0195400701:100"/>
The denſity and projectile motion of Saturn
and Jupiter, the two largeſt planets in the ſyſtem,
have the moſt exact proportion. The denſity
of Saturn is to that of Jupiter as 67 to 94½, and
their velocities are nearly as 88⅔ to 120 1/72, or as
67 to 90 11/16;. How rarely do pure conjectures
correſpond ſo exactly to the phaenomena of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
It is true, according to this relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the celerity and denſity of the planets,
the denſity of the earth ought not to exceed
206 7/18, inſtead of 400, which is its real denſity;
hence it may be ſuppoſed, that the earth has now
double its original denſity. With regard to the
other planets, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, as
their denſities are only conjectural, we know
not whether this circumſtance would confirm or
weaken our hypotheſis. Newton ſays, that the
denſities of the planets are proportioned to the
degrees of heat they are expoſed to; and, it is
in conſequence of this idea, that we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Mars as being one time leſs denſe than
the earth, Venus one time, Mercury ſeven times,
and the comet 1680, 28,000 times denſer than
the earth. But, if we attend to Saturn and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,
the two principal planets, we will find,
that this ſuppoſed proportion between the den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
of the planets, and the heat they ſuſtain, is
not well founded: For, according to this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,
the denſity of Saturn would be as 4 7/18,
and that of Jupiter as 14 17/22, inſtead of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
of 67 and 94½; differences ſo great as
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0195400701:101"/>
to deſtroy the principles upon which they are
founded. Thus, notwithſtanding the regard due
to the conjectures of Newton, I cannot help
thinking that the denſities of the planets have a
nearer relation to their celerities than to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of heat to which they are expoſed. This,
indeed, is only a final cauſe; but the other is a
phyſical relation, the exactneſs of which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
in Saturn and Jupiter. It is, however,
certain, that the denſity of the earth, inſtead of
being 206⅞, is 400; and, conſequently, the earth
muſt have ſuffered a condenſation in the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of 206½ to 400.</p>
               <p>But, have the condenſations of the planets no
relation to the quantity of ſolar heat they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain?
In that caſe, Saturn, which is at the
greateſt diſtance from the ſun, would have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
little or no condenſation; and Jupiter
would be condenſed from 90 11/16 to 94½. Now,
the ſun's heat in Jupiter being to his heat in the
earth as 14 17/22 to 400, their condenſation ought
to be in the ſame proportion. Thus, if Jupiter
be condenſed as 90 11/16 to 94½, the earth, if it
had been in the orbit of Jupiter, would have
been condenſed from 206⅞ to 215 990/1452; but the
earth being much nearer the ſun, and receiving
heat, in proportion to that of Jupiter, as 400 to
14 17/22, the quantity of condenſation it would
have undergone in the orbit of Jupiter muſt be
multiplied by the proportion of 400 to 14 17/22,
which will give nearly 234⅓ for the condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0195400701:102"/>
the earth muſt have received. The denſity
of the earth was 206⅞; by adding its acquired
condenſation, its actual denſity will be 400⅞,
which is nearly the ſame with 400, its real den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
determined by the moon's parallax. With
regard to the other planets, I pretend not to give
exact proportions, but only approximations,
tending to ſhow, that their denſities have a
ſtrong connection with the celerity of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in their reſpective orbits.</p>
               <p>The comet, by falling obliquely on the ſun,
as mentioned above, muſt have forced off from
his ſurface a quantity of matter equal to a 650th
part of his body. This matter being in a liquid
ſtate, would at firſt form a torrent, of which the
largeſt and rareſt parts would fly to the greateſt
diſtances; the ſmaller and more denſe, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
only an equal impulſe, would remain
nearer the ſun; his power of attraction would
operate upon all the parts detached from his
body, and make them circulate round him; and,
at the ſame time, the mutual attraction of the
particles of matter would cauſe all the detached
parts to take on the form of globes, at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
diſtances from the ſun, the nearer moving
with greater rapidity in their orbits than the
more remote.</p>
               <p>But, to this it may be objected, that, if the
planets had been detached from the ſun, they
muſt have been burning and luminous, not cold
and opaque bodies; nothing can have leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0195400701:103"/>
to a globe of fire than a globe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of earth and water; and, by compariſon,
the matter of the earth is totally different from
that of the ſun.</p>
               <p>It may be replied to this objection, that the
matter changed its form upon its ſeparation, and
that the fire, or light, was extinguiſhed by the
projectile motion communicated by the ſtroke.
Beſides, may it not be ſuppoſed, that the ſun, or
a burning ſtar, moving with a rapidity equal to
that of the planets, would ſoon be extinguiſhed;
and that this may be the reaſon why all the
luminous, or burning ſtars, are fixed, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
motion; and why thoſe called new ſtars,
which have probably changed their ſtations, are
frequently extinguiſhed and diſappear? To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
this remark, comets, when in their perihe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
ought to be inflamed even to their center;
but they never become luminous ſtars; they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
emit a burning vapour, a conſiderable portion
of which they leave behind them in their courſe.</p>
               <p>In a medium which has little reſiſtance, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that fire may ſubſiſt, although the
burning body be moved with great rapidity. It
muſt likewiſe be acknowledged, that what I have
ſaid applies only to thoſe ſtars which diſappear
for ever, not to thoſe that appear and diſappear
at ſtated intervals, without changing their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the heavens. Of theſe Maupertuis, in
his diſcourſe on the figure of the ſtars, has
given a moſt ſatisfactory account. But thoſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0195400701:104"/>
which have appeared, and then vaniſhed for
ever, muſt unqueſtionably have been extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
either by the quickneſs of their motion,
or ſome other cauſe. There is not a ſingle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of a luminous ſtar revolving round an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
and not one of the ſixteen planets
which revolve round the ſun have any light in
themſelves.</p>
               <p>Farther, fire, in ſmall maſſes, cannot ſubſiſt
ſo long as in large ones. The planets would
burn a conſiderable time after they iſſued from
the ſun; but, at length, would extinguiſh for
want of combuſtible matter. For the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
the ſun itſelf will be extinguiſhed; but at a
period as much beyond that which extinguiſhed
the planets, as the quantity of matter in the ſun
exceeds that of the planets. However this may
be, the ſeparation of the planets from the ſun,
by the ſhock of a comet, appears ſufficient to
account for their extinction.</p>
               <p>The earth and planets, when they iſſued from
the ſun, were totally compoſed of liquid fire; in
which ſtate they would continue no longer than
the violence of the heat that kept them in fuſion.
But this heat would gradually decay from the
moment they left the ſun. During their fluid
ſtate, they neceſſarily aſſumed circular fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures;
and their diurnal motion would elevate
their equators, and flatten their poles. I agree
with M. Leibnitz<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Act. Erud. Lipſ. an. 1692.</note>, that this figure correſponds
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0195400701:105"/>
ſo exactly with the laws of hydroſtatics, that the
earth and planets muſt neceſſarily have been
once in a ſtate of fluidity occaſioned by fire;
and conſequently, that the interior parts of the
earth muſt be compoſed of vitrified matter, of
which ſand, free-ſtone, granite, and perhaps
clay, are fragments, or ſcoriae.</p>
               <p>It is therefore extremely probable, that the
planets were originally parts of the ſun ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by a ſtroke which communicated to them
a projectile motion; and that their different
diſtances proceeded ſolely from the difference of
their denſities. To compleat this theory, it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remains to account for the diurnal motion of
the planets, and the origin of their ſatellites;
and this, inſtead of adding freſh difficulties, will
tend greatly to confirm my hypotheſis: For ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
or what is called diurnal motion, entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
depends on the obliquity of the ſtroke; an
oblique impulſe on the ſurface of a body neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
gives it a rotatory motion. If the body
which receives the impulſe be homogeneous, the
rotatory motion will always be equal and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form;
but it will be unequal, if the body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of heterogeneous parts, or of parts different
in denſity. Hence we may conclude, that the
matter of each planet is homogeneous, becauſe
the diurnal motion of each is uniformly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in the ſame time; and this circumſtance
is an additional proof, that portions of different
denſities were originally ſeparated from the ſun.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0195400701:106"/>
But the obliquity of the ſtroke might be ſo
great as to throw off ſmall quantities of matter
from the principal planet, which would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
move in the ſame direction. Theſe parts,
by mutual attraction, would reunite, according
to their denſities, at different diſtances from the
planet, follow its courſe round the ſun, and at
the ſame time revolve about the body of the
planet, nearly in the plane of its orbit. It is eaſy
to perceive that the portions we mean are the
ſatellites: Thus the formation, poſition, and
motion of the ſatellites correſpond, in the moſt
perfect manner, with our theory; for they all
move in the ſame direction, and in concentric
circles round their principal planets, and nearly
in the plane of their orbits. All theſe common
effects, depending on an impulſive force, muſt
have proceeded from a common cauſe, which
was a projectile force communicated to them by
the ſame oblique ſtroke. This account of the
motion and formation of the ſatellites will be
ſtrongly ſupported, if the other circumſtances
and phaenomena attending them be duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Thoſe planets that are furniſhed with ſatel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
move quickeſt round their axes. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
of the earth is quicker than that of Mars,
in the proportion nearly of 24 to 15; the earth
has a ſatellite, and Mars has none; Jupiter;
whoſe diurnal motion is 500 or 600 times more
rapid than that of the earth, has four ſatellites;
and it is extremely probable, that Saturn, who
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0195400701:107"/>
has five ſatellites and a ring, revolves much more
quickly than Jupiter.</p>
               <p>We may even conjecture, with ſome proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
that the plane of the equator of Saturn's
ring is nearly the ſame with that of the planet;
for, ſuppoſing, according to the preceding theory,
the obliquity of the impulſe which put Saturn
in motion to have been very great, his diurnal
motion would at firſt be in proportion to the
exceſs of the centrifugal force above that of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and, of courſe, a conſiderable quantity of
matter would be thrown off from his equatorial
regions, and neceſſarily aſſume the figure of a
ring, the plane of which would be nearly the
ſame with that of his own equator. This quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of matter detached from the equatorial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of Saturn, muſt have flattened the equator
of that planet; which is the reaſon why, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the rapidity with which we have
ſuppoſed him to revolve round his axis, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameters
of Saturn are not ſo unequal as thoſe of
Jupiter, which differ from each other more than
an eleventh part.</p>
               <p>Though this theory of the formation of the
planets and their ſatellites appears to be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
probable; yet, as every man has his own
ſtandard of eſtimating probabilities of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and as this ſtandard varies according to the
different capacities of combining analogies more
or leſs remote, I pretend not to convince thoſe
who are unwilling to believe. I have offered thoſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0195400701:108"/>
ideas to the public, not only becauſe I thought
them rational, and calculated to unravel a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
upon which, however important, nothing
has hitherto been written; but becauſe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive
motion of the planets gives riſe to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs
phaenomena in the univerſe, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
not of an explanation by gravity alone. To
thoſe who may be diſpoſed to deny the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of my theory, I would propoſe the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
queries:</p>
               <p>1. Is it not natural to imagine, that a moving
body has received its motion from the impulſe
of ſome other body?</p>
               <p>2. When ſeveral bodies move in the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
is it not exceedingly probable, that they
received this direction from a ſingle ſtroke, or,
at leaſt, from ſtrokes every way ſimilar?</p>
               <p>3. When ſeveral bodies in motion have not
only the ſame direction, but are placed in the
ſame plane, is it not more natural to think that
they received this direction and poſition from
one impulſe than from many?</p>
               <p>4. Is it not probable, that a body put in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by impulſe, ſhould receive it in an oblique
direction; and conſequently that it ſhould be
forced to move round its axis with a rapidity
proportioned to the obliquity of the ſtroke? If
theſe queries be not unreaſonable, the theory of
which we have given a ſketch will no longer
have the appearance of abſurdity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0195400701:109"/>
Let us now proceed to a more intereſting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
let us examine the figure of the earth,
upon which ſo many inquiries and obſervations
have been made. As it appears, from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
of the earth's diurnal motion, and the
uniformity in the inclination of its axis, that it
is compoſed of homogeneous parts which mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
attract each other in proportion to their
quantities of matter; if its impulſive motion
had been communicated in a direction perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
to its ſurface, it would neceſſarily have
aſſumed the figure of a perfect ſphere: But,
having been ſtruck obliquely, it moved round
its axis at the inſtant it received its figure; and,
from the combination of the projectile force and
that of attraction, there reſulted a ſpheroid fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
more elevated at the equator than at the
poles; becauſe the centrifugal force, ariſing from
the diurnal rotation of the earth, muſt diminiſh
the action of gravity, or that power which makes
all the parts tend to the centre. Thus the earth,
being compoſed of homogeneous parts, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been endowed with a rotatory motion,
muſt neceſſarily have aſſumed a ſpheroidal
figure, the two axes of which differ from each
other by a 230th part. To ſhow that this is the
real figure of the earth, we need not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to hypotheſes; it is capable of the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
demonſtration. The laws of gravitation are
well known: That bodies attract each other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0195400701:110"/>
as their quantities of matter, and inverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the ſquares of their diſtances, admits not
of a doubt. It can as little be doubted, that the
total action of any body is compoſed of all the
particular actions of its parts.</p>
               <p>The parts of bodies are all mutually attracted
in the above proportion; and all theſe attractions,
when the body has no rotation, neceſſarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a ſphere, and a ſpheroid, when the body is
endowed with a rotatory motion. This ſpheroid is
more or leſs flattened at the poles in proportion
to the quickneſs of its diurnal motion; and the
earth, in conſequence of the celerity of its ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and the mutual attraction of its parts,
has aſſumed the figure of a ſpheroid, of which
the two axes are to one another as 229 to 230.</p>
               <p>Thus the earth, at the time of its formation,
from the original conſtitution and homogeneity
of its parts, and independent of every hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
derived from the direction of gravity, took
the figure of a ſpheroid; and, from the known
laws of mechanics, its equatorial diameter was
neceſſarily elevated about ſix leagues and a half
more than its poles.</p>
               <p>I ſhall dwell the longer on this article, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there are ſome geometers, who, from a
ſyſtem of philoſophy they have adopted, and
from a ſuppoſed direction of gravity, ſtill ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that the figure of the earth depends upon
theory. The firſt thing to be demonſtrated is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0195400701:111"/>
the mutual attraction of the parts of matter;
and the ſecond, the homogeneity of the terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
globe. When theſe two facts are clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
there will be no occaſion to have recourſe
to any theory derived from the direction of
gravity; becauſe the earth's figure, in this caſe,
muſt neceſſarily be as Newton determined it;
and all the other figures aſſigned to it in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of vortexes, and other hypotheſes, can
have no exiſtence.</p>
               <p>It will not be doubted, even by the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous,
that the planets are retained in their
orbits by the power of gravity. The ſatellites
of Saturn gravitate towards that planet, thoſe of
Jupiter towards Jupiter; the moon gravitates
towards the earth; and Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,
the Earth, Venus, and Mercury, gravitate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſun. In the ſame manner, Saturn,
Jupiter, and the Earth, gravitate towards their
reſpective ſatellites, and the ſun gravitates to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the whole planets. Gravitation is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a general law, by which the whole planetary
ſyſtem is mutually affected; for action cannot
exiſt without re-action. This mutual attraction
of the planets is the law which regulates all their
motions; and its exiſtence is demonſtrated by its
effects. When Saturn and Jupiter are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
their mutual attraction produces an
irregularity in their motion round the ſun. The
earth and the moon, alſo, mutually attract each
other; But the irregularities in the moon's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0195400701:112"/>
proceed principally from the attraction of
the ſun; and hence the ſun, the earth, and the
moon, mutually act upon each other. Now, the
reciprocal attraction of the planets, when the
diſtances are equal, is proportioned to their quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of matter; and the ſame power of gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which makes heavy bodies fall to the earth,
and which extends as far as the moon, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in proportion to the quantity of matter:
The total gravity of a planet, therefore, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of the gravity of all its parts: Hence all
the parts of matter, whether in the earth or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
mutually attract each other; and, of courſe,
the rotation of the earth round its axis muſt
neceſſarily have beſtowed on it the figure of a
ſpheroid, the axes of which are are as 229 to 230.
But the direction of gravity muſt be perpendicular
to the earth's ſurface; and, conſequently, unleſs
the general and mutual attraction of the parts
of matter be denied, no hypotheſis derived from
the direction of gravity can have any ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
But this mutual attraction, as we have
ſeen, is demonſtrated by actual obſervation;
and the experiments made by pendulums prove
its univerſal extenſion. No hypotheſis, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
founded on the direction of gravity, can
be admitted, without contradicting both reaſon
and experience.</p>
               <p>Let us now examine whether the parts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the terreſtrial globe be homogeneous. I
acknowledge, that, if the globe be ſuppoſed to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0195400701:113"/>
conſiſt of parts different in denſity, the direction
of gravity would be different from that we have
aſſigned, and that the earth's figure would vary
according to the different ſuppoſitions that might
be made concerning the direction of gravity.
But, why make ſuppoſitions of this kind? Why,
for example, do we ſuppoſe the parts near the
center to be more denſe than thoſe more diſtant
from it? Are not all the particles which compoſe
the globe united by their mutual attraction?
Every particle, therefore, is a centre; and there
is no reaſon to believe that the parts which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
the centre are denſer than thoſe which
ſurround any other point. Beſides, if any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
part of the earth were more denſe than
another, the axis of rotation would approach
nearer that part, and create an inequality in the
diurnal revolution of the globe: It would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an inequality in the apparent motion of the
fixed ſtars; they would appear to move more
quickly or ſlowly in the zenith or horizon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as we happened to be ſituated on the
heavy or light parts of the earth; and the axis
of the globe not paſſing through its centre of
gravity, would make a perceptible change in its
poſition. But nothing of this kind ever takes
place. On the contrary, the diurnal revolution
of the earth is equal and uniform. At every
point of the earth's ſurface, the ſtars appear to
move with the ſame quickneſ and, if there be
any rotation in its axis, it is too inconſiderable
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0195400701:114"/>
to attract obſervation. Hence it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that all the parts of the globe are at leaſt
nearly homogeneous.</p>
               <p>If the earth were hollow, the cruſt of which,
for example, exceeded not three leagues in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
it would give riſe to the following phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena.
1. The mountains would bear ſo
great a proportion to the total thickneſs of the
cruſt, that vaſt irregularities in the earth's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would be occaſioned by the attraction of
the moon and of the ſun: When the moon was
in the meridian of the more elevated parts, as
the Cordeliers, her attraction upon the whole
globe would be much greater, than when ſhe
was in the meridian of the lower parts. 2. The
comparative attraction of the mountains would
be greatly increaſed; and the experiments made
on Mount Chimboraco in Peru, would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
more degrees in the deviation of the plumb
line than they actually gave ſeconds. 3. The
weight of bodies would be greater on the tops
of mountains than in the plains; and men would
find themſelves more weighty, and would walk
with more difficulty in high than in low grounds.
Theſe obſervations, and many others that might
be made, ſhould convince us, that the interior
parts of the earth are not hollow, but that they
are compoſed of matter of a conſiderable den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
               <p>If, on the other hand, the earth, at the depth
of two or three leagues, conſiſted of matter
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0195400701:115"/>
much denſer than that we are acquainted with,
upon deſcending even into ordinary pits, we ſhould
find ourſelves conſiderably heavier; and the
motion of pendulums would there be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerated
than they actually are when brought
down from a hill to a plain. Hence we may
preſume, that the interior parts of the earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of matter nearly ſimilar to that on its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.
Of this, we will be ſtill further convinced,
if we conſider, that the earth, at the time of its
original formation, when it aſſumed its preſent
ſpheroidal figure, was in a ſtate of fuſion, and,
conſequently, that all its parts were homogeneous,
and nearly of equal denſity. The matter on
the ſurface, though originally the ſame with that
of the interior parts, has, in the revolutions of
time, undergone many changes from external
cauſes; and to theſe are to be aſcribed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of materials ſo different in their denſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
But it ought to be remarked, that the
denſeſt bodies, as gold, and other metals, are
moſt rarely to be met with; and, conſequently,
that the greateſt quantity of materials, at the
ſurface, have ſuffered little alteration with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to denſity. The moſt common materials,
indeed, as ſand and clay, differ ſo little in denſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that we may conjecture, with much proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
the internal parts of the earth to conſiſt
of a vitrified matter, the denſity of which is
nearly equal to that of ſand; and, conſequently,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0195400701:116"/>
that the whole globe may be conſidered as one
homogeneous maſs.</p>
               <p>But, it may be ſaid, that, though the earth
were compoſed of concentric beds, of different
denſities, the equality of its diurnal motion, and
the uniform inclination of its axis, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
equally undiſturbed, as upon the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its conſiſting wholly of homogeneous
matter. This I allow; but I demand, at the
ſame time, whether there be any reaſon for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
that theſe beds of different denſities
really exiſt? Whether this method of ſolving
difficulties be not an attempt to adjuſt the works
of nature to our own imaginations? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuppoſitions, neither founded on obſervation
nor analogy, ought to find admittance into phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſics?</p>
               <p>It is, then, apparent, that the earth received
its ſpheroidal figure in conſequence of its diurnal
motion, and the mutual attraction of its parts;
that this figure neceſſarily reſulted from the
globe's being in a liquid ſtate; that, according
to the laws of gravity and of a centrifugal force,
it could not poſſibly aſſume any other figure;
that, at the moment of its formation, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between its two diameters was, as at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
equal to a 230th part; and, of courſe, that
all other hypotheſes which make this difference
greater or leſs, are mere fictions, and deſerve no
attention.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0195400701:117"/>
Perhaps it may be objected, that, if this theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
be well founded, and if the proportion of the
axes of the two diameters be as 229 to 230,
how came the mathematicians ſent to Lapland
and Peru to concur in making it as 174 to 175?
Why ſhould ſuch a difference ſubſiſt between
practice and theory? And, is it not more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to give the preference to actual meaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
eſpecially when executed by the ableſt
mathematicians in Europe<note n="*" place="bottom">M. de Maupertuis, figure de la terre.</note>, and furniſhed with
all the neceſſary apparatus?</p>
               <p>To this I reply, that I mean not to combat
the obſervations made at the equator, and near
the pole; that I doubt not of their exactneſs; and
that the earth may actually be elevated a 175th
part more at the equator than at the poles. Still,
however, I maintain my theory; and I perceive
clearly how it may be reconciled to practice.
The difference between the two concluſions is
about four leagues in the two axes. The equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial
regions are found to have an elevation of
two leagues more than they ought to have by
the theory. This heighth of two leagues cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds
exactly with the greateſt inequalities
which have been produced on the ſurface of the
globe by the motion of the ſea, and the action
of fluids. This requires illuſtration. At the
time of the earth's formation, in conſequence of
the mutual attraction of its parts, and of its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifugal
force, it muſt have aſſumed a ſpheroidal
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0195400701:118"/>
figure, with its axes different by a 230th part.
This would be the real figure of the earth while
it remained in a ſtate of liquifaction. But, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cooling for ſome time, the rarified vapours,
like thoſe in the tail or atmoſphere of a comet,
would condenſe, and fall on the ſurface in the
form of air and water; and, when theſe waters
began to be agitated by a flux and reflux, ſand,
and other bodies, would be gradually tranſported
from the poles towards the equatorial parts.
This operation, when continued for ſome time,
would neceſſarily ſink the poles, and elevate the
equator in the ſame proportion. The ſurface of
the earth being likewiſe expoſed to the winds,
to the action of the air and of the ſun; all theſe
cauſes would concur with the tides in furrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the earth, in ſcooping out vallies, in eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the mountains, and in producing other ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
irregularities, none of which, perhaps,
exceed a league in thickneſs, even at the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
This inequality of two leagues may be
ſuppoſed to be the greateſt that can take place
on the ſurface; for the higheſt mountains ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
not a league in height; and the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
parts of the ocean, it is probable, are not
above a league in depth. Thus my theory per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
coincides with practice. The earth's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator
could not, at firſt, be elevated more than
ſix leagues and a half above the poles; but the
changes produced on the ſurface might give it
a ſtill greater elevation. Natural hiſtory won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0195400701:119"/>
ſupports this opinion; for, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
diſcourſe, we have proved, that, from
the tides and other motions of the waters, have
proceeded mountains, and all the other inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
on the ſurface of the globe; and that, at
great depths, as well as upon the greateſt
heights, bones, ſhells, and other relicts of ſea
and land animals, have been diſcovered.</p>
               <p>From what has been obſerved, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured,
that, in order to find primitive earth,
and ſubſtances which have never been removed
from their original ſtations, we muſt dig in
countries near the poles, where the bed of
unmoved earth will be thinner than in ſouthern
climates.</p>
               <p>In fine, if the meaſurement by which the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the earth was determined be ſtrictly
ſcrutinized, we ſhall find that it is not altogether
free from hypothetical reaſoning: For it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
on the ſuppoſition that the earth was a
regular curve: But, as the earth is liable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
and conſtant changes from a thouſand
cauſes, it is impoſſible that it could have retained
any perfectly regular figure; and hence, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to our theory, and the opinion of Newton,
the poles might originally be only flattened a
230th part. Beſides, though we had the exact
length of a degree at the equator and polar
circle, yet, have we not likewiſe the exact length
of a degree in France? and the meaſures of M.
Picard have never been confirmed. It may be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0195400701:120"/>
added, that the diminution and increaſe in the
motion of the pendulum agree not with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
drawn from meaſurement; and that, on
the contrary, they correſpond very nearly to the
theory of Newton. Theſe circumſtances tend
farther to convince us, that the poles are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
above a 230th part; and that, if there
be any difference, it can proceed from nothing
but the inequalities produced on the ſurface by
the waters, and other external cauſes. But theſe
inequalities are by no means ſo regular as to
juſtify any hypotheſis which ſuppoſes the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
to be ellipſes, or any other perfect curves.
Hence it appears, that, though many degrees
ſhould be ſucceſſively meaſured in different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
we cannot, by that alone, aſcertain the
exact depreſſion of the poles, nor determine how
much it exceeds or falls ſhort of a 230th part.</p>
               <p>May we not likewiſe conjecture, that, if the
inclination of the earth's axis has been changed,
this effect could not be produced but by the
changes on the ſurface, ſince all the other parts
are homogeneous; that this variation is, of
courſe, too ſmall to be perceived by aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers;
and that, if the earth be not diſturbed by
a comet, or ſome other external cauſe, its axis
will for ever preſerve its preſent and original
inclination?</p>
               <p>Not to omit any conjecture that ſeems rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
may we not ſuppoſe, that, as the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and other inequalities on the ſurface of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0195400701:121"/>
the earth, have originated from the action of
the tides, thoſe which we perceive in the moon
have been produced by a ſimilar cauſe? The
mountains of the moon are indeed higher than
thoſe of the earth; but her tides are likewiſe
ſtronger; becauſe the earth, the ſize of which is
much larger, produces the tides of the moon
with ſuperior force. This effect would be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
augmented, if the moon, like the earth, had
a quick diurnal motion. But, as the moon uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
preſents the ſame face to the earth, the
tides are raiſed only in proportion to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
occaſioned by her librations, which alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
expoſe to our view a ſmall ſegment of
her other hemiſphere. This cauſe, however,
muſt produce tides very different from thoſe of
our ſeas; and their effects will, of courſe, be
much leſs conſiderable, than if the moon had
poſſeſſed a diurnal revolution round her axis,
equally quick as the rotation of the earth.</p>
               <p>I ſhould compoſe a volume equal to that of
Burnet or Whiſton, were I to extend the ideas
preſented by the above theory; and were I, in
imitation of the laſt mentioned author, to clothe
them in a geometrical dreſs, I might add conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
to their importance. But I have always
thought, that hypotheſes, however probable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
not to be treated ſo pompouſly; it is apt to
give them the air of quackery and impoſition.</p>

               <head>Of the Syſtem of Whiſton<note n="*" place="bottom">See a new theory of the Earth by Will. Whiſton, London 1708.</note>.</head>
               <p>THIS author begins his theory with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation
on the creation of the world.
He alledges, that the account given of it by
Moſes is not properly underſtood; and that, in
inquiries of this kind, men, contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the moſt evident and ſuperficial views,
give too little of their attention to nature, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and philoſophy. The common notions,
he obſerves, concerning the ſix days work, are
falſe; and the deſcription of Moſes is not an
exact or philoſophic account of the creation and
origin of the univerſe, but only an hiſtorical
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0195400701:123"/>
narrative of the formation of the terreſtrial globe.
The earth, in his eſtimation, formerly exiſted in
Chaos, and, at the time mentioned by Moſes, it
only received a form, ſituation, and conſiſtence,
neceſſary for the habitation of mankind. I
ſhall not give a detail of Whiſton's proofs, nor
enter upon a formal refutation of them; but
content myſelf with a ſhort view of his theory,
which will ſhow it to be contrary to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and, of courſe, that his proofs muſt be
falſe. Beſides, he treats this matter more like
a polemical divine than a philoſopher.</p>
               <p>Leaving theſe falſe principles, he proceeds to
ſome ingenious notions, which, though ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
will not, to thoſe who are influenced by the
enthuſiaſm of ſyſtem, appear to be deſtitute of
probability. He tells us, that the antient Chaos,
from which the earth originated, was the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere
of a comet; that the annual motion
of the earth began when it received its new
form; but that its diurnal motion commenced
not till the fall of Adam; that the Ecliptic cut
the tropic of Cancer in a point preciſely oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to Paradiſe, which was ſituated on the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt
frontier of Aſſyria; that, before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
the year began at the autumnal equinox,
and that the orbits of the earth and planets were
then perfect circles; that the deluge commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
on the 18th of November, in the year of
the Julian period 2365, or 2349 before Chriſt;
that, previous to the deluge, the ſolar and lunar
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0195400701:124"/>
year were the ſame, and conſiſted exactly of 360
days; that a comet, deſcending in the plane of
the ecliptic to its perihelion, on the very day that
the deluge began, made a near approach to the
earth; that there is a great heat in the bowels
of the earth, which is conſtantly expanding
from the centre to the circumference; that the
figure of the earth reſembles an egg; that the
mountains are the lighteſt parts of the globe,
&amp;c. He then attributes to the deluge all the
changes the earth has undergone, blindly adopts
Woodward's theory, uſes indiſcriminately all
that author's remarks on the preſent ſtate of the
earth; but aſſumes more the air of an original,
when he treats of its future condition. The
earth, ſays Mr Whiſton, will be conſumed by
ſire; and its deſtruction will be preceded by
earthquakes, thunder, and hideous meteors; the
ſun and moon will aſſume a dreadful aſpect; the
heavens will ſeem to fall; and the whole earth
will be in flames. But, after the fire ſhall have
devoured every impurity of this globe, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified
and rendered it tranſparent as the pureſt
cryſtal, the ſaints and ſpirits of the bleſſed ſhall
take poſſeſſion of it, and there remain till the
general judgment.</p>
               <p>This hypotheſis appears, at firſt view, to be
extravagant and fantaſtical. But the author has
managed his ideas with ſuch dexterity, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them in ſo ſtrong a light, that they no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
have the air of abſolute chimeras. He has
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0195400701:125"/>
adorned his ſubject with much ſcience and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity:
And it is aſtoniſhing, that, from ſuch
a medley of ſtrange notions, he ſhould have
been able to compoſe a ſyſtem ſo plauſible. But
it is not to the vulgar that it has this brilliant
appearance; the learned are more eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the glare of erudition, and the force
of new ideas. Mr Whiſton was a celebrated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomer.
Accuſtomed to contemplate the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
to meaſure the motions of the ſtars, and to
conſider the great phaenomena of nature, he
could never imagine, that this grain of ſand,
which we inhabit, occupied more the attention
of its Creator than the univerſe, which contains,
in the vaſt regions of ſpace, millions of other
ſuns and other worlds. He alledges, that Moſes
has not given us the hiſtory of the firſt creation
of this globe, but only a detail of thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which attended its receiving a form fit
for the habitation of men, when the Almighty
transformed it from the ſtate of a comet to that
of a planet. Comets, owing to the excentricity
of their orbits, are ſubject to dreadful viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes:
Sometimes, like that of 1680, they are
a thouſand times hotter than melted iron, and
ſometimes a thouſand times more cold than ice:
They cannot, therefore, furniſh habitation to
any creatures of which we can form a concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
or rather, they are altogether uninhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0195400701:126"/>
The planets, on the contrary, are tranquil bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
their diſtances from the ſun vary but
little; and their temperature continues ſo nearly
the ſame, that it permits plants and animals to
grow and to multiply.</p>
               <p>In the beginning, ſays Mr Whiſton, God
created the univerſe; but the earth was then an
uninhabitable comet, and ſubject to ſuch alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
extremes of cold and heat, that its matter,
being ſometimes liquified and ſometimes frozen,
was in the form of a chaos, or an abyſs, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with utter darkneſs: <hi>And darkneſs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the face of the deep.</hi> This chaos was the
atmoſphere of the comet, a body compoſed of
heterogeneous materials, having its centre oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
with a globular, ſolid, hot nucleus of
about 2000 leagues in diameter, round which
was an extenſive maſs of a thick fluid, mixed
with heterogeneous and undigeſted materials,
like the chaos of the antients, <hi>rudis et indigeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque
moles.</hi> This great atmoſphere contained
few dry, ſolid, or earthy particles, and ſtill leſs
of water or air; but it was amply filled with
thick and heavy fluids, mixed, agitated, and
jumbled together in the utmoſt confuſion. Such
was the condition of the earth when ſix days
old: But, next day, that is, on the firſt day of
the creation, when the excentric orbit of the
comet was changed into an ellipſe, nearly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
every thing aſſumed its proper place; the
different materials arranged themſelves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0195400701:127"/>
to their ſpecific gravities; the heavy fluids
ſunk down, and left to the earthy, watery, and
aerial ſubſtances, the ſuperior regions. Theſe
alſo deſcended in the order of their gravities;
firſt the earth, then the water, and, laſtly, the
air. In this manner, the immenſe volume of
chaos was reduced to a moderate ſphere, the
center of which is a ſolid body that ſtill retains
the heat it received from the ſun, when former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the nucleus of a comet. This heat may eaſily
laſt 6000 years, ſince the comet 1680 would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
50,000 before it cooled. Round the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
and burning nucleus, at the center of the
earth, is placed the heavy fluid which deſcended
firſt, and formed the great abyſs, upon which
the earth floats like a cork on quick-ſilver. But,
as the earthy parts were originally mixed with a
great body of water, they, in deſcending, drove
before them a part of this water, which was
conſined there when the earth conſolidated, and
formed a ſtratum concentric with the heavy
fluid that ſurrounds the nucleus. Thus, the
great abyſs is compoſed of two concentric circles,
the interior being a heavy fluid, and the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
water, upon which laſt the earth is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
founded. From this admirable arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
produced by the atmoſphere of a comet,
are to be deduced the theory of the earth, and
an explication of all its phaenomena.</p>
               <p>After the atmoſphere of the comet had been
freed from the ſolid and earthy particles, a pure
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0195400701:128"/>
air only remained, through which the rays of
the ſun inſtantly penetrated, and produced light:
<hi>Let there be light</hi>; <hi>and there was light.</hi> The
vaſt columns or beds of which the earth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
being formed with ſo much precipitation,
is the reaſon why they differ ſo much in denſity;
the heavier ſunk deeper into the abyſs than the
lighter, and, of courſe, gave riſe to mountains
and valleys: Theſe inequalities, before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
were differently ſituated from what they
are at preſent. Inſtead of that vaſt valley which
contains the ocean, many ſmall caverns were
diſperſed over the globe, each of which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a part of the waters. The mountains were
then at greater diſtances, and formed not large
chains. But the earth was a thouſand times
more fertile, and contained a thouſand times
more inhabitants; and the life of man, and of
the other animals, was ten times longer, All
theſe effects were produced by the ſuperior heat
of the central fire, which gave birth to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
number of plants and animals, and, at the
ſame time, beſtowed on them a degree of vigour
that enabled them to exiſt long, and to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
abundantly. But this heat had a miſerable
effect upon the diſpoſitions of men and other
animals: It augmented the paſſions, robbed man
of his innocence, and diminiſhed the ſagacity of
the brute creation. All creatures, excepting the
fiſhes, who inhabited a colder element, felt the
influence of the central heat, became vicious,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0195400701:129"/>
and merited death. This univerſal death was
accordingly inflicted, on Wedneſday the 28th
day of November, by a dreadful deluge, which
laſted 40 days and 40 nights, and was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſined
by the tail of a comet meeting with the
earth, in returning from its perihelion.</p>
               <p>The tail of a comet is the lighteſt part of its
atmoſphere. It is a tranſparent and ſubtile va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
raiſed by the heat of the ſun from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the comet. This vapour, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of aerial and watery particles extremely
rarified, follows the comet in its deſcent to its
perihelion, and goes before the comet in its
aſcent, its ſituation being always oppoſite to the
ſun, as if it had an affection for the ſhade, and
wiſhed to avoid the ſcorching rays of the ſun.
This column of a vapour is often of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
extent; and its length always increaſes
in proportion as the comet approaches nearer
the ſun. Now, as many comets deſcend below
the annual orbit of the earth, it is not ſurpriſing
that the earth ſhould ſometimes be involved in
this vapour. This dreadful event happened at
the time of the deluge. The tail of a comet, in
two hours, will diſcharge a quantity of water
equal to that contained in the whole ocean. In
fine, this tail is what Moſes calls the cataracts
of heaven: <hi>And the cataracts of heaven were
opened.</hi> The globe of the earth, when it meets
with a comet's tail, muſt neceſſarily, in its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
through this body of vapour, appropriate
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0195400701:130"/>
part of its materials. Every thing that comes
within the ſphere of the earth's attraction muſt
fall upon it, and muſt fall in the form of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
ſince the tail itſelf principally conſiſts of
that element. In this manner, rain may come
from the heavens in ſuch abundance, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an univerſal deluge, and to ſurmount the
tops of the higheſt mountains.</p>
               <p>Our author, however, unwilling to go beyond
the letter of the ſacred writings, does not aſcribe
the deluge to this rain alone, which he has cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
to bring from ſo great a diſtance. He takes
advantage of water wherever he can find it:
The great abyſs, as we have ſeen, contains a
conſiderable quantity. The earth, in its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
towards the comet, would feel the force
of its attraction; the waters in the great abyſs
would be ſo agitated with a motion ſimilar to
that of the tides, as would neceſſarily break the
ſhell or cruſt in many places, and make the water
ruſh out upon the ſurface: <hi>And the fountains
of the abyſs were opened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how, it may be aſked, was this vaſt col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of water, ſo liberally furniſhed by the
great abyſs, and by the comet's tail, afterwards
diſpoſed of? Our author is not embarraſſed by
this circumſtance. As ſoon as the earth eſcaped
from the comet, the flux and reflux of the great
abyſs neceſſarily ceaſed. From that moment,
the waters on the ſurface ruſhed down with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
by the ſame channels out of which they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0195400701:131"/>
had iſſued. The great abyſs ſwallowed up not
only its own water, but all that had been depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
by the comet, which it was ſufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabled
to contain; becauſe, during its agitation,
and when it broke the cruſt, it had greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
its dimenſions, by puſhing the earth far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from it on all ſides. It was at this time
likewiſe, that the earth, which was formerly a
ſphere, aſſumed its elliptical figure. This effect
was produced by the centrifugal force occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the diurnal motion of the earth, and by
the attraction of the comet; for the earth, when
paſſing through the tail of the comet, was ſo ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated,
that its equatorial parts were neareſt that
ſtar; and, of courſe, the power of the comet's
attraction, concurring with the earth's centrifu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
force, elevated the equatorial regions with
the greater facility, becauſe the cruſt was broken
in an infinite number of places, and becauſe the
flux and reflux of the abyſs puſhed more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
againſt the equator than any where elſe.</p>
               <p>This is the hiſtory Mr Whiſton gives of the
creation, of the cauſes of the univerſal deluge,
of the longevity of the Antedeluvians, and of
the figure of the earth. All theſe difficult ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſeem to have given our author very little
trouble. But he appears to be greatly puzzled
about Noah's ark. In that dreadful confuſion
produced by the conjunction of the tail of a
comet, and by the waters of the great abyſs,
and in that horrible period, when not only
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0195400701:132"/>
the elements of this globe were confounded,
but when the heavens concurred with the
bowels of the earth in producing new ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to increaſe the chaos, how is it to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that the ark could float tranquilly, with
its numerous and valuable cargo, upon the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the waves? Here our author ſtruggles
hard, in order to account for the preſervation of
the ark. But, as his reaſoning, upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
appears to be inconcluſive, ill-imagined,
and heterodox, I ſhall only obſerve how hard
it is for a man, who had explained objects ſo
great and ſurpriſing, without having recourſe to
a ſupernatural power, to be ſtopped in his career
by a trifling circumſtance. But he chuſes to
riſk drowning himſelf along with the ark,
rather than to aſcribe the preſervation of this
precious veſſel to the interpoſition of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty!</p>
               <p>I ſhall only make a ſingle remark upon this
ſyſtem, of which I have given a faithful abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Whenever men are ſo preſumptuous as
to attempt a phyſical explanation of theological
truths; whenever they allow themſelves to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
the ſacred text by views purely human;
whenever they reaſon concerning the will of the
Deity, and the execution of his decrees; they
muſt neceſſarily involve themſelves in obſcurity,
and tumble into a chaos of confuſion, like the
author of this whimſical ſyſtem, which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0195400701:133"/>
all its abſurdities, has been received
with great applauſe. Mr Whiſton neither doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the truth of the deluge, nor of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity
of the ſacred writings. But, as phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſics
and aſtronomy occupied his principal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
he miſtook paſſages of holy writ for
phyſical facts, and for reſults of aſtronomical
obſervation; and ſo ſtrangely jumbled divinity
with human ſcience, that he has given birth to
the moſt extraordinary ſyſtem that perhaps ever
did or ever will appear.</p>

               <p>MR Burnet is the firſt author who diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
enlarged views of the preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and who treated it in a ſyſtematic manner.
He was a man of genius and of taſte: His work
acquired great reputation, and was, of courſe,
criticiſed by many of the learned, and, among
others, by Mr Keill, who, ſcrutinizing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
as a geometer, demonſtrated the errors of
Burnet's theory in a treatiſe entitled, <hi>An exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Theory of the earth.</hi> Mr Keill
likewiſe refuted the ſyſtem of Whiſton; but he
treated the latter in a manner very different
from the former. He even appears, in many
particulars, to adopt the opinions of Whiſton;
and conſiders the notion, that the deluge was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0195400701:135"/>
occaſioned by the tail of a comet, as exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
probable. But, to return to Burnet: His
book is equally written; he knows how to paint
the grandeſt images and the moſt magnificent
ſcenes. His plan is elevated; but, being defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in proper materials, he often fails in the
execution. His reaſonings and his proofs are
feeble; but the boldneſs with which he writes
makes the reader loſe ſight of all his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
               <p>He begins with alledging, that the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the deluge, was very different from what
it is now. It was at firſt, ſays he, a fluid maſs,
compoſed of matters of every ſpecies, and of all
kinds of figures, the heavieſt of which deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the centre, and there formed a hard and
ſolid body. The waters took their ſtation round
this body; and all lighter fluids roſe above the
water. Thus, between the coat of air, and that
of water, was interpoſed a coat of oily matter.
But, as the air was then full of impurities, and
contained great quantities of earthy particles,
theſe gradually ſubſided upon the coat or ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
of oil, and formed a cruſt compoſed of
earth and oil: This cruſt was the firſt habitable
part of the earth, and the firſt abode of man
and other animals. This land was light, fat,
and adapted to foſter the tenderneſs of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
germs. The ſurface of the earth was level
and uniform, without mountains, ſeas, or other
inequalities. But it remained in this ſtare about
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0195400701:136"/>
ſixteen centuries only; for the heat of the ſun
gradually drying the cruſt, produced, at firſt,
only ſuperficial fiſſures or cracks; but, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of time, theſe fiſſures penetrated deeper, and
increaſed ſo much in their dimenſions, that, at
laſt, they entirely perforated the cruſt. In an
inſtant, the whole earth ſpilt in pieces, and fell
into the great abyſs of waters which it formerly
ſurrounded. This great event was the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
deluge.</p>
               <p>But all theſe maſſes of earth, in falling into
the abyſs, carried along with them vaſt quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of air, and they daſhed againſt each other,
and accumulated and divided ſo irregularly, that
great cavities filled with air were left between
them. The waters gradually opened paſſages
into theſe cavities, and, in proportion as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
were filled with the water, the ſurface of
the earth began to diſcover itſelf in the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated
places; and, at laſt, the waters appeared
no where but in thoſe extenſive valleys which
contain the ocean. Thus our ocean is a part of
the antient abyſs; the reſt of it remains in the
internal cavities, with which the ſea has ſtill a
communication. Iſlands and ſea-rocks are the
ſmall fragments, and continents are the large
maſſes of the antient cruſt. As both the rupture
and fall of this cruſt were effected in a ſudden
and confuſed manner, it is not ſurpriſing that
the ſurface of the preſent earth ſhould be full
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0195400701:137"/>
of mountains, gulfs, plains, and irregularities
of every kind.</p>
               <p>This ſpecimen is ſufficient to give an idea of
Burnet's ſyſtem. It is an elegant romance, a
book which may be read for amuſement, but
which cannot convey any inſtruction. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
was ignorant of the chief phaenomena of
the earth, and a man of no obſervation. He
has drawn every thing from imagination, which
often acts againſt both truth and reaſon.</p>

               <head>Of the Syſtem of Woodward<note n="*" place="bottom">An Eſſay towards the Natural Hiſtory of the Earth, by John Woodward.</note>.</head>
               <p>OF this author, it may be ſaid, that he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to build an immenſe edifice upon a
foundation leſs firm than ſand, and to conſtruct
a world with duſt; for he aſſerts, that the earth,
at the time of the deluge, ſuffered a total diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
In peruſing his book, the firſt idea that
preſents itſelf is, that this diſſolution was effected
by the waters of the great abyſs. He alledges,
that, at the command of God, the abyſs ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opened, and diffuſed ſuch an enormous quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of water on the ſurface, as was ſufficient
to cover the tops of the higheſt mountains; and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0195400701:139"/>
that God ſuſpended the law of coheſion, which
inſtantly reduced every ſolid ſubſtance into a
powder, &amp;c. He did not conſider, that, by
theſe ſuppoſitions, he added to the miracle of
the univerſal deluge many other miracles, or,
at leaſt, phyſical impoſſibilities, which accord
neither with the ſcriptures, nor with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of mathematics and of natural philoſophy.
But, as this author has the merit of collecting
many important obſervations, and, as he knew
better than any former writer the materials of
which the globe is compoſed, his ſyſtem, though
ill conceived, and worſe arranged, by the luſtre
of a few ſtriking facts, has ſeduced many weak
men into a belief of his general concluſions.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now give a ſhort view of his theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
by which we will be enabled to do juſtice to
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the author, and put the reader in
a condition of judging of the futility of his ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,
and of the falſhood of ſome of his remarks.
Mr Woodward informs us, that he recogniſed
with his own eyes all the materials of which
the earth in England is compoſed, from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to the greateſt depths that had been dug;
that they were all diſpoſed in beds, or ſtrata;
and that, in many of theſe beds, there are ſhells
and other productions of the ſea. He then
adds, that he was aſſured by his friends and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents,
that, in all the other countries of the
world, the earth was compoſed of the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials;
and that ſhells are found, not only in the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0195400701:140"/>
plains, and in ſome particular parts, but on the
higheſt mountains, in the deepeſt pits, and in an
infinite number of different places. He obſerved,
that the beds were all horizontal, and placed
over each other, like matters tranſported by the
waters, and depoſited in the form of ſediment.
Theſe general remarks, which are founded in
truth, are followed with ſome particular obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
by which he demonſtrates, that the foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil
ſhells incorporated with the ſtrata are real
ſea-ſhells, and not peculiar minerals, <hi>luſus natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>To theſe obſervations, though partly made
before him, he has added others of a more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious
nature. He aſſerts, that the materials of
the different ſtrata are arranged according to
their ſpecific gravities. This aſſertion is not
conſiſtent with truth. We every day ſee ſolid
rocks placed above clay, ſand, pit-coal, bitumen,
which have unqueſtionably a greater ſpecific gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
than the latter materials. If, indeed, it
were uniformly found, through the whole earth,
that the upper ſtratum was bitumen, followed
ſucceſſively by ſtrata of chalk, marle, clay, ſand,
ſtone, marble, and metals, it would, in that caſe,
be probable that all thoſe materials had been
precipitated at once: And this our author affirms
with confidence, though the moſt ſuperficial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver
needs only his eyes to convince him, that
heavy ſtrata are often found above light ones;
and, conſequently, that theſe ſediments could
not be depoſited at the ſame time, but muſt have
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0195400701:141"/>
been tranſported and dropped by the ocean at
ſucceſſive periods. As this is the foundation
of Woodward's ſyſtem, and is manifeſtly falſe,
we ſhall follow him no farther than to ſhow
how an erroneous principle produces falſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and bad concluſions.</p>
               <p>All the ſtrata that compoſe the earth, ſays our
author, from the tops of the higheſt mountains
to the deepeſt mines, are placed according to
their reſpective ſpecific gravities. Hence, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
the whole muſt have been in a ſtate
of diſſolution, and precipitated at the ſame
time. But at what time, in what menſtruum,
was it diſſolved? In the water, ſays Mr Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and at the time of the deluge. But there
is not water enough on the globe to produce
this effect; for there is more land than water,
and the bottom of the ſea itſelf is earth. Very
well, he replies; but there is enough of water in
the central parts of the earth; and nothing more
was wanting than to beſtow on it the power
of diſſolving every terreſtrial ſubſtance, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſea-ſhells; to find a proper method of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the waters return to the abyſs; and to
make all this correſpond with the hiſtory of the
deluge. Behold a ſyſtem, of which the author
could not prevail on himſelf to form a doubt;
for, when it was objected to him, that water
could not diſſolve marble, rocks, and metals, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in 40 days, the time of the waters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
on the earth; he replied ſimply, that
the event, however, did happen. When it was
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0195400701:142"/>
demanded of him, how the waters of the abyſs
could diſſolve the whole earth, and yet preſerve
the ſhells? He anſwered, that he never proved
that this water was a diſſolvent; but that, from
facts, it was clear that the earth had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
and that the ſhells were preſerved. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
When it was demonſtrated to him, that his
ſyſtem was uſeleſs, as it was neither ſupported
by reaſon nor by facts; he ſaid, we had only to
ſuppoſe, that, at the time of the deluge, the laws
of gravity and of coheſion were ſuddenly ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and, upon this ſuppoſition, the diſſolution
of the antient world admitted of an eaſy expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
But, it was obſerved to him, if the force
of coheſion was ſuſpended, Why were not the
ſhells diſſolved along with the reſt? Here he
gave a harangue on the organization of ſhells
and of animal bones, tending to prove that their
texture was fibrous, and different from that of
minerals; that their coheſion was likewiſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;
and that, after all, we have only to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that the powers of gravity and of coheſion
did not entirely ceaſe, but that they were dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
to ſuch a degree, as enabled them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
the parts of minerals, but not thoſe of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
I ſhall conclude with remarking, that
our author's philoſophy was not equal to his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
for obſervation; it is therefore unneceſſary
to give a formal refutation of abſurd notions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
when they proceed upon conjectures
that are contrary both to the laws of probability
and of mechanics.</p>

THEORY OF THE EARTH.</head>
               <head>ARTICLE V.</head>
               <head>Examination of ſome other Syſtems.</head>
               <p>THE three hypotheſes juſt mentioned have
many things in common: They all agree
in this point, that, at the time of the deluge,
both the external and internal form of the earth
was changed: But none of theſe theoriſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
that the earth, before the deluge, was
inhabited by the ſame ſpecies of men and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;
and, conſequently, that it muſt have been
nearly the ſame, both in figure and ſtructure, as
it is at preſent. We are informed by the ſacred
writings, that, before the deluge, there were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
ſeas, mountains, and foreſts; that moſt of
theſe mountains and rivers remained nearly in
their former ſituation; the Tigris and Euphrates,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0195400701:144"/>
for example, ran through Paradiſe; that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian
mountain on which the ark reſted was,
at the deluge, one of the higheſt mountains of
the earth, as it is at this day; and that the ſame
plants and the ſame animals which inhabited
the earth before the deluge, continue ſtill to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt;
for we are told of the ſerpent, of the crow,
and of the pigeon that carried the olive branch
into the ark. Tournefort indeed alledges, that
there are no olives within 400 leagues of Mount
Araret, and affects to be witty on this head. It
is, however, indiſputable, that there were olives
in the neighbourhood of this mountain at the
time of the deluge; for Moſes aſſures us of the
fact in the moſt expreſs manner. Beſides, it is
not ſurpriſing, that, in the courſe of 4000 years,
the olives ſhould be extirpated in theſe provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and multiplied in others. It is, therefore,
contrary both to ſcripture and reaſon, that theſe
authors have ſuppoſed the earth, before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
to have been totally different from what it
is now; and this oppoſition between their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes
and the ſacred writings, as well as ſound
philoſophy, is ſufficient to diſcredit their ſyſtems,
although they ſhould correſpond with ſome phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena<note n="*" place="bottom">See Voyage du Levant, vol. 2. p. 336.</note>.
Burnet, who wrote firſt, gives nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
facts nor obſervations in ſupport of his
ſyſtem. Woodward's book is only a ſhort eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,
in which he promiſes much more than he
was able to perform; it is only a project, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any degree of execution. He makes uſe of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0195400701:145"/>
two general remarks, 1. That the earth is every
where compoſed of materials which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been in a ſtate of fluidity, and which had
been depoſited by the waters in horizontal beds.
2. That, in the bowels of many parts of the
earth, there are an infinite number of ſea-bodies.
To account for theſe facts, he was recourſe to
the univerſal deluge; or rather, he appears to
employ theſe as proofs of the deluge. But, like
Burnet, he falls into evident contradictions; for
it is abſurd to ſuppoſe, with theſe authors, that,
before the deluge, there were no mountains,
ſince we are expreſsly told, that the waters roſe
15 cubits above the tops of the higheſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
On the other hand, it is not ſaid, that
the waters deſtroyed or diſſolved the mountains.
In place of this extraordinary diſſolution, the
mountains remained firm in their original ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations,
and the ark reſted upon the one which
was firſt deſerted by the waters. Beſides, it is
impoſſible to imagine, that, during the ſhort
time the deluge continued, the waters could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
the mountains, and the whole fabric of the
earth. Is it not abſurd to ſuppoſe, that, in the
ſpace of forty days, the hardeſt rocks and mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
were diſſolved by ſimple water? Is it not
a manifeſt contradiction to admit this total diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
and yet to maintain that ſhells, bones,
and other productions of the ſea, were able to
reſiſt a menſtruum, to which the moſt ſolid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
had yielded? Upon the whole, I cannot
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0195400701:146"/>
heſitate in pronouncing, that Woodward, though
furniſhed with excellent facts and obſervations,
has produced but a weak and inconſiſtent theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>Whiſton, who wrote laſt, has greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
upon the other two; and, though he
has given looſe reins to his imagination, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſaid that he falls into contradiction. He
advances many things that are incredible; but
they are neither abſolutely nor apparently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.
As we are ignorant of what materials
the centre of the earth is compoſed, he thinks
himſelf entitled to ſuppoſe it a ſolid nucleus,
ſurrounded with a ring of heavy fluid matter,
and then follows a ring of water, upon which
the external cruſt is ſupported. In this ring of
water, the different parts of the cruſt ſunk more
or leſs in proportion to their gravities, and gave
riſe to mountains and inequalities on the ſurface
of the earth. But our aſtronomer here commits
a blunder in mechanics. He conſidered not,
that the earth, on this ſuppoſition, muſt have
formed one uniform arch; and, conſequently,
that it could not be ſupported by the water, and
far leſs could any part of this arch ſink deeper
than another. If this be excepted, I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he has fallen into any other phyſical blunder:
He has, however, committed many errors both
in metaphyſics and theology. In fine, it cannot
be denied abſolutely, that the earth, in meeting
with the tail of a comet, would be deluged, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0195400701:147"/>
if it be allowed to the author, that the
tails of comets contain watery vapours. Neither
is it abſolutely impoſſible, that the tail of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
in returning from its perihelion, ſhould
burn the earth, if we ſuppoſe, with Mr Whiſton,
that the comet paſſed very near the ſun's body.
The ſame obſervations may be made upon the
reſt of his ſyſtem. But, though his notions be
not abſolutely impoſſible, when taken ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they are ſo exceedingly improbable, that the
whole aſſemblage may be regarded as exceeding
the bounds of human credulity.</p>
               <p>Theſe three are not the only books that have
been written upon the theory of the earth. In
1729, M. Bourguet publiſhed, along with his
<hi>Philoſophical Letters on the formation of Salts, &amp;c.</hi>
a memoir, in which he gives a ſpecimen of a
ſyſtem which he had projected; but the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it was prevented by the death of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
It muſt be acknowledged, that no man
was more induſtrious and acute in making ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
and in collecting facts. To him we
are indebted for remarking the correſpondence
between the angles of mountains, which is the
chief key to the theory of the earth. He ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranges
the materials he had collected in the beſt
order. But, with all theſe advantages, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that he would not have ſucceeded in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a phyſical hiſtory of the changes that have
happened in the earth; and he appears not to
have diſcovered the cauſes of thoſe effects which
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0195400701:148"/>
he relates. To be convinced of this, we have
only to take a view of the propoſitions he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
from thoſe phaenomena which behoved
to be the foundation of his theory. He ſays,
that the earth was formed at once, and not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively;
that its figure and diſpoſition demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
that it was formerly in a fluid ſtate; that
the preſent condition of the earth is very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
from what it was ſome ages after its firſt
formation; that the matter of the globe was
originally more ſoft than after its ſurface was
changed; that the condenſation of its ſolid parts
diminiſhed gradually with its velocity; ſo that,
after a certain number of revolutions round its
own axis, and round the ſun, its original ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was ſuddenly diſſolved; that this happened
at the vernal equinox; that the ſea-ſhells inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
themſelves into the diſſolved matters;
that the earth, after this diſſolution, aſſumed its
preſent form; and that, as ſoon as the fire or
heat operated upon it, its conſumption gradually
began, and, at ſome future period, it will be
blown up with a dreadful exploſion, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with a general conflagration, which will
augment the atmoſphere, and diminiſh the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
of the globe; and then the earth, in place
of ſtrata of ſand or clay, will conſiſt only of
beds of calcined materials, and mountains com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of amalgams of different metals.</p>
               <p>This is a ſufficient view of the ſyſtem which
M. Bourguet deſigned to compoſe. To gueſs at
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0195400701:149"/>
the paſt, and to predict the future, nearly in the
ſame manner as others have gueſſed and predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
requires but a ſmall effort of genius. This
author had more erudition than ſound and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
ideas. He appears not to have had the
capacity of forming enlarged views, or of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
the chain of cauſes and effects.</p>
               <p>In the Leipſic Tranſactions, the celebrated
Leibnitz publiſhed a ſketch of an oppoſite ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem,
under the title of Protogaea. The earth,
according to Bourguet and others, was to be
conſumed by fire. But Leibnitz maintains, that
it originated from fire, and that it has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
innumerable changes and revolutions. At
the time that Moſes tells us the light was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the darkneſs, the greateſt part of the
earth was in flames. The planets, as well as the
earth, were originally fixed and luminous ſtars.
After burning for many ages, he alledges, that
they were extinguiſhed from a deficiency of
combuſtible matter, and that they became o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paque
bodies. The fire, by melting the matter,
produced a vitrified cruſt; and the baſis of all
terreſtrial bodies is glaſs, of which ſand and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
are only the fragments. The other ſpecies
of earth reſulted from a mixture of ſand with
water and fixed ſalts; and, when the cruſt had
cooled, the moiſt particles, which had been ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
in the form of vapour, fell down, and
formed the ocean. Theſe waters at firſt cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the whole ſurface, and even overtopped the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0195400701:150"/>
higheſt mountains. In the eſtimation of this
author, the ſhells, and other ſpoils of the ocean,
which every where abound, are indelible proofs
that the earth was formerly covered with the
ſea; and the great quantity of fixed ſalts, of
ſand, and of other melted and calcined matters
ſhut up in the bowels of the earth, demonſtrate,
that the conflagration had been general, and that
it had preceded the exiſtence of the ocean.
Theſe ideas, though deſtitute of evidence, are
elevated, and bear conſpicuous marks of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity.
The thoughts have a connection, the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes
are not impoſſible, and the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that might be drawn from them are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory.
But the great defect of this theory
is, that it applies not to the preſent ſtate of the
earth. It only explains what paſſed in ages ſo
remote, that few veſtiges remain; a man may,
therefore, affirm what he pleaſes, and what he
ſays will be accompanied with more or leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
in proportion to the extent of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents.
To maintain, with Whiſton, that the
earth was originally a comet, or with Leibnitz,
that it was a fun, is to aſſert what is equally
poſſible or impoſſible; it would, therefore, be
ridiculous to inveſtigate either by the laws of
probability. The inſtantaneouſneſs of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
deſtroys the notion of the globe's being
covered with the ocean, and of that being the
reaſon why ſea-ſhells are ſo much diffuſed
through different parts of the earth; for, if that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0195400701:151"/>
had been the caſe, it muſt of neceſſity be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that ſhells, and other productions of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,
which are ſtill found in the bowels of the
earth, were created long prior to man, and other
land-animals. Now, independent of ſcripture-authority,
is it not reaſonable to think that the
origin of all kinds of animals and vegetables is
equally antient?</p>
               <p>M. Scheutzer, in a diſſertation addreſſed to
the Academy of Sciences in 1708, attributes,
like Woodward, the change, or rather new cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the globe, to the deluge. To account
for the formation of mountains, he tells us, that
God, when he ordered the waters to return to
their ſubterraneous abodes, broke, with his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
hand, many of the horizontal ſtrata, and
elevated them above the ſurface of the earth,
which was originally level. The whole diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
was compoſed with a view to ſupport this
ridiculous opinion. As it was neceſſary that
theſe eminences ſhould be of a ſolid conſiſtence,
Mr Scheutzer remarks, that God only raiſed them
from places which abounded in ſtones. Hence,
ſays he, thoſe countries, like Switzerland, which
are very ſtony, are likewiſe mountainous; and
thoſe, like Flanders, Holland, Hungry, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
which are moſtly compoſed of ſand and
clay to great depths, have few or no moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Hiſt. de l'Acad, 1708, p. 32.</note>.</p>

This author, like Woodward, blends phyſics
and theology; and, though he has made ſome
good obſervations, the ſyſtematic part of his
work is weaker and more puerile than that of
any of his predeceſſors. He has even deſcended
to declamation, and abſurd pleaſantries. The
reader, if he deſires to ſee them, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
his <hi>Piſcium Quaerelae,</hi> &amp;c. not to mention
his <hi>Phyſica Sacra,</hi> in ſeveral volumes in folio, a
weak performance, fitter for the amuſement of
children, than the inſtruction of men.</p>
               <p>Steno, and ſome others, have attributed the
origin of mountains, and other inequalities, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſurface of the earth, to particular inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
earthquakes, &amp;c. But the effects of
theſe ſecondary cauſes could produce nothing
but ſlight changes. Theſe cauſes may co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with the firſt cauſe, namely, the tides, and
the motion of the ſea from eaſt to weſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
Steno has given no theory, nor even any
general facts, upon this ſubject<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Diſſert. de Solido intra Solidum nato, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
               <p>Ray alledges, that all mountains have been
produced by earthquakes, and has written a
treatiſe to prove it. When we come to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of volcano's, we ſhall examine the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of this opinion.</p>
               <p>We cannot omit obſerving here, that Burnet,
Whiſton, Woodward, and moſt other authors,
have fallen into an error which deſerves to be
rectified. They uniformly regard the deluge as
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0195400701:153"/>
an effect within the compaſs of natural cauſes,
although the ſcripture repreſents it as an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
operation of the Deity. It is beyond the
power of any natural cauſe to produce on the
ſurface of the earth a quantity of water ſufficient
to cover the higheſt mountains: And, although
a cauſe could be imagined adequate to this effect,
it would ſtill be impoſſible to find another cauſe
capable of making the waters diſappear. Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Whiſton's waters proceeded from the
tail of a comet, we deny that any of them could
iſſue from the abyſs, or that the whole could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into it; for the abyſs, according to him, was
ſo environed, and preſſed on all ſides by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial
cruſt, that it was impoſſible the comet's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
could produce the leaſt motion in the
fluids it contained, far leſs any motion reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the tides: Hence, not a ſingle drop could
either proceed from, or enter into the great
abyſs. Unleſs, therefore, it be ſuppoſed, that
the waters which fell from the comet were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated
by a miracle, they would for ever have
remained on the ſurface, and covered the tops
of the higheſt mountains. The impoſſibility of
explaining any effect by natural cauſes, is the
moſt eſſential character of a miracle. Our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have made ſeveral vain efforts to account
for the deluge. Their errors in phyſics, and in
the ſecondary cauſes they employ, prove the
truth of the fact, as related in ſcripture, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,
that the univerſal deluge could not be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0195400701:154"/>
accompliſhed by any other cauſe than the will
of the Deity.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is apparent, that it was not at one
time, nor by the ſudden effect of a deluge
that the ſea left uncovered thoſe continents
which we inhabit: It is certain, from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of ſcripture, that the terreſtrial Paradiſe
was in Aſia, and that Aſia was inhabited before
the deluge; conſequently, the waters, at that
period, covered not this large portion of the
globe. The earth, before the deluge, was near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ſame as now. This enormous quantity of
water, poured out by Divine juſtice upon guilty
men, deſtroyed every living creature; but it
produced no change on the ſurface of the earth;
it deſtroyed not even the plants which grew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; for the pigeon returned to the ark with
an <hi>olive branch</hi> in her bill.</p>
               <p>Why then ſhould we ſuppoſe, with many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts,
that the waters of the deluge totally
changed the ſurface of the globe, even to the
depth of two thouſand feet? Why imagine that
the deluge tranſported thoſe ſhells which are
found at the depth of ſeven or eight hundred feet,
immerſed in rocks and in marble? Why refer to
this event the formation of hills and mountains?
And how is it poſſible to imagine, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the deluge tranſported banks of ſhells of
100 leagues in length? I perceive not how they
can perſiſt in this opinion, unleſs they admit a
double miracle, one to create water, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0195400701:155"/>
to tranſport ſhells. But, as the firſt only is
ſupported by holy writ, I ſee no reaſon for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the ſecond an article of faith.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, if the waters of the deluge
had retired ſuddenly, they would have tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſuch immenſe quantities of mud and other
impurities, as would have rendered the land un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
for culture till many ages after the inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In the inundation which happened in
Greece, the country that was covered remained
barren for three centuries<note n="*" place="bottom">Vida acta erudit. Lipſ. 1691, p. 100.</note>. Thus the deluge
ought to be regarded as a ſupernatural mode of
chaſtifing the wickedneſs of men, not as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
proceeding from any natural cauſe. The
univerſal deluge was a miracle, both in its
cauſe and in its effects. It appears from the
ſacred text, that the ſole deſign of the deluge
was the deſtruction of men and other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
and that it changed not in any manner
the ſurface of the earth; for, after the retreat
of the waters, the mountains, and even the trees,
kept their former ſtations, and the land was ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the culture of vines and other fruits of
the earth. It might be aſked, if the earth was
diſſolved in the waters, or, if the waters were ſo
much agitated as to tranſport the ſhells of India
into Europe, how the fiſhes, which entered not
into the ark, were perſerved?</p>
               <p>The notion, that the ſhells were tranſported
and left upon the land by the deluge, is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0195400701:156"/>
opinion, or rather ſuperſtition, of natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.
Woodward, Scheutzer, and others, call
petrified ſhells the remains of the deluge; they
regard them as medals or monuments left us by
God of this dreadful cataſtrophe, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
of it might never be effaced among men.
Laſtly, they have embraced this hypotheſis with
ſo blind a veneration, that they are only anxious
to reconcile it with holy writ; and, in place of
deriving any light from obſervation and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
they wrap themſelves up in the dark clouds
of phyſical theology, the obſcurity and littleneſs
of which derogates from the ſimplicity and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of religion, and preſents to the ſceptic no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a ridiculous medley of human conceits
and divine truths. To attempt an explanation
of the univerſal deluge and of its phyſical cauſes;
to pretend to give a detail of what paſſed during
this great revolution; to conjecture what effects
have reſuited from it; to add facts to the ſacred
writings, ad to draw conſequences from theſe
interpolated facts; is not this a preſumptuous
deſire of ſcanning the power of the Almighty?
The natural wonders wrought by his beneficent
hand, in a uniform and regular manner, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
incomprehenſible; his extraordinary
operations, or his miracles, ought, therefore, to
impreſs us with an awful aſtoniſhment, and a
ſilent reſpect.</p>
               <p>It may ſtill be urged, that as the univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge

upon its conſequences? True. But you muſt
commence with acknowledging, that the deluge
could not poſſibly be the effect of any phyſical
cauſe, you muſt regard it as an immediate ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the divine will; you muſt content your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with what is recorded in ſcripture; and you
muſt, above all, avoid bleding bad philoſophy
with the purity of divine truth. After taking
theſe precautions, which a reſpect for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of the Almighty requires, what remains for
examination upon the ſubject of the deluge?
Does the ſcared writings tell us that the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
were formed by the deluge? They tell us the
reverſe. Do they inform us, that the agitation
of the waters was ſo great, as to raiſe the ſhells
from the bottom of the ocean, and to diſperſe
them over the face of the earth? No: The ark
moved gently on the ſurface of the waters. Do
they tell us, that the earth ſuffered a total diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution?
By no means. The narration of the
ſacred hiſtorian is ſimple and true; that of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts
is fabuious and complicated.</p>

               <p>THE ſurface of the earth, like that of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,
is not divided into alternate bands
or belts, parallel to the Aequator. It, on the
contrary, is divided, from one pole to the other,
into two belts of earth, and two of ſea. The
firſt and principal belt is the antient Continent,
the greateſt length of which is a line commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
at the moſt eaſtern point of the north of
Tartary, and extending from thence to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of the gulf of Linchidolin, where the
Ruſſians fiſh whales; from thence to Tobolſki;
from Tobolſki to the Caſpin ſea; from the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian
ſea to Mecca; from Mecca to the weſtern
part of the country inhabited by the Galli in


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0195400701:163"/>
Africa; from thence to Monoemuci, or Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motapa;
and, laſtly, to the Cape of Good Hope.
This line is about 3600 leagues in length, and
is never interrupted but by the Caſpian and the
Red Sea, the breadth of which is inconſiderable,
and ought not to be regarded, eſpecially when,
like our ſeaſons, the whole ſurface of the globe
is divided only into four parts.</p>
               <p>This greateſt length of the Old Continent lies
in a diagonal line; for, if meaſured by a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
it will be found, that, from the northmoſt
point of Lapland to the Cape of Good Hope,
exceeds not 2500 leagues; and that this line,
though ſhorter, meets with greater interruptions
from the Baltic and Mediterranean. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to all other lines that could be drawn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſame meridians in the Old Continent,
they muſt ſtill be leſs than thoſe we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
For example, from the moſt ſouthern
point of the Iſland of Ceylon to the northern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
coaſt of Nova Zembla, is 1800 leagues. In
the ſame manner, if the continent be meaſured
by lines parallel to the equator, its greateſt length,
without much interruption by ſeas, will be found
to ſtretch from Trefana, on the weſt coaſt of
Africa, to Ninpo, on the eaſt coaſt of China,
which is about 2800 leagues. Another line may
begin near Breſt, and extend to the coaſt of Chineſe
Tartary, which will be nearly 2300 leagues.
From Bergen in Norway, to the coaſt of Kamt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchatka,
is only 1800 leagues. All theſe lines

                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0195400701:165"/>
are much ſhorter than the firſt. Thus the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
length of the Old Continent extends from
the eaſtern point of Tartary to the Cape of Good
Hope, and is about 3600 leagues. <hi>See plate I.
of Geogr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This line may be conſidered as the middle of
the antient Continent; for, in meaſuring the
ſurface on each ſide of it, I find, that, on the
left, there are 2471092¾ ſquare leagues; and,
on the right, there are 2469687, which is an
equality ſo ſurpriſing as to render it extremely
probable that this line, which is the longeſt, at
the ſame time really divides the contents of the
antient Continent.</p>
               <p>The Old Continent, then, conſiſts of about
4940780 ſquare leagues, which is a fifth part of
the ſurface of the globe, and may be regarded
as a large belt of earth, with an inclination to
the equator of about 30 degrees.</p>
               <p>The New Continent is another belt of earth,
the greateſt length of which may be taken from
the mouth of the river Plata to the lake of the
Aſſiniboils. This line paſſes from the mouth
of the river Plata to lake Caracara; from
thence to Mataguais, Pocona, Zongo, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,
Morua, St Fe, and Carthagena; then it
paſſes through the gulf of Mexico, and Jamaica,
and Cuba; from thence along the peninſula of
Florida, through Apalache, Chicachas; and from
thence to St Louis, Fort le Sueur, and terminates
in the country bordering on lake Aſſiniboils, the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0195400701:166"/>
extent of which is unknown. <hi>See plate II. of
Geogr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This line is only interrupted by the Gulf of
Mexico, (which may be conſidered as a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean
ſea), is about 2500 leagues in length,
and divides the New Continent nearly into two
equal parts, that on the left containing 1069286⅚ leagues ſquare, and that on the right 1070926 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>/12.
It is the middle of the belt of land called the
New Continent, and is likewiſe inclined to the
equator about 30 degrees, but in an oppoſite
direction; for that of the Old Continent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
from the north-eaſt to the ſouth-weſt; but
that of the New Continent from north-weſt to
ſouth-eaſt. The ſuperficial contents of the Old
and New Continents are about 7080993 ſquare
leagues, which is not near a third part of the
ſurface of the globe, which contains 25,000,000
ſquare leagues.</p>
               <p>Of theſe lines, which divide both the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
into two equal parts, it may be remarked,
that they both terminate at the ſame degrees
of north and ſouth latitude; and that the two
Continents make mutual advances, or projections,
exactly oppoſite to each other, viz. thoſe on the
African coaſt, from the Canary iſles to Guiney;
and thoſe of America, from Guiana to the
mouth of the Rio-Janeiro.</p>
               <p>It is, therefore, apparent, that the moſt antient
lands on the globe are thoſe which extend from
200 to 250 leagues on each ſide of the two lines
<pb facs="tcp:0195400701:167"/>
                  <figure>

                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0195400701:168"/>
above deſcribed. Agreeable to this idea, which
is founded on the obſervations already made, we
find, that, in the Old Continent, the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
countries of Africa are thoſe which ſtretch
from the Cape of Good Hope to the Red Sea
and Aegypt, and are about 500 leagues broad;
and, conſequently, that the whole weſtern coaſt
of Africa, from Guiney to the Straits of Gibral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
are new lands. In the ſame manner, if we
trace this line through Aſia, and include an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
breadth, we ſhall find, that the moſt antient
countries are, the two Arabia's, Perſia, Georgia,
Turcomania, a part of Independent Tartary,
Circaſſia, part of Muſcovy, &amp;c.; and, of courſe,
that Europe, and perhaps alſo China and the
eaſtern part of Tartary, are comparatively new
countries.</p>
               <p>In the New Continent, we ſhall likewiſe find,
that Terra Magellanica, the eaſtern part of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil,
of the country of the Amazons, of Guiana,
and of Canada, are new lands when compared
with Tucuman, Peru, Terra Firma, the iſlands
in the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, the Miſſiſippi,
and Mexico. To theſe obſervations may be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
two remarkable facts. The Old and New
Continents are nearly oppoſite to each other.
The Old Continent extends farther north of the
equator than ſouth; but the New, farther ſouth
than north. The centre of the Old Continent
lies in the 16th or 18th degree of north latitude;
and the centre of the New Continent lies in the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0195400701:169"/>
16th or 18th degree of ſouth latitude, as if they
were intended to counterbalance each other.
There is another ſingular analogy between the
two continents, though it appears to be more the
effect of accident than thoſe juſt mentioned.
Both continents might be divided into two por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which would be ſurrounded on all ſides by
the ſea, excepting the two ſmall iſthmus's of
Suez and Panama.</p>
               <p>Theſe general obſervations on the diviſion of
the globe are the reſult of an attentive ſurvey.
We ſhall not, upon this foundation, erect hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes,
or indulge in reaſonings, which might
lead to falſe concluſions. But, as the diviſion
of the globe has never hitherto been conſidered
under this point of view, I ſhall hazard a few
remarks. It is not a little ſingular, that the
longeſt line that can be drawn upon the two
continents ſhould, at the ſame time, divide them
into two equal parts. It is not leſs remarkable,
that theſe two lines ſhould commence and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
at the ſame degrees of latitude, and have
the ſame inclination to the equator. Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
may lead to general concluſions, of which
we are ſtill ignorant. We ſhall afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine,
in detail, the inequalities in the figure of
the two continents, and ſhall only here remark,
that the moſt antient countries ſhould be found
in the neighbourhood of the above lines, and
ſhould, at the ſame time, have the higheſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and that the more recent lands ſhould
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0195400701:170"/>
be moſt remote from them, and likewiſe lie
lower. Agreeable to this idea, the neweſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
in America would be the land of the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons,
Guiana, and Canada. In examining the
map of theſe countries, we perceive that they
are every where divided by numberleſs lakes
and rivers, which is a ſtill ſtronger indication of
their recent origin. On the other hand, Tucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Peru, and Mexico, are high mountains,
and are ſituate near the line that divides the
continent; circumſtances which ſeem to prove
the ſuperior antiquity of theſe countries. Africa
is alſo extremely mountainous, and at the ſame
time very antient. In this part of the globe,
Aegypt, Barbary, and the weſtern coaſt, as far
as Senegal, can only be conſidered as new lands.
Aſia is perhaps the moſt antient of all countries,
eſpecially Arabia, Perſia, and Tartary. But the
inequalities of this great diviſion of the globe,
as well as thoſe of Europe, ſhall be treated in a
ſeparate article. We ſhall only remark, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
that Europe is a new country, as appears
from thoſe univerſal traditions concerning mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations
of different nations, and the origin of
arts and ſciences. It is not long ſince Europe
was full of marſhes and foreſts. But, in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
antiently inhabited, there are few woods,
lakes, or marſhes, a great deal of heath and
ſhrubs, and many high mountains, with dry and
barren tops; for men deſtroy woods, drain
marſhes and lakes, and, in proceſs of time, give
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0195400701:171"/>
an appearance to the face of the earth totally
different from that of uninhabited or newly
peopled countries.</p>
               <p>A ſmall portion of the globe only was known
to the antients. The whole of America, the
Artic circle, Terra Auſtralis and Magellanica,
and a great part of the interior regions of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
were unknown to them. They knew not
that the Torrid Zone was inhabited, although
they had ſailed round Africa. About 2200
years ago, Neco King of Aegypt furniſhed ſome
veſſels to the Phoenicians, who ſailed down the
Red Sea, doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and
the third year after their departure they entered
the Mediterranean by the Straits of Gibraltar<note n="*" place="bottom">See Herodotus, lib. 4.</note>.
The antients, notwithſtanding, were totally ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the polarity of the loadſtone, although
they knew its power of attracting iron; they
knew not the cauſe of the tides; and they were
uncertain whether the ocean ſurrounded the
globe. Some of them, indeed, ſuſpected that it
might be ſo; but theſe conjectures were ſo ill
founded, that none of them ever dreamed of its
being poſſible to circumnavigate the earth. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellan,
in the year 1519, was the firſt who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
this great voyage; and he accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in 1124 days. Francis Drake, in the 1577,
was the ſecond; and he performed it in 1056
days. Thomas Cavendiſh ſet out upon this
voyage in 1586, and finiſhed it in 777 days.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0195400701:172"/>
Theſe celebrated navigators were the firſt
who gave a phyſical demonſtration of the ſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricity
and extent of the circumference of the
earth. The antients, though they travelled
much, had no adequate idea of the extent of the
globe. They were equally ignorant of the
trade-winds, which are ſo uſeful in long voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages.
Their limited knowledge in geography,
therefore, ought not to ſurpriſe us, eſpecially when
it is conſidered, that, notwithſtanding the many
advantages derived from the mathematical
ſciences, and from the diſcoveries of navigators,
many points remain ſtill undetermined, and vaſt
regions are yet undiſcovered. Of the countries
in the neighbourhood of the ſouth pole, we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know that they exiſt, and that they are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the other continents by the ocean<note n="*" place="bottom">Captain Cooke, in his late voyage, has demonſtrated, in the compleateſt manner, that no continent exiſts near the ſouth pole.</note>.
Much, likewiſe, remains to be diſcovered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the lands near the north pole: And, it
is a ſubject of regret, that, for a century paſt,
the ardour for diſcovering new countries has
greatly abated. The nations of Europe ſeem,
and perhaps they are right, more diſpoſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the value of thoſe countries they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
diſcovered, than to conquer new ones.</p>
               <p>The diſcovery, however, of the ſouthern con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
would be a grand object of curioſity,
and might be attended with the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.
A few of its coaſts have been recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
but thoſe navigators who have attempted
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0195400701:173"/>
the diſcovery, have been always prevented from
reaching land by large bodies of ice. The thick
fogs which infeſt thoſe ſeas is another obſtacle.
But, notwithſtanding all theſe inconveniencies,
it is probable, that, by ſetting out from the Cape
of Good Hope at different ſeaſons, part of this
new world might ſtill be diſcovered.</p>
               <p>But another method might, perhaps, be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with more ſucceſs. To avoid the fogs and
the ice, the diſcovery might be attempted, by
departing from Baldivia, or ſome other port on
the coaſt of Chili, and traverſiong the ſouth ſea
under the 50th degree of ſouth latitude. This
navigation appears not to be hazardous; and it
is probable that it would be attended with the
diſcovery of new lands; for the regions about
the ſouth pole, ſtill unknown, are ſo extenſive,
that they may be computed to be about a fourth
part of the globe; and conſequently may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a country as large as the whole of Europe,
Aſia, and Africa.</p>
               <p>While we remain ignorant of this part of the
earth, we cannot determine the proportion the
ſurface of the land bears to that of the ocean;
from what we do know, it appears that there is
more ſea than land.</p>
               <p>To acquire an idea of the vaſt quantity of
water in the ocean, we muſt ſuppoſe a medium
depth, for example, that of 200 fathoms, or the
ſixth part of a league. Upon this ſuppoſition,
there is as much water in the ocean as would be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0195400701:174"/>
ſufficient to cover the whole globe to the depth
of 600 feet; or, if collected into one maſs, it
would form a globe of 60 leagues in diameter.</p>
               <p>It is alledged by navigatiors, that the latitudes
near the ſouth pole are much colder than the
ſame latitudes towards the north. But this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
ſeems to have no foundation. It ſeems
to have been adopted from the circumſtance of
the ice appearing the latitudes where none is ever
found in the northern ſeas. But this effect may
be owing to ſome peculiar cauſes. After the
month of April, there is no ice on this ſide of
67 or 68 degrees of north latitude; and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages
of Acadia and of Canada ſay, that, if the
ice be not melted in April, it indicates a cold and
rainy ſummer. The year 1725 was diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by an almoſt perpetual rain; and in April,
the ice in the northern ſeas was not only not
melted at the 67th degree, but, on the 15th of
June, it was found in lat. 41 or 42<note n="*" place="bottom">See l'hiſt. de l'acad, anneé 1725.</note>.</p>
               <p>Great quantities of floating ice appear in the
north ſeas, eſpecially at conſiderable diſtances
from land. They come from the Tartarean ſea
into that of Nova Zembla and other parts of the
Frozen ocean. I have been aſſured by people
worthy of credit, that an Engliſh Captain, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Manſon, inſtead of ſearching for a paſſage
to China between the northern lands, directed
his courſe ſtraight to the pole till he arrived
within two degrees of it; and that, in this courſe,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0195400701:175"/>
he found an open ſea, and no ice; which is a
clear proof that the ice is always formed near
the land, and never in an extenſive ſea: For,
though it ſhould be ſuppoſed, contrary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
that the cold was ſo intenſe at the pole
as to freeze the ſurface of the ſea, it is ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable
how theſe enormous floating maſſes
could be formed, without being attached to the
land, from which they are again ſeparated by
the heat of the ſun. Two veſſels ſent by the
Eaſt India Company, in 1739, to diſcover land
in the ſouth ſeas, found boards of ice in lat. 47
or 48; but they were not very diſtant from the
ſhore, which was in view, though the veſſels
could not make their landing good<note n="*" place="bottom">See on this ſubject a Chart by M. Buache, 1739.</note>. Theſe
boards of ice muſt have been detached from the
lands in the neighbourhood of the ſouth pole;
and it may be conjectured that they follow the
courſe of ſome large rivers in theſe unknown
regions, in the ſame manner as the Oby, the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſca,
and other great rivers which fall into the
north ſeas, carry down boards of ice, which ſhut
up, during the greateſt part of the year, the ſtraits
of Waigat, and render the ſea of Tartary, by
this courſe, altogether inacceſſible; while, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Nova Zembla, and nearer the pole, where
there is little land and few rivers, boards of ice
are leſs frequent, and the ſea is more navigable.
Hence, if any farther attempts be made to find
a paſſage to China and Japan by the north ſeas,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0195400701:176"/>
it will, perhaps, be neceſſary to keep at a diſtance
from the land and the ice, to ſtear directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the pole, and to explore the moſt open
ſeas, where unqueſtionably there is little or no
ice: For it is well known, that ſalt water can
take on a greater degree of cold, without freezing,
than freſh water after it is congealed; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
the exceſſive cold at the pole may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſea colder than ice, without freezing its
ſurface. Beſides, at 80 or 82 degrees, the ſea,
though mixed with ſnow and freſh water, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
frozen, excepting near the coaſts. From
the united teſtimony of ſeveral navigators, it is
apparent, that there is a paſſage from Europe to
China by the north ſea: The reaſon why it
has ſo often been in vain attempted is, that fear
prevented the undertakers from keeping at a
ſufficient diſtance from the land, and from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
the pole, which they probably ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
to be an immenſe rock.</p>
               <p>William Barents, however, who, like many
others, had run aground in his voyage, never
doubted of the exiſtence of ſuch a paſſage, or
that, if he had kept farther from land, he would
have found an open ſea without ice. The Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian
navigators ſent by the Czar to reconnoitre
the north ſea, relate, that Nova Zembla is not
an iſland, but a part of Tartary, and that, to the
north of it, there is a free and open ſea. A
Dutch voyager affirms, that whales are occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
thrown upon the coaſts of Corea and of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0195400701:177"/>
Japan, with European harpoons ſticking in their
backs. Another Hollander alledges, that he had
penetrated to the pole itſelf, and aſſures us, that
it was as warm as at Amſterdam in ſummer.
One Goulden, an Engliſhman, who had made
above thirty voyages to Greenland, related to
Charles II. that two Dutchmen, who ſailed along
with him, having been unſucceſsful in fiſhing
off the coaſt of the Iſle of Edges, reſolved to
proceed northward; that, upon their return,
fifteen days after, they told him, that they had
been at the 89th degree of latitude, where they
found no ice, but an open, deep ſea, like that in
the Bay of Biſcay; and that they ſhowed him
the two ſhips journals, in ſupport of what they
advanced. In fine, it is related in the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Tranſactions, that two navigators, who
engaged in the diſcovery of this paſſage, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
300 leagues to the eaſt of Nova Zembla;
but that the Eaſt India Company, who thought
they had an intereſt in preventing the diſcovery,
allowed them not to return<note n="*" place="bottom">See Collect. of Voyages to the North, p. 200.</note>. But the Dutch
Eaſt India Company, who believed themſelves
intereſted in the diſcovery, having made unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſful
attempts on the European ſide, tried to
find it by the way of Japan; and they would
probably have ſucceeded, if the Emperor of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan
had not prohibited all ſtrangers from navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
on the coaſts of the lands of Jeſſo. This
paſſage, therefore, cannot be found but by
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0195400701:178"/>
ſteering directly to the pole beyond Spitzbergen,
or rather by keeping the open ſea between Nova
Zembla and Spitzbergen, under the 79th degree
of latitude. For the reaſons already given, there
is no occaſion to dread ice, even under the Pole
itſelf; for there is no example of a large ſea
freezing at a great diſtance from land. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſea that freezes totally is the Black Sea, which
is narrow, contains little ſalt, and receives from
the northern countries a number of rivers, and
large boards of ice. If we may credit hiſtorians,
this ſea, in the time of the Emperor Coprony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
froze to the depth of 30 cubits. This may
be an exaggeration: But that it freezes every
winter is certain, while open ſeas, 1000 leagues
nearer the Pole, never do. This can only be
explained from the ſuperior ſaltneſs, and the
comparatively ſmall quantity of ice-boards which
thoſe ſeas receive.</p>
               <p>Theſe boards of ice, which have been regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as invincible obſtacles to navigation near the
Poles, only prove the exiſtence of large rivers in
the neighbourhood of the places where they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
they alſo demonſtrate the exiſtence of vaſt
continents, from which theſe rivers derive their
ſources; and, therefore, we ought not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by their appearance: Beſides, very
little reflection will convince us, that theſe boards
of ice muſt be confined to particular places;
that it is impoſſible they ſhould occupy the
whole circle in which the ſouthern continent is
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0195400701:179"/>
ſuppoſed to be contained; and, therefore, if a
different route were taken, we have reaſon to
hope for ſucceſs. From the deſcription of New
Holland, given by Dampier, and others, it is
probable, that this part of Terra Auſtralis, which
is, perhaps, a part of the ſouthern continent, is a
country leſs antient than what remains to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.
New Holland lies low; it has neither
mountains nor rivers; it is thinly inhabited, and
the natives have no induſtry. All theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
induce us to think, that the ſavages of
New Holland are ſimilar to thoſe of the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons,
and of Paraguay in America. In Peru and
Mexico, which are the moſt elevated, and, of
courſe, the moſt antient countries of America,
the manners of the inhabitants were poliſhed;
and they were divided into diſtinct nations, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by ſovereigns and by laws. Savages, on
the contrary, are always found in low and new
countries. Hence we may preſume, that, in the
elevated and interior parts of the ſouthern con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
from which iſſue thoſe large rivers that
carry down boards of ice to the ſea, there are
men united by the bonds of ſociety.</p>
               <p>The interior parts of Africa are nearly as little
known to us as they were to the antients. They
had circumnavigated this immenſe peninſula;
but they have neither left us charts, nor deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of its coaſts. Pliny tells us, that this voyage
was performed in the days of Alexander the
Great; that the wrecks of ſome Spaniſh ſhips
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0195400701:180"/>
were found in the Arabian ſea; and that Hanno,
the Carthaginian general, had ſailed from Gades
to the Arabian gulf, and had written a relation
of the voyage. He farther informs us, that, in
the days of Cornelius Nepos, one Eudoxus,
who had been perſecuted by King Lathurus, was
obliged to fly; that he departed from the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic
gulf, and arrived at Gades; and that, previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to this period, Spain carried on a trade by
ſea with Aethiopia.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Plin. Hiſt. Nat. lib. 2.</note>. But, theſe antient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
notwithſtanding, we are of opinion, that
they never doubled the Cape of Good Hope;
and every man conſidered the voyage of the
Portugueſe to the Eaſt Indies as a new diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
It will not be incurious to ſee the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
entertained of this ſubject in the ninth
century. 'In our days, a diſcovery has been
made which was totally unknown to thoſe
who lived before us. No man believed, or
could ſuſpect, that the ſea which reaches from
the Indies to China had any communication
with the ſea of Syria. But we have lately
found, according to my information, in the
Mediterranean, or ſea of <hi>Roum,</hi> the wreck of
an Arabian ſhip which had been ſtaved to
pieces by a tempeſt; ſome of theſe pieces had
been carried, by the wind and the waves, into
the ſea of the Cozars; from thence round to the
Mediterranean, and along that ſea to the coaſt
of Syria. This is a demonſtration that the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0195400701:181"/>
ocean ſurrounds China and Cila, the extremity
of Turqueſton, and the country of the Cozars,
and that, at laſt, it enters by the Straits, and
waſhes the borders of Syria. The evidence
ariſes from the conſtruction of the veſſel; for
there are no ſhips but thoſe of Siraf whoſe
planks are not nailed. But the veſſel above
mentioned had all her planks ſtitched together
in a manner peculiar to the Arabians. But
all veſſels belonging to the Mediterranean, and
coaſt of Syria, have their timbers faſtened with
nails<note n="*" place="bottom">See Les anciennes relationes de voyages faits par terre a la Chine, p. 53.</note>.'</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſubjoin the remarks added by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator
of this antient relation.</p>
               <p>'Abuziel remarks, as a thing perfectly new,
that a veſſel had been carried from the Indian
ſea, and thrown upon the coaſt of Syria. To
find a paſſage for it into the Mediterranean,
he ſuppoſes, that there is a great extent of ſea
beyond China, which communicates with the
ſea of the Cozars, or of Muſcovia. The ſea
beyond Cape Current was entirely unknown
to the Arabians, on account of the extreme
hazard of navigating it, and becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
was inhabited by a people ſo barbarous,
that it was impoſſible either to conquer them,
or to civilize them by commerce. The Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe
found not, from the Cape of Good
Hope to Soffala, any Moors who had an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0195400701:182"/>
ſettlement, like thoſe in all the maritime
villages as far as China, which was the fartheſt
place known to geographers. But they could
not tell whether the Chineſe ſea communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with that of Barbary by the extremity
of Africa; they only deſcribed it to the coaſt
of Zinga or Caffraria. We cannot, therefore,
heſitate in pronouncing, that the firſt diſcovery
of the paſſage of this ſea, by the Cape of Good
Hope, was made by the Europeans, under the
command of Vaſco de Gama, or, at leaſt, a
few years before he doubled that Cape, if we
may credit ſome ſea charts of an older date,
where the Cape is marked under the name of
<hi>Fronteira da Africa.</hi> Antony Galvan relates,
upon the teſtimony of Franciſco de Souſa Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vares,
that, in 1528, the Infant Don Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
ſhewed him a ſimilar chart from the
monaſtery of Acoboca, dated 120 years before,
copied, perhaps, from that ſaid to be in the
treaſury of St Marc at Venice, on which the
point of Africa is likewiſe delineated, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the evidence of Ramuſio,' &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ignorance of theſe ages concerning the
navigation round Africa is not, perhaps, ſo
ſingular as the ſilence of the editor of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
relation with regard to the paſſages in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,
Pliny, &amp;c. which we have quoted, and
which prove that the antients had ſailed round
Africa.</p>

However this matter ſtands, the coaſts of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
are now well known. But all the attempts
that have been made to penetrate into the interior
parts, have not furniſhed us with exact accounts.
It would be a great object to go far up the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
by means of Senegal, or ſome other great
river, and eſtabliſh ſettlements. According to
every appearance, we ſhould there find a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
as rich in precious metals as Peru or Braſil.
It is well known, that the rivers of Africa a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in gold duſt; and, as the country is very
high and mountainous, and is, beſides, ſituated
under the equator, it admits not a doubt, that it
contains, as well as America, mines of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt
metals, and ſtones of the hardeſt and of the
moſt compact texture.</p>
               <p>The vaſt extent of north and eaſt Tartary is
but a late diſcovery. If the Ruſſian charts be
juſt, we know the whole coaſt of this part of
Aſia; and it appears, that, from the termination
of Eaſt Tartary to North America, is not above
400 or 500 leagues. It has even been lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to a much ſhorter ſpace. In the Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
Gazette of 24th January 1747, under the
article Peterſburgh, it is alledged, that M. Stalle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravoit
had diſcovered, beyond Kamtſchatka, one
of the North American iſles, and that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
that we might paſs from Ruſſia to
America by a very ſhort paſſage. The Jeſuites
and other miſſionaries alſo pretended to have
known ſavages in Tartary, whom they had ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techized
in America, which ſuppoſes the paſſage
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0195400701:188"/>
to be indeed very ſhort<note n="*" place="bottom">See Charlevoix, tom. 3. p. 30.</note>. Charlevoix would
have us believe, that the old and new continents
are united in the northern parts. He ſays, that
ſome late voyages of the Japaneſe make it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that the paſſage we have been mentioning
is only a bay, beyond which we may paſs, by
land, from Aſia to America. But this notion
requires confirmation; for it has always been
thought, that the continent of the North Pole is
probably ſeparated from all other continents, as
well as that of the South Pole.</p>
               <p>Aſtronomy and navigation have reached to ſo
high a pitch of perfection, that we may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
hope ſoon to have an exact knowledge of
the whole ſurface of the globe. The antients,
who were ignorant of the mariner's compaſs,
were able to diſcover only a ſmall part of it.
Some pretend that the Arabians invented this
inſtrument, and that, by means of it, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on trade with India as far as China<note n="†" place="bottom">See l'Abregé de l'hiſt. des Sarazins de Bergeron, p. 119.</note>. But
this notion has always appeared to me to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of foundation; for there is not in the
Arabian, Turkiſh, or Perſian languages, a word
that ſignifies a mariner's compaſs: They uſe the
Italian word <hi>boſſola.</hi> Even at this moment, they
can neither make compaſſes nor give polarity
to the needle. They purchaſe them from the
Europeans. Father Martini alledges, that the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe
have been acquainted with the compaſs theſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0195400701:189"/>
3000 years<note n="*" place="bottom">See hiſt. Sinicae, p. 106.</note>. If theſe facts be true, how ſhould
it happen that they have made ſo little uſe of it?
Why, in their voyages to Cochinchina did they
take a longer courſe than was neceſſary? Why
did they always limit themſelves to the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions,
the longeſt of which was to Java and
Sumatra? And why did they not diſcover, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Europeans, a vaſt variety of iſlands and
of fertile countries in their own neighbourhood,
if they poſſeſſed the art of navigating in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
ſeas? It was but a few years after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of this wonderful quality of the load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
that the Portugueſe doubled the Cape of
Good Hope, and traverſed the African and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
oceans, and that Chriſtopher Columbus
ſailed to America.</p>
               <p>It was not difficult to conjecture, that immenſe
regions exiſted in the weſtern part of the globe;
for, on computing what was known of it, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the diſtance from Spain to China, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the revolution of the earth, or of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
it was eaſy to perceive, that a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
lay to the weſt than what had been already
diſcovered on the eaſt. That the antients found
not the new world, was not owing to a deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in aſtronomical ſcience, but ſolely to their
ignorance of the compaſs. The paſſages of Plato
and of Ariſtotle, which mention countries far
beyond the Pillars of Hercules, ſeem to indicate
that ſome mariners had been driven by a tempeſt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0195400701:190"/>
on the coaſt of America, from which they had
returned with infinite labour. But, ſuppoſing
the antients had been thoroughly convinced that
ſuch a continent exiſted, being ignorant of the
compaſs, they could not poſſibly derive any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
from it.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge, that it is not abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for reſolute men, with no other guide
than the ſtars, to ſail in open ſeas. The antients
were in poſſeſſion of the Aſtrolabe. They might
take their departure from France or Spain, and
ſail to the weſt by always keeping the polar ſtar
on the right hand; and, by frequent ſoundings,
they might keep nearly in the ſame latitude. It
was unqueſtionably by keeping the pole-ſtar on
their left, that the Carthaginians mentioned by
Ariſtotle were enabled to return from theſe diſtant
regions. But it will ſtill be allowed, that ſuch
a voyage muſt have been regarded as a raſh and
hazardous enterpriſe. We ought not, therefore,
to be ſurpriſed, that the antients never conceived
ſuch a project.</p>
               <p>Before the expedition of Columbus, the
Azores, the Canaries, and Madeira, had been
diſcovered. It had been remarked, that, when
the weſt winds continued long to blow, the ſea
threw upon the coaſts of theſe iſlands pieces of
ſtrange wood, canes of an unknown ſpecies, and
even dead bodies, which, by ſeveral marks, were
known to be neither Europeans nor Africans<note n="*" place="bottom">See Charlevoix, tom. 1. p. 66.</note>.</p>

                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0195400701:191"/>
Columbus himſelf remarked, that, on the weſt
coaſts, certain winds blew for ſome days, which
he was perſuaded proceeded from land. But,
though he had all theſe advantages over the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
and likewiſe the compaſs, the difficulties
to be encountered were ſo great, that nothing
leſs than ſucceſs could have juſtified the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.
Suppoſe, for a moment, that the
continent of America had been 1000 or 1500
leagues more diſtant, a circumſtance which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus
could neither foreſee nor prevent, he
never would have arrived, and perhaps this vaſt
country might ſtill have remained undiſcovered.
This conjecture receives additional force, when
it is conſidered, that Columbus, though the ableſt
navigator of his age, was ſeized with terror and
aſtoniſhment in his ſecond voyage to the New
World: As, in his firſt voyage, he found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but iſlands, he directed his courſe more to
the ſouth in queſt of a continent; but found
himſelf ſtopped by currents, the great extent of
which, and their uniform oppoſition to his courſe,
obliged him to direct his ſearch more to the weſt.
He imagined, that it was not currents which
prevented him from advancing to the ſouth, but
that the ſea was riſing to the heavens, and that
both perhaps touched each other in the ſouthern
parts: Thus, in great undertakings, the moſt
trifling difficulty may ſometimes turn a man's
brain, and extinguiſh his courage.</p>

               <head>PROOFS
OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</head>
               <head>ARTICLE VII.</head>
               <head>Of the Formation of Strata, or Beds in the Earth.</head>
               <p>WE have demonſtrated, in the firſt article,
that the earth, in conſequence of the
mutual attraction between the particles of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and of the centrifugal force which reſults
from its diurnal revolution, behoved to aſſume
the figure of a ſpheroid, the two diameters of
which differ about a 230th part; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the changes made on its ſurface by the
motions of the air and of the waters, could aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
this difference, in the manner alledged by
thoſe who meaſured a degree under the equator,
and another within the polar circle. This fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the earth, which agrees ſo well with the
laws of hydroſtatics and with our theory, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0195400701:193"/>
that, at the time it aſſumed its figure, it
was in a ſtate of fluidity. We have alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that the projectile motion, and the motion
of rotation, were impreſſed at the ſame time, and
by the ſame impulſe. It will the more readily
be admitted, that the earth was originally in a
ſtate of liquefaction, when it is conſidered, that
the greateſt part of the materials of which this
globe is compoſed, are either vitrifications, or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifiable
by fire. The impoſſibility of rendering
the earth fluid by the operation of waters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
this hypotheſis; becauſe there is infinitely
more earth than water; and the water is not
able to diſſolve ſand, rocks, and hard minerals.</p>
               <p>It is, therefore, evident, that the earth aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
its figure when in a melted ſtate: And, to
purſue our theory, it is natural to think, that
the earth, when it iſſued from the ſun, had no
other form but that of a torrent of melted and
inflamed matter; that this torrent, by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
attraction of its parts, took on a globular
figure, which its diurnal motion changed into a
ſpheroid; that, when the earth cooled, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
which are expanded like the tail of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
gradually condenſed, fell down in the form
of water upon the ſurface, depoſiting, at the
ſame time, a ſlimy ſubſtance, mixed with ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
and ſalts, part of which was carried, by
the motion of the waters, into the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
fiſſures of the ſtrata, and produced metals;
and the reſt remained on the ſurface, and gave
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0195400701:194"/>
riſe to the vegetable mould, which abounds, in
different places, with more or leſs of animal and
vegetable particles, the organization of which is
not obvious to the ſenſes.</p>
               <p>Thus the interior parts of the globe were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
compoſed of vitrified matter; and, I
believe, they continue ſo at preſent. Above this
vitrified matter, were placed thoſe bodies which
the fire had reduced into the ſmalleſt particles,
as ſands, which are only portions of glaſs; and,
above theſe, pumice ſtones, and the ſcoriae of
melted matter, which produced the different
clays. The whole was covered with water to
to the depth of 5 or 600 feet<note n="*" place="bottom">This opinion, that the earth was entirely covered with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, correſponds with the ſentiments of ſeveral antient philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and likewiſe with thoſe of many of the fathers of the church. In mundi primordio, aqua in omnem terram ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, ſays St John of Damaſcus, lib. 2. cap. 9. Terra erat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibilis, quia exundabat aqua et operiebat terram; St Ambroſe, lib. 1. cap. 8. Submerſa tellus cum eſſet, faciem ejus inundante aqua, non erat adſpectabilis; St Baſile, Hom. 2. See likewiſe St Auguſtine, lib. 1. cap. 12.</note>, which origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the condenſation of the vapours, when
the earth began to cool. This water depoſited
a ſtratum of mud, mixed with all thoſe matters
which are capable of being ſublimed or exhaled
by fire; and the air was formed of the moſt
ſubtile vapours, which, from their levity, roſe
above the water.</p>
               <p>Such was the condition of the earth, when
the tides, the winds, and the heat of the ſun,
began to introduce changes on its ſurface. The
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0195400701:195"/>
diurnal motion of the earth, and that of the
tides, elevated the waters in the equatorial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
and neceſſarily tranſported thither great
quantities of ſlime, clay, and ſand, and by thus
elevating theſe parts of the earth, they perhaps
ſank thoſe under the poles about two leagues,
as was formerly remarked: For the waters
would eaſily reduce into powder pumice-ſtones,
and other ſpungy parts of the vitrified matter
upon the ſurface, and, by this means, excavate
ſome places, and elevate others, which, in time,
would produce iſlands and continents, and all
thoſe inequalities on the ſurface, which are more
conſiderable towards the equator than the poles.
The higheſt mountains lie between the Tropics
and the middle of the Temperate Zones, and the
loweſt from the polar circles towards the poles.
Between the Tropics are the Cordeliers, moſt of
the mountains of Mexico and the Braſils, the
great and leſſer Atlas, the mountains of the
Moon, &amp;c. Beſides, both the land and the ſea
have moſt inequalities between the tropics, as is
evident from the incredible number of iſlands
peculiar to thoſe regions.</p>
               <p>However independent this hypotheſis, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the original ſtate of the globe, may be
of my general theory, I have choſen to refer to
it in this article, to ſhow the connection and
poſſibility of the ſyſtem endeavoured to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in the firſt article. It may only be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,
that my theory is not oppoſed by the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0195400701:196"/>
facts; that I take the earth nearly as it ſtands
at preſent; and that I lay hold of none of thoſe
ſuppoſitions which are often uſed in reaſoning
concerning the former condition of this globe.
But, as I here offer a new idea upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the ſediment depoſited by the waters,
which, in my opinion, gave riſe to the upper
ſtratum of the earth, it will not be improper to
exhibit the reaſons upon which it is founded.</p>
               <p>The vapours exhaled from the earth produce
rain, dews, thunder, lightening, and other mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.
Theſe vapours, therefore, are mixed with
particles of water, air, ſulphur, earth, &amp;c.; and
it is the ſolid earthy particles which conſtitute
the ſlime or mud under conſideration. The
pureſt rain-water depoſites a quantity of this
mud; and, when a quantity of dew is collected,
and allowed to corrupt, it produces a greater
proportional quantity of mud, which is fat,
unctuous, and of a reddiſh colour.</p>
               <p>The upper ſtratum of the earth is compoſed
of this mud, mixed with particles of animal and
vegetable ſubſtances, or rather with particles of
ſtone and ſand. It may be remarked, that moſt
arable land is reddiſh, and more or leſs blended
with heterogeneous matters. The particles of
ſtone or of ſand found in it are of two kinds;
the one is groſs and heavy, the other fine, and
ſometimes impalpable. The groſs is detached
from the inferior ſtratum by labouring the
ground; or rather, the upper ſtratum, by pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0195400701:197"/>
the inferior, which is compoſed of ſand
or gravel, forms what is called <hi>fat,</hi> or <hi>fertile
ſand.</hi> The finer ſpecies proceeds from the air,
falls down with the dew or rain, and intimately
incorporates with the vegetable mould, or upper
ſtratum. This laſt is nothing more than the
duſt, tranſported by the air, and again depoſited
during a moiſt atmoſphere. When the quantity
of this mud is great, in proportion to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of ſtone or ſand, the ſoil is red and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile;
if it be conſiderably mixed with animal
and vegetable ſubſtances, it is blackiſh; but, if
the quantity of mud, and of vegetable and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
ſubſtances be ſmall, the ſoil is white and
barren; and, even when the particles of ſand,
ſtone, or chalk, which compoſe theſe barren
ſoils, are mixed with a conſiderable quantity of
animal and vegetable ſubſtances, they become
black and light, but have very little fertility.
According, therefore, to the different proportions
of theſe three ingredients, ſoils are more or leſs
fertile, and differently coloured.</p>
               <p>In order to acquire diſtinct ideas concerning
the ſtrata of the earth, we ſhall take for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
the pits at Marly-la-Ville, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
deep. It is ſituated in a high, but
flat and fertile country, and its ſtrata lie hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontally.
I procured ſpecimens of all theſe ſtrata
in their order from M. Dalibard, an eminent
botaniſt, and a man of ſcience; and, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
proved the matters they reſpectively conſiſt

               <p>I mentioned above, that I had examined all
theſe ſubſtances with aqua fortis, becauſe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
teſt can enable us to make real diſtinctions
between earthy bodies of the ſame or of different
appearances. Thoſe which efferveſce and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
diſſolve on the application of the aqua
fortis, are generally calcinable. Thoſe, on the
other hand, upon which that acid makes no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
are vitrifiable.</p>
               <p>From the above enumeration of ſtrata it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that that the land at Marly-la-ville was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
covered with the ſea, to the depth of 75
feet, ſince ſhells are found 75 feet below the
ſurface. Thoſe ſhells have been collected and
depoſited by the water, along with the ſand
which contains them; and the whole ſuperior
ſtrata, excepting the uppermoſt, have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
thither by the motion of the waters, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0195400701:201"/>
depoſited in the form of ſediment, as is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from their horizontal poſition, from the
mixture of ſand, ſhells, and marle, which laſt is
compoſed of decayed ſhells; and even the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſtratum has been almoſt wholly formed of
ſlime or mud, with a ſmall mixture of marle.</p>
               <p>I have choſen this example, becauſe it is leaſt
favourable to my theory; for it appears, at firſt
view, difficult to conceive how the mud depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
by the dew and rains ſhould produce a
bed of vegetable ſoil 13 feet thick. But it
ought to be remarked, that a ſoil of this thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is rarely to be found, eſpecially in high
countries. The general run of ſoils are from
three to four feet, and often they exceed not
one foot. The ſoil is thickeſt in plains ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with hills; becauſe the rains daily bring
freſh ſupplies from the higher grounds. But,
abſtracting from this ſuppoſition, it is plain, that
the upper ſtrata formed by the ſea, are thick
beds of marle. It is natural to think, that the
upper ſtratum, above mentioned, was originally
much thicker, and that, beſides the 13 feet, the
ſea would leave a conſiderable quantity of marle.
But this marle, being expoſed to the action of
the air, of rains, and of the rays of the ſun,
would ſoon be reduced into a fine powder. The
ſea would not leave this land ſuddenly, but
would continue for ſom time occaſionally to
cover it, either by the motion of the tides, or
by extraordinary ſwells during great ſtorms; and,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0195400701:202"/>
of courſe, the upper ſtratum would be mixed
with mud, clay, and other ſlimy bodies. After
being entirely above the reach of the waves,
plants would begin to grow, and the ſoil would
conſtantly accumulate, and be tinged with a
reddiſh colour, by the mud depoſited from dews
and rain. Culture would ſtill farther increaſe
both its fertility and its thickneſs, and, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the dews and rains to penetrate deeper,
would in the end produce this ſoil of 13 feet.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here examine, whether the reddiſh
colour of vegetable mould proceeds from a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of iron contained in the mud depoſited by
rain and dews. This point, which is of ſome
importance, ſhall be diſcuſſed when we come to
treat of minerals. It is ſufficient to have given
a view of the manner in which the upper ſtratum
has been formed: We ſhall now prove, by other
examples, that the formation of the interior ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
of the earth muſt likewiſe have originated
from the operation of the waters.</p>
               <p>The upper ſtratum of the globe, ſays Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that magazine for the formation and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of animals and vegetables, is moſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of vegetable and animal matter, and is in
perpetual fluctuation. All the animals and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables
which have exiſted ſince the creation,
have ſucceſſively extracted from this ſtratum the
materials of which their bodies are conſtructed;
theſe they again reſtore at their diſſolution, where
they remain prepared for the ſucceſſive forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0195400701:203"/>
of new bodies of the ſame ſpecies; the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which forms one body being naturally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to make another of the ſame kind<note n="*" place="bottom">See Woodward's Eſſay, p. 136.</note>. In
uninhabited countries, where the woods are
never cut, nor the herbs brouzed by cattle, the
ſoil is conſtantly augmenting. The ſoil, in all
woods, even in thoſe which are occaſionally cut,
is from 6 to 8 feet thick, and has originated
from decayed leaves, and other parts of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables.
I have often remarked, upon an old
Roman way which runs acroſs Burgundy, that
the ſtones with which it was conſtructed are
covered with a black mould of more than a foot
thick, and nouriſhes trees of a conſiderable ſize.
This ſoil could only be produced by the gradual
and ſucceſſive deſtruction of vegetable bodies.
As vegetables derive more of their ſubſtance
from the air and from water, than from the earth,
when they decay, they add more to the earth
than they extracted from it. Beſides, foreſts
collect and retain vapours and moiſure; and,
of courſe, in old woods, the ſoil is greatly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.
But, as animals reſtore much leſs to
the earth than they take from it; and, as men
conſume vaſt quantities of wood and herbs, for
feuel and other purpoſes, it follows, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable
ſoil of populous countries muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
diminiſh, and become, in time, like that
of Arabia Petrea, and other eaſtern countries,
which were firſt inhabited, where nothing is to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0195400701:204"/>
be found but ſand and ſalts; for the fixed ſalts
of plants and of animals remain, while all the
other parts volatilize, and are carried off by the
air.</p>
               <p>Let us next examine the poſition and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the interior ſtrata. The earth, ſays
Woodward, wherever it has been dug, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of beds or ſtrata, one above another, in
the ſame manner as if they had proceeded from
ſucceſſive ſediments depoſited by water. The
beds that lie deepeſt are thicker than thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
above them, and they grow gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thinner till they arive at the ſurface. Sea-ſhells,
teeth, and bones of fiſhes, are found in
theſe beds, and not only in thoſe which are ſoft,
as chalk, clay, and marle, but even in beds of
hard ſtone, marble, &amp;c. Theſe productions of
the ſea are incorporated with the ſtone, and,
when ſeparated, leave in the ſtone the figure of
their ſurface exactly delineated. 'I was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
aſſured,' ſays this author, 'that the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of theſe things in remoter coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
were much the ſame with thoſe of ours
here: That the ſtone, and other terreſtrial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in France, Flanders, Holland, Spain, Italy,
Germany, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden,
was diſtinguiſhed into ſtrata, or layers, as it is
in England: That thoſe ſtrata were divided by
parallel fiſſures: That there were incloſed in
the ſtone, and all the other denſer kinds of
terreſtrial matter, great numbers of ſhells, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0195400701:205"/>
other productions of the ſea; in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as in that of this iſland. To be ſhort, by
the ſame means I got ſufficient intelligence that
theſe things were found in like manner in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,
in Egypt, in Guiney, and other parts of
Africa: In Arabia, Syria, Perſia, Malabar,
China, and other Aſiatick provinces: In Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,
Barbadoes, Virginia, New England,
Braſil, Peru, and other parts of America.,
p. 6. 41. 42. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Woodward gives no authority for his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that ſhells are found in the ſtrata of Peru.
But as, in general, his facts are true, I doubt not
but his information has been good; and I am
perſuaded that ſhells exiſt in the ſtrata of Peru,
as well as every where elſe. I make this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
on account of a doubt which has been
entertained on this ſubject, and which ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
be conſidered.</p>
               <p>In digging a well at Amſterdam, 232 feet
deep, the ſtrata were arranged in the following
order: 7 feet of vegetable ſoil; 9 feet of turf;
9 feet of ſoft clay; 8 feet of ſand; 4 of earth;
10 of clay; 4 of earth; 10 of ſand; 2 of clay;
4 of ſmall white ſand; 5 of dry earth; 1 of ſoft
earth; 14 of ſand; 8 of clay mixed with ſand;
4 of ſand mixed with ſhells; then 102 feet of
clay; and, <hi>laſtly,</hi> 31 feet of ſand<note n="*" place="bottom">See Varenii Geograph. gen. p. 46.</note>.</p>
               <p>It is uncommon to dig ſo deep before we find
water: But this experiment is remarkable in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0195400701:206"/>
many other reſpects. 1<hi>ſt,</hi> It demonſtrates that
the ſea communicates not with the interior parts
of the earth by means of filtration: 2<hi>d,</hi> That
ſhells are found 100 feet below the ſurface in a
country extremely low; and, conſequently, that
the land of Holland has been elevated 100 feet
by the ſediments of the ocean: 3<hi>d,</hi> It may be
concluded, that the bed of clay of 102 feet, and
the bed of ſand, 31 feet of which only had been
dug, and whoſe actual thickneſs is unknown, lie
near to the antient and original earth, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted
before the motion of the waters began to
change its ſurface. In the firſt article, it was
remarked, that, in order to diſcover the antient
earth, we muſt dig in the northern, rather than
in the ſouthern regions; and in the low and
plain, rather than in the elevated countries.
Theſe circumſtances nearly concurred in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
caſe. We only wiſh that the pit had been
dug deeper, and that the author had informed
us, whether ſhells, or other ſea-bodies, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed
with the laſt ſtrata of clay and of ſand.
This experiment confirms what was above ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
that the ſtrata are always thicker in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to their depth.</p>
               <p>The earth conſiſts of parallel and horizontal
ſtrata, not in the plains only, but, in general, the
hills and mountains have the ſame ſtructure.
The ſtrata of the mountains are even more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
than thoſe of the plains; for the plains
are commonly covered with great quantities of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0195400701:207"/>
ſand and earth brought from the higher grounds
by the waters; and, therefore, to find the antient
ſtrata, we muſt dig deeper in the plains than in
the mountains.</p>
               <p>I have often remarked, that, when the top of
a mountain is level, its ſtrata are likewiſe level;
but, when the top is not horizontal, the ſtrata
follow the direction of its declivity. It has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
been alledged, that the beds of quarries
incline to the eaſt. But in all the chains of
rocks which I have examined, I found, that
theſe beds always follow the declivity of the
hill, whether its direction be eaſt, weſt, ſouth, or
north. In raiſing ſtones from the quarry, they
are always ſeparated according to their natural
poſition; and, if cut in a contrary direction, it is
impoſſible to raiſe them of any conſiderable ſize.
In all good maſonry, the workmen place the
ſtones in the direction in which they lay in the
quarry. If laid in an oppoſite poſition, they will
ſpilt, and not be able to reſiſt the weight of the
incumbent building. Hence we may conclude,
that ſtones have been originally formed in hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal
beds; that theſe beds have been ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accumulated above each other, and have been
compoſed of materials, the reſiſtance of which is
ſtronger in that than in any other direction.</p>
               <p>Every ſtratum, of whatever kind, whether it
be horizontal or inclined, is of an equal thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
through its whole extent. In the quarries
round Paris, the ſtratum of good ſtone is but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0195400701:208"/>
18 or 20 inches thick throughout. In the
quarries of Burgundy, the ſtone is much thicker.
The ſame inequalities take place in marbles.
The white and black marbles are thicker than
thoſe that are coloured; and there is a hard ſtone
with which the people of Burgundy cover their
houſes, that exceeds not an inch in thickneſs.
Thus, different ſtrata differ much with regard to
thickneſs; but each ſtratum uniformly preſerves
the ſame thickneſs through its whole extent.
This difference is ſo great, that ſtrata are to be
found, from leſs than a line, to 1, 10, 20, 30,
and 100 feet thick. Both antient and modern
quarries, which are dug horizontally, the ſhafts
of mines, and the working of lead, both longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinally
and tranſverſely, prove that ſtrata ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a great way on all ſides. 'It is well known,'
as the hiſtorian of the academy obſerves, 'that all
ſtones have originally been a ſoft paſte, and
that, as ſtones are almoſt every where to be
met with, the ſurface of the earth, in all theſe
places, at leaſt to a certain depth, muſt have
conſiſted of mud and ſlime. The ſhells found
in moſt quarries demonſtrate, that this mud
was an earth diluted by the water of the ſea;
and, conſequently, that the ſea once covered
all theſe places; but the ſea could not cover
them, without, at the ſame time, covering all
places that were lower, or on the ſame level.
Now, it is impoſſible that the ſea could cover
all thoſe places where there are quarries, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0195400701:209"/>
covering the whole ſurface of the globe.
If the mountains were then formed, the ſea
muſt alſo have covered them; for they are full
of rocks and quarries, and ſhells are often
found in them.'</p>
               <p>'The ſea, then,' continues he, 'covered the
whole earth; and hence all the beds of ſtone
in the plains are horizontal and parallel: The
fiſhes, therefore, were the moſt antient inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the globe; for neither land-animals
nor birds could exiſt. But how has the ſea
retired into thoſe vaſt baſons which it now oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupies?
The moſt natural ſuppoſition is, that
the earth, at leaſt to a certain depth, was not
all equally ſolid, but interſperſed with vaſt
vaults or caverns, the arches of which would
remain for a time, and at laſt ſuddenly fall in.
The waters would then ruſh into theſe hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
fill them up, and leave a part of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
dry, which would become a convenient
habitation for land-animals and birds. The
ſhells found in quarries ſtrongly confirm this
idea; for nothing but the bony parts of fiſhes
could be preſerved ſo long in the earth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
ſhells commonly lie in vaſt maſſes in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
parts of the ſea, where they remain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable,
and form a ſpecies of rocks or banks;
they could not, therefore, follow the ſea, which
ſuddenly abandoned them. For this laſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
it is, that we find ſuch numbers of foſſil-ſhells,
and ſo few veſtiges of other fiſhes, which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0195400701:210"/>
is a farther proof that the waters retired with
rapidity into their preſent baſons. When the
vaults ſunk down, it is very probable that
mountains were elevated by the ſame cauſe,
and placed upon the ſurface with rocks and
quarries already formed. But the beds of theſe
quarries could not preſerve their original ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal
poſition, unleſs they were raiſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
perpendicular to the ſurface, which would
rarely happen. Thus, as we formerly remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mem. de l'Acad. ann. 1705, p. 30.</note>,
the beds of ſtone in mountains are all
inclined to the horizon, though they be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
to each other; for they changed not their
poſition with regard to one another, but with
regard only to the ſurface of the earth<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. ann. 1716, p. 14.</note>.'</p>
               <p>Theſe parallel beds of earth or of ſtone, which
have been formed by ſediments of the ocean,
often extend to conſiderable diſtances; we even
find, in hills ſeparated by vallies, beds of the
ſame materials upon equal levels. This obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
has a perfect correſpondence with the
equal altitudes of oppoſite hills. The truth of
this fact may be eaſily eſtabliſhed; for, in all
hills ſeparated by narrow vallies, where ſtone
or marble is found on one hill, we uniformly
find theſe very ſubſtances, at the ſame level, on
the oppoſite hill. I have traced a quarry of
marble 12 leagues in length; its breadth is alſo
conſiderable, though I have not been able exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to aſcertain it. I have often obſerved, that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0195400701:211"/>
this bed of marble has every where the ſame
thickneſs; and that, in hills ſeparated by a val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of 100 feet deep, the ſame bed always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
at the ſame altitude. I am firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded,
that this obſervation holds with regard
to all quarries of ſtone or of marble that contain
ſhells; but it applies not to beds of free-ſtone.
We ſhall afterwards explain why free-ſtone is
not diſperſed, like other matters, in horizontal
beds, but in blocks, irregular both in form and
poſition.</p>
               <p>It has likewiſe been remarked, that, on the
oppoſite ſides of ſtraits of the ſea, the ſtrata are
the ſame. This obſervation is important, and
may lead to the diſcovery of thoſe necks of land,
or iſlands, that have been ſeparated from the
Continent. It proves, for example, that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
has been ſeparated from France, Spain from
Africa, and Sicily from Italy: And it is to be
regretted, that the ſame obſervation has not been
made upon all ſtraits. I have no doubt but it
will hold univerſally. We know not, whether,
in the ſtraits of Magellan, the longeſt we are
acquainted with, the ſame ſtrata are to be found
at the ſame altitude; but we perceive, from very
exact charts, that the oppoſite coaſts, which are
high, have correſponding angles like thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
in our inland mountains; and this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proves Terra del Fuego to have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
a part of the Continent of America. The
ſame remark has been made with regard to the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0195400701:212"/>
ſtrait of Forbiſher; and the iſland of Frieſland
appears to have been ſeparated from the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
of Greenland.</p>
               <p>The Maldiva iſlands are ſeparated from each
other by ſmall branches of the ſea; and on each
ſide of the oppoſite iſlands, the ſtrata of rocks,
&amp;c. are the ſame. Theſe iſlands, which, when
taken together, extend about 200 leagues in
length, were formerly one. They are divided
into 13 provinces, called <hi>Cluſters.</hi> Every Cluſter
contains a great number of ſmall iſlands, moſt
of which will ſoon be under water. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that each of theſe 13 Cluſters is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with a chain of rocks of the ſame ſtone,
and that there are only three or four ſmall and
dangerous openings through which each of them
can be approached. They are all placed in a
line, with their ends to each other, and appear
evidently to have been once a long mountain
crowned with rock<note n="*" place="bottom">See Voyag. de Franc. Pyrard, vol. 1. p. 107.</note>.</p>
               <p>Several authors, as Verſtegan, Twine, Sommer,
but particularly Campbell, in his deſcription of
the county of Kent, give ſtriking proofs that
England was formerly joined to France, and that
the neck of land which divides them had been
carried off by the ſea, which retired, and left a
great quantity of low marſhy ground along the
ſouthern coaſts of England. As a farther proof
of this fact, Dr Wallis has attempted to ſhow an
affinity between the antient language of the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0195400701:213"/>
Gauls and of the Britains; and he adds ſeveral
other remarks which ſhall be related in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
articles.</p>
               <p>If travellers obſerved the figure of lands, the
poſition of mountains, and the windings of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
they would perceive that oppoſite hills are
not only compoſed of the ſame materials, at the
ſame altitudes, but that they are alſo nearly of
an equal height. In all the places where I have
travelled, I uniformly remarked this equality in
the height of oppoſite hills, eſpecially when they
are ſeparated by valleys not above a fourth or a
third of a league wide. In valleys of greater
width, it is difficult to judge of the height or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
of hills; for, on looking over a level
and extenſive plain, it appears to riſe; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
hills appear to ſink. But this is not the
place to account for theſe phaenomena. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
it is not eaſy to determine, by the eye, the
middle of a large valley, unleſs there be a river
in it. But, in narrow valleys, the judgment of
the eye is more certain. That part of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
comprehended between Auxerre, Dijon, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun,
and Bar-ſur-ſeine, and of which a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
portion is called <hi>le Bailliage de la
Montagne,</hi> is one of the moſt elevated parts of
France. From one ſide of theſe mountains,
which are only of the ſecond order, the water
runs to the ocean, and, from the other, to the
Mediterranean. There are points of partition,
as at Sombernon, Pouilli in Auxois, &amp;c. where
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0195400701:214"/>
the water may be turned at pleaſure, either to
the ocean or to the Mediterranean. This high
country is interſected with a number of ſmall
valleys, and moſt of them are watered with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets.
Here I have a thouſand times obſerved
the correſponding angles of the hills, and their
equality as to height; and I can with confidence
affirm, that the ſaliant or prominent angles are
uniformly oppoſed to the concave ones, and that
the heights of the two ſides are nearly the ſame.
The farther we advance in this high country,
where are the points of partition mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
the mountains are the higher. But this
height is always the ſame on the oppoſite ſides
of the valleys, and the hills riſe or fall equally.
The ſame obſervation I have repeatedly made in
ſeveral other provinces of France; but they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not to very high mountains; for theſe are
more irregular as to height, and often terminate
in unequal points or peaks. In frequently tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
the Alps and Appennines, I obſerved,
that the angles, in effect, correſponded; but that
it is almoſt impoſſible to judge, by the eye, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the equality or inequality in the heights
of oppoſite mountains; becauſe their tops are
loſt in the clouds.</p>
               <p>The different ſtrata compoſing the earth are
not arranged according to their ſpecific gravities.
Beds of heavy matter are frequently placed
above thoſe of lighter. Solid rocks are often
ſupported by beds of earth, clay, or ſand, which
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0195400701:215"/>
have much leſs ſpecific gravity. This is the caſe
with moſt hills, and is eaſily perceived. But, in
high mountains, the ſummits are not only rocks,
but theſe rocks are ſupported by others; and
this ſtructure runs through ſuch an extent of
country, where one mountain riſes out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that it is difficult to determine whether
they are founded on earth, or of what nature
this earth is. I have ſeen rocks cut perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
for ſome hundreds of feet; but theſe
rocks reſted upon other rocks, without my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to perceive where they ended. May
we not, however, be allowed to conclude from
the leſs to the greater? Since the rocks of ſmall
mountains, the baſes of which are viſible, reſt
upon earths leſs heavy and leſs ſolid than ſtone,
is it not reaſonable to think, that earth is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the baſis of high mountains? Beſides, all I
have here advanced tends to prove, that heavy
bodies might be accumulated, by the motion of
the waters, above light ones; and, if this really
takes place in moſt hills, it is probable that it has
happened in the manner pointed out by my
theory. But, ſhould it be objected, that I had
no reaſon to ſuppoſe, that, prior to the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mountains, the heavier matter was below
the lighter; I anſwer, that I affirm nothing with
regard to this article; becauſe there are many
ways by which this effect might be produced,
whether the heavy matter was above or below,
or placed indiſcriminately: For, in order to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0195400701:216"/>
conceive how the ſea could firſt form a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of clay, and then crown it with rocks, we
have only to conſider, that the ſediments might
be tranſported from different places, and that
they might conſiſt of different materials. The
ſea might tranſport from one place ſeveral ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of clay, and afterwards depoſite ſediments
of ſtony matter; either becauſe all the clay at
the bottom, or on the coaſts, was exhauſted,
and then the waves would attack the rocks; or,
rather, becauſe the firſt ſediments were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
from one place, and the laſt from a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
one. Beſides, the latter correſponds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
with experience; for, it is a known fact,
that beds of earth, ſtone, gravel, ſand, &amp;c. fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
no rule of arrangement, but are placed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently,
and, as it were, by chance, one above
another.</p>
               <p>This chance, however, ought to have ſome
rules, which can only be diſcovered by analogy
and probable conjecture. We have ſeen, that,
according to my theory of the formation of the
globe, that its interior parts ſhould conſiſt of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified
matter, ſimilar to vitrified ſand, which is
only the fragments of glaſs, and of which the
clays are only the ſcoriae, or decompoſed parts.
Agreeable to this ſuppoſition, the centre of the
earth, and even near to the ſurface itſelf, ſhould
be compoſed of glaſs or vitrified matter, and
above this ſhould be found ſand, clay, and other
ſcoriae. Thus the earth, in its original ſtate,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0195400701:217"/>
was a nucleus of glaſs, or of vitrified matter,
either compact like glaſs, or divided like ſand,
(for that circumſtance depends on the degree of
heat applied); above this matter was ſand; and,
laſtly, clay. The ſoil, or external covering,
was produced from the air and the mud of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and it is more or leſs thick according to the
ſituation of the ground; more or leſs coloured,
according to the different mixtures of mud,
ſand, clay, and the parts of decayed animals and
vegetables; and more or leſs fertile, according to
the abundance or deficiency of theſe parts. To
ſhow that this account of the formation of ſand
and clay is not altogether imaginary, I ſhall add
a few remarks.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe the earth, in its firſt ſtate, to have
been a ſpheroid of compact glaſs, covered with
a thin cruſt of pumice-ſtone, and other ſcoriae
of melted matter. The agitation of the air and
of the water would ſoon reduce this cruſt of
pumice into powder or ſand, which, by uniting
into maſſes, would give riſe to free-ſtone and
flints, the varieties of which, with regard to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and denſity, depend upon the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of fineneſs of the ſand that compoſed
them.</p>
               <p>The conſtituent parts of ſand unite by the
application of fire, become very hard, compact,
and more or leſs tranſparent according to the
purity of the ſand: But, on the other hand,
when expoſed to the action of the air, it exfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liates,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0195400701:218"/>
falls down in the form of earth, and may
thus produce clays of different kinds. This duſt,
which is ſometimes yellow, ſometimes brilliant,
and is uſed to dry writings, is nothing elſe than
a fine ſand, ſomewhat corrupted, and nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to an elementary ſtate. In time, its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
become ſo attenuated and divided, that
they loſe the power of reflecting light, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
all the properties of clay. On examining
a piece of clay, many of theſe ſhining or talky
particles appear, they not having yet entirely
loſt their original form. Sand, therefore, in
proceſs of time, may produce clay; and this clay,
by a farther diviſion, acquires the qualities of a
mud or ſlime, a vitrifiable matter of the ſame
nature with clay.</p>
               <p>This theory is confirmed by daily experience.
In waſhing ſand, the water becomes impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
with a black, ſoft, fatty earth, which is
a genuine clay. The mud ſwept from ſtreets
paved with free-ſtone is black and very fat,
and, when dried, it diſcovers itſelf to be an
earth of the ſame nature with clay. Clay, taken
from places where there is neither flint nor
free-ſtone, and diluted with water, always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates
a great quantity of vitrifiable ſand.</p>
               <p>But, what clearly demonſtrates the exiſtence
of ſand, and even of flint and galſs in clay, is,
that the reunion of its parts, by the action of
fire, reſtores it to its original form. Clay, when
heated to the degree of calcination, is covered with
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0195400701:219"/>
a hard coat of enamel; if its internal parts are
not vitrified, they become ſo extremely hard, as
to reſiſt the file; they ſtrike fire with the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and acquire all the properties of flint: A
great degree of heat melts and converts them
into real glaſs.</p>
               <p>Clay and ſand, therefore, are ſubſtances per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
analogous, and of the ſame kind. If clay
can be condenſed to flint, and even to glaſs, why
may not ſand, by reſolution, become clay?
Glaſs appears to be the true elementary earth,
and all mixed bodies are only glaſs in diſguiſe.
Metals, minerals, ſalts, &amp;c. are only a vitrifiable
earth: Common ſtone, and other analogous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
teſtaceous and cruſtaceous ſhells, &amp;c. are
the only ſubſtances which cannot be vitrified,
and which ſeem to form a diſtinct claſs. The
former, by the action of fire, may be converted
into a homogeneous, hard, and tranſparent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
without any diminution of its weight,
and upon which no farther change can be made.
The latter, on the contrary, which conſiſt of
more active and volatile principles, calcine in
the fire, loſe more than a third of their weight,
and reſume the form of ſimple earth, without
any other change than the diſſolution of their
conſtituent parts. If theſe bodies be excepted,
which are few in number, and of which the
combinations produce few varieties in nature,
all other ſubſtances, and particularly clay, may
be converted into glaſs, and, conſequently, are
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0195400701:220"/>
only glaſs in a decompoſed ſtate. If the fire
quickly vitrifies theſe ſubſtances, glaſs itſelf,
whether ſimple, or in the form of ſand or flint,
naturally, but by a ſlow and inſenſible progreſs,
reſolves into clay.</p>
               <p>In countries where flint is the predominant
ſtone, the fields are commonly ſtrewed with
fragments of it: And, if the place be unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated,
and if the flints have remained long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the air, without being moved, their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſurface is always white; but the ſurface next
the ground preſerves its natural colour, which is
very brown. When theſe flints are broken, the
whiteneſs appears to be not ſuperficial only, but
penetrates more or leſs into their internal parts,
and forms a belt, which in ſome is not very
deep, but, in others, occupies nearly the whole
ſtone. This white part is ſomewhat granulated,
perfectly opaque, as tender as free-ſtone, and
adheres to the tongue like the boles. But the
other portion of the flint is ſmooth and poliſhed,
has neither thread nor grain, and preſerves its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
colour, its tranſparancy, and its hardneſs.
When this half decompoſed flint is put into a
furnace, the white part becomes red like a brick,
and the brown part becomes exceedingly white.
Why ſhall we conclude, with a famous natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt,
that flints of this kind are imperfect, and
that they are not old enough to have acquired
their perfect ſtate? For why ſhould they be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
imperfect? And why ſhould they be uniformly
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0195400701:221"/>
imperfect on the ſide only that is expoſed to the
air? It is, on the contrary, much more probable,
that they are changed from their original ſtate,
and partly decompoſed, and that they are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
reſolving into clay or bole. If this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
ſhould appear to be unſatisfactory, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to the air the hardeſt and blackeſt flint, in
leſs than a year the colour of its ſurface will be
changed; and, if the experiment be farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted,
the flint will be found gradually to loſe
its hardneſs, its tranſparency, and its other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific
characters, and make daily approaches to
the nature of clay.</p>
               <p>Sand undergoes the ſame changes as flint.
Every grain of ſand may, perhaps, be conſidered
as a ſmall flint, and every piece of flint as a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of fine ſand cemented together. The
firſt example of the decompoſition of ſand is
exhibited in that ſhining, but opaque powder,
called <hi>mica,</hi> with which clay and ſlate are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
impregnated. The quartz, or perfectly
tranſparent flints, in decompoſing, produce fat
and ſoft talks, ſuch as thoſe of Venice and Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,
which are as ductile and vitrifiable as clay;
and, it appears, that talk is the mean between
glaſs, or tranſparent flint, and clay; but that the
groſs and impure flints, in decompoſing, are
converted into clay without any intermediate
ſtate.</p>
               <p>Our made glaſs undergoes the ſame change;
when long expoſed to the air, it decompoſes,
and, as it were, corrupts. At firſt, it takes on a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0195400701:222"/>
number of colours, then it exfoliates, and, in
handling it, we perceive that many ſhining par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
fall off. But, when its decompoſition is
farther advanced, it bruiſes between the fingers,
and is reduced to a very white, talky, and impal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
powder. Art alſo imitates nature in the
decompoſition of glaſs and flint. 'Eſt etiam

               <p>Theſe matters ſhall be more fully conſidered
when we come to treat of metals. We ſhall
here only add, that the different ſtrata of the
globe, conſiſt either of materials which may
be conſidered as actual vitrifications, or analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous
to glaſs, and poſſeſſing its moſt eſſential
qualities; and that it is alſo evident, from the
decompoſition of glaſs and of flint, which daily
takes place, there reſults a genuine clay; we
may therefore conclude, with a high degree of
probability, that ſand and clays have originally
been the ſcoriae of burnt matter, eſpecially when
we join, to the above circumſtances, the proofs

The quantity of ſhells, and other productions
of the ſea, is, in many places, ſo prodigious, that
one could with difficulty believe that any more
of them exiſted in their natural element. It is
from this enormous quantity that no doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of the earth's having continued for a very

this circumſtance, we never ſhould have had a

thoſe of oiſters thrown from our doors. They

in banks of 100 or 200 leagues in length;
they may often be traced through whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,

the leaſt mixture of ſtone, earth, ſand, or
other foreign matter. Before this remarkable
inſtance, foſſil ſhells never appeared in ſuch
enormous quantities, nor without being mixed
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0195400701:226"/>
with other bodies. This prodigious maſs lies in
Turenne, more than 36 leagues from the ſea.
It is of great ſervice to the peaſants of that
province; they uſe the ſhells for marle in ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
their lands, which would otherwiſe be
perfectly barren.'</p>
               <p>'What the peaſants dig out of the earth, to
the depth of eight or nine feet, conſiſts only of
fragments of ſhells; but theſe fragments are
eaſily recogniſed to be thoſe of real ſhells; for
they ſtill retain their original channels or
furrows, and have only loſt their luſtre and
varniſh, as moſt ſhells do, after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
long under ground. The ſmalleſt
fragments are only duſt; but we know them
to be the duſt of ſhells, becauſe they conſiſt of
the very ſame matter with the larger frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the entire ſhells, which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
found. The ſpecies both of the large
fragments and of the entire ſhells, are eaſily
diſtinguiſhable. Some of theſe ſpecies belong
to the coaſt of Poitou, and others of them to
foreign ſhores. This maſs likewiſe furniſhes
corals, and other productions of the ſea. <hi>Falun</hi>
is the name by which this matter is diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that province; and it is found, wherever
the ground is dug, through an extent of about
nine leagues ſquare. The peaſants never dig
deeper than about 20 feet; becauſe, ſays Reau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
they imagine that the expence of labour
would exceed the value of the commodity.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0195400701:227"/>
They might, however, dig deeper. But our
calculation of 130,680,000 cubic fathoms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
upon the ſuppoſition of only 18 feet deep,
and 2200 fathoms to the league. Every article,
therefore, is undervalued, and this maſs of ſhells
muſt greatly exceed the above calculation; if
the quantity be only doubled, this wonderful
phaenomenon will be greatly augmented.'</p>
               <p>'In phyſical facts, there are little circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
often overlooked by the bulk of mankind,
which are, notwithſtanding, of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in illuſtrating the ſubject. M. de Reau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
has remarked, that all the fragments
of ſhells lie horizontally in the great maſs;
from which he concludes, that the fragments
were not depoſited at the ſame time with the
entire ſhells which originally formed this maſs;
becauſe, ſays he, the ſuperior ſhells would, by
their weight, have broken the inferior ones,
and the fragments, in that caſe, would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
have been diſpoſed in a thouſand differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
directions. The whole, therefore, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
entire or broken, muſt have been gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tranſported thither by the ſea, and, of courſe,
their poſition muſt have been horizontal; and,
though time alone was ſufficient to break them
down, and even to calcine them, it could not
vary their original poſition. Their tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
muſt have been gradual; for, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that ſuch an immenſe number of ſhells
could be ſuddenly crouded together, and yet
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0195400701:228"/>
preſerve a poſition uniformly horizontal; and
their being aſſembled in one place, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
this place to have once been the bottom
of a gulf or baſon.'</p>
               <p>'Though there are many veſtiges of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
deluge recorded in ſcripture; yet the
maſs of ſhells at Turenne could not be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of this deluge. Perhaps ſuch an amazing
maſs is no where to be found, even in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the ſea. But, ſuppoſing the deluge to
have forced ſuch a quantity from the ocean,
they would neceſſarily be carried off with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and precipitation; and, conſequently,
could never have been depoſited in the ſame
poſition. It behoved them to have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
ſlowly floating in the waves; and, of
courſe, their accumulation would require a
much longer time than a year.'</p>
               <p>'Upon the whole, it is plain, that, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or after the deluge, the earth, at leaſt ſome
parts of it, muſt have been in a very different
ſituation from what it now appears; that the ſea
and land muſt have had a different arrangement;
and, that there was formerly a great gulf in the
middle of Turenne. The changes recorded in
hiſtory, or even in antient fable, are inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
but they give us ſome idea of what
might be produced in a long ſeries of ages. M.
de Reaumur conjectures, that Turenne was
formerly a gulf of the ſea, and that the ſhells
were tranſported by a current. But this is only
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0195400701:229"/>
a mere conjecture, thrown out to ſupply the
place of a fact as yet imperfectly known. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any certain concluſion can be drawn, we
muſt have geographical charts of all thoſe
places where ſhells are found below the ſurface
of the earth. To accompliſh this, much time
and numberleſs obſervations are requiſite.
Science, however, may in time, perhaps, be
carried thus far.'</p>
               <p>An attention to the following circumſtances
will leſſen our ſurpriſe at this great collection of
ſhells: 1. Shell-fiſh multiply prodigiouſly, and
come to maturity in a very ſhort time. The
multitude of individuals in every ſpecies, is a
demonſtration of their amazing fertility. In a
ſingle day, for example, a maſs of oyſters, of
ſeveral fathoms in thickneſs, is often raiſed; the
rocks to which they are attached, diminiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
in a ſhort time; and ſome banks are
entirely exhauſted. The following year, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
furniſhes an equal quantity, and not the
ſmalleſt diminution appears. It is even doubted,
whether a natural bed of oyſters was ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
exhauſted. 2. The ſubſtance of ſhells is
analogous to that of ſtone; they are long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
when immerſed in ſoft matter; and they
eaſily petrify when connected with matter natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
hard; theſe foſſil ſhells, therefore, and other
productions of the ſea found on land, being the
ſpoils of many ages, muſt neceſſarily have accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated
into large maſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0195400701:230"/>
We have already remarked the prodigious
quantities of ſhells preſerved in marble, lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
chalk, marle, &amp;c.; that they appear in
maſſes like hills or mountains; and that they
often compoſe more than one half of the bodies
in which they are contained. Sometimes they
appear entire, and at other times in fragments,
but large enough to enable us to diſtinguiſh their
reſpective ſpecies. Here our knowledge of this
ſubject, derived from obſervation, ſtops. But I
go farther, and maintain, that ſhells are the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
employed by nature in the formation of
moſt ſtones; that chalk, marle, and lime-ſtone,
conſiſt entirely of the duſt or fragments of ſhells;
and, conſequently, that the quantity of decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
ſhells is infinitely greater than that of
thoſe which have been preſerved. Theſe poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſhall be fully eſtabliſhed in the ſection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
minerals; and I ſhall only here exhibit the
point of view in which the different ſtrata of
the earth ought to be conſidered. The firſt bed,
in which nothing of the original ſtructure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
is compoſed of mud depoſited by dews,
rains, and ſnow, and of particules of animal and
vegetable ſubſtances. The inferior beds of
chalk, marle, lime-ſtone, and marble, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of the ſpoils of ſhells and other ſea-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
mixed occaſionally with entire-ſhells or
fragments of them. But clay and vitrifiable
ſand are the materials compoſing the internal
parts of the globe. Theſe ſubſtances were vitrified
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0195400701:231"/>
at the time the earth aſſumed its figure, which
neceſſarily implies, that the whole was then in
a melted ſtate. The different ſpecies of granite,
flint, free-ſtone in large maſſes, ſlate, and coal,
derive their origin from ſand and clay; and
are alſo diſpoſed in beds. But tufa and pumice,
free-ſtone and flint in ſmall or detached pieces,
cryſtals, metals, pyrites, moſt minerals, ſulphurs,
&amp;c. are matters, the formation of which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
when compared with that of marble, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinable
ſtones, chalk, marle, and other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which are diſpoſed in horizontal beds,
and contain ſhells, or other relicts of the
ocean.</p>
               <p>As the terms I have employed may appear
obſcure or ambiguous, it is neceſſary to explain
them. By <hi>clays,</hi> I mean not only the white and
yellow clays, but likewiſe the blue, the ſoft, the
hard, the laminated, &amp;c. which I conſider to be
the ſcoriac of glaſs, or the decompoſitions of
glaſs. By <hi>ſand,</hi> I always underſtand vitrifiable
ſand; and I comprehend, under this denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not only the ſine ſand which produces free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
and which I maintain to be the powder
of glaſs, or rather of tufa, but alſo that ſand rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
off free-ſtone, and the ſtill groſſer kind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
ſmall gravel, proceeding from granite
and rock-ſtone, and which is brittle, angular, and
reddiſh, and generally found in the beds of thoſe
rivers which deſcend precipitantly from hills or
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0195400701:232"/>
mountains compoſed of granite or common rock.
The river Armanſon, which runs by Sernur in
Auxois, where all the ſtones are of common
rock, carries down great quantities of this groſs,
rough, and brittle ſand; it is of the ſame nature
with rock-ſtone, of which it is only ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as calcinable gravels are only particles of
free-ſtone. Beſides, rock-ſtone and granite are
the ſame ſubſtances; but I have uſed both terms,
becauſe they are conſidered by ſome as different
ſpecies. The ſame may be remarked of flints
and of free-ſtone in large maſſes: Theſe alſo
are ſpecies of granite; and I call them flints in
large maſſes, becauſe, like calcinable ſtones, they
are diſpoſed in beds, and alſo to diſtinguiſh them
from flints and free-ſtone in ſmall maſſes, as the
round flints and ſand-ſtones which have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation,
or are not found in beds of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
Theſe are recent productions, and have
not the ſame origin as flint and free-ſtone in
large maſſes, forming regular and extenſive ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.
Under <hi>ſlate</hi> I comprehend the blue, the
white, the gray, the reddiſh, and all the plated
ſtones. Theſe bodies are generally found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
laminated clay, and ſeem to be nothing elſe
but clay hardened into thin ſtrata by drying;
and this is the reaſon of the many cracks or fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
remarkable in ſuch ſubſtances. Coal and
jet are likewiſe referable to clay, and are found
under the laminated clays or ſlate. By <hi>tufa</hi> I
mean not only the common pumice which is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0195400701:233"/>
full of holes, and has an organized appearance,
but all beds of ſtone formed by the ſediments of
running waters, all the ſtalactites, incruſtations,
and every kind of ſtone that diſſolves by fire.
It does not admit of a doubt that all theſe are
new ſubſtances, and that they are conſtantly
growing. Tufa is only a maſs of ſtony matter,
not diſtinguiſhed by regular ſtrata. This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is commonly found in ſmall hollow cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
is regularly ſhaped, formed by rills or drip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings
at the foot or upon the declivities of hills,
and conſiſting of coats of marle or calcareous
earth. The cylindric form is the ſpecific cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of this kind of tufa, and it is always ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
oblique or ſtreight, according to the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the rills by which it is produced. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of theſe ſpurious quarries is inconſiderable,
and generally proportioned to the height of the
mountains which furniſh the materials of their
growth. The intervals between the cylinders
of the tufa, by the daily addition of freſh ſtony
matter, are at laſt filled up, and the whole aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
a compact and ſolid form; but it never
acquires the hardneſs of ſtone, and, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
is denominated by Agricola, <hi>marga tofacea
fiſtuloſa.</hi> In the tufa are often found impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the leaves of ſuch trees and plants as
grow in the neighbourhood; land-ſhells, well
preſerved, are likewiſe frequently found in the
tufa, but never any ſea-ſhells; it is, therefore, a
recent production, and ought to be ranked with
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0195400701:234"/>
ſtalactites, incruſtations, &amp;c. All theſe new
ſubſtances are a kind of ſpurious ſtones, formed
by the waſting of others, but never arrive at the
conſiſtence of real petrifaction.</p>
               <p>Cryſtal, precious ſtones, every ſtone that has
a regular figure, and even flints in ſmall maſſes
and conſiſting of concentric coats, whether
found in the perpendicular fiſſures of rocks, or
elſewhere, are only exudations, or the concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
juices of flint in large maſſes; they are,
therefore, new and ſpurious productions, the
genuine ſtalactites of flint or of granite.</p>
               <p>Shells are never found in common rock or
granite, nor in free-ſtone, although they often
appear in vitrifiable ſand, from which free-ſtone
derives its origin. This circumſtance ſeems to
indicate, that ſand, unleſs when perfectly pure,
cannot unite into free-ſtone or granite; and that
a mixture of ſhells, or of other heterogeneous
bodies, totally prevents it from cementing. I
have often examined thoſe ſmall round ſtones,
found in beds of ſand that are mixed with ſhells,
and never could diſcover in them a ſingle ſhell.
Theſe round ſtones are true concretions of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
formed in thoſe places where the ſand is
pure, and not mixed with heterogeneous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
which is the reaſon why no larger maſſes
are produced.</p>
               <p>We formerly remarked, that, at Amſterdam,
which is a very low country, ſea-ſhells were
found 100 feet below the ſurface, and at Marly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la-Ville,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0195400701:235"/>
6 leagues from Paris, at the depth of
75 feet. They have alſo been found in mines
below beds of rock of 50, 100, 200, and even
of 1000 feet thick, as is apparent in the Alps
and Pyernnees, where ſhells and other ſea-bodies
are found in the inferior ſtrata of immenſe
rocks, that have been cut through in a perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
direction. But to proceed in order:
Shells are found in the mountains of Spain,
France, and England, in all the marble quarries
of Flanders, in the mountains of Gueldres, in
all the hills round Paris, in thoſe of Burgundy
and Champagne; in a word, in all places where
the baſis is not compoſed of free-ſtone or tufa;
and, in all theſe places, the ſubſtance of the
ſtones conſiſts more of ſhells than of any other
matter. By ſhells, I mean not only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of ſhell-fiſh, but likewiſe thoſe of cruſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous
animals, the briſtles of ſea-hedge-hogs, and
all the productions of ſea-inſects, as corals, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drepores,
aſtroites, &amp;c. Any man may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
by the evidence of his own eyes, that,
in moſt marbles and calcinable ſtones, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of ſea-bodies is ſo great, as to exceed the
matter by which they are united.</p>
               <p>But, farther, ſea-bodies are found even on the
tops of the higheſt mountains of the Alps; for
example, on the top of Mount Cenis, in the
mountains of Genes, in the Apennines, and in
moſt of the ſtone and marble quarries of Italy.
They appear in the ſtones of which the moſt
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0195400701:236"/>
antient buildings in Rome are conſtructed, in
the mountains of Tirol, in the centre of Italy,
on the top of Mount Paterne near Boulogne, in
the hills of Pouille, in thoſe of Calabria, in many
parts of Germany and of Hungary, and, laſtly,
in all the high grounds of Europe<note n="*" place="bottom">See Steno, Ray, Woodward, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
               <p>In Aſia and Africa, travellers have remarked
ſeveral places, for example, 'upon the Caſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van
mountains, above Barute,' ſays Shaw<note n="†" place="bottom">See Shaw's travels, p. 344.</note>,
'where there is a curious bed of whitiſh ſtone,
but of the ſlate-kind, which contains, in every
fleak of it, a great number and variety of fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
Theſe, for the moſt part, lie exceedingly
flat and compreſſed, like the foſſil fern plants;
yet, at the ſame time, they are ſo well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that the ſmalleſt ſtrokes and lineaments
of their fins, ſcales, and other ſuperficial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,
are eaſily diſtinguiſhed.' Between
Cairo and Suez, and particularly upon all the
hills of Barbary, ſays the ſame author, are many
petrified ſhells and echini; moſt of them exactly
correſpond with the different ſpecies ſtill exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Red Sea. As to Europe, petriſied
fiſhes are to be met with in Switzerland, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
the quarry of Oningen, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Foſſil ſhells, ſays M. Bourguet, are to be
found in the long chain of mountains ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Portugal to the moſt eaſterly parts of
China, in the valleys of Europe, and in all the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0195400701:237"/>
mountains of Africa and America; and hence,
he remarks, we may conclude, that they alſo
exiſt in thoſe parts of the globe with which we
are ſtill unacquainted.</p>
               <p>The iſlands of Europe, of Aſia, and of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,
wherever men have had occaſion to dig,
whether in the mountains or in the vallies,
furniſh many examples of foſſil ſhells; and
this circumſtance demonſtrates, that iſlands are
analogous in ſtructure and formation to their
neighbouring continents<note n="*" place="bottom">See Lettres philoſ. ſur la formation des ſels, p. 305.</note>.</p>
               <p>Theſe facts are ſufficient to prove, that foſſil
ſhells, petrified fiſhes, and other productions of
the ocean, exiſt in great quantities in almoſt
every place where proper inveſtigations have
been made. 'It is true,' ſays Tancrid Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
'that ſea-ſhells are diſperſed occaſionally
on the earth by armies, and by the inhabitants
of towns and villages. La Loubere relates, in
his voyage to Siam, that the monkeys of the
Cape of Good Hope perpetually amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in tranſporting ſhells from the ſhores of
the ſea to the tops of the mountains. But this
is no ſolution to the queſtion, why theſe ſhells
are diſperſed through every climate of the
earth, or why they are found in the bowels of
the higheſt mountains, and diſpoſed in beds,
like thoſe in the bottom of the ocean.'</p>
               <p>Upon peruſing an Italian letter, printed at
Paris in the year 1746, concerning the changes
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0195400701:238"/>
this globe has undergone, I was aſtoniſhed to
find a repetition of Loubere's ſentiments. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified
fiſhes, in the opinion of this writer, are
always of rare ſpecies, which were rejected from
the Roman tables, becauſe they were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
to be wholeſome: And as to foſſil
ſhells, he ſays, that the pilgrims brought
from Syria, in the time of the cruſades, thoſe
ſhells peculiar to the Levant, which are now
found petrified in France, in Italy, and in other
parts of Chriſtendom. Why did he not add,
that the monkeys tranſported ſhells to the tops
of the higheſt mountains, which never were
inhabited by men? This he might have done
with great facility, and it would have given an
air of credibility to his hypotheſis! How ſhould
men, who pretend to philoſophy, differ ſo wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their opinions? It is not ſufficient, it
would appear, to find foſſil ſhells in almoſt
every part of the earth where pits have been
dug, nor to have quoted the teſtimonies of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
hiſtorians, as they may, according to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſyſtems, have imagined that ſhells exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
where none were to be found: We ſhall,
therefore, to prevent all prejudices of this kind,
quote the authority of ſome authors who had
no theory to ſupport, and whoſe habits of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
could only enable them to recogniſe
ſhells that were entire, and in the beſt preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This teſtimony will, perhaps, have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
authority with men who cannot judge of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0195400701:239"/>
facts, nor know the diſtinction between real
ſhells and their petrifactions.</p>
               <p>Every man may examine with his eyes the
banks of ſhells in the hills round Paris, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in the ſtone-quarries, as at Chauſſée
near Seve, at Iſly, Paſſy, and other places. A
great quantity of lenticular ſtones are to be
found at Villers-cotterets; the rocks are almoſt
entirely compoſed of them; and they are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
interſperſed with a kind of cement, by
which they are united. At Chaumont, the
quantity of ſhells is ſo great, that the whole
hills, which are pretty high, appear to conſiſt of
nothing elſe. The ſame phaenomenon is exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
at Courtagnon near Rheims, where there
is a bank of ſhells of about four leagues broad,
and the length is ſtill more conſiderable. I
mention theſe places, becauſe they are famous,
and the ſhells ſtrike the eyes of every beholder.</p>
               <p>With regard to foreign countries, let us at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the remarks of travellers.</p>
               <p>'In Syria and Phoenicia, in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
particularly of Latikea, the rocks are of
a hard chalky ſubſtance, from whence the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
city might borrow the name of the
<hi>White Promontory.</hi> The Nakoura, formerly
called the <hi>Scala Tyriorum,</hi> is of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and complexion; both of them including
a great variety of corals, ſhells, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of the deluge<note n="*" place="bottom">See Shaw's travels, p. 344.</note>.'</p>
               <p>

'But foſſil ſhells, and other the like teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the deluge, are very rare in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
near Sinai, the original menſtruum, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
of theſe marbles being too corroſive to
preſerve them. Yet, at Corondel, where the
rocks approach nearer to our free-ſtone, I
found a few chamae and pectunculi, and a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
echinus of the diſcoid kind. The ruins
of the ſmall village at Ain-el-Mouſa, and the
ſeveral conveyances we have there for water,
are all of them full of foſſil ſhells. The old
walls of Suez, and the remains that are left us
of its harbour, are likewiſe of the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,
all of them probably from the ſame
quarry. Between Suez and Cairo, likewiſe,
and all over the mountains of Lybia, near
Egypt, every little riſing ground and hillock
diſcovers great quantities of the echini, as well
as of the bivalve and turbinated ſhells, moſt of

their children, cattle, furniture, &amp;c. may be ſeen
converted into ſtone. 'But,' ſays Mr Shaw,
'all this is mere fiction, as I learned not only
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0195400701:241"/>
from Mr Mair, Conſul at Tripoli, who ſent ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
people to examine into the fact, but alſo
from men of credit and learning who had been
on the ſpot.'</p>
               <p>Near the Pyramids Mr Shaw diſcovered ſome
ſtones that had been hewn by workmen, and
were mixed with little round bodies like lentils,
and ſome of them reſembled barley half peeled.
'Theſe,' he ſays, 'were ſuppoſed to have been
fragments of victuals left by the workmen, and
are now petrified. But this account appears
to be very improbable,' &amp;c. Theſe lentils and
grains of barley are nothing but petrified ſhells,
known to every naturaliſt by the name of lentil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones.</p>
               <p>'Many foſſil ſtones,' ſays Miſſon<note n="*" place="bottom">See Voyage de Miſſon, tom. 3. p. 109.</note>, 'are
found in the neighbourhood of Maeſtricht, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

and in the mountain called the <hi>Huns.</hi>'</p>
               <p>'In the environs of ſienne, near Certaldo,
are many mountains of ſand filled with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
kinds of ſhells. Monte-mario, about a
mile from Rome, is alſo full of them. I have
remarked them in the Alps, in France, and in
other places. Olearius, Steno, Cambden, Speed,
and many other writers, have related the
ſame phaenomena<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. tom. 2. p. 312.</note>.'</p>
               <p>'The iſland of Cerigo,' ſays Thevenot<note n="‡" place="bottom">Voyage de Thevenot, tom. 1. p. 25.</note>,

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0195400701:242"/>
of the quantities of porphyry found in
it.' Now, porphyry, as obſerved above, is
compoſed of the prickles of the echinus, or ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedge-hog,
united by a very hard ſtony cement.</p>
               <p>'Oppoſite to Inchené, a village on the
eaſt bank of the Nile, I found petrified plants
growing naturally on a piece of ground about
two leagues in length, and of an inconſiderable
breadth. This is one of the moſt ſingular
productions in nature. The plants reſembled
the white corals that grow in the Red Sea<note n="*" place="bottom">See Voyage de Paul Lucas, tom. 2. p. 380.</note>.'</p>
               <p>'There are ſeveral ſpecies of petrifactions on

what grows in the Red Sea, are likewiſe found
on this mountain<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. tom. 3. p. 326.</note>.'</p>
               <p>'In mount Carmel,' ſays Shaw, 'we gather a
great many hollow ſtones, lined in their inſides
with a variety of ſparry matter, which, from
ſome diſtant reſemblance, are ſaid to be petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

Theſe are commonly beſtowed upon pilgrims,
not only as curioſities, but as antidotes againſt

               <p>'In going from Smyrna to Tauris,' ſays Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernier,
'when we came to Tocat, the heat was
exceſſive; we therefore left the common road
to the north of us, and went by the mountains,
where there are always ſhade and cool breezes.
In many places we found ſnow; and, upon the
tops of ſome of theſe mountains, we ſaw ſhells
reſembling thoſe upon the ſea-ſhore, which is
an extraordinary phaenomenon.'</p>
               <p>Let us attend to what Olearius ſays concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the petrified ſhells he obſerved in Perſia, and
in the rocks where the ſepulchres have been
cut near the village Pyrmaraus.</p>
               <p>'Three of us aſcended, by mutually aſſiſting
each other, the moſt frightful precipices, and
at laſt gained the ſummit, where we found
four large chambers, with ſeveral niches cut
out of the ſolid rock: But what ſtruck us moſt
was, to find in this vault, on the top of the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0195400701:244"/>
mountain, muſcle-ſhells; and in ſome parts
they appeared in ſuch quantities, that this
whole rock ſeemed to conſiſt of nothing but
ſand and ſhells. In returning from Perſia,
we perceived ſeveral of theſe ſhelly mountains
upon the coaſts of the Caſpian Sea.'</p>
               <p>To theſe authorities many others might be
added, were I not apprehenſive of tiring thoſe
who need no additional proofs on this ſubject,
and who have perceived with their eyes, as I
have done, the exiſtence of ſhells in all places
where they have been ſearched for.</p>
               <p>In France, we find not only the ſhells belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our own coaſts, but thoſe which never
appeared in our ſeas. Some philoſophers even
alledge, that the number of foreign petrified
ſhells greatly exceeds thoſe of our own climate.
But this opinion ſeems not to be well founded;
for, independent of ſuch ſhells as lie in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of deep water, and are ſeldom brought up
by fiſhers, and, of courſe, are regarded by us as
foreigners, though they may exiſt in our ſeas, I
find, upon compariſon, that more of the petrified
ſhells belong to our own ſhores than to any
other. For example, all the pectines, moſt
cockles, muſcles, oiſters, trumpet-ſhells, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhells,
limpets, nautili, ſtars, tubulites, corals,
madrepores, &amp;c. which are found ſo univerſally,
are really produced in our ſeas: And, though
many ſea-bodies appear, which are either foreign
or unknown, as the cornu ammonis, the lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0195400701:245"/>
Judaici, the large ſcrew, the buccinum cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>abajour,</hi> &amp;c. yet I am convinced, by repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
obſervation, that the number of theſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
is inconſiderable, when compared with the
ſhells which belong to our own coaſts. Beſide,
the madrepores, aſtroites, and all thoſe ſea-bodies
formed by inſects, conſtitute the baſis of our
marbles and lime-ſtone; for the ſhells, however
abundant, make but a ſmall part of theſe ſtones,
and many of them are produced in our own
ſeas, and particularly in the Mediterranean.</p>
               <p>The Red Sea produces corals, madrepores,
and ſea-plants, more abundantly than any other.
The port of Tor furniſhes an amazing quantity;
in calm weather, the quantity exhibited is ſo
great, that the bottom of the ſea reſembles a
foreſt: Some of the branched madrepores riſe
from eight to ten feet high. They are alſo
very common in the different parts of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean;
and are to be found in all gulfs,
iſlands, &amp;c. of every temperate climate, where
the ſea is not very deep.</p>
               <p>Mr Peyſſonel was the firſt who diſcovered
that coral, madrepores, &amp;c. were not plants, but
that they derived their origin from animals.
The truth of this diſcovery was long doubted:
Some naturaliſts at firſt rejected it with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drain.
But it ſoon gained univerſal aſſent; and
every man is now ſatisfied, that what was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
called ſea-plants, are nothing but hives,
or rather lodges, formed by inſects for their own
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0195400701:246"/>
habitation. Theſe bodies were originally claſſed
with minerals, then with plants, and now they
muſt for ever be recogniſed as the genuine ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of animals.</p>
               <p>Many ſhell fiſh inhabit the deepeſt parts of
the ocean, and are never thrown upon the coaſts;
authors have, therefore, termed them <hi>Pelagiae,</hi>
to diſtinguiſh them from the other kinds which
they call <hi>Littorales.</hi> It is probable that the cornu
ammonis, and ſome other ſpecies, found only in
a petrified ſtate, belong to the former, and that
they have been impregnated with ſtony matter
in the very places where they are diſcovered. It
is alſo probable, that the ſpecies of ſome animals
have been extinguiſhed, and that theſe ſhells
may be ranked among this number. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
foſſil bones found in Siberia, in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,
in Ireland, and ſeveral other places, ſeem
to confirm this conjecture; for no animal has
hitherto been diſcovered to whom bones of ſuch
enormous ſize could poſſibly belong.</p>
               <p>Foſſil ſhells, ſays Woodward, are found from
the top to the bottom of quarries, in pits, and in
the deepeſt mines of Hungary: And we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by Mr Ray, that they are found in the
rocks on the ſhores of Calda, and in Pembroke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
at the depth of 200 fathoms<note n="*" place="bottom">See Ray's diſcourſes, p. 178.</note>.</p>
               <p>Shells not only appear in a petrified ſtate at
great depths, and on the tops of the higheſt
mountains, but they are alſo found in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0195400701:247"/>
condition, having the colour, luſtre, and
lightneſs of ſea-ſhells; ſo that, to be fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
on this ſubject, nothing farther is requiſite
than to compare them with the ſhells found on
the ſhores of the ſea. The ſlighteſt examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will convince us, that petrified and foſſil
ſhells are preciſely the ſame with thoſe of the
ocean; for they are marked with the ſame fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
and articulations, however minute; and,
in the gloſſopetri and other teeth of fiſhes, which
are ſometimes found adhering to the jaw-bone,
it is obvious to remark, that the teeth are worn
and poliſhed at the extremities, and that they
have been uſed by the living animals.</p>
               <p>Foſſil ſhells are almoſt every where to be met
with; and, of thoſe of the ſame ſpecies, ſome
are ſmall, others large, ſome young, others old,
ſome entire, others imperfect; and ſometimes
young ones appear adhering to the old.</p>
               <p>The ſhell-fiſh called <hi>Purpura,</hi> has a long
tongue, the extremity of which is ſo ſharp and
oſſeous, that it pierces the ſhells of other fiſhes,
in order to extract nouriſhment from them,
Shells pierced in this manner are often found
in the bowels of the earth; which is an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible
proof that they were formerly inhabited
by living fiſhes, and that they exiſted in the ſame
places with the purpura<note n="*" place="bottom">See Woodward, p. 296. 300.</note>.</p>
               <p>The obeliſks of St Peter's at Rome, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to John of Latran, were ſaid to have been
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0195400701:248"/>
brought from the Egyptian pyramids: They
conſiſt of a red granite, whiche, as formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,
contains no ſhells. But the antient
marbles of Africa and Egypt, and the porphyry
ſaid to have been brought from Solomon's
temple, and the palaces of the Egyptian kings,
and employed in ſeveral of the Roman buildings,
are full of ſhells. Red porphyry is compoſed
of an infinite number of the prickles of that
ſpecies of echinus called a ſea-cheſnut; they
are placed very near each other, and form the
white points of the porphyry. Each of theſe
points have a black ſpeck in the middle, which
is the ſection of the longitudinal tube of
the prickle of the echinus. At Ficin in Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
three leagues from Dijon, there is a red ſtone
ſo ſimilar to porphyry, that it differs only in
denſity, not being harder than marble: It is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
compoſed of the points or prickles of the
echini, and the ſtratum of it is conſiderable both
in thickneſs and extent. Many excellent pieces
of workmanſhip are made of it in this province,
and particularly the ſteps that lead to the pedeſtal
of the equeſtrian ſtatue of Louis le Grand at
Dijon. This ſpecies of ſtone is alſo found in
Montbard in Burgundy; it is ſofter than marble;
but it contains ſtill more prickles of the echini,
and a ſmaller proportion of red matter. Thus
the antient porphyry of Egypt, and the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry
of Burgundy, differ only in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of hardneſs, and in the quantity of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0195400701:249"/>
prickles or points of the echinus contained in
them.</p>
               <p>With regard to what is called green porphyry,
I imagine it to be rather a granite than a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry.
It is not, like the red porphyry, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of the prickles of the echinus; and its
ſubſtance reſembles more that of common gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.
The antient walls of Volatera in Tuſcany,
have been built of ſtones in which are many
ſhells, and this wall was built 2500 years ago<note n="*" place="bottom">See Steno de ſolido intra ſolidum, p. 63.</note>.
Moſt marbles, porphyries, and other ſtones em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the buildings of the antients, contain
ſhells, and other productions of the ocean, in the
ſame manner as ſome of our modern marbles.
Hence we conclude with ſafety, that, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the teſtimony of holy writ, the earth,
before the deluge, was compoſed of the ſame
materials that it is at preſent.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, it is apparent, that petrified
ſhells are found in Europe, in Aſia, in Africa,
and in every place where proper reſearches have
been made. They are alſo found in America,
in the Braſils, for example, in Tucumama, in
Terra Magellanica, and in ſuch vaſt quantities in
the Antilles, that what the inhabitants call lime,
which lies immediately below the ſoil, is nothing
but a congeries of ſhells, corals, madrepores,
aſtroites, and other ſea-bodies. Theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible
facts would have led me to conclude,
that petrified ſhells, and other productions of the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0195400701:250"/>
ocean, were to be found through the whole
continent of America, and eſpecially in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
as is affirmed by Woodward. But M. de
la Condamine, who lived ſeveral years in Peru,
aſſures me, that he was never able to diſcover
any of them in the Cordeliers, although he had
diligently ſearched for them. This phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon
would indeed be ſingular, and would lead
to concluſions ſtill more ſingular. But, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
the teſtimony of this celebrated obſerver
notwithſtanding, I am ſtrongly inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that there is, in the mountains of Peru, as
well as every where elſe, petrified ſhells and other
ſea-bodies, although they have not yet been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.
In matters that depend on teſtimony,
the poſitive evidence of two witneſſes is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
proof; but the evidence of ten thouſand
witneſſes, who only declare in the negative, that
they never obſerved a particular appearance, give
riſe to nothing more than a ſlight doubt. Thus
reaſon, joined to the force of a general analogy,
obliges me to perſiſt in believing that foſſil ſhells
will ſtill be found in the mountains of Peru, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
if they be ſearched for in the ſides, and
not on the very ſummits.</p>
               <p>The tops of high mountains are generally
compoſed of granite, free-ſtone, and other vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
materials, which never contain ſhells.
Theſe matters were all formed out of beds of
ſand, when they were covered by the ſea. But,
when the waters left the mountains, they would
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0195400701:251"/>
carry off the ſand, and other light bodies, into the
plains, and leave nothing on their tops but thoſe
beds of rock which had been formed below the
ſtratum of ſand. At two, three, or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
fathom below the ſummit of theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
we often find marbles and other calcinable
matters, diſpoſed in parallel beds, and contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhells and other ſea-bodies. Hence, if M.
de la Condamine examined only the moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
places, which conſiſt of granite, of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
or of vitrifiable ſand, it is not ſurpriſing
that he did not find foſſil ſhells. But he ought
to have explored the lower parts of the Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,
and he would unqueſtionably have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
beds of marble, earth, &amp;c. mixed with
ſhells; for ſuch beds have been found in every
part of the world that has undergone a proper
examination.</p>
               <p>But, ſuppoſing it to be a fact, that there are
no productions of the ocean in the mountains of
Peru, nothing could be concluded from it that
would affect our theory. Some parts of the
globe, and particularly places of ſuch elevation
as the Cordeliers, might never have been cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the ſea. Theſe mountains, however,
would be an ample field for curious obſervation.
They would not, in that caſe, conſiſt of parallel
beds. Their materials would be very different
from all others: They would have no perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
fiſſures: The ſtructure of the ſtones and
rocks would have no reſemblance to thoſe of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0195400701:252"/>
other countries: <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Theſe mountains would
exhibit the antient ſtructure of the earth before
it was changed by the motion of the waters;
they would diſcover the primitive ſtate of the
globe, its original form, the natural arrangement
and connection of its parts. But this notion is
ſupported by too ſlender a foundation; and it is
more conſonant to the rules of philoſophy to
believe that foſſil ſhells exiſt in the mountains
of Peru, in the ſame manner as they exiſt every
where elſe.</p>
               <p>With regard to the poſition of ſhells in beds
of earth or of ſtone, let us attend to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paſſage of Woodward: 'All the ſhells that
are found in numberleſs ſtrata of earth, and
rocks, in the higheſt mountains, and in the
moſt profound quarries and mines, in flint,
cornelian, agate, &amp;c. and in maſſes of ſulphur,
marcaſites, and other mineral and metallic bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
are filled with the ſame ſubſtances that
compoſe the ſtrata in which they are included,
and never with any heterogeneous matter;'
p. 206. &amp;c.—'We now find in the ſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
of all countries (the ſpecific gravity of
the ſeveral ſorts whereof is very little different,
being generally to water as 2½ or 2 9/10 to 1)
only thoſe conchae, pectines, cochleae, and
other ſhells that are nearly of the ſame gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
viz. 2½ or 2 5/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to 1. But theſe are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
found encloſed in it in prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
whereas, of oiſter-ſhells, (which are in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0195400701:253"/>
gravity but as about 2⅓ to 1) of echini, (which
are but as 2, or 2⅛ to 1) or the other lighter
kinds of ſhells, ſcarce one ever appears therein.
On the contrary, in chalk (which is lighter
than ſtone, being but as about 2 1/10 to 1) there
are only found echini, and the other lighter
ſorts of ſhells;' p. 32. 33.</p>
               <p>It muſt here be remarked, that what Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſays with reſpect to ſpecific gravity, is not
univerſally true; for ſhells of different ſpecific
gravities are often found in the ſame matters;
ſhells of cockles, of oiſters, and of echini, for
example, are found in the ſame bed of ſtones or
of earth. In the cabinet of the French King,
there is a cockle petrified in a cornelian, and
echini petrified in an agate. Hence the difference
in the ſpecific gravity of ſhells has had leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon their poſition in the ſtrata of the
earth than Woodward would have us to believe.
The reaſon why the ſhells of the echini, and
others of a light texture, abound ſo much in
chalk, is owing to this circumſtance, that chalk
itſelf is only decompoſed ſhells; thoſe of the
echini being lighter and thinner than others,
would be moſt eaſily reduced to powder or
chalk; and hence beds of chalk could only exiſt
in thoſe places where were formerly collected
by the ſea great quantities of light ſhells, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of which would form that chalk in
which we ſtill find ſhells that have reſiſted the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0195400701:254"/>
operation of time, either in an entire ſtate, or in
fragments ſufficient to diſcover their ſpecies.</p>
               <p>This ſubject ſhall be treated more fully in the
article of Minerals; I ſhall here only obſerve,
that Woodward's expreſſions are often too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
He appears to aſſert, that ſhells are
found as frequently, and in as great abundance,
in flints, cornelians, calcedonii, ores, and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
as in other matters. But the fact is, that
ſhells are a very rare phaenomenon in vitrifiable
or purely inflammable ſubſtances; and, in chalk,
marle, and marbles, the quantity of them is ſo
prodigious, that it is impoſſible to affirm that the
lighter and heavier ſhells are uniformly found in
ſtrata correſponding to their ſpecific gravities,
though, in general, this may be the caſe oftener
than otherwiſe. They are all impregnated with
the bodies in which they are immerſed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the horizontal beds, or in the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
fiſſures, becauſe the whole has been effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the operation of water, though at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
times and in different manners. Thoſe found
in the horizontal beds of ſtone, marble, &amp;c.
have been tranſported and depoſited by the
waves of the ſea; and thoſe found in flints,
cornelians, and other ſubſtances peculiar to the
perpendicular fiſſures, were formed by rills of
water impregnated with lapidific or metallic
ſubſtances. In both caſes, the matter that fills
the ſhells has been in the ſtate of a fine impal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0195400701:255"/>
powder; becauſe every pore of them is
compleatly filled, and the moulds of them are as
exact as the impreſſions of a ſeal upon wax.</p>
               <p>It is, therefore, apparent, that, in ſtone, marble,
&amp;c. there are multitudes of ſhells ſo entire, and
ſo well preſerved, that they may be compared
with thoſe in our cabinets, or upon the ſhores of
the ſea.</p>
               <p>'There being, I ſay, beſides theſe, ſuch vaſt
multitudes of ſhells contained in ſtone, &amp;c.
which are entire, fair, and abſolutely free from
any ſuch mineral contagion; which are to be
matched by others at this day found upon our
ſhores, and which do not differ in any reſpect
from them; being of the ſame ſize that thoſe
are of, and the ſame ſhape preciſely; of the
ſame ſubſtance and texture, as conſiſting of the
ſame peculiar matter, and this conſtituted and
diſpoſed in the ſame manner as is that of their
reſpective fellow-kinds at ſea; the tendency
of the fibres and ſtriae the ſame; the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the lamellae, conſtituted by theſe
fibres, alike in both; the ſame veſtigia of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
(by means whereof the animal is faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and joined to the ſhell) in each; the ſame
papillae; the ſame futures, and every thing
elſe, whether within or without the ſhell, in
its cavity, or upon its convexity, in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
or upon the ſurface of it. Beſides,
theſe foſſil, ſhells are attended with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0195400701:256"/>
accidents of the marine ones, ex. gr. they
ſometimes grow to one another, the leſſer ſhells
being fixed to the larger: They have balani, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli
vermiculares, pearls, and the like, ſtill actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
growing upon them. And, which is very
conſiderable, they are moſt exactly of the ſame
ſpecific gravity with their fellow-kinds now
upon the ſhores. Nay farther, they anſwer
all chymical trials in like manner as the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhells
do; their parts, when diſſolved, have
the ſame appearance to view, the ſame ſmell
and taſte<note n="*" place="bottom">Woodward, p. 23. 24.</note>.'</p>
               <p>I have often obſerved, with aſtoniſhment,
whole mountains, chains of rocks, and extenſive
quarries, ſo full of ſhells, and other ſea-bodies,
that there was hardly ſpace left for the matters
in which they are depoſited.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen ſome arable fields ſo full of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified
cockles, that they might be picked up by
a blind man, others entirely covered with cornu
ammonis, and others with cardites; and the more
this ſubject is inquired into, we ſhall be the more
thoroughly convinced, that the number of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifactions
is infinite, and that it was abſolutely
impoſſible that all the animals which inhabited
theſe ſhells could exiſt at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>I have farther remarked, that the ſtones of
thoſe arable lands which abound with petrified
ſhells in an entire form, well preſerved, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
from all other matter, are frittered down
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0195400701:257"/>
by froſt, which deſtroys ſtones, but has little ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
upon petrified ſhells.</p>
               <p>Theſe immenſe quantities of petrified ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies,
found in ſo many different places and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations,
prove, that they could not be tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and depoſited by the waters of the deluge;
for the greateſt part of them, inſtead of being
found in the bowels of the earth, and in ſolid
marble at the depth of ſeven or eight hundred
feet, behoved to have remained on the ſurface.</p>
               <p>In all quarries, petrified ſhells form part of
the internal ſtructure of the ſtone, the ſurface
of which is often covered with ſtalactites, a
matter much leſs antient than the ſtone that
contains the ſhells. Another proof that theſe
ſhells could not be derived from the deluge is,
that the bones, horns, claws, &amp;c. of land-ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
are ſeldom found in a petrified ſtate, and
are never incorporated in marble, or other hard
ſtones; whereas, if theſe effects had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the deluge, the remains of land-ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
would have been found in marbles, as well
as thoſe of fiſhes.</p>
               <p>To alledge, that the earth was entirely diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at the time of the deluge, is a mere gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
ſuppſition, which required a ſecond miracle
in order to give water the power of an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
diſſolvent. Beſides, it infers an evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction;
for, if water was then an univerſal
menſtruum, how could ſhells have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in the entire ſtate in which we find them?
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0195400701:258"/>
This is an evident demonſtration, that no ſuch
diſſolution took place, and that the parallel ſtrata
were not formed in an inſtant, but were gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
produced by ſucceſſive ſediments; for, it is
apparent to every obſerver, that the diſpoſition
of all the materials compoſing the earth has been
occaſioned by the operation of water. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
queſtion, therefore, that remains, is, whether
this arrangement of parts was produced all at
once, or in a ſucceſſion of time? Now, it has
already been ſhown, that it could not poſſibly
happen at one time; becauſe the materials are
not diſpoſed according to their ſpecific gravities,
and becauſe they never ſuffered a general diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
This arrangement, therefore, muſt have
originated from ſucceſſive ſediments. Any other
cauſe, or particular revolution, would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
riſe to an arrangement totally different. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
particular revolutions, or accidental cauſes,
could never have produced a uniform diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of horizontal and parallel ſtrata throughout
the whole globe.</p>
               <p>Let us attend to what the hiſtorian of the
Academy<note n="*" place="bottom">Année 1718, p. 3.</note> has ſaid upon this ſubject.</p>
               <p>'The many marks of extenſive inundations,
and the manner in which mountains muſt be
conceived to have been produced, demonſtrate,
that the ſurface of this earth has ſuffered great
revolutions. However deep we penetrate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0195400701:259"/>
to the globe, we diſcover nothing but ruins,
bodies of different kinds amaſſed and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
without any order or apparent deſign.
If there be any regularity in the ſtructure of
the earth, it lies too deep for our reſearches;
we muſt, therefore, confine ourſelves to the
ruins of the external cruſt, which will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
to occupy the attention of philoſophers.'</p>
               <p>'M. de Juſſieu diſcovered, in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of St Chaumont, a great quantity of
ſlaty or laminated ſtones, every lamina of
which was marked with the impreſſion of a
ſtem, leaf, or other portion of ſome plant. In
the impreſſions of leaves, they were uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extended, as if they had been ſtreached in
the ſtones by the hand; a clear demonſtration
that they had been tranſported by water,
which always keeps leaves in that poſition:
Their ſituations were various, and ſometimes
they lay acroſs each other.'</p>
               <p>'It is natural to imagine, that a leaf depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by water upon ſoft mud, and then cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a ſimilar layer of mud, would impreſs
upon the lowermoſt layer the figure of its one
ſide, and upon the uppermoſt the figure of its
oppoſite ſide; and, after theſe layers hardened
and petrified, that they would each bear an
impreſſion of a different ſide of the leaf. But
this ſuppoſition, however natural, does not
take place: The two laminae of ſtone uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0195400701:260"/>
formly bear the impreſſion of the ſame ſide
of the leaf, the one in alto, the other in baſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relief.
For this obſervation, with regard to
the figured ſtones of St Chaumont, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to M. de Juſſieu; but we leave the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it to himſelf, and ſhall proceed to
remarks of a more general and intereſting na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.'</p>
               <p>'All the impreſſions on the ſtones of Saint
Chaumont are of foreign plants, which are
not to be found in any part of France; they
are natives either of the Eaſt Indies, or of the
warmer climates of America. Moſt of them
belong to the capillary tribes, and they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
particular ſpecies of ferns, the cloſe
texture of which enables them both to make
deep impreſſions, and to remain long in a ſtate
of preſervation. M. Leibnitz was aſtoniſhed
to find the impreſſions of the leaves of a few
Eaſt India plants upon ſome ſtones in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:
In the example under conſideration,
the wonder is greatly augmented; for, by
ſome unaccountable deſtination of nature, it
would appear, in all the ſtones of Saint Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,
not a ſingle impreſſion of a native plant
is to be found.'</p>
               <p>'From the number of foſſil ſhells in the
mountains and quarries exhibited in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as well as in many others, it is apparent,
that it muſt have formerly been covered with
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0195400701:261"/>
the ſea. But how could the American or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
oceans come hither?'</p>
               <p>'To ſolve this and other ſurpriſing phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,
we may ſuppoſe, with much probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that the ſea originally covered the whole
globe. But this ſuppoſition will not anſwer;
becauſe no terreſtrial plants could then exiſt:
The plants of one country, therefore, could
only be tranſported to another by great inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.'</p>
               <p>'M. de Juſſieu imagines, that, as the bed of
the ſea is always riſing higher by means of the
mud and ſand inceſſantly carried into it by the
rivers, the ſea, at firſt confined by natural dikes,
might at laſt ſurmount them, and ſpread over
the land to great diſtances; or, which would
produce the ſame effect, the dikes might in
time be rendered ſo thin, by the conſtant ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the water, that they would at laſt
give way. Soon after the formation of the
earth, when nothing had aſſumed a regular
or ſettled form, ſudden and prodigious revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
might then be produced, of which we
have now no examples, becauſe every thing
is in ſuch a fixed and permanent ſtate, that
only ſlow and inconſiderable changes can take
place: It is for this reaſon that we find a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in crediting revolutions more ſudden
and tremendous.'</p>
               <p>'By ſome of theſe great revolutions the Weſt
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0195400701:262"/>
or Eaſt Indian Oceans might have been poured
in upon Europe: In their journey, they would
tear up foreign plants, carry them off floating
on the waves, and gently depoſite them in
ſhallow places, from which the waters would
ſoon evaporate.'</p>

THEORY OF THE EARTH.</head>
               <head>ARTICLE IX.</head>
               <head>Of the Inequalities upon the Earth's Surface.</head>
               <p>THOUGH the inequalities upon the ſurface
of the earth may be conſidered as a defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in its figure, they are abſolutely neceſſary to
vegetation and animal life. To be convinced of
this, we need only conſider what would be
the condition of the earth, were its ſurface per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
ſmooth and regular. Inſtead of thoſe
beautiful hills which furniſh abundance of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for ſupporting the verdure of the earth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of thoſe richly garniſhed fields, where
plants and animals find an eaſy and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſubſiſtence, a dreary ocean would cover the
whole globe, and the earth, deprived of all its
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0195400701:264"/>
valuable and alluring qualities, would be an
obſcure, abandoned planet, ſuited only for the
habitation of fiſhes.</p>
               <p>But, independent of moral conſiderations,
which ſeldom ought to be employed in natural
philoſophy, the ſurface muſt, from a phyſical
neceſſity, have been irregular; for, ſuppoſing it
to have been originally ſmooth and level, the
motion of the waters, ſubterraneous fires, the
winds, and other external cauſes, would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
produce, in time, irregularities ſimilar to
thoſe which we now behold.</p>
               <p>Next to the elevation of mountains, the depths
of the ocean form the greateſt inequalities. This
depth is exceedingly diverſified, even at great
diſtances from land. In ſome places the ſea is
ſaid to be a league in depth; but that is a rare
phaenomenon; and the moſt common depths
are from 60 to 150 fathoms. Gulfs and branches
of the ocean that run in upon the land, are ſtill
leſs deep; and ſtraits are generally the moſt
ſhallow places.</p>
               <p>Depths are commonly ſounded by a piece of
lead, 30 or 40 pounds weight, fixed to a ſmall
rope. This method anſwers well enough for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
depths, but is liable to error when the
depth is very great; for the cord being ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
lighter than water, after much of it has
been wound down, the weight of the lead and
that of the cord become nearly equal to their
bulks of water; then the lead deſcends no more,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0195400701:265"/>
but runs off in an oblique line, and floats at the
ſame depth. Hence, in ſounding great depths,
an iron chain, or ſome body heavier than water,
ſhould be employed. It is for want of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this circumſtance, that ſome navigators
have been led to maintain, that the ſea, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places, has no bottom.</p>
               <p>In general, the depths in open ſeas augment
or diminiſh in a pretty regular manner, being
commonly deeper the farther from land. But
to this remark there are many exceptions; for
there are places in the middle of the ſea, as at
the <hi>Abrolhos</hi> in the Atlantic, where large ſhelves
appear; and there are, in other places, vaſt
ſand-banks, well known to the mariners who ſail
to the Eaſt Indies.</p>
               <p>Along coaſts, the depths are likewiſe very irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.
However, it may be laid down as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
rule, that the depth is always proportioned
to the height of the coaſt: The ſame obſervation
applies to rivers.</p>
               <p>It is eaſy to meaſure the height of mountains,
either geometrically or by the barometer. This
inſtrument determines the height of a mountain
pretty exactly, eſpecially in countries where its
variation is not conſiderable, as at Peru and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
equatorial climates. By one or other of
theſe methods, the height of moſt mountains has
already been aſcertained; for example, it has
been found, that the higheſt mountains of Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland
exceed Canigau, the moſt elevated of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0195400701:266"/>
the Pyrennees, 1600 fathoms<note n="*" place="bottom">See Hiſt. de l'Acad. 1708, p. 24.</note>. Theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
appear to be the higheſt in Europe, ſince
they give riſe to a great number of rivers which
run into different and very diſtant ſeas, as the
Po, which empties itſelf in the Adriatic, the
Rhine, which loſes itſelf in the ſands of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
the Rhone, which falls into the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,
and the Danube, which runs into the
Black Sea. Theſe four rivers, the mouths of
which are ſo diſtant, derive part of their waters
from Saint Godard and the neighbouring moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
a clear proof that this place is the moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
part of Europe.</p>
               <p>Mount Taurus, Imaus, Caucaſus, and the
mountains of Japan, are higher than any in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.
The mountains of Africa, as the great
Atlas, and the mountains of the Moon, are at
leaſt equally high with thoſe of Aſia; and the
higheſt of all are thoſe of South America, and
eſpecially of Peru, which are 3000 fathoms above
the level of the ſea. In general, the tropical
mountains are more elevated than thoſe of the
temperate zones, and the latter are higher than
thoſe nearer the poles. Thus, the nearer the
Equator, the greater are the ſuperficial inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which, though conſiderable with regard to
us, are nothing when eſtimated in relation to the
whole globe. A difference of 3000 fathoms in 3000
leagues diameter, is but a fathom to a league, or a
foot to 2200 feet, and, upon a globe of 2½ feet,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0195400701:267"/>
would not make the 16th part of a French line.
Hence this earth, which to us appears to be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
and interſected by mountains of an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
height, and by ſeas of a dreadful depth,
is, in relation to its ſize, but ſlightly furrowed
with inequalities ſo inconſiderable, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make any variation upon its general figure.</p>
               <p>The mountains, in continents, form continued
chains; but, in iſlands, they are more interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
generally riſe in the form of a cone, or py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid,
and are diſtinguiſhed by the name of
peaks. The Peak of Teneriffe, in the Iſland of
Fer, is one of the higheſt mountains in the earth;
it is nearly a league and a half perpendicular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the level of the ſea. The Peak of St
George in one of the Azores, and the Peak of
Adam, in the Iſland of Ceylon, are likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
high. Theſe peaks are compoſed of
rocks, piled above each other; and all of them
throw out, from their ſummits, fire, aſhes, bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
minerals, and ſtones. Some iſlands, as St
Helena, Aſcenſion Iſle, and moſt of the Canaries
and Azores, are only the tops or points of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
It is alſo worthy of remark, that the
middle of moſt iſlands, promontories, and capes,
is the moſt elevated, and that they are generally
divided into two parts, by chains of mountains
which run in the direction of their greateſt
length: In Scotland, for example, the Grampian
mountains (Grans-bain) extend from eaſt to
weſt, and divide the Iſland of Great Britain into
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0195400701:268"/>
two parts: The ſame thing takes place in Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matra,
the Lucca Iſlands, Borneo, Celebes, Cuba,
St Domingo, the peninſulas of Corea and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laya,
&amp;c. Italy is alſo longitudinally traverſed
by the Appennines.</p>
               <p>Mountains, as mentioned above, are of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
heights; the hills are loweſt; then follow
the mountains of an ordinary height, which
are ſucceeded by a third range ſtill higher. All
theſe are commonly covered with trees and plants;
but neither of them furniſh ſprings excepting at
their bottoms. In the laſt and higheſt range,
we find nothing but ſand, looſe ſtones, flints,
and rocks, the tops of which often reach above
the clouds. Preciſely at the foot of theſe rocks,
are little plains, or hollows, which collect rains
and ſnow, and form thoſe ponds, moraſſes, or
fountains, from which the rivers derive their
ſources<note n="*" place="bottom">See Lettres philoſophiques fur la formation des fels, &amp;c. p. 198.</note>.</p>
               <p>The figure of mountains is likewiſe very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.
Some conſiſt of long chains of nearly
an equal height; others are interſected by deep
vallies; the contours of ſome mountains are
pretty uniform; thoſe of others are moſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
and ſometimes a detached little mountain
appears in the middle of a plain or valley. There
are alſo two kinds of plains; ſome occupy the
low grounds, and others appear in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
The former are generally divided by
ſome large river; but the latter, though their
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0195400701:269"/>
extent be conſiderable, are dry, or furniſhed with
only a ſmall rill. The plains in the mountains
are often exceedingly high, always of difficult
acceſs, and form one country above another, as
in Auvergne, Savoy, and other elevated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.
The ſoil of them is firm, and produces
plenty of herbs and odoriferous plants, which
renders them the fineſt paſture-grounds in the
world.</p>
               <p>The tops of high mountains are compoſed of
rocks of different elevations, which, when view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at a diſtance, make them reſemble the waves
of the ſea<note n="*" place="bottom">See ibid. p. 196.</note>. This is not the only reaſon for
our affirming that mountains were formed by
the motions of the ſea; I only mention it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it correſponds with every other phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon.
But the following facts put this point
beyond all controverſy: The foſſil ſhells, and
other ſea-bodies, every where found in ſuch
profuſion, that they could not poſſibly be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
from the ſea, in its preſent ſtate, into
continents ſo diſtant, and depoſited at ſuch great
depths in the bowels of the mountains: The
univerſal paralleliſm of the different ſtrata, an
effect which could only be produced by water,
and the compoſition even of the moſt denſe of
them, as thoſe of ſtone and marble, which clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evinces, that, before their formation, they had
been reduced into a fine powder, and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to the bottom in the form of ſediments:
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0195400701:270"/>
The exactneſs with which the foſſil ſhells are
moulded in the matters in which they are found:
The cavities of foſſil ſhells, which are uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
filled with the ſame ſubſtances that contain
them: The correſponding angles of hills and
mountains, which nothing could effect but the
currents of the ocean: The equality in the
heights of oppoſite hills, and the different ſtrata
uniformly appearing at the ſame levels: And,
laſtly, the direction of mountains, the chains of
which extend longitudinally, like the waves of
the ſea.</p>
               <p>With regard to the depths or hollows on the
ſurface of the earth, thoſe of the ocean are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
the greateſt. But, as theſe are hid
from human view, and can only be diſcovered
by ſounding, we ſhall confine ourſelves to thoſe
which appear on the dry land, ſuch as deep val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
precipices found between rocks, abyſſes
that preſent themſelves in high mountains, as the
abyſs of Mount Ararat, the precipices of the
Alps, the vallies of the Pyrennees, &amp;c. Theſe
depths are a natural conſequence of the elevation
of mountains; they receive the water and earth
carried down from the high grounds; their
ſoil is generally fertile; and they are full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.
The precipices among rocks are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
occaſioned by a ſudden ſinking of one ſide,
the baſe, which generally inclines more one way
than another, being looſened by the action
of the air, and of froſt, or by the violence of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0195400701:271"/>
torrents. But abyſſes, or thoſe enormous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices
that appear on the tops of ſome moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and, to the bottom of which, though their
circumference be a mile and a half, or three
miles round, it is impoſſible to deſcend, have
been formed by the operation of fire. They
have been the furnaces of antient volcano's, the
matter of which has been exhauſted by explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and the long action of fires, which are
now extinguiſhed from the want of combuſtible
matter. Of this kind is the abyſs of Mount
Ararat, deſcribed by Tournefort. It is ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with rocks that are black and burned. The
abyſſes of Aetna and of Veſuvius will have the
ſame appearance after their inflammable mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
are exhauſted.</p>
               <p>In Plot's hiſtory of the country of Stafford in
England, there is an account of a kind of gulf,
which was ſounded by a rop of 2600 feet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
finding either watter or bottom, the rop
being too ſhort<note n="*" place="bottom">See Journal des Savans, 1680, p. 12.</note>.</p>
               <p>The greateſt cavities, and the deepeſt mines,
are generally in the mountains, and they ſeldom
deſcend to the level of the plains; and we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
by them the internal ſtructure of the
mountain only, not that of the globe itſelf.</p>
               <p>Beſides, theſe depths are not very conſiderable.
Mr Ray affirms, that the deepeſt mines exceed
not half a mile. The mine of Cotteberg, which,
in the time of Agricola, was eſteemed to be the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0195400701:272"/>
deepeſt in the world, was only 2500 feet of
perpendicular depth. There are, indeed, holes
in particular places, as that mentioned by Plot,
or Pool's hole in the county of Derby, the depth
of which is probably very great: But none of
them bear any ſenſible proportion to the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the globe.</p>
               <p>If the kings of Egypt, in place of erecting
pyramids as monuments of their vanity and
riches, had expended equal ſums in making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
excavations into the bowels of the earth,
to the depth of perhaps a league, they might
have diſcovered ſubſtances which would have
recompenſed their labour; they would at leaſt
have extended the knowledge of the earth's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
ſtructure, which might have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
of much utility.</p>
               <p>But, let us return to the mountains. The
higheſt of them lie between the tropics; and
the nearer we approach to the equator, the
greater are the inequalities on the earth's ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.
A ſhort enumeration of mountains and
iſlands will be ſufficient to eſtabliſh this point.</p>
               <p>In America, the Cordeliers, which are the
higheſt mountains in the world, lie preciſely
under the equator, and they extend on both ſides
a conſiderable way beyond the Tropic circles.</p>
               <p>The higheſt mountains of the Moon, of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomotapa,
and the great and little Atlas, in
Africa, lie either under or very near the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0195400701:273"/>
In Aſia, Mount Caucaſus, the chain of which,
under different names, runs into China, and,
through this whole extent, lies nearer the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
than the poles.</p>
               <p>In Europe, the Pyrennees, the Alps, and the
mountains of Greece, which form one chain,
are ſtill leſs diſtant from the equator than the
pole.</p>
               <p>Theſe chains of mountains, of which we
have given an enumeration, are higher, and of
greater extent, both in length and in breadth,
than thoſe of more northern countries. With
regard to their direction, the Alps form a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
chain which runs acroſs the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
from Spain to China. They commence
on the ſea-coaſt of Galicia, join the Pyrennees,
traverſe France, by Vivares and Auvergne, run
through Italy, and ſtretch into Germany, above
Dalmatia, until they reach Macedonia; from
thence they join the mountains of Armenia,
the Caucaſus, the Taurus, the Imaus, and at
laſt terminate on the coaſt of Tartary. Mount
Atlas, in the ſame manner, traverſes the whole
Continent of Africa, from the kingdom of Fez
to the ſtraits of the Red Sea. The mountains
of the Moon have likewiſe the ſame direction.</p>
               <p>But the mountains of America have an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
direction. The vaſt chains of Cordeliers,
and other mountains, run more from ſouth to
north than from eaſt to weſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0195400701:274"/>
What we have now remarked concerning the
greateſt elevations of the land, applies equally to
the greateſt depths of the ſea. The moſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
and deepeſt ſeas lie nearer the equator than
the poles: From theſe united obſervations, the
truth of our general poſition, that the greateſt
inequalities of the globe are to be found in the
equatorial regions, is ſufficiently eſtabliſhed.
Theſe irregularities on the ſurface of the earth
give riſe to a number of curious phaenomena.
Between the Indus and the Ganges, for example,
there is a large peninſula, through the middle
of which runs a chain of high mountains, called
the <hi>Gate,</hi> which extends, from north to ſouth,
from the extremity of Mount Caucaſus to Cape
Comorin; one ſide of this peninſula forms the
coaſt of Malabar, the other that of Coromandel.
On the Malabar ſide, between the chain of
mountains and the ſea, the ſeaſon of ſummer is
from September to April; and, during theſe
months, the ſky is ſerene, and no rain falls.
But, on the Coromandel coaſt, which lies on the
other ſide of the mountains, this very period is
their winter, and the rains fall abundantly.
This reverſe of ſummer and winter happens in
ſome places no farther diſtant than 20 leagues;
ſo that, by croſſing the mountains, a man has it
in his power to change ſeaſons. The ſame thing,
it is ſaid, takes place at Cape Razalgat in Arabia,
and even in Jamaica, which is divided from eaſt
to weſt by a chain of mountains; on the ſouth
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0195400701:275"/>
ſide of theſe mountains, the plantations enjoy
the warmth of ſummer, while thoſe on the north
ſuffer all the rigours of winter. Peru, which is
ſituated under the line, and extends about 1000
leagues towards the ſouth, is divided into three
long and narrow portions, called by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
<hi>Lanos, Sierras,</hi> and <hi>Andes.</hi> The Lanos,
which are the plains, extend along the coaſt of
the South Sea; the Sierras are hills interſperſed
with vallies; and the Andes are the famous Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliers,
the higheſt mountains in the world. The
Lanos are about 10 leagues broad; the Sierras,
in many places, 20 leagues; and the Andes
nearly the ſame, though ſome parts of them are
more, and others leſs broad. The breadth of
theſe diviſions is from eaſt to weſt, and their
length from ſouth to north. This part of the
world exhibits the following remarkable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances:
1<hi>ſt,</hi> Along the whole coaſt of the
Lanos, a ſouth-weſt wind almoſt conſtantly
blows, which is contrary to the ordinary direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the wind in the Torrid Zone. 2<hi>d,</hi> In
the Lanos, it never rains or thunders, though
they have plentiful dews. 3<hi>d,</hi> It rains almoſt
continually in the Andes. 4<hi>th,</hi> In the Sierras,
which lie between the Lanos and the Andes, it
rains from September to April.</p>
               <p>It was long thought, that all high mountains
run from weſt to eaſt, till the contrary direction
was diſcovered in America. But M. Bourguet
was the firſt who remarked the ſurpriſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0195400701:276"/>
in the ſtructure of theſe great maſſes.
After paſſing the Alps thirty times in fourteen
different places, the Apennines twice, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſeveral tours in the neighbourhood of theſe
mountains, and of Mount Jura, he found, that
the contours of all mountains have a near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
to the works in regular fortifications.
When the direction of a mountain is from weſt
to eaſt, all its projections, or advances, ſtretch
to the ſouth and north. This amazing regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is ſo remarkable in the vallies, that one is
apt to imagine that he is walking in a covered
way. If, for example, a man travels in a val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
from north to ſouth, he perceives that the
mountain which lies to the right hand makes
projections to the eaſt, and that the projections
of the oppoſite mountain regard the weſt, in
ſuch a manner, that the prominent and concave
angles, on each ſide, alternately correſpond with
one another. When the vallies are large, the
angles of the mountains are leſs acute, becauſe
they are more diſtant from each other, and the
declivity is not ſo rapid or ſteep. Theſe angles
are not perceptible in plains, excepting when we
ſtation ourſelves on the banks of the rivers,
which generally occupy the middle of them,
and whoſe natural windings correſpond to the
moſt advanced angles or projections of the
mountains. It is aſtoniſhing that ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
fact ſhould have remained ſo long unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed;
for, it is apparent, that, in vallies lined
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0195400701:277"/>
with oppoſite mountains, when the declivity of
one of the mountains is leſs rapid than that of
the other, the courſe of the rivers is not in the
middle, but neareſt to the ſteepeſt mountain<note n="*" place="bottom">See Lettres Philoſophiques fur la Formation des Sels, p. 181. and 200</note>.</p>
               <p>Theſe general obſervations might be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a multitude of facts. The moutains of
Switzerland, for example, are ſteeper on the
ſouth ſide than on the north, and on the weſt
ſide than on the eaſt. This appearance is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
in Mount Gemmi, Mount Briſa, and in
almoſt all the other mountains in this country,
the higheſt of which are thoſe which ſeparate
Valleſia, and the Griſons of Savoy, from Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont
and Tirol. Theſe countries are, indeed,
only a continuation of the ſame mountains, the
chain of which extends to the Mediterranean;
and the Pyrennees are only a continuation of
that vaſt mountain, which commences in Upper
Valleſia, whoſe branches ſtretch far to the weſt
and ſouth, and preſerve, throughout that whole
extent, a great height; but, on the north and
eaſt ſides, they gradually ſink into plains, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in thoſe great countries which are traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the Rhine and Danube before they finiſh
their courſe, while the Rhone deſcends with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
to the ſouth, and empties itſelf in the
Mediterranean. The ſame obſervation is exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified
in the mountains of England and of
Norway. But the moſt perfect example is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0195400701:278"/>
by the mountains of Chili and Peru.
The Cordeliers are exceedingly ſteep on the
weſt ſide; but they have a gradual declivity to
the eaſt, and terminate in vaſt plains, that are
watered by the greateſt rivers in the world<note n="*" place="bottom">See Phil. Tranſ. Abridg. vol. 6. part 6. p. 158.</note>.</p>
               <p>M. Bourguet, to whom we are indebted for
the diſcovery of the correſpondence between
the angles of mountains, calls this diſcovery <hi>the
Key to the Theory of the Earth.</hi> However, he
appears not to have perceived its whole impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
for, in his treatiſe on this ſubject, he
gives only the ſkeleton of an hypothetical ſyſtem,
in which moſt of his concluſions are either falſe
or uncertain. The theory that we have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
reſts upon four principal facts, the truth of
which, after examining the proofs that ſupport
them, cannot admit of a doubt: The <hi>firſt</hi> is,
That the earth, to very conſiderable depths, is
every where compoſed of parallel ſtrata of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
matters, which were formerly in a fluid
or ſoft ſtate: The <hi>ſecond,</hi> That the ſea has, for
many ages, covered the whole earth which we
now inhabit: The <hi>third,</hi> That the tides, and
other motions of the waters, produce inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the bottom of the ſea: And the <hi>fourth,</hi>
That the figure, and correſponding direction of
mountains, have originated from currents in the
ocean.</p>
               <p>After peruſing the proofs contained in the
ſubſequent articles, the reader will be enabled to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0195400701:279"/>
determine whether I am right in maintaining,
that theſe facts, when firmly eſtabliſhed, will
likewiſe aſcertain the genuine theory of the
earth. What has been remarked concerning the
formation of mountains needs no farther expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
But, as it may be objected, that I have
not accounted for the formation of peaks, or
pointed mountains, nor for ſome other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
facts, I ſhall add ſuch obſervations as have
occurred upon this ſubject.</p>
               <p>I have endeavoured to form a diſtinct and
general idea of the manner in which the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
compoſing this earth are arranged, and
have reduced the whole to two claſſes. The
<hi>firſt</hi> includes all the matters that are diſpoſed in
horizontal, or regularly inclined beds or ſtrata;
and the <hi>ſecond</hi> comprehends all thoſe matters
which appear in detached maſſes, in ridges, or
in veins, either perpendicular, or irregularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.
In the <hi>firſt</hi> claſs I rank ſands, clays,
granites, flints, and free-ſtones in large maſſes,
pit-coal, ſlates, and likewiſe marles, chalk, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinable
ſtones, marbles, &amp;c. In the <hi>ſecond,</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
metals, minerals, cryſtals, precious ſtones,
and flints in detached and ſmall maſſes. Under
theſe two claſſes, all the known materials of the
earth are comprehended. Thoſe of the firſt
claſs owe their origin to ſediments tranſported
and depoſited by the waters of the ſea, and ought
to be diſtinguiſhed into thoſe that are calcinable
by the application of fire, and thoſe that melt,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0195400701:280"/>
and are convertible into glaſs. The matters
comprehended under the ſecond claſs are all
vitrifiable, with the exception of thoſe called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable,
or which totally conſume in the fire.</p>
               <p>There are, in the firſt claſs, two diſtinct ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of ſand; the one, which abounds more
than any other matter in the globe, is vitrifiable,
or rather conſiſts of fragments of real glaſs:
The other, which is leſs in quantity, is calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and ought to be regarded as the duſt of
ſtone, and as differing from gravel only by the
groſſneſs of its grains. In general, vitrifiable
ſand lies in beds; but they are frequently inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by maſſes of free-ſtone, of granite, and
of flint; and ſometimes theſe ſubſtances appear
in banks of a conſiderable extent.</p>
               <p>Sea-ſhells are ſeldom found in vitrifiable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
and even thoſe which appear in them are
not diſpoſed in beds, but ſcattered, as it were,
by chance: I never, for example, found any in
free-ſtone. This ſtone, which abounds in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
places, is nothing but ſand united by a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It never appears but in countries where
vitrifiable ſand is frequent; and the quarries of
it are generally in pointed hills, in ſandy lands,
or in interrupted eminences. Theſe quarries
may be wrought on all ſides; and, when they
appear in large beds, they are more diſtant from
each other than thoſe of marble or calcinable
ſtones. Blocks of free-ſtone may be cut of all
dimenſions; and, though it be difficult to work,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0195400701:281"/>
its hardneſs is inconſiderable; for it is eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to ſand by friction, excepting the black
points or nails ſometimes found in it, which are
ſo hard as to reſiſt the beſt files. Common rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
which I conſider as a ſpecies of granite,
is vitrifiable, and of a ſimilar nature with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone;
it is only harder, and more firmly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.
It has likewiſe ſeveral denſe points,
which cut the ſhoes of travellers on mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
grounds. It alſo contains a great number
of talky ſpangles; and the whole is ſo hard as
not to be worked without great labour.</p>
               <p>After narrowly examining theſe hard points
found in free-ſtone and granite, I diſcovered that
they conſiſt of metallic matter, which has been
melted and calcined by a ſtrong fire, and that
they have a perfect reſemblance to certain ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
thrown out of volcano's, of which I have
ſeen vaſt quantities in Italy. They are called
by the inhabitants <hi>Schiarri.</hi> They are black
heavy maſſes, upon which neither fire, water,
nor the file, can make any impreſſion. It is
very different from lava, the latter being a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of glaſs; but the former ſeems to partake
more of metal than of glaſs. The points in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
and granite have a great reſemblance to
this matter, whcih is a farther proof that thoſe
ſubſtances have formerly been liquified by fire.</p>
               <p>On the tops of ſome high mountains, blocks
of granite appear in great quantities. Their
poſitions are ſo irregular, that they ſeem to have
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0195400701:282"/>
been thrown together by accident; and we
would be apt to imagine that they had tumbled
down from ſome neighbouring height, if the
places where they are found were not higher
than any neighbouring ground. But their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifiable
nature, and their angular and ſquare
figures, like thoſe of free-ſtone rocks, diſcover
theſe ſubſtances to have an uncommon origin.
Thus, in large ſtrata of vitrifiable ſand, we find
blocks of free-ſtone and granite, the figure and
ſituation of which follow not exactly the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal
poſition of ſtrata. The rains have gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
brought down from the hills and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the ſand with which theſe blocks were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
covered, by furrowing and cutting into
thoſe intervals that appear between the yokes or
nuclei in free-ſtone, in the ſame manner as the
hills of Fountainbleau are interſected. Every
point of a hill reſembles a nucleus in free-ſtone
quarries, and all the intervals have been ſcooped
out by the rains, and the ſand they originally
contained has been carried down to the vallies.
In the ſame manner, the angular blocks of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
on the tops of high mountains were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
covered and ſurrounded with vitrifiable
ſand, which being gradually carried off by the
rains, left the blocks in the poſition in which
they happened to be formed. Theſe blocks are
generally pointed at the top, and augment in
thickneſs towards their baſes; one block often
reſts upon another, that upon a third, and ſo on,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0195400701:283"/>
leaving irregular intervals between them: And
as, in the courſe of time, the ſand which cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the blocks, and filled the intervals, was waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down by the rains, there would nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
on the tops of high mountains but pointed
piles of irregular blocks; and hence the origin
of peaks, or mountains ending in ſharp points.</p>
               <p>For, let it be ſuppoſed, as may eaſily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the ſea-bodies found in the Alps, that
this chain of mountains was formerly covered
by the ocean, and that a thick bed of vitrifiable
ſand was depoſited upon their tops, which redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the whole chain to a level country. This
bed of ſand would neceſſary give riſe to large
blocks of granite, of free-ſtone, of flint, and of
other bodies, whoſe conſiſtence and figure origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
from ſand, nearly in the ſame manner as
ſalts cryſtallize. Theſe blocks, after the ſand
which covered them, and filled their interſtices,
was carried down to the plains by rains, torrents,
&amp;c. would maintain their original ſtations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
bare on the tops of the mountains, and
conſtitute all thoſe peaks or pointed eminences
ſo frequently to be met with. To the ſame
origin muſt be aſcribed thoſe high detached rocks
which are found in China and other countries,
as in Ireland, where they are diſtinguiſhed by
the name of <hi>Devil's ſtones,</hi> and the formation of
which, as well as of peaked mountains, has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
appeared ſo difficult to explain. The
explication, however, which I have given, is ſo
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0195400701:284"/>
natural, that it generally occurs to every perſon
who examines theſe objects; and, on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
I will ſet down a paſſage from father Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.
'From Yanchuin-yen we arrived at Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tcheou;
upon the road we remarked a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
phaenomenon, namely, rocks of a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
height, reſembling ſquare towers, in the
midſt of vaſt plains. I cannot account for this
appearance, unleſs I be allowed to ſuppoſe theſe
rocks to have formerly conſtituted a part of
mountains, and that the earth, ſand, and other
looſe parts, had been gradually waſhed away
by the rains, and left the rocks bare on all ſides.
What fortifies this conjecture is, that we ſaw
ſome of them, the baſes of which were ſtill
ſurrounded with earth to a conſiderable
heighth<note n="*" place="bottom">See letters edifiantes, tome 1. p. 135.</note>.'</p>
               <p>The tops of the higheſt mountains, often for
200 or 300 fathoms, conſiſt of rocks of granite,
free-ſtone, and other hard and vitrifiable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances:
Below this, we frequently meet with
quarries of marble, or hard calcinable ſtone, full
of foſſil ſhells; as may be ſeen at the great
Chartreuſe in Dauphiny, and upon Mount Cenis;
where the ſtones and marbles that contain ſhells
are ſituated ſome hundreds of fathoms below the
points or peaks of high mountains, though theſe
beds of ſtone and marble be more than 1000
fathoms above the level of the ſea. Thus thoſe
mountains that have peaks or points, generally
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0195400701:285"/>
conſiſt of vitrifiable rocks; and thoſe, the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of which are flat, contain, for the moſt part,
marbles, and hard ſtones full of ſea-bodies. The
ſame remark holds with regard to hills; for
thoſe compoſed of granite or free-ſtone, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
interſected with points, eminences, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities,
and ſmall vallies. But thoſe compoſed
of calcinable ſtone, are nearly of an equal height,
and are only interrupted by larger and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
vallies, with correſponding angles; and
they are crowned with rocks, uniform and level
in their poſition.</p>
               <p>Though theſe two ſpecies of mountains ſeem
to be very different, their figures have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the ſame cauſe, as has already been
ſhown: Only, it may be remarked, that the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinable
ſtones have ſuffered no change ſince the
original formation of the horizontal ſtrata. But
the vitrifiable ſands may have been changed and
interrupted by the ſubſequent production of
rocks and angular blocks that takes place in ſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds.
Both ſpecies have fiſſures; thoſe in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinable
rocks are almoſt always perpendicular;
but thoſe of granite and free-ſtone are ſomewhat
more irregular in their direction. It is in theſe
fiſſures that metals, minerals, cryſtals, ſulphur,
and all the ſubſtances of our ſecond claſs, are
found. Below the fiſſures, the waters aſſemble,
penetrate the earth, and give riſe to the veins of
water that every where appear under the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>

               <p>I HAVE already remarked, that, in general,
the greateſt mountains occupy the middle of
continents; that thoſe of a ſmaller kind divide
iſlands, peninſula's, and promontories; that, in
the Old Continent, the direction of the greateſt
chains of mountains is from weſt to eaſt; and
that thoſe which run to the north or ſouth, are
only branches of the principal chains. It will
appear, on examination, that the greateſt rivers
have the ſame direction, and few of them follow
the courſe of the branches of mountains. To
be convinced of this fact, we have only to run
our eye over a common globe; and, beginning
with Spain, we ſhall find that the Vigo, the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0195400701:287"/>
Douro, the Tagus, and the Guadiana, run from
eaſt to weſt, and the Ebro from weſt to eaſt; and
that there is not a river of any conſideration
which runs from ſouth to north, or from north
to ſouth, although Spain be almoſt entirely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed
by the ſea on the northern and ſouthern
parts. This remark concerning the rivers of
Spain demonſtrates, that the direction of the
mountains is from weſt to eaſt; that the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
provinces near the Straits are more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
than the coaſts of Portugal; that, in the
northern parts, the mountains of Galicia, the
Aſturias, &amp;c. are only a continuation of the
Pyrennees; and that this elevation of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
both in the ſouth and north, is the cauſe
which prevents the rivers from running to the
ſea in theſe directions.</p>
               <p>In examining the map of France, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that the Rhone is the only river which
runs from north to ſouth; and even near one
half of its courſe, from the mountains to Lyons,
is from eaſt to weſt: But the direction of all the
great rivers, as the Loire, the Charente, the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne,
and even the Seine, is from eaſt to weſt.</p>
               <p>The ſame obſervation holds with regard to
Germany. The Rhine, like the Rhone, has the
greateſt part of its courſe from ſouth to north:
But the other large rivers, as the Danube, the
Drave, and all the rivers which fall into them,
run from weſt to eaſt, and empty themſelves in
the Black Sea.</p>

The Black Sea, which ſhould rather be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as a large lake, is, from eaſt to weſt, near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
three times as long as from ſouth to north;
and conſequently its direction is ſimilar to that
of the rivers. The ſame remark is applicable
to the Mediterranean, which is nearly ſix times
longer from eaſt to weſt than from north to
ſouth.</p>
               <p>The Caſpian, it muſt be acknowledged, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the chart made by order of the Czar
Peter I. extends more from north to ſouth, than
from eaſt to weſt. But the antient charts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
it as nearly round, or rather as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
more from eaſt to weſt than in the
oppoſite direction. If, however, the lake Aral
be conſidered as a part of the Caſpian, from
which it is ſeparated only by a ſandy plain, the
greateſt extent of this ſea will ſtill be from weſt
to eaſt.</p>
               <p>The courſe of the Euphrates, of the Perſic
gulf, and of almoſt all the rivers of China, is
likewiſe from weſt to eaſt. The rivers of the
interior parts of Africa obſerve the ſame direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
running either from weſt to eaſt, or from
eaſt to weſt. The Nile, and the rivers of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,
are the only ones that run from ſouth to
north. There are, it is true, large rivers in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,
as the Don, the Wolga, &amp;c. which partly
run from north to ſouth: But they only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
this direction in order to fall into the Black
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0195400701:289"/>
and Caſpian ſeas, which are lakes in the interior
parts of the country.</p>
               <p>We may, therefore, lay it down as a fact,
that, in general, the rivers and mediterranean
waters of Europe, Aſia, and Africa, run or
ſtretch more from eaſt to weſt than from north
to ſouth. This is a natural conſequence of the
parallel direction of the different chains of
mountains. Beſides, the whole continent of
Europe and of Aſia is broader from eaſt to weſt
than from north to ſouth: For the direction of
mountains may be conſidered in two points of
view; in a long and narrow continent, like that
of South America, which contains only one
principal chain of mountains, extending from
ſouth to north, the rivers, not being reſtrained
by any parallel chain, muſt run in channels per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
to the range of theſe mountains, that
is, either from eaſt to weſt, or from weſt to
eaſt; and this, in fact, is the direction of all the
great rivers in America. But though, both in
the Old and New Continent, the great rivers
run in the ſame direction, this effect is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by different cauſes. The rivers, in the Old
Continent, run from eaſt to weſt, becauſe they
are confined by many parallel chains of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
that ſtretch from weſt to eaſt; but thoſe
of America obſerve the ſame direction, becauſe
there is only one cahin of mountains ſtretching
from ſouth to north.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0195400701:290"/>
The rivers generally occupy the middle of
the vallies, or the loweſt ground between two
oppoſite hills: If the two hills have nearly an
equal declivity, the river runs nearly in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
between them, whether the intermediate
valley be broad or narrow. If, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the declivity of one of the hills be greater
than that of the other, the river will not occupy
the middle of the valley, but will approach to
the ſteepeſt hill, in proportion to the ſuperiority
of its declivity. In this caſe, the middle of the
valley is not the loweſt ground between the two
hills, but lies much nearer the ſteepeſt of them;
and conſequently the river muſt occupy this
ſpace. This obſervation holds univerſally where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the difference in declivity is any ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable;
and the rivers never recede from the
ſteepeſt hills, unleſs, in their courſe, they meet
with other hills of equal declivity. In proceſs
of time, however, the declivity of the ſteepeſt
hill is diminiſhed by the rains, the melting of
ſnow, &amp;c. The ſteeper any hill is, it loſes great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
quantities of earth, ſand, and gravel, by the
operation of rains, and theſe ſubſtances are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
down into the plain with a proportionably
greater rapidity, and, of courſe, force the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to change its channel, or, in other words, to
retire into a lower part of the valley. To this
it may be added, that, as all rivers occaſionally
ſwell, and overflow their banks, they carry off
mud and ſand, which they depoſite in different
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0195400701:291"/>
parts of the valley; and, as ſand and gravel are
often accumulated in the channels themſelves,
theſe circumſtances make the waters overflow
and alter the direction of their courſe. Nothing,
accordingly, is more common, than to find in
vallies many old channels in which the river has
formerly run, eſpecially when it is rapid, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to frequent inundations, and carries down
great quantities of ſand and mud.</p>
               <p>In plains, and extenſive valleys, watered by
large rivers, the channels of the rivers are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the loweſt parts: But the ſurface of the
water in the river is ſometimes higher than the
adjacent ground. When a river, for inſtance,
begins to overflow, it ſoon covers a conſiderable
part of the plain; but the banks remain longeſt
uncovered by the water. This plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
the banks to be higher than the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
ground; and from the banks, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
part of the plain, there is a ſmall declivity
or ſlope. When, therefore, the water riſes to
the margin of the banks, it muſt be higher than
the plain. This elevation of the ground on the
banks of rivers is occaſioned by mud and
ſand being depoſited in the time of inundations.
The water, during great ſwells, is always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
foul and muddy: When it begins to
overflow, it runs ſlowly over the banks, and, by
depoſiting the mud and ſand, it gradually puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
as it advances into the plain: Thus, all the
mud, and other ſubſtances, that are not carried
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0195400701:292"/>
down by the current, are depoſited upon the
banks, and gradually elevate them above the
reſt of the plain.</p>
               <p>Rivers are always wideſt at their mouths, and
turn gradually narrower towards their ſources:
But it is more worthy of remark, that, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
parts of a country, and at great diſtances
from the ſea, their courſe is ſtraight, and the
frequency of their windings increaſes propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
as they approach to their termination.
I have been informed by M. Fabry, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
many journeys in the weſtern parts of
North America, that travellers, and even the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages,
form pretty accurate computations of
their diſtance from the ſea, by obſerving the
courſes of the rivers. If a river ran ſtraight for
15 or 20 leagues, they knew themſelves to be a
great way from the coaſt; but, if the ſinuoſities
were frequent, they concluded that the ſea was
not very diſtant. M. Fabry, when travelling
through unknown and uninhabited regions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
much advantage from this obſervation.
Near the ſides of great rivers, the regorging of
the water is likewiſe leſs apparent the farther
from the ſea, which furniſhes another medium
of judging concerning the diſtance: And, as the
ſinuoſities multiply the nearer rivers approach
to their mouths, it is not ſurpriſing that ſome of
them ſhould yield to the preſſure of the water,
and give riſe to ſeveral branches, or diviſions,
before they reach the ſea.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0195400701:293"/>
The motion of the water in rivers is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the repreſentation given of it by
mathematicians. The ſurface, taken from bank
to bank, is not level; but the middle of the
ſtream is either higher or lower, according to
circumſtances, than the water at the ſides. When
a river ſwells ſuddenly by the melting of ſnow,
or any other cauſe, its rapidity increaſes; and, if
its courſe be ſtraight, the middle of the ſtream,
where the current is greateſt, riſes and forms a
ſenſible convexity. This elevation is ſometimes
very conſiderable. M. Hupeau, who meaſured
this difference of level between the ſides and
the ſtream of the Aveiron, found it to be three
feet. This effect muſt always be produced
when the rapidity of the current is great; for
the quickneſs of the motion, by diminiſhing, or
partly preventing the action of gravity, allows
not to the water, in the middle of the ſtream,
time ſufficient to bring it to a level with that on
the ſides, and, therefore, it remains higher. On
the other hand, near the mouths, though the
current be very rapid, the water near the ſides
is commonly more elevated than that of the
middle: The river, in this ſituation, has a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave
form, the loweſt point of which is the
middle of the ſtream. This always happens as
far as the influence of the tides is perceptible,
which, in large rivers, extends ſometimes to 100
or 200 leagues from the ſea. It is likewiſe a
fact well known, that the ſtreams of rivers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0195400701:294"/>
their motion a conſiderable way through
the waters of the ſea. In this caſe, the water of
the river has two oppoſite motions. The middle,
or current, precipitates itſelf towards the ſea;
but the action of the tide produces a counter
current, or regorging, which elevates the water
on the ſides, while that in the middle deſcends;
and, as all the water muſt be carried down by
the current, that on the ſides conſtantly deſcends
towards the middle of the ſtream, with a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
proportioned to the elevation it receives
from the regorging of the tide.</p>
               <p>There are two ſpecies of regorging, or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
up, in rivers: The firſt is that juſt now
deſcribed, and is occaſioned by the action of the
ride, which not only oppoſes the natural deſcent
of the water, but even communicates to it a
contrary motion or current: The other is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by an inactive cauſe, as a projection of
the land, an iſland, &amp;c. Though this kind of
regorging gives not riſe to any extraordinary
counter current, it often ſenſibly retards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of ſmall boats, and produces what is called
<hi>dead water,</hi> which obſerves not the natural courſe
of the river, but turns about in ſuch a manner
as greatly obſtructs the progreſs of veſſels. Theſe
dead waters are ſenſibly felt in paſſing through
the arches of a bridge, eſpecially if the river be
rapid. The celerity with which water runs,
when the height or preſſure is the ſame, increaſes
in proportion as the diameter of the canal,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0195400701:295"/>
through which it paſſes, is diminiſhed. The ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity
of a river, therefore, in paſſing through a
bridge, increaſes in the inverſe proportion of the
width of the whole arches, to the total width of
the river. This increaſe of celerity, in paſſing
through the arch of a bridge, is ſo conſiderable,
that it puſhes the water from the ſtream towards
the banks, from which it is reflected, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
forms violent eddies or whirlpools. In
paſſing under the bridge of St Eſprit, the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are obliged ſcrupulouſly to keep the ſtream,
even after leaving the bridge; for, if they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the boat to decline either to the right or
left, it would be driven with violence againſt
the banks, or, at leaſt, would be forced into the
whirling or dead waters, from which they would
find ſome difficulty of eſcaping. When the
eddy is conſiderable, it forms a ſmall gulf with
a cylindrical void in the middle of it, round
which the water turns with rapidity. This cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindrical
cavity is an effect of the centrifugal
force, which makes the water endeavour to fly
off from the center of the whirlpool.</p>
               <p>When a great ſwell of the river is about to
happen, the water-men perceive a particular
motion, which they call a <hi>moving at the bottom</hi>;
that is, when the water at the bottom moves with
an unuſual velocity, which, according to them,
always indicates the approach of a ſudden ſwell.
The motion and weight of the ſuperior waters,
though not yet arrived, fail not to act upon the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0195400701:296"/>
waters in the inferior parts of the river, and to
communicate motion to them: For a river, in
ſome reſpects, muſt be conſidered as a column
of water contained in a tube, and its channel as a
long canal, in which every motion muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
from one end of it to the other. Now,
independent of the motion of the ſuperior wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
their weight alone may increaſe the celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the river, and perhaps make it move quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
at the bottom; for, it is well known, that,
when ſeveral boats are all at once puſhed into a
river, they increaſe the motion of the water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and retard that of the ſuperior water.</p>
               <p>The celerity of running waters is not in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
proportion to the declivity of their channels.
A river with a uniform declivity, and double to
that of another, ought not, it would appear, to
run with more than a double celerity: But its
celerity is much more quick, being ſometimes
triple, ſometimes quadruple, &amp;c. The celerity
depeends more upon the quantity of water, and
the weight of the ſuperior waters, than upon
the degree of deſcent. In digging the bed of a
river or drain, it is unneceſſary to make the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
uniform through its whole extent. A
quick motion is more eaſily produced by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the declivity much greater at the ſource
then at the mouth, where, like the beds of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
rivers, it is almoſt imperceptible, and yet
they preſerve their celerity, which is more or
leſs, according to the quantity they contain; for,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0195400701:297"/>
in great rivers, even where the ground is level,
the water ſtill runs, not only with the velocity
originally acquired, but with the accumulated
velocity produced by the action and weight of
the ſuperior waters<note n="*" place="bottom">By not attending to theſe circumſtances, M. Khun was led falſely to affirm, that the ſource of the Danube was at leaſt two German miles higher than its mouth; that the Mediterranean is 6¾ German miles lower than the ſources of the Nile; that the Atlantic ocean is half a mile lower than the Mediterranean, &amp;c.</note>. To make this matter ſtill
more plain, let us ſuppoſe the Seine from Pont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf
to Pont-royal to be perfectly level, and to
be ten feet deep; let us alſo ſuppoſe the bed of
the river below Pont-royal and above Pont-neuf,
to be ſuddenly dried up; the waters, in this caſe,
would run both up and down the channel, till
their equilibrium was perfectly reſtored. This
effect is produced entirely by the weight of the
water, which never allows it to remain at reſt
till its particles are equally preſſed on all ſides,
and its ſurface reduced to a perfect level. The
weight of water, therefore, contributes greatly
to increaſe the celerity of its motion. This is
the reaſon why the greateſt celerity in a current
of water is neither at the bottom nor at the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
but nearly in the middle, which is preſſed
both by the column above, and by the reaction
from the bottom. But, what is ſtill more, when
a river acquires a great celerity, it will not only
preſerve it, though running through a level
country, but even ſurmount heights, without
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0195400701:298"/>
ſpreading much to a ſide, or, at leaſt, without
producing an inundation of any moment.</p>
               <p>One would be apt to imagine, that bridges,
and other obſtacles erected in rivers, would create
a conſiderable diminution of celerity in their
whole courſe. But the difference is very ſmall.
The water, upon meeting with any obſtacle, riſes,
in order to ſurmount it; and the increaſe of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity
communicated by its fall, nearly compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſates
the retardation occaſioned by the obſtacle.
Thus, ſinuoſities, projections from the land, and
iſlands, create but a ſmall variation on the total
celerity of a river's courſe. The moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
alterations are produced by the greater or
leſſer quantities of water; when the quantity is
ſmall, a river runs ſlow, when great, it runs with
rapidity.</p>
               <p>If rivers were always equally full, to enlarge
their channels would be the beſt method of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing
their rapidity, and to contain them
within their banks. But, as almoſt all rivers
riſe and fall, it is more neceſſary, for this latter
purpoſe, to narrow their channels; for ſmall
waters, with large channels, generally ſcoop
out winding beds in the middle; and, when they
ſwell, they follow the direction of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
beds, and, by ſtriking with violence againſt
the banks, often do much injury to mills and
other works. Theſe bad effects might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
by digging gulfs in the earth at conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
diſtances. To accompliſh this, a part of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0195400701:299"/>
one of the banks ſhould be cut through, and the
earth removed for a conſiderable ſpace. Theſe
ſmall gulfs ſhould be made in the obtuſe angles
of the river; for the water, in turning, would
run into them; and, of courſe, its celerity would
be diminiſhed. This method might be uſeful in
preventing the fall of bridges in places where
ſufficient barriers cannot be erected to reſiſt the
weight of the water.</p>
               <p>The manner in which inundations are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
merits particular attention. When a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſwells, its celerity uniformly increaſes, till
it begins to overflow the banks: From that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
its rapidity is checked, which is the reaſon
why inundations always continue ſeveral days;
for, though the quantity of water ſhould be
diminiſhed after the commencement of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation,
it would, notwithſtanding, continue
to overflow; becauſe this circumſtance depends
more on the celerity than on the quantity of
water. If it were otherwiſe, rivers would often
overflow their banks for an hour or two, and
then retire to their channels, which never does
happen. An inundation, on the contrary, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
laſts ſome days, ſuppoſing the rains have
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and leſs water runs in the river; becauſe
the overflowing of waters diminiſhes their ecle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and, conſequently, although the ſame
quantity of water arrives not in the ſame time
as formerly, the effect is the ſame as if a larger
quantity had been brought down. It may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0195400701:300"/>
here be remarked, that, if a high wind
blows contrary to the current of the river, the
inundation will be increaſed by this occaſional
cauſe, which diminiſhes the celerity of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
but, if the wind blows in the direction of
the current, the inundation will be leſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
more quickly.</p>
               <p>'The inundation of the Nile,' ſays M. Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
'has long been a ſubject of diſcuſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the learned. Moſt of them have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it as a ſingular and wonderful phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
though nothing be more natural or more
common; for it takes place in every country,
as well as in Egypt. The inundation of the
Nile is occaſioned by the rains which fall in
Aethiopia and Abyſſinia; but the north wind
may be regarded as the principal cauſe of it:
1. Becauſe the north wind drives the clouds
that contain this rain into Abyſſinia: 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it prevents the water from running out
of the mouths of the river in any great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
by damming up the ſtream. The great
effect of this wind may be remarked every
ſeaſon; for, when it changes from north, the
Nile loſes more water in one day than in four.'</p>
               <p>Inundations are generally greateſt in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
parts of rivers; becauſe, as formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
the velocity of a river uniformly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes
till it empties itſelf in the ocean. Father
Coſtelli, a ſenſible writer on this ſubject, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks,
that the banks, raiſed for the purpoſe of

keeping the Po from overflowing, gradually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
in height, as the river approaches to the
ſea; that, at Ferrara, which is 60 or 70 miles
from the mouth of the river, the banks are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
20 feet above the ordinary level of the
water; but that, at 10 or 12 miles from the
ſea, though the channel be equally narrow as
at Ferrara, they are not above 12 feet<note n="*" place="bottom">See Racolta d'autori che trattano del moto dell' acque, vel. 1. p. 123.</note>.</p>
               <p>In fine, the theory of running waters is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to many difficulties. It is not eaſy to give
general rules that will apply to every particular

to ſpeculation: It is not enough that we know
the common effects of rivers in general; but, if
we would reaſon juſtly, and give ſtability to
our operations, we ought to ſtudy the peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of particular rivers in which we have an

generally new, a greater collection is neceſſary;
and perhaps we ſhall in time acquire a diſtinct
knowledge of this ſubject, and be enabled to

rivers in ſuch a manner as will prevent the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction

               <p>In order to compute the quantity of water
diſcharged into the ſea by all the rivers, we ſhall
ſuppoſe, which is nearly the truth, that one half
of the earth's ſurface is ſea, and the other half
dry land: We ſhall likewiſe ſuppoſe the mean
depth of the ſea to be about 230 fathoms. The
total ſurface of the earth is 170981012 ſquare
miles, and that of the ſea is 85490506 ſquare
miles, which being multiplied by 1-fourth,
the depth of the ſea, gives 21372626 cubic
miles for the quantity of water contained
in the whole ocean. Now, to compute the
quantity diſcharged into the ocean by the
rivers, let us take a river, the velocity and
quantity of whoſe waters are known; the Po,
for example, which paſſes through Lombardy,
and waters a country of 380 miles in length.
According to Riccioli, the breadth of the Po, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it divides into branches, is 100 perches of
Boulogne, or 1000 feet; and its depth is 10
feet; and it runs at the rate of 4 miles in an
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0195400701:305"/>
hour: Conſequently, the Po diſcharges into the
ſea 200,000 cubical perches of water in an hour,
or 4,800,000 in a day. But a cubic mile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
125,000,000 cubic perches; of courſe, it
will require 26 days to diſcharge into the ſea a
cubic mile of water. It only remains to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the proportion that the Po bears to all the
rivers of the earth taken together, which cannot
be done exactly. But, to approach nearly to the
truth, let us ſuppoſe that the quantity of water
which the ſea receives from the great rivers in
every country, is proportioned to the extent of
the ſurfaces of theſe countries; and, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the country watered by the Po, and by
the rivers which fall into it, is to the total ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the dry land as the Po is to all the rivers
of the earth. Now, by the moſt exact charts,
it appears, that the Po, from its origin to its
mouth, traverſes a country of 380 miles in
length; and the rivers which fall into it on each
ſide ariſe from ſources which are about 60 miles
diſtant from the Po. Thus, the Po, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
it receives, water a country 380 miles long,
and 120 broad, which makes 45600 ſquare
miles. But the ſurface of the dry land is
85490506 ſquare miles; conſequently, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of water carried to the ſea by all the rivers
will be 1874 times greater than the quantity
diſcharged by the Po. But, as 26 rivers, equal
to the Po, furniſh a cubic mile of water each
day, it follows, that, in the ſpace of a year,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0195400701:306"/>
1874 rivers equal to the Po, will carry to the
ſea 26308 cubic miles of water; and that, in
812 years, all theſe rivers would diſcharge
21372626 cubic miles, which is a quantity equal
to what is contained in the ocean; of courſe, if
the ocean were empty, 812 years would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to fill it by the rivers<note n="*" place="bottom">See keil's examination of Burnet's theory, p. 126.</note>.</p>
               <p>It is a reſult of this calculation, that the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of water raiſed from the ſea by evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and tranſported upon land by the winds,
is from 20 to 21 inches in the year, or about ⅔
of a French line each day. This evaporation,
though tripled to make allowance for what falls
back into the ſea from the clouds, is very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.
Mr Halley<note n="†" place="bottom">See Phil. Tranſ. num. 192.</note> has clearly demonſtrated,
that the vapours tranſported from the ſea, and
diſcharged upon the land, are ſufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
all the rivers and lakes in the world.</p>
               <p>After the Nile, the Jordan is the largeſt river
in the Levant, or even in Barbary. It diſcharges
each day into the Dead Sea about 6,000,000 of
tons. All this water, and more, is carried off
by evaporation; for, according to Halley's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of 6914 tons evaporated from each ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
mile, the Dead Sea, which is 72 miles
long and 18 broad, muſt loſe, every day, by
evaporation, near 9,000,000 of tons; that is,
not only all the water it receives from the Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,
but from the ſmaller rivers which come
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0195400701:307"/>
from the mountains of Moab, and elſewhere.
Of courſe, this ſea has no occaſion to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with any other by ſubterraneous paſſages<note n="*" place="bottom">See Shaw's travels.</note>.</p>
               <p>The moſt rapid of all rivers are, the Tigris,
the Indus, the Danube, the Yrtis in Siberia, the
Malmiſtra in Cilicia, &amp;c.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Varenii Geog. p. 178.</note> But, as was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
remarked, the velocity of rivers depends
both on the declivity and the weight of water.
In examining the globe, we find, that the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube
has leſs declivity than the Po, the Rhine,
or the Rhone; for, the courſe of the Danube is
longer, and it falls into the Black Sea, which is
higher than the Mediterranean, and perhaps
than the ocean.</p>
               <p>Great rivers, in their courſe, are conſtantly
receiving ſmall ones into their channels. The
Danube, for example, receives more than 200
brooks and rivulets. But, if we reckon only
rivers of ſome conſideration, we will find, that
the Danube receives 30 or 31, the Wolga 32 or
33, the Don 5 or 6, the Nieper 19 or 20, the
Duine 11 or 12. The Hoanho, in Aſia, receives
34 or 35 rivers, the Jeniſca more than 60, the
Oby an equal number, the Amour about 40, the
Kian, or river of Nankin, 30, the Ganges more
than 20, the Euphrates 10 or 11, &amp;c. In Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
the Senegal receives more than 20 rivers;
the Nile receives none lower than 500 leagues
from its mouth, the laſt which falls into it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Moraba; and from this place to its
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0195400701:308"/>
ſource, it receives about 12 or 13. In America,
the Amazones receives more than 60 conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
rivers, St Laurence about 40, reckoning
thoſe which fall into the lakes, the Miſſiſippi
more than 40, the Plata above 50, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſurface of the earth, there are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
countries which ſeem to be points of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
marked out by nature for the diſtribution
of the waters. In Europe, one of theſe points
is Mont Saint-Godard, and its environs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
point is the country ſituated between the
provinces of Belozera and Wologda in Muſcovy,
from which many rivers deſcend, ſome into the
White Sea, ſome into the Black, and others into
the Caſpian. In Aſia there are ſeveral points of
partition, as the country of the Mogul Tartars,
ſome of whoſe rivers run into the ſea of Nova
Zembla, others into the gulf of Linchidolin,
others into the ſea of Corea, and others into that
of China; and the Leſſer Thibet, the rivers of
which run into the Chineſe ſea, into the gulf of
Bengal, the gulf of Cambaia, and the lake Aral.
The province of Quito, in America, diſcharges
its rivers into the ſouth and north ſeas, and into
the gulf of Mexico.</p>
               <p>There are, in the Old Continent, about 430
rivers which directly fall either into the Ocean,
or into the Mediterranean and Black Seas. But,
in the New Continent, we know of only 145
rivers that fall immediately into the ſea. In this
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0195400701:309"/>
number I have reckoned none that are not as
large as the river Somme in Picardy.</p>
               <p>All theſe rivers tranſport, from the countries
through which they paſs, into the ſea, great
quantities of mineral and ſaline particles. The
particles of ſalt, which diſſolve in water, are eaſily
carried down to the ſea. Several philoſophers, and
particularly Halley, have alledged, that the ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the ſea proceeds alone from the particles
of ſalt tranſported by the rivers: Others main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that this ſaltneſs was coeval with the ſea
itſelf, and that the ſalt was created to prevent
the waters from corrupting. But the agitation
of the ſea by the winds and the tides is, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
a cauſe equally powerful as the ſalt in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
it againſt putrifaction; for, when bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled
up, it corrupts in a few days. And Boyle
informs us of a navigator who was overtaken
with a calm which laſted 13 days, and who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
him, that the water became ſo putrid, that,
if the calm had continued much longer, the
whole crew would have periſhed<note n="*" place="bottom">See Boyle, vol. 3. p. 222.</note>. Sea-water is
alſo impregnated with a bituminous oil, which
renders it both unwholeſome, and diſagreeable
to the taſte. The quantity of ſalt in ſea-water
is about a fortieth part, and it is nearly of an
equal ſaltneſs at the ſurface and at the bottom,
under the Line and at the Cape of Good Hope;
though there are ſome particular places, as off
the Moſambique coaſt, where it is more ſalt than
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0195400701:310"/>
in others<note n="*" place="bottom">See Boyle, vol. 3. p 217.</note>. It is likewiſe ſaid to be leſs ſalt
within the Arctic circle: But this phaenomenon
may proceed from the immenſe quantities of
ſnow, and the large rivers which fall into theſe
ſeas, and from the proportional defect of evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>However this matter ſtands, I believe, that
the ſaltneſs of the ocean is not only occaſioned
by the many banks of ſalt at the bottom of the
ſea, and along the coaſts, but likewiſe by the
ſalts continually brought down by the rivers;
that Halley was right in his conjecture that
there was originally little or no ſalt in the ſea,
but that its ſaltneſs gradually augmented in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
as it was ſupplied by the rivers; that
the degree of ſaltneſs is perpetually increaſing;
and, conſequently, that, by computing the total
quantity of ſalt carried down by the rivers, we
might be enabled to diſcover the real age of the
world. Mr Boyle affirms, on the authority of
divers and pearl-fiſhers, that the water is colder
in proportion to its depth; and that, at great
depths, the cold becomes ſo exceſſive as to oblige
them to come up much ſooner than uſual. But
the weight of the water may be as much the
cauſe of their uneaſineſs as the intenſeneſs of the
cold, eſpecially when they deſcend 300 or 400
fathom. Divers, however, ſeldom go deeper
than 100 feet. The ſame author relates, that,
in a voyage to the Eaſt Indies, when they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0195400701:311"/>
at the 35th degree of ſouth latitude, they
ſounded to the depth of 400 fathoms, and when
the lead, which weighed about 30 pounds, was
drawn up, it had become as cold as ice. It is
likewiſe a common practice at ſea, to ſink the
bottles ſeveral fathoms, in order to cool their
wine; and, it is ſaid, that the deeper the bottles
are ſunk, the wine becomes the cooler.</p>
               <p>Theſe facts would lead us to imagine, that
the ſea-water was ſalter at the bottom than at
the ſurface. But they are oppoſed by facts of a
contrary nature: Experiments have been made
with veſſels which opened only at a certain depth,
and the water was not found to be ſalter than
that at the ſurface. There are even examples
of the water at the bottom being freſher than at
the ſurface: This phaenomenon is exhibited in
all thoſe places where ſprings ariſe from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the ſea, as near Goa, at Ormus, and in
the ſea of Naples, in which there are many
warm ſprings.</p>
               <p>In other places, ſulphurous ſprings and beds
of bitumen have been diſcovered at the bottom
of the ſea; and, upon land, there are numerous
ſprings of bitumen that run down into the ſea. At
Barbadoes, there is a fountain of bitumen which
runs from the rocks into the ſea. Bitumen and
ſalt, then, are the principal ingredients in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water.
But it is blended with many other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
for its taſte differs conſiderably in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
parts of the ocean: Beſides, agitation and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0195400701:312"/>
the heat of the ſun change the natural taſte of
ſea-water, and the different colours of different
ſeas, and even of the ſame ſea at different times,
prove it to be mixed with many heterogeneous
bodies, which are detached either from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
or carried down by the rivers.</p>
               <p>Moſt countries that are furniſhed with large
rivers are ſubject to periodical inundations; and
thoſe rivers which have long courſes overflow
with the greateſt regularity. Every body has
heard of the inundations of the Nile, the waters
of which, though ſpread over a large track of
country, and at a great diſtance from the ſea,
preſerve their ſweetneſs and tranſparency. Strabo
and other antient authors tell us, that the Nile
had ſeven mouths; but now only two that are
navigable remain: A third canal, indeed, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the ciſterns of Alexandria; and there is a
fourth which is ſtill leſs conſiderable. As the
cleaning of their canals has long been neglected,
they are moſtly in ruins. In theſe works the
antients annually employed a vaſt number of
workmen and ſoldiers, who carried off the mud
and ſand which this river brings down in great
quantities. The overflowing of the Nile is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by the rains that fall in Aethiopia: They
begin in April, and end not till September. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the firſt three months, the days are ſerene
and beautiful; but the ſun no ſooner ſets, than
the rains begin, continue inceſſantly till ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing,
and are commonly accompanied with
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0195400701:313"/>
thunder and lightning. The inundation in
Egypt begins about the 17th of June; it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
takes 40 days in ſwelling, and as many in
ſubſiding. The whole flat country of Egypt is
overflowed: But the inundation is not now ſo
great as in antient times; for Herodotus affirms,
that the Nile ſwelled 100 days, and required an
equal time to ſubſide. If this fact be true, the
difference can be aſcribed to no other cauſe but
the gradual elevation of the land by the mud
depoſited by the waters, and the diminution in
the height of the mountains from which this
river derives its ſource. It is natural to think,
that the height of the mountains is diminiſhed;
for the heavy rains that fall in theſe regions du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
one half of the year, bring down great
quantities of ſand and earth from the tops of
the mountains into the vallies, from which they
are tranſported by torrents into the channel of
the Nile, and are partly depoſited on the land by
means of the inundations.</p>
               <p>The Nile is not the only river that has regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and annual overflowings: The Pegu, which
is equally regular in its inundations, has, from
this circumſtance, got the name of the <hi>Indian
Nile.</hi> It overflows the country for 30 leagues
beyond its banks, and, like the Nile, leaves great
quantities of mud and ſlime, which enrich the
ground ſo much, that it produces excellent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
for cattle, and enables the inhabitants to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0195400701:314"/>
export rice<note n="*" place="bottom">See Les Voyages d' Ovington, tom. 2. p. 290.</note>. The Niger, or, which is the ſame
thing, the upper part of the Senegal, overflows
and covers the whole flat country of Nigritia.
Its inundation, like that of the Nile, begins about
the middle of June, and increaſes for 40 days.
The Plata, in Braſil, overflows annually, and at
the ſame time with the Nile. The Ganges, the
Indus, the Euphrates, and ſome other rivers,
produce annual inundations. But all rivers are
not ſubject to periodic inundations: Theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a combination of cauſes, which, at
the ſame time, augment the quantity of water,
and diminiſh its velocity.</p>
               <p>We formerly remarked, that the declivity of
rivers gradually diminiſh till they arrive at the
ſea. But, in ſome places, the declivity is more
ſudden, and forms what is called <hi>a cataract,</hi>
which is nothing more than an unuſually rapid
fall of the water. In the Rhine, for example,
there are two cataracts, one at Bilefeld, and the
other near Schafhouſe. The Nile has ſeveral
cataracts, two of the moſt remarkable fall from
a great height, between two mountains. In the
Wologda, in Muſcovy, there are alſo two, near
Ladoga. The Zaire, a river in Congo, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences
with a large cataract which falls from
the top of a mountain. But the moſt celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
cataract is that of the river Niagara in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada:
It falls, in a prodigious torrent, 156 feet
of perpendicular height, and is a fourth part of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0195400701:315"/>
a league in breadth. The vapour of the water
riſes to the clouds, is ſeen at the diſtance of five
leagues, and, when the ſun ſhines above it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits
a beautiful rainbow. Below this cataract
the whirlpools and commotions of the waters
are ſo tremendous, as to render navigation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable
for ſix miles; and above it, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is much narrower than higher up<note n="*" place="bottom">See Phil. Tranſ. Abridg. vol. 6. part 2. p. 119.</note>. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levoix<note n="†" place="bottom">Tom. 3. p. 353.</note>
deſcribes it in the following manner:</p>
               <p>'My firſt care, after my arrival, was to viſit
the nobleſt caſcade, perhaps, in the world; but
I preſently found the Baron de la Hontan had
committed ſuch a miſtake with reſpect to its
height and figure, as to give grounds to believe
he had never ſeen it. It is certain, that, if you
meaſure its height by that of the three moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
you are obliged to climb to get at it, it
does not come much ſhort of what the map of
M. Deſliſle makes it, that is, 600 feet, having
certainly gone into this paradox, either on the
faith of the Baron de la Hontan, or Father
Hennepin. But after I arrived at the ſummit
of the third mountain, I obſerved, that, in the
ſpace of three leagues, which I had to walk
before I came to this piece of water, though
you are ſometimes obliged to aſcend, you muſt
yet deſcend ſtill more, a circumſtance to which
travellers ſeem not to have ſufficiently attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
As it is impoſſible to approach it but on
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0195400701:316"/>
one ſide only, and conſequently to ſee it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
in profile, or ſideways; it is no eaſy
matter to meaſure its height with inſtruments.
It, has, however, been attempted by means of
a pole tied to a long line, and, after many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
trials, it has been found only 115, or
120 feet high. But it is impoſſible to be ſure
that the pole has not been ſtopt by ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
rock; for, though it was always drawn
up wet, as well as the end of the line to which
it was tied, this proves nothing at all, as the
water which precipitates itſelf from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
riſes very high in foam. For my own
part, after having examined it on all ſides,
where it could be viewed to the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
I am inclined to think we cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it leſs than a hundred and forty, or fifty
feet.'</p>
               <p>'As to its figure, it is in the ſhape of a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoe,
and is about 400 paces in circumference;
it is divided into two, exactly in the middle,
by a very narrow iſland, half a quarter of a
league long. It is true, thoſe two parts very
ſoon unite; that on my ſide, and which I could
only have a ſide view of, has ſeveral branches
which project from the body of the caſcade,
but that which I viewed in front, appeared to
me quite entire. The Baron de la Hontan
mentions a torrent, which, if this author has
not invented it, muſt certainly fall through
ſome channel on the melting of the ſnows.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0195400701:317"/>
Three leagues from Albany, in the province
of New York, there is a cataract of 50 feet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
height, the vapour of which gives
riſe alſo to a rainbow<note n="*" place="bottom">See Phil. Tranſ. Abridg. vol. 6. part 2. p. 119.</note>.</p>
               <p>In every country where the number of men
is too inconſiderable for forming and ſupporting
poliſhed ſocieties, the ſurface of the earth is more
unequal and rugged, and the channels of rivers
are more extended, irregular, and often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by cataracts. The Rhone and the
Loire would require the operation of ſeveral
ages before they became navigable. It is by
conſining and directing the waters, and clearing
the bottoms of rivers, that they acquire a fixed
and determinate courſe. In thinly inhabited
regions, nature is always rude, and ſometimes
deformed.</p>
               <p>Some rivers loſe themſelves in the ſands, and
others ſeem to precipitate into the bowels of the
earth. The Guadalquiver in Spain, the river of
Gottenburg in Sweden, and even the Rhine,
diſappear under ground. It is affirmed, that, in
the weſt part of the iſland of St Domingo, there
is a pretty high mountain, at the foot of which
are ſeveral large caverns, that receive the rivers
and brooks; and the noiſe of their fall is heard
at the diſtance of ſeven or eight leagues<note n="†" place="bottom">See Varen. Geogr. p. 43.</note>. The
number of rivers, however, that diſappear in the
earth, is very ſmall; and they ſeem not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0195400701:318"/>
very deep. It is more probable, that, like
the Rhine, they loſe themſelves by dividing and
diſperſing through a large ſurface of ſand, which
is very common with thoſe ſmall rivers that run
through dry and ſandy ground, of which there
are many examples in Africa, Perſia, Arabia,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>The rivers of the north carry down to the
ſea prodigious quantities of ice, which, by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating,
form thoſe enormous maſſes, ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to the mariner. The ſtraits of Waigat,
which is frozen during the greateſt part of the
year, is moſt remarkable for theſe maſſes of ice,
which are conſtantly brought into the ſtraits by
the river Oby. They attach themſelves all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the coaſts, and riſe to great heights. The
middle of the ſtrait freezes laſt, and the ice, of
courſe, does not riſe ſo high as on each ſide.
When the north wind ceaſes, and it blows in the
direction of the ſtraits, the ice begins to melt and
to break in the middle; then large maſſes are
detached, and tranſported into the open ſea.
The wind, which blows during the whole win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from the north, over the frozen country of
Nova Zembla, renders the regions watered by
the Oby, and all Siberia, ſo cold, that, at Tobol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſki,
in the 57th degree, there are no fruit trees,
though at Stockholm in Sweden, and even in
higher latitudes, they have fruit trees and legu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
plants. This difference proceeds not,
as has been imagined, from the ſea of Lapland
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0195400701:319"/>
being colder than that of the ſtraits, nor from
the country of Nova Zembla being colder than
that of Lapland, but from this circumſtance alone,
that the Baltic and the ſea of Bothnia ſoften the
rigour of the north wind; whereas, in Siberia,
there is nothing to check its activity. This ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
is a reſult of experience. The cold is
never ſo intenſe near the ſea coaſts as in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
parts of a country. There are plants
which endure the open air all winter at London,
which cannot be preſerved at Paris: And Sibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
which is a vaſt continent, is, for this reaſon,
colder than Sweden, which is almoſt ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the ſea.</p>
               <p>Spitzbergen is the coldeſt country in the
world: It runs as far as the 78th degree of north
latitude, and is compoſed of ſmall, pointed
mountains. Theſe mountains conſiſt of gravel,
and of flat ſtones, like gray ſlate, heaped upon
one another. According to the accounts of voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agers,
theſe hills are raiſed by the winds, and
new ones appear every ſeaſon. In this country
no quadrupeds live but the rein-deer, which
feeds upon moſs. Beyond theſe hills, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a league from the ſea, the maſt of a ſhip
was lately found with a pully fixed to one end
of it; from which circumſtance, it has been
concluded, that this is a new country, and that
it was formerly covered with the ſea: It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited
and uninhabitable; for the hills have
no conſiſtence, but are looſe and moveable; and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0195400701:320"/>
a vapour proceeds from the earth, ſo cold and
penetrating, as to preclude the poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
any time upon this dreary and inhoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable
land.</p>
               <p>The whale-fiſhing veſſels arrive at Spitzber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen
in July, and depart from it about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of Auguſt, the ice not permitting them
to arrive ſooner, or to remain longer. In theſe
ſeas there are prodigious boards of ice, clear and
ſhining as glaſs, and from 60 to 80 fathom
thick; and, in ſome places, the ſea appears to
be frozen to the bottom<note n="*" place="bottom">See recueil des voyages du Nord, tom. 1. p. 154.</note>.</p>
               <p>The ſeas of North America are likewiſe much
infeſted with ice, as in Aſcenſion-bay, in Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's,
Cumberland's, Davis's, and Frobiſher's
ſtraits, &amp;c. We are aſſured by Robert Lade,
that the mountains of Frieſland are entirely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with ſnow; and that the ice ſurrounds the
coaſts, and, like a bulwark, prevents all approach
to them. 'It is remarkable,' ſays he, 'that, in
this ſea, we meet with iſlands of ice, more than
half a league in circumference, exceedingly
high, and that deſcend from 70 to 80 fathoms
deep. This ice, which is ſweet, is perhaps o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
formed in the rivers or ſtraits of the
adjacent lands, &amp;c. Theſe iſlands or moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of ice are moveable, and , in ſtorms, they
follow the tract of a ſhip, as if they were
drawn after her by a rope. Some of them
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0195400701:321"/>
riſe ſo high above water, that they ſurmount
the tops of the talleſt maſts<note n="*" place="bottom">See Lade's voyages.</note>,' &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the voyages collected for the uſe of the
Dutch Eaſt India Company, we have the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
account of the ice off Nova Zembla:
'At Cape Trooſt, the weather was ſo foggy, as
to oblige us to moor our veſſel to a bank of
ice, which was 36 fathoms below, and 16 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the ſurface of the water. On the 10th
of Auguſt, the ice began to ſeparate, and to
float; we then remarked, that the maſs to
which our veſſel had been moored, touched
the bottom; for, though the others were all
in motion, and ſtruck againſt it, and againſt
each other, it remained immoveable. We
were now afraid of being frozen in, or daſhed
to pieces by the ice; we, therefore, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to eſcape from this latitude, though the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
in her courſe, was obliged to puſh through
the ice, which made a great noiſe round us for
a conſiderable diſtance: We at laſt anchored
along another board of ice, where we remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that night.'</p>
               <p>'During the firſt watch, the ice began to
ſplit, with an inconceivable noiſe. The ſhip's
head kept ſo ſtrongly to the current in which
the ice-boards floated, that we were obliged to
veer the cable in order to get her off. We
counted above 400 blocks of ice, which ſank
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0195400701:322"/>
10 fathoms below the water, and appeared to
riſe about 2 fathoms above it.'</p>
               <p>'We then moored the veſſel to another block
of ice, which was immerſed below the ſurface
about ſix fathoms. At a little diſtance from
this ſtation we perceived a large bank, which
was pointed like a cone, and reached to the
bottom of the ſea: We approached it, and
found it to be 20 fathoms below, and about
12 above the ſurface of the water.'</p>
               <p>'On the 11th, we ſailed up to another bank,
which was 18 fathoms below the ſurface, and
10 fathoms above it.'</p>
               <p>'The Dutch, on the 21ſt, advanced a great way
between the boards of ice, and anchored during
the night. Next morning they retired, and
moored to a bank which was 18 fathoms below,
and 10 above the water. They climbed to
the top, and remarked, as a ſingular phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,
that it was covered with earth, and
that they found there about 40 eggs. Its
colour was a fine azure blue, and totally diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from that of the other maſſes. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
gave riſe to various ſpeculations;
ſome imagining it to be an effect of the ice,
and others thought the whole was a maſs of
frozen earth<note n="*" place="bottom">See Troiſieme voyage des Hollandois par le Nord, tom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Wafer met with many floating pieces of ice
off Terra del Fuego, which were ſo large that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0195400701:323"/>
he at firſt imagined them to be iſlands: Some
of them, he remarks, appeared to be a league or
two in length, and the largeſt of them ſeemed to
riſe 400 or 500 feet above the ſurface of the
water.</p>
               <p>All theſe boards of ice, as I have remarked in
the 6th Article, are tranſported from the rivers
into the ſea. Thoſe in the ſea of Nova Zembla
and in the Straits of Waigat, come from the
Oby, and, perhaps, from the Jeniſca, and
other great rivers in Siberia and Tartary;
thoſe of the Hudſon's Straits, from Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion-bay,
into which many rivers in North A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica
empty themſelves; and thoſe of Terra
del Fuego, from the ſouthern continent. If
fewer of them appear in the northern coaſts of
Lapland than in thoſe of Siberia and Waigat's
Straits, it is becauſe all the Lapland rivers fall
into the gulf of Bothnia, and none of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the north ſea. They may likewiſe be formed
in ſtraits, where the tides riſe higher than in the
open ſea; and, conſequently, where the boards
of ice that float on the ſurface may accumulate
and produce maſſes or banks of ſeveral fathoms
high. But, with regard to thoſe which riſe to
the height of four or five hundred feet, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that they can no where be produced but
near very elevated coaſts; and I imagine, that,
when the ſnows which cover theſe coaſts melt,
the water runs down upon the boards of ice,
and, by freezing anew, gradually augment their
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0195400701:324"/>
ſize, till they arrive at this amazing height;
that, in a warm ſummer, the action of the winds,
the agitation of the ſea, and perhaps their own
weight, may detach them from the coaſts, and
ſet them adrift; and that they may even be
tranſported into temperate climates before they
are entirely diſſolved.</p>

               <head>Of Seas and Lakes.</head>
               <p>THE dry land is every where ſurrounded
by the ocean: It penetrates, ſometimes by
large openings, and ſometimes by ſmall ſtraits,
into the interior parts of different countries; and
it forms mediterranean ſeas, ſome of which are
affected by the motion of the tides, and others
not. We ſhall, in this article, trace the ocean
through all its windings; and, at the ſame time,
give an enumeration of all the mediterranean
ſeas, which we ſhall endeavour to diſtinguiſh
from what are called bays or gulfs, and lakes.</p>
               <p>The ſea that waſhes the weſtern coaſts of
France, forms a gulf between Spain and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
This gulf is, by navigators, called the Bay
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0195400701:326"/>
of Biſcay: It is very open, and advances far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
into the land between Bayonne and St Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian.
It likewiſe advances conſiderably at
Rochelle and Rochefort. This bay begins at
Cape Ortegal, and terminates at Breſt, where a
ſtrait commences between the ſouth point of
Britain and Cape Lizard. This ſtrait, which is
at firſt pretty wide, forms a ſmall bay on the
coaſt of Normandy, the moſt advanced point of
which is at Auranche. It continues pretty large
till it arrives at the channel of Calais, where it
is very narrow; it then ſuddenly enlarges, and
terminates between the Texel and the coaſt of
Norwich: At the Texel, it forms a ſmall ſhallow
mediterranean called <hi>Zuiderſee,</hi> and ſeveral large
gaps or advances, whoſe waters are not of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
depth.</p>
               <p>After this, the ocean forms a large bay called
the <hi>German Sea,</hi> which commences at the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
point of Scotland, and runs along the eaſt
coaſt of Britain the length of Norwich; and
from thence to the Texel, along the coaſts of
Holland and Germany, of Jutland and Norway,
as far as Bergen. This bay may even be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as a mediterranean; for the Orkney
iſlands nearly ſhut up its mouth, and ſeem, by
their direction, to be a continuation of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of Norway. It forms a large ſtrait, which
commences at the ſouth point of Norway, and
continues pretty broad to the iſland of Zetland,
where it ſuddenly contracts, and forms, between
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0195400701:327"/>
the coaſts of Sweden and the iſlands of Denmark
and Jutland, four ſmall ſtraits; after which, it
widens to a ſmall bay, the moſt advanced point
of which is at Lubec; from thence, to the ſouth
extremity of Sweden, it continues pretty broad;
then it enlarges more and more, and forms the
Baltic, which is a mediterranean ſea, extending,
from ſouth to north, near 300 leagues, if the
gulph of Bothnia, which, in effect, is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of it, be comprehended. In the Baltic are
two bays, that of Livonia, the moſt advanced
point of which is near Mittau and Riga, and
that of Finland, which is a branch of the Baltic,
extending between Livonia and Finland to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſburgh,
and communicating with lake Ladoga,
and even with lake Onega, which joins the white
ſea by means of the river Onega. The whole
body of water which forms the Baltic, the Gulfs
of Bothnia, of Finland, and of Livonia, ought
to be regarded as an immenſe lake, ſupported by
a great number of rivers, as the Oder, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula,
the Niemen, the Droine in Germany and
Poland; by other rivers in Livonia and Finland,
by others ſtill more conſiderable that come from
Lapland, as the Tornea, the Calis, the Lula, the
Pithea, the Uma; and by ſeveral from Sweden.
Theſe rivers, which in general are large, amount
in all to more than 40, computing thoſe which
fall into them, and cannot fail to convey a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of water ſufficient to ſupply the Baltic. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
there are no tides in the Baltic, and its
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0195400701:328"/>
water has very little faltneſs: And, if the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the land, and the number of lakes and
marſhes in Finland and Sweden, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
to the Baltic, be taken into conſideration,
we ſhall be inclined to regard it not as a ſea, but
as a great lake formed by the waters which it
receives from the adjacent countries, and which
have forced for themſelves a paſſage near Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
into the ocean, into which, according to
the relation of voyagers, it ſtill continues to run.</p>
               <p>From the commencement of the bay which
goes by the name of the German Sea, and which
terminates beyond Bergen, the ocean follows
the coaſts of Norway, Swediſh Lapland, North
Lapland, and Muſcovite Lapland, at the eaſtern
part of which it forms a large ſtrait, and gives
riſe to the mediterranean called the White Sea,
which may alſo be conſidered as a great lake;
for it receives twelve or thirteen large rivers,
which are more than ſufficient to ſupply it with
water; and its water contains but little ſalt.
Beſides, it is within a trifle, in ſeveral places, of
communicating with the Baltic; and it has an
evident communication with the gulf of Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
for, in aſcending the river Onega, we
arrive at a lake of the ſame name, which is
joined by two rivers to lake Ladoga; and this
laſt communicates by a large branch with the
gulf of Finland; and there are, in Swediſh
Lapland, ſeveral places from which the waters
run almoſt indifferently either into the White
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0195400701:329"/>
Sea, or into the gulfs of Bothnia and of Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
This whole country being full of lakes
and marſhes, it, therefore, ſeems probable, that
the Baltic and White Seas were the receptacles
of its waters, and that, in time, they diſcharged
themſelves into the German and Frozen ſeas.</p>
               <p>On leaving the White Sea, and coaſting the
iſland of Candenos, and the north of Ruſſia, the
ocean advances a ſmall arm into the land at the
mouth of the river Petzora. This arm, which
is about 40 leagues in length, by 8 or 10 in
breadth, may rather be regarded as a collection
of water formed by the river, than as a gulf of
the ſea; and it alſo contains very little ſalt. In
this place the land runs out in a promontory
terminated by the ſmall iſlands of Maurice and
of Orange, and between this promontory and
the neighbouring land to the ſouth of Waigat's
ſtraits, there is a bay of about 30 leagues long,
which belongs to the ocean, and is not formed
by rivers. This is ſucceeded by Waigat's ſtraits,
which lies nearly under the 70th degree of
north latitude; it is not above 8 or 10 leagues
in length, and it communicates with the ſea
which waſhes the north coaſts of Siberia. As
this ſtrait is blocked up with ice during the
greateſt part of the year, it is very difficult to
penetrate into the ſea beyond it. This paſſage
has been tried in vain by many navigators; and
thoſe who ſucceeded have not given us exact
charts of this ſea, which they call the Pacific
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0195400701:330"/>
Sea. By the moſt recent charts, and by the
beſt globes, it appears, that this ſea may be only
a mediterranean, having no connection with the
great ſea of Tartary; for it ſeems to be ſhut up
and bounded to the ſouth by the country of the
Samoides, which is now well known, and which
extends from the Straits of Waigat to the mouth
of the river Jeniſca: To the eaſt, it is bounded
by Jelmorland; to the weſt by Nova Zembla;
and, though we know not the extent of this
ſea to the north and north-eaſt, as the land ſeems
not to be interrupted, it is probable that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific
Sea is only a mediterranean; and that it is
bounded by land, and has no communication on
that ſide with the ocean. What eſtabliſhes this
fact is, that, in departing from the Straits of
Waigat, the whole weſt and north coaſts of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va
Zembla, the length of Cape Deſire, have been
traverſed; that, from this Cape, the coaſts of
Nova Zembla have been traced to a ſmall bay
about the 75th degree, where ſome Dutchmen
paſſed a dreadful winter in 1596; and that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
this gulf, the land of Jelmorland was
diſcovered in 1664, which is ſeparated from Nova
Zembla only by a few leagues of land; ſo that
the only land unknown is a ſmall ſpot near this
little bay juſt now deſcribed; and this ſpot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not, perhaps, 30 leagues in length. If,
therefore, the Pacific Sea joins with the eaſtern
ocean, it muſt be by means of this ſmall bay,
which is the only way by which this mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0195400701:331"/>
can have any communication with it.
And, even on the ſuppoſition that ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
exiſted, as this bay lies in the 75th
degree of latitude, it would be neceſſary, to gain
this open ſea, to keep five degrees farther north.
It is apparent, therefore, that, in attempting a
north paſſage to China, it is better to ſail beyond
Nova Zembla to the 77th or 78th degree, where
the ſea is more open and clearer of ice, than to
perſiſt in paſſing the frozen ſtraits of Waigat,
when it is even uncertain whether the ſea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
them has any communication with the
eaſtern ocean.</p>
               <p>The coaſt has been traced from Nova Zem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bla
and Jelmorland to the mouth of the Chotan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,
which is about the 73d degree; beyond
which an unknow coaſt extends about 200
leagues. We only know, from the Ruſſians
who travelled by land into theſe climates, that
the country is not interrupted; and, in their
charts, the rivers are delineated, and they called
the inhabitants <hi>Populi Palati.</hi> This interval of
unknown coaſt extends from the mouth of the
Chotanga to that of Kauvoina, in the 66th de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of latitude. The bay of Linchidolin, in
which the Ruſſians fiſh whales, advances far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
into the land at the mouth of the Len,
which is a conſiderable river. This bay is very
open, and pertains to the ſea of Tartary.</p>
               <p>From the mouth of the Len, the northern
coaſt of Tartary runs about 500 leagues eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0195400701:332"/>
to a peninſula inhabited by a people called
Schelates; it is the moſt northern point of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
and lies under the 72d degree of latitude.
In this 500 leagues, the ocean forms neither
bays nor arms; only, from the peninſula of the
Schelates, to the mouth of the Korvinea, the
coaſt has a conſiderable winding. This point is
the eaſtern extremity of the north coaſt of the
Old Continent, and Cape North in Lapland is the
weſtern extremity. Thus, we have of northern
coaſt, from Cape North in Lapland, to the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the country of the Schelates, an extent
of 1700 leagues, including the ſinuoſities of
bays; and it meaſures about 1100 leagues in
a ſtraight line.</p>
               <p>Let us next take a ſurvey of the eaſtern coaſts
of the Antient Continent, commencing at the
extreme point of the country of the Schelates,
and deſcending towards the equator. The ocean
firſt makes a turn between the country of the
Schelates and that of the Tſchutſchi, which laſt
projects conſiderably into the ſea. To the ſouth
of this country, there is a ſmall open bay, called
the bay of Suctoikret; this bay is ſucceeded by
another, which advances, like an arm, about 40
or 50 leagues into the land of Kamtſchatka:
After which the ocean flows in, by a narrow
ſtrait, full of ſmall iſlands, between the ſouthern
point of Kamtſchatka and the northern point
of the land of Jeſſo, and forms a large medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,
which we ſhall now deſcribe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail.
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0195400701:333"/>
It conſiſts of the ſea of Kamtſchatka, in
which there is a conſiderable iſland, called
the iſland of <hi>Amour.</hi> An arm of this ſea
runs north-eaſt. But, both this arm and the
ſea of Kamtſchatka may, at leaſt in part, be
formed by the waters from the rivers which
flow into it from the lands of Kamtſchatka, and
thoſe of Tartary. However this matter ſtands,
the ſea of Kamtſchatka communications, by a very
long ſtrait, with the ſea of Corea, which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of this mediterranean; and the whole
together, extending more than 600 leagues in
length, is bounded, on the weſt and north, by
the lands of Corea and Tartary; and, on the
eaſt and ſouth, by thoſe of Kamtſchatka, Jeſſo,
and Japan, without having any other communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with the ocean than by the ſtrait between
Kamtſchatka and Jeſſo; for, it is uncertain
whether the communication between Japan and
the land of Jeſſo, though laid down in ſome
charts, has a real exiſtence; and, even ſuppoſing
it did exiſt, the ſea of Kamtſchatka and that of
Corea would ſtill be regarded as forming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a great mediterranean, ſeparated on all
ſides from the ocean, and not as a bay; for it
communicates not with the ocean by its ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
ſtrait, but with the Chineſe Sea, which is
rather a mediterranean than a bay.</p>
               <p>In the preeceding article, it was remarked, that
the ſea had a conſtant motion from eaſt to weſt;
and that, conſequently, the great Pacific Ocean
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0195400701:334"/>
is making continual efforts againſt the eaſtern
coaſts. An accurate examination of the globe
will confirm the concluſions we have drawn
from this obſervation; for, it appears, that,
from Kamtſchatka to New Britain, diſcovered
by Dampier in 1700, and which lies in the 4th
or 5th degree of ſouth latitude, the ocean has
encroached on theſe coaſts to the extent of 400
leagues; and, of courſe, that the eaſtern bounds
of the Old Continent ſtretch not ſo far as they
did formerly; for, it is remarkable, that New
Britain and Kamtſchatka, which are the moſt
advanced lands to the eaſt, lie under the ſame
meridian. Beſides, all countries extend fartheſt
from north to ſouth. Kamtſchatka makes a
point of about 160 leagues from north to ſouth,
and this point, the eaſtern coaſt of which is
waſhed by the Pacific Ocean, and the other by
the mediterranean above deſcribed, is divided
from north to ſouth by a chain of mountains.
The lands of Japan and of Jeſſo form another
territory between the ocean and the ſea of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,
extending from north to ſouth more than
400 leagues; and the direction of the chains of
mountains in Jeſſo and Japan muſt be from
north to ſouth; becauſe, in this direction, they
extend 400 leagues; but, from weſt to eaſt,
they exceed not 50 or 60. Thus, Kamtſchatka,
Jeſſo, and the eaſtern part of Japan, ought to
be conſidered as contiguous lands, lying in a
direction from north to ſouth: And, following
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0195400701:335"/>
the ſame direction, we find, after the point of
Cape Ava in Japan, the iſland of Barnevelt, and
three other iſlands, ſituated in a line from north
to ſouth, and extending about 100 leagues.
We next meet with three iſlands, called Calla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,
and after theſe, the Ladrone iſlands, to the
number of 14 or 15, all ſtretching in a line
from north to ſouth, the whole occupying a
ſpace of 300 leagues in length; and the broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of theſe iſlands, from eaſt to weſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not 8 leagues. From theſe facts, I am
led to conclude, that Kamtſchatka, Jeſſo, the
eaſt part of Japan, the iſlands of Barnevelt, the
Callanos, and the Ladrones, are a continuation
of the ſame chain of mountains, and the remains
of an antient country, which has been gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
corroded and covered with the ſea. All
theſe countries appear to be nothing but moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
of which the iſlands are the peaks or
points, the low-lands being occupied by the
ocean. What, therefore, is related in the <hi>Lettres
Edeſiantes</hi> is true; and, in fact, a number of
iſlands, called the New Philippines, has been
diſcovered in the very ſituation that P. Gobien
ſuppoſed them to lie: And, it cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the moſt eaſterly of theſe New Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
are a continuation of the chain of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
which compoſe the Ladrones; for theſe
eaſtern iſlands, to the number of eleven, lie in
a line from north to the ſouth, extending in
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0195400701:336"/>
length more than 200 leagues, and, in breadth,
the largeſt of them exceeds not eight leagues.</p>
               <p>But theſe conjectures may ſeem to be bold,
on account of the great diſtances between the
iſlands in the neighbourhood of Cape Ava, of
Japan, and of the Callanos, between theſe iſlands
and the Ladrones, and between the Ladrones and
the New Philippines, the firſt interval being
about 160 leagues, the ſecond 50 or 60, and the
third near 120. But it ought to be conſidered,
that chains of mountains often extend much
farther below the waters of the ocean; and that
theſe intervals are nothing when compared to
the extent of land, from ſouth to north, in theſe
iſlands or mountains, which, beginning at the
interior part of Kamtſchatka, is more than 1100
leagues. But, though this idea concerning the
quantity of land gained by the ocean on the
eaſtern parts of the Old Continent, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of the mountains, ſhould be rejected,
ſtill it muſt be acknowledged, that Kamtſchatka,
Jeſſo, Japan, the iſlands of Rois, Formoſa, Vaif,
Baſha, Babuyane, Lucca, Mindano, Gilolo, &amp;c.
and, laſtly, New Guinea, which extends to New
Britain, and is ſituated under the ſame meridian
as Kamtſchatka, form a ſtretch of country of
more than 2200 leagues, with ſmall interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the greateſt of which exceeds not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
20 leagues; ſo that the ocean has ſcooped
out an immenſe bay from the interior parts of
the eaſtern continent, which begins at Kamt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchatka,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0195400701:337"/>
and terminates at New Britain. This
bay is interſperſed with numerous iſlands, and
has all the appearances of being gained from
the land. It is, therefore, probable, that the
ocean, by its conſtant motion from eaſt to weſt,
has gradually gained this great tract of country
from the continent, and has formed ſeveral me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterraneans,
as thoſe of Kamtſchatka, of Corea,
of China, and perhaps the whole Indian Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago;
for the land and the water are ſo blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
together in this region, that it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to have been a large country deſtroyed by
inundations, of which only the eminences and
mountainous parts are now to be ſeen, the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
grounds being entirely concealed under the
waters of the ocean. This hypotheſis is farther
confirmed by the ſhallowneſs of the ſea, and
the figures of the innumerable iſlands, which
ſeem to be nothing but the tops of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
               <p>If we take a more particular ſurvey of theſe
ſeas, we will find, that the northern part of the
Chineſe ſea forms itſelf into a great bay, which
begins at the iſland of Fungma, and terminates
at the frontiers of the province of Pekin, about
50 leagues from this capital of the Chineſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
The moſt advanced and narroweſt part of
this bay is called the gulf of Changi. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that this gulf, and part of the ſea of China,
are encroachments of the ocean, and that the
iſlands above deſcribed are the moſt elevated
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0195400701:338"/>
parts of the antient country. Farther ſouth are
the bays of Tonquin and of Siam, in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of which is the peninſula of Malacca,
conſiſting of a long chain of mountains that run
from north to ſouth; and the Andaman iſlands,
which form another chain of mountains, in the
ſame direction, ſeem to be only a continuation
of the mountains of Sumatra.</p>
               <p>After this the ocean forms the great bay of
Bengal; where it may be remarked, that the
land of the peninſula of Indus makes a concave
curve, towards the eaſt, nearly reſembling the
great bay of the eaſtern continent, which ſeems
to have been produced by the ſame cauſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the motion of the ſea from eaſt to weſt. In
this peninſula are the mountains of Gates, which
extend from north to ſouth; and the iſland of
Ceylon appears to have been ſeparated from this
part of the continent.</p>
               <p>The Maldiva iſlands are nothing but another
chain of mountains ſtretching from north to
ſouth. Then follows the Arabian gulph, which
ſends off four branches or arms; the two largeſt
are on the weſt coaſt, and the two ſmalleſt on the
eaſt. The firſt arm on the eaſt coaſt is the bay
of Cambaia, which extends not above 50 or 60
leagues; but it receives two conſiderable rivers,
the Tapta and the Baroche or Mehi. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
arm or bay on the ſame coaſt is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for the rapidity and height of its tides,
which alternately advance and retreat more than
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0195400701:339"/>
50 leagues. Into this bay fall ſeveral rivers, as
the Indus, the Padar, &amp;c. which have brought
down ſand and mud in ſuch quantities as to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the bottom of the bay, and reduce it nearly
to a perfect level. It is owing to this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
that the tides extend to ſo great a diſtance.
The firſt arm on the weſt coaſt is the Perſic
gulf, which advances into the land above 250
leagues; and the ſecond is the Red Sea, which,
reckoning from the iſland of Socotora, extends
above 680 leagues. From the ſtraits of Ormuz
and of Babelmandel, theſe two arms ſhould be
conſidered as mediterranean ſeas: They are
both, indeed affected with the tides; but this is
occaſioned by their vicinity to the equator,
where the tides <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> higher than in other climates.
Beſides, they are both very long and very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
The motion of the tides is more rapid in
the Red Sea than in the Perſic gulf; becauſe the
former is nearly three times as long, and equally
narrow, as the latter; neither does it receive
any river capable of reſiſting the tide: But the
Perſic gulf receives three large rivers at its moſt
advanced extremity. It is apparent, that the
Red Sea has been formed by an irruption of the
ocean; for the ſituation and ſimilarity in the
direction of the coaſts on each ſide of the ſtraits
of Babelmandel demonſtrate, that this paſſage
has been cut by the waters.</p>
               <p>At the extremity of the Red Sea lies that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
ſtrip of land called the Iſthmus of Suez,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0195400701:340"/>
which is a barrier to the junction of the Red
Sea with the Mediterranean. In the preceding
article, I gave the reaſons which render it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that the Red Sea is higher than the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean,
and that, if the Iſthmus were cut,
an inundation and increaſe of the latter would
be the conſequence. It may here be added,
that, though the ſuperior elevation of the Red
Sea ſhould not be allowed, yet, that there are no
tides in the Mediterranean near the mouths of
the Nile, is an unconteſtible fact. It is equally
certain, that the tides in the Red Sea riſe ſeveral
feet; and this circumſtance alone, on the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the removal of the Iſthmus, would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
a great influx of water from the Red Sea
into the Mediterranean. Beſides, Varenius, in
his geography<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 100.</note>, remarks, 'Oceanus Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,

ocean, therefore, is higher than the ſea of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
there is nothing to prevent us from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that the Red Sea may be higher than the
Mediterranean. Herodotus and Diodorus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus
mention a canal of communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Nile, the Mediterranean, and the Red
Sea: And M. de l'Iſle, in 1704, publiſhed a
map, in which he has laid down the termination
of a canal in the eaſt branch of the Nile, which
he imagined to be a part of that which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
joined that river to the Red Sea<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année, 1704.</note> We meet
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0195400701:342"/>
with the ſame opinion in a book entitled <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſance
de l'Ancien Monde</hi>; where the author,
copying Diodorus Siculus, farther informs us,
that this canal was begun by Neco King of
Egypt; that Darius King of Perſia continued
the work; that it was finiſhed by Ptolomy II.
who conducted it to the city of Arſinoa; and
that it could be ſhut and opened at pleaſure. I
pretend not to deny theſe facts; but, I confeſs,
they appear to be doubtful. I ſuſpect, that the
violence and height of the tides, in the Red Sea,
would neceſſarily produce and communicate
their influence to the waters of the canal: At
leaſt, it would require great precaution to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
inundations, and to keep the canal in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
repair. Though we are told by hiſtorians
that this canal was begun and finiſhed, they are
ſilent as to its duration; and the remains of it,
which are pretended ſtill to exiſt, are perhaps
all that was ever executed. This branch of the
ocean has been denominated the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
wherever there are madrepores or corals
at the bottom, the water of it has the appearance
of this colour. The following deſcription of it
is given in the <hi>Hiſtoire Generale des Voyages</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. 1. p. 198.</note>:
'Before leaving the Red Sea, D. Jean inquired
into the cauſes which induced the antients to
give it this appellation: He recollected, that
Pliny had delivered ſeveral opinions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the origin of this name. Some derived it
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0195400701:343"/>
from a King of that country called <hi>Erythros,</hi>
which, in the Greek language, ſignifies <hi>Red</hi>:
Others imagined that the red colour was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by the reflection of the ſun from the
ſurface of the water; and others affirmed the
water itſelf to be red. The Portugueſe, who
had made ſeveral voyages in that ſea, alledged,
that the whole coaſt of Arabia was remarkably
red; and that the duſt and ſand carried into
the ſea by the winds tinged the water with the
ſame colour.'</p>
               <p>'Dom Jean, who examined the nature of the
water and of the coaſts, through their whole
extent, with the moſt ſcrupulous attention, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
us, that the waters of this ſea have no
peculiarity in their colour, and that the duſt
and ſand, not being red themſelves, could not
poſſibly communicate this colour to the water.
The land on each ſide, he obſerves, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
brown; in ſome places, it is black, and,
in others, white: At Suaquem, the coaſts of
which the Portugueſe never viſited, there are
three mountains ſtriped with red; but they
conſiſt of hard rocks, and the neighbouring
ground is of the uſual colour.'</p>
               <p>'The truth is, that this ſea is all of the ſame
uniform colour, of which any man may ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
himſelf by drawing water from different
parts. But, it muſt be acknowledged, that, in
ſome places, it appears, by accident, to be red,
and, in others, green and white. This phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0195400701:344"/>
admits of the following explication.
From Suaquem to Koſſir, which is an extent of
136 leagues, the ſea is filled with banks and
rocks of coral; they are ſo called from their
reſembling coral in form and colour ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it is difficult to perceive the diſtinction:
There are two kinds of them, the one is white,
and the other extremely red. In many places,
they are covered with a kind of gum, or viſcid
ſubſtance, of a green colour, and ſometimes of
a deep orange. Now the water of this ſea is
ſo tranſparent, that the bottom is viſible at the
depth of twenty fathoms, eſpecially from
Suaquem to the extremity of the gulf; and
hence the water aſſumes, in appearance, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the bodies which it covers. When,
for example, the rocks are overlaid with a
green gum, the water abover them appears to
be green; when the bottom is ſand alone, the
ſuperincumbent water ſeems to be white; and,
when the rocks are covered with coral, the
water above them appears to be reddiſh. But,
as the rocks of this colour are more frequent
than the green or white, Dom Jean concludes,
that the Arabic Gulf has, from this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
obtained the name of the Red Sea.
He was the more ſatisfied with this diſcovery,
becauſe the method he employed in the inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation
of it left no room for heſitation or
doubt. In ſuch places as were not deep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to allow his veſſel to ſail, he faſtened
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0195400701:345"/>
pinks oppoſite to the rocks; and the ſailors
were enabled to execute his orders, at more
than half a league from the rocks, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
immerſed above the middle of their bodies.
In thoſe places where the water appeared red,
the greateſt part of the ſtones and pebbles they
brought up were of the ſame colour; where
the water appeared green, the ſtones were
green alſo; and where the water appeared
white, the bottom was a pure white ſand.'</p>
               <p>From the entrance to the Red Sea, at Cape
Gardafu, to the Cape of Good Hope, the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the coaſt is pretty equal, and the ſea
forms no bays of any note. There is, indeed, a
ſmall ſcoop on the coaſt of Melinda, which, if
the Iſland of Madagaſcar were united to the
continent, might be conſidered as a part of a
large bay. This iſland, it is true, though ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by the ſtraits of Mozambigue, appears to
have formerly belonged to the continent; for,
in this ſtrait, there are deep ſands of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
eſpecially on the Madagaſcar coaſt, which
make the open part of it very narrow.</p>
               <p>From the Cape of Good Hope to Cape
Negro, on the weſt coaſt of Africa, the land lies
in the ſame direction; and the whole of it
ſeems to be a chain of mountains: It is, at leaſt,
a very elevated country, and, though more than
500 leagues in length, it it is furniſhed with no
rivers of any conſideration, excepting one or
two, which are, known no farther than their
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0195400701:346"/>
mouths. But the coaſts, above Cape Negro,
makes a large curve; and the land, along this
curve, appears to be lower than that of the reſt
of Africa: It is watered by ſeveral great rivers,
the largeſt of which are the Coanza and the
Zaire. From Cape Negro to Cape Gonſalvez,
are the mouths of 24 conſiderable rivers; and
the ſpace between theſe two capes, reckoning
along the ſhore, is about 420 leagues. We
would be tempted to think, that the ocean has
encroached on theſe low lands of Africa, not by
its natural motion from eaſt to weſt, which could
have no influence in producing this effect, but
by the facility with which it might have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
and ſurmounted them. From Cape Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalvez
to Cape Trois-pointes, the ocean forms
an open bay, which preſents nothing remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
excepting a very advanced point nearly in
the middle of it, called <hi>Cape Formoſa</hi>: It like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
contains, in the ſouthern part of it, the
iſlands of Fernandpo, St Thomas, and Prince's
Iſland. Theſe iſlands appear to be a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a chain of mountains ſituated between
Rie del Rey, and the river Jamoer. From Cape
Trois-pointes to Cape Palmas, the ocean runs
a little in upon the land; and from Cape
Palmas to Cape Tagrin, there is nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of remark. But, beyond Cape Tagrin,
there is a ſmall bay in the country of Sierra-Leona;
and a little farther, there is another, in
which are ſituated the iſlands of Biſagas. After
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0195400701:347"/>
this we meet with Cape Verd, which projects far
into the ſea, and of which the iſlands of the ſame
name appear to be a continuation; or, rather,
they ſeem to be a continuation of Cape Blanc,
which is a more elevated country, and ſtretches
ſtill farther into the ocean. We next come to
a mountainous and dry coaſt, which commences
at Cape Blanc, and terminates at Cape Bajador:
The Canary iſlands ſeem to be a continuation of
theſe mountains. Laſtly, between Africa and
Portugal, is a large open bay, in the middle of
which are the celebrated ſtraits of Gibraltar.
The ocean pours its waters, with great rapidity,
through this ſtrait into the Mediterranean. This
ſea runs into the interior parts of the land near
900 leagues, and gives riſe to many objects
worthy of remark. 1<hi>ſt,</hi> It has no tides that are
perceptible, excepting in the Gulf of Venice;
and a ſmall flux and reflux have been alledged to
take place at Marſeilles and on the coaſt of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli.
2<hi>d,</hi> It contains many large iſlands, as
Sicily, Sardinia, Corſica, Cyprus, Majorca, &amp;c.
and Italy, which is one of the moſt extenſive
peninſula's in the world: It is likewiſe adorned
with a rich Archipelago, or rather, it is from the
Mediterranean Archipelago that all other collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of iſlands have acquired that appellation.
But this Archipelago appears to belong more
properly to the Black Sea than to the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean;
and it is probable, that the country of
Greece was partly covered with the Black Sea,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0195400701:348"/>
which runs into the ſea of Marmora, and from
that into the Mediterranean.</p>
               <p>It has been alledged, that a double current
runs through the Straits of Gibraltar; one ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,
which carries the water from the ocean in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Mediterranean, and another inferior,
which carries the waters from the Mediterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
back to the ocean. But this notion is falſe,
and contrary to the known laws of hydroſtatics.
Theſe oppoſite currents have been aſcribed to
ſeveral other ſtraits, as the Boſphorus, the ſtraits
of the Sund, &amp;c.; and Marſilli has related ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
experiments tending to prove the exiſtence
of a ſuperior and inferior current in the Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus.
Theſe experiments, however, muſt
have been fallacious; for ſuch a phaenomenon
is repugnant to the nature and motion of fluids.
Beſide, Greaves, in his <hi>Pyramidographie,</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated,
by accurate experiments, that there
are no oppoſite currents in the Boſphorus. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilli
and others may have been deceived by the
regorging of the water near the ſhores, which
takes place in the Boſphorus, in the ſtraits of
Gibraltar, and in all rapid rivers, and which oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
produces a motion oppoſite to that of the
principal current.</p>
               <p>Let us now briefly run over the coaſts of the
New Continent. We ſhall begin with Cape
Hold-with-hope, which is ſituated in the 73d
degree of North Latitude. This is the moſt
northerly point of land in New Greenland, and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0195400701:349"/>
is diſtant from Cape North in Lapland about
160 or 180 leagues. From this cape the coaſt
of Greenland might be traced to the polar circle,
where the ocean forms a large ſtrait between
Iceland and Greenland. Some maintain, that
this country in the neighbourhood of Iceland is
not the Antient Greenland, formerly poſſeſſed
by the Danes as a province dependent on that
kingdom; its inhabitants were civilized Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who had biſhops, churches, and a number
of towns proportioned to their trade. The Danes
had a communication with them as eaſy, and as
frequent, as the Spaniards with the Canary
iſlands: There ſtill exiſts, it is ſaid, laws and
regulations reſpecting the government of this
province, and theſe not of a very antient date.
However, without forming any conjectures how
this country came to be abſolutely loſt, we find
not, in New Greenland, the leaſt veſtige of what
is here related. They are mere ſavages: They
have no buildings: There is not a word in their
language that has the ſmalleſt affinity to the
Daniſh tongue; and there is not a ſingle cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
from which we can infer it to be the
ſame country. It is even almoſt a deſert, and
is covered with ſnow and ice the greateſt part
of the year. But, as theſe lands are of vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and, as the coaſts have been little frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by modern navigators, they may have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the place occupied by the deſcendents of
theſe poliſhed people; or the increaſe of the ice
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0195400701:350"/>
in this ſea may now, perhaps, prevent all acceſs
to them. If, however, maps can be truſted, the
whole coaſt of this country is known: It forms
a large peninſula, at the extremity of which are
the two ſtraits of Frobiſher and of Frieſland,
where the cold is exceſſive, although they are
not farther north than the Orkneys, that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
60 degrees.</p>
               <p>Between the weſt coaſt of Greenland, and
that of Labrador, the ocean forms a gulf, and
then a large mediterranean, which is the coldeſt
of all ſeas, and its coaſts are little known. In
purſuing this gulf, we meet with Davis's ſtrait,
which leads to the Chriſtian ſea, which termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
in Baffin's bay, through which there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be an outlet into Hudſon's bay. The
ſtrait of Cumberland, which, like that of Davis,
may lead into the Chriſtian ſea, is more narrow
and more ſubject to be frozen. Hudſon's ſtrait,
though much farther ſouth, is alſo frozen for
ſome part of the year: And it is remarkable,
that the tides are very high in theſe ſeas and
ſtraits, although no tides take place in the inland
ſeas of Europe, as the Baltic and Mediterranean.
This difference ſeems to be occaſioned by the
motion of the ſea from eaſt to weſt, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
high tides in ſtraits oppoſite to the current
of the waters, or whoſe mouths open to the eaſt.
Whereas, in thoſe of Europe, which open to the
weſt, there are no tides. The ocean, by its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
movement, ruſhes into the former, but
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0195400701:351"/>
from the latter; and this is the reaſon why
the tides are ſo violent in the ſeas of China,
Corea, and Kamtſchatka.</p>
               <p>In ſailing down Hudſon's bay towards La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brador,
there is a narrow opening, which Davis,
in 1586, traverſed for about 30 leagues, and
traded with the inhabitants. But no attempts
have hitherto been made to diſcover the whole
of this arm of the ſea. We know nothing of
the neighbouring country, but the land of the
Eſquimaux. Fort Pon-chartrin is the only ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement,
and the moſt northerly part of this
country; and it is ſeparated from the iſland of
Newfoundland by the ſmall ſtrait of Belleiſle,
which is little frequented. As the eaſtern coaſt
of Newfoundland has the ſame direction with
that of Labrador, this iſland appears to have
been formerly a part of the continent, in the
ſame manner as Iſle-Royal ſeems to have been
detached from Acadia. The bottoms of the
great bank, and of the leſſer banks on which the
cod-fiſhery is carried on, are not deep; but, as
they ſhelve a great way under water, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
violent currents. Between Cape Breton
and Newfoundland, there is a pretty large ſtrait,
which is the mouth of a ſmall mediterranean,
called the <hi>Gulf of St Laurence.</hi> It ſends off a
branch, which extends a conſiderable way into
the country, and appears to be only the mouth
of the river of that name. In this arm of the
ſea the tides are very perceptible; and, even at
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0195400701:352"/>
Quebec, which is farther up the country, the
waters riſe ſeveral feet. Leaving the gulf of St
Laurence, and following the coaſt of Acadia, we
meet with a ſmall gulf called <hi>Boſton-Bay,</hi> which
is of a ſquare figure, and advances but a little way
into the land. But, before we purſue this coaſt
any farther, it is worthy of remark, that, from
Newfoundland to Guiana, the ocean forms an
immenſe bay, that runs in upon the land as
far as Florida, which is more than 500 leagues.
This bay is ſimilar to that of the Old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
above deſcribed, where the ocean, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
forming a large gulf between Kamtſchatka
and New Britain, gives riſe to a great mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,
which comprehends the ſeas of Kamt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchatka,
of Corea, of China, &amp;c. In the ſame
manner, in the New Continent, the ocean, after
forming a large gulf between Newfoundland
and Guiana, gives riſe to a great mediterranean,
extending from the Antilles to Mexico; which
confirms what we have advanced concerning the
motion of the ſea from eaſt to weſt: For it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that the ocean has gained as much territory
on the eaſt of America as on the eaſt coaſt
of Aſia. Beſides, theſe great gulfs in each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
lie under the ſame degrees of latitude,
and are nearly of equal extent. Such ſingular
relations, it would appear, muſt have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the ſame cauſe.</p>
               <p>If we examine the poſition of the Antilles,
beginning with the iſland of Trinidad, which is
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0195400701:353"/>
the ſouthmoſt, it is impoſſible to doubt but that
Trinidad, Tobago, the Granades, St Vincent,
Martinico, Marygalante, Antego, Barbadoes,
and all the adjacent iſles, once formed a chain
of mountains which extended from ſouth to
north, like Newfoundland and the country of
the Eſquimaux. Farther, the direction of the
Antilles from eaſt to weſt, if we begin with Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes,
and paſs on to St Bartholomy, Porto-Rico,
St Domingo, and Cuba, is nearly the ſame
with the coaſts of Cape Breton, Acadia, and
New England. All theſe iſlands lie ſo cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that they may be regarded as a continued
belt of land, and as the moſt elevated parts of a
country now occupied by the ſea. Moſt of them,
in effect, are nothing but the tops of mountains;
and the ſea between them and the continent is a
true mediterranean, in which the tides are not
much more perceptible than in our Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean,
although the ſtraits between the iſlands
are directly oppoſite to the motion of the ſea
from eaſt to weſt, which ſhould contribute to
raiſe the tides in the gulf of Mexico. But, as
this gulf is very broad, the waters elevated by
the tide, being expanded over a large ſurface,
hardly produce any ſenſible change upon the
coaſt of Louiſianna and ſeveral other places.</p>
               <p>Both the Old and New Continents, therefore,
appear to have been encroached upon by the
ocean in the ſame latitudes: Both are furniſhed
with a great mediterranean, and a vaſt number
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0195400701:354"/>
of iſlands, which likewiſe lie nearly in the ſame
latitudes. The only difference is, that the Old
Continent, being much larger than the New, has
a mediterranean on its weſt coaſt, to which the
New Continent has nothing analogous. But
both ſeem to have undergone ſimilar revolutions;
theſe revolutions are greateſt near their middle
parts, or between the tropics, where the motion
of the ſea is moſt violent.</p>
               <p>The coaſts of Guiana, from the mouth of the
river Oronoko to that of the Amazones, offer
nothing remarkable. But the Amazones, which
is the largeſt river in the univerſe, forms a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
ſheet of water near Coropa, before it
diſcharges itſelf into the ſea by the two mouths
which ſorround the iſland of Caviana. From
the mouth of the Amazones to Cape St Roche,
the river runs almoſt ſtraight eaſt; from Cape
St Roche to Cape St Auguſtine, it runs ſouth;
and from Cape St Auguſtine, to the bay of All
Saints, it runs weſtward in ſuch a manner that
this part of Braſil projects conſiderably into the
ocean, which is directly oppoſite to a ſimilar
projection of the African coaſt. The bay of
All Saints is a ſmall arm of the ſea, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
about 50 leagues into the land, and is
much frequented by navigators. From this bay,
to Cape St Thomas, the coaſt runs ſtraight ſouth,
and from thence, in a ſouth-weſt direction, to
the mouth of the Plata, where an arm of the
ſea projects about 100 leagues into the land.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0195400701:355"/>
From this river, to the ſouthern extremity of
America, the ocean forms a large bay, which is
terminated by Falkland Iſland, Cape Aſſumption,
and other lands bordering on Terra del Fuego.
At the bottom of this bay is the ſtrait of Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,
the longeſt in the univerſe, and where the
tides riſe very high. Beyond this is the ſtrait
of La Maire, which is much ſhorter; and, <hi>laſtly,</hi>
Cape Horn, which is the ſouth point of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
               <p>On the ſubject of points or head-lands, it is
remarkable, that they all regard the ſouth, and
that moſt of them are cut by ſtraits that run
from eaſt to weſt. The point of South America
regards the Arctic Pole, and it is cut by the ſtrait
of Magellan: That of Greenland, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
has a ſouthern aſpect, is cut from eaſt
to weſt by the ſtrait of Frobiſher: That of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
regards alſo the ſouth, and, beyond the Cape
of Good Hope, are banks and ſhoals which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to have been ſeparated from it: That of
the peninſula of India is cut by the ſtrait be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
it and iſland of Ceylon; and, like all
others, projects ſouthward. Theſe are facts;
but we are unable to give any explication of
them.</p>
               <p>From Terra del Fuego, all along the weſt coaſt
of South America, the ocean makes conſiderable
advances into the land; and this coaſt ſeems to
follow exactly the direction of the high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
which traverſe this part of the continent
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0195400701:356"/>
from ſouth to north, from the Equator to the
Arctic Pole. Near the Line, the ocean forms a
large bay, extending from Cape St Francois to
Panama, that famous iſthmus, which, like that
of Suez, prevents the junction of the two ſeas.
If theſe two necks of land were removed, both
the Old and the New Continent would be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into two diſtinct portions. From Panama
to California, there occurs nothing worthy of
remark. Between the peninſula of California
and New Mexico, is a long arm of the ocean,
called the <hi>Vermilion Sea,</hi> which is more than 200
leagues long. In fine, the weſt coaſt of Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fornia
has been traced to the 43d degree of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.
It was in this latitude that Drake, who
firſt diſcovered the land to the north of Califor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
and which he called <hi>New Albion,</hi> was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged,
by the rigour of the cold, to change his
courſe, and to anchor in a ſmall bay which
bears his name; ſo that the countries beyond
the 43d or 44th degree, in this part of the globe,
are as little known as thoſe of North America
beyond the 48th degree, which is inhabited by
the Moozemleki, and the 51ſt, which is inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by the Aſſiniboils; the territory of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſavages extends much farther weſt than that
of the latter. All beyond, for 1000 leagues in
length, and as much in breadth, is totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
unleſs the Ruſſians, as they pretend,
have made ſome diſcoveries by departing from
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0195400701:357"/>
Kamtſchatka, and viſiting the eaſtern coaſts of
North America.</p>
               <p>The ocean, then, ſurrounds the whole globe,
without interruption, and we may ſail round it
by taking our departure from the ſouth point
of America. But we are ſtill uncertain whether
the ocean ſurrounds, in the ſame manner, the
north part of the globe; and all the navigators,
who have attempted to go from Europe to Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
by the north-eaſt or north-weſt, have equally
failed in their enterpriſes.</p>
               <p>Lakes differ from mediterraneans; the former
derive no water from the ocean; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
when they communicate with ſeas, they
are conſtantly diſcharging water into them.
Thus the Black Sea, which ſome geographers
have regarded as a branch of the Mediterranean,
and, of courſe, as an appendage of the ocean, is
only a lake; becauſe, in place of receiving any
ſupplies from the Mediterranean, its waters run
with rapidity through the Boſphorus, in the
lake called the Sea of Marmora, and from thence
through the ſtraits of the Dardanelles into the
Grecian Sea. The Black Sea is about 250 leagues
long, and 100 broad: It receives a number
of large rivers, as the Danube, the Nieper, the
Don, the Boh, the Donjec, &amp;c. The Don,
which unites with the Donjec, before it arrives
at the Black Sea, forms a lake called the <hi>Palus
Meotis,</hi> which is more than 100 leagues in
length, and from 20 to 25 in breadth. The Sea
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0195400701:358"/>
of Marmora, which is below the Black Sea, is a
lake ſmaller than the Palus Meotis, being not
above 50 leagues long, and 8 or 9 broad.</p>
               <p>It is related by ſome of the antients, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
by Diodorus Siculus, that the Euxine,
or Black Sea, was originally a great river or
lake, and had no communication with the Greek
Sea; but that its waters were, in the courſe of
time, ſo greatly augmented by the rivers that
fall into it, that they forced a paſſage, firſt by
the iſlands of Cyanea, and then by the Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpont.
This opinion has great probability on
its ſide; and, I think, it is no difficult matter to
explain how the operation was effected: For,
ſuppoſing the bottom of the Black Sea to have
been formerly much lower than it is now, the
mud and ſand carried down by the rivers would
gradually raiſe it, till the ſurface of the water
was elevated above that of the land, and then
the water would neceſſarily find a paſſage for
itſelf: And, as the rivers continue ſtill to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
ſand and earth, and as, at the ſame time,
the quantity of water in the rivers diminiſhes in
proportion as the mountains from which they
ſpring are lowered, it may happen, in the courſe
of ages, that the Boſphorus will again be filled
up. But, as effects of this nature depend on
many cauſes, we muſt content ourſelves with
ſimple conjectures. Mr Tourneſort, on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the antients, ſays, that the Black Sea,
which receives the waters of a great part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0195400701:359"/>
and Aſia, after being conſiderably augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
opened to itſelf a paſſage by the Boſphorus,
and either formed the Mediterranean, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
its waters to ſuch a degree, that they
forced a paſſage to the ocean through the ſtraits
of Gibraltar; and that the iſland of Atalantis,
mentioned by Planto, was, on this occaſion, total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overflowed. This notion cannot be ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for the ocean runs into the Mediterranean,
and not the Mediterranean into the ocean. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
M. Tournefort has not combined two eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
facts, though he has mentioned both of
them. The firſt is, that the Black Sea receives
9 or 10 rivers, each of which furniſhes more
water than is diſcharged by the Boſphorus; and
the ſecond, that the Mediterranean does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
more water from rivers than the Black
Sea, though it be ſeven or eight times larger;
and what it receives from the Boſphorus is not
the tenth part of what falls into the Black Sea.
How, therefore, could this tenth part of the
water that falls into a ſmall ſea, produce not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a larger ſea, but augment its waters to ſuch a
degree as would enable it to break down the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Gibraltar, and overwhelm an iſland
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> extent than the whole of Europe?
It is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to perceive that M. Tournefort has
not ſufficiently conſidered this matter. The
Mediterranean derives from the ocean at leaſt
ten times the quantity of water it receives from
the Black Sea; for the narroweſt part of the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0195400701:360"/>
Boſphorus exceeds not 800 pace, while that of
the ſtraits of Gibraltar is more than 5000; and,
ſuppoſing the velocities of both to be equal, ſtill
the water in the ſtraits of Gibraltar is by much
the deepeſt.</p>
               <p>M. Tournefort, who ridicules Polybius for
predicting that the Boſphorus will in time be
filled up, has not attended ſufficiently to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
otherwiſe he would not have pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the impoſſibility of ſuch an event. Muſt
not the Black Sea, which conſtantly receives the
ſand and mud of eight or ten large rivers, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
fill up? Muſt not the winds and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
current of the waters continually tranſport
part of theſe matters into the Boſphous? It is,
therefore, extremely probable, that, in the courſe
of ages, the Boſphorus will be choaked up, when
the quantity of water diſcharged by the rivers
into the Black Sea ſhall be greatly diminiſhed.
Now, the rivers are diminiſhing daily, becauſe
the mountains, which collect the dews, and give
riſe to the rivers, are continually diminiſhing.</p>
               <p>The Black Sea receives more water from ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
than the Mediterranean; and Mr Tourne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
obſerves, on this ſubject, 'That the greateſt
rivers in Europe fall into this ſea by means of
the Danube, into which are diſcharged the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Subia, Franconia, Bavaria, Auſtria,
Hungary, Moravia, Corinthia, Croatia, Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
Servia, Tranſylvania, and Wallachia: The
rivers of Black Ruſſia and of Podolia fall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0195400701:361"/>
wiſe into the ſame ſea by means of the Nieſter;
thoſe of the ſouthern and eaſtern parts of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
of the northern part of Muſcovy, and of
the country of the Coſſacks, fall into it, either
by the Nieper or Boriſthenes; the Tanais and
the Copa empty themſelves into the Black Sea
by the Cimmerian Boſphorus; the rivers of
Mingrelia, the principal of which is the Phaſis,
alſo diſcharge their contents into this ſea, and
likewiſe the Caſalmac, the Sangaris, and other
rivers of Aſia Minor which take a northern
courſe: Theſe vaſt diſcharges notwithſtanding,
the Thracian Boſphorus, which is the only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
from the Black Sea, is not comparable to
any one of theſe great rivers<note n="*" place="bottom">See voyage du Levant de Tournefort, vol. 2. p. 123.</note>.'</p>
               <p>All theſe facts demonſtrate the great quantity
of water carried off by evaporation; and it is
owing to this circumſtance that the ocean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
runs into the Mediterranean by the ſtraits
of Gibraltar. It is difficult to aſcertain the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of water received by any ſea; it requires an
exact knowledge of the breadth, depth, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of all the rivers that fall into it, of their
augmentation and diminution in different ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the year; and of the quantity which the
ſea loſes by evaporation. This laſt is the moſt
difficult to determine; for, ſuppoſing evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be proportioned to the ſurfaces, it will
be greater in a warm than in a cold climate.
Beſides, water mixed with ſalt and bitumen eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porates
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0195400701:362"/>
more ſlowly than freſh water; a ſea ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to great agitations evaporates more quickly
than a calm ſea; and a difference in the depth
has alſo ſome effect. In fine, ſo many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
are included in the theory of evaporation,
that it is not poſſible to make an exact eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it.</p>
               <p>The water of the Black Sea is leſs clear, and
leſs ſalt than that of the ocean. There are no
iſlands in it; and its tempeſts are more violent
and more dangerous than thoſe of the ocean;
becauſe its waters, being extended in a baſin
which has but an inconſiderable outlet, move,
when agitated, in a kind of whirlpools, which
beat upon all ſides of a veſſel with an inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
violence<note n="*" place="bottom">See voyages de Chardin, p. 142.</note>.</p>
               <p>After the Black Sea, the greateſt lake in the
world is the Caſpian Sea, which extends from
ſouth to north about 300 leagues, and its mean
breadth exceeds not 50. This lake receives the
Wolga, beſides ſeveral other conſiderable rivers,
as the Kur, the Faie, and the Gempo. But,
what is ſingular, it receives not one river from
the eaſt coaſt; the country on that ſide is a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
deſert, which remained, till lately, altogether
unknown. The Czar Peter I. ſent engineers to
make a chart of the Caſpian Sea. It had been
repreſented as round by former geographers;
but it is very long and very narrow. Its eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
coaſt, and the neighbouring country, were
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0195400701:363"/>
entirely unknown; even Lake Aral, which is
about 100 leagues eaſt of the Caſpian, was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not known to exiſt, or was conſidered as a
part of this ſea. Thus, before the diſcoveries
of the Czar, there was in this region an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
country of 300 leagues in length, and
100 or 150 in breadth. Lake Aral is nearly
oblong, and about 90 or 100 leagues long, and
50 or 60 broad. It receives the Sideroias and
the Oxus, two large rivers; but, like the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian,
it has no outlet for diſcharging its waters;
and, as the Caſpian receives no rivers from the
eaſt, Lake Aral, on the contrary, receives none
from the weſt. Hence it is preſumable, that
theſe two formerly conſtituted but one lake;
and the rivers being gradually choaked up, the
country between them would neceſſarily be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with ſand. There are ſome ſmall iſlands in
the Caſpian; and its waters are much freſher than
thoſe of the ocean. Storms, in this ſea, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
dangerous; and it affords not navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to large veſſels, on account of ſhoals,
ſand-banks, and rocks concealed under the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.
'The largeſt veſſels employed on the
Caſpian,' ſays Pietro della Valle<note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. 3. p. 235.</note> 'along the
coaſts of the province of Mazanda in Perſia,
where ſtands the town of Ferhabad, although
they be called <hi>ſhips,</hi> are no better than our tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes:
Their ſides are high; they draw little wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and are flat-bottomed. They are built of this
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0195400701:364"/>
conſtruction, not only becauſe this ſea is ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
near the coaſts, but becauſe it is full of
ſhoals and ſand-banks; ſo that no other veſſels
could be uſed with ſafety. I was ſurpriſed
to ſee no fiſhing carried on at Ferhabad, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
ſalmons at the mouth of the river, a
bad kind of ſturgeon, and other freſh water
fiſhes of no value. I attributed this to their
ignorance of navigation and of the art of fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
till I was informed by the Cham of Eſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abad,
that this ſea, at the diſtance of 20 or 30
miles from the ſhore, is ſo ſhallow, that nets
could not be uſed with advantage; and that
the ſame reaſon accounted for the conſtruction
of their veſſels, which carry no cannon, becauſe
the Caſpian is not infeſted with pirates.'</p>
               <p>Struys, Avril, and others, affirm, that, in the
neighbourhood of Kilan, there are two gulfs,
which ſwallow up the waters of the Caſpian, and
carry them, by ſubterraneous paſſages, into the
Perſic Gulf. De Fer, and other geographers,
have laid down theſe gulfs in their maps,
though we are aſſured by the Czar's envoys,
that they have no exiſtence<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1721.</note>. The fact, with
regard to the willow leaves found on the Perſic
Gulf, and which are alledged by the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
to be tranſported from the Caſpian Sea,
becauſe no willows grow near the Perſic Gulf,
appears to be equally improbable as the ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
paſſages, which Gemelli Careri, as well
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0195400701:365"/>
as the Ruſſians, maintain to be altogether ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary.
Beſides, the Caſpian is about a third leſs
than the Black Sea, which laſt alſo receives more
water by rivers; evaporation, therefore, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
ſufficient to carry off all its adventitious wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
without the aſſiſtance of imaginary gulfs,
or ſubterraneous paſſages.</p>
               <p>There are lakes, or ſeas, which neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
nor diſcharge rivers; there are others
which both receive and diſcharge; and others
which only receive rivers. The Caſpian, Lake
Aral, and the Dead Sea, are of the laſt kind:
In Aſia Minor, there is a ſmall lake of the ſame
ſpecies: There is another ſtill larger in Perſia,
upon which the city of Marago is ſituated: It is
of an oval figure, and about 10 or 12 leagues
long, and 6 or 7 broad: It receives the Tauris,
which is not a very conſiderable river. If to
theſe we add a ſmall lake of the ſame nature in
Greece, 12 or 15 leagues from Lepanto, we
have an enumeration of all the known lakes in
Aſia that belong to this ſpecies. In Europe,
there is not a ſingle one of any conſideration.
There are ſeveral ſmall lakes of this kind in
Africa, as thoſe which receive the rivers Ghir,
Zez, Touguedout, and Tafilet. Theſe four
lakes lie at no great diſtance from one another,
and are ſituated on the frontiers of Barbary,
near the deſart of Zaara. There is another in
the province of Kovar, which receives the river
that runs through the country of Berdoa. In
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0195400701:366"/>
North America, which abounds with lakes, there
are none of this kind, excepting two ſmall col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
of water formed by brooks, the one
near Guatimapo, and the other ſome leagues
from Realnuevo, both in Mexico. But in Peru
there are two contiguous lakes, one of which,
Lake Titicaca, is very large, and receives a river
which riſes near Cuſco; but no river iſſues from
it. There is a ſmall one in Tucuman, which
receives the river Salta; another, in the ſame
country, of greater extent, receives the Santiago;
and three or four between Tucuman and
Chili.</p>
               <p>Theſe lakes, which neither receive nor give
riſe to any river, are more numerous than the
kind juſt mentioned. They are a kind of
ſwamps, which collect the rain water; or, they
may originate from ſubterraneous waters, which
iſſue in the form of ſprings in low grounds,
from which there is no fall to carry them off.
Thoſe rivers that overflow may alſo leave ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
waters upon the land, which remain a
conſiderable time, and are occaſionally recruited
by ſubſequent inundations. Salt lakes may
ſometimes be produced by inundations from the
ſea, as that at Harlem, and ſeveral others, in
Holland, to which no other origin can be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
The ſea, likewiſe, by abandoning certain
lands, may have left lakes in the low grounds
of particular countries, and which continue to
be maintained by the rains. Of this kind, there
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0195400701:367"/>
are ſmall lakes in Europe, as in Ireland, in Jut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
in Italy, in the country of the Griſons,
in Poland, in Muſcovy, in Finland, and in
Greece: But all theſe are of little conſideration.
In Aſia, near the Euphrates, in the deſart of Irac,
there is one above 15 leagues long; another in
Perſia, nearly of the ſame extent, upon which
are ſituated the towns of Kelat, Tetuan, Vaſtan,
and Van; a ſmall one in Chorazan, near Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior;
another in Independent Tartary, called
<hi>Lake Levi</hi>; two in Muſcovite Tartary; one in
Cochinchina; and, in ſine, a pretty large one
not far from Nankin. This laſt, however,
Communicates with the neighbouring ſea by a
canal of conſiderable extent. In Africa, there
is a ſmall lake of this ſpecies in the kingdom of
Morocco; another near Alexandria, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to have been left by the ſea; another, 8
or 10 leagues long, formed by the rain-water,
in the deſart of Azarad, about the 30th degree
of latitude; another, ſtill larger, upon which is
ſituated the town of Gaoga, under the 27th de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
another, but much ſmaller, near the town
of Kanum, under the 30th degree; one near the
mouth of the river Gambia; ſeveral others in
Congo, about the 2d or 3d degree of ſouth lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
two others in the country of the Caffres;
one of them, called <hi>Lake Ruſumbo,</hi> is not very
extenſive; and the other, which lies in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of Arbuta, is perhaps the largeſt of this
kind, being about 25 leagues long, and 7 or
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0195400701:368"/>
8 broad: There is likewiſe one of theſe lakes
near the eaſt coaſt of Madagaſcar, about the
29th degree of ſouth latitude.</p>
               <p>In America, there is one of theſe lakes ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the middle of the peninſula of Florida,
which has an iſland called <hi>Serrope</hi> in its centre.
The lake near the town of Mexico, which is
round, and about 10 leagues in diameter, belongs
likewiſe to this ſpecies. There is another ſtill
more extenſive in New Spain, about 25 leagues
from the eaſtern coaſt of the bay of Campeachy;
and another, of ſmaller dimenſions, in the ſame
country, near the coaſt of the South Sea. Some
travellers have affirmed, that, in the interior
parts of Guiana, there is a very large lake of
this ſpecies, which they call <hi>Golden Lake,</hi> or
<hi>Lake Parima</hi>; and they have given marvellous
accounts of the riches of the neighbouring coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and of the great quantities of gold duſt
found in this lake, which they alledge to be
more than 400 leagues in length, and above
125 in breadth; no river, it is ſaid, either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into, or iſſues from it. Though this lake
be laid down in ſeveral maps, its exiſtence is
ſtill problematical.</p>
               <p>But the moſt common and the moſt extenſive
lakes are thoſe which both receive and give riſe
to rivers: As they are exceedingly numerous, I
ſhall only mention the largeſt, or the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
of them. Beginning with Europe,
we have, in Switzerland, the Lake of Geneva,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0195400701:369"/>
that of Conſtance, &amp;c. In Hungary, Lake Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laton,
and another, of equal extent, in Livonia,
which ſeparates this province from Ruſſia; Lake
Lapwert in Finland, which is very long, and
divides into ſeveral branches, and Lake Oula,
which is of a circular figure: In Muſcovy, Lake
Ladoga, which is more than 25 leagues long,
and above 12 broad; Lake Onega, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
long, but leſs in breadth; Lake Ilmen;
Lake Belozero, which is one of the ſources of the
Wolga; Lake Iwan-Oſero, which is one of the
ſources of the Don; and two other lakes, from
which the river Vitzogda derives its origin: In
Lapland, the lake from which iſſues the river
Kimi; another much larger, and ſituated near
the coaſt of Wardhus; and ſeveral others of
leſs note, which give riſe to the rivers Lula,
Pitha, and Uma: In Norway, two lakes nearly
of the ſame dimenſions with thoſe of Lapland:
In Sweden, Lake Vener, which is as large as
Lake Meller, upon which Stockholm is ſituated;
and two leſs conſiderable, one near Elvedal, and
the other near Lincopin.</p>
               <p>In Siberia and in Muſcovite and Independent
Tartary, there are a great number of theſe lakes,
of which the principal are, the great lake Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,
which is more than 100 leagues long, and
of which the waters fall into the Irtis; the great
lake Eſtraguel the ſource of the Irtis; ſeveral
leſſer ones, the ſources of the Jeniſca; the great
lake Kita, the ſource of the Oby; another great
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0195400701:370"/>
lake, the ſource of the Angara; Lake Baical,
which is more than 70 leagues long, and is
formed by the river Angara; and Lake Pehu,
the ſource of the Urack, &amp;c. In China and
Chineſe Tartary, we have Lake Dalai, the ſource
of the great river Argus, which falls into the
Amour; the lake of the Three Mountains, the
ſource of the river Helum, which falls likewiſe
into the Amour; the lakes of Cinhal, Cokmor,
and Sorama, the ſources of the river Hoamho;
two large lakes in the neighbourhood of Nankin,
&amp;c. In Tonquin is the Guadag, a lake of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
magnitude. In India, we have Lake
Chiamat, which is the ſource of the river La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quia,
and lies near the ſources of the Ava, the
Longenu, &amp;c. This lake is more than 50 leagues
long, and about 40 broad. The ſource of the
Ganges is another lake; and one near Caſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
gives riſe to the Indus, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In Africa there are Lake Cayar, and two or
three others, near the mouth of the Senegal;
Lake Guarda, and Lake Sigiſmus, which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
make a triangular lake of 100 leagues long,
and 75 broad, and contain a conſiderable iſland.
It is in this lake that the Niger loſes its name,
and, at its exit, aſſumes that of <hi>Senegal.</hi> In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
towards the courſe of this river, we
meet with another pretty large lake called <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou,</hi>
where the Niger again changes its name;
for the river that falls into this lake is called
<hi>Gombaru.</hi> At the ſources of the Nile in Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0195400701:371"/>
is the great lake Gambia, which is above
50 leagues long. On the coaſt of Guiney are
alſo ſeveral lakes, which appear to have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
formed by the ſea; and there are few
others in Africa of any conſideration.</p>
               <p>North America is the country of lakes. The
moſt extenſive of them are, Lake Superior, which
is about 125 leagues long, and 50 broad; Lake
Huron, which is near 100 leagues in length, and
about 40 in breadth; Lake Illionois, which,
comprehending the bay of Puants, is nearly as
extenſive as Lake Huron; Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario, which together, exceed 80 leagues in
length, by 20 or 25 in breadth; Lake Miſtaſin,
to the north of Quebec, is about 50 leagues long;
Lake Champlain, to the ſouth of Quebec, is
nearly of equal length; Lake Alemipigon, and
Lake Chriſtinaux, both to the north of Lake
Superior, are likewiſe conſiderable; the Lake of
the Aſſmiboils contains ſeveral iſlands, and is
more than 75 leagues long: Beſides the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
Gulf, there are two conſiderable lakes in
that country; that called Nicaragua, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of the ſame name, is about 70 leagues in
length.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, in South America, there is a ſmall
lake, the ſource of the Maragnon; a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive
one gives riſe to the river Paraguay:
There are, beſides Lake Titicares, the waters of
which fall into the river Plata; two leſſer ones,
which diſcharge their waters into the ſame ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0195400701:372"/>
and ſome inconſiderable ones in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
parts of Chili.</p>
               <p>All lakes that give riſe to rivers, and all thoſe
which occur in the courſe of rivers, or which
border upon and diſcharge their waters into ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
are not ſalt. Almoſt all thoſe, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
which receive rivers, but give riſe to none,
are ſalt. This circumſtance ſeems to favour the
opinion, that the ſaltneſs of the ſea is occaſioned
by the ſalts brought down from the land by the
rivers; for we find ſalt does not evaporate; and,
of courſe, all that is tranſported by the rivers
remains in the ſea: Although the water of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
appears to be freſh, it is well known, that
it contains a ſmall quantity of ſalt, which, in the
courſe of ages, might accumulate to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
as would be ſufficient to produce the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſaltneſs of the ſea, and which muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
augmenting. It is in this manner, I
preſume, the Caſpian, Lake Aral, and the Black
Sea, have become ſalt. With regard to thoſe
ſeas, which, like marſhes, or ſwamps, neither
receive nor diſcharge rivers, they are either ſalt
or freſh, according to their origin. Thoſe in
the neighbourhood of the ſea are commonly
ſalt; and thoſe at a diſtance from it are freſh;
becauſe the former have originated from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations
of the ſea, and the latter from freſh
fountains.</p>
               <p>The waters of the Dead Sea contain a great deal
of the bitumen of Judea, which is nothing but
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0195400701:373"/>
aſphaltes; and, accordingly, this ſea is often
termed the <hi>Aſphaltic Lake.</hi> The neighbouring
land is impregnated with this bitumen: And
many have imagined, like the Lake Avernus,
no fiſh could live in it, and that birds were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated
in attempting to fly over it. But ſuch
diſmal effects are produced by neither of theſe
lakes; for both of them contain fiſhes, the birds
fly over them in ſafety, and men bathe in them
with impunity.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, that, in Bohemia, there is a lake,
which has holes in it ſo deep, that they cannot
be ſounded, and that, from theſe holes, there
iſſue violent winds which ſweep over all Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,
and, in winter, raiſe into the air maſſes of
ice of more than 100 pounds weight<note n="*" place="bottom">See Act. Leipſ. anno 1682, p. 246.</note>. We
are likewiſe told of a petrifying lake in Iceland;
and Lake Neagh in Ireland poſſeſſes the ſame
quality. But theſe petrifications are, doubtleſs,
nothing but incruſtations ſimilar to thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the waters at Arcueil.</p>

               <head>Of the Tides.</head>
               <p>WATER, like other fluids, naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
from the higher to the lower
grounds, if not prevented by ſome interpoſed
obſtacle; and, after it has occupied the loweſt
ſituation, it remains ſmooth and tranquil, unleſs
diſturbed by ſome foreign cauſe. All the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the ocean are collected in the loweſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
upon the ſurface of the earth; and hence
the motions of the ſea muſt proceed from cauſes
that are external. The chief motion is that of
the tides, which riſe and fall alternately, and
from which reſults a general and perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in all ſeas, from eaſt to weſt. Theſe two
motions have an invariable relation to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0195400701:375"/>
of the moon. During the full and new
moons, this motion from eaſt to weſt is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
as well as that of the tides, which ebb
and ſlow, upon moſt coaſts, every 6½ hours: It
is always high tide when the moon arrives at
the meridian, either above or below the horizon
of the place; and it is always ebb or low tide
when the moon is at the greateſt diſtance from
the meridian, or when it riſes and ſets. The
motion from eaſt to weſt is perpetual; becauſe,
when the tide is riſing, the whole ocean moves
from eaſt to weſt, and puſhes weſtward an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
body of water; and the ebbing, or reflux,
appears only to be owing to the ſmaller quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of water which is then impelled towards
the weſt. The flux, therefore, ought rather to
be regarded as a ſwelling, and the reflux as the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the waters, which, in place of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing
the motion from eaſt to weſt, is the
cauſe which produces and renders it perpetual;
though this motion, for the reaſon already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
is greater during the flux than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux.</p>
               <p>This motion is attended with the following
circumſtances: 1<hi>ſt,</hi> It is more ſenſible at the full
and new moon than at the quadratures; it is
likewiſe more violent in ſpring and autumn than
in any other ſeaſon; and it is weakeſt at the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices.
This phaenomenon in occaſioned by the
combined attractions of the moon and ſun.
2<hi>d,</hi> The direction and quantity of this motion
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0195400701:376"/>
is often varied by the winds, eſpecially ſuch as
blow conſtantly from the ſame quarter. Great
rivers, in like manner, by diſcharging their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the ſea, produce currents which often
extend ſeveral leagues, and are ſtrongeſt when
the direction of the wind correſponds with the
general motion. Of this an example is afforded
in the Pacific Ocean, where the motion from
eaſt to weſt is conſtant, and very perceptible.
3<hi>d,</hi> It is worthy of remark, that, when one part
of a fluid is moved, the motion is communicated
to the whole: During the tides, therefore, a
great part of the ocean is ſenſibly put in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and, conſequently, the whole ocean, from
ſurface to bottom, is moved at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>To render this more clear, let us attend to the
cauſes which produce the tides. We formerly
remarked, that the moon acted upon the earth
by a force which ſome call attraction, and others
gravity. This force penetrates the whole globe,
is exactly proportioned to the quantity of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and decreaſes as the ſquares of the diſtances
increaſe. Let us next examine what effects
this force muſt produce upon the waters when
the moon comes to the meridian of any place.
The ſurface of the water immediately under the
moon is then nearer that planet than any other
part of the earth; of courſe, that part of the ſea
muſt be elevated towards the moon, and the
ſummit of this eminence muſt be oppoſite to the
moon's center. To produce this eminence, the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0195400701:377"/>
waters upon the ſurface, as well as thoſe at the
bottom, contribute their ſhare, in proportion to
their diſtances from the moon, which acts upon
them in the inverſe ratio of the ſquares of their
diſtances. Thus the ſurface of this part of the
ſea is firſt elevated; the ſurface of the adjacent
parts is likewiſe elevated, but in a ſmaller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
and the waters at the bottom of all theſe
parts are raiſed by the ſame cauſe. Hence, as
the whole portion of water under the moon is
raiſed, the waters at a diſtance, upon which no
attraction is exerted, muſt neceſſarily ruſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with precipitation to ſupply the place of
thoſe which were elevated, or drawn towards
the moon. It is in this manner that the flux,
or high tide, is produced, which is more or leſs
ſenſible on different coaſts, and which agitates
the ſea, not only at the ſurface, but at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
depths. The reflux, or ebb, is a conſequence
of the natural diſpoſition of the water, which,
when no longer acted upon by the moon, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
and returns to occupy thoſe ſhores from
which it had been forced to retire by a foreign
power. The ſame effect is produced when the
moon arrives at the antipode, or oppoſite meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
but for a different reaſon: In the firſt caſe,
the waters riſe, becauſe they are nearer the moon
than any other part of the globe; and, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
they riſe, becauſe the moon is at the greateſt
diſtance from them. It is eaſy to perceive that the
effect muſt be the ſame; for, the waters here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0195400701:378"/>
leſs attracted than thoſe of the oppoſite he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere,
they will neceſſarily recede, and form
an eminence, the higheſt point of which will be
where the attraction is leaſt, that is, in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
oppoſite to the moon's ſtation, or to the
place where ſhe was thirteen hours before.
When the moon comes to the horizon, the tide
is ebb, and the ſea is in its natural ſtate of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium.
But, when ſhe is in the oppoſite meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
this equilibrium cannot exiſt; for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
at the place oppoſite to the moon, being
then at their great diſtance from her, they are
leſs attracted than the reſt of the globe; and
hence their relative gravity, by which they are
conſtantly kept in equilibrium, puſhes them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the point oppoſite to the moon, in order
to preſerve this equilibrium. Thus, in both
caſes, when the moon is in the meridian of a
place, or in the oppoſite meridian, the waters
muſt be elevated nearly to the ſame height; and,
conſequently, they muſt ebb or flow back when
the moon is in the horizon, either at her riſing
or ſetting. A motion, ſuch as we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
neceſſarily agitates the whole maſs of
the ocean, from its ſurface to its bottom; and,
as the bottom is leſs affected by winds than the
ſurface, the motion produced in the former, by
the tides, is more regular and uniform.</p>
               <p>From this alternate ebbing and flowing, there
reſults, as already remarked, a conſtant motion
of the ſea from eaſt to weſt; for the moon,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0195400701:379"/>
which is the cauſe of the tides, moves from eaſt
to weſt, and, by acting ſucceſſively in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
ſhe draws the waters after her. This
motion is moſt perceptible in ſtraits. At the
ſtraits of Magellan, for example, the tides riſe
near 20 feet, and they continue at this height
ſix hours; but the reflux, or ebbing, laſts only
two hours, and the waters run to the weſt<note n="*" place="bottom">See Narborough's voyages.</note>.
This inconteſtibly proves, that the reflux is not
equal to the flux, and that, from both, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
a motion to the weſt, which is ſtronger du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the flux than the reflux. It is for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that, in open ſeas, at great diſtances from
land, the tides are only rendered perceptible by
this general current of the waters from eaſt to
weſt.</p>
               <p>The tides are much higher between the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics
than in any other part of the ocean. They
likewiſe riſe higher in places that ſtretch from
eaſt to weſt, in long and narrow bays, and upon
coaſts which are interrupted with iſlands and
promontories. The higheſt known tides take
place at one of the mouths of the Indus, where
they riſe 30 feet perpendicular. They have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
a remarkable elevation at Malaya, in the
ſtraits of the Sund, in the Red Sea, in Nelſon's
bay, at the mouth of the river St Laurence, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the coaſts of China and Japan, at Panama, in
the gulf of Bengal, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:0195400701:380"/>
The ſea's motion, from eaſt to weſt, is moſt
obſervable in particular places. Voyagers have
often remarked it in ſailing from India to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagaſcar
and Africa. It moves alſo with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
force in the Pacific ocean, and between
the Moluccas and Brazil: But it is moſt violent
in ſtraits: The waters are carried from eaſt to
weſt, through the ſtraits of Magellan, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
with ſuch rapidity, that their motion is
perceptible, at a great diſtance, in the Atlantic
ocean. It was this circumſtance, it is ſaid, that
made Magellan conjecture that a ſtrait exiſted
by which there was a communication with the
two ſeas. In the ſtraits formed by the Manillas,
in the channels between the Maldiva iſlands, and
in the gulf of Mexico, between Cuba and Juca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
there is a conſtant current from eaſt to weſt.
This motion, in the gulf of Paria, is ſo violent,
that its ſtrait is called the <hi>Dragon's Mouth.</hi> It
is likewiſe violent in the ſea of Canada, in that
of Tartary, and in Waigait's ſtraits, through
which it forces enormous maſſes of ice into the
northern ſeas. The Pacific ocean runs from eaſt
to weſt through the ſtraits of Japan; the ſea of
Japan runs towards China; and the Indian
ocean runs weſtward through the ſtraits of Java,
and other iſlands of India. It is, therefore, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the ſea has a general and uniform
motion from eaſt to weſt; and, it is certain, that
the Atlantic runs towards America, and that the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0195400701:381"/>
Pacific ocean flies from it, as is apparent at Cape
Current between Lima and Panama<note n="*" place="bottom">See Varen. Geog. p. 119.</note>.</p>
               <p>In fine, the tides riſe and fall alternately in
ſix hours and a half upon moſt coaſts, though
they happen at different hours, according to the
climate, and the poſition of particular lands.
Thus the coaſts of the ſea are perpetually beat
by the waves; and each tide carries off from the
higher grounds ſmall quantities of matter, and
depoſites them, at a diſtance, on the bottom of
the ocean. In the ſame manner, each tide car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in, and depoſites upon low coaſts, ſand,
ſhells, and other ſea-bodies, which gradually
form horizontal ſtrata, and give riſe to downs,
and little hills, ſimilar to other hills, both in
their figure and internal ſtructure. Thus the
ſea is conſtantly encroaching upon high coaſts,
and loſing ground upon thoſe that are low.</p>
               <p>To give an idea of the violent effects of a
ſtormy ſea againſt a high coaſt, I ſhall relate a
fact atteſted by an eye-witneſs, a perſon worthy
of the higheſt credit. In the largeſt of the Ork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
iſlands, there are coaſts compoſed of ſolid
rock, above 200 feet high, and nearly perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
to the ſurface of the water. The tides, as
is uſual in iſlands and promontories, riſe very
high at this place. But, when a violent wind
concurs with the flow of the tide, the agitation
of the waters is ſo great, that they often riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
theſe rocks, and fall down in the form of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0195400701:382"/>
rain: Nay, to this amazing height, gravel, and
ſtones as large as a man's fiſt, are raiſed from
the foot of the rocks.</p>
               <p>I myſelf ſaw, in the port of Livourne, where
the ſea is much more tranquil, a tempeſt in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember
1731, which obliged the mariners to cut
off the maſts of their veſſels, which were driven,
by the violence of the wind, from their anchors
in the road: The waters of the ſea ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
fortifications of a great height; and,
as I was upon one of the moſt advanced works,
before I could reach the town, I was more
drenched with ſea-water than I could have been
by the heavieſt rain.</p>
               <p>Theſe examples may convey a notion of the
violence with which the ſea acts againſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
coaſts. This conſtant agitation gradually
wears<note n="*" place="bottom">We are told by Shaw, in his travels, that, in many parts on the coaſt of Syria and Phoenicia, the rocks had been cut, by the antients, into troughs of two or three yards long, and broad in proportion, for the purpoſe of making ſalt by evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But, notwithſtanding the hardneſs of the rocks, theſe troughs are now almoſt totally obliterated by the agitation of the waves.</note>, corrodes, excavates, and diminiſhes the
quantity of the land. All theſe materials are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
and depoſited in places where the ſea is
more tranquil. In the time of ſtorms, the water is
foul and muddy, by the admixture of matters
detached from the coaſts and from the bottom
of the ſea. Theſe bodies, which are very vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and carried from great diſtances, are thrown
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0195400701:383"/>
upon the low ſhores, eſpecially after tempeſts,
as ambergris on the weſt of Ireland, yellow am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
upon the coaſts of Pomerania, cocoas upon
the coaſts of India, &amp;c. and ſometimes pumice,
and other ſingular ſtones. On this occaſion, we
may quote a paſſage from the New Voyages to
the iſlands of America. 'When at St Domingo,'
ſays the author, 'I was preſented, among other
things, with ſome light ſtones, brought in by
the ſea in high ſouth winds: Some of them
were two and a half feet long, 18 inches broad,
and about a foot thick; and yet they weighed
not above five pounds. They were as white
as ſnow, harder than pumice, of a fine grain,
and appeared not to be porous. When, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
they were thrown into water, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
like a foot-ball thrown againſt the
ground. It was difficult to force them under
water with the hand. I incloſed two of theſe
ſtones with thin boards, and found that they
bore 160 pounds without ſinking. They ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
my negro for a ſhallop on which he divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf in failing about the quay<note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. 1. p. 260.</note>.' This
ſtone muſt have been a pumice of a cloſe fine
grain, which had been tranſported by the ſea
from the neighbourhood of ſome volcano, in the
ſame manner as ambergris, cocoas, common pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mice,
the ſeeds of plants, reeds, &amp;c. are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.
It is chiefly on the coaſts of Ireland
and of Scotland that obſervations of this kind
have been made. The ſea, by its general mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0195400701:384"/>
from eaſt to weſt, ought to carry to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
the productions of our coaſts; and, it muſt
be by the operation of ſome irregular move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that the productions of the Eaſt and Weſt
Indias, and of the northern regions, are brought
upon our coaſts. The winds are probably the
cauſe of thoſe effects. In open ſeas, and at great
diſtances from land, large portions of the water
have been ſeen totally covered with pumice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones.
They could only come from volcano's
in iſlands, or on the continent; and they have
probably been tranſported to the open ſeas by
currents. Before the ſouth part of America was
diſcovered, and when it was not believed that
the Indian ocean had any communication with
ours, appearances of this kind firſt gave riſe to
the ſuſpicion that ſuch a communication was not
impoſſible.</p>
               <p>The alternate motion of the tides, and the
uniform motion of the ſea from eaſt to weſt,
exhibit different appearances in different climates,
according to the different indentations in the
land, and the height of the coaſts. In ſome
places the motion from eaſt to weſt is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible;
at others, it moves in a contrary direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as on the coaſt of Guiney. But theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
motions are occaſioned by the winds, by
the poſition of the land, by the waters of great
rivers, and by the diſpoſition of the bottom of
the ſea. All theſe cauſes produce currents,
which often change the direction of the general
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0195400701:385"/>
movement. But, as this motion from eaſt to
weſt is the greateſt, moſt general, and conſtant,
it ought to produce the moſt ſignal effects; and,
upon the whole, the ſea muſt gradually gain
ground on the weſt, and loſe it on the eaſt; and,
although, upon coaſts where the weſt wind blows
during the greateſt part of the year, as in France
and Britain, the ſea may gain land on the eaſt;
yet theſe exceptions deſtroy not the effect of the
general cauſe.</p>

Currents.</head>
               <p>THE coaſts of the ſea may be divided
into three kinds: 1. High coaſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of hard rocks, commonly perpendicular,
and of a conſiderable elevation, riſing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to the height of 700 or 800 feet. 2.
Low coaſts, of which ſome are almoſt level with
the ſurface of the water, and others have a ſmall
elevation, and are often bordered with rocks
nearly of a level with the water, which give
riſe to breakers, and render the approach of ſhips
exceedingly dangerous. 3. Downs, or coaſts
formed by ſand, either accumulated by the ſea,
or brought down and depoſited by rivers: Theſe
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0195400701:387"/>
downs form hills of more or leſs elevation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to circumſtances.</p>
               <p>The coaſts of Italy are lined with marble and
rocks of different ſpecies. Thoſe rocks ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
at a diſtance like perpendicular pillars of
marble. The coaſts of France, from Breſt to
Bourdeaux, conſiſt almoſt entirely of rocks on
a level with the ſea, which occaſion breakers.
The coaſts of England, of Spain, and of many
other places, are bordered with rocks and hard
ſtones, excepting particular ſpots which are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
as roads and harbours.</p>
               <p>The depth of the water along the coaſts is
generally proportioned to their elevation; a high
coaſt indicates a deep water; and, on low coaſts,
the water is commonly ſhallow. The inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
at the bottom of the ſea near the coaſts
likewiſe correſpond with the inequalities in the
ſurface of the ground along the ſhore. This
ſubject is illuſtrated in the following manner by
a celebrated voyager.</p>
               <p>'I have made it my general obſervation, that,
where the land is fenced with ſteep rocks and
cliffs againſt the ſea, there the ſea is very deep,
and ſeldom affords anchor-ground; and, on
the other ſide, where the land falls away with
a declivity into the ſea, (although the land be
extraordinary high within,) yet there are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
good ſoundings, and conſequently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choring;
and, as the viſible declivity of the
land appears near, or at the edge of the water,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0195400701:388"/>
whether pretty ſteep, or more ſloping, ſo we
commonly find our anchor-ground to be more
or leſs deep or ſteep; therefore we come near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the ſhore, or anchor farther off, as we ſee
convenient; for there is no coaſt in the world,
that I know, or have heard of, where the land
is of a continual height, without ſome ſmall
vallies or declivities, which lie intermixed with
the high land. They are the ſubſiding of val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
or low lands, that make dents in the ſhore
and creeks, ſmall bays, and harbours, or little
coves, &amp;c. which afford good anchoring, the
ſurface of the earth being there lodged deep
under water. Thus we find many good har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
on ſuch coaſts, where the land bounds
the ſea with ſteep cliffs, by reaſon of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivities,
or ſubſiding of the land between theſe
cliffs: But, where the declenſion from the hills
or cliffs is not within land, between hill and
hill, but, as on the coaſt of Chili and Peru, the
declivity is toward the main ſea, or into it, the
coaſt being perpendicular, or very ſteep from
the neighbouring hills, as in thoſe countries
from the Andes, that run along the ſhore,
there is a deep ſea, and few or no harbours or
creeks. All that coaſt is too ſteep for anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and hath the feweſt roads fit for ſhips
of any coaſt I know. The coaſts of Gallicia,
Portugal, Norway, and Newfoundland, &amp;c.
are coaſts like the Peruvian, and the high
iſlands of the Archipelago; but yet not ſo
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0195400701:389"/>
ſcanty of good harbours; for, where there are
ſhort ridges of land, there are good bays at
the extremities of thoſe ridges, where they
plunge into the ſea; as on the coaſt of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raccos,
&amp;c. The iſland of John Ferdinando,
and the iſland of St Helena, &amp;c. are ſuch high
land with deep ſhore: And, in general, the
plunging of any land under water, ſeems to
be in proportion to the riſing of its continuous
part above water, more or leſs ſteep; and it
muſt be a bottom almoſt level, or very gently
declining, that affords good anchoring, ſhips
being ſoon driven from their moorings on a
ſteep bank; therefore, we never ſtrive to anchor
where we ſee the land high, and bounding the
ſea with ſteep cliffs; and, for this reaſon, when
we came in ſight of States-Iſland, near Terra
del Fuego, before we entered into the South-Seas,
we did not ſo much as think of anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after we ſaw what land it was, becauſe of
the ſteep cliffs which appeared againſt the ſea;
yet there might be little harbours or coves for
ſhallops, or the like, to anchor in, which we
did not ſee, or ſearch after.'</p>
               <p>'As high ſteep cliffs bounding on the ſea
have this ill conſequence, that they ſeldom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
anchoring; ſo they have this benefit, that
we can ſee them far off, and fail cloſe to them,
without danger; for which reaſon we call
them bold ſhores; whereas low land, on the
contrary, is ſeen but a little way, and in many
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0195400701:390"/>
places we dare not come near it, for fear of
running a-ground before we ſee it. Beſides,
there are, in many places, ſhoals thrown out
by the courſe of great rivers, that from the
low land fall into the ſea.'</p>
               <p>'This which I have ſaid, that there is uſually
good anchoring near low lands, may be illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
by ſeveral inſtances. Thus, on the
ſouth ſide of the bay of Campeachy, there is
moſtly low land, and there alſo is good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choring
all along ſhore; and, in ſome places
to the eaſtward of the town of Campeachy,
we ſhall have ſo many fathom as we are leagues
off from land; that is, from 9 or 10 leagues
diſtance, till you come within 4 leagues; and
from thence to land it grows but ſhallower.
The bay of Honduras alſo is low land, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
moſtly ſo, as we paſſed along from thence
to the coaſts of Portobel, and Cartagena, till
we came as high as Santa Martha; afterwards
the land is low again, till you come towards
the coaſt of Caraccos, which is a high coaſt
and bold ſhore. The land about Surinam, on
the ſame coaſt, is low and good anchoring, and
that over on the coaſt of Guinea is ſuch alſo.
And ſuch, too, is the bay of Panama, where
the pilot-book orders the pilot always to ſound,
and not to come within ſuch a depth, be it by
night or day. In the ſame ſeas, from the high
land of Guatimala in Mexico, to California,
there is moſtly low land and good anchoring.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0195400701:391"/>
In the main of Aſia, the coaſt of China, the
bay of Siam and Bengal, and all the coaſt of
Coromandel, and the coaſt about Malacca, and
againſt it the iſland of Sumatra, on that ſide,
are moſtly low anchoring ſhores. But, on the
weſt ſide of Sumatra, the ſhore is high and
bold; ſo moſt of the iſlands lying to the
eaſtward of Sumatra; as the iſlands Borneo,
Celebes, Gilolo, and abundance of iſlands of
leſs note, lying ſcattering up and down thoſe
ſeas, are low land, and have good anchoring
about them; with many ſhoals ſcattered to and
fro among them; but the iſlands lying againſt the
Eaſt-Indian Ocean, eſpecially the weſt ſides of
them, are high land and ſteep, particularly the
weſt parts, not only of Sumatra, but alſo of
Java, Timor, &amp;c. Particulars are endleſs;
but, in general, 'tis ſeldom but high ſhores and
deep waters, and, on the other ſide, low land
and ſhallow ſeas are found together<note n="*" place="bottom">Dampier's Voyages, vol. 1. p. 422. 423. 424. 425.</note>.'</p>
               <p>It is, therefore, fully eſtabliſhed by the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of navigators, that there are, in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the ſea, conſiderable mountains, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inequalities. We are alſo aſſured by the
teſtimony of divers, that there are ſmaller ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities
occaſioned by rocks, and that the cold
is greateſt in the hollows or valleys. In general,
as formerly remarked, the depths of open ſeas
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in proportion to their diſtance from
the coaſts. It appears, from M. Buache's
chart of that part of the ocean which lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0195400701:392"/>
the coaſts of Africa and America, and
from the draughts he has given us of the ſea
from Cape Tagrin to Rio-grand, that the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the ocean is as irregular as the ſurface
of the land; that Abrolhos, where there are
<hi>vigies,</hi> and where ſome of the rocks are on a
level with the water, are only the tops of large
and high mountains, of which Dolphin iſland
is one of the moſt elevated points; that the Cape
de Verd iſlands are likewiſe the tops of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
and that all round theſe abrolhos and
iſlands, the depth of the ſea is unfathomable.</p>
               <p>With regard to the qualities of the different
ſoils at the bottom of the ſea, little can be ſaid
with preciſion, as all our knowledge is derived
from ſounding and from divers. We on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know, that ſome places are covered with
ſlime and mud of a conſiderable thickneſs, in
which anchors can have no hold: It is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that, in theſe places, the mud is depoſited by
rivers. Other parts are covered with ſand of
different kinds, ſimilar to thoſe upon land. In
others are heaps of ſhells, madrepores, corals,
and other productions of inſects, juſt beginning
to unite and to aſſume the form of ſtones: In
others, we find fragments of ſtones, gravel, and
frequently ſtones and marbles compleatly from<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In the Maldiva iſlands, for example, they
build their houſes with a hard ſtone raiſed from
ſome fathoms under water. At Marſeilles very
good marble is raiſed from the bottom of the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0195400701:393"/>
ſea, which is ſo far from waſting or deſtroying
ſtones and marble, that, as ſhall be proved in
our diſcourſe on minerals, it creates and preſerves
them: It is the ſun, the earth, the air, and the
rains, which alone corrupt and deſtroy theſe
ſubſtances.</p>
               <p>The bottom of the ſea muſt be compoſed of
the ſame materials as the ſurface of the earth
which we inhabit, ſince the very ſame ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are found on both. At the bottom of ſome
parts of the ocean are vaſt collections of ſhells,
madrepores, and corals; and we find, upon
land, numberleſs quarries, banks of chalk, and
of other ſubſtances, mixed with the ſame ſhells,
madrepores, and corals; ſo that, in every view,
the dry parts of this globe reſemble thoſe cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the waters, both in compoſition of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,
and in ſuperficial inequalities.</p>
               <p>To theſe inequalities at the bottom, we muſt
aſcribe the origin of currents; for, if the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
were uniform and level, there could be no
current but the general motion from eaſt to
weſt, and ſuch as might occaſionally be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the winds. But what inconteſtibly
proves, that moſt currents are produced by the
tides, and take their direction from inequalities
at the bottom, is, that they uniformly follow
the tides, and change their courſe at every ebb
and flow<note n="*" place="bottom">See Pietro della Valle on the currents in the Gulf of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baia, vol. 6. p. 363.</note>. This is confirmed by the teſtimony
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0195400701:394"/>
of all navigators, who unanimouſly affirm, that,
in thoſe places where the tides are moſt impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the currents are likewiſe moſt rapid.</p>
               <p>Thus it is apparent, that the tides give riſe to
currents, and that they always follow the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the oppoſite hills or mountains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
which they run. Currents produced by
winds likewiſe obſerve the direction of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences
concealed under the waters; for they
ſeldom run in the direct path of the winds; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do thoſe produced by the tides invariably
obſerve the courſe pointed out by their original
cauſe.</p>
               <p>To give a diſtinct idea of the origin of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
let it be remarked, that they take place in
all ſeas; that ſome are rapid, and others
ſlow; that ſome are of great extent both in
length and breadth, and others ſhorter and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower;
that the ſame cauſe by which they are
produced, whether it be the wind or the tides,
frequently beſtows on each a difference both in
celerity and direction; that a north wind, for
example, which ought to produce a general mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
towards the ſouth, gives riſe, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
to a number of ſeparate currents, very
different both in their direction and extent, ſome
running ſouth, others ſouth-eaſt, and others
ſouth-weſt; ſome are rapid, others ſlow; ſome
long and broad, and others ſhort and narrow:
In a word, their motions are ſo various and
combined, that they loſe all reſemblance to their
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0195400701:395"/>
general cauſe. When a contrary wind blows,
every motion is uniformly reverſed; and the
courſe of the different currents is preciſely the
ſame as would neceſſarily take place between
two oppoſite and neighbouring hills upon the
ſurface of the land, were it covered with water.
Of this, the Maldiva and Indian iſlands, where
the winds blow and the currents run regularly
for ſix months in oppoſite directions, afford moſt
ſtriking examples. The ſame thing has been
remarked of currents between ſhoals and ſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks.
In general, all currents, from whatever
cauſe they proceed, have the ſame dimenſions
and the ſame direction through their whole
courſe; but they differ greatly from each other
in every reſpect. This uniformity and variety
can proceed from no other cauſe but the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities
of the hills, mountains, and vallies, at
the bottom of the ocean; for, it is an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fact, that the current between two iſlands
follows the direction of the coaſts; and the
ſame phaenomenon is exhibited between ſhoals
and ſand-banks. The hills and mountains in
the ſea, therefore, may be conſidered as the
banks which contain and direct the currents:
Hence a current is a river, the breadth of which
is determined by that of the valley through
which it runs; its rapidity is proportioned to
the force by which it is produced, combined
with the breadth of the interval through which
it paſſes; and its direction is marked out by the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0195400701:396"/>
poſition of the hills and other inequalities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
which it ſhapes its courſe.</p>
               <p>An opportunity is now afforded us of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
that ſingular correſpondence between
the angles of hills and mountains, which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
in every country of the world. We
have already remarked this uniform correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of angles in the banks of rivers. The
cauſe of this effect depends on the laws of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatics,
and might be eaſily explained. But
it is ſufficient for our preſent purpoſe, that the
fact is general, and univerſally known; and
every man may ſatisfy himſelf with his own
eyes, that, when the bank of a river projects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the land, to the left, for inſtance, the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
bank, on the contrary, makes a projection
from the land on the right.</p>
               <p>The currents of the ocean, therefore, which
ought to be regarded as large rivers, and as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the ſame laws as thoſe on land, muſt,
like them, have formed, through the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of their courſe, many ſinuoſities or wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with correſponding angles or projections:
And, as the banks of currents are hills and
mountains, either above or below the ſurface of
the water, they muſt have produced on theſe
eminences the ſame effects as our rivers do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their banks. Thus, we have no longer any
reaſon to be aſtoniſhed, that our hills and
mountains, which were formerly covered with
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0195400701:397"/>
the ſea, and formed by the ſediments of its wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſhould have aſſumed, by the motion of its
currents, this regular figure, ariſing from the
correſpondence of their oppoſite angles. They
were originally banks of currents, or of ſea-ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and neceſſarily muſt have aſſumed a figure
and direction ſimilar to thoſe of land-rivers.</p>
               <p>This alone, independent of the other proofs
which we have adduced, is a ſufficient demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
that all our preſent continents and
iſlands were formerly covered with the waters
of the ocean, and throws much light on the
theory which I have been endeavouring to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh.
It was not enough to have proved that
the internal ſtrata of the earth were formed by
ſediments of the waters; that the mountains
were elevated by ſucceſſive accumulations of theſe
ſediments; or, that many ſtrata were impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
with ſhells and other productions of the
ſea. It was ſtill neceſſary to inveſtigate and
aſſign the real cauſe of the correſpondence in
the angles of mountains, which hitherto had
never been attempted, but which, when united
with the other proofs, forms a connected chain
of evidence in ſupport of my theory, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
as the nature of phyſical reaſoning will
admit.</p>
               <p>The moſt conſpicuous currents of the ocean
are thoſe in the Atlantic near the coaſt of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
They extend from Cape Verd to the bay
of Fernandopo. They run from weſt to eaſt,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0195400701:398"/>
which is contrary to the general motion of the
ſea; and they are ſo rapid, that veſſels ſail in
two days from Moura to Rio de Benin, about
150 leagues, but require ſix or ſeven weeks to
return. It would even be impoſſible to clear
theſe latitudes, were it not by means of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous
winds which ſuddenly ariſe in them:
But there are ſometimes whole ſeaſons in which
the mariner is obliged to remain ſtationary, on
account of perpetual calms, the ſea having here
no motion but what it derives from the currents;
and theſe always run in upon the coaſts, from
which they extend not above 20 leagues. Near
the iſland of Sumatra, there are rapid currents,
which run from ſouth to north, and which have
probably given riſe to the bay between Malacca
and India. We find ſimilar currents between
Java and the lands of Magellan, and between
the Cape of Good Hope and Madagaſcar, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
on the African coaſt from Natal to the
Cape. In the Pacific ocean, upon the coaſts of
Peru, and the reſt of America, the waters move
from ſouth to north, which is probably owing
to the conſtant blowing of the ſouth wind. The
ſame motion from ſouth to north has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
on the coaſts of Braſil, from Cape St
Auguſtine to the Antilles, and from the mouth
of the Manilla ſtraits to the Philippines and
Japan<note n="*" place="bottom">See Varen. Geogr. p. 140.</note>.</p>

                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:0195400701:399"/>
There are violent currents in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of the Maldiva iſlands; and between theſe
iſlands, as already obſerved, the currents run al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately
in oppoſite directions ſix months in the
year, and are probably occaſioned by the trade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds.</p>
               <p>We only here enumerate ſuch currents as are
remarkable both for their extent and their rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity;
becauſe the number of leſſer currents is
almoſt infinite. The tides, the winds, and every
cauſe that agitates the waters, produce currents,
which are more or leſs perceptible in different
places. We have already remarked, that the
bottom of the ſea is, like the land, interſected
with mountains and vallies, ſhoals and ſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks.
In all the mountainous places, the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
muſt neceſſarily be violent; and, where
the bottom is ſmooth and level, they are almoſt
imperceptible; for the rapidity of a current muſt
augment in proportion to the obſtacles the water
meets with. The current between two chains
of mountains will be more or leſs violent in
proportion to their diſtance. The ſame thing
muſt happen between two banks of ſand, or two
adjacent iſlands. It is, accordingly, remarkable,
that, in the Indian ocean, which is interſected
with an innumerable quantity of iſlands and
ſand-banks, there are every where currents,
which, by their rapidity, render navigation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
dangerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:0195400701:400"/>
Currents are not only occaſioned by inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
at the bottom; but a ſimilar effect is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the coaſts, from which the waters are
repelled to greater or leſs diſtances. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorging
of the waters may be rendered perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and violent by particular circumſtances: An
oblique poſition, for example, of a coaſt, its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguity
to a bay or a great river, a promontory,
or any particular obſtacle to the general move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the waters, will always give riſe to a
current: Now, as nothing is more irregular than
the bottom and the coaſts of the ſea, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of currents that every where appear ought
not to create ſurpriſe.</p>
               <p>All currents have a determinate breadth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to the interval between the two emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences
which limit them. They run in the ſame
manner as land-rivers; they form a channel,
and cut their banks in a regular manner, with
correſponding angles: In fine, the currents of
the ocean have ſcooped out our valleys, ſhaped
our mountains, and beſtowed upon the land,
while it remained under the ſurface of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the form under which it now appears.</p>
               <p>If any doubt ſhould remain concerning the
correſpondence in the angles of mountains, I
appeal to the teſtimony of every man's obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Every traveller may remark this corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
in oppoſite hills. When a hill makes
a projection to the right, the oppoſite one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
recedes to the left. Beſides, in oppoſite
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0195400701:401"/>
hills ſeparated by vallies, there is rarely any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in their height. The more I obſerve
the contours and elevations of hills, I am the
more convinced of the correſpondence of their
angles, and of their reſemblance to the channels
and banks of rivers. It was the repeated obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of this ſurpriſing regularity and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
that firſt ſuggeſted the idea of the theory
of the earth which I am now ſupporting. When
to this are added the paralleliſm of the ſtrata,
and the ſhells ſo univerſally incorporated with
different materials, no ſubject of this nature can
admit of a greater degree of probability.</p>

               <p>IN our climates, nothing can appear to be
more capricious and irregular than the force
and direction of the winds. But there are ſome
countries where this irregularity is not ſo great,
and others where the wind blows conſtantly in
the ſame direction, and with nearly the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of force.</p>
               <p>Though the motions of the air depend on
many cauſes; yet there are ſome more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
and powerful than others; but it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to eſtimate their preciſe effects, becauſe theſe
are often modified by ſecondary cauſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:0195400701:403"/>
The heat of the ſun is the moſt powerful
cauſe of winds: It produces a conſiderable and
ſucceſſive rarefaction in the different parts of
the atmoſphere, and gives riſe to an eaſt-wind,
which blows conſtantly between the Tropics,
where the rarefaction is greateſt.</p>
               <p>The force of the ſun's attraction upon the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere,
and even that of the moon, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable,
when compared with the cauſe
juſt mentioned. This force it is true, produces
a motion in the air ſimilar to that of the tides
in the ſea: But, though the air is elaſtic, and
800 times lighter than water, the motion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by attraction cannot exceed what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
in the waters of the ocean by the ſame
cauſe; for the action of gravity being propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to the quantity of matter, it muſt elevate
a ſea of water, of air, or of quickſilver, nearly
to the ſame height. Hence the influence of the
planets upon the air muſt be inconſiderable<note n="*" place="bottom">See Reflections fur la Cauſe Generale des Vents, par M. D'Alembert.</note>;
and, though it muſt occaſion a ſlight motion
from eaſt to weſt, this motion becomes alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
inſenſible when compared with that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the heat of the ſun: But, as the rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
is always greateſt when the ſun is in the
zenith, the current of air muſt follow the courſe
of the ſun, and produce a conſtant wind from
eaſt to weſt. This wind blows perpetually at
ſea in the Torrid Zone, and at land, in moſt
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0195400701:404"/>
places between the Tropics. It is this wind
which we perceive when the ſun riſes; and, in
general, eaſt winds are more frequent, and more
violent than weſt winds. The general wind,
from eaſt to weſt, extends even beyond the
Tropics. It blows ſo conſtantly in the Pacific
ocean, that the ſhips coming from Acapulco to
the Philippines, perform their voyage, which is
more than 2700 leagues, without the leaſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and without, almoſt, the neceſſity of being
directed. In the Atlantic, between Africa and
Braſil, this wind is equally conſtant. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
felt between the Philippines and Africa;
but there it is leſs conſtant, on account of the
obſtacles it meets with from the numerous
iſlands in that ſea; for it blows, during the
months of January, February, March, and April,
between the Mozambique coaſt and India; but
it gives place to other winds during the reſt of
the year: And, though it is leſs perceptible on
the coaſts than on the open ſea, and ſtill leſs in
the interior parts of continents than on the
coaſts, yet, in ſome places, it blows almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually,
as on the eaſt coaſts of Braſil, on the
coaſts of Loango in Africa, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This wind is conſtant under the Line; and,
therefore, in going from Europe to America,
mariners direct their courſe ſouthward, along
the coaſts of Spain and Africa, till they come
within 20 degrees of the Equator, where they
fall in with the eaſt, or trade-wind, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0195400701:405"/>
them directly to the coaſt of America. By
means of the ſame wind, the voyage from Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulco
to the Philippines is performed in two
months; but the return from the Philippines
to Acapulco is much more difficult, and requires
a longer time. About 28 or 30 degrees on
this ſide of the Line, the weſt wind is equally
conſtant; and, for this reaſon, the veſſels return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Weſt Indies to Europe, obſerve
not the ſame rout as in going out. Thoſe from
New Spain run north along the coaſt till they
arrive at the Havannah, in the iſland of Cuba;
and from thence they proceed northward till
they fall in with the weſt wind, which carries
them to the Azores, and then to Spain. In the
ſame manner, veſſels returning by the South
Sea from the Philippines or China, to Peru or
Mexico, ſail north as far as Japan; and, under
that latitude, they ſail to within a certain diſtance
from California; and from thence, following
the coaſt of New Spain, they arrive at Acapulco.
Theſe eaſt winds blow not always from the ſame
point; but, in general, they blow from the
ſouth-eaſt from April to September, and from
the north-eaſt from November to April.</p>
               <p>The eaſt wind, by its conſtant action, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the general motion of the ſea from eaſt
to weſt. It alſo produces perpetual currents,
ſome of them running from eaſt to weſt, and
others from eaſt to ſouth-eaſt, or north-weſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the direction of the eminences, or
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0195400701:406"/>
chains of mountains, below the ſurface, the
vallies or intervals between which ſerving as
channels to theſe ſea-rivers. The variable
winds, which blow ſometimes from the eaſt,
and ſometimes from the ſouth, likewiſe produce
currents, which change their direction with that
of the wind.</p>
               <p>The winds that blow conſtantly for ſome
months are commonly ſucceeded by contrary
winds, which obliges the mariner to wait for
that which is moſt favourable to his deſtination.
When theſe winds change, they often produce,
for ſeveral days, and ſometimes for a month, or
even two months, a perfect calm, or dreadful
tempeſts.</p>
               <p>Theſe general winds, occaſioned by the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction
of the atmoſphere, are variouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
and modified by different cauſes, and in
different climates. In that part of the Atlantic
which lies under the Temperate Zone, the north
wind blows almoſt conſtantly during the months
of October, November, December, and January.
Theſe months, therefore, are moſt favourable
for ſhips going to the Indies, which are carried
over the Line by this wind: And it is a well
known fact, that veſſels which depart from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope
in March, frequently arrive not ſooner at
Braſil than thoſe which ſet out in the following
October. The north wind reigns almoſt perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
during the winter, off Nova Zembla, and
other northern coaſts. At Cape de Verd, the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0195400701:407"/>
ſouth wind blows, during the month of July,
which is the rainy ſeaſon, or winter, in theſe
climates. At the Cape of Good Hope, the north-weſt
wind blows during the month of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
The ſame wind blows at Patna in the Eaſt
Indies, during the months of November, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember
and January, and occaſion great rains;
but the eaſt wind prevails during the other nine
months. In the Indian Ocean, between Africa
and India, and as far as the Molucca iſlands,
the trade-wind from eaſt to weſt reigns from
January to the beginning of June; the weſt
winds begin in Auguſt or September; and, in
the interval between June and July, there are
dreadful tempeſts, generally from the north
winds; but theſe winds are more variable on
the coaſts than in the open ſeas.</p>
               <p>In the kingdom of Guzarat, and upon the
neighbouring coaſts, the north winds blow from
March to September; and, during the other
months, the ſouth winds almoſt always prevail.
The Dutch, in returning from Java, ſet out in
January or February, by the aſſiſtance of the
eaſt wind, which is felt as far as the 18th degree
of ſouth latitude; and then they meet with ſouth
winds, which carry them to St Helena<note n="*" place="bottom">See Varen. Geog. cap. 20.</note>.</p>
               <p>Some regular winds are produced by the
melting of the ſnows. This was remarked by
the antient Greeks. During ſummer, a north-eaſt
wind, and a ſouth-eaſt one during winter,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0195400701:408"/>
was obſerved to take place in Thracia, in Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,
in the Egean Sea, and even in Egypt
and Africa; and winds of the ſame kind have
been remarked in Congo, at Guzarat, and at the
extremity of Africa, which are all occaſioned by
the melting of the ſnows. Regular winds,
which laſt but a few hours, are alſo produced by
the motion of the tides; and, in many places, as
on the coaſts of New Spain, of Congo, of Cuba,
&amp;c. a wind blows from the land during the
night, and from the ſea during the day.</p>
               <p>The north winds are equally regular within
the polar circles; but they become more and
more imperceptible as we approach the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
This remark is applicable to both poles.</p>
               <p>In the Atlantic and Aethiopic ocean, within
the tropics, an eaſt wind blows, through the
whole year, without any conſiderable variation,
excepting in ſome ſmall ſpots, where it changes
according to the ſituation of the coaſts, and other
circumſtances: 1<hi>ſt,</hi> Near the coaſt of Africa, and
about the 28th degree of North latitude, veſſels
are certain of finding a freſh gale from the
north-eaſt, or north-north-eaſt, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
them to the 10th degree of the ſame la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
about 100 leagues from the coaſt of
Guinea; and, at the 4th degree of north latitude,
they meet with calms and tornadoes. 2<hi>d,</hi> In
going by the Caribbee iſlands, this wind turns
more and more eaſterly, in proportion as the
veſſels approach the American coaſt. 3<hi>d,</hi> The
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0195400701:409"/>
limits of theſe variable winds, in the Atlantic,
are more extenſive upon the coaſts of America
than upon thoſe of Africa. Along the coaſt of
Guinea, from Sierra Leona to the iſland of St
Thomas, an extent of about 500 leagues, there
is a perpetual ſouth, or ſouth-weſt wind. The
narroweſt part of the Atlantic is from the coaſt
of Guinea to Braſil, where it is not above 500
leagues over. Veſſels, however, that depart
from Guinea, are obliged to ſhape their courſe
ſouthward, eſpecially when they ſet out in the
months of July or Auguſt, in order to fall in
with the ſouth-eaſt winds, which blow conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
during this ſeaſon<note n="*" place="bottom">See Phil. Tranſ. abridg. vol. 2. p. 129.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the Mediterranean, the eaſt wind blows
from the land in the evening, and the weſt wind
from the ſea in the morning. The ſouth wind,
which is accompanied with rain, and blows
commonly during the latter end of autumn, at
Paris, in Burgundy, and Champagne, yields to a
mild north wind, which produces that fine
weather vulgarly called Saint Martin's Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer<note n="†" place="bottom">See Traité des eaux de M. Mariotte.</note>.</p>
               <p>Doctor Liſter alledges, that the eaſt wind,
which reigns during the whole year between
the tropics, is occaſioned by the tranſpiration of
the plant called the <hi>ſea-lentil,</hi> which abounds in
theſe climates; and that the difference of land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds
is owing to the different ſituation of trees
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0195400701:410"/>
and foreſts. This ridiculous whim he aſſigns
as the cauſe of the winds; and, in his opinion,
the wind is ſtrongeſt at mid-day, becauſe the
tranſpiration from plants is then the greateſt;
and the wind, continues he, blows from eaſt
to weſt, becauſe all plants are, in ſome meaſure,
ſun-flowers, and tranſpire moſt from the ſide
oppoſite to the ſun<note n="*" place="bottom">See Phil. Tranſ. No. 156.</note>.</p>
               <p>Other authors have aſſigned the diurnal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the earth as the cauſe of this eaſt wind.
This notion is ſpecious: But every man, who
has the leaſt knowledge of phyſics, muſt allow,
that no fluid which ſurrounds the earth can be
affected by its rotation; that the air muſt move
along with the earth itſelf; and that the rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
motion is equally imperceptible in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere,
as on the ſurface of the earth.</p>
               <p>The principal cauſe of the winds, as already
remarked, is the heat of the ſun<note n="†" place="bottom">See Halley's treatiſe on this ſubject in the Phil. Tranſ.</note>; for, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
rarefies or condenſes the air, muſt produce
a wind or current in a direction oppoſite to thoſe
places where the rarefaction or condenſation is
greateſt.</p>
               <p>The preſſure of clouds, exhalations from the
earth, the exploſion of meteors, rains, &amp;c. like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
produce conſiderable agitations in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere.
Each of theſe cauſes, when variouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
combined, produce different effects. As it is
in vain to attempt a compleat theory of the
winds, I confine myſelf to their hiſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:0195400701:411"/>
If we had a ſeries of obſervations upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
the force, and the variations of the winds
in the different climates of the earth, and if theſe
obſervations were ſufficiently numerous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act,
we might be enabled to form more compleat
ideas with regard to the cauſes of the different
changes in the atmoſphere, than we at preſent
poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>The winds are more regular at ſea than upon
land; becauſe their motion is not interrupted.
But, upon land, the direction is often changed
by the interpoſition of mountains, foreſts, cities,
and other obſtacles. Winds are often reflected
from mountains with a force nearly equal to that
of their original current: Theſe winds are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
irregular, becauſe their direction depends
on the contour, the height, and the ſituation of
the mountains from which they rebound. The
ſea-winds alſo blow with more force and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
and laſt longer: The land-winds, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
violent, have intermiſſions and moments of
repoſe: But, at ſea, the current of the air, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no obſtacles to contend with, is uniform
and perpetual.</p>
               <p>At ſea, the eaſt winds, and thoſe which come
from the Poles, are generally ſtronger than the
weſt winds, and thoſe that proceed from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator.
But, at land, the ſouth and weſt winds
are more or leſs violent, according to the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſituation of particular countries. During
ſpring and autumn, the winds, both at ſea and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0195400701:412"/>
land, are more violent than in ſummer or win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For this, ſeveral reaſons may be aſſigned:
1. In ſpring and autumn the tides are higheſt;
and, conſequently, the winds they excite are
moſt violent during theſe ſeaſons: 2. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
produced in the atmoſphere by the action
of the ſun and moon, or the tides of the air, muſt
likewiſe be greateſt at the equinoxial ſeaſons:
3. The melting of the ſnows in ſpring, and the
condenſation of the vapours exhaled in ſummer
by the ſun, and which fall down in the autumn
in the form of rain, produce, or, at leaſt, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the force of the winds. 4. The tranſition
from heat to cold, or from cold to heat, muſt
create conſiderable augmentation and diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the volume of the air, which alone is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to raiſe great winds.</p>
               <p>Contrary currents in the atmoſphere have oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
been remarked. We ſee ſome clouds mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in one direction, and others, either above
or below them, proceeding in a direction per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
oppoſite. This contrariety of motion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
continues long; becauſe its general cauſe is
the reſiſtence of ſome large cloud, which reflects
the wind in a direction oppoſite to its natural
courſe, but is ſoon diſſipated.</p>
               <p>The winds are more violent in proportion to
the elevation of the ground, till it arrive at the
ordinary ſtation of the clouds, which is about
one-fourth or one-third of a league perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
height; and beyond this, the ſky is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0195400701:413"/>
ſerene, eſpecially in ſummer, and the wind
gradually diminiſhes: It is even ſaid to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
imperceptible on the tops of the higheſt
mountains. However, as the ſummits of theſe
mountains are covered with ice and ſnow, it is
natural to think, that this region of the air is
agitated during the fall of the ſnows, and, that
the winds are only imperceptible in the ſummer
ſeaſon. The light vapours which are raiſed in
ſummer fall in the form of dews; but, in winter,
they are condenſed, and fall on the tops of the
mountains in the form of ſnow or ice, which
may raiſe conſiderable winds at that altitude.</p>
               <p>The celerity of a current of air is augmented
when its paſſage is contracted. The ſame wind,
which is but ſlightly felt in a large open plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
violent in going through a narrow paſs in
a mountain, or between two high houſes; and it
is moſt violent at the tops of the buildings or of
the mountain, becauſe the air being compreſſed
by theſe obſtacles, is augmented both in volume
and denſity; and, as its celerity remains the
ſame, its force or momentum muſt be increaſed.
It is for this reaſon that the wind appears to be
more violent near a church or a tour than at a
diſtance from them. I have often remarked,
that the wind reflected from a building ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by itſelf is ſtronger than the direct wind
which produced it. This effect can be owing to
no other cauſe than the compreſſion of the air
againſt the building from which it rebounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:0195400701:414"/>
As the denſity of the air is greateſt at the
ſurface of the earth, it is natural to conclude,
that the wind muſt there alſo be moſt violent;
and this concluſion is, I apprehend, juſt, when
the ſky is ſerene: But, when it is charged with
clouds, the action of the wind will be moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
at the height of the clouds, which are den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
than air, as they fall in the form of rain or
of hail. In computing the force of wind, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we ought to eſtimate not only its veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but likewiſe the denſity of the air; for, two
winds of equal velocities may differ greatly in
their force, if the denſities of the air be unequal.
From this remark, we may learn the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thoſe machines which have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
for meaſuring the velocity of the winds.</p>
               <p>Particular winds, whether they be direct or
reflected, are more violent than thoſe that are
general. The interrupted action of land-winds
depends on the compreſſion of the air, which
renders every blaſt more violent than if the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
were uniform. A uniformly continued
ſtream of air produces not ſuch havock as the
fury of thoſe winds which blow, as it were, by
paroxyſins. But of this we ſhall treat more fully
in the next article.</p>
               <p>The winds, in their various directions, may
be conſidered under general points of view,
from which, perhaps, ſome uſeful deductions
may be drawn. For example, the winds may
be divided into Zones. The eaſt wind, which
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0195400701:415"/>
extends 25 or 30 degrees on each ſide of the
Equator, exerts its force round the globe within
the Torrid Zone. The north wind blows with
equal conſtancy in both the Frigid Zones. Thus,
the eaſt wind occupies the Torrid Zone, and the
north wind the Frigid Zones. With regard to
the Temperate Zones, the winds peculiar to
them may be conſidered only as currents of air,
produced by the combination of the two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
winds, which gives riſe to all thoſe that
come from the eaſtern points; and the weſt
winds, which are common in the Temperate
Zones, both in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans,
may be conſidered as reflections from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents
of Aſia and America, but deriving their
origin principally from the eaſt and north winds.</p>
               <p>Though we have ſaid, that, generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the eaſt wind blows round the globe 25 or
30 degrees on each ſide of the Equator; yet it
muſt be acknowledged, that, in ſome places, it
extends not ſo far, and that its direction is not
throughout from eaſt to weſt; for, on this ſide
of the Equator, it is eaſt-north-eaſt, and, beyond
the Equator, it is eaſt-ſouth-eaſt, and, the more
we recede from the Equator, its direction is the
more oblique. The Equator is the line under
which the direction of the wind from eaſt to
weſt is moſt exact. In the Indian Ocean, for
example, the general wind from eaſt to weſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
not above 15 degrees beyond the Equator.
In going from Goa to the Cape of Good Hope,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0195400701:416"/>
this wind is not felt beyond the 12th degree of
ſouth latitude, nor is it perceptible on this ſide
of the Equator. But, after arriving at the 12th
degree of ſouth latitude, this wind continues to
the 28th degree. In the ſea which ſeparates A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica
from america, there is an interval from the
4th degree of north latitude to the 10th or 11th
of ſouth latitude, where this general wind is not
perceived. But, beyond the 10th or 11th de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
it extends to the 30th.</p>
               <p>There are likewiſe many deviations in the
trade-winds, which have an alternate motion.
Some continue for a longer or ſhorter time; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have a greater or leſſer extent; others are
more or leſs regular, and more or leſs violent.
The following, according to Varenius, are the
principal phaenomena of theſe winds. 'In the
ocean between Africa and India, and as far as
the Molucca iſlands, the eaſt wind commences
in January, and continues to the beginning of
June. In the month of Auguſt, the weſt wind
begins, and continues for three or four months.
In the interval between theſe trade-winds,
which is between the end of June and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Auguſt, the ſea is infeſted with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
tempeſts from the north.'</p>
               <p>'Theſe winds are ſubject to the greateſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations
near the coaſts: Veſſels cannot take
their departure from the coaſt of Malabar, and
other ports on the weſt coaſt of the peninſula
of India, to Africa, Arabia, or Perſia, but from
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0195400701:417"/>
the month of January to April or May; for,
at the end of May, and during the months of
June, July, and Auguſt, the tempeſts from
the north and north-eaſt are ſo violent, that
no ſhips can keep the ſeas. But, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide of this peninſula, in the ſea which
waſhes the coaſt of Coromandel, there are no
tempeſts of this kind.'</p>
               <p>'Veſſels depart from Java, Ceylon, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other places, for the Molucca's in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,
becauſe the weſt wind begins then to
blow in theſe regions. However, when 15
degrees ſouth of the Equator, this wind ceaſes,
and they fall in with the trade-wind, which,
in this place, blows from the ſouth-eaſt. In
the ſame manner, veſſels depart from Cochin
for Malacca in March; becauſe, at this time,
the weſt wind begins to blow. Thus the weſt
winds ariſe at different times, in different parts
of the Indian Ocean. The times of departure
are different from Java to the Molucca's, from
Cochin to Malacca, from Malacca to China,
and from China to Japan.'</p>
               <p>'At Banda, the weſt winds terminate at the
end of March; calm and variable winds occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
the month of April; and the eaſt winds
begin with great violence in May. At Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
the weſt winds commence about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of March, and continue to the beginning
of October, when the eaſt, or rather eaſt-north-eaſt
winds return. At Madagaſcar, they have
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0195400701:418"/>
north or morth-weſt winds from the middle
of April to the end of May; but eaſt and
ſouth winds in February and March. From
Madagaſcar to the Cape of Good Hope, the
northerly winds prevail during the months of
March and April. In the gulf of Bengal, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the 20th of April, the ſouth winds blow
with violence; and, before this period, the
ſouth-weſt and north-weſt winds prevail. The
weſterly winds are alſo violent in the Chineſe
ſea during the months of June and July. This
is, therefore, the moſt proper ſeaſon for ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from China to Japan: But, in returning
from Japan to China, February and March are
preferable, becauſe the eaſterly winds then
prevail.'</p>
               <p>'There are ſome winds which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as peculiar to certain coaſts: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
a ſouth wind blows almoſt perpetually
on the coaſts of Chili and Peru. It begins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the 46th degree of ſouth latitude, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
beyond Panama, which makes the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
from Lima to Panama more eaſy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious
than the return. The weſterly winds
blow almoſt continually on the coaſts of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellan's
land, in the neighbourhood of the
ſtraits of Le Maire. Upon the Malabar coaſt,
they have almoſt conſtantly north and north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt
winds. The north wind is very frequent
on the coaſt of Guinea. The weſterly winds
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0195400701:419"/>
reign upon the coaſts of Japan during the
months of November and December.'</p>
               <p>The periodic, or alternate winds, mentioned
above, are peculiar to the ſea. But, upon land,
there are alſo periodic winds, which return at
certain ſeaſons, or particular days, or even at
ſtated hours. On the coaſt of Malabar, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
an eaſterly land-wind blows from Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember
to April: It generally commences at
midnight, and ends at noon; and it is not percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
at 12 or 15 leagues from the coaſt. From
noon to midnight, there is a gentle weſterly
breeze from the ſea. Upon the coaſts of New
Spain in America, and upon thoſe of Congo
in Africa, land-winds blow during the night,
and ſea-winds during the day. Winds blow
from all the coaſts of Jamaica during the night,
which prevents the landing, or ſailing of ſhips,
with ſafety, before the riſing of the ſun.</p>
               <p>In winter, the port of Cochin is inacceſſible;
neither can any veſſel get out; becauſe the winds
are ſo impetuous, that no veſſels can keep the
ſea; and, beſides, the weſt wind, which blows
with great fury, drives ſuch a quantity of ſand
into the mouth of the river, as renders it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for ſhips of any burden to enter it for ſix
months of the year. But the eaſt wind, which
blows during the other ſix months, drives back
the ſand into the ſea, and opens the mouth of
the river. At the ſtraits of Babelmandel, there
blows a ſouth-eaſt wind, which is regularly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0195400701:420"/>
by the north-eaſt. At Saint Domingo,
there are two different winds which riſe regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
every day; the one, which is from the ſea,
comes from the eaſt, and begins at 10 o'clock
before noon; the other, which is a land-wind
from the weſt, riſes at 6 or 7 in the evening,
and continues the whole night. Other facts of
this kind, collected from voyagers of knowledge
and credit, might furniſh a compleat hiſtory of
the winds, which would be a work extremely
uſeful both to navigation and phyſics.</p>

               <p>THE winds are more irregular on the land
than on the ſea, and in high than in low
countries. The mountains not only change the
direction of the winds, but even produce ſome,
which are either conſtant or variable, according
to their cauſes. The melting of ſnows on the
tops of the mountains generally give riſe to
conſtant winds which laſt a conſiderable time.
The vapours which ſtrike againſt the mountains,
and accumulate upon them, produce variable
winds, which are very common in all climates;
and there is as great a variety in the motions of
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0195400701:422"/>
the air, as there are inequalities on the ſurface
of the earth. We can only, therefore, give ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
and genuine hiſtory of facts: And, as
a connected ſeries of obſervations upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations
of the winds, and even of the ſeaſons,
in different countries, is ſtill wanting, we ſhall
not attempt to explain all the cauſes of theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations,
but ſhall confine ourſelves to thoſe which
are moſt probable.</p>
               <p>In ſtraits, at the extremities of promontories,
peninſula's, and capes, and in all narrow bays,
tempeſtuous winds are frequent. But, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of theſe, ſome ſeas are much more infeſted
with ſtorms than others. The Indian Ocean
the ſeas of Japan and of Magellan, along the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
coaſt beyond the Canaries, and the oppoſite
coaſt near Natal, and the Red and Vermilion
Seas, are all ſubject to tempeſts. The Atlantic
is likewiſe more tempeſtuous than the great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
called the Pacific: This ocean, however,
is no where perfectly tranquil, but between the
Tropics; for the nearer we approach the poles,
it is the more ſubject to variable winds, the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
changes of which produce tempeſts.</p>
               <p>All continents are ſubject to the effects of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable
winds, which are ſometimes very ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
In the kingdom of Caſſimir, which is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with the mountains of Caucaſus, a moſt
ſudden reverſe of ſeaſons is felt on Mount Pire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penjale.
In leſs than an hour's journey, we paſs
from ſummer to winter: A north and a ſouth
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0195400701:423"/>
wind, according to Bernier, blow perceptibly
within 200 paces of each other. The poſition
of this mountain muſt be ſingular; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it merits a particular examination. In the
peninſula of India, which is traverſed from north
to ſouth by the mountains of Gate, the extreme
heats of ſummer are felt on one ſide of thoſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and all the rigours of winter on the other.
The ſame phaenomenon takes place on the two
oppoſite coaſts of Cape Roſalgate in Arabia:
On the north coaſt the ſea is calm and tranquil;
while the ſouth coaſt is infeſted with continual
ſtorms. Geylon exhibits another example of
this phaenomenon; winter and high winds
reign in the north part of the iſland, while, on
the ſouth ſide of it, fine weather and ſummer
heats prevail. Of oppoſite ſeaſons in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of each other, and at the ſame time,
there are ſeveral examples, not only on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
but on the iſlands, as at Cerem, a long
iſland near Amboyna, in the north part of which
it is winter, and ſummer in the ſouth part; and
the interval between theſe two ſeaſons is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
three or four leagues.</p>
               <p>In Egypt a ſouth wind prevails in ſummer,
which is ſo hot as to ſtop reſpiration; and it
raiſes ſuch immenſe quantities of ſand, that the
ſky ſeems to be covered with thick clouds. This
ſand is ſo fine, and is blown with ſuch violence,
that it penetrates the cloſeſt cheſts. When theſe
winds continue for ſeveral days, they give riſe
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0195400701:424"/>
to epidemic diſeaſes, which frequently cut off
vaſt numbers of men. It ſeldom rains in Egypt;
every year, however, there are ſome days of rain
in the months of December, January, and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary.
But thick fogs are more frequent than
rain, eſpecially in the neighbourhood of Cairo.
Theſe fogs commence in November, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
during the winter; and, through the whole
year, even when the ſky is ſerene, the dews fall
ſo copiouſly, that they have all the effects of
rain.</p>
               <p>In Perſia, the winter commences in Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and laſts till March. The cold is ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to produce ice; and ſnows fall in the
mountains, and ſometimes in the plains. From
March to May, they have violent winds, which
recal the warmth of ſummer. From May to
September the ſky is ſerene, and the heats are
moderated during the night by freſh breezes
which continue till morning; and, in autumn,
they have violent winds, like thoſe which blow in
the ſpring. However, though theſe winds are
very ſtrong, they ſeldom produce tempeſts or
hurricanes. But, in ſummer, a very noxious
wind blows along the Perſic Gulf, which is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Samiel</hi> by the natives; it is ſtill hotter and
more terrible than that of Egypt; and acting
like an exploſion of inflamed vapour, it ſuſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
every perſon who unhappily falls within
its vortex. A ſimilar wind riſes in ſummer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the Red Sea, which ſuſſocates animals, and
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0195400701:425"/>
tranſports ſuch quantities of ſand, that many
people imagine this ſea will, in the courſe
of time, be compleatly filled up with it. Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia
gives birth to frequent clouds of ſand which
darken the air, and excite dangerous whirlwinds.
At Vera Cruz, when the hot winds blow from
the north, the houſes of that town are almoſt
buried with ſand. Hot winds are alſo felt in
ſummer at Negapatan in India, and likewiſe at
Petapouli and Maſulapatan. Theſe ſcorching
winds which kill men, are fortunately of no long
duration; but they are extremely violent, and
their heat and deleterious quality are propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to their velocity; which is contrary to
the nature of other winds; for the more their
rapidity, they are the more wholeſome and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing.
This difference proceeds from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of heat in the air. When the heat of the
air is leſs than that of the body, the motion of
the air is agreeable. But, when the heat of the
air is greater than that of the bodies of animals,
its motion ſcorches and ſuſſocates. At Goa, the
winter, or rather the rainy and tempeſtuous ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
is in the months of May, June, and July;
it cools and refreſhes the air, which would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
be perfectly inſupportable in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>The Cape of Good Hope is famous for its
tempeſts, and a peculiar cloud which produces
them. This cloud at firſt appears like a ſmall
round ſpot in the heavens, which mariners di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0195400701:426"/>
by the name of the <hi>Ox's Eye.</hi> The
ſeeming ſmallneſs of this cloud is probably ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to its great height. Of all voyagers who
mention this cloud, Kolbe appears to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
it with the greateſt attention. 'This
cloud,' ſays he<note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. 1. p. 224.</note>, 'which appears on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the <hi>Table,</hi> or of the <hi>Devil,</hi> or of the
<hi>Wind,</hi> is compoſed, if I am not deceived, of an
infinite number of particles puſhed, in the firſt
place, againſt the mountains to the eaſt of the
Cape, by the eaſt wind which blows in the
Torrid Zone during almoſt the whole year.
Theſe particles or vapours are ſtopped by the
high mountains, and are collected on their
eaſt ſide. They then become viſible in the
form of ſmall fragments of clouds, which, by
the conſtant action of the eaſt wind, are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
to the tops of the mountains. Here
they remain not long at reſt; but, being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to advance, they ſink down between the
mountains that are ſtill before them, where
they are locked up and ſqueezed on all ſides
as in a canal. The wind preſſes theſe vapours
from above, and the oppoſite ſides of the two
mountains confine them on the right and left,
till, in their progreſs, they advance to the foot
of ſome mountain where the country is more flat
and open; they then expand, and become
again inviſible. But they are ſoon puſhed
againſt another ridge of mountains by freſh
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0195400701:427"/>
clouds coming up behind them; and in this
manner they proceed till they arrive with vaſt
impetuoſity at the top of the higheſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Cape, which are thoſe of the
<hi>Wind</hi> or of the <hi>Table,</hi> where they are met by a
wind blowing in the very oppoſite direction.
Here a dreadful conflict enſues. The vapours
are preſſed both before and behind, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
terrible whirlwinds, either on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the <hi>Table,</hi> or in the vallies. When the
north-weſt wind yields, that of the ſouth-eaſt
increaſes, and continues to blow with more or
leſs violence for ſix months. When the <hi>Ox's
Eye</hi> is thick, the force of the ſouth-eaſt wind
augments, becauſe the vapours amaſſed behind
the mountains continually preſs forward; for
the ſame reaſon, this wind diminiſhes when
the <hi>Ox's Eye</hi> is thin; and it entirely ceaſes
when the <hi>Ox's Eye</hi> vaniſhes, becauſe no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
arrive from the eaſt.'</p>
               <p>'The circumſtances attending this phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon
lead to the following hypotheſis:
1. Behind the mountain of the <hi>Table,</hi> a train
of thin white vapour is obſerved, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences
on the eaſtern declivity of this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
ends in a ſharp point at the ſea, and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
in its extent, the whole mountains of
<hi>Stone.</hi> I have often contemplated this train,
and imagined it to originate from the rapid
motion of the vapour above deſcribed, from
the mountains of <hi>Stone</hi> to that of the <hi>Table.</hi>'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:0195400701:428"/>
'2. The paſſage of theſe vapours muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
embarraſſed by the contrary ſhocks
received, not only from the mountains, but
from the ſouth and eaſt winds which prevail
in the neighbourhood of the Cape. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
mentioned the two mountains ſituated
on the points of <hi>Falſe bay,</hi> the one called the
<hi>Hanging Lip,</hi> the other the <hi>Norvege.</hi> When
the particles or vapours, which I have conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,
are puſhed againſt thoſe mountains by
the eaſt winds, they are repelled by the ſouth
winds, and driven againſt the neighbouring
mountains, where they are detained for ſome
time, and appear like clouds, as they often do
upon the mountains of <hi>Falſe bay,</hi> and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
them. Theſe clouds are frequently very
thick above the land in the poſſeſſion of the Dutch,
upon the mountains of <hi>Stellenboſck,</hi> of <hi>Draken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein,</hi>
and of <hi>Stone,</hi> but eſpecially upon the
mountains of the <hi>Table</hi> and of the <hi>Devil.</hi>'</p>
               <p>'Laſtly, The conſtant appearance of ſmall
black clouds upon the <hi>Lion's Head</hi> two or three
days before the ſouth-eaſt winds blow, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
me in my conjecture; for theſe clouds,
in my opinion, are compoſed of the particles
or vapour mentioned above. If the north-weſt
wind prevails when theſe particles arrive,
their courſe is ſtopped; but they are never
driven to any great diſtance till the ſouth-eaſt
wind commences.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:0195400701:429"/>
The navigators who firſt approached the Cape
of Good Hope, were ignorant of the effects of
theſe clouds, which ſeemed to ariſe ſlowly and
without any agitation in the air, but which, in
a moment, excite the moſt furious tempeſts, and
precipitate the largeſt veſſels to the bottom of
the ocean. In the country of Natal, a cloud ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
to the Ox's Eye at the Cape, produces the
ſame direful effects. Theſe ſpecies of tempeſts
are frequent in the Atlantic, eſpecially in the
neighbourhood of the Equator. Near the coaſt
of Guiney, three or four of theſe ſtorms ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
happen in a day, which are likewiſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
and announced by ſmall black clouds,
while the reſt of the ſky is generally ſerene,
and the ſea perfectly calm. It is principally in
April, May, and June, that theſe furious ſtorms
ariſe along the coaſt of Guiney, becauſe no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
winds blow there at that ſeaſon. On the
coaſt of Loango, the ſtormy ſeaſon is in the months
of January, February, March, and April. At
Cape Gardafu, on the other ſide of Africa, they
have ſtorms of this kind in May, and the clouds
which produce them are generally in the north,
like thoſe of the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
               <p>All theſe ſtorms originate from winds that iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
from a cloud; and their direction is from
north to ſouth, or from north-eaſt to ſouth-weſt,
&amp;c. But there are tempeſts of another kind,
called Whirlwinds, which are ſtill more violent,
and in which the wind ſeems to blow from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0195400701:430"/>
quarter at once. Their motion is circular,
and nothing can reſiſt their fury. They are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
preceded by a dead calm; but, in an
inſtant, the waves are elevated to the clouds by
the fury of the winds. Some parts of the ſea
cannot be approached; becauſe they are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
infeſted either with calms or whirlwinds.
Theſe places have been called <hi>calms</hi> and <hi>torna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi>
by the Spaniards. The moſt conſiderable
of them are near Guiney, about the 2d or 3d
degree of north latitude. They extend about
300 or 350 leagues in length, and nearly as
much in breadth, which includes a ſpace of more
than 100,000 ſquare leagues.</p>
               <p>When contrary winds arrive at the ſame
time in the ſame place, they produce whirlwinds,
by the oppoſite motion of the air, in the ſame
manner as whirlpools are produced in the ſea
by contrary currents. But, when thoſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
winds are counterbalanced by their diſtant
action upon each other, they then revolve in a
great circle, and produce a perfect calm, which
it is impoſſible for veſſels to paſs through. Theſe
places are all marked in the globes of Mr Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex.
I am inclined to think, that the contrariety
of the winds alone, if not aſſiſted by the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the coaſts, and the particular ſtructure
of the bottom of the ſea in theſe places, could
not produce this effect. I imagine that the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
which are in effect occaſioned by the
winds, but aſſume their direction from the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0195400701:431"/>
of the coaſts and the inequalities at the
bottom, terminate in theſe places; and that their
oppoſite motions, in a plain ſurrounded with a
chain of mountains, give riſe to the tornados in
queſtion.</p>
               <p>Whirlpools ſeem to be nothing elſe but cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
motions of the waters occaſioned by the
action of two or more oppoſite currents. The
Euripus, ſo famed by the death of Ariſtotle, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately
abſorbs and rejects the water ſeven
times every 24 hours. This whirlpool is near
the coaſt of Greece. Charybdis, which lies near
the ſtraits of Sicily, rejects and abſorbs the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thrice in 24 hours. We are uncertain as to
the number of alternate motions in other whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pools.
Dr Placentia informs us, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Euripus are irregular for 18 or 19
days every month, and regular during the other
11; and that it ſeldom ſwells above one, or at
moſt two feet. He farther informs us, that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
are not agreed as to the tides in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripus;
that ſome ſay it is twice, others ſeven
times, ſome eleven, others 12 or 14 times in
24 hours; but that Loirius, who examined it
attentively, found that the tides roſe regularly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſix hours, and that their motion was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to turn a mill-wheel.</p>
               <p>The largeſt known whirlpool is in the ſea of
Norway, the circumference of which exceeds
20 leagues. It abſorbs, for ſix hours, water,
whales, ſhips, and any thing that approaches it,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0195400701:432"/>
and the next ſix hours are employed in throwing
them up again.</p>
               <p>To account for theſe whirlpools, it is unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to have recourſe to an abyſs, or to pits in
the bottom of the ſea, which are perpetually
ſwallowing the waters. It is well known, that,
when water has two directions, the combination
of theſe motions produces a whirling, and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
the appearance of a void ſpace in the middle.
In the ſame manner, whirlpools in the ſea are
occaſioned by two or more contrary currents;
and, as the tides are the principal cauſe of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and, of courſe, they run for ſix hours in
contrary directions, it is not ſurpriſing, that the
whirlpools which are produced by them ſhould
alternately reject and abſorb every thing within
their reach during the ſame portions of time.</p>
               <p>Whirlpools, then, are occaſioned by contrary
currents, and whirlwinds by the conflict of
contrary winds. Theſe whirlwinds are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in the Chineſe and Japaneſe ſeas, near the
Antilles, and in many other places of the ocean,
particularly in the neighbourhood of prominent
coaſts. But they are ſtill more frequent upon
land; and their effects are ſometimes prodigious.
'I have ſeen,' ſays Bellarmin<note n="*" place="bottom">De Aſcenſu Mentis in Deum</note>, 'an enormous
ditch ſcooped out by the wind, tranſported in
the air, and dropped upon a village, which was
for ever buried under this load of earth.' A
detail of the effects of ſeveral hurricanes may be
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0195400701:433"/>
ſeen in the hiſtory of the French Academy, and
in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, which would
appear altogether inconceivable, if they were not
atteſted by intelligent and credible ſpectators.</p>
               <p>The ſame obſervation may be made with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to water-ſpouts, which the mariner never
beholds without terror and amazement. They
are very common on certain coaſts of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,
eſpecially when the weather is cloudy,
and the wind blows from ſeveral coaſts at the
ſame time. They are more frequent near the
coaſts of Laodicea, of Grecgo, and of Carmel,
than in any other part of the Mediterranean.
Moſt of them are large cylinders of water which
fall from the clouds, though, at a diſtance, the
water appears to riſe up from the ſea to the
clouds<note n="*" place="bottom">See Shaw's travels.</note>.</p>
               <p>But there are two ſpecies of water-ſpouts;
the firſt is that we have juſt mentioned, and is
nothing but a thick cloud compreſſed, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
by oppoſite winds blowing from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
coaſts at the ſame time, which make it
aſſume a cylindric figure, and fall down by its
own gravity. The quantity of water is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe,
and the rapidity of the fall ſo great, that
if, unfortunately, one of theſe ſpouts break up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſhip, it daſhes it to pieces, and ſinks it in
an inſtant. It is alledged, and with probability,
that water-ſpouts may be broken and diſſipated
by the commotion excited in the air by the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0195400701:434"/>
firing of cannons, which correſponds with the
diſſipation of thunder-clouds by the ringing of
bells.</p>
               <p>The other ſpecies of water-ſpout is called a
<hi>typhon,</hi> and is very frequent in the Chineſe Sea.
The typhon deſcends not from the clouds, nor
is produced by the action of oppoſite winds. It,
on the contrary, riſes from the water to the
heavens with amazing rapidity. Whirlwinds
often run along conſiderable tracts, bearing
down houſes, trees, and every obſtacle that they
meet with. But typhons remain always in the
ſame places, and can be owing to nothing but
ſubterraneous fires; for the ſea is then in the
greateſt agitation, and the air is ſo impregnated
with ſulphureous exhalations, that the ſky ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be covered with a copper-coloured cruſt,
although there be no clouds, and the ſun or the
ſtars appear through the vapour. It is to theſe
ſubterranean fires that we muſt aſcribe the warmth
of the Chineſe Sea in winter, where theſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons
are very frequent<note n="*" place="bottom">See Acta erud. Lipſ. ſupplem. tom. 1. p. 405.</note>.</p>
               <p>Thevenote, in his voyage to the eaſt, gives
the following account of water-ſpouts: 'We ſaw
water-ſpouts in the Perſic gulf, between the
iſlands of Queſomo, Lareca, and Ormutz. Few
have had the opportunity, and fewer ſtill have
paid the attention to water-ſpouts, that I have
done. I ſhall deſcribe them with perſpicuity
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0195400701:435"/>
and ſimplicity, in order to render my account
the more eaſily intelligible.'</p>
               <p>'The firſt that we ſaw, was on the north ſide
between us and the iſland of Queſomo, about
a gun-ſhot from our ſhip. In this place, we
ſaw the water begin to boil, and to be raiſed
about a foot above the ſurface: It was whitiſh,
and the top of it appeared like black ſmoke:
It made a kind of whiſpering noiſe, like a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ruſhing down with violence into a deep
valley. This noiſe was mingled with another
that reſembled the hiſſing of ſerpents. A little
afterwards, we ſaw an obſcure canal or pipe,
which reſembled ſmoke riſing to the clouds,
and revolved with conſiderable velocity: This
pipe was about the ſize of a man's finger; and
the ſame noiſe continued. It then vaniſhed,
having continued in all about a quarter of an
hour. We then perceived another on the
ſouth, which began in the ſame manner as the
former: Immediately a third ſprung up to the
weſt, and then a fourth likewiſe to the weſt;
the moſt diſtant not exceeding a muſket-ſhot
from us. Each of them appeared like heaps
of ſmoking ſtraw, and were accompanied
with the ſame noiſe as the firſt. We next per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
three pipes, or canals, extending from
the water to the clouds, where each of them
terminated like the mouth of a funnel or
trumpet, or like the paps of an animal drawn
perpendicularly downward by a weight. Theſe
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0195400701:436"/>
pipes were of a dark white colour, which I
imagined to be owing to the water they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
for the pipes appeared to be formed
before they were filled with the water, and
they diſappeared when they were empty; in
the ſame manner as a cylinder of clear glaſs,
when held up in the light at a diſtance from
the eye, is not viſible, unleſs it be filled with
ſome coloured liquor. Theſe pipes were not
ſtraight, but bent in ſome places: They were
not even perpendicular; on the contrary, from
the clouds into which they were ingrafted, to
the places from which they extracted the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they were very much inclined. And,
what is ſingular, the cloud to which the ſecond
of the three was attached, having been puſhed
forward by the wind, the pipe followed it
without breaking, or quitting its ſtation in the
water; and, paſſing behind the pipe of the firſt,
they remained for ſome time in the form of a
St Andrew's croſs. At firſt, none of the three
exceeded an inch in thickneſs, excepting where
they joined the cloud: But the one that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
firſt, ſwelled afterwards conſiderably.
The other two continued not longer than the
one we had ſeen to the north. The ſecond,
on the ſouth, laſted about a quarter of an
hour; but the firſt, on the ſame ſide of the
veſſel, continued longer, and gave us ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs;
of it, therefore, we have ſtill farther
to remark, that, although it originally was not
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0195400701:437"/>
larger than a man's finger, it gradually ſwelled
to the ſize of an arm, then to that of a leg,
and, <hi>laſtly,</hi> to that of the trunk of a tree as large
as a man could encompaſs with both his arms.
We ſaw the water riſing diſtinctly through
this tranſparent body, which was of a ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
form; and it ſometimes diminiſhed in
thickneſs both above and below. It now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
reſembled a ſoft tube filled with water, and
preſſed with the fingers, either above to make
the fluid deſcend, or below to make it aſcend;
and I was ſatisfied that theſe variations were
occaſioned by the wind, which, when it preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the canal above, cauſed the water to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend,
and when the preſſure was lower down,
made the water aſcend. After this, it dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
to the ſize of a man's arm; then it ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the ſize of a thigh; then became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
ſmall; <hi>laſtly,</hi> I perceived that the
water elevated from the ſurface began to ſink,
and the end of the canal ſeparated from it;
when a variation of the light removed it from
my view. I ſtill, however, continued to look
for it, becauſe I had remarked, that the canal
of the ſecond ſpout appeared to break in the
middle, and to reunite a little afterwards, one
half of it having been concealed by the light;
but this laſt never more appeared.'</p>
               <p>'Theſe ſpouts are exceedingly dangerous at
ſea; for, when they fall upon a veſſel, they
mingle ſo with the ſails, that they ſometimes
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0195400701:438"/>
raiſe the veſſel up, and let it fall back again
with ſuch violence as to ſink it. But, although
they ſhould not raiſe the ſhip, they tear the
ſails, or let the whole water they contain fall
upon the veſſel, which precipitates it to the
bottom. It is not improbable, that many veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
of which we never have any accounts,
periſh by ſuch accidents; for there are few
examples of our ever learning with certainty
of ſhips being loſt in this manner.'</p>
               <p>In the above account of water-ſpouts, there
appears to be ſeveral optical illuſions. But I
have related the facts <hi>verbatim,</hi> that they may
either be confirmed, or at leaſt compared with
thoſe of other navigators. M. Gentil, in his
voyage round the world, deſcribes water-ſpouts
in the following manner: 'At eleven o'clock,
before noon, the ſky being cloudy, we ſaw
round our ſhip, at the diſtance of about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a league, ſix water-ſpouts, which began
with a noiſe like that of water running below
ground, and gradually increaſed till it reſembled
the hiſſing noiſe occaſioned by a high wind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the ropes of a ſhip. We firſt perceived
that the ſea began to boil; and its ſurface roſe
about a foot and a half; the top of this ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
part was covered with a thick fog, or
rather ſmoke, which formed itſelf into a canal,
and mounted to the clouds. Theſe canals
bended according as the wind carried the
clouds to which they were attached. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0195400701:439"/>
the motion communicated to the
clouds by the wind, the canals not only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to them, but ſeemed to ſtretch out, or
contract, in proportion as the clouds roſe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or ſunk down in the atmoſphere.'</p>
               <p>'Theſe appearances gave us much uneaſineſs;
and our ſailors, inſtead of encouraging each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
increaſed their fears by dreadful ſtories.
If theſe ſpouts, ſaid they, fall upon the ſhip,
they will lift her up, and then plunge her to
the bottom. Others maintained, with a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
tone, that they would not lift the veſſel;
but that, being full of water, if the ſhip went
forward, ſhe would break their communication
with the ſea, and that the great body of water,
by falling perpendicularly on the veſſel, would
break her in pieces.'</p>
               <p>'To prevent this misfortune, they lowered
the ſails, and charged the cannon. It is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
opinion among ſailors, that the firing of
cannon, by agitating the air, burſts and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
water-ſpouts. But we were not under the
neceſſity of having recourſe to this expedient;
for, after courſing round the ſhip for about
ten minutes, ſome being about a quarter of a
league from us, and others nearer, the canals
became gradually narrower, detached them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the ſurface of the ſea, and then
entirely vaniſhed<note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. 1. p. 191.</note>.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:0195400701:440"/>
From the deſcription of theſe two voyagers,
it appears, that water-ſpouts are produced, at
leaſt in part, by the action of fire or ſmoke,
which riſes with violence from the bottom of
ſea; and that they are very different from thoſe
which are occaſioned by oppoſite winds: 'The
water-ſpouts,' ſays Mr Shaw<note n="*" place="bottom">Shaw's travels. p. 334.</note>, 'which I had
the opportunity of ſeeing, ſeemed to be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
cylinders of water falling down from the
clouds; though, by the reflection, it may be
of thoſe deſcending columns, or from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
dropping of the water contained in them,
they would ſometimes appear, eſpecially at a
diſtance, to be ſucked up from the ſea. Nothing
more, perhaps, is required to explain this phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon,
than that the clouds ſhould be firſt
of all crouded together, and then, that contrary
winds, preſſing violently upon them, ſhould
occaſion them to condenſe, and fall in this cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindrical
manner.'</p>
               <p>Many facts remain ſtill to be known before theſe
phaenomena can be properly explained. To me
it appears, that, if there be, in particular places,
at the bottom of the ſea, a mixture of ſulphur,
bitumen, and mineral ſubſtances, theſe may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionly
be inflamed, which will produce, like
the exploſion of gun-powder, a great quantity
of air; and that this air newly generated, and
rarefied to a prodigious degree, mounts with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,
and may elevate the water from the ſea
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0195400701:441"/>
to the clouds. In the ſame manner, if a perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
current of air be produced by the explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſulphureous matter in a cloud, the whole
of its water may follow this current, and give
riſe to a water-ſpout from the clouds to the ſea.
But, it muſt be acknowledged, that this account
of the laſt ſpecies of ſpout is not more ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
than that which we have given of thoſe
produced by contrary winds; for, it may be aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
why thoſe ſpouts which originate from the
clouds, are not as common on land as upon the
ſea?</p>
               <p>The hiſtorian of the academy for the year
1727, mentions a land water-ſpout which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
at Capeſtan near Beziers. It deſcended
from a cloud like a black pillar, which gradually
diminiſhed, and ended in a point upon the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the earth. It followed the direction of
the wind, which was weſterly; it was attended
with a thick ſmoke, and made a noiſe like the
ſea when greatly agitated. It tore up trees by
the roots, and marked its way on the earth by
a large tract in which three carriages might have
paſſed each other. Another pillar of the ſame
kind appeared, but it ſoon joined the firſt; and,
when the whole was diſſipated, there fell a great
quantity of hail.</p>
               <p>This ſpecies of water-ſpouts appears to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the other two. It is not ſaid to have
contained water; and it ſeems, both from what
I have mentioned, and by M. Andoque's expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0195400701:442"/>
of it to the academy, to have been only
a hurricane rendered viſible by the duſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed
vapour which it contained. The ſame
hiſtorian, for the year 1741, mentions a water-ſpout
which was ſeen upon the lake of Geneva.
It was of a cylindrical figure, the upper part of
which ended in a black cloud, and the under
part of it was narrow, and terminated near the
ſurface of the water. This meteor continued
only a few minutes; and, at the moment of its
diſſipation, a thick vapour aſcended from the place
where it firſt appeared; the water of the lake
boiled, and ſeemed to make an effort to riſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the air, which was very calm the whole time;
neither was this ſpout followed either by wind
or rain. 'After all our knowledge of water-ſpouts,'
ſays the hiſtorian, 'does not this prove
that they are not produced by the conflict of
oppoſite winds alone, but that they almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
originate from volcano's or ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
vapours, which are known to exiſt at the
bottom of the ſea, as well as upon land? Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds
and hurricanes, therefore, which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
believed to be the cauſe of theſe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
may be only an effect or an accidental
conſequence of them.'</p>

               <head>Of Volcano's and Earthquakes.</head>
               <p>THE bowels of thoſe burning mountains
called <hi>volcano's,</hi> contain ſulphur, bitumen,
and other inflammable materials, the effects of
which are more violent than thoſe of thunder
or of gun-powder; and they have, in all ages,
aſtoniſhed mankind, and deſolated the earth. A
volcano is an immenſe cannon, with an aperture
often more than half a league in circumference.
From this vaſt mouth are projected torrents of
ſmoke and of flames, rivers of bitumen, of ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
and of melted metals, clouds of aſhes and
ſtones; and ſometimes it ejects, to the diſtance
of ſeveral leagues, rocks ſo enormous, that they
could not be moved by any combination of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0195400701:444"/>
man powers. The conflagration is ſo dreadful,
and the quantities of burning, calcined, melted,
and vitrified ſubſtances thrown out by the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
are ſo great, that they bury whole towns
and foreſts, cover the plains to the thickneſs
of a hundred or two hundred feet, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
from hills and mountains, which are only
portions of theſe matters heaped up and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
into one maſs. The action of the fire and
the force of the exploſions are ſo violent, that
they produce, by reaction, ſuccuſſions, which
ſhake the earth, agitate the ſea, overturn moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and deſtroy towns and buildings of the
moſt ſolid materials.</p>
               <p>Theſe effects, though natural, have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as prodigies; and, though we often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
in miniature, effects ſimilar to thoſe of vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's;
yet grandeur, from whatever ſource it
proceeds, has ſuch an aſtoniſhing influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the imagination, that it is not ſurpriſing they
ſhould have been conſidered by ſome authors as
vents to a central fire, and, by the vulgar, as
mouths of hell. Aſtoniſhment produces fear,
and fear is the ſource of ſuperſtition. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of Iceland firmly believe that the groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of their volcano are the cries of the damned,
and that its eruptions are occaſioned by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation
and ungovernable fury of devils and
tormented ſpirits.</p>
               <p>All theſe phaenomena, however, are only the
effects of fire and of ſmoke. In the bowels of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0195400701:445"/>
mountains, there are veins of ſulphur, bitumen,
and other inflammable ſubſtances, together with
vaſt quantities of pyrites, which ferment when
expoſed to the air, or to moiſture, and produce
exploſions proportioned to the quantity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable
matter. This is the true idea of a
volcano; and it is eaſy for the naturaliſt to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the operation of theſe ſubterraneous fires.
A mixture of ſulphur, of filings of iron, and of
water, buried at a certain depth below the
ground, will exhibit, in miniature, all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of a volcano: This mixture ſoon fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to a degree of inflammation, throws off
the earth and ſtones which cover it, and produces
exploſions every way ſimilar to thoſe of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mountains.</p>
               <p>The moſt famous volcano's in Europe are
thoſe of Mount Aetna in Sicily, of Mount Hecla
in Iceland, and of Mount Veſuvius, near Naples
in Italy. The burning of Mount Aetna is more
antient than the records of hiſtory. Its erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are extremely violent; and the quantity
of matter it throws out is ſo enormous, that, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
digging 68 feet deep, marble pavements, and
other veſtiges of an antient city, have been
found covered with this amazing load of earth,
in the ſame manner as the town of Herculane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
has been buried with the matter ejected
from Mount Veſuvius. New mouths, or cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
were opened in Aetna, in the years 1650,
1669, and at other times. The ſmoke and
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0195400701:446"/>
flames of this volcano are ſeen as far as Malta,
a diſtance of 60 leagues: It ſends forth a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
ſmoke, and, at particular times, it throws
out, with an aſtoniſhing violence, flames, lava,
huge ſtones, and matter of every kind. An e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of this volcano, in the year 1537, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
an earthquake over the whole iſland of
Sicily, which laſted 12 days, and overthrew an
immenſe number of houſes and public buildings.
It terminated by the burſting of a new mouth,
the lava of which burnt up every thing within
five leagues of the mountain. It diſcharged
aſhes ſo abundantly, and with ſuch force, that
they reached the coaſt of Italy, and incommoded
veſſels at great diſtances from the iſland. This
volcano has, at preſent, two principal craters,
one of which is narrower than the other. They
both ſmoke perpetually; but flames only appear
during the time of eruptions. Large ſtones, it is

               <p>A violent eruption, in 1683, produced a
dreadful earthquake in Sicily. It laid the whole
city of Catanea in ruins, and killed more than
60,000 of its inhabitants, beſide thoſe who
periſhed in the neighbouring towns and villages.</p>
               <p>Hecla darts its fires through the ſnows and
ice of a frozen climate. Its eruption, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
are equally violent with thoſe of Aetna,
and other volcano's in the more ſouthern regions.
It throws out aſhes, lava, pumice-ſtones, and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:0195400701:447"/>
ſometimes boiling water. The whole iſland of
Iceland abounds in ſulphur; but it is not habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
within leſs than ſix leagues of the volcano.
The hiſtory of its moſt violent eruptions is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in a book written by <hi>Dithmar Bleffken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to hiſtorians, the burning of mount
Veſuvius began not before the ſeventh conſulate
of Titus Veſpaſian, and Flavius Domitian. The
top of the mountain then opened, and at firſt
threw out ſtones and rocks; theſe were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by flames and lava, which burned up
two neighbouring cities, and volumes of ſmoke
ſo thick as to darken the light of the ſun. The
elder Pliny, ſtimulated by curioſity, approached
too near the mountain, and was ſuffocated by
its ſulphureous ſteams<note n="*" place="bottom">See Pliny the younger's letter to Tacitus.</note>. Dion Caſſius relates,
that this eruption was ſo violent, that aſhes and
ſulphureous ſteams were tranſmitted as far as
Rome, and acroſs the Mediterranean into Africa
and Egypt. Heraclea was one of the cities that
were overwhelmed by the matter ejected from
the mountain: It has lately been diſcovered 60
feet under the ſurface of the ground, which, in
the courſe of time, had become arable, and fit
for every kind of culture. The hiſtory of the
diſcovery of Heraclea is in the hands of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic.
We have only to wiſh, that ſome perſon,
ſkilled in the knowledge of nature, would exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
with attention the different materials which
compoſe this 60 feet of earth, and remark their
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0195400701:448"/>
ſituation, the alterations they have undergone,
the direction they have followed, the hardneſs
they have acquired, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Naples appears to be ſituated upon a vault
filled with burning minerals; for Veſuvius and
Solfatara ſeem to have ſubterraneous communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.
When Veſuvius throws out lava, Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatara
emits flames; and, when the eruptions of
the former ceaſe, the burning of the latter is
likewiſe extinguiſhed. The city of Naples is
nearly in the centre between them.</p>
               <p>One of the laſt, and moſt dreadful, eruptions
of Veſuvius, happened in the year 1737<note n="*" place="bottom">This volume was publiſhed in the year 1749. Several eruptions have happened ſince that time. See Hamilton's hiſtory of veſuvins.</note>. The
mountain diſcharged, from ſeveral mouths, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
torrents of melted matter, which ſpread
over the fields, and terminated in the ſea. M.
de Montealegre, who communicated this account
of it to the Academy of Sciences, obſerved, with
horror, one of theſe rivers of fire, which, from
its ſource to the ſea, was about 7 miles in length,
50 or 60 paces broad, from 25 to 30 palms
deep, and in the vallies 120 palms. The running
matter reſembled foam, or the droſs which iſſues
from a furnace, &amp;c.<note n="†" place="bottom">See l'hiſt. de l'Acad. année, 1737, p. 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In Aſia, and particularly in the iſlands of the
Indian ocean, volcano's are numerous. One of
the moſt famous is Mount Albours, near Mount
Taurus, about 8 leagues from Herat. The top
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0195400701:449"/>
of this mountain ſends forth a pepetual ſmoke;
and it frequently throws out flames and burning
matter, in ſuch quantities as to cover all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
plains with aſhes. In the iſland of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
there is a volcano which diſcharges matter
ſimilar to pumice-ſtones. Some voyagers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that this volcano is moſt furious during
the equinoxes, becauſe theſe periods are attended
with certain winds which increaſe the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of theſe fires, that have continued to
burn for ages<note n="*" place="bottom">See Voyages d'Argenſola, tom. 1. p. 21.</note>. The iſland of Ternate is not
above 7 leagues round, and is only the top of a
large mountain. The land riſes from the coaſt
to the middle of the iſland, where the volcano
mounts to a height ſo great, that it is difficult to
get to the top of it. Several rills of ſweet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
deſcend from the ſides of the mountain; and,
when the air is calm, and the weather fine, this
burning gulf is leſs agitated than during ſtorms
and high winds<note n="†" place="bottom">See Voyage de Schouten.</note>. This confirms what I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
remarked, and ſeems to prove, that the
fire of volcano's proceeds not from a great
depth, but from the top, or higher parts of the
mountain; for, if it were otherwiſe, high winds
could not increaſe the violence of the flames.
There are other volcano's in the Molucca iſlands.
In one of the iſlands of Mauritius, about 70
leagues from the Moluccas, there is a volcano,
the effects of which are equally violent as thoſe
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:0195400701:450"/>
of the mountain in Ternate. The iſland of
Sorca, one of the Moluccas, was formerly inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.
In the middle of this iſland there is a
very high mountain, with a volcano at the top
of it. In 1693, this volcano diſcharged in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
quantity of bitumen, and inflamed mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which, forming a burning lake, gradually
extended till it covered the whole iſland<note n="*" place="bottom">See Phil. Tranſ. abrid. vol. 2. p. 391.</note>.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral volcano's in Japan, and the
adjacent iſlands, which ſend out flames in the
night, and ſmoke in the day. In the Philippine
iſlands there are likewiſe ſeveral burning moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
One of the moſt remarkable, and, at the
ſame time, the moſt recent volcano in the Indian
iſlands, is that near the town of Panarucan in the
iſland of Java. It commenced in the year 1586;
and, at the firſt eruption, it threw out immenſe
quantities of ſulphur, bitumen, and ſtones. The
ſame year, Mount Gounapi, in the iſland of
Banda, which had been a volcano only about
17 years, opened and ejected, with a dreadful
noiſe, rocks and matter of every kind. There
are ſtill other volcano's in India, as in Sumatra,
and in the north of Aſia, beyond the river Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcea,
and the river Peſida: But the two laſt
are little known.</p>
               <p>Near Fez in Africa, there is a mountain, or
rather a cavern, called <hi>Beni-guazeval,</hi> which
conſtantly throws out ſmoke, and ſometimes
flame. One of the Cape de Verd iſlands, called
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:0195400701:451"/>
the iſland of <hi>Fuogo,</hi> is nothing but a huge
mountain which burns inceſſantly. This vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano
caſts out ſtones and aſhes; and the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze,
who often attempted to inhabit the iſland,
have always abandoned the project, on account
of the volcano. The Peak of Teneriff, which
is reckoned one of the higheſt mountains in the
world, throws out fire, aſhes, and large ſtones.
From the top of it, rivulets of melted ſulphur
run down the ſouth ſide acroſs the ſnows; this
ſulphur ſoon condenſes and forms veins in the
ſnow, which are diſtinguiſhable at great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>America, and particularly the mountains of
Mexico and Peru, are much infeſted with vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's:
That of Arequipa is one of the moſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated:
It often produces great earthquakes,
which are more frequent in Peru than in any
country of the world. Next to Arequipa, the
volcano's of Carrapa and Malahallo are, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the relation of travellers, the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.
But there are many others in the
new world of which we have no knowledge.
M. Bouguer, in his voyage to Peru, publiſhed in
the Memoirs of the Academy for the year 1744,
mentions two volcano's, the one called <hi>Cotopaxi,</hi>
and the other <hi>Pichincha.</hi> The firſt is at ſome
diſtance from, and the other very near, the town
of Quito. In the year 1742, he ſaw an erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Cotopaxi, which, at that time, burſt
open a new mouth in the mountain. It did no
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:0195400701:452"/>
other damage than that of melting the ſnow,
and producing ſuch torrents, as, in three hours,
laid the whole country, to the extent of 18
leagues, under water, and overturned every thing
that came in their way.</p>
               <p>Popochampeche and Popocatepec are the
chief volcano's in Mexico. It was near this laſt
that Cortes paſſed in his way to the city of
Mexico: Some of the Spaniards aſcended to the
top of the mountain, where they found the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be about half a league in circumference.
Sulphureous mountains have alſo been found in
Guadaloupe, Tercera, and in others of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zore
iſlands; and, if all the mountains from
which ſmoke or flames iſſue were to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as volcano's, their number would exceed
60. We have only mentioned thoſe which are
ſo formidable as, by their frequent eruptions, to
prevent people from living near them.</p>
               <p>The numerous volcano's in the Cordeliers,
as I formerly remarked, produce almoſt perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
earthquakes, which prevent the inhabitants
from building with ſtone any higher than the firſt
floor; and the upper part of their houſes, for the
ſame reaſon, are conſtructed with ruſhes or very
light wood. In theſe mountains there are alſo
many precipices and large gulfs, the walls of
which are black and burned: They are ſimilar
to the precipice of Mount Ararat in Armenia,
called the <hi>Abyſs,</hi> and are the craters of extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
volcano's.</p>

A late earthquake at Lima was attended with
the moſt dreadful effects. The town of Lima,
and the port of Callao, were almoſt entirely
ſwallowed up. But the miſchief was ſtill more
terrible at Callao. The ſea roſe and covered
every houſe in that unfortunate town, and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the whole inhabitants, leaving only a ſingle
tour as a monument of its devaſtations. Of 25
veſſels that lay in the harbour, four were driven
a league upon land, and the reſt ſwallowed up
by the waves. Of Lima, which was a very large
city, only 27 houſes remained ſtanding. Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of people periſhed; and the diſaſter was
particularly fatal to the monks and other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
becauſe their buildings were lofty, and of
more ſolid materials than the common houſes.
This calamity happened in the month of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
1746, during the night; and the ſuccuſſion
laſted 15 minutes.</p>
               <p>Near the port of Piſca, in Peru, there was
formerly a famous city, ſituated on the ſea-coaſt;
but, on the 19th of October 1682, it
was almoſt entirely deſtroyed by an earthquake;
for the ſea, having exceeded its uſual limits,
ſweeped away this unfortunate city, with all its
inhabitants.</p>
               <p>By conſulting hiſtorians and travellers, we
ſhall find many accounts of earthquakes, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of volcano's, equally dreadful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
as thoſe we have already mentioned.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0195400701:454"/>
Peſidonius, quoted by Strabo<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 1.</note>, relates, that a
city of Phoenicia, near Sidon, was ſwallowed
up by an earthquake, with the neighbouring
territory, and two thirds of Sidon itſelf; that
this effect was not produced ſo ſuddenly as to
prevent the inhabitants from eſcaping by flight;
that it extended over moſt of Syria, and as far
as the Cyclades iſlands and Euboea, where the
fountains of Arethuſa ſuddenly ſtopped, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
a few days afterwards by new ſources at
a conſiderable diſtance from the old ones; and
that the earthquake continued to ſhake the iſland
ſometimes in one place, and ſometimes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till the earth opened in the valley of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panta,
and diſcharged a great quantity of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
matter. Pliny informs us<note n="†" place="bottom">Lib. 1. c. 84.</note>, that, in the
reign of Tiberius, twelve cities in Aſia were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned;
and he mentions<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lib. 2. c. 83.</note>, in the following
terms, a prodigy occaſioned by a violent earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.

&amp;c. St Auguſtin tells us<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 2. de miraculis, c. 3.</note>, that, in Lybia, 100
towns were deſtroyed by an earthquake. In
the time of Trajan, the earth opened and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
the city of Antioch, and a great part of
the adjacent country. It was again deſtroyed
by the ſame cauſe during the reign of Juſtinian
in the year 528, and 40,000 of its inhabitants
periſhed. It was viſited with a third earthquake
in the days of St Gregory, ſixty years after the
former, which deſtroyed no leſs than 60,000 of
its inhabitants. In the reign of Saladin, <hi>anno</hi>
1182, moſt of the cities of Syria and of Judea
were laid waſte by the ſame calamity. Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
have been more frequent in Apulia and
Calabria than in any other part of Europe. In
the time of Pope Pius II. all the churches and
palaces of Naples were thrown down, and about
30,000 lives were loſt: Thoſe who eſcaped were
obliged to live in tents till houſes were built for
them. In 1629, 7000 perſons periſhed in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulia
by earthquakes; and, in 1638, the city
of Saint Euphemia was ſwallowed up, and left
behind it nothing but a ſtinking lake: At the
ſame time, Raguſa and Smyrna were almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
deſtroyed. In 1692, an earthquake was
felt in Britain, Holland, Flanders, Germany,
and France: It was moſt ſevere along the coaſts
of the ſea, and near great rivers. It agitated at
leaſt 2600 ſquare leagues, though it laſted but
two minutes. The commotion was greater in
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0195400701:456"/>
the mountains than in the vallies<note n="*" place="bottom">See Ray's diſcourſes, p. 272.</note>. On the
10th of July 1688, there was an earthquake at
Smyrna, which began with a motion from weſt
to eaſt. The caſtle was firſt overturned; its
four walls ſeparated from each other, and ſunk
ſix feet in the ſea. This caſtle ſtood formerly
on an iſthmus, which is now a real iſland, about
100 paces from the land. The eaſt and weſt
walls fell; but the north and ſouth walls ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.
The city, which is near ten miles from
the caſtle, was overthrown ſoon after. The
earth opened in many places, attended with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
noiſes; and five or ſix dreadful ſhocks
were felt before the approach of night, the laſt
of which laſted about half a minute. The veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
in the roads were greatly agitated; the
ground on which the town ſtood ſunk two feet;
and not above a fourth of the houſes withſtood
the concuſſion, and thoſe were moſtly founded
on rock. From fifteen to twenty thouſand lives
were loſt<note n="†" place="bottom">See l'hiſt. de l'acad. des ſciences, anné 1688.</note>. In 1695, an earthquake was felt
at Bologna in Italy; and it was remarked, as a
ſingular phaenomenon, that the ſea was much
troubled the day preceeding<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. année 1696.</note>.</p>
               <p>'On the 4th of May 1614, a terrible earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
happened at Tercera, which, beſides
private houſes, overturned eleven churches
and nine chapels in the city of Angra; and
the city of Praya was ſo much ſhaken, that
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:0195400701:457"/>
hardly a houſe was left ſtanding: And, on
the 15th of June 1628, the iſland of St Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
was viſited with a great earthquake.
Near this iſland, in the open ſea, there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe
a new iſland in a place where the water
was 150 fathoms deep. This iſland was more
than a league and a half long, and above ſix
fathoms high<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mandelſlo's voyages.</note>.'</p>
               <p>'In the iſland of St Michael, another earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
began on the 26th of July 1691, and
continued to the 12th of the following month.
Tercera and Fayal were ſhaken next day with
ſuch violence, that they ſeemed to turn about;
theſe concuſſions, however, were repeated
there only four times: But, at St Michael,
they ceaſed not a moment during the ſpace
of eleven days. The iſlanders abandoned their
houſes, which every where tumbled down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes, and remained the whole time
in the open fields, expoſed to the injuries of
the weather. The whole town of Villa Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
was overturned to the foundation, and moſt
of the inhabitants were buried under its ruins.
In ſeveral places, the plains were elevated into
hills, and, in others, the hills ſunk down into
vallies. A fountain of freſh water iſſued from
the ground, and run for four days, and then
ſtopped all of a ſudden. The air and the ſea
were in ſuch commotion, that they made a
noiſe reſembling the bellowings of ferocious
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:0195400701:458"/>
animals. Many people died of fear. There
was not a veſſel in the harbours which were
not agitated in a dangerous manner; and thoſe
which lay at anchor, or were under ſail, at
the diſtance of twenty leagues, were ſtill more
roughly handled. Earthquakes are very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

Cagayon. In 1645, a third part of the city
was deſtroyed by a ſimilar accident, and 300
perſons periſhed in the ruins. The following

and it was attended, eſpecially at Rome, with
a remarkably clear ſky, and a great calmneſs

the old ſprings, new ones, about a mile diſtant,
appeared: They are probably the ſame waters,

               <p>'Earthquakes, alſo,' ſays Mr Shaw, 'have
ſometimes been felt at ſea. In the year 1724,
when I was aboard the Gazella, an Algerine
cruiſer of 50 guns, bound to Bona to relieve
the garriſon, we felt three prodigious ſhocks,
one after another, as if a weight, at each time,
of 20 or 30 ton, had fallen from a great height
upon the ballaſt. This happened when we
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:0195400701:462"/>
were five leagues to the ſouthward of the Seven
Capes, and could not reach ground with a line
of 200 fathom. The captain told me, that, a
few years before, when he was upon a cruiſe,
he felt a much greater one, at the diſtance of
40 leagues to the weſtward of the rock of Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon<note n="†" place="bottom">Shaw's travels, p. 151.</note>.'</p>
               <p>Schouten, ſpeaking of an earthquake which
happened in the Moluccas, ſays, that the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
were ſhaken, and that the veſſels at anchor
in 30 or 40 fathom water, were ſhocked, as if
they had run aſhore, or ſtruck againſt rocks.
'We learn,' continues he, 'from daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that the ſame happens in the ocean, where
no bottom can be found; and that earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
agitate veſſels, even when the ſea is
perfectly calm<note n="‡" place="bottom">Voyages, vol. 6, p. 103.</note>.'</p>
               <p>Gentil, in his voyage round the world, has
the following remarks upon earthquakes: '1.
That, half an hour before the earth begins to
ſhake, all animals appear to be ſeized with a
panic. The horſes neigh, break their halters,
and run out of the ſtable; the dogs bark; the
birds, as if ſtupid, fly for ſhelter into the
houſes; the rats and mice come out of their
holes, &amp;c. 2. That ſhips at anchor are ſo
violently agitated, that all the parts of which
they are compoſed ſeem to be torn aſunder;
their guns break looſe, and their maſts ſpring:
Theſe facts I ſhould hardly have credited, if
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:0195400701:463"/>
they had not been confirmed to me by the
unanimous teſtimony of many witneſſes. I
know that the bottom of the ſea is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the land; and that agitations of the
one muſt be communicated to the other; but
I could not comprehend how the different
parts of a veſſel, ſwimming in a fluid, ſhould
be affected in the ſame manner as if ſhe had
been reſting on the ground. Her motion, I
imagined, ſhould have only reſembled that
produced by a ſtorm; beſides, in the preſent
inſtance, the ſurface of the ſea was ſmooth,
and the whole agitation muſt have proceeded
from ſome internal cauſe, becauſe, at the time
of the earthquake, there was no wind. 3.
That, if the cavern of the earth which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the ſubterranean fire, runs from north to
ſouth, and if the buildings of a town above it
lie in the ſame direction, the whole houſes are
overturned; but, if the vein or cavern runs
acroſs the town, the damage produced by the
earthquake is leſs conſiderable<note n="†" place="bottom">See Voyage de M. le Gentil, tom. 1. p. 172.</note>.'</p>
               <p>When a new volcano breaks out in countries
ſubject to earthquakes, they almoſt entirely ceaſe,
and are ſeldom felt, except during great erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as has been obſerved with regard to the
iſland of St Chriſtophers<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Phil. Tranſ. abridg. vol. 2. p. 392.</note>.</p>
               <p>The enormous ravages produced by earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
have induced ſome naturaliſts to imagine,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:0195400701:464"/>
that mountains, and all the other irregularities
on the ſurface of the globe, have derived their
origin from ſuccuſſions of the earth occaſioned by
the action of ſubterraneous fires. This, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
is the opinion of Mr Ray. He believes
that all the mountains have been formed by
earthquakes, or by the exploſions of volcano's,
in the ſame manner as Monti di Cinere in Italy,
the new iſland near Santorini, &amp;c. But he has
not conſidered, that the ſmall elevations formed
by earthquakes, or by the eruptions of volcano's,
are not, like all other mountains, compoſed of
horizontal ſtrata; for, by digging into the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti
di Cinere, we find calcined ſtones, aſhes, burnt
earth, iron-droſs, pumice-ſtones, all blended
together like a heap of rubbiſh. Beſide, if earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
and ſubterraneous fires had raiſed the
great mountains of the earth, as the Cordeliers,
Mount Taurus, the Alps, &amp;c. the prodigious
force requiſite to elevate theſe enormous maſſes
would, at the ſame time, have deſtroyed a great
part of the ſurface of the globe. Earthquakes
ſufficient to produce ſuch effects, muſt have
been inconceivably violent, ſince the greateſt
of them recorded in hiſtory have not been able
to produce a ſingle mountain. In the reign of
Valentinian I. for inſtance, an earthquake was
felt over the whole known world<note n="†" place="bottom">Ammian. Marcellin. lib. 26. c. 14.</note>, and yet not
a mountain was raiſed by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:0195400701:465"/>
It is capable of demonſtration, however, that,
though an earthquake ſhould have a force ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to raiſe the higheſt mountains, this force
would not be able to diſplace the reſt of the
globe.</p>
               <p>For, let it be ſuppoſed, that the chain of high
mountains which traverſe South America from
the point of Terra Magellanica to New Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da
and the Gulf of Darien, had been ſuddenly
elevated by an earthquake, and then let us eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the effect of this exploſion. This chain of
mountains is about 1700 leagues long, and, at
a medium, 40 leagues broad, including the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erres,
which are lower than the Andes. This
gives a ſurface of 68,000 ſquare leagues. The
thickneſs of the matter diſplaced by the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
I ſuppoſe to be one league; or, that the
mean height of the mountains from their ſummits
to the caverns, which, agreeable to this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,
muſt ſupport them, is one league. The
force of the exploſion, therefore, muſt have ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated,
to the height of a league, a quantity of
earth equal to 68,000 cubic leagues. But, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and reaction being equal, this exploſion
muſt have communicated an equal quantity of
motion to the whole globe. Now, the whole
globe conſiſts of 12,310,523,801 cubic leagues.
From this number take 68,000, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
12,310,455,801 cubic leagues, of which
the quantity of motion would be equal to that of
68,000 elevated one league. Hence it appears,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:0195400701:466"/>
that the force neceſſary to raiſe 68,000 cubic
leagues would not be ſufficient to diſplace the
whole globe a ſingle inch.</p>
               <p>There is no abſolute impoſſibility, therefore,
in the ſuppoſition, that the mountains have been
raiſed by earthquakes, were it not evident, both
from their internal ſtructure and their external
figure, that they have been formed by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the waters of the ocean. Their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
parts are compoſed of parallel ſtrata, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed
with ſea-ſhells; and their external figure
conſiſts of angles every where correſponding. Is
it credible that this uniform ſtructure, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
figure, could have been produced by ſudden
and deſultory ſuccuſſions of the earth?</p>
               <p>But, as this notion has been embraced by
ſome philoſophers, and, as the nature and effects
of earthquakes are not well underſtood, I ſhall
hazard a few ideas, which may perhaps throw
ſome light upon this intricate ſubject.</p>
               <p>The ſurface of the earth has undergone many
changes. At conſiderable depths, we find holes,
caverns, ſubterraneous rivulets, and voids, which
ſometimes communicate with each other by
means of chinks and fiſſures. There are two
ſpecies of caverns: The firſt are thoſe which
have been formed by volcano's and the action
of ſubterraneous fires. The action of ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
fire elevates, ſhakes, and throws off to a
diſtance the ſuperincumbent materials; at the
ſame time, it ſplits and deranges thoſe on each
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:0195400701:467"/>
ſide of it, and thus produces caverns, grottos,
and irregular hollows. But ſuch effects are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exhibited in the neighbourhood of volcano's,
and are not ſo frequent as the other ſpecies of
caverns which are produced by the operation of
water. It has already been remarked, that the
different ſtrata of the earth are all interrupted by
perpendicular fiſſures, the origin of which ſhall
be afterwards explained. The waters that fall
upon the ſurface deſcend through thoſe fiſſures,
collect when their progreſs is prevented by a
ſtratum of clay, and form ſprings and rivulets.
From the nature of water, it ſearches for cavities
or ſmall vacuities, and has a conſtant tendency
to force a paſſage, till it finds a proper vent.
Wherever it goes, it carries along with it ſand,
gravel, and other bodies, which it is capable of
dividing or diſſolving. In this manner, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
of water proceeds till it forms ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
paſſages; and then it breaks out in the
form of fountains, either on the ſurface of the
earth, or in the bottom of the ſea. The mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
which it perpetually carries off leave hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
or caverns in the bowels of the earth,
which are often of great extent; and theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
have a very different origin from thoſe
produced by volcano's or earthquakes.</p>
               <p>Earthquakes are of two kinds: The one is
occaſioned by the action of ſubterraneous fires,
and by the exploſions of volcano's, and are only
felt at ſmall diſtances, previous to, or during the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:0195400701:468"/>
time of eruptions. When the inflammable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in the bowels of the earth begin to ferment
and to burn, the fire makes an effort to eſcape
in every direction; and, if it finds no natural
vents, it forces a paſſage, by elevating and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off the earth above it. In this manner vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's
commence, and their effects continue in
proportion to the quantity of inflammable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they contain. When the quantity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
matter is inconſiderable, it produces only
an earthquake, and exhibits no marks of a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano:
The air generated by ſubterraneous fire
may alſo eſcape through ſmall fiſſures; and, in
this caſe, likewiſe, it will be attended with a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion
of the earth; but no volcano will appear.
But, when the quantity of inflamed matter is
great, and when it is confined on all ſides by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
and compact bodies, an earthquake and a
volcano are the neceſſary conſequences. But all
theſe commotions conſtitute only the firſt ſpecies
of earthquakes, which are not felt but in the
neighbourhood of the places where they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
A violent eruption of Aetna, for example,
will ſhake all the iſland of Sicily; but it will
never extend to the diſtance of three or four
hundred leagues. When Veſuvius burſts open
a new mouth, it excites an earthquake in Naples
and in the neighbourhood of the volcano; but
theſe earthquakes never ſhake the Alps; nor do
they extend to France or other countries diſtant
from Veſuvius. Thus, earthquakes produced
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:0195400701:469"/>
by volcano's are limited to a ſmall ſpace; they
are nothing but effects of the reaction of the fire,
and they ſhake the earth in the ſame manner as
the exploſion of a powder-magazine occaſions
an agitation to the diſtance of ſeveral leagues.</p>
               <p>But there is another ſpecies of earthquakes,
which are very different in their effects, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
alſo in their cauſe. Theſe earthquakes
are felt at great diſtances, and ſhake a long tract
of ground, without the intervention either of a
new volcano, or of eruptions in thoſe that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
exiſt. There are inſtances of earthquakes
which have been felt at the ſame time in Britain,
in France, in Germany, and in Hungary. Theſe
earthquakes always extend more in length than
in breadth. They ſhake a zone or belt of earth
with greater or leſs violence in different places;
and they are generally accompanied with a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
noiſe, like that of a heavy carriage rolling
with rapidity.</p>
               <p>As to the cauſes of this ſpecies of earthquake,
it muſt be remarked, that the exploſion of all
inflammable ſubſtances, like that of gun-powder,
generates a great quantity of air; that this air
is highly rarified by the heat; and that its effects,
from the compreſſion it receives by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſined
in the bowels of the earth, muſt be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
violent. Let us ſuppoſe, that, at the depth
of 100 or 200 fathoms, there are a vaſt collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of pyrites and ſulphureous bodies, and that
they are inflamed by the fermentation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:0195400701:470"/>
by the admiſſion of water to them, or by
other cauſes. What muſt be the effect? In the
firſt place, thoſe ſubſtances are not placed in
horizontal beds, like the antient ſtrata, which
were formed by the ſediments of the waters;
they are lodged, on the contrary, in the
perpendicular fiſſures, in ſubterraneous caverns,
and other places, to which the water has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
When inflamed, they generate a vaſt
quantity of air, the ſpring of which, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compreſſed in a ſmall ſpace, like that of a
cavern, will not ſhake the earth immediately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
but it will ſearch for paſſages in order to
expand and make its eſcape. Caverns, and the
channels of ſubterraneous rivulets and ſprings,
are the only natural paſſages for this rarified air.
Into theſe, therefore, it will ruſh with impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
and produce in them a furious wind, the
noiſe of which will be heard on the ſurface; and
it will be attended with vibrations or ſuccuſſions
of the ground. This ſubterraneous wind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by fire, will extend the whole length of
the caverns or channels, and occaſion a ſhaking,
more or leſs violent, in proportion to its diſtance
from the heat, and to the width or narrowneſs
of the canals. But this motion muſt neceſſarily
run in a longitudinal direction; and the ſhaking,
of courſe, muſt be felt over a long belt of ground.
This air, however, cannot produce an eruption
or a volcano; becauſe it finds ſufficient room
for expanding itſelf, and diminiſhing its force;
or rather, becauſe it eſcapes through fiſſures in
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:0195400701:471"/>
the form of vapour or of wind. But, although
the exiſtence of caverns or channels for the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of this rarified air ſhould be denied, it is
eaſy to conceive, that, in the very place where
the exploſion is made, as the earth is elevated to
a conſiderable height, the neighbouring places
muſt ſplit horizontally in attempting to yield to
the impulſe communicated by the original mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and, in this manner, paſſages may be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
and ſucceſſively opened, ſo as to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with very diſtant places. This explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
correſponds with all the phaenomena. Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
are not felt at great diſtances at the ſame
minute, or even the ſame hour. They are not
accompanied with eruptions or external fire;
and the noiſe almoſt conſtantly marks the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive
motion of this ſubterraneous wind. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
facts concur in eſtabliſhing this theory.
Blaſts of wind, and vapours, ſometimes of a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focating
nature, it is well known, ariſe from
mines, independent of the motion in the air pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the current of water. It is equally
well known, that winds iſſue from certain aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the earth, from caverns, abyſſes, and
deep lakes, as lake Boleſlaw in Bohemia, which
we have formerly mentioned.</p>
               <p>When theſe remarks are conſidered, I cannot
comprehend how the mountains ſhould have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginated
from earthquakes, ſince the mineral
and ſulphureous bodies which occaſion them
are ſeldom to be met with but in the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:0195400701:472"/>
fiſſures of mountains, and in other cavities of
the earth, the greateſt number of which have
been produced by the operation of water; ſince
thoſe inflammable ſubſtances produce only a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
exploſion, and violent winds which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the channels of ſubterraneous waters; ſince
the duration of earthquakes on the ſurface of the
earth is ſo ſhort, they muſt be occaſioned by a
ſudden exploſion, and not by a continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration;
and, <hi>laſtly,</hi> ſince thoſe earthquakes,
which extend over large tracts of ground, never
produce the ſmalleſt eminence throughout their
whole courſe.</p>
               <p>Earthquakes, it is true, are more frequent in
the neighbourhood of volcano's, as in Sicily, and
the environs of Veſuvius: But it appears, from
repeated obſervation, that theſe earthquakes are
very limited, and, conſequently, can never form
a chain of mountains.</p>
               <p>It has ſometimes been remarked, that the
matters ejected from Aetna, after cooling for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
years, and being afterwards moiſtened with
rain, have rekindled, and thrown out flames with
ſuch violent exploſions, as to occaſion ſmall
earthquakes.</p>
               <p>In 1669, during a violent eruption of Etna,
which began on the 11th of March, the ſummit
of the mountain ſunk conſiderably<note n="*" place="bottom">See Phil. Tranſ. abridg. vol. 2. p 387.</note>; which is
a proof that this volcano proceeds rather from
the ſuperior part of the mountain than from
the bottom of it. Borelli, who is of the ſame
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:0195400701:473"/>
opinion, obſerves, 'That the fire of a volcano
proceeds neither from the centre, nor from the
bottom of a mountain, but from the top; and
that the inflammation never kindles but at a
ſmall depth<note n="*" place="bottom">Borelli de incendiis montis Aetnae.</note>.'</p>
               <p>Mount Veſuvius has frequently thrown out,
during eruptions, great quantities of boiling wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Mr Ray, who imagines that the fire of
volcano's comes from a very great depth, ſays,
that this water proceeds from the ſea, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates,
by ſubterraneous paſſages, with the
foot of the mountain. As a proof, he mentions
the remarkable dryneſs of the top of Veſuvius,
and the agitation of the ſea during eruptions,
which ſometimes recedes ſo far as to leave the
port of Naples entirely dry. But, ſuppoſing
theſe facts to be true, they by no means prove
that the fire of volcano's proceeds from a great
depth; for the water they eject is certainly rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,
which penetrates through the fiſſures, and
collects in the cavities of the mountain. Rills
and ſprings iſſue from the tops of volcano's as
well as from other high mountains; and, as the
former are hollow, and have ſuffered more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions
than the latter, nothing can be more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
than they ſhould collect water in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns,
and that theſe waters ſhould ſometimes
be ejected, along with other ſubſtances, in the
time of eruptions. With regard to the motion
of the ſea, it ariſes ſolely from the ſhock com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:0195400701:474"/>
to the waters by the exploſion, which
makes it advance or retire according to different
circumſtances.</p>
               <p>The moſt common ſubſtances thrown out by
volcano's, are torrents of melted minerals, which
overflow the environs of the mountain. Theſe
rivers of lava extend to great diſtances; and, in
cooling, they form beds, either horizontal or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
in the ſame manner as the ſtrata accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by ſucceſſive ſediments from water; but
the former are eaſily diſtinguiſhable from the
latter: 1. Becauſe ſtrata of lava are not every
where equal in thickneſs. 2. Becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
nothing that has not evidently been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined,
vitrified, or melted. 3. Becauſe their
extent is more limited. As there is a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of volcano's in Peru, and, as the bottoms of
moſt of the Cordeliers are covered with ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that have been thrown out by eruptions, it
is not ſurpriſing that no ſea-ſhells have been
found there; for they muſt have been calcined
and deſtroyed by the fire. But I am ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded,
that, if the clay ground, which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to M. Bourguet, is the ordinary earth in the
valley of Quito, had been dug, ſhells would have
been diſcovered there, as well as every where
elſe, eſpecially where the ground is not covered,
like the bottoms of the mountains, with matters
ejected from volcano's.</p>
               <p>It has often been aſked, Why all volcano's
appear only on high mountains? I have partly
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:0195400701:475"/>
ſolved this queſtion in the preceding article.
But, before finiſhing the preſent ſubject, I ſhall
endeavour more fully to explain myſelf.</p>
               <p>The peaks or points of mountains were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
covered with earth and ſand, which, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being gradually waſhed down to the vallies
by the rains, left nothing but thoſe bare rocks
or ſtones called the core of mountains, which,
being likewiſe ſubjected to the action of the
weather, ſmall and large fragments of them muſt
have been occaſionally looſened, and, of courſe,
muſt have rolled down to the plains. The rocks
at the baſe of the ſummit being fully uncovered,
and having loſt their original ſupport from the
ſand and earth, would neceſſarily give way a
little, and, by ſeparating from each other, would
produce ſmall intervals. But this yielding of
the lower rocks could not take place without
rending thoſe that lay above them. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the core of the mountain, from the ſummit
to the baſe of the lower rocks, would be ſplit
into an infinite number of perpendicular fiſſures
of different dimenſions. Through theſe the rains
would penetrate and carry along with them, into
the bowels of the mountain, all the minerals, and
other ſubſtances which they were capable of
tranſporting or diſſolving. Here pyrites, ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
and other combuſtible ſubſtances, would be
produced; and, in the courſe of time, theſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
would accumulate in great quantities, and,
by their fermentation, would give riſe to explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:0195400701:476"/>
and other effects of volcano's. Heaps of
theſe mineral ſubſtances might likewiſe exiſt in
the heart of the mountain, before the rain could
penetrate ſo deep. In this caſe, as ſoon as the
air or rain got acceſs to them by means of the
perpendicular fiſſures, a conflagration and vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano
would inſtantly take place. No ſuch phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
can be exhibited in plains; for, as every
thing there is at reſt, and nothing can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed,
it is not ſurpriſing that the exiſtence of
volcano's ſhould be confined entirely to the
mountains.</p>
               <p>When coal-mines are opened, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
found in clay-grounds, and at a great
depth, the mineral ſubſtances above mentioned
ſometimes kindle into flames. There are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
in Scotland, Flanders, &amp;c. of coal-mines
which have continued to burn for many years.
The admiſſion of air is alone ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this effect. But theſe inflammations occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
only ſlight exploſions, and never form vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's;
becauſe, in ſuch places, all being plain
and ſolid, the fire cannot be excited to ſuch a
degree as in burning mountains, which are full
of caverns and cliffs, through which the air pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates,
and augments the action of the fire ſo
forcibly, as to give riſe to the terrible effects we
have been deſcribing.</p>

               <p>NEW iſlands are either produced ſuddenly
by the operation of ſubterraneous fires,
or ſlowly by the accumulated ſediments of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Upon this ſubject we are furniſhed with
indubitable facts, both by antient hiſtorians, and
by modern voyagers. Seneca tells us, that, in
his time, the iſland of Theraſia<note n="*" place="bottom">Now called Santorini.</note> ſuddenly emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from the ſea, to the aſtoniſhment of many
ſpectators. Pliny relates, that 13 iſlands former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aroſe all at once from the boſom of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean,
and that Rhodes and Delos are the
chief of them. According to Ammianus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus,
Philo, Pliny, &amp;c. theſe 13 iſlands were
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:0195400701:478"/>
not formed by an earthquake or by a ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
exploſion, but were formerly concealed
under the water, which ſunk and uncovered
them. Delos was even diſtinguiſhed by the
name of Pelagia, becauſe it formerly belonged
to the ſea. Whether theſe 13 new iſlands were
produced by the action of ſubterraneous fire, or
by any other cauſe which diminiſhed the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of water in the Meditterranen, it is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
to determine. But we are informed by Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
himſelf, that the iſland of Hiera, in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of Theraſia, is compoſed of ferrugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
maſſes, and of earth which had been thrown
up from the bottom of the ſea; and, in another
place, he mentions ſeveral other iſlands which
had been formed in the ſame manner. Upon
this ſubject, however, we have facts more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and leſs involved in obſcurity.</p>
               <p>On the 23d day of May 1707, at ſun-riſing,
there appeared, at the diſtance of two or three
miles from the iſland of Theraſia or Santorini,
ſomething which had the reſemblance of a float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rock. Some men, ſtimulated by curioſity,
approached it, and diſcovered that it had ariſen
from the bottom of the ſea; that it increaſed
under their feet; that oiſters and other ſhells ſtill
adhered to the rocks; and that many pumice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones
lay on its ſurface. Two days before this
rock appeared, there had been a ſlight earthquake
in Santorini. This iſland continued to augment
conſiderably, without any accident, till the 14th
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:0195400701:479"/>
of June; it was then about half a mile in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
and 20 or 30 feet high, and the
earth was white, and mixed with clay. After
this, the ſea began to be more and more agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
vapours aroſe from it which infeſted the
iſland of Santorini, and, on the 16th of July,
17 or 18 rocks roſe all at once from the bottom
of the ſea, and united into one maſs. Theſe
phaenomena were attended with a frightful noiſe,
which continued two months; and flames iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the new iſland, which ſtill augmented
both in circumference and height; and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſions
were ſo violent, that they drove large
ſtones to more than 7 miles diſtance. The iſland
of Santorini itſelf was regarded by the antients
as a recent production; and, in 726, 1427, and
1573, it received conſiderable additions, beſide
the ſmall iſlands formed in its neighbourhood<note n="*" place="bottom">See l'hiſt. de l'acad, des ſciences, 1708. p. 23.</note>.
The ſame volcano, which, in the days of Seneca,
raiſed the iſland of Santorini, produced, in Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's
time, that of Hiera or Volcanella, and, in
our days, the rock above deſcribed.</p>
               <p>On the 10th of October 1720, a great fire
was ſeen to ariſe from the ſea near the iſland of
Tercera. Navigators being ſent, by order of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
to examine it, they perceived, on the
19th of the ſame month, an iſland, conſiſting
of fire and ſmoke; and a prodigious quantity of
aſhes, thrown to a great diſtance, as from a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano,
accompanied with a noiſe ſimilar to that
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:0195400701:480"/>
of thunder. The earth was alſo perceived to
ſhake in the neighbourhood; and a vaſt number
of pumice-ſtones were found floating on the
ſea all round the new iſland: This laſt phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon
has ſometimes been remarked in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
ſea<note n="*" place="bottom">See philoſophical tranſact. abridg. vol. 6. part 2, p. 154.</note>.</p>
               <p>The hiſtorian of the French academy<note n="†" place="bottom">Ann. 1721, p. 26.</note>, in
narrating this event, remarks, that, after an
earthquake in the iſland of St Michael, one of
the Azores, there appeared a torrent of fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this iſland and that of Tercera, which
gave riſe to two new rocks: And, in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
year, the ſame hiſtorian gives the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
detail:</p>
               <p>'M. de l'Iſle has informed the academy of
ſeveral particulars concerning the new iſland
among the Azores, which he received in a
letter from M. de Montagnac conſul at Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon.
On the 18th of September 1721, M. de
Montagnac's veſſel was moored off the fortreſs
of St Michael; and he learned the following
particulars from the pilot of the port.'</p>
               <p>'During the night of the 7th or 8th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember
1720, there was a great earthquake in
Tercera and St Michael, which iſlands are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from each other about 28 leagues, and a
new iſland roſe from the ſea. It was, at the
ſame time, remarked, that the point of the
iſland of Peak, at the diſtance of 30 leagues,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:0195400701:481"/>
which formerly threw out flames, was extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.
But a continual thick ſmoke iſſued from
the new iſland, which was diſtinctly perceived
by M. de Montagnac, as long as he continued
in that part. The pilot aſſured him, that he
had ſailed round the iſland, and approached
it as near as he could with ſafety. He ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the ſouth ſide of it with a rope of 60
fathoms; but found no bottom. On the weſt
ſide, the water was much changed: It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be mixed with white, blue, and
green; and, at the diſtance of two miles, it
ſeemed to be ſhallow and boiling. On the
north-weſt, the ſide from which the ſmoke
iſſued, he found, at 15 fathoms, a bottom of
coarſe ſand. He threw a ſtone into the ſea,
and, at the place where it fell, he obſerved the
water boil, and mount into the air with great
impetuoſity. The bottom was ſo hot, that, at
two different times, it melted a piece of ſuet
which had been faſtened to the end of the
plumb-line. The pilot likewiſe remarked,
that ſmoke iſſued from a ſmall lake, in the
midſt of a ſandy plain. This iſland is nearly
round, and high enough to be perceived, in
clear weather, at the diſtance of ſeven or eight
leagues.'</p>
               <p>'We have ſince learned, by a letter from M.
Adrien, French conſul at St Michael, dated
in March 1722 that the new iſland is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
diminiſhed; that it is nearly on a
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:0195400701:482"/>
level with the water; and that it will probably
ſoon diſappear.'</p>
               <p>From theſe, and many other facts of a ſimilar
nature, it is apparent, that inflammable bodies
exiſt under the bottom of the ſea, and that they
ſometimes produce violent exploſions. The
places where they happen may be conſidered as
ſubmarine volcano's, which differ from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
volcano's only in the ſhorter duration of
their effects; for, after the fire opens a paſſage
to itſelf, the water ruſhes in, and extinguiſhes
them. The elevation of new iſlands neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
leaves caverns, which are ſoon filled by the
waters; and the new ground, which conſiſts of
matter thrown out by the ſubmarine volcano,
muſt, in every reſpect, reſemble that of the
Monte di Cinere, and other eminences which
have been raiſed by terreſtrial volcano's. It is
on account of the water's ruſhing into the voids
and fiſſures produced by exploſions, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine
volcano's exhibit their effects leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
than common volcano's, though both
derive their origin from the ſame cauſe.</p>
               <p>To ſubterraneous, or rather ſubmarine fires,
muſt be aſcribed all thoſe ebullitions of the ſea,
and water-ſpouts, which have been remarked in
different places by mariners: They alſo produce
ſtorms and earthquakes, the effects of which are
equally felt at ſea as upon land. The iſlands
raiſed by ſubmarine volcano's are generally
compoſed of pumice-ſtones and calcined rocks.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:0195400701:483"/>
Fire has frequently been obſerved to iſſue out
of the waters of the ſea. Pliny tells us, that the
whole ſurface of the Thraſymen lake has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be inflamed; and Agricola informs us,
that, when a ſtone was thrown into the lake of
Denſtat in Thuringia, its deſcent was marked by
a train of fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> the great quantities of pumice-ſtones
diſcovered by voyagers in different parts of the
ocean, as well as in the Mediterranean, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
the exiſtence of volcano's in the bottom
of the ſea, which differ not from thoſe upon
land, either in the violence of their exploſions,
or in the matter they throw out, but only in
their rarity, and in the ſhortneſs of their dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Hence it may be remarked, that the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the ſea every way reſembles the ſurface
of the earth, not admitting even the exception
of volcano's.</p>
               <p>Between ſea and land volcano's there are
many relations. Both of them exiſt on the
tops of mountains. The Azore iſlands, and
thoſe of the Archipelago, are only the points
of mountains, ſome of which are above, and
others under, the ſurface of the water. From
the account of the new iſlands among the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zores,
it appears, that the place where the ſmoke
iſſued was only 15 fathoms deep, which, when
compared with the ordinary depth of the ocean,
demonſtrates this place to be the top of a pretty
high mountain. The ſame remark may be
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:0195400701:484"/>
made with regard to the new iſland near Santo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini.
Its depth muſt have been inconſiderable,
ſince oiſters were found attached to the rocks
which roſe above the ſurface of the water. It
likewiſe appears, that ſea-volcano's, as well as
thoſe upon land, have ſubterraneous communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations;
for, at the very time that the new
iſland among the Azores aroſe, the ſummit of
the volcano of St George, in the iſland of Peak,
ſunk. It alſo merits obſervation, that new
iſlands never appear but in the neighbourhood
of old ones; and that there are no examples of
new iſlands in open ſeas: They ought, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to be regarded as continuations of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
iſlands; and, when volcano's happen to
exiſt in the latter, it is not ſurpriſing that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſhould contain the ſame materials, which
may be kindled either by fermentation alone,
or by the action of ſubterraneous winds.</p>
               <p>Beſides, new iſlands produced by earthquakes,
or by ſubterraneous fires, are few in number.
But the number of thoſe formed by ſlime, ſand,
and earth, tranſported by rivers, or by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the ſea, is almoſt infinite. At the
mouths of rivers, ſuch quantities of earth and
ſand are amaſſed, as frequently give riſe to
iſlands of conſiderable extent. The ſea, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring
from certain coaſts, leaves uncovered the
higheſt parts of the bottom, and theſe parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
ſo many new iſlands. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
when the ſea encroaches upon the land, it
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:0195400701:485"/>
covers the plains, and the more elevated grounds
appear in the form of iſlands. It is for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that there are few iſlands in the open ſeas,
and that they are ſo numerous near the coaſts.</p>
               <p>Fire and water, though of very oppoſite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
exhibit many effects ſo ſimilar, that the
one may often be miſtaken for the other. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
the productions peculiar to theſe elements,
as chryſtal, glaſs, &amp;c. they give riſe to many
great phaenomena, which have ſuch ſtrong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances,
that they can hardly be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Water, as we have ſeen, elevates moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and forms the greateſt number of iſlands:
Some mountains and iſlands likewiſe derive their
origin from fire. The ſame obſervation applies
to caverns, fiſſures, gulfs, &amp;c. Some of them
are the effects of fire, and others of water.</p>
               <p>Caverns are, in a great meaſure, peculiar to
mountains: They are ſeldom or never found in
plains. They are frequent in the Archipelago,
and other iſlands; becauſe iſlands are generally
nothing but the tops of mountains. Caverns,
like precipices, are formed by the ſinking or
mouldering of rocks, or, like abyſſes, by the
action of fire; for, to make a cavern form a
precipice or an abyſs, nothing farther is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
than that the tops of the oppoſite rocks
ſhould come together and form an arch, which
muſt frequently happen when they are looſened
at the root, and ſhaken by earthquakes, or by
the operation of time and of the weather. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:0195400701:486"/>
may be produced by the ſame cauſes which
give riſe to gulfs, apertures, or ſinkings of the
earth; and theſe cauſes are exploſions of vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's,
the action of ſubterraneous vapours, and
earthquakes, which create ſuch commotions in
the earth as muſt neceſſarily produce caverns,
fiſſures, and hollows of every kind.</p>
               <p>The cavern of St Patrick in Ireland is not ſo
conſiderable as it is famous: The ſame remark
may be made with regard to the Grotto del Cane
in Italy, and to that of Mount Beni-guazeval, in
the kingdom of Fez, which throws out fire.
There is a very large cavern in the county of
Derby in England. It is much larger than the
celebrated cavern of Bauman, near the Black
Foreſt of Brunſwick. I was informed by the
Earl of Morton, a philoſopher more reſpectable
for his merit than his high rank, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
to this cavern, called the <hi>Devil's hole,</hi>
is larger than the door of any church; that a
ſmall river runs through it; that, after advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
ſome way, the vault of the cavern ſinks
down ſo low, that, in order to proceed farther,
it is neceſſary to lie flat in a boat, and to be
puſhed through this narrow paſſage by people
accuſtomed to the buſineſs; and that, after get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
through, the roof, or arch of the cavern,
riſes to a great height; and, after walking a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
way on the ſide of the river, the arch
ſinks again ſo low as to touch the ſurface of the
water. Here the cavern terminates. The river,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:0195400701:487"/>
which ſeems to have its ſource in this part of
the cavern, ſwells occaſionally, and tranſports
heaps of ſand, which, by accumulating, forms a
kind of blind alley, whoſe direction is different
from that of the principal cavern.</p>
               <p>In Carniola, near Potpechio, there is a large
cavern, in which is a pretty conſiderable lake.
Near Adelſperg, we meet with a cavern in which
a man may travel two German miles. It contains
ſeveral tremendous and deep precipices<note n="*" place="bottom">See Acta erud. Lipſ. anno 1689, p. 558.</note>. The
Mendip hills in Somerſet-ſhire likewiſe preſent us
with extenſive caverns, and very fine grottos.
Near theſe caverns we find veins of lead, and
ſometimes large oak-trees, buried 15 fathoms
deep. In the county of Glouceſter, there is a
large cavern called <hi>Pen-park-hole,</hi> at the bottom
of which we meet with 32 fathoms of water.
Here we alſo find veins of lead.</p>
               <p>It is apparent, that the Devil's-hole, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caverns, from which iſſue large ſprings or
brooks, have been gradually formed by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the water, and their origin cannot be
aſcribed to earthquakes or volcano's.</p>
               <p>One of the largeſt and moſt ſingular caverns
we are acquainted with, is that of Antiparos, of
which M. Tournefort has given a complete de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.
We firſt find a ruſtic cave about 30
feet wide, divided by ſome natural pillars. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two pillars on the right, the ground ſlops
gently, and then more precipitately for about
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:0195400701:488"/>
20 paces to the bottom of the cavern. This is
the paſſage to the grotto or interior cave, and is
nothing but a dark hole, through which a man
cannot paſs without ſtooping, and the aſſiſtance
of lights. We then deſcend, by means of a
rope fixed at the entrance, a horrible precipice,
and arrive on the very borders of another ſtill
more tremendous, with correſponding abyſſes on
the left. By a ladder placed on the margin of
theſe gulphs, we get over a vaſt perpendicular
rock. We then continue to ſlip through places
leſs dangerous. But, when we think ourſelves
in the greateſt ſafety, we are ſuddenly ſtopped
by a frightful paſs; to eſcape through which,
we are obliged to glide on our backs along a
large rock, and to deſcend by means of a ladder.
When we arrive at the bottom of the ladder, we
ſtumble for ſome time among irregular rocks,
and then the famous grotto preſents itſelf. This
grotto is about 300 fathoms below the ſurface
of the earth, and it appears to be about 40 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
high, and 50 wide. It is full of large
and beautiful ſtalactites, which both depend from
the roof of the vault and cover the floor<note n="*" place="bottom">See Tournefort's voyage to the Levant.</note>.</p>
               <p>In that part of Greece called Achaia by the
antients, now Livadia, there is a large cavern in
a mountain which was formerly famous for the
oracles of Trophonius: It is ſituated between the
Lake of Livadia and the ſea, from which, at the
neareſt part, it is diſtant about four miles; and
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:0195400701:489"/>
there are no leſs than 40 ſubterraneous paſſages
through which the waters run under the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<note n="*" place="bottom">See Gordon's Geography, p. 179.</note>.</p>
               <p>In all countries that are ſubject to earthquakes
or volcano's, caverns are frequent. The ſtructure
of moſt of the iſlands of the Archipelago is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
cavernous. The iſlands in the Indian
ocean, and particularly the Moluccas, appear to
be chiefly ſupported upon vaults. The land of
the Azores, of the Canaries, of the Cape de
Verd iſlands, and, in general, of almoſt all ſmall
iſlands, is, in many places, hollow and full of
caverns; becauſe theſe iſlands, as formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,
are only the tops of mountains, which
have ſuffered great convulſions either from vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano's,
or by the action of the waters, of froſts,
and of other injuries of the weather. In the
Cordelieres, where volcano's and earthquakes are
frequent, there are many caverns, precipices,
and abyſſes.</p>
               <p>The famous labyrinth in the iſland of Crete
is not the work of nature alone. We are aſſured
by M. Tournefort, that, in many parts of it, the
operation of men is evident; and, it is probable,
that this is not the only cavern which has been
augmented by art. Mines and quarries are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
digging; and, after theſe have been long
deſerted, it is not eaſy to determine whether
ſuch excavations have been the effects of nature
or of art. Some quarries are amazingly exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:0195400701:490"/>
That of Maeſtricht, for inſtance, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to ſhelter 50,000 men, and is ſupported by
more than 1000 pillars of 20 feet high; and the
earth and rock above is 25 fathoms thick<note n="*" place="bottom">See Phil. Tranſ. abridg. vol. 2. p. 463.</note>. The
ſalt mines of Poland exhibit excavations ſtill
more extenſive. Near large cities, quarries and
artificial hollows are common. But, we muſt
proceed no farther in detail. Beſides, the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men, however great, will always make
but an inconſiderable figure in the hiſtory of
nature.</p>
               <p>Volcano's and water which form caverns in
the bowels of the earth, produce likewiſe on its
ſurface, fiſſures, precipices, and abyſſes. At
Cajeta in Italy, there is a mountain which had
been formerly ſplit by an earthquake in ſuch a
manner, that the ſeparation ſeems to have been
made by the hands of men. We have already
mentioned the <hi>Wheel-track,</hi> or great fiſſure in
the iſland of Machian, the abyſs of Mount Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,
the port or gap in the Cordelieres, that of
Thermopylae, &amp;c. To theſe we might add the
gap in the mountain of the Troglodites in Arabia,
and that of the <hi>Ladders</hi> in Savoy, which was
begun by nature, and finiſhed by Victor-Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus.
Conſiderable ſinkings in the earth, the
fall of rocks, and the ſubverſion of mountains,
are frequently produced by the waters, as well
as by ſubterraneous fires. Of this many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
might be given.</p>

'In the month of June 1714, a part of the
mountain of Diableret in Valois fell ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

it appeared to have aſſumed a conical figure.
It deſtroyed 55 houſes, beſides ſeveral men, and

with the duſt; the collection of ſtones and
earth that were amaſſed on the plain, exceeded
30 Rheniſh perches in height, dammed up the

atteſted relation of this fact may be ſeen in the
Philoſophical Tranſactions<note n="†" place="bottom">Abridg. vol. 4. p. 250.</note>.</p>
               <p>In 1618, the town of Pleurs was buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the rocks at the foot of which it had been
ſituated. In 1678, a great inundation was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:0195400701:492"/>
in Gaſcony, by the ſinking of ſome
portions of one of the Pyrenees, which forced
out the water that had been pent up in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
caverns of theſe mountains. In the
year 1680, a ſtill greater inundation was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in Ireland, by the ſinking of a mountain
into caverns that had been full of water. It is
not difficult to inveſtigate the cauſe of theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
It is well known, that ſubterraneous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are every where frequent. Theſe waters
gradually work away ſand and earth in their
paſſages; and, conſequently, they may, in the
courſe of time, deſtroy the ſtratum of earth
which ſerves as a baſis to the mountain: If this
ſtratum fail more on one ſide than on another,
the mountain muſt, of neceſſity, be overturned;
or, if the baſe waſtes gradually and equally
throughout, the mountain will ſink, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overturned.</p>
               <p>Having mentioned a few of thoſe convulſions
and changes produced in the earth by what may
be called the accidents of nature, we muſt not
paſs over in ſilence the perpendicular fiſſures in
the different ſtrata. Theſe fiſſures are obvious,
not only in all rocks and quarries, but in clays,
and in every ſpecies of earth which has never
been removed from its natural poſition. They
are called perpendicular fiſſures; becauſe, like the
horizontal ſtrata, they are never oblique, but
from ſome accidental change. Woodward and
Ray talk of fiſſures, but in a general and confuſed
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:0195400701:493"/>
manner, and they never mention them under
the appellation of perpendicular fiſſures, becauſe
they imagined that they might be indifferently
either oblique or perpendicular. No author has
hitherto attempted to explain their origin, though
it is apparent, as remarked in a former article,
that they have been occaſioned by the drying of
the materials which compoſe the horizontal ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.
In whatever manner this drying ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
perpendicular fiſſures muſt have been a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
conſequence of it; for the matter of the
horizontal ſtrata could not be diminiſhed in ſize,
without ſplitting, at different diſtances, in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
perpendicular to the ſtrata themſelves.
Under perpendicular fiſſures, I comprehend, not
only the natural cracks in rocks, but all thoſe
ſeparations which have been effected by convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
accidents. When a maſs of rocks have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered
any conſiderable motion, the fiſſures are
ſometimes placed obliquely; but it is becauſe
the maſs itſelf is oblique; and the ſmalleſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to quarries of marble and lime-ſtone, or
to great chains of rocks, will convince us, that
the general direction of fiſſures is perpendicular
to the ſtrata in which they are found.</p>
               <p>The bowels of mountains are chiefly compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of parallel ſtrata of ſtones and rocks. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the parallel ſtrata, we often meet with
beds of matter ſofter than ſtone; and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
fiſſures are filled with ſand, cryſtals,
metals, &amp;c. The formation of theſe laſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:0195400701:494"/>
is more recent than that of the horizontal
ſtrata in which ſea-ſhells are found. The rains
have gradually detached the ſand and earth from
the tops of mountains, and left the ſtones and
rocks bare, which affords an opportunity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing
with eaſe both the parallel ſtrata and
the perpendicular fiſſures. On the other hand,
the rains and rivers have ſucceſſively covered the
plains with conſiderable quantities of earth, ſand,
gravel, and other bodies that are either ſoluble
in water, or eaſily diviſible by it. Of theſe have
been formed beds of tufa, of ſoft ſtone, of ſand,
of rounded gravel, and of earth mixed with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable
ſubſtances. But theſe beds contain no
ſea-ſhells, or, at moſt, but fragments of them,
which have been detached from the mountains
along with the earth and gravel. Theſe recent
beds ſhould be carefully diſtinguiſhed from the
antient and original ſtrata, in which we almoſt
univerſally find a great number of entire ſhells
placed in their natural ſituation.</p>
               <p>In examining the internal order and diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the materials of a mountain, compoſed of
common ſtone or calcinable lapidific matter, we
generally find, after removing the vegetable ſoil,
a bed of gravel, of the ſame nature and colour
with the ſtones that predominate in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
and, under the gravel, we meet with the
ſolid rock. When the mountain is cut by a
deep trench or <hi>ravine,</hi> the different banks or
ſtrata are eaſily diſtinguiſhable. Each horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:0195400701:495"/>
ſtratum is ſeparated by a kind of joint or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is likewiſe horizontal. Theſe ſtrata
generally augment in thickneſs, in proportion to
their depth or diſtance from the top of the
mountain; and they are all divided, vertically,
by perpendicular fiſſures. In general, the firſt
ſtratum under the gravel, and even the ſecond,
are not only thinner than thoſe which form the
baſe of the mountain, but ſo much cut by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
fiſſures, that only ſmall portions of
them have any coherence. Moſt of theſe fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
which exactly reſemble the cracks in
earth that has been dried, gradually diſappear as
they deſcend, and, at the baſe of the mountain,
where they cut the larger ſtrata in a more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and more perpendicular manner than thoſe
near the ſurface, their number is much ſmaller.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſtrata of rock often extend, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption,
to great diſtances. Stones of the
ſame ſpecies likewiſe are almoſt uniformly found
in oppoſite mountains, whether they be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by a narrow neck or a valley; and the
ſtrata never entirely diſappear, unleſs when the
mountain terminates in a large and level plain.
Sometimes we find, between the vegetable ſoil
and the gravel, a ſtratum of marle, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
its colour, and other qualities, to the
neighbouring beds: The perpendicular fiſſures
in the inferior rocks are, in this caſe, filled with
marle, where it acquires a hardneſs equal, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
to that of the ſurrounding ſtone; but,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:0195400701:496"/>
when expoſed to the air, it ſplits, and becomes
ſoft and ductile.</p>
               <p>The beds of ſtone which compoſe the top of
the mountains are generally ſoft and tender, but
thoſe near the baſe are exceedingly hard. The
firſt is commonly white, and of a grain ſo fine
as to be hardly perceptible. In proportion as
they deſcend, the rocks become more compact,
and have a better grain; and the loweſt beds are
not only harder than the ſuperior ones, but are
alſo more compact and more heavy. Their
grain is fine and brilliant; and they are often
ſo brittle as to break as purely and neatly as
flint.</p>
               <p>The heart of a mountain, then, is compoſed
of different ſtrata of ſtones, which are harder or
ſofter in proportion to their diſtance from the
ſummit; and they are broad at the baſe, and
ſharp and narrow at the top. The laſt is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
a neceſſary reſult of the firſt: For, as the
ſtones grow harder as they deſcend, it is natural
to think, that the currents, and other motions of
the water, which ſcooped out the vallies, and
formed the contours of the mountains, muſt
have gradually conſumed, by their lateral fric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the materials of which the mountains are
compoſed; and that this conſumption would be
proportioned to the hardneſs or ſoftneſs of the
matter acted upon. But, as the upper ſtrata are
known to be ſofteſt, and as their denſity increaſes
according as they approach the baſe, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:0195400701:497"/>
muſt, of neceſſity, have aſſumed their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
inclined, and ſomewhat conical figure.
This is one great cauſe of the declivity of
mountains; and it muſt always become more
gentle, in proportion as the earth and gravel are
brought down by the rain from their ſummits.
For theſe reaſons it is that the declivity of hills
and mountains, compoſed of calcinable bodies, is
leſs than that of thoſe which conſiſt of granite,
or of flint, in large maſſes. The latter generally
riſe almoſt perpendicularly to very great heights;
becauſe, in theſe maſſes of vitrifiable matter, the
ſuperior, as well as the inferior ſtrata, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
hard, and have preſented nearly an equal
reſiſtance to the operation of the waters.</p>
               <p>Though, in the tops of ſome hills which are
flat, and pretty extenſive, we find hard ſtone
immediately under the vegetable ſoil; yet it
ſhould be remarked, that, in every example of
this kind, what appears to be the ſummit of a
hill is only a continuation of ſome more eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
hill in the neighbourhood, the upper ſtrata of
which conſiſt of ſoft, and the inferior ſtrata of
hard ſtone; and the hard ſtone found on the
top of the firſt hill is only a continuation of the
under ſtrata of the higher hill.</p>
               <p>Still, however, on the tops of hills which are
not ſurmounted by higher grounds, the ſtone
is moſtly of a ſoft and friable nature; and hard
ſtone cannot be had without digging to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
depth. It is between theſe layers of
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:0195400701:498"/>
hard ſtone only that marble is to be found; and
it is variegated with different colours by metalic
ſubſtances carried down by rain-water, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
through the ſtrata: And it is probable
that, in every country which furniſhes ſtones,
marble would be found, if pits were dug to a
ſufficient depth: <hi>Quoto enim,</hi> ſays Pliny, <hi>loco non
ſuum marmor invenitur?</hi> It is, in fact, a more
common ſtone than is generally imagined, and
diſſers from other ſtones only in the fineneſs of
its grain, which renders it compact, and ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
of a fine and brilliant poliſh.</p>
               <p>Both the perpendicular fiſſures, and the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal
joints of quarries, are often filled, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruſted,
with concretions, which are ſometimes
tranſparent, and of regular figures, as cryſtals,
and ſometimes earthy and opaque. Water runs
through the perpendicular fiſſures, and even
penetrates the cloſe texture of the ſtone itſelf.
Stones that are porous imbibe water ſo copiouſly,
that froſt ſplits them in pieces. The rain-waters,
by filtrating through different ſtrata, are impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
with a great variety of ſubſtances. They
firſt ſink through the perpendicular fiſſures; they
then penetrate the ſtrata of ſtone, and depoſite
in the horizontal joints, as well as in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
fiſſures, ſuch matter as they collect
in their courſe, and give riſe to different concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
according to the nature of theſe ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For example, when the water filtrates
through marle, clay, or ſoft ſtone, the matter
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:0195400701:499"/>
which it depoſites is nothing but a fine pure
marle, and commonly appears in the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
fiſſures under the form of a porous, ſoft,
white, light ſubſtance, known among natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
under the name of <hi>Lac Lunae, or Medulla
Saxi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When veins of water, charged with ſtoney
matter, run along the horizontal joints of ſoft
ſtone or chalk, this matter adheres to the ſurface
of the ſtones, and forms a white, ſcaly, light,
and ſpongy cruſt, which, from its reſemblance
to the agaric, has been called <hi>mineral agaric.</hi> But,
if the ſtrata through which the water penetrates
be hard ſtone, the filter being cloſer, the water
it lets paſs will be impregnated with a ſtoney
matter more pure and homogeneous; and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
the particles being capable of a more
compact and intimate union, will form concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
nearly of equal denſity with the ſtone it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſomewhat tranſparent. In quarries of
this kind, the ſurface of the ſtones are encruſted
with undulated concretions, which entirely fill
up the horizontal joints.</p>
               <p>In grottos and cavities of rocks, which may
be regarded as the baſins or common ſewers of
the perpendicular fiſſures, the different directions
of the veins of water give different forms to the
concretions which reſult from them. Theſe
forms are generally wreathed, or reſemble an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
cone, attached to the roof of the cavern;
or, rather, they are white, hollow cylinders, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:0195400701:500"/>
of concentric coats. The impregnated
waters ſometimes fall in drops upon the floor of
the cavern, and form columns, and a thouſand
whimſical figures, to which naturaliſts have
given the different appellations of <hi>ſtalactites,</hi>
                  <hi>ſtelegmites, oſteocollae,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> when the concreting juices iſſue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from marble, or very hard ſtone, the
lapidific matter is rather diſſolved than ſuſpended
in the water, and it forms a kind of columns
with triangular points, which are tranſparent,
and conſiſt of oblique coats. This ſubſtance is
diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>ſpar</hi> or <hi>ſpalt.</hi> It is
tranſparent and colourleſs, excepting when the
ſtone or marble through which it filtrates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
metallic particles. This ſpar is of equal
hardneſs with the ſtone itſelf, and it diſſolves in
acids, and calcines with the ſame degree of heat.
Hence it is evident, that ſpar is a true ſtone, and
perfectly homogeneous. It may even be ſaid
to be pure and elementary ſtone.</p>
               <p>Moſt naturaliſts, however, conſider this as a
diſtinct ſubſtance, exiſting independent of ſtone:
It is the lapidiſic or cryſtalline juice, which, in
their eſtimation, not only cements the particles
of common ſtone, but even thoſe of flint. This
juice, they alledge, daily augments the denſity
of ſtones by reiterated filtrations, and at laſt
converts them into flint: When concreted into
ſpar, it perpetually receives freſh ſupplies of ſtill
purer juice, which increaſes both its hardneſs
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:0195400701:501"/>
and its denſity, till it changes to the conſiſtence
of glaſs, then to that of cryſtal, and at laſt it is
converted into genuine diamond.</p>
               <p>But, on this ſuppoſition, Why does the lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dific
juice produce only ſtone in ſome provinces,
and nothing but flint in others? It may be ſaid,
that the one province is leſs antient than the
other, and that the juice has not had time ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to complete its natural operations. But in
this there is not the ſhadow of probability. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
from whence does this juice proceed? If it
gives riſe to ſtones and flints, from whence does
it derive its own origin? It is obvious, that it
has no exiſtence independent of thoſe ſubſtances
which alone can impart to the water that pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
them a petrifying quality, which uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
correſponds with their nature and peculiar
properties. Thus, when it filtrates through
ſtone, it produces ſpar; when it iſſues from flint,
it forms cryſtal; and there are as many ſpecies
of this juice as of bodies from which it proceeds.
Experience confirms this account of the matter.
The waters which filtrate through quarries of
common ſtone form tender and calcinable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions
ſimilar to the ſtones themſelves. On
the other hand, the waters which exſude from
granite or from flint, produce concretions hard
and vitrifiable, and they have all the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of flint, as the former had all thoſe of
ſtone. In the ſame manner, the waters that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
through mineral and metallic ſubſtances,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:0195400701:502"/>
give riſe to pyrites, marcaſites, and metallic
grains.</p>
               <p>It was formerly remarked, that all matter
might be divided into the two great claſſes of
Vitrifiable and Calcinable. Clay and flint, marle
and ſtone, may be regarded as the two extremes
of each claſs, the intervals between which are
filled with an almoſt infinite variety of mixts,
that have always one or other of theſe ſubſtances
for their baſis.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtances belonging to the firſt claſs can
never acquire the properties of thoſe of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Stone, however antient, will for ever be
equally removed from the nature of flint, as clay
is from that of marle. No known agent can ever
force them from the circle of combinations pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to their nature. Places which produce
marble and ſtone will always continue to do ſo
as infallibly as thoſe which produce only ſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
flint, and granite, will never produce lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
or marble.</p>
               <p>If we examine the order and diſtribution of
the materials of a hill compoſed of vitrifiable
ſubſtances, we will generally find, under the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable
ſoil, a ſtratum of clay, which is likewiſe
a vitrifiable ſubſtance analogous to flint, and
which, as already remarked, is only a decompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of vitrifiable ſand; or rather, we will find,
under the ſoil, a ſtratum of vitrifiable ſand. This
ſtratum of clay or of ſand correſponds with the
bed of gravel in hills conſiſting of calcinable
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:0195400701:503"/>
matters. Below the ſtratum of clay or of ſand,
we meet with ſome beds of free-ſtone, which
ſeldom exceed half a foot in thickneſs, and they
are divided into ſmall portions by perpendicular
fiſſures. Under theſe are ſeveral ſtrata of the
ſame matter, and likewiſe beds of vitrifiable
ſand. In proportion as we deſcend, the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
is more denſe, and its thickneſs increaſes.
Below theſe, we find what I call <hi>live-rock,</hi> or
<hi>flint in large maſſes,</hi> a ſubſtance ſo hard as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the file, and all kinds of acids, more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
than vitrifiable ſand or powder of glaſs,
upon which aquafortis ſeems to have ſome effect.
When ſtruck with another hard body, it throws
out ſparks of fire, and exhales a penetrating ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurcous
vapour. This flinty ſubſtance is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
found along with beds of clay, of ſlate,
of pit-coal, of vitrifiable ſand; and it correſponds
to the ſtrata of hard-ſtone and marble, which
ſerve as the baſes of hills that conſiſt of calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
matter.</p>
               <p>The waters, in paſſing through the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
fiſſures, and in penetrating the ſtrata of
vitrifiable ſand, of free-ſtone, of clay, and of
ſlate, are impregnated with the fineſt and moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous
particles of theſe ſubſtances, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
various concretions, ſuch as tale, aſbeſtus,
and other bodies which owe their exiſtence to
diſtillation through vitriable matter.</p>
               <p>Flint, notwithſtanding its hardneſs and denſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
has, like marble and common ſtone, its exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:0195400701:504"/>
from which reſult ſtalactites of different
ſpecies, varying in tranſparency, colour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration,
according to the nature of the flint
that produces them, and to the different metallic
or heterogeneous particles it contains. Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryſtal,
all the precious ſtones, and even the
diamond itſelf, may be regarded as ſtalactites of
this kind. The flints in ſmall maſſes, the ſtrata
or coats of which are generally concentric, are
only ſtalactites, or paraſitical ſtones, from the
flints in large maſſes; and moſt of the fine opaque
ſtones are nothing but ſpecies of flint. The
ſubſtances produced by the vitrifiable claſs of
bodies are not, as we have ſeen, ſo various as
the concretions formed by thoſe of the calcinable.
Moſt of the concretions formed by flint are hard
and precious ſtones; but thoſe produced by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous
ſtones are friable, and of no value.</p>
               <p>Perpendicular fiſſures are found in flint-rocks
as well as in ſtone; they are even frequently
larger in flint, which proves this ſubſtance to be
drier than ſtone. Both the hill conſiſting of
calcinable, and that compoſed of vitrifiable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
have clay or vitrifiable ſand for their baſes,
which are the moſt commonly diffuſed matters
of the globe, and which I regard as the lighteſt,
being the ſcoriae of the vitrified matter that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes
the interior parts of the earth. Thus all
mountains as well as plains are founded either
on clay or ſand. We have ſeen, for example,
in the pits of Amſterdam, and in that of Marly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la-ville,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:0195400701:505"/>
that vitrifiable ſand was always the
deepeſt ſtratum.</p>
               <p>It may be obſerved, in moſt bare rocks, that
the walls of perpendicular fiſſures, whether they
be narrow or wide, correſpond as exactly with
each other as ſplit pieces of wood. In the large
quarries of Arabia, which conſiſt moſtly of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
the perpendicular fiſſures are frequent; and,
though ſome of them are 20 or 30 yards wide,
the ſides correſpond exactly, and leave a deep
cavity between them<note n="*" place="bottom">See Shaw's Travels.</note>. It is likewiſe common to
find, in perpendicular fiſſures, ſhells divided into
two pieces, each piece remaining attached to the
oppoſite ſides of the fiſſure; which proves, that
theſe ſhells were depoſited in the ſolid ſtratum
before it was ſplit<note n="†" place="bottom">See Woodward, p. 298.</note>.</p>
               <p>In ſome quarries mentioned by Mr Shaw, the
perpendicular fiſſures are exceedingly large; and
for this reaſon, perhaps, it is, that they are leſs
numerous. In quarries of granite and flint in
large maſſes, blocks of ſtone may be raiſed, as
the obeliſks and columns at Rome, of 60, 80,
100, and 150 feet long, without the leaſ inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
It appears, that theſe vaſt blocks have
been raiſed from the ſame quarry, and, like ſome
ſpecies of free-ſtone, that they may be had of
any given thickneſs. In other ſubſtances, the
perpendicular fiſſures are very narrow, as in clay,
in marle, and in chalk; and they are wider in
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:0195400701:506"/>
marble and hard ſtone. Some are imperceptible,
becauſe they have been filled with a matter near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſimilar to that of the ſtone itſelf; but ſtill
they interrupt the continuity of the ſtones, and
are called <hi>hairs</hi> by the workmen. I have often
remarked, that theſe hairs in marble and ſtone
differed from perpendicular fiſſures only in the
ſeparation of parts not being complete. Theſe
ſpecies of fiſſures are filled with a tranſparent
matter, which is a true ſpar. In quarries of
free-ſtone, the fiſſures are numerous, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
large, becauſe rocks of this kind have
often a leſs ſolid baſe, than that which ſupports
marble or lime-ſtone, the former generally reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon a fine ſand, and the latter upon clay.
In many places, free-ſtone is not to be found in
large maſſes; and in moſt quarries, where this
ſtone is good, the blocks lie irregularly upon one
another, in the form of cubes or parallelopipeds,
as in the hills of Fountainbleau, which appear,
at a diſtance, like the ruins of old buildings.
This irregular diſpoſition has been occaſioned by
the ſandy foundation of theſe hills allowing the
blocks to ſink and tumble upon each other, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
where quarries have been formerly
wrought, which has given riſe to a great variety
of fiſſures and intervals between the different
blocks: And it may be remarked, in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
abounding with ſand and free-ſtone, that
there are many fragments of rocks and large
ſtones in the middle of the plains and vallies;
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:0195400701:507"/>
and that, on the contrary, in countries abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with marble and hard ſtone, theſe ſcattered
fragments, which have rolled down from the
hills, are exceedingly rare. This phaenomenon
is owing to the different ſolidities of the baſes
upon which theſe ſtones are ſupported, and to
the extent of the banks of marble or lime-ſtone,
which is always more conſiderable than that of
free-ſtone.</p>

OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</head>

               <head>Of the Effects of Rains—Of Marſhes, Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
Wood and Waters.</head>
               <p>IT has already been remarked, that rains,
and the currents of water which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
continually detach, from the ſummits and
ſides of the mountains, earth, gravel, &amp;c. and
carry them down to the plains; and that the
rivers tranſport part of them to the ſea. The
plains, therefore, by freſh accumulations of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
are perpetually riſing higher; and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
for the ſame reaſon, are conſtantly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
both in ſize and elevation. Of the
ſinking of mountains, Joſeph Blancanus relates
ſeveral facts which were publicly known in his
time. The ſteeple of the village of Craich, in
the county of Derby, was not viſible in 1572,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:0195400701:509"/>
from a certain mountain, on account of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
mountain which intervened; but, 80 or
100 years afterwards, not only the ſteeple, but
likewiſe part of the church, was viſible from the
ſame ſtation. Dr Plot gives a ſimilar example
of a mountain between Sibbertoft and Aſhby, in
the county of Northampton. Sand, earth, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
and ſmall ſtones, are not only carried down
by the rains, but they ſometimes undermine and
drive before them large rocks, which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
diminiſh the height of mountains. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera,
the rocks are pointed and perpendicular
in proportion to the height and ſteepneſs of
mountains. The rocks in high mountains
are very ſtraight and naked. The large frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that appear in the vallies have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
by the operation of water and of froſts.
Thus ſand and earth are not the only ſubſtances
detached from mountains by the rains; they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
the hardeſt rocks, and carry down large frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of them into the plains. At Nant-phrancon,
in 1685, a part of a large rock, which was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
on a narrow baſe, being undermined by
the waters, fell and ſplit into a number of frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the largeſt of which made deep trenches
in the plain, croſſed a ſmall river, and ſtopped
at the other ſide of it. To ſimilar accidents we
muſt aſcribe the origin of all thoſe large ſtones
which are found in vallies adjacent to moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
This phaenomenon, as formerly remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is more common in countries where the
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:0195400701:510"/>
mountains are compoſed of ſand and free-ſtone,
than in thoſe, the mountains of which conſiſt of
clay and marble; becauſe ſand is a leſs ſolid baſis
than clay.</p>
               <p>To give an idea of the quantity of earth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
from mountains by the rains, we ſhall
quote a paſſage on this ſubject from Dr Plot's
natural hiſtory of Stafford. He remarks, that
a great number of coins ſtruck in the reign of
Edward IV. i.e. 200 years ago, were found bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
18 feet below the ſurface: Hence, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
the earth, which is marſhy where the
coins were found, augments about a foot in ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years, or an inch and a twelfth each year.
A ſimilar obſervation may be made on trees bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
17 feet below the ſurface, under which were
found medals of Julius Caeſar. Thus, the ſoil
of the plains in conſiderably augmented and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
by the matters waſhed down from the
mountains.</p>
               <p>The ſand, gravel, and earth carried down from
the mountains into the plains, form beds which
ought not to be confounded with the original
ſtrata of the globe. To the former belong the
beds of tufa, of ſoft ſtone, and of ſand and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
which have been rounded by the operation
of water. To theſe may be added thoſe beds
of ſtone which have been formed by a ſpecies of
incruſtation, none of which derive their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
from the motion or ſediments of the ſea. In
theſe ſtrata of tufa and of ſoft imperfect ſtones,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:0195400701:511"/>
we find a number of different vegetables, leaves
of trees, land or river-ſhells, and ſmall terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
animals, but never ſea-ſhells, or other produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the ocean. This circumſtance, joined
to their want of ſolidity, evidently proves, that
theſe ſtrata have been ſuperinduced upon the dry
ſurface of the earth, and that they are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
than thoſe of marble and other ſtones which
contain ſea-ſhells, and have been originally form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the waters of the ſea. Tufa, and other
new ſtones, appear to be hard and ſolid when
firſt dug out of the earth; but they ſoon diſſolve
after being expoſed to the operation of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Their ſubſtance is ſo different from that
of true ſtone, that, when broken down in order
to make ſand of them, they change into a kind
of dirty earth. The ſtalactites, and other ſtony
concretions which Mr Tournefort apprehended
to be marbles which had vegetated, are not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
ſtones. We have already ſhown, that the
formation of tufa is not antient; and that it is not
entitled to be ranked with ſtones. Tufa is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
ſubſtance, differing from ſtone or earth,
but deriving its origin from both by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of rain-water, in the ſame manner as
incruſtations are formed by the waters of certain
ſprings. Thus, the ſtrata of theſe ſubſtances are
not antient; nor have they, like the other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
been formed by ſediments from the waters
of the ocean. The ſtrata of turf are alſo recent,
and have been produced by ſucceſſive accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:0195400701:512"/>
of half corrupted trees and other vegetables.
which owe their preſervation to a bituminous
earth. No production of the ſea ever appears in
any of theſe new ſtrata. But, on the contrary,
we find in them many vegetables, the bones of
land-animals, and land and river-ſhells. In the
meadows near Aſhly, in the county of Nort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton,
for example, they find, ſeveral feet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the ſurface, ſnail-ſhells, plants, herbs, and
ſeveral ſpecies of river-ſhells, well preſerved;
but not a ſingle ſea-ſhell appears<note n="*" place="bottom">See phil. tranſ. abridg. vol. 4. p, 271.</note>. All theſe
new ſtrata have been formed by the waters on
the ſurface changing their channels, and diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
themſelves on all ſides. Part of theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
penetrate the earth, and run along the fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of rocks and ſtones. The reaſon why wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is ſeldom found in high countries, or on the
tops of hills, is, becauſe high grounds are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
compoſed of ſtones and rocks. To find
water, therefore, we muſt cut through the rocks
till we arrive at clay or firm earth. But, when
the thickneſs of the rock is great, as in high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
where the rocks are often 1000 feet high,
it is impoſſible to pierce them to their baſe; and
conſequently it is impoſſible to find water in ſuch
ſituations. There are even extenſive countries
that afford no water, as in Arabia Petrea, which is
a deſert where no rains fall, where the ſurface of
the earth is covered with burning ſands, where
there is hardly the appearance of any ſoil, and
where nothing but a few ſickly plants are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:0195400701:513"/>
In this miſerable country, wells are ſo
rare, that travellers enumerate only five between
Cairo and Mount Sinai, and the water they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
is bitter and ſaltiſh.</p>
               <p>When the ſuperficial waters can find no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
or channels, they form marſhes and fens.
The moſt celebrated fens in Europe are thoſe of
Ruſſia at the ſource of the Tanais; and thoſe of
Savolaxia and Enaſak in Finland: There are alſo
conſiderable marſhes in Holland, Weſtphalia, and
other countries. In Aſia are the marſhes of the
Euphrates, of Tartary, and of the Palus Meotis.
However, marſhes are leſs frequent in Aſia and
Africa than in Europe. But the whole plains
of America may be regarded as one continued
marſh; which is a greater proof of the modern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this country, and of the ſcarcity of its
inhabitants, than of their want of induſtry.</p>
               <p>There are extenſive fens in England, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in Lincolnſhire, near the ſea, which has
loſt a great quantity of land on one ſide, and
gained as much on the other. In the antient
ſoil many trees are found buried under the new
earth which has been tranſported and depoſited
by the water: The ſame phaenomenon is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in the marſhes of Scotland. Near Bruges
in Flanders, in digging to the depth of 40 or 50
feet, a vaſt number of trees were found, as cloſe
to each other as they are in a foreſt. Their
trunks, branches, and leaves were ſo well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that their different ſpecies could be eaſily
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:0195400701:514"/>
diſtinguiſhed. About 500 years ago, the earth
where theſe trees were found was covered with
the ſea; and, before this time, we have neither
record nor tradition of its exiſtence. It muſt,
however, have been dry-land when the trees
grew upon it. Thus the land that, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
period, was firm, and covered with wood,
has been overwhelmed with the waters of the
ſea, which, in the courſe of time, have depoſited
40 or 50 feet of earth upon the antient ſurface,
and then retired. A number of ſubterraneous
trees was likewiſe diſcovered at Youle in York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
near the river Humber. Some of them
are ſo large as to be of uſe in building; and it is
affirmed, that they are as durable as oak. The
country-people cut them into long thin ſlices,
and ſell them in the neighbouring villages, where
the inhabitants employ them for lighting their
pipes. All theſe trees appear to be broken; and
the trunks are ſeparated from the roots, as if
they had been thrown down by a hurricane or
an inundation. The wood appears to be fir; it
has the ſame ſmell when burnt, and makes the
ſame kind of charcoal<note n="*" place="bottom">See Phil. Tranſ. No. 228.</note>. In the Iſle of Man,
there is a marſh called <hi>Curragh,</hi> about ſix miles
long and three broad, where ſubterraneous fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees
are found; and, though 18 or 20 feet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the ſurface, they ſtand firm on their roots<note n="†" place="bottom">See Ray's Diſcourſes, p. 232.</note>.
Theſe trees are common in the marſhes and bogs
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:0195400701:515"/>
of Somerſet, Cheſter, Lancaſhire, and Stafford.
In ſome places there are ſubterraneous trees
which have been cut, ſawed, and ſquared by the
hands of men; and even axes, and other imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are often found near them. Between
Birmingham and Bromley, in the county of
Lincoln, there are hills of a fine light ſand,
which is blown about by the winds, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the rains, leaving bare the roots of
large firs, in which the impreſſions of the ax are
ſtill exceedingly apparent. Theſe hills have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
been formed, like downs, by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
accumulations of ſand tranſported by the
motions of the ſea. Subterraneous trees are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
frequent in the marſhes of Holland, Frizeland,
and near Groningen, which abound in turfs.</p>
               <p>Subterraneous trees are of different ſpecies,
viz. firs, oaks, birch, beech, yew, hawthorn, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
aſh, &amp;c. In the fens of Lincoln, along
the river Ouſe, and on Hatfield-chace in York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
theſe trees ſtand erect, as if they were
growing in a foreſt. The oaks are extremely
hard, and are uſed in building, where they are
ſaid to laſt long, which I think improbable, as
all the ſpecimens I have examined loſe their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity,
after being dried and expoſed to the air.
The aſhes are tender, and ſoon fall into duſt.
Some of theſe trees are evidently cut and ſawed
with inſtruments; and the hatchets, which are
ſometimes found along with them, reſemble the
knives formerly uſed in ſacrifices. Beſides trees,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:0195400701:516"/>
we alſo meet with vaſt quantities of filberds, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns,
and fir-cones, in many other fens in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland, and Ireland, as well as in the
marſhes of France, Switzerland, Savoy, and
Italy<note n="*" place="bottom">See Phil. Tranſ. abridg. vol. 4. p. 218. &amp;c.</note>.</p>
               <p>For four miles round the town of Modena,
whenever the earth is dug to the depth of 63
feet, the workmen pierce about five feet more
with a boring inſtrument, through which the
water ruſhes up with ſuch impetuoſity, that it
fills the wells to the top, almoſt inſtantaneouſly;
the water in theſe wells continues perpetually,
and is neither augmented nor diminiſhed by
rains or drought. What is ſtill more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in this ſpot, whenever the workmen dig to
the depth of 14 feet, they find the rubbiſh and
ruins of an antient city, paved ſtreets, houſes,
and different pieces of Moſaic work. Below
this, the earth is ſolid, and appears not to have
been moved. Still lower, however, we find a
moiſt ſoil mixed with vegetables; and, at the
depth of 26 feet, entire trees, as filberds, with
nuts upon them, and great quantities of branches
and leaves. At 28 feet, there is a ſtratum of
ſoft chalk, 11 feet thick, mixed with ſea-ſhells;
and, after this, we ſtill meet with vegetables,
leaves and branches of trees, till we arrive at the
depth of 63 feet, where there is a ſtratum of
ſand mixed with gravel and ſhells, ſimilar to
thoſe that appear on the coaſts of Italy. Theſe
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:0195400701:517"/>
ſucceſſive ſtrata lie always in the ſame order,
wherever pits have been dug; and ſometimes
the boring inſtrument falls in with the trunks of
large trees, which the workmen pierce with
great labour: They likewiſe meet with bones of
animals, pit-coal, flints, and pieces of iron. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazzini,
who relates theſe facts, thinks, that the

THEORY OF THE EARTH.</head>
               <head>ARTICLE XIX.</head>
               <head>Of the changes of Land into Sea, and of Sea into
Land.</head>
               <p>FROM what we have remarked in Article 1.
7. 8. and 9. it is apparent, that the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial
globe has undergone ſome great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
changes; and it is equally certain, from
what has been delivered in the other articles,
that the ſurface of the earth has ſuffered parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
alterations. Though we are not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquainted with the order or ſucceſſion of
theſe particular changes, we know the principal
cauſes which produced them. We can even di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
their different effects; and, if we were
able to collect all the facts which natural and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
hiſtory afford concerning the revolutions
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:0195400701:519"/>
which have happened on the ſurface of the earth,
our theory would unqueſtionably receive addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
ſupports, and would be rendered ſtill more
ſatisfactory.</p>
               <p>One of the principal cauſes of theſe revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
is the motion of the ſea, which has conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
invariably the ſame in all ages; for, as the
ſun, the moon, the earth, the waters, the air, &amp;c.
have exiſted from the moment of creation, the
effects of the tides, of the motion of the ſea from
eaſt to weſt, of the currents, and of the winds,
muſt have been felt for an equal time: And,
even ſuppoſing the axis of the globe to have
formerly had a different inclination, and that
the continents, as well as the ſeas, were diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
diſpoſed, the motions of the ocean, and
the cauſes and effects of the winds, would have
remained unaltered. In whatever part of the
globe the immenſe quantities of water which fill
the ocean were collected, they would be ſubject
to the ſame motions.</p>
               <p>It was no ſooner ſuſpected that our continent
might formerly have been the bottom of the
ſea, than the fact became inconteſtible. The
ſpoils of the ocean found in every place, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal
poſition of the ſtrata, and the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
angles of the hills and mountains, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be convincing proofs; for, when we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the plains, the vallies, and the hills, it is
apparent, that the ſurface of the earth has been
figured by the waters. When we deſcend into
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:0195400701:520"/>
the bowels of the earth, it is equally evident,
that thoſe ſtones which include ſea-ſhells, have
been formed by ſediments depoſited by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſince the ſea-ſhells themſelves are impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
with the ſame matter that ſurrounds them.
And, in fine, if we conſider the correſponding
angles of the hills and mountains, we cannot he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate
in pronouncing, that they received their
configuration and direction from currents of the
ocean. It is true, that, ſince the earth was firſt
left uncovered, the original figure of its ſurface
has been gradually changing: The mountains
have diminiſhed in height; the plains have been
elevated; the angles of the hills have become
more obtuſe; thoſe bodies which have been rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
about by the rivers have received a roundiſh
figure; new beds of tufa, of ſoft ſtone, of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
&amp;c. have been formed. But every thing
has remained eſſentially the ſame. The antient
form is ſtill recogniſable; and I am perſuaded,
that every man may be convinced, by his own
eyes, of the truth of all that has been advanced
on this ſubject; and that, whoever has attended
to the proofs I have given, muſt be fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that the earth was formerly under the
waters of the ocean, and that the ſurface which
we now behold, received its configuration from
the currents and movements of the ſea.</p>
               <p>We formerly remarked, that the principal
motion of the ſea is from eaſt to weſt. The
ocean, accordingly, ſeems to have gained from
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:0195400701:521"/>
the eaſtern coaſts of both the Old and the New
Continent, a ſpace of no leſs than 500 leagues.
For the proofs, we muſt refer to Art. IX. and
ſhall only here add, that the direction of all
ſtraits which join two ſeas, is from eaſt to weſt.
The ſtraits of Magellan, of Frobiſher, of Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
of Ceylon, of the ſea of Corea, and of
Kamtſchatka, lie all in this direction, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to have been formed by the irruption of
the waters, which, being forcibly puſhed from
eaſt to weſt, have opened theſe paſſages, where
the waters ſtill preſerve a ſtronger current in this
direction than in any other; for, in all ſtraits of
this kind, the tides are high and violent; but,
in thoſe ſituated on the weſtern coaſts, as that of
Gibraltar, of the Sound, &amp;c. the motion of the
tides is almoſt imperceptible.</p>
               <p>The inequalities at the bottom of the ſea
change the direction of the motion of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Theſe inequalities have originated from
ſediments and matters tranſported by the tides,
or by other movements in the water: The tides
are the principal, and firſt, though not the only
cauſe which produced theſe inequalities. The
wind is another cauſe; though its action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
at the ſurface, it agitates the whole maſs to
the greateſt depths, as appears from particular
bodies which are detached from the bottom of
the ſea, and thrown aſhore only during violent
ſtorms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="487" facs="tcp:0195400701:522"/>
It has already been mentioned, that, between
the Tropics, and even ſome degrees beyond them,
an eaſt wind blows perpetually. This wind,
which aſſiſts the general motion of the ſea from
eaſt to weſt, is as antient as the tides; becauſe
it is occaſioned by the rarefaction of the air
produced by the heat of the ſun. There are
two combined cauſes, therefore, the operation
of which is greateſt in the equatorial regions:
1<hi>ſt,</hi> The tides, which are greateſt in the ſouthern
latitudes; and, 2<hi>d,</hi> The eaſt winds, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
reign in theſe climates. Theſe two cauſes
have concurred, from the firſt formation of the
earth, in producing a motion in the waters from
eaſt to weſt, and in agitating them more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
in this region of the globe than in any
other. It is for this reaſon that we find between
the Tropics the greateſt inequalities upon the
ſurface of the earth. That part of Africa which
lies between theſe circles, is nothing but a group
of different chains of mountains, extending, for
the moſt part, from eaſt to weſt, as appears
from the direction of the great rivers which tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
this unknown region. The ſame obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
holds with regard to the countries both
of Aſia and America, which lie between the
Tropics.</p>
               <p>The general motion of the ſea from eaſt to
weſt, combined with the tides, currents, and
winds, produce a variety of effects, both on the
bottom of the ocean, and on the coaſts. Vare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:0195400701:523"/>
thinks it extremely probable, that the gulfs
and ſtraits have been formed by reiterated efforts
of the ocean againſt the land; that the gulfs of
Arabia, of Bengal, and of Cambaya, have been
produced by irruptions of the waters, as well as
the ſtraits between Sicily and Italy, between
Ceylon and India, between Greece and Euboea,
&amp;c.; that the probability of ſuch irruptions, and
of certain lands having been deſerted by the
ſea, is ſtrengthened by the ſcarcity of iſlands in
the middle of great ſeas, and by their never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
there in groups; that, in the immenſe
ſpace occupied by the Pacific Ocean, there are
only two or three ſmall iſlands near the centre
of it; and that, in the vaſt Atlantic Ocean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Africa and Braſil, we find only the ſmall
iſlands of St Helena and Aſcenſion: But all
iſlands lie near large continents, as thoſe of the
Archipelago, which approach the continents both
of Europe and Aſia; the Canaries are near Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;
the Indian iſlands lie near the eaſtern part
of the continent of Aſia; the Antilles lie off the
coaſt of America; and the Azores alone lie at a
conſiderable diſtance both from Africa and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
               <p>The popular tradition among the inhabitants
of Ceylon, that their iſland had been ſeparated
from the peninſula of India by an irruption of
the ſea, is extremely probable. The great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of rocks and ſhoals between the iſland of
Sumatra and the continent demonſtrate their
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:0195400701:524"/>
former union. The Malabarians affirm, that
the Maldiva iſlands made once a part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
of India; and, in general, we may believe,
without heſitation, that all the eaſtern iſlands
have been ſeparated from continents by irruptions
of the ocean<note n="*" place="bottom">See Varen. Geog. p. 203, 217, and 220.</note>.</p>
               <p>The iſland of Great Britain appears to have
been formerly a part of the continent; and that
England was once joined to France, the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the ſtrait, and the ſameneſs of the ſtrata
of ſtone and of earth on the oppoſite ſides, are
a ſufficient indication. If we ſuppoſe, ſays Dr
Wallis, that France was connected to England
by an iſthmus between Calais and Dover, two
tides would neceſſary ſtrike with violence againſt
each ſide of it twice every twenty-four hours;
and the operation of the ſea, both on the eaſt
and weſt of this iſthmus, would, in the courſe
of time, neceſſarily wear away ſuch a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
neck of land as we have ſuppoſed. The
tides acting with violence not only againſt
this iſthmus, but alſo againſt the coaſts of France
and of England, muſt have carried away vaſt
quantities of earth, ſand, and clay, from every
part on which the waves exerted their fury.
Their courſe, however, being interrupted by the
iſthmus, they would not, as might be imagined,
depoſite their ſediments upon its ſhores, but
would tranſport and depoſite them on the great
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:0195400701:525"/>
plain which now forms the marſh of Romney,
and is four miles broad and eight long; for no
man, who has ever ſeen this plain, can poſſibly
doubt of its having been formerly covered with
the ſea, as, without the intervention of the dikes
of Dimchurch, the ſpring-tides would ſtill over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
a great part of it.</p>
               <p>The German ſea would act in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
againſt this iſthmus and againſt the coaſts of
England and Flanders, and would carry its ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
into Holland and Zeland, the ſoil of which
was formerly under the waters, though it is now
elevated 40 feet above them. On the Engliſh
coaſt, the German ſea muſt have occupied that
large valley which commences at Sandwich,
runs by Canterbury, Chatham, Chilham, and
terminates at Aſhford, a ſpace of more than 20
miles. Here the land is much more elevated
than it was in antient times; for, at Chatham,
the bones of an hyppopotamos have been found
buried at the depth of 17 feet, and likewiſe
anchors of ſhips, and ſea-ſhells.</p>
               <p>Nothing is more apparent than that new lands
are formed by the earth, ſand, clay, &amp;c. tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported
and depoſited by the ſea: For, in the
iſland of Orkney, which is adjacent to the marſhy
coaſt of Romney, there was a flat ſpace of ground
in continual danger of being overflowed by the
river Rother; but this flat, in leſs than 60 years,
has been conſiderably elevated by the acceſſion
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:0195400701:526"/>
of freſh matter brought in by every tide. This
river has beſide deepened its channel ſo greatly,
that its mouth, which, leſs than 50 years ago,
was fordable by men, is now capable of receiving
large veſſels.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner has the bank of ſand,
which runs obliquely from the coaſt of Norfolk
to that of Zeland, been formed. This bank is
the place where the German and French ſeas
encounter ſince the rupture of the iſthmus; and
it is here where the waters depoſite the earth and
ſand which they carry off from the coaſts. It
is even not improbable but that this bank of ſand
may, in a ſucceſſion of ages, give riſe to a new
iſthmus<note n="*" place="bottom">See philoſophical tranſact. abridg. vol. 4. p. 227.</note>.</p>
               <p>It is extremely probable, ſays Mr Ray, that
the iſland of Great Britain was formerly joined
to France: Whether it was disjoined by an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
by an irruption of the ocean, or by the
operation of men, we know not. But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
junction of Britain to the continent is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
from the identity of the rocks and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſtrata, at the ſame elevation, on the oppoſite
coaſts; and from the ſimilar extent of the rocks
on each ſide, being both about ſix miles. The
narrowneſs of this ſtrait, which exceeds not 24
Engliſh miles, and its ſhallowneſs, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the depth of the neighbouring ſea, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it probable that England has been ſeparated
from France by ſome accident. To theſe proofs
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:0195400701:527"/>
we might add, that wolves and bears formerly
exiſted in this iſland: It is not probable that theſe
animals could ſwim over, nor that ſuch deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
creatures would be tranſported by men; for,
in general, the noxious animals of the continent
are found in all thoſe iſlands which are very near
it, but never in thoſe that are remote. This fact
was remarked by the Spaniards when they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
in America<note n="*" place="bottom">See Ray's diſcourſes, p. 208.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the reign of Henry I. of England, a part
of Flanders was overflowed by an irruption of
the ſea. In 1446, more than 10,000 perſons
were drowned by a ſimilar irruption in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory
of Dordrecht, and more than 100,000
round Dullart in Friſeland and in Zeland. In
theſe two provinces, above 300 villages were
overflowed. The tops of their towers and ſpires
are ſtill viſible above the ſurface of the water.</p>
               <p>From the coaſts of France, England, Holland,
and Germany, the ſea has in many places re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated.
Hubert Thomas, in his deſcription of
the country of Liege, aſſures us, that the walls
of the city of Tongres were formerly ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the ſea, though it is now 35 leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from it. This he proves by ſeveral ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
reaſons: Among others, he informs us,
that, in his time, the iron rings to which ſhips
were faſtened, ſtill remained in the walls. The
fens of Lincoln, of the iſland of Ely, and the
Crau of Provence in France, may be regarded as
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:0195400701:528"/>
lands abandoned by the ſea, which has likewiſe,
ſince the year 1665, retired conſiderably from
the mouth of the Rhone. At the mouth of the
Arno in Italy, a large quantity of land has been
gained from the ſea; and Ravenna, which was
formerly a harbour, is no longer a ſea-port.
The whole of Holland appears to be new land:
The ſurface of the ground is nearly on a level
with the ſea, although it has received daily ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
from the mud and earths tranſported by
the Rhine, the Maeſe, &amp;c.; for the ſoil of Holland
was formerly, in many places, computed to be
50 feet below the bottom of the ſea.</p>
               <p>It has been alledged, that, in the year 860, a
furious tempeſt drove ſuch quantities of ſand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the coaſt, that the mouth of the Rhine near
Catt was entirely blocked up; and that this river
overflowed the whole country, overturned trees
and houſes, and at laſt emptied itſelf into the
channel of the Maeſe. In 1421, another inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
ſeparated the city of Dordrecht from the
main land, overwhelmed 72 villages, and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
100,000 ſouls, beſide a vaſt number of cattle.
The dike of Iſſel was broke down in 1638, by
the ice-boards from the Rhine ſhutting up the
paſſage of the water, which occaſioned in the
dike an opening of ſeveral fathoms, and a great
part of the province was laid under water before
the breach could be repaired. The province of
Zeland, in 1682, ſuffered a ſimilar inundation,
which drowned more than 30 villages; and an
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:0195400701:529"/>
amazing number of men and cattle periſhed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been ſurpriſed by the waters in the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.
The loſs would have been ſtill greater,
had not a ſouth-eaſt wind oppoſed the motion
of the waves; for there was ſuch a ſwell in the
ſea, that the water roſe 18 feet above the higheſt
ground in the province<note n="*" place="bottom">See les Voyag. hiſt. de l'Europe, tom. 5. p. 70.</note>.</p>
               <p>The harbour of Hithe, in the county of Kent,
is entirely blocked up, notwithſtanding much
labour and expence beſtowed, on different occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
to clear it. For ſeveral miles round, we
find an aſtoniſhing quantity of ſhells and other
ſea-bodies, which had been accumulated in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
times, and which are now covered with
ſoil, and afford excellent paſturage. The ſea,
on the other hand, often encroaches upon the
land; as, for example, the lands of Goodwin,
which formerly belonged to a nobleman of that
name, are now converted into ſands, and are
covered with the waters of the ocean. Thus the
ſea gains upon ſome coaſts, and loſes upon others,
according to their different ſituations and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances<note n="†" place="bottom">See phil. tranſ. abridg. vol. 4. p. 234.</note>.</p>
               <p>Upon Mount Stella in Portugal, there is a
lake, in which are found the wrecks of ſhips,
though this mountain is 12 leagues diſtant from
the ſea<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Gordon's Geog. Gram. p. 149.</note>. Sabinius, in his commentary upon
Ovid's Metamorphoſes, tells us, that, in the year
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:0195400701:530"/>
1460, a ſhip, with its anchors, were found in
one of the Alpine mines.</p>
               <p>Theſe changes of ſea into land, and of land
into ſea, are not peculiar to Europe. The other
parts of the globe, if properly inveſtigated, would
furniſh more ſtriking and numerous examples.</p>
               <p>Calecut was formerly a celebrated city, and
the capital of a kingdom of that name. It is
now reduced to an inconſiderable town, ill-built,
and almoſt deſerted. The ſea, which, for a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury
paſt, has gained greatly upon this coaſt,
now covers moſt of the antient city. The veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
moor upon its ruins, and the port is chocked
up with a number of rocks, upon which many
veſſels have been wrecked<note n="*" place="bottom">See lettres edifiantes, recueil 2. p. 13<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The province of Jucatan, a peninſula in the
Gulf of Mexico, was formerly a part of the ſea.
This neck of land ſtretches about 100 leagues
in length, and is no where above 25 leagues
broad. The air is hot and moiſt. The earth
furniſhes plenty of water, though, in ſo large a
country, there are neither rivers nor brooks; and,
when pits are dug, ſuch multitudes of ſhells e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where appear, as leave little room for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that this whole tract was formerly a part of
the ocean.</p>
               <p>It is a tradition among the inhabitants of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labar,
that the Maldiva iſlands originally adhered
to the continent of India, and that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
from it by the violence of the ocean.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:0195400701:531"/>
The number of theſe iſlands is ſo great, and they
are ſeparated by ſuch narrow channels, that the
bow-ſprits of veſſels drive off, in paſſing, leaves
from the trees on each ſide; and, in ſome places,
a vigorous man, by laying hold of a branch,
may leap into another iſland<note n="*" place="bottom">See voyages des Hollandois aux Indes Orientales, p. 274.</note> The cocoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees
found at the bottom of the ſea, is a farther
proof that the Maldiva's formerly belonged to
the continent.</p>
               <p>The iſland of Ceylon, thoſe of Rammanakoiel,
and many other iſlands, it is believed, were alſo
disjoined from the continent by the currents,
which, in many places of the Indian ſea, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
rapid<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. vol. 4. p. 485.</note> It is certain, however, that the
ſea has encroached 30 or 40 leagues on the
north-eaſt coaſt of Ceylon.</p>
               <p>The ſea appears to have lately abandoned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the promontories and iſlands of America.
We have already remarked, that the territory of
Jucatan is full of ſhells; the ſame phaenomenon
takes place in the low grounds of Martinico and
the other iſlands of the Antilles. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
diſtinguiſh the earth below the ſurface by
the name of <hi>lime</hi>; becauſe they make lime of
the ſhells, great banks of which lie immediately
under the vegetable ſoil<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Nouv. Voyages aux iſles de l'Amerique.</note>.</p>
               <p>There are ſome lands which the ſea alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
covers and leaves bare, as in ſeveral iſlands of
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:0195400701:532"/>
Norway, Scotland, the Maldiva's, the gulf of
Cambaya, &amp;c. The Baltic-ſea has gradually
gained a great part of Pomerania; and it has
covered and deſtroyed the celebrated port of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta.
In the ſame manner, the Norwegian ſea
has advanced into the continent, and formed
ſeveral iſlands. The German ſea has incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon Holland, near Catt, to ſuch a degree,
that the ruins of an antient Roman citadel,
which was formerly ſituated on the coaſt, lie
now at a conſiderable diſtance in the ſea. The
marſhy ground in the iſland of Ely, and the
Crau of Provence, are, on the contrary, lands
which the ſea has deſerted. The Downs have
been formed by accumulations of ſand, earth, and
ſhells, ſucceſſively driven upon the coaſts by
winds blowing from the ſea. For example, on
the weſt coaſts of France, Spain, and Africa, a
violent weſt wind reigns, by which the waters
are puſhed with violence againſt the ſhores; and
downs, accordingly, are frequent on theſe coaſts.
The eaſt winds, in the ſame manner, when they
continue long, drive the waters ſo forcibly from
the coaſts of Syria and Phoenicia, that large
chains of rocks, which are covered during the
weſt winds, are left dry. Beſides, downs are
not compoſed of ſtones and marble, like the
mountains which have been formed in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the ocean, becauſe they have not remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
long enough under the waters. That the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the ſea poſſeſs a petrifying power, and that
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:0195400701:533"/>
the ſtones formed in the earth are very different
from thoſe formed at the bottom of the ocean,
is fully evinced in my diſcourſe on minerals.</p>
               <p>Since finiſhing my theory of the earth, which
was compoſed in the year 1744, I have peruſed
M. Barrere's, diſſertation on the origin of figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſtones. It gave me peculiar ſatisfaction to
find that the ideas of this accompliſhed naturaliſt,
concerning the formation of downs, and the
duration of the ſea upon the ſurface of the
earth which we inhabit, exactly correſponded
with my own. Aiguis-mortes, which is now
more than a league and a half from the ſea,
was a port in the time of St Louis. Pſalmodi
was an iſland in the 815; and it is now more
than two leagues from the ſea. The ſame change
has happened at Maguelone. The greateſt part
of the vineyard of Agde was covered, about 40
years ago, with the waters of the ſea. In Spain,
the ſea, within theſe few years, has retired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
from Blanes, from Badalona, from the
environs of the river Vobregat, from Cape Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſa
along the coaſt of Valencia, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſea may form hills and mountains in
different manners: 1. By tranſporting earth,
ſlime, ſand, and ſhells from one place to another:
2. By depoſiting ſediments compoſed of ſmall
particles detached from the bottom and from the
coaſts: And, <hi>laſtly,</hi> hills and downs may be
formed by ſand and other particles driven againſt
the coaſts by particular winds; theſe are gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
deſerted by the ſea, and become parts of the
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:0195400701:534"/>
dry land. The downs of Flanders and of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
are of this kind; they conſiſt of ſmall cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
or hills, compoſed of ſand and ſhells,
which have been blown from the ſea upon the
coaſts. M. Barrere gives another example, which
merits obſervation. 'The ſea,' he remarks, 'by its
motion, detaches immenſe quantities of plants,
ſand, ſhells and ſlime from its bottom, which
are continually puſhed by the winds and the
waves towards the coaſts. The perpetual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
of this operation muſt give riſe to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
accumulations of new ſtrata, which ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the earth, produce downs and hills, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
the land, and conſine the ſea within nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
bounds.'</p>
               <p>'It is apparent that new ſtrata of different
materials muſt have been formed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
attrition of the waters, by the depoſition
of ſediments, and by other cauſes, the operation
of which has been co-eval with the exiſtence
of the globe itſelf. Of this we have a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
proof in the different ſtrata of foſſil ſhells,
and other ſea bodies found at Rouſſillon near
the village of Naffiac, which is 7 or 8 leagues
from the ſea. Theſe beds of ſhells, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
at different angles from weſt to eaſt, are
divided from each other by ſtrata of earth and
ſand, ſometimes of a foot and a half, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of two or three feet in thickneſs. In dry
weather they ſeem as if ſprinkled over with
ſalt, and form a chain of hillocks from 25 to
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:0195400701:535"/>
30 fathoms high. A long chain of hillocks of
ſuch a height could not be formed at once,
but gradually, and by a long ſucceſſion of time.
Effects ſomewhat ſimilar might have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by an univerſal deluge. But, in this
caſe, the different beds of foſſil ſhells, inſtead
of preſerving a regular form, would have been
blended together without any order.'</p>
               <p>I entirely agree with the ſentiments of M.
Barrere, excepting as to the formation of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
which cannot be ſolely aſcribed to thoſe
cauſes which increaſe the land, and diminiſh the
boundaries of the ocean. On the contrary, I
think I can produce ſeveral convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove, that moſt of thoſe eminences,
which appear on the ſurface of the earth, have
actually received their original formation in the
ſea itſelf: 1. Becauſe they have correſponding
angles, which neceſſarily imply the cauſe we
have aſſigned, namely, the motion of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
2. Becauſe downs and hills, which
have originated from materials thrown upon the
coaſts, are not, like common hills, compoſed of
marble and hard ſtones. Beſides, the ſhells found
in the former, are only in the foſſil ſtate; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
thoſe in the latter are entirely petrified. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the poſition of the ſtrata equally hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal
in downs, as in the hills compoſed of
marble and hard ſtone, but are more or leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
as in the hills of Naffiac. On the contrary,
in the hills and mountains formed by ſediments
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:0195400701:536"/>
under the waters of the ſea, the ſtrata are always
parallel, and very often horizontal; and the
ſhells and other matter of them are completely
petrified. I deſpair not of being able to prove,
that the marbles and other calcareous bodies,
which are almoſt all compoſed of madrepores,
aſtroites, and ſhells, have acquired their denſity
and perfection at the bottom of the ocean. But
the tufas, ſoft ſtones, incruſtations, ſtalactites,
&amp;c. which are likewiſe calcinable, and have been
formed ſince the earth was left dry, can never
acquire the degree of denſity and of petrifaction
peculiar to marble and other hard ſtones.</p>
               <p>The remarks of M. Saulmon, concerning the
<hi>galets,</hi> which are found in many places, may be
ſeen in the hiſtory of the French Academy, <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>
1707. Theſe <hi>galets</hi> are round, flat, finely
poliſhed pieces of flint, thrown out by the ſea
upon the coaſts. At Bayeux, and at Prutel,
which is a league from the ſea, galets are found
in digging pits and wells. The mountains of
Bonneuil, of Broie, and of Queſnoy, which are
18 leagues diſtant from the ſea, are covered with
galets. They are alſo found in the valley of
Clermont in Beauvois. M. Saulmon farther
informs us, that a hole, 16 feet in length, was
pierced horizontally into the high beach of Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
which conſiſts of a ſoft earth; and that,
in the ſpace of 30 years, it was entirely oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by the ſea. Suppoſing the ſea to encroach
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:0195400701:537"/>
uniformly upon this ſhore, it will gain half a
league in 12000 years.</p>
               <p>The motions of the ſea, therefore, muſt be
regarded as the principal cauſe of all thoſe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which have already happened, and of thoſe
which are daily produced upon the ſurface of
the earth. But there are other cauſes, which,
though leſs conſiderable, have ſome effect in
changing the ſuperficial parts of this globe. The
rivers, the brooks, the melting of ſnows, the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
the froſts, &amp;c. have given riſe to many
alterations. The rains have diminiſhed the
height of the mountains; the rivers and brooks
have elevated the plains, and dammed up the ſea
at their mouths; the torrents and the melting
of ſnows have ſcooped out deep ravines or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
in the vallies and narrow paſſages between
the mountains; the froſts have ſplit rocks, and
detached them from their original ſtations: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
examples of revolutions produced by
all theſe cauſes might be given. Varenius tells
us, that the rivers tranſport into the ſea vaſt
quantities of earth, and depoſite them at greater
or leſſer diſtances from the ſhore, in proportion
to the rapidity of their currents. Theſe portions
of earth fall to the bottom, and firſt form ſmall
banks, which, by conſtant acceſſions, become
ſhoals, and at laſt appear in the form of fertile
and habitable iſlands. It is in this manner that
the iſlands in the Nile, thoſe in the river St
Lawrence, the iſland of Landa, ſituated near the
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:0195400701:538"/>
mouth of the river Coanza, on the coaſt of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,
the Norwegian iſlands, &amp;c. have received
their exiſtence<note n="*" place="bottom">See Varen. Geogr. p. 214.</note>. To theſe may be added the
iſland of Trong-ming in China, which has been
gradually formed by matters brought down by
the river Nankin, and depoſited near its mouth.
This iſland is more than 20 leagues in length,
and from 5 to 6 in breadth<note n="†" place="bottom">See Lettres edifiant. rec. 11. p. 234.</note>.</p>
               <p>The Po, the Trento, and other rivers of Italy,
bring down ſuch quantities of earth into the
<hi>lagunes</hi> of Venice, eſpecially in the time of
inundations, that they muſt be gradually filled
up. Many parts of them are already dry during
the ebb tide; and there is in them no depth of
water, excepting in the canals, which are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
at an immenſe expence.</p>
               <p>Large ſand-banks are thrown up at the
mouths of the Nile, of the Ganges, of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,
of the Plata, and of many other rivers.
La Loubere, in his voyage to Siam, informs us,
that the banks of ſand and of earth augment
daily, at the mouths of the great rivers of Aſia,
to ſuch a degree that the navigation of them
becomes every hour more difficult, and will ſoon
be impracticable. The ſame obſervation applies
to the great rivers of Europe, and eſpecially to
the Wolga, which empties itſelf by more than
70 mouths into the Caſpian, and to the Danube,
which runs into the Black Sea by ſeven mouths,
&amp;c.</p>

As it ſeldom rains in Egypt, the regular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations
of the Nile proceed from the torrents
which fall into it from Aethiopia. It brings down
vaſt quantities of mud, which it depoſites annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
not only upon the ſoil of Egypt, but
throws it to great diſtances into the ſea, where it
is laying the foundations of a new country,
which muſt ariſe, in the courſe of time, out of
the boſom of the ocean; for, upon ſounding at
the diſtance of 20 leagues from the coaſt, the
mud of the Nile is found at the bottom of the
ſea; and every year it receives freſh accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The Lower Egypt, now called the <hi>Delta,</hi>
was formerly a bay<note n="*" place="bottom">See Diodor. Sic. lib. 3. Ariſtot. de Meteor. lib, 1. cap. 14. Herodot. § 4. 5. &amp;c.</note> Homer tells us, that the
iſland of Pharos was a day and a night's voyage
from Egypt; and now it is almoſt contiguous
to the land. The ſoil of Egypt is not every
where of an equal depth; it grows thinner the
nearer we approach the ſea. Near the banks
of the Nile, there are ſometimes more than 30
feet of good ſoil; but, at the end of the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
there remain not, perhaps, above 7 inches.
All the cities of the Lower Egypt have been
built upon artificial eminences<note n="†" place="bottom">See Shaw's travels.</note> The town of
Damietta, which is now ten miles from the ſea,
was a part of the ocean in the year 1243. The
town of Fooah, which, 300 years ago, was ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
at the mouth of the Canopic branch of the
Nile, is now 7 miles diſtant from it. Within
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:0195400701:540"/>
40 years paſt, the ſea has retired half a league
from Roſetto, &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Shaw's travels.</note>.</p>
               <p>Many changes have alſo taken place at the
mouths of the great rivers of America, and even in
thoſe which have been but lately diſcovered. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levoix
tells us, that, at the mouth of the Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi,
below New Orleans, the land runs out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a point, which appears not to be very antient;
becauſe, wherever the earth is dug, plenty of
water is found; and beſides, the many little
iſlands which have recently appeared in all the
mouths of this river, leave no room to doubt
but that this point of land was formed in the
ſame manner. It is certain, ſays he, that, when
M. Salle ſailed down the Miſſiſippi to the ſea,
the mouth of this river was conſiderably dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from what it now appears.</p>
               <p>The nearer, he adds, we approach the ſea,
this difference becomes the more conſpicuous.
There is no water in moſt of the ſmall channels
cut in the bar by the river. Theſe channels
are greatly multiplied by the trees brought down
by the current. A ſingle tree, with its branches
and roots, when ſtopped in a ſhallow part of the
river, will entangle a thouſand. I have ſeen,
ſays he, 200 leagues from New Orleans, collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of trees, any one of which would ſill all
the wood-yards in Paris. Nothing can diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
them. The mud brought down by the
river ſerves as a cement to them, and gradually
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:0195400701:541"/>
covers them. Every inundation leaves a new
ſtratum; and, in a few years, plants and ſhrubs
begin to grow. It is in this manner that moſt
points of land and iſlands, which ſo often change
the courſe of rivers, are originally produced.</p>
               <p>All the revolutions, however, brought about
by rivers, are very ſlow, and become not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
till after a long courſe of years. But
thoſe which are occaſioned by inundations or
earthquakes are ſudden, and almoſt inſtantaneous.
According to the Timacus of Plato, we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
by the antient prieſts of Egypt, 600 years
before the birth of Chriſt, that there exiſted an
iſland beyond the Pillars of Hercules, called
<hi>Atlantis,</hi> which was larger than both Aſia and
Lybia taken together; and that this great iſland
was ſunk under the waters of the ocean by a
terrible earthquake. 'Traditur Athenienſis civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
reſtitiſſe olim innumeris hoſtium copiis quae,
ex Atlantico mari profectae, propè cunctam
Europam Aſiamque obſederunt; tunc enim

<hi>Plato in Timaeo.</hi> This antient tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is not devoid of probability. The lands
ſwallowed up by the waters were, perhaps, thoſe
which united Ireland to the Azores, and the
Azores to the continent of America; for, in
Ireland, there are the ſame foſſils, the ſame ſhells,
and the ſame ſea-bodies, as appear in America,
and ſome of them are found in no other part of
Europe.</p>
               <p>Two evidences are mentioned by Euſebius on
the ſubject of deluges: The one is Melo, who
affirms, that all the plains of Syria were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laid under water: The other is Abidenus,
who ſays, that, in the reign of King Siſithrus,
there was a great deluge, which had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
by Saturn. Plutarch <hi>De Solertia Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi>
Ovid, and other mythologiſts, deſcribe the
deluge of Deucalion, which happened, they ſay,
in Theſſaly, about 700 years after the univerſal
deluge. It is alſo alledged, that there was a
ſtill more antient deluge in Attica, during the
time of Ogiges, about 230 years before that of
Deucalion. In the year 1095, a deluge in Syria
drowned a prodigious number of people<note n="*" place="bottom">See Alſted, Chron. chap. 25.</note>. In
1164, a deluge in Frieſland covered the whole
environs of the coaſts, and drowned ſeveral
thouſands of the inhabitants<note n="†" place="bottom">See Krank, lib. 5. c. 4.</note>.
Another inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:0195400701:543"/>
in 1218, deſtroyed 100,000 men. Of
inundations there are many other examples, as
that which happened in England in the year
1604, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Impetuous winds may be regarded as a third
cauſe of changes on the ſurface of the globe.
They not only give riſe to downs and hills along
the ſea-coaſts, but they often arreſt rivers, make
them regorge, and change their directions. They
carry off cultivated lands, tear up trees, overturn
houſes, and cover whole countries with ſand.
Upon the coaſt of Britany, in France, we have
an example of thoſe inundations of ſand: The
hiſtory of the Academy, ann. 1722, deſcribes it
in the following terms:</p>
               <p>'In the environs of St Paul de Leon, in
Lower Britany, there is a province on the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt,
which, before the year 1666, was inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited;
but is now totally deſerted, on account
of the ſand, which has covered it to the depth
of 20 feet, and which daily gains ground.
Reckoning from the above period, the ſand
has advanced about 6 leagues into the country;
and it is now within half a league of St Paul,
and that town muſt probably ſoon be deſerted,
The tops of ſteeples, and of ſome chimnies,
ſtill appear above this ocean of ſand. The
inhabitants, however, have always had leiſure
to quit their poſſeſſions in ſafety; p. 7.'</p>
               <p>'This calamity is augmented by an eaſt, or a
north wind, which elevate this fine ſand, and
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:0195400701:544"/>
carry it in ſuch quantities, and with ſuch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,
that M. Deſlandes, to whom the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy
are indebted for the obſervation, when
walking in this country during an eaſt wind,
found himſelf obliged to ſhake his hat and his
garments from time to time, on account of the
great weight of ſand with which they were
loaded. Beſides, when the wind is violent, it
carries the ſand over a ſmall arm of the ſea as
far as Roſcof, a port much frequented by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
veſſels; and the ſand accumulates in the
ſtreets of this villages to the height of two feet,
which obliges the inhabitants to drive it off in
waggons. It may be further remarked, that
the ſand is mixed with ferruginous particles,
which are recogniſable by the magnet.'</p>
               <p>'The coaſt which furniſhes this ſand extends
from St Paul to Plouefcat, a ſpace of more than
four leagues; and it is nearly on a level with
the ſea when the tide is full. It is ſituated in
ſuch a manner that only the eaſt and north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt
winds can blow the ſand in upon the
country. It is eaſy to conceive how ſand car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
and accumulated into any place by the
wind, may again be taken up by the ſame
wind, and carried ſtill farther. Thus the ſand
may continue advancing, and covering new
lands, as long as the magazine from which it
originally proceeds ſhall remain unexhauſted;
for, if the fountain were once dried up, the
ſand, by advancing, would diminiſh in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:0195400701:545"/>
and its deſtructive conſequences would gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
decay. But it is not improbable that the
ſea may long continue to ſupply freſh ſand,
and keep this baneful magazine in a condition
to do perpetual miſchief.'</p>
               <p>'This diſaſter is not of an old date. Perhaps
it was not till lately that the place was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
ſtored to allow great quantities of ſand
to be carried off; or, perhaps, it has but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
been left uncovered by the waters.
This coaſt has undergone ſome change. At
preſent, the ſea, at full tide, reaches half a
league on this ſide of certain rocks, which it
formerly never paſſed.'</p>
               <p>'This miſerable province juſtifies what has
been related, both by antient and by modern
travellers, that whole cities, and even vaſt
armies, have been buried by tempeſts of ſand
in the deſarts of Arabia.'</p>
               <p>Mr Shaw relates, that the ports of Laodicea,
Tortoſa, Rowadſa, Tripoly, Tyre, Acra, and
Jaffa, are blocked up with ſand tranſported by
the high waves which riſe on that part of the
coaſt, when the weſt winds blow with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence<note n="*" place="bottom">See Shaw's travels.</note>.</p>
               <p>It is needleſs to give more examples of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
on the ſurface of this globe. The fire,
the air, and the waters, produce continual
changes, which, in a ſucceſſion of ages, become
conſiderable. The ſea and the land not only
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:0195400701:546"/>
change places from the effects of general and
ſtated periodic laws, but a number of revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are brought about by particular and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
cauſes, as earthquakes, inundations, ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of mountains, &amp;c. Thus the ſurface of the
earth, which we regard as the moſt permanent
of all things, is ſubjected, like the reſt of nature,
to perpetual viciſſitudes.</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>FROM the proofs delivered in Art. VII.
and VIII. it appears to be an eſtabliſhed
fact, that the whole ſurface of what is now dry
land, was formerly buried under the waters of
the ocean. It is equally clear, from Art. XII.
that the flux and reflux, and other movements
of the ocean, perpetually detach from the coaſts
and from the bottom of the ſea, ſhells, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of every ſpecies; and that theſe are depoſited
in other places in the form of ſediments, and
give riſe to the horizontal ſtrata which every
where appear. In the IX. art. we have proved,
that the inequalities on the ſurface of the globe
have been occaſioned by the motion of the waters
of the ſea; and that the mountains received their
original formation from ſucceſſive accumulations
of the ſediments above deſcribed. It is likewiſe
evident, from Art. XIII. that the currents which
firſt followed the direction of theſe inequalities,
afterwards beſtowed on them their preſent fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
that is, their alternate and correſponding
angles. From Art. VIII. and XVIII. it appears,
that moſt of the matters detached from the coaſts
and from the bottom of the ſea were, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited
in ſediments, in the form of a fine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palpable
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:0195400701:548"/>
powder, which entirely filled the cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of ſhells, whether this powder was of the
ſame nature, or only analogous to the matter of
which the ſhells were compoſed. It is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable,
from Art. XVII. that the horizontal ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
which have been formed by ſucceſſive accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations
of ſediments, and which at firſt were
ſoft and ductile, acquired denſity and compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in proportion as they dried; and that the
perpendicular fiſſures in the ſtrata derived their
origin from the act of drying.</p>
               <p>After peruſing Art. X. XI. XIV. XV. XVI.
XVII. XVIII. and XIX. we muſt be convinced,
that the ſurface of the earth has been disfigured
by many revolutions and particular viciſſitudes,
ariſing from the operation of the waters, and the
effects of rains, froſt, rivers, winds, ſubterraneous
fires, earthquakes, inundations, &amp;c. and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that the ſea has alternately changed
places with the dry land, eſpecially in the firſt
ages after the creation, when terreſtrial ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were much ſofter than they are at preſent.
It muſt, however, be acknowledged, that our
judgment concerning the ſucceſſion of natural
revolutions cannot fail to be very imperfect; that
we are ſtill leſs competent judges of thoſe changes
which owe their birth to fortuitous events; and,
that the defect of hiſtoric records deprives us of
the knowledge of particular facts. We deſiderate
both time and experience. We never conſider,
that, though our exiſtence here be extremely li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:0195400701:549"/>
nature proceeds in her courſe. We are
ambitious of condenſing into our momentary
duration both the paſt and the future, without
reflecting that human life is only a point of time,
a ſingle fact in the hiſtory of the operations of
the Almighty.</p>
