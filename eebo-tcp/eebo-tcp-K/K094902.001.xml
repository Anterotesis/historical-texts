            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>The principal building, and from which it has its name, is the great white ſquare Tower in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. 'Tis a regular, ſtrong, lofty ſtructure, and the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt within the walls, being built by William the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, in the year 1078.</p>

                  <p>The entrances into the Tower are over two brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, one at the weſt end for carts, coaches, foot-paſſengers,

                  <p>The Tiger is of a very

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0845700101:71"/>with ſheeps heads and plucks twice a day; of which a Lion eats four or five in a day: but Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards, Panthers, and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, are much fonder of raw dogs-fleſh. They are always ſeparated when they eat, or they would quarrel. The wild Lions of Africa are ſaid to prey chiefly upon wild Boars: which ſometimes prove ſo hard to conquer, that both
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0845700101:72"/>have been found dead to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in their gore. They drink as often as they drink as often as they pleaſe, uſually ſeveral times in a day; each having a ſtone trought in his den.</p>
                  <p>The Lion being an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal of a hot and thirſty nature, was by the antients repreſented as an emblem, or ſymbol of ſultry wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The Tower has been a place for keeping of wild
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0845700101:73"/>beaſts in above five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years.</p>
                  <p>On Sunday the 5th of Auguſt, 1604. a Lioneſs, named <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> brought forth a young Lion in the Tower, which young one died the next day. This was the firſt Lion whelp'd in that place, and probably in England.</p>
                  <p>The 26th of February following, the ſame Lion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs brought forth another
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0845700101:74"/>young Lion; which by command of King James, was taken from the dam as ſoon as whelp'd, and nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by hand: but this alſo died in about ſixteen days.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt age any Lions have been known to live in the Tower, is about twenty years.</p>
                  <p>The Lion, in the day times, ſeems to be a very ſluggiſh, heavy animal, that hates to be rous'd, and is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0845700101:75"/>no ſooner up, but, if ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, will immediately ſlap down again: Perhaps, in the night they may be otherwiſe; it being more natural to them to ſeek their prey in. The holy Pſalmiſt hath the like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: <hi>Thou makeſt darnkneſs, and it is night: wherein all the beaſts of the foreſt do creep forth. The young Lions roar after their prey, and ſeek their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0845700101:76"/>meat from God. The ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> Pſal. civ.</p>
                  <p>The Lioneſs goes with young exactly four months: None were ever known to have more than three at a litter. They are whelp'd with their eyes open, and are taken from the dam immediately, or they would periſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0845700101:77"/>They are very tender, and require a great deal of care in nurſing; it being exceedingly difficult to bring up a young Lion (and ſo it is Tigers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) They often die in breeding their teeth, ſometimes in ſtrong convulſions. The ſame is obſerv'd by the people of Barbary, to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the young wild Lions of that country, or they would be much more
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0845700101:78"/>numerous than they are in thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>Young Lions are kept about twelve months in a warm room, before they are put into dens; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to that age are chain'd, and are always ſeparated when they eat their victuals. Their ſavage nature comes on gradually as they grow up, and they are three years a coming to their full growth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0845700101:79"/>It has been the common opinion, that the Lion is afraid of fire: their keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers deny that they are ſo. One of them, who now attends the wild beaſts in the Tower, going one night in the laſt hard win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the den of the old Lion, with a lighted can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, held his hand near the bars, to ſee if the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was come down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lower apartment;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0845700101:80"/>when ſuddenly he put out his paw, and wounded the man ſo dangerouſly in the back of his hand, that he very narrowly eſcap'd loſing it: And this he brings as an inſtance to ſhew that they are not afraid of fire.</p>
                  <p>The Lion often ſleeps and ſnores with his eyes open, and likewiſe with them ſhut.</p>
                  <p>King James the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0845700101:81"/>minded to make trial of the nature and courage of the Lion, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wild beaſts, went to the Tower, attended by ſeveral of the nobility; where he ordered a Lion and Lioneſs to be turned out of their dens, and a Cock to be caſt to them; which they preſently kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſuck'd its blood.</p>
                  <p>Next a Lamb was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be put to them,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0845700101:82"/>which the Lions, out of their generoſity, never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to touch, although it went cloſe up to them.</p>
                  <p>Then two Maſtiffs were let looſe upon a ſingle Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they preſently ſeized, and turn'd upon his back: and tho' the Lion was ſuperior to them in ſtrength, yet they were his match in courage.</p>
                  <p>Some time after, a Lion was turned out of his den
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0845700101:83"/>to a Bear, which had kill'd a child; but the Lion would not attack the Bear.</p>
                  <p>They try'd ſeveral other ſingle Lions, and at length two together; but all fled from him, and wanted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to get into their dens.</p>
                  <p>A Stone-horſe was put into the yard with the firſt Lion and the Bear; the Horſe, after a little while, fell to grazing between them, which they never
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0845700101:84"/>offer'd to touch. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſix Dogs were let in, who flew upon the Horſe, moſt in ſight at their firſt entrance; and would ſoon have worried him to death, had not three ſtout fellows enter'd in, who reſcu'd the Horſe, and brought away the Dogs; while the Lion and Bear ſtood ſtaring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. At this ſight were preſent King James
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0845700101:85"/>the firſt, the Queen, Prince, and divers of the nobility.</p>
                  <p>And though the Bear which kill'd the child eſcap'd at this time; he was afterwards, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the King, baited to death with Dogs, upon a ſtage.</p>
                  <p>There was a Spaniel Dog, for ſome offence, caſt into the Lion's den; but the Lion did not attempt to hurt him: and this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0845700101:86"/>Dog continued in the den with the Lion ſeveral years, and there died.</p>

                  <p>IT may not be improper to inform my young readers, that in the year 1588, Philip II. King of Spain, having prepared a powerful navy, which conſiſted of One hundred and thirty ſhips, with
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0845700101:95"/>which he deſign'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade and conquer Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; thought himſelf ſo ſure of victory, that his fleet was chriſten'd by the Pope, <hi>The Invincible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada;</hi> which ſignifies, a ſtrength that could not be overcome.</p>
                  <p>The great Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth hearing of this vaſt armament, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſmay'd, like a valiant Princeſs, order'd a ſtrong

                  <p>YOU are firſt ſhewn a number of <hi>pikes,</hi> each ſix yards long, with velvet holdings about their mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; the ſteel points were gilt with gold, upon ſome
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0845700101:101"/>of which the gilding is ſtill viſible. The Spaniſh Dons were ſo ſure of conqueſt, that they ſpared no coſt in equipping themſelves; becauſe they intended the Engliſh ſhould pay for all.</p>
                  <p>Over head hangs a large number of Spaniſh <hi>piſtols</hi> and <hi>targets,</hi> which were the only fire-arems they had then in uſe; and which were diſcharg'd with a match: One of theſe lies
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0845700101:102"/>in a window below, for the curious to examine.</p>
                  <p>Next you ſee a parcel of Spaniſh <hi>launces,</hi> of a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſize, with which thoſe polite people deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after they had conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Engliſh, to have bled them with, to prevent their falling into fevers. Queen Elizabeth, being always tender of her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, thought thoſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would make too
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0845700101:103"/>large an orifice, therefore order'd them to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd of ſuch dangerous tools; which was quickly perform'd by her gallant captains.</p>
                  <p>Near to the laſt, are a great many frightful wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, reſembling bill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks, but a great deal larger.</p>

The people whoſe cuſtody they are now in, call them the <hi>womens weapons;</hi> becauſe, they ſay, in thoſe times, above eight hundred years ago, the women conſpired againſt the Danes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd thirty thouſand, by cutting their throats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0845700101:106"/>for which reaſon, they tell you, the women have ever ſince had the wall of the man, the upper end of the table, and the firſt cut.</p>
                  <p>Next, a cruel inſtrument called a <hi>Spaniſh cravat;</hi> with which thoſe people deſign'd to torture the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh. In this their necks, hands and feet were to be confin'd, in ſuch a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manner, that the poor ſufferers muſt have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0845700101:107"/>the moſt exquiſite tortures; till either they were ſtarv'd to death, or expir'd thro' pain of their great torment.</p>
                  <p>Near to the laſt ſtands a <hi>ſhield,</hi> made of the skin of a Rhinoceros; which was a preſent from the great Mogul to King Henry the ſeventh.</p>
