            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>CRITICS, hark forward! noble game and new;</l>
            <l>A fine Weſt Indian ſtarted full in view:</l>
            <l>Hot as the ſoil, the clime, which gave him birth,</l>
            <l>You'll run him on a burning ſcent to earth;</l>
            <l>Yet don't devour him in his hiding place,</l>
            <l>Bag him, he'll ſerve you for another chace;</l>
            <l>For ſure that country has no feeble claim,</l>
            <l>Which ſwells your commerce, and ſupports your fame.</l>
            <l>And in this humble ſketch, we hope you'll find,</l>
            <l>Some emanations of a noble mind;</l>
            <l>Some little touches, which, tho' void of art,</l>
            <l>May find perhaps their way into the heart.</l>
            <l>Another hero your excuſe implores,</l>
            <l>Sent by your ſiſter kingdom to your ſhores;</l>
            <l>Doom'd by Religion's too ſevere command,</l>
            <l>To fight for bread againſt his native land:</l>
            <l>A brave, unthinking, animated rogue,</l>
            <l>With here and there a touch upon the brogue;</l>
            <l>Laugh, but deſpiſe him not, for on his lip</l>
            <l>His errors lie; his heart can never trip.</l>
            <l>Others there are——but may we not prevail</l>
            <l>To let the gentry tell their own plain tale?</l>
            <l>Shall they come in? They'll pleaſe you, if they can;</l>
            <l>If not, condemn the bard——but ſpare the <hi>Man.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For ſpeak, think, act, or write in angry times,</l>
            <l>A wiſh to pleaſe is made the worſt of crimes;</l>
            <l>Dire ſlander now with black envenom'd dart,</l>

            <l>Nor were our fathers half ſo ſtrict as you,</l>
            <l>Damn'd not each error of the poets pen,</l>

                  <p>HE ſeems diſordered: ſome thing in that letter; and I'm afraid of an unpleaſant ſort.

                  <speaker>STOCKWELL.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Sir, my only ſon; early in life I accompanied his grandfather to Jamaica as his clerk; he had an only daughter, ſomewhat older than myſelf; the mother of this gentleman; it was my chance (call it good or ill) to engage her affections: and, as the inferiority of my condition made it hopeleſs to expect her father's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; her fondneſs provided an expedient, and we were privately married; the iſſue of that concealed engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, as I have told you, this Belcour.</p>

                  <speaker>STOCKWELL.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſhall hear. Not many days after our marriage old Belcour ſet out for England; and, during his abode here, my wife was, with great ſecreſy, delivered of this ſon. Fruitful in expedients to diſguiſe her ſituation, without parting from her infant, ſhe contrived to have it laid and received at her door as a foundling. After ſome time her father returned, having left me here; in one of thoſe favourable moments, that decide the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of proſperous men, this child was introduced; from that inſtant, he treated him as his own, gave him his name, and brought him up in his family.</p>

                  <p>And did you never reveal this ſecret, either to old Belcour, or your ſon?</p>

                  <speaker>STUCKELY.</speaker>
                  <p>Therein you ſurpriſe me; a merchant of your emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and a member of the Britiſh parliament, might ſurely aſpire without offence to the daughter of a planter. In this caſe too, natural affection would prompt to a diſcovery.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STOCKWELL.</speaker>
                  <p>Your remark is obvious; nor could I have perſiſted in this painful ſilence, but in obedience to the dying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of a beloved wife. The letter, you found me reading, conveyed thoſe injunctions to me; it was dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in her laſt illneſs, and almoſt in the article of death; (you'll ſpare me the recital of it) ſhe there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures me, in terms as ſolemn, as they are affecting, never to reveal the ſecret of our marriage, or withdraw my ſon, while her father ſurviv'd.</p>

                  <p>Principally, I believe, from apprehenſion on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, leſt old Belcour, on whom at her deceaſe I wholly depended, ſhould withdraw his protection: in part from conſideration of his repoſe, as well knowing the diſcovery would deeply affect his ſpirit, which was haughty, vehement, and unforgiving: and laſtly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the intereſt of her infant, whom he had warmly adopted; and for whom, in caſe of a diſcovery, every thing was to be dreaded from his reſentment. And, indeed, though the alteration in my condition might. have juſtified me in diſcovering myſelf, yet I always thought my ſon ſafer in truſting to the caprice than to the juſtice of his grand-father. My judgment has not ſuffered by the event; old Belcour is dead, and has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed his whole eſtate to him we are ſpeaking of.</p>

                  <p>I ſay charity, indeed! And pray, Miſs, are you ſure that it is charity, pure charity, which moves you to plead for Captain Dudley? Amongſt all your pity, do you find no ſpice of a certain anti-ſpiritual paſſion, called love? Don't miſtake yourſelf, you are no ſaint, child, believe me; and, I am apt to think, the diſtreſſes of old Dudley, and of his daughter into the bargain, would never break your heart, if there was not a certain young fellow of two and twenty in the caſe; who, by the happy recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of a good perſon, and the brilliant appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an enſigncy, will, if I am not miſtaken, cozen you out of a fortune of twice twenty thouſand pounds, as ſoon as ever you are of age to beſtow it upon him.</p>

I thank Heaven, Miſs Ruſport, I am no ways reſponſible for your conduct; nor is it any concern of mine how you diſpoſe of yourſelf; you are not my daughter; and, when I married your father, poor Sir Stephen Ruſport, I found you a forward ſpoiled Miſs of fourteen far above being inſtructed by me.</p>

                  <p>You're ſtrangely pert; but 'tis no wonder: your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I'm told, was a fine lady; and according to the modern ſtile of education you was brought up. It was not ſo in my young days; there was then ſome decorum in the world, ſome ſubordination, as the great Locke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it. Oh! 'twas an edifying ſight, to ſee the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular deportment obſerved in our family: no gigling, no goſſiping was going on there; my good father, Sir Oliver Roundhead, never was ſeen to laugh himſelf, nor ever allowed it in his children.</p>

                  <p>The major, child, has travelled through various king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and climates, and has more enlarged notions of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male merit than falls to the lot of an Engliſh home-bred lover; in moſt other countries, no woman on your ſide forty would ever be named in a polite circle.</p>

                  <p>Right, Madam; I've been told that in Vienna they have coquets upon crutches and Venuſes in their grand climateric; a lover there celebrates the wrinkles, not the dimples, in his miſtreſs's face. The Major, I think, has ſerved in the imperial army.</p>

You found me in a pretty ſnug retir'd way of life at Bologne, out of the noiſe and buſtle of the world, and wholly at my eaſe; you, indeed, was upon the wing, with a fiery perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at your back: but, like a true ſon of <hi>Loyola,</hi> you had then a thouſand ingenious devices to repair your fortune; and this your native country was to be the ſcene of your performances: fool that I was, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled into it by you; but thank Heaven, our partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is revocable: I am not your wedded wife, praiſed be my ſtars! for what have we got, whom have we gull'd but ourſelves; which of all your trains has taken fire; even this poor expedient of your bookſeller's ſhop ſeems abandoned, for if a chance cuſtomer drops in, who is there, pray, to help him to what he wants?</p>

                  <p>Patty, you know it is not upon ſlight grounds that I deſpair; there had us'd to be a livelihood to be pickt up in this country, both for the honeſt and diſhoneſt; I have tried each walk, and am likely to ſtarve at laſt: there is not a point to which the wit and faculty of man can turn, that I have not ſet mine to; but in vain, I am beat through every quarter of the compaſs.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0057602200:21"/>
a maſter-ſtroke, truly; why, I have talk'd treaſon, writ treaſon, and if a man can't live by that he can live by nothing Here I ſet up as a bookſeller; why men left off reading; and if I was to turn butcher, I believe o' my conſcience they'd leave off eating.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Fulmer, I have borrow'd a book from your ſhop; 'tis the ſixth volume of my deceaſed friend Triſtram: he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0057602200:22"/>
is a flattering writer to us poor ſoldiers; and the divine ſtory of Le Fevre, which makes part of this book, in my opinion of it, does honour not to its author only, but to human nature.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>FULMER.</speaker>
                  <p>He is an author I keep in the way of trade, but one I never reliſh'd; he is much too looſe and profligate for my taſte.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>DUDLEY.</speaker>
                  <p>That's being too ſevere: I hold him to be a moraliſt in the nobleſt ſenſe; he plays indeed with the fancy, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perhaps too wantonly; but while he thus deſignedly maſks his main attack, he comes at once upon the heart; refines, amends it, ſoftens it; beats down each ſelfiſh barrier from about it, and opens every ſluice of pity and benevolence.</p>

                  <p>We of the catholic perſuaſion are not much bound to him.—Well, Sir, I ſhall not oppoſe your opinion; a fevourite author is like a favourite miſtreſs; and there you know, Captain, no man likes to have his taſte arraigned.</p>

In the name of all the devils at once, why did ſhe run away? If every handſome girl I meet in this town is to lead me ſuch a wild gooſe chace, I had better have ſtaid in the torrid zone: I ſhall be waſted to the ſize of a ſugar cane: what ſhall I do? Give the chace up: hang it, that's cowardly: ſhall I, a true-born ſon of Phoebus, ſuffer this little nimble-footed Daphne to eſcape me—"Forbid it honour, and forbid it love." Huſh! huſh! here ſhe comes! Oh! the devil! What tawdry thing have we got here?</p>

                  <p>Faith and troth, Maſter Dudley, you may ſay that; 'tis thirty years, come the time, that I have followed the trade, and in a pretty many countries—Let me ſee—In the war before laſt I ſerv'd in the Iriſh Brigade, d'ye ſee; there after bringing off the French monarch, I left his ſervice, with a Britiſh bullet in my body, and this ribband in my button-hole. Laſt war I followed the fortunes of the German eagle, in the corps of grenadiers; there I had my belly-full of fighting, and a plentiful ſcarcity of every thing elſe. After ſix and twenty engagements, great and ſmall, I went off with this gaſh on my ſcull, and a kiſs of the empreſs queen's ſweet hand, (Heaven bleſs it) for my pains: ſince the peace, my dear, I took a little turn with the Confederates there in Poland—but ſuch another ſet of madcaps!—by the Lord Harry, I never knew what it was they were ſcuffling about.</p>

                  <p>Now the deuce take the girl for putting that notion into my head; I'm ſadly afraid Dudley does hot like me; ſo much encouragement as I have given him to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! I never cou'd get a word from him on the ſubject; this may be very honourable, but upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my life it's very provoking; by the way I wonder how I look to-day. Oh! ſhockingly, hideouſly pale! like a witch. This is the old lady's glaſs, and ſhe has left ſome of her wrinkles on it. How frightfully have I put on my cap, all awry! and my hair dreſt ſo unbecomingly! altogether I'm a moſt compleat fright.</p>

                  <p>Quarrelling with your glaſs, couſin? Make it up; make it up and be friends; it cannot compliment you more, than by reflecting you, as you are.</p>

                  <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, I vow, my dear Charles, that is delightfully ſaid, and deſerves my very beſt curteſy: your flattery, like a rich jewel, has a value not only from its ſuperior luſtre, but from its extraordinary ſcarceneſs: I verily think this is the only civil ſpeech you ever directed to my perſon in your life.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>And I ought to aſk pardon of your good ſenſe, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done it now.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, now you relapſe again: don't you know if you keep well with a woman on the great ſcore of beaury, ſhe'll never quarrel with you on the trifling article of good ſenſe? But any thing ſerves to fill up a dull yawning hour with an inſipid couſin; you have brighter moments, and warmer ſpirits for the dear girl of your heart.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>You bluſh, and the reaſon is apparent, you are a novice at hypocriſy; but no practice can make a viſit of ceremony paſs for a viſit of choice: love is ever before its time, friendſhip is apt to lag a little after it: pray, Charles, did you make any extraordinary haſte hither?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>By your queſtion, I ſee you acquit me of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence of being in love.</p>

                  <p>But why impertinence? why the impertinence of being in love? you have one language for me, Charles, and another for the woman of your affection.</p>

                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>You are miſtaken; the woman of my affection ſhall never hear any other language from me, than what I uſe to you.</p>

                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>It is not fit I ſhou'd; there is no need of love to make me miſerable; 'tis wretchedneſs enough to be a beggar.</p>

                  <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                  <p>A beggar do you call yourſelf! O Charles, Charles, rich in every merit and accompliſhment, whom may you not aſpire to? and why think you ſo unworthily of our ſex, as to conclude there is not one to be found with ſenſe to diſcern your virtue and generoſity to reward it?</p>

                  <p>Ay, wherefore do I not? ſince you never allowed me a place in yours: but go, Sir, I have no right to ſtay you; go where your heart directs you, go to the happy, the diſtinguiſhed fair one.</p>

                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>

                  <p>O, Charles, give me your hand; if I have offended you, I aſk you pardon; you have been long acquainted with my temper, and know how to bear with its infirmities.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>Thus, my dear Charlotte, let us ſeal our reconciliation <stage>kiſſing her hand.</stage> Bear with thy infirmities! By Heaven, I know not any one failing in thy whole compoſition, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of too great a partiality for an undeſerving man.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                  <p>And you are now taking the very courſe to augment that failing. A thought ſtrikes me: I have a commiſſion that you muſt abſolutely execute for me: I have immediate oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for the ſum of two hundred pounds; you know my fortune is ſhut up till I am of age: take this paltry box; it contains my ear-rings, and ſome other bawbles I have no uſe for; carry it to our oppoſite neighbour, Mr. Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well; I don't know where elſe to apply; leave it as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit in his hands, and beg him to accomodate me with the ſum.</p>

                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>Dear Charlotte, what are you about to do? How can you poſſibly want two hundred pounds?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                  <p>How can I poſſibly do without it, you mean? Doesn't every lady want two hundred pounds? Perhaps I have loſt it at play; perhaps I mean to win as much to it; perhaps I want it for two hundred different uſes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>Pooh! pooh! all this is nothing; don't I know you never play?</p>

                  <p>You miſtake; I have a ſpirit to ſet not only this trifle, but my whole fortune upon a ſtake; therefore make no wry faces, but do as I bid you: you will find Mr. Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well a very honourable gentleman.</p>

                  <p>Why, ſure, Mr. Fulmer, I may be allowed to rear a chicken of my own hatching, as they ſay. Who firſt ſprung the thought but I, pray? Who contrived the plot? Who propoſed the letter, but I, I?</p>

                  <p>Your abſolute inexperience: have you lived ſo very little time in this country, as not to know that between young people of equal ages, the term of ſiſter often is a cover for that of miſtreſs?

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>BELCOUR.</speaker>
                  <p>That's true; ſhe cannot be a woman of honour, and Dudley is an unconſcionable young rogue to think of keeping one fine girl in pay, by raiſing contributions on another; he ſhall therefore give her up; ſhe is a dear, bewitching, miſchievous, little devil; and he ſhall poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively give her up.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>MRS. FULMER.</speaker>

                  <speaker>MRS. FULMER.</speaker>
                  <p>Out-bid him, never dream of out-bluſtring him; buy out his leaſe of poſſeſſion, and leave her to manage his ejectment.</p>

                  <p>An order! No; order for me no orders upon merchants, with their value received, and three day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> grace; their noting, proteſting, and endorſing, and all their counting-houſe formalities; I'll have nothing to do with them; leave your diamonds with me, and give your order for the value of them to the owner: the money would be as good as the trinkets, I warrant you.</p>

                  <p>Miſs Ruſport, I cannot invent a lie for my life; and, if it was to ſave it, I coudn't tell one: I am an idle, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated, unthinking fellow, not worth your notice: in ſhort, I am a Weſt-Indian; and you muſt try me accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0057602200:61"/>
to the charter of my colony, not by a jury of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſpinſters: truth is, I've given away your jewels; caught with a pair of ſparkling eyes, whoſe luſtre blinded their's, I ſerved your property, as I ſhou'd my own, and laviſh'd it away; let me not totally deſpair of your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs: I frequently do wrong, but never with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; if your diſpleaſure is added to my own, my puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be too ſevere. When I parted from the jewels, I had not the honour of knowing their owner.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Belcour, your ſincerity charms me, I enter at once into your character, and I make all the allowances for it you can deſire. I take your jewels for the preſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know there is no other way of reconciling you to yourſelf; but If I give way to your ſpirit in one point, you muſt yield to mine in another; remember I will not keep more than the value of my own jewels: there is no need to be pillaged by more than one woman at a time, Sir.</p>

                  <p>I inſiſt upon referring our diſpute to him: your ſiſter and I, Charles, have a quarrel; Belcour, the hero of your letter, has juſt left us—ſome how or other, Louiſa's bright eyes have caught him; and the poor fellow's fallen deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in love with her—(don't interrupt me, huſſey)— Well, that's excuſable enough, you'll ſay; but the jet of the ſtory is, that this hair-brain'd ſpark, who does nothing like other people, has given her the very identical jewels, which you pledged for me to Mr. Stockwell; and will you believe that this little demure ſlut made up a face, and ſqueezed out three or four hypocritical tears, becauſe I ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied her about it?</p>

                  <p>He has, but altogether in a ſtile ſo whimſical and capricious, that the beſt which can be ſaid of them is to tell you that they ſeem'd more the reſult of good ſpirits than good manners.</p>

                  <p>Ay, ay, now the murder's out; he's in love with her, and ſhe has no very great diſlike to him; truſt to my obſervation, Charles, for that: as to the diamonds, there's ſome miſtake about them, and you muſt clear it up: three minutes converſation with him will put every thing in a right train; go, go, Charles, 'tis a brother's buſineſs; about it inſtantly; ten to one you'll find him over the way at Mr. Stockwell's.</p>

And now, my dear lad, ſince peace is concluded on all ſides, I have a diſcovery to make to you, which you muſt find out for yourſelf, for deuce take me if I rightly comprehend it, only that your aunt Ruſport is in a conſpiracy againſt you, and a vile rogue of a lawyer, whoſe name I forget, at the bottom of it.</p>
