            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Inſcrib'd to the Learned Dr.</hi> Garth, <hi>F. R. S. by</hi> W. Cockburn, M. D.</head>
            <p>BY my Solution of the Problem for determining the due Doſes of Purging and Vomiting Medicines,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil. Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act. No.</hi> 303.</note> in all their Caſes, it is manifeſt in general,
<note place="margin">Poſtul.</note> that theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines operate either upon the account of their being mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Blood,
<note place="margin">Schol.</note> or by their ſtimulating the Stomach and Guts: 2. That this their Operation is more or leſs according to the Quantity and Thickneſs of Blood, <hi>h.e.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> a greater Quantity, and the thickeſt Blood require the greateſt Doſes: And 3,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1.</note> that when the Quantities of Blood are the ſame, the Doſes of Purging and Vomiting Medicines are in a duplicate proportion of the Bloods thickneſs. As alſo, that in every caſe theſe Doſes muſt be in a proportion compounded of the Quantity of Blood and thoſe Squares of its thickneſs.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſince the Operations of Purgative and Vomitive Medicines depend ſo much on the Quantity and Viſcidity of the Blood,
<note place="margin">Why the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of theſe Medicines ſo hard to be found.</note> which have not been duely conſider'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; it is no wonder that the Practice of Phyſick in theſe Evacuations has been ſo uncertain, and that the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Phyſicians, from their moſt accurate Obſervations, could never determine the true Doſes of Medicines, which alter ſo much according to the various Subjects they work upon; they not being acquainted with the true Method of determining either the quantity of the Blood, or the degrees of its thickneſs.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0007000300:3"/>
            <p>Becauſe Experience is equally the Foundation and Touchſtone of all reaſoning in Phyſick, we will here ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our Solution to common Obſervations, and try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther every thing propoſed in it, does not exactly anſwer Matters of Fact, and the viſible Operations of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Firſt then,
<note place="margin">The different effects of theſe Medicines upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> it plainly follows, that theſe Medicines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways purge beſt and moſt conſtantly in a liquid form; becauſe they are more eaſily convey'd into the Blood, and can ſtimulate more parts, and that upon the account of this their Fluidity; whatever may be the way that Purges and Vomits work, or whatſoever their Nature may be. This explains very eaſily a very common Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, hitherto very difficult to Phyſicians, about the different Operation of the ſame Medicine in different forms: Why, <hi>viz.</hi> the Infuſion of a due quantity of a Purging Medicine produces its effects ſooner and more conſtantly than a like quantity of the ſame Medicine in a Powder, tho' ſtill more conſtantly in a Powder than a Bolus, tho' ſtill ſooner and more conſtantly in a dry Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, than if it be given in Pills made into that form with Gums that do not purge; and this difference in Purging ſhall even be notable, according to the diſſolubility of the Gums.</p>
            <p>From whence it follows, that the Evacuation made by ſuch Medicines, is in proportion to the quantity of thoſe Medicines that happens to be diſſolv'd, and not to the quantity adminiſter'd.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Their effects different, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the different thickneſs of Blood.</note> That purging by Draughts is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent form, and will always have the moſt conſtant effect.</p>
            <p>The next Conſideration is, that a certain quantity of any purging Medicine affects us after a different manner, according to the different Quantity and Conſtitution of the Blood, or its thickneſs, and it was ſhewn in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that if its thickneſs were the ſame, the Doſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0007000300:4"/>ſhould always be as its Quantity, but the Blood differing likewiſe in thickneſs, the Doſes of Purging and Vomiting Medicines muſt be augmented on account of its thickneſs. This is perfectly well confirm'd by daily experience; where we find, that People ſick with a manifeſt thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Blood, as in Dropſies, the Jaundice, &amp;c. take far greater Doſes than they did at any other time when they were not ſick, or in that manner.</p>
            <p>By a further Diſquiſition into this matter, we find that the Doſes muſt not only be greater where the thickneſs of Blood is greater; but that they muſt be encreas'd in a duplicate proportion of their Viſcidity. This is evident by the Tables in <hi>Caſſia. viz.</hi> 9:83::4:3<g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>, 1 ℈, 13⅓ <hi>gr.</hi> and therefore <hi>alternando</hi> 9:4::8 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>:3 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>, 1 ℈, 13 ⅓ <hi>gr.</hi> Therefore the Doſes are as the Squares of the Conſtitutions. So likewiſe 9:8 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>::16:14 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>, 13 ⅓ <hi>gr.</hi> and <hi>alternando</hi> 9:16::8 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>:14 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>, 13 ⅓ <hi>gr. h. e.</hi> the Doſes are as the Squares of the Conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>The ſame is true in any other Conſtitution beſides the mean: For Example, in the loweſt and higheſt 4:16:: 213 ⅓ <hi>gr:</hi> 853 ⅓. So that by this means we are not only led directly to a right uſe of theſe Medicines, and are able to find the true cauſe why the ordinary Doſes produce ſo very different effects in different Conſtitutions; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<note place="margin">A Problem.</note> 
               <hi>The Quantity of Blood in any Perſon being given together with the ordinary and extraordinary effect of a Doſe of a Purging Medicine, the Change of that Perſons Conſtitution, and the Nature of that Change may be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot but be a great ſatisfaction to the mind to find a Doctrine founded on a few ſimple Experiences leading us into the cauſe of many more that are very complext,
<note place="margin">This Doctrine true becauſe conform to Nature.</note> difficult, and obſcure; which is ſufficient to prove its conformity to Nature. But my preſent endeavour being to rectify the common Practice of theſe Medicines by this Doctrine, I ſhall frame, by this Method, Tables of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0007000300:5"/>Purging and Vomiting Medicines in preſent uſe; better adapted to Experience than are hitherto to be found.</p>
            <p>The Method of framing ſuch Tables,
<note place="margin">How they are made.</note> is by ſetting off the practicable Conſtitutions in the different Ages that I have obſerv'd to take notable Quantities of Purging and Vomiting Medicines; ſo that by comparing theſe Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions with the Ages, we have the different Doſes in all thoſe caſes, which is all that is requir'd for a better pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; tho' a more proper occaſion may produce a more nice and exact diviſion of Conſtitutions, very much to the advantage of the Practice of Phyſick in all Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>The Ages wherein theſe different Doſes are taken, I find to be four; when a Man is about 16 or 20 Years of Age, and weighs about 12 Stone, he then takes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Doſe: One of nine Years takes three quarters of that; one of ſix the half, and one of three Years a quarter. Moreover,

That of the moſt fluid Blood as the firſt number, and ſo on; in that caſe, the Doſe of any Perſon will be found by multiplying the common Doſe for his Age into the Square of his Conſtitution and dividing by the Square of the middle Conſtitution. For inſtance, If ℥j. <hi>Caſſioe</hi> is the common Doſe, or the Doſe of the middle Conſtitution, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij. ℈j. and <hi>gr.</hi> 13 ⅓ is the Doſe of the firſt Conſtitution, and <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>xiv. <hi>gr.</hi> 13 ⅓ that of the groſſeſt or laſt Conſtitution; and ſo proportionably for every Medicine in all the Ages, as appears by the Tables.</p>
            <p>This Method ſeems to anſwer ſo exactly,
<note place="margin">Only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that there is not any thing neceſſary beſides, except a Perſon is more Looſe or Coſtive than ordinary (which may be known from the Patient or otherways) it is to be reputed the ſame, as if he had taken an equivalent quantity of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine proper to produce theſe effects. Any Phyſician,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0007000300:6"/>who has conſider'd this caſe in ſome People after Flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will allow the juſtneſs of this Exception.</p>
            <p>As Vomiting Medicines have the ſame common Doſes with thoſe that Purge,
<note place="margin">The Doſes of Vomiting Medicines.</note> they admit alſo of the like divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Doſes; which, therefore may be found by the ſame Tables. Only, as People that are more Coſtive than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary require a proportionable greater Doſe of a Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicine: So they require their Doſe of a Vomiting Medicine to be conſiderably leſs, as is very very well known in hot Countries.</p>

            <head>The TABLES. <hi>Some Inſtances ſhewing the Defects of the preſent Practice, and how mended by the foregoing Tables.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The Doſes of the foregoing Tables, ariſing from Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, agree perfectly well with the common Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the beſt Authors; tho' their Obſervation is very general and ill made, if we except the very firſt Steps. For inſtance, Authors of all Countries, <hi>Engliſh, Dutch,
<note place="margin">Authors Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but do not Obſerve.</note> German, Italian</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> reckon the Doſes after the ſame manner; whereas, if they had been obſerv'd, they muſt have been different as are the Conſtitutions of Men in the different Countries.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The defect of their Obſervation is manifeſt by the diſproportion'd Doſes of ſome Medicines, their high Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being ſometimes double and ſometimes triple, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0007000300:7"/>more of their low Doſes, which is not conform to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for, let the low Doſe be what it will, the high Doſe of one Medicine muſt always bear the ſame proportion to the high Doſe of another, as did their low Doſes, <hi>viz.</hi> even in Manna, they reckon it from ℥j: commonly to ℥iij. and ℥iv. If it is ſaid that the firſt Doſe is the loweſt Doſe that is taken by a Man of a due Age, it is neither true in fact nor conform to their own way of reckoning: For inſtance, Rhubarb is ſaid to be taken from <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij. No body will ſay that this is the loweſt Doſe taken by a Man of a due Age as formerly; becauſe it is not in fact true, nor that the high natural Doſe is ℥<hi>ſs;</hi> for, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if ℥j. of Manna and <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j, of Rhubarb are the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive low Doſes, then ℥iv and <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij. cannot be the reſpective high Doſes. As to what concerns ſome extraordinary Doſes given by themſelves, and far exceeding the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Doſe, is eaſily accounted for by the Solution. There are many Examples of this Nature: Turbith, <hi>viz.</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reckon'd among them from <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij; yet <hi>Marg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravius,</hi> and good Authors, have given it to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iv. So <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locynthis</hi> from <hi>gr.</hi> vi. to <hi>gr.</hi> xij. and <hi>Fulgin. Fernel. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi> ſay they have given it to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <note place="margin">They have only given the Doſes for Men at full Age.</note> Authors have been far from being exact; for they have only dos'd theſe Medicines for People of full Age; but have left the Doſes of the different Ages in ſilence; nor have they told us at what time a Man takes his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Doſe, or how that alters in the Growth and Decline of Age, which is ſtill a very great difficulty for the moſt experienc'd Phyſicians to manage.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <note place="margin">Their way of determining Doſes falſe.</note> Their general Method is founded in a Miſtake; their loweſt Doſe being really the common Doſe taken by the generality of Men, which produces a multitude of Errours in the Practice. This is manifeſt in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing every Medicine.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0007000300:8"/>
            <p n="5">V. <note place="margin">This ſhewn particularly.</note> The mentioned Caſe is more manifeſt by theſe Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and it is two to one but that a Phyſician over Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or under Purges any Perſon in Health; and if more Caſes in Sickneſs are ſuppos'd, the odds will encreaſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably. Experience confirms this exactly: For if the middle Doſe is given to one of the loweſt Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the middle Doſe is to purge 7 or 8 times; in that caſe, the Perſon of the loweſt Conſtitution is purg'd near twice as much as he ought to be; and if given to one of the higheſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, he is purg'd but half of what he ſhould be. But if the Doſe of the higheſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is given to one of the middle Conſtitution, he is purg'd twice as much as he ought to be; and if given to one of the loweſt, he is purg'd four times as much, or about thirty times, as we find true by daily Experience. But if the Quantity of Blood, the Age, or Sickneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Errour, it may prove fatal. If this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration were illuſtrated by a proper number of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, we ſhould find ſome hundreds of, otherways una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable, Miſtakes now prevented by the Practice of theſe Tables.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We may eaſily account, by theſe Tables,
<note place="margin">Theſe Tables ſhew how the Doſes of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver purge People of full Age.</note> for the Doſes of Children over purging ſome People of good Health, and of due Age; a <hi>Phaenomenen</hi> ſo ſurprizing, that the ſmallneſs of the Doſe is commonly thought a good Excuſe for the Miſtake.</p>
