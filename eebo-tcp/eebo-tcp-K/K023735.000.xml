            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A DISSERTATION ON THE Recovery of PERSONS drown'd.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Truth in general is of the laſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, not only in affording a noble and exalted Satisfaction to the Mind, but alſo in forming the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and by that Means, promoting the moſt valuable Intereſts of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; ſo nothing can be a greater Reproach to Reaſon, nor a more palpable Affront offered to its auguſt and venerable Author, than that ignoble and unmanly Turn of Mind, commonly known by the Name of <hi>Credulity,</hi> which is no more than an implicit Contempt of Reaſon, and all the mental Powers, producing a Propenſity to believe certain Tenets, Doctrines, or Facts, without that Degree of Evidence, which a Mind ſtudious of Truth ought to require.</p>
            <p>But however odious <hi>Credulity</hi> may appear, when painted in her native Colours, ſhe is nevertheleſs,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0279301000:4"/>if we may be allowed the Expreſſion, a <hi>Spectre,</hi> which haunts the various Claſſes and Diſtinctions of Mankind, under a Form ſo infatuating and alluring, as to ſeduce them from the plain and amiable Paths of Truth, and bewilder them in the dark and gloomy Labyrinths of Ignorance, Error, and Confuſion. This deplorable Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in no Inſtance more effectually verified, than in theſe very Men, who profeſs a ſacred Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for Reaſon, and pretend to go wherever Truth ſhall conduct them; for, we frequently find, not only antient, but alſo modern Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Phyſicians, labouring with a pompous Shew of Learning and Ratiocination, to prove that Nature, by her ſtated and eſtabliſhed Laws, was capable of producing certain Effects, which Time has afterwards diſcovered never to have had any Exiſtence, except in the Imaginations of the Credulous, or in the chimerical Works of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who forſaking Fact and Nature, have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a full Scope to their Fancy and Invention. Thus in former Ages it was keenly diſputed, how it came about, that a ſmall Fiſh, call'd the <hi>Remora,</hi> was capable of putting a ſpeedy Stop to a Ship under Full-ſail; but this pretended Fact has, by later and more penetrating Naturaliſts, been diſcover'd to be abſolutely falſe. And, no doubt, the ever memorable Rabbit-Woman of <hi>Godalmin,</hi> would have made a conſiderable Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the Annals of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded Matter to the Members for copious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertations on the Force of Imagination, if ſhe had prudently ceas'd Breeding a Day ſooner. This bad Piece of Conduct, has, however, thrown an almoſt irreparable Diſgrace upon <hi>natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> by inducing the ſober and judicious Part of Mankind to imagine, that it was totally employ'd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0279301000:5"/>in explaining Viſions and Chimeras. Therefore, if we intend to philoſophiſe in ſuch a manner as not to diſgrace Philoſophy, we muſt have Facts duly aſcertain'd, before we attempt to explain and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for them; ſince, according to <hi>Kercher,</hi> in his <hi>Mund. Subterran.</hi> Lib. 10. <q>"'Tis as abſurd in phyſical Matters, to philoſophiſe without Experience, as it is for a blind Man to pretend to judge of Colours."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' from what has been ſaid, it ſufficiently appears, that <hi>Credulity</hi> is fatal to Truth, yet we obſerve in the Minds of ſome Men, an arrogant and preſumptuous <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> which, admitting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is eaſy to the Conception of its Poſſeſſors, is no leſs prejudicial to the genuine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Science, and Philoſophy; for, as, by the former we are expos'd to the Danger of adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Error as well as Truth; ſo by the latter our Minds are, as it were, manacled, and hinder'd from giving a rational Aſſent to Things and Facts cloath'd with the moſt ſtriking and diſtinguiſh'd Characters of Evidence, for no other Reaſon, than that we cannot comprehend them. It is, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a culpable Diffidence, to diſbelieve the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of a Perſon's retaining a latent Principle of Life, after he has remain'd ſome Hours, Days, and even Weeks under Water, ſince numerous Facts, related by the beſt Authors, vouch'd by the moſt candid Witneſſes, and recorded in the publick Archives of the moſt penetrating and ſagacious Nations, concur to remove the ſmalleſt Remains of Uncertainty in this Point. Beſides, I would have the Gentlemen of this Claſs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that their Conduct beſpeaks an inſupportable Degree of Pride, and amounts to a formal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that they themſelves are bleſſed with Geniuſes far ſuperior to others, ſince nothing can
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0279301000:6"/>be true, but what is comprehenſible by the vaſt Extent of their Capacities. And tho' Modeſty and Common-Senſe, ſhould not direct them to this Obſervation, yet what the World calls <hi>moral Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> ſtands upon Foundations, too ſtable and ſure to be ſhaken by their frivolous Conceits, or ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Remonſtrances. In a Word, the wiſe and thinking Part of Mankind will always be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to give their Aſſent to Facts ſeen by a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Number of Witneſſes, who have Senſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to guard againſt Impoſture themſelves, and Honeſty enough to ſay nothing but what is Truth to their Neighbours. All theſe advantagious Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attend the following Narrations, which, for the common Benefit of Mankind, have been collected from Authors of the greateſt Veracity, in order to ſhew, that there is often a Poſſibility of reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drown'd Perſons to Life, after vulgar Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and a Want of ſufficiently extenſive Views with Reſpect to the Laws of the animal Oeconomy, have laid a Foundation for concluding them irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieveably dead, and paſt all Hopes of Recovery.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bruhier,</hi> an eminent Phyſician of <hi>Paris,</hi> well known to the learned World, and highly eſteem'd for his Knowledge in his Profeſſion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three Years ago, publiſh'd a Treatiſe on the <hi>Uncertain Signs of Death,</hi> tending to prove, that many People are interr'd before they are really dead; and that there are frequent Inſtances of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have liv'd many Days without Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or any other apparent Signs of Life. This Doctrine he eſtabliſhes by many inconteſtable Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of People who have actually ſurviv'd their Funerals, and liv'd many Years after they had been buried, upon a Suppoſition, that they were actually dead. Hence he very judiciouſly infers,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0279301000:7"/>that 'tis not imprudent but inhuman, to ſuffer the Interment of our Friends and Relations, before we are convinc'd from the moſt evident Marks, that they are certainly and irrecoverably deceas'd; or till ſuch time as the Beginning of Putrefaction convinces us, that no Hopes remain of a Revival.</p>
            <p>In Confirmation of what this celebrated Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian has advanc'd, many Examples might be found in our own Country, which eſcap'd his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches; and no doubt it happens much more frequently, than is generally imagin'd; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in hyſterical Women, in thoſe who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a Habit of drinking ſpirituous Liquors to Exceſs, but particularly in thoſe who have been guilty (for ſo I can't forbear calling it) of taking frequent Doſes of Opium, or its Preparations, ſo as to render Life inſupportable without them, of which there are too many Inſtances.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine, however true, is not altogether modern; for we learn from <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> that the celebrated <hi>Empedocles</hi> acquir'd uncommon Honour, by reſtoring a Woman to Life who was thought to be dead many Days, and whoſe Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order he diſcover'd to be only a Strangulation of the Uterus, that is, an hyſteric Fit.</p>
            <p>We learn, farther, that <hi>Heraclides</hi> of <hi>Pontus,</hi> a noted Philoſopher, wrote a Treatiſe upon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Subject, which he intitled, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Of the Diſtemper in which the Patient is depriv'd of Reſpiration.</hi> In this he aſſerted, that the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might continue thirty Days, during which there was no Reſpiration, or any other Signs of Life, without any Marks of Putrefaction; and that notwithſtanding, the Patient might at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>
            <p>In Conſequence of the frequent Interments of People before they were really dead, Dr. <hi>Bruhier,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0279301000:8"/>in 1745, publiſh'd a ſmall Pamphlet, containing Propoſals for the Regulation of Funerals, and the Prevention of ſuch calamitous Diſaſters; which he endeavours to have confirm'd by the Legiſlature; for, ſays he, how many Women weary of their Huſbands, and Huſbands equally weary of their Wives; how many Children who have either a real or an imaginary Reaſon to be diſſatisfied with their Parents; and, eſpecially, how many cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and neceſſitous Heirs, who have long waited for the happy Moment, which was to put him in Poſſeſſion of an opulent Fortune, may not abuſe the Liberty the Law affords them of burying their Friends at the End of twenty-four Hours, at which Time they may, poſſibly, be really alive, and capable of a Recovery. And to prove this Regulation the more neceſſary, he relates the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Hiſtories.</p>
            <p>A Woman about eighty Years old, being taken for dead, was about to be laid out as ſuch, when a Perſon, who had perus'd his Treatiſe, oppos'd the Deſign. Next Morning the Woman was found recover'd from her profound Syncope, which, conſidering the intenſe Cold of the Seaſon, had probably prov'd a real Cauſe of her Death, had ſhe been taken out of her Bed.</p>
            <p>It is alſo ſufficiently known, that Cardinal <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cſa,</hi> firſt Miniſter to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> being ſuppoſed dead, and committed to a Surgeon in order to be embalm'd, thruſt away the Hand which conducted the fatal Inſtrument, which put a real End to his Life. But notwithſtanding this Accident, the barbarous Surgeon proceeded to finiſh the Operation.</p>
            <p>But as Submerſion, or Drowning, is the Subject of our preſent Enquiry, I ſhall only farther take Notice of the Hiſtories relating thereto.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0279301000:9"/>
            <p>The celebrated <hi>Kunckel,</hi> in <hi>Ephemerid. Nat. Curioſ.</hi> informs us, that a young Man had the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to fall from a Boat into the Water, and ſunk to the very Bottom, about fifteen hundred Paces, from the Shoar, which he did not reach till two Hours after. However, as it is natural for Perſons to give an Account of the ſeveral Circumſtances attending their reſpective States of Calamity and Diſtreſs, the young Man inform'd thoſe who had the Curioſity to enquire into his Condition during that Time, that whilſt he was making the moſt ſtrenuous Efforts to preſerve his Life, he thought of nothing but God, and the Means of recommending himſelf to his Favour and Acceptance; that the Voice of his darling Siſter, who wept bitterly on the Shore, for the Fate of her Brother, had ſerv'd to conduct him to the Land; that the Diſturbance of the Water by thoſe who ſought for him, and the Lamentations of the People on the Shore, were not only diſtinctly heard by him, but alſo prov'd extremely ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and uneaſy to him; that he thought his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration was carried on, without his knowing in what Manner, that the Water had not penetrated into any of the Cavities of his Body; and that he was hot, inſtead of being cold.</p>
            <p>The ſame judicious Author informs us, that he had an Opportunity of examining a Fiſherman, who fell from a Boat into the ſame Place, and was, by Means of the Ice, kept under Water for three Days, but upon his being found, appear'd full of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, ſaid that he enjoy'd good Health, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that the moſt remarkable Circumſtance of which he had been conſcious was, that a large Bladder had been form'd around his Head for his Preſervation.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0279301000:10"/>
            <p>The memorable Accident which befel the <hi>Swiſs Diver</hi> is ſo well atteſted, and accompanied with ſuch a peculiar Train of Circumſtances, that it cannot fail to make the moſt lively Impreſſions upon every Perſon capable of the ſmalleſt Degree of Reflection. As Neceſſity lays a Foundation for Induſtry, which frequently cannot be employ'd, but in a manner, which is either prejudicial to Health, or fatal to Life, ſo this adventurous Man follow'd the Buſineſs of plunging into the Water, and ſearching thoſe Holes in which he imagined the larger and better Sort of Fiſhes were lodg'd. Accordingly, being employ'd as Dr. <hi>Bruhier</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Story, to furniſh a Diſh of Fiſh for a Company, who intended to regale themſelves with a fine Dinner, he cheerfully undertook the Taſk. His Employers, in the mean Time, accompanied him to the Brink of the River, and ſeeing him plunge into the Water, retir'd, not in the leaſt doubting but he would keep his Word. The <hi>Swiſs,</hi> however, happening not to bring the Fiſh at the Hour appointed, the Company, when the Afternoon was pretty far advanc'd, went to the Banks of the River, in order to know the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Diſappointment. As the Clothes of the Diver lay on the River-ſide, ſo they ſoon ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected his deplorable Fate, and accordingly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him to be ſearch'd for with Hooks, in the Place into which they had ſeen him plunge. The Efforts for this Purpoſe were not in vain, for he was at laſt found, and taken out of the Water, tho' wounded in ſeveral Parts.</p>
            <p>As this unfortunate Man had been under Water for nine Hours, ſo the Curate of the Place, whoſe Profeſſion call'd for ſome Care of a Perſon in ſuch a Situation, had a Mind that he ſhould be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with interr'd; and he had been infallibly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0279301000:11"/>to the Grave, had not the celebrated Mr. <hi>Egly,</hi> a Member of the Royal Academy of <hi>Inſcriptions,</hi> who obſerv'd a Kind of Ebullition in the Water diſcharg'd from his Mouth, poſitively affirm'd that he was not dead. For that Gentleman juſtly aſcrib'd this Ebullition to the languid and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible Remains of Reſpiration.</p>
            <p>This Conduct of Mr. <hi>Egly,</hi> however uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, yet made ſo deep an Impreſſion upon the Spectators, that they carried the unfortunate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, into an adjacent Houſe, where having laid him out at full Length, they compreſs'd his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, in order to procure a Diſcharge of the Water he had ſwallow'd. By this Means having in three Quarters of an Hour evacuated a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Quantity of Water, he mov'd one of his Legs, a Circumſtance which ſufficiently evinc'd that he ſtill retain'd ſome faint Remains of Life. For this Reaſon he was, by Mr. <hi>Egly</hi>'s Orders, wrap'd up in warm Sheets, and gradually reftor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a natural Heat. Then being laid in a warm Bed, and his Life becoming gradually more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, a liberal Veneſection was made, which was ſucceeded by a Sigh, then by a ſlight Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what had befallen him, and ſoon after by a total Reſtitution of Health; and tho' Gratitude is rarely to be met with in the Breaſts of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, yet this important Service, ever after touch'd the Heart of the <hi>Swiſs,</hi> with the higheſt and moſt lively Senſe of the Obligations he lay under to Mr. <hi>Egly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> a Gentleman ſufficiently celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his untainted Integrity, and extenſive Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in his <hi>Phyſico-Theology,</hi> quotes the following Hiſtory from <hi>Pechlinus,</hi> an Author of no leſs Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Reputation.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0279301000:12"/>
            <p>About eighteen Years ago, a Gardner of <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningholm,</hi> now ſixty-five Years old, and ſufficiently vigorous and robuſt for a Perſon of that Age, made a generous Attempt to reſcue an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Neighbour who had fallen into the Water; but being too fool-hardy, he ventur'd upon the Ice, which broke, and let him fall into the River, which at that Part was eighteen Ells in Depth: He went perpendicularly to be Bottom, in which his Feet ſtuck for ſixteen Hours before he was found. He himſelf ſays, that he was no ſooner under Water, than he became rigid, and loſt not only the Power of Motion, but alſo all his Senſes, except that of hearing, which was affected by the Ringing of ſome Bells at <hi>Stockholm.</hi> He at firſt, alſo perceived a Kind of Bladder before his Mouth, which hinder'd the Ingreſs of the Water by that Paſſage tho' it enter'd freely into his Ears, and produc'd a Dulneſs of Hearing for ſome Time after. This unfortunate Man was in vain ſought for during ſixteen Hours, at the End of which Time he was taken up by Means of an Hook fix'd in his Head, and upon his total Recovery ſaid, that he was ſenſible of that particular Part of his Fate. However, whether from the prevailing Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Country, or the Perſuaſion of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons, certain Attempts were made in order to reſtore him to Life: For this Purpoſe he was wrap'd up in Blankets, leſt the Air entering too precipitately into his Lungs ſhould prove fatal to him. In this Condition, being gradually warm'd by Means of Sheets, he was rubb'd and ſtimulated till the Motion of his Blood, which had been check'd for ſo many Hours, return'd. At laſt he was totally reſtor'd by Means of Cordials, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiapoplectic Liquors. He as yet bears the Mark of the Hook, and ſays, that he is ſtill ſubject to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0279301000:13"/>Head-achs. This ſingular Accident, atteſted by the Oaths of Perſons who had been Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to it, induc'd the Queen to give him an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Penſion, and he was introduc'd to the Prince, in order to give an Account of what had befallen him.</p>
            <p>The celebrated <hi>Pechlinus</hi> has wrote the Hiſtory of a Woman, who remaining under Water for three whole Days, was happily reſtor'd to Life, almoſt in the ſame manner as the Gardner. This Fact, was ſo notorious, that the learned <hi>Tilaſius,</hi> Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-keeper to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and in whoſe Time the Woman was ſtill alive, gave the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Certificate of it, which is ſtill kept in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chives of the <hi>Acad. Natur. Curioſ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There lately was in</hi> Dalia, <hi>commonly called</hi> Wormſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>a Woman of the Name of</hi> Margaret Larſdotter, <hi>who having the Misfortune to be thrice drown'd, remain'd the firſt Time, ſhe being then young, for three whole Days under Water, but the two other Times had more ſpeedy Relief afforded her. She died in</hi> 1672, <hi>in the ſeventy-fifth Year of her Age.</hi> Telaſius.</p>
            <p>Tho' this Accident, and the Delivery from it, happening ſo many different Times to the ſame Perſon, may be ſome be look'd upon as fabulous and romantic, yet upon the whole it appears to be cloath'd with the moſt genuine Character of Truth and Evidence; for is it credible, that a Man of Probity, Candour, and learning, as we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſuppoſe the Librarian of a rich and powerful Monarch to be, ſhould in a manner ſo poſitive and circumſtantial, dare to affirm a Fact, which was only ſuſpect, and much leſs one that was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely falſe? Is it probable that a Man of <hi>Pechlinus</hi>'s Character, who is no leſs univerſally than juſtly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0279301000:14"/>applauded for his extenſive Erudition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate medicinal Knowledge, ſhould compoſe an elaborate Treatiſe in order to explain the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of this Fact, without taking due Pains to have its Reality ſufficiently confirm'd and aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd? or, in a word, is it to be ſuppoſed, that this Phyſician, who was look'd upon as the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Ornament of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Nation, ſhould have the Impudence, to appeal to all the <hi>Literati</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> for the Truth of a Fact, which had not the Sanction of ſufficient Evidences? Why ſhould we be more ſcrupulous than <hi>Pechlinus</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Authors, who never call'd the Truth of this Fact in Queſtions? The celebrated <hi>Bartholin,</hi> in <hi>Act. Med. Haffn. Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 42. ſpeaks of it in the following manner; <q>"I can by no Means remain diffident with reſpect to the Truth of a Story confirm'd by the concurring Teſtimonies of ſo many Witneſſes of Candour and Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; and of which <hi>Pechlinus</hi> has demonſtrated the Poſſibility by other Examples of a ſimilar Nature: I am only ſurpris'd, that ſo ſingular a Narrative, ſhould be ſo long buried in Oblivion, in a Nation otherwiſe ſo curious and fond of Diſcoveries."</q>
            </p>
            <p>But we ſhall have no manner of Reaſon to doubt of this Fact recorded by <hi>Pechlinus,</hi> when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that other celebrated Phyſicians and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, aſſure us of the Truth of other Accidents highly ſimilar and analogous to it. Thus <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Benedicius,</hi> Lib. x. Cap. 9. ſpeaks in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner. <q>"Life has been frequently ſeen reſtor'd to Perſons who have remain'd under Water during forty-eight Hours."</q> The ſame Author, for this very Reaſon, thinks it highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, to inter drown'd and hyſteric Patients, till ſeventy-two hours after their ſuppos'd Death.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0279301000:15"/>
               <hi>Borelli,</hi> in <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. informs us, that, <q>"a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perſon of Diſtinction having remain'd for a long Time under the Water, was taken for dead when he was found; but proper Efforts being made to reſtore his Life, he was rous'd from his ſuppos'd Death, and long ſurviv'd his Misfortune."</q> Beſides, the Credibility of the Fact, told by <hi>Pechlinus,</hi> is ſufficiently confirm'd by the Suffrage of the learned and judicious <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,</hi> who, in his 79th Conſultation, wrote in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to determine, whether the Return of Life to a young Man who had remain'd an Hour under Water, was miraculous, and as ſome ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious People would have it, to be aſcrib'd to a Perſon of ſuperior Sanctity, ſpeaks in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner. <q>"This Event is ſo far from being miraculous, that it can hardly come under the Denomination of ſurpriſing, ſince vaſt Numbers of Perſons have return'd to Life, after having been drown'd, or ſuffocated in any other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not only for ſome Hours, but alſo during one, and even three whole Days; becauſe the Suppreſſion of Reſpiration in the Water, had occaſioned an Oppreſſion of the Spirits, and had brought on an apoplectic Paroxyſm, which render'd them apparently dead, tho' their Lives were really preſerv'd by Tranſpiration, which augmenting gradually, laid a Foundation for a free Reſpiration."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Poſſibility of retaining a Principle of Life for a long Time under Water, is ſtill more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſingly confirm'd by <hi>Kunckel,</hi> in <hi>Miſcellan. Nat. Curioſ. Decad.</hi> 3. <hi>An.</hi> 5 &amp; 6. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 71. where he ſpeaks in the following manner. <q>"I am ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſenſible, that in <hi>Sweden,</hi> no one Doubts of the Poſſibility of retaining Life under Water for eight Days; and that the ſollowing Accident is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0279301000:16"/>by no Means call'd in Queſtion by thoſe who live near the Place where it happened. Some Time ago, about four Leagues from the Town of <hi>Falung,</hi> a Painter fell from a Boat into the Water in ſuch a manner, as to remain upright with his Feet at the Bottom. He was in vain ſearch'd for during eight Days; at the End of which Time, he appear'd alive on the Surface of the Water. The Magiſtrate and Clergyman of the Place, aſk'd him the following Queſtions. Whether he had reſpir'd all the Time of his Submerſion? To which he anſwer'd, He knew nothing of the Matter. Whether he had thought upon God and recommended his Soul to him? To which he reply'd, Very often. Whether he could ſee and hear? To which he anſwer'd, Yes, and ſaid that he would often have laid hold of the Hooks employ'd in finding him, if he could have mov'd his Arms. He alſo, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Fiſh prov'd highly offenſive and uneaſy to him, by the Attacks they made on his Eyes; and being aſk'd by what Means he guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt theſe Attacks, he anſwer'd, by mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Eye-lids. As to his Senſe of hearing, he affirm'd, that nothing wrs more ungrateful, and even painful, to him than ſtriking the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Water; and that in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he was affected with a violent Pain of his Ears, which was forthwith communicated to his whole Body, every Time People came to draw Water in Buckets. When he was aſk'd, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he had been ſenſible of Hunger, and diſcharg'd his Excrements? He reply'd, that he had not. Being interrogated, Whether he had ſlept? he anſwer'd, he knew nothing of it, but believ'd he had, becauſe he was ſome time depriv'd of all Senſation and Reflection; adding, that all
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0279301000:17"/>the Thoughts he remember'd to have paſs'd in his Breaſt, had only God, and the Means of his own Deliverance, for their Objects."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Nature and Circumſtances of the Accident now related, lay a ſufficient Foundation, for our believing the following memorable Event, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as it happened to a Perſon of Diſtinction, and is atteſted as authentic by Men of Learning and Probity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gocellinus,</hi> a young Man, and Nephew to one of the Archbiſhops of <hi>Cologne,</hi> had the Misfortune to fall into the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and was not found for fifteen Days after; and being laid in an adjacent Church, in order to be interr'd, ſoon return'd to Life, and ſurviv'd the Accident a long Time.</p>
            <p>As there are a great many ſecret Things in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and probably numberleſs latent Circumſtances in the animal Oeconomy, with which we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely unacquainted; and as Perſons of a curious and attentive Turn of Mind, daily obſerve Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which they before thought impoſſible, ſo we have no Reaſon to doubt of ſurpriſing Facts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Men of Learning and Candour, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally to deny the Truth of Events, which at firſt appear incredible. Of this Kind, is the following Narrative.</p>
            <p>The celebrated Mr. <hi>Burmann</hi> aſſures us, that in <hi>Boneſs</hi> of <hi>Pithovia,</hi> he heard a funeral Sermon preach'd upon the Death of one <hi>Laurence Jones,</hi> a Man of ſeventy Years of Age, who as the Preacher ſaid, was drown'd when ſixteen Years old; and continued ſeven Weeks under Water, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, he return'd to Life, and enjoy'd good Health. However viſionary and romantic this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident may appear, in the Eyes of thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have diveſted their Minds of vulgar Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, yet it has met with Credit from the moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0279301000:18"/>and ſagacious Authors who liv'd at the Time in which it happen'd. Thus the learned and judicious <hi>Langelott,</hi> in <hi>Miſcellan. Natur. Curioſ. Decad.</hi> 1. <hi>An.</hi> 6. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 20, not being able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how a Perſon can preſerve a Principle of Life ſo long, without the Aſſiſtance of the Air, in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo cold and full of Nitre, as thoſe of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and not being ſatisfied with ſimilar Accidents daily happening to ſome Birds and Infects, is yet ſo far from doubting of the Truth of this Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that he applies to the learned Members of the <hi>Acad. Natur. Curioſ.</hi> for their Opinion and Explication of it; by which Means he imagin'd that effectual Meaſures for reſtoring many drown'd Perſons might be diſcover'd. Beſides, it is by no Means probable that a Man of Mr. <hi>Burmann</hi>'s Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity would forge ſuch a Story, in order to ſee what enormous Lengths Credulity was capable of carrying his Fellow-Creatures; nor is it poſſible that the Clergyman, ſhould, from the Pulpit, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert this Fact as true, if it had not really been ſo, ſince <hi>Laurence Jones,</hi> was a Native of the Place, and well known to every one of his Audience.</p>
            <p>But upon the Whole, granting that this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of <hi>Laurence Jones</hi> was falſe, which however we have no Reaſon to believe, yet the Recital of it has a great Tendency not only to illuſtrate our Subject, but alſo to produce happy Effects in Life; for, 1ſt, It is certainly the genuine and uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Intereſt of the Public, to be appriz'd of the Poſſibility of a Perſon's retaining a Principle of Life for a long Time under Water; 2dly, The Concluſion to be drawn from this ſeemingly mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Effect is, that if after a long Time, a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is taken out of the Water, without the Signs of Putrefaction, it is the Duty of thoſe who find ſuch a Body, to treat it as if there were ſtill a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0279301000:19"/>Poſſibility of reſtoring it to Life; and 3dly, If it is certain from uncontroverted Facts, that Perſons have retain'd Life under Water for ſeveral Days, there is no Reaſon, from the Laws of the animal Oeconomy, and the hitherto known Properties of the animal Fluids, to diſbelieve that the like ſhould happen to Perſons who have alſo remain'd under Water for ſeveral Weeks.</p>
            <p>As our Modeſty ought always to be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd to the difficult and intricate natures of the Subjects we pretend to conſider, ſo we frankly acknowledge, that theſe and other ſimilar Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as it were, bewilder the Mind, and perplex the moſt penetrating Capacities, when they attempt to account for them; ſince we have never yet diſcover'd wherein the conſtituent Principle of Life exactly conſiſts, and ſince there are various Properties both of the Solids and Fluids of the human Body, to which we are intire Strangers. Some however, affirm, that a Principle of Life may in the deplorable State of Submerſion, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd for a long Time, becauſe the Coldneſs of the Water renders the Circulation ſlower, and ſupperſſes the Tranſpiration of the vital Air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Blood; whilſt at the ſame Time, ſome Portions of the Air lodg'd in the Water, probably penetrate into the Bodies of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But <hi>Platerus</hi> and <hi>Bartholin</hi> ſeem to account in a more rational and ſatisfactory manner for Phaenomena of this Kind. The former of theſe Authors, in explaining how a Woman, who was drown'd in the <hi>Rhine,</hi> for murdering her own Child, return'd to Life after ſhe was found, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that this Accident was the Effect of a Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope, in which Reſpiration and the Motion of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0279301000:20"/>the Heart are ſtopt. Now 'tis certain from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Obſervation, that theſe two Functions may be ſuppereſs'd without the actual Loſs of Life, as is frequently obvious in violent Syncopes, and hyſteric Paroxyſms, from which the Patients do not often recover in an Hour or more, during which Time, the ſlighteſt Indications of Life by the Pulſe and Reſpiration, are not to be obſerv'd.</p>
            <p>If any one ſhould ſay, that it beſpeaks an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable Exceſs of Credulity, to believe that a Syncope may laſt for a Week or longer, and that conſequently the Motion of the Heart and Pulſe may be for that Time ſuſpended, without neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily producing Death; we may juſtly reply, that hitherto no Perſon has diſcover'd wherein the Eſſence and Principle of Life conſiſts; and that there are in Nature various Phaenomena, which ſeem to prove, that the Motion of the Heart, and the Circulation of the Humours, are rather palpable Signs of the Exiſtence of Life, than its proximate and immediate Cauſes. This Doctrine we ſhall endeavour to eſtabliſh, in a ſtrictly ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical manner, by comparing thoſe Events which happen to Vegetables and the Brute Creation, with ſimilar Accidents which befall Mankind.</p>
            <p>For this Purpoſe we ſhall firſt conſider the State and Condition of ſuch Plants, as retain a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Life and Vegetation during the whole Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. All the Difference, according to <hi>Pechlinus,</hi> between theſe, and the Plants of the animal Kind is, that in the latter the Principle of Motion is weaker, and the Texture of the Fibres leſs firm; whereas the former contain a much larger Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Oil, and have the Spirit ſubſervient to their Vegetation repell'd by the Cold, to the Bulbs,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0279301000:21"/>Roots, and Seeds, where it circulates in a languid manner, without having Force to propel Buds, Flowers, and Bloſſoms, till the kind and genial Hears of the Spring, render it more powerful and active. Why may we not, therefore, ſuppoſe that ſomething analogous to this may happen in ſome human Bodies, who have been under the Water for ſome Time.</p>
            <p>This is not the only Inſtance in nature, which we can bring in Confirmation of our Doctrine; for certain Inſects paſs the whole Winter in <hi>Chryſalides,</hi> or conſiderably hard Pellicules, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcovering the ſmalleſt Signs of Life, tho' 'tis certain they are not dead, ſince a ſmall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Heat only, is requiſite to produce their laſt Metamorphoſis. The Reaſon of this apparent Death, is the Cold of the Atmoſphere, ſo inſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſating their Fluids, as that they can only circulate in a faint and languid manner, round an highly minute and ſmall Center. The Degree of Fluidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which they retain, is however, ſo conſiderable, that a more intenſe Cold than we perceive on the Earth, is incapable of totally coagulating them, as is ſufficiently evinc'd by the curious Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Mr. <hi>Reaumur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Phaenomenon is not only obſerv'd in the <hi>Chryſalides</hi> of Inſects, but the <hi>Seminal Principle</hi> is alſo preſerv'd free from Coagulation, and without diſcovering the ſmalleſt Sign of Life, in Eggs, which may be conſider'd as the <hi>Chryſalides,</hi> or Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licules of Animals whoſe Life is perceptible. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatic Inſects, alſo, plunge themſelves into the Mud, where they remain without Motion, till the Spring; which holds equally true of Frogs and Toads, according to <hi>Valentinus,</hi> in <hi>Diſſert. Epiſtol.</hi> 4.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0279301000:22"/>The like happens to ſome terreſtrial Inſects; for Mr. <hi>Reaumur</hi> has by Experiment and Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſufficiently evinc'd, that Ants during the whole Winter, remain apparently dead, till the Approach of the Spring.</p>
            <p>A third and more powerful collateral Proof of this Doctrine, is drawn from the Conſideration of ſome Animals, whole Blood is warm, and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in the ſame manner with that of the Human Species; ſince in theſe alſo the Circulation and Reſpiration are ſuppreſs'd during the Winter, but return in the Spring.</p>
            <p>Thus of Swallows it may be ſaid, that during one Half of the Year they are dead, and the other alive. <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> and <hi>Scheffer,</hi> in a Letter wrote to <hi>Hevelius,</hi> affirm, that in ſome northerly Countries, it is very common for Fiſhermen to find in the Water large Cluſters of Swallows, which in the Beginning of the Autumn, had thus pil'd themſelves up. Thoſe Authors alſo inform us, that ſome Species of Swallows, ſpontaneouſly ſeek a Refuge in the Waters, others take their Flight to foreign Climates, others conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Holes of old and decay'd Buildings, in the Sand, and in their own Neſts; and that others finding a Decay of Strength in their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to other Countries, plunge themſelves into the Sea, where they remain till the genial Spring rouſes their latent Principle of Life and Motion.</p>
            <p>The celebrated <hi>Kircher,</hi> in <hi>Mund. ſubterran.</hi> Lib. 8. Sect. 4. informs us, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> and other Territories of the <hi>Archipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lago,</hi> have told him, that every Year, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd large Quantities of Storks and Swallows flying thro' their Countries from <hi>Egypt</hi> and the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0279301000:23"/>Coaſts of <hi>Lybia,</hi> and that theſe latter when fatigu'd with flying, plac'd themſelves, to the number of five or ſix, on the Back of a Stork, whom they recompens'd by an uninterrupted and melodious Song. There, are, therefore, continues the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, ſome Swallows which fly from one Country to another; but 'tis equally certain from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the Swallows of cold Climates make no ſuch Voyages; but during the Winter conceal themſelves in Caves, Lakes, Rivers, Seas, and the Cavities of Trees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> in Lib. 15. Chap. 10. informs us, that ſuch Swallows as are taken out of the Water before the due Time, do not live long; and adds, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Tivoli,</hi> when ſhewing him Mount <hi>Sciſſo,</hi> which Name it receives from a fooliſh Report of its being divided at the Crucifixion of our Saviour, aſſur'd him, that in the Winter-Seaſon, large Quantities of Swallows apparently dead were to be found on it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as no ſuch Animals are to be found there in Summer. He then quotes <hi>Cyſatus,</hi> who in his Deſcription of <hi>Switzerland</hi> affirms, that about <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> ſome Workmen when digging up the Earth for laying the Foundation of a public Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, found a ſubterraneous Cave, from which flew about twenty or more Swallows. Whence the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor concludes, that all theſe Birds do not paſs the Sea at their Diſappearance, but that ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into the Cavities of Mountains, others in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Trees; but that this moſt frequently happens in northerly Climates.</p>

               <hi>Fortunus Licetus,</hi> in <hi>Tr. de Feriis Altric. Animal. Diſp.</hi> 19. affirms, that in upper <hi>Poland,</hi> every Perſon may be experimentally convinc'd, that the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0279301000:24"/>ſame Swallows which in Summer build their Neſts upon the Tops of Houſes, towards the End of <hi>September</hi> plunge themſelves into Ditches and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, where they remain conceal'd till about the Middle of <hi>May.</hi> He, alſo, informs us, that when the Inhabitants ſeeing Fiſh thro' the Ice, break it in order to catch them, they alſo frequently find Cluſters of Swallows adhering to each other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcovering the ſmalleſt Signs of Life, till they are brought to a Stove, where they ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Life. But what is ſtill more remarkable is, that as ſoon as the <hi>Polanders,</hi> who imagine it unlawful to kill theſe Swallows, ſet them at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, they forthwith fly back to the Water, and plunge themſelves into it.</p>
            <p>The celebrated <hi>Huet,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Avranches,</hi> who travell'd thro' <hi>Sweden,</hi> informs us, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Caen</hi> and the Sea, along the Shore of the River <hi>Orne,</hi> there are many Caves, in which, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Winter, have been found large Cluſters of Swallows, ſuſpended like ſo many Bunches of Grapes; and that the like was long ago obſerv'd in <hi>Italy.</hi> For <hi>Pedo Albinovanus,</hi> in the Elegy he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on the Death of <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> ſpeaks of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of the Swallows to the Rocks, as an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sign of the Approach of Winter.</p>

               <hi>Bodin,</hi> quoted by <hi>Camerarius, Cant.</hi> 7. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 71. informs us, in the ſecond Book of his <hi>Theatre of Nature,</hi> that when the People who inhabit the Coaſts of the <hi>Baltic</hi> Sea, are employ'd among the Rocks in ſearching for yellow Amber, they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0279301000:25"/>find large Cluſters of Swallows. <hi>Camera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> ſubjoins, that ſome Authors affirm, that <q>"Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows conceal themſelves in the Bottom of the Sea, where they ſleep till the Appearance of a proper Seaſon for their quitting it; but this is impoſſible ſince they have Lungs, and for that Reaſon muſt neceſſarily periſh in ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition."</q> But however ſpecious and concluſive this Reaſoning of <hi>Camerarius</hi> may appear, yet 'tis certain that the Truth of Facts, which have actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happened, can never be invalidated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franciſeus de Frankenau</hi> in his Medicinal Satyres, confirms this Opinion with Reſpect to Swallows, by the Authorities of <hi>Lauremberg,</hi> in <hi>Acer. Philol.</hi> Lib. 3. Cap. 71; of <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> in his <hi>Append. de Lucis Natur.</hi> Cap. 1; of <hi>Deuſingius,</hi> in <hi>Vindict. Faet.</hi> Sect. 5; and of <hi>Fournier,</hi> in his Geography, who in Part 1. Lib. 2. Cap. 5. informs us, that they are commonly found in the <hi>Norwegian</hi>-Seas, as alſo in the Lakes and Rivers of <hi>Sileſia, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Moravia;</hi> and that in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Autumn, large Numbers of them plunge themſelves into Wells. The ſame Author, alſo, eſtabliſhes his own Opinion by the additional Suffrages of <hi>Cromerus,</hi> in <hi>Hiſt. Polon,</hi> Lib. 1; of <hi>Hevelius;</hi> of <hi>Marcellus Donatus,</hi> in <hi>Hiſt. Med. Memorab.</hi> Lib. 4. Cap. 12. and of <hi>Helvicius,</hi> in his Epigrams.</p>
            <p>The celebrated Mr. <hi>Falconet,</hi> whoſe Judgment and Veracity render his ſingle Word a ſufficient Evidence, informs us, that being in the Houſe of a Gentleman of <hi>Breſt</hi> in the Winter Seaſon, he ſaw a Servant bring in a Kind of Maſs or Lump, which appeared to be Earth, and which ſome Fiſhermen had caught in their Nets. By waſhing it carefully,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0279301000:26"/>in order to diſcover what it was, it was found to be a Group of Swallows, which reſum'd Life by being expos'd to the Fire for ſome time.</p>
            <p>Swallows are not the only Birds which conceal themſelves in the Bottoms of Rivers, in order to paſs the Winter; for <hi>John Baptiſte de Fulgoſa,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Doge of <hi>Genoa,</hi> affirms, that <hi>Gervas Tibel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius,</hi> wrote to <hi>Otho</hi> the Fourth, that ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons having thrown their Nets into a River of that Country in the Winter Time, they brought to Land a large Quantity of Storks, which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently dead, with their Beaks fix'd in each other's Fundament; but they were ſoon reſtor'd to Life, by means of Heat. The ſame Author adds, that in 1467, near <hi>Metz</hi> in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> a large Number of apparently dead Storks were found in a River, and that being put into a warm Bath, they recover'd Life.</p>
            <p>The learned <hi>Voſſius,</hi> in <hi>Append. de Lucis Natur.</hi> informs us, that at the Approach of Winter, Storks, Herons, and ſome other Birds of the like Nature, do not fly to <hi>Egypt,</hi> or into more temperate Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, but plunge themſelves into Ditches and Marſhes.</p>
            <p>The Poſſibility of retaining Life for a long Time under Water, is ſtill farther evinc'd, by conſidering thoſe Birds with which our Fields and Foreſts are richly ſtock'd in Summer; but which are not to be ſeen in Winter. If it ſhould be ſaid, that theſe, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Winter, live upon the Stores they have amaſs'd in the Summer; I anſwer, that they are by no Means provident againſt future Want. Hence they muſt neceſſarily conceal themſelves, in Places ſuited to their particular Natures; and as it is equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſilble for them, as for the human Species, to live
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0279301000:27"/>awake without Aliments, 'tis more than probable that during the whole Winter, they are, as it were, lock'd up in ſo lethargic a Sleep, that they ſuſtain no Loſs or Diſſipation of their Fluids, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently require no Reparation.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be aſk'd, whether theſe Animals, during ſuch a State, retain a real Principle of Life? I anſwer, that the Thing is not only probable, but may be alſo evinc'd from Fact and Experience, ſince the moſt celebrated natural Hiſtorians and Phyſicians give us ſtrong and uncontroverted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this Kind. Thus in <hi>Ephemerid. Nat. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſ.</hi> we are inform'd, that a certain Gentleman in the Winter Seaſon, order'd an hollow Trunk of a Sallow Tree, which by his Direction had been cut down the preceding Autumn, to be laid on the Fire; but a ſmall Portion of it happening to be left in a Corner of the Room, he had the Curioſity to examine it, and upon his doing ſo, found Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers arrang'd and diſpos'd in a natural Manner: Theſe he gently pluck'd off, and underneath found the Fleſh of a ſmall Bird which he believ'd to be dead, though he could not diſcover to what Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies it belonged. However, with reſpect to this Circumſtance, he was ſoon undeceiv'd; for having expos'd it to the Influence of the Fire, it ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd palpable Signs of Life. Something ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and analogous to this, no doubt, happens with reſpect to many of thoſe Quadrupeds which inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit our Foreſts, for Want of a Nouriſhment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to give their Blood that Degree of Fluidity, which is abſolutely neceſſary to its Circulation, ſince it is certain, that a far ſmaller Number is to be ſeen in Winter than in Summer.</p>
            <p>After theſe Examples of an apparent Death in Birds whoſe Blood is warm, we have no Reaſon to be ſurpriz'd at <hi>Pechlinus,</hi> when he affirms, that in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0279301000:28"/>the Winter Time, Fiſhes not only appear dead, but are conſequently cover'd over with a Cruſt of Ice in their Holes, without having the vital Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple deſtroy'd in them; for they begin to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, when the Heat of the Atmoſphere, or an artificial Fire, melts the Ice. The like, continues the Author, happens to Serpents, Toads, Frogs, Tortoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in a Word all amphibious Animals, when the Cold inſpiſſates their Juices; which being naturally viſcid, are conſequently more proper to prevent the Diſſipation of that vital Spirit, which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to reſtore them to Life.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be obſerv'd, that thoſe Fiſhes which have been thus frozen, do not long ſurvive their artificial Reſtitution to Life; becauſe the Froſt having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the Principles of their Blood, the vital Spirit, when beginning to act and unfold itſelf, can no longer form a Maſs of Fluids of an uniform Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thus Wine when frozen, and artificially thaw'd, contracts a diſagreeable Flavour, becauſe the Solution being procur'd in an unnatural Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, hinders the ſpirituous Part of the Wine from mixing with its other Principles, in the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Proportion as before.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Pechlinus</hi> advances with Reſpect to Fiſhes, is entirely conformable to the Opinion of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus,</hi> in <hi>Tr. de Piſcibus in ſiceo degeritibus,</hi> where we are inform'd, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Pontus,</hi> frequently find Fiſhes in the Ice, which diſcover no Signs either of Motion or Senſation, till they are put into a Fiſh-Back, or laid among Straw. This Circumſtance, according to <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> happens particularly to the Gudgeon, and ſome other Fiſhes of a ſimilar Nature.</p>
            <p>The last Proof of the Poſſibility of a Perſon's retaining a Principle of Life for a long Time under Water, without a Supply of Aliments for the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0279301000:29"/>Purpoſes of Nutrition, is drawn from a Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome Quadaupeds, as the Hedge-Hog, the Marmotte, the Dormouſe, and ſome others, which in the Beginning of Winter concealing themſelves in the Earth, are ſeiz'd with ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a Sleep that they appear to be dead, ſince neither the Pulſation of their Arteries, nor their Reſpiration are perceptible. This Circumſtance, no doubt, induc'd the celebrated <hi>Harvey</hi> in <hi>Lib. de Generat. Animal. Exercit.</hi> 50<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſpeak in the following Manner: <q>"Some ſanguineous Animals live long without any Pulſe, and lie conceal'd during the Whole of the Winter, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which they remain alive, tho' their Heart retains no Motion, and their Reſpiration ſtops, juſt as it happens to Perſons attack'd with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copes, and hyſteric Fits, whoſe Pulſe is totally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh'd."</q> Tho' <hi>Harvey</hi> was the glorious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer of the Circulation of the Blood, and may for that Reaſon be ſuppos'd to be a keen Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in its Behalf, yet 'tis ſufficiently obvious from this Paſſage, that he did not believe it abſolutely neceſſary to the Preſervation of Life. But <hi>Pechli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> whether from Prejudice, or rational Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from what he had obſerv'd, is of Opinion, that in theſe Animals, Reſpiration is carried on, by a Motion of the Diaphragm, ſo inſenſible as to eſcape the Eye of the Obſerver. He alſo obſerves, that in this State, it is neceſſary their Reſpiration ſhould be ſuch, becauſe if it was perform'd in the uſual Manner, the Motion of the Blood would be ſo likewiſe; in conſequence of which, the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration and Neceſſity for Aliments would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſtrong; a Circumſtance incompatible with the Condition of theſe Animals, which lie hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earth during the whole Winter.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0279301000:30"/>
            <p>Tho' theſe Relations may poſſibly appear very ſingular and ſurpriſing to Perſons unacquainted with Natural Hiſtory; yet they infallibly prove, that in the brute Creation at leaſt, Reſpiration, the Circulation of the Blood, and Pulſation of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries may ceaſe for a long Time, without the total Extinction and Destruction of Life. Now is it not highly probable, or rather abſolutely certain, that ſomething ſimilar and analogous to this may happen to human Creatures, who have the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be drown'd, ſince in both, the Solids and Fluids act and move by the ſame Laws, ſo in both Suffocation muſt be the ſame Thing, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently its Effects remov'd by the ſame Means?</p>
            <p>Beſides, there is by no Means any Reaſon for believing, that an Inſtance of this ſurprſing Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and Want of Food, prodnc'd by ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and lethargic Sleep, as that of the Marmotte, is not to be found among the human Species; for in <hi>Miſcellan. Academ. Natur. Curioſ. An.</hi> 8. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 67. the celebrated <hi>Ludovicus,</hi> firſt Phyſician to the Duke of <hi>Saxe-Gotha</hi> informs us, that a young Girl, who for ſome Fault ſhe had committed being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of a ſevere Chaſtiſement from her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, retir'd to the moſt conceal'd Part of a Thicket, where, ſeven Days after her Elopement, ſhe was found lying on her Belly with all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Signs of Death, except that her Limbs were ſtill flexible and pliant; her Viſage was overſpread with a viſcid Phlegm, which was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with an hoary Kind of Down, and with the falling Leaves which had adher'd to it. Her Mouth and Noſtrils were entirely full of a thick Mucus: But notwithstanding theſe ſeemingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Circumſtances, the Phyſician call'd to her Aſſiſtance, order'd her Body to be warm'd by Means of Friction; Then, with warm Water,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0279301000:31"/>waſhing away the Phlegm which cover'd her Face, and the viſcid Mucus which obſtructed her Mouth and Noſtrils, he pour'd into her Mouth a Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Brandy, which ſeem'd to go down her Throat, and was the only Cordial he had at hand. Upon exhibiting a ſecond Spoonful, ſhe fetch'd a Sigh, and a third made her open her Eyes.</p>
            <p>We now proceed, to conſider the moſt proper and efficacious Meaſure to be taken for the Relief of drown'd Perſons; for which Purpoſe we ſhall previouſly inveſtigate and aſcertain the genuine Cauſe of Suffocation.</p>
            <p>Not only the antient Schools of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> but alſo moſt of the ſucceeding Phyſicians, till the Days of <hi>Platerus,</hi> imagin'd that the Suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was produc'd by the Water which enter'd into the Stomach, Breaſt, and Lungs; in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which falſe Notion they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fully authoriz'd to attempt its Diſcharge with all poſſible Expedition. For this Purpoſe they order'd drown'd Perſons to be ſuſpended by the Feet, or laid upon their Bellies, on a Hogſhead or Tub, which was to be agitated from one Side to the other, imagining that by this Poſition, the Abdomen and Breaſt being compreſs'd, and the Head hanging down, the Agitation of the Veſſel, muſt neceſſarily facilitate the Evacuation of the Water, which they ſuppos'd was alſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by the declining Situation of the ſuperior Part of the Body. With the ſame Intention, they alſo order'd ſuch Meaſures as had a Tendency to excite Vomiting.</p>
            <p>But as a falſe Theory never fails to lay a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for a dangerous Practice, ſo we have juſt Reaſon to condemn this Method of Suſpenſion, or hanging by the Heels; for the Water ſwallow'd by drowning Perſons deſcends into the Stomach,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0279301000:32"/>and not into the Thorax, ſo that it cannot prevent their Recovery. This Circumſtance muſt happen, not only ſo long as a Perſon retains a Senſe of his State and Condition, but alſo afterwards; for as the Water is hinder'd from entring into the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Trachaea and Lungs by a mechanical Effort, in which Reaſon has no ſhare, ſo the Lungs may in this State be compar'd to an empty Bottle plung'd in Water, into which the Fluid does not enter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Air it contains reſiſts its Acceſs, and this the rather happens, becauſe the Motion of the Breaſt, deſtin'd to attract the Air, at that Time, totally ceaſes, and conſequently nothing forces the Water to enter and fill up its Place. This Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is not only evinc'd from the Structure of the Parts, but alſo confirm'd by Experience.</p>
            <p>Thus the learned <hi>Platerus,</hi> in <hi>Queſt.</hi> 5. poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirms, that if drown'd Perſons ſwallow any Water, the Quantity of it is too ſmall to prove mortal to them; becauſe he always found but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little of it in their Stomachs. He alſo adds, that moſt of the Water which appears to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd from the Mouths of Perſons ſuſpended by the Heels, really flow'd from their Cloaths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nymman,</hi> in <hi>Tr. de Vita foet. in Utero,</hi> ſpeaks thus, <q>"Who could believe that a Foetus ſo long included in the Uterus, where it moves all its Limbs, ſhould yet never move its Jaw-bone, nor open its Mouth. Beſides, it always has its Noſtrils open, notwithſtanding which it has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been obſerv'd that the Liquor of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nios has enter'd its Body. Thus it is with the Human Foetus, as with thoſe who are drown'd, ſince in diſſecting many of theſe laſt, I have hardly found a Pint of Water in their Bodies."</q>

            <p>In the <hi>Miſcellan. Nat. Curioſ. An.</hi> 2. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 251. <hi>Wepfer,</hi> gives an Account of the Anatomy of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0279301000:33"/>ſome Beavers, one of which was drown'd. The Author having open'd the <hi>Arteria Trachaea,</hi> no Water was diſcharg'd from the Lungs; but there were about four Ounces of Water, like the Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Fleſh, found in the right Cavity of the Breaſt, and about three Ounces of the ſame Kind in the Left. This Extravaſation the Author juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſes produc'd by the Expreſſion of a bloody Lymph from the Pores of the Bronchia of this Animal, which had for a long Time ſtruggled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo violent a Death as that of Drowning. Neither pure Water nor Water ting'd with Blood, were obſerv'd either in the <hi>Arteria Trachaea,</hi> or in the <hi>Bronchia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bhonius,</hi> in the Appendix to his Treatiſe <hi>de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiat. Vuln. Diſſ.</hi> 2. informs us, that in diſſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great many Women drown'd for murdering their Children, he had ſhewn the Spectators, that there was little or no Water in their Lungs and Abdomen; and adds, that in order to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more certain with Reſpect to this Circumſtance, he had, drown'd ſeveral Animals, in whoſe Cavities, tho' drown'd alive, he had never perceiv'd any Water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dethardingius,</hi> at preſent Profeſſor of Medicine in <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> in a Letter wrote when he was Profeſſor at <hi>Roſtoch,</hi> in 1714, gives us an Account of the Diſſection of a Soldier, who attempting to make his Eſcape from a Garriſon, was drown'd in a Ditch, and upon being open'd had in his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach only about a Pint of Beer, which he had drank ſome Time before. The Profeſſor took care previouſly to appriſe the Spectators, that there would not be a ſingle Drop of Water in his Breaſt, which as well as his Abdomen, was very much elevated; and the Event verified the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0279301000:34"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Johannes Conradus Becker,</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>de Submerſ. Mort. Sin. Pot. Aq.</hi> gives us the four following Hiſtories. A Dog, ſays he, being drown'd and lying in the Water for an Hour, his Abdomen, Stomach, and Inteſtines, appear'd tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mified and inflated, tho' a ſingle Drop of Water was not found in them. The Lungs were, alſo, inflated, without containing Water, like thoſe of hang'd Perſons, but immediately collaps'd upon ſuffering the Air to eſcape thro' an Inciſion made in the <hi>Arteria Traehaea.</hi> The Author ſubjoins, that this Obſervation render'd the Doctrine of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients highly ſuſpected by him.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, is the Hiſtory of a Peaſant, taken from the Water, after he had been ſome Weeks in it, and was entirely putrified. After opening his Duodenum, two Ligatures were made on that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine, which was very much inflated, and from the Aperture of which nothing was diſcharg'd, but a Liquor which was Chyle mix'd with Beer, of which the Peaſant had, at a Market, drank ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally, as to intoxicate himſelf. The Tumefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Stomach, laid a Foundation for ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it contain'd a large Quantity of Water, tho' upon laying it open, nothing was found but a Pint of a Liquor, whoſe Smell exactly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that of Beer. The Lungs were ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated, that when an Inciſion was made in the Breaſt, they burſt out; but their Inflation was ſpeedily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated, by making an Aperture in the <hi>Arteria Trachea,</hi> thro' which the Air was diſcharg'd with a conſiderable Noiſe. In cutting the Lungs into Pieces, no extraordinary Signs of Humidity were perceiv'd, nor were any preternatural Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances obſerv'd, except Spots of different Colours.</p>
            <p>The third Hiſtory, is that of a Woman drown'd in a Well, in whoſe Inteſtines nothing but Chyle
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0279301000:35"/>was diſcover'd, neither was there any Water in the Lungs. The Inteſtines collaps'd upon making a ſmall Puncture in them, and an Aperture being made in the Arteria Trachea, the Air eſcap'd thro' it from the Lungs with ſome Noiſe.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt Hiſtory related by <hi>Becker,</hi> is that of a Man who was found ſtanding upright in a Baſon, where he had remain'd under Water for five Days. His Stomach, which was large, was only inflated with Wind, and hardly contain'd ſix Ounces of a whitiſh Liquor. The Lungs being equally inflated, collaps'd upon cutting the Arteria Trachea, from which the Air was diſcharg'd with a conſiderable Noiſe. When he was found, two Spoonfuls of Water were not diſcharg'd from his Mouth. <q>"He was, however, continues <hi>Becker,</hi> every where ſurrounded with Water, but that Element, notwithſtanding the Minuteneſs of its Parts, could not penetrate into the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Trachea and Oeſophagus, in order to fill the Cavities of the Viſcera; an evident Proof that theſe Parts were ſo defended againſt every Thing that made an Attempt to enter them, that the Water itſelf could not force a Paſſage into them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe Obſervations, the celebrated Author concludes, that the Abſence of Water in the Lungs and Inteſtines, is not a Proof that a Perſon has been thrown into the Water after his Death. This Obſervation is of the laſt Importance to thoſe whoſe Buſineſs it is to make Reports before Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, tho' it is contrary to that of <hi>Rodericus à Caſtro,</hi> adopted by many Philologiſts and Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliſts, and among others by <hi>Feltman</hi> in <hi>Tr. de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davero inſpiciendo,</hi> Cap. 21. But as in the Opinion of <hi>Becker,</hi> the Lungs are not inflated in thoſe who are thrown into the Water after Death, ſo we may
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0279301000:36"/>from their Inflation draw a Proof, that the Perſon was alive when drown'd, or put into the Water.</p>
            <p>Since, therefore, it is ſufficiently obvious, both from the Structure of the Parts, and the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the moſt penetrating Anatomiſts, that little or no Water enters the Bodies of drown'd Perſons, ſo 'tis equally obvious, that the Practice of hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Heels, is not only uſeleſs, but muſt alſo contribute to deſtroy thoſe Remains of Life which may poſſibly be loſt; for by ſuch a Suſpenſion, the whole Column of the Blood convey'd to the Heart by the inferior <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> will neceſſarily preſs upon that convey'd by the ſuperior <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> where the Blood being interrupted in its Courſe, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily regurgitate into the jugular Veins, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently into the Head, where, by its Quantity and Weight, it retards the Motion of the Spirits, whoſe free Progreſs is abſolutely neceſſary to reſtore the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Blood, on which Life in a great Meaſure depends.</p>
            <p>As it is of great Importance, to know the Cauſe of the Inflation of drown'd Perſons, ſince it is not produc'd by the Water they ſwallow, ſo the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Dethardingius</hi> accounts for it in the following manner, <q>"Thoſe, ſays he, who die in the Water, are not deſtroy'd for Want of Air, but by means of too large a Quantity of it; they do not die in Expiration, but in Inſpiration; and in a Word, nothing more reſembles each In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, than the Phaenomena obſerv'd in drown'd Perſons; for if we attentively conſider what happens to ourſelves, we perceive that the Breaſt is as it were lengthen'd, the Abdomen elevated, and the Flanks inflated, and that this State ſubſiſts, ſo long as we draw in the Air, or retain it in the Breaſt. Now the ſame Things happen in drown'd Perſons, only with this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0279301000:37"/>that in the latter, the Inſpiration is perform'd with Rapidity and Violence, whereas in the former it is carried on quietly and without any Effort. In Perſons not drown'd, a Depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſucceeds the Elevation; but in drown'd Perſons the Elevation of the Abdomen, and the Elongation of the Breaſt ſubſiſt; by which means, all the Parts continue in a State of Expanſion. This is, no doubt, the Meaning of thoſe, who look upon the Death of drown'd Perſons as a Suffocation, and pretend that the Cauſe of it, and that of ſtrangled Perſons is the ſame; for thoſe two Kinds of Death have a great Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and Analogy, as is ſufficiently obvious from the Elevation of the Abdomen, which in hang'd Perſons ſubſiſts after their Death."</q>
            </p>
            <p>From this Theory 'tis ſufficiently eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Inflation of the Lungs, is the Cauſe of the Death of drown'd Perſons; accordingly <hi>Dethardingius</hi> from the preceding Doctrine draws the following Concluſions; <q>"The Veſicules of the Lungs are inflated by the Air, the Bronchia are lengthen'd, the Blood Veſſels diſtributed thro' the whole Body of the Lungs, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd; and tho' the Elongation of the Bron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia aſſiſts the Entry of the Blood into the large Veſſels, as well thoſe proper to the Lungs, as the bronchial Artery and Vein, as thoſe which are only ſubſervient to the Circulation, as the pulmonary Artery and Vein, yet the Circulation is not carried on equally in the Capillaries; ſince the Preſence of a rarified Air in the Veſicules compreſſes the Blood, and forcing it to ſtop there, hinders it from paſſing into the Left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart, in order to accompliſh the Circulation. Now as ſoon as there is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Retardation in this important Function,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0279301000:38"/>the vital Motions alſo gradually ceaſe, and Death approaches inſenſibly."</q>
            </p>
            <p>After having thus diſcover'd the Reaſon of the Inflation of the Lungs, and of the Death which ſucceeds that Circumſtance, we ſhall, with the ſame Author, inveſtigate the Cauſe which hinders the Diſcharge of the Air from the Lungs and Breaſt. This is by no means a Topic of pure Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, ſince, the Aſſiſtance to be afforded to drown'd Perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can be of no Service, except in ſo far as it is proper to remove thoſe Obſtacles, which oppoſe and hinder the reſpective Actions of the viral Functions. Now <hi>Dethardingius</hi> and <hi>Becker</hi> pretend, that the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> (which is a ſmall Valve plac'd at the external Entrance of the Larynx, in order by its covering the Glottis, to hinder all ſolid or liquid Bodies which may be put into the Mouth, from deſcending into the Canal of Reſpiration) being exactly and ſtrongly applied over the Glottis, proves the Obſtacle to the Diſcharge of the Air from the Lungs. Theſe Authors, alſo, affirm that ſuch a ſtrong and convulſive Application of the Epiglottis over the Glottis, ariſes from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural Extenſion of the Fibres of thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Larinx, which cover the Epiglottis. This preternatural Extenſion they attribute to the violent Inſpiration excited by Fear, in Perſons who run a Riſk of being drown'd. Thus the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <hi>Dethardingius</hi> reaſons in the following Manner: <q>"If in all Kinds of Dread and Terror we obſerve, that Reſpiration is diſorder'd; that is to ſay, that Inſpiration is more quick, and laſts longer; and that, on the contrary, Expiration is intercepted, uncertain, and ſhort, it follows of Courſe, that Inſpiration muſt be much more ſtrong, and the Air attracted in a far larger Quantity, when a Perſon perceives that he is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0279301000:39"/>threatn'd with Death by the Water, which muſt in a Moment fill the Space which ought to be occupied by the Air."</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is pretty ſurpriſing that <hi>Becker</hi> and <hi>Dethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingius</hi> ſhould only reaſon conjecturally in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; ſince the Diſſections they made of drown'd Perſons, might have enabled them by their Eyes to judge of the Diſpoſition of the <hi>Epiglottis</hi> in theſe unfortunate Creatures. But, be this as it will; certain it is that <hi>Dethardingius</hi>'s Method of afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Relief to drown'd Perſons, is highly rational, and promiſes fair for reſtoring them to Life. It conſiſts in four Things; the firſt of which is, to place the Body drawn from the Water in a proper Poſture and Situation. The Second is to compreſs the Abdomen, at the ſame Time that Frictions are making on the Back. The Third is, to excite an Irritation in the Throat; and the Fourth to make an Inciſion in the <hi>Arteria Trachea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Situation of the Perſon taken from the Water, we have already ſhewn Suſpenſion by the Heels to be prejudicial; tho' <hi>Becker</hi> recommends it, becauſe he thinks the Weight of the abdominal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcera may thruſt the Diaphragm into the Breaſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Lungs, and giving a greater Spring to the Air, make it act with ſuch an Effort, as to raiſe the <hi>Epiglottis:</hi> But the judicious <hi>Dethardingius,</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that this Method is ſufficient to deſtroy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration in Perſons alive, abſolutely condemns it, and orders drown'd People to be laid with their Bodies ſo declining, as that the Head may be loweſt. Beſides, as he had obſerv'd that Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is more difficultly perform'd on the Belly, he directs drown'd Perſons to be laid on their Backs, and a ſtrong Compreſſion of the Abdomen to be made, from the Region of the Pubes, as far up as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0279301000:40"/>the Stomach. He adds, that it is expedient, both for the Sake of the Frictions and the Compreſſion, to rub the Hands with ſome Oil, proper to reſtore to the Fibres render'd rigid by the Cold and Spaſms, that Suppleneſs and pliant State, which is neceſſary to them in order to perform the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Reſpiration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pechlinus</hi> obſerves, that in <hi>Sweden</hi> it is cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to uſe Frictions on Perſons taken out of the Water, and externally to apply hot and ſpirituous Remedies in order to reanimate the internal Heat, and more effectually excite the Efferveſcence of the Blood. <hi>Borelli,</hi> in <hi>Hiſt. Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 11. or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Skin to be render'd red by Means of Frictions in a warm Bed. Mr. <hi>Joly,</hi> a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian of <hi>Britany,</hi> in the Obſervations inſerted in the Hiſtorical Journal, for the Month of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 1743, adviſes Frictions before a large Fire with hot Cloths, with a View to reſtore the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Heat as ſoon as poſſible. <hi>Dethardingius</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders theſe Frictions to be made from the Nape of the Neck down to the Buttocks, becauſe, the Heads of the Muſcles ſubſervient to Expiration, are attach'd to the Spine of the Back, and their Tendors to the Ribs; and becauſe, in his Opinion, Friction facilitates the Action of theſe Muſcles, eſpecially when made with Oils, which contribute to reſtore the Plyancy of the Fibres.</p>
            <p>Beſides Frictions before a Fire, with hot Cloths ſoak'd in Oils or ſpirituous Liquors, are beneficial in another Reſpect, becauſe, the Spine of the Back is the Origin of a great Number of Nerves and conſequently of the various Motions perform'd in the Body. This cannot fail to put all the vital Springs in Action; by reſtoring Suppleneſs to the nervous and muſcular Fibres, and Motion to the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0279301000:41"/>flow circulating, or even totally coagulated Juices, This is the Reaſon, why Frictions and Pumping ſo often prove ſucceſsful in Apoplexies.</p>
            <p>We muſt, alſo, obſerve, that <hi>Dethardingius,</hi> approves of laying drown'd Perſons on their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies over a Hogſhead, or round Veſſel, which is to be agitated, not with a View to make them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Water they have ſwallow'd, but to ſhake and compreſs the Abdomen, and thruſt its Contents towards the Diaphragm. But <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> in <hi>Obſervat. Chirurg.</hi> Lib. 6. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 33. <hi>&amp; Obſ.

            <p>
               <hi>Dethardingius</hi> ſeems not to have laid great Streſs upon the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Practice of defending the Bodies of drown'd Perſons from the Contact of the Air, and of conveying them into warm Places. The firſt Step however taken by the <hi>Swedes</hi> is, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Pechlinus,</hi> to wrap ſuch Bodies up in warm Cloths. <hi>Langelotti</hi> alſo, in <hi>Miſcel. Nat. Curioſ. An.</hi> 6. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 20. informs us, that this Method is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them univerſally put in Practice, becauſe they have learn'd from long Experience, that no drown'd Perſon recovers, if he is left long, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the free Air, Mr. <hi>Joly</hi> is, alſo, of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that drown'd Perſons ſhould be left upon the Shore no longer, than is neceſſary to pull off their Cloths, which may be cut off for the Sake of Expedition; <q>"for, continues he, a ſingle Moment
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0279301000:42"/>often determines between a State of Death or Life."</q> In conſequence of this Principle, he adopts the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Practice; <q>"for, <hi>ſays he,</hi> when the drown'd Perſon's Cloths are taken off, he is to be wrapt up in the warmeſt Coverings or Cloths which can be then had. Then he is to be convey'd to the neareſt Houſe, where after Frictions before a warm Fire with hot Cloths, he is to be laid in a very warm Bed. Great Care is to be taken, to apply to his Feet, the Inner-ſides of his Thighs, his Houghs, and his Arm-Pits, Flaggons full of boiling Water, wrapt up in linen Cloths."</q> For the ſame Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we may make uſe of Bricks. I muſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Joly</hi> recedes from the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Practice, in a Circumſtance which to me appears to be of the leaſt Importance; for the <hi>Swedes</hi> do not warm the Bodies of drown'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſuddenly, but by little and little, before a gentle Fire. The Expedience of this may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd by conſidering the Effects of a too intenſe Heat upon Fiſhes found frozen in the Winter Time, which indeed recover for a Moment, and then die irretriveably. <hi>Nymman</hi> and <hi>Ranchin</hi> alſo order'd drown'd Perſons to be laid in warm Places, eſpecially in Winter.</p>
            <p>As in drown'd Perſons, a Defect of reſpirable Air produces a Suffocation, ſo it would be no leſs fooliſh, than barbarous, ſuddenly to expoſe them to the entire Action of the Atmoſphere, ſince that Fluid entering precipitately into the Thorax, would produce, in the pulmonary Veſſels, a Dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which inſtead of promoting the Paſſage of the Blood thro' that Organ, would produce a freſh Obſtruction in it, becauſe the Action of the Heart is not ſtrong enough, to ſurmount the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which the Air makes to the Paſſage of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0279301000:43"/>Blood; and this muſt the more inevitably happen, becauſe the Lungs in ſuch a State collapſe, which is the unavoidable Fate of all Fibres de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of the Influx of the Animal Spirits, which neceſſarily depends on the free Conveyance of the Blood thro' the whole Body, and the Velocity of its circular Motion. The Precaution, therefore, of wrapping Perſons taken from the Water in Blankets, is highly proper, and excellently ſuited not only to this Species of Suffocation, but alſo of all others.</p>
            <p>But it is not ſufficient to guard drown'd Perſons againſt the rude Impreſſions of the Atmoſphere, ſince 'tis alſo requiſite they ſhould only be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the free Uſe of that Fluid by Degrees.</p>
            <p>As the Decreaſe of the Circulation is neceſſarily ſucceeded by a proportionable Diminution of Heat, ſo 'tis juſtly to be expected, that the Bodies of drown'd Perſons have loſt the greateſt Part of that Warmth, which is ſo neceſſary to the Support of Life. Hence 'tis abſolutely requiſite they ſhould be warm'd. But it would be equally pernicious, ſuddenly to expoſe them at once to the Fire, or precipitately to exhibit Medicines, which by the Volatility of their Principles, might produce a Rarefaction of the Blood. 'Tis, therefore, far more ſafe and prudent, to begin with gradually augmented Frictions of the Extremities with warm Cloths, than all at once to expoſe ſuch Perſons to the Fire, or call in the Aſſiſtance of hot and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Medicines, both of which may be ſafely, tho' ſparingly and gradually us'd, when the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo reſtor'd, that their bad Effects are no longer to be fear'd,</p>
            <p>Theſe Precautions are founded on phyſical Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which tho' ſufficiently known to Phyſicians,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0279301000:44"/>may yet afford freſh Pleaſure and Entertainment to Readers of another Claſs.</p>
            <p>The Blood, then, of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> diſcharges itſelf into the right Auricle of the Heart, whoſe Contraction forces it into the right Ventricle, which in its Turn contracting itſelf, propels the Blood into the Pulmonary Artery. That thoſe Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be perform'd, 'tis neceſſary the Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Blood diſcharg'd into the right Auricle, ſhould not over-power its Action; that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractile Force of the right Ventricle ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to propel the Blood in the pulmonary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; and that in this Artery there ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to obſtruct or oppoſe the Diſtribution of the Blood, which ought to be made in it. Now according to this Theory, the Contractions of the right Auricle and Ventricle, are in ſuch Caſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely weakened, ſince theſe Muſcles partake of the Relaxation of the whole Syſtem of the Fibres. The Lungs, alſo, collapſe, and conſequently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the free Circulation of the Blood, or its free Diſtribution thro' themſelves. If, therefore, in affording Aſſiſtance to drown'd Perſons, we ſhould precipitately convey too quick a Motion to the Blood, we ſhould by that very Circumſtance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce invincible Obſtacles to its Circulation, and conſequently make the Means of recalling Life ſubſervient to the Production of irretreivable Death; for the exceſſive Quantity of Blood which enters the right Auricle, will over-power and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the weak Force which reſiſts it. Beſides, tho' this Auricle had contractile Force enough to convey the Blood into the Heart, yet the Action of that Muſcle will not be ſufficient to propel the Blood into the Lungs, or at leaſt to ſurmount the joint Reſiſtance made by the collapſed State of the Lungs, and the Air compreſſing their Blood-Veſſels.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0279301000:45"/>Theſe Methods, therefore, of relieving drown'd Perſons and reſtoring them to Life, are not only founded upon the animal Oeconomy, but are alſo abſolutely neceſſary and indiſpenſible.</p>
            <p>'Tis, however, to be obſerv'd, that when the Circulation begins to be carried on freely, we may, if ſuch Practice is indicated by any preſſing Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, attempt to reduce it to its natural State, by means of Cordials and anti-apoplectic Medicines; tho' theſe, eſpecially the latter, as being moſt powerful, are in the Beginning to be us'd with the utmoſt Caution; and probably the ſafeſt Method is totally to abſtain from the anti-apoplectic Medicines, and to begin with the mildeſt Cordials, whoſe moſt energetic Parts being diluted in a large Quantity of ſome proper Vehicle, may more inſenſibly mix themſelves with the Maſs of Blood, and conſequently produce their Effects more ſlowly. 'Tis, however, to be obſerv'd, that the ſame Danger is not to be dreaded from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Uſe of the moſt efficacious Remedies. Thus, for Inſtance, we need not heſitate to apply Topics to the Temples, the Noſtrils, the Wriſts, the Pit of the Stomach, and all thoſe Parts, where the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries lying near the Surface of the Body, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to their Action and Influence. And as the Membranous Parts are none of the leaſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inſtruments of the ſeveral Motions perform'd in the Body, ſo a very particular Regard ought to be had to them: Frictions, then, of the Hands and Feet, as well as the Application of ſpirituous Medicines to theſe Parts, are extremely beneficial; for tho' the Propriety of this Practice could not be demonſtrated from Anatomy and Phyſiology, yet we might be fully convinc'd of it, by the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Deventer,</hi> who orders Frictions with Bruſhes to be made on the Soles of the Feet of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0279301000:46"/>ſuch new-born Children, as diſcover no Signs of Life, in order to reſtore the Circulation of the Blood, which is the Foundation or firſt Beginning of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deventer</hi> does not, indeed, adviſe the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirituous Medicines to theſe Parts; but as 'tis ſufficiently certain, that theſe, as well as all other Liquors, penetrate the Surface of the Body, and enter the Cavities of the Veſſels, ſo their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Applications muſt neceſſarily produce very happy Effects. Beſides, this Method of uſing ſpirituous Medicines, is of all others the ſafeſt; not only becauſe their Mixture with the Blood is not ſo quick as when they are exhibited internally, but alſo, becauſe, the Parts to which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied are moſt remote from the Center.</p>
            <p>But we now proceed to conſider the other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of affording Relief to drown'd Perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the Smoke of Tobacco, the happy Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of which are prov'd by various Obſervations. Thus Doctor <hi>Mead</hi> in his mechanical Account of Poiſons, after mentioning that many who have been drown'd and dead to all Appearance, have been ſurpriſingly reſtor'd to Life, ſpeaks in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner, from the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences: <q>"This Circumſtance ſhould certainly encourage the Uſe of all Means, upon ſuch Accidents, eſpecially as the Trial is not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult. The firſt Step ſhould be to blow the Smoke of Tobacco up into the Inteſtines, then to warm the Body by ſhaking and rolling about, and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing it with warm Cloths in a Bed. In a Word to put the Blood into Motion all manner of Ways, and not to be diſcourag'd tho' no Signs of Life ſhould be diſcover'd after an Hour or two ſhould be ſpent in this good Work; towards the latter End of which, Spirits and volatile Salts may produce a good Effect. Neither
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0279301000:47"/>ſhould bleeding be omitted when the Blood is become ſufficiently warm to drop out of the Veins."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The happy Effects of the Smoke of Tobacco in reſtoring drown'd Perſons to Life, are farther evinc'd from the following Narration of Dr. <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hier.</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> a profeſs'd Surgeon of <hi>Paris,</hi> being at <hi>Paſſy,</hi> waited in a Boat till the Number it was to take in ſhould be completed. During this Time, he ſaw a Boat croſſing the River, and when it arriv'd at Land, one of the Paſſengers ſtepping aſhore, and miſſing his Wife, aſk'd what was become of her; but no one could give him any Anſwer, except a young Child, who pointing to the River, ſaid, ſhe had hid herſelf in it. This Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had fallen from the Stern of the Boat, without being perceiv'd by any of the Paſſengers, except the Child, who gave Directions to row to the very Part where the Woman fell from the Boat. The Huſband finding her in a Place which was not very deep, but full of Mud, brought her to Land, and laid her out. Whilſt ſome of the Spectators of this melancholy Accident were adviſing to hang her by the Heels, and others ordering different Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to be taken, a Soldier with his Pipe in his Mouth, came to aſk the Reaſon of ſuch a Concourſe of People; upon being inform'd of the Accident, he deſir'd the diſconſolate Huſband to give over weeping, becauſe his Wife would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Life very ſoon. Then giving his Pipe to the Huſband, he bid him introduce the ſmall End of it into the Anus, put a Piece of Paper perforated with a large Number of Holes upon its Mouth, and thro' that blow the Smoke of the Tobacco into her Interſtines, as ſtrongly as he poſſibly could. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly at the fifth Blaſt, a conſiderable rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in the Woman's Abdomen was heard, upon
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0279301000:48"/>which ſhe diſcharg'd ſome Water from her Mouth' and in a Moment after return'd to Life. This Practice, however inſignificant in the Eyes of the Vulgar, is nevertheleſs of the higheſt Importance; for the Irritation of the Inteſtines, excited by the Heat and Acrimony of the Smoke of the Tobacco, produces in the Muſcles ſubſervient to Expiration, ſuch a Reflux of the animal Spirits, as induces a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of them ſufficient to ſurmount that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which the Air contain'd in the Breaſt, found to its Diſcharge. This happy Effect of the Smoke of Tobacco is ſufficiently evinc'd by the preceding Hiſtory, ſince it made the Woman vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit up the Water ſhe had ſwallow'd. Now vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting is excited by a ſtimulating Contraction of the Diaphragm, and of the tranſverſe Muſcle of the Abdomen, which contracting the Stomach, force it to diſcharge its Contents, where the leaſt Reſiſtance is found, and conſequently by its ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Orifice. It is to be obſerv'd, that the ſame happy Effects are produc'd by the Smoke of all acrid Subſtances, ſince Mr. <hi>Joly</hi> affirms, that the ſame End is equally anſwer'd by the Smoke of Sage, and other Plants of a ſimilar Nature. It is alſo highly probable, that Clyſters prepar'd with Coloquintida or Tobacco, would produce Effects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually good; but on ſuch Occaſions, the moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and expeditious Meaſures are always to be taken, ſince a very ſmall Delay may prove of the laſt Conſequence, by deſtroying a Life which might otherwiſe be preſerv'd.</p>
            <p>In Caſes of Emergence, where proper Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not immediately to be procur'd, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Soldier in the preceding Hiſtory, may be follow'd; but it may loſe leſs Time to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Tobacco in the Bole of the Pipe, when lighted, with a ſilk Handkerchief, either ſingle,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0279301000:49"/>or once doubled, than to wait till proper Holes are bor'd in a Piece of Paper, tho' this takes up very little Time. However, that no neceſſary Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be wanted, I have given the Figure of an Inſtrument; contriv'd on purpoſe for impelling the Smoke of Tobacco into the Inteſtines. A. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents a Braſs or Iron Box, capable of containing half an Ounce of the ſtrongeſt Tobacco, which is to be lighted. B. is a common Clyſter Pipe, to be introduc'd into the <hi>Anus,</hi> join'd to the flexible Tube D. D. made of Leather. C. is another Pipe, at which a Perſon blows forcibly, that the Smoke of the Tobacco in the Box A. may be impell'd thro' the flexible Tube D. D. and the Pipe B. into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines. E. repreſents the Smoke. If one Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is not ſufficient, another ſhould be given ſoon after, and repeated till it anſwers.</p>
            <p>Theſe Clyſters of the Fume of Tobacco, are of excellent Uſe in the Iliac Paſſion, and in an incarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Hernia; and no Apothecary or Surgeon ought to be without ſuch an Inſtrument.</p>
            <p>As the olfactory Nerves are of all others the moſt expos'd to the Action of Bodies, and have an intimate Connection with thoſe ſubſervient to the Motion of the Muſcles deſtin'd for Reſpiration, it muſt of courſe be beneficial to irritate the Nerves of the Noſe; ſo that what we call Sternutatories, or ſuch Subſtances as excite Sneezing, produce happy Effects in reſtoring drown'd Perſons to Life: <hi>Indian</hi> Marum or Euphorbium introduc'd into the Noſe, or reduc'd into a Powder and blown up the Noſtrils, will in all Probability produce ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Effects, ſince if they operate they will excite a violent Expiration, ſufficient to remove all thoſe Obſtacles which the Air finds to its free Diſcharge. Mr. <hi>Joly</hi> warmly recommends this Practice, as alſo Injections of ſpirituous Liquors. Thus the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0279301000:50"/>Injection of Spirit of Sal Ammoniac into the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, operates more powerfully than holding vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Sal Ammoniac to them. Perhaps Vinegar will ſtimulate yet more ſtrongly, and with better Effect.</p>
            <p>All thoſe Authors who treat of the Meaſures proper for reſtoring drown'd Perſons to Life, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Vomiting to be excited, in order to procure a Diſcharge of the Water contain'd in the Stomach. This is the Doctrine of <hi>Codronchus, Foreſtus, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarius,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Joly,</hi> who imagines that the Water in the Stomach of drown'd Perſons, is one of the Cauſes of their Death. In order to excite this Vomiting, they order the Throat to be tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the bearded End of a Quill. <hi>Becker</hi> and <hi>Dethardingius</hi> order a Feather to be introduc'd into the Oeſophagus, in order to excite ſuch a Motion of the Epiglottis, as is ſufficient to procure a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Air contain'd in the Breaſt. Now 'tis ſufficiently known to every Body, that the bearded End of a Quill excites Vomiting. We muſt here obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Joly</hi> only orders Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting to be procur'd after drown'd Perſons return to Life. But it is certain, that vomiting can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no happy Effects, if there is nothing in the Stomach, or only a Quantity of Water equal to that daily us'd by moſt People. As for liquid E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metics, their Effects appear to be highly dubious, ſince the Oeſophagus may poſſibly be in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive State, as to hinder Deglutition. <hi>Dethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingius</hi> looks upon this Irritation of the Throat, as a Circumſtance of the higheſt Importance; but for exciting it, prefers a certain Inſtrument invented in <hi>Germany,</hi> and deſcrib'd by <hi>Heiſter</hi> in his Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery.</p>
            <p>According to <hi>Pechlinus,</hi> the <hi>Swedes,</hi> attempt to reſtore the Lives of drown'd Perſons, by Means
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0279301000:51"/>of Fomentations, with anti-apoplectic Medicines; that is, ſuch as are of an hot and ſpirituous Nature. <hi>Borelli</hi> in <hi>Obſ.</hi> 11. <hi>Cent.</hi> 2. informs us, that he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully us'd toaſted Bread ſoak'd in warm Brandy, applied to the Region of the Heart, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renew'd. <hi>Nymman</hi> in <hi>Tr. de Apoplexia. Cap.</hi> 44. orders us to apply to the Noſtrils of drown'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, odoriferous Subſtances, and ſuch as are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of putting the Spirits in Motion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the Action of the Heart, and the Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Brain. Of this Kind are Penny-royal Rue; and Lilly of the Valley, ſoak'd in Vinegar. He, alſo, orders us to apply to the Region of the Heart, Epithems prepar'd of Baum, Rue, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joram, Amber, Cinnamon, and Lavender. Thus for Inſtance;</p>
            <p>Take of the beſt Roſe-Water an Ounce and an half; of Baum-Water two Ounces and an half; of Roſemary-Water one Ounce; of Malmſey Wine one Ounce and an half; of Lemon Juice one Ounce, of the Powder of Cloves one Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; of Theriaca one Dram, and of Camphire and Saffron each half a Dram. Mix all together, and in the Liquor ſoak a Spunge, to be applied to the Region of the Heart.</p>
            <p>As the genital Parts of both Sexes have a near and intimate Correſpondence with the Heart, as is obvious from the Effects of Cordials, applied to thoſe Parts, in Syncopes, Faintings, and other Affections of the Heart, ſo <hi>Nymman,</hi> in order to reſtore drowned Perſons to Life, orders theſe Parts to be fomented with warm Wine, in which Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Cloves, Musk, and Baum have been boiled.</p>
            <p>But if any Succeſs is to be expected from theſe Remedies, it is principally, when by the Aſſiſtance of Frictions, the moſt volatile Parts of Spirituous Liquors are made to penetrate into the Maſs of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0279301000:52"/>Fluids; and it is highly probable, that indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of the Experience of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod will anſwer the End propoſed by <hi>Dethardin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> which is, the procuring of a free Expiration; for, if the Admixture of the ſpirituous. Parts of cordial Liquors reſtores the Courſe of the Spirits and Blood, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that both muſt be more copiouſly conveyed to the Muſcles deſtin'd for the Purpoſes of Expiration.</p>
            <p>It is alſo certain, from Experience, that one of the moſt efficacious Expedients for reſtoring drown'd Perſons to Liſe, is ſpeedy Veneſection, eſpecially in thoſe Parts, moſt proper for relieving the Head, as the Ankles, for Inſtance, and the Jugular Veins. The Uſe of Veneſection, in ſuch Caſes, muſt be ſufficiently obvious to every one who conſiders, that drowned Perſons, as well as thoſe who are hang'd, die of an Apoplexy of the ſanguineous Kind, and not for Want of Reſpiration, or, as is commonly imagined, on Account of a Repletion, or choaking up of the Breaſt by Blood; for when ſuch Perſons are laid open, the Breaſt is found almoſt entirely void of Blood, and the Brain extremely inflamed; both which Phoenomena are highly agreeable to the Laws of the Circulation.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the moſt common and approved Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of reſtoring drown'd Perſons to Life; but, if they ſhould happen to prove ineffectual, the laſt Reſource is, what we commonly call <hi>Bronchotomy,</hi> or <hi>Tracheotomy,</hi> which conſiſts in opening the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea,</hi> in order to procure a free Acceſs of the Air to the Lungs. This Operation is principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to remove the obſtinate Adherence of the Epiglottis to the Orifice of the Glottis; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which Circumſtance, the Air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Lungs is freely diſcharged. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheotomy was indeed originally intended for the Extraction of foreign Bodies from the <hi>Trachea,</hi> or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0279301000:53"/>for the procuring an Acceſs of the Air to the Lungs when the Inflammation of the Muſcles of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynx,</hi> is ſo conſiderable in Quinſeys, as to cloſe up the Aperture of the <hi>Glottis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tracheotomy,</hi> according to <hi>Dethardingius,</hi> has all the Advantages which can be wiſhed for, ſince it affords Relief <hi>ſpeedily, effectually,</hi> and <hi>agreeably: Speedily,</hi> becauſe there is no more expeditious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of procuring a Diſcharge of the Air, which, by its natural Spring, and by the continual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Abdomen, muſt neceſſarily be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated in that Manner. Now the Air cannot eſcape from the Pulmonary Veſicles, without their collap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and expreſſing into the Pulmonary Vein, the Blood which had entered the Pulmonary Artery, which cannot happen, without adding a greater Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of Circulation to the arterial Blood. Now the Blood arriving at the left Auricle, and thence at the left Ventricle, produces a new Contraction of the Heart; upon which the Circulation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed, and Life diſcovers itſelf by manifeſt Signs, eſpecially by Reſpiration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tracheotomy,</hi> alſo, affords Relief without Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, becauſe we are no longer afraid of making an Inciſion in thoſe Cartilages, which the Ancients, in Conſequence of their bony Nature, imagined inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Conſolidation. We no longer dread the Hemorrhage, ſince only a few Drops of Blood are diſcharged in opening the Membrane, which unites the Ringlets of the <hi>Arteria Trachea;</hi> and ſince there are not contiguous to the Part, ſuch large Blood Veſſels, as being wounded would produce terrible Effects. There is no Danger of injuring the Voice by means of this Operation, ſince the Operator cannot hurt the Muſcles of the Larynx; and ſince there are no Nerves, the Dilaceration of which ſhould impair or deſtroy the Senſation of the Part.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0279301000:54"/>In a Word, it is no difficult Task to heal up, and conſolidate the Wound, for this is readily effected by means of a Plaiſter, or ſome balſamic Ointment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Tracheotomy</hi> affords Relief <hi>agreeably,</hi> for it cannot poſſibly be painful to a drowned Perſon, whoſe Senſes are ſo locked up, as to render him incapable of feeling Pain. Thus the Operation is performed, without being intercepted by the Cries, the Groans, and Motions, which Pain would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paulus Aegincta</hi> is the firſt Author extant, who deſcrib'd the Operation of <hi>Broncotomy,</hi> from <hi>Antyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> But the judicious and accurate <hi>Heiſter,</hi> in his Surgery, deſcribes this Operation very diſtinctly. The Words <hi>Bronchotomy,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Laryngotomy,</hi> and <hi>Tracheotomy,</hi> are convertible Terms, and mean no more than an Inciſion of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> or what we commonly call the <hi>Wind-Pipe:</hi> and indeed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cauſes and Circumſtances concur, to render this Operation abſolutely neceſſary on ſome Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; for, in the firſt Place, it becomes princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally and indiſpenſably ſo, when in a Quinſey, the Fauces are ſo terribly inflamed, that the Patient is in imminent Danger of having his Reſpiration quite ſtopt, and a total Suffocation brought on. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It becomes neceſſary, when a Bean, a Prune, a Cherry-ſtone, a Pea, or any other extraneous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance falls into the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> and ſeems to threaten a Suffocation. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Aſpera Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> is alſo to be opened, in ſuch Perſons, as have been ſuffocated, in Conſequence of their being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd in Water, or as we commonly expreſs it, in newly drowned People; for Reſpiration has been often reſtored to Perſons in this Condition, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> and by that means procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a free Acceſs of the Air to the Lungs. I am ſufficiently appriz'd, that a great many forbid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0279301000:55"/>an Inciſion in the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently condemn this Operation; becauſe they think it productive of Death, and are therefore prompted by an idle Zeal, to brand the Phyſicians, who approve an Operation, ſo dangerous in their Eyes, with the odious Appellations of barbarous and inhuman. But the Gentlemen, who are of this narrow and confined Way of Thinking, are groſsly miſtaken; for in this Operation, the ſmall Inciſion made in the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> is ſo far from killing the Patient, that it does not produce that Effect when made conſiderably large; and <hi>Garen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geot</hi> gives Examples of various Cures performed by this Operation; ſo that we think ourſelves autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd with <hi>Caſſerius, in Tr. de Vocis, Audituſ<expan>
                     <am>

                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> to pronounce thoſe Men unskilful, timorous, and even cruel, who in the Caſes now mentioned, fooliſhly neglecting this Operation, which is not only ſafe, but alſo attended with the moſt ſpeedy and ſalutary Effects, ſuffer the Patients to die for Want of this ſeaſonable Aſſiſtance. Inſtances of this Nature may be ſeen in <hi>Nicolai Fontani Obſervat. Rarior. Analect.</hi> and in <hi>Caſſerius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Bronchotomy</hi> is to be perform'd, that Part of the <hi>Trachea</hi> ſeems moſt proper for making the Aperture in, which is ſituated between its ſecond and third cartilaginous <hi>Annuli,</hi> or Ringlets. The Inciſion, may, however, be made a little lower, without any Danger. The Method of performing the Operation, eſpecially when a foreign Subſtance falling into the Aſpera Arteria, and threatning a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation is to be extracted, is thus. The Patient is firſt of all to be ſituated in a reclining Poſture, either in Bed, or in ſome convenient Chair, and his Head is to be held firm by an Aſſiſtant ſtanding behind his Back. Then a longitudinal Inciſion is to be made, thro' the Skin, Fat, and Muſcles,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0279301000:56"/>from about two Fingers Breadth below the <hi>Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lago Thyroides,</hi> or Seutiformis, or the <hi>Pomum Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi> in the middle of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> down to the very Sternum, ſo that the Length of the Inciſion may be two, three, and in tall Patients, four Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Breadth in Length.</p>
            <p>Then an Aſſiſtant is carefally to draw the Lips of this Orifice from each other, either with proper Hooks, or with his Fingers; and having abſorb'd and wip'd away the Blood, either by a Spunge or Linnen Cloth, ſo that the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> may be ſeen, three or four of the Annuli or Ringlets of that ſpiral Pipe, are to be cut in ſuch a Manner, that the Inciſions made in the Whole, may form one continued Line, and thus whatever Subſtance may have ſlipt into it, is to be artfully and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly extracted, either by a Probe, Hook, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps. This being done, the Wound is to be cleans'd, with a Spunge, and its Lips being kept in Contact by adheſive Plaiſters, a proper Compreſs and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage are to be applied. It is afterwards to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully agglutinated, by means of vulnerary Balſams, as in other Wounds of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria.</hi> By this very Method, continues <hi>Heiſter,</hi> I myſelf in <hi>Helm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadt,</hi> happily extracted a Piece of boil'd Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room from a Patient, who happening to laugh while he was ſupping Broth, in which among other Things there were Muſhrooms, had the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to have a Piece of one of them ſlip into his <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> by which means he was in Danger of being ſuffocated. <hi>Ravius,</hi> continues <hi>Heiſter,</hi> alſo inform'd me, that by this very Method, he happily extracted a Bean from the Throat of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. Some in order to induce a more ſpeedy and ſeemly Cicatrix on the Wound recommend Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination by Suture as in the Hare Lip. But 'tis certainly abſurd to follow a Practice attended
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0279301000:57"/>with ſo much Pain to the Patient, whilſt Methods equally good, and at the ſame Time far milder may be purſu'd.</p>
            <p>But in all Caſes where a Suffocation is either dreaded, or actually preſent, <hi>Tracheotomy</hi> is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, and may be perform'd in three different Manners. In the firſt of theſe the Patient is to be plac'd in a Bed or Chair, with his Head reclin'd at the Operator's Diſcretion, and held firm by an Aſſiſtant, as before directed. Then let the Surgeon make an Inciſion in that middle Part of the Throat, and in the ſame Manner as before or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, till he reaches the <hi>Trachea</hi> itſelf, if he thinks proper; the Skin on both Sides is to be laid hold of by the Aſſiſtant; then it may be rais'd and cut longitudinally. After theſe Meaſures are taken, the Fat and Muſcles lying above the <hi>Trachea</hi> are to be cut. Some would have theſe Muſcles firſt diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd from the <hi>Trachea,</hi> or cautiouſly ſeparated from the others; but there is no Occaſion for all this Labour, ſince they may be cut ſafely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Danger. Then the Operator is to cleanſe the Wound with a Spunge wrung out of warm Wine, or warm Spirit of Wine for ſtopping the Blood more effectually. The Aſſiſtant is, in the mean Time to ſeparate and retract the Lips, either by Hooks, or by his Fingers. Then the Surgeon is to paſs his Knife between two of the Annuli of <hi>Trachea,</hi> or he may even paſs it in ſuch a Manner as to cut one of them, ſince by that means a ſilver or leaden Pipe either round or flat, furniſh'd with <hi>Anſae,</hi> or a Rim, ſo as to prevent its falling into the <hi>Trachea,</hi> may be conveniently inſerted into the Wound. But before the Surgeon withdraws his Knife, ſome proper Probe ought to be inſerted in the Wound, by the Side of the Knife, that by its Aſſiſtance a Pipe may be more commodiouſly and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0279301000:58"/>put into it. This Pipe is fix'd in the Wound by means of a Ligature paſs'd thro' its Annuli or ſmall Holes in the Rim, and carried round the Neck, as alſo by means of a perforated adheſive Plaiſter: But great Care is to be taken that the End of the Pipe which is inſerted into the Wound be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to touch the poſterior Part of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> leſt by this means a troubleſome Cough ſhould be excited. But that the Lungs may not be injur'd by external Cold, or any Filth falling upon them, it is highly proper, to lay upon the Pipe, a Spunge, often impregnated with warm Wine, and again wrung out; or as <hi>Garengeot</hi> adviſes, a thin Linnen Cloth, and afterwards a perforated Plaiſter. Theſe Directions being duly obſerv'd, Blood is to be taken either from the Veins of the Neck or Feet, thoſe under the Tongue, or thoſe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in the Neck. When Reſpiration is totally reſtor'd, which is moſt quickly diſcover'd by ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up the Pipe with one Finger, the Pipe is to be taken out, and the Wound agglutinated in the Manner above directed. But when the Difficulty of Breathing at the Mouth is conſiderable, the Pipe is to be left for ſome Time longer in the Wound, and the other Medicines continued.</p>
            <p>Another and more expeditious Method of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Trachea,</hi> is this, a two edged Knife is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the abovemention'd Part of the Throat, and cautiouſly paſs'd thro' the Skin, Fat, and Muſcles, into the Cavity of the <hi>Trachea</hi> itſelf, and a Pipe is forthwith inſerted into the Wound, and carefully ſecur'd in the Manner before directed. This Manner of Operation is not only quicker, but alſo produces a ſmaller Cicatrix than the former.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt Method of performing this Operation is, with an Inſtrument call'd a <hi>Trocar,</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0279301000:59"/>in tapping for the Dropſy, which no Surgeon ought to be without. This Inſtrument applied to the Middle of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> may, as it were, at one Thruſt be paſs'd thro' the Skin, Fat, and Muſcles, into its very Cavity. Then taking out the perforating Part, let the Pipe remain in the Orifice till the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient recovers. This Method of Operation, ſeems in one Reſpect, to have the Advantage of all the reſt, which is, that it is ſoon over, and the Pipe at the ſame Time introduc'd into the Wound with far leſs Pain to the Patient, than by any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: But even in this Caſe the ſame Caution ought to be us'd, and the ſame Directions follow'd, which we have above ſpecified.</p>
            <p>If Perſons drown'd, continues <hi>Heiſter,</hi> are but juſt dead, their <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> is to be open'd with all Expedition, either with an Inciſion-knife, or any other Inſtrument the Surgeon ſhall judge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Then it is expedient ſtrongly to blow into the Orifice, either with the naked Mouth, or by Means of a common Pipe, the Shank of which is to be introduc'd into the Wound, whilſt the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant blows into the Bole. The learned <hi>Dethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingius,</hi> in a Diſſertation on this very Subject, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that by this Method, if ſpeedily put in Execution, Life returns to the ſuffocated Patients, with the injected Air, and that he is in a Manner miraculouſly rais'd from the Dead. For this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Operation ſhould in ſuch Caſes be perform'd with the greateſt Haſte and Expedition imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Sharp</hi> our Countryman, in his Surgery, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us that this Operation is abſolutely void of all Danger, and deſcribes it in the following Manner.</p>
            <p>Bronchotomy is perform'd, by making a longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinal Inciſion thro' the Skin, three Quarters of an Inch long, between the third and fourth Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0279301000:60"/>of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> when the Operator has his own Choice of the Place; it is always advis'd to pinch up the Skin in this Operation, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be left to the Diſcretion of the Surgeon, who when the Skin is cut thro', muſt make a ſmall tranſverſe Inciſion into the Wind Pipe, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately introduce a crooked <hi>Canula,</hi> near half an Inch long, of Silver or Lead, with a Couple of little Rings at the Top of it, thro' which a Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band may be paſs'd round the Neck, to keep it fix'd in the Wound.</p>
            <p>Some have preſcrib'd making an Inciſion thro' the Skin and Trachea at once, with a Lancet or Knife as the more eaſy and expeditious Manner, and ſays the Author, I once ſaw it perform'd in this Way, but it prov'd very inconvenient; for the Wind-pipe, in Reſpiration moving up and down, ſlipp'd from the Orifice of the Skin, and made it very difficult to introduce the Canula, and afterwards maintain it in its Situation. Wherefore I think it abſolutely neceſſary to make an external Inciſion longitudinal, and even pretty large, as I have directed above.</p>
            <p>The Caution of raiſing the Sternohyoidei and Sternothyroidei Muſcles before opening the Wind-pipe is not to be regarded; and as to the Diviſion of the recurrent Nerves, and large Blood Veſſels, ſo much dreaded in this Operation 'tis not in the leaſt to be fear'd, ſince they are quite out of the Reach of the Inſtrument, as any Perſon ſkill'd in the Anatomy of theſe Parts, muſt very well know.</p>
            <p>The Method of dreſſing is eaſily underſtood; ſince after the Patient can breath by the natural Paſſage, if we withdraw the Pipe, the Wound becomes a ſimple one, and notwithſtanding its Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration thro' a Cartilage, into a large Cavity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires only a ſuperficial Application.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0279301000:61"/>
            <p>Upon the Whole it appears beyond all Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that <hi>Bronchotomy</hi> is a ſafe Operation, and has been ſo often perform'd with Succeſs, that no Surgeon has any Reaſon to heſitate in performing it, in Caſes where particular Circumſtances indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate its Propriety. For this Reaſon 'tis ſufficiently obvious, that this Operation ought with all Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be perform'd on drown'd Perſons, many of whom have been happily reſtor'd to Life by this very Means. It is carefully to be obſerv'd, that this Expedient, is far more efficacious than blowing into a Perſon's Mouth, as is confirm'd by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Experiment made by <hi>Becker.</hi> This Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician hang'd a Dog, till no more Motion of his Heart was perceiv'd, and having left him dead on the Ground for half a Quarter of an Hour, he to no Purpoſe blow'd Air into his Throat. Then he perform'd the Operation of <hi>Bronchotomy,</hi> and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thrice blown the Air into his Lungs, the Breaſt of the Dog began to elevate itſelf, and at the fifth Blaſt, he mov'd his Feet. After this he was blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Throat to give Vent to the Blood, and at laſt gave ſome howling Barks, but ſurviv'd the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident for ſeveral Years. Now as the Cauſe of Death is the ſame in drown'd as in hang'd Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, why ſhould not the ſame Means reſtore them both to Life.</p>
            <p>I have been very particular with reſpect to the Operation of <hi>Bronchotomy,</hi> becauſe it is of great Importance, and of ſingular Uſe in more Caſes than one; and that no one might be ignorant of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of performing it. In the Caſe before us, that of drown'd Perſons, it may frequently be neceſſary where no Surgeon is to be procur'd ſoon enough to retrieve the Misfortune and preſerve Life. In this Situation, as there is no great Danger of injuring a Perſon, who appears to be dead, and muſt be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0279301000:62"/>abſolutely ſo without immediate Relief, any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Perſon, tho not bred a Surgeon, may by theſe Directions, be enabled to perform the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by making a Perforation in the Place above directed, with any Sharp pointed Knife. Then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Canula or Tube of Metal, if that is not at hand, a Tobacco Pipe may be broken about three Quarters of an Inch, or an Inch, from the Bole, and the Part contiguous to the Bole may be introduc'd into the Perforation, taking Care not to break it within the <hi>Trachea;</hi> and then by blowing into the Bole, the Lungs may be inflated.</p>
            <p>After having thus collected every Thing of any Importance upon the preſent Subject, we muſt beg Leave to obſerve, that, tho' with Reſpect to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion and Conſcience, it is not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely abſurd, but alſo highly cruel and barbarous to invoke the Aſſiſtance and Interpoſition of the ſecular Power. Yet in the preſent Caſe, ſuch an Attempt is ſo far from being either abſurd or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, that it beſpeaks Compaſſion and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for we may ſafely appeal to Experience how many worthy Members of Society, generous Friends, affectionate Huſbands, tender Parents, and dutiful Children, have in foreign Countries been reſtor'd to Life by theſe very Means; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in <hi>England,</hi> Perſons of equal Worth, have for Want of proper Care, been laid in their Graves, at a Time when they might, for many future Years have prov'd the common Bleſſings of the various Communities of which they were Members.</p>
            <p>This melancholy and deplorable Conſideration, will ſufficiently authoriſe me to propoſe a Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Legiſlature of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Aim ſeems ultimately to terminate in the greateſt and moſt extenſive Happineſs of the Subject. It
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0279301000:63"/>is, that this Treatment of Perſons ſupposd to be drown'd, may be enforc'd by all the Authority of the Law; and that no one may be ſuffer'd to be buried without it; and this under ſevere Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for otherwiſe I am afraid theſe Endeavours of mine, however well intended, will not have the deſir'd Effect, nor be attended, to ſo much as the Subject deſerves.</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX. Concerning the Methods of reſtoring hang'd Perſons to Life, and Children ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be born dead.</head>
            <p>AS <hi>England</hi> is above all other Nations in the World, juſtly branded with <hi>Suicide,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known by the Name of Self-murder, and as our Countrymen frequently make Choice of a Rope for that Purpoſe, we ſhall briefly point out the Methods of reſtoring hang'd Perſons to Life.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain then, that hang'd Perſons die of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexy of the ſanguineous Kind, produc'd by an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Blood, by the Rope, in the jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Veins, whilſt the Arteries being freer from this Compreſſion, continue to convey the Blood to the Brain. We may form a Judgment of the Effects produc'd by a Compreſſion of the jugular Veins, from the following Paſſage of <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Alexander Benedictus</hi> in <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 33.</bibl> "When, ſays that judicious Author, a Redundance of Blood obſtructs the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0279301000:64"/>arterial and venous Canals, and intercepts the free Circulation of the Spirits, the Patient falls down in the ſame Condition as if he was, hang'd. The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſometimes put ſound Perſons into a ſimilar State, when for Inſtance they intended to circumciſe Adults or Children. Thus having laid them on their Backs in a Bath, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd their jugular Veins, ſo as ſpeedily to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Privation both of Motion and Senſation; and taking the Advantage of this Circumſtance, cut off the Prepuce with as much Eaſe as if the Patient was in an Apoplexy. The ſame is the Condition of thoſe who having attempted to hang themſelves, are found ſuffocated, tho their Feet touch the Ground."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nymman,</hi> alſo, in <hi>Tr. de Apoplexia, cap.</hi> 14. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his Sentiments on this Subject in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Manner. <q>"The Functions of the Brain, ſays he, are deſtroy'd without any Leſion of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits and Nerves, as appears in a Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope. The like happens to hang'd Perſons, who are no ſooner hung up, provided an expert Executioner exactly brace up the Veſſels of the Neck, with the Rope, than they become immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as a Log of Wood, without even ſo much as moving their Feet, notwithſtanding which Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena, the Brain and Origin of the Nerves ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer nothing in ſuch Perſons; ſince thoſe Parts are defended by the Cranium and Vertebrae, which can never be injur'd by the Rope. Nor is the Interception of Reſpiration to be accus'd as the Cauſe of Death in hang'd Perſons, ſince tho we cloſely ſhut up the Mouth and Noſtrils of an Animal ſo as to hinder the Acceſs of Air into the Breaſt, yet as the Brain ſtill retains its vital Spirit, it powerfully oppoſes the imminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a Suffocation, by a violent Agitation of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0279301000:65"/>the Body, and an exceſſive Motion of the Feet, which Circumſtances are never obſerv'd in hang'd Perſon."</q>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe Authorities we evidently ſee the ſpeedy Effects produc'd by the Compreſſion of the jugular Veins. This Doctrine is farther illuſtrated by <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Bartholine</hi> in <hi>Cent,</hi> 1. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 32,</bibl> "In diſſecting, ſays this Author, a Man of a tall Stature, of a ſanguine Temperament, and vigorous Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who was hang'd for a Robbery, I found his Lungs preternaturally large, blewiſh, ſtreak'd with different Colours, light and ſpungious, and ſo full of a frothy Blood, that every where on the Membrane which covers them, the Veins not only appear'd turgid, but the Lobes were alſo ſo large as to embarraſs me in diſſecting the Heart. The Ventricules of the Brain were full of Water, as alſo the Origin of the Nerves which enter the Spine. The <hi>Plexus Choroides,</hi> alſo, beſides the Inflation of its Veſſels, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a great many Veſicules."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Loſs of Knowledge in hang'd Perſons, alſo, proves the Truth of this Doctrine, and this Loſs is ſufficiently atteſted by <hi>Camerarius</hi> in <hi>Cent.</hi> 7. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 40. where we are told, that a Robber being hangd and falling into the Hands of the Surgeons for Diſſection, was nevertheleſs reſtor'd to Life, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Mouth was full of Froth, which is generally look'd upon as an infallible Sign of irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trievable Death, eſpecially where it continues long, as it did in the preſent Caſe, and notwithſtanding he had before his Execution been ſeiz'd with a Fit of Madneſs. When this Man, however, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to Life, he ſaid he rememberd nothing of what had paſs'd on that Occaſion, except that he was conducted to the criminal Chamber, after which he was inſenſible of every Thing. This
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0279301000:66"/>Robber was hang'd a ſecond Time for committing freſh Robberies, a convincing Proof, that he did not look upon the firſt as a formidable Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Camerarius</hi> in <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 38. mentions another, who was twice hang'd; and in <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 39. another who was reſtor'd to Life by the Phyſicians of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> after he had been hang'd.</p>
            <p>Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> in his Hiſtory of Life and Death, relates an Accident, which like that of <hi>Camerarius,</hi> proves the Loſs of Knowledge in hang'd Perſons. A young Gentleman of ſome Diſtinction, curious to know the Pain ſuffer'd by hang'd Perſons, having fix'd a Rope about his Neck, threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from a low Stool upon which he imagin'd he could eaſily put his Feet again: But his Attempts of this Kind were in vain, and he had been irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trievably ſuffocated, without the Aſſiſtance of a Friend who had the Curioſity to be preſent at ſuch an unaccountable Experiment. Upon his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, his Friend aſking him if he had felt any Pain; he anſwer'd that he had perceiv'd none in any Part of his Body; but added, that at firſt he obſerv'd before his Eyes, a Species of Fire or blaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Light; then an extreme Darkneſs, and laſt of all a pale Blue, or a Sea-green, like that which frequently preſents itſelf before the Eyes of thoſe who fall into Deliquiums. Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſubjoins, that he heard a Phyſician of Candour and Worth, aſſert, that he had reſtor'd Life to a Man who had been hang'd half an Hour, affirming at the ſame Time, that by proper Means the ſame Effect might be produc'd upon others, who had hung no longer, provided the Effort of their firſt Fall had not lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the Vertebrae of their Necks.</p>
            <p>After having thus diſcover'd the Cauſe of Death in hang'd Perſons, we are the better able to form
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0279301000:67"/>an Eſtimate of the Means moſt proper to reſtore them to Life.</p>
            <p>Frictions then, and hot Baths, by reſtoring the Motion of the Blood, and reſolving its Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt for theſe very Reaſons produce happy Effects on hang'd Perſons. <hi>Pechlinus</hi> in <hi>Tr. de Aer. &amp; Aliment. Defect. cap.</hi> 7. relates an Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſufficiently evinces the Efficacy of Sal Ammoniac on ſimilar Occaſions. <q>"I knew, ſays he, a Woman hang'd, who after ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd for ſome Time without Pulſe and Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, with her Lips cover'd with Froth, which is look'd upon as an infallible Sign of the total Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Life, and in a Word, after ſhe appear'd to be the neceſſary Victim of Death, was yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to Life, by a Phyſician who coming acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally to the Place where ſhe lay, made her ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a conſiderable Quantity of the Spirit of Sal Ammoniac."</q> As the Activity of this acrid vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Liquor, and its Propriety to reſolve coagulated Blood are ſufficiently known; it is by no means ſurpriſing, that it ſhould on ſimilar Occaſions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch happy Effects. <q>"<hi>Pechlinus</hi> ſubjoins, I don't in the leaſt doubt, but if proper Meaſures were taken in due Time, a great many hang'd Perſons might be reſtor'd to Life, even after thoſe who have an Opportunity of ſeeing them, think they have all the Reaſon in the World, to conclude them really and irretrievably dead. This Effect is moſt commodiouſly produc'd by reſtoring the Circulation of their Blood, by means of Frictions, Veneſections, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of hot and ſpirituous Remedies, or of ſome other analogous Subſtances."</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſufficiently eaſy from what we have before ſaid, to conceive, how Veneſection is excellently calculated for reſtoring Life to hang'd Perſons,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0279301000:68"/>and as for ſpirituous Liquors, they act at once on the Blood and Veſſels, By attenuating the former, and reſtoring the proper Spring and Tone of the latter. The Remedies of this Kind are before ſpecify'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Schenkius</hi> in <hi>Obſervat. Art. de Suffocat. ex Laquea,</hi> orders that drown'd Perſons ſhould be made to ſwallow Vinegar and Pepper; or Oxymel mix'd with the Powder of Penny-royal. He, alſo, adviſes to excite a Vomiting by means of a Feather dipt in Oil, and to wrap up the Patient's Neck in a Woollen Cloth dipt in warm Oil, eſpecially the Oil of Orris.</p>
            <p>The Virtues of Oxymel, or of ſimple Vinegar with Pepper, are ſufficiently evinc'd by <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus de Vega Art. Med. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. All Phyſicians are ſufficiently appriz'd, that Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar moderately us'd, is a powerful Reſolvent, whilſt Pepper is an acrid Subſtance, equally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to diſſolve the Coagulations of the Juices, and reanimate the Fibres, by the Irritation it produces in them. The Powder of Penny-royal is, alſo, an acrid Aromatic, whoſe Effect muſt of courſe be nearly the ſame with that of Pepper.</p>
            <p>As for exciting a Vomiting in hang'd Perſons, I think it more dangerous than in thoſe who are drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the Contractions of the Muſcles ſubſervient to Expiration, may ſerve to reſtore that Function as we have already obſerv'd, ſince the Inflation of the Abdomen and Breaſt of hang'd Perſons, is a Proof that their Inſpiration is forc'd and unnatural, yet in ſuch Circumſtances it ſeems dangerous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey a greater Quantity of Blood to the Head which is before overchargd with it, as is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obvious, not only from the preceding Hiſtories, but alſo from the livid Colour of the Countenance. It is, however, certain, that the Shocks given to the Parts by means of the Vomiting, are very
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0279301000:69"/>proper to diſſolve the Coagulations of the Blood, though I would never adviſe the Uſe of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, till after a previous Venefection.</p>
            <p>The Topic mentioned above, which <hi>Schenkius</hi> orders to be applied to the Neck, may produce very happy Effects, by reſolving the Blood col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the Skin and Muſcles of the Neck, and relaxing the Parts which had ſuffered moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by the Rope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Geſner,</hi> for a Girl who hang'd herſelf, ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ordered Powder of Caſtor, which he forc'd down in warm Broth. This Remedy is alſo of a volatile and reſolvent Nature. <hi>Joubert. in Lib.</hi> 4, <hi>it Effect. Thor. Cap.</hi> 1. informs us, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored many hang'd Perſons to Life, without ſuch a Multiplicity of Expedients; ſince he uſed no other Method than Veneſection, and forcing into their Stomachs a due Quantity of good Wine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ranchinus in Tr. de Morb. ſubit. Cap.</hi> 12. orders Oil of Orris, or of Lillies, to be applied to the Necks of hang'd Perſons, whilſt their Mouths are to be gargariz'd with Syrup of Violets, diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in warm Water, or Barley-water. He alſo preſcribes Vomiting, excited by a Feather, in order to enlarge the Paſſages more. The ſame Author alſo recommends Pepper and Penny-royal, either in Vinegar, Oxymel, Wine, or the <hi>Aqua Caeleſtis.</hi> But Veneſection is the Expedient on which he depends moſt for happy Effects. The Oils and the Syrup are only intended to procure a Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as for the Gargariſm, it cannot be usd till the hang'd Perſon is previouſly reſtored to Life. The Pepper, Penny-royal, and other Subſtances mentioned by him, are deſign'd to re-animate and reſtore the natural Heat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aelius in Tetrabibl. Serm.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 49. orders us to add to the Pepper and Vinegar, Nettle-ſeeds, which are alſo of an highly acrid Nature. The ſame
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0279301000:70"/>Author affirms, that when the Redneſs round the Neck of hang'd Perſons is diſſipated, they open their Eyes, and the Parts are relaxed. He is alſo of Opinion, that we ought not to ſpare Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Neck, with warm Oils, Cerate, or Woollen Cloths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ranchinus,</hi> from other Authors, greatly extols a Remedy which moſt People will think as ſingular in itſelf as diſagreeable to the Perſon who adminiſters it. It conſiſts of blowing into the Mouth of hang'd Perſons, provided the Adminiſtrator has in his own Mouth, a bruis'd Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Cloves, or Carraway-ſeeds. As it is certain, that theſe Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics produce no other Effect, than impregnating the Air with ſome volatile Parts, proper to reſtore the Motion of the Fluids, ſo 'tis equally certain, that the principal Efficacy of this Practice depends upon the <hi>Blowing,</hi> which in this Caſe muſt infallibly produce Salutary Effects; as is obvious from the following Experiments, recorded in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 28. of the Philoſophical Tranſactions of the Royal ſociety of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt then,</hi> Doctor <hi>Croon,</hi> Profeſſor of <hi>Greſham-College,</hi> in the Preſence of the Royal Society, ſtrangled a Pullet, in ſuch a Manner, as that it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered no more Signs of Life; but by afterwards blowing into the <hi>Arteria Trachea,</hi> he ſo effectually reſtored the Motion of the Lungs, that the Pullet returned to Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Doctor <hi>Walter Needham,</hi> in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> and other <hi>Literati,</hi> hang'd a Dog, till the Motion of his Heart was no longer to be perceived, after which he open'd the Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Dog, and blowing into the Thoracic Duct, reſtored the Motion of the Blood, upon which the Heart began to beat, and the Dog re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Life.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0279301000:71"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Doctor <hi>Hook,</hi> in the Preſence of the Royal Society, cut the Ribs, the Diaphragm, and Pericardium of a Dog, after which, making an Inciſion in the ſuperior Part of the Trachea, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into it the Pipe of a Pair of Bellows; then he blow'd the Air into the Lungs, and the Dog returned to Life; but died when he ceaſed to blow: By which Expedient he made him live and die alternately, as long as the Company pleas'd.</p>
            <p>A <hi>fourth</hi> Experiment is that of <hi>Becker,</hi> by which he reſtored a hang'd Dog to Life, by opening his Larynx, and blowing the Air into his Lungs, through the Inciſion made; ſo that the Practice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by <hi>Ranchinus,</hi> is by no Means to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, the firſt and fourth Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are abſolutely the ſame with the Practice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by that Author. Now, Why may not that which has ſucceeded twice, ſucceed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener? Though the other Experiments doe not ſo directly prove the ſame Truth, yet it may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily deduc'd from them; for from the ſecond it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the Air is not only neceſſary to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, becauſe by dilating the Lungs it gives a free Paſſage to the Blood, from one Ventricle of the Heart to the other, but alſo is requiſite to keep the Blood in ſuch a State of Solution, as Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requires. Now, by blowing Air into the Lungs, we inflate their Veſicles, which is the firſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage produced by Reſpiration; and the Air by this Means inſinuating itſelf into the Blood, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves its Coagulation. By means of this Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, 'tis eaſy to comprehend how Doctor <hi>Hook</hi>'s Experiment favours the Doctrine of <hi>Ranchinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, we may therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, Firſt, that blowing in the Mouths of hang'd Perſons is a proper Method of reſtoring them to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0279301000:72"/>Life; Secondly, That if this Method does not ſucceed, we are to perform the Operation of <hi>Bron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chotomy,</hi> and by that Means blow Air into their Lungs: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That we ought not to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at ſome fruitleſs Attempts, becauſe a Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which with <hi>Becker,</hi> did not ſucceed till the fifth Time, may perhaps, in other Circumſtances, not ſucceed till later: Fourthly, That we muſt not at the ſame Time, neglect theſe other Means, which have a Tendency to reſtore the loſt Fluidity of the Blood: Fifthly, That if Death does not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed Strangulation, this is rather the Effect of the Stiffneſs of the Cartilages which compoſe the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynx, or according to ſome, of the Slackneſs of the Rope, than of the eaſy Diſpoſition of the Blood to reſume its Fluidity: Sixthly, That it is highly probable, that an efficacious Method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring drown'd Perſons to Life, would be, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Air into the Blood, by introducing a ſmall Pipe into ſome of the larger Veins, for that Purpoſe; For what Difference is there between making the Air enter the Blood by the Thoracic Duct, or by any other Part. The only Caution which I think ought to be given, is, to make choice of thoſe Veins moſt contiguous to the Heart; ſo that for this very Reaſon, as well as for their Largeneſs, and the Facility of finding them, I judge the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Jugulars moſt proper for this Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Having already obſerved, that as the Cauſe of Death is the ſame in hang'd and drown'd Perſons, ſo the Meaſures taken for the Relief of the one, may be alſo uſed for reſtoring the Lives of the others, We proceed to give ſome Hiſtories of Facts, which prove the Poſſibility of reſtoring ſuffocated People to Life.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Falconet</hi> then, a Gentleman of ſtrict Probity and Candour, told Dr. <hi>Bruhier,</hi> That his Father
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0279301000:73"/>had a fool-hardy Coachman, who falling into a Quarrel at <hi>Lyons,</hi> killed a Man, and being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended on the Spot, was forthwith condemn'd to be hang'd, which Sentence was accordingly put in Execution. The Surgeons of the Town having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Body, in order to make a Skeleton, brought it into a Surgery, where they left it upon a Table; but when they came next Day to diſſect it, they were ſurprized to find the Man not only alive, but in good Health, and piſſing in the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for want, as he ſaid, of a Chamber-pot.</p>
            <p>This Man had ſtood in no Need of Remedies, certainly, for no other Reaſon, but becauſe the Circulation of the Blood had not been ſo long ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, but that it could of its own Accord reſtore itſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oſwaldus Gabelchaverus</hi> relates, in one of his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations quoted by <hi>Schenkius,</hi> the Hiſtory of a Merchant of the Name of <hi>Landthtaler,</hi> who was hang'd on a Tree for ſome Villanies he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: He hung for a whole Hour, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who had Orders to inter him, having cut the Rope, perceived, as they thought, ſome Marks of Life in him, upon which they put him in a Cart, convey'd him to a proper Place, and ſoon reſtored him to Life. He afterwards us'd to ſay, that he was ſenſible of no Pain in hanging, except in his Eyes, and the Extremities of his Toes. About eighteen Years after, however, he began to follow the ſame Practices, for which he had been hang'd before; but <hi>Prince</hi> Charles <hi>of Aremberg</hi> ordered him to be hang'd a ſecond Time, in ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he never returned to Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caeſarienſis in Illuſtr. Mirac. Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 24. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Hiſtory of a certain Robber, who had been hang'd a little before a Servant belonging to a Canon of <hi>Cologne</hi> happened to come up to the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0279301000:74"/>Gallows. The Servant imagining there were ſtill ſome Remains of Life left in him, cut the Rope, and reſtored him to Life, by ſome cold Water ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenfrom an adjacent Rivulet. The Robber, in the mean time, gradually reſuming his Strength, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his Deliverer, who was going to the next Town, and juſt as they were talking with each other, the Robber laid hold of the Bridle of the Servant's Horſe, cried out aloud, that the Horſe belonged to him, and ſwore that the Servant had robb'd him of him: This Debate having drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a large Concourſe of People, their Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was ſo ſtrongly moved againſt the Servant, that without hearing what he had to ſay in his own Juſtification, they were determined to drag him to the Gallows from which he had lately cut down the Robber: but luckily for the Servant, ſome Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the neighbouring Town, ſeeing a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of People going to the Gallows, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed in common to both Towns, came to ſee what the Matter was: then the Crowd ſuffering the Servant to ſpeak, he related his Adventure, and the Manner in which the Robber had recompenc'd his Service. The Robber being at laſt known, was a ſecond Time hung upon the ſame Gallows, in ſuch a Manner as not to return to Life.</p>
            <p>Though the Ground-work of the following Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory reſembles the preceeding, yet it differs from it in many Circumſtances, the moſt conſiderable of which is, the long Time the Criminal continued hang'd.</p>
            <p>A Miller near <hi>Abbeville</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> happening to goe near the Place where a Robber had been hang'd the Day before, ſuſpected that he was not dead. Compaſſion having induc'd him to ſatisfy his Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, which was well-founded, he cut him down, laid him in a Cart, convey'd him to his own Houſe,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0279301000:75"/>and uſed ſuch effectual Means to reſtore him to Life, that in fifteen Days the Robber recovered perfect Health. The Miller upon this intended to give him a little Money, and take his Leave of him; but delaying for ſome Time to put that Intention in Execution; he left him one <hi>Sunday</hi> alone in his Houſe; the miſerable Wretch forgetting what he owed to his Deliverer, broke open a Cupboard, and carried off all the Plate and ready Money he could find. The Miller, upon coming home, and finding his Houſe robbed, eaſily concluded, that his Gueſt was the Perſon who had done it: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the Miller, his two Sons, and a Cart-driver, purſuing the Robber, overtook him about a League off, and dragging him to the Gallows, whence he had been cut down, hung him up a ſecond Time, and gave him ſuch Shocks, that they put it out of his Power to commit any more Robberies. It is about forty Years ſince this Accident happen'd, and Doctor <hi>Bruhier</hi> informs us, that it is atteſted by Perſons of the beſt Reputation in <hi>France;</hi> and a Pardon was actually procured for the Miller, his Sons, and Servant, who took the Liberty of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Robber, without legal Authority.</p>
            <p>Before we put an End to this Treatiſe, which we intend for the common Good and Benefit of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, we ſhall ſay ſomething with Reſpect to the Methods of preſerving the Lives of Children, who appear dead when born. No two Abuſes then, are more prejudicial to Society, contrary to Humanity, or inconſiſtent with Reaſon, than to inter Women big with Child, without performing the <hi>Caeſarian</hi> Operation upon them; and without any Attempts of Relief, totally to abandon Children who ſeem to be born dead.</p>
            <p>The former of theſe Abuſes is founded on two Errors; the firſt of which is, that the Infants do not ſurvive their Mothers, when they die near their
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0279301000:76"/>Time; an the ſecond, that the Lives of Children depend abſolutely on thoſe of their Mothers. Now theſe two Errors are deſtroyed by ſeveral Hiſtories, which prove, that the Death of the Mother does not neceſſarily produce that of the Child.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſpar Reies,</hi> then, in his <hi>Campus Elyſius Jucun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darum Queſtionum,</hi> relates from <hi>Cornarius,</hi> 
               <q>"That a Woman of <hi>Madrid,</hi> of the illuſtrious Hoſe of <hi>Laſſo,</hi> being reputed dead, after remaining three Days, in the utmoſt Agonies, was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Tomb belonging to the Family, which being open'd ſome Months after, her Corps was found, with an Infant tenderly graſped in her right Arm; for, continues the Author, the Woman was pregnant, an near her Time, when ſhe was interr'd as dead."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The following Hiſtory is alſo related, by the ſame Author, and atteſted by ſome of the moſt learned and judicious Men in <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>"The Wife of <hi>Francis Arevallo de Swaſſo,</hi> fell ill in the City of <hi>Segovia,</hi> during the laſt Months of Geſtation: However, as ſhe died, or rather was taken for dead, in a few Days ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd, according to the Cuſtom of the Place. The Huſb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd, in the mean time, who was ſent for to a Place at a conſiderable Diſtance, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had gone about ſome Buſineſs, came home about the Middle of the Night, and being informed that his Wife, whom he loved to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, was dead and buried, he would at any Rate have the Satisfaction of ſeeing her once more: For this Purpoſe, he went to the Church, and ordered her to be raiſed from the Grave; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was the Coffin open'd, till the Cries of a In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant were heard; the By-ſtanders were aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a Juſtice was called, the Prieſts, and a great many others got Flambeaus, and attended the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0279301000:77"/>Huſband; the Shroud was lifted up immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, upon which appeared the Head of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, making a vigorous Effort to diſengage the Reſt of its Body from the Vagina. This Infant was not only extracted, ſound, and alive, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo lived to be Lieutenant General of the City of <hi>Cherez.</hi> The ſurprizing Manner in which he came into the World, laid a Foundation for his being called, <hi>The Son of the Earth.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe Hiſtories, <hi>Caſpar Reies</hi> draws the following Conſequence. <q>"'Tis evident that Children dont die with their Mothers when the latter die near the Periods of their Deliveries. <hi>Sennertus</hi> affirms, not only that they live for ſome Time after their Mothers are dead, but alſo that we may, and even ought, to extract them alive from the Uterus, <hi>Vincelius</hi> has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd two Treatiſes in order to prove theſe Truths, which are alſo ſufficiently eſtabliſh'd in the Diſſertations of <hi>Nymman, De Vita Foetus in Utero,</hi> where, as well as in other Authors we find a great many ſimilar Hiſtories; and others of Women who have been deliver'd of live Children after their own Death. The Reader may alſo conſult <hi>Raynaud de ortu Infantum contra Naturam.</hi> Hence 'tis obvious, that we ought not to be too raſh and precipitate in burying pregnant Women who die near their Times. I am not certain whether theſe Women were dead or alive at the Time of their Interment, tho' it appears evident from the Circumſtances, that the firſt was buried alive; for <hi>Horſtius</hi> proves from another Fact, that dead Women may be deliver'd of Children. Thus he informs us that a Woman big with Child, being hang'd along with her Huſband by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0279301000:78"/>
                  <hi>Deventer</hi> and <hi>Zutphen,</hi> was four Hours after her Death, deliver'd of live Twins."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Bartholin</hi> in <hi>Act. Haſn. An.</hi> 1673 relates an Hiſtory which proves the ſame Truth, and which is, <q>"That of a Child born two Days after the Death of its Mother, which happen'd in a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in which three Midwives had employ'd all their Art and Skill. Thus 'tis certain from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that dead Women may be deliver'd of live Children, and this has perhaps laid a Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for the whimſical and ſuperſtitious Practice of putting into the Coffins of Women who die big with Child, a Needle, a Thread, and a Pair of Sciſſars, as if the Manes ſtood in Need of thoſe Inſtruments to tie and cut the umbilical Chord of the Infant about to be born. In ſhort it has been obſerv'd, that Infants have been born in the Coffins of their Mothers."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Author alſo mentions a Woman who in 1635, on <hi>Thurſday</hi> about 9 o'Clock at Night died of Epileptic Fits. On the <hi>Friday</hi> the Foam was diſcharg'd from her Mouth, Cries reſembling thoſe of an infant were heard, and a ſenſible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was obſerv'd in the Abdomen of the Mother. On <hi>Saturday</hi> about 10 o'Clock in the Morning, the Woman diſcharg'd a great deal of Blood, ſo that on changing her Linnen, her Infant ſtill warm, was found lying betwixt her Things. <hi>Bartholin</hi> adds, that the Phyſicians of the Town were of Opinion that the Mother had only died when her Mouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came full of Froth, without which Circumſtance the Infant could not probably have liv'd.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Miſcellanea Naturae Curioſ.</hi> we have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Women who have died near their Time, and been deliver'd ſometimes of dead, ſometimes of live Children, ſometimes one, two, and three Days after their Deaths. Theſe Inſtances are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0279301000:79"/>by <hi>Reſler,</hi> firſt Phyſician to the Prince of <hi>Brieg</hi> in <hi>Obſ.</hi> 318. <hi>An.</hi> 3. By <hi>Poliſius</hi> in <hi>Obſ.</hi> 42. <hi>An.</hi> 4. By <hi>Doleus</hi> in <hi>Decus.</hi> 2. <hi>An.</hi> 5. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 137. By <hi>Hoyer</hi> in <hi>Decur.</hi> 2. <hi>An.</hi> and laſtly by <hi>Hartmanus</hi> in <hi>Obſervat.</hi> 83. of the ſame Volume.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid 'tis ſufficiently obvious, that thoſe Perſons are greatly miſtaken who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the <hi>Foetus</hi> does not ſurvive its Mother; for it is evinc'd from a Number of Obſervations, that the Life of the <hi>Foetus</hi> is ſuſtain'd by a Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion peculiar to itſelf; that the umbilical Arteries, which terminate in the Placenta, convey thither a Quantity of Blood, which is carried back by the umbilical Vein, without paſſing to the Mother; and that, if this Blood undergoes any Change, it is only from a lymphatic or lacteal Liquor, which the Roots of the Placenta imbibe from the uterine Veſſels. Theſe Truths are at preſent univerſally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon; ſo that before the Death of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can deſtroy the Life of the Child, 'tis neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to prove, Firſt, That the lacteal Liquor ceaſes to be filtrated immediately after the Death of the Mother: Secondly, That the Suppreſſion of this Filtration is an infallible, or even neceſſary Cauſe of Death. In Conſequence of this, we muſt prove, that at every Circulation, the Juices of the <hi>Foetus</hi> have their nutritive and vivifying Principles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; and that the Foetus is incapable of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining in the Uterus a Degree of Faſting, which it often ſupports for ſeveral Days after it is brought into the World. Now, as theſe Propoſitions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved, ſo it cannot be evinced, that the Death of the Mother is neceſſarily ſucceeded by that of the <hi>Foetus;</hi> ſo that 'tis certain, we commit mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Homicide, by interring pregnant Women near their Time, without performing the <hi>Caeſarian</hi> Operation upon them.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0279301000:80"/>
            <p>This is no new Doctrine, ſince in the <hi>Digeſt Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 8. theſe Words occur; <q>"A Royal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict prohibits the Interment of dead pregnant Woman, before we have delivered them, by Means of the <hi>Caeſarian</hi> Operation. Thoſe, who do otherwiſe appear, to have deſtroyed with the pregnant Woman the Hope of obtaining a living Man."</q> It is highly to be lamented, that this Law is not univerſally put in Execution, ſince it is a Principle founded on the eternal and unalterable Nature of Things; <hi>That we kill thoſe whom we do not preſerve, when we have it in our Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it ſhould be objected, that this Operation would, if not always, yet at leaſt very often, prove an uſeleſs Attempt. I anſwer, that it is, an eaſy Operation, ſince it is performed by two or three Strokes of the Biſtory, and a few Stitches of a Needle. Beſides, though Children after this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould appear dead, yet we are not to truſt to thoſe Appearances, unleſs Putrefaction ſhould remove all Doubt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bhonius</hi> informs us, that the Faculty of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine at <hi>Wurtemberg</hi> being conſulted, in a criminal Proceſs rais'd againſt a Mother for killing her own Child, anſwered, that Children were ſometimes born ſo weak, as to appear for a conſiderable Time without Senſation, Motion, and Reſpiration; and that it was neceſſary to uſe vellications, Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Aſperſions of Wine, Spirits of Wine, or <hi>Aqua Vitae;</hi> as alſo to make them ſwallow aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Liquors, or blow ſpirituous Liquors into their Mouths and Noſtrils, till they begin to cry, which is an infallible Mark that the Air has entered the Lungs.</p>
            <p>As to theſe Meaſures, we have before ſhewn, that they have an evident Tendency to reſtore Life. But we muſt not here paſs over a Practice, which,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0279301000:81"/>of all others ſeems to be of the greateſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to ſtill-born Children, which is, the ſucking the left Nipple of the dead Foetus. This Method, as we are told in <hi>Ephemerid. Natur. Curioſ. Dec.</hi> 2. <hi>An.</hi> 5. prov'd ſucceſsful, after vellications, Fric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſpirituous Liquors, and other Methods had been tried in vain. Various other Inſtances of the Succeſs of this Practice are found in the ſame Work, and in the Writings of other practical Authors. Though this Method may at firſt ſeem ridiculous, yet it will appear of the laſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the Anatomiſt, who knows the Senſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Breaſt, all whoſe Nerves center in the Nipple. <hi>Hannemaun</hi> alſo, orders a Sponge dipt in Red Wine, or <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> to be applied to the left Breaſt, and Pit of the Stomach, of ſtill-born Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. <hi>Heiſter,</hi> when ſpeaking of ſuch new-born Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as are exceſſively weak, or hardly appear to be alive, orders a robuſt, ſound Man to breath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Mouths, immediately after he has drank a Dram of Brandy.</p>
            <p>The laſt Method of reſtoring ſtill-born Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Life is, to blow into their Mouths, as is obvious, from various well-atteſted Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with two of which we ſhall put a Period to this Work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Borelli in Hiſt. Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 58. relates, that a Servant returning from the Fields, and finding his Maſter, whom he greatly lov'd, lying dead, he embraced him for a long Time, and by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally breathing in his Mouth, gradually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored him to Life.</p>
            <p>The learned <hi>Grubelius,</hi> in <hi>Miſcellan. Nat. Curioſ. Dec.</hi> 2. <hi>An.</hi> 10. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 44. informs us, that whilſt a Phyſician was preparing the Remedies proper to reſtore to Life, a Woman, who had fallen into ſuch a <hi>Syncope,</hi> that ſhe was thought dead,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0279301000:82"/>her own Servant, who had a great Attachment to her, reſtored her to Life by blowing in her Mouth. But 'tis probable, that this Method produces its happy Effects, rather by reſtoring the Motion of the Blood and Lungs, than by Means of that vivifying Principle, which ſome ſuperſtitious Authors ſuppoſe to be lodg'd in the human Breath.</p>
