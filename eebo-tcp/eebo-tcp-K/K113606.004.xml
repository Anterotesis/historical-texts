            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

         <div n="1" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. I. Of Animals of the Hare Kind.</head>
            <p>HAVING deſcribed in the laſt chapter a tribe of minute, fierce,
          rapacious animals, I come now to a race of minute animals, of a more harmleſs
          and gentle kind, that, without being enemies to any, are preyed upon by all. As
          Nature has fitted the former for hoſtility, ſo it has entirely formed the
          latter for evaſion; and as the one kind ſubſiſt by their courage and
          activity, ſo the other find ſafety from their ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and their
          fears. The Hare is the ſwifteſt animal in the world for the time it
          continues; and few quadrupedes can overtake even the <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0823900104:5"/> rabbit
          when it has but a ſhort way to run. To this claſs alſo we may add the
          ſquirrel, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſembling the hare and rabbit in its form and
          nature, and equally pretty, inoffenſive, and pleaſing.</p>
            <p>If we were methodically to diſtinguiſh animals of the hare kind
          from all others, we might ſay that they have but two cutting teeth above and
          two below, that they are covered with a ſoft downy fur, and that they have a
          buſhy tail. The combination of theſe marks might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps diſtinguiſh
          them tolerably well; whether from the rat, the beaver, the otter, or any other
          moſt nearly approaching in form. But, as I have declined all method that
          rather tends to embarraſs hiſtory than enlighten it, I am contented to
          claſs theſe animals together for no very preciſe reaſon, but becauſe
          I find a general reſemblance between them in their natural ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and in
          the ſhape of their heads and body. I call a ſquirrel an animal of the hare
          kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſomething like a hare. I call the Paca of the ſame
          kind, merely becauſe it is more like a rabbit than any other animal I know
          of. In ſhort, it is fit to erect ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtandard in the
          imagination of the reader, to refer him to ſome animal that he knows, in
          order to direct him in conceiving the figure of <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0823900104:6"/> ſuch as he
          does not know. Still, however, he ſhould be apprized that his knowledge will
          be defective without an examination of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſpecies; and that
          ſaying an animal is of this or that particular kind is but a very trifling
          part of its hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Animals of the hare kind, like all others that feed entirely upon
          vegetables, are inoffenſive and timorous. As Nature furniſhes them with a
          moſt abundant ſupply, they have not that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity after food remarkable in
          ſuch as are often ſtinted in their proviſion. They are extremely active
          and amazingly ſwift, to which they chiefly owe their protection; for being
          the prey of every voracious animal, they are inceſſantly purſued. The
          hare, the rabbit, and the ſquirrel, are placed by Pyerius, in his Treatiſe
          of Ruminating Animals, among the number of thoſe that chew the cud; but how
          far this may be true I will not pretend to determine. Certain it is that their
          lips continually move whether ſleeping or waking. Nevertheleſs, they chew
          their meat very much before they ſwallow it, and for that reaſon I ſhould
          ſuppoſe that it does not want a ſecond maſtication. All theſe animals
          uſe their fore-paws like hands; they are remarkably ſalacious, and are
          furniſhed by Nature with more ample powers than moſt others for the
          buſineſs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation. <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0823900104:7"/> They are ſo very prolific,
          that were they not thinned by the conſtant depredations made upon them by
          moſt other animals, they would quickly over-run the earth.</p>
            <p>Of all theſe the hare is the largeſt, the moſt perſecuted,
          and the moſt timorous; all its muſcles are formed for ſwiftneſs; and
          all its ſenſes ſeem only given to direct its flight. It has very large
          prominent eyes, placed back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in its head, ſo that it can almoſt ſee
          be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it as it runs. Theſe are never wholly cloſed; but as the animal is
          continually upon the watch, it ſleeps with them open. The ears are ſtill
          more remarkable for their ſize; they are moveable and capable of being
          directed to every quarter; ſo that the ſmalleſt ſounds are readily
          received, and the animal's motions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected accordingly. The muſcles of the
          body are very ſtrong, and without fat, ſo that it may be ſaid to carry no
          ſuperfluous burthen of fleſh about it; the hinder feet are longer than the
          fore, which ſtill adds to the rapidity of its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and almoſt all
          animals that are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for their ſpeed, except the horſe, are formed
          in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>An animal ſo well formed for a life of eſcape might be
          ſuppoſed to enjoy a ſtate of tolerable ſecurity; but as every rapacious
          creature is its <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0823900104:8"/> enemy, it but very ſeldom lives out its
          natural term. Dogs of all kinds purſue it by inſtinct, and follow the hare
          more eagerly than any other animal. The cat and the weaſel kinds are
          con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually lying in ambuſh, and practiſing all their little arts to
          ſeize it; birds of prey are ſtill more dangerous enemies, as againſt them
          no ſwiftneſs can avail, nor retreat ſecure; but man, an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my far more
          powerful than all, prefers its fleſh to that of other animals, and deſtroys
          greater numbers than all the reſt. Thus purſued and perſecuted on every
          ſide, the race would long ſince have been totally extirpated, did it not
          find a reſource in its amazing fertility.</p>
            <p>The hare multiplies exceedingly; it is in a ſtate of engendering
          at a few months old; the females go with young but thirty days, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
          bring forth three or four at a time<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon. vol.
              xiii. p. 12.</bibl>
               </note>. As ſoon as they have produced their young they
          are again ready for conception, and thus do not loſe any time in continuing
          the breed. But they are in another reſpect fitted in an extraordinary manner
          for multiplying their kind; for the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, from the conformation of her womb,
          is often ſeen to bring forth, and yet to continue pregnant at the ſame
          time; or, in other words, to have young ones of different ages in her 
          <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0823900104:9"/> womb together. Other animals never receive the male when
          pregnant, but bring forth their young at once. But it is frequently different
          with the hare; the female often, though already impregnated, admitting the
          male, and thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a ſecond impregnation. The reaſon of this
          extraordinary circumſtance is, that the womb in theſe animals is divided in
          ſuch a manner that it may be conſidered as a double organ, one ſide of
          which may be filled while the other remains empty. Thus theſe animals may be
          ſeen to couple at every period of their pregnancy, and even while they are
          bringing forth young laying the foundation of another brood.</p>
            <p>The young of theſe animals are brought forth with their eyes open,
          and the dam ſuckles them for twenty days, after which they leave her, and
          ſeek out for themſelves<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>. From this we obſerve, that the education theſe animals
          re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is but trifling, and the family connexion but of ſhort duration. In
          the rapacious kinds the dam leads her young forth for months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; teaches
          them the arts of rapine; and, although ſhe wants milk to ſupply them, yet
          keeps them under her care until they are able to hunt for themſelves. But a
          long connexion of this kind would be very unneceſſary as well 
          <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0823900104:10"/> as dangerous to the timid animals we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing;
          their food is eaſily procured; and their aſſociations, inſtead of
          protection, would only expoſe them to their purſuers. They ſeldom,
          however, ſeparate far from each other, or from the place where they were
          produced; but make each a form at ſome diſtance, having a predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
          rather for the place than each other's ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. They feed during the night
          rather than by day, chuſing the moſt tender blades of graſs, and
          quenching their thirſt with the dew. They live alſo upon roots, leaves,
          fruits and corn, and prefer ſuch plants as are furniſhed with a milky
          juice. They alſo ſtrip the bark of trees during the winter, there being
          ſcarce any that they will not feed on, except the lime or the alder. They are
          particularly fond of birch, pinks, and parſley. When they are kept tame, they
          are fed with lettuce and other garden herbs; but the fleſh of ſuch as are
          thus brought up is always indifferent.</p>
            <p>They ſleep or repoſe in their forms by day, and may be ſaid to
          live only by night<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>. It is then that they go forth to feed and couple. They do
          not pair, however, but in the rutting ſeaſon, which begins in February; the
          male purſues and diſcovers the female by the ſagacity <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0823900104:11"/>
          of its noſe. They are then ſeen, by moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, playing, ſkipping, and
          purſuing each other; but the leaſt motion, the ſlighteſt breeze, the
          falling of a leaf is ſufficient to diſturb their revels; they inſtantly
          fly off, and each takes a ſeparate way.</p>
            <p>As their limbs are made for running, they eaſily outſtrip all
          other animals in the beginning; and could they preſerve their ſpeed it
          would be impoſſible to overtake them; but as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt their
          ſtrength at their firſt efforts, and double back to the place they were
          ſtarted from, they are more eaſily taken than the fox, which is a much
          ſlower animal than they. As their hind legs are longer than the fore, they
          always chuſe to run up hill, by which the ſpeed of their purſuers is
          diminiſhed while theirs remains the ſame. Their motions are alſo without
          any noiſe, as they have the ſole of the foot furniſhed with hair; and
          they ſeem the only animals that have hair on the inſide of their
          mouths.</p>
            <p>They ſeldom live above ſeven or eight years at the utmoſt;
          they come to their full perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a year; and this multiplied by ſeven,
          as in other animals, gives the extent of their lives<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. xiii. p. 12.</bibl>
               </note>. It is ſaid,
          however, that the females live longer than the males: of this Mr. Buffon makes
          a <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0823900104:12"/> doubt; but I am aſſured that it is ſo. They paſs
          their lives, in our climate, in ſolitude and ſilence; and they ſeldom are
          heard to cry, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when they are ſeized or wounded. Their voice is not
          ſo ſharp as the note of ſome other animals, but more nearly approaching
          that of the ſqualling of a child. They are not ſo wild as their
          diſpoſitions and their habits ſeem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate; but are of a complying
          nature, and eaſily ſuſceptible of a kind of education. They are eaſily
          tamed. They even become fond and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſing, but they are incapable of
          attachment to any particular perſon, and never can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon; for,
          though taken never ſo young, they regain their native freedom at the firſt
          opportunity. As they have a remarkable good ear, and ſit upon their hind
          legs, and uſe their fore-paws as hands, they have been taught to beat the
          drum, to dance to muſic, and go through the manual exerciſe.</p>
            <p>But their natural inſtincts for their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are much
          more extraordinary than thoſe artificial tricks that are taught them. They
          make themſelves a form particularly in thoſe places where the colour of the
          graſs moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles that of their ſkin; it is open to the ſouth in
          winter and to the north in ſummer. The hare, when it hears the hounds at a
          di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0823900104:13"/> flies for ſome time through a natural
          impulſe, without managing its ſtrength, or conſulting any other means but
          ſpeed for its ſafety. Having attained ſome hill or riſing ground, and
          left the dogs ſo far behind that it no longer hears their cries, it ſtops,
          rears on its hinder legs, and at length looks back to ſee if it has not
          loſt its purſuers. But theſe, having once fallen upon the ſcent,
          purſue ſlowly and with united ſkill, and the poor animal ſoon again
          hears the fatal tidings of their approach. Sometimes when ſore hunted it will
          ſtart a freſh hare, and ſquat in the ſame form; ſometimes it will
          creep under the door of a ſheep-cot, and hide among the ſheep; ſometimes
          it will run among them, and no vigilance can drive it from the flock; ſome
          will enter holes like the rabbit, which the hunters call going to
          <hi>vault</hi>; ſome will go up one ſide of the hedge and come down the
          other; and it has been known that an hare ſorely hunted has got upon the top
          of a cut quick-ſet hedge, and run a good way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which it has
          effectually evaded the hounds. It is no unuſual thing alſo for them to
          betake themſelves to furz buſhes, and to leap from one to another, by which
          the dogs are frequently miſled. However, the firſt doubling an hare makes
          is generally a key to <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0823900104:14"/> all its future attempts of that
          kind, the latter being exactly like the former. The young hares tread heavier,
          and leave a ſtronger ſcent than the old, becauſe their limbs are weaker;
          and the more this forlorn creature tires, the heavier it treads, and the
          ſtronger is the ſcent it leaves. A buck, or male hare, is known by its
          chuſing to run upon hard highways, feeding farther from the wood-ſides and
          making its doublings of a greater compaſs than the female. The male having
          made a turn or two about its form, frequently leads the hounds five or ſix
          miles on a ſtretch; but the female keeps cloſe by ſome covert ſide,
          turns, croſſes, and winds among the buſhes like a rabbit, and ſeldom
          runs directly forward. In general, however, both male and female regulate their
          conduct according to the weather. In a moiſt day they hold by the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
          more than at any other time, becauſe the ſcent is then ſtrongeſt upon
          the graſs. If they come to the ſide of a grove or ſpring they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to
          enter, but ſquat down by the ſide thereof until the hounds have overſhot
          them; and then, turning along their former path, make to their old form, from
          which they vainly hope for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
            <p>Hares are divided, by the hunters, into mountain and meaſled
          hares. The former are <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0823900104:15"/> more ſwift, vigorous, and have
          their fleſh better taſted; the latter chiefly frequent the marſhes, when
          hunted keep among low grounds, and their fleſh is moiſt, white, and flabby.
          When the male and female keep one particular ſpot, they will not ſuffer any
          ſtrange hare to make its form in the ſame quarter, ſo that it is
          uſually ſaid that the more you hunt the more hares you ſhall have; for,
          having killed one hare, others come and take poſſeſſion of its form.
          Many of theſe animals are found to live in woods and thickets, but they are
          naturally fonder of the open country, and are conſtrained only by fear to
          take ſhelter in places that afford them neither a warm ſun nor an agreeable
          paſture. They are therefore, uſually ſeen ſtealing out of the edges of
          the wood to taſte the graſs that grows ſhorter and ſweeter in the open
          fields than under the ſhade of the trees; however, they ſeldom miſs of
          being purſued; and every excurſion is a new adventure. They are ſhot at
          by poachers; traced by their footſteps in the ſnow; caught in ſprings;
          dogs, birds, and cats, are all combined againſt them; ants, ſnakes, and
          adders, drive them from their forms, eſpecially in ſummer; even fleas, from
          which moſt other animals are free, perſecute this poor creature; and, ſo
          va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious are its enemies, that it is ſeldom permitted <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0823900104:16"/> to
          reach even that ſhort term to which it is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by nature.</p>
            <p>The ſoil and climate have their influence upon this animal as well
          as on moſt others. In the countries bordering on the north pole, they become
          white in winter, and are often ſeen in great troops of four or five hundred,
          running along the banks of the river Irtiſh, or the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſca, and as white
          as the ſnow they tread on. They are caught in toils for the ſake of their
          ſkins, which on the ſpot are ſold for leſs than ſeven ſhillings an
          hundred. Their fur is well known to form a conſiderable article in the hat
          manufacture; and we accordingly import vaſt quantities of it from thoſe
          countries where the hare abounds in ſuch plenty. They are found alſo
          entirely black, but theſe in much leſs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity than the former<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Klein Diſp. Quadrup. p. 52.</bibl>
               </note>; and even ſome

            <p>The hares of the hot countries, particularly in Italy, Spain, and
          Barbary, are ſmaller than ours: thoſe bred in the Milaneſe country are

               </note>. There
          is ſcarce a country where this animal is not to be found, from the torrid
          zone to the neighbourhood of the polar circle. The natives of Guinea 
          <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0823900104:17"/> knock them on the head as they come down to the ſides of
          the rivers to drink. They alſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the place where they are ſeen in
          numbers, and clattering a ſhort ſtick, which every man carries, againſt
          that which the perſon next him carries, they diminiſh their circle
          gradually, till the hares are cooped up in the midſt. They then all together
          throw their ſticks in among them, and with ſuch deadly force, that they
          ſeldom fail of killing great numbers at a time<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>The fleſh of this animal has been eſteemed as a delicacy among
          ſome nations, and is held in deteſtation by others. The Jews, the ancient
          Britains, and the Mahometans, all conſidered it as an unclean animal, and
          religiouſly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from it. On the contrary, there are ſcarce any
          other people, however barbarous, at preſent, that do not conſider it as the
          moſt agreeable food. Faſhion ſeems to preſide and govern all the
          ſenſes; what mankind at one time conſider as beautiful, fragrant, or
          ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, may at another time, or among another nation, be regarded as
          deformed, diſguſtful, or ill taſted. That fleſh which the ancient
          Romans ſo much admired as to call it the food of the wiſe, was, among the
          Jews and the Druids, thought unfit to be eaten; and even the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, 
          <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0823900104:18"/> who like the Romans conſider the fleſh of this animal
          as a delicacy, have very different ideas as to dreſſing it. With us it is
          ſimply ſerv'd up without any ſeaſoning; but Apicius ſhews us the
          manner of dreſſing an hare in true Roman taſte, with parſley, rice,

               <head>THE RABBIT.</head>
               <p>THE Hare and the Rabbit, though ſo very nearly reſembling each
            other in form and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, are yet diſtinct kinds, as they refuſe
            to mix with each other. Mr. Buffon bred up ſeveral of both kinds in the
            ſame place; but from being at firſt indifferent, they ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
            enemies; and their combats were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally continued until one of them was
            diſabled or deſtroyed. However, though theſe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were not
            attended with ſucceſs, I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that nothing is more frequent than
            an animal bred between theſe two, which, like all other mules, is marked with
            ſterility. Nay, it has been actually known that the rabbit couples with
            animals of a much more diſtant nature; and there is at preſent in the
            Muſeum at Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, a creature covered with feathers and hair, and
            ſaid to be bred between a rabbit and an hen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0823900104:19"/>The fecundity of the rabbit is ſtill greater
            than that of the hare; and if we ſhould calculate the produce from a ſingle
            pair, in one year, the number would be amazing. They breed ſeven times in a
            year, and bring eight young ones each time. On a ſuppoſition, therefore,
            that this happens regularly, at the end of four years, a couple of rabbits
            ſhall ſee a progeny of almoſt a million and an half. From hence we might
            juſtly apprehend being overſtocked by their encreaſe; but, happily for
            mankind, their enemies are numerous, and their nature inoffenſive; ſo that
            their deſtruction bears a near proportion to their fertility.</p>
               <p>But although their numbers be diminiſhed by every beaſt and
            bird of prey, and ſtill more by man himſelf, yet there is no danger of
            their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation. The hare is a poor defenceleſs animal, that has nothing
            but its ſwiftneſs to depend on for ſafety; its numbers are, therefore,
            every day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing; and in countries that are well peopled, the ſpecies
            are ſo much kept under, that laws are made for their preſervation. Still,
            however, it is moſt likely that they will be at laſt totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed;
            and, like the wolf or the elk in ſome countries, be only kept in remembrance.
            But it is otherwiſe with the rabbit, its fecundity being greater, and its
            means of ſafety more certain. <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0823900104:20"/> The hare ſeems to have
            more various arts and inſtincts to eſcape its purſuers, by doubling,
            ſquatting, and winding; the rabbit has but one art of defence alone, but in
            that one finds ſafety; by making itſelf a hole, where it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues a great
            part of the day, and breeds up its young; there it continues ſecure from the
            fox, the hound, the kite, and every other enemy.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, though this retreat be ſafe and convenient, the
            rabbit does not ſeem to be naturally fond of keeping there. It loves the
            ſunny field and the open paſture; it ſeems to be a chilly animal, and
            diſlikes the coldneſs of its under-ground habitation. It is, therefore,
            continually out, when it does not fear diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and the female often
            brings forth her young, at a diſtance from the warren, in an hole, not above
            a foot deep at the moſt. There ſhe ſuckles them for about a month;
            covering them over with moſs and graſs, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe goes to paſture,
            and ſcratching them up at her return. It has been ſaid, indeed, that this
            ſhallow hole without the warren, is made leſt the male ſhould attack and
            deſtroy her young; but I have ſeen the male himſelf attend the young
            there, lead them out to feed, and conduct them back upon the return of the dam.
            This external retreat ſeems a kind of <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0823900104:21"/> country houſe,
            at a diſtance from the general habitation; it is uſually made near ſome
            ſpot of excellent paſture, or in the midſt of a field of ſprouting
            corn. To this both male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male often retire from the warren; lead their
            young by night to the food which lies ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and, if not
            diſturbed, continue there till they are perfectly grown up. There they find a
            greater variety of paſture than near the warren, which is generally eaten
            bare; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a warmer ſun, by covering themſelves up in a ſhallower
            hole. Whenever they are diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, they then forſake their retreat of
            pleaſure, for one of ſafety; they fly to the warren with their utmoſt
            ſpeed; and, if the way be ſhort, there is ſcarce any dog, how ſwift
            ſoever, that can overtake them.</p>
               <p>But it does not always happen that theſe animals are
            poſſeſſed of one of theſe external apartments; they moſt uſually
            bring forth their young in the warren, but always in a hole, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from
            the male. On theſe occaſions, the female digs herſelf an hole<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon.</bibl>
                  </note>, different from the ordinary one, by
            being more intricate; at the bottom of which ſhe makes a more ample
            apartment. This done, ſhe pulls off from her belly a good quantity of her
            hair, with which ſhe <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0823900104:22"/> makes a kind of bed for her young.
            During the two firſt days ſhe never leaves them; and does not ſtir out
            but to procure nouriſhment, which ſhe takes with the utmoſt diſpatch;
            in this manner ſuckling her young, for near ſix weeks, until they are
            ſtrong, and able to go abroad themſelves. During all this time, the male
            ſeldom viſits their ſeparate apartment; but when they are grown up, ſo
            as to come to the mouth of the hole, he then ſeems to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them as
            his offspring, takes them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his paws, ſmooths their ſkin, and licks
            their eyes; all of them, one after the other, have an equal ſhare in his
            careſſes.</p>
               <p>In this manner the rabbit, when wild, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults its pleaſure
            and its ſafety; but thoſe that are bred up tame, do not take the trouble of

               <p>Rabbits of the domeſtic breed, like all other animals that are
            under the protection of man, are of various colours; white, brown, black, and
            mouſe colour. The black are the moſt ſcarce; the brown, white, and
            mouſe colour, are in greater plenty. Moſt of the wild rabbits are of a
            brown, and it is the colour which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails among the ſpecies; for, in every
            neſt of rabbits, whether the parents be black or white, there are ſome
            brown ones found of the number. But, in England, there are many warrens
            ſtocked with the mouſe colour kinds, which ſome ſay came originally
            from an iſland in the river Humber, and which ſtill continue their original

            who bred up tame rabbits for his amuſement, gives the following account of
            their production. I began, ſays he, by having but one male and female only;
            the male was entirely white, and the female brown; but, in their poſterity,
            the number of the brown by far exceeded thoſe of any other colour: there were
            ſome white, ſome party-coloured, and ſome black. It is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing 
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0823900104:24"/> how much the deſcendants were obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and
            ſubmiſſive to their common parent; he was eaſily diſtinguiſhed from
            the reſt by his ſuperior whiteneſs; and, however numerous the other males
            were, this kept them all in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. Whenever they quarrelled among each
            other, either for their females or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, as ſoon as he heard the
            noiſe he ran up to them with all diſpatch, and, upon his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, all
            was inſtantly reduced to peace and order. If he caught any of them in the
            fact, he inſtantly puniſhed them, as an example to the reſt. Another
            inſtance of his ſuperiority was, that having accuſtomed them to come to
            me with the call of a whiſtle, the inſtant this ſignal was given, I ſaw
            him marſhalling them up, leading them the foremoſt, and then ſuffering
            them all to file off before him.</p>

                  </note>, though leſs than the hare, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally lives
            longer. As theſe animals paſs the greater part of their lives in their
            burrow, where they continue at eaſe and unmoleſted, they have nothing to
            prevent the regularity of their health, or the due courſe of their
            nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They are, therefore, generally found fatter than the hare; but
            their fleſh is, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, much leſs delicate. That of the 
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0823900104:25"/> old ones, in particular, is hard, tough and dry; but it is
            ſaid, that, in warmer countries, they are better taſted. This may very well
            be, as the rabbit, though ſo very plenty in Great Britain and Ireland, is,
            nevertheleſs, a native of the warmer climates; and has been originally
            imported into theſe kingdoms, from Spain. In that country, and in ſome of
            the iſlands in the Mediterranean, we are told, that they once multiplied in
            ſuch numbers as to prove the greateſt nuiſance to the natives. They at
            firſt demanded military aid to deſtroy them; but ſoon after they called
            in the aſſiſtance of ferrets, which originally came from Africa, and
            theſe, with much more eaſe and expedition, contrived to leſſen the
            calamity. In fact, rabbits are found to love a warm climate, and to be
            inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of bearing the cold of the north; ſo that in Sweden they are
            obliged to be littered in the houſes. It is otherwiſe in all the tropical
            cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, where they are extremely common, and where they ſeldom burrow, as
            with us. The Engliſh countries that are moſt noted for theſe animals, are
            Lincolnſhire, Norfolk, and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeſhire. They delight in grounds of a
            ſandy ſoil, which are warmer than thoſe of clay; and which alſo
            furniſh a ſofter and finer paſture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0823900104:26"/>The tame rabbits are larger than the wild
            ones, from their taking more nouriſhment, and uſing leſs exerciſe; but
            their fleſh is not ſo good, being more inſipid and ſofter. In order to
            im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, they are chiefly fed upon bran, and are ſtinted in their water;
            for, if indulged in too great a plenty of moiſt food, they are apt, as the
            feeders expreſs it, to grow rotten. The hair or fur is a very uſeful
            commodity, and is employed in England for ſeveral purpoſes, as well when
            the ſkin is dreſſed with it on, as when it is pulled off. The ſkins,
            eſpecially the white, are uſed for lining cloaths, and are conſidered as
            a cheap imitation of ermine. The ſkin of the male is uſually preferred, as
            being the moſt laſting, but it is coarſer; that on the belly in either
            ſex, is the beſt and fineſt. But the chief uſe made of rabbit's fur, is
            in the manufacture of hats; it is always mixed, in certain propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with
            the fur of the beaver; and it is ſaid to give the latter more ſtrength and
            conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>The Syrian rabbit, like all other animals bred in that country, is
            remarkable for the length of its hair; it falls along the ſides in wavy
            wreaths, and is, in ſome places, curled at the end, like wool; it is ſhed
            once a year in large maſſes; and it often happens that the rabbit, dragging
            a <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0823900104:27"/> part of its robe on the ground, appears as if it had got
            another leg, or a longer tail. There are no rabbits naturally in America;
            however, thoſe that have been carried from Europe, are found to multiply in
            the Weſt India iſlands in great abundance. In other parts of that
            con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, they have animals that in ſome meaſure reſemble the rabbits
            of Europe; and which moſt European travellers have often called hares or
            rabbits, as they happened to be large or ſmall. Their giving them even the
            name will be a ſufficient excuſe for my placing them among animals of the
            hare kind; although they may differ in many of the moſt eſſential
            particulars. But before we go to the new continent, we will firſt examine
            ſuch as bear even a diſtant reſemblance to the hare kind at home.</p>

               <head>THE SQUIRREL.</head>
               <p>THERE are few readers that are not as well acquainted with the
            figure of a Squirrel as that of the rabbit; but ſuppoſing it unknown to
            any, we might give them ſome idea of its form, by comparing it to a rabbit,
            with ſhorter ears, and a longer tail. The tail, indeed, is alone ſufficient
            to diſtinguiſh it from all others, as it is extremely long, beautiful and
            buſhy, <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0823900104:28"/> ſpreading like a fan, and which, when thrown up
            behind, covers the whole body. This ſerves the little animal for a double
            purpoſe; when erected, it ſerves, like an umbrella, as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
            protection from the injuries of the heat and cold; and when extended, it is
            very inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in promoting theſe vaſt leaps that the ſquirrel
            takes from tree to tree: nay, ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that it anſwers ſtill a
            third purpoſe, and when the ſquirrel takes water, which it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
            does upon a piece of bark, that its tail ſerves it inſtead of a ſail<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>There are few wild animals in which there are ſo many varieties
            as in the ſquirrel. The <hi>common ſquirrel</hi> is of the ſize of a
            ſmall rabbit, and is rather of a more reddiſh brown. The belly and breaſt
            are white; and the ears beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ornamented with long tufts of hair, of a
            deeper colour than that on the body. The eyes are large, black and lively; the
            legs are ſhort and muſcular, like thoſe of the rabbit; but the toes
            longer, and the claws ſharper, ſo as to fit it for climbing. When it eats,
            or dreſſes itſelf, it ſits erect, like the hare or rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, making
            uſe of its fore legs as hands; and chiefly reſides in trees. The <hi>grey
            Virginian ſquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,</hi> which Mr. Buffon calls the Petit Gris, is 
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0823900104:29"/> larger than a rabbit, and of a greyiſh colour. Its body
            and limbs are thicker than thoſe of the common ſquirrel; and its ears are
            ſhorter, and without tufts at the point. The upper part of the body, and
            external part of the legs, are of a fine whitiſh grey, with a beautiful red
            ſtreak on each ſide lengthways. The tail is covered with very long grey
            hair, variegated with black and white towards the extremity. This variety
            ſeems to be common to both continents; and in Sweden is ſeen to change
            colour in winter. The <hi>Barbary ſquirrel,</hi> of which Mr. Buffon makes
            three varieties, is of a mixed colour, between red and black. Along the ſides
            there are white and brown lines, which render this animal very beautiful; but
            what ſtill adds to its elegance is, that the belly is of a ſky blue,
            ſurrounded with white. Some of theſe hold up the tail erect; and others
            throw it forward over their body. The <hi>Siberian white ſquirrel</hi> is of
            the ſize of a common ſquirrel. The <hi>Carolina black ſquirrel</hi> is
            much bigger than the former, and ſometimes tipt with white at all the
            extremities. The <hi>Braſilian ſquirrel,</hi> which Mr. Buffon calls the
            Coquallin, is a beautiful animal of this kind, and very remarkable for the
            variety of its colours. Its belly is of a bright yellow; its head and body
            variegated with white, black, <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0823900104:30"/> brown and orange colour. It
            wants the tufts at the extremity of its ears; and does not climb trees, as
            moſt of the kind are ſeen to do. To this liſt may be added the <hi>little
            ground ſquirrel of Carolina,</hi> of a reddiſh colour, and blackiſh
            ſtripes on each ſide; and, like the former, not delighting in trees.
            Laſtly, the <hi>ſquirrel of New Spain,</hi> which is of a deep iron-grey
            colour, with ſeven longitudinal whitiſh ſtreaks along the ſides of the
            male, and five along thoſe of the female. As for the flying ſquirrels, they
            are a diſtinct kind, and ſhall be treated of by themſelves.</p>
               <p>Theſe, which I ſuppoſe to be but a few of the numerous
            varieties of the ſquirrel, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſerve to ſhew how
            extenſively this animal is diffuſed over all parts of the world. It is not
            to be ſuppoſed, however, that every variety is capable of ſuſtaining
            every climate; for few animals are ſo tender, or ſo little able to endure a
            change of abode, as this. Thoſe bred in the tropical climates, will only live
            near a warm ſun; while, on the contrary, the ſquirrel of Siberia will
            ſcarce endure the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of ours. Theſe varieties do not only differ
            in their conſtitutions and colour, but in their diſpoſitions alſo; for
            while ſome live on the tops of trees, others feed, like rabbits, 
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0823900104:31"/> on vegetables below. Whether any of theſe, ſo
            variouſly coloured, and ſo differently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, would breed among
            each other, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell: and ſince, therefore, we are left in uncertainty
            upon this point, we are at liberty either to conſider each as a diſtinct
            ſpecies by itſelf; or only a variety, that accident might have originally
            produced, and that the climate or ſoil might have continued. For my own part,
            as the original character of the ſquirrel is ſo ſtrongly marked upon them
            all, I cannot help conſidering them in the latter point of view; rather as
            the common deſcendants of one parent, than originally formed with ſuch
            diſtinct ſimilitudes.</p>
               <p>The ſquirrel is a beautiful little animal<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon.</bibl>
                  </note>, which is but half ſavage; and
            which, from the gentleneſs and innocence of its manners, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our
            protection. It is neither carnivorous nor hurtful; its uſual food is fruits,
            nuts and acorns; it is cleanly, nimble, active, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious; its eyes
            are ſparkling, and its phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomy marked with meaning. It generally, like
            the hare and rabbit, ſits up on its hinder legs, and uſes the fore paws as
            hands; theſe have five claws or toes, as they are called, and one of them is
            ſeparated from the reſt like a <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0823900104:32"/> thumb. This animal
            ſeems to approach the nature of birds, from its lightneſs, and
            ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing agility on the tops of trees. It ſeldom deſcends to the
            ground, except in caſe of ſtorms, but jumps from one branch to another;
            feeds, in ſpring, on the buds and young ſhoots; in ſummer, on the
            ripening fruits; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the young cones of the pine-tree. In autumn
            it has an extenſive variety to feaſt upon; the acorn, the philberd, the
            cheſtnut, and the wilding. This ſeaſon of plenty, however, is not ſpent
            in idle enjoyment; the provident little animal gathers at that time its
            proviſions for the winter; and cautiouſly foreſees the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon when
            the foreſt ſhall be ſtripped of its leaves and fruitage</p>
               <p>Its neſt is generally formed among the large branches of a great
            tree, where they begin to fork off into ſmall ones. After chuſing the place
            where the timber begins to decay, and an hollow may the more eaſily be
            formed, the ſquirrel begins by making a kind of level be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the forks; and
            then bringing moſs, twigs, and dry leaves, it binds them together with great
            art, ſo as to reſiſt the moſt violent ſtorm. This is covered up on
            all ſides; and has but a ſingle opening at top, which is juſt large
            enough to admit the little animal; and <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0823900104:33"/> this opening is
            itſelf defended from the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a kind of canopy, made in the faſhion
            of a cone, ſo that it throws off the rain, though never ſo heavy. The
            neſt thus formed, with a very little opening above, is, nevertheleſs, very
            commodious and roomy below; ſoft, well knit together, and every way
            convenient and warm. In this retreat the little animal brings forth its young,
            ſhelters itſelf from the ſcorching heat of the ſun, which it ſeems to
            fear, and from the ſtorms and the inclemency of winter, which it is ſtill
            leſs capable of ſupporting. Its proviſion of nuts and acorns is ſeldom
            in its neſt, but in the hollows of the tree, laid up carefully to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and
            never touched but in caſes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. Thus one ſingle tree ſerves
            for a retreat and a ſtore-houſe; and without leaving it during the winter,
            the ſquirrel poſſeſſes all thoſe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that its nature is
            capable of receiving. But it ſometimes happens that its little manſion is
            attacked by a deadly and powerful foe. The martin goes often in queſt of a
            retreat for its young, which it is incapable of making for itſelf; for this
            reaſon it fixes upon the neſt of a ſquirrel, and, with double
            injuſtice, deſtroys the tenant, and then takes poſſeſſion of the
            manſion.</p>
               <p>However, this is a calamity that but ſeldom <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0823900104:34"/>
            happens: and, of all other animals, the ſquirrel leads the moſt
            frolickſome playful life; being ſurrounded with abundance, and having few
            enemies to fear. They are in heat early in the ſpring; when, as a modern
            naturaliſt ſays<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Britiſh
                Zoology.</bibl>
                  </note>, it is very diverting to ſee the female feigning an
            eſcape from the purſuit of two or three males, and to obſerve the various
            proofs which they give of their agility, which is then exerted in full force.
            Nature ſeems to have been particular in her formation of theſe animals for
            propagation: however, they ſeldom bring forth above four or five young at a
            time; and that but once a year. The time of their geſtation ſeems to be
            about ſix weeks; they are pregnant in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of April, and bring
            forth about the middle of May.</p>
               <p>The ſquirrel is never found in the open fields, nor yet in
            copſes or underwoods; it always keeps in the midſt of the talleſt trees,
            and, as much as poſſible, ſhuns the habitations of men. It is extremely
            watchful; if the tree in which it reſides be but touched at the bottom, the
            ſquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel inſtantly takes the alarm, quits its neſt, at once flies off to
            another tree, and thus travels, with great eaſe, along the tops of the
            foreſt, until it finds itſelf perfectly out of danger. In 
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0823900104:35"/> this manner it continues for ſome hours at a diſtance
            from home, until the alarm be paſt away; and then it returns, by paths that
            to all quadrupedes but itſelf are utterly impaſſable. Its uſual way of
            moving is by bounds; theſe it takes from one tree to another, at forty feet
            diſtance; and if at any time it is obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, it runs up the

               <p>In Lapland, and the extenſive foreſts to the north, the
            ſquirrels are obſerved to change their habitation, and to remove in vaſt
            numbers from one country to another. In theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations they are generally
            ſeen by thouſands, travelling directly forward; while neither rocks,
            foreſts, nor even the broadeſt waters can ſtop their progreſs. What I
            am going to relate, appears ſo extraordinary, that were it not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by
            numbers of the moſt credible hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, among whom are Klein and

            approaching the banks, and perceiving the breadth of the water, they return as

               <head>THE FLYING SQUIRREL.</head>
               <p>Mr. Ray was juſtly of opinion that the Flying Squirrel might
            more properly be ſaid to be of the rat kind, becauſe its fur is ſhorter
            than in other ſquirrels, and its colours alſo more nearly approach the
            former. However, as mankind have been content to claſs it among the
            ſquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, it is ſcarcely worth making a new diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its favour.
            This little animal, which is frequently brought over to England, is leſs than
            a common ſquirrel and bigger than a field mouſe. Its ſkin is very ſoft,
            and elegantly adorned with a dark fur in ſome places and light grey in
            others. <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:41"/>

                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0823900104:44"/> It has
            large prominent black and very ſparkling eyes, ſmall ears, and very ſharp
            teeth, with which it gnaws any thing quickly. When it does not leap, its tail,
            which is pretty enough, lies cloſe to its back; but when it takes its
            ſpring, the tail is moved backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from ſide to ſide. It
            is ſaid to partake ſomewhat of the nature of the ſquirrel, of the rat,
            and of the dormouſe; but that in which it is diſtinguiſhed from all other
            animals, is its peculiar conformation for taking thoſe leaps that almoſt
            look like flying. It is, indeed, amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee it at one bound dart above
            an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yards, from one tree to another. They are aſſiſted in this
            ſpring by a very peculiar for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſkin, that extends from the
            fore-feet to the hinder; ſo that when the animal ſtretches its fore-legs
            forward and its hind-legs backward, this ſkin is ſpread out between them,
            ſomewhat like that between the legs of a bat. The ſurface of the body being
            thus encreaſed, the little animal keeps buoyant in the air until the force of
            its firſt impulſion is expired, and then it deſcends. This ſkin, when
            the creature is at reſt, or walking, continues wrinkled up on its ſides;
            but when its limbs are extended, it forms a kind of web between them of above
            an inch broad on either ſide, and gives the <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0823900104:45"/> whole body
            the appearance of a ſkin floating in the air. In this manner the flying
            ſquirrel changes place, not like a bird, by repeated ſtrokes of its wings,
            but rather like a paper kite ſupported by the expanſion of the ſurface of
            its body; but with this difference, however, that, being naturally heavier than
            the air, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of mounting it deſcends; and that jump which upon the
            ground would not be above forty yards, when from an higher tree to a lower may
            be above an hundred.</p>
               <p>This little animal is more common in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica than in Europe, but
            not very commonly to be ſeen in either. It is uſually found, like the
            ſquirrel, on the tops of trees; but, though better fitted for leaping, it is
            of a more torpid diſpoſition, and is ſeldom ſeen to exert its powers;
            ſo that it is often ſeized by the pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat and the martin. It is eaſily
            tamed, but apt to break away whenever it finds an opportunity. It does not
            ſeem fond of nuts or almonds, like other ſquirrels, but is chiefly
            pleaſed with the ſprouts of the birch and the cones of the pine. It is fed
            in its tame ſtate with bread and fruits; it generally ſleeps by day, and is
            always moſt active by night. Some naturaliſts gravely caution us not to let
            it get among our corn fields, where they tell us it will do a great deal of
            damage, <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:46"/>

            its varieties we proceed to a different tribe of animals, no way indeed
            reſembling the ſquirrel, but ſtill ſomething like the rabbit and the
            hare. We are to keep theſe two animals ſtill in view as the center of our
            compariſon; as objects to which many others may bear ſome ſimilitude,
            though they but little approach each other. Among the hare kind is the Marmout,
            which naturaliſts have placed either among the hare kind or the rat kind, as
            it ſuited their reſpective ſyſtems. In fact, it bears no great
            reſemblance to either; but of the two it approaches much nearer the hare, as
            well in the make of its head as in its ſize, in its buſhy tail, and
            particularly in its chewing the cud, which alone is ſufficient to determine
            our choice in giving it its preſent ſituation. How it ever came to be
            degraded into the rat or the mouſe I cannot conceive, for it no way
            reſembles them in ſize, being near as <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:51"/>

            hare; or in its diſpoſition, ſince no animal is more tractable nor more
            eaſily tamed.</p>
               <p>The Marmout is, as was ſaid, almoſt as big as an hare, but it
            is more corpulent than a cat, and has ſhorter legs. Its head pretty nearly
            re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles that of an hare, except that its ears are much ſhorter. It is
            cloathed all over with very long hair, and a ſhorter fur below. Theſe are
            of different colours, black and grey. The length of the hair gives the body the
            appearance of greater corpulence than it really has, and at the ſame time
            ſhortens the feet ſo that its belly ſeems touching the ground. Its tail
            is tufted and well furniſhed with hair, and it is carried in a ſtraight
            direction with its body. It has five claws behind and only four before. Theſe
            it uſes as the ſquirrel does, to carry its food to its mouth; and it
            uſually ſits upon its hinder parts to feed in the manner of that little
            animal.</p>
               <p>The marmout is chiefly a native of the Alps; and when taken young
            is tamed more eaſily than any other wild animal, and almoſt as perfectly as
            any of thoſe that are domeſtic<note n="*" place="bottom">Buffon, from whence

              <bibl>Ceſner, vol. xvii.</bibl>
                  </note>. It is readily taught to
            dance, to wield a cudgel, and to obey the voice of its maſter. Like the cat,
            it <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0823900104:54"/> has an antipathy to the dog; and when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
            familiar to the family, and is ſure of being ſupported by its maſter, it
            attacks and bites even the largeſt maſtiff. From its ſquat muſcular
            make, it has great ſtrength joined to great agility. It has four large
            cutting teeth, like all thoſe of the hare kind, but it uſes them to much
            more advantage, ſince in this animal they are very formidable weapons of
            defence. However, it is in general a very inoffenſive animal; and, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
            its enmity to dogs, ſeems to live in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with every creature,
            unleſs when provoked. If not prevented, it is very apt to gnaw the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
            of an houſe, and even to make holes through wooden partitions; from whence,
            perhaps, it has been compared to the rat. As its legs are very ſhort, and
            made ſomewhat like thoſe of a bear, it is often ſeen ſitting up, and
            even walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on its hind legs in like manner; but with the fore-paws, as was
            ſaid, it uſes to feed itſelf in the manner of a ſquirrel. Like all of
            the hare kind, it runs much ſwifter up hill than down; it climbs trees with
            great eaſe, and runs up the clefts of rocks, or the contiguous walls of
            houſes, with great facility. It is ludicrouſly ſaid that the Savoyards,
            who are the only chimney-ſweepers of Paris, have learned this

               <p>Theſe animals eat indiſcriminately of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is preſented
            to them; fleſh, bread, fruits, herbs, roots, pulſe, and inſects. But they
            are particularly fond of milk and butter. Although leſs inclined to petty
            thefts than the cat, yet they always try to ſteal into the dairy, where they
            lap up the milk like a cat, purring all the while like that animal, as an
            expreſſion of their being pleaſed. As to the reſt, milk is the only
            liquor they like. They ſeldom drink water, and refuſe wine. When pleaſed
            or careſſed, they often yelp like puppies; but when irritated or frighted,
            they have a piercing note that hurts the ear. They are very cleanly animals,
            and like the cat retire upon neceſſary occaſions; but their bodies have a
            diſagreeable ſcent, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the heat of ſummer. This tinctures
            their fleſh, which, being very fat and firm, would be very good, were not
            this flavour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways found to predominate.</p>
               <p>We have hitherto been deſcribing affections in this animal which
            it has in common with many others; but we now come to one which particularly
            diſtinguiſhes it from all others of this kind, and, indeed, from every
            other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupede except the bat and the dormouſe. <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0823900104:58"/> This
            is its ſleeping during the winter. The marmout, though a native of the

            nevertheleſs ſeems to feel the influence of the cold more than any other,
            and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner has all its faculties chilled up in winter. This extraordinary
            ſuſpenſion of life and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for more than half the year, deſerves
            our wonder, and excites our attention to conſider the manner of ſuch a
            temporary death, and the ſubſequent revival. But firſt to deſcribe,
            be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we attempt to diſcuſs.</p>
               <p>The marmout, uſually at the end of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, or the beginning
            of October, prepares to fit up its habitation for the winter, from which it is
            never ſeen to iſſue till about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or the middle of April.
            This animal's little retreat is made with great precaution, and fitted up with
            art. It is an hole on the ſide of a mountain, extremely deep, with a
            ſpacious apartment at the bottom, which is rather longer than it is broad. In
            this ſeveral marmouts can reſide at the ſame time, without crowding each
            other, or injuring the air they breathe. The feet and claws of this animal
            ſeem made for digging; and, in fact, they burrow into the ground with amazing
            facility, ſcraping up the <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0823900104:59"/> earth like a rabbit, and
            throwing back what they have thus looſened behind them. But the form of their
            hole is ſtill more wonderful; it reſembles the letter Y; the two branches
            being two openings, which conduct into one channel which terminates in their
            general apartment that lies at the bottom. As the whole is made on the
            declivity of a mountain, there is no part of it on a level but the apartment at
            the end. One of the branches or openings iſſues out, ſloping downwards;
            and this ſerves as a kind of ſink or drain to the whole family, where they
            make their excrements, and where the moiſture of the place is drawn away. The
            other branch, on the contrary, ſlopes upwards, and this ſerves as their
            door upon which to go out and in. The apartment at the end is very warmly
            ſtuccoed round with moſs and hay, of both which they make an ample
            proviſion dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſummer. As this is a work of great labour, ſo it is
            undertaken in common; ſome cut the fineſt graſs, others gather it, and
            others take their turns to drag it into their hole. Upon this occaſion, as we
            are told, one of them lies on its back, permits the hay to be heaped upon its
            belly, keeps its paws upright to make greater room; and in this manner, lying
            ſtill <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0823900104:60"/> upon its back, it is dragged by the tail, hay and
            all, to their common retreat. This alſo ſome give as a reaſon for the
            hair being generally worn away on their backs, as is uſually the caſe;
            how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a better reaſon for this may be aſſigned, from their
            continually rooting up holes and paſſing through narrow openings. But, be
            this as it will, certain it is that they all live together, and work in common
            to make their habitation as ſnug and convenient as poſſible. In it they
            paſs three parts of their lives; into it they retire when the ſtorm is
            high; in it they continue while it rains; there they remain when
            apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of danger, and never ſtir out except in fine weather, never
            going far from home even then. Whenever they venture abroad, one is placed as a
            centinel, ſitting upon a lofty rock, while the reſt amuſe themſelves in
            playing along the green fields, or are employed in cutting graſs and making
            hay for their winter's convenience. Their truſty centinel, when an enemy, a
            man, a dog, or a bird of prey, approaches, apprizes its companions with a
            whiſtle, upon which they all make home, the centinel himſelf bringing up
            the rear.</p>
               <p>But it muſt not be ſuppoſed that this hay is deſigned for
            proviſion; on the contrary, it is <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0823900104:61"/>

            found in as great plenty in their holes at the end as at the beginning of
            winter; it is only ſought for the convenience of their lodging, and the
            advantages of their young. As to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, they ſeem kindly apprized by
            Nature that during the winter that they ſhall not want any, ſo that they
            make no preparations for food, though ſo diligently employed in fitting up
            their abode. As ſoon as they perceive the firſt approaches of the winter,
            during which their vital motions are to continue in ſome meaſure
            ſuſpended, they labour very diligently to cloſe up the two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances of
            their habitation, which they effect with ſuch ſolidity, that it is eaſier
            to dig up the earth any where elſe than where they have cloſed it. At that
            time they are very fat, and ſome of them are found to weigh above twenty
            pounds; they continue ſo for even three months more; but by degrees their
            fleſh begins to waſte, and they are uſually very lean by the end of
            winter. When their retreat is opened, the whole family is then diſcovered,
            each rolled into a ball, and covered up under the hay. In this ſtate they
            ſeem entirely lifeleſs; they may be taken away, and even killed without
            their teſtifying any great pain; and thoſe who find them in this manner
            carry them home in order <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0823900104:64"/> to breed up the young and eat the
            old ones. A gradual and gentle warmth revives them; but they would die if too
            ſuddenly brought near the fire, or if their juices were too quickly
            li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quefied.</p>
               <p>Strictly ſpeaking, ſays Mr. Buffon, theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals cannot be
            ſaid to ſleep during the winter; it may be called rather a torpor, a
            ſtagnation of all the faculties<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon, vol.
                xvi. Loir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>. This
            torpor is produced by the congelation of their blood, which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally much
            colder than that of all other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupedes. The uſual heat of man and other
            animals is about thirty degrees above congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the heat of theſe is not
            above ten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Their internal heat is ſeldom greater than that of the
            temperature of the air. This has been often tried by plunging the ball of the
            thermometer into the body of a living dormouſe, and it never roſe beyond
            its uſual pitch in air, and ſometimes it ſunk above a degree. It is not
            ſurprizing, therefore, that theſe animals, whoſe blood is ſo cold
            naturally, ſhould become torpid, when the external cold is too powerful for
            the ſmall quantity of heat in their bodies, yet remaining; and this always
            happens when the thermometer is not more than ten degrees <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0823900104:65"/>
            above congelation. This coldneſs Mr. Buffon has experienced in the blood of
            the bat, the dormouſe, and the hedge-hog, and with great juſtice he extends
            the analogy to the marmout, which like the reſt is ſeen to ſleep all the
            winter. This torpid ſtate continues as long as the cauſe which produces it
            continues; and it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that it might be lengthened out beyond its
            uſual term, by artificially prolonging the cold; if, for inſtance, the
            animal were rolled up in wool, and placed in a cold cellar, nearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
            to, but not quite ſo cold as an ice-houſe, for that would kill them
            outright, it would remain perhaps a whole year in its ſtate of
            inſenſibility. However this be, if the heat of the air be above ten
            degrees, theſe animals are ſeen to revive; and, if it be continued in that
            degree of temperature, they do not become torpid, but eat and ſleep at proper
            intervals like all other quadrupedes whatever.</p>
               <p>From the above account we may form ſome conception of the
            ſtate in which theſe animals continue during the winter. As in ſome
            diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders where the circulation is extremely lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid, the appetite is
            diminiſhed in proportion, ſo in theſe the blood ſcarcely moving, or
            only moving in the greater veſſels, they want no <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0823900104:66"/>
            nouriſhment to repair what is worn away by its motions. They are ſeen,
            indeed, by ſlow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to become leaner in proportion to the ſlow
            attrition of their fluids; but this is not perceptible except at the end of
            ſome months. Man is often known to gather nouriſhment from the ambient air;
            and theſe alſo may in ſome meaſure be ſupplied in the ſame manner;
            and, having ſufficient motion in their fluids to keep them from putrefaction,
            and juſt ſufficient nouriſhment to ſupply the waſte of their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid
            circulation, they continue rather feebly alive than ſleeping.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals produce but once a year, and uſually bring forth
            but three or four at a time. They grow very faſt, and the extent of their
            lives is not above nine or ten years; ſo that the ſpecies is neither
            numerous nor very much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. They are chiefly found in the Alps, where
            they ſeem to prefer the brow of the higheſt mountains to the loweſt
            ranges, and the ſunny ſide to that in the ſhade. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the
            country where they chiefly reſide, when they obſerve the hole, generally
            ſtay till winter before they think proper to open it; for if they begin too
            ſoon, the animal wakes, and, as it has a ſurprizing faculty of digging, 
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0823900104:67"/> makes its hole deeper in proportion as they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Such
            as kill it for food, uſe every art to improve the fleſh, which is ſaid to
            have a wild taſte and to cauſe vomitings<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. They, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, take away the fat, which is in great
            abundance, and ſalt the remainder, drying it ſomewhat in the manner of
            bacon. Still, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is ſaid to be very indifferent eating. This animal
            is found in Poland under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of the Bobak, entirely reſembling
            that of the Alps, except that the latter has a toe more upon its fore-feet than
            the former. It is found alſo in Siberia under the name of the Jevraſka,
            being rather ſmaller than either of the other two. Laſtly, it is found in
            Canada by the appellation of the Monax, differing only from the reſt in
            having a blueiſh ſnout and a longer tail.</p>

                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0823900104:71"/> require a
            particular deſcription. The firſt of theſe, and that the largeſt, as
            was hinted above, is called the Agouti. This animal is found in great abundance
            in the ſouthern parts of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and has by ſome been called the rabbit
            of that continent. But, tho' in many reſpects it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the rabbit, yet
            ſtill in many more it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and is, without all doubt, an animal
            pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the new world only. The agouti is about the ſize of a rabbit,
            and has a head very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling it, except that the ears are very
            ſhort in compariſon. It reſembles the rabbit alſo in the arched form of
            its back, in the hind legs being longer than the fore, and in having four great
            cutting teeth, two above and two below; but then it differs in the nature of
            its hair, which is not ſoft and downy as in the rabbit, but hard and
            briſtly like that of a ſucking pig, and of a reddiſh brown colour. It
            differs alſo in the tail, which is even ſhorter than in the rabbit, and
            entirely deſtitute of hair. Laſtly, it differs in the number of its toes,
            having but three on the hinder feet, whereas the rabbit has five. All theſe
            diſtinctions, however, do not countervail againſt its general form, which
            reſembles that of a rabbit, and moſt travellers have called it by that
            name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0823900104:72"/>As this animal differs in form, it differs
            ſtill more in habitudes and diſpoſition. As it has the hair of an hog,
            ſo alſo it has its voraciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon.</bibl>
                  </note>. It eats indiſcriminately of all
            things; and, when ſatiated, hides the remainder, like the dog or the fox, for
            a future occaſion. It takes a pleaſure in gnawing and ſpoiling every
            thing it comes near. When irritated, its hair ſtands erect along the back,
            and, like the rabbit, it ſtrikes the ground violently with its hind feet. It
            does not dig an hole in the ground, but bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in the hollows of trees. Its
            ordinary food conſiſts of the roots of the country, potatoes and yams, and
            ſuch fruits as fall from the trees in autumn. It uſes its fore-paws like
            the ſquirrel, to carry its food to its mouth; and as its hind feet are longer
            than the fore, it runs very ſwiftly upon plain ground or up a hill, but upon
            a deſcent it is in danger of falling. Its ſight is excellent, and its
            hearing equals that of any other animal; whenever it is whiſtled to it
            ſtops to hearken. The fleſh of ſuch as are fat and well fed is tolerable
            food, although it has a peculiar taſte and is a little tough. The French
            dreſs it like a ſucking pig, as we learn from Mr. Buffon's account; but the
            Engliſh dreſs it with a pudding in its belly, like an <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0823900104:73"/>
            hare. It is hunted by dogs; and whenever it is got into a ſugar ground, where
            the canes cover the place, it is eaſily overtaken, for it is embarraſſed
            every ſtep it takes, ſo that a man may eaſily come up with it without any
            other aſſiſtance. When in the open country, it uſually runs with great
            ſwiftneſs before the dogs until it gains its retreat, within which it
            con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to hide, and nothing but filling the hole with ſmoke can force it
            out. For this purpoſe the hunter burns faggots or ſtraw at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
            and conducts the ſmoke in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that it fills the whole cavity.
            While this is doing, the poor little animal ſeems ſenſible of its danger,
            and begs for quarter with a moſt plaintive cry, ſeldom quitting its hole
            till the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extremity. At laſt, when half ſuffocated, it iſſues
            out, and truſts once more to its ſpeed for protection. When ſtill forced
            by the dogs, and incapable of making good a retreat, it turns upon the hunters,
            and with its hair briſtling like an hog, and ſtanding upon its hind feet,
            it defends itſelf very obſtinately. Sometimes it bites the legs of thoſe
            that attempt to take it, and will take out the piece wherever it fixes its
            teeth<note n="*" place="bottom">

            tamed, continues to play harmleſsly about the houſe, and goes out and
            returns of its own accord. In a ſavage ſtate it uſually continues in the
            woods, and the female generally chuſes the moſt obſcure parts to bring
            forth her young. She there prepares a bed of leaves and dry graſs, and
            generally brings forth two at a time. She breeds twice or thrice a year, and
            carries her young from one place to another, as convenience requires, in the
            man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a cat. She generally lodges them when three days old in the hollow
            of a tree, ſuckling them but for a very ſhort time, for they ſoon come to

            like the agouti, although it differs in ſeveral particulars. <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:75"/>

                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0823900104:76"/> Like the agouti, it is covered
            rather with coarſe hair than a downy fur. But then it is beautifully marked
            along the ſides with ſmall aſh coloured ſpots, upon an amber coloured
            ground; whereas the agouti is pretty much of one reddiſh colour. The paca is
            rather more thick and corpulent than the agouti; its noſe is ſhorter, and
            its hind feet have five toes; whereas the agouti has but three. As to the
            reſt, this animal bears ſome diſtant reſemblance to a rabbit, the ears
            are naked of hair and ſomewhat ſharp, the lower jaw is ſomewhat longer
            than the upper, the teeth, the ſhape of the head and the ſize of it, are
            like to thoſe of a rabbit. It has a ſhort tail likewiſe, though not
            tufted, and its hinder legs are longer than the fore. It alſo burrows in the
            ground like that animal, and from this ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude alone travellers might
            have given it the name.</p>
               <p>The paca does not make uſe of its fore-paws, like the ſquirrel
            or the agouti, to carry its food to the mouth, but hunts for it on the ground,
            and roots like an hog. It is generally ſeen along the banks of rivers, and is
            only to be found in the moiſt and warm countries of South America. It is a
            very fat animal, and in this reſpect much preferable to the agouti, that is
            moſt commonly <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:77"/>

                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0823900104:79"/> found lean. It is eaten, ſkin and all, like a young pig,
            and is conſidered as a great delicacy. Like the former little animal, it
            defends itſelf to the laſt extremity, and is very ſeldom taken alive. It
            is perſecuted not only by man, but by every beaſt and bird of prey, who all
            watch its motions, and, if it ventures at any diſtance from its hole, are
            ſure to ſeize it. But although the race of theſe little animals is thus
            con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually deſtroyed, it finds ſome refuge in its hole, from the general
            combination; and breeds in ſuch numbers, that the diminution is not
            perceptible.</p>
               <p>To theſe animals may be added others, very ſimilar both in
            form and diſpoſition; each known by its particular name in its native
            country, but which travellers have been contented to call rabbits or hares; of
            which we have but indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct notice. The Tapeti, or the Braſilian rabbit,
            is in ſhape like our Engliſh ones, but is much leſs, being ſaid to be
            not above twice the ſize of a dormouſe. It is reddiſh on the forehead,
            and a little whitiſh under the throat. It is remarkable for having no tail;
            but it has long ears and whiſkers, like our rabbits, and black eyes. It does
            not burrow, like ours; but lives at large, like the hare.</p>
               <p>The Aperea is alſo called by ſome the Braſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian 
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0823900104:80"/> rabbit, being an animal that ſeems to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the
            nature of a rabbit and a rat. The ears are like thoſe of a rat, being ſhort
            and round; but the other parts are like thoſe of a rabbit, except that it has
            but three toes on the hinder legs, like the Agouti.</p>
               <p>To theſe imperfect ſketches of animals little known, others
            leſs known might be added; for as Nature becomes more diminutive, her
            operations are leſs attentively regarded. I ſhall only, therefore, add one
            animal more to this claſs, and that very well known; I mean the Guinea pig;
            which Briſſon places among thoſe of the rabbit kind; and as I do not know
            any other ſet of animals with which it can be ſo well compared, I will take
            leave to follow his example.</p>

               <head>THE GUINEA-PIG.</head>
               <p>THE Guinea-Pig is a native of the warmer climates; but has been
            ſo long rendered do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic, and ſo widely diffuſed, that it is now
            become common in every part of the world. There are few unacquainted with the
            figure of this little animal; in ſome places it is conſidered as the
            principal favourite; and is often found <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0823900104:81"/> even to diſplace
            the lap-dog. It is leſs than a rabbit, and its legs are ſhorter; they are
            ſcarce ſeen, except when it moves; and the neck, alſo, is ſo ſhort,
            that the head ſeems ſtuck upon the ſhoulders. The ears are ſhort, thin
            and tranſparent; the hair is like that of a ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pig, from whence it
            has taken the name; and it wants even the veſtiges of a tail. In other
            reſpects, it has ſome ſimilitude to the rabbit. When it moves, its body
            lengthens like that animal; and when it is at reſt, it ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers up in the
            ſame manner. Its noſe is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the rabbit lip, except that its
            noſtrils are much farther aſunder. Like all other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals in a domeſtic
            ſtate, its colours are different; ſome are white, ſome are red, and
            others both red and white. It differs from the rabbit in the number of its
            toes, having four toes on the feet before, and but three on thoſe behind. It
            ſtrokes its head with the fore feet like the rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit; and, like it, ſits
            upon the hind feet; for which purpoſe there is a naked callous ſkin on the
            back part of the legs and feet.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals are of all others the moſt helpleſs and

            They are ſcarce poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of courage ſufficient to defend

            mouſe. Their only animoſity is exerted againſt each other; for they will
            often fight very obſtinately; and the ſtronger is often known to deſtroy
            the weaker. But againſt all other aggreſſors, their only remedy is
            patience and non-reſiſtance. How, therefore, theſe animals, in a ſavage
            ſtate, could contrive to protect themſelves, I have not been able to learn;
            as they want ſtrength, ſwiftneſs, and even the natural inſtinct ſo
            common to almoſt every other creature.</p>
               <p>As to their manner of living among us, they owe their lives
            entirely to our unceaſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. They muſt be conſtantly attended,
            ſhielded from the exceſſive colds of the winter, and ſecured againſt
            all other domeſtic animals, which are apt to attack them, from every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
            either of appetite, jealouſy, or experience of their puſillanimous nature.
            Such indeed is their ſtupidity, that they ſuffer themſelves to be
            devoured by the cats, without reſiſtance; and, different from all other
            creatures, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſees her young deſtroyed without once attempting to
            protect them. Their uſual food is bran, parſley, or cabbage leaves; but
            there is ſcarce a vegetable cultivated in our gardens that they will not
            gladly devour. The carrot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top is a peculiar dainty; as alſo ſallad; and 
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0823900104:83"/> thoſe who would preſerve their healths, would do right
            to vary their food; for if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued on a kind too ſucculent or too
            dry, the effects are quickly perceived upon their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. When fed
            upon recent vegetables, they ſeldom drink. But it often happens that,
            conducted by nature, they ſeek dryer food, when the former diſagrees with
            them. They then gnaw cloaths, paper, or whatever of this kind they meet with;
            and, on theſe occaſions, they are ſeen to drink like moſt other
            animals, which they do by lapping. They are chiefly fond of new milk; but, in
            caſe of neceſſity, are contented with water.</p>
               <p>They move pretty much in the manner of rabbits, though not near
            ſo ſwiftly; and when confined in a room, ſeldom croſs the floor, but
            generally keep along the wall. The male uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally drives the female on before
            him, for they never move a-breaſt together; but conſtantly the one ſeems
            to tread in the footſteps of the preceding. They chiefly ſeek for the
            darkeſt receſſes, and the moſt intricate retreats; where, if hay be
            ſpread as a bed for them, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to ſleep together, and ſeldom
            venture out but when they ſuppoſe all interruption removed. On thoſe
            occaſions they act as rabbits; they ſwiftly move forward from their bed,
            ſtop at <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0823900104:84"/> the entrance, liſten, look round, and, if they
            perceive the ſlighteſt approach of danger, they run back with
            precipitation. In very cold weather, however, they are more active, and run
            about in order to keep themſelves warm.</p>
               <p>They are a very cleanly animal, and very different from that
            whoſe name they go by. If the young ones happen to fall into the dirt, or be
            any other way diſcompoſed, the female takes ſuch an averſion to them
            that ſhe never permits them to viſit her more. Indeed, her whole
            employment, as well as that of the male, ſeems to conſiſt in ſmoothing
            their ſkins, in diſpoſing their hair, and improving its gloſs. The male
            and female take this office by turns; and when they have thus bruſhed up each
            other, they then beſtow all their concern upon their young, taking particular
            care to make their hair lie ſmooth, and biting them if they appear
            refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. As they are ſo ſolicitous for elegance themſelves, the place
            where they are kept, muſt be regularly cleaned, and a new bed of hay provided
            for them at leaſt every week. Being natives of a warm climate, they are
            naturally chilly in ours: cleanlineſs, therefore, aſſiſts warmth, and
            expels moiſture. They may be thus reared, without the aid of any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
            heat; but, in general, there is no keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0823900104:85"/> them from the
            fire in winter, if they be once permitted to approach it.</p>
               <p>When they go to ſleep, they lie flat on their bellies, pretty
            much in their uſual poſture; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that they love to have their fore feet
            higher than their hinder. For this purpoſe, they turn themſelves ſeveral
            times round before they lie down, to find the moſt convenient ſituation.
            They ſleep, like the hare, with their eyes half open; and continue extremely
            watchful, if they ſuſpect danger. The male and female are never ſeen both
            aſleep at the ſame time; but while he enjoys his repoſe, ſhe remains
            upon the watch, ſilently continuing to guard him, and her head turned towards
            the place where he lies. When ſhe ſuppoſes that he has had his turn,
            ſhe then awakes him with a kind of murmuring noiſe, goes to him, forces him
            from his bed, and lies down in his place. He then performs the ſame good turn
            for her; and continues watchful till ſhe alſo has done ſleeping.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals are exceedingly ſalacious, and generally are
            capable of coupling at ſix weeks old. The female never goes with young above
            five weeks; and uſually brings forth from three to five at a time; and this
            not without pain. But what is very extraordinary, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male 
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0823900104:86"/> admits the male the very day ſhe has brought forth, and
            becomes again pregnant; ſo that their multiplication is aſtoniſhing. She
            ſuckles her young but about twelve or fifteen days; and during that time does
            not ſeem to know her own; for if the young of any other be brought, though
            much older, ſhe never drives them away, but ſuffers them even to drain her,
            to the diſadvantage of her own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate offspring. They are produced with
            the eyes open, like all others of the hare kind; and in about twelve hours,
            equal even to the dam in agility. Although the dam has but two teats, yet ſhe
            abundantly ſupplies them with milk: and they are alſo capable of feeding
            upon vegetables, almoſt from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. If the young ones are
            permitted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue together, the ſtronger, as in all other ſocieties,
            ſoon begins to govern the weak. Their contentions are often long and
            obſtinate; and their jealouſies very apparent. Their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes are
            uſually for the warmeſt place, or the moſt agreeable food. If one of them
            happens to be more fortunate in this reſpect than the reſt, the
            ſtrongeſt generally comes to diſpoſſeſs it of its advantageous
            ſituation. Their manner of fighting, though terrible to them, is ridiculous
            enough to a ſpectator. One of them ſeizes the <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0823900104:87"/> hair on
            the nape of the other's neck with its fore teeth, and attempts to tear it away;
            the other, to retaliate, turns its hinder parts to the enemy, and kicks up
            behind like an horſe, and with its hinder claws ſcratches the ſides of
            its adverſary; ſo that ſometimes they cover each other with blood. When
            they contend in this manner, they gnaſh their teeth pretty loudly; and this
            is often a denunciation of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reſentment.</p>
               <p>Theſe, though ſo formidable to each other, yet are the moſt
            timorous creatures upon earth, with reſpect to the reſt of animated nature:
            a falling leaf diſturbs them, and every animal over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them. From hence
            they are difficultly tamed; and will ſuffer none to approach them, except the
            perſon by whom they are fed. Their manner of eating is ſomething like that
            of the rabbit; and, like it, they appear alſo to chew the cud. Although they
            ſeldom drink, they make water every minute. They grunt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a
            young pig; and have a more pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing note to expreſs pain. In a word, they do
            no injury; but then, except the pleaſure they afford the ſpectator, they
            are of very little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to mankind. Some, indeed, dreſs and eat them; but
            their fleſh is indifferent food, and by no means a reward for the trouble of
            rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:88"/>

            <head>CHAP. II. Of Animals of the Rat Kind.</head>
            <p>WERE it neceſſary to diſtinguiſh animals of the rat kind
          from all others, we might deſcribe them as having two large cutting teeth,
          like the hare kind, in each jaw; as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with hair; and as not ruminating.
          Theſe diſtinctions might ſerve to guide us, had we not too near an
          acquaintance with this noxious race to be miſtaken in their kind. Their
          numbers, their minuteneſs, their vicinity, their vaſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication, all
          ſufficiently contribute to preſs them upon our obſervation, and remind us
          of their exiſtence. Indeed, if we look through the different ranks of
          animals, from the largeſt to the ſmalleſt, from the great elephant to the
          diminutive mouſe, we ſhall find that we ſuffer greater injuries from the
          contemptible mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the one, than the formidable invaſions of the
          other. Againſt the elephant, the rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noceros, or the lion, we can oppoſe
          united ſtrength; and by art make up the deficiencies of natural power:
          theſe we have driven into their native ſolitudes, and obliged to continue
          at a diſtance, in the moſt inconvenient regions and unhealthful climates.
          But it is otherwiſe <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0823900104:93"/> with the little teizing race I am
          now deſcribing: no force can be exerted againſt their unreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
          timidity; no arts can diminiſh their amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propagation: millions may be at
          once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and yet the breach be repaired in the ſpace of a very few
          weeks; and, in proportion as Nature has denied them force, it has ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
          the defect by their fecundity.</p>
            <p>Of theſe, the animal beſt known at preſent, and in every
          reſpect the moſt miſchievous, is the Great Rat; which, though but a new
          comer into this country, has taken too ſecure a poſſeſſion to be ever
          removed. This hateful and rapacious creature, though ſometimes called the Rat
          of Norway, is utterly unknown in all the northern countries, and, by the beſt
          accounts I can learn, comes originally from the Levant. Its firſt arrival, as
          I am aſſured, was upon the coaſts of Ireland, in thoſe ſhips that
          traded in proviſions to Gibraltar; and perhaps we owe to a ſingle pair of
          theſe animals, the numerous progeny that now infeſts the whole extent of
          the Britiſh Empire.</p>
            <p>This animal, which is called by Mr. Buffon the Surmalot, is in
          length about nine inches; its eyes are large and black; the colour of the head,
          and the whole upper part of the body, is of a light brown, mixed with tawny and
          aſh colour. The <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0823900104:94"/> end of the noſe, the throat and belly,
          are of a dirty white, inclining to a grey; the feet and legs are almoſt bare,
          and of a dirty pale fleſh colour; the tail is as long as the body, covered
          with minute duſky ſcales, mixed with a few hairs, and adds to the general
          deformity of its deteſtable figure. It is chiefly in the colour that this
          animal differs from the Black Rat, or the Common Rat, as it was once called;
          but now common no longer. This new invader, in a very few years after its
          arrival, found means to deſtroy almoſt the whole ſpecies, and to
          poſſeſs itſelf of their retreats.</p>
            <p>But it was not againſt the Black Rat alone that its rapacity was
          directed; all other animals of inferior ſtrength ſhared the ſame
          misfortunes. The conteſt with the black rat was of ſhort continuance. As it
          was unable to contend, and had no holes to fly to for retreat, but where its
          voracious enemy could purſue, the whole race was ſoon extinguiſhed. The
          Frog alſo was an animal equally incapable of combat or defence. It had been
          deſignedly introduced into the kingdom of Ireland ſome years before the
          Norway rat; and it was ſeen to multiply amazingly. The inhabitants were
          pleaſed with the propagation of an harmleſs animal, that ſerved to rid
          their fields of inſects; and even <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0823900104:95"/> the prejudices of the
          people were in its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as they ſuppoſed that the frog contributed to
          render their waters more wholeſome. But the Norway rat ſoon put a ſtop to
          their encreaſe; as theſe animals were of an amphibious nature, they
          purſued the frog to its lakes and took it even in its own natural element. I
          am, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, aſſured, that the frog is once more almoſt extinct in
          that kingdom; and that the Norway rat, having no more enemies left there to
          deſtroy, is grown leſs numerous alſo.</p>
            <p>We are not likely, therefore, to gain by the deſtruction of our
          old domeſtics, ſince they are replaced by ſuch miſchievous
          ſucceſſors. The Norway rat has the ſame diſpoſition to injure us,
          with much greater power of miſchief. It burrows in the banks of rivers,
          ponds, and ditches; and is every year known to do incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible damage to thoſe
          mounds that are raiſed to conduct ſtreams, or to prevent rivers from
          overflowing. In theſe holes, which it forms pretty near the edge of the
          water, it chiefly reſides during the ſummer, where it lives upon ſmall
          animals, fiſh, and corn. At the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of winter, it comes nearer the farm
          houſes; burrows in their corn, eats much, and damages ſtill more than it
          conſumes. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can be eaten, ſeems to eſcape its 
          <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0823900104:96"/> voracity. It deſtroys rabbits, poultry, and all kinds of
          game; and, like the polecat, kills much more than it can carry away. It ſwims
          with great eaſe, dives with great celerity, and eaſily thins the fiſh
          pond. In ſhort, ſcarce any of the feebler animals eſcape its rapacity,
          ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the mouſe, which ſhelters itſelf in its little hole, where the
          Norway rat is too big to follow.</p>
            <p>Theſe animals frequently produce from fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen to thirty at a
          time<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Buffon, vol. xvii. p. 2.</bibl>
               </note>; and
          uſually bring forth three times a year. This great encreaſe would quickly
          be found to overrun the whole country, and render our aſſiduity to
          deſtroy them fruitleſs, were it not, happily for us, that they eat and
          deſtroy each other. The ſame inſatiable appetite that impels them to
          indiſcriminate carnage, alſo incites the ſtrongeſt to devour the
          weakeſt, even of their own kind. The large male rat generally keeps in an
          hole by itſelf, and is as dreaded by its own ſpecies, as the moſt
          formidable enemies. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the number of theſe vermin is kept within
          due bounds; and when their encreaſe becomes injurious to us, it is
          repreſſed by their own ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0823900104:97"/>But beſide their own enmities among each
          other, all the ſtronger carnivorous quadrupedes have natural antipathies
          againſt them. The dog, though he deteſts their fleſh, yet openly declares
          his alacrity to purſue them; and attacks them with great animoſity. Such as
          are trained up to killing theſe vermin, diſpatch them often with a ſingle
          ſqueeze: but thoſe dogs that ſhew any heſitation, are ſure to come
          off but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently; for the rat always takes the advantage of a moment's
          delay, and, inſtead of waiting for the attack, becomes the aggreſſor,
          ſeizing its purſuer by the lip, and inflicting a very painful and dangerous
          wound. From the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and other angry ſymptoms that attend this
          animal's bite, ſome have been led to think that it was in ſome meaſure
          venemous; but it is likely that the difficulty of the wound's healing, ariſes
          merely from its being deep and lacerated by the teeth, and is rather a
          con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the figure of the inſtruments that inflict it, than any
          venom they may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to poſſeſs.</p>
            <p>The cat is another formidable enemy of this kind; and yet the
          generality of our cats neither care to attack it, nor to feed upon it when
          killed. The cat is a more prudent hunter than the dog, and will not be at the
          pains to take <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0823900104:98"/> or combat with an enemy that is not likely
          to repay her time and danger. Some cats, however, will purſue and take the
          rat; though often not without an obſtinate reſiſtance. If hungry alſo,
          the cat will ſometimes eat the head; but, in general, ſhe is merely content
          with her victory.</p>
            <p>A foe much more dangerous to theſe vermin is the weaſel. This
          animal purſues them with avidity; and being pretty nearly of their own
          ſize, follows them into their holes, where a deſperate combat enſues. The
          ſtrength of each is pretty near equal; but the arms are very different. The
          rat, furniſhed with four long tuſks at the extremity of its jaw, rather
          ſnaps than bites; but the weaſel, where it once faſtens, holds, and
          continuing alſo to ſuck the blood at the ſame time, weakens its
          antagoniſt, and always obtains the victory. Mankind have contrived ſeveral
          other methods of deſtroying theſe noxious intruders; ferrets, traps, and
          par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly poiſon: but of all other poiſons, I am told that the nux
          vomica, ground and mixed with meal, is the moſt certain, as it is the leaſt
          dangerous.</p>
            <p>To this ſpecies I will ſubjoin as a variety, the Black Rat,
          mentioned above, greatly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the former in figure, but very
          diſtinct in <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0823900104:99"/> nature, as appears from their mutual
          antipathy. This animal was formerly as miſchievous as it was common; but at
          preſent it is almoſt ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly extirpated by the great rat, one malady often
          expelling another. It is become ſo ſcarce, that I do not remember ever to
          have ſeen one. It is ſaid to be poſſeſſed of all the voracious and
          unnatural appetites of the former; though, as it is leſs, they may probably
          be leſs noxious. Its length is about ſeven inches; and the tail is near
          eight inches long. The colour of the body is of a deep iron grey, bordering
          upon black, except the belly, which is of a dirty cinereous hue. They have
          propagated in America in great numbers, being originally introduced from
          Europe; and as they ſeem to keep their ground wherever they get footing, they
          are now become the moſt noxious animals in that part of the world.</p>
            <p>To this alſo we may ſubjoin the Black Water Rat, about the
          ſame ſize with the latter, with a larger head, a blunter noſe, leſs
          eyes, and ſhorter ears, and the tip of its tail a little white. It was
          ſuppoſed by Ray to be web footed; but this has been found to be a
          miſtake, its toes pretty much reſembling thoſe of its kind. It never
          frequents houſes; but is uſually found on the banks of rivers, ditches and
          ponds, where <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0823900104:100"/> it burrows and breeds. It feeds on fiſh,
          frogs, and inſects; and in ſome countries it is eat on faſting days.</p>

               <head>THE MOUSE.</head>
               <p>AN animal equally miſchievous, and equally well known with the
            former, is the mouſe. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid, cautious and active, all its diſpoſitions
            are ſimilar to thoſe of the rat, except with fewer powers of doing

            attends upon mankind, and comes an unbidden gueſt to his moſt delicate

            never leaves its hole but to ſeek proviſion, and ſeldom ventures above a
            few paces from home. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the rat, it does not go from one houſe
            to another, unleſs it be forced; and, as it is more eaſily ſatisfied, it

               <p>Almoſt all animals are tamed more difficultly in proportion to
            the cowardice of their natures. The truly bold and courageous eaſily become
            familiar, but thoſe that are always fearful are ever ſuſpicious. The
            mouſe being the moſt feeble, and conſequently the moſt timid of all

            thoroughly familiar; and, even though fed in a cage, retains its natural

               <p>The mouſe brings forth at all ſeaſons, and ſeveral times

            Ariſtotle gives us an idea of their prodigious fecundity, by aſſuring us
            that, having put a mouſe with young into a veſſel of corn, in ſome time
            after he found an hundred and twenty mice, all ſprung from one original. The

            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0823900104:102"/> of its life, which ſeldom laſts above two or three

            are animals that, while they fear human ſociety, cloſely attend it; and,

            fruſtrate the humble ambition of thoſe who would be thought the inventors
            of a mouſe-trap.</p>
               <p>To this ſpecies, merely to avoid teizing the reader with a
            minute deſcription of animals very inconſiderable and very nearly alike, I
            will add that of the <hi>long tail'd field mouſe,</hi> which is larger than
            the former, of a colour very nearly reſembling the Norway rat, and chiefly
            found in fields and gardens. They are extremely vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racious, and hurtful in
            gardens and young nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0823900104:103"/> where they are killed in
            great numbers. However, their fecundity quickly repairs the deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Nearly reſembling the former, but larger, (for it is ſix
            inches long) is the <hi>ſhort tailed field mouſe</hi>; which, as its name
            implies, has the tail much ſhorter than the former, it being not above an
            inch and an half long, and ending in a ſmall tuft. Its colour is more
            inclining to that of the domeſtic mouſe, the upper part being blackiſh
            and the under of an aſh colour. This, as well as the former, are remarkable
            for laying up proviſion againſt winter; and Mr. Buffon aſſures us they
            ſometimes have a ſtore of above a buſhel at a time.</p>
               <p>We may add alſo the <hi>ſhrew mouſe</hi> to this ſpecies
            of minute animals, being about the ſize of the domeſtic mouſe, but
            differing greatly from it in the form of its noſe, which is very long and
            ſlender. The teeth alſo are of a very ſingular form, and twenty-eight in
            number; whereas the common number in the rat kind is uſually not above
            ſixteen. The two upper fore teeth are very ſharp, and on each ſide of
            them there is a kind of wing or beard, like that of an arrow, ſcarce
            viſible but on a cloſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection. The other teeth are placed cloſe

            ſeparated; ſo that with reſpect to this part of its formation, the animal
            has ſome reſemblance to the viper. However, it is a very harmleſs little
            creature, doing ſcarce any injury. On the contrary, as it lives chiefly in
            the fields, and feeds more upon inſects than corn, it may be conſidered
            rather as a friend than an enemy. It has a ſtrong diſagreeable ſmell,
            ſo that the cat, when it is killed, will refuſe to eat it. It is ſaid to

               <head>THE DORMOUSE.</head>
               <p>THESE animals may be diſtinguiſhed into three kinds; the
            <hi>greater dormouſe,</hi> which Mr. Buffon calls the Loir; the

            denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the Muſcardin. They differ from each other in ſize, the
            largeſt being equal to a rat, the leaſt being no bigger than a mouſe.
            They all differ from the rat in having the tail tufted with hair, in the manner
            of a ſquirrel, except that the ſquirrel's tail is flat, reſembling a fan;
            and theirs round, reſembling a bruſh. The lerot differs from the loir by
            having two black ſpots near the eyes; the muſcardin differs from both in
            the whitiſh colour of its hair on <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0823900104:105"/> the back. They all
            three agree in having black ſparkling eyes, and the whiſkers partly white
            and partly black. They agree in their being ſtupefied like the marmout during
            the winter, and in their hoarding up proviſions to ſerve them in caſe of
            a temporary revival.</p>
               <p>They inhabit woods or very thick hedges, forming their neſts in
            the hollow of ſome tree, or near the bottom of a cloſe ſhrub, humbly
            content with continuing at the bottom, and never aſpiring to ſport among
            the branches. Towards the approach of the cold ſeaſon they form a little
            magazine of nuts, beans, or acorns; and, having laid in their hoard, ſhut
            themſelves up with it for the winter. As ſoon as they feel the firſt
            advances of the cold they prepare to leſſen its effect, by rolling
            themſelves up in a ball, and thus expoſing the ſmalleſt ſurface to
            the weather. But it often happens that the warmth of a ſunny day, or an
            accidental change from cold to heat, thaws their nearly ſtagnant fluids, and
            they revive. On ſuch occaſions they have their proviſions laid in, and
            they have not far to ſeek for their ſupport. In this manner they continue
            uſually aſleep, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times waking, for above five months in the year,
            ſeldom venturing from their retreats, and conſequently but rarely ſeen.

               <p>OF theſe animals of the rat kind, but with a muſky ſmell,
            there are alſo three diſtinctions, as of the former; the Ondatra, the

            all others of its kind, in having the tail flatted and carried edge-ways. The
            deſman has a long extended ſnout like the ſhrew mouſe; and the pilori a
            ſhort tail, as thick at one end as the other. They all reſemble each other
            in being fond of the water, but particularly in that muſky odour from whence
            they have taken their name.</p>
               <p>Of theſe, the Ondatra is the moſt remarkable, and has been the
            moſt minutely deſcribed<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. This animal is about the ſize of a ſmall rabbit, but has
            the hair, the colour, and the tail of a rat, except that it is flatted on the
            ſides, as mentioned above. But it is ſtill more extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary upon other
            accounts, and different from all other animals whatever. It is ſo formed that
            it can <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0823900104:107"/> contract and enlarge its body at pleaſure. It
            has a muſcle like that of horſes, by which they move, their hides lying
            immediately under the ſkin, and that furniſhed with ſuch a power of
            con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, together with ſuch an elaſticity in the falſe ribs, that
            this animal can creep into an hole where others, ſeemingly much leſs,
            cannot follow. The female is remarkable alſo for two diſtinct apertures,
            one for urine, the other for propagation. The male is equally obſervable for
            a peculiarity of conformation; the muſky ſmell is much ſtronger at one
            particular ſeaſon of the year than any other; and the marks of the ſex
            ſeem to appear and diſappear in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>The ondatra in ſome meaſure reſembles the beaver in its
            nature and diſpoſition. They both live in ſociety during winter; they
            both form houſes of two feet and an half wide, in which they reſide
            ſeveral families together. In theſe they do not aſſemble to ſleep as
            the marmout, but purely to ſhelter themſelves from the rigour of the
            ſeaſon. However, they do not lay up magazines of proviſion like the
            beaver; they only form a kind of covert way to and round their dwelling, from
            whence they iſſue to procure water and roots, upon which they
            ſubſiſt. During winter their houſes are covered under a depth of eight 
            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0823900104:108"/> or ten feet of ſnow; ſo that they muſt lead but a
            cold, gloomy and a neceſſitous life, during its continuance. During
            ſummer they ſeparate two by two, and feed upon the variety of roots and
            vegetables that the ſeaſon offers. They then become extremely fat, and are
            much ſought after, as well for their fleſh as their ſkins, which are very
            valuable. They then alſo acquire a very ſtrong ſcent of muſk, ſo
            pleaſing to an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean, but which the ſavages of Canada cannot abide.
            What we admire as a perfume they conſider as a moſt abominable ſtench,
            and call one of their rivers, on the banks of which this animal is ſeen to
            burrow in numbers, by the name of the ſtinking river, as well as the rat
            itſelf, which is denominated by them the ſtinkard. This is a ſtrange
            diverſity among mankind; and, perhaps, may be aſcribed to the different
            kinds of food among different nations. Such as chiefly feed upon rancid oils
            and putrid fleſh will often miſtake the nature of ſcents; and, having
            been long uſed to ill ſmells, will by habit conſider them as perfumes. Be
            this as it will, although theſe nations of northern ſavages conſider the
            muſk rat as intolerably foetid, they nevertheleſs regard it as very good
            eating; and, indeed, in this they imitate the epicures of Europe very exactly,
            whoſe taſte ſeldom reliſhes a diſh till <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0823900104:109"/> the
            noſe gives the ſtrongeſt marks of diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. As to the reſt,
            this animal a good deal reſembles the beaver in its habits and
            diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; but, as its inſtincts are leſs powerful, and its oeconomy
            leſs exact, I will reſerve for the deſcription of that animal a part of
            what may be applicable to this.</p>

               <head>THE CRICETUS.</head>
               <p>THE Cricetus, or German Rat, which Mr. Buffon calls the Hamſter,
            greatly reſembles the water-rat in its ſize, ſmall eyes, and the
            ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its tail. It differs in colour, being rather browner, like
            the Norway rat, with the belly and legs of a dirty yellow. But the marks by
            which it may be diſtinguiſhed from all others are two pouches, like thoſe
            of a baboon, on each ſide of its jaw, under the ſkin, into which it can
            cram a large quantity of proviſion. Theſe bags are oblong, and of the
            ſize, when filled, of a large walnut. They open into the mouth, and fall back
            along the neck to the ſhoulder. Into theſe the animal can thruſt the
            ſurplus of thoſe fruits or grains it gathers in the fields, ſuch as
            wheat, peas, or acorns. When the immediate calls of hunger are ſatisfied, it
            then falls to filling theſe; and thus, loaded with two great bunches on each
            ſide of the jaw, it <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0823900104:110"/> returns home to its hole to
            depoſit the ſpoil as a ſtore for the winter. The ſize, the fecundity,
            and the voraciouſneſs of this animal render it one of the greateſt
            peſts in the countries where it is found, and every method is made uſe of
            to deſtroy it.</p>
               <p>But, although this animal is very noxious with reſpect to man,
            yet, conſidered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to thoſe inſtincts which conduce to its own
            ſupport and convenience, it deſerves our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon, vol. xxvi. p. 159.</bibl>
                  </note>. Its hole offers a
            very curious object for contemplation, and ſhews a degree of ſkill
            ſuperior to the reſt of the rat kind. It conſiſts of a variety of
            apartments, fitted up for the different occaſions of the little inhabitant.
            It is generally made on an inclining ground, and always has two entrances, one
            perpendicular and the other oblique; though, if there be more than one in a
            family, there are as many perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular holes as there are individuals below.
            The perpendicular hole is uſually that through which they go in and out; the
            oblique ſerves to give a thorough air to keep the retreat clean, and, in
            caſe one hole is ſtopped, to give an exit at this. Within about a foot of
            the perpendicular hole the animal makes two more, where are depoſited the
            family's proviſions. Theſe are <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0823900104:111"/> Theſe are much more
            ſpacious than the former, and are large in proportion to the quantity of the
            ſtore. Beſide theſe, there is ſtill another apartment warmly lined with
            graſs and ſtraw, where the female brings forth her young; all theſe
            communicate with each other, and all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether take up a ſpace of ten or
            twelve feet in diameter. Theſe animals furniſh their ſtore-houſes with
            dry corn well cleaned; they alſo lay in corn in the ear, and beans and peas
            in the pod. Theſe, when occaſion requires, they afterwards ſeparate,
            carrying out the pods and empty ears by their oblique paſſage. They
            uſually begin to lay in at the latter end of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt; and, as each magazine
            is filled, they carefully cover up the mouth with earth, and that ſo neatly
            that it is no eaſy matter to diſcover where the earth has been removed. The
            only means of finding out their retreats are, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to obſerve the
            oblique entrance, which generally has a ſmall quantity of earth before it;
            and this, though often ſeveral yards from their perpendicular retreat, leads
            thoſe who are ſkilled in the ſearch to make the diſcovery. Many German
            peaſants are known to make a livelihood by finding out and bringing off their
            <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oards, which, in a fruitful
            ſeaſon, often furniſh two buſhels of good grain in each apartment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0823900104:112"/>Like moſt others of the rat kind, they
            pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce twice or thrice a year, and bring five or ſix at a time. Some years
            they appear in alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing numbers, at other times they are not ſo plenty. The
            moiſt ſeaſons aſſiſt their propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and it often happens on
            ſuch years that their devaſtations produce a famine all over the country.
            Happily, however, for mankind, theſe, like the reſt of their kind,
            deſtroy each other; and of two that Mr. Buffon kept in a cage, male and
            female, the latter killed and devoured the former. As to the reſt, their fur
            is conſidered as very valuable; the natives are invited by rewards to
            deſtroy them; and the weaſel kind ſeconds the wiſhes of government with
            great ſucceſs. Although they are uſually found brown on the back and
            white on the belly, yet many of them are obſerved to be grey, which may
            probably ariſe from the difference of age.</p>

               <head>THE LEMING.</head>
               <p>HAVING conſidered various kinds of theſe noxious little
            animals that elude the indignation of mankind, and ſubſiſt by their
            number, not their ſtrength, we come to a ſpecies more bold, more dangerous,
            and more numerous than any of the former. The Leming, which is a native 
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0823900104:113"/> of Scandinavia, is often ſeen to pour down in myriads
            from the northern mountains, and, like a peſtilence, deſtroy all the
            productions of the earth. It is deſcribed as being larger than a dormouſe,
            with a buſhy tail, though ſhorter. It is covered with thin hair of various
            colours. The extremity of the upper part of the head is black, as are
            likewiſe the neck and ſhoulders, but the reſt of the body is reddiſh,
            intermixed with ſmall black ſpots of various figures, as far as the tail,
            which is not above half an inch long. The eyes are little and black, the ears
            round and inclining towards the back, the legs before are ſhort, and thoſe
            behind longer, which gives it a great degree of ſwiftneſs. But what it is
            much more remarkable for than its figure are, its amazing fecundity and
            extraordinary mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations.</p>
               <p>In wet ſeaſons, all of the rat kind are known to propagate
            more than in the dry; but this ſpecies in particular is ſo aſſiſted
            in multiplying by the moiſture of the weather, that the inhabitants of
            Lapland ſincerely believe that they drop from the clouds, and that the ſame
            magazines that furniſh hail and ſnow pour the leming alſo upon them. In
            fact, after long rain, theſe animals ſet forward from their native
            mountains, and ſeveral millions in a troop deluge the whole 
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0823900104:114"/> plain with their numbers<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Phil. Tranſ. vol. ii. p. 872.</bibl>
                  </note>. They move,
            for the moſt part, in a ſquare, marching forward by night and lying ſtill
            by day. Thus, like an animated torrent, they are often ſeen more than a mile
            broad covering the ground, and that ſo thick that the hindmoſt touches its
            leader. It is in vain that the poor inhabitant reſiſts or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to
            ſtop their progreſs, they ſtill keep moving forward; and, though
            thouſands are deſtroyed, myriads are ſeen to ſucceed and make their
            deſtruction impracticable. They generally move in lines, which are about
            three feet from each other and exactly parallel. Their march is always directed
            from the north-weſt to the ſouth-weſt, and regularly conducted from the
            beginning. Wherever their motions are turned nothing can ſtop them; they go
            directly forward, impelled by ſome ſtrange power; and, from the time they
            firſt ſet out, they never once think of retreating. If a lake or a river
            happens to interrupt their progreſs, they all together take the water and
            ſwim over it; a fire, a deep well, or a torrent, does not turn them out of
            their ſtraight lined direction; they boldly plunge into the flames, or leap
            down the well, and are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen climbing up on the other ſide. If
            they are interrupted by a boat acroſs a river <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0823900104:115"/> while
            they are ſwimming, they never attempt to ſwim round it, but mount directly
            up its ſides; and the boat-men, who know how vain reſiſtance in ſuch a
            caſe would be, calmly ſuffer the living torrent to paſs over, which it
            does without further damage. If they meet with a ſtack of hay or corn that
            interrupts their paſſage, inſtead of going over it they gnaw their way
            through; if they are ſtopped by a houſe in their courſe, if they cannot
            get through it, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue there till they die. It is happy, however, for
            mankind that they eat nothing that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for human ſubſiſtence;
            they never enter an houſe to deſtroy the proviſions, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
            with eating every root and vegetable that they meet. If they happen to paſs
            through a meadow, they deſtroy it in a very ſhort time, and give it an
            appearance of being burnt up and ſtrewed with aſhes. If they are
            interrupted in their courſe, and a man ſhould imprudently venture to attack
            one of them, the little animal is no way intimidated by the diſparity of
            ſtrength, but furiouſly flies up at its opponent, and, barking ſomewhat
            like a puppy, wherever it faſtens does not eaſily quit the hold. If at
            laſt the leader be forced out of its line, which it defends as long as it
            can, and be ſeparated from the reſt of its kind, it ſets up a plaintive 
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0823900104:116"/> cry different from that of anger, and, as ſome pretend
            to ſay, gives itſelf a voluntary death, by hanging itſelf on the fork of
            a tree.</p>
               <p>An enemy ſo numerous and deſtructive would quickly render the
            countries where they appear utterly uninhabitable, did it not fortunately
            happen that the ſame rapacity that animates them to deſtroy the labours of
            mankind, at laſt impels them to deſtroy and devour each other<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Dictonnaire Raiſonnée, vol. ii. p.
                610.</bibl>
                  </note>. After committing incredible devaſtations, they are at
            laſt ſeen to ſeparate into two armies, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with deadly hatred,
            along the coaſts of the larger lakes and rivers. The Laplanders, who
            obſerve them thus drawn up to fight, inſtead of conſidering their mutual
            animoſities as an happy riddance of the moſt dreadful peſt, form omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
            prognoſtics from the manner of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement. They conſider their
            combats as a preſage of war, and expect an invaſion from the Ruſſians
            or the Swedes, as the ſides next thoſe kingdoms happen to conquer. The two
            diviſions, however, continue their engagements and animoſity until one
            party overcomes the other. From that time they utterly diſappear, nor is it
            well known what becomes of either the conquerors or the conquered. Some
            ſuppoſe that they ruſh headlong into the ſea, others that 
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0823900104:117"/> they kill themſelvs, as ſome are found hanging on the
            forked branches of a tree, and others ſtill that they are deſtroyed by the
            young ſpring herbage. But the moſt probable opinion is, that, having
            devoured the vegetable produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the country, and having nothing more to
            ſubſiſt on, they then fall to devouring each other; and, having
            habituated themſelves to that kind of food, continue it. However this be,
            they are often found dead by thouſands, and their carcaſes have been known
            to infect the air for ſeveral miles round, ſo as to produce very malignant
            diſorders. They ſeem alſo to infect the plants they have gnawed, for the
            cattle often die that afterwards feed in the places where they paſſed.</p>
               <p>As to the reſt, the male is larger and more beautifully
            ſpotted than the female. They are extremely prolific; and what is
            extraordinary, their breeding does not hinder their march; for ſome of them
            have been obſerved to carry one young one in their mouth and another on their
            back. They are greatly preyed upon by the ermine, and, as we are told, even by
            the rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deer. The Swedes and Norwegians, who live by huſbandry, conſider
            an invaſion from theſe vermin as a terrible viſitation; but it is very
            different with reſpect to the Laplanders, who <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0823900104:118"/> lead a
            vagrant life, and who, like the lemings themſelves, if their proviſions be
            deſtroyed in one part of the country, can eaſily retire to another. Theſe
            are never ſo happy as when an army of lemings come down amongſt them; for
            then they feaſt upon their fleſh; which though horrid food, and which,
            though even dogs and cats are known to deteſt, theſe little ſavages
            eſteem very good eating and devour greedily. They are glad of their arrival
            alſo upon another account, for they always expect a great plenty of game the
            year following, among thoſe fields which the lemings have deſtroyed.</p>

               <head>THE MOLE.</head>
               <p>TO theſe minute animals of the rat kind, a great part of whoſe
            lives is paſt in holes under ground, I will ſubjoin one little animal more,
            no way reſembling the rat, except that its whole life is ſpent there. As we
            have ſeen ſome quadrupedes formed to crop the ſurface of the fields, and
            others to live upon the tops of trees, ſo the Mole is formed to live wholly
            under the earth, as if Nature meant that no place ſhould be left wholly
            untenanted. Were we from our own ſenſations to pronounce upon the life of a
            quadrupede that was never to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear above ground, but always condemned to 
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0823900104:119"/> hunt for its prey underneath, obliged, whenever It
            removed from one place to another, to bore its way through a reſiſting
            body, we ſhould be apt to aſſert that ſuch an exiſtence muſt be the
            moſt frightful and ſolitary in nature. However, in the preſent animal,
            though we find it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to all thoſe ſeeming inconveniencies, we
            ſhall diſcover no ſigns of wretchedneſs or diſtreſs. No quadrupede
            is fatter, none has a more ſleek or gloſſy ſkin; and, though denied
            many advantages that moſt animals enjoy, it is more liberally
            poſſeſſed of others, which they have in a more ſcanty proportion.</p>
               <p>This animal, ſo well known in England, is, however, utterly a
            ſtranger in other places, and particularly in Ireland. For ſuch,
            there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as have never ſeen it, a ſhort deſcription will be
            neceſſary. And, in the firſt place, though ſomewhat of a ſize between
            the rat and the mouſe, it no way reſembles either, being an animal entirely
            of a ſingular kind, and perfectly unlike any other quadrupede whatever. It is
            bigger than a mouſe, with a coat of fine, ſhort, gloſſy, black hair.
            Its noſe is long and pointed, reſembling that of an hog, but much longer.
            Its eyes are ſo ſmall that it is ſcarce poſſible to diſcern them.
            Inſtead of ears it has only holes in the place. Its neck is ſo ſhort that
            the head <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0823900104:120"/> ſeems ſtuck upon the ſhoulders. The body
            is thick and round, terminating by a very ſmall ſhort tail, and its legs
            alſo are ſo very ſhort that the animal ſeems to lie flat on its belly.
            From under its belly, as it reſts in this poſition, the four feet appear
            juſt as if they immediately grew out of the body. Thus the animal appears to
            us at firſt view as a maſs of fleſh covered with a fine ſhining black
            ſkin, with a little head, and ſcarce any legs, eyes, or tail. On a cloſer
            in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, however, two little black points may be diſcerned, that are
            its eyes. The ancients, and ſome of the moderns, were of opinion that the
            animal was utterly blind; but Derham, by the help of a microſcope, plainly
            diſcovered all the parts of the eye that are known in other animals, ſuch
            as the pupil, the vitreous and the chryſtaline humours. The fore-legs appear
            very ſhort and ſtrong, and furniſhed with five claws to each. Theſe are
            turned outwards and backwards, as the hands of a man when ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. The hind
            legs are longer and weaker than the fore, being only uſed to aſſiſt its
            mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; whereas the others are continually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in digging. The teeth
            are like thoſe of a ſhrew-mouſe, and there are five on both ſides of
            the upper jaw, which ſtand out; but thoſe behind are divided into points.
            The tongue is as large as the mouth will hold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0823900104:121"/>Such is the extraordinary figure and
            for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this animal; which, if we compare with its manner of living, we
            ſhall find a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt attention in Nature to adapt the one to the
            other<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Britiſh Zoology.</bibl>
                  </note>. As it is
            allotted a ſubterraneous abode, the ſeeming defects of its formation
            va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, or rather are turned to its advantage. The breadth, ſtrength, and
            ſhortneſs of the fore feet, which are inclined outwards, anſwer the
            pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of digging, ſerving to throw back the earth with greater eaſe,
            and to purſue the worms and inſects which are its prey: had they been
            longer, the falling in of the earth would have prevented the quick repetition
            of its ſtrokes in working; or have obliged it to make a larger hole, in order
            to give room for their exertion. The form of the body is not leſs admirably
            contrived for its way of life. The fore part is thick and very muſcular,
            giving great ſtrength to the action of the fore feet, enabling it to dig its
            way with amazing force and rapidity, either to purſue its prey, or elude the
            ſearch of the moſt active enemy. By its power of boring the earth, it
            quickly gets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſurface; and I have ſeen it, when let looſe in
            the midſt of a field, like the ghoſt on a theatre, inſtantly ſink into
            the earth; and the <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0823900104:122"/> moſt active labourer, with a
            ſpade, in vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to purſue.</p>
               <p>The ſmallneſs of its eyes, which induced the ancients to think
            it was blind, is, to this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal, a peculiar advantage. A ſmall degree of
            viſion is ſufficient for a creature that is ever deſtined to live in
            darkneſs. A more extenſive ſight would only have ſerved to ſhew the
            hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of its priſon, while Nature had denied it the means of an eſcape.
            Had this organ been larger, it would have been perpetually liable to injuries,
            by the falling of the earth into it; but Nature, to prevent that inconvenience,
            has not only made them very ſmall, but very cloſely covered them with hair.
            Anatomiſts mention, beſide theſe advantages, another, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
            to their ſecurity; namely, a certain muſcle, by which the animal can draw
            back the eye whenever it is neceſſary or in danger.</p>
               <p>As the eye is thus perfectly fitted to the animal's ſituation,
            ſo alſo are the ſenſes of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſmelling. The firſt gives it
            notice of the moſt diſtant appearance of danger; the other directs it, in
            the midſt of darkneſs, to its food. The wants of a ſubterraneous animal
            can be but few; and theſe are ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them: to eat, and to
            produce its kind, are the whole employments of ſuch a life; and for

            ſolitude; with no appetites but what it can eaſily indulge, with no enemies
            but what it can eaſily evade or conquer. As ſoon as it has once buried
            itſelf in the earth, it ſeldom ſtirs out, unleſs forced by violent
            rains in ſummer, or when in purſuit of its prey, it happens to come too
            near the ſurface, and thus gets into the open air, which may be conſidered
            as its unnatural element. In general, it chuſes the looſer ſofter
            grounds, beneath which it can travel with greater eaſe; in ſuch alſo it
            generally finds the greateſt number of worms and inſects, upon which it
            chiefly preys. It is obſerved to be moſt active, and to caſt up moſt
            earth, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before rain; and, in winter, before <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0823900104:124"/> a
            thaw: at thoſe times the worms and inſects begin to be in motion; and
            approach the ſurface, whither this induſtrious animal purſues them. On
            the contrary, in very dry weather, the mole ſeldom or never forms any
            hillocks; for then it is obliged to penetrate deeper after its prey, which at

                  </note>, they have but few enemies; and very
            readily evade the purſuit of animals ſtronger and ſwifter than
            themſelves. Their greateſt calamity is an inundation; which, wherever it
            happens, they are ſeen, in numbers, attempting to ſave themſelves by
            ſwimming, and uſing every effort to reach the higher grounds. The
            greateſt part, however, periſh, as well as their young, which remain in the
            holes behind. Were it not for ſuch accidents, from their great fecundity,
            they would become extremely trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome; and as it is, in ſome places,
            they are conſidered by the farmer as his greateſt peſt. They couple
            towards the approach of ſpring; and their young are found about the beginning

            forth her young. Theſe are made with much greater art than the reſt; and
            are uſually larger. The female, in order to form this retreat, begins by
            erecting the earth into a tolerably ſpacious apartment, which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
            within by partitions, at proper diſtances, that prevent the roof from
            falling. All round this ſhe works, and beats the earth very firm, ſo as to
            make it capable of keeping out the rain, let it be never ſo violent. As the
            hillock in which this apartment is thus formed, is raiſed above ground, the
            apartment itſelf is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently above the level of the plain, and
            there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leſs ſubject to accidental ſlight inundations. The place being
            thus fitted, ſhe then procures graſs and dry leaves, as a bed for her
            young. There they lie ſecure from wet, and ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to make their
            retreat equally ſo from danger; for all round this hill of her own raiſing,
            are holes running into the earth, that part from the middle apartment, like
            rays from a center, and extend about fifteen feet in every direction: theſe
            reſemble ſo many walks or chaces, into which the animal makes her
            ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous excurſions, and ſupplies her young with ſuch roots or
            inſects as ſhe can provide: but they contribute ſtill more to the general
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0823900104:129"/> ſafety; for as the mole is very quick of hearing, the
            inſtant ſhe perceives her little habitation attacked, ſhe takes to her
            burrow, and unleſs the earth be dug away by ſeveral men at once, ſhe and
            her young always make a good retreat.</p>
               <p>The mole is ſcarcely found, except in culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated countries: the
            varieties are but few. That which is found in Virginia, reſembles the common
            mole, except in colour, which is black, mixed with a deep purple. There are
            ſometimes white moles, ſeen particularly in Poland, rather larger than the
            former. As their ſkin is ſo very ſoft and beautiful, it is odd that it
            has not been turned to any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Agricola tells us, that he ſaw hats
            made from it, the fineſt and the moſt beautiful that could be imagined.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. Of Animals of the Hedge-hog, or prickly Kind.</head>
            <p>ANIMALS of the Hedge-hog kind require but very little accuracy to
          diſtinguiſh them from all others. That hair which ſerves the generality
          of quadrupedes for warmth and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, is partly wanting in theſe; while
          its place is ſupplied by ſharp ſpines or prickles, that ſerve for their
          defence. This general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic, therefore, makes a much more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
          diſtinction than any that can be taken from their teeth or their claws.
          Nature, by this extraordinary peculiarity, ſeems to have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated them in
          a very diſtinguiſhed manner; ſo that, inſtead of claſſing the
          hedge-hog among the moles, or the porcupine with the hare, as ſome have done,
          it is much more natural and obvious to place them, and others approaching them
          in this ſtrange peculiarity, in a claſs by themſelves: nor let it be
          ſuppoſed, that while I thus alter their arrangement, and ſeparate them
          from animals with which they have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly combined, that I am
          deſtroying any ſecret affinities that exiſt in nature. It is natural,
          in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for readers to ſuppoſe, when they ſee two <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0823900104:131"/>
          ſuch oppoſite animals as the hare and the porcupine aſſembled together
          in the ſame groupe, that there muſt be ſome material rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſome
          ſecret connexion, for thus joining animals ſo little reſembling each
          other in appearance. But the reaſons for this union were very ſlight, and
          merely aroſe from a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude in the fore teeth: no likeneſs in the
          in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal conformation; no ſimilitude in nature, in habitudes, or
          diſpoſition; in ſhort, nothing to faſten the link that combines them,
          but the ſimilitude in the teeth: this, therefore, may be eaſily
          diſpenſed with; and, as was ſaid, it will be moſt proper to claſs
          them according to their moſt ſtriking ſimilitudes.</p>
            <p>The Hedge-hog, with an appearance the moſt formidable, is yet one
          of the moſt harmleſs animals in the world: unable or unwilling to offend,
          all its precautions are only directed to its own ſecurity; and it is armed
          with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand points, to keep off the enemy, but not to invade him. While
          other creatures truſt to their force, their cunning, or their ſwiftneſs,
          this animal, deſtitute of all, has but one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for ſafety; and from
          this alone it often finds protection. As ſoon as it perceives itſelf
          attacked, it withdraws all its vulnerable parts, rolls itſelf into a ball,
          and preſents nothing but its defenſive thorns to the enemy; thus, while 
          <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0823900104:132"/> it attempts to injure no other quadrupede, they are
          equally incapable of injuring it: like thoſe knights, we have ſomewhere
          read of, who were armed in ſuch a manner, that they could neither conquer
          others, nor be themſelves over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
            <p>This animal is of two kinds; one with a noſe like the ſnout of
          an hog; the other, more ſhort and blunt, like that of a dog. That with the
          muzzle of a dog is the moſt common, being about ſix inches in length, from
          the tip of the noſe to the inſertion of the tail. The tail is little more
          than an inch long; and ſo concealed by the ſpines, as to be ſcarce
          viſible: the head, back, and ſides, are covered with prickles; the noſe,
          breaſt, and belly, are covered with fine ſoft hair<note n="*" place="bottom">Praeputium propendeus. 
            <bibl>Linnaei Syſt. 75.</bibl> And of the female he might have
            ſaid, reſupina copulatur.</note>; the legs are ſhort, of a duſky
          colour, and almoſt bare; the toes on each foot are five in number, long and
          ſeparated; the prickles are about an inch in length, and very ſharp
          pointed; their lower part is white, the middle black, and the points white: the
          eyes are ſmall, and placed high in the head; the ears are round, pretty
          large, and naked; the mouth is ſmall, but well furniſhed with teeth;
          theſe, however, it only uſes in chewing its food, <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0823900104:133"/>
          but neither in attacking or defending itſelf againſt other animals. Its
          only reliance in caſes of danger, is on its ſpines; the inſtant it
          per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives an enemy, it puts itſelf into a poſture of defence, and keeps
          upon its guard until it ſuppoſes the danger over. On ſuch occaſions, it
          immediately alters its whole appearance: from its uſual form, ſomewhat
          reſembling a ſmall animal, with a bunch on its back, the animal begins to
          bend its back, to lay its head upon its breaſt, to ſhut its eyes, to roll
          down the ſkin of its ſides towards the legs, to draw theſe up, and,
          laſtly, to tuck them in on every ſide, by drawing the ſkin ſtill
          cloſer. In this form, which the hedge-hog always puts on when diſturbed, it
          no way reſembles an animal, but rather a roundiſh maſs of prickles,
          impervious on every ſide. The ſhape of the animal thus rolled up,
          ſomewhat reſembles a cheſtnut in the huſk; there being, on one ſide,
          a kind of flat ſpace, which is that on which the head and legs have been
          tucked in.</p>
            <p>Such is the uſual appearance of the hedge-hog, upon the approach
          of any danger. Thus rolled up in a lump, it patiently waits till its enemy
          paſſes by, or is fatigued with fruitleſs attempts to annoy it. The cat,
          the weaſel, the ferret, and the martin, quickly decline the combat; and the
          dog himſelf generally ſpends <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0823900104:134"/> his time in empty
          menaces, rather than in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual efforts. Every encreaſe of danger only
          encreaſes the animal's precautions to keep on its guard; its aſſailant
          vainly attempts to bite, ſince he thus more frequently feels than inflicts a
          wound; he ſtands enraged and barking, and rolls it along with his paws;
          ſtill, however, the hedge-hog patiently ſubmits to every indignity, but
          continues ſecure; and ſtill more to diſguſt its enemy with the
          conteſt, ſheds its urine, the ſmell of which is alone ſufficient to
          ſend him away. In this manner the dog, after barking for ſome time, leaves
          the hedge-hog where he found him; who perceiving the danger paſt, at length
          peeps out from its ball, and, if not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, creeps ſlowly to its
          retreat.</p>
            <p>The hedge-hog, like moſt other wild ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, ſleeps by day, and
          ventures out by night. It generally reſides in ſmall thickets, in hedges,
          or in ditches covered with buſhes; there it makes an hole of about ſix or
          eight inches deep, and lies well wrapped up, in moſs, graſs, or leaves. Its
          food is roots, fruits, worms, and inſects. It is alſo ſaid to ſuck
          cattle, and hurt their udders; but the ſmallneſs of its mouth will ſerve
          to clear it from this reproach. It is ſaid alſo to be very hurtful in
          gardens and orchards, where it will roll itſelf in <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0823900104:135"/> an
          heap of fruit, and ſo carry a large quantity away upon its prickles; but this
          imputation is as ill grounded as the former, ſince the ſpines are ſo
          diſpoſed, that no fruit will ſtick upon them, even if we ſhould try to
          fix them on. It rather appears to be a very ſerviceable animal, in ridding
          our fields of inſects and worms, which are ſo prejudicial to
          vegetation.</p>
            <p>Mr. Buffon, who kept theſe animals tame about his houſe, acquits
          them of the reproach of being miſchievous in the garden; but then he
          accuſes them of tricks, of which from the form and habits of this animal one
          would be never led to ſuſpect them. 
          <q rend="inline">"I have often," ſays he, "had the female and her
            young brought me about the beginning of June: they are generally from three to
            five in number: they are white in the beginning, and only the marks of their
            ſpines appear: I was willing to rear ſome of them, and accordingly put the
            dam and her young into a tub, with abundant proviſion beſide them; but the
            old animal, inſtead of ſuckling her young, devoured them all, one after
            another. On another occaſion, an hedge-hog that had made its way into the
            kitchen, diſcovered a little pot, in which there was meat prepared for
            boiling; the miſchievous animal drew out the meat, and left its excrements in

            ſize of a mole, and covered with prickles, like that animal, except that they
            are ſhorter and ſmaller. The Tendrac is ſtill leſs than the former, and
            is defended only with prickles upon the head, the neck and the ſhoulders; the
            reſt being covered with a coarſe hair, reſembling an hog's briſtles.
            Theſe little animals, whoſe legs are very ſhort, move but ſlowly. They
            grunt like an hog; and wallow, like it, in the mire. They love to be near
            water; and ſpend more of their time there than upon land. They are chiefly in

            poſſeſſes in miniature, the Porcupine has in a more enlarged degree.
            The ſhort prickles of the hedge-hog are in this animal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into
            ſhafts. In the one the ſpines are about an inch long; in the other, a foot.
            The porcupine is about two feet long, and fifteen inches high. Like the
            hedge-hog, it appears a maſs of misſhapen fleſh, covered with quills,
            from ten to fourteen inches long, reſembling the barrel of a gooſe-quill in
            thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but tapering and ſharp at both ends. Theſe, whether
            conſidered ſeparately or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, afford ſufficient ſubject to detain
            curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity Each quill is thickeſt in the middle; and inſerted into the
            animal's ſkin, in the ſame manner as feathers are found to grow upon birds.
            It is within ſide ſpongy, like the top <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:146"/>

            gooſe-quill; and of different colours, being white and black alternately,
            from one end to the other. The biggeſt are often found fifteen inches long,
            and a quarter of an inch in diameter; extremely ſharp, and capable of
            inflicting a mortal wound. They ſeem harder than common quills, being
            difficult to be cut, and ſolid at that end which is not fixed in the ſkin.
            If we examine them in common, as they grow upon the animal, they appear of two
            kinds; the one ſuch as I have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; the other, long, flexible
            and ſlender, growing here and there among the former. There is ſtill
            another ſort of quills, that grow near the tail, white and tranſparent,
            like writing quills, and that ſeem to be cut ſhort at the end. All theſe
            quills, of whatſoever kind, incline backwards, like the briſtles of an hog;
            but when the animal is irritated, they riſe, and ſtand upright, as
            briſtles are ſeen to do.</p>
               <p>Such is the formation of this quadrupede, in thoſe parts in
            which it differs from moſt others: as to the reſt of its figure, the muzzle
            bears ſome reſemblance to that of an hare, but black; the legs are very
            ſhort, and the feet have five toes, both before and behind; and theſe, as
            well as the belly, the head, and all other parts of the body, are covered with
            a ſort of ſhort hair, like <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0823900104:149"/> prickles, there being no
            part, except the ears and the ſole of the foot, that is free from them: the
            ears are thinly covered with very fine hair; and are in ſhape like thoſe of
            mankind: the eyes are ſmall, like thoſe of an hog, being only one third of
            an inch from one corner to the other. After the ſkin is taken off, there
            appear a kind of paps on thoſe parts of the body from whence the large quills
            proceed; theſe are about the ſize of a ſmall pea, each anſwering to as
            many holes which appear on the outward ſurface of the ſkin, and which are
            about half an inch deep, like as many hollow pipes, wherein the quills are
            fixed, as in ſo many ſheaths.</p>
               <p>This animal ſeems to partake very much of the nature of the
            hedge-hog; having this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable apparatus of arms rather to defend
            it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than annoy the enemy. There have been, indeed, many naturaliſts
            who ſuppoſed that it was capable of diſcharging them at its foes, and
            killing at a great diſtance off. But this opinion has been entirely
            diſcredited of late; and it is now univerſally believed that its quills
            remain firmly fixed in the ſkin, and are then only ſhed when the animal
            moults them, as birds do their feathers. It is true, we are told by Ellis, that
            a wolf at Hudſon's Bay was found dead, with the quills of a porcupine fixed
            within its mouth; <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0823900104:150"/> which might have very well happened,
            from the voraciouſneſs of the former, and not the reſentment of the
            latter. That rapacious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the rage of appetite, might have
            at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to devour the porcupine, quills and all, and very probably paid the
            forfeit, by its life. However this be, of all the porcupines that have been
            brought into Europe, not one was ever ſeen to launch their quills; and yet
            the irritations they received were ſufficient to have provoked their utmoſt
            indignation. Of all the porcupines that Doctor Shaw obſerved in Africa, and
            he ſaw numbers, not one ever attempted to dart its quills; their uſual
            manner of defence being, to lie on one ſide, and when the enemy approaches
            very near, by ſuddenly riſing, to wound him with the points on the
            other.</p>
               <p>It is probable, therefore, that the porcupine is ſeldom the
            aggreſſor; and when attacked by the bolder animals, it only directs its
            quills ſo as to keep always pointing towards the enemy. Theſe are an ample
            protection; and, as we are aſſured by Kolben, at ſuch times, even the
            lion himſelf will not venture to make an attack. From ſuch, therefore, the
            porcupine can defend itſelf; and chiefly hunts for ſerpents, and all other
            reptiles, for ſubſiſtence. Travellers uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally aſſure us that,
            between the ſerpent and <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0823900104:151"/> the porcupine there exiſts
            an irreconcileable enmity, and that they never meet without a mortal
            engagement<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. The porcupine, on theſe occaſions, is ſaid to roll
            itſelf upon the ſerpent, and thus deſtroy and devour it. This may be
            true; while what we are informed by Monſieur Sarraſin, of the porcupine of
            Canada chiefly ſubſiſting on vegetables, may be equally ſo. Thoſe
            which are brought to this country to be ſhewn, are uſually fed on bread,
            milk, and fruits; but they will not refuſe meat when it is offered them; and
            it is probable, they prefer it in a wild ſtate, when it is to be had<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon.</bibl>
                  </note>. The porcupine is alſo
            known to be extremely hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to gardens; and, where it enters, does
            in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible damage.</p>
               <p>The Americans, who hunt this animal, aſſure us, that the
            porcupine lives from twelve to fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years. During the time of coupling,
            which is in the month of September, the males become very fierce and dangerous,
            and often are ſeen to deſtroy each other with their teeth. The female goes
            with young ſeven months, and brings forth but one at a time; this ſhe
            ſuckles but about a month, and accuſtoms it betimes to live, like
            herſelf, upon vegetables and the <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0823900104:152"/> bark of trees; ſhe
            is very fierce in its defence; but, at other ſeaſons, ſhe is fearful,
            timid, and harmleſs. The porcupine never attempts to bite, nor any way to
            injure its purſuers: if hunted by a dog or a wolf, it inſtantly climbs up a
            tree, and continues there until it has wearied out the patience of its
            adverſary; the wolf knows by experience how fruitleſs it would be to wait,
            he therefore leaves the porcupine above, and ſeeks out for a new
            adventure.</p>
               <p>The porcupine does not eſcape ſo well from the Indian hunter,
            who eagerly purſues it, in order to make embroidery of its quills, and to eat
            its fleſh. This, as we are commonly told, is very tolerable eating; however,
            we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect wretched proviſions when the ſavages are to be our caterers,
            for they eat every thing that has life. But they are very ingenious with regard
            to their embroidery: if I underſtand the accounts rightly, they dye the
            quills of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious colours, and then ſplitting them into ſlips, as we ſee
            in the making of a cane-chair, they embroider, with theſe, their belts,
            baſkets, and ſeveral other neceſſary pieces of furniture.</p>
               <p>As to the reſt, there are many things related concerning this
            animal that are fabulous; but there are ſtill many circumſtances more, that
            yet remain to be known. It were curious to <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0823900104:153"/> enquire
            whether this animal molts its quills when wild, for it is never ſeen to
            ſhed them in a domeſtic ſtate; whether it ſleeps all the winter, as we
            are told by ſome naturaliſts, which we are ſure it does not when brought
            into our country; and, laſtly, whether its quills can be ſent off with a
            ſhake; for no leſs a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt than Reaumur was of that opinion.</p>
               <p>All that we can learn of an animal expoſed as a ſhew, or even
            by its diſſection, is but merely its conformation; and that makes one of
            the leaſt intereſting parts of its hiſtory. We are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally led, when
            preſented with an extraordinary creature, to expect ſomething extraordinary
            in its way of living, ſomething uncommon, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding with its figure;
            but of this animal we know little with any preciſion, except what it offers
            in a ſtate of captivity. In ſuch a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that which I ſaw,
            appeared to very little advantage: it was extremely dull and torpid, though
            very wakeful; and extremely voracious, though very capable of ſuſtaining
            hunger; as averſe to any attachment, as to being tamed: it was kept in an
            iron cage, and the touching one of the bars was ſufficient to excite its
            reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for its quills were inſtantly erected; and the poet was right
            in his epithet of fretful, for <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0823900104:154"/> it appeared to me the
            moſt iraſcible creature upon earth.</p>
               <p>The porcupines of America differ very much from that of the
            ancient continent, which we have been deſcribing; and, ſtrictly ſpeaking,
            may be conſidered as animals of a different ſpecies: however, from their
            being covered with quills, we will only add them as varieties of the former,
            ſince we know very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, except their difference of
            figure. They are of two kinds; the one called the Couando; and the other,
            firſt named by Mr. Buffon, the Urſon: the one a native of the northern
            parts of America; the other of the ſouth; and both differing from the former,
            in having long tails, whereas that has a very ſhort one.</p>
               <p>The Couando is much leſs than the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupine; its quills are
            four times ſhorter, its ſnout more unlike that of an hare; its tail is long
            enough to catch by the branches of trees, and hold by them. It may be eaſily
            tamed, and is to be found chiefly in the ſouthern parts of America; yet is
            not wanting alſo in the northern.</p>
               <p>The Urſon, which Mr. Buffon calls after our countryman Hudſon,
            is a native of Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Bay. The make of the body of this 
            <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0823900104:155"/> animal is not ſo round as that of the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but
            ſomewhat reſembling the ſhape of a pig. It is covered with long briſtly
            hair, with a ſhorter hair underneath; and under this the quills lie concealed
            very thick; they are white, with a brown point, and bearded, and the longeſt
            do not exceed four inches; they ſtick to the hand when the animal is
            ſtroked on the back; and likewiſe, when the hand is taken away, they
            ſtick ſo faſt as to follow it. They make their neſt under the roots of
            great trees, ſleep very much, and chiefly feed upon the bark of the juniper.
            In winter the ſnow ſerves them for drink; and in ſummer they lap water,
            like a dog. They are very common in the country lying to the eaſt of
            Hudſon's Bay; and ſeveral of the trading Americans depend on them for food,
            at ſome ſeaſons of the year.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. Of Quadrupedes covered with Scales or Shells inſtead
          of Hair<note n="*" place="bottom">This chapter is chiefly extracted from Mr.
            Buffon, which I mention at once, to ſave the trouble of repeated
            quotation.</note>.</head>
            <p>WHEN we talk of a quadrupede, the name ſeems to imply an animal
          covered with hair; when we mention a bird, it is natural to conceive a creature
          covered with feathers; when we hear of a fiſh, its ſcales are generally the
          firſt part that ſtrikes our imagination. Nature, however, owns none of our
          diſtinctions; various in all her operations, ſhe mixes her plans, groupes
          her pictures, and excites our wonder as well by her general laws as by her
          deviations. Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes, which we have conſidered as making the firſt
          general claſs in animated nature, and next to man the moſt dignified
          tenants of the earth, are yet in many reſpects related to the claſſes
          beneath them, and do not in every reſpect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their uſual
          diſtinctions. Their firſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which conſiſts in having four
          feet, is <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0823900104:157"/> common to the lizard kind as well as to them.
          The ſecond prerogative, which is that of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth living young, is
          found in the cetaceous tribe of fiſhes, and alſo in inſects without
          num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Their third and laſt attribute, which ſeems more general and
          conſtant than the former, that of being covered with hair, is yet found in
          various other animals, and is deficient in quadrupedes themſelves. Thus we
          muſt be cautious of judging of the nature of animals from one ſingle
          character, which is always found incomplete; for it often happens that three or
          four of the moſt general characters will not ſuffice. It muſt be by a
          general enumeration of the parts that we can determine preciſely of the works
          of the creation; and, inſtead of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions, learn to deſcribe. Had this
          method been followed, much of the diſguſt and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricacy of hiſtory
          might have been avoided, and that time, which is now employed in combating
          error, laid out in the promoting of ſcience.</p>
            <p>Were we to judge of nature from definitions only, we ſhould never
          be induced to ſuppoſe that there exiſted races of viviparous quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes
          deſtitute of hair, and furniſhed with ſcales and ſhells in their
          ſtead. However, nature, every way various, ſupplies us with many
          in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0823900104:158"/> of theſe extraordinary creatures; the old
          world has its quadrupedes covered with ſcales, and the new with a ſhell. In
          both they reſemble each other, as well in the ſtrangeneſs of their
          appetites as in their aukward conformation. Like animals but partially made up,
          and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of different natures, they want thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts which
          animals formed but for one ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone are found to poſſeſs. They
          ſeem to be a kind of ſtrangers in nature, creatures taken from ſome other
          element, and capriciouſly thrown to find a precarious ſubſiſtence upon
          land.</p>
            <p>The Pangolin, which has been uſually called the Scaly Lizard, Mr.
          Buffon very judiciouſly reſtores to that denomination by which it is known
          in the countries where it is found The calling it a lizard, he juſtly
          obſerves, might be apt to produce error, and occaſion its being confounded
          with an animal which it reſembles only in its general form, and in its being
          covered with ſcales. The lizard may be conſidered as a reptile, produced
          from an egg; the pangolin is a quadrupede, and brought forth alive and
          perfectly formed. The lizard is all over covered with the marks of ſcales;
          the pangolin has ſcales neither on the throat, the breaſt, or the 
          <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:159"/> 
               <figure>

               </figure> 
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0823900104:160"/> belly. The ſcales of the lizard
          ſeem ſtuck upon the body even cloſer than thoſe of fiſhes; the
          ſcales of the pangolin are only fixed at one end, and capable of being
          erected, like thoſe of the porcupine, at the will of the animal. The lizard
          is a defenceleſs creature; the pangolin can roll itſelf into a ball, like
          the hedge-hog, and preſent the points of its ſcales to the enemy, which
          effectually defend it.</p>
            <p>The Pangolin, which is a native of the torrid climates of the
          ancient continent, is, of all other animals, the beſt protected from external
          in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury by Nature. It is about three or four feet long, or, taking in the tail,
          from ſix to eight. Like the lizard, it has a ſmall head, a very long
          noſe, a ſhort thick neck, a long body, legs very ſhort, and a tail
          extremely long, thick at the inſertion, and terminating in a point. It has no
          teeth, but is armed with five toes on each foot, with long white claws. But
          what it is chiefly diſtinguiſhed by is its ſcaly covering, which in
          ſome meaſure hides all the proportions of its body. Theſe ſcales defend
          the animal on all parts, except the under part of the head and neck, under the
          ſhoulders, the breaſt, the belly, and the inner ſide of the legs; all
          which parts are covered with a ſmooth ſoft ſkin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:161"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" resp="#OXF" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0823900104:163"/> hair.
          Between the ſhells of this animal, at all the interſtices, are ſeen hairs
          like briſtles, brown at the extremity and yellow towards the root. The
          ſcales of this extraordinary creature are of different ſizes and different
          forms, and ſtuck upon the body ſomewhat like the leaves of an artichoak.
          The largeſt are found near the tail, which is covered with them like the
          reſt of the body. Theſe are above three inches broad, and about two inches
          long, thick in the middle and ſharp at the edges, and terminated in a
          roundiſh point. They are extremely hard, and their ſubſtance reſembles
          that of horn. They are convex on the outſide and a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave on the
          inner; one edge ſticks in the ſkin, while the other laps over that
          immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it. Thoſe that cover the tail conform to the ſhape of
          that part, being of a duſky brown colour, and ſo hard, when the animal has
          ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired its full growth, as to turn a muſquet-ball.</p>
            <p>Thus armed, this animal fears nothing from the efforts of all other
          creatures, except man. The inſtant it perceives the approach of an enemy, it
          rolls itſelf up like the hedge-hog, and preſents no part but the cutting
          edges of its ſcales to the aſſailant. Its long tail, which, 
          <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0823900104:164"/> at firſt view, might be thought eaſily ſeparable,
          ſerves ſtill more to encreaſe the animal's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. This is lapped
          round the reſt of the body, and, being defended with ſhells even more
          cutting than any other part, the creature continues in perfect ſecurity. Its
          ſhells are ſo large, ſo thick, and ſo pointed, that they repel every
          animal of prey; they make a coat of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that wounds while it reſiſts,
          and at once protects and threatens. The moſt cruel, the moſt famiſhed
          quadrupede of the foreſt, the tiger, the panther, and the hyena, make vain
          attempts to force it. They tread upon, they roll it about, but all to no
          purpoſe; the pangolin remains ſafe within, while its invader almoſt
          always feels the reward of its raſhneſs. The fox often deſtroys the
          hedge-hog by preſſing it with his weight, and thus obliges it to put forth
          its noſe, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſeizes, and ſoon after the whole body;
          but the ſcales of the pangolin effectually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it under any ſuch
          weight, while nothing that the ſtrongeſt animals are capable of doing can
          compel it to ſurrender. Man alone ſeems furniſhed with arms to conquer
          its obſtinacy. The Negroes of Africa, when they find it, beat it to death
          with clubs, and conſider its fleſh as a very great delicacy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0823900104:165"/>But, although this animal be ſo formidable
          in its appearance, there cannot be a more harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs inoffenſive creature
          when unmoleſted. It is even unqualified by Nature to injure larger animals,
          if it had the diſpoſition, for it has no teeth. It ſhould ſeem that the
          bony matter, which goes in other animals to ſupply the teeth, is exhauſted
          in this in ſupplying the ſcales that go to the covering of its body.
          However this be, its life ſeems correſpondent to its peculiar conformation.
          Incapable of being carnivorous, ſince it has no teeth, nor of
          ſubſiſting on ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, which require much chewing, it lives entirely
          upon inſects, for which Nature has fitted it in a very extraordinary manner.
          As it has a long noſe, ſo it may naturally be ſuppoſed to have a long
          tongue; but, to encreaſe its length ſtill more, it is doubled in the mouth,
          ſo that when extended it is ſhot out to above a quarter of a yard beyond
          the tip of the noſe. This tongue is round, extremely red, and covered with an
          unctuous and ſlimy liquor, which gives it a ſhining hue. When the pangolin,
          therefore, approaches an ant hill, for theſe are the inſects on which it
          chiefly feeds, it lies down near it, concealing as much as poſſible the
          place of its retreat, and ſtretching out its long tongue 
          <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0823900104:166"/> among the ants, keeps it for ſome time quite
          immoveable. Theſe little animals, allured by its appearance, and the unctuous
          ſubſtance with which it is imeared, inſtantly gather upon it in great
          numbers; and when the pangolin ſuppoſes a ſufficiency, it quickly
          withdraws the tongue, and ſwallows them at once. This peculiar manner of
          hunting for its prey is repeated either till it be ſatisfied, or till the
          ants, grown more cautious, will be allured to their deſtruction no longer. It
          is againſt theſe noxious inſects, therefore, that its only force or
          cunning is exerted; and were the Negroes but ſufficiently ſenſible of its
          utility in deſtroying one of the greateſt peſts to their country, they
          would not be ſo eager to kill it. But it is the nature of ſavage man to
          purſue the immediate good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſolicitous about the more
          diſtant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit they remove. They, therefore, hunt this animal, with the
          utmoſt avidity, for its fleſh; and, as it is ſlow and unable to eſcape
          in an open place, they ſeldom fail of deſtroying it. However, it chiefly
          keeps in the moſt obſcure parts of the foreſt, and digs itſelf a
          retreat in the clefts of rocks, where it brings forth its young, ſo that it
          is but rarely met with, and continues a ſolitary ſpecies, and an
          extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary inſtance of the varying of Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0823900104:167"/>Of this animal, there is a variety which is
          called the Phatagin, much leſs than the former, being not above a foot long
          from the head to the tail, with ſhells differently formed, with its belly,
          breaſt, and throat covered with hair, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a ſmooth ſkin as in
          the former; but that by which it is peculiarly diſtinguiſhed is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
          of its tail, which is above twice the length of its body. Both are found in the
          warm lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the Eaſt, as well as in Africa; and, as their numbers are
          but few, it is to be ſuppoſed their fecundity is not great.</p>

            remote deſerts where they have no enemies but ſuch as they are enabled to
            oppoſe.</p>
               <p>The Armadillo is chiefly an inhabitant of South America; a
            peaceful harmleſs creature, incapable of offending any other quadrupede, and
            furniſhed with a peculiar covering for its own defence. The pangolin,
            deſcribed above, ſeems an inactive helpleſs being, indebted for ſafety
            more to its patience than its power; but the armadillo is ſtill more
            expoſed and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. The pangolin is furniſhed with an armour that
            wounds while it reſiſts, and that is never attacked with impunity; but the
            armadillo is obliged to ſubmit to every inſult, without any power of
            repelling its enemy; it is attacked without danger, and is conſequently
            liable to more various perſecutions.</p>
               <p>This animal being covered, like a tortoiſe, with a ſhell, or
            rather a number of ſhells, its other proportions are not eaſily
            diſcerned. It appears, at firſt view, a round miſhapen maſs, with a
            long head, and a very large tail ſticking out at either end, as if not of a
            piece with the <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0823900104:172"/> reſt of the body. It is of different
            ſizes, from a foot to three feet long, and covered with a ſhell divided
            into ſeveral pieces, that lap over each other like the plates in a coat of
            armour, or in the tail of a lobſter. The difference in the ſize of this
            animal, and alſo the different diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and number of its plates,
            have been conſidered as conſtituting ſo many ſpecies, each marked with
            its own particular name. In all, however, the animal is partially covered with
            this natural coat of mail; the confirmation of which affords one of the moſt
            ſtriking curioſities in natural hiſtory. This ſhell, which in every
            reſpect reſembles a bony ſubſtance, covers the head, the neck, the
            back, the ſides, the rump, and the tail to the very point. The only parts to
            which it does not extend are, the throat, the breaſt, and the belly, which
            are covered with a white ſoft ſkin, ſomewhat reſembling that of a fowl
            ſtripped of its feathers. If theſe naked parts be obſerved with
            attention, they will be found covered with the rudiments of ſhells, of the
            ſame ſubſtance with thoſe which cover the back. The ſkin, even in the
            parts that are ſofteſt, ſeems to have a tendency to oſſify; but a
            complete oſſification takes place only on thoſe parts which have the
            leaſt friction and are the <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0823900104:173"/> moſt expoſed to the
            weather. The ſhell, which covers the upper part of the body, differs from
            that of the tortoiſe, in being compoſed of more pieces than one, which lie
            in bands over the body, and, as in the tail of the lobſter, ſlide over each
            other, and are connected by a yellow membrane in the ſame manner. By this
            means the animal has a motion in its back, and the armour gives way to its
            neceſſary inflexions. Theſe bands are of various numbers and ſizes, and
            from them theſe animals have been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into various kinds. In
            general, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, there are two large pieces that cover, one the ſhoulders
            and the other the rump. In the back, between theſe, the bands are placed in
            different numbers, that lap over each other, and give play to the whole.
            Beſides their open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing croſs-ways, they alſo open down along the back,
            ſo that the animal can move in every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. In ſome there are but
            three of theſe bands between the large pieces; in others there are ſix; in
            a third kind there are eight; in a fourth kind, nine; in a fifth kind, twelve;
            and, laſtly, in the ſixth kind there is but one large piece, which covers
            the ſhoulders, and the reſt of the body is covered with bands all down to
            the tail. Theſe ſhells are differently coloured <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0823900104:174"/> in
            different kinds, but moſt uſually they are of a dirty grey. This colour in
            all ariſes from another peculiar circumſtance in their confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, for
            the ſhell itſelf is covered with a ſoftiſh ſkin, which is ſmooth
            and tranſparent.</p>
               <p>But, although theſe ſhells might eaſily defend this animal
            from a feeble enemy, yet they could make but a ſlight reſiſtance
            againſt a more powerful antagoniſt; Nature, therefore, has given the
            armadillo the ſame method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting itſelf with the hedge-hog or the
            pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golin. The inſtant it perceives itſelf attacked, it withdraws the head
            under its ſhells, and lets nothing be ſeen but the tip of the noſe; if
            the danger encreaſes, the animal's precautions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in proportion; it
            then tucks up its feet under its belly, unites its two extremities to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
            while the tail ſeems as a band to ſtrengthen the connection; and it thus
            becomes like a ball, a little flattiſh on each ſide. In this poſition it
            continues obſtinately fixed, while the danger is near, and often long after
            it is over. In this ſituation it is toſſed about at the pleaſure of
            every other quadrupede, and very little reſembling a creature endowed with
            life and motion. Whenever the Indians take it, which is in this form, by laying
            it cloſe to the <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0823900104:175"/> fire, they ſoon oblige the poor
            animal to unfold itſelf, and to face a milder death to eſcape a more
            ſevere.</p>
               <p>This animal is a native only of America, for they were utterly
            unknown before the diſcovery of that continent. It is an inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
            harmleſs creature, unleſs it finds the way into a garden, where it does a
            great deal of miſchief, by eating the melons, the potatoes, and other
            vegetables. Although a native of the warmeſt parts of America, yet it bears
            the cold of our climate without any inconvenience. We have often ſeen them
            ſhewn among other wild beaſts, which is a ſign they are not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to
            be brought over. Their motion ſeems to be a ſwift walk, but they can
            neither run, leap, nor climb trees; ſo that, if found in an open place, they
            have no method of eſcaping from their purſuers. Their only reſource in
            ſuch an extremity is to make towards their hole as faſt as they can; or, if
            this be impracticable, to make a new hole before the enemy arrives. For this
            they require but a very few moments advantage; for the mole itſelf does not
            burrow ſwifter than they can. For this purpoſe, they are furniſhed with
            claws extremely large, ſtrong, and crooked, and uſually four upon each
            foot. They are ſometimes caught by the tail as they <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0823900104:176"/>
            are making their way into the earth; but ſuch is their reſiſtance, and
            ſo difficult it is to draw them backward, that they leave their tail in the
            hand of their purſuer, and are very well contented to ſave their lives with
            its loſs. The purſuers, ſenſible of this, never drag the tail with all
            their force, but hold it while another digs the ground about them, and thus
            theſe animals are taken alive. The inſtant the arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dillo perceives
            itſelf in the power of its enemies, it has but one laſt reſource, to roll
            itſelf up, and thus patiently wait whatever tortures they think proper to
            inflict. The fleſh of the ſmaller kinds is ſaid to be delicate eating;
            ſo that we may ſuppoſe they receive no mercy. For this reaſon, they are
            purſued with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing induſtry; and, although they burrow very deep in
            the earth, there have been many expedients uſed to force them out. The
            hunters ſometimes contrive to fill the hole with ſmoke, which is often
            ſucceſsful; they at other times force it by pouring in water. They alſo
            bring up a ſmall kind of dogs to the chace that quickly overtake them, if at
            any diſtance from their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and oblige them to roll themſelves up in a
            ball, in which figure the hunters carry them home. If, however, the armadillo
            be near a precipice, it often eſcapes by rolling itſelf up, 
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0823900104:177"/> and then tumbling down from rock to rock, without the
            leaſt danger or inconvenience. They are ſometimes taken in ſnares laid
            for them by the ſides of rivers and low moiſt places, which they
            particularly frequent; and this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, in general, ſucceeds better than any
            of the former, as their burrows are very deep, and they ſeldom ſtir out
            except in the night. At no time are they found at any great diſtance from
            their retreats, ſo that it requires ſome patience and ſkill to intercept
            their retreat.</p>
               <p>There are ſcarce any of theſe that do not root the ground,
            like an hog, in ſearch of ſuch roots as make a principal part of their
            food. They live alſo upon melons and other ſucculent ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, and all
            will eat fleſh when they can get it. They frequent water and watery places,
            where they feed upon worms, ſmall fiſh, and water inſects. It is
            pretended that there is a kind of friendſhip between them and the
            rattle-ſnake, that they live peaceably and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly together, and are
            frequently found in the ſame hole. This, however, may be a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of
            neceſſity to the armadillo; the rattle-ſnake takes poſſeſſion of
            its retreats, which neither are willing to quit while each is inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of
            injuring the other.</p>
               <p>As to the reſt, theſe animals, though they 
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0823900104:178"/> all reſemble each other in the general character of
            being cloathed with a ſhell, yet differ a good deal in their ſize, and in
            the parts into which their ſhell is divided. The firſt of this kind, which
            has but three bands between the two large pieces that cover the back, is called
            the Tatu Apara. I will not enter into an exact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of its figure,
            which, how well written ſoever, no imagination could exactly conceive; and
            the reader would be more fatigued to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand than I to write it. The tail
            is ſhorter in this than any other kind, being not more than two inches long,
            while the ſhell, taking all the pieces together, is a foot long and eight
            inches broad. The ſecond is the Tatou of Ray, or the Encoubert of Buffon;
            this is diſtinguiſhed from the reſt by ſix bands acroſs the back; it
            is about the ſize of a pig of a month old, with a ſmall long head and a
            very long tail. The third is the Tatuette, furniſhed with eight bands, and
            not by a great deal ſo big as the former. Its tail is longer alſo, and its
            legs ſhorter in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. Its body, from the noſe to the inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
            the tail, is about ten inches long, and the tail ſeven. The fourth is the
            Pig-headed Armadillo, with nine bands. This is much larger than the former,
            being about two foot long from the noſe to the tail. The fifth is the 
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0823900104:179"/> Kabaſſou, or Cataphractus, with twelve bands, and
            ſtill bigger than the former, or any other of its kind. This is often found
            above three feet long, but is never eaten as the reſt are. The ſixth is the
            Weaſel-headed Armadillo, with eighteen bands, with a large piece before, and
            nothing but bands backward. This is above a foot long, and the tail five
            inches. Of all theſe, the Kabbaſſou and the Encoubert are the largeſt;
            the reſt are of a much ſmaller kind. In the larger kinds, the ſhell is
            much more ſolid than in the others, and the fleſh is much harder and unfit
            for the table. Theſe are generally ſeen to reſide in dry upland grounds,
            while the ſmall ſpecies are always found in moiſt places, and in the
            neighbourhood of brooks and rivers. They all roll themſelves into a ball; but
            thoſe whoſe bands are feweſt in number are leaſt capable of covering
            themſelves up completely. The Tatu Apara, for inſtance, when rolled up,
            preſents two great interſtices between its bands, by which it is very
            eaſily vulnerable, even by the feebleſt of quadrupedes.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. Of Animals of the Bat Kind.</head>
            <p>HAVING in the laſt chapter deſcribed a race of animals that
          unite the boundaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween quadrupedes and inſects, I come in this to a
          very different claſs, that ſerve to fill up the chaſm between quadrupedes
          and birds. Some naturaliſts, indeed, have found animals of the bat kind ſo
          much partaking of the nature of both, that they have been at a loſs in which
          rank to place them, and have doubted, in giving the hiſtory of the Bat,
          whether it was a beaſt or a bird they were deſcribing. Theſe doubts,
          however, no longer exiſt; they are now univerſally made to take their place
          among quadrupedes, to which their bringing forth their young alive, their hair,
          their teeth, as well as the reſt of their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and conformation,
          evidently entitle them. Pliny, Geſner, and Aldrovandus, who placed them among
          birds, did not conſider that they wanted every character of that order of
          animals, except the power of flying. Indeed, when this animal is ſeen with an
          aukward and ſtruggling motion, ſupporting itſelf in the air at the duſk
          of the evening, it preſents in ſome meaſure the <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0823900104:181"/>
          appearance of a bird; but naturaliſts, whoſe buſineſs it is to examine
          it more cloſely, to watch its habitudes, and inſpect into its forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
          are inexcuſable for concurring in the miſtake.</p>
            <p>The bat in ſcarce any particular reſembles the bird, except in
          its power of ſuſtaining itſelf in the air. It brings forth its young
          alive; it ſuckles them; its mouth is furniſhed with teeth; its lungs are
          formed like thoſe of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupedes; its inteſtines, and its ſkeleton, have
          a complete reſemblance, and even are, in ſome meaſure, ſeen to
          reſemble thoſe of mankind<note n="*" place="bottom">Penis
            Propendens.</note>.</p>
            <p>The bat moſt common in England, is about the ſize of a mouſe;
          or nearly two inches and an half long. The membranes that are uſually called
          wings, are, properly ſpeaking, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the ſkin all round the
          body, except the head, which, when the animal flies, is kept ſtretched on
          every ſide, by the four interior toes of the fore feet, which are
          enormouſly long, and ſerve like maſts that keep the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſs of a
          ſail ſpread, and regulate its motions<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Britiſh Zoology.</bibl>
               </note>. The firſt toe is quite
          looſe, and ſerves as a heel when the bat walks, or as an hook, when it
          would adhere to any thing. The hind feet are diſengaged from the
          ſurrounding ſkin, <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0823900104:182"/> and divided into five toes,
          ſomewhat reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thoſe of a mouſe. The ſkin by which it flies is
          of a duſky colour. The body is covered with a ſhort fur, of a mouſe
          colour, tinged with red. The eyes are very ſmall; the ears like thoſe of a
          mouſe.</p>
            <p>This ſpecies of the bat is very common in England. It makes its
          firſt appearance early in ſummer, and begins its flight in the duſk of
          the evening. It principally frequents the ſides of woods, glades, and ſhady
          walks; and is frequently obſerved to ſkim along the ſurface of pieces of
          water. It purſues gnats, moths, and nocturnal inſects of every kind. It
          feeds upon theſe; but will not refuſe meat, wherever it can find it. Its
          flight is a laborious, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular movement; and if it happens to be
          in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted in its courſe, it cannot readily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for a ſecond
          elevation; ſo that if it ſtrikes againſt any object, and falls to the
          ground, it is uſually taken. It appears only in the moſt pleaſant
          evenings, when its prey is generally abroad, and flies in purſuit with its
          mouth open. At other times it continues in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; the chink of a ruined
          building, or the hollow of a tree. Thus this little animal, even in ſummer,
          ſleeps the greateſt part of its time, never venturing out by day-light, nor
          in rainy <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0823900104:183"/> weather; never hunting in queſt of prey, but
          for a ſmall part of the night, and then return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its hole. But its
          ſhort life is ſtill more abridged by continuing in a torpid ſtate during
          the winter. At the approach of the cold ſeaſon, the bat prepares for its
          ſtate of lifeleſs inactivity, and ſeems rather to chuſe a place where
          it may continue ſafe from interruption, than where it may be warmly or
          conveniently lodged. For this reaſon it is uſually ſeen hanging by its
          hooked claws to the roofs of caves, regardleſs of the eternal damps that
          ſurround it. The bat ſeems the only animal that will venture to remain in
          theſe frightful ſubterranean abodes, where it continues in a torpid
          ſtate, unaffected by every change of the weather. Such of this kind as are
          not provident enough to procure themſelves a deep retreat, where the cold and
          heat ſeldom vary, are ſometimes expoſed to great inconveniences, for the
          weather often becomes ſo mild in the midſt of winter as to warm them
          prematurely into life, and to allure them from their holes in queſt of food,
          when Nature has not provided a ſupply. Theſe, therefore, have ſeldom
          ſtrength to return; but, having exhauſted themſelves in a vain purſuit,
          after inſects which are not to be found, are deſtroyed by the owl, or any
          other animal that follows ſuch petty prey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0823900104:184"/>The bat couples and brings forth in ſummer,
          generally from two to five at a time: of this I am certain, that I have found
          five young ones in a hole together; but whether they were the iſſue of one
          parent, I cannot tell. The female has but two nipples, and thoſe forward on
          the breaſt, as in the human kind. This was a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient motive for
          Linnaeus to give it the title of a Primas, to rank it in the ſame order with
          mankind; and to puſh this contemptible animal among the chiefs of the
          creation. Such ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary aſſociations produce rather ridicule than
          inſtruction, and render even method contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible: however, we are to forgive
          too ſtrong an attachment to ſyſtem in this able naturaliſt, ſince his
          application to the particular hiſtory of the animal, counterbalances the
          defect<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Fauna Succica. p. 8.</bibl>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>From Linnaeus we learn, that the female makes no neſt for her
          young, as moſt birds and quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes are known to do. She is barely content
          with the firſt hole ſhe meets, where ſticking her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by her hooks
          againſt the ſides of her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe permits her young to hang at the
          nipple, and in this manner to continue for the firſt or ſecond day. When,
          after ſome time, the dam begins to grow hungry, and finds a neceſſity of
          ſtirring abroad, ſhe takes her little <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0823900104:185"/> ones and
          ſticks them to the wall, in the manner ſhe before hung herſelf; there
          they immoveably cling, and patiently wait till her return.</p>
            <p>Thus far this animal ſeems cloſely allied to the quadrupede
          race. Its ſimilitude to that of birds is leſs ſtriking. As Nature has
          furniſhed birds with extremely ſtrong pectoral muſcles, to move the
          wings, and direct their flight, ſo has it alſo furniſhed this animal. As
          birds alſo have their legs weak, and unfit for the purpoſes of motion, the
          bat has its legs faſhioned in the ſame manner, and is never ſeen to walk,
          or, more properly ſpeaking, to puſh itſelf forward with its hind legs,
          but in caſes of extreme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. The toes of the fore legs, or, if we
          may uſe the expreſſion, its extremely long fingers, extend the web like a
          membrane that lies between them; and this, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely thin, ſerves
          to lift the little body into the air: in this manner, by an unceaſing
          per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, much ſwifter than that of birds, the animal continues, and
          directs its flight; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the great labour required in flying, ſoon
          fatigues it; for, unlike birds, which continue for days together upon the wing,
          the bat is tired in leſs than an hour, and then returns to its hole,
          ſatisfied with its ſupply, to enjoy the darkneſs of its retreat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0823900104:186"/>If we conſider the bat as it is ſeen in
          our own country, we ſhall find it an harmleſs, inoffenſive creature. It
          is true that it now and then ſteals into a larder, and, like a mouſe,
          commits its petty thefts upon the fatteſt parts of the bacon. But this
          happens ſeldom; the general tenor of its induſtry is employed in purſuing

          nature.</p>
            <p>The varieties of this animal, eſpecially in our country, are but
          few; and the differences ſcarce worth enumeration. Naturaliſts mention the
          Long ear'd Bat, much leſs than that generally ſeen, and with much longer
          ears; the Horſe ſhoe Bat, with an odd protuberance round its upper lip,
          ſomewhat in the form of an horſe-ſhoe; the Rhinoceros Bat, with an horn
          growing from the noſe, ſomewhat ſimilar to that animal from whence it has
          the name. Theſe, with ſeveral others, whoſe varieties are too numerous,
          and differences too minute for a detail, are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive, minute, and
          contemptible; incapable, from their ſize, of injuring mankind, and not
          ſufficiently numerous much to incommode him. But there is a larger race of
          bats, found in the <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0823900104:187"/> Eaſt and Weſt-Indies, that are
          truly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable; each of theſe is ſingly a dangerous enemy; but when they
          unite in flocks, they then become dreadful. Were the inhabitants of the African

               </note>, ſays Des Marchais, to eat animals of the bat kind, as
          they do in the Eaſt-Indies, they would never want a ſupply of proviſions.
          They are there in ſuch numbers, that, when they fly, they obſcure the
          ſetting ſun. In the morning, at peep of day, they are ſeen ſticking
          upon the tops of the trees, and clinging to each other, like bees when they
          ſwarm, or like large cluſters of coco. The Europeans often amuſe
          themſelves with ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among this huge maſs of living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and
          obſerving their embarraſſment when wounded. They ſometimes enter the
          houſes, and the Negroes are expert at killing them; but although theſe
          people ſeem for ever hungry, yet they regard the bat with horror, and will
          not eat it, though ready to ſtarve.</p>
            <p>Of foreign bats, the largeſt we have any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain accounts of, is
          the Rouſette, or the Great Bat of Madagaſcar. This formidable creature is
          near four feet broad, when the wings are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and a foot long, from the
          tip of the <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0823900104:188"/> noſe to the inſertion of the tail. It
          reſembles our bat in the form of its wings, in its manner of flying, and in
          its internal conformation. It differs from it in its enormous ſize; in its
          colour, which is red, like that of a fox; in its head and noſe alſo, which
          reſemble thoſe of that animal, and which have induced ſome to call it the
          flying fox: it differs alſo in the number of its teeth; and in having a claw
          on the fore foot, which is wanting in ours. This formidable creature is found
          only in the ancient continent; particularly in Madagaſcar, along the coaſts
          of Africa and Malabar, where it is uſually ſeen about the ſize of a large
          hen. When they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they ſtick themſelves to the tops of the
          talleſt trees, and hang with their heads down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But when they are in
          motion, nothing can be more formidable: they are ſeen in clouds, darkening
          the air, as well by day as by night, deſtroying the ripe fruits of the
          country, and ſometimes ſettling upon animals, and man himſelf: they
          devour, indiſcriminately, fruits, fleſh, and inſects, and drink the juice
          of the palm-tree: they are heard at night in the foreſts at more than two
          miles diſtance, with an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible din; but at the approach of day, they
          uſually begin to retire: nothing is ſafe from <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:189"/>

          deformed, and ſtill more numerous. It is furniſhed with an horn like the
          rhinoceros bat; and its ears are extremely long. The other kinds generally
          reſort to the foreſt, and the moſt deſerted places; but theſe come

          <q rend="inline">"They are," ſays Ulloa, "the moſt expert
            blood-letters in the world. The inhabitants of thoſe warm lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes being
            obliged, by the exceſſive heats, to <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0823900104:193"/> leave open the
            doors and windows of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers where they ſleep, the vampyres enter, and
            if they find any part of the body expoſed, they never fail to faſten upon
            it. There they continue to ſuck the blood; and it often happens that the
            perſon dies under the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They inſinuate their tooth into a vein,
            with all the art of the moſt experienced ſurgeon, continuing to exhauſt
            the body, until they are ſatiated. I have been aſſured," continues he,
            "by perſons of the ſtricteſt veracity, that ſuch an accident has
            happened to them; and that, had they not providentially awaked, their ſleep
            would have been their paſſage into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; having loſt ſo large a
            quantity of blood as hardly to find ſtrength to bind up the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. The
            reaſon why the puncture is not felt is, beſides the great precaution with
            which it is made, the gentle refreſhing agitation of the bat's wings, which
            contribute to encreaſe ſleep, and ſoften the pain."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The purport of this account has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by various other
          travellers; who all agree that this bat is poſſeſſed of a faculty of
          drawing the blood from perſons ſleeping; and thus often deſtroying them
          before they awake. But ſtill a very ſtrong difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains 
          <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0823900104:194"/> to be accounted for; the manner in which they inflict
          the wound. Ulloa, as has been ſeen, ſuppoſes that it is done by a
          ſingle tooth; but this we know to be impoſſible, ſince the animal
          cannot infix one tooth without all the reſt accompanying its motions; the
          teeth of the bat kind being pretty even, and the mouth but ſmall. Mr. Buffon
          therefore ſuppoſes the wound to be inflicted by the tongue; which, however,
          appears to me too large to inflict an unpainful wound; and even leſs
          qualified for that purpoſe than the teeth. Nor can the tongue, as Mr. Buffon
          ſeems to ſuppoſe, ſerve for the purpoſes of ſuction, ſince for
          this it muſt be hollow, like a ſyringe, which it is not found to be. I
          ſhould therefore ſuppoſe, that the animal is endowed with a ſtrong
          power of ſuction; and that, without inflicting any wound whatſoever, by
          continuing to draw, it enlarges the pores of the ſkin in ſuch a manner that
          the blood at length paſſes, and that more freely the longer the operation
          is continued; ſo that, at laſt, when the bat goes off, the blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
          to flow. In confirmation of this opinion we are told, that where beaſts have
          a thick ſkin, this animal cannot injure them; whereas, in horſes, mules,
          and aſſes, they are very liable <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0823900104:195"/> to be thus
          deſtroyed. As to the reſt, theſe animals are conſidered as one of the
          great peſts of South America; and often prevent the peopling of many parts of
          that continent: having deſtroyed at Barja, and ſeveral other places, ſuch
          cattle as were brought there by the miſſionaries, in order to form a

            <head>CHAP. VI. Of Amphibious Quadrupedes.</head>
            <p>THE gradations of Nature from one claſs of beings to another are
          made by imperceptible devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. As we ſaw in the foregoing chapters
          qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupedes almoſt degraded into the inſect tribe, or mounted among the
          inhabitants of the air, we are at preſent to obſerve their approach to
          fiſhes, to trace the degrees by which they become more unlike terreſtrial
          animals, till the ſimilitude of the fiſh prevails over that of the
          quadrupede.</p>
            <p>As in oppoſite armies the two bodies are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and
          ſeparated from each other, while yet between them are various troops that
          plunder on both ſides and are friends to neither, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween terreſtrial
          and aquatic animals there are tribes that can ſcarce be referred to any rank,
          but lead an amphibious life between them. Sometimes in water, ſometimes on
          land, they ſeem fitted for each element, and yet completely adapted to
          neither. Wanting the agility of quadrupedes upon land, and the perſeverance
          of fiſhes in the deep, the variety of their powers only ſeems to diminiſh
          their force; and, though poſſeſſed of two different methods of living, 
          <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0823900104:197"/> they are more inconveniently provided than ſuch as
          have but one.</p>
            <p>All quadrupedes of this kind, though co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with hair in the
          uſual manner, are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with membranes between the toes, which
          aſſiſt their motion in the water. Their paws are broad and their legs
          ſhort, by which they are more completely fitted for ſwimming, for taking
          ſhort ſtrokes at a time they make them oftner and with greater rapidity.
          Some, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, of theſe animals are more adapted to live in the water than
          others; but, as their power encreaſes to live in the deep, their unfitneſs
          for living upon land encreaſes in the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some, like the
          otter, reſemble quadrupedes in every thing except in being in ſome
          meaſure web-footed; others depart ſtill further, in being, like the beaver,
          not only web-footed, but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tail covered with ſcales, like thoſe
          of a fiſh. Others depart yet farther, as the ſeal and the morſe, by
          having the hind feet ſtuck to the body like fins; and others, as the
          lamentin, almoſt entirely reſemble fiſhes, by having no hind feet
          whatſoever. Such are the gradations of the amphibious tribe. They all,
          however, get their living in the water, either by habit or conformation; they
          all continue a long time under water; they all conſider that element as 
          <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0823900104:198"/> their proper abode; whenever preſt by danger, they fly
          to the water for ſecurity; and, when upon land, appear watchful, timorous,
          and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy.</p>
            <p>In the firſt ſtep of the progreſſion from land to amphibious
          animals, we find the Otter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling thoſe of the terreſtrial kind in
          ſhape, hair, and internal conformation; reſembling the aquatic tribes in
          its manner of living, and in having membranes between the toes to aſſiſt
          it in ſwimming. From this peculiar make of its feet, which are very ſhort,
          it ſwims even faſter than it runs, and can overtake fiſhes in their own
          element. The colour of this animal is brown; and it is ſomewhat of the
          ſhape of an overgrown weaſel, being long, ſlender, and ſoft ſkinned.
          However, if we examine its figure in detail, we ſhall find it unlike any
          other animal hitherto deſcribed, and of ſuch a ſhape as words can but
          weakly convey. Its uſual length is about two feet long, from the tip of the
          noſe to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the tail; the head and noſe are broad and flat;
          the mouth bears ſome ſimilitude to that of a fiſh; the neck is ſhort,
          and equal in thickneſs to the head; the body long; the tail broad at the
          inſertion, but tapering off to a point at the end; the eyes are very ſmall,
          and placed nearer the noſe than uſual in quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes. 
          <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0823900104:199"/> The legs are very ſhort, but remarkably ſtrong,
          broad, and muſcular. The joints are articulated ſo looſely, that the
          animal is capable of turning them quite back, and bringing them on a line with
          the body, ſo as to perform the office of fins. Each foot is furniſhed with
          five toes, connected by ſtrong broad webs like thoſe of water fowl. Thus
          Nature, in every part, has had attention to the life of an animal whoſe food
          is fiſh, and whoſe haunts muſt neceſſarily be about water.</p>
            <p>This voracious animal is never found but at the ſides of lakes and
          rivers, but particularly the former, for it is ſeldom fond of fiſhing in a
          running ſtream, for the current of the water having more power upon it than
          the fiſhes it purſues, if it hunts againſt the ſtream it ſwims too
          ſlow; and if with the ſtream, it overſhoots its prey. However, when in
          rivers, it is always obſerved to ſwim againſt the ſtream, and to meet
          the fiſhes it preys upon rather than to purſue them. In lakes it deſtroys
          much more than it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and is often ſeen to ſpoil a pond in the
          ſpace of a few nights. But the damage they do by deſtroying fiſh is not
          ſo great as their tearing in pieces the nets of the fiſhers, which they
          infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly do whenever they happen to be entangled. The inſtant they find
          themſelves caught, they <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:200"/>

          work with their teeth, and in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes deſtroy nets of a very
          conſiderable value.</p>
            <p>The otter has two different methods of fiſhing; the one by
          catching its prey from the bottom upward, the other by purſuing it into
          ſome little creek and ſeizing it there. In the former caſe, as this
          animal has longer lungs than moſt other quadrupedes, upon taking in a
          quantity of air, it can remain for ſome minutes at the bottom; and whatever
          fiſh paſſes over at that time is certainly taken; for, as the eyes of
          fiſh are placed ſo as not to ſee under them, the otter attacks them off
          their guard from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and, ſeizing them at once by the belly, drags them
          on ſhore, where it often leaves them untouched, to continue the purſuit for
          hours together. The other method is chiefly practiſed in lakes and ponds,
          where there is no current; the fiſh thus taken are rather of the ſmaller
          kind, for the great ones will never be driven out of deep water.</p>
            <p>In this manner the otter uſually lives during the ſummer, being
          furniſhed with a ſupply much greater than its conſumption; killing for
          its amuſement, and infecting the edges of the lake with quantities of dead
          fiſh, which it leaves there as trophies rather of its victory than its
          neceſſities. But in winter, when the lakes are <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0823900104:204"/>
          frozen over, and the rivers pour with a rapid torrent, the otter is often
          greatly diſtreſſed for proviſions; and is then obliged to live upon
          graſs, weeds, and even the bark of trees. It then comes upon land, and, grown
          courageous from neceſſity, feeds upon terreſtrial animals, rats,
          inſects, and even ſheep themſelves. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, however, has given it the
          power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing a long time without food; and, although during that
          ſeaſon it is not rendered quite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, like the marmout or the
          dormouſe, yet it keeps much more within its retreat, which is uſually the
          hollow of a bank worn under by the water. There it often forms a kind of
          gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, running for ſeveral yards along the edge of the water; ſo that
          when attacked at one end, it flies to the other, and often evades the fowler by
          plunging into the water at forty or fifty paces diſtance, while he expects to
          find it juſt before him.</p>
            <p>We learn from Mr. Buffon that this animal, in France, couples in
          winter and brings forth in the beginning of ſpring. But it is certainly
          different with us, for its young are never found till the latter end of
          ſummer; and I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, when a boy, diſcovered their retreats, and
          purſued them at that ſeaſon. I am, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, more inclined to follow
          the account given <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0823900104:205"/> us of this animal by Mr. Lots, of the
          Academy of Stockholm, who aſſures us that it couples about the middle of
          ſummer, and brings forth, at the end of nine weeks, generally three or four

            <p>In the rivers and the lakes frequented by the otter, the bottom is
          generally ſtony and uneven, with many trunks of trees, and long roots
          ſtretching underneath the water<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>. The ſhore alſo is hollow and
          ſcooped inward by the waves. Theſe are the places the otter chiefly
          chuſes for its retreat; and there is ſcarce a ſtone which does not bear
          the mark of its reſidence, as upon them its excrements are always made. It is
          chiefly by this mark that its lurking places are known, as well as by the
          quantity of dead fiſh that are found lying here and there upon the banks of
          the water. To take the old ones alive is no eaſy taſk, as they are
          extremely ſtrong, and there are few dogs that will dare to encounter them.
          They bite with great fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0823900104:206"/> and never let go
          their hold when they have once faſtened. The beſt way, therefore, is to
          ſhoot them at once, as they never will be thoroughly tamed; and, if kept for
          the purpoſes of fiſhing, are always apt to take the firſt opportunity of
          eſcaping. But the young ones may be more eaſily taken, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to
          very uſeful purpoſes. The otter brings forth its young generally under the
          hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low banks, upon a bed of ruſhes, flags, or ſuch weeds as the place
          affords it in greateſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities. I ſee in the Britiſh Zoology a
          deſcription of its habitation, where that naturaliſt obſerves, 
          <q rend="inline">"that it burrows under ground, on the banks of
            ſome river or lake, and always makes the entrance of its hole under water,
            then works up to the ſurface of the earth, and there makes a minute orifice
            for the admiſſion of air; and this little air-hole is often found in the
            middle of ſome thicket."</q> In ſome places this may be true, but I have
          never obſerved any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance; the retreat, indeed, was always at
          the edge of the water, but it was only ſheltered by the impending bank, and
          the otter itſelf ſeemed to have but a ſmall ſhare in its formation.
          But, be this as it may, the young ones are always found at the edge of the
          water; and, if under the protection of the dam, ſhe teaches 
          <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0823900104:207"/> them inſtantly to plunge, like herſelf, into the
          deep, and eſcape among the ruſhes or weeds that fringe the ſtream. At
          ſuch times, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is very difficult to take them; for, though never
          ſo young they ſwim with great rapidity, and in ſuch a manner that no part
          of them is ſeen above water, except the tip of the noſe. It is only when
          the dam is abſent that they can be taken; and in ſome places there are dogs
          purpoſely trained for diſcovering their retreats. Whenever the dog comes to
          the place, he ſoon, by his barking, ſhews that the otter is there; which,
          if there be an old one, inſtantly plunges into the water, and the young all
          follow. But if the old one be abſent, they continue terrified, and will not
          venture forth but under her guidance and protection. In this manner they are
          ſecured and taken home alive, where they are carefully fed with ſmall
          fiſh and water. In proportion, however, as they gather ſtrength, they have
          milk mixed among their food, the quantity of their fiſh proviſion is
          retrenched, and that of vegetables is encreaſed, until at length they are fed
          wholly upon bread, which perfectly agrees with their conſtitution. The manner
          of training them up to hunt for fiſh requires not only aſſiduity but
          patience; however, their activity and uſe, when <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0823900104:208"/>
          taught, greatly repays the trouble of teaching; and, perhaps, no other animal
          is more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to its maſter. The uſual way is, firſt to learn them
          to fetch as dogs are inſtructed; but, as they have not the ſame docility,
          ſo it requires more art and experience to teach them. It is uſually
          performed by accuſtoming them to take a truſs ſtuffed with wool, of the
          ſhape of a fiſh, and made of leather, in their mouths, and to drop it at
          the word of command; to run after it when thrown forward, and to bring it to
          their maſter. From this they proceed to real fiſh, which are thrown dead
          into the water, and which they are taught to fetch from thence. From the dead
          they proceed to the live, until at laſt the animal is perfectly inſtructed
          in the whole art of fiſhing. An otter thus taught is a very valuable animal,
          and will catch fiſh enough to ſuſtain not only itſelf but a whole
          family. I have ſeen one of theſe go to a gentleman's pond at the word of
          command, drive up the fiſh into a corner, and, ſeizing up the largeſt of
          the whole, bringing it off, in its mouth, to its maſter.</p>
            <p>Otters are to be met with in moſt parts of the world, and rather

            remote parts of America, we learn how far inſtinct can be aided by imitation.
            We from thence perceive to what a degree animals, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out language or
            reaſon, can concur for their mutual advantage, and attain by numbers thoſe
            advantages which each, in a ſtate of ſolitude, ſeems unfitted to
            poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>If we examine the beaver merely as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, and unconnected
            with others of its kind, we ſhall find many other quadrupedes to exceed it in
            cunning, and almoſt all in the powers of annoyance and defence. The beaver,
            when taken from its fellows, and kept in a ſtate of ſolitude or domeſtic
            tameneſs, appears to be a mild gentle creature, familiar enough, but
            ſomewhat dull, and even melancholly; without any violent paſſions or
            vehement appetites, moving but ſeldom, making no efforts to attain any good,
            except in gnawing the wall of its priſon, in order to regain its freedom; yet
            this, however, without anger or precipitation, but calm and indifferent to all
            about, without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment or antipathies, neither ſeeking to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend nor
            deſiring to pleaſe. It appears inferior to the dog in thoſe qualities
            which render ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of ſervice to man; it ſeems made neither to ſerve,
            to command, or to have connections <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0823900104:214"/> with any other ſet
            of beings, and is only adapted for living among its kind. Its talents are
            en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely repreſſed in ſolitude, and are only brought out by ſociety.
            When alone, it has but little induſtry, few tricks, and without cunning
            ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to guard it againſt the moſt obvious and bungling ſnares
            laid for it by the hunter. Far from attacking any other animal, it is ſcarce
            poſſeſſed of the arts of defence. Preferring flight to combat, like all
            wild animals, it only reſiſts when driven to an extremity, and fights only
            then when its ſpeed can no longer avail.</p>
               <p>But this animal is rather more remarkable for the ſingularity of
            its conformation than any intellectual ſuperiorities it may be ſuppoſed,
            in a ſtate of ſolitude, to poſſeſs. The beaver is the only creature
            among quadrupedes that has a flat broad tail, covered with ſcales, which
            ſerves as a rudder to direct its motions in the water. Is is the ſole
            quadrupede that has mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes between the toes on the hind feet only, and none
            on the fore feet, which ſupply the place of hands, as in the ſquirrel. In
            ſhort, it is the only animal that in its fore parts entirely reſembles a
            quadrupede, and in its hinder parts ſeems to approach the nature of fiſhes,
            by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſcaly tail. In other reſpects, it is about two feet long and
            near one foot high; it is <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0823900104:215"/> ſomewhat ſhaped like a
            rat, except the tail, which, as has been obſerved, is flat and ſcaly,
            ſomewhat reſembling a neat's tongue at the point. Its colour is of a light
            brown; the hair of two ſorts; the one longer and coarſer; the other,
            ſoft, fine, ſhort, and ſilky. The teeth are like thoſe of a rat or a
            ſquirrel, but longer and ſtronger, and admirably adapted to cutting timber
            or ſtripping bark, to which purpoſes they are conſtantly applied. One
            ſingularity more may be mentioned in its conformation; which is, that, like
            birds, it has but one and the ſame vent for the emiſſion of its
            excrements and its urine; a ſtrange peculiarity, but which, anatomiſts
            leave us no room to doubt of.</p>
               <p>The beavers begin to aſſemble about the months of June and
            July, to form a ſociety that is to continue for the greateſt part of the
            year. They arrive in numbers from every ſide, and generally form a company of
            above two hundred. The place of meeting is commonly the place where they ſix
            their abode, and this is always by the ſide of ſome lake or river. If it be
            a lake in which the waters are always upon a level, they diſpenſe with
            building a dam; but if it be a running ſtream, which is ſubject to floods
            and falls, they then ſet about building a dam, or pier, that croſſes the
            river, ſo that it <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0823900104:216"/> forms a dead water in that part
            which lies above and below. This dam, or pier, is often four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore or an
            hundred feet long, and ten or twelve feet thick at the baſe. If we compare
            the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the work with the powers of the architect, it will appear
            enormous; but the ſolidity with which it is built is ſtill more
            aſtoniſhing than its ſize. The part of the river over which this dam is
            uſually built, is where it is moſt ſhallow, and where ſome great tree
            is found growing by the ſide of the ſtream. This they pitch upon as proper
            for making the principal part in their building; and, although it is often
            thicker than a man's body, they inſtantly ſet about cutting it down. For
            this operation they have no other inſtrument but their teeth, which ſoon
            lay it level, and that alſo on the ſide they wiſh it to fall, which is
            always acroſs the ſtream. They then fall about cutting off the top
            branches, to make it lie cloſe and even, and ſerve as the principal beam of
            their fabric<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>This dike, or cauſey, is ſometimes ten, and ſometimes twelve
            feet thick at the foundation. It deſcends in a declivity or ſlope, on that
            ſide next the water, which gravitates upon the work in proportion to the
            height, and preſſes it with a prodigious force towards the earth. The 
            <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0823900104:217"/> oppoſite ſide is erected perpendicular, like our
            walls; and that declivity, which, at the bottom, or baſis, is about twelve
            feet broad, diminiſhes towards the top, where it is no more than two feet
            broad, or thereabouts. The materials whereof this mole conſiſts, are wood
            and clay. The beavers cut, with ſuprizing eaſe, large pieces of wood,
            ſome as thick as one's arm or one's thigh, and about four, five or ſix feet
            in length, or ſometimes more, according as the ſlope aſcends. They drive
            one end of theſe ſtakes into the ground, at a ſmall diſtance one from
            the other, intermingling a few with them that are ſmaller and more pliant. As
            the water, however, would find a paſſage through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals or ſpaces
            between them, and leave the reſervoir dry, they have recourſe to a clay,
            which they know where to find, and with which they ſtop up all the cavities
            both within and without, ſo that the water is duly confined. They continue to
            raiſe the dike in proportion to the elevation of the water and the plenty
            which they have of it. They are conſcious like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the conveyance of
            their materials by land would not be ſo eaſily accompliſhed as by water;
            and therefore they take the advantage of its increaſe, and ſwim with their
            mortar on their tails, and their ſtakes between their teeth, to the places
            where there is moſt occaſion for <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0823900104:218"/> them. If their
            works are, either by the force of the water or the feet of the huntſmen, who
            run over them, in the leaſt damnified, the breach is inſtantly made up;
            every nook and corner of the habitation is reviewed, and, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
            diligence and application, perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired. But when they find the
            huntſmen viſit them too often, they work only in the night-time, or elſe
            abandon their works entirely, and ſeek out for ſome ſafer
            ſituation.</p>
               <p>The dike, or mole, being thus completed, their next care is to
            erect their ſeveral apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are either round or oval, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
            into three ſtories, one raiſed above the other: the firſt below the level
            of the cauſey, which is for the moſt part full of water; the other two
            above it. This little fabrick is built in a very firm and ſubſtantial
            manner, on the edge of their reſervoir, and always in ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions or
            apartments as above-mentioned; that in caſe of the water's increaſe, they
            may move up a ſtory higher, and be no ways incommoded. If they find any
            little iſland contiguous to their reſervoir, they fix their manſion
            there, which is then more ſolid, and not ſo frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the
            overflowing of the water, in which they are not able to continue for any length
            of time. In caſe they cannot pitch upon ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious 
            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0823900104:219"/> a ſituation, they drive piles into the earth, in order
            to fence and fortify their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation againſt the wind as well as the water.
            They make two apertures, at the bottom, to the ſtream; one is a paſſage
            to their bagnio, which they always keep neat and clean; the other leads to that
            part of the building where every thing is conveyed, that will either ſoil or
            damage their upper apartments. They have a third opening or door-way, much
            higher, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived for the prevention of their being ſhut up and confined,
            when the froſt and ſnow has cloſed the apertures of the lower floors.
            Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they build their houſes altogether upon dry land; but then they
            ſink trenches five or ſix feet deep, in order to deſcend into the water
            when they ſee convenient. They make uſe of the ſame materials; and are
            equally induſtrious in the erection of their lodges, as their dikes. Their
            walls are perpendicular, and about two feet thick. As their teeth are more
            ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than ſaws, they cut off all the wood that projects beyond the
            wall. After this, when they have mixed up ſome clay and dry graſs together,
            they work it into a kind of mortar, with which, by the help of their tails,
            they plaiſter all their works, both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>

            for the reception of eight or ten beavers. In caſe it riſes in an oval
            figure, it is for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality above twelve feet long, and eight or ten feet
            broad. If the number of inhabitants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to fifteen, twenty, or thirty,
            the edifice is enlarged in proportion. I have been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed, that
            four hundred beavers have been diſcovered to reſide in one large
            manſion-houſe, divided into a vaſt number of apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that had a free
            communication one with another.</p>
               <p>All theſe works, more eſpecially in the northern parts, are
            finiſhed in Auguſt, or Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember at fartheſt; at which time they begin
            to lay in their ſtores. During the ſummer, they are perfect epicures; and
            regale themſelves every day on the choiceſt fruits and plants the country
            affords. Their proviſions, indeed, in the winter ſeaſon, principally
            conſiſt of the wood of the birch, the plane, and ſome few other trees,
            which they ſteep in water, from time to time, in ſuch quantities as are
            proportioned to the number of inhabitants. They cut down branches from three to
            ten feet in length. Thoſe of the largeſt dimenſions are conveyed to their
            magazines by a whole body of beavers; but the ſmalleſt by one only: each of
            them, <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0823900104:221"/> however, takes a different way, and has his proper
            walk aſſigned him, in order that no one labourer ſhould interrupt another
            in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of his work. Their wood-yards are larger or ſmaller, in
            proportion to the number in family: and, according to the obſervation of
            ſome curious naturaliſts, the uſual ſtock of timber, for the
            accommodation of ten beavers, conſiſts of about thirty feet in a ſquare
            ſurface, and ten in depth. Theſe logs are not thrown up in one continual
            pile, but laid one acroſs the other, with intervals, or ſmall ſpaces
            be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, in order to take out, with the greater facility, but juſt
            ſuch a quantity as they ſhall want for their immediate conſumption, and
            thoſe parcels only, which lie at the bottom in the water, and have been duly
            ſteeped. This timber is cut again into ſmall particles, and conveyed to one
            of their largeſt lodges, where the whole family meet, to conſume their
            reſpective dividends, which are made impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, in even and equal
            portions. Sometimes they traverſe the woods, and regale their young with a
            more novel and elegant entertainment.</p>
               <p>Such as are uſed to hunt theſe animals, know perfectly well,
            that green wood is much more acceptable to them, than that which is old and
            dry; for which reaſon they plant a conſiderable <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0823900104:222"/>
            quantity of it round their lodgments; and as they come out to partake of it,
            they either catch them in ſnares, or take them by ſurprize. In the winter,
            when the froſts are very ſevere, they ſometimes break a large hole in the
            ice; and when the beavers reſort thither for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of a little freſh
            air, they either kill them with their hatchets, or cover the opening with a
            large ſubſtantial net. After this, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine and ſubvert the whole
            fabrick: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the beavers, in hopes to make their eſcape in their
            uſual way, fly with the utmoſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation to the water; and plunging
            into the aperture, fall directly into the net, and are inevitably taken.</p>

               <head>THE SEAL.</head>
               <p>EVERY ſtep we proceed in the deſcription of amphibious
            quadrupedes, we make nearer advances to the tribe of fiſhes. We firſt
            ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the otter with its feet webbed, and formed for an aquatic life; we
            next ſaw the beaver with the hinder parts covered with ſcales, reſembling
            thoſe of fiſhes; and we now come to a claſs of animals in which the
            ſhape and habitude of fiſhes ſtill more apparently prevails, and whoſe
            in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal conformation attaches them very cloſely <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0823900104:223"/> to
            the water. The Seal, in general, reſembles a quadrupede in ſome reſpects,
            and a fiſh in others. The head is round, like that of a man; the noſe
            broad, like that of the otter; the teeth like thoſe of a dog; the eyes large
            and ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; no external ears, but holes that ſerve for that purpoſe;
            the neck is well proportioned, and of a moderate length; but the body
            thickeſt where the neck is joined to it. From thence the animal tapers down
            to the tail, growing all the way ſmaller, like a fiſh. The whole body is
            covered with a thick briſtly ſhining hair, which looks as if it were
            entirely rubbed over with oil; and thus far the quadrupede prevails over the
            aquatic. But it is in the feet that this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal greatly differs from all the
            reſt of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupede kind; for, though furniſhed with the ſame number
            of bones with other quadrupedes, yet they are ſo ſtuck on the body, and
            ſo covered with a membrane, that they more reſemble fins than feet; and
            might be taken for ſuch, did not the claws with which they are pointed ſhew
            their proper analogy. In the fore feet, or rather hands, all the arm and the
            cubit, are hid under the ſkin, and nothing appears but the hand from the
            wriſt downwards; ſo that if we imagine a child with its arms ſwathed
            down, and nothing appearing but its hands at each ſide of the body, 
            <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0823900104:224"/> towards the breaſt, we may have ſome idea of the
            formation of this animal in that part. Theſe hands are covered in a thick
            ſkin, which ſerves, like a fin, for ſwimming; and are diſtinguiſhed
            by five claws, which are long, black, and pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As to the hind feet, they
            are ſtretched out on each ſide of the ſhort tail, covered with a hairy
            ſkin like the former, and both together almoſt joining at the tail; the
            whole looks like the broad flat tail of a fiſh; and, were it not for five
            claws which appear, might be conſidered as ſuch. The dimenſions of this
            animal are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, being found from four feet long to nine. They differ
            alſo in their colours; ſome being black, others ſpotted, ſome white,
            and many more yellow. It would, therefore, be almoſt endleſs to mention the
            varieties of this animal. Buffon deſcribes three; and Krantz mentions five,
            all different from thoſe deſcribed by the other. I might, were I fond of
            ſuch honours, claim the merit of being a firſt deſcriber myſelf; but,
            in fact, the varieties in this animal are ſo many, that, were they all
            deſcribed, the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue would be as extenſive as it would be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
            and unentertaining. It is ſufficient to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that they agree in the
            general external characters already mentioned, and internally in two or three
            more, which are ſo remarkable as to deſerve peculiar attention.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0823900104:225"/>It has been often remarked that all animals
            are ſagacious in proportion to the ſize of their brain. It has, in
            ſupport of this opinion, been alledged that man, with reſpect to his bulk,
            has of all others the largeſt. In purſuance of this aſſumption, ſome
            erroneous ſpeculations have been formed. But, were the ſize of the brain to
            determine the quantity of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the ſeal would of all other
            animals be the moſt ſagacious; for it has, in proportion, the largeſt
            brain of any, even man himſelf not excepted. However, this animal is
            poſſeſſed of but very few advantages over other quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes; and the
            ſize of its brain furniſhes it with few powers that contribute to its
            wiſdom or its preſervation.</p>
               <p>This animal differs alſo in the formation of its tongue from all
            other quadrupedes. It is forked or ſlit at the end like that of ſerpents;
            but for what purpoſes it is thus ſingularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived we are at a loſs
            to know. We are much better informed with reſpect to a third ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
            in its conformation, which is, that the <hi>foramen ovale</hi> in the heart is
            open. Thoſe who are in the leaſt acquainted with anatomy know, that the
            veins uniting bring their blood to the heart, which ſends it into the lungs,
            and from thence it returns to the heart again to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed 
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0823900104:226"/> through the whole body. Animals, however, before they
            are born, make no uſe of their lungs; and therefore their blood, without
            entering their lungs, takes a ſhorter paſſage through the very partition
            of the heart, from one of its chambers to the other, thus paſſing from the
            veins directly into thoſe veſſels that drive it through the whole frame.
            But the moment the animal is brought forth, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through the
            partition, which paſſage is called the <hi>foramen ovale,</hi> cloſes up
            and continues cloſed for ever; for the blood then takes its longeſt
            courſe through the lungs to return to the other chamber of the heart again.
            Now the ſeal's heart reſembles that of an infant in the womb, for the
            <hi>foramen ovale</hi> never cloſes; and, although the blood of this animal
            com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly circulates through the lungs, yet it can circulate without their
            aſſiſtance, as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved above, by a ſhorter way<note n="*" place="bottom">I have followed the uſual obſervations of naturaliſts
              with reſpect to the foramen ovale in this animal: I have many reaſons,
              however, to incline me to think that the foramen is not entirely open. But this
              is not the place for a critical enquiry of this kind.</note>. From hence,
            therefore, we ſee the manner in which this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is adapted for continuing
            under water; for, being under no immediate neceſſity of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 
            <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0823900104:227"/> the vital motions are ſtill carried on while it
            continues at the bottom; ſo that it can purſue its prey in that element,
            and yet enjoy all the delights and advantages of ours.</p>
               <p>The water is the ſeal's uſual habitation, and whatever fiſh
            it can catch its food. Though not equal in inſtinct and cunning to ſome
            ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial animals, it is greatly ſuperior to the mute tenants of that
            element in which it chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. Although it can continue for ſeveral
            minutes under water, yet it is not able, like fiſhes, to remain there for any
            length of time; and a ſeal may be drowned like any other ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial
            animal. Thus it ſeems ſuperior in ſome reſpects to the inhabitants of
            both elements, and inferior in many more. Although furniſhed with legs, it is
            in ſome meaſure deprived of all the advantages of them<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon.</bibl>
                  </note>. They are ſhut up within its body,
            while nothing appear but the extremities of them, and theſe furniſhed with
            very little motion, but to ſerve them as fins in the water. The hind feet,
            indeed, being turned backwards, are entirely uſeleſs upon land; ſo that
            when the animal is obliged to move, it drags itſelf forward like a reptile,
            and with an effort more painful. For this purpoſe it is obliged to uſe its
            fore feet, which, though very <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0823900104:228"/> ſhort, ſerve to give
            it ſuch a degree of ſwiftneſs that a man cannot readily overtake it; and
            it runs towards the ſea. As it is thus aukwardly formed for going upon land,
            it is ſeldom found at any diſtance from the ſea-ſhore, but continues to
            baſk upon the rocks; and when diſturbed always plunges down at once to the
            bottom.</p>
               <p>The ſeal is a ſocial animal, and wherever it frequents numbers
            are generally ſeen together. They are found in every climate, but in the
            north and icy ſeas they are particularly nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. It is on thoſe
            ſhores, which are leſs inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited than ours, and where the fiſh reſort
            in greater abundance, that they are ſeen by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, like flocks of
            ſheep, baſking on the rocks, and ſuckling their young. There they keep
            watch like other gregarious animals; and, if an enemy appear, inſtantly
            plunge altogether into the water. In fine weather they more uſually employ
            their time in fiſhing; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally come on ſhore in tempeſts and
            ſtorms. The ſeal ſeems the only animal that takes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in theſe
            tremendous conflicts of nature. In the midſt of thunders and torrents, when
            every other creature takes refuge from the fury of the elements, the ſeals
            are ſeen by thouſands ſporting along the ſhore, and delighted with the
            univerſal diſorder. This, however, may ariſe <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0823900104:229"/> from
            the ſea being at that time too turbulent for them to reſide in; and they
            may then par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly come upon land when unable to reſiſt the ſhock of
            their more uſual element.</p>
               <p>As ſeals are gregarious, ſo are they alſo ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of
            paſſage, and perhaps the only quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes that migrate from one part of
            the world to another. The generality of quadrupedes are contented with their
            native plains and foreſts, and ſeldom ſtray except when neceſſity or
            fear impels them. But ſeals change their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and are ſeen in
            vaſt multitudes directing their courſe from one continent to another<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. On the northern
            coaſts of Greenland they are ſeen to retire in July, and to return again in
            September. This time it is ſuppoſed they go in purſuit of food. But they
            make a ſecond departure in March to caſt their young, and return in the
            beginning of June, young and all, in a great body together, obſerving in
            their route a certain fixed time and track, like birds of paſſage. When
            they go upon this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are ſeen in great droves, for many days
            together, making towards the north, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that part of the ſea moſt free
            from ice, and going ſtill forward into thoſe ſeas where man cannot
            follow. In what manner they return, <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0823900104:230"/> or by what
            paſſages, is utterly unknown; it is only obſerved, that when they leave
            the coaſts to go upon this expedition they are all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fat, but on
            their return they come home exceſſively lean.</p>
               <p>The females in our climate bring forth in winter, and rear their
            young upon ſome ſand-bank, rock, or deſolate iſland, at ſome
            diſtance from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. When they ſuckle their young they ſit up on
            their hinder legs, while theſe, which are at firſt white with woolly hair,
            cling to the tates, of which there are four in number, near the navel<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <q>Coeunt in Littore reſupinata femina.

                  </note>. In this manner the young
            continue in the place where they are brought forth, for twelve or fifteen days;
            after which the dam brings them down to the water, and accuſtoms them to
            ſwim and get their food by their own induſtry. As each litter never exceeds
            above three or four, ſo the animal's cares are not much divided, and the
            education of her little ones is ſoon compleated. In fact, the young are
            particularly docile; they underſtand the mother's voice among the numerous
            bleatings of the reſt of the old ones; they mutually aſſiſt each other
            in danger, and are perfectly obedient to her call. Thus early accuſtomed to
            ſubjection, they continue to live in ſociety, <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0823900104:231"/> hunt
            and herd together, and have a variety of tones by which they encourage to
            purſue or warn each other of danger. Some compare their voices to the
            bleating of a flock of ſheep, interrupted now and then by the barking of
            angry dogs, and ſometimes the ſhriller notes of a cat<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. All along the ſhore, each
            has its own peculiar rock, of which it takes poſſeſſion, and where it
            ſleeps when fatigued with fiſhing, uninterrupted by any of the reſt. The
            only ſeaſon when their ſocial ſpirit ſeems to forſake them, is that
            when they feel the influences of natural deſire. They then fight moſt
            deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; and the male that is victorious, keeps all the females to
            himſelf. Their combats on theſe occaſions are managed with great
            obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, and yet great juſtice: two are never ſeen to fall upon one
            together; but each has its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, and all fight an equal battle, till
            one alone becomes victorious.</p>
               <p>We are not certainly informed how long the females continue
            pregnant; but if we may judge from the time which intervenes between their
            departure from the Greenland coaſts and their return, they cannot go above
            ſeven or eight months at the fartheſt. How long this animal lives is alſo
            unknown: a gentleman whom I <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0823900104:232"/> knew in Ireland, kept two of
            them, which he had taken very young, in his houſe for ten years; and they
            appeared to have the marks of age at the time I ſaw them, for they were grown
            grey about the muzzle; and it is very probable they did not live many years
            longer. In their natural ſtate the old ones are ſeen very fat and torpid,
            ſeparated from the reſt, and, as it ſhould ſeem, incapable of
            procreation.</p>
               <p>As their chief food is fiſh, ſo they are very expert at

            they are very ſwift in deep waters, dive with great rapidity, and, while the
            ſpectator eyes the ſpot at which they diſappear, they are ſeen to
            emerge at above an hundred yards diſtance. The weaker fiſhes, therefore,
            have no other means to eſcape their tyranny, but by darting into the
            ſhallows. The ſeal has been ſeen to purſue a mullet, which is a ſwift
            ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and to turn it to and fro, in deep water, as an hound does an hare
            on land. The mullet has been ſeen trying every art of evaſion; and 
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0823900104:233"/> at laſt ſwimming into ſhallow water, in hopes of
            eſcaping. There, however, the ſeal followed; ſo that the little animal
            had no other way left to eſcape, but to throw itſelf on one ſide, by
            which means it darted into ſhoaler water than it could have ſwam in with
            the belly undermoſt; and thus at laſt it got free.</p>
               <p>As they are thus the tyrants of the element in which they chiefly
            reſide, ſo they are not very fearful even upon land, except on thoſe
            ſhores which are thickly inhabited, and from whence they have been frequently
            purſued. Along the deſert coaſts where they are ſeldom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by
            man, they ſeem to be very bold and courageous; if attacked with ſtones,
            like dogs, they bite ſuch as are thrown againſt them; if encountered more
            cloſely, they make a deſperate reſiſtance, and, while they have any
            life, attempt to annoy their enemy. Some have been known, even while they were
            ſkinning, to turn round and ſeize their butchers; but they are generally
            diſpatched by a ſtunning blow on the noſe. They uſually ſleep
            ſoundly where not frequently diſturbed; and that is the time, when the
            hunters ſurprize them. The Europeans who go into the Greenland ſeas upon
            the whale-fiſhery, ſurround them with nets, and knock them on the head; but
            the <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0823900104:234"/> Greenlanders, wild are unprovided with ſo
            ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive an apparatus, deſtroy them in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manner. One of
            theſe little men paddles away in his boat, and when he ſees a ſeal
            aſleep on the ſide of a rock, darts his lance, and that with ſuch
            unerring aim, that it never fails to bury its point in the animal's ſide. The
            ſeal, feeling itſelf wounded, inſtantly plunges from the top of the rock,
            lance and all, into the ſea, and dives to the bottom; but the lance has a
            bladder tied to one end, which keeps buoyant, and reſiſts the animal's
            deſcent; ſo that every time the ſeal riſes to the top of the water, the
            Greenlander ſtrikes it with his oar, until he at laſt diſpatches it. But,
            in our climate, the ſeals are much more wary, and ſeldom ſuffer the
            hunter to come near them. They are often ſeen upon the rocks of the Corniſh
            coaſt, baſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſun, or upon the inacceſſible cliffs, left dry
            by the tide. There they continue, extremely watchful, and never ſleep long
            with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moving; ſeldom longer than a minute; for then they raiſe their
            heads, and if they ſee no danger, they lie down again, raiſing and
            re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining their heads alternately, at intervals of about a minute each. The
            only method, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that can be taken, is to ſhoot them: if they chance
            to eſcape, they haſten towards the <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0823900104:235"/> deep, flinging
            ſtones and dirt behind them as they ſcramble along, and at the ſame time
            expreſſing their pain or their fears, by the moſt diſtreſsful cry; if
            they happen to be overtaken, they make a vigorous reſiſtance with their
            feet and teeth, till they are killed.</p>
               <p>The ſeal is taken for the ſake of its ſkin, and for the oil
            its fat yields. The former ſells for about four ſhillings; and, when
            dreſſed, is very uſeful in covering trunks, making waiſt-coats,
            ſhot-pouches, and ſeveral other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies. The fleſh of this animal
            formerly found place at the tables of the great. At a feaſt provided by
            Archbiſhop Nevell, for Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Fourth, there were twelve ſeals and
            porpoiſes provided, among other extraordinary rarities.</p>
               <p>As a variety of this animal, we may mention the Sea Lion,
            deſcribed in Anſon's Voyages. This is much larger than any of the former;
            being from eleven to eighteen feet long. It is ſo fat that, when the ſkin
            is taken off, the blub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber lies a foot thick all round the body. It ſeems to
            differ from the ordinary ſeal, not only in its ſize, but alſo in its
            food; for it is often ſeen to graze along the ſhore, and to feed upon the
            long graſs that grows up along the edges of brooks. Its cry is very various,
            ſometimes <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0823900104:237"/> reſembling the neighing of an horſe, and
            ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the grunting of the hog. It may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as the largeſt of
            the ſeal family.</p>

                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0823900104:237"/>THE Morſe is an animal of the ſeal kind;
            but differing from the reſt, in a very particular formation of the teeth,
            having two large tuſks growing from the upper jaw, ſhaped like thoſe of
            an elephant, but directed downwards; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, in the elephant, they grow
            upright, like horns; it alſo wants the cutting-teeth, both above and below:
            as to the reſt, it pretty much reſembles a ſeal, except that it is much
            larger, being from twelve to ſixteen feet long. The morſes are alſo
            generally ſeen to frequent the ſame places that ſeals are known to
            reſide in; they have the ſame habitudes, the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and the
            ſame imperfections. There are, however, fewer varieties of the morſe than
            the ſeal; and they are rarely found, except in the frozen regions near the
            pole. They were formerly more numerous than at preſent; and the ſavage
            natives of the coaſts of Greenland deſtroyed them in much greater
            quantities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe ſeas were viſited by European ſhips upon the

            is, that the Greenlanders, who once had plenty, are now obliged to toil more
            aſſiduouſly for ſubſiſtence; and as the quantity of their
            proviſions decreaſe, for they live moſtly upon ſeals, the numbers of
            that poor people are every day diminiſhing. As to the teeth, they are
            generally from two to three feet long; and the ivory is much more eſteemed
            than that of the elephant, being whiter and harder. The fiſhers have been
            known formerly to kill three or four hundred at once; and along thoſe
            ſhores where they chiefly frequented, their bones are ſtill ſeen lying in
            prodigious quantities. In this manner a ſupply of proviſions, which would
            have ſupported the Greenland nation for ages, has been, in a few years,
            ſacrificed to thoſe who did not uſe them, but who ſought them for the

               <head>THE MANATI.</head>
               <p>WE come, in the laſt place, to an animal that terminates the
            boundary between quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes and fiſhes. Inſtead of a creature preying
            among the deeps, and retiring upon land for <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0823900104:241"/> repoſe or
            refreſhment, we have here an animal that never leaves the water, and is
            enabled to live only there. It cannot be called a quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede, as it has but
            two legs only; nor can it be called a fiſh, as it is covered with hair. In
            ſhort, it forms the link that unites thoſe two great tribes to each other;
            and may be indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately called the laſt of beaſts, or the firſt of
            fiſhes.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen the ſeal approaching nearly to the aquatic
            tribes, by having its hind legs thrown back on each ſide of the tail, and
            form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething, that reſembled the tail of a fiſh; but upon examining
            the ſkeleton of that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, its title to the rank of a quadrupede was
            obſerved plainly to appear, having all the bones of the hinder legs and feet
            as complete as any other animal whatſoever.</p>
               <p>But we are now come to a creature that not only wants the external
            appearance of hinder legs, but, when examined internally, will be found to want
            them altogether. The Manati is ſomewhat ſhaped in the head and the body
            like the ſeal; it has alſo the fore legs or hands pretty much in the ſame
            manner, ſhort and webbed, but with four claws only: theſe alſo are
            ſhorter in proportion than in the former animal, and placed nearer the head;
            ſo that <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0823900104:242"/> they can ſcarcely aſſiſt its motions
            upon land. But it is in the hinder parts that it chiefly differs from all
            others of the ſeal kind; for the tail is perfectly that of a fiſh, being
            ſpread out broad like a fan, and wanting even the veſtiges of thoſe bones
            which make the legs and feet in others of its kind. The largeſt of theſe
            are about twenty-ſix feet in length; the ſkin is blackiſh, very tough and
            hard; when cut, as black as ebony; and there are a few hairs ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, like
            briſtles, of about an inch long. The eyes are very ſmall, in proportion to
            the animal's head; and the ear-holes, for it has no external ears, are ſo
            narrow as ſcarce to admit a pin's head. The tongue is ſo ſhort, that
            ſome have pretended it has none at all; and the teeth are compoſed only of
            two ſolid white bones, running the whole length of both jaws, and formed
            merely for chewing, and not tearing its vegetable food. The female has
            breaſts placed forward, like thoſe of a woman; and ſhe brings forth but
            one at a time: this ſhe holds with her paws to her boſom; there it
            ſticks, and accompanies her wherever ſhe goes.</p>
               <p>This animal can ſcarcely be called amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious, as it never
            entirely leaves the water, only advancing the head out of the ſtream, to 
            <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0823900104:243"/> reach the graſs on the river ſides. Its food is
            entirely upon vegetables; and, therefore, it is never found far in the open
            ſea, but chiefly in the large rivers of South America; and often above two
            thouſand miles from the ocean. It is alſo found in the ſeas near
            Kamſkatka, and feeds upon the weeds that grow near the ſhore. There are
            likewiſe level greens at the bottom of ſome of the Indian bays, and there
            the manatees are harmleſsly ſeen grazing among turtles and other
            cruſtaceous fiſhes, neither giving nor fearing any diſturbance. Theſe
            animals, when unmoleſted, keep together in large companies, and ſurround
            their young ones<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Acta
                Petripolitana.</bibl>
                  </note>. They bring forth moſt commonly in autumn; and
            it is ſuppoſed they go with young eighteen months, for the time of
            generation is in ſpring.</p>
               <p>The manati has no voice nor cry, for the only noiſe it makes, is
            by fetching its breath. Its internal parts ſomewhat reſemble thoſe of an
            horſe; its inteſtines being longer, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, than thoſe of any
            other creature, the horſe only excepted.</p>
               <p>The fat of the manati, which lies under the ſkin, when expoſed
            to the ſun, has a fine ſmell and taſte, and far exceeds the fat of any
            ſea <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0823900104:244"/> animal; it has this peculiar property, that the
            heat of the ſun will not ſpoil it, nor make it grow rancid; its taſte is
            like the oil of ſweet almonds; and it will ſerve very well, in all caſes,
            inſtead of butter: any quantity may be taken inwardly with ſafety, for it
            has no other effect than keeping the body open. The fat of the tail is of an
            harder conſiſtence; and, when boiled, is more delicate than the former. The
            lean is like beef, but more red; and may be kept a long while, in the hotteſt
            days, without tainting. It takes up a long time in boiling; and, when done,
            eats like beef. The fat of the young one is like pork; the lean is like veal;
            and, upon the whole, it is very probable that this animal's fleſh ſomewhat
            reſembles that of turtle; ſince they are fed in the ſame element, and
            upon the very ſame food. The turtle is a delicacy well known among us: our
            luxuries are not as yet ſufficiently heightened to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the manati;
            which, if it could be brought over, might ſingly ſuffice for a whole
            corporation.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII. Of Animals of the Monkey Kind.</head>
            <p>QUADRUPEDES may be conſidered as a numerous groupe, terminated on
          every ſide by ſome that but in part deſerve the name. On one quarter we
          ſee a tribe covered with quills, or furniſhed with wings, that lift them
          among the inhabitants of air; on another, we behold a diverſity cloathed with
          ſcales and ſhells, to rank with inſects; and ſtill, on a third, we
          ſee them deſcending into the waters, to live among the mute tenants of that
          element. We now come to a numerous tribe, that, leaving the brute creation,
          ſeem to make approaches even to humanity; that bear an aukward reſemblance
          of the human form, and diſcover ſome faint efforts at intellectual
          ſagacity.</p>
            <p>Animals of the monkey claſs are furniſhed with hands inſtead
          of paws; their ears, eyes, eye-lids, lips, and breaſts, are like thoſe of
          man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; their internal conformation alſo bears ſome diſtant likeneſs;
          and the whole offers a picture that may well mortify the pride of ſuch as
          make their perſons alone the principal object of their admiration.</p>
            <p>Theſe approaches, however, are gradual; and <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0823900104:246"/>
          ſome bear the marks of this our boaſted form, more ſtrongly than
          others.</p>
            <p>In the Ape kind we ſee the whole external machine ſtrongly
          impreſſed with the human like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and capable of the ſame exertions:
          theſe walk upright, want a tail, have fleſhy poſteriors, have calves to
          their legs, and feet nearly like ours.</p>
            <p>In the Baboon kind we perceive a more diſtant approach to the
          human form; the quadrupede mixing in every part of the animal's figure: theſe
          generally go upon all fours; but ſome, when upright, are as tall as a man;
          they have ſhort tails, long ſnouts, and are poſſeſſed of brutal
          fierceneſs.</p>
            <p>The Monkey kind are removed a ſtep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: theſe are much
          leſs than the former, with tails as long, or longer than their bodies, and
          flattiſh faces.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the Maki and Opaſſum kind, ſeem to loſe all
          reſemblance of the human figure, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in having hands; their noſes are
          length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened out, like thoſe of quadrupedes, and every part of their bodies
          totally different from the human; however, as they graſp their food, or other
          objects, with one hand, which quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes cannot do, this ſingle
          ſimilitude gives them an air of ſagacity, to which they have ſcarce any
          other pretenſions.</p>
            <p>From this ſlight ſurvey it may be eaſily ſeen 
          <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0823900104:247"/> that one general deſcription will not ſerve for
          animals ſo very different from each other: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, it would be
          fatiguing to the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as their varieties are ſo numerous, and
          their differences ſo ſmall, to go through a particular deſcription of
          each. In this caſe it will be beſt to give an hiſtory of the foremoſt
          in each claſs; at the ſame time marking the diſtinctions in every
          ſpecies. By this we ſhall avoid a tedious repetition of ſimilar
          characters, and conſider the manners and the oddities of this phantaſtic
          tribe in general points of view; where we ſhall perceive how nearly they
          ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the human figure, and how little they benefit by the
          approximation.</p>
            <p>The foremoſt of the Ape kind is the Ourang Outang, or Wild Man of
          the Woods. This name ſeems to have been given to various ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, agreeing
          in one common character of walking upright, but coming from different
          countries, and of very different proportions and powers. The Troglodyte of
          Bontius, the Drill of Purchas, and the Pygmy of Tyſon, have all received this
          general name; and have been ranked, by ſome naturaliſts, under one general
          deſcription. If we read the accounts of many remote travellers, under this
          name we are preſented with a formidable animal, from <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0823900104:248"/>
          ſix to eight feet high; if we examine the books of ſuch as have deſcribed
          it nearer home, we find it a pigmy not above three. In this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity we
          muſt be content to blend their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deſcriptions into one general
          account; obſerving, at the ſame time, that we have no reaſon to doubt any
          of their relations, although we are puzzled which to follow.</p>
            <p>The Ouran Outang, which, of all other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, moſt nearly
          approaches to the human race, is ſeen of different ſizes, from three to
          ſeven feet high. In general, however, its ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is leſs than that of a
          man; but its ſtrength and agility much greater. Travellers who have ſeen
          various kinds of theſe animals in their native ſolitudes, give us
          ſurprizing relations of their force, their ſwiftneſs, their addreſs,
          and their ferocity. Naturaliſts who have obſerved their form and manners at
          home, have been as much ſtruck with their patient, pliant, imitative
          diſpoſitions; with their appearance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, ſo nearly human.
          Of the ſmalleſt ſort of theſe animals we have had ſeveral, at
          different times, brought into this country, all nearly alike; but that
          obſerved by Dr. Tyſon, is the beſt known, having been deſcribed with
          the greateſt exactneſs.</p>
            <p>The animal which was deſcribed by that <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0823900104:249"/>
          learned phyſician, was brought from Angola in Africa, where it had been taken
          in the internal parts of the country, in company with a female of the ſame
          kind, that died by the way. The body was covered with hair, which was of a coal
          black colour, more reſembling human hair than that of brutes. It bore a
          ſtill ſtronger ſimilitude in its different lengths; for in thoſe places
          where it is longeſt on the human ſpecies, it was alſo longeſt in this;
          as on the head, the upper lip, the chin, and the pubes. The face was like that
          of a man, the forehead larger, and the head round. The upper and lower jaw were
          not ſo prominent as in monkies; but flat, like thoſe of a man. The ears
          were like thoſe of a man in moſt reſpects; and the teeth had more
          reſemblance to the human, than thoſe of any other creature. The bending of
          the arms and legs were juſt the ſame as in a man; and, in ſhort, the
          animal, at firſt view, preſented a figure entirely human.</p>
            <p>In order to diſcover its differences, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to
          take a cloſer ſurvey; and then the imperfections of its form began to
          appear. The firſt obvious difference was in the flatneſs of the noſe; the
          next in the lowneſs of the forehead, and the wanting the prominence of the
          chin. The ears were proportionably too large; the <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0823900104:250"/> eyes
          too cloſe to each other; and the interval between the noſe and mouth too
          great. The body and limbs differed, in the thighs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too ſhort, and the
          arms too long; in the thumb being too little, and the palm of the hand too
          narrow. The feet alſo were rather more like hands than feet; and the animal,
          if we may judge from the figure, bent too much upon its haunches.</p>
            <p>When this creature was examined anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically, a ſurprizing
          ſimilitude was ſeen to prevail in its internal conformation. It differed
          from man in the number of its ribs, having thirteen; whereas, in man, there are
          but twelve. The vertebrae of the neck alſo were ſhorter, the bones of the
          pelvis narrower, the orbits of the eyes were deeper, the kidnies were round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
          the urinary and gall bladders were longer and ſmaller, and the ureters of a
          different figure. Such were the principal diſtinctions between the internal
          parts of this animal and thoſe of man; in almoſt every thing elſe they
          were entirely and exactly the ſame, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered an aſtoniſhing
          congruity. Indeed, many parts were ſo much alike in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that it
          might have excited wonder how they were productive of ſuch few advantages.
          The tongue, and all the organs of the voice, <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0823900104:251"/> were the
          ſame, and yet the animal was dumb; the brain was formed in the ſame manner
          with that of man, and yet the creature wanted rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: an evident proof (as
          Mr. Buffon finely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) that no diſpoſition of matter will give
          mind; and that the body, how nicely ſoever formed, is formed in vain, when
          there is not infuſed a ſoul to direct its operations.</p>
            <p>Having thus taken a comparative view of this creature with man, what
          follows may be neceſſary to compleat the general deſcription. This animal
          was very hairy all behind, from the head downwards; and the hair ſo thick,
          that it covered the ſkin almoſt from being ſeen: but in all parts before,
          the hair was much thinner, the ſkin every where appeared; and in ſome
          places it was almoſt bare. When it went on all fours, as it was ſometimes
          ſeen to do, it appeared all hairy; when it went erect, it appeared before
          leſs hairy, and more like a man. Its hair, which in this particular animal
          was black, much more reſembled that of men than the fur of brutes; for, in
          the latter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their long hair, there is uſually a finer and
          ſhorter intermixed; but in the ouran outang it was all of a kind; only about
          the pubes the hair was greyiſh, ſeemed longer, and ſomewhat different; as
          alſo on the upper lip and chin, <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0823900104:252"/> where it was
          greyiſh, like the hair of a beard. The face, hands, and ſoles of the feet,
          were without hair; and ſo was moſt part of the forehead: but down the
          ſides of the face the hair was thick, it being there about an inch and an
          half long, which exceeded that on any other part of the body. In the palms of
          its hands were remarkable thoſe lines which are uſually taken notice of in
          palmiſtry; and, at the tips of the fingers, thoſe ſpiral lines
          ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in man. The palms of the hands were as long as the ſoles of the
          feet; and the toes upon theſe were as long as the fingers; the middle toe was
          the longeſt of all, and the whole foot differed from the human. The hinder
          feet being thus formed as hands, the animal often uſed them as ſuch; and,
          on the contrary, now and then made uſe of its hands inſtead of feet. The
          breaſts appeared ſmall and ſhrivelled, but exactly like thoſe of a man:
          the navel alſo appeared very fair, and in exact diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, being
          neither harder nor more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent than what is uſually ſeen in children.
          Such is the deſcription of this extraordinary creature; to which little has
          been added by ſucceeding obſervers, except that the colour of the hair is
          often found to vary: in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Edwards it was of a reddiſh
          brown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0823900104:253"/>From a picture ſo like that of the human
          ſpecies, we are naturally led to expect a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding mind; and it is
          certain, that ſuch of theſe animals as have been ſhewn in Europe, have
          diſcovered a degree of imitation beyond what any quadrupede can arrive
          at.</p>
            <p>That of Tyſon was a gentle, fond, harmleis creature. In its
          paſſage to England, thoſe that it knew on ſhip-board it would embrace
          with the greateſt tenderneſs, opening their boſoms, and claſping its
          hands about them. Monkies of a lower ſpecies it held in utter averſion; it
          would always avoid the place where they were kept in the ſame veſſel; and
          ſeemed to conſider itſelf as a creature of higher extraction. After it
          was taken, and a little uſed to wear cloaths, it grew very fond of them; a
          part it would put on without any help, and the reſt it would carry in its
          hands to ſome of the company, for their aſſiſtance. It would lie in a
          bed, place its head on the pillow, and pull the cloaths up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as a man
          would do.</p>
            <p>That which was ſeen by Edwards, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Buffon,
          ſhewed even a ſuperior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſagacity. It walked, like all of its
          kind, upon two legs, even though it carried burthens. Its air was melancholly,
          and its deportment grave. Unlike the baboon or monkey, whoſe 
          <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0823900104:254"/> motions are violent and appetites capricious, who are
          fond of miſchief and obedient only from fear, this animal was ſlow in in
          its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and a look was ſufficient to keep it in awe. I have ſeen it,
          ſays Mr. Buffon, give its hand to ſhow the company to the door: I have
          ſeen it ſit at table, unfold its napkin, wipe its lips, make uſe of the
          ſpoon and the fork to carry the victuals to its mouth, pour out its drink
          into a glaſs, touch glaſſes when invited, take a cup and ſaucer and lay
          them on the table, put in ſugar, pour out its tea, leave it to cool be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
          drinking, and all this without any other inſtigation than the ſigns or the
          command of its maſter, and often of its own accord. It was gentle and
          inoffenſive; it even approached ſtrangers with reſpect, and came rather
          to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive careſſes than to offer injuries. It was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly fond of
          ſugared comfits, which every body was ready to give it; and, as it had a
          de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion upon the bread, ſo much ſugar contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to encreaſe the
          diſorder and ſhorten its life. It continued at Paris but one ſummer, and
          died in London. It ate indiſcriminately of all things, but it preferred dry
          and ripe fruits to all other aliments. It would drink wine, but in ſmall
          quantities, and gladly left it for milk, tea, or any other ſweet liquor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0823900104:255"/>Such theſe animals appeared when brought
          into Europe. However, many of their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary habits were probably the
          reſult of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and we are not told how, long the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions they
          received for this purpoſe were continued. But we learn from another account
          that they take but a very ſhort time to come to a great degree of imitative
          perfection. Mr. L. Broſſe bought two young ones, that were but a year old,
          from a Negroe; and theſe at that early age diſcovered an aſtoniſhing
          power of imitation<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>As quoted by Buffon, vol.
              xxviii. p. 77.</bibl>
               </note>. They even then ſat at the table like men, ate
          of every thing without diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made uſe of their knife, ſpoon, and
          fork, both to eat their meat and help themſelves. They drank wine and other
          liquors. When carried on ſhipboard, they had ſigns for the cabbin boys
          expreſſive of their wants; and whenever theſe neglected attending upon
          them as they deſired, they inſtantly flew into a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſeized
          them by the arm, bit them, and kept them down. The male was ſea-ſick, and
          required attendance like an human creature; he was even twice bled in the arm;
          and every time afterwards when he found himſelf out of order, he ſhewed his
          arm, as deſirous of being relieved by bleeding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0823900104:256"/>Pyrard relates, that in the province of Sierra
          Leona, in Africa, there are a kind of apes, called Baris, which are ſtrong
          and muſcular, and which, if properly inſtructed when young, ſerve as very
          uſeful domeſtics. They uſually walk upright; they pound at a mortar; they
          go to the river to fetch water, this they carry back in a little pitcher, on
          their heads; but if care be not taken to receive the pitcher at their return,
          they let it fall to the ground, and then, ſeeing it broken, they begin to
          lament and cry for their loſs. Le Compte's account is much to the ſame
          purpoſe of an ape, which he ſaw in the Streights of Molucca. 
          <q rend="inline">"It walked upon its two hind feet, which it bent a
            little, like a dog that had been taught to dance. It made uſe of its hands
            and arms as we do. Its viſage was not much more diſagreeable than that of
            an Hottentot; but the body was all over covered with a woolly hair of different
            colours. As to the reſt, it cried like a child; all its outward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were
            ſo like the human, and the paſſions ſo lively and ſignificant, that
            dumb men could ſcarce better expreſs their conceptions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. It
            had alſo that expreſſion of paſſion or joy which we often ſee in
            children, ſtamping with its feet, and ſtriking them againſt the ground,
            to ſhew its ſpight, or when refuſed <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0823900104:257"/> any thing it
            paſſionately longed for. Although theſe animals," continues he, "are very
            big, for that I ſaw was four feet high, their nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is incredible. It
            is a pleaſure beyond expreſſion to ſee them run up the tackling of a
            ſhip, where they ſometimes play as if they had a knack of vaulting peculiar
            to themſelves, or as if they had been paid, like our rope-dancers, to divert
            the company. Sometimes, ſuſpended by one arm, they poize themſelves, and
            then turn all of a ſudden round about a rope, with as much quickneſs as a
            wheel, or a ſling put into motion. Sometimes holding the rope
            ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively with their long fingers, and, letting their whole body fall
            into the air, they run full ſpeed from one end to the other, and come back
            again with the ſame ſwiftneſs. There is no poſture but they imitate,
            nor motion but they perform. Bending themſelves like a bow, rolling like a
            bowl, hanging by the hands, feet, and teeth, according to the different
            fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with which their capricious imagination ſupplies them. But what is
            ſtill more amazing than all is, their agility to fling themſelves from one
            rope to another, though at thirty, forty, and fifty feet diſtance."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such are the habitudes and the powers of the ſmaller claſs of
          theſe extraordinary creatures; <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0823900104:258"/> but we are preſented
          with a very different pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in thoſe of a larger ſtature and more
          muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular form. The little animals we have been deſcribing, which are
          ſeldom found above four feet high, ſeem to partake of the nature of dwarfs
          among the human ſpecies, being gentle, aſſiduous, and playful, rather
          fitted to amuſe than terrify. But the gigantic races of the Ourang Outang,
          ſeen and deſcribed by travellers, are truly formidable; and in the gloomy
          foreſts, where they are only found, ſeem to hold undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted dominion.
          Many of theſe are as tall or taller than a man; active, ſtrong and
          intrepid, cunning, laſcivious and cruel. This redoubtable rival of mankind is
          found in many parts of Africa, in the Eaſt-Indies, in Madagaſcar, and in
          Borneo<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Le Compte's Hiſtory of
              China.</bibl>
               </note>. In the laſt of theſe places, the people of quality
          courſe him as we do the ſtag; and this ſort of hunting is one of the
          favourite amuſements of the king himſelf. This creature is extremely
          ſwift of foot, endowed with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſtrength, and runs with
          prodigious celerity. His ſkin is all hairy, his eyes ſunk in his head, his
          countenance ſtern, his face tanned, and all his lineaments, though exactly
          human, harſh and blackened by the ſun. In Africa this creature is even
          ſtill more formidable. Battel calls <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0823900104:259"/> him the Pongo, and
          aſſures us that in all his proportions he reſembles a man, except that he
          is much larger, even to a gigantic ſtate. His face reſembles that of a man,
          the eyes deep ſunk in the head, the hair on each ſide ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely long, the
          viſage naked and without hair, as alſo the ears and the hands. The body is
          lightly covered, and ſcarcely differing from that of a man, except that there
          are no calves to the legs. Still, however, the animal is ſeen to walk upon
          his hinder legs, and in an erect poſture. He ſleeps under trees, and builds
          himſelf an hut, which ſerves to protect him againſt the ſun and the
          rains of the tropical climates, of which he is a native. He lives only upon
          fruits, and is no way carnivorous. He cannot ſpeak, although furniſhed with
          greater inſtinct than any other animal of the brute creation. When the
          Negroes make a fire in the woods, this animal comes near and warms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
          by the blaze. However, he has not ſkill enough to keep the flame alive by
          feeding it with fuel. They go together in companies; and if they happen to meet
          one of the human ſpecies, remote from ſuccour, they ſhew him no mercy.
          They even attack the elephant, which they beat with their clubs, and oblige to
          leave that part of the foreſt which they claim <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0823900104:260"/> as
          their own. It is impoſſible to take any of theſe dreadful creatures
          alive, for they are ſo ſtrong that ten men would not be a match for but one
          of them. None of this kind, therefore, are taken except when very young, and
          theſe but rarely, when the female happens to leave them behind, for in
          general they keep clung to the breaſt, and adhere both with legs and arms.
          From the ſame traveller we learn, that when one of theſe animals dies, the
          reſt cover the body with a quantity of leaves and branches. They ſometimes
          alſo ſhew mercy to the human kind. A Negroe boy, that was taken by one of
          theſe, and carried into the woods, continued there a whole year, without
          receiving any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Le Broſſe, as quoted by
              Buffon, vol. xxviii. p. 70.</bibl>
               </note>. From another traveller we learn,
          that theſe animals often attempt to ſurprize the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Negroes as they go
          into the woods, and frequently keep them againſt their wills for the
          pleaſure of their company, feeding them very plentifully all the time. He
          aſſures us that he knew a woman of Loango that had lived among theſe
          animals for three years. They grow from ſix to ſeven feet high, and are of
          unequalled ſtrength. They build ſheds, and make uſe of clubs for their
          defence. Their faces are broad, their noſes flat, their ears without a tip, 
          <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0823900104:261"/> their ſkins are more bright than that of a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latoe,
          and they are covered on many parts of the body with long and tawny coloured
          hair. Their belly is large, their heels flat, and yet riſing behind. They
          ſometimes walk upright, and ſometimes upon all fours, when they are
          phantaſtically diſpoſed.</p>
            <p>From this deſcription of the Ouran Outang, we perceive at what a
          diſtance the firſt animal of the brute creation is placed from the very
          loweſt of the human ſpecies. Even in countries peopled with ſavages, this
          creature is conſidered as a beaſt; and in thoſe very places where we
          might ſuppoſe the ſmalleſt difference between them and mankind, the
          inhabitants hold it in the greateſt contempt and deteſtation. In Borneo,
          where this animal has been ſaid to come to its greateſt perfection, the
          natives hunt it in the ſame manner as they purſue the elephant or the lion,
          while its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to the human form procures it neither pity nor
          protection. The gradations of Nature in the other parts of nature are minute
          and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible; in the paſſage from quadrupedes to fiſhes we can
          ſcarce tell where the quadrupede ends and the fiſh begins; in the deſcent
          from beaſts to inſects we can hardly diſtinguiſh the ſteps of the
          progreſſion; but in the aſcent from brutes to man, the line is ſtrongly
          drawn, well <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0823900104:262"/> marked, and unpaſſable. It is in vain
          that the Ouran Outang reſembles man in form, or imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates many of his
          actions; he ſtill continues a wretched, helpleſs creature, pent up in the
          moſt gloomy part of the foreſt, and, with regard to the proviſion for his
          own happineſs, inferior even to the elephant or the beaver in ſagacity. To
          us, indeed, this animal ſeems much wiſer than it really is. As we have long
          been uſed to meaſure the ſagacity of all actions by their ſimilitude to
          our own, and not their fitneſs to the animal's way of living, we are
          pleaſed with the imitations of the ape, even though we know they are far from
          contributing to the convenience of its ſituation. An ape, or a quadrupede,
          when under the tramels of human education, may be an admirable object for human
          curioſity, but is very little advanced by all its learning in the road to its
          own felicity. On the contrary, I have never ſeen any of theſe long
          inſtructed animals that did not, by their melancholly air, appear
          ſenſible of the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of their ſituation. Its marks of
          ſeeming ſagacity were merely relative to us and not to the animal; and all
          its boaſted wiſdom was merely of our own making.</p>
            <p>There is, in fact, another circumſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to this animal
          which ought not to be <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:263"/>

          concealed. I have many reaſons to believe that the moſt perfect of the kind
          are prone, like the reſt of the quadrupede creation, and only owe their erect
          attitude to human education. Almoſt all the travellers who ſpeak of them
          mention their going ſometimes upon all fours, and ſometimes erect. As their
          chief reſidence is among trees, they are without doubt uſually ſeen erect
          while they are climbing; but it is more than probable that their efforts to
          eſcape upon the ground are by running upon the hands and feet together.
          Schouten, who mentions their education, tells us that they are taken in traps,
          and taught in the beginning to walk upon their hind legs; which certainly
          implies that in a ſtate of nature they run upon all fours. Add to this, that,
          when we examine the palms of their hands and the ſoals of their feet, we find
          both equally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and beaten; a certain proof that both have been equally
          uſed. In thoſe hot countries, where the apes are known to reſide, the
          ſoals of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes feet, who go bare-foot, are covered with a ſkin above
          an inch thick; while their hands are as ſoft as thoſe of an European. Did
          the apes walk in the ſame manner, the ſame exerciſe would have
          furniſhed them with ſimilar advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which is not the caſe. Beſides
          all this, I have been aſſured by a very credible traveller, 
          <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0823900104:267"/> that theſe animals naturally run in the woods upon all
          fours; and when they are taken, their hands are tied behind them, to teach them
          to walk upright. This attitude they learn after ſome time; and, thus
          inſtructed, they are ſent into Europe to aſtoniſh the ſpeculative
          with their near approaches to humanity, while it is never conſidered how much
          is natural, and how much has been acquired in the ſavage ſchools of Benin
          and Angola.</p>
            <p>The animal next to theſe, and to be placed in the ſame claſs,
          is the Ape, properly ſo called, or the Pithekos of the ancients. This is much
          leſs than the former, being not above a foot and an half high, but walks
          erect, is without a tail, and is eaſily tamed.</p>
            <p>Of this kind alſo is the Gibbon, ſo called by Buffon, or the
          Long Armed Ape, which is a very extraordinary and remarkable creature. It is of
          different ſizes, being from four feet to two feet high. It walks erect, is
          without a tail, has a face reſembling that of a man, with a circle of buſhy
          hair all round the viſage; its eyes are large and ſunk in its head; its
          face tanned and its ears exactly proportioned. But that in which it chiefly
          differs from all others of the monkey tribe is the extraordinary length of its
          arms, which, when the animal <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:268"/>

          Ape, moſt nearly reſembles mankind, not only in form, but in gentle manners

          bone. It differs alſo in having a large callous red rump. The face is
          prominent, and approaches more to that of quadrupedes than of man. The body is
          covered with a browniſh hair, and yellow on the belly. It is about three feet

               <p>DESCENDING from the more perfect of the monkey kinds, we come to
            the baboon and its varieties, a large, fierce, and formidable race, that,
            mixing the figure of the man and the quadrupede in their conformation, ſeem
            to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs only the defects of both; the petulance of the one, and the
            ferocity of the other. Theſe animals have a ſhort tail; a prominent face;
            with canine teeth, larger than thoſe of men, and calloſſities on the
            rump<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon, vol. xxviii. p. 183.</bibl>
                  </note>.
            In man the phyſiognomy may deceive, and the figure of body does not always
            lead to the qualities of the mind; but in animals we may always judge of their
            diſpoſitions by their looks, and form a juſt conjecture of their internal
            habits from their external form. If we compare the nature of the ape and baboon
            by this eaſy rule, we ſhall at once be led to pronounce that they greatly
            differ in their diſpoſitions, and that the latter are infinitely more
            fierce, ſavage and malicious than the former. The ouran outang, that ſo
            nearly reſembles man in its figure, approaches alſo neareſt in the
            gentleneſs of its manners and the pliancy of its temper. The cynocephalus,
            that of all other apes is moſt unlike man in <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0823900104:276"/> form, and
            approaches nearer the dog in face, reſembles alſo the brute in nature,
            being wild, reſtleſs, and impelled by a fretful impetuoſity. But the
            baboon, who is ſtill more remote, and reſembles man only in having hands,
            who, from having a tail, a prominent face, and ſharp claws, approaches more
            nearly to the ſavage tribe, is every way fierce, malicious, ignorant and
            un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable.</p>
               <p>The baboon, properly ſo called, is from three to four feet high,
            very ſtrong built, with a thick body and limbs, and canine teeth, much longer
            than thoſe of men. It has large cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſities behind, which are quite naked
            and red. Its tail is crooked and thick, and about ſeven or eight inches long.
            Its ſnout, for it can hardly be called a face, is long and thick, and on each
            ſide of its cheeks it has a pouch, into which, when ſatiated with eating,
            it puts the remainder of its proviſions. It is covered with long thick hair
            of a reddiſh brown colour, and pretty uniform over the whole body. It walks
            more commonly upon all fours than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and its hands as well as its feet
            are armed with long ſharp claws, inſtead of the broad round nails of the
            ape kind.</p>
               <p>An animal thus made for ſtrength, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with
            dangerous weapons, is found in fact <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0823900104:277"/> to be one of the
            moſt formidable of the ſavage race, in thoſe countries where it is bred.
            It appears in its native woods, to be impelled by two oppoſite paſſions;
            an hatred for the males of the human ſpecies, and a deſire for women. Were
            we aſſured of theſe ſtrange oppoſitions in its diſpoſition from
            one teſtimony alone, the account might appear doubtful; but, as it comes from
            a variety of the moſt credible witneſſes, we cannot refuſe our
            aſſent. From them, therefore, we learn that theſe animals will often
            aſſail women in a body, and force them into the woods, where they keep them
            againſt their will, and kill them when refractory. From the Chevalier Forbin
            we learn, that in Siam whole troops of theſe will often ſally forth from
            their foreſts, and attack a village, when they know the men are engaged in
            their rice harveſt. They are on ſuch occaſions actuated as well by
            deſire as by hunger; and not only plunder the houſes of whatever
            proviſions they can find, but endeavour to force the women. Theſe, however,
            as the Chevalier humourouſly relates, not at all liking either the manners or
            the figure of the paltry gallants, boldly ſtand on their defence, and with
            clubs, or whatever other arms they can provide, inſtead of anſwering their
            careſſes, oblige their ugly ſuitors to retreat; <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0823900104:278"/>
            not, however, before they have damaged or plundered every thing eatable they
            can lay their hands on.</p>
               <p>At the Cape of Good Hope they are leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, but to the
            beſt of their power equally miſchievous. They are there under a ſort of
            natural diſcipline, and go about whatever they undertake with ſurprizing
            ſkill and regularity. When they ſet about robbing an orchard or a vineyard,
            for they are extremely fond of grapes, apples, and ripe fruit, they do not go
            ſingly to work, but in large companies, and with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted deliberation.
            On theſe occaſions, a part of them enter the encloſure, while one is
            ſet to watch. The reſt ſtand without the fence, and form a line reaching
            all the way from their fellows within to their rendezvous without, which is
            generally in ſome craggy mountain. Every thing being thus diſpoſed, the
            plunderers within the orchard throw the fruit to thoſe that are without as
            faſt as they can gather it; or, if the wall or hedge be high, to thoſe that
            ſit on the top; and theſe hand the plunder to thoſe next them on the
            other ſide. Thus the fruit is pitched from one to another all along the line,
            till it is ſafely depoſited at their head quarters. They catch it as
            readily as the moſt ſkilful tennis player can a ball; and while the
            buſineſs <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0823900104:279"/> is going forward, which they conduct with
            great expedition, a moſt profound ſilence is obſerved among them. Their
            centinel, during this whole time, continues upon the watch, extremely anxious
            and attentive; but if he perceives any one coming, he inſtantly ſets up a
            loud cry, and at this ſignal the whole company ſcamper off. Nor yet are
            they at any time willing to leave the place empty handed; for if they be
            plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering a bed of melons, for inſtance, they go off with one in their
            mouths, one in their hands, and one under their arm. If the purſuit is hot,
            they drop firſt that from under their arm, then that from their hand; and, if
            it be continued, they at laſt let fall that which they had hitherto kept in
            their mouths.</p>
               <p>The natives of the Cape often take the young of theſe animals,
            and, feeding them with ſheep and goats milk, accuſtom them to guard their
            houſes; which duty they perform with great punctuality. Thoſe, however,
            that have been brought into Europe, are headſtrong, rude, and untractable.
            Dogs and cats, when they have done any thing wrong, will run off; but theſe
            ſeem careleſs and inſenſible of the miſchief they do; and I have
            ſeen one of them break a whole table of china, as it ſhould ſeem by
            deſign, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out appearing in the leaſt conſcious of having 
            <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0823900104:280"/> done amiſs. It was not, however, in any reſpect ſo
            formidable as that deſcribed by Mr. Buffon, of which he gives the following
            deſcription. 
            <q rend="inline">"It was not," ſays he, "extremely ugly, and yet
              it excited horror. It continually appeared in a ſtate of ſavage ferocity,
              gnaſhing its teeth, flying at the ſpectators, and furiouſly reſtleſs.
              It was obliged to be confined in an iron cage, the bars of which it ſo
              forcibly attempted to break, that the ſpectators were ſtruck with
              apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It was a ſtocky bold animal, whoſe ſhort limbs and
              powerful exertions ſhewed vaſt ſtrength and agility. The long hair with
              which it was covered ſeemed to add to its apparent abilities; which, however,
              were in reality ſo great, that it could eaſily overcome more than a
              ſingle man, unleſs armed. As to the reſt, it for ever appeared excited by
              that paſſion which renders the mildeſt animals at intervals furious. Its
              laſciviouſneſs was conſtant, and its ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions particular. Some
              others alſo of the monkey kind ſhewed the ſame degree of impudence, and
              particularly in the preſence of women; but, as they were leſs in ſize,
              their petulance was leſs obvious, and their inſolence more eaſily
              cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected."</q>
               </p>
               <p>But, however violent the deſires of theſe animals may be, they
            are not found to breed <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0823900104:281"/> in our climate. The female brings
            forth uſually but one at a time, which ſhe carries in her arms, and in a
            peculiar manner clinging to her breaſt. As to the reſt, theſe animals are
            not at all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivorous; they principally feed upon fruits, roots, and corn,
            and generally keep together in companies. The internal parts are more unlike
            thoſe of man than of quadrupedes, particularly the liver, which is like that
            of a dog divided into ſix lobes. The lungs are more divided, the guts in
            general are ſhorter, and the kidnies rounder and flatter.</p>
               <p>The largeſt of the baboon kind is the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dril; an ugly
            diſguſting animal, with a tail ſhorter than the former, though of a much

            longer than that of the preceding, it is of a bluiſh colour, and ſtrongly
            marked with wrinkles, which give it a frightful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. But what renders
            it truly loathſome is, that from the noſe there is always ſeen
            iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing a ſnot, which the animal takes care at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals to lick off
            with its tongue and ſwallow. it is a native of the Gold Coaſt; it is ſaid
            to walk more frequently erect than upon all fours; and when diſpleaſed, to
            weep like a child. There was one of them ſhewn in England ſome years ago.

               <p>The Wanderow is a baboon rather leſs than the former, with the
            body leſs compact and muſcular, and the hinder parts ſeemingly more
            feeble. The tail is from ſeven to eight inches long; the muzzle is prominent
            as in the reſt of this kind; but what particularly diſtinguiſhes it is a
            large long white head of hair, together with a monſtrous white beard,
            coarſe, rough, and deſcending; the colour of the reſt of the body being
            brown or black. As to the reſt, in its ſavage ſtate, it is equally fierce
            with the others; but, with a proper education, it ſeems more tractable than
            moſt of its kind, and is chiefly ſeen in the woods of Ceylon and

               <p>The Maimon of Buffon, which Edwards calls the Pigtail, is the
            laſt of the baboons, and in ſize rather approaches the monkey, being no
            larger than a cat. Its chief diſtinction, beſides its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent muzzle,
            like a baboon, is in the tail, which is about five or ſix inches long, and
            curled up like that of an hog; from which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, peculiar to this
            animal, our Engliſh naturaliſt gave it the name. It is a native of Sumatra,
            and does not well endure the rigours of our climate. Edwards, however, kept one

               <head>THE MONKEY.</head>
               <p>THE varieties in the larger tribes of the monkey kind are but few;
            in the ape we have ſeen but four, and in the baboon about as many. But when
            we come to the ſmaller claſs, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences among them ſeem too
            tedious for enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration. Theſe, as was obſerved in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, are all
            ſmall in ſtature, and with long tails, by which they are diſtinguiſhed
            from the preceding, that entirely want the tail, or are large and have but a
            ſhort one. The varieties in the form and colour of dogs, or ſquirrels, is
            nothing to what are found among monkies of the ſmaller kind. Boſman
            mentions above fifty ſorts on the Gold Coaſt alone, and Smith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the
            account. Condamine aſſerts that it would take up a volume to deſcribe the
            diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of theſe to be found along the river Amazons; and we are ſure
            that every one of <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0823900104:287"/> theſe is very different from thoſe
            on the African coaſt. Naturaliſts, however, have undertaken to make a
            catalogue of their numbers; and they either tranſmit their deſcriptions
            from one to another, or only enumerate thoſe few that have found their way to
            Europe, and have fallen within the narrow circle of their own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
            But, though it may be proper enough to deſcribe ſuch as fall under notice,
            it is certainly wrong to offer a ſcanty catalogue as complete, and to induce
            the reader to ſuppoſe he ſees a picture of the whole groupe of theſe
            animals when he is only preſented with a ſmall part of the number. Such,
            therefore, as are fond of the reputation of adding new deſcriptions to the
            ſtock of natural hiſtory, have here a wide, though ſurely a barren, field
            to enlarge in; and they will find it no difficult matter, by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
            various animals of this kind that are from time to time brought from their
            native coaſts to this country, to indulge in deſcription, and to ring the
            changes upon all the technical terms with which this moſt pleaſing
            ſcience is obſcured and rendered diſguſting. For my own part, I will
            ſpare the reader and myſelf the trouble of entering into an elaborate
            deſcription of each; content with obſerving once more, that their numbers
            are very great and their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0823900104:288"/> very trifling.
            There is ſcarce a country in the tropical climates that does not ſwarm with
            them, and ſcarce a foreſt that is not inhabited by a race of monkies
            diſtinct from all others. Every different wood along the coaſts of Africa
            may be conſidered as a ſeparate colony of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies, differing from thoſe
            of the next diſtrict in colour, in ſize, and malicious miſchief. It is
            indeed remarkable that the monkies of two cantons are never found to mix with
            each other, but rigorouſly to obſerve a ſeparation; each foreſt
            produces only its own; and theſe guard their limits from the intruſion of
            all ſtrangers of a different race from themſelves. In this they ſomewhat
            reſemble the human inhabitants of the ſavage nations, among whom they are
            found, where the petty kingdoms are numerous, and their manners oppoſite.
            There, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of a few miles, the traveller is preſented with men
            ſpeaking different languages, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing different religions, governed
            by different laws, and only reſembling each other in their mutual
            animoſity.</p>
               <p>In general, monkies of all kinds, being leſs than the baboon,
            are endued with leſs powers of doing miſchief. Indeed, the ferocity of
            their nature ſeems to diminiſh with their ſize; and when taken wild in
            the woods, they are ſooner <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0823900104:289"/> tamed, and more eaſily
            taught to imitate man than the former. More gentle than the baboon, and leſs
            grave and ſullen than the ape, they ſoon begin to exert all their
            ſportive mimickries, and are eaſily reſtrained by correction. But it
            muſt be confeſſed that they will do nothing they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired without
            beating; for, if their fears be entirely removed, they are the moſt
            inſolent and headſtrong animals in nature.</p>
               <p>In their native woods they are not leſs the peſts of man than
            of other animals. The monkies, ſays a traveller<note n="*" place="bottom">

            are in poſſeſſion of every foreſt where they reſide, and may be
            con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the maſters of the place. Neither the tiger, nor the lion
            itſelf, will venture to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the dominion, ſince theſe, from the
            tops of trees, continually carry on an offenſive war, and by their agility
            eſcape all poſſibility of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. Nor have the birds leſs to fear
            from their continual depredations; for, as theſe harmleſs inhabitants of
            the wood uſually build upon trees, the monkies are for ever on the watch to
            find out and rob their neſts; and ſuch is their petulant delight in
            miſchief, that they will fling their eggs againſt the ground when they want
            appetite or inclination to devour them.</p>
               <p>There is but one animal in all the foreſt that 
            <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0823900104:290"/> ventures to oppoſe the monkey, and that is the
            ſerpent. The larger ſnakes are often ſeen winding up the trees where the
            monkies reſide; and, when they happen to ſurprize them ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
            ſwallow them whole before the little ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals have time to make a defence. In
            this manner, the two moſt miſchievous kinds in all nature keep the whole
            foreſt between them; both equally formidable to each other, and for ever
            employed in mutual hoſtilities. The monkies in general inhabit the tops of
            the trees, and the ſerpents cling to the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches nearer the bottom; and in
            this manner they are for ever ſeen near each other, like ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the
            ſame field of battle. Some travellers, indeed, have ſuppoſed that their
            vicinity rather argued their mutual friendſhip, and that they united in this
            manner to form an offenſive league againſt all the reſt of animated

            <q rend="inline">"I have ſeen theſe monkies," ſays Labat,
              "play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their gambols upon thoſe very branches on which the ſnakes were
              repoſing, and jumping over them without receiving any injury, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the
              ſerpents of that country were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally vindictive, and always ready to bite
              what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſturbed them."</q> Theſe gambols, however, were probably
            nothing more than the inſults of <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0823900104:291"/> an enemy that was
            conſcious of its own ſafety; and the monkies might have provoked the
            ſnake in the ſame manner as we often ſee ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows twitter at a cat.
            However this be, the foreſt is generally divided between them; and theſe
            woods, which Nature ſeems to have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed with her richeſt
            magnificence, rather inſpire terror than delight, and chiefly ſerve as
            retreats for miſchief and malignity.</p>
               <p>The enmity of theſe animals to mankind, is partly ridiculous,
            and partly formidable. They ſeem, ſays Le Comte and others, to have a
            peculiar inſtinct in diſcovering their foes; and are perfectly ſkilled,
            when attacked, in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually defending and aſſiſting each other. When a
            traveller enters among theſe woods, they conſider him as an invader upon
            their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and join all to repel the intruſion. At firſt they
            ſurvey him with a kind of inſolent cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity They jump from branch to
            branch, purſue him as he goes along, and make a loud chattering, to call the
            reſt of their companions together. They then begin their hoſtilities by
            grinning, threatening, and flinging down the withered branches at him, which
            they break from the trees: they even take their excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their hands, and
            throw them at his head. Thus they attend him wherever he goes; 
            <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0823900104:292"/> jumping from tree to tree with ſuch amazing
            ſwiftneſs, that the eye can ſcarce attend their motions. Although they
            take the moſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate leaps, yet they are ſeldom ſeen to come to the
            ground, for they eaſily faſten upon the branches that break their fall, and
            ſtick, either by their hands, feet, or tail, wherever they touch. If one of
            them happens to be wounded, the reſt aſſemble round, and clap their
            fingers into the wound, as if they were deſirous of ſounding its depth. If
            the blood flows in any quantity, ſome of them keep it ſhut up, while others
            get leaves, which they chew, and thruſt into the opening: however
            extraordinary this may appear, it is aſſerted to be often ſeen, and to be
            ſtrictly true. In this manner they wage a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant, unequal war; and are
            often killed in numbers before they think proper to make a retreat. This they
            effect with the ſame preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation with which they at firſt came together.
            In this retreat the young are ſeen clinging to the back of the female, with
            which ſhe jumps away, ſeemingly unembarraſſed by the burthen.</p>
               <p>The curioſity of the Europeans has, in ſome meaſure, induced
            the natives of the places where theſe animals reſide, to catch or take them
            alive by every art they are able. The <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0823900104:293"/> uſual way in
            ſuch caſe, is to ſhoot the female as ſhe carries her young, and then
            both, of courſe, tumble to the ground. But even this is not eaſily
            performed; for if the animal be not killed outright, it will not fall; but
            clinging to ſome branch, continues, even when dead, its former graſp, and
            remains on the tree where it was ſhot, until it drops off by putrefaction: In
            this manner it is totally loſt to the purſuer; for to attempt climbing the
            tree, to bring either it or the young one down, would probably be fatal, from
            the number of ſerpents that are hid among the branches. For this reaſon the
            ſportſman always takes care to aim at the head; which, if he hits, the
            monkey falls directly to the ground; and the young one comes down at the ſame
            time, clinging to its dead parent.</p>
               <p>The Europeans along the coaſts of Guniea, often go into the
            woods to ſhoot monkies; and nothing pleaſes the Negroes more than to ſee
            thoſe animals drop, againſt which they have the greateſt animoſity.
            They conſider them, and not without reaſon, as the moſt miſchievous and
            tormenting creatures in the world; and are happy to ſee their numbers
            deſtroyed, upon a double account; as well becauſe they dread their
            devaſtations, as becauſe they love their fleſh. The monkey, which is
            always ſkinned <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0823900104:294"/> before it is eaten, when ſerved up at
            a Negroe feaſt, looks, ſo like a child, that an European is ſhocked at
            the very ſight. The natives, however, who are not ſo nice, devour it as one
            of the higheſt delicacies; and aſſiduouſly attend our ſportſmen, to
            profit by the ſpoil. But what they are chiefly aſtoniſhed at, is to ſee
            our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers carefully taking the young ones alive, while they leave them
            the old ones, that are certainly the moſt fit to be eaten. They cannot
            comprehend what advantage can ariſe to us from educating or keeping a little
            animal, that, by experience, they know to be equally fraught with tricks and
            miſchief: ſome of them have even been led to ſuppoſe, that, with a kind
            of perverſe affection, we love only creatures of the moſt miſchievous
            kinds; and having ſeen us often buy young and tame monkies, they have taken
            equal care to bring rats to our factors, offering them for ſale, and greatly
            diſappointed at finding no purchaſer for ſo hopeful a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>The Negroes conſider theſe animals as their greateſt plague;
            and, indeed, they do incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible damage, when they come in companies to lay
            waſte a field of Indian corn or rice, or a plantation of ſugar-canes. They
            carry off as <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0823900104:295"/> much as they are able; and they deſtroy
            ten times more than they bear away. Their manner of plundering is pretty much
            like that of the baboons, already mentioned, in a garden. One of them ſtands
            centinel upon a tree, while the reſt are plundering, carefully and
            cautiouſly turning on every ſide, but particularly to that on which there
            is the greateſt danger: in the mean time, the reſt of the ſpoilers
            purſue their work with great ſilence and aſſiduity; they are not
            contented with the firſt blade of corn, or the firſt cane that they happen
            to lay their hands on: they firſt pull up ſuch as appear moſt alluring to
            the eye: they turn it round, examine, compare it with others, and if they find
            it to their mind, ſtick it under one of their ſhoulders. When in this
            manner they have got their load, they begin to think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating: but if it
            ſhould happen that the owners of the field appear to interrupt their
            depredations, their faithful centinel inſtantly gives notice, by crying out,
            <hi>houp, houp, houp</hi>; which the reſt perfectly underſtand, and all at
            once throwing down the corn they hold in the left hands, ſcamper off upon
            three legs, carrying the remainder in the right. If they are ſtill hotly
            purſued, they then are content to throw down their whole burthen, and to take
            refuge <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0823900104:296"/> among their woods, on the tops of which they
            remain in perfect ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Were we to give faith to what ſome travellers aſſure us, of

            are under a kind of diſcipline, which they exerciſe among each other. They
            are generally ſeen to keep together in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, to march in exact order,
            and to obey the voice of ſome particular chieftain, remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for his
            ſize and gravity. One ſpecies of theſe, which Mr. Buffon calls the
            Ouarine, and which are remarkable for the loudneſs and the diſtinctneſs
            of their voice, are ſtill more ſo for the uſe to which they convert it.

              Morgrave, "of their aſſemblies and deliberations. Every day, both morning
              and evening, the ouarines aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble in the woods to receive inſtructions.
              When all come together, one among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber takes the higheſt place on a
              tree, and makes a ſignal with his hand to the reſt to ſit round, in order
              to hearken. As ſoon as he ſees them placed, he begins his diſcourſe,
              with ſo loud a voice, and yet in a manner ſo precipitate, that to hear him
              at a diſtance, one would think the whole company were crying out at the
              ſame <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0823900104:297"/> time: however, during that time, one only is
              ſpeaking; and all the reſt obſerve the moſt profound ſilence. When
              this has done, he makes a ſign with the hand for the reſt to reply; and at
              that inſtant they raiſe their voices to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, until by another ſignal
              of the hand they are enjoined ſilence. This they as readily obey; till, at
              laſt, the whole aſſembly breaks up, after hearing a repetition of the
              ſame preachment."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The chief food of the monkey-tribe is fruits, the buds of trees,
            or ſucculent roots and plants. They all, like man, ſeem fond of ſweets;
            and particularly the pleaſant juice of the palm-tree, and the ſugar cane.
            With theſe the fertile regions in which they are bred, ſeldom fail to
            ſupply them; but when it happens that theſe fail, or that more nouriſhing
            food becomes more agreeable, they eat inſects and worms; and, ſometimes, if
            near the coaſts, deſcend to the ſea-ſhore, where they eat oyſters,
            crabs, and ſhell fiſh. Their manner of managing an oyſter is
            extraordinary enough; but it is too well atteſted, to fail of our aſſent.
            As the oyſters in the tropical climates are generally larger than with us,
            the monkies, when they go to the ſea-ſide pick up a ſtone, and clap it
            between the opening ſhells: this prevents them <pb n="228" facs="tcp:0823900104:298"/> from
            cloſing; and the monkey then eats the fiſh at his eaſe. They often alſo
            draw crabs from the water, by putting their tail to the hole where that animal
            takes refuge, and the crab faſtening upon it, they withdraw it with a jerk,
            and thus pull their prey upon ſhore. This habit of laying traps for other
            animals, makes them very cautious of being entrapped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and I am
            aſſured, by many perſons of credit, that no ſnare, how nicely baited
            ſoever, will take the monkey of the Weſt-Indian iſlands; for having been
            accuſtomed to the cunning of man, it oppoſes its natural diſtruſt to
            human artifice.</p>
               <p>The monkey generally brings forth one at a time, and ſometimes
            two. They are rarely found to breed when brought over into Europe; but of
            thoſe that do, they exhibit a very ſtriking picture of parental affection.
            The male and female are never tired of fondling their young one. They
            inſtruct it with no little aſſiduity; and often ſeverely correct it, if
            ſtubborn, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inclined to profit by their example: they hand it from one
            to the other; and when the male has done ſhewing his regard, the female takes
            her turn. When wild in the woods, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, if ſhe happens to have two,
            carries one on her back, and the other in her arms: that <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0823900104:299"/>
            on her back clings very cloſely, claſping its hands round her neck, and its
            feet about her middle; when ſhe wants to ſuckle it, ſhe then alters their
            poſition; and that which has been fed gives place to the other, which ſhe
            takes in her arms. It often happens that ſhe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to leap from one tree
            to another, when thus loaden; and upon ſuch occaſions, their dexterity is
            very ſurprizing. The whole family form a kind of chain, locking tail in tail,
            or hand in hand, and one of them holding the branch above, the reſt ſwing
            down, balancing to and fro, like a pendulum, until the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is enabled
            to catch hold of the lower branches of ſome neighbouring tree. When the hold
            is fixed below, the monkey lets go that which was above, and thus comes
            under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in turn; but, creeping up along the chain, attains the next
            branches, like the reſt; and thus they all take poſſeſſion of the
            tree, without ever coming to the ground.</p>
               <p>When in a ſtate of domeſtic tameneſs, thoſe animals are
            very amuſing, and often fill up a vacant hour, when other entertainment is
            want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There are few that are not acquainted with their various mimickries,
            and their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious feats of activity. But it is generally in company with
            other animals of a more ſimple <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0823900104:300"/> diſpoſition that
            their tricks and ſuperior in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts are ſhewn; they ſeem to take a
            delight in tormenting them; and I have ſeen one of them amuſing itſelf
            for hours together, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing upon the gravity of a cat. Eraſmus tells
            us of a large monkey, kept by Sir Thomas More, that, one day diverting itſelf
            in his garden, where ſome tame rabbits were kept, played ſeveral of its
            uſual pranks among them, while the rabbits ſcarce well knew what to make of
            their new acquaintance: in the mean time, a weaſel, that came for very
            different purpoſes than thoſe of entertainment, was ſeen peering about
            the place in which the rabbits were fed, and endeavouring to make its way, by
            removing a board that cloſed their hutch. While the monkey ſaw no danger,
            it continued a calm ſpectator of the enemy's efforts; but juſt when, by
            long labour, the weaſel had effected its purpoſe, and had removed the
            board, the monkey ſtept in, and, with, the utmoſt dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, faſtened it
            again in its place; and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed weaſel was too much fatigued to
            renew its operations. To this I will only add what Father Carli, in his
            hiſtory of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gola aſſures us to be true. In that horrid country, where
            he went to convert the ſavage natives to Chriſtianity, and met with nothing
            <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0823900104:301"/> but diſtreſs and diſappointment; while his health
            was totally impaired by the raging heats of the climate, his patience
            exhauſted by the obſtinacy of the ſtupid natives, and his little
            proviſions daily plundered, without redreſs, in ſuch an exigency he found
            more faithful ſervices from the monkies than the men; theſe he had taught
            to attend him, to guard him, while ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, againſt thieves and rats, to
            comb his head, to fetch his water; and, he aſſerts, that they were even
            more tractable than the human inhabitants of the place. It is indeed
            remarkable, that in thoſe countries where the men are moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and
            ſtupid, the brutes are moſt active and ſagacious. It is in the torrid
            tracts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by Barbarians, that ſuch various animals are found with
            inſtincts ſo nearly approaching reaſon. The ſavages both of Africa and
            Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, accordingly ſuppoſe monkies to be men; idle, ſlothful, rational
            beings; capable of ſpeech and converſation; but obſtinately dumb, for
            fear of being compelled to labour.</p>
               <p>As of all ſavages, thoſe of Africa are the moſt brutal,
            ſo, of all countries, the monkies of Africa are the moſt expert and
            entertaining. The monkies of America are, in general, neither ſo ſagacious
            nor ſo tractable, nor is their form ſo nearly approaching that of man. 
            <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0823900104:302"/> The monkies of the new continent, may be very eaſily
            diſtinguiſhed from thoſe of the old, by three marks. Thoſe of the
            ancient conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent are univerſally found to have a naked callous
            ſubſtance behind, upon which they ſit; which thoſe of America are
            entirely without; thoſe alſo of the ancient continent have the noſtrils
            differently formed, more reſembling thoſe of men, the holes opening
            downward; whereas the American monkies have them opening on each ſide;
            thoſe of the ancient world, have pouches on each ſide the jaw, into which
            they put their proviſions, which thoſe of America are without: laſtly,
            none of the monkies of the ancient continent hang by the tail, which many of
            the American ſorts are known to do. By theſe marks the monkies of either
            continent, may be readily diſtinguiſhed from each other, and prized
            accordingly. The African monkey, as I am aſſured, requires a longer
            education, and more correction, than that of America; but it is at laſt found
            ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of more various powers of imitation; and ſhews a greater degree of
            cunning and activity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Buffon, who has examined this race of imitative beings, with
            greater accuracy than any other naturaliſt before him, makes but 
            <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0823900104:303"/> nine ſpecies of monkies belonging to the ancient
            continent; and eleven belonging to the new. To all theſe he gives the names
            which they go by, in their reſpective countries; which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, is the
            method leaſt liable to error, and the moſt proper for imitation.</p>
               <p>Of the monkies of the ancient continent, the firſt, he
            deſcribes, is the Macaguo; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſembling a baboon in ſize,
            ſtrength of body, and an hideous wrinkled viſage: it differs, however, in
            having a very long tail, which is covered with tufted hair. It is a native of
            Congo.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the Patas, which is about the ſame ſize with
            the former; but differs, in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a longer body, and a face leſs hideous;
            it is particularly remarkable for the colour of its hair, which is of a red,
            ſo brilliant, that the animal looks as if it were actually painted. It is
            uſually brought from Senegal; and by ſome, called the Red African
            Monkey.</p>
               <p>The third of the ancient continent is the Malbrouk; of which he
            ſuppoſes the monkey which he calls the Bonet Chinois to be a variety. The
            one is remarkable for a long tail, and long beard; the other, for a cap of
            hair, that covers the crown of the head, from whence it takes the name. Both
            are natives of the Eaſt Indies; <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0823900104:304"/> and the Bramins, who
            extend their charity to all the brute creation, have hoſpitals for ſuch of
            them as happen to be ſick, or otherwiſe diſabled.</p>
               <p>The fourth of this kind, is the Mangabey; this may be
            diſtinguiſhed from all others, by its eye-lids, which are naked, and of a
            ſtriking whiteneſs. It is a native of Madagaſcar.</p>
               <p>The fifth is the Mona, or the Cephus of the ancients: it is
            diſtinguiſhed by its colour, which is variegated with black and red; and
            its tail is of an aſh-colour, with two white ſpots on each ſide, at its
            inſertion. It is a native of the northern parts of Africa.</p>
               <p>The ſixth is the Callitrix, or Green Monkey of St. Iägo;
            diſtinguiſhed by its beautiful green colour on the back, its white breaſt
            and belly, and its black face.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh is the Mouſtoc, or White Noſe; diſtinguiſhed
            by the whiteneſs of its lips, from whence it has received its name, the
            reſt of the face being of a deep blue. It is a native of the Gold Coaſt,
            and a very beautiful little animal.</p>
               <p>The eighth is the Talapoin; and may be diſtinguiſhed as well
            by its beautiful variety of green, white, and yellow hair, as by that under the
            eyes, being of a greater length than the reſt. <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0823900104:305"/> It is
            ſuppoſed to be a native of Africa and the eaſt.</p>
               <p>The ninth and laſt of the monkies of the ancient continent, is
            the Douc, ſo called in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinchina, of which country it is a native. The
            douc ſeems to unite the characters of all the former together: with a long
            tail, like the monkey; of a ſize as large as the baboon; and with a flat
            face, like the ape: it even reſembles the American monkies, in having no
            callous on its poſteriors. Thus it ſeems to form the ſhade by which the
            monkies of one continent are linked with thoſe of the other.</p>
               <p>Next come the monkies of the new continent; which, as hath been
            ſaid, differ from thoſe of the old, in the make of their noſtrils, in
            their having no calloſity on their poſteriors, and in their having no
            pouches on each ſide of the jaw. They differ alſo from each other, a part
            of them making no uſe of their tails to hang by; while others of them have
            the tail very ſtrong and muſcular, and ſerving by way of a fifth hand to
            hold by. Thoſe with muſcular holding tails, are called Sapajous; thoſe
            with feeble, uſeleſs tails, are called Sagoins. Of the ſapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jous there
            are five ſorts: of the ſagoins there are ſix.</p>
               <p>The firſt of the ſapajous is the Warine, or 
            <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0823900104:306"/> the Brazilian Guariba. This monkey is as large as a fox,
            with black long hair, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for the loudneſs of its voice. It is
            the largeſt of the monkey kind to be found in America.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the Coaiti; which may be diſtingtuiſhed from
            the reſt, by having no thumb, and, conſequently, but four fingers on the
            two fore paws. The tail, however, ſupplies the defects of the hand; and with
            this the animal ſlings itſelf from one tree to another, with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
            rapidity.</p>
               <p>The third is the Sajou; diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the
            ſapajous, by its yellowiſh, fleſh-coloured face.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the Sai. It is ſomewhat larger than the ſajou,
            and has a broader muzzle. It is called alſo the Bewailer; from its peculiar
            manner of lamenting, when either threatened or beaten.</p>
               <p>The fifth and laſt of the ſapajou kind, or monkies that hold
            by the tail, is the Samiri, or Aurora; which is the ſmalleſt and the moſt
            beautiful of all. It is of a fine orange colour, with two circles of fleſh
            round the eyes. It is a very tender, delicate animal, and held in high
            price.</p>
               <p>Of the ſagoins with feeble tails, there are ſix 
            <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0823900104:307"/> kinds. The firſt and the largeſt, is the Saki, or
            Cagui; ſo remarkable for the length of the hair on its tail, that it has been
            often termed the Fox-Tailed Monkey. It is of different ſizes; ſome being
            twice as large as others.</p>
               <p>The ſecond of this kind is the Tamaim; which is uſually black,
            with the feet yellow. Some, however, are found all over brown, ſpotted with
            yellow.</p>
               <p>The third is the Wiſtiti; remarkable for the large tufts of hair
            upon its face, and its annulated tail.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the Marikina; with a mane round the neck, and a
            bunch of hair at the end of the tail, like a lion.</p>
               <p>The fifth is called the Pinch; with the face of a beautiful black,
            and white hair that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends on each ſide of the face, like that of
            man.</p>
               <p>The laſt, leaſt, and moſt beautiful of all, is the Mico, an
            animal too curiouſly adorned, not to demand a particular deſcription; which
            is thus given of it, by Mr. Condamine. 
            <q rend="inline">"That," ſays he, "which the governor of Para
              made me a preſent of, was the only one of its kind that was ſeen in the
              country. The hair on its body was of a beautiful ſilver colour, brighter than
              that of the moſt venerable human hair: <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0823900104:308"/> while the tail
              was of a deep brown, inclining to blackneſs. It had another ſingularity,
              more remarkable than the former; its ears, its cheeks, and lips, were tinctured
              with ſo bright a vermil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, that one could ſcarce be led to ſuppoſe
              that it was natural. I kept it a year; and it was ſtill alive when I made
              this deſcription of it, almoſt within ſight of the coaſts of France:
              all I could then do, was to preſerve it in ſpirits of wine, which might
              ſerve to keep it in ſuch a ſtate, as to ſhew that I did not in the
              leaſt exaggerate in my deſcription."</q>

               <head>OF THE MAKI.</head>
               <p>THE laſt of the monkey kind are the Makies; which have no other
            pretenſions to be placed in this claſs, except that of having hands like
            the former, and making uſe of them to climb trees, or to pluck their food.
            Animals of the hare kind, indeed, are often ſeen to feed themſelves with
            their fore paws, but they can hold nothing in one of them ſingly, and are
            obliged to take up whatever they eat in both at once: but it is otherwiſe
            with the maki; as well as the monkey kinds, they ſeize their food with one
            hand, pretty much like a man, and graſp it with great eaſe and firmneſs.

            varying from each other in colour or ſize, but agreeing in the human-like
            figure of their hands and feet, and in their long noſe, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
            reſembles that of a dog. As moſt of theſe are bred in the depths of the
            foreſt, we know little more concerning them than their figure. Their way of
            living, their power of purſuit and eſcape, can only be ſuppoſed, from
            the analogy of their conformation, ſomewhat to reſemble thoſe of the
            monkey.</p>
               <p>The firſt of this kind is the Mococo; a beautiful animal, about
            the ſize of a common cat, but the body and limbs ſlenderer, and of a longer
            make. It has a very long tail, at leaſt double the length of its body; it is
            covered with fur, and marked alternately with broad rings of black and white.
            But what it is chiefly remarkable for, beſides the form of its hands and
            feet, is the largeneſs of its eyes, which are ſurrounded with a broad black
            ſpace; and the length of the hinder legs, which by far exceed <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:311"/>

            before. When it ſleeps, it brings its noſe to its belly, and its tail over
            its head. When it plays, it uſes a ſort of galloping, with its tail
            raiſed over its back, which keeps continually in motion. The head is covered
            with dark aſh-coloured hair; the back and ſides, with a red aſh-colour,
            and not ſo dark as on the head; and the whole, gloſſy, ſoft and
            de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, ſmooth to the touch, and ſtanding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt upright, like the
            pile of velvet. It is a native of Madagaſcar; appears to be an harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
            gentle animal; and though it reſembles the monkey in many reſpects, it has
            neither its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice nor its miſchief: nevertheleſs, like the monkey, it
            ſeems to be always in motion; and moves, like all four-handed animals, in an
            oblique direction.</p>
               <p>A ſecond of this kind, which is alſo a native of Madagaſcar,
            is the Mongooz; which is leſs than the former; with a ſoft, gloſſy
            robe, but a little curled. The noſe alſo is thicker than that of the
            mococo; the eyes are black, with orange-coloured circles round the pupil; and
            the tail is of one uniform colour. As to the reſt, it is found of various
            colours; ſome being black, others brown; and its actions ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
            reſemble thoſe of a monkey.</p>
               <p>The Vari is much larger than either of the <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0823900104:314"/>
            former; its hair is much longer, and it has a kind of ruff round the neck,
            conſiſting of very long hair, by which it may be eaſily
            diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the reſt. It differs alſo in its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
            which is fierce and ſavage; as alſo in the loudneſs of its voice, which
            ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the roaring of the lion. This alſo is a native of
            Madagaſcar.</p>
               <p>To this tribe we may refer a little four-handed animal, of the
            iſland of Ceylon, which Mr. Buffon calls the Lori; very remarkable for the
            ſingularity of its figure. This is, of all other animals, the longeſt, in
            proportion to its ſize; having nine vertebrae in the loins; whereas other
            quadrupedes have only ſeven<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. The body appears ſtill the longer, by having no tail.
            In other reſpects, it reſembles thoſe of the maki kind; as well in its
            hands and feet, as in its ſnout, and in the gloſſy qualities of its hair.
            It is about the ſize of a ſquirrel; and appears to be a tame, harmleſs

               <p>TO theſe four-handed animals of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient continent, we may
            add the four-handed <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0823900104:315"/> animals of the new, that uſe their
            hands like the former, as well as their tails, and that fill up the chaſm
            between the monkey tribe and the lower orders of the foreſt. As the maki kind
            in ſome meaſure ſeem to unite the fox and the monkey in their figure and
            ſize, ſo theſe ſeem to unite the monkey and the rat. They are all
            leſs than the former; they have long tails, almoſt bare of hair; and their
            fur, as well as their ſhape, ſeems to place them near the rat kind. Some
            have accordingly ranked them in that claſs; but their being four-handed, is a
            ſufficient reaſon for placing them in the rear of the monkies.</p>
               <p>The firſt and the moſt remarkable of this tribe is the
            Oppoſſum, an animal found both in North and South America, of the ſize of
            a ſmall cat. The head reſembles that of a fox; it has fifty teeth in all;
            but two great ones in the midſt, like thoſe of a rat. The eyes are little,
            round, clear, lively, and placed upright; the ears are long, broad, and
            tranſparent, like thoſe of the rat kind; its tail alſo encreaſes the
            ſimilitude, being round, long, a little hairy in the beginning, but quite
            naked towards the end. The fore legs are ſhort, being about three inches
            long; while thoſe behind are about four. The feet are like hands, each having

            toes or fingers, with white crooked nails, and rather longer behind than
            before. But it is particular in this animal, that the thumb on the hinder legs
            wants a nail; whereas the fingers are furniſhed with clawed nails as
            uſual.</p>
               <p>But that which diſtinguiſhes this animal from all others, and
            what has excited the wonder of mankind for more than two centuries, is the
            extraordinary conformation of its belly, as it is found to have a falſe womb,
            into which the young, when brought forth in the uſual manner, creep, and
            continue for ſome days longer, to lodge and ſuckle ſecurely. This bag, if
            we may ſo call it, being one of the moſt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary things in natural
            hiſtory, requires a more minute deſcription. Under the belly of the female
            is a kind of ſlit or opening, of about three inches long; this opening is
            compoſed of a ſkin, which makes a bag internally, which is covered on the
            inſide with hair, and in this bag are the teats of the female; and into it
            the young, when brought forth, retire, either to ſuckle or to eſcape from
            danger. This bag has a power of opening and ſhutting, at the will of the
            ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; and this is performed by means of ſeveral muſcles, and two bones,
            that are fitted for this purpoſe, and that are peculiar to this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal 
            <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0823900104:320"/> only. Theſe two bones are placed before the os pubis,
            to which they are joined at the baſe; they are about two inches long, and
            grow ſmaller and ſmaller to their extremities. Theſe ſupport the
            muſcles that ſerve to open the bag, and give them a fixture To theſe
            muſcles there are antagoniſts, that ſerve, in the ſame manner, to
            ſhut the bag; and this they perform ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, that in the living animal
            the opening can ſcarce be diſcerned, except when the ſides are forcibly
            drawn aſunder. The inſide of this bag is furniſhed with glands, that
            exſude a muſky ſubſtance, which communicates to the fleſh of the
            animal, and renders, it unfit to be eaten. It is not to be ſuppoſed that
            this is the place where the young are conceived, as ſome have been led to
            imagine; for the oppoſſum has another womb, like that of the generality of
            animals, in which generation is performed in the ordinary manner. The bag we
            have been deſcribing, may rather be conſidered as a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental womb.
            In the real womb, the little animal is partly brought to perfection; in the
            ordinary one, it receives a kind of additional, incubation; and acquires, at
            laſt, ſtrength enough to follow the dam wherever ſhe goes. We have many
            reaſons to ſuppoſe that the <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0823900104:321"/> young of this animal
            are all brought forth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturely, or before they have acquired that degree of
            perfection, which is common in other quadrupedes. The little ones, when firſt
            produced, are in a manner but half com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted; and ſome travellers
            aſſert, that they are, at that time, not much larger than flies. We are
            aſſured alſo, that immediately on quitting the real womb, they creep into
            the falſe one; where they continue fixed to the teat, until they have
            ſtrength ſufficient to venture once more into the open air, and ſhare the
            fatigues of the parent. Ulloa aſſures us, that he has found five of theſe
            little creatures hidden in the belly of the dam three days after ſhe was
            dead, ſtill alive, and all clinging to the teat with great avidity. It is
            probable, therefore, that upon their firſt entering the falſe womb, they
            ſeldom ſtir out from thence; but when more advanced, they venture forth
            ſeveral times in the day; and, at laſt, ſeldom make uſe of their
            retreat, except in caſes of neceſſity or danger. Travellers are not
            agreed in their accounts of the time which theſe animals take to continue in
            the falſe womb; ſome aſſure us, they remain there for ſeveral weeks;
            and others, more preciſely mention a month. During this <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0823900104:322"/> period of ſtrange geſtation, there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in opening
            the bag in which they are concealed; they may be reckoned, examined, and
            handled, without much inconvenience; for they keep fixed to the teat, and cling
            there as firm as if they made a part of the body of the animal that bears them.
            When they are grown ſtronger, they drop from the teat into the bag in which
            they are contained; and, at laſt, find their way out, in ſearch of more
            copious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. Still, however, the falſe belly ſerves them for
            a retreat; either when they want to ſleep or to ſuckle, or when they are
            purſued by an enemy. The dam, on ſuch occaſions, opens her bag to receive
            them, which they enter,

               <p>The Oppoſſum, when on the ground, is a ſlow, helpleſs
            animal; the formation of its hands, are alone ſufficient to ſhew its
            incapacity of running with any degree of ſwiftneſs: but, to counterbalance
            this inconvenience, it climbs trees with great eaſe and expedition<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Buffon, vol. xxi. p. 174.</bibl>
                  </note>. It chiefly
            ſubſiſts upon birds; and hides among the leaves of the trees, to ſeize
            them by ſurprize. It often alſo hangs by the tail, which is long and 
            <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0823900104:323"/> muſcular; and, in this ſituation, for hours
            to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with the head downwards, it keeps watching for its prey. If any
            leſſer animal, which it is able to overcome, paſſes underneath, it
            drops upon it with deadly aim, and quickly devours it. By means of its tail,
            the oppoſſum alſo ſlings from one tree to another, hunts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects,
            eſcapes its purſuers, and provides for its ſafety. It ſeems to be a
            creature that lives upon vegetables, as well as animal ſubſtances, roots,
            ſugar-canes, the bark, and even the leaves of trees. It is eaſily tamed,
            but it is a diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able domeſtic, as well from its ſtupidity and
            figure, as its ſcent, which, however fragrant in ſmall quantities, fails
            not to be ungrateful when copiouſly ſupplied.</p>

            which is found in the ſame continent. It ſeems only to differ in ſize,
            be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs; and, inſtead of a bag to receive its young, has only two
            longitudinal folds near the thighs, within which, the young, which are
            prematurely brought forth, as in the laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, continue to ſuckle.
            The young of theſe, when firſt produced, are not above the ſize of a
            bean; but continue ſticking to the <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0823900104:324"/> teat, until they
            have arrived at greater matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>The Cayopolin is ſomewhat larger than the former; and a good
            deal reſembling it in habits and figure, except that its ſnout is more
            pointed, its tail longer in proportion, and its colour different, being of an
            aſh, ſomewhat inclining to yellow; however, I ſhould ſuppoſe it to be
            only a variety of the former.</p>
               <p>To this number we may add the Phalanger, ſo called by Mr.
            Buffon; a good deal reſembling the former, but diſtinguiſhed by the
            faſhion of its hinder hands: the thumb and the fore finger being joined
            together, except at the extremities. This animal is about the ſize of a rat;
            and has, accordingly, by ſome, been called the Rat of Surinam.</p>
               <p>The laſt animal of this claſs is called, by Mr. Buffon, the
            Tarſier. This extraordinary little animal reſembles the former, in having
            four hands, and a long tail; but it differs very much in the extreme length of
            its hinder legs, which are longer than the reſt of its whole body. The bones
            of that part of the foot called the Tarſus, are likewiſe ſo very long,
            that from thence the animal has received its name: the tail is naked in the

               <p>From this general deſcription of four-handed animals, we
            perceive what few advantages the brute creation derive from thoſe organs
            that, in man, are employed to ſo many great and uſeful purpoſes. The
            being able to pluck their food from the trees, the capacity of clinging among
            the branches, or at moſt of converting one of thoſe branches into a weapon
            of offence, are the higheſt ſtretches of their ſagacity, and the only
            uſe their hands have hitherto been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in: and yet, ſome
            ſuperficial men have aſſerted, that the hands alone are ſufficient to
            vindicate the dominion of mankind over other animals; and that much of his
            boaſted reaſon, is nothing more than the reſult of his happier
            conformation: however, were this ſo, an ape or a monkey would in ſome
            inſtances be more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional than we; their fingers are ſmaller, and, in
            ſome of them, more finely formed than ours. To what a variety of purpoſes
            might they not be employed, if their powers were properly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted! Thoſe
            works which we, from the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0823900104:330"/> of our fingers,
            are obliged to go clumſily about, one of theſe could very eaſily perform
            with the utmoſt exactneſs; and if the fineneſs of the hand aſſiſted
            reaſon, an ape would be one of the moſt reaſonable beings in the
            creation. But theſe admirably formed machines, are almoſt uſeleſs both
            to mankind and themſelves; and contribute little more to the happineſs of
            animal life, than the paws of the loweſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupede. They are ſupplied,
            indeed, with the organs; but they want the mind, to put them into action: it is
            that reaſoning principle alone, with which man has been endowed, that can
            adapt ſeemingly oppoſite cauſes, to concur in the ſame general
            deſign; and even where the organs are deficient, that can ſupply their
            place, by the intervention of aſſiſting inſtruments. Where reaſon
            prevails, we find that it ſcarcely matters what the organs are that give it
            the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; the being furniſhed with that principle, ſtill goes
            forward, ſteadily and uniformly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful; breaks through every
            obſtacle, and becomes maſter of every enterprize. I have ſeen a man,
            without hands or legs, convert, by practice, his very ſtumps to the moſt
            conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient purpoſes; and with theſe clumſy inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, perform the
            moſt aſtoniſhing feats of <pb n="251" facs="tcp:0823900104:331"/> dexterity. We may
            therefore, conclude, that it is the mind alone that gives a maſter to the
            creation; and that, if a bear or an horſe were endowed with the ſame
            intelects that have been given to man, the hardneſs of an hoof, or the
            aukwardneſs of a paw, would be no obſtacle to their advancement in the arts
            of dominion, or of ſocial felicity.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the Elephant.</head>
            <p>HAVING gone through the deſcription of thoſe quadrupedes that,
          by reſembling each other in ſome ſtriking particular, admit of being
          grouped together and conſidered under one point of view, we now come to
          thoſe inſulated ſorts that bear no ſimilitude with the reſt, and that
          to be diſtinctly deſcribed muſt be ſeparately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
            <p>The foremoſt of theſe, and in every reſpect the nobleſt
          quadrupede in nature, is the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, not leſs remarkable for its ſize
          than its docility and underſtanding. All hiſtorians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in giving it
          the character of the moſt ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious animal next to man; and yet, were we
          to take our idea of its capacity from its outward appearance, we ſhould be
          led to conceive very meanly of its abilities. The elephant, at firſt view,
          preſents the ſpectator with an enormous maſs of fleſh that ſeems
          ſcarcely animated. Its huge body, covered with a callous hide, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hair;
          its large miſ-ſhapen legs, that ſeem ſcarcely formed for motion; its
          little eyes, large ears, and long trunk; all give it an air of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
          ſtupidity. But our prejudices will ſoon <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:333"/>

          ſubſide when we come to examine its hiſtory; they will even ſerve to
          encreaſe our ſurprize when we conſider the various advantages it derives
          from ſo clumſy a conformation.</p>
            <p>The elephant is ſeen from ſeven to no leſs than fifteen feet
          high. Whatever care we take to imagine a large animal beforehand, yet the
          firſt ſight of this huge creature never fails to ſtrike us with
          aſtoniſhment, and in ſome meaſure to exceed our idea. Having been
          uſed to ſmaller animals, we have ſcarce any conception of its magnitude;
          for a moving column of fleſh, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen feet high, is an object ſo utterly
          different from thoſe we are conſtantly preſented with, that to be
          conceived it muſt be actually ſeen. Such, I own, were the ſuggeſtions
          that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally aroſe to me when I firſt ſaw this animal, and yet for the
          ſight of which I had taken care to prepare my imagination. I found my ideas
          fall as ſhort of its real ſize as they did of its real figure; neither the
          pictures I had ſeen, nor the deſcriptions I had read, giving me adequate
          conceptions of either.</p>
            <p>It would, therefore, be impoſſible to give an idea of this
          animal's figure by a deſcription; which, even aſſiſted by the art of
          the engraver, will but confuſedly repreſent the original. In general it may
          be obſerved, that the forehead is <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0823900104:337"/> very high and
          riſing, the ears very large and dependant, the eyes extremely ſmall, the
          pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſcis, or trunk, long, the body round and full, the back riſing in an
          arch, and the whole ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſhort in proportion to its height. The feet are
          round at the bottom; on each foot there are five flat horny riſings, which
          ſeem to be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the toes, but do not appear out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. The
          hide is without hair, full of ſcratches and ſcars, which it receives in its
          paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through thick woods and thorny places. At the end of the tail
          there is a tuft of hair, a foot and a half long. The female is leſs than the
          male, and the udder is between the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legs. But a more accurate, as well as a
          more entertaining deſcription of the parts, will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally occur in the
          hiſtory of their uſes.</p>
            <p>Of all quadrupedes, the elephant is the ſtrongeſt, as well as
          the largeſt; and yet, in a ſtate of nature, it is neither fierce nor
          for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable<note n="*" place="bottom">I have extracted the greateſt part of
            this deſcription from Mr. Buffon. Where I add, I mark with commas,
            "thus."</note>. Mild, peaceful, and brave, it never abuſes its power or its
          ſtrength, and only uſes its force for its own protection, or that of its
          community. In its native deſarts, the elephant is ſeldom ſeen alone, but
          appears to be a ſocial <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0823900104:338"/> friendly creature. The oldeſt
          of the company conducts the band; that which is next in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niority brings up
          the rear. The young, the weak, and the ſickly, fall into the center; while
          the females carry their young, and keep them from falling by means of their
          trunks. They maintain this order only in dangerous marches, or when they
          deſire to feed in cultivated grounds; they move with leſs precaution in the
          foreſts and ſolitudes; but without ever ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or removing ſo far
          aſunder as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of lending each other any requiſite
          aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Nothing can be more formidable than a drove of elephants as
          they appear at a diſtance in an African landſcape; wherever they march, the
          foreſt ſeems to fail before them; in their paſſage, they bear down the
          branches upon which they feed; and, if they enter into an incloſure, they
          deſtroy all the labours of the huſbandman in a very ſhort time. Their
          in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions are the more diſagreeable as there is no means of repelling
          them; ſince it would require a ſmall army to attack the whole drove when
          united. It now and then happens that one or two is found lingering behind the
          reſt, and it is againſt theſe that the art and force of the hunters are
          united; but an attempt to moleſt the whole body would certainly be fatal.
          They <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0823900104:339"/> go forward directly againſt him who offers the
          inſult, ſtrike him with their tuſks, ſeize him with their trunks, fling
          him into the air, and then trample him to pieces under their feet. But they are
          thus dreadful only when offended, and do no manner of perſonal injury when
          ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to feed without interruption. It is even ſaid that they are
          mindful of injuries received; and, when once moleſted by man, ſeek all
          oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions for the future to be revenged; they ſmell him with their long
          trunks at a diſtance; follow him with all their ſpeed upon the ſcent;
          and, though ſlow to appearance, they are ſoon able to come up with and
          deſtroy him.</p>
            <p>In their natural ſtate, they delight to live along the ſides of
          rivers, to keep in the deepeſt vales, to refreſh themſelves in the moſt
          ſhady foreſts and watery places. They cannot live far from the water; and
          they always diſturb it before they drink. They often fill their trunk with
          it, either to cool that organ, or to divert themſelves by ſpurting it out
          like a fountain. They are equally diſtreſſed by the extremes of heat and
          cold; and, to avoid the former, they frequently take ſhelter in the moſt
          obſcure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the foreſt, or often plunge into the water, and
          even ſwim from the continent into iſlands ſome leagues diſtant from the
          ſhore.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0823900104:342"/>Their chief food is of the vegetable kind, for
          they loath all kind of animal diet. When one among their number happens to
          light upon a ſpot of good paſture, he calls the reſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites them
          to ſhare in the entertainment; but it muſt be a very copious paſture
          indeed that can ſupply the neceſſities of the whole band. As with their
          broad and heavy feet they ſink deep wherever they go, they deſtroy much
          more than they devour; ſo that they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obliged to change their
          quarters, and to migrate from one country to another. The Indians and Negroes,
          who are often incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded by ſuch viſitants, do all they can to keep them
          away, making loud noiſes, and large fires round their cultivated grounds; but
          theſe precautions do not always ſucceed; the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants often break through
          their fences, deſtroy their whole harveſt, and overturn their little
          habitations. When they have ſatisfied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and trod down or
          devoured whatever lay in their way, they then retreat into the woods in the
          ſame orderly manner in which they made their irruption.</p>
            <p>Such are the habits of this animal conſidered in a ſocial light;
          and, if we regard it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, we ſhall find its powers ſtill more
          ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. With a very aukward appearance, <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:343"/>

               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0823900104:345"/> it
          poſſeſſes all the ſenſes in great perfection, and is capable of
          applying them to more uſeful purpoſes than any other quadrupede. The
          elephant, as we obſerved, has very ſmall eyes, when compared to the
          enormous bulk of its body. But, though their minuteneſs may at firſt
          ſight appear deformed, yet, when we come to examine them, they are ſeen to
          exhibit a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of expreſſion, and to diſcover the various
          ſenſations with which it is moved. It turns them with attention and
          friendſhip to its maſter; it ſeems to reflect and deliberate; and as its
          paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſlowly ſucced each other, their various workings are
          diſtinctly ſeen.</p>
            <p>The elephant is not leſs remarkable for the excellence of its
          hearing. Its ears are extremely large, and greater in proportion than even
          thoſe of an aſs. They are uſually dependent; but it can readily raiſe
          and move them. They ſerve alſo to wipe its eyes, and to protect them
          againſt the duſt and flies that might otherwiſe incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode them. It
          appears delighted with muſic, and very readily learns to beat time, to move
          in meaſure, and even to join its voice to the ſound of the drum and the
          trumpet.</p>
            <p>This animal's ſenſe of ſmelling is not only exquiſite, but
          it is in a great meaſure pleaſed with the ſame odours that delight
          mankind. <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0823900104:346"/> The elephant gathers flowers with great
          plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and attention; it picks them up one by one, unites them into a
          noſegay, and ſeems charmed with the perfume. The orange flower ſeems to
          be particularly grateful both to its ſenſe of taſte and ſmelling; it
          ſtrips the tree of all its verdure, and eats every part of it, even to the
          branches themſelves. It ſeeks in the meadows the moſt odoriferous plants
          to feed upon; and in the woods it prefers the coco, the banana, the palm, and
          the ſago tree, to all others. As the ſhoots of theſe are tender and
          filled with pith; it eats not only the leaves and the fruits, but even the
          branches, the trunk, and the whole plant to the very roots.</p>
            <p>But it is in the ſenſe of touching that this animal excels all
          others of the brute creation, and perhaps even man himſelf. The organ of this
          ſenſe lies wholly in the trunk, which is an inſtrument peculiar to this
          animal, and that ſerves it for all the purpoſes of an hand. The trunk is,
          properly ſpeaking, only the ſnout lengthened out to a great extent, hollow
          like a pipe, and ending in two openings, or noſtrils, like thoſe of an hog.
          An elephant of fourteen feet high has the trunk about eight feet long and five
          feet and an half in circumference at the mouth, where it is thickeſt. It is
          hollow <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0823900104:347"/> all along, but with a partition running from one
          end of it to the other; ſo that though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly it appears like a ſingle
          pipe, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly divided into two. This fleſhy tube is compoſed of
          nerves and muſcles, covered with a proper ſkin of a blackiſh colour, like
          that of the reſt of the body. It is capable of being moved in every
          direction, of being lengthened and ſhortened, of being bent or
          ſtreightened, ſo pliant as to embrace any body it is applied to, and yet
          ſo ſtrong that nothing can be torn from the gripe. To aid the force of this
          graſp, there are ſeveral little eminences, like a cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar's feet, on
          the underſide of this inſtrument, which without doubt contribute to the
          ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of the touch as well as to the firmneſs of the hold. Through
          this trunk the animal breathes, drinks, and ſmells, as through a tube; and at
          the very point of it, juſt above the noſtrils, there is an extenſion of
          the ſkin, about five inches long, in the form of a finger, and which in fact
          anſwers all the purpoſes of one; for, with the reſt of the extremity of
          the trunk, it is capable of aſſuming different forms at will, and
          conſequently of being adapted to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteſt objects. By means of this,
          the elephant can take a pin from the ground, untie the knots of a rope, unlock
          a door, and even write with <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0823900104:348"/> a pen. 
          <q rend="inline">"I have myſelf ſeen," ſays Aelian, "an
            elephant writing Latin characters on a board, in a very orderly manner, his
            keeper only ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the figure of each letter. While thus employed, the
            eyes might be obſerved ſtudiouſly caſt down upon the writing, and
            exhibiting an appearance of great ſkill and erudition."</q> It ſometimes
          happens that the object is too large for the trunk to graſp; in ſuch a
          caſe the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant makes uſe of another expedient as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable as any of
          the former. It applies the extremity of the trunk to the ſurface of the
          object, and, ſucking up its breath, lifts and ſuſtains ſuch a weight as
          the air in that caſe is capable of keeping ſuſpended. In this manner this
          inſtrument is uſeful in moſt of the purpoſes of life; it is an organ of
          ſmelling, of touching, and of ſuction; it not only provides for the
          animal's neceſſities and comforts, but it alſo ſerves for its ornament
          and defence.</p>
            <p>But, though the elephant be thus admirably ſupplied by its trunk,
          yet, with reſpect to the reſt of its conformation, it is unwieldy and
          help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. The neck is ſo ſhort that it can ſcarce turn the head, and
          muſt wheel round in order to diſcover an enemy from behind. The hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
          that attack it upon that quarter, generally thus eſcape the effects of its
          indignation; and <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0823900104:349"/> find time to renew their aſſaults
          while the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant is turning to face them The legs are, indeed, not ſo
          inflexible as the neck, yet they are very ſtiff and bend not without
          difficulty. Thoſe before ſeem to be longer than the hinder; but, upon being
          meaſured, are found to be ſomething ſhorter. The joints, by which they
          bend, are nearly in the middle, like the knee of a man; and the great bulk
          which they are to ſupport makes their flexure ungainly. While the elephant is
          young, it bends the legs to lie down or to riſe; but when it grows old, or
          ſickly, this is not performed without human aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; and it
          becomes, conſequently, ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, that the animal chuſes to
          ſleep ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The feet, upon which theſe maſſy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns are
          ſupported; form a baſe ſcarce broader than the legs they ſuſtain.
          They are divided into five toes, which are covered beneath the ſkin, and none
          of which appear to the eye; a kind of protuberance like claws are only
          ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, which vary in number from three to five. The apparent claws vary;
          the internal toes are conſtantly the ſame. The ſoal of the foot is
          furniſhed with a ſkin as thick and hard as horn, and which completely
          covers the whole under part of the foot.</p>
            <p>To the reſt of the elephant's incumbrances may 
          <pb n="263" facs="tcp:0823900104:350"/> be added its enormous tuſks, which are
          unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable for chewing, and are only weapons of defence. Theſe, as the
          animal grows old, become ſo heavy, that it is ſometimes obliged to make
          holes in the walls of its ſtall to reſt them in, and eaſe itſelf of the
          fatigue of their ſupport. It is well known to what an amazing ſize theſe
          tuſks grow; they are two in number, proceeding from the upper jaw, and are
          ſometimes found above ſix feet long. Some have ſuppoſed them to be
          rather the horns than the teeth of this animal; but, beſides their greater
          ſimilitude to bone than to horn, they have been indiſputably found to grow
          from the upper jaw, and not from the frontal bones, as ſome have thought
          proper to aſſert<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Daubenton's deſcription
            of the ſkeleton of this animal.</note>. Some alſo have aſſerted, that
          theſe tuſks are ſhed in the ſame manner as the ſtag ſheds its
          horns; but it is very probable, from their ſolid conſiſtence, and from
          their accidental defects, which often appears to be the effect of a ſlow
          decay, that they are as fixt as the teeth of other animals are generally found
          to be. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that the elephant never ſheds them in a domeſtic
          ſtate, but keeps them till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inconvenient and cumbrous to the
          laſt degree. An account of uſes to which theſe <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0823900104:351"/>
          teeth are applied, and the manner of chuſing the beſt ivory, belongs rather
          to an hiſtory of the arts than of nature.</p>
            <p>This animal is equally ſingular in other parts of its
          conformation; the lips and the tongue in other creatures ſerve to ſuck up
          and direct their drink or their food; but in the elephant they are totally
          inconvenient for ſuch purpoſes; and it not only gathers its food with its
          trunk, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies itſelf with water by the ſame means. When it eats
          hay, as I have ſeen it frequently, it takes up a ſmall wiſp of it with
          the trunk, turns and ſhapes it with that inſtrument for ſome time, and
          then directs it into the mouth, where it is chewed by the great grinding teeth,
          that are large in proportion to the bulk of the animal. This pacquet, when
          chewed, is ſwallowed, and never ruminated again as in cows or ſheep, the
          ſtomach and inteſtines of this creature more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling thoſe of an
          horſe. Its manner of drinking is equally extraordinary. For this purpoſe,
          the elephant dips the end of its trunk into the water, and ſucks up juſt as
          much as fills that great fleſhy tube compleatly. It then lifts up its head
          with the trunk full, and turning the point into its mouth, as if it intended to
          ſwallow trunk and all, it drives the point below the opening of the
          wind-pipe. The trunk being <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0823900104:352"/> in this poſition and
          ſtill full of water, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant then blows ſtrongly into it at the other
          end, which forces the water it contains into the throat, down which it is heard
          to pour with a loud gurgling noiſe, which continues till the whole is blown
          down. From this manner of drinking, ſome have been led into an opinion that
          the young elephant ſucks with its trunk and not with its mouth; this,
          however, is a fact which no traveller has hitherto had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of
          ſeeing, and it muſt be referred to ſome future accident to determine.</p>
            <p>The hide of the elephant is as remarkable as any other part. It is
          not covered over with hair as in the generality of quadrupedes, but is nearly
          bare. Here and there indeed, a few briſtles are ſeen growing in the ſcars
          and wrinkles of the body, and very thinly ſcattered over the reſt of the
          ſkin; but in general the head is dry, rough, and wrinkled, and reſembling
          more the bark of an old tree than the ſkin of an animal. This grows thicker
          every year; and, by a conſtant addition of ſubſtance, it at length
          contracts that diſorder well known by the name of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantiaſis, or
          Arabian leproſy; a diſeaſe to which man, as well as the elephant, is
          often ſubject. In order to prevent this, the Indians rub the elephant with
          oil, and frequently bathe <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0823900104:353"/> it to preſerve its pliancy.
          To the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of this diſorder is added another, ariſing from the
          great ſenſibility of thoſe parts that are not callous. Upon theſe the
          flies ſettle in great abundance, and torment this animal unceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; to
          remedy which, the elephant tries all its arts; uſes not only its tail and
          trunk in the natural manner to keep them off, but even takes the branch of a
          tree, or a bundle of hay, to ſtrike them off with. When this fails, it often
          gathers up the duſt with its trunk, and thus covers all the ſenſible
          places. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it has been ſeen to duſt itſelf ſeveral times a
          day, and particularly upon leaving the bath.</p>
            <p>Water is as neceſſary to this animal as food itſelf. When in a
          ſtate of nature, the elephant rarely quits the banks of the river, and often
          ſtands in water up to the belly. In a ſtate of ſervitude, the Indians
          take equal care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a proper ſupply; they waſh it with great
          addreſs; they give it all the conveniences for lending aſſiſtance to
          itſelf; they ſmooth the ſkin with a pumice ſtone, and then rub it over
          with oils, eſſences, and odours.</p>
            <p>It is not to be wondered at that an animal furniſhed with ſo
          many various advantages, both of ſtrength, ſagacity, and obedience,
          ſhould be taken into the ſervice of man. We accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly 
          <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0823900104:354"/> find that the elephant, from time immemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, has been
          employed either for the purpoſes of labour, of war, or of oſtentation; to
          encreaſe the grandeur of eaſtern princes, or to extend their dominions. We
          have hitherto been deſcribing this animal in its natural ſtate; we now come
          to conſider it in a different view, as taken from the foreſt and reduced to
          human obedience. We are now to behold this brave harmleſs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as
          learning a leſſon from mankind, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by him in all the arts of
          war, maſſacre, and devaſtation. We are now to behold this half
          reaſoning animal led into the field of battle, and wondering at thoſe
          tumults and that madneſs which he is compelled to encreaſe. The elephant is
          a native of Africa and Aſia, being found neither in Europe nor America. In
          Africa he ſtill retains his natural liberty. The ſavage inhabitants of that
          part of the world, inſtead of attempting to ſubdue this powerful creature
          to their neceſſities, are happy in being able to protect themſelves from
          his fary. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, indeed, during the ſplendour of the Carthaginian empire,
          elephants were uſed in their wars; but this was only a tranſitory gleam of
          human power in that part of the globe; the natives of Africa have long ſince
          degenerated, and the elephant is only known among them <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0823900104:355"/>
          from his devaſtations. However, there are no elephants in the northern parts
          of Africa at preſent, there being none found on this ſide of Mount Atlas.
          It is beyond the river Senegal that they are to be met with in great numbers,
          and ſo down to the Cape of Good Hope, as well as in the heart of the country.
          In this extenſive region they appear to be more numerous than in any other
          part of the world. They are there leſs fearful of man; leſs retired into
          the heart of the foreſts, they ſeem to be ſenſible of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence
          and ignorance; and often come down to ravage his little labours. They treat him
          with the ſame haughty diſdain which they ſhew to other animals, and
          conſider him as a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous little being, that fears to oppoſe them
          openly.</p>
            <p>But, although theſe animals are moſt plentiful in Africa, it is
          only in Aſia that the greateſt elephants are found, and rendered
          ſubſervient to human command. In Africa, the largeſt do not exceed ten
          feet high; in Aſia they are found from ten to fifteen. Their price
          en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes in proportion to their ſize; and when they exceed a certain
          bulk, like jewels, their value then riſes as the fancy is pleaſed to
          eſtimate.</p>
            <p>The largeſt are entirely kept for the ſervice 
          <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0823900104:256"/> of princes; and are maintained with the utmoſt
          magnificence, and at the greateſt expence. The uſual colour of the elephant
          is a duſky black, but ſome are ſaid to be white; and the price of one of
          theſe is ineſtimable. Such a one is peculiarly appropriated for the
          monarch's own riding; he is kept in a palace, attended by the nobles, and
          almoſt adored by the people<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>P. Vincent
              Marie.</bibl>
               </note>. Some have ſaid that theſe white elephants are larger
          than the reſt<note n="†" place="bottom">

               </note>;
          others aſſert, that they are leſs; and ſtill others entirely doubt
          their exiſtence.</p>
            <p>As the art of war is but very little improved in Aſia, there are
          few princes of the eaſt who do not procure and maintain as many elephants as
          they are able, and place great confidence on their aſſiſtance in an
          engagement. For this purpoſe, they are obliged to take them wild in their
          native foreſts, and tame them; for the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant never breeds in a ſtate of
          ſervitude. It is one of the moſt ſtriking peculiarities in this
          extraordinary creature, that his generative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers totally fail when he comes
          under the dominion of man; as if he ſeemed unwilling to propagate a race of
          ſlaves, to encreaſe the pride of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. There is, perhaps, no
          other quadrupede that will not breed in its own native climate, if 
          <pb n="270" facs="tcp:0823900104:357"/> indulged with a moderate ſhare of freedom; and we
          know, that many of them will copulate in every climate. The elephant alone has
          never been ſeen to breed; and though he has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced under the obedience
          of man for ages, the duration of pregnancy, in the female<note n="*" place="bottom">

          ſhe brings forth but one at a time: but he does not inform us of the manner
          in which it was poſſible for him to have his information. From authorities
          equally doubtful, we learn, that the little one is about as large as a wild
          boar, the inſtant it is brought forth; that its tuſks do not yet appear;
          but that all the reſt of its teeth are apparent; that, at the age of ſix
          months, it is as large as an ox, and its tuſks pretty well grown; and that it
          continues, in this manner, for near thirty years, advancing to maturity. All
          this is doubtful; but it is certain, that, in <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0823900104:358"/> order to
          recruit the numbers which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in war, the princes of the eaſt are
          every year obliged to ſend into the foreſts, and to uſe various methods
          to procure a freſh ſupply. Of all theſe numerous bands, there is not one
          that has not been originally wild; nor one that has not been forced into a
          ſtate of ſubjection. Men themſelves are often content to propagate a race
          of ſlaves, that paſs down in this wretched ſtate through ſucceſſive
          generations; but the elephant, under ſubjection, is unalterably bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren;
          perhaps from ſome phyſical cauſes, which are as yet unknown.</p>
            <p>The Indian princes having vainly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to multiply the breed
          of elephants, like that of other animals, have been, at laſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to
          ſeparate the males from the females, to prevent thoſe acceſſes of
          deſire, which debilitated, without multiplying the ſpecies. In order to
          take them wild in the woods, a ſpot of ground is fixed upon, which is
          ſurrounded with a ſtrong palliſade. This is made of the thickeſt and
          the ſtrongeſt trees; and ſtrengthened by croſs bars, which give
          firmneſs to the whole. The poſts are fixed at ſuch diſtances from each
          other, that a man can eaſily paſs between them; there being only one great
          paſſage left open, through which an elephant can eaſily come; and 
          <pb n="272" facs="tcp:0823900104:359"/> which is ſo contrived as to ſhut behind, as ſoon
          as the beaſt is entered. To draw him into this encloſure, it is
          neceſſary firſt to find him out in the woods; and a female elephant is
          conducted along into the heart of the foreſt, where it is obliged by its
          keeper to cry out for the male. The male very readily anſwers the cry, and
          haſtens to join her; which the keeper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, obliges her to retreat,
          ſtill repeating the ſame cry, until ſhe leads the animal into the
          encloſure already deſcribed, which ſhuts the moment he is entered. Still,
          however, the female proceeds calling, and inviting, while the male proceeds
          forward in the encloſure, which grows narrower all the way, and until the
          poor animal finds himſelf completely ſhut up, without the power of either
          advancing or retreating; the female, in the mean time, being let out by a
          private way, which ſhe has been previouſly accuſtomed to. The wild
          elephant, upon ſeeing himſelf entrapped in this manner, inſtantly
          attempts to uſe violence; and, upon ſeeing the hunters, all his former
          deſires only turn to fury. In the mean time, the hunters, having fixed him
          with cords, attempt to ſoften his indignation, by throwing buckets of water
          upon him in great quantities, rubbing the body with leaves, and pouring oil
          down his ears. Soon <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0823900104:360"/> after, two tame elephants are
          brought, a male and a female, that careſs the indignant animal with their
          trunks; while they ſtill continue pouring water to refreſh it. At laſt, a
          tame elephant is brought forward, of that number which is employed in
          inſtructing the new comers, and an officer riding upon it, in order to ſhew
          the late captive that it has nothing to fear. The hunters then open the
          encloſure; and, while this creature leads the captive along, two more are
          joined on either ſide of it, and theſe compel it to ſubmit. It is then
          tied by cords to a maſſy pillar provided for that purpoſe, and ſuffered
          to remain in that poſition for about a day and a night, until its indignation
          be wholly ſubſided. The next day it begins to be ſomewhat
          ſubmiſſive; and, in a fortnight, is completely tamed like the reſt. The
          females are taken when accompanying the males; they often come into theſe
          encloſures, and they ſhortly after ſerve as decoys to the reſt. But
          this method of taking the elephant, differs, according to the abilities of the
          hunter; the Negroes of Africa, who hunt this animal merely for its fleſh, are
          content to take it in pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls; and often to purſue it in the defiles of a
          mountain, where it cannot eaſily turn, and ſo wound it from behind till it
          falls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:0823900104:361"/>The elephant, when once tamed, becomes the
          moſt gentle and obedient of all animals. It ſoon conceives an attachment
          for the perſon that attends it, careſſes him, obeys him, and ſeems to
          anticipate his deſires. In a ſhort time it begins to comprehend ſeveral
          of the ſigns made to it, and even the different ſounds of the voice; it
          perfectly diſtinguiſhes the tone of command from that of anger or
          approbation, and it acts accordingly. It is ſeldom deceived in its maſter's
          voice; it receives his orders with attention, and executes them with prudence,
          eagerly, yet without precipitation. All its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are regulated; and its
          actions ſeem to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of its magnitude; being grave, majeſtic, and
          ſecure. It is quickly taught to kneel down, to receive its rider; it
          careſſes thoſe it knows with its trunk; with this ſalutes ſuch as it
          is ordered to diſtinguiſh, and with this, as with an hand, helps to take up
          a part of its load. It ſuffers itſelf to be arrayed in harneſs; and
          ſeems to take a pleaſure in the finery of its trappings. It draws either
          chariots, cannon, or ſhipping, with ſurprizing ſtrength and
          perſeverance; and this with a ſeeming ſatisfaction, provided that it be
          not beaten without a cauſe, and that its maſter appears pleaſed with its
          exertions.</p>
            <p>The elephant's conductor is uſually mounted <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0823900104:362"/>
          upon its neck, and makes uſe of a rod of iron to guide it, which is
          ſometimes pointed, and at others bent into a hook. With this the animal is
          ſpurred forward, when dull or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient; but, in general, a word is
          ſufficient to put the gentle creature into motion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it is
          acquainted with its conductor. This acquaintance is often perfectly
          neceſſary; for the elephant frequently takes ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to its
          keeper, that it will obey no other: and it has been known to die for grief,
          when, in ſome ſudden fit of madneſs, it has killed its conductor. We are
          told, that one of theſe, that was uſed by the French forces in India for
          the drawing their cannon, was promiſed, by the conductor, a reward, for
          having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſome painful ſervice; but being diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of its
          expectations, it ſlew him in a fury. The conductor's wife, who was a
          ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of this ſhocking ſcene, could not reſtrain her madneſs and
          deſpair; but running with her two children in her arms, threw them at the
          elephant's feet, crying out, that ſince it had killed her huſband, it might
          kill her and her children alſo. The elephant, ſeeing the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren at its
          feet, inſtantly ſtopped, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating its fury, took up the eldeſt
          with its trunk, and placing him upon its neck, adopted <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0823900104:363"/>
          him for its conductor, and obeyed him ever after with great punctuality.</p>
            <p>But it is not for drawing burthens alone, that the elephants are
          ſerviceable in war; they are often brought into the ranks, and compelled to
          fight in the moſt dangerous parts of the field of battle. There was a time,
          indeed, in India, when they were much more uſed in war than at preſent. A
          century or two ago, a great part of the dependance of the general, was upon the
          number and the expertneſs of his elephants; but of late, ſince war has been
          contented to adopt fatal inſtead of formidable arts, the elephant is little
          uſed, except for drawing cannon, or tranſporting proviſions. The princes
          of the country are pleaſed to keep a few for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or for the purpoſes
          of removing their ſeraglios: but they are ſeldom led into a field of
          battle, where they are unable to withſtand the diſcharge of fire-arms, and
          have been often found to turn upon their employers. Still, however, they are
          uſed in war, in the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of the eaſt; in Siam, in Cochin
          China, in Tonquin, and Pegu. In all theſe places, they not only ſerve to
          ſwell the pomp of ſtate, being adorned with all the barbarian ſplendour
          that thoſe countries can beſtow, but they are actually led into the field
          of battle, <pb n="277" facs="tcp:0823900104:364"/> armed before with coats of mail, and loaded
          on the back each with a ſquare tower, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from five combatants to
          ſeven. Upon its neck ſits the conductor, who goads the animal into the
          thickeſt ranks, and encourages it to encreaſe the devaſtation: wherever
          it goes, nothing can withſtand its fury; it lev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s the ranks with its immenſe bulk, flings ſuch as
          op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it into the air, or cruſhes them to death under its feet. In the
          mean time, thoſe who are placed upon its back, combat as from an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
          and fling down their weapons with double force, their weight being added to
          their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity. Nothing, therefore, can be more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or more
          irreſiſtible, than ſuch a moving machine, to men unacquainted with the
          modern arts of war; the elephant, thus armed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, raging in the
          midſt of a field of battle, inſpires more terror than even thoſe machines
          that deſtroy at a diſtance, and are often moſt fatal, when moſt
          unſeen. But this method of combating, is rather formidable than effectual:
          poliſhed nations have ever been victorious over thoſe ſemi-barbarous
          troops that have called in the elephant to their aſſiſtance, or attempted
          to gain a victory by merely aſtoniſhing their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers. The Romans
          quickly learned the art of opening their ranks, to admit the elephant; 
          <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0823900104:365"/> and thus ſeparating it from aſſiſtance, quickly
          compelled its conductors to calm the animal's fury, and to ſubmit. It
          ſometimes alſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that the elephant became impatient of control;
          and, inſtead of obeying its conductor, turned upon thoſe forces it was
          employed to aſſiſt. In either caſe, there was a great deal of
          preparation to very little effect; for a ſingle elephant is known to
          conſume as much as forty men in a day.</p>
            <p>At preſent, therefore, they are chiefly employed in carrying or
          drawing burthens, throughout the whole Peninſula of India; and no animal can
          be more fitted by nature for this employment. The ſtrength of an elephant is
          equal to its bulk, for it can, with great eaſe, draw a load that ſix
          horſes could not remove: it can readily carry upon its back three or four
          thouſand weight; upon its tuſks alone it can ſupport near a thouſand:
          its force may alſo be eſtimated from the velocity of its motion, compared
          to the maſs of its body. It can go, in its ordinary pace, as faſt as an
          horſe at an eaſy trot; and, when puſhed, it can move as ſwiftly as an
          horſe at full gallop. It can travel with eaſe fifty or ſixty miles a day;
          and when hard preſſed, almoſt double that quantity. It may be heard
          trotting on at a great diſtance; it <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0823900104:366"/> is eaſy alſo
          to follow it by the track, which is deeply impreſſed on the ground, and
          from fifteen to eighteen inches in diameter.</p>
            <p>In India they are alſo put to other very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable offices;
          for in ſome courts of the more barbarous princes, they are uſed as
          execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners; and this horrid taſk they perform with great dexterity: with
          their trunks they are ſeen to break every limb of the criminal at the word of
          command; they ſometimes trample him to death, and ſometimes impale him on
          their enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tuſks, as directed. In this the elephant is rather the
          ſervant of a cruel maſter, than a voluntary tyrant, ſince no other animal
          of the foreſt is ſo naturally benevolent and gentle; equally mindful of
          benefits as ſenſible of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, he contracts a friendſhip for his
          keeper, and obeys him even beyond his capacity.</p>
            <p>In India, where they were at one time em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in launching
          ſhips, a particular elephant was directed to force a very large veſſel
          into the water: the work proved ſuperior to its ſtrength, but not to its
          endeavours; which, however, the keeper affected to deſpiſe. 
          <q rend="inline">"Take away," ſays he, "that lazy beaſt, and
            bring another better fitted for ſervice."</q> The poor animal inſtantly
          upon this redoubled its efforts, fractured its ſcull, and died upon the
          ſpot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0823900104:367"/>In Deli, an elephant, paſſing along the
          ſtreets, put his trunk into a taylor's ſhop, where ſeveral people were at
          work. One of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the ſhop, deſirous of ſome amuſement,
          pricked the animal's trunk with his needle, and ſeemed highly delighted with
          this ſlight pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. The elephant, however, paſſed on without any
          immediate ſigns of reſentment; but coming to a puddle filled with dirty
          water, he filled his trunk, returned to the ſhop, and ſpurted the contents
          over all the finery upon which the taylors were then employed.</p>
            <p>An elephant in Adſmeer, which often paſſed through the bazar
          or market, as he went by a certain herb-woman, always received from her a
          mouthful of greens. Being one day ſeized with a periodical fit of madneſs,
          he broke his fetters, and, running through the market, put the crowd to flight;
          and, among others, this woman, who in her haſte forgot a little child at her
          ſtall. The elephant recollecting the ſpot where his benefactreſs was
          accuſtomed to fit, took up the infant gently in his trunk, and conveyed it to
          a place of ſafety.</p>
            <p>At the Cape of Good Hope it is cuſtomary to hunt thoſe animals
          for the ſake of their teeth. Three horſemen, well mounted, and armed with
          lances, attack the elephant alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0823900104:368"/> each relieving
          the other, as they ſee their companion preſſed, till the beaſt is
          ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued. Three Dutchmen, brothers, who had made large fortunes by this
          buſineſs, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to retire to Europe, and enjoy the fruits of their
          labours; but they reſolved, one day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went, to have a laſt
          chace, by way of amuſement: they met with their game, and began their attack
          in the uſual manner; but, unfortunately, one of their horſes falling,
          hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to fling his rider; the enraged elephant inſtantly ſeized the
          unhappy huntſman with his trunk, flung him up to a vaſt height in the air,
          and received him upon one of his tuſks as he fell; and then turning towards
          the other two brothers, as if it were with an aſpect of revenge and inſult,
          held out to them the impaled wretch, writhing in the agonies of death.</p>
            <p>The teeth of the elephant are what produces the great enmity between
          him and mankind; but whether they are ſhed, like the horns of the deer, or
          whether the animal be killed to obtain them, is not yet perfectly known. All we
          have as yet certain is, that the natives of Africa, from whence almoſt all
          our ivory comes, aſſure us, that they find the greateſt part of it in
          their foreſts; nor would, ſay they, the teeth of an elephant recompence
          them for their trouble <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0823900104:369"/> and danger in killing it:
          notwithſtanding, the elephants which are tamed by man, are never known to
          ſhed their tuſks; and from the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſubſtance, they
          ſeem no way ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous to deers horns.</p>
            <p>The teeth of the elephant are very often found in a foſſile
          ſtate. Some years ago, two great grinding-teeth, and part of the tuſk of an
          elephant, were diſcoved, at the depth of forty-two yards, in a lead mine in
          Flintſhire<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Pennant's Synopſis, p.
              90.</bibl>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>The tuſks of the Mammouth, ſo often found foſſile in
          Siberia, and which are converted to the purpoſes of ivory, are generally
          ſuppoſed to belong to the elephant: however, the animal muſt have been
          much larger in that country than it is found at preſent, as thoſe tuſks
          are often known to weigh four hundred pounds; while thoſe that come from
          Africa, ſeldom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed two hundred and fifty. Theſe enormous tuſks are
          found lodged in the ſandy banks of the Siberian rivers; and the natives
          pretend that they belong to an animal which is four times as large as the
          elephant.</p>
            <p>There have lately been diſcovered ſeveral enormous ſkeletons,
          five or ſix feet beneath the ſurface, on the banks of the Ohio, not remote
          from the river Miume in America, ſeven <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0823900104:370"/> hundred miles
          from the ſea-coaſt. Some of the tuſks are near ſeven feet long; one
          foot nine inches in circumference at the baſe, and one foot near the point;
          the cavity at the root or baſe, nineteen inches deep. Beſides their ſize,
          there are yet other differences: the tuſks of the true elephant have
          ſometimes a very ſlight la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral bend; theſe have a larger twiſt, or
          ſpiral curve, towards the ſmaller end: but the great and ſpecific
          difference conſiſts in the ſhape of the grinding-teeth; which, in theſe
          newly found, are faſhioned like the teeth of a carnivorous animal; not flat
          and ribbed tranſverſely on their ſurface, like thoſe of the modern
          elephant, but furniſhed with a double row of high and conic proceſſes, as
          if intended to maſticate, not to grind their food. A third difference is in
          the thigh bone, which is of a great diſproportionable thickneſs to that of
          the elephant; and has alſo ſome other anatomical variations. Theſe
          foſſile bones have been alſo found in Peru and the Brazils; and, when cut
          and poliſhed by the workers in ivory, appear, in every reſpect, ſimilar.
          It is the opinion of Doctor Hunter that they muſt have belonged to a larger
          animal than the elephant; and differing from it, in being carnivorous. But as
          yet this formidable <pb n="284" facs="tcp:0823900104:371"/> creature has evaded our ſearch;
          and if, indeed, ſuch an animal exiſts, it is happy for man that it keeps at
          a diſtance; ſince what ravage might not be expected from a creature, endued
          with more than the ſtrength of the elephant, and all the rapacity of the
          tiger!</p>

               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0823900104:373"/> NEXT to the elephant, the Rhinoceros is the
          moſt powerful of animals. It is uſually found twelve feet long, from the
          tip of the noſe to the inſertion of the tail; from ſix to ſeven feet
          high; and the circumference of its body is nearly equal to its length. It is,
          there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, equal to the elephant in bulk; and if it appears much ſmaller to
          the eye, the reaſon is, that its legs are much ſhorter. Words can convey
          but a very confuſed idea of this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal's ſhape; and yet there are few
          ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably formed: its head is furniſhed with an horn, growing from the
          ſnout, ſometimes three feet and an half long; and but for this, that part
          would have the appearance of the head of an hog; the upper lip, however, is
          much longer in proportion, ends in a point, is very pliable, ſerves to
          collect its food, and deliver it into the mouth: the ears are large, erect, and
          pointed; the eyes are ſmall and piercing; the ſkin is naked, rough, knotty,
          and, lying upon the body in folds, after a very peculiar faſhion: there are
          two folds very remarkable; one above <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:374"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" resp="#OXF" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:0823900104:376"/> the
          ſhoulders, and another over the rump: the ſkin, which is of a dirty brown
          colour, is ſo thick as to turn the edge of a ſcymitar, and to reſiſt a
          muſquet-ball: the belly hangs low; the legs are ſhort, ſtrong and thick,
          and the hoofs divided into three parts, each pointing forward.</p>
            <p>Such is the general outline of an animal that appears chiefly
          formidable from the horn grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from its ſnout; and formed rather for war,
          than with a propenſity to engage. This horn, is ſometimes found from three
          to three feet and an half long, growing from the ſolid bone, and ſo
          diſpoſed, as to be managed to the greateſt advantage. It is compoſed of
          the moſt ſolid ſubſtance; and pointed ſo as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the moſt
          fatal wounds. The elephant, the boar, or the buffalo, are obliged to ſtrike
          tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſely with their weapons; but the rhinoceros employs all his force
          with every blow; ſo that the tiger will more willingly attack any other
          animal of the foreſt, than one whoſe ſtrength is ſo juſtly employed.
          Indeed, there is no force which this terrible animal has to apprehend:
          defended, on every ſide, by a thick horny hide, which the claws of the lion
          or the tiger are unable to pierce, and armed before with a weapon that even the
          elephant does not chuſe <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0823900104:377"/> to oppoſe. The
          miſſioners aſſure us, that the elephant is often found dead in the
          foreſts, pierced with the horn of a rhinoceros; and though it looks like
          wiſdom to doubt whatever they tell us, yet I cannot help giving credit to
          what they relate on this occaſion, particularly when confirmed by Pliny. The
          combat between theſe two, the moſt formidable animals of the foreſt,
          muſt be very dreadful. Emanuel, king of Portugal, willing to try their
          ſtrength, actually oppoſed them to each other; and the elephant was
          defeated.</p>
            <p>But though the rhinoceros is thus formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable by nature, yet
          imagination has not failed to exert itſelf, in adding to its terrors. The
          ſcent is ſaid to be moſt exquiſite; and it is affirmed, that it
          conſorts with the tiger. It is reported alſo, that when it has overturned a
          man, or any other animal, it continues to lick the fleſh quite from the bone
          with its tongue, which is ſaid to be extremely rough. All this, however, is
          fabulous: the ſcent, if we may judge from the expanſion of the olfactory
          nerves, is not greater than that of an hog, which we know to be indifferent; it
          keeps company with the tiger, only becauſe they both frequent watery places
          in the burning climates where they are bred; and as to its rough 
          <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0823900104:378"/> tongue, that is ſo far from the truth, that no animal
          of near its ſize has ſo ſoft a one. 
          <q rend="inline">"I have often felt it myſelf," ſays Ladvocat, in
            his deſcription of this animal; "it is ſmooth, ſoft, and ſmall, like
            that of a dog; and to the feel it appears as if one paſſed the hand over
            velvet. I have often ſeen it lick a young man's face who kept it; and both
            ſeemed pleaſed with the action."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The rhinoceros which was ſhewn at London in 1739, and deſcribed
          by Doctor Parſons, had been ſent from Bengal. Though it was very young, not
          being above two years old, yet the charge of his carriage and food from India,
          coſt near a thouſand pounds. It was fed with rice, ſugar, and hay: it was
          daily ſupplied with ſeven pounds of rice, mixed with three of ſugar,
          di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three, portions; it was given great quantities of hay and
          graſs, which it chiefly preferred; its drink was water, which it took in
          great quantities. It was of a gentle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and permitted itſelf
          to be touched and handled by all viſitors, never attempting miſchief,
          except when abuſed, or when hungry; in ſuch a caſe, there was no method
          of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing its fury, but by giving it ſomething to eat. When angry, it
          would jump up againſt the walls of its room, with great violence; and, 
          <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0823900104:379"/> many efforts to eſcape, but ſeldom attempted to
          attack its keeper, and was always ſubmiſſive to his threats. It had a
          peculiar cry, ſomewhat a mixture between the grunting of a hog, and the
          bellowing of a calf.</p>
            <p>The age of theſe animals is not well known; it is ſaid by
          ſome, that they bring forth at three years old, and if we may reaſon from
          analogy, it is probable they ſeldom live till above twenty. That which was
          ſhewn in London, was ſaid by its keeper, to be eighteen years old, and even
          at that age, he pretended to conſider it as a young one; however, it died
          ſhortly after, and that probably in the courſe of nature.</p>
            <p>The Rhinoceros is a native of the deſarts of Aſia and Africa,
          and is uſually found in thoſe extenſive foreſts, that are frequented by
          the elephant and the lion. As it ſubſiſts entirely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vegetable food,
          it is peaceful and harmleſs among its fellows of the brute creation; but,
          though it never provokes to combat, it equally diſdains to fly. It is every
          way fitted for war, but reſts content in the conſciouſneſs of its
          ſecurity. It is particularly fond of the prickly branches of trees, and is
          ſeen to feed upon ſuch thorny ſhrubs as would be dangerous to other
          animals, either to gather, or to ſwallow. The prickly points of theſe,
          however, may only <pb n="290" facs="tcp:0823900104:380"/> ſerve to give a poignant reliſh to
          this animal's palate, and may anſwer the ſame grateful ends in
          ſeaſoning its banquet, that ſpices do in heightening ours.</p>
            <p>In ſome parts of the kingdom of Aſia, where the natives are more
          deſirous of appearing war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like than ſhewing themſelves brave, theſe
          ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are tamed, and led into the field to ſtrike terror into the enemy;
          but they are always an unmanageable and reſtive animal, and probably more
          dangerous to the employers, than thoſe whom they are brought to oppoſe.</p>
            <p>The method of taking them, is chiefly watching them, till they are
          found either in ſome moiſt or marſhy place, where, like hogs, they are
          fond of ſleeping and wallowing. They then deſtroy the old one with
          fire-arms, for no weapons, that are thrown by the force of man, are capable of
          entering this animal's hide. If, when the old one is deſtroyed, there happens
          to be a cub, they ſeize and tame it: theſe animals are ſometimes taken in
          pit-falls, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with green branches, laid in thoſe paths which the
          Rhinoceros makes in going from the foreſt to the river ſide.</p>
            <p>There are ſome varieties in this animal, as in moſt others;
          ſome of them are found in Africa with a double horn, one growing above 
          <pb n="291" facs="tcp:0823900104:381"/> the other; this weapon, if conſidered in itſelf, is
          one of the ſtrongeſt, and moſt dangerous, that nature furniſhes to any
          part of the animal creation. The horn is entirely ſolid, formed of the
          hardeſt bony ſubſtance, growing from the upper maxilary bone, by ſo
          ſtrong an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſe, as ſeemingly to make but one part with it. Many are
          the medicinal virtues that are aſcribed to this horn, when taken in powder,
          but theſe qualities have been attributed to it, without any real foundation,
          and make only a ſmall part of the many fables which this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
          animal has given riſe to.</p>

            <head>CHAP. X. The Hippopotamos.</head>
            <p>THE hippopotamos is an animal as large, and not leſs formidable
          than the Rhinoceros; its legs are ſhorter, and its head rather more bulky
          than that of the animal laſt deſcribed. We have had but few opportunities
          in Europe of examining this formidable creature mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely, its dimenſions,
          however, have been pretty well aſcertained, by a deſcription given us by
          Zerenghi, an Italian ſurgeon, who procured one of them to be killed on the
          banks of the river Nile. By his account it appears, that this terrible animal,
          which chiefly reſides in the waters of that river, is above ſeventeen feet
          long, from the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the ſnout, to the inſertion of the tail; above
          ſixteen feet in circumference round the body, and above ſeven feet high:
          the head is near four feet long, and above nine feet in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference. The
          jaws open about two feet wide, and the cutting teeth, of which it hath four in
          each jaw, are above a foot long.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0823900104:383"/>Its feet, in ſome meaſure, reſemble
          thoſe of the elephant, and are divided into four parts. The tail is ſhort,
          flat, and pointed; the hide is amazingly thick, and though not capable of
          turning a muſket ball, is impenetrable to the blow of a ſabre; the body is
          covered over with a ſew ſcattered hairs, of a whitiſh colour. The whole
          figure of the animal is ſomething between that of an ox and a hog, and its
          cry is ſomething between the bellowing of the one, and the grunting of the
          other.</p>
            <p>This animal, however, though ſo terribly furniſhed for war,
          ſeems no way diſpoſed to make uſe of it's prodigious ſtrength
          againſt an equal enemy; itchiefly reſides at the bottom of the great rivers
          and lakes of Africa; the Nile, the Niger, and the Zara; there it leads an
          in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent kind of life, and ſeems ſeldom diſpoſed for action, except
          when excited by the calls of hunger. Upon ſuch occaſions, three or four of
          them are often ſeen at the bottom of a river, near ſome cataract, forming a
          kind of line, and ſeizing upon ſuch fiſh as are forced down by the
          violence of the ſtream. In that element they purſue their prey with great
          ſwiftneſs and perſeverance; they ſwim with much force, and remain at
          the bottom for thirty or forty minutes without riſing to take breath. They
          traverſe the <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0823900104:384"/> the bottom of the ſtream, as if walking
          upon land, and make a terrible devaſtation where they find plenty of prey.
          But it often happens, that this animal's fiſhy food is not ſupplied in
          ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient abundance, it is then forced to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on land, where it is an
          awkward and unweildy ſtranger; it moves but ſlowly, and, as it ſeldom
          forſakes the margin of the river, it ſinks at every ſtep it takes;
          ſometimes, however, it is forced, by famine, up into the higher grounds,
          where it commits dreadful havock among the plantations of the helpleſs
          natives, who ſee their poſſeſſions deſtroyed, without daring to
          reſiſt their invader. Their chief method is, by lighting fires, ſtriking
          drums, and raiſing a cry to frighten it back to its favourite element; and,
          as it is extremely timorous upon land, they generally ſucceed in their
          endeavours. But if they happen to wound, or otherways irritate it too
          cloſely, it then becomes formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all that oppoſe it: it overturns
          what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it meets, and brings forth all its ſtrength, which it ſeemed not
          to have diſcovered before that dangerous occaſion. It poſſeſſes the
          ſame inoffenſive diſpoſition in its favourite element, that it is found
          to have upon land; it is never found to attack the mariners in their boats, as
          they go up or down the ſtream; but ſhould <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0823900104:385"/> they
          inadvertently ſtrike againſt it, or otherwiſe diſturb its repoſe,
          there is much danger of its ſending them, at once, to the bottom. 
          <q rend="inline">"I have ſeen, ſays a mariner, as we find it in
            Dampier, one of theſe animals open its jaws, and ſeizing any boat between
            his teeth, at once, bite and ſink it to the bottom. I have ſeen it upon
            another occaſion, place itſelf under one of our boats, and riſing under
            it, overſet it with ſix men which were in it; who, however, happily
            received no other injury."</q> Such is the great ſtrength of this animal; and
          from hence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, the imagination has been willing to match it in combat
          againſt others more fierce and equally formidable. The crocodile and ſhark
          have been ſaid to engage with it, and yield an eaſy victory; but as the
          ſhark is only found at ſea, and the hippopotomos never ventures beyond the
          mouth of freſh-water rivers, it is moſt probable that theſe engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
          never occurred; it ſometimes happens, indeed, that the princes of Africa
          amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with combats, on their freſh-water lakes, between this
          and other formidable animals; but whether the rhinoceros or the crocodile are
          of this number, we have not been particularly informed. If this animal be
          attacked at land, and finding itſelf incapable of vengeance from 
          <pb n="296" facs="tcp:0823900104:386"/> the ſwiftneſs of its enemy, it immediately returns
          to the river, where it plunges in head foremoſt, and after a ſhort time
          riſes to the ſurface, loudly bellowing, either to invite or intimidate the
          enemy; but though the negroes will venture to attack the ſhark, or the
          crocodile, in their natural element, and there deſtroy them, they are too
          well appriſed of the force of the hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamos to engage it; this animal,
          therefore, continues the uncontrouled maſter of the river, and all others fly
          from its approach and become an eaſy prey.</p>
            <p>As the hippopotomos lives upon fiſh and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, ſo it is
          probable the fleſh of terreſtrial animals may be equally grateful: the
          natives of Africa aſſert, that it has often been found to devour children
          and other creatures that it was able to ſurpriſe upon land; yet it moves
          but ſlowly, almoſt every creature, endued with a common ſhare of
          ſwiftneſs, is able to eſcape it; and this animal, therefore, ſeldom
          ventures from the river ſide, but when preſſed by the neceſſities of
          hunger, or of bringing forth its young.</p>
            <p>The female always comes upon land to bring forth, and it is
          ſuppoſed that ſhe ſeldom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces above one at a time; upon this
          occaſion, theſe animals are particularly timorous, and 
          <pb n="297" facs="tcp:0823900104:387"/> dread the approach of a terreſtrial enemy; the
          inſtant the parent hears the ſlighteſt noiſe, it daſhes into the
          ſtream, and the young one is ſeen to follow it with equal alacrity.</p>
            <p>The young ones are ſaid to be excellent eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the negroes,
          to whom nothing that has life comes amiſs, find an equal delicacy in the old.
          Dr. Pocock has ſeen their fleſh ſold in the ſhambles, like beef; and it
          is ſaid, that their breaſt, in particular, is as delicate eating as veal.
          As for the reſt, theſe animals are found in great numbers, and as they
          produce very faſt, their fleſh, might ſupply the countries where they are
          found, could thoſe barbarous regions produce more expert huntſmen; it may
          be remarked, however, that this creature, which was once in ſuch plenty at
          the mouth of the Nile, is now wholly unknown in Lower Egypt, and is no where to
          be found in that river, except above the cataracts.</p>

          remains, which is high enough to admit a man mounted upon a middle ſized

            <p>No animal, either from its diſpoſition, or its formation,

          hoſtility; its horns are blunt, and even knobbed at the ends; its teeth are
          made entirely for vegetable paſture; its ſkin is beautifully ſpeckled
          with white ſpots, upon a browniſh ground; it is timorous and harmleſs,
          and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding its great ſize, rather flies from, than reſiſts
          the ſlighteſt enemy; it partakes very much of the nature of the camel,
          which it ſo nearly reſembles; it lives entirely upon vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and when
          grazing, is obliged to ſpread its fore legs very wide, in order to reach its
          paſture; its motion is a kind of pace, two legs on each ſide moving at the
          ſame time, whereas in other animals they move tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſely. It often
          lies down with its belly to the earth, and like the camel, has a callous
          ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance upon its breaſt, which, when repoſed, defends it from
          injury. This animal was known to the ancients, but has been very rarely ſeen
          in Europe. One of them was ſent from the Eaſt to the Emperor of Germany, in
          the year 1559, but they have often been ſeen tame at Grand Cairo, in Egypt;
          and I am told, there are two there at preſent. When ancient Rome was in its
          ſplendour, Pompey exhibited, at one time, no leſs than ten, upon the

          continue to travel ſeveral days without drinking. In thoſe vaſt
          deſarts, where the earth is every where dry and ſandy, where there are
          neither birds nor beaſts, neither inſects nor vegetables, where nothing is
          to be ſeen but hills of ſand and heaps of bones, there the camel travels,
          poſting forward, without requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either drink or paſture, and is often
          found ſix or ſeven days without any ſuſtenance what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Its feet
          are formed for travelling upon ſand, and utterly unfit for moiſt or
          marſhy places; the inhabitants, therefore, find a moſt uſeful
          aſſiſtant in this animal, where no other could ſubſiſt, and by its
          means, croſs thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0823900104:401"/> with ſafety, which
          would be unpaſſable by any other method of conveyance.</p>
            <p>An animal, thus formed for a ſandy and deſart region, cannot be
          propagated in one of a different nature. Many vain efforts have been tried to
          propagate the camel, in Spain; they have been tranſported into America, but
          have multiplied in neither. It is true, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that they may be brought into
          theſe countries, and may, perhaps, be found to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce there, but the care
          of keeping them is ſo great, and the accidents to which they are expoſed,
          from the changeableneſs of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, are ſo many, that they cannot
          anſwer the care of keeping. In a few years alſo, they are ſeen to
          degenerate; their ſtrength and their patience forſake them; and inſtead
          of making the riches, they become the burthen of their keepers.</p>
            <p>But it is very different in Arabia, and thoſe countries where the
          camel is turned to uſeful purpoſes. It is there conſidered as a ſacred
          animal, without whoſe help, the natives could neither ſubſiſt,
          traffick, or travel; its milk makes a part of their nouriſhment; they feed
          upon its fleſh particularly when young; they clothe themſelves with its
          hair, which it is ſeen to molt regularly once a year, and if they fear an 
          <pb n="305" facs="tcp:0823900104:402"/> invading enemy, their camels ſerve them in flight, and
          in a ſingle day, they are known to travel above an hundred miles. Thus, by
          means of the camel, an Arabian finds ſafety in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts; all the armies
          upon earth might be loſt in the purſuit of a flying ſquadron of this
          country, mounted upon their camels, and taking refuge in ſolitudes where
          nothing interpoſes to ſtop their flight, or to force them to wait the
          in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader. Nothing can be more dreary than the aſpect of theſe ſandy
          plains, that ſeem entirely forſaken of life and vegetation: wherever the
          eye turns, nothing is preſented but a ſterril and duſty ſoil,
          ſometimes torn up by the winds, and moving in great waves along, which, when
          viewed from an eminence, reſemble leſs the earth than the ocean; here and
          there a few ſhrubs appear that only teach us to wiſh for the grove that
          remind us of the ſhade in theſe ſultry climates, without affording its
          re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment; the return of morning, which, in other places, carries an idea
          of chearfulneſs here ſerves only to enlighten the endleſs and dreary
          waſte, and to preſent the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller with an unfiniſhed proſpect of his
          forlorn ſituation; yet in this chaſm of nature, by the help of the camel,
          the Arabian finds ſafety and ſubſiſtance There are here and there 
          <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0823900104:403"/> found ſpots of verdure, which, though remote from each
          other, are, in a manner, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proximated by the labour and induſtry of the
          camel. Thus theſe deſarts, which preſent the ſtranger with nothing but
          objects of danger and ſterility, afford the inhabitant protection, food, and
          liberty. The Arabian lives independant and tranquil in the midſt of his
          ſolitudes; and, inſtead of conſidering the vaſt ſolitudes ſpread
          round him as a reſtraint upon his happineſs, he is, by experience, taught
          to regard them as the ramparts of his freedom.</p>
            <p>The camel is eaſily inſtructed in the methods of taking up and
          ſupporting his burthen; their legs, a few days after they are produced, are
          bent under their belly; they are in this manner loaded, and taught to riſe;
          their burthen is every day thus encreaſed, by inſenſible degrees, till
          the animal is capable of ſupporting a weight adequate to its force: the
          ſame care is taken in making them patient of hunger and thirſt: while other
          animals receive their food at ſtated times, the camel is reſtrained for
          days together, and theſe intervals of famine are encreaſed in proportion as
          the animal ſeems capable of ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. By this method of
          education, they live five or ſix days without food or water; and their
          ſtomach is formed moſt admirably by <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0823900104:404"/> nature, to fit
          them for long abſtinence: beſides the four ſtomachs, which all animals
          have, that chew the cud, (and the camel is of the number) it has a fifth
          ſtomach, which ſerves as a reſervoir, to hold a greater quantity of
          wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the animal has an immediate occaſion for. It is of a ſufficient
          capacity to contain a large quantity of water, where the fluid remains without
          corrupting, or without being adulterat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the other aliments: when the camel
          finds itſelf preſſed with thirſt, it has here an eaſy reſource for
          quenching it; it throws up a quantity of this water by a ſimple contraction
          of the muſcles, into the other ſtomachs, and this ſerves to macerate its
          dry and ſimple food; in this manner, as it drinks but ſeldom, it takes in a
          large quantity at a time, and travellers, when ſtraightened for water, have
          been often known to kill their camels for that which they expected to find
          within them.</p>
            <p>In Turky, Perſia, Arabia, Barbary, and Egypt, their whole commerce
          is carried on by means of camels, and no carriage is more ſpeedy, and none
          leſs expenſive in theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Merchants and travellers unite
          them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a body, furniſhed with camels, to ſecure themſelves
          from the inſults of the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that infeſt the countries in which they 
          <pb n="308" facs="tcp:0823900104:405"/> live. This aſſemblage is called a caravan, in which
          the numbers are ſometimes known to amount to above ten thouſand, and the
          num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of camels is often greater than thoſe of the men: each of theſe
          animals is loaded according to his ſtrength, and he is ſo ſenſible of
          it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that when his burthen is too great, he remains ſtill upon his
          belly, the poſture in which he is loaden, refuſing to riſe, till his
          burthen be leſſened or taken away. In general, the large camels are capable
          of carrying a thouſand weight, and ſometimes twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; the dromedary
          from ſix to ſeven. In theſe trading journies, they travel but ſlowly,
          their ſtages are generally regulated, and they ſeldom go above thirty, or
          at moſt about five and thirty miles a day. Every evening, when they arrive at
          a ſtage, which is uſually ſome ſpot of verdure, where water and
          ſhrubs are in plenty, they are permitted to feed at liberty; they are then
          ſeen to eat as much in an hour, as will ſupply them for twenty-four, they
          ſeem to prefer the coarſeſt weeds to the ſofteſt paſture, the
          thiſtle, the nettle, the caſia, and other prickly vegetables, are their
          favourite food; but their drivers take care to ſupply them with a kind of
          paſte compoſition, which ſerves as a more permanent nouriſhment. As
          theſe animals <pb n="309" facs="tcp:0823900104:406"/> have often gone the ſame track, they
          are ſaid to know their way preciſely, and to purſue their paſſage
          when their guides are utterly aſtray: when they come within a few miles of
          their baiting-place, in the evening, they ſagaciouſly ſcent it at a
          diſtance, and encreaſing their ſpeed, are often ſeen to trot, with
          vivacity to their ſtage.</p>
            <p>The patience of this animal is moſt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; and it is
          probable, that its ſufferings are great, for when it is loaded, it ſends
          forth moſt lamentable cries, but never offers to reſiſt the tyrant that
          oppreſſes it. At the ſlighteſt ſign, it bends its knees and lies upon
          its belly, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſelf to be loaded in this poſition; by this
          practice the burthen is more eaſily laid upon it, than if lifted up while
          ſtanding; at another ſign it riſes with its load, and the driver getting
          upon its back, between the two panniers, which, like hampers, are placed upon
          each ſide, he encourages the camel to proceed with his voice and with a
          ſong. In this manner the creature proceeds contentedly forward, with a ſlow
          un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy walk, of about four miles an hour, and when it comes to its ſtage,
          lies down to be unloaded, as before.</p>
            <p>Mr. Buffon ſeems to conſider the camel to be the moſt
          domeſticated of all other creatures, <pb n="310" facs="tcp:0823900104:407"/> and to have more
          marks of the tyranny of man imprinted on its form. He is of opinion, that this
          animal is not now to be found in a ſtate of nature, that the humps on its
          back, the calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities upon its breaſt, and its legs, and even the great
          reſervoir for water, are all marks of long ſervitude and domeſtic
          conſtraint. The deformities he ſuppoſes to be perpetuated by generation,
          and what at firſt was accident at laſt becomes nature. However this be, the
          humps upon the back grow large in proportion as the animal is well fed, and if
          examined, they will be found compoſed of a ſubſtance not unlike the udder
          of a cow.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants generally leave but one male to wait on ten females,
          the reſt they caſtrate; and though they thus become weaker, they are more
          manageable and patient. The female receives the male in the ſame poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
          as when theſe animals are loaded; ſhe goes with young for about a year,
          and, like all other great animals, produces but one at a time. The camel's milk
          is abundant and nouriſhing, and mixed with water makes a principle part of
          the beverage of the Arabians. Theſe animals begin to engender at three years
          of age, and they ordinarily live from forty to fifty years. The genital part of
          the male reſembles that of <pb n="311" facs="tcp:0823900104:408"/> the bull, but is placed
          pointing backwards, ſo that its urine ſeems to be ejected in the manner of
          the female. This, as well as the dung, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every part of this animal,
          is converted to ſome uſeful purpoſe by the keepers. Of the urine
          falmoniac is made; and of the dung, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the horſes, and fire, for the
          purpoſe of dreſſing their victuals. Thus, this animal alone ſeems to
          compriſe within itſelf, a variety of qualities, any one of which ſerves
          to render other quadrupedes abſolutely neceſſary for the welfare of man;
          like the elephant, it is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ageable and tame; like the horſe, it gives the
          rider ſecurity; it carries greater burthens than the ox, or the mule, and its
          milk is furniſhed in as great abundance as that of the cow; the fleſh of
          the young ones is ſuppoſed to be as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate as veal; their hair is more
          beautiful, and more in requeſt than wool; while even of its very excrements,
          no part is uſeleſs.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIV. The Lama.</head>
            <p>AS almoſt all the quadrupedes of America are ſmaller than the
          reſembling ones of the ancient continent, ſo the lama, which may be
          conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the camel of the new world, is every way leſs than that of
          the old. This animal, like that deſcribed in the former chapter, ſtands
          high upon its legs, has a long neck, a ſmall head, and reſembles the camel,
          not only in its natural mildneſs, but its aptitude for ſervitude, its
          moderation, and its patience. The Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans early found out its uſeful
          qualities, and availed themſelves of its labours: like the camel, it ſerves
          to carry goods over places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible to other beaſts of burthen; like
          that it is obedient to its driver, and often dies under, but never reſiſts
          his cruelty.</p>
            <p>Of theſe animals, ſome are white, others black, but they are
          moſtly brown; its face re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles that of the camel, and its height is
          about equal to that of an aſs. They are not found in the ancient continent,
          but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely <pb n="313" facs="tcp:0823900104:410"/> belong to the new; nor are they found
          ſpread over all America, but are found chiefly upon thoſe mountains, that
          ſtretch from New Spain to the Streights of Magellan. They inhabit the
          higheſt regions of the globe, and ſeem to require purer air than animals of
          a lower ſituation are found to enjoy. Peru ſeems to be the place where they
          are found in greateſt plenty. In Mexico, they are introduced rather as
          curioſities than beaſts of burthen; but in Potoſi, and other provinces of
          Peru, they make the chief riches of the Indians and Spaniards who rear them:
          their fleſh is excellent food; their hair or rather wool, may be ſpun into
          beautiful cloathing, and they are capable, in the moſt rugged and dangerous
          ways, of carrying burthens not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding a hundred weight, with the greateſt
          ſafety. It is true indeed that they go but ſlowly, and ſeldom above
          fifteen miles a day; their tread is heavy, but ſure, they deſcend
          precipices, and find footing among the moſt craggy rocks where even men can
          ſcarce ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them; they are, however, but feeble animals, and after four
          or five days labour, they are obliged to repoſe for a day or two. They are
          chiefly uſed in carrying the riches of the mines of Potoſi, and we are told
          that there <pb n="314" facs="tcp:0823900104:411"/> are above three hundred thouſand of theſe
          animals in actual employ.</p>
            <p>This animal, as was ſaid before, is above three feet high, and the
          neck is three feet long, the head is ſmall and well proportioned, the eyes
          large, the noſe long, the lips thick, the upper divided, and the lower a
          little depending, like all thoſe animals that feed upon graſs, it wants the
          upper cutting teeth; the ears are four inches long, and move with great
          agility; the tail is but five inches long, it is ſmall, ſtrait, and a
          little turned up at the end; it is cloven footed, like the ox, but it has a
          kind of ſpear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like appendage behind, which aſſiſts it in mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over
          precipices and rugged ways; the wool on the back is ſhort, but long on the
          ſides and the belly; it reſembles the camel in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the
          genital parts in the male, ſo that it makes urine backwards; it couples
          alſo in the ſame manner, and though it finds much difficulty in the action,
          it is ſaid to be much inclined to venery. A whole day is often paſſed,
          before this neceſſary buſineſs can be compleated, which is ſpent in
          growling, quarrelling, and ſpitting at each other; they ſeldom produce
          above one at a time, and their age never extends above ten or twelve years at
          fartheſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0823900104:412"/>Though the lama is no way comparable to the
          camel, either for ſize, ſtrength, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, yet the Americans
          find a ſubſtitute in it, with which they ſeem perfectly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It
          appears formed for that indolent race of maſters, which it is obliged to
          ſerve; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no care, nor no expence in the attending or providing for
          its ſuſtenance; it is ſupplied with a warm covering, and therefore does
          not require to be houſed; ſatisfied with vegetables and graſs, it wants
          neither corn nor hay to ſubſiſt it; it is not leſs moderate in what it
          drinks, and exceeds even the camel in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance. Indeed, of all other
          creatures, it ſeems to require water leaſt, as it is ſupplied by nature
          with ſaliva in ſuch large quantities, that it ſpits it out on every
          occaſion: this ſaliva ſeems to be the only offenſive weapon that the
          harmleſs creature has to teſtify its reſentment. When overloaded, or
          fatigued, and driven on by all the torturing acts of its keeper, it falls on
          its belly, and pours out againſt him, a quantity of this fluid; which, though
          probably no way hurtful, the Indians are much afraid of They ſay, that
          wherever it falls, it is of ſuch an acrimonious nature, that it will either
          burn the ſkin, or cauſe very dangerous erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:0823900104:413"/>Such are theſe animals in their domeſtic
          ſtate; but as they are found wild in very great numbers, they exhibit marks
          of great force and agility, in their ſtate of nature. The ſtag is
          ſcarcely more ſwift, or the goat, or the ſhamoy a better climber. All its
          ſhapes are more delicate and ſtrong; its colour is tawney, and its wool is
          but ſhort; in their native for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, they are gregarious animals, and are
          often ſeen in flocks of two or three hundred at a time. When they perceive a
          ſtranger, they regard him at firſt with aſtoniſhment, without marking
          any fear or ſurprize; but ſhortly, as if by common conſent, they ſnuff
          up the air, ſomewhat like horſes, and at once, by a common flight take
          refuge on the tops of the mountains; they are fonder of the northern than the
          ſouthern ſide of the Andes; they often climb above the ſnowy tracts of
          the mountain, and ſeem vigorous in proportion to the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their
          ſituation. The natives hunt the wild lama for the ſake of its fleece. If
          the dogs ſurprize one upon the plain, they are generally ſucceſsful; but
          if once the lama ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the rocky precipice of the mountain, the hunters are
          obliged to deſiſt in their purſuit.</p>
            <p>The lama ſeems to be the largeſt of the camel kind in America;
          there are others, which are <pb n="317" facs="tcp:0823900104:414"/> called guanacoes and pacos,
          that are ſmaller and weaker, but endued with the ſame nature, and formed
          pretty much in the ſame manner. They ſeem to bear the ſame proportions to
          each other, that the horſe does to the aſs, and are employed with the
          ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſubordination. The wool, however, of the paco, ſeems to
          be the moſt valuable, and it is formed into ſtuffs, not inferiour to
          ſilk, either in price or beauty. The natural colour of the paco, is that of a
          dried roſe leaf; the manufacturers ſeldom give its wool any other dye, but
          form it into quilts and carpets, which exceed thoſe from the Levant. This
          manufacture forms a very conſiderable branch of commerce in South America,
          and probably too, might be extended to Europe, were the beauty, and the
          durability of what is thus wrought up ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known.</p>

          in its form. In ſize, it is as much ſmaller than the one, as it is larger
          than the other; its body, horns, and tail, are not unlike thoſe of a bull;
          and the head, neck, and legs, are very like thoſe of a deer. The colour, in
          ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, is aſh or grey, from a mixture of black hairs and white; all along
          the ridge or edge of the neck, the hair is blacker, larger, and more erect,
          making a ſhort thin and upright mane. Its horns are ſeven inches long, they
          are ſix inches round at the root, growing ſmaller by degrees, they
          terminate in a blunt point. The bluntneſs of theſe, together with the form
          of its head and neck, might incline us to ſuppoſe it was of the deer kind;
          but, as it never ſheds its horns, it has a greater affinity to the cow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0823900104:416"/>From the diſpoſition of that brought over
          to this country, which has been very accurately and minutely deſcribed by Dr.
          Hunter, their manners were harmleſs and gentle. Although in its native
          wildneſs, it is ſaid to be fierce and vicious, this ſeemed pleaſed with
          every kind of familiarity, and always licked the hand that ſtroked, or gave
          it bread, and never once attempted to uſe its horns offenſively; it
          ſeemed to have much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on its organs of ſmell, and ſnuffed
          keenly, and with noiſe, whenever any perſon came within ſight; it did
          ſo likewiſe, when any food or drink was brought to it; and was ſo
          eaſily offended with ſmells, or ſo cautious, that it would not taſte
          the bread which was offered, when the hand happened to ſmell ſtrong of
          turpentine. Its manner of fighting is very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. It was obſerved, at
          Lord Clive's, where two males were put into a little incloſure, that, while
          they were at a conſiderable diſtance from each other, they prepared for the
          attack, by falling upon their fore-knees, then they ſhuffled towards each
          other, with a quick pace, keeping ſtill upon their fore-knees; and when they
          were come within ſome yards, they made a ſpring and darted againſt each
          other. The intrepidity and force with which they dart againſt any object,
          appeared by the ſtrength with which <pb n="320" facs="tcp:0823900104:417"/> one of them
          attempted to over-turn a poor labourer who unthinkingly ſtood on the
          outſide of the pales of its incloſure. The Nyl ghau, with the quickneſs
          of lightning, darted againſt the wood-work with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that he
          broke it to pieces, and broke off one of his horns cloſe to the root, which
          occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the animal's death. At all the places in India where we have
          ſettlements, they are conſidered as rarities, and brought from the
          diſtant interiour parts of the country. The Emperor, ſometimes, kills them
          in ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as to diſtribute quarters of them to all his omrahs;
          which ſhews that they are internally wild and in plenty, and eſteemed good
          or dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious food. The nyl-ghaus, which have been brought to England, have
          been moſt, if not all of them, received from Surat or Bombay; and they ſeem
          to be leſs uncommon in that part of India, than in Bengal; which gives room
          for a conjecture, that they may be indigenous, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the province of
          Guzarat, one of the moſt weſtern and the moſt conſiderable of the
          Hindoſtan empire, lying to the northward of Surat, and ſtretching away to
          the Indian ocean.</p>

               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:0823900104:419"/>OF the bear, there are three different kinds,
          the brown bear of the Alps, the black bear of North-America, which is
          ſmaller, and the great Greenland, or white bear. Theſe, tho' diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in
          their form, are no doubt of the ſame original, and owe their chief variations
          to food and climate. They have all the ſame habitudes, being equally
          carnivorous, treacherous and cruel. It has been ſaid indeed, that the black
          bear of America, rejects animal food, but of the contrary I am certain, as I
          have often ſeen the young ones, which are brought over to London, prefer
          fleſh to every kind of veget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able aliment.</p>
            <p>The brown bear, is properly an inhabitant of the temperate climates;
          the black finds ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in the northern regions of Europe and
          America, while the great white bear takes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in the moſt icy climates,
          and lives where ſcarce any other animal can find ſubſiſtence.</p>

                  <bibl>Buffon.</bibl>
               </note> is not only
          ſavage but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary; he takes refuge in the moſt unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parts,
          and the moſt dangerous precipices of uninhabited mountains. It chuſes its
          den in the moſt gloomy parts of the foreſt, in ſome cavern that has been
          hollowed by time, or in the hollow of ſome old enormous tree. There it
          retires alone, and paſſes ſome months of the winter without proviſions,
          or without ever ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring abroad. However this animal is not intirely
          deprived of ſenſation like the bat, or the dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſe, but ſeems rather
          to ſubſiſt upon the exuberance of its former fleſh, and only feels the
          calls of appetite, when the fat it had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in ſummer, begins to be
          entirely waſted away. In this manner, when the bear retires to its den, to
          hide for the winter, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fat, but at the end of forty or fifty
          days, when it comes forth to ſeek for freſh nouriſhment, it ſeems to
          have ſlept all its fleſh away. It is a common report, that during this
          time, they live by ſucking their paws, which is a vulgar error that ſcarce
          requires confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe ſolitary animals couple in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, but the
          time of geſtation with the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male is ſtill unknown; the female takes great
          care to provide a proper retreat for her young, <pb n="323" facs="tcp:0823900104:423"/> ſhe
          ſecures them in the hollow of a rock, and provides a bed of hay in the
          warmeſt part of the den; ſhe brings forth in winter, and the young ones
          begin to follow her in ſpring. The male and female, by no means inhabit the
          ſame den; they have each their ſeparate retreat, and ſeldom are ſeen
          together but upon the acceſſes of genial deſire.</p>
            <p>The voice of the bear is a kind of growl, interrupted with rage,
          which is often caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly exerted; and tho' this animal ſeems gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
          and placid to its maſter, when tamed; yet it is ſtill to be diſtruſted
          and managed with caution, as it is often treacherous and reſentful without a
          cauſe.</p>
            <p>This animal is capable of ſome degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. There are
          few but have ſeen it dance in aukward meaſures upon its hind feet, to the
          voice or the inſtrument of its leader; and it muſt be confeſſed that
          the dancer is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found to be the beſt performer of the two. I am told,
          that it is firſt taught to perform in this manner, by ſetting it upon hot
          plates of iron, and then playing to it, while in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy
          ſituation.</p>
            <p>The bear, when come to maturity, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be tamed; it then
          continues in its native fierceneſs, and tho' caged, ſtill formidably
          im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, <pb n="324" facs="tcp:0823900104:424"/> at the approach of its keeper flies to meet
          him. But notwithſtanding the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this animal, the natives in
          thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where it is found, hunt it with great perſeverance and
          alacrity. The leaſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous method of taking it is by intoxicating it, by
          throwing brandy upon honey, which it ſeems to be chiefly fond of, and ſeeks
          for in the hollow of trees. In Canada, where the black bears are very common,
          and where their dens are made in trees, that are hollow towards the top, they
          are taken by ſetting fire to their retreats, which are often above thirty
          feet from the ground. The old one is generally ſeen firſt to iſſue from
          her den, and is ſhot by the hunters. The young ones, as they deſcend, are
          caught in a nooſe, and are either kept or killed for proviſion. Their paws
          are ſaid to be a great delicacy, and their hams are well enough known at the
          tables of the luxurious here. Their fat alſo, which ſtill preſerves a
          certain degree of fluidity, is ſuppoſed to be an efficacious remedy in
          white or indolent tumours, tho' probably very little ſuperior to hogs
          lard.</p>
            <p>The white Greenland bear differs greatly, both in figure and
          dimenſions, from thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſcribed; and tho' it preſerves in

          yet it grows to above three times the ſize. The brown bear is ſeldom above
          ſix feet long; the white bear is often known from twelve to thirteen. The
          brown bear is made rather ſtrong and ſturdy, like the maſtiff; the
          Greenland bear, tho' covered with very long hair, and apparently bulky, is
          nevertheleſs more ſlender, both as to the head, neck, and body, and more
          inclining to the ſhape of the grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound. In ſhort, all the variations of
          its fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and its colour, ſeem to proceed from the coldneſs of the
          climate, where it reſides, and the nature of the food it is ſupplied
          with.</p>
            <p>The white bear, ſeems the only animal, that by being placed in the
          coldeſt climate, grows larger than thoſe that live in the temperate zones.
          All other ſpecies of animated nature, diminiſh as they approach the poles,
          and ſeem contracted in their ſize, by the rigours of the ambient
          atmoſphere, but the bear, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted in theſe deſolate climates,
          and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no animal, but what he can eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, finding alſo a
          ſufficient ſupply of fiſhy proviſions, he grows to an enormous ſize,
          and as the lion is the tyrant of an African foreſt, ſo the bear remains
          undiſputed maſter of the icy mountains in Spitzbergen and Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. When
          our mariners land upon thoſe <pb n="326" facs="tcp:0823900104:429"/> ſhores, in ſuch parts
          as have not been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, the white bears come down to view them
          with an aukward curioſity; they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſlowly, ſeeming undetermined
          whether to advance or retreat, and being naturally a timorous animal, they are
          only urged on by the conſcious experience of their former vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories;
          however, when they are ſhot at, or wounded, they endeavour to fly, or finding
          that impracticable, they make a fierce and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate reſiſtance till
          they die. As they live upon fiſh and ſeals, their fleſh is too ſtrong
          for food, and the captors have nothing but the ſkin, to reward them, for the
          dangers incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the engagement.</p>
            <p>The number of theſe animals that are found about the north-pole,
          if we conſider the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city thereof, of all other terreſtrial creatures
          is very amazing. They are not only ſeen at land, but often on ice-floats,
          ſeveral leagues at ſea. They are often tranſported in this manner to the
          very ſhores of Iceland, where they no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er land, but all the natives are
          in arms to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. It often happens, that when a greenlander and his
          wife are paddling out at ſea, by coming too near an ice-float, a white bear
          unexpectedly jumps into their boat, and if he does not overſet it, ſits
          calmly where <pb n="327" facs="tcp:0823900104:430"/> he firſt came down, and like a
          paſſenger, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himſelf to be rowed along. It is probable the poor
          little greenlander is not very fond of his new gueſts, however he makes a
          virtue of neceſſity, and hoſpitably rows him to ſhore.</p>
            <p>As this animal lives chiefly upon fiſh, ſeals, and dead whales,
          it ſeldom removes far from the ſhore. When forced by hunger, it often
          ventures into the deep, ſwims after ſeals, and devours whatever it can
          ſeize; it is however but a bad ſwimmer, and it is often hunted in this
          manner by boats, till it is fatigued, and at laſt deſtroyed. It often
          happens a battle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues between a bear and a morſe or a whale, as the
          latter are more expert in their own element, they generally prove victorious.
          However, when the bear can find a young whale, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pays him for the danger he
          incurs of meeting with the parent.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XVII. The Badger.</head>
            <p>THE badgers legs are ſo ſhort, that its belly ſeems to touch
          the ground; this however is but a deceitful appearance, as it is cauſed by
          the length of the hair, which is very long all over the body, and makes it
          ſeem much more bulky that it really is. It is a ſolitary ſtupid animal,
          that finds refuge, remote from man, and digs itſelf a deep hole, with great
          aſſiduity. It ſeems to avoid the light, and ſeldom quits its retreat by
          day, only ſtealing out at night to find ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. It burrows in the
          ground very eaſy, its legs being ſhort and ſtrong, and its claws, ſtiff
          and horny. As it continues to bury itſelf, and throw the earth behind it, to
          a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and thus forms to itſelf a winding hole, at the bottom
          of which it remains in ſafety. As the fox is not ſo expert at digging into
          the earth, it often takes poſſeſſion of that which has been quitted by
          the badger, and ſome ſay, forces it from its retreat, by laying its
          excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the mouth of the badger's hole.</p>

               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:0823900104:435"/>This animal, however, is not long in making
          itſelf a new habitation, from which it ſeldom ventures far, as it flies but
          ſlowly, and can find ſafety only in the ſtrength of its retreat. When it
          is ſurprized by the dogs at ſome diſtance from its hole, it then combats
          with deſperate reſolution; it falls upon its back, defends itſelf on
          every ſide, and ſeldom dies unrevenged in the midſt of its enemies.</p>
            <p>The badger, like the fox, is a carnivorous animal, and nothing that
          has life can come amiſs to it. It ſleeps the greateſt part of its time,
          and thus without being a voracious feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it ſtill keeps fat, particularly
          in winter. They always keep their hole very clear, and when the female brings
          forth, ſhe makes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable warm bed of hay, at the bottom of her hole
          for the reception of her young. She brings forth in ſummer, generally to the
          num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of three or four, which ſhe feeds at firſt with her milk, and
          afterwards with ſuch petty prey as ſhe can ſurprize. She ſeizes the
          young rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets in their warren, robs birds neſts, finds out where the wild
          bees have laid up their honey, and brings all to her expecting brood.</p>
            <p>The young ones when taken are eaſily tamed, but the old ſtill
          continues ſavage and incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible; the former, after a ſhort time, play
          with <pb n="330" facs="tcp:0823900104:436"/> the dogs, follow their maſter about the houſe,
          but ſeem of all other animals the moſt fond of the fire. They often
          approach it ſo cloſely, that they burn themſelves in a dangerous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
          They are ſometimes alſo ſubject to the mange, and have a gland under
          their tail, which ſcents pretty ſtrongly. The poor of ſome countries eat
          their fleſh; which, tho' fat, is at beſt, but rank and ill taſted.</p>

          reſemblance between many animals of the old and the new world. The congar of
          America, reſembles the tiger in natural ferocity, tho' far inferior in its
          dimenſions. The lama bears ſome affinity to the camel, but is far behind it
          in ſtrength and utility. The tapir may be conſidered as the hippopotamos of
          the New Continent, but, degraded both as to its ſize and ferocity.</p>
            <p>This animal bears ſome diſtant reſemblance in its form to a
          mule. It has a long ſnout, which it lengthens or contracts at pleaſure. Its
          ears are ſmall, long, and pendant. Its neck and tail are ſhort, and its
          claws ſtrong and firm, of which it has four upon each foot. Its ſkin is
          thick, and covered with brown hair, and the natives make ſhields of it, which
          can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pierced by an arrow.</p>
            <p>This animal may in ſome meaſure be termed amphibious, as it
          chiefly reſides in the water. <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:439"/>

          differs however from all others of this kind, in feeding entirely upon

          feeds upon the paſtures by the river<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and as it is very timorous, the
          inſtant it hears the leaſt noiſe, it plunges into the ſtream. They are
          greatly ſought after by the natives, as their fleſh is conſidered as a

               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:0823900104:443"/>THE racoon, which ſome authors have called
          the Jamaica rat, is about the ſize of a ſmall bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; its body is ſhort
          and bulky; its fur is fine, long and thick, blackiſh at the ſurface, and
          grey towards the bottom; the noſe is rather ſhorter, and more pointed than
          that of a fox; the eyes large and yellow, the teeth reſembling thoſe of a
          dog, the tail thick, but tapering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a point, regularly marked with rings
          of black, and at leaſt as long as the body; the fore-feet are much ſhorter
          than the hinder, both armed with five ſharp claws, with which, and his teeth,
          the animal makes a vigorous reſiſtance. Like the ſquirrel, it makes uſe
          of its paws to hold its food while eating, but it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the
          monkey-kind, which uſe only but one hand on thoſe occaſions, whereas the
          racoon and the ſquirrel, uſe both; as wanting the thumb, their paws
          ſingly are unfit for graſping or holding; tho' this animal be ſhort and

          claws, enable it to climb trees with great facility; it runs on the trunk with
          the ſame ſwiftneſs that it moves upon the plain, and ſports among the
          moſt extreme branches with great agility, ſecurity and eaſe; it moves
          forward chiefly by bounding, and tho' it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in an oblique direction, it
          has ſpeed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough moſt frequently to eſcape its purſuers.</p>
            <p>This animal is a native of the ſouthern parts of America, nor have
          any travellers mentioned its being found in the Ancient Continent. But in the
          climates of which it is a native; it is found in noxious abundance,
          particularly in Jamaica, where it keeps in the mountains, and where it often
          deſcends to feed upon the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of ſugar-cane. The planters of
          theſe climates, conſider theſe animals as one of their greateſt
          miſeries; they have contrived various methods of deſtroying them, yet
          ſtill they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate in ſuch numbers, that neither traps nor fire-arms can
          ſet them free; ſo that a ſwarm of theſe famiſhed creatures are found
          to do more injury in a ſingle night, than the labours of a month can
          repair.</p>
            <p>But tho', when wild they are thus troubleſome, in a ſtate of
          tameneſs no animal is more harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs or amuſing; they are capable of
          being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in various little amuſing tricks. The 
          <pb n="335" facs="tcp:0823900104:447"/> racoon is playful and cleanly, and is very eaſily
          ſupported; it eats of every thing that's given it, and if left to itſelf,
          no cat can be a better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vider; it examines every corner, eats of all
          fleſh, either boiled or raw, eggs, fruits or corn, inſects themſelves
          cannot eſcape it, and if left at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a garden, it will feed upon
          ſnails, worms and beetles; but it has a particular fondneſs for ſweets of
          every kind, and to be poſſeſt of theſe in its wild ſtate, it incurs
          every danger. Though it will eat its proviſions dry, it will for choice dip
          them in water if it happens to be in the way; it has one particularity which
          few other animals have been found to poſſeſs, it drinks as well by
          lapping, like the dog, as by ſucking like the horſe.</p>

            <p>THE firſt peculiarity with which this animal ſtrikes the
          ſpectator, is the extreme length of its ſnout, which in ſome meaſure
          reſembles that of the hog, but elongated to a ſurprizing degree; it bears
          ſome diſtant reſemblance to the animal laſt deſcribed, except that
          the neck and the body are longer, the fur ſhorter, and the eyes ſmaller;
          but its principal diſtinction, as was ſaid before, conſiſts in the
          ſhape of its noſe, the upper jaw being an inch longer than the lower, and
          the ſnout, which is moveable in every diviſion, turning up at the end. Like
          the racoon, it ſets up on its hinder legs with great eaſe, and in this
          poſition, with both paws, carries the food to its mouth.</p>
            <p>This animal is very ſubject to eat its own tail, which is rather

            <head>CHAP. XXI. Of the Ant-Bear.</head>
            <p>THERE are many animals that live upon ants in Africa and America;
          the pangolin or ſcaly lizard of Guinea may be conſidered among this number;
          but there are a greater variety in America, which makes thoſe minute
          inſects their only ſubſiſtence. Though they are of different figures
          and ſizes, yet in general they go under one common name of the ant-bear; the
          peculiar length and ſlenderneſs of their ſnout, their ſingular
          appetites, and their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of taking their prey, ſtriking us too
          ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to attend to the minute differences of their ſize or form.</p>
            <p>They have been claſſed by Mr. Buffon into the larger tamandua,
          the ſmaller tamandua, and the ant-eater. The longeſt of this kind is four
          feet long, from the tip of the ſnout to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the tail; their
          legs are ſhort and arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with four ſtrong claws; their tail is long and
          tuffy, and the animal often throws it on <pb facs="tcp:0823900104:454"/>

          like the ſquirrel. The ſecond of this kind is not above eighteen inches
          long, the tail is without hair, and it ſweeps the ground as the animal moves.
          The ant-eater, which is the third variety, is ſtill ſmaller than either of
          the former, as it is not above ſeven inches from the tip of the ſnout to
          the inſertion of the tail. The two former are of a brown duſky colour, but
          this of a beautiful reddiſh, mixed with yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; tho' they differ in figure,
          they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble each other in one peculiarity, which is the extreme
          ſlenderneſs of their ſnout, and the amazing length of their tongue.</p>
            <p>The ſnout is produced in ſo diſproportionate a manner, that
          the length of it makes near a fourth part of the whole figure. A horſe has
          one of the longeſt heads of any animal we know, and yet the ant-bear has one
          above twice as long, in proportion to its body. The ſnout of this animal is
          almoſt round and cylindrical; it is extremely ſlender, and is ſcarce
          thicker near the eyes than at its extremity. The mouth is very ſmall, the
          noſtrils are very cloſe to each other, the eyes are little, in proportion
          to the length of the noſe, the neck is ſhort, the tongue is extremely long,
          ſlender, and flatted on both ſides; this it keeps generally doubled up in
          the mouth, and is the only inſtrument by <pb n="340" facs="tcp:0823900104:458"/> which it
          finds ſubſiſtence; for the whole of this tribe are entirely without
          teeth, and find ſafety only in the remoteneſs and ſecurity of their
          retreat.</p>
            <p>If we examine through the various regions of the earth, we ſhall
          find that all the moſt active, ſprightly,
          <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd uſeful quadrupedes have been
          gathered round man, and either ſerved his pleaſures, or ſtill maintained
          their indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by their vigilance, their cunning, or their induſtry. It
          is in the remote ſolitudes that we are to look for the helpleſs, the
          deformed, and the monſtrous births of nature. Theſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed animals being
          incapable of defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, either by their agility, or their natural
          arms, fall a prey to every creature that attacks them; they therefore retire
          for ſafety into the darkeſt foreſts, or the moſt deſart mountains,
          where none of the bolder, or ſwifter animals chuſe to reſide.</p>
            <p>It may well be ſuppoſed that an animal ſo helpleſs as the
          ant-bear is, with legs too ſhort to fit it for flight, and unprovided with
          teeth to give it a power of reſiſtance, is neither nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, nor often
          ſeen; its retreats are in the moſt barren and uncultivated parts of
          South-America. It is a native only of the new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and intirely unknown
          to the old. It <pb n="341" facs="tcp:0823900104:459"/> lives chiefly in the woods, and hides
          itſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fallen leaves. It ſeldom ventures from its retreat, and
          the induſtry of an hour ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it with ſufficient food for ſeveral
          days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Its manner of procuring its prey, is one of the moſt
          ſingular in all natural hiſtory; as its name implies, it lives entirely
          upon ants and inſects; theſe, in the countries where it is bred, are found
          in the greateſt abundance, and often build themſelves hills, five or ſix
          feet high, where they live in community. When this animal approaches an
          ant-hill, it creeps ſlowly forward on its belly, taking every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution to
          keep itſelf concealed, till it comes within a proper diſtance of the place
          where it intends to make its banquet; there lying cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly along at its
          length, it thruſts forth its round red tongue, which is often two feet long,
          acroſs the path of theſe buſy inſects, and there lets it lye
          motionleſs for ſeveral minutes together. The ants of that country, ſome
          of which are half an inch long, conſidering it as a piece of fleſh
          accidentally thrown before them, come forth and ſwarm upon it in great
          numbers, but wherever they touch, they ſtick; for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is
          covered with a ſlimy fluid, which like bird-lime, entangles every creature
          that lights upon it. When therefore the ant-bear <pb n="342" facs="tcp:0823900104:460"/> has
          found a ſufficient number for one morſel, it inſtantly draws in the
          tongue, and devours them all in a moment; after which it ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in
          its poſition, practiſing the ſame arts until its hunger is entirely
          appeaſed; it then retires to its hiding-place once more, where it continues
          in indolent exiſtence, till again excited by the calls of hunger.</p>
            <p>Such is the luxurious life of a creature, that ſeems of all others
          the moſt helpleſs and deformed. It finds ſafety in its hiding-places from
          its enemies, and an ample ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in ſome neighbouring ant-hill, for all
          its appetites. As it only tries to avoid its pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers, it is ſeldom
          diſcovered by them; yet helpleſs as this animal is, when driven to an
          extremity, though without teeth, it will fight with its claws, with great
          obſtinacy. With theſe arms alone, it has often been found to oppoſe the
          dog, and even the Jaguar. It throws itſelf upon its back, faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens upon its
          enemy with all its claws, ſticks with great ſtrength and perſeverance,
          and even after killing its invader, which is ſometimes the caſe, does not
          quit its hold, but remains faſtened upon him with vindic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
          deſperation.</p>

               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:0823900104:462"/>OF the ſloth there are two different kinds,
          diſtinguiſhed from each other by their claws; the one, which in its native
          country is called the unan, having only two claws upon each foot, and being
          without a tail; the other, which is called the ai, having a tail and three
          claws upon each foot. The unan has the ſnout longer, the ears more apparent,
          and the fur very different from the other. It differs alſo in the number of
          its ribs, this having forty-ſix, while the ai has but twenty-eight. Theſe
          dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, however, which though very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, have been but little
          regarded in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of two animals which ſo ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
          each other in the general out-lines of their figure, in their appetites, and
          their help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs formation.</p>
            <p>They are both, therefore, deſcribed under the common appellation
          of the ſloth, and their habitudes well deſerve our wonder and curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.

               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:0823900104:465"/> Nature ſeems cramped and conſtrained in their
          formation; other animals are often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent from choice, theſe are ſlow
          from neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the ai, from which I ſhall take my deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and
          from which the other differs only in the ſlight particulars above-mentioned,
          and in being rather more active, is of about the ſize of a badger. Its fur is
          coarſe and ſtaring, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſembling dried graſs; the tail very
          ſhort, and ſcarce appearing; the mouth extending from ear to ear; the eye
          dull and heavy; the feet armed with three claws each, and made ſo ſhort,
          and ſet on ſo aukwardly, that a few paces is often the journey of a week;
          but though the feet are ſhort, they are ſtill longer than its legs, and
          theſe proceed from the body in ſuch an oblique direction, that the ſole
          of the foot ſeldom touches the ground. When the animal therefore is compelled
          to make a ſtep forward, it ſcrapes on the back of the nails along the
          ſurface, and wheeling the limbs circularly about, yet ſtill touching the
          ground, it at length places its foot in a progreſſive poſition; the other
          three limbs are all brought about with the ſame dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; and thus it is
          ſeen to move, not above three feet in an hour. In fact, this poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
          ſeldom changes place but by conſtraint, and when impelled by the
          ſevereſt ſtings of hunger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:0823900104:466"/>The ſloth ſeems to be the meaneſt and
          moſt ill-formed of all thoſe animals that chew the cud; it lives entirely
          upon vegetable food, on the leaves, the fruit, and the flowers of trees, and
          often even on the very bark, when nothing elſe is left on the tree for its
          ſubſiſtence. Like all other ruminant animals, it has four ſtomachs; and
          theſe requiring a large ſhare of proviſion to ſupply them, it generally
          ſtrips a tree of all its verdure in leſs than a fortnight. Still how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
          it keeps aloft, unwilling to deſcend, while any thing remains that can
          ſerve it for food; it therefore falls to devouring the bark, and thus in a
          ſhort time kills the tree upon which it found its ſupport. Thus deſtitute
          of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions above, and crawling ſlowly from branch to branch, in hopes
          of finding ſomething ſtill left, it is at laſt obliged to encounter all
          the dangers that attend it below. Though it is formed by nature for climbing a
          tree with great pain and difficulty, yet it is utterly unable to deſcend; it
          therefore is obliged to drop from the branches to the ground, and as it is
          inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of exerting itſelf to break the violence of its deſcent, it
          drops like a ſhapeleſs heavy maſs, and feels no ſmall ſhock in the
          fall. There, after remaining ſome time torpid, it prepares for a journey to
          ſome neighbouring tree; but <pb n="346" facs="tcp:0823900104:467"/> this of all migrations is
          the moſt tedious, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and painful; it often takes a week in crawling
          to a tree not fifty yards diſtant; it moves with imperceptible ſlowneſs,
          and often baits by the way. All motions ſeem to torture it, every ſtep it
          takes it ſets forth a moſt plaintive, melancholy cry, which from ſome
          diſtant ſimilitude to the human voice, excites a kind of diſguſt, mixed
          with pity. This plaintive ſound ſeems its chief defence, few quadrupedes
          appear willing to interrupt its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, either that the fleſh is
          offenſive, or that they are terrified at its cries. When at length they reach
          their deſtined tree, they mount it with much greater eaſe than when they
          moved upon the plain. They fall to with famiſhed appetite, and as before,
          deſtroy the very ſource that ſupplies them.</p>
            <p>How far theſe may be conſidered as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiſhed productions
          of nature, I will not take upon me to determine; if we meaſure their
          happineſs by our ſenſations, nothing, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, can be more
          miſerable; but it is probable, conſidered with regard to themſelves, they
          may have ſome ſtores of comfort unknown to us, which may ſet them upon a
          level with ſome other inferior ranks of the creation; if a part of their life
          be expoſed to pain and labour, it <pb n="347" facs="tcp:0823900104:468"/> is compenſated by
          a larger portion of plenty, indolence, and ſafety. In fact, they are formed
          very differently from all other quadrupedes, and it is probable, they have
          different enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Like birds, they have but one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vent for the
          purpoſes of propagation, excrement, and urine. Like the tortoiſe, which
          they reſemble, in the ſlowneſs of their motion, they continue to live
          ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their nobler parts are wounded, or even taken away. They
          bear the marks of all thoſe comely-formed animals, that like rude machines
          are not eaſily diſcompoſed.</p>

          Its note, according to Kircher, is an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending and deſcending hexachord,
          which it utters only by night; its look is ſo piteous, as to move
          compaſſion; it is alſo accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with tears, that diſſuade every

            <head>CHAP. XXIII. The Gerbua.</head>
            <p>THIS animal as little reſembles a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupede, as that which has
          been deſcribed in a former chapter. If we ſhould ſuppoſe a bird,
          diveſted of its feathers, and walking upon its legs, it might give us ſome
          idea of its figure. It has four feet indeed, but in running or reſting, it
          never makes uſe of any but the hinder. The number of legs, however, do not
          much contribute to any animal's ſpeed; and the gerbua, though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
          ſpeaking, furniſhed but with two, is one of the ſwifteſt creatures in
          the world.</p>
            <p>The gerbua is not above the ſize of a large rat, and its head is
          ſloped ſomewhat in the manner of a rabbit, the teeth alſo are formed like
          thoſe of the rat kind, there being two cutting teeth in each jaw; it has a
          very long tail, tufted at the end; the head, the back, and ſides are covered
          with large aſh-coloured ſoft hair; the breaſt and belly is whitiſh, but
          what moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves <pb n="350" facs="tcp:0823900104:471"/> our attention in the formation
          of this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle animal, is the legs; the fore-legs are not an inch long, with
          four claws and a thumb upon each, while the hinder-legs are two inches and a
          quarter, and exactly reſemble thoſe of a bird, there being but three toes,
          the middlemoſt of which is longeſt.</p>
            <p>The gerbua is found in Egypt, Barbary, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine, and the
          deſarts between Buſſerah and Aleppo; its hind-legs, as was ſaid before,
          are only uſed in running, while the fore-paws, like thoſe of a ſquirrel,
          graſp its food, and in ſome meaſure perform the office of hands. It is
          of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeen by travellers as they paſs along the deſarts, croſſing
          their way, and jumping ſix or eight feet at every bound, and going ſo
          ſwiftly, that ſcarce any other quadrupede is able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them. They
          are a lively, harmleſs race of animals, living entirely upon vegetables, and
          burrowing like rabbits in the ground. Mr. Pennant tells us of two that were
          lately brought to London, that burrowed almoſt through the brick wall of the
          room where they were kept; they came out of their hole at night for food, and
          when caught, were much fatter and ſlicker than when confined to their
          burrows. A variety of this animal is found alſo in Siberia and
          Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſia, and is moſt probably, common enough <pb n="351" facs="tcp:0823900104:473"/>
          over all Aſia. They are more expert diggers than even the rabbit itſelf;
          and when purſued for a long time, if they cannot eſcape by their
          ſwiftneſs, they try to make a hole inſtantly in the ground, in which they
          often bury themſelves deep enough to find ſecurity before their purſuers
          come up. Their burrows, in ſome places, are ſo thick, as to be dangerous to
          travellers, the horſes perpetually falling in them. It is a provident little
          animal, and lays up for the winter. It cuts graſs in heaps of a foot
          ſquare, which when dried, it carries into its burrow, therewith to ſerve it
          for food, or to keep its young warm during the rigours of the winter.</p>
            <p>But of all animals of this kind, that which was firſt diſcovered
          and deſcribed by Mr. Banks, is the moſt extraordinary. He calls it the
          kan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guroo; and though from its general outline, and the moſt ſtriking
          peculiarities of its figure, it greatly reſembles the gerbua, yet it entirely
          differs, if we conſider its ſize, or thoſe minute diſtinctions which
          direct the makers of ſyſtems in aſſorting the general ranks of
          nature.</p>
            <p>The largeſt of the gerbua kind which are to be found in the
          ancient continent, do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the ſize of a rabbit. The kanguroo of New
          Holland, where it is only to be found, is <pb n="351" facs="tcp:0823900104:475"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" resp="#OXF" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:0823900104:476"/> often
          known to weigh above ſixty pounds, and muſt conſequently be as large as a
          ſheep. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſkin of that which was ſtuffed and brought home by
          Mr. Banks, was not much above the ſize of a hare, yet it was greatly
          ſuperiour to any of the gerbua kind that have been hitherto known, and very
          different in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars. The ſnout of the gerbua, as has been ſaid,
          is ſhort and round, that of the new-diſcovered animal long and ſlender;
          the teeth alſo entirely differ; for as the gerbua has but two cutting teeth
          in each jaw, making four in all, this animal, beſides its cutting teeth, has
          four canine teeth alſo; but what makes a more ſtriking peculiarity, is the
          formation of its low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er jaw, which, as the ingenious diſcoverer
          ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, is divided into two parts, which open and ſhut like a pair of
          ſciſſars, and cut graſs, probably this animal's principal food. The
          head, neck, and ſhoulders are very ſmall in proportion to the other parts
          of the body; the tail is nearly as long as the body, thick near the rump, and
          tapering towards the end, the ſkin is covered with a ſhort fur, excepting
          the head and the ears, which bear a ſlight reſemblance to thoſe of the
          hare. We are not told, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, from the formation of its ſtomach, to what
          claſs of quadrupedes it belongs, from its eating <pb n="353" facs="tcp:0823900104:477"/>
          graſs, which it has been ſeen to do; one would be apt to rank it among the
          ruminant animals, but from the canine teeth which it is found to have, we may
          on the other hand ſuppoſe it to bear ſome relation to the carnivorous.
          Upon the whole, however, it can be claſſed with none more properly, than
          with animals of the ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bua kind, as its hind legs are ſo much longer than
          the fore; it moves alſo preciſely in the ſame manner, taking great bounds
          of ten or twelve feet at a time, and thus ſometimes eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even the
          fleeteſt greyhound, with which Mr. Banks purſued it. One of them, that was
          killed, proved to be good food; but a ſecond, which weighed eighty-four
          pounds, and was not yet come to its full growth, was found to be much
          inferior.</p>
            <p>With this laſt deſcribed and laſt diſcovered animal, I
          ſhall conclude the hiſtory of quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes, which of all parts of natural
          knowledge ſeems to have been deſcribed the moſt accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. As theſe,
          from their figure, as well as their ſagacity, bear the neareſt
          reſemblance to man, and from their uſes or enmities are the moſt
          reſpectable parts of the inferior creation, ſo it was his intereſt, and
          his pleaſure, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acquainted with their hiſtory. It is
          proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble therefore that time, which enlarges the ſphere 
          <pb n="354" facs="tcp:0823900104:478"/> of our knowledge in other parts of learning, can add but
          very little to this. The addition of a new quadrupede to the catalogue already
          known, is of no ſmall conſequence, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens but ſeldom; for the
          number of all is ſo few, that wherever a new one is found, it becomes an
          object worthy our beſt attention. It may take refuge in its native deſarts
          from our purſuits, but not from our curioſity.</p>
            <p>But it is very different with the inferior ranks of the creation;
          the claſſes of birds, of fiſhes, and of inſects, are all much more
          nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and more incompletely known. The quadrupede is poſſeſſed of
          no arts of eſcaping, which we are not able to overcome; but the bird removes
          itſelf by its ſwiftneſs, the fiſhes find protection in their native
          element, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects are ſecured in their minuteneſs, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and
          variety. Of all theſe therefore, we have but a very inadequate catalogue, and
          though the liſt be already very large, yet every hour is adding to its
          extent.</p>
            <p>In fact, all knowledge is pleaſant only as the object of it
          contributes to render man happy, and the ſervices of quadrupedes being ſo
          very neceſſary to him in every ſituation, he is particularly intereſted
          in their hiſtory: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their aid, what a wretched and forlorn 
          <pb n="355" facs="tcp:0823900104:479"/> creature would he have been! the principal part of his
          food, his cloathing, and his amuſements are derived wholly from them, and he
          may be conſidered as a great lord, ſometimes cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his humble
          dependants, and ſometimes ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying the refractory, to contribute to his
          de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and conveniencies.</p>
            <p>The horſe and the aſs, the elephant, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, the lama, and
          the rein-deer, contribute to eaſe his fatigues, and to give him that
          ſwiftneſs which he wants from nature. By their aſſiſtance, he changes
          place without labour; he attains health without wearineſs; his pride is
          inlarged by the elegance of equipage, and other animals are purſued with a
          certainty of ſucceſs. It were happy indeed for man, if while converting
          theſe quadrupedes to his own benefit, he had not turned them to the
          deſtruction of his fellow-creatures; he has employed ſome of them for the
          purpoſes of war, and they have conformed to his noxious ambition with but too
          fatal an obedience.</p>
            <p>The cow, the ſheep, the deer, and all their varieties, are
          neceſſary to him, though in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner. Their fleſh makes the
          princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal luxuries of his table, and their wool or ſkins the chief ornament
          of his perſon. Even thoſe nations that are forbid to touch 
          <pb n="356" facs="tcp:0823900104:480"/> any thing that has life, cannot wholly diſpenſe with
          their aſſiſtance. The milk of theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals makes a principal part of
          the food of every country, and often repairs thoſe conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions that have
          been broken by diſeaſe or intemperance.</p>
            <p>The dog, the cat, and the ferret, may be conſidered as having
          deſerted from their fellow-quadrupedes, to liſt themſelves under the
          con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and protection of man. At his command they exert all their ſervices
          againſt ſuch ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals as they are capable of deſtroying, and follow them
          into places where he himſelf wants abilities to purſue.</p>
            <p>As there is thus a numerous tribe, that he has taken into
          protection, and that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies his neceſſities and amuſements, ſo
          there is alſo a ſtill more numerous one, that wages an unequal combat
          againſt him, and thus call forth his courage and his induſtry. Were it not
          for the lion, the tyger, the panther, the rhinoceros, and the bear, he would
          ſcarce know his own powers, and the ſuperiority of human art over brutal
          fierceneſs. Theſe ſerve to excite, and put his nobler paſſions into
          motion. He attacks them in their retreat, faces them with reſolution, and
          ſeldom fails of coming off with a victory. He thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes 
          <pb n="357" facs="tcp:0823900104:481"/> hardier and better in the ſtruggle, and learns to know
          and to value his own ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority.</p>
            <p>As the laſt mentioned animals are called forth by his boldeſt
          efforts, ſo the numerous tribe of the ſmaller vermin kind excite his
          continual vigilance and caution; his various arts and powers have been no where
          more manifeſt, than in the extirpation of thoſe that multiply with ſuch
          prodigious fecundity. Neither their agility nor their minuteneſs can ſecure
          them from his purſuits; and though they may infeſt, they are ſeldom found
          materially to injure him.</p>
            <p>In this manner we ſee, that not only human want is ſupplied, but
          that human wit is ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, by the humbler partners of man in the creation.
          By this we ſee, that not only their benefits, but their depredations are
          uſeful, and that it has wiſely pleaſed Providence to place us like
          victors in a ſubdued country, where we have all the benefit of conqueſt,
          without being ſo ſecure, as to run into the ſloth and exceſſes of a
          certain and undiſturbed poſſeſſion. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears therefore, that
          thoſe writers who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually finding immediate benefit in every
          pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, ſee but half way into the general ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of nature.
          Experience muſt every hour <pb n="538" facs="tcp:0823900104:482"/> inform us, that all animals
          are not formed for our uſe; but we may be equally well aſſured, that
          thoſe conveniencies which we want from their friendſhip, are well repaid by
          that vigilance which we procure from their enmity.</p>
