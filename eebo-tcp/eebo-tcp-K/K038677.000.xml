            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN firſt, of a thouſand times, I read theſe curious epiſtles, which here I conſecrate to rhime and immortality, when I found them equally fraught with hiſtorical truth, as with political wiſdom; equally diſtinguiſhed for elegance of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and accuracy of ſtyle, I lamented, that they were compoſed of periſhable, proſaick materials. With what ſincere concern did I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that they muſt ſoon, too ſoon! be loſt to remembrance, or be ſent, in their news-papers, perhaps, to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> to exerciſe the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm of ſugar-planters, Negroes, and Creolians? I deplored the fate of the great man, to whom the ſecond letter is addreſſed, whoſe <hi>good</hi> fame, <hi>o tempera, o mores!</hi> is hardly likely to ſurvive his virtue, even in a monument, erected to the VIRO IMMORTALI.</p>
            <p>I CONSIDERED from whence this calamity could ariſe, and I was immediately convinced, that if Homer had written the wrath of Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, or Virgil the loves of Dido in proſe, the hero and the heroine muſt have long ſince experienced the common fate of mortality. The Muſes, the Muſes alone have the privelege of giving immortality. <hi>Muſa vetat mori.</hi> Yet even the Muſes cannot give it in proſe. Shall it then hereafter be ſaid, that two ſuch perſonages, as theſe writers
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0290803600:3"/>
appear to be in each other's Letters; ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed for their integrity, patriotiſm, abilities, and how tender is the expreſſion! for their <hi>kind friendſhip,</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vid. Mr. P--t's Letter.</note> ſhall they die, like mere mortals, <hi>quia ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent vate ſacro</hi>; becauſe, <hi>No bard had they to make all time their own?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANIMATED by theſe, and other reflections, equally powerful, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſnatch theſe charming letters from oblivion; to give them to immortality, by <hi>doing</hi> them into verſe, as nearly as the different idioms of proſe and poetry can allow; and then to place them in friendly oppoſition to each other, like pictures hung in contraſt to illuſtrate each other's beauties.</p>
            <p>THAT they are equally ſuſceptible of all the moſt luxurious orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of poetry, every critick muſt allow; nor, if he be a critick of any tolerable ſagacity, can he heſitate, even a moment, in pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they are the works of the ſame maſter. Is there not the ſame everlaſting length of period, the ſame manly diſregard to gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar; the ſame looſe, unconnected texture of expreſſion; the ſame inconcluſive, unconſequential reaſoning, ſo peculiarly fitted to the freedom and eaſe of epiſtolary writing? Beauties, like theſe, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, have a kind of originality, which it is almoſt impoſſible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in a tranſlation. Yet the reader will find, it hath been boldly attempted, and his candour will determine, I hope, not unfavourably, of the ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>IN an humble conſciouſneſs of having merited that <hi>ſucceſs</hi> by the <hi>fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of this tranſlation, I ſhall venture to aſſert, what few modern tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators can preſume to aſſert, that it ſometimes riſes ſuperior, in ſublimity and beauty, even to the original. This ſuperiority, no doubt, proceeds
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0290803600:4"/>
from a ſecret charm, that in general, animates the language of poetry, and particularly from the harmony of the numbers, which I have, not injudiciouſly, choſen. Be it known, therefore to all our minor poets, that doggrel is the proper meaſure for the ſublime ideas of modern patriotiſm, panegyrick and addreſſes, of which I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world, as ſoon as a certain addreſs to his M----y, I beg pardon, I mean to his miniſter, ſhall make its appearance.</p>
            <p>BUT not panegyrick alone, nor patriotiſm have their proper and peculiar meaſures in poetry. When the ladies write love letters, all the numbers are elegiack. When our patriot-commoner raiſes his voice to aſſert the rights of the people; to deplore the errour of adminiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or to vindicate his own injured reputation from the miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of credulity and calumny, his diction inſtantly aſſumes the pomp of blank verſe. Laſtly, when Mr. P--t and Mr. B--d oblige the world with a private publick correſpondence, the mutual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of each other's merit; their <hi>kind</hi> profeſſions of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and eſteem naturally ſink together into doggrel.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, I am in chriſtian charity; I bear no malice to proſe or proſemen. I think it falls down very naturally in notes, remarks and annotations to the bottom of the page. Witneſs doctor W--n's two huge coloumns of criticiſm to ſupport and explain two lines of Mr. Pope's poetry. In humble imitation of this right-reverend canoniſt in criticiſm, I have bottomed my pages with notes <hi>variorum.</hi> I do not mean the <hi>variorum</hi> of perſons only, but of learning, morality, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm, politicks, and panegyrick. I confeſs, I have almoſt exhauſted my common place-book; no matter; I ſhall eaſily fill it again with quotations of learning from our illuſtrious moderns, and maxims of politicks from the common council at Guildhall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0290803600:5"/>THE publick, no doubt, ingratitude, as well as curioſity, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be informed, WHO and WHAT are the writers, to whom they are obliged for theſe letters: who have publiſhed them for their own <hi>ſpontaneous</hi> bounty, <hi>unſolicited,</hi> and <hi>unmerited,</hi> as the penſion of Kings: who is this right honourable perſon, and his friend Mr. -----: this <hi>pius Aeneas</hi> and his <hi>fidus Achiates</hi>; this ſecond Sir James H----s, who vouches for the ſentiments of the city.</p>
            <p>THE laſt Hague Gazette has tranſlated one of theſe letters into French, and aſſures us, that it is writen by the right honourable Mr. Pitt to the Lord Mayor of London, whom it frequently ſtyles, MON CHER MOXSIEUR. It likewiſe informs us, that Mr. Pitt, although diſmiſſed from his Office, yet regularly attends the frequent Councils held at Court. But as we have ſome reaſon to believe, that this intelligence is a little premature; that it is, at preſent, and probably will be for ever a miſtake, we may therefore believe, there may poſſibly be ſome miſtake in the other inſtance. If indeed it were only a trivial anachron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, in calling Mr. B----d, MY LORD; or might we think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick of the next Year's Mayorality, then would I cry out with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reggio, <hi>I too am a Painter.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>Then ſhould creolian B----d, like himſelf,</l>

            <p>Then ſhould he ſtand in Oratorial Attitude, haranguing, <hi>loud,</hi> His and his Friend's fifteen Aldermen; their hundred common-council.</p>

            <head>General REFLECTIONS upon theſe Letters.</head>
            <p>NEITHER in the Petulance of attempting to be a Wit, nor for the <hi>poor Renown of being ſmart,</hi> nor yet to vindicate, as may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſuſpected, my Reaſon by my Riſibility, did I aſſume the Tone and Air of Pleaſantry. The right honourable Perſon has made his Appeal to the Publick, and every Individual of that Publick is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to deliver his Sentiments upon it, in his own Manner, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Meaſure of his Knowledge, his Abilities and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. For my Part, I was determined to try the Gentleman's Conduct by every Kind of Proof, even by that of Ridicule. If he ſinks under this Proof, which is generally allowed to be no mean Teſt of Truth, his Reſignation is blameable; and then it is of little Importance, by what Forms of Trial he ſtands condemned. If he can ſtand this Proceſs, he will come forth from it, like Gold from the Furnace, brighter and purer, and certainly not injured in his Weight.</p>
            <p>SOME Expreſſions in theſe Papers may poſſibly be taxed with too much Levity, and others charged with too much Severity; yet when, in the firſt of theſe Letters, whoever <hi>withdraws his good Opinion</hi> from the right honourable Perſon is repreſented as <hi>capricious</hi> and <hi>ungenerous,</hi> and rated for <hi>a Credulity, weak as injurious</hi> (I preſume the Gentleman means unjuſt) when, in the ſecond Letter, all, who differ from the Writer's Sentiments, are frankly called Fools and Knaves, ſurely ſuch Coarſeneſs of Expreſſion will juſtify all Kinds of Language in return.</p>
            <p>I DO not make any over-earneſt Profeſſions of my own Impartiality. I do not think myſelf exempted from that common Lot of all human
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0290803600:19"/>
Underſtandings, the being placed between Reaſon and Paſſion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Prejudice and Impartiality. I greatly fear, that our Friends are not always impartial; I truly believe, that our Enemies are not always malignant.</p>
            <p>I CONFESS, I did not imagine this extraordinary Reſignation was an Object of ſuch preſent Importance, or probably productive of ſuch future Conſequences, either good or evil, as to require any mighty Solemnity in the Manner of treating it; and perhaps the following Reflexions may convince my Readers, it was not for want of many a ſerious Argument, that I have choſen thoſe of Raillery and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule. But here let me be permitted to lay before the Publick ſome Circumſtances concerning it, of which they have not yet been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and upon which they may with abſolute Certainty rely.</p>
            <p>WHEN the right honourable Gentleman entered into Miniſtry, he found every thing yielding to his Ambition. The late King, whoſe Love for his native Country may juſtly be numbered among his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, muſt have certainly been highly ſatisfied with a Miniſter, who ſo largely gratified his favourite Paſſion: who poured forth the Blood and Treaſures of Great Britain into Hanover, with a Profuſion, which no other Miniſter durſt have ventured, or muſt have ventured at the Hazard of his Head. Such were the effects of that Influence, which he had gained over the People, by repeated Profeſſions of his Zeal for their Service; as if their Intereſts were not united with thoſe of the other great Members of the State, or as if they could, even in Idea, be ſeparated from thoſe of the Sovereign. His Majeſty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in council ſilently acquieſced (nor would I willingly impute it to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0290803600:20"/>
them as a Crime) in this continental Prodigality. Every part of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration concurred in a Compliance with his Directions; I am aſhamed to ſay, in an implicite Obedience to his Commands. Fleets were equipped; Regiments were raiſed, Expeditions appointed, and the Treaſury gave forth its Millions to his Order.</p>
            <p>THUS did he exerciſe a Kind of Deſpotiſm, unknown to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and deſtructive of every Idea of Liberty, until he was oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the firſt Time even by his own Account oppoſed, in a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure too precipitate, too important and too unjuſt, to be complied with either by his Majeſty, or his Servants. He propoſed an immediate Declaration of War againſt Spain, at a Time, when ſhe was giving us every Aſſurance of her Inclination to preſerve the Peace and Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſubſiſting between the two Nations, and which it is their mutual Intereſt to preſerve.</p>
            <p>IT is hardly conceivable, that he could either deſire, or expect to ſucceed in ſuch an extravagant Propoſal. What! to declare War, and commence Hoſtilities againſt a friendly Nation, without aſking a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for any ſuppoſed Inſults, a Redreſs of Injuries, or even an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of Grievances! The Laws of Nature and Nations; the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of Treaties; the common Senſe of Equity and Reaſon equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſclaim a Proceeding, as unjuſt, as precipitate.</p>
            <p>BUT what have the Spaniards <hi>already done</hi> to provoke the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Indignation, and juſtify his Reſentment? He neither urged any particular Inſtance of their Partiality to the French; nor any new Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of our long-conteſted Rights to cutting Logwood, nor even their Injuſtice with regard to the Antigallican and her Prize, which, beſides ſome other Indignities, he temperately endured through the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0290803600:21"/>
whole Courſe of his adminiſtration. But, ſo it ſeems, the Fulneſs of Time for his reſigning was not yet arrived; he was not yet tired of <hi>guiding</hi> and governing. But when he had taken a nearer View of the Port, to which the Veſſel was driving with all the Sails he had crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her; when he ſaw the Rocks and Shallows and Breakers, that threatened his Entrance into the Harbour; when he ſaw the Coaſt covered with the ſhip-wrecked Reputations of former Miniſters, he prudently quitted the Helm, and retired, a ſimple Paſſenger, to his Cabin.</p>
            <p>BUT really what had Spain <hi>already done?</hi> She had written to France to deſire her good Offices with Great Britain; that when her Miniſter was forming the general Articles of Peace, he might likewiſe pay ſome Attention to certain Matters of mutual Complaint between us and the Spaniards, which might poſſibly occaſion ſome future Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture between the two Kingdoms, and diſturb the Tranquility of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. What is there either ſo injurious, or offenſive in this Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that could have juſtified the Nation in declaring War, or could particularly juſtify the Miniſter, who had borne, with rather a too paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Spirit, ſome real Indignities from the Spaniards; ſome real Injuſtice.</p>
            <p>MR. BUSSY probably exceeded his Commiſſion, or executed it with Inſolence; or if this Letter could reaſonably give Umbrage to us, why not call for an Explanation of it? Why not demand a Copy of it, and if denied—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"No: the Spaniards will certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare War againſt us. Let us prevent them."</q> When it was urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they would think twice before they declared War againſt this Kingdom: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I will not give them Leave to think,"</q> was the ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Anſwer of our Miniſter. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"This is the Time; let us cruſh the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0290803600:22"/>
whole Houſe of Bourbon. But, if the Members of this Board are of another Opinion, this is the laſt Time I ſhall ever mix in its Councils. I was called into Miniſtry by the Voice of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to them I hold myſelf anſwerable for my Conduct. I am to thank the Miniſters of the <hi>late</hi> King for their Support. I have ſerved my Country with Succeſs, but I will not be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponſible for the Conduct of the War any longer, than while I have the Direction of it."</q> This laſt Declaration was by no means equivocal. It was a frank and open Demand of an unlimited Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and unconditional Obedience.</p>
            <p>THE noble Lord, who preſided in this Council; to whom Years have added the Wiſdom of Experience without abating the Vigour and Fire of Youth; whoſe natural and acquired Abilities are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable as great, as ever this Gentleman could boaſt; who was himſelf as bold a Miniſter, as ever directed the Affairs of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made him this temperate Reply. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I find the Gentleman is determined to leave us, nor can I ſay, I am ſorry for it; ſince he would otherwiſe have certainly compelled us to leave <hi>Him.</hi> But, if he be reſolved to aſſume the Right of adviſing his Majeſty, and directing the Operations of the War, to what purpoſe are we called to this Council? When he talks of being reſponſible to the People, he talks the Language of the Houſe of Commons, and forgets, that at this Board, he is only reſponſible to the King. However, though he may poſſibly have convinced himſelf of his Infallibility, ſtill it remains, that we ſhould be equally convinced before we can reſign our Underſtandings to his Direction, or join with him in the Meaſure he propoſes."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0290803600:23"/>HE bore the Rebukings of this Anſwer without making any Reply, but he had gone too far, though perhaps not without repenting, to retreat. He therefore reſigned the Seals, which were received with an Eaſe and Firmneſs, that he probably very little expected. The King, with his uſual Goodneſs, expreſſed his Concern for the Loſs of ſo able a Servant, and to ſhew the favourable Senſe he entertained of his Services, was graciouſly pleaſed to make him an Offer of any Rewards in the Power of the Crown to beſtow. His Majeſty then added, with regard to the Meaſure propoſed, that he would certainly have found Himſelf under the greateſt Difficulty, how to have acted, even though the whole Council had concurred in ſupporting it. A Sentiment of infinite Honour to him, who uttered it, not only as it aſſerts a royal Prerogative, which for the Good of his People He ſhould ever preſerve, but as it vindicates thoſe nobler Prerogatives of his Reaſon, his Underſtanding and his Conſcience. But theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, in all Probability, the right honourable Gentlemàn never thought of. However, this Condeſcenſion, with which he was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, affected him ſtrongly. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I confeſs, Sir, I had but too much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect your Majeſty Diſpleaſure. I did not come prepared for this exceeding Goodneſs. Pardon me Sir,—it over-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; it oppreſſes me."</q> He burſt into Tears.</p>
            <p>HIS Lady's Title, and his own Penſion, were ſettled next Day between Lord Bute and Him; when certainly the Title, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the Sum of the Penſion, was of his own <hi>free</hi> Choice. His Friends at firſt, warmly diſclaimed the Inſinuation of his taking a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. They called it a baſe and momentary Artifice to blaſt his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. They diſdained his receiving any Honours from a Maſter, whom he no longer thought proper to ſerve. "What Title," thus
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0290803600:24"/>
they exclaimed, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"can be half ſo honourable, as being ſtyled the Patriot Miniſter; the Miniſter of the People? What Honour can deſcend to his Poſterity, equal to the hiſtorical Truth, that he has ſaved his Country from Ruin and Reproach; that he has raiſed her to Glory and Happineſs?"</q> But ſince it is no longer an Inſinuation, that he has received his Penſion; ſince his accepting a Title for his Lady can be no longer an <hi>Artifice of his Enemies,</hi> his Friends endeavour to defend his <hi>blaſted</hi> Reputation.</p>
            <p>THE beſt attempt for this Purpoſe, yet offered to the publick, is in a Pamphlet, entitled, <hi>The Conduct of a right honourable Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, juſtified by Facts, and upon the Principles of the Britiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</hi> It is written with Temper, and has a Degree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, though certainly not that of the Britiſh Conſtitution, rarely found among us Pamphleteers. His firſt Propoſition is, <hi>that</hi> Mr. Pitt <hi>could not, conſiſtently with his own Safety, continue in the high Poſt he held, after being forced to deviate from the great Lines of conduct he had chalked out when he firſt entered upon it.</hi> In page 44, he tells us, <hi>thus, I think, I have fully demonſtrated my firſt Propoſition.</hi> As he has not thought proper to inform us what theſe <hi>great Lines of Conduct</hi> are (perhaps not much ſtraighter than Hogarth's Line of Beauty) from whence the right honourable Perſon <hi>was forced to deviate</hi>; nor told us, why, or by whom he was thus forced, we cannot be quite convinced, that he has demonſtrated his firſt Propoſition. But how demonſtrated? By a tedious Detail of Injuries, committed againſt us by Spain: a Detail of uncertain, unauthenticated Facts. Let me not ſeem to ſuſpect the Writer's own Belief of theſe Facts, but granting them true; granting, that Mr. Pitt was convinced of their Truth, yet it never can be demonſtrated either from their Truth, or

his Conviction, that his Reſignation was neceſſary to his Safety. The Rectitude or Error of his conduct in this Inſtance ariſes from the Reaſon, which he himſelf hath given for it, that he was <hi>no longer allowed to guide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE great Chillingworth repeatedly cries out, the Bible, the Bible is the Religion of Proteſtants. Thus would I repeat, the Law, the Law is the Britiſh Conſtitution. Where therefore is the Law, by which Mr. Pitt's Safety could have been affected, if he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in Office, after the Meaſure he propoſed of declaring War againſt Spain was rejected? <q rend="inline margQuotes">"But evil Councellors are liable by the Law to puniſhment."</q> True; and may they ever be liable. Yet the Miniſter, who does not give any Counſel; who enters his Proteſt againſt the Counſel, given by others, ſhall be liable to Puniſhment, as an evil Counſellor? If for the ſake of preſerving that unanimity, ſo neceſſary at this dangerous Criſis of our Affairs; if in a modeſt Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of his own Judgment, or a leſs outrageous Contempt for that of others, Mr. Pitt had ſilently complied with the united Opinions of His Majeſty, and all the Members of the Cabinet, could ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance ever be imputed to him as a Crime; could it endanger his Safety? If there be any Law, that declares the Guilt of ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, or threatens his Safety for it, let it be produced; or let it never be urged hereafter, even by his Fears, whether they be real or affected.</p>
            <p>OUR Writer, ſo learned in the <hi>Principles and Maxims of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Conſtitution,</hi> is candid enough to acknowledge, Pag. 51. <hi>that neither the Conſtitution, nor Laws of this Country define the poſt or power of a Miniſter of State, or even ſuppoſe, that any ſuch can exiſt.</hi> True
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0290803600:26"/>
indeed. The Conſtitution diſclaims, abhors and dreads even the Idea of ſuch a Miniſter. Yet, ſtrange proof how a bad cauſe can pervert a good Underſtanding! The very Gentleman, who makes this candid Conceſſion, founds Mr. Pitt's Defence upon his being not only a Miniſter, but <hi>a firſt, a directing</hi> Miniſter: Terms, as new as unknown to the Conſtitution as that of <hi>guiding,</hi> and as heartily to be deteſted.</p>
            <p>IT is the peculiar Excellence of this Conſtitution, that the Powers of Government are divided among the three Eſtates of which it is compoſed. Should any one of theſe Eſtates become poſſeſſed of more than its proper ſhare of Power, the Conſtitution, with all its Bleſſings of Religion, Liberty, and Property, is inſtantly diſſolved. The King becomes a Tyrant, the Houſe of Lords an Ariſtocracy, and the People a Democracy. Shall one Man therefore, a ſimple Citizen, dare to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to himſelf all the different Powers of Government? Shall he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to make War and Peace? Shall he raiſe Armies, fit out Fleets, plan Expeditions, and laviſh away the publick Treaſure, under this new-invented Title, <hi>a guiding</hi> Miniſter? The very Claim of ſuch a Power is an inſolent Outrage to the Laws, the Conſtitution, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of our Country, and this Right Honourable Perſon is the firſt, that ever made this outrageous Claim. If any one Man were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of executing ſuch a Power, yet never ſhould it be intruſted, (I ſpeak with all poſſible Reverence and Reſpect,) no, not for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any one Man, even to THE BEST OF SOVEREIGNS.</p>
            <p>IF among the great Lines of this Gentleman's Conduct, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined never to join in any Meaſure, which he was not <hi>allowed to guide</hi>; or in ſomewhat modeſter Language, if he reſolved to reſign,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0290803600:27"/>
whenever he was unable to convince the other Members of the Council, of the Wiſdom, the Juſtice, or Utility of the Meaſures he propoſed, permit me to aſk, what muſt be the Conſequence, if every other Member, (and his equal Right, I preſume, will not be denied) ſhould take the ſame Reſolution? In vain will his Majeſty call to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a Number of his Servants for their Advice in Matters of Doubt and Importance, if each of them in his Turn, may withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his Duty to his Country, for I preſume ſuch a Duty will be acknowledged, whenever his Opinion is contradicted.</p>
            <p>BUT it ſeems the right honourable Perſon is not diſabled by his Reſignation, <hi>from offering his opinion to his Majeſty, his Parliament and his Council with as much Freedom, and with more weight, than he could have had, had he retained the Seals of his Office.</hi> In what manner he will exert his Abilities, or ſhew forth his Zeal for his Country, and his inviolable Attachment to the Intereſts of the People, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably has not yet determined. Perhaps, he will endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Houſe of Commons, that he is endowed with ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Spirit, ſome certain ſuperior Inſtinct, fitted for planning and executing all the great Meaſures of Government. But I truly hold it of little Importance to the State of the Nation, whether he ſits in the ſilence of his Penſion, or riſes, in the Spleen of diſappointed Ambition, a futile Declaimer againſt the Meaſures of Government.</p>
