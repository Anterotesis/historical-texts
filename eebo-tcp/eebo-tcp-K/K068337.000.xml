            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>t and the Reaſon why they do now, and will ſtill remain <hi>Secrets,</hi> and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Hands, is for want of a <hi>Public</hi> Reward
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0154602300:4"/>being offer'd, equal to the Advantage a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man may make of them.</p>
            <p>IN other Countries, I find, the <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> is generally the Purchaſer of ſuch <hi>Secrets,</hi> and then generouſly publiſh them for the Good of all their Subjects; a piece of <hi>Policy,</hi> in my Opinion, in no wiſe contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and what can never be a dear Purchaſe or hard Bargain to a <hi>Crown'd Head</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT our <hi>Countrymen</hi> either having <hi>leſs Money,</hi> or <hi>more Frugality,</hi> go a cheaper way to work, and oblige their Authors and Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors either to run the Hazard of having their <hi>Secrets</hi> by ſome Accident or other diſcovered to the World, or to purchaſe a <hi>Patent</hi> under the Great Seal, for the Sole making, uſing or vending ſuch a Machine, Preparation or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medity, (of which the Patentee has prov'd himſelf the Original Author and Inventor) for a certain term of Years, on condition that he then publiſhes it to the World; a ſure way of ſaving their own Money, whatever the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may ſuffer in the mean time for want of ſuch a Publication: Beſides, all Men are not able to purchaſe a <hi>Patent,</hi> which will coſt no leſs than Sol. with an infinite deal of trouble to follow it through the various Offices to get it confirmed.</p>
            <p>Now for a Man to be a <hi>maſter</hi> of ſome <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,</hi> and not to be placed in ſuch a Station
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0154602300:5"/>as may Capacitate him to make a private Advantage of them, nor able to purchaſe a Patent, what has he elſe to do but make an <hi>Honeſt Publication</hi> of them, and leave the Conſequence to the <hi>Generoſity</hi> of the World; in compliance wherewith I take this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of publiſhing ſome curious and uſeful Preparations and Remedies as may be of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Advantage, nay I may ſafely ſay, that there are but ſew Families whoſe common Contingencies will not furniſh them with Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of experiencing many, if not moſt of them, in leſs than the Space of one Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Circumvolution; and as a Proof of the Truth of what I have hereafter offered, I will be always ready, not only to perform the Experimental Part of any, but likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the other Preparations herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, to Perſons of all or any Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that will ordinarily ſatisfie for ſuch Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Vomit</hi> herein diſcovered by far exceeds the Hypecacuana, (which coſts the late King of <hi>France</hi> no leſs than 1500 Piſtols) both for the certainty and eaſineſs of its Operation, as well as thoſe other good Effects which it generally produces; and what renders it ſtill more valuable is its readineſs to be come at, both in all Places and at all Times, it being a Root growing in moſt Yards and Gardens, and never, as I have yet ſeen, mentioned or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0154602300:6"/>accounted for by any Author: At Nantwytch in Cheſhire lives a Perſon who has acquired a large Eſtate by vertue of this incomparable <hi>Vomit</hi> only.</p>

            <p>THE famous <hi>Stiptick</hi> with which Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Read</hi> performed ſo many wonderful Cures, both <hi>outwardly</hi> and <hi>inwardly,</hi> is what I have very often experienc'd, and don't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it has ever once failed, it is a very eaſv and very cheap Preparation, and what no Family ought to be without.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Receipt</hi> which I have here given you for the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> is what I have often wiſh'd to have ſeen publiſh'd, becauſe of its ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing good Effects in the worſt Symptoms of the moſt dangerous kind; this I had from a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0154602300:7"/>very noted <hi>Nurſe</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> who told me it very rarely, if ever, failed of Succeſs. I had a Son about nine Years old ſeized with the worſt ſort of the Confluent Kind of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> intermixt with the <hi>Purples,</hi> for whom I had the Advice of two eminent Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians in <hi>London,</hi> notwithſtanding whoſe Skill and Care he died on the fourteenth Day; about three Weeks after, another Son of four Years old fell down with the ſame dangerous Confluent Kind, and very full of the Purples, and then it was I firſt heard of this notable Receipt, which had juſt recovered a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Child; I was perſwaded to uſe this, and to deſiſt from ſending for a Phyſician, and by God's Bleſſing it happily recovered my Child, in a Condition perhaps as bad as ever was ſeen; and I do verily believe it would have had the ſame Effect upon the other, had I but then known and uſed it; and tho I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it impoſſible to contrive an <hi>univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy</hi> in the Small-Pox, yet I am apt to think this Drink will do more good, and preſerve more lives than their <hi>new fangled</hi> and <hi>unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable</hi> way of <hi>Inoculation: Unjuſtifiable</hi> I call it, becauſe be the Practice never ſo laudable in ſome particular and far diſtant Places, yet no one can juſtify it in the middle of a large and populous Town, any more than a Man can juſtify the ſetting <hi>Fire</hi> to his own Houſe in the middle of a thick and cloſe built Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0154602300:8"/>nay 'tis certain, that by a parity of Reaſon, both the <hi>Inoculator</hi> and the <hi>Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated</hi> are liable to the ſame Proſecution with <hi>Highwaymen,</hi> who often ſuffer the Law when they have not actually robb'd a Man, but only for putting him in <hi>Bodily Fear,</hi> and theſe not only put whole Towns in <hi>Bodily Fears,</hi> but oftentimes prove the occaſion of the <hi>Death</hi> of many, which whether to call <hi>Manſlaughter</hi> or <hi>Murder</hi> I leave the World to judge.</p>
            <p>IF therefore ſome Men will be ſo hardy as to venture upon ſuch an uncertain Practice, they ought at their own Coſt and Charge to erect a <hi>Lazoretto</hi> or <hi>Bedlam,</hi> at ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient diſtance from a <hi>Town,</hi> and not near a <hi>Highway,</hi> and appoint Phyſicians and Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who are moſt zealous for ſuch Practice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to reſide there for the Reception and Care of ſuch <hi>Mad</hi> People as would either come themſelves, or ſend their Children; and not infect whole <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Countries</hi> as muſt neceſſarily be the Conſequence of their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Practice. I can't underſtand from the beſt Information I have been yet able to get, that this have ever been the Practice of any <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Countries,</hi> but uſed only among the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi> who hearing of our Ripeneſs for <hi>Infidelity,</hi> made a Preſent to us of this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom by the Hands of a <hi>Scotchman;</hi> and this I believe may be depended on, That the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

            </p>
            <p>MANY other good Receipts and Directions you'll find in this ſmall Book, which I gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly publiſh for the Benefit of Mankind in general, and hope the World will readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of, at a Price ſo ſmall, that it is hardly ſufficient to anſwer the Charge and Trouble of Printing and Publiſhing, but will be a means to introduce it into a greater number of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and prevent the copying out any of the Receipts herein contained.</p>

            <p>THIS Life is generally begun in <hi>Tears,</hi> continued in <hi>Uneaſineſs,</hi> and ended in <hi>Groans;</hi> and as Children are ſubject to vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſeaſes while they are yet in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb, and frequentl make their firſt Appearances with them, ſo I ſhall begin with them firſt.</p>
            <p>IT was the Practice of the late Sir <hi>David Hamilton,</hi> a famous Man-Midwife in <hi>London,</hi> to Vomit Children ſoon after they were born; and this was chiefly done to prevent ſore Mouths, which otherwiſe too frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and grievouſly torment the poor Infants; But ſince Nurſes are generally capable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging that Diſorder, I need not ſay any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0154602300:10"/>thing more concerning it, nor do I think it an eaſy matter to perſwade People to Vomit their Children, though nothing is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Flegmatic Conſtitutions, which almoſt immediately turns every thing ſour, and then coagulates, and makes Tough Flegm, which is generally the cauſe of Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages, by which many are thrown into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, and ſo die. Two or three Tea Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of the incomparable Vomit I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after diſcovered, ſweetned with a little Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, will operate as kindly, nay with more eaſe and as much ſafety as a larger Proportion for an adult Perſon.</p>
