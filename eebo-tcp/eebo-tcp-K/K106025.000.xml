            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE print prefixed, is rather given as a curioſity, than as preſenting an accurate portrait of this monarch. It is taken from a copy, in the collection of the earl of Buchan, from an ancient limning, formerly in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Arms, London.</p>
               <p>Alexander III. was born on the 4th of September, 1241. He aſcended the throne, a minor not eight years of age, 13th July 1249, on the death of his father Alexander II. His life was diſtinguiſhed by virtues; his reign by wiſdom and juſtice. His accidental death, on the 16th March 1286, left Scotland a prey to the ambition of the Engliſh monarch, Edward I.<note n="*" place="bottom">Annals of Scotland, by Sir David Dalrymple, vol. I. <hi>ſub annis.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>The coronation of Edward took place on the 19th of Auguſt, 1274. Alexander, with his queen, and many of his nobility, aſſiſted at the ceremony;<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> as did Llewellyn, prince of Wales. From the delineation here given, it alſo appears, that Alexander and Llewellyn ſat in the houſe of peers, in a parliament held, as uſual, after the inauguration.</p>
               <p>This repreſentation of the houſe of peers is curious and intereſting. The archbiſhops of Canterbury and York are ſeated ſomewhat lower than Alexander and Llewellyn: the
<pb facs="tcp:0823600300:10"/>two perſons behind the latter, are ſuppoſed to repreſent the pope's ambaſſadors: he behind Alexander to bear the deed of homage for the lands poſſeſſed by that monarch in England.

               </p>
               <p>In 1405, when he was about eleven years of age, he was ſent to France for his education, by his father Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert III.; but was captured by the Engliſh on his voyage;<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 439.

               <p>This captivity was nevertheleſs attended with eminent advantages. Nurtured in the ſchool of adverſity, his mind eagerly imbibed the elegant arts, and uſeful ſciences: and, on the 21ſt of May 1424,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Contin. of Fordun, II. 474.</note> he aſcended the throne of his fathers, perhaps the moſt accompliſhed ſovereign in Europe of his time.</p>
               <p>The regencies of Robert, and Murdac, dukes of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany, had been fertile in public abuſes: and the dilapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the royal lands and revenues, which they had ſhared among the nobles, in order to eſtabliſh their own power, expoſed the new ſovereign to a choice of difficulties. His reign muſt be degraded by penury; or rendered dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous by the arduous taſk of reſuming the royal patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. The ſpirit and genius of James preferred the latter alternative; and, after a long ſeries of national diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, the ſword of juſtice at length filled the hand of the monarch, and flaſhed in the eyes of an uſurping ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy. The moſt guilty of the public depredators fell
<pb facs="tcp:0823600300:13"/>under the axe of the law: neither rank, nor even royal blood, could ſave them from equal juſtice. Terror for a time ſeized the peers, and eſtabliſhed tranquillity. At length a conſpiracy was formed; and James periſhed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſword of an aſſaſſin, on the night between the 20th and 21ſt of February, 1437.<note n="*" place="bottom">Contin. of Fordun, II. 503.

               <p>JAMES IV married Margaret of England, daughter of Henry VII, in Auguſt 1503; but many miſcarriages and early deaths intervened before a vivacious fruit of their union appeared. James V was born on the 10th of April 1512:<note n="*" place="bottom">Epiſt. Reg. Scot. M S. in Bibl. Reg. 13 B.

               <p>John duke of Albany aſſumed the regency in May 1515; and held it, with ſome intervals of abſence in France, until July 1524; when Margaret regained the ſupreme power.

               <p>In the beginning of July 1528, James burſt from the fetters of Angus, in his ſeventeenth year, and the firſt act of his power was the forfeiture and baniſhment of that peer, his brothers, friends, and adherents. After a ſhort, but active and juſt exerciſe of ſovereignty, he died on the 14th December, 1542, a victim to the embarraſſments of the time, and his own high ſpirit.

               <p>THIS monarch aſcended the Scotiſh throne in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, 1437, being only in the ſixth year of his age.</p>
               <p>The hiſtorical materials of his reign are remarkably barren.<note n="*" place="bottom">The continuator of Fordun ends his work at the death of James I. Hector Boyce, the notorious fabuliſt, is the only writer who details the reign of James II; and his account is tranſlated by Lindſay of Pittſcottie, and abridged by Leſley and Buchanan; though it deſerve very little credit, being generally irreconcileable with the genuine fragments and records.</note> His minority was chiefly rendered memorable by the conteſts between Crichton and Livingſton, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive earls of Douglas. In 1449 James II eſpouſed Mary of Gelder, niece of Philip the Good, duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy.</p>
               <p>The execution of William, ſixth earl of Douglas, in the caſtle of Edinburgh, 1440, had not quieted the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ſpirit of that great family; and in 1452 James was, in the efferveſcence of paſſion, provoked to ſtab William, the eighth earl of Douglas, with his own hand, in the caſtle of Stirling. James, the ſucceeding earl, raiſed ſome commotions, which were ſpeedily appeaſed, and the public tranquillity reſtored.</p>
               <p>But in 1454 the grand rebellion of the houſe of Douglas commenced, which ſhook the Scotiſh throne, and was ſuppreſſed with much difficulty. In 1455 a forfeiture was led againſt the houſe of Douglas; and the four brothers, James it's chief, the earls of Moray and Ormond, and
<pb facs="tcp:0823600300:22"/>lord Balveny, were doomed to expiate, by death or exile, the vengeance of their offended monarch and country. Yet in the courſe of a few years the branch of Angus ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the exorbitant power of the ſtem. Such ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were the monarchs to modern theoretic ideas of a deſign to ſubvert the ariſtocracy; while, in fact, all they attempted was to withſtand its incroachments, when they became abſolutely incompatible with royalty.</p>
               <p>On the 3d of Auguſt, 1460, James II was accidentally ſlain by the burſting of a cannon, while he was beſieging Roxburgh.</p>
               <p>James II was a prince of eminent ſpirit; and his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were deciſive even to violence. The obſcurity at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his reign renders his private life little known.

               <p>WAS the daughter of JAMES I; and in July 1441, was affianced to Francis, ſon of the Duke John V.</p>
               <p>Argentré in his Hiſtory of Bretagne, informs us that when the envoys of John returned from Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that Prince was eager to know their opinion of the lady. They anſwered that ſhe had beauty, health, and an elegant perſon, but was very ſilent, and apparently ſimple. To which remark the Duke returned this celebrated reply; "My dear friends, I beg you will return to Scotland and bring her to me; ſhe is juſt ſuch a wife as I deſire for my ſon. Knowledge does a woman more hurt than good; upon my ſoul, I ſhall have no other. By the body of St. Nicolas, a woman is quite wife enough, when ſhe can diſtinguiſh her huſband's ſhirt from his waiſtcoat."</p>
               <p>The marriage was accordingly concluded, but Iſabel did not proceed to Bretagne, till November, 1442, and found her huſband in the throne of that Duchy, by the ſtyle of Francis I, his father having died in Auguſt.</p>
               <p>In 1450 ſhe was left a widow with two daughters, Margaret who married Francis II Duke of Bretagne, and Mary afterwards wife of the Viſcount de Rohan.

               <p>THIS firſt monarch of the houſe of Stuart, aſcended the throne on the 26th March, 1371, being in the fiftieth and fifth year of his age. He died on the 19th of April, 1390. His advanced years, and an inflammation in his eyes, prevented his perſonal appearance as an eminent actor in hiſtory; but his reign was diſtinguiſhed by the battle of Otterburn, and other illuſtrious incidents.</p>
               <p>He was a juſt and beneficent Sovereign. In per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he was tall and majeſtic, but his countenance was disfigured by the inflammation of his eyes, which, Froiſſart ſays, were diſtorted and red as ſandal wood;<note n="*" place="bottom">Tome 11. f. 177.</note> a defect which procured him the vulgar epithet of blear eye.</p>
               <p>This portrait from the Inſcriptions of Jonſton, ſeems not much to be depended on; the eyes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed diſtorted, but the beard worn in that age is wanting.

               <p>THIS portrait is taken from a painting at Kiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, near Tubingen in Germany, the ſeat of the Von Lytrums.</p>
               <p>The late learned Sir James Stuart Denham had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Lord Buchan, that he had often ſeen at M. Von Lytrum's, a portrait full length of a Scotiſh king, in a cloſe jacket, <hi>the peaks of his ſhoes faſtened to his girdle, with chains of gold;</hi> that it was in a gallery with portraits of many other princes; that an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor of M. Von Lytrum, being a great traveller, had viſited moſt courts in Europe, and obtained thoſe pictures of the <hi>reigning</hi> ſovereigns.<note n="*" place="bottom">From his lordſhip's information.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Lord Buchan in conſequence applied to M. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnel, Chancellor to the Duke of Wirtemburg, at Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliard, for a copy of this piece; which only came to hand half length, as here, though the remainder would have preſented an inſtance of a ſingular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, mentioned by old Engliſh writers as beginning in the reign of Richard II, but of which no other ſpecimen is known in painting or miniature.</p>
               <p>The editor was led to ſuppoſe that this prince was James IV, becauſe the contemporary ſovereigns were of his reign, or ſoon after. But he now inclines to infer James I, from the following reaſons.
<list>
                     <item>1. M. Gognel named it the latter.</item>
                     <item>2. The features cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond ſo much with the fine portrait of James I
<pb facs="tcp:0823600300:40"/>in Johnſton's Inſcriptions, that the beard, and more advanced years, ſeem to form the only difference.</item>
                     <item>3. The crown over the arms is too ſimple for the time of James IV; that of James III having fleurons of quite a different height and richneſs.</item>
                     <item>4. The hat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles that of Charles VII of France, contemporary with James I, in Mezeray.</item>
                     <item>5. The jacket is not ſlaſhed. There is in Montfaucon<note n="*" place="bottom">Mon. T. iii. pl. 64.</note> a portrait of Charles duke of Burgundy, ſlain in 1477, in this very dreſs, with the chain of the golden fleece; but the jacket is ſlaſhed in ſtrait lines: and this faſhion of ſlaſhing appears in the genuine portrait of James IV.</item>
                     <item>6. The ſhoes, with chains, are ſo rare, that it is probable they were only known in the latter part of the reign of Richard II, and in that of Henry IV, who died in 1413, when James I was twenty years of age, and had been a captive for eight years. Long peaks are common, and appear in the ſtatutes of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward IV; but no mention of chains occurs after the above period. It is improbable that Von Lytrum ſhould from ſuch a diſtance viſit Scotland: but moſt likely that the portrait of James I was executed in England, during his captivity, and procured there by Von Lytrum, who not being able to get that of the reigning monarch, contented himſelf with another.</item>

But no one conſults ſuch books for biography; and it had been better if he had authenticated, and illuſtrated, the portraits, ſeveral of which are well known to be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous. This laſt cauſe, with the unwieldy ſize of ſuperfluous ornaments, for the portraits themſelves might have appeared in 8vo, may perhaps account for the abrupt termination of a work, which the more ample it had proved, the more honourable it had been to the nation. No patriot would wiſh to confine the number of its illuſtrious or eminent perſons.</note> She was born on the 14th of Dec. 1542; went to France in June 1548; was married to the Dauphin April 14, 1558, in her ſixteenth year: queen of France, June 1559; a widow Dec. 1560. She came to Scotland, Auguſt 1561; wedded Darnley, July 1565; a widow Feb. 1567; married Bothwell two months after; fled to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land May 1568; beheaded 7 Feb. 1587, aged 44 years and 2 months, after a captivity of nearly nineteen years, the very term of that of James I of Scotland.</p>
               <p>The fictitious portraits of Mary are infinite. In ſome of them ſhe is confounded with Mary of Guiſe her mother, with Mary queen of France, ſiſter of Henry VIII, and even with Mary of Medici. But any handſome woman is, with the picture dealers, Mary of Scotland. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are the moſt authentic portraits.</p>
               <p>The Scotiſh ſilver coin of 1553 gives her buſt at 11 years of age; the gold, 1555, at 13. The ſilver, 1561, ſhould be at 19. There is, it is believed, at Holyrood-houſe a portrait about 14, pale.</p>
               <p>Cock of Antwerp in 1559 engraved a fine print, three quarters, in her ſeventeenth year. Mr. Harding's half length is faithfully copied from this print, which the editor
<pb facs="tcp:0823600300:45"/>has ſeen in the poſſeſſion of Sir William Muſgrave. The ſmall eyes, and oval features, occur in all the genuine por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits; but this has not that riſe in the middle of the noſe, which appears in the others. Perhaps the engraver was careleſs; or this feature was the product of more advanced years.<note n="*" place="bottom">Montfaucon, Mon. de la Mon. Fr. gives a curious ſmall whole length of her, leaning on a chair. It is intended to be copied for this work.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The portraits by Elſtrack, and a good modern profile by Stewart, may be claſſed between her twentieth and thirtieth year.

               <p>Charles I certainly knew the picture of his grandmother. In the catalogue this piece is aſcribed to <hi>the younger</hi> Jennet, and is mentioned as a preſent of lord Danby. It is a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſmall picture; the face is very pale, perhaps by the fading of the painter's carnation. Auburn hair, black eyes.</p>

               <p>THIS magnanimous prince aſcended the throne on the 24th of June, 1488, aged ſixteen, and fell in the unhappy battle of Flodden, 9th September, 1513, in the fortieth and firſt year of his age, and twenty-ſixth of his reign, which forms an epoch of the greateſt proſperity to which Scotland aſcended, while a ſeparate Power.</p>

But his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity of temper hurried him into two romantic and abſurd wars with England; in the latter of which himſelf and a great part of his nobility fell, and the kingdom was left a prey to anarchy.</p>

Done by Daniel Mytens."<note n="*" place="bottom">In that of the pictures of James II, No. 879 is "James IV, of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land half length with a hawk on his fiſt;" apparently the ſame. This piece was at Whitehall, in both reigns; and muſt have fallen into private hands after the fire in 1697. In the ſame collection two pictures of "<hi>King James</hi> with a hawk on his fiſt" are of James VI at five years of age, as appears from MSS. catalogues.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The picture has been put on freſh canvas, and reframed; and the ſize now is 3 feet 2 inches, by 2 feet and one quarter of an inch: a variation owing to the new frame not being ſo broad in the inner margin as the ancient. This invaluable piece is in good preſervation; and Mytens, who flouriſhed in the reign of James I of England, has ſhewn great talents in the execution.

               <p>WAS the only ſon of the Regent who died in 1572. In 1595 the king James VI en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to him the cuſtody of his ſon: and it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the honour of this illuſtrious family, that the care of their minor ſovereigns had been in a manner hereditary; James V having been entruſted to lord Erſkine by his mother Margaret, and the parliament. It was ſolely a ſpecial character of probity that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thoſe ſucceſſive teſtimonies of high approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This earl was joined with Bruce of Kinloſs, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certing with Cecil the means of ſecuring to James VI the acceſſion to the Engliſh throne: and he diſplayed much prudence in that grand tranſaction. In 1603 he was made a knight of the garter. On the death of prince Henry, whoſe education he ſuperintended, he returned to Scotland. In 1615 he was appointed lord High Treaſurer of that kingdom; an office which he reſigned three years before his death, which happened in 1634.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dougl. Peer. and Crawf.

               <head>GEORGE JAMESON,</head>
               <p>THE Vandyke of Scotland, was ſon of Andrew Jameſon, a builder, and was born at Aberdeen in 1586. The portraits by him at Taymouth are ſaid to have been executed before he ſtudied in Flanders;<note n="*" place="bottom">So the late Lord Hailes thought, but this opinion is very doubtful; and the author of the Sketch of Painting in Scotland (Weekly Magazine, Vol. XV. Bee Vol. XVIII.) aſſerts, with great probability, that Jameſon re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turned to Scotland in 1628.</note> and as one piece there is dated 1635, it would appear that he was advanced in years before he viſited Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens. He died at Edinburgh in 1644, aged 58; and was buried in the Gray-Friars churchyard.</p>
               <p>For ſome account of his works the reader may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the valuable "Anecdotes of Painting in England;" nor is much additional information to be procured. Dr. Arthur Johnſton, in his Parerga, Aberdeen, 1637, addreſſes a ſmall poem to Jameſon, inſtructing him how to paint the beautiful lady Ann Campbell. One of his moſt curious paintings is at Cullen houſe, het ſeat of the Earl of Finlater: it is his own portrait, ſitting in his painting-room, the walls of which are hung with pictures; probably ſuch of his own as he moſt valued.</p>
               <p>Jameſon is the firſt Scotiſh painter on record; but eminent foreigners had viſited Scotland, and painted illuſtrious portraits. The moſt curious aſſemblage of the kind is in the old gallery of the palace at Scone; a hunting-piece, in which James VI. and his chief courtiers appear. Alexander, the ſcholar of Jameſon, married his daughter; and Coſmo Alexander engraved a portrait of Jameſon, his great grandfather, in 1728. The elder Scougal, an imitator of Lely, and Corrudes, a foreigner, appeared in Charles the Second's reign; and were followed by De Wyck, or De Wit, and by
<pb facs="tcp:0823600300:68"/>the younger Scougal. To them ſucceeded Hude, and Medina, both foreigners; and Wait and Aikman, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.<note n="*" place="bottom">Sketch above quoted. More ample information concerning the elder Alexander, the Scougals, Corrudes, and Wait, would be intereſting. They are unknown in the "Anecdotes of Painting."</note>

               <p>This portrait of Jameſon, with a miniature of Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel Toſh, his wife, in his hand, is taken from a picture by himſelf, in the poſſeſſion of another deſcendant, Mr. Carnegy, town-clerk of Aberdeen. Hair and eyes black.</p>

               <head>JOHN LESLEY, BISHOP OF ROSS.</head>
               <p>IT appears that this prelate was the natural ſon of Gawin Leſley, parſon of Kinguſſie in Badenoch. He was born 29th Sept. 1527. In 1538 we find him at ſchool in Moray; in 1546, an <hi>acolyte</hi> in the cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral church of Aberdeen. He is a canon of Aberdeen in 1550, and prebendary and official of that dioceſe eight years after.</p>
               <p>About 1563 he appears among the eccleſiaſtic lords of Seſſion; and in 1565 is commendator of the abbey of Lindoris, and biſhop of Roſs.</p>
               <p>His attachment to Mary, and his ſufferings in her cauſe, are well known. Deprived of his preferments in his own country, he was at laſt forced into exile; and, after various diſappointments in France and Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he died at Bruſſels 31ſt May, 1596, aged 69.<note n="*" place="bottom">Keith's Biſhops, 115—118.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is no wonder that his active character has been blackened by party; but a candid proteſtant muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that Biſhop Leſley acted with uniform principle. As a writer, his reputation ought alſo to ſtand in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior claſs; for, not to mention his works of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy and piety, his Hiſtory of Scotland, from James III. to his own time, is executed with great informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and accuracy; and is far ſuperior, in the real merits of hiſtory, to the elegant but incorrect work of Buchanan. The chronology, and the preſervation of important events and incidents, are ſolely implied, for both were partizans; and this work, eſtranged from party, wiſhes not to pull a wreath from one character, in order to beſtow it on another; but only to aſſign juſt applauſe where it is due.</p>
               <p>This portrait is from an original in the univerſity of Aberdeen.</p>

               <head type="sub">COMPARTMENT I.</head>
               <p>THIS exquiſite painting is in complete preſervation, though executed, as appears from the age of the prince, ten or twelve, about 1482 or 1484. Originally intended for an altar-piece, it is in two diviſions, painted on both ſides. The firſt diviſion contains, on one ſide, the king, prince, and St. Andrew, as here: on the reverſe is the trinity, the father an old man with the dead Chriſt on his knees, while the holy ghoſt is, as uſual, typified by a dove. The other diviſion preſents the queen and a ſaint, apparently Canute the patron of Denmark, and perhaps the features may be thoſe of her father Chriſtiern I: the reverſe bears the eccleſiaſtic, and angels.</p>
               <p>The firſt compartment is rich in effect; and it is hoped the copy will preſent an adequate idea of the original. The king's gown is cloth of gold, the robes of a lilac pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The lion of the arms is crowned, and the treſſure does not go round the top.</p>
               <p>It has been ſurmized that the ſaint might wear the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Shevis, archbiſhop of St. Andrews, a favourite of James; but the eccleſiaſtics did not then preſerve their beards, and the character of the face ſeems ideal.</p>

               <p>THE queen's head-dreſs is ſingularly rich in gold, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, and pearls. The upper part of the kirtle, or gown, is cloth of gold; the robe blue.

               <p>The banner, borne by the ſaint, is the common croſs of the cruſades, with the inſcription AVE MARIA.<note n="*" place="bottom">It may allude to the arms of Gothland, the holy lamb ſupporting a banner, with the ſame croſs as here. See the Elzevir <hi>Dania.</hi>

               <p>IT is probable that this picture was painted for the royal chapel at Stirling, founded by James III with much magnificence; and that the eccleſiaſtic here kneeling was the dean of that chapel, always the queen's confeſſor,<note n="*" place="bottom">Spottiſwoode Rel. Houſes. p. 288. He had alſo epiſcopal ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</note> three being no indication of ſuperior dignity. The arms, three buckles and a cheveron, can be traced to no family in Scotland, except that of Bonkil in the Merſe. But perhaps the perſon may be Sir William Rogers, the great Engliſh Muſician, (the <hi>Sir</hi> being often applied to eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,) or ſome other eminent foreigner.</p>
               <p>The angels in the original have little of ideal beauty; and the unuſual ornament of the coronet may denote the king's ſiſter Mary, firſt wedded to Thomas Boyd earl of Arran, and afterwards to James lord Hamilton; while the other may be Margaret, not wedded to lord Crichton till 1487.</p>

               <head>JAMES III.</head>
               <p>THIS monarch aſcended the throne on the 10th of Auguſt 1460, in the eighth year of his age; and was ſlain, after the civil conflict at Sauchy, on the 18th June 1488, in the thirty-ſixth year of his age.</p>
               <p>His reign was diſtinguiſhed by many memorable events, the recapture of Roxburgh and Berwick; and the acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Orkney iſlands, by his marriage with the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Denmark. The chief ſtain on it is, the murder of the earl of Mar youngeſt brother of James; an incident the more ſingular, as that king was averſe from blood—and though all hiſtorical evidence infer the guilt, yet the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious peers, eager to expoſe every fault of the government, never impute this to their ſovereign's charge. If true, James muſt have been infatuated by his love of aſtrology, which predicted to him his death by one of his neareſt kindred—and Mar may not have been innocent of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt his brother's life. Certain it is that Albany, the ſecond brother, aſpired to the crown, and termed James III a baſtard.</p>
               <p>But the ſovereignty of James was weak, deſpotic, and impolitic; and his warm attachment to the arts forms the moſt pleaſing part of his character. His love of architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture raiſed Cochran to the chief power in the ſtate; and Rogers the Engliſh muſician was in high favour. The fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocious nobles deſpiſed what they eſteemed the frivolous purſuits of the king; and, ſtrangers to the arts, could not eſtimate their value. Of the patronage afforded by James III to foreign artiſts, this noble painting may preſent no unfavourable ſpecimen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0823600300:80"/>Of the perſon of James III Drummond gives the beſt deſcription. "This king, concerning his perſonage, was of a ſtature ſomewhat higher than ordinary, his hair was black, his viſage was rather long than round, approaching in colour more to thoſe in the ſouthern than northern cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates." This fallow complexion appears in the picture; which beſides correſponds ſo much with Drummond's deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neation, that it may be borrowed from the painting. And the complexion of James, ſo different from that of the Stuart race in general, may have had its weight in the calumnies of Albany, eſpecially conſidering the amorous propenſity of Mary of Gelder his mother. Eyes and hair black: there is ſomewhat of melancholy in the face, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in the original by a dark tinge even in the whites of the eyes.</p>

               <head>JAMES VI.</head>
               <p>THIS prince was born on the 19th of June 1566; and crowned on the 29th of July in the following year. In 1603 he united the arms of England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and died on the 27th of March 1625, aged fifty nine.</p>
               <p>With the defect of a feeble character, he had the high merit of being a pacific monarch; a very little learning, a very little knowledge, being ſufficient to ſhew the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of peace over war, both to the king and the people. Even his ſhort peaceful reign greatly advanced the trade, agriculture, and colonies of the kingdom: and if, by way of ſpeculation, we could imagine it prolonged to the preſent epoch, the three realms would have been as one garden, as another China, in univerſal wealth and induſtry.</p>
               <p>In features, particularly the noſe, James VI reſembles his father Darnley more than the ancient Stuart line. The ſingular ſtare of his eyes, mentioned by contemporary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, is more apparent in the portraits taken in more advanced years; particularly a fine whole length at Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, in which the face not a little reſembles the vulgar ſign of the Saracen's head.</p>

               <head>ANNE OF DENMARK, QUEEN OF JAMES VI,</head>
               <p>WAS the daughter of Frederic II king of Denmark and Norway. In October 1589 James proceeded himſelf in queſt of his bride, as his grandfather James V had ſet an example of this gallantry. They were married in Denmark; and Anne was crowned in the enſuing ſpring.</p>
               <p>She died in March 1619.</p>
               <p>The character of Anne of Denmark was the reverſe of that of her countrywoman, Margaret wife of James III. Amorous, bold, intriguing, impreſſed with little reverence for her huſband's ſpirit, or abilities for government, ſhe was immerſed in polities, though her ſupreme cunning have veiled her from hiſtorical obſervation. That, in particular, ſhe had no ſmall ſhare in the Gowrie conſpiracy, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be ſhewn by the editor, in a ſhort tract on that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled ſubject. At preſent he ſhall only hint that the main actor, Gowrie's brother, was a paramour of Anne, that ſhe highly offended James by her continued favour to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited family; that the earl of Gowrie himſelf appears to have been entirely innocent, and that Anne's ambition might conſpire with her lover's infatuation, to impriſon her huſband, and rival Elizabeth in female ſovereignty. Had the lover been a man of ability, had not his mind been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſtracted with the weight of the enterprize, another example might have been added to thoſe in ancient and modern hiſtory, of imperious queens who have impriſoned or murdered their huſbands.</p>

               <head>HENRY SCOUGAL, PROFESSOR OF DIVINITY AT ABERDEEN,</head>
               <p>WAS the ſon of Patrick Scougal biſhop of Aberdeen 1664—1682; and has the merit of being the firſt Scotiſh author, it is believed, who wrote a book of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal piety. Eccleſiaſtical diſputes, ſo inconſiſtent with the meek ſpirit of chriſtianity, had firſt prevailed between the catholics and reformers, then between the epiſcopals and preſbyterians, and afterwards between the preſbyterians and independents. Sermons, and commentaries on ſcripture were ſometimes interpoſed; but the chief object, the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Chriſtian virtues, was unaccountably neglected; Durham's curious work, On Scandal, being rather a diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of eccleſiaſtic diſcipline and polity, and a defence of the preſbyterians againſt the independent Jacobins of the day, than an ethical production.</p>
               <p>Of Henry Scougal little is known. It is ſaid that, being of an amorous complexion, he ſometimes loved God, and ſometimes loved women; and that having unfortunately become enamoured of a married lady at Aberdeen, he died in the ſtruggles of virtue and paſſion. But he had grown ſo corpulent in his retreat, the ſteeple of the cathedral church of St. Machan's, at Old Aberdeen, that his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were forced to extract the body through a window. Theſe traditions ſeem rather inconſiſtent, as love is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuppoſed rather to belong to the claſs of conſumptions, than of dropſies; and it is rare that the amorous ſwain pines away into plenitude.</p>
               <p>Scougal's Life of God in the ſoul of man was publiſhed by Biſhop Burnet, in 1691, 8vo; and has ſince paſſed through many editions, being a work of eminent piety, without enthuſiaſm, and written in a clear neat ſtyle.</p>

               <head>ALEXANDER HENDERSON.</head>
               <p>THIS Franklin of the Scotiſh commotions in laſt century was miniſter at Leuchars: and was in vain tempted with a biſhopric. He died in 1649, regretting the exceſs to which affairs were carried; but never repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own moderate motives and actions, as vainly repeated by his opponents; a ſtale device of party.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Baillie's Letters 2 vols. 8vo.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In fact the preſbyterians, after overturning the epiſcopal deſpotiſm of the time, were gradually ruining their own cauſe by a deſpotiſm far more diſguiſting. The ſaints at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to eſtabliſh a clerical ariſtocracy, not only over Scotland, but over England; and the civil power would have become the mere ſlave of eccleſiaſtic cenſure, and excommunication. Liberty of conſcience was entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the preſbyterian party; their church polity was a part of their creed; and the penalty againſt any diffent was excommunication in this world, and a liberal inheritance in hell fire hereafter. A man's private life was to be tainted with ſaintſhip or hypocriſy; and every pleaſure was to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh at the nod of thoſe phyſicians of Sancho the governor. The preſbyterians ſupported the regal power, as a ſhield againſt the independents, and ſectaries; who, with far ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior political ſkill, allowed univerſal liberty of conſcience.</p>
               <p>But a nondeſcript ſaint, named Cromwell, put himſelf at the head of the independents, and completely overthrew the preſbyterian deſpotiſm. Both parties appealed to King Chriſt, and he decided in favour of the democratic church.</p>
               <p>In the ſole choice left, between the impertinent autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and degrading ſuperſtition, of the preſbyterians, and
<pb facs="tcp:0823600300:91"/>the power merely military of Cromwell, it is no wonder that the nation ſighed for the ancient monarchy; a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at leaſt of gentlemen over gentlemen, and more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent to all, than that of parſons or ſoldiers over ſlaves.</p>
               <p>Henderſon's favourite polity, and the clerical ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, were after his death to be trampled under foot; but be timouſly eſcaped from the evils to come. One of the chief events of his life was, the ſolemn conference with Charles I at Newcaſtle, on various topics of religion and government; the relation has been printed, and does honour to both parties.</p>

               <head>PATRICK FORBES, BISHOP OF ABERDEEN.</head>
               <p>THIS learned prelate was deſcended of the ancient and noble family of Forbes,<note n="*" place="bottom">Pronounced <hi>Forbis,</hi> not <hi>Forbs,</hi> as in England.</note> and was himſelf <hi>baron</hi> or <hi>laird</hi> of the eſtates of Corſe and Oneil in Aberdeenſhire. Having received an excellent education, and being attached to eccleſiaſtical ſtudies, he was often perſuaded to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but could not be prevailed on, till the year 1612, when the miniſter of Keith having, in a paroxyſm of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious melancholy, ſtabbed himſelf, urged this as his dying requeſt; but the motive, conſidering all the circumſtances, ſeems moſt inadequate to the effect.</p>
               <p>However this be, Mr. Forbes entered into eccleſiaſtic orders in his forty eighth year; and was choſen biſhop of Aberdeen ſix years after. He died on the 28th March 1635, aged ſeventy one years, and was interred in the ſouth aile of the cathedral.</p>
               <p>In epiſcopal juriſdiction he was laudably rigid, and uſed ſuddenly to viſit the churches of his dioceſe on ſundays, that he might ſee the common method of the preachers, and accommodate his inſtructions accordingly.</p>
               <p>He wrote a commentary on the Revelations, printed by Elzevir, 1646, 4to. Some particulars concerning him may be found in the life of the yet more learned and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated John Forbes of Corſe, prefixed to his works Amſt. 1703, 2 vols. folio.<note n="†" place="bottom">Keith Biſhops.</note>

               <p>SIR Robert Douglas of Spot was deſcended from the Douglaſes of Dalkeith, afterwards earls of Morton.

               <p>In June 1633 he was created Viſcount Belhaven; and dying in Scotland, Jan. 1639, he was buried in the veſtry of the church of Holyroodhouſe, under a ſplendid monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of alabaſter, with a long inſcription:<note n="*" place="bottom">Douglas' Peerage.</note> the preſent figure being merely an addition to his wife's tomb.</p>

               <head>FRANCES STUART, DUCHESS OF RICHMOND.</head>
               <p>THIS celebrated beauty was the daughter of Walter Stuart M. D. third ſon of Walter firſt Lord Blantyre.<note n="*" place="bottom">Stewarts Houſe of Stuart, p. 167. Douglas Peer. 75.</note> The chief ornament of the court of Charles II, though rich in female charms, ſhe captivated the heart of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; who, finding all other hopes vain, was meditating a divorce from Catherine of Portugal, in order to eſpouſe Miſs Stuart, when ſhe unexpectedly wedded Charles Stuart, Duke of Richmond and Lennox, and Lord of Aubigny in France. This peer had ſucceeded his couſin Eſme, in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 1661: and dying at Elſineur, in Dec. 1672, without iſſue, in him terminated the ancient race of Stuart of Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox and Aubigny, created dukes of Richmond in 1623.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> Charles II ſoon after gave the titles to his natural ſon by Louiſa de Queroualle.</p>
               <p>In the exquiſite Memoires de Grammont may be found numerous anecdotes relating to Miſs Stuart. To a perſon and face of wonderful excellence ſhe united the ſimplicity of a child; and when the king and his courtiers were occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in deep gaming, ſhe would ſit building caſtles of cards, while happy was the peer who aſſiſted her in this amuſement of a fool or a philoſopher.</p>
               <p>This portrait is engraved from a painting of great merit, by James Huyſman, a Flemiſh artiſt. She is repreſented in the dreſs of a cavalier about the time of the civil wars, a ſuit of buff, or buffalo-hide, adorned with blue ribbands. The picture had belonged to James II, being mentioned in
<pb facs="tcp:0823600300:106"/>his catalogue as that of the Ducheſs of Richmond in man's apparel; and is now in the gallery at Kenſington.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Walpole's Aneedotes, III. 69.</note> The likeneſs correſponds with that on her tomb, in Henry the Seventh's chapel, Weſtminſter-abbey, where her figure in wax may alſo be ſeen, with a ſtuffed-parrot, which is ſaid to have died juſt-before or after her.</p>
               <p>Another portrait, from Lord Weſtcote's at Hagley, is engraved for the late edition of the Memoires de Grammont. And there is an old mezzotinto, repreſenting the ducheſs and her ſiſter Sophia, who married Henry Bulkly Eſq. maſter of the houſe-hold to Charles II.</p>

               <p>WAS the eldeſt daughter of James I by his wife Joanna Beaufort. In July 1436 ſhe was wedded to Louis dauphin of France, when ſhe was only twelve years of age.</p>
               <p>She died in Auguſt 1445, in her twenty ſecond year, her exquiſite ſenſibility being unable to digeſt a ſlanderous expreſſion of a baſe courtier. Her marriage had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy; the character of her huſband, afterwards the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Louis XI, being malignant to an inconceivable degree.</p>
               <p>Margaret was not only celebrated as a patroneſs of men of letters, but was herſelf a proficient in French poetry, having compoſed many rondeaux and ballads. In the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations taken concerning the cauſe of her death, it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that ſhe would ſit up all night, writing poetry; and would compoſe twelve rondeaux in a day.<note n="*" place="bottom">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE plan of this work, as may be judged from the Proſpectus, entirely differs from thoſe of Birch, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rault, Hoffman, or the like; not being intended as a ſplendid publication of fine portraits, but as a variegated aſſemblage of ancient portraits in particular, repreſented without any improvement, and in the juſt colours of the various ſources whence they are taken. Vertue, in his heads of the Engliſh monarchs, has ſometimes been obliged to have recourſe to ſeals; and they at any rate ſhew the <hi>coſtume</hi> of the time, and may ſometimes ſerve to identify larger and more exact deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neations. In the middle ages ſeals alſo preſent ſome of the beſt monuments of art, and muſt ſupply the want of medals.</p>
               <p>The firſt plate contains thoſe of David earl of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdon, afterwards David I;<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſeals of Alex. I, 11—David I, 1124—and Malcom IV, 1153 —are all from the ſame dye, and therefore omitted. Thoſe of Duncan 1094, and Edgar 1097, are already reengraved in Guthrie's Hiſtory.</note> and of Henry earl of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, ſon of that monarch. The firſt ſeal may be about A. D. 1120, the ſecond, 1140. There is alſo in Anderſon's Diplomata a ſeal of David earl of Huntingdon, brother of Malcom IV, and ſon of Henry earl of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland; but as it varies little from the laſt it is omitted.</p>
               <p>The ſecond plate contains thoſe of William, A. D. 1165 —1214; and Alexander II, 1214—1249.</p>
               <p>The ſeals in the third plate are of Alexander III, 1249 —1286; and John Baliol, 1292—1296.</p>

D. 1329 to 1371.</p>
               <p>The ſecond plate of this ſet contains that of Edward Baliol, who twice uſurped the throne, during the reign of David II, firſt for three months Sept—Dec. 1332, and laſtly for five years 1333—1338: and that of Robert II, the firſt of the houſe of Stuart, 1371,—1390.</p>
               <p>On the third plate the firſt in order. of time is that of Euphemia Roſs ſecond wife, but ſole queen, of Robert II. The reverſe only bears the arms of David, Earl Palatine of Strathern, her ſon, who joins in the deed, dated 1375; in which they agree with Alexander Murray of Drumſergath, that he ſhall wed lady Jonet of Monymuſk, ſiſter of the queen, and be ſupported in his claim of inheriting ſome eſtate; and that Walter Murray, his brother, may if he chuſe marry the eldeſt daughter of the ſaid Jonet. This cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſeal repreſents Euphemia, clothed in the cloſe kirtle and mantle of the times, with a particular ſcepter alloted to the queens of Scotland in her hand. The Gothic architecture is well delineated; on her right hand are the arms of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; on her left thoſe of Roſs. She appears to have died about 1387.</p>
               <p>The next ſeal in order of time is that of Robert III, 1390—1406. The beard agrees better with the deſcription
<pb facs="tcp:0823600300:117"/>of his perſon, given by the continuator of Fordun, than the portrait in Johnſon's <hi>Inſcriptiones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That at the top of the plate is of Robert duke of Albany, Regent of Scotland, 1406—1419. The ducal coronet is of a ſingular form.</p>
               <p>All theſe plates are from that rare and high-priced work, Anderſon's Diplomata.</p>
               <p>The ſubject of the engravers of ſeals in the middle ages is obſcure. They were probably often Greeks from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, ſometimes Italians, and laterly Flemings.</p>
               <p>The ſeals of the four firſt Jameses are all from the ſame dye—and are beſides unimportant, as from James I. the portraits of our monarchs are ſufficiently identified. In this caſe, as in the former of Alex. I, David I, and Malcom IV, the firſt ſeal alone is entitled to any attention.</p>
