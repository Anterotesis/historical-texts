            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE pious Deſigns, and the magnificent Works, of our Anceſtors are Themes, on which every Reader of a liberal Curioſity receives Information with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

            <p>For the Satisfaction of the Reader it may be neceſſary ſtill further to premiſe, that our Account is compiled from the beſt private Information, from an attentive Examination on the Spot, and from a Variety of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials relating to the Subject, incidentally diſperſed in different Books, which have been carefully collected, and ſuccinctly digeſted.

            <head>THE CITY.</head>
            <p>WINCHESTER appears to have been a City of conſiderable Note among the antient <hi>Britons,</hi> by whom it was called <hi>Caer Guen,</hi> or the <hi>White City,</hi> from its Situation upon a chalky Soil. Many reputable Hiſtorians report, that it was founded by <hi>Ludor Rous Hudibras,</hi> 892 Years before the Birth of Chriſt. It afterwards became a Roman Station, and probably one of their Cities, as appears from the Diſcovery of a Pavement of Brick, and Coins of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, found in digging the Foundat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

On the South and Eaſt Sides, for ſome Diſtance, they remain entire, and many Fragments of them are continued to a conſiderable Extent on the North and Weſt, particularly to the Weſtward, on which is to be ſeen a Baſtion, called the <hi>Hermit's Tower.</hi> Their Circumference is one Mile and

The vacant Spaces within the Walls, now formed into Gardens, demonſtrate that the Town has been greatly depopulated.</p>
            <p>Near the Weſt Gate we ſurvey the Ruins of a ſtrong and ſtately Caſtle, which according to Tradition was built by King <hi>Arthur</hi> Anno Dom. 523; and was a Place of remarkable Defence in the Reign of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> againſt whoſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks it was bravely maintained by <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs for a conſiderable Time. By a Plan of it drawn Anno Dom. 1630, it appears to have been a quadrangular Structure, with a Tower at each Angle: And by a ſmall Sketch in <hi>Speed,</hi> Anno Dom. 1614, we diſcover, that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance from the Weſt was over a Bridge thrown
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0140900900:8"/>
acroſs the Weſtern Foſs, leading to a Gate-way contiguous to the South Weſt Angle of the Building.

            <p>The Aſſizes for the County of <hi>Hants</hi> were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally kept in this Caſtle; at leaſt as early as the Year 1272, as we learn from the <hi>Wincheſter</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliſt, who frequently remarks that the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily quitted their Reſidence at this Place to make Room for the Judges; but at preſent the Chapel, of which I have been juſt ſpeaking, is appropriated to this Purpoſe. At the End hangs what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called King <hi>Arthur's Round Table,</hi> which is 18 Feet in Diameter. It would be needleſs to multiply Authorities for a Proof that this Table is of modern Date. However it is of higher Antiquity than it is commonly ſuppoſed to be: For <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Deſcript, Region.</note>, who wrote above two hundred Years ago, relates, that it was ſhewn to the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. and that at that Time many Marks of its Antiquity had been deſtroyed, the Names of the Knights having been then juſt written afreſh, and the whole Table, with its Ornaments, newly repaired. Turnaments being
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0140900900:10"/>
often held at <hi>Wincheſter</hi> before the Court and Parliament, this Table might probably have been uſed, on thoſe Occaſions, for entertaining the Combatants; which, on that Account, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly inſcribed with the Names of <hi>Arthur</hi>'s twenty-four Knights; either in Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Prince, who was the reputed Founder and Patron of Tilts and Turnaments; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſuppoſed to have eſtabliſhed theſe martial Sports at <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> In later Times theſe Exerciſes were called <hi>Menſa Rotunda</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Thom. Walſing. edit. i. pag. 49. See alſo Selden, De Duello, pag. 64. Works, Fol. vol. iii.</note>. The Names of the Knights inſcribed on the Table are much the ſame as thoſe we find in an old Romance concerning King <hi>Arthur</hi>

            <p>On or near the Site of this Caſtle <hi>Charles</hi> II. Anno Dom. 1683, laid the Foundation of a magnificent Royal Palace, only the Shell of which was finiſhed. A Cupola was deſigned 30 Feet higher than the Roof, which would have been ſeen at Sea; and a Street was intended leading from the Weſt End of the Cathedral to the Centre of the Front. The Length of the whole is 328 Feet. A Park was alſo projected ten Miles in Circumſerence: but the Death of the

The lower Rooms, on either Side of the Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and of the whole Eaſtern Side of this Court, are the Lodging Rooms of the Scholars; over which are the Apartments of the Fellows. The Stair Caſe adjoining to the North Weſt Angle, leads to the Apartments of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, which are ſpacious, and elegantly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. On the Weſt is the Kitchen, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Conduit.</p>
            <p>The whole South Side is magnificently formed by the Chapel and Hall. The latter is a noble Gothic Room 63 Feet in Length, and 33 in Breadth; in which the Scholars dine at Twelve, and ſup at Six. In the uppermoſt Window, on the North Side, are the Arms of <hi>England,</hi> and of the Marquis of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>

It is 102 Feet long, and 33 broad. The Screen, Stalls, and Altar-piece, which is of the <hi>Ionic</hi> Order, were executed in the Wardenſhip of Dr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> abovementioned. The Altar is adorned with a beautiful Salutation Piece, painted by <hi>Le Moine,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0140900900:25"/>
and given by the Reverend Dr. <hi>Burton,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent public-ſpirited, and learned Head Maſter. The Branches are the Gift of the Reverend Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Eyre,</hi> formerly Uſher. The Eaſt Window is painted with the Genealogy of Chriſt, and has been celebrated in an elegant Poem written by the Reverend Dr. <hi>Lowth,</hi> Prebendary of <hi>Durham,</hi> which is printed in an admired Collection of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poems, entitled The UNION<note n="§" place="bottom">Printed for R. Baldwin in Pater-noſter Row.</note>. The reſt of the Windows are decorated with the Pourtraits of Saints, with their Names underwritten: Together with the following Inſcription, which is in many Places at preſent deſtroyed. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Orate pro anima Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helmi de Wykeham Fundatoris iſtius Collegii.</hi>"</q> On the North Side ſtands the Organ. The Roof is covered with a Cieling of Wood in Imitation of arched Stone Work, without which, the Height would be too great, as it is at <hi>New College</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where ſuch a Cieling was, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, originally intended. At leaſt, the preſent Rafter Work of that noble Chapel is by no Means equal to the Magnificence of the reſt. This Cieling ſeems to have been finiſhed about the Time of that which covers the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in the Cathedral, as it is exactly of the ſame Workmanſhip.</p>

In this Chapel, Choir Service is performed at Eight and Five, on Sundays and Holidays, and at Five on their preceding Eves. The Choir conſiſts of three Chaplains, three Clerks, one Organiſt, and ſixteen Choriſters.</p>

            <p>Contiguous to the College, on the Weſt, is a ſpacious quadrangular Building, in which the young Gentlemen not on the Foundation, who are called Commoners, live in a Collegiate Manner, under the Care of the ſecond Maſter or Uſher; a Situation which muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be far more convenient ſor the Purpoſes of Learning, and good Diſcipline, than the uſual Cuſtom of our great Schools, where the Youth are boarded in the Town, and are at a Diſtance from the conſtant and immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of their proper Governors. On one Side of the Area of this Structure is a commodious Cloyſter. There is alſo a noble Hall, 50 Feet in Length, and 30 in Breadth, in which the Commoners dine, and, when abſent from the School, purſue their private Studies.</p>
            <p>This College was founded by that magnificent Prelate <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Wykeham,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> for one Warden, ten Fellows, one School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, one Uſher, three Chaplains, ſeventy Scholars, three Clerks, and ſixteen Choriſters.</p>

The firſt Stone was laid <hi>March</hi> the 26, 1387, at Nine o'Clock in the Morning, near a School in which <hi>Wykeham</hi> when a Boy was educated. The Building being compleated on the 28th of <hi>March,</hi> A.D. 1393, the Warden and Scholars made their ſolemn Entrance, at Nine in the Morning, chaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Proceſſion. It ſhould be obſerved, that the Founder, by his firſt Charter, eſtabliſhed only a Warden and ſeventy Scholars, which was the whole Society who took formal Poſſeſſion of the College, as abovementioned; and who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Building was finiſhed, were provided with Lodgings in the Pariſh of St. <hi>John</hi> upon the Hill. The Founder obtained a ſecond Charter for the Eſtabliſhment of the ten Fellows, and Officers of the Choir<note n="§" place="bottom">See the Charters in Dugd. Mon. vol. iii. Eccl.

            <head>THE CATHEDRAL.</head>
            <p>SOME Writers report, that a Monaſtery was founded in this City by King <hi>Lucius,</hi> A.D. 169, which was deſtroyed in the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> A.D. 266<note n="*" place="bottom">Tho. Rudborne Hiſt. Maj. Wint. Ang. Sacr. tom. i. pag. 182, 183.</note>. This, it is ſaid, was afterwards reſtored, and underwent various Revolutions; till <hi>Kyngeliſe,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian King of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> began a Cathedral Church, A.D. 611. which was probably finiſhed by his Succeſſor <hi>Kenwalch,</hi> and repleniſhed with Religious by <hi>Birinus,</hi> the Biſhop and Apoſtle of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> A.D. 646. Soon afterwards, viz. A.D. 660, the See of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> now in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> was removed hither, and <hi>Wina</hi> was appointed the firſt Biſhop. But before this new Conſtitution commenced, <hi>Birinus</hi> and <hi>Agilbertus</hi> were the two firſt Biſhops of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>

The Chapter of this Foundation, who were Seculars, continued about 300 Years, and were at length removed by the Perſuaſion of Biſhop <hi>Ethelwold</hi>

            <p>About the Year 1079 Biſhop <hi>Walkelyne</hi>

Accordingly the Monks, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of almoſt all the Biſhops and Abbots of <hi>England,</hi> paſſed with much State and Triumph from the old Monaſtery to the new one, A.D. 1093, on the Feaſt of their Patron St. <hi>Swythin;</hi> and in a moſt ſolemn Proceſſion tranſlated the Shrine of that Saint to the new Church. The next Day <hi>Walkelyne</hi> commanded the old Monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to be demoliſhed; which was effected the ſame Year, one Porch and the high Altar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ut infra.</note>. The whole being nobly improved by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Wykeham,</hi> was at lenth finiſhed, as it now appears, by <hi>Fox;</hi> of whoſe reſpective Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions and Alterations I ſhall find a proper Occaſion hereafter to ſpeak more particularly.</p>

Notwithſtanding the poſitive Aſſertions above, concerning <hi>Walkelyne</hi>'s entire Demolition of the old Church, I am perſuaded that the low-built Iles at the Eaſt End of the Choir, exiſted before the Time of <hi>Walkelyne,</hi> and are a Part of the old Church erected by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from ſeveral demonſtrative Proofs: For, they are in a more ſimple and confined Style of Architecture, than any Part of <hi>Walkelyne</hi>'s new Work; and, admitting that <hi>Walkelyne</hi> demoliſhed great Part of the old Church, it ſeems probable that he ſhould leave that Part of it ſtanding in which many of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, and Biſhops his Predeceſſors, are confeſſedly buried. Another Evidence of this Hypotheſis are the <hi>Crypts</hi> on which theſe low Iles ſtand to this day; and which, as appears from a Latin Epiſtle in Verſe of <hi>Wolſtan</hi>

yet at leaſt they point out the original Situation of the Church; and invalidate thoſe Teſtimonies which aſſert that <hi>Walkelyne</hi> entirely demoliſhed the old Church, and choſe a new Ground-plot for his new Structure.</p>
            <p>There is another Circumſtance mentioned by <hi>Rudbourne</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pag. 270, 271, apud Whart. Angl. Sacr. vol. i.</note>, which ſtill further corroborates my Suppoſition. He obſerves that <hi>William Rufus</hi> was buried in the Choir under a Tower, which fell down a few Years afterwards, and that in the Place of it <hi>Walkelyn</hi> erected the preſent Tower. He adds, that <hi>Walkelyn</hi> did not build this Tower in his Life-time, but committed the Care of it to his Executors, who finiſhed it after his Death.</p>

The Nave of the Church had been for ſome Time in a bad Condition: Biſhop <hi>Edyngdon</hi> undertook to repair it in the latter Part of his Time, and by his Will ordered his Executors to finiſh what he had begun. And whether in Purſuance of his Deſign and by his Benefaction, or otherwiſe, it appears, that in the Year 1371, ſome Work of this Kind was carrying on at a great Expence. However, <hi>Wykeham,</hi> upon due Conſideration and Survey, found it either ſo decayed and infirm, or elſe ſo mean in its Appearance, and ſo much below the Dignity of one of the firſt Epiſcopal Sees in the Kingdom, that he determined to take down the whole from the Tower weſtward, and to rebuild it both in a ſtronger and more magnificent Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This great Work he undertook in the Year 1394, and entered upon it the Beginning of the next Year, upon the following Conditions ſtipulated between him and the Prior and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, who acquit the Biſhop of all Obligation to it, and acknowledge it as proceeding from his mere Liberality, and Zeal for the Honour of God: They agree to find the whole Scaffolding neceſſary for the Work; they give the Biſhop free Leave to dig and to carry away Chalk and Sand from any of their Lands, as he ſhall think
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0140900900:85"/>
moſt convenient and uſeful for the ſame Purpoſe; and they allow the whole Materials of the old Building to be applied to the Uſe of the new. He employed <hi>William Winford</hi> as Architect: <hi>Simon Membury</hi> was appointed Surveyor of the Work on the Biſhop's Part, and <hi>John Wayte,</hi> one of the Monks, Controller on the Part of the Convent. As the Church of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> is ſituated in low Ground, which, without great Precaution and Expence, affords no very ſure Foundation for ſo weighty a Structure, <hi>Wykeham</hi> thought it ſafeſt to confine himſelf to the Plan of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Building, and to make Uſe of a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion already tried, and ſubject to no Hazard. He even choſe to apply to his Purpoſe ſome Part of the lower Order of Pillars of the old Church, though his Deſign was in a different Style of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture; that which we commonly call <hi>Gothic,</hi> with pointed Arches and Windows, without Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, and Pillars conſiſting of an Aſſemblage of many ſmall ones cloſely connected together; but which is more properly <hi>Saracen,</hi> for ſuch was its Origin: The Cruſades gave us an Idea of this Form of Architecture, which afterwards prevailed throughout <hi>Europe.</hi> The Pillars or Piers of the old Building, which he made Uſe of, were about ſixteen Feet in Height; of the ſame Form with thoſe in the Eaſt Side of the Northern Croſs-ile: Theſe he carried up higher,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0140900900:86"/>
according to the new Deſign, altering their Form, but retaining their Strength, and adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as a firm Baſis for his own Work. The new Pillars are nearly equal in Bulk to the old ones; and the Intercolumniation remains much the ſame. Theſe Circumſtances, in which Stability and Security were very wiſely in the firſt Place conſulted, have been attended however with ſome Inconvenience, as it ſeems owing to them, that this Building has not that Lightneſs and Freedom, and that Elegance of Proportion, which might have been expected from <hi>Wykeham</hi>'s known Taſte in Architecture, and from the Style and Manner of his other Works in this Kind; of which we have evident Examples in the Chapels of both his Colleges, eſpecially in the Weſtern Part of that of <hi>New College</hi> in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> which is remarkably beautiful. To the further Diſadvantage of its preſent Appearance, an Alteration which could not then be foreſeen has ſince happened. At that Time the Buildings of the Monaſtery covered the whole South Side of the Church, ſo that it ſeemed needleſs to be at a great Expence upon Ornaments in that Part which was like to be for ever concealed.

The Stalls on the South Side are bounded by the Biſhop's Throne, erected by Biſhop <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawney,</hi> tranſlated from <hi>Exeter,</hi> A.D. 1706. The Pediment, which is embelliſhed with a Mitre and the Arms of the See impaling thoſe of his Family, is ſupported by fluted Columns of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order. The Vaulting of the Roof of the Choir was executed in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> I. there being, before this, an Opening from the Choir into the firſt Story or Room of the Tower; on which Account the Side Arches of this firſt Story, being intended to be ſeen from below, are wrought and ornamented. We find the ſame Opening in the Tower of St. <hi>Croſs,</hi> built about the ſame Time. It was undoubtedly looked upon as a Beauty in the Architecture; and had, in ſome Meaſure, the ſame Effect, as the <hi>Louvre,</hi> or open Lantern formerly uſed in great Halls. Height of Roof in the Inſide was alſo a favourite Circumſtance in Structure of this Sort, which was produced from this Expedient in a very ſtriking Degree. The Arms and Initials of the King, with thoſe of his Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and of <hi>John Young,</hi> Dean at that Time, are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced among the Ornaments of the Vaulting, which is of Wood.

            <p>In the Area leading to the high Altar, is a plain raiſed Monument, of a greyiſh Stone, without any Inſcription, under which, <hi>William Rufus,</hi> who was killed in the neighbouring new Foreſt, A.D. 1000, is buried. This Tomb was opened by the Rebels in the Civil Wars, who ſtole from thence the Remains of a Cloth of Gold, a Ring ſet with Rubies, ſaid to be worth 500<hi>l.</hi> and a ſmall Silver Chalice.</p>
            <p>With this Area the Preſbytery begins, which is ornamented with a Roof highly finiſhed in a different Taſte from that of the Tower, and is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0140900900:91"/>
ſeparated, on each Side, from the North and South Iles, by a well-executed Partition Wall of open Work. On the Top of either Wall are placed three Shrines, or Cheſts, beautifully carved, painted, and gilded, with a Crown on each, in which are encloſed the Bones of ſeveral of the Weſt <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, Biſhops, and ſome later Princes, who had been originally buried behind the Altar or in different Parts of the Church. Theſe Remains were thus no leſs pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly than carefully collected and depoſited, by Biſhop <hi>Fox,</hi> A.D. 1525. Their Names, &amp;c. are inſcribed on every Cheſt, which the Reader will find among the <hi>Tombs</hi> and <hi>Monumental Inſcriptions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Aſcent to, and Area of, the high Altar, is paved with Marble, by the Benefaction of Dr. <hi>William Harris,</hi> Prebendary, and School-maſter of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> College, who dying, A.D. 1700, bequeathed 800 <hi>l.</hi> for ornamenting the Altar. The Wood Work about the Altar was erected by Biſhop <hi>Fox:</hi> But the Canopy, with its Feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons, and other Ornaments, were added, about the Time when the new Screen of <hi>Inigo Jones,</hi> at the Choir-Entrance, was built, as I conjecture from C R in the Cornice.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0140900900:92"/>
Tops of three Niches are likewiſe remaining over the Altar, which probably contained three Images repreſenting the Trinity. A good Piece of Painting would be a noble and proper Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this ſuperb Altarpiece. Behind is a a very lofty Screen, or Partition of Stone, charged with moſt exquiſite Embelliſhments of <hi>Gothic</hi> Workmanſhip, and infinitely ſuperior, in Point of finiſhing, to another of the ſame Sort in St. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>'s Abbey Church. The Niches, before the Reformation, were filled with Statues; but are at preſent ſupplied with Urns, which by ſome are thought inconſiſtent Decorations. Theſe were the Gift of Dr. <hi>William Harris</hi> abovementioned<note n="†" place="bottom">From his Epitaph.</note>.</p>
            <p>The Screen, Side Partition-Walls, Roof of the Preſbytery, and of the adjoining Side Iles, with their Walls and Windows, were finiſhed at the Expence, or by the Intereſt, of Biſhop <hi>Fox,</hi> A.D. 1525, as appears by his Name and Arms carved in many Places. The ſame liberal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor new glazed, with painted Glaſs, as he had new made, the Windows of this Part of the Church; that is, the Choir Windows, and thoſe of the parallel Iles. He likewiſe fronted the Boundary of the Choir, on the Outſide, with two beautiful Pinnacles, and other ornamental Architecture, among which his Statue is placed, cloathed in the Epiſcopal Habit.

            <p>It is ſaid, and from good Authority, that the Biſhop was aſſiſted in this Work by Prior <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſtede</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Willis's Mitr. Ab. vol. i. pag. 301.</note>.

Univ. Oxon. L. ii. p. 230.</note>. His Initials T.S. are in the Roof of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Preſbytery. It ſhould ſeem that Cardinal <hi>Henry Beaufort</hi> left ſome Money for this Purpoſe, as H.B. appears on the Outſide of the South Partition Wall, and over its En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. He died not many Years before <hi>Fox</hi> was advanced to the Biſhoprick.</p>
            <p>In the Grand Rebellion, the Altar-Screen, juſt mentioned, was artfully protected from the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Preſbyterians, by Means of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaneous Wall, or Partition, erected in a parallel Line juſt before it, ſo as entirely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal its Beauties from the Obſervation of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious Intruders. Other Parts of the Church did not however eſcape the miſtaken Zeal of theſe Enemies to all that was graceful or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic. On the 16th of <hi>December,</hi> 1642, the Soldiers of Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> entered the Church,

After this, they defaced many of the Monuments; and pulling down ſome of the Cheſts which contained the Remains of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, they threw their Bones againſt the painted Glaſs, which they thus deſtroyed throughout the Church<note n="‡" place="bottom">Heylin H.ſt. of Preſbyt. pag. 450. edit. 1670.

But the beautiful Window over the Altar, exhibiting the Pourtraits of ſeveral Saints and Biſhops of this Church, being more out of their Reach, and leſs expoſed than the reſt, is ſtill preſerved entire, together with a few Figures on the Windows contiguous. The grand Weſt Window ſeems to be made up of the diſperſed Fragments, which, imperfect as it is, has a fine Effect, and leaves the penſive Imagination to ſupply that religious

            <p>The Eaſt End of the Church is terminated by three Chapels. That on the South is adorned with a Monument of <hi>Thomas Langton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> who died A.D. 1500. The Rood-Loft conſiſts of elegant <hi>Gothic</hi> Carving in Wood; and both the Sides are finiſhed in the ſame Taſte. But the Work has been much damaged. Under the Window are ſeveral Niches for Statues. The Biſhop is ſaid to have built this Chapel<note n="†" place="bottom">Leland, Collectan. vol. i. pag. 116.</note>.

            <p>The Chapel in the Centre, dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was erected by Prior <hi>Silkeſtede</hi> before mentioned, and is uſed at preſent for early Prayers. His Name is on the Roof; and on the Sides, which are adorned with ancient Painting, are emboſſed the Arms of <hi>England,</hi> of <hi>Silkeſtede,</hi> of the See, a Rebus on <hi>T. Langton,</hi> viz. T.L. with a Tun, as in his Chapel juſt deſcribed, and who was Biſhop in the former Part of <hi>Silkeſtede</hi>'s Priorate, for whom alſo a Tun is introduced on the Cieling.

It is a Miſtake <note n="†" place="bottom">Willis Mitr. Abb. vol. i. pag. 301.</note> that this Prior built the Chapel in the South Ile, called <hi>Silkeſtede</hi>'s Chapel. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably he might uſe it as a private Oratory, or perhaps might be interred in it. He ſeems to have born ſome Relation to it, for oppoſite to it are the Remains of a Canopy, under which the Preſſes for the Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
