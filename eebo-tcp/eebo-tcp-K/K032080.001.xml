            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE present work is submitted with the utmost defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Reader as a general and very copious eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all the larger kinds of Shells found in this country.</p>
            <p>At the commencement of this undertaking the Author proposed that the five volumes of which this work consists should include figures and descriptions of all the British Shells; so far at least as they could be correctly ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. The amount of these collectively, he was induced to think might be very nearly appreciated from the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral works of Lister, Merret, Petiver, Walker, Pennant, and Da Costa: from the number of nondescript British Shells that came into his possession with the original col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the latter writer, together with those in his own cabinet independent of them; the whole amount of which was far from inconsiderable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0622700301:3"/>In this estimate, which the Author at first conceived would be completely adequate to every purpose of his design, he afterwards perceived himself in some degree mistaken. During the course of publication he has in various instances been kindly favoured with British Shells not before described: neither are the acquisitions which he has himself discovered in several remote parts of the country altogether unworthy of attention. Many of the species thus obtained were deemed too interesting to be omitted in a work of this nature, and it was therefore thought advisable to exclude those, which, from their extreme minuteness, are usually denominated Microscopic Shells, in order to admit the most important of them. The omission of the more diminutive species, for the sake of inserting Shells of conspicuous figure, that had not been before described as English, the Author trusts will rather be considered as an advantage, than detriment to this work. Nothing of material consequence, either in the collection of the Author, or the cabinets of his friends, to which he has access, has been neglected in this selection; and he could not feel himself completely justified in extending the work beyond the limits originally prescribed for no other purpose than to introduce the Microscopic Shells.</p>

               <head>INTRODUCTION. VERMES.</head>
               <p>THIS class of Animals was formerly confounded with Insects and Plants: the <hi>Intestina</hi> and <hi>Mollusca</hi> were referred to the first class: the <hi>Zoophyta</hi> and <hi>Lithophyta</hi> to the latter; and some Authors had even classed the <hi>testacea,</hi> or Shells, as a branch of Mineralogy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding the Animals inhabiting them. Linnaeus, in the <hi>Systema Naturae,</hi> comprehends the whole of these creatures in the last class of Zoology; and forms their classical character from their internal structure, as in larger and more perfect animals: COR uniloculare, inauritum; <hi>Sanie</hi> frigida, albida, Tentaculatis <hi>Vermibus.</hi> Heart fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with one ventricle, without auricle; <hi>sanies</hi> cold and whitish, or colourless. The five orders of the Linnaean class <hi>Vermes</hi> are thus defined:—</p>

               </list>
               <p>Linnaeus has included in the <hi>Testacea</hi> Order the whole tribe of Shells. In the generic characters he regards both the Shell and its inhabitant: in the definition of species, the former only is attended to. There are very strong arguments against the method of arrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this tribe by the Animals, although it cannot be denied, that the Shells are only the coverings or habitations, and should not demand our primary attention<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide DONOVAN'S Instructions for collecting and preserving Subjects of Natural History. London, 1794.</note>.</p>
               <p>The TESTACEA are Vermes of the soft and simple kind, and are covered with a calcareous habitation. These are separated into three divisions, according to the number of valves of which the Shell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists. The first division includes only three genera, <hi>Chiton, Lepas,</hi> and <hi>Pholas;</hi> these are called Multivalves, and are formed of many valves, or pieces, disposed transversely on each other. The second division consists of Bivalves, or Shells of two pieces, connected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a hinge, or cartilage. The third division is of Univalves, and have the Shell complete in one piece, as the word implies. The Linnaean genera are—</p>

                  <p>Many beautiful kinds of this species are found on our coasts. Some are of an uniform, obscure, reddish, or purple colour, without any markings: some are violet, and others bright yellow, or orange. The most elegant kinds are variegated with different colours, as white, red, purple, and brown. The purple kind marbled with irregular spots, and waves of white; and the coral red, with black and white mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and white on the upper part, are select specimens of these elegant varieties.</p>
                  <p>Pennant says, this species is often found in oyster-beds, and dragged up with them. "It is frequent on most of the shores of England; as in Wales; at Margate, and Sheerness, in Kent; in Sussex and Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setshire; in Devonshire; at Lelant and Whitsand Bay, &amp;c. in Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall; the ostium of the river Aln in Northumberland, and many other places." <hi>Da Costa.</hi>

                  <p>This is a very rare species; da Costa received his specimen from Cornwall.</p>

                  <p>The natural size of this shell is shewn at Fig. I. together with its microscopic appearance. It is a very small species, thick, without

                  <p>In the young state, this shell is very transparent and horny, the aperture ovoid, and the margins smooth and level; it has also seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral longitudinal lines of bright blue colour, which extend from the vertex down the back to the margin. According to Linnaeus, these should be four in number; some authors say five, and <hi>Borlase</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions nine. The blue colour is disposed in spots in some specimens; in others in lines; and again in some others in short and interrupted dashes. Linnaeus observes that the bright blue colour has not been found in any Shell except this.</p>
                  <p>The old shells are very different from the young ones, and have been mistaken by some Authors for distinct species. The young shell is remarkable for its pellucidity. The old ones are thicker and larger: the aperture irregular: the vertex two-thirds of the shell; and the rays of blue, dusky. Fig. I. * represents the natural size.</p>
                  <p>The Shell is found on the coast of Cornwall, and on the Dorset coast, near Weymouth. <hi>Martin, Sibbald,</hi> and <hi>Wallace,</hi> received it from the western isles of Scotland and the Orkneys.</p>

               <p>The Lepas Anatifera is found on the coasts of England and Ireland, but more frequently on that of Scotland. It adheres by means of its branches, or pedicles, to the bottoms of ships, planks, logs, and other substances floaring in the water.</p>
               <p>This curious marine production consists of many unequal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braneous branches, or arms, at the ends of which the Shells are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in an irregular manner; the larger clustering with the smaller in groups, and forming bunches of various sizes. The branches are of a fine red; the Shells of a bluish violet. The animal within is a <hi>triton,</hi> and is furnished with many <hi>cirrhi,</hi> or <hi>tentacula,</hi> with which it takes its food. These tentacula are pectinated like feathers, and hang out of the Shells when open. In the sixteenth century they were, in fact, supposed to be feathers, and hence arose the whimsical belief that a barnacle produced a <hi>goose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Linnaeus proposes this as a species, <hi>(Conulus);</hi> but at the same time observes, is may be a small variety of the Trochus Zizyphinus,
<pb facs="tcp:0622700301:41"/>because, like that species, it is imperforated, and has a prominent ridge on the whirls. Pennant says, it is scarcely distinct from <hi>T. Zizy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinus.</hi> Da Costa thinks it certainly a distinct species.</p>
                  <p>If the shell, Fig. 104. Pennant, is correct, it is of a larger growth than any of our specimens. Da Costa says, the size seldom exceeds that of a cherry kernel. Not uncommon on the shores of Sussex; and has been received from the coast of Devonshire.</p>

Da Costa says, he has seen a very small one (of the same species) from the coast of Wales.—Both of these are represented in the annexed plate.</p>

               <p>This is a strong, thick shell, generally about one inch and a half length, of a full pyramidal shape, with a point acute; it has five spires, furrowed: the ridges of the lower wreath notched, or scaled, and very rough. Within the mouth it has five long parallel teeth.</p>
               <p>The colours are various, often of a simple and uniform yellowish brown, sandy, or clay colour; sometimes quite white, or white tinged with violet, and fasciated with yellow or brown; the latter are the most elegant varieties of B. Lapillus.—These shells are found in great abundance near low water-mark, on many of the shores of Great-Britain. It is one of the species that yields the purple dye ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous to the <hi>purpura</hi> of the ancients; and though the value of its dye has been long superseded by the cochineal insect, the shells that produced it are objects of curiosity. The Tyrian purple was the most admired, and is known to have been extracted from a species of the <hi>Murex;</hi> but other purples of inferior lustre are also mentioned by the ancients. Da Costa imagines that the liquor of this Whelke (Buccinum Lapillus) was a valuable purple to the ancient English, and quotes the authority of <hi>Bede,</hi> who lived about the seventh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, for this opinion. "There are," says <hi>Bede,</hi> "snails in very great abundance, from which a scarlet or crimson dye is made, whose elegant redness never fades, either by the heat of the sun, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of rain, but the older it is, the more elegant<note n="*" place="bottom">Sunt cochleae, satis superque abundantes, quibus tinctura coccinei coloris conficitur.

                  <pb facs="tcp:0622700301:51"/>In 1684, Mr. Cole, of Bristol, described the process of extracting the <hi>purple</hi> of this shell, in the Philosophical Transactions. His ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is as follows:</p>
               <p>"The Shells being harder than most of other kinds, are to be broken with a smart stroke with a hammer, on a plate of iron, or firm piece of timber (with their mouths downwards) so as not to crush the body of the fish within; the broken pieces being picked off, there will appear a white vein, lying transversely in a little furrow, or cleft, next to the head of the fish, which must be digged out with the stiff point of a horse-hair pencil, being made short and tapering. The letters, figures, or what else shall be made on the linnen (and perhaps silk too) will presently appear of a pleasant light green colour, and if placed in the sun, will change into the following colours, i. e. if in winter, about noon; if in summer, an hour or two after sun-rising, and so much before setting; for, in the heat of the day in summer, the colours will come on so fast, that the succession of each colour will be scarcely distinguished. Next to the first light green, it will appear of a deep green, and in a few minutes change into a sea-green; after which, in a few minutes more, it will alter into a watchet-blue; from that, in a little time more, it will be of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish-red; after which, lying an hour or two, (supposing the sun still shining) it will be of a very deep purple-red, beyond which the sun can do no more.</p>
               <p>"But then the last and most beautiful colour, after washing in scalding water and soap, will (the matter being again put into the sun or wind to dry) be of a fair bright crimson, or near to the prince's colour, which, afterwards, notwithstanding there is no use of any stiptick to bind the colour, will continue the same, if well ordered,
<pb facs="tcp:0622700301:52"/>as I have found in handkerchiefs that have been washed more than forty times; only it will be somewhat allayed from what it was after the first washing. While the cloth so writ upon lies in the sun, it will yield a very strong and foetid smell, as if garlick and assafoetida were mixed together."</p>

The outside is generally encrusted with filth, balani, &amp;c. beneath which, it has an epidermis of a blackish colour. The shells vary exceedingly in colours, not only in the different stages of growth, but also in the adult state. When young, the colours are remarkably vivid and elegantly disposed; the shell flat and the margins deeply crenated: those of full growth are on the contrary very conic and the colours less brilliant. The margins irregular and the ridges more obsolete. Some authors have considered several varieties as distinct species. Da Costa among others, deems the <hi>Patella depressa</hi> of Pennant, no other than a young variety of the common kind.</p>

               <p>"This species," says Da Costa, "is rare in England. I found it at Mount's Bay in Cornwall, where the fiſhermen told me they call
<pb facs="tcp:0622700301:69"/>it <hi>Queen Fish;</hi> it is also found near <hi>Fowey</hi> and other shores of that county. I have seen some from <hi>Weymouth,</hi> and Mr. Petiver received it from the iſland of Purbeck, in Dorsetshire. Dr. Leigh mentions that it is got on the coasts of Cheshire."</p>
               <p>Pennant has not noticed this Shell. Linnaeus described it as an Asiatic species in the Systema Naturae, but adds it is perhaps an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean species also. In the last edition by Gmelin, it stands expressly as a British Shell. <hi>Habitat in Mari Britannico, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Shell is thick, strong and heavy: the outside smooth and glossy, with numerous concentric transverse wrinkles, and several faint rays in a longitudinal direction. The margins are plain. The inside milk white and glossy.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:0622700301:88"/>Mytilus Modiolus is the largest species of this genus that inhabits the British shores; being from six to seven inches in length, and three in breadth. It is a strong and heavy shell; the outside is of a blackish colour inclining to purple. It is covered with a thin filmy brown epidermis, and often with balani and other remains of crustaceous animals. Within, it is smooth and pearly, and sometimes richly coloured with a variety of vivid hues, in which red, purple and green chiefly predominate. These shells lie only in deep waters, and are never cast upon shore; but sometimes they seize the bait of the ground lines, and are hauled up by the fishermen.</p>
               <p>Da Costa received the M. Modiolus, of a ſmall size, from the Margate flats in Kent; from Cornwall and other English shores. The specimen figured in the annexed Plate is from Scarborough in Yorkshire; thoſe found on the coast of Wales and Scotland, and particularly the Orkneys, are not inferior in point of size to those from Scarborough.</p>

                  <p>The discovery of this rare species on our coast, is ascribed by Da Costa to Dr. Richard Pultney, F. R. S. of Blandford in Dorſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire; he found it on an <hi>ascidia</hi> at Weymouth in that county. It
<pb facs="tcp:0622700301:94"/>has also been met with in Greenland, Iceland, and Norway; and is likewise noted as a native of the Southern Ocean<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Gmelin.</hi>—Probably this variety found in the South Seas is that which <hi>Da Costa</hi> notices in his description of Mytilus discors. "All that <hi>Linné</hi> has <hi>seen,</hi>" (of Mytilus discors) "as well as all those found on our <hi>coasts,</hi> are very small, thin, and delicate; but a kind no wise different, except in <hi>size</hi> and <hi>colour,</hi> being larger than a great walnut, and quite brown, was brought from the southern hemisphere by that great and national honor, Capt. Cook, the circumnavigator, in the late expedition for the discoveries of new countries. These also were entirely <hi>unknown</hi> to all our collectors; and, as they only differ in <hi>size, thickneſs,</hi> and <hi>colour,</hi> but are exactly the same in structure, way of life, and other particulars as theſe of our coasts, is it a <hi>distinct species</hi> or <hi>variety</hi> only?"—As a figure of this very analogous kind may be acceptable, it is introduced in the annexed Plate at fig. 2.</note>.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:0622700301:103"/>This is one of the most singular species that is found on the British coasts. It is very analagous to the famous Scalaris or Wentletrap of the East Indies, which bears such a high price amongst Conchologists; and from this analogy it is called the False Wentletrap. Its length is about an inch, and sometimes two inches or even more. The mouth is perfectly round, and bordered with a thick ring; from this ring arise several distinct equi-distant prominent ridges, generally eight in number, which extend the whole length of the shell in an obliquely longitudinal direction. These ridges appear the more remarkable and prominent, as the spires are very convex or swelled, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from each other by a deep spiral channel. The colour of most specimens is milk white, but is sometimes obscured with brown, or marked transversely with distinct circles of ferruginous interrupted lines.</p>

                  <p>It is needless to enter into detail on a species so well known as the Common Periwinkle; yet it may be proper to observe, these shells, in many instances, vary considerably. The young shells are reddish,
<pb facs="tcp:0622700301:119"/>whitish, yellowish, or brown, of various hues, sometimes uniform, or without any markings; at others, girdled spirally with darker colours. The adults also are sometimes bright red, orange, chesnut, or whitish, or olive, with, and sometimes without, the spiral lineations. They vary no less in size than in colours; and those of the Orkneys, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, are quadruple, the size of those on the Irish or English coast.</p>
                  <p>It is said, the name Periwinkle is a corruption of <hi>Petty Winkle,</hi> or small Winkle, or Whelk.</p>

These shells are generally about an inch, or more, in length, and of a somewhat globose shape; but so extremely irregular and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted, that it can with difficulty be defined. Dr. Wallace calls these shells the twisted pectines of Stroma, a little island that lies in the Pightland Frith; he found them on some parts of the Orkneys, where he observed extraordinary cross and strong tides. The irregular form of these pectines rather surprised him. He adds, "I cannot think the odd strange tumbling the tides make there, can contribute any thing to that frame; yet, after all, I never see them in any other place."—These shells are now found on several of the English shores, as York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, Scarborough, Mouth of the River Tees, and Dorsetshire; and are also frequent in the fossil state, in the chalk pits of Kent and Surry. Both valves are convex, and much diſtorted, but the under one is usually the most irregular; the ribs are numerous, close set, longitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, and prominent. The inside of the lower valve is smooth and white, when alive, and that of the upper has a pearly gloss. The outside is generally of a dingy white, or yellowish cast; sometimes pale violet, or russety; or white mottled, and varied with brown, or brilliant red.</p>
               <p>The ears of this shell are large, and nearly equal, but are often so distorted as to appear much otherwise. It is proper to observe, that though the irregular form this shell assumes may be attributed to some injury is has sustained in its growth, every shell of this species is conſtantly found with the same diſtorted appearance. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance leaves no reason to doubt that such diſtortions are characteriſtic of this extraordinary and peculiar species.</p>
