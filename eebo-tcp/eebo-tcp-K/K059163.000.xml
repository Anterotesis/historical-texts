            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TO
<hi>Benjamin Hoadly.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BE it known unto thee, Friend <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
that albeit we, who are the People of
the Lord, own thee not in thy proud
Titles, neither in thy Office, as thou exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
the ſame; neither can we treat thee with
that Diſtinction wherewith Men diſtinguiſh
thee, foraſmuch as we do not acknowledge
the ſame (as thou doſt) to be of God: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
I ſhall treat thee reſpectfully in
this thing, whereof I am now to commune
with thee, ſeeing thou haſt uttered much
Truth with thy Mouth, and therefore haſt
moved much Wrath of wicked Men againſt
thee.</p>
            <p>And would'ſt thou, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> faithfully
purſue the Light which I perceive is in thee,
and which ſhineth abroad far and nigh; I
ſay, would'ſt thou act according to the Light
which I plainly ſee is in thee, thou ſhould'ſt
have Praiſe; for thou haſt verily <hi>done wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,</hi>
in that thou haſt reſtored the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0707200800:3"/>
to them to whom it ſolely appertaineth,
and haſt dethroned the Uſurpations of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Men, who have unrighteouſly ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up in the Throne of Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Verily, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> thou haſt done worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in that thou haſt appeared for the Cauſe
of our God againſt the Unrighteouſneſs of
Men; and haſt not been afraid, neither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
when they have riſen up againſt
thee with great Wrath: And I am ſent unto
thee to declare in words of Seriouſneſs, that
thou ſhould'ſt not faint, neither be diſmay'd,
for that many of the Faithful Servants of
God are with thee in this thing, and do ſay
unto thee <hi>God ſpeed,</hi> which thou knoweſt
we are forbidden to ſay unto the ungodly,
and unto Men who are not led in the right
way.</p>
            <p>Having thus given my Teſtimony to thy
good Works, I communicated my Intentions
to Friends: Among theſe, <hi>Aminadab,</hi> a
righteous Man, fearing not the Face of Men,
but fearing God only, <hi>ſaith unto thee,</hi> that
his Heart is likewiſe with thee in the things
which thou haſt ſaid; <hi>to wit,</hi> That the Power
of Men, or the Laws of Men, have no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to interfere with, or to join their
Power with the Right Hand of Jeſus, who
allows no Partners in the Throne of his
Glorious Kingdom on Earth, any more than
he will admit Partners in the Throne of his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0707200800:4"/>
Gloriſy'd Kingdom in Heaven. Moreover,
he hath ſent Meſſengers unto me, ſaying,
Speak thou <hi>Ebenezer</hi> in the Ears of <hi>Benjamin
Hoadly,</hi> and ſay unto him, Fear not the Face
of Men, tho' many riſe up againſt thee, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Thou lyeſt, thou lyeſt; for verily thou
lyeſt not <hi>Benjamin,</hi> but haſt ſpoken the
Truth, and it ſhall prevail.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aaron,</hi> a Man filled with Knowledge, and
a Teacher of Wiſdom, ſent alſo unto me,
ſaying, <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> the thing which <hi>Aminadab</hi>
our Friend hath communicated unto thee
concerning <hi>Benjamin Hoadly,</hi> are things
which ſavour of Truth; and thou wilt do
well to ſpeak unto the ſaid <hi>Benjamin,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Fear not <hi>Benjamin,</hi> for wiſe Men are
with thee, and good Men are with thee; and
verily they be better Men, and more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that are with thee than thoſe that be
againſt thee.</p>
            <p>I might name unto thee many Friends, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with Wiſdom and Knowledge, who
ſpeak well of thee, for that thou haſt ſpoken
the Truth with great boldneſs, and haſt not
feared to utter it, even in the hearing of the
King, and we may not doubt but that our
Lord the King will be thy ſtrong Helper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all thine Enemies, and will aſſiſt thee
to ſilence the Gain-ſayers of thy Doctrine;
for verily, the King is an unfeigned Friend
unto the Truth, and would be willing that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0707200800:5"/>
all Men ſhould walk in the path to Heaven,
howbeit he may not be inlightned equal to
our Friends, which nevertheleſs we hope he
may hereafter be, if God ſeeth it good to
bring his Heart over unto us.</p>
            <p>And albeit Friend <hi>Benjamin,</hi> thou art not
yet joined unto the faithful Servants of God
our Friends, but that thou for a little while
remaineſt, as to ſome things, in the Darkneſs
of the World; yet foraſmuch as thou join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
with us in the Truth, we embrace thee
willingly, nothing doubting but that the
Heavenly Light which has ſhone out in thy
Word, will hereafter ſhine in thy Heart,
and thou wilt come over more perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us Friends, who are already eſtabliſhed in
the Truth.</p>
            <p>And I am the farther confirm'd in the truth
hereof, in that thou haſt ſo boldly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the Truths of God, being the ſame
profeſſed by us, and for the ſake whereof
we are inclin'd to think well of thee; and
ſeeing I have informed thee that thou haſt
ſo exactly taught what we in Principle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and cloſely adhere to in Practice, I
ſhall let thee know, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> how exactly
thou agreeſt with us who have received the
Truth, and that we hold and believe all the
Truths that thou haſt taught, and that alſo
even in the ſame words in which thou haſt
declared them, or but with ſmall variation
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0707200800:6"/>
thereof, as thou wilt farther be informed,
when thou ſhalt read the following Heads,
which are part of <hi>the Principles of Truth,
or of thoſe things about Doctrine, which we
Friends do moſt ſurely believe and recieve;</hi> to
wit,</p>
            <q rend="inline">
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning Religion, we believe, that it is
only the Spirit of the Lord that makes Men
truly Religious; and no Man ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to or from any exerciſe or practice in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
by any outward Law or Power, but every
Man ought to be left free, as the Lord ſhall
perſwade his own mind, in doing, or leaving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
this or the other practice in Religion; and
every Man of what Profeſſion in Religion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ought to be protected in Peace; provided
himſelf be a Man of Peace, not ſeeking the wrong
of any Man's Perſon or Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And we believe, That to reprove falſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and unſound Doctrines and Principles ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to convince them that oppoſe themſelves, by
Exhortation or ſharp Reproof, by word or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
ought not to be counted a breach of the
Peace; or to ſtrive about the things of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, by Men of contrary Minds or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
this ought not to be puniſhed by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
and their Laws: for we believe that
the outward Laws and Powers of the Earth are
only to preſerve Mens Perſons and Eſtates, and
not to preſerve Men in Opinions: neither ought
the Laws of the Nation to be laid upon Mens</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0707200800:7"/>
                  <hi>Conſciences, to bind them to or from ſuch a

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And we believe, That Chriſt is, and ought only
to be Lord and Exerciſer of Mens Conſciences,
and his Spirit muſt only lead into all Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And we believe, That Obedience and Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Lord belongs to Superiors, and that
Subjects ought to obey them [in the Lord] that
have rule over them: and that Children ought
to obey their Parents, and Wives their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
and Servants their Maſters in all things,
which is according to God, which ſtand in the
exerciſe of a pure Conſcience towards God: But
where Rulers, Parents or Maſters, or any other,
command or require Subjection in any thing
which is contrary to God, or not according to
him, in ſuch caſes all People are free, and ought
to obey God rather than Man; and we believe,
that herein God will juſtifie them, being guided
and led by his Spirit in all that which is good,
and out of all that which is evil.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Herein, Friend <hi>Benjamin,</hi> thou mayeſt ſee,
as in a Viſion of clear Light, that thou art
in the ſame way of Truth with us, and I
have Freedom to own thee therein; for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
thou haſt clearly teſtified unto <hi>the Truth
which we believe,</hi> in that thou haſt likewiſe
ſaid, even in our Words, <hi>That every Man
ought to be left free as the Lord ſhall perſwade
his own Mind.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0707200800:8"/>
Now <hi>Benjamin</hi> let it not ſeem ſtrange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, that I ſay unto thee, that theſe are
our own Words; for I ſpeak therein with
Truth and Soberneſs, referring thee for
Teſtimony thereof unto a little Book pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
more than Forty and Five Years ſince,
by a Body of our Friends, and Signed by
<hi>John Crook,</hi> a Man endowed with a Spirit of
a ſound Mind, and alſo by three other Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
who were likewiſe Men of true Wiſdom.
This Book is Entituled, <hi>Truth's Principles,</hi>
&amp;c. in which Book the Words which I have
written unto thee above, are to be found.</p>
            <p>Searching likewiſe thy Book, <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
which thou haſt made Publick, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the King, I find theſe Words, which
I hope thou haſt learned from our Friends
above written; to wit, That the Language
of the Word is, <hi>That knowing the Terrors of
the Lord, we</hi> ſhould <hi>perſwade Men;</hi> but that
the Language of the Mens Conduct, who
profeſs to ſucceed Him that Taught the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is, That having the Terrors of this
World in their power, they do not perſwade
Men, but <hi>force their outward Profeſſion againſt
their inward Perſwaſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verily thou haſt ſpoken, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> as one
having the Light of the Spirit; and this is a
Truth which the Men of the World cannot
be able to reſiſt. Verily, Friend <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
we agree with thee, that the Kingdom of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0707200800:9"/>
Jeſus is not of this World, and that the
Laws of his Kingdom likewiſe, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Puniſhments of thoſe Laws, are
ſuited to the end of thoſe Laws, and to the
Nature of his Kingdom: Nay, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> I will
uſe thy Words as thou haſt uſed the Words
of wiſe Men, who went before thee; to wit,
<q rend="inline">"The <hi>Laws</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> therefore, as
<hi>Chriſt</hi> left them, have nothing of <hi>this</hi>
World in their view; not Tendency, either
to the Exaltation of <hi>Some,</hi> in wordly
Pomp and Dignity; or to their abſolute
Dominion over the Faith and Religious
conduct of <hi>Others</hi> of his Subjects; or to
the erecting of any ſort of <hi>Temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
under the Covert of Name of a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
One."<p>"The <hi>Sanctions</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Law</hi> are <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
and <hi>Puniſhments.</hi> But of what
ſort? Not the Rewards of this Worlds;
not the Offices, or Glories, of this State;
not the Pains of <hi>Priſons, Baniſhments,
Fines,</hi> or any leſſer and more <hi>moderate Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties;</hi>
nay, not the much leſſer <hi>Negative
Diſcouragements</hi> that belong to <hi>Humane
Society. He</hi> was far from thinking that
<hi>Theſe</hi> could be the Inſtruments of ſuch a
<hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> as He thought acceptable to
God. But, as the Great End of his
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> was to guide Men to Happineſs,
after the ſhort Images of it were over
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0707200800:10"/>
here below; ſo, he took his <hi>Motives</hi>
from that place where his <hi>Kingdom</hi> firſt
began, and where it was at laſt to end;
from thoſe <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments</hi> in
a future State, which had no relation to
this World: And to ſhew that his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was not of this World,</hi> all the <hi>Sanctions</hi>
which He thought fit to give to <hi>His Laws,</hi>
were <hi>not of this World</hi> at all."</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I confirm theſe thy Poſitions and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines,
<hi>Benjamin,</hi> with my Voice, and give
thee Praiſe therefore, for verily thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Praiſe, not only that thou haſt ſpoken
boldly the Truth, but for that thou haſt
done it in the Face of the Adverſary, and
haſt not been afraid. And Bleſſed be the
King, into whoſe Heart God hath put it to
Frown upon the Gainſayers; and albeit they
were gathered together againſt thee, he hath
ſeattered them, and hath ſent them away diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.</p>
            <p>Neither
do I flatter thee with my Lips;
for Friends are not Guilty of ſuch things,
and it would be in me a great Iniquity; but
I ſpeak to thee in Sincerity and in Truth,
and my Thoughts are moved to utter the
Words of my Mouth; for verily thou haſt
dethroned and pulled down that Man of Sin,
the <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> which <hi>has Exalted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi>
thou haſt valintly Encountred the
Tribe of ungodly Prieſts, who have by an
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0707200800:11"/>
Injurious Uſage of the Lord's People, for
many Years uſurped the Authority of King
Jeſus, and have exerciſed Dominion over the
Souls who they have had committed by Men
unto their Charge; theſe they have Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
over, and have Cruelly Perſecuted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of Authority from Jeſus; albeit
Jeſus the true King and only Head of all true
Believers, as thou haſt well ſaid, hath given
no ſuch Authority unto them.</p>
            <p>Now concerning Miniſters I will tell thee
what Friends do ſurely Receive and Believe,
and I will not give thee my own words, but
the words of the ſaid Declaration of <hi>Truth's
Principles</hi> mention'd before; to wit,</p>
            <q rend="inline">
               <p>"Such Miniſters as are made by God, who
are ſanctified by his Word and Power, who
have freely received perfect Gifts from
God, and ſo by the Spirit and Power of
God are ſent forth into the World, to turn
the People from Darkneſs to Light, and
from the Power of Satan to the Power of
God; who freely Miniſter unto others,
without coveting any Man's Gold, or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or Apparel; not ſeeking theirs, but
them: Warning every Man and teaching
every Man in all Wiſdom, that they might
preſent every Man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus:
ſuch as miniſter from the Spirit, and have
the Word of God abiding in them; who
are never unprovided, but at all times and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0707200800:12"/>
ſeaſons, and in all places, do ſpeak and
declare the Truth, as they are moved and
inſtructed, and as the Spirit of Truth doth
give them utterance; Such Miniſters we
own, and have in great eſteem."</p>
            </q>
            <p>This we ſurely do Believe, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and
thou haſt done worthily in concurring with
us, and in that thou haſt taken away from
thoſe who call themſelves <hi>Miniſters,</hi> all that
Power and pretended Authority which they
aſſume, and which we ſay they uſurp contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Nature of the Office of a Miniſter,
which we alſo Declare to be only to Teach
and Inſtruct, not to Terrify and Affright the
People of the Lord; and herein we know,
that altho' thou wilt offend them, and they
will ſhew great Wrath againſt thee therefore;
yet, <hi>I ſay,</hi> we know thou haſt ſpoken the
Truth againſt them, and I concur with thee
therein; nay I acknowledge thee and own
thee therein, becauſe thou haſt concurred
with us in the Truth, not doubting but thou
wilt be farther inlightned, in the Lord's due
time, to joyn with Friends in all the words
of Truth which we Profeſs.</p>
            <p>I muſt farther ſay in thy behalf, Friend
<hi>Benjamin,</hi> that thou haſt ſpoken Excellent
words of Wiſdom in defiance of the Men of
high Notions, who are of the Tribe who thou
didſt belong to in former time; for thou haſt
taken the People out of their hands, and haſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0707200800:13"/>
ſet them free from the mock Terrors of Vain
Men, ſuch as they call the Artillery of the
Church; which we that know the ways of
Truth, are acquainted with the Deceitfulneſs
of; and as I Glory in thy Words thereupon,
I ſhall repeat them in thy Praiſe as followeth,
to wit,</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Not the leaſt Tittle of Salvation or
Damnation depends upon the Will of weak
Men, but all upon God and your ſelves;
Humane Benedictions, Humane Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

have nothing to do with
the Favour or Anger of God: But are Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Engins, permitted to work (<hi>like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Evils</hi>) by Providence."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are Excellent Things ſpoken with
Wiſdom, and thou ſhalt have due Praiſe of
the ſame: Likewiſe haſt thou Batter'd down
the ſtrong Holds of Satan, in thy Words on
the ſame Subject.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To theſe Truths of thine, ſuch I call them,
as thou haſt been honoured to ſpeak them
firſt among Men, I bear my Teſtimony, and
the good People, the People of the Lord,
deſpiſed by Men, of whom I am the
meaneſt, have born their Teſtimony many
Years ago: I ſay, with thee, that the boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0707200800:15"/>
Terms which thoſe Men make wicked uſe
of, ſuch as <hi>Regular</hi> and <hi>uninterrupted Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
Authoritative Benedictions, Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,
Abſolutions,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>Vain Words,</hi>
mere <hi>Terrors of Men,</hi> not the Terrors of the
Lord, <hi>Niceties</hi> and <hi>Trifles:</hi> And therefore it
is that we diſown the whole Tenor and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Canons and Inſtitutions of that
which they Prophanely, as I doubt not thou
wilt in time be led by theſe Lights to do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo;
I Deſpiſe and Contemn all the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Authority of that which they weakly and
impertinently call, a Power derived from
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> I know no Miniſters
but ſuch as is before deſcribed; as for <hi>ſuch as
are brought up at Schools and Colleges, and ſo
made Miniſters by the will of Man, who have
not freely received perfect Gifts from God for
perfecting of the Saints, but denies</hi> Perfection,
<hi>and ſo denies the Miniſters Work, neither do
miniſter freely, but ſeek for Gain from their
Quarters, and will not Preach without a price;
who are not ſanctified by the Word of God, but
plead for a continuance in Sin while People
walk upon the Earth: Such as Miniſter from
the Letter, and not from the Spirit; who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Preach except they have time to Study, and
ſo by their induſtry provide themſelves, and are
not provided of the Lord (ſuch a Ministry is
of Works, and not the Free Gift from God)
ſuch cannot profit People, but lead them captive</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0707200800:16"/>
               <hi>in an empty and dead Form,</hi> always hearing,
but never able to come to the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God: <hi>Such called Miniſters we do
deny, and turn from them, and teſtifie againſt
them, as the holy men of God formerly did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt not, Friend <hi>Benjamin,</hi> but thy
Words tend to bring thee to the ſame Juſt
Contempt, that I have entertained, and that
Friends moſt righteouſly do entertain of theſe
<hi>uncalled</hi> Prieſts, and that in the mean time
thou wilt, by thy <hi>ſober</hi> and weighty Speeches,
bring all that wicked Hierarchy, which thoſe
Prieſts ſo violently contend for, into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
among the People.</p>
            <p>I am therefore moved to bear my Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
with thee againſt them; foraſmuch as
they uſurping high Dignity and Authority,
have erected a Kingdom which they ſay is
the Kingdom of Jeſus; howbeit, as I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
think, it is a Kingdom of this World,
foraſmuch as they exerciſe Juriſdictions which
be of this World therein, and have taken to
themſelves Powers which be of themſelves;
which nevertheleſs they take upon them to
ſay, are deſcended to them, and by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and pretences of a Succeſſion of thoſe
Powers, they aſſume a Right to Exerciſe
thoſe Powers over the Conſciences of Men,
which Friends ſay they have no Right to
do: And furthermore we ſay and believe,
That whereas they Exerciſe the Power and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0707200800:17"/>
Authority which alone belongs to King
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> the King and ſole Chief of his faithful
Followers; they therefore erect their own
Kingdom, not the Kingdom of King <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
and exerciſe the Authority and Power, which
is his only, as their own.</p>
            <p>I rejoice, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> that thou haſt publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
true Doctrine, and haſt given thy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
with us to the Truth, which we on ſo
good and ſolid Foundations have receiv'd;
and I queſtion not but thou wilt be aſſiſted
by the Spirit of Truth to pull down and
overthrow the whole Power; Hierarchy and
Conſtitution of that People who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>The Church;</hi> verily, they are Uſurpers
of the Kingdom and Throne of King <hi>Jeſus;</hi>
and thou ſhalt be a Champion of the Truth,
in that thou ſhalt overthrow thoſe Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick
<hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> which are
not of God, and ſhalt eſtabliſh true Religion
in that mighty Principle of Heavenly Light,
in which it is only to be found.</p>
            <p>This is that inward Revelation which
thou haſt been obliged to bear thy Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
unto, (<hi>viz</hi>) That Light <hi>which perſwades</hi>
the Minds of Men, and whereby every ſtep
of Reformation which hath been made in
the World, hath been juſtified, and which,
as thou ſayeſt well, is all the Account which
Proteſtants can give for their being reform'd
from the People call'd <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0707200800:18"/>
And doubtleſs thou haſt by the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
juſtified all thoſe, the People of
the Lord, who <hi>being perſwaded</hi> in themſelves
of their being guided by Heavenly Light,
have ſeparated and withdrawn from theſe
Uſurpations, of which thou haſt ſpoken ſo
worthily.</p>
            <p>And what remains, beloved Friend <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi>
but that thou ſhouldſt, according as
thou haſt worthily begun, and according to
the Light which ſhineth in thy Mind, <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
thy ſelf from</hi> theſe Uſurpers of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Authority, and joining thy ſelf with
<hi>the Friends</hi> to Truth, ſhouldſt bear thy Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
againſt all Ungodlineſs; for verily
<hi>Benjamin,</hi> thou canſt not but ſee and abhor
the Doctrine which theſe Men teach, ſaying,
We are the Church, and Power is with us;
which thou knoweſt is falſe, and is not of
God, and that the Power which they uſe is
not of God, but is the Power of Men, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ungodly Dominion and Uſurpation;
ſuch as is that of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
nevertheleſs they have diſowned while they
yet practice.</p>
            <p>For verily, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> it ſeemeth to me
that thou who haſt received ſuch Light, and
haſt acknowledged the Truths which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to theſe Men, canſt not any
longer continue among them, or wear thoſe
prophane Enſigns of Idolatry, whereby thou
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0707200800:19"/>
art diſtinguiſhed from other Men, even in a
manner which thou thy ſelf knoweſt is not
appointed by King <hi>Jeſus:</hi> For verily, <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi>
the Robes of Diſtinction which thou
weareſt, and wherewith thou art honoured
among Men, are the Enſigns of that uſurp'd
Power which thou haſt ſo worthily condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and thou canſt not longer abide among
thoſe who thou knoweſt are the Enemies to
the Light which thou haſt receiv'd, and who
walk contrary to the Doctrine which thou
haſt taught, and which we the Lord's People
have ſo many Years ago receiv'd.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I am mov'd to advertiſe thee,
in behalf of the Truth, that thou ſhouldſt
not delay any longer joining thy ſelf unto
the Lord's People, whoſe Cauſe thou haſt
already ſo worthily pleaded: For why
ſhouldſt thou not cauſe thy Life and thy
Doctrine to conform unto each other? And
why ſhouldſt thou decline to profeſs openly
thy adherence to the Lord's People, whilſt
thou doſt not decline to teach the Principles
which they believe, and which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the beginning?</p>
            <p>It is true, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> the mean and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Station of thoſe who be Teachers and
Miniſters of the Lord among us, may not
be agreeable to thy preſent Temper, who art
exalted to be great among Men; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
thou knoweſt that the Kingdom of <hi>Jeſus</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0707200800:20"/>
is not of this World, and that likewiſe <hi>his
Rewards are not of this World,</hi> as thou haſt
moſt worthily taught; ſo <hi>Benjamin,</hi> how
ſhouldſt thou not reject the Honours given
by Men, which are the Rewards iſſuing from
that uſurped Power which is not according
to the Laws of <hi>his Kingdom</hi>! Theſe ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
according to thy own Rules, are not of
God, neither canſt thou, who art now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
from a higher Spirit, ſubmit to be
deck'd with their Ornaments, but ſhouldſt
caſt them off, like as Chriſtians in Primitive
Times refuſed to be deck'd with the <hi>Garlands</hi>
and <hi>Veſtments</hi> of Idolatrous Prieſts; and
like as thoſe People who are called <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>
refuſe and deteſt the Habiliments and
Veſtments, Titles, Dignities and Diſtinctions,
of the Popiſh Prieſts, chooſing to be called
by the truly venerable Name of <hi>Miniſters of
Chriſt,</hi> rather than by the Titles of <hi>Popes,
Cardinals, Abbots, Monks, Friers,</hi> and the
like.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch then as the Uſurpers of the
Power and Authority of <hi>King Jeſus</hi> have
manifeſtly invaded his Crown and Judicatory
alſo, as thou haſt ſaid, and have ſet up
Marks of their uſurp'd Authority, <hi>to wit,</hi>
their Antichriſtian <hi>Excommunications, Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
Exorciſms,</hi> and other profane Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
and have likewiſe given Honours,
which our Lord and only Soveraign <hi>Jeſus</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0707200800:21"/>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> never gave, it ſeemeth unto me, that
thou <hi>Benjamin,</hi> who haſt ſo manfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned
their Power and Authority, and
haſt expoſed their Uſurpation to ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
or at leaſt haſt contemned it in thy
Heart, and with the Words of thy Mouth;
<hi>I ſay,</hi> it ſeemeth unto me that thou canſt
not receive the Honours given by that uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
Authority without ſome Breach upon
the aforeſaid Declaration of thy Principles,
and acting therein contrary to the Light
which is within thee.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> I admoniſh thee
to conſider that thou canſt not abide in the
Truth which thou haſt now taught in thy
Speaking Place, and publiſhed with boldneſs
in Printed Papers, unleſs thou <hi>comeſt out</hi> from
among that ſort of People, of whom thou
art ſaid now to be a Ruler; <hi>foraſmuch</hi> as
thou haſt declared them to be Workers of
Iniquity, and Sons of <hi>Belial:</hi> Thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
therefore will not ſuffer thee to be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any longer by their Name; neither canſt
thou be found any longer to own and join
thy ſelf unto them: Canſt thou, <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
be joined unto Uſurpers of the Authority of
thy Maſter and King? Canſt thou ſhare his
Power, whom thou haſt ſo loudly declared
to be the <hi>ſole Lawgiver</hi> and <hi>Governour</hi> of his
Kingdom? Do not theſe Men continue their
Uſurpations? Do they not continue to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0707200800:22"/>
claim that Authority which, <hi>as thou haſt ſaid,</hi>
appertains only to Chriſt the King? And
thou knoweſt, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> they will continue
to claim the ſame, and to exerciſe it, as if
it was granted unto them, albeit thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
that it is not. Wherefore, O Man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
thy ſelf ſpeedily from theſe Men;
yea, I know thou wilt remove thy ſelf from
them: For why ſhouldſt thou be found at
laſt in the company of thoſe Men whom
thou haſt filled with Contempt, <hi>ſaying,</hi> They
are Enemies to the Kingdom of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the
World.</p>
            <p>Verily, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> thou haſt done well in
that thou haſt openly declared the Iniquity
of thoſe who have armed themſelves with
unlawful Power, and have exerciſed Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
over their Brethren, <hi>ſaying,</hi> Ye muſt
join with us, otherwiſe ye ſhall go to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
or otherwiſe you ſhall have no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
or Part or Lot among us; whereas
King <hi>Jeſus</hi> never left any ſuch Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But it remaineth as a Difficulty, or
Doubt, unto us who are Friends, how thou
canſt, O <hi>Benjamin,</hi> lay a Confederacy with
theſe Men! Art not thou therein an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
alſo with them of the Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of thy only Lord and King; and
that in a much groſſer manner than they?
Verily, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> if thou come not out
from among them, thou wilt give occaſion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0707200800:23"/>
to wicked Men to ſay of thee, that thou
haſt ſaid that in thy Teaching Office which
thou wilt not put in practice in thy own
Perſon; and they will ſpeak evil words of
thee, <hi>ſaying,</hi> Thou teacheſt Men to do what
thou ſhunneſt to do thy ſelf; and that thou
ſhunneſt not thoſe things which thou teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
others to ſhun and avoid. Moreover,
<hi>Benjamin,</hi> Art thou not even at this time,
and after the ſimilitude of thine own words,
according to thy own Doctrine, an Uſurper
of the Authority of <hi>King Jeſus,</hi> in that
thou continueſt to exerciſe that ſame Power,
of which thou haſt ſaid that <hi>King Jeſus</hi>
gave no ſuch Power unto Men, <hi>to wit,</hi> that
profane unlawful Power which thoſe whom
Men call Biſhops generally exerciſe over
their Brethren, oppreſſing the Lord's People
in their ungodly Courts. Doſt thou not
preſide in thy uſurped Judicature, exerciſing
that Power there which thou haſt ſaid, <hi>the
Lord hath not given thee a Right to exerciſe</hi>?
And doſt thou not there make uſe of thoſe
things which thou haſt owned to be <hi>Trifles</hi>
and <hi>Nullities,</hi> to wit, <hi>Excommunications,
Abſolutions,</hi> and ſuch like things? I ſay,
Doſt thou not ſuffer theſe things to be done
in thy Name, to the Subjects of thy Lord,
in thoſe Seats of Evil Men called Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick
Courts? And how canſt thou do this
after thou haſt ſo plainly told us, that this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0707200800:24"/>
is to make thy ſelf King in the ſtead of thy
King Jeſus. Nay, Friend <hi>Benjamin,</hi> in this
thou haſt not done well; <hi>foraſmuch alſo,</hi> as
thou haſt ſinned herein againſt the Light
that is in thee, and haſt cauſed thy Feet to
tread aſide out of the Path of Truth, which
thou haſt chalked out for others, that they
might walk therein: But I truſt that thou wilt
be guided by the good Spirit, and by the
light of Truth ſhining in thy Soul, and then
thou wilt be ſure to come away and remove
from the Tents of wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, Friend <hi>Benjamin,</hi> as I know
that the Truth hath been ſpoken by thee,
I warn thee, for thy good, that thou come
out ſpeedily from among them; lay down
thy painted Veſtments, and prophane Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
the Enſigns of that Uſurpation upon
thy Lord and Maſter's Kingdom, which thou
haſt ſo faithfully born thy Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt;
<hi>I ſay,</hi> I exhort thee to lay them
down ſpeedily, and come out from among
them forthwith, <hi>joyning thy ſelf unto us,</hi>
whoſe Principles thou haſt acknowledged:
So ſhall thy Life and Doctrine be Uniform,
and thou ſhalt be ſure to deſerve that Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
which attends thoſe who are not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to Practice the things which they Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe,
<hi>Benjamin,</hi> this will enable thee
to overcome the Gainſayers; for behold
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0707200800:25"/>
they do already upbraid thee herewith; and
verily the Man called <hi>Andrew Snape,</hi> hath
ſpoken unto thee Words of ſcorning with
boldneſs, in a Book which he ſtileth, a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
written unto thee; and in the Twenty
and Fifth Page thereof, that <hi>if the Caſe be as
thou haſt ſaid, it is the</hi> Men called Parſons,
<hi>have nothing more to do but to throw up their
Orders, ſince their Church hath no need of them,
and ſince they not only do no Service, but are
Guilty of a Criminal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe hath the ſame <hi>Andrew Snape</hi> ſaid
unto thee in his ſaid Book, and in the Thirty
and Sixth Page thereof, theſe words, <hi>to wit,</hi>
That he doth not ſee <hi>how, upon theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
thou canſt take thy place in the Provincial
Sanhedrim of the Prieſts,</hi> or how <hi>thou canſt
require Subſcriptions or Declarations of thoſe
of the Sons of the Prophets whom thou doſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Prieſthood among thy People,</hi> or how
<hi>thou canſt Exerciſe almoſt any Act of Epiſcopal
Juriſdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now verily, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> albeit this ſame
<hi>Andrew Snape</hi> is a Man by his Profeſſion in
an evil way, and ſuch as I allow not to be
according to the Truth; yet nevertheleſs
herein hath he ſpoken unto thee words
which thou ſhouldeſt conſider well of; for
that they are of weight unto thee, <hi>to wit,</hi>
That thou ſhouldſt ſeparate thy ſelf from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil-doers,
whoſe ways thou knoweſt to be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0707200800:26"/>
Wrong; and that whereas thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
them for Uſurpation, and Invaſion
of the Kingdom of <hi>King Jeſus,</hi> thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
not at the ſame time continue among
them, or ſit in thy Seat in their Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it ſeemeth unto me, <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
that whereas thou haſt replied to <hi>Andrew
Snape</hi> in harſh Words, ſaying, That he hath
evil entreated thee, and hath written bitter
things againſt thee, and things which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
not of Truth; yet nevertheleſs, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that thou haſt not ſaid one word unto
him to Gainſay what he hath told thee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
thy coming out from among them,
or that thou canſt not, by thy own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
take thy Seat in the Aſſembly of thy
Prieſts; wherefore I rejoice in thy behalf,
nothing doubting but that thou wilt come
and join thy ſelf with the Lord's People,
who are Friends unto the Truth, and unto
all that thou haſt ſaid of the Uſurpation of
Men, and as I have already given thee to
underſtand, have many Years received the
Truths which thou haſt Preached at this
day.</p>
            <p>Neither let it grieve thee, Friend <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
that thou ſhalt relinquiſh the things which
Men call Honours and Greatneſs, and ſhalt
loſe thereby the Advantages and Profits
which thou doſt now receive; foraſmuch as
thou knoweſt that the Rewards of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0707200800:27"/>
               <hi>of Jeſus,</hi> are <hi>not of this World;</hi> and if
the Rewards of this World are the Sanctions
of the Kingdom whereof thou haſt ſpoken,
then it is not of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> So that thou ſhalt
only relinquiſh the Rewards of this World,
and ſhalt ſeek the Rewards of that Kingdom
which is not of this World.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being ſo naturally drawn
from thy own words, I truſt thou wilt not
Heſitate thereat, but wilt accept of my
wholeſome Advice, and ſhew thy ſelf not to
be aſhamed of the practiſing thoſe things
whereof thou haſt teſtify'd, <hi>ſaying,</hi> That they
are True.</p>
            <p>Neither canſt thou, Friend <hi>Benjamin,</hi> be
in danger of joyning with any other People
than thoſe, whoſe Profeſſion I have here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
thee to; ſince there are not any who
have received the Truths which thou haſt
Preached in their full Degrees, ſo as the
People, who in contempt are called <hi>Quakers;</hi>
with whom, as I have ſhewed, thou haſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
conformed thy ſelf to the Honour of
thy Judgment, and of the divine Light ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth in thee.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe People called <hi>Presbyterians,</hi>
thou canſt by no means joyn thy ſelf unto
them, ſeeing they have declared themſelves
in Terms greatly oppoſite to thy Doctrines,
ſaying, That Men have Power to make Laws,
binding the Conſciences of others; and that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0707200800:28"/>
Rewards and Puniſhments of this World ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to Humane Authority, exerciſed by
ſuch as they call a Succeſſion of Officers:
Theſe their Opinions are not according to
Truth, as Friends have received it; neither
are they like unto thoſe. Truths which thou
haſt Preached: And therefore we ſee that
queſtionleſs thou wilt avoid alſo the Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Opinions of Perſecuting <hi>Presbyterians,</hi>
and wilt joyn thy ſelf unto us; and this I
ſpeak unto thee with the more certainty, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch</hi>
as, Bleſſed by the Lord, thou art al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
come beyond the corrupt Tenets of
thoſe People: Moreover, beloved Friend
<hi>Benjamin,</hi> I make known unto thee, that the
ſaid <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are equally guilty of thoſe
things which the People of the Lord abhor;
<hi>to wit,</hi> The pretences to a Power, which, as
thou ſaidſt well, <hi>Jeſus</hi> the King of all thoſe
who are led by the light of the Truth, never
delegated to them; and this they not only
give to their Followers, but make Laws of
their own; <hi>I ſay,</hi> Humane Laws, and Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Laws, ſuch as Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for enforcing others to comply there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with;
to wit, That they admit none to be
Teachers among them, or to Preach and
Propheſy unto the People, unleſs they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
to believe and to receive certain Points
which they call <hi>prophanely,</hi> Articles of Faith;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0707200800:29"/>
wherein theſe wicked uſurpations of Power
are openly declared by them, ſaying,</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">
                  <p>1. "That the Lord Jeſus, as King and
Head of his Church, hath therein appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Government in the hand of Church-Officers
diſtinct from the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate."</p>
                  <p>2. "That to theſe Officers the Keys of
the Kingdom of Heaven are committed;
by Vertue whereof they have Power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively
to Retain and Remit Sins, to ſhut
that Kingdom againſt the Impenitent, both
by the Word and Cenſures, and to open
it unto penitent Sinners, by the Miniſtry
of the Goſpel, and by Abſolution from
Cenſures, as occaſion ſhall require."</p>
                  <p>3. "That theſe Church Cenſures are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> for preventing the Wrath of
God, which might fall upon the Church,
if they ſhould ſuffer the Seal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to be prophaned by Notorious and
Obſtinate Offenders."</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things thou knoweſt, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> are
contrary to the Doctrines and Poſitions
which thou haſt ſo openly avowed, being no
leſs than Invaſions, and manifeſt Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of the Kingdom and Authority of King
Jeſus, and in themſelves <hi>Nullities</hi> and <hi>Trifles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet theſe things, and in theſe Words,
thou wilt find in thoſe <hi>Heads of Belief,</hi> which
theſe ungodly <hi>Presbyterians</hi> call the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0707200800:30"/>
of their Faith, <hi>Article</hi> the XXX. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
Bleſſed art thou, O <hi>Benjamin,</hi> in that
thou haſt born thy Teſtimony againſt theſe
alſo. Wherefore I know, that leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
thee all theſe wicked and erroneous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
and bearing witneſs to the Truth,
thou wilt at length joyn thy ſelf unto us;
and I rejoice over thee in this, that thou art
inlightned to know the Truth; Teſtifying
that I embrace thee with Affection in the
Lord.</p>
            <p>Friend <hi>Timothy</hi> Greeteth thee in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;

In a word, all Friends Greet, and ſpeak well
