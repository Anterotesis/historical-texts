            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THERE is an Inſtance of your Care and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which I conceive my ſelf at this time highly obliged to offer, and you to regard, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Preſervation of the very Foundations of our Faith. Some Perſons ſeduced, I fear, by the ſtrong Deluſions of Pride and Self-conceit, have lately publiſhed new Forms of Doxology, entirely agreeable to thoſe of ſome Ancient Hereticks, who impiouſly denied a Trinity of Perſons in the Unity of the Godhead. I do therefore warn, and charge it upon your Souls, as you hope to obtain Mercy from God the Father, through the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and by the Sanctification of the Holy Ghoſt, Three Perſons and One God Bleſſed for ever, that you imploy your beſt Endeavours to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with your ſeveral Flocks to have a great Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence for the above mentioned new Forms, and particularly that you do not ſuffer the ſame to be uſed, either in your Churches, or in any Schools where you are able to prevent that moſt pernicious Abuſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>ALTHO' I have not the Honour of being One of thoſe Incumbents in your Lordſhip's Dioceſe, to whom you immediately direct your late Letter againſt the Uſe of <hi>New Forms of Doxology,</hi> &amp;c. Yet becauſe I generally frequent one of your Pariſh Churches, where a <hi>New Form of Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> is every Day uſed; <note place="margin">

            <p>

I take it here for granted, My Lord, that your Lordſhip is in earneſt in this Letter; that by <hi>New Forms of Doxology</hi> therein diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approv'd, without any particular mention of the Forms themſelves, you truly mean ſuch as aroſe long ſince the beginning of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; That alſo by <hi>New Forms of Doxology, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely agreeable to thoſe of ſome ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> your Lordſhip particularly means thoſe <hi>New Forms</hi> which were introduc'd by certain Hereticks in the fourth Century; tho' your Lordſhip ſeems indeed unhappily to have miſtaken their Name and Character.</p>
            <p>I take it alſo for granted, My Lord, that 'tis impoſſible for a Chriſtian and a Proteſtant Biſhop, both which your Lordſhip is known to be, to call the ancient and ſacred Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>John,</hi> St. <hi>Jude,</hi> &amp;c. with thoſe of the reſt of the moſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, <hi>New Forms of Doxology, intirely agreeable to thoſe of ſome ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks:</hi> And upon this reaſonable Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I do again return your Lordſhip my moſt hearty Thanks for ſo ſeaſonable and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an a Caution againſt the modern groſs, and notorious Corruption of this kind.</p>
            <p>Now that this ſolemn Caution of your Lordſhip's againſt all <hi>New Forms of Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> may have the greater regard paid to it by all the Clergy of your Dioceſe, I ſhall beg leave to ſupply what ſeems wanting in your Lordſhip's Letter, and ſhall produce here all the certainly genuine <hi>Forms of Dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology,</hi> that, upon a former diligent Enquiry, I met with in the Apoſtolick Age, or a little later.

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0402604100:14"/>
               <hi>Note,</hi> (2) That <hi>Baſil</hi> has a full and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <note n="q" place="bottom">De Spiritu Sancto ad Amphilochium.</note> Diſcourſe upon this Subject; a ſhort Summary of which only, becauſe of its length, I ſhall here give the Reader; as highly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his ſerious Conſideration upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baſil</hi> then was accuſed by thoſe that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked the late Notions and Practices brought into the Church, that he had ventured to alter the old Chriſtian Doxology, as to the Particle <hi>in,</hi> which uſed to be given to the holy Ghoſt; and that he often made uſe of <hi>and,</hi> or <hi>with</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it; as if Glory, and Honour, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration, were to be not only aſcribed to the Father, and to the Son, <hi>in</hi> the holy Ghoſt, or by his Aſſiſtance, but alſo directly <hi>to</hi> the holy Ghoſt himſelf, as to a proper Object of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Adoration or Doxology. In anſwer to which he owns that the Form <hi>in</hi> the holy Ghoſt is indeed certainly the ancient and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Chriſtian Form of Doxology; and that he will ſometimes make uſe of it ſtill accordingly; that however the other Forms <hi>and</hi> or <hi>with,</hi> if they be not really genuine and original in Doxologies, which yet he would willingly inſinuate, they have however been uſed upon other Occaſions indifferently; that even in Doxologies he is not the firſt that has uſed thoſe Particles, concerning the Holy Ghoſt; but that ſeveral great Men had done the like before him; at leaſt ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the third Century, as he proves by particular Inſtances; and that he therefore looks upon it as a piece of <hi>Arian</hi> or Heretical Inclination to be ſo ſcrupulous of keeping to this one old Particle <hi>in,</hi> out of Oppoſition to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0402604100:15"/>
thoſe that would ſhew their Orthodoxy by the uſe of the other Particles, <hi>and</hi> or <hi>with</hi> the holy Ghoſt. This is the Purport of <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Caſe. And I own that if Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials muſt govern, and Chriſtians are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to make themſelves a new Object of direct Invocation or Doxology from remote Inferences of their own, and out of Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with a prevailing Party, <hi>Baſil</hi> may be in the right, as well as thoſe that follow him in theſe Matters. But if Divine Worſhip is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be given in ſuch a Manner, and to ſuch Objects, as Divine Inſtitution ordains, He and all the <hi>Athanaſians</hi> run a great Hazard in ſuch Matters, and muſt have a heavy Account to give of this their raſh and unjuſtifiable, and unchriſtian Procedure at the great Day. [Vid. <hi>Collection of Monuments, p.</hi> 124-126.]</p>
            <p>The former Doxologies, My Lord, and many of the latter alſo are for certain the Old, the Chriſtian, the Apoſtolical Doxologies; ſome Centuries before <hi>Arius</hi> or <hi>Arthanaſius</hi> were known in the World; by which Men gave Glory, and Praiſe <hi>to</hi> God the Father, the Fountain and Origin of all Beings what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; together <hi>with,</hi> or <hi>through</hi> the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt, his Only-begotten Son; and <hi>by</hi> the Aid and Aſſiſtance of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>And that your Lordſhip does fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of this ancient way of Worſhip and Doxology, is plain by your own excellent and remarkable Words to the very ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which indeed deſcribe exactly the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſtian Worſhip in the three firſt Centuries, <hi>I do warn and charge it upon your Souls,</hi> ſays your Lordſhip to your Clergy, <hi>as you hope to obtain Mercy from God the Father, through the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi>
