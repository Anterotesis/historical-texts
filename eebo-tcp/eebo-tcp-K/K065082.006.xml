            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>DURING a long and diſgraceful reign of of twenty-eight years, Honorius, emperor of the Weſt, was ſeparated from the friendſhip <note place="margin">Laſt years and death of Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, A. D. 423, Aug. 27.</note> of his brother, and afterwards of his nephew, who reigned over the Eaſt; and Conſtantinople beheld, with apparent indifference and ſecret joy, the calamities of Rome. The ſtrange adventures of Placidia <note n="1" place="bottom">See Chap. xxxi.</note> gradually renewed, and cemented, the alliance of the two empires. The daughter
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0034700106:11"/>
of the great Theodoſius had been the captive and the queen of the Goths: ſhe loſt an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate huſband; ſhe was dragged in chains by his inſulting aſſaſſin; ſhe taſted the pleaſure of revenge, and was exchanged, in the treaty of peace, for ſix hundred thouſand meaſures of wheat. After her return from Spain to Italy, Placidia experienced a new perſecution in the boſom of her family. She was averſe to a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which had been ſtipulated without her conſent; and the brave Conſtantius, as a noble reward for the tyrants whom he had vanquiſhed, received, from the hand of Honorius himſelf, the ſtruggling and reluctant hand of the widow of Adolphus. But her reſiſtance ended with the ceremony of the nuptials; nor did Placidia refuſe to become the mother of Honoria and Valentinian the third, or to aſſume and exerciſe an abſolute dominion over the mind of her grateful huſband. The generous ſoldier, whoſe time had hitherto been divided between ſocial pleaſure and military ſervice, was taught new leſſons of avarice and ambition: he extorted the title of Auguſtus; and the ſervant of Honorius was aſſociated to the empire of the Weſt. The death of Conſtantius, in the ſeventh month of his reign, inſtead of diminiſhing, ſeemed to increaſe, the power of Placidia; and the indecent familiarity <note n="2" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is the expreſſion of Olympiodorus (apud Photium, p. 197.); who means, perhaps, to deſcribe the ſame careſſes which Mahomet beſtowed on his <hi>daughter</hi> Phatemah. Quando (ſays the prophet himſelf), quando ſubit mihi deſiderium Paradiſi, oſculor cam, et ingero linguam meam in os ejus. But this ſenſual indulgence was juſtified by miracle and myſtery; and the anecdote has been communicated to the public by the Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maracci, in his Verſion and Confutation of the Koran, tom. i. p. 32.</note> of her
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0034700106:12"/>
brother, which might be no more than the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a childiſh affection, were univerſally attributed to inceſtuous love. On a ſudden, by ſome baſe intrigues of a ſteward and a nurſe, this exceſſive fondneſs was converted into an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable quarrel: the debates of the emperor and his ſiſter were not long confined within the walls of the palace; and as the Gothic ſoldiers adhered to their queen, the city of Ravenna was agitated with bloody and dangerous tumults, which could only be appeaſed by the forced or voluntary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of Placidia and her children. The royal exiles landed at Conſtantinople, ſoon after the marriage of Theodoſius, during the feſtival of the Perſian victories. They were treated with kindneſs and magnificence; but as the ſtatues of the emperor Conſtantius had been rejected by the Eaſtern court, the title of Auguſta could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently be allowed to his widow. Within a few months after the arrival of Placidia, a ſwift meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger announced the death of Honorius, the conſequence of a dropſy; but the important ſecret was not divulged, till the neceſſary orders had been diſpatched for the march of a large body of troops to the ſea-coaſt of Dalmatia. The ſhops and the gates of Conſtantinople remained ſhut during ſeven days; and the loſs of a foreign prince, who could neither be eſteemed nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0034700106:13"/>
was celebrated with loud and affected demonſtrations of the public grief.</p>
            <p>While the miniſters of Conſtantinople delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, <note place="margin">Elevation and fall of the uſurper John, A. D. 423—425.</note> the vacant throne of Honorius was uſurped by the ambition of a ſtranger. The name of the rebel was John: he filled the confidential office of <hi>Primicerius,</hi> or principal ſecretary; and hiſtory has attributed to his character more virtues, than can eaſily be reconciled with the violation of the moſt ſacred duty. Elated by the ſubmiſſion of Italy, and the hope of an alliance with the Huns, John preſumed to inſult, by an embaſſy, the majeſty of the Eaſtern emperor; but when he underſtood that his agents had been baniſhed, impriſoned, and at length chaced away with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ignominy, John prepared to aſſert, by arms, the injuſtice of his claims. In ſuch a cauſe, the grandſon of the great Theodoſius ſhould have marched in perſon: but the young emperor was eaſily diverted, by his phyſicians, from ſo raſh and hazardous a deſign; and the conduct of the Italian expedition was prudently entruſted to Ardaburius, and his ſon Aſpar, who had already ſignaliſed their valour againſt the Perſians. It was reſolved, that Ardaburius ſhould embark with the infantry; whilſt Aſpar, at the head of the cavalry, conducted Placidia, and her ſon Valentinian, along the ſea-coaſt of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driatic. The march of the cavalry was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch active diligence, that they ſurpriſed, without reſiſtance, the important city of Aquileia; when the hopes of Aſpar were unexpectedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0034700106:14"/>
by the intelligence, that a ſtorm had diſperſed the Imperial fleet; and that his father, with only two gallies, was taken and carried a priſoner into the port of Ravenna. Yet this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, unfortunate as it might ſeem, facilitated the conqueſt of Italy. Ardaburius employed, or abuſed, the courteous freedom, which he was permitted to enjoy, to revive among the troops a ſenſe of loyalty and gratitude; and, as ſoon as the conſpiracy was ripe for execution, he invited by private meſſages, and preſſed the approach of, Aſpar. A ſhepherd, whom the popular credulity transformed into an angel, guided the Eaſtern cavalry, by a ſecret, and, it was thought, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſable road, through the moraſſes of the Po: the gates of Ravenna, after a ſhort ſtruggle, were thrown open; and the defenceleſs tyrant was delivered to the mercy, or rather to the cruelty, of the conquerors.

In the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſeaſon of her exile and diſtreſs, Boniface alone had maintained her cauſe with unſhaken fidelity; and the troops and treaſures of Africa had eſſentially contributed to extinguiſh the rebellion. The ſame rebellion had been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the zeal and activity of Aetius, who brought an army of ſixty thouſand Huns from the Danube to the confines of Italy, for the ſervice of the uſurper.

The Vandals prevailed; and their adverſaries were beſieged in the Nervaſian hills, between Leon and Oviedo, till the approach of Count Aſterius compelled, or rather provoked, the victorious Barbarians to remove the ſcene of the war to the plains of Boetica. The rapid progreſs of the Vandals ſoon required a more effectual oppoſition; and the maſter-general Caſtinus marched againſt them with a numerous army of Romans and Goths. Vanquiſhed in battle by an inferior enemy, Caſtinus fled with diſhonour to Tarragona; and this memorable defeat, which has been repreſented as the puniſhment, was moſt probably the effect, of his raſh preſumption <note n="12" place="bottom">See the Chronicles of Proſper and Idatius.

In the room of a prince, not conſpicuous for any ſuperior powers of the mind or body, they acquired his baſtard brother, the terrible Genſeric <note n="13" place="bottom">Gizericus (his name is variouſly expreſſed) ſtaturâ mediocris et equi casû claudicans, animo profundus, ſermone rarus, luxuriae contemptor, irâ turbidus habendi, cupidus, ad ſolicitandas gentes providentiſſimus, ſemina contentionum jacere, odia miſcere paratus.

The king of the Vandals is deſcribed to have been of a middle ſtature, with a lameneſs in one leg, which he had contracted by an accidental fall from his horſe. His ſlow and cautious ſpeech ſeldom declared the deep purpoſes of his ſoul: he diſdained to imitate the luxury of the vanquiſhed; but he indulged the ſterner paſſions of anger and revenge.

Impatient of the inſult, Genſeric purſued the haſty retreat of the Suevi as far as Merida; precipitated the king and his army into the river Anas, and calmly returned to the ſea-ſhore, to embark his victorious troops.

to deſtroy the province entruſted to his command. The friends of Boniface, who ſtill believed that his criminal behaviour might be excuſed by ſome honourable motive, ſolicited, during the abſence of Aetius, a free conference with the Count of Africa; and Darius, an officer of high diſtinction, was named for the important embaſſy <note n="24" place="bottom">In a confidential letter to Count Boniface, St. Auguſtin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining the grounds of the quarrel, piouſly exhorts him to diſcharge the duties of a Chriſtian and a ſubject; to extricate himſelf without delay from his dangerous and guilty ſituation; and even, if he could obtain the conſent of his wife, to embrace a life of celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy and pennance (Tillemont, Mem.

In their firſt interview at Carthage, the imaginary provocations were mutually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained; the oppoſite letters of Aetius were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and compared; and the fraud was eaſily detected. Placidia and Boniface lamented their fatal error; and the Count had ſufficient magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity to confide in the forgiveneſs of his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, or to expoſe his head to her future reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His repentance was fervent and ſincere; but he ſoon diſcovered, that it was no longer in his power to reſtore the edifice which he had ſhaken to its foundations. Carthage, and the Roman garriſons, returned with their general to the allegiance of Valentinian; but the reſt of Africa was ſtill diſtracted with war and faction; and the inexorable king of the Vandals, diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all terms of accommodation, ſternly refuſed to relinquiſh the poſſeſſion of his prey. The band of veterans, who marched under the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0034700106:29"/>
of Boniface, and his haſty levies of provincial troops, were defeated with conſiderable loſs: the victorious Barbarians inſulted the open country; and Carthage, Cirta, and Hippo Regius, were the only cities that appeared to riſe above the general inundation.</p>
            <p>The long and narrow tract of the African coaſt <note place="margin">Deſolation of Africa.</note> was filled with frequent monuments of Roman art and magnificence; and the reſpective degrees of improvement might be accurately meaſured by the diſtance from Carthage and the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean. A ſimple reflection will impreſs every thinking mind with the cleareſt idea of fertility and cultivation: the country was extremely po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous; the inhabitants reſerved a liberal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence for their own uſe; and the annual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, particularly of wheat, was ſo regular and plentiful, that Africa deſerved the name of the common granary of Rome and of mankind. On a ſudden, the ſeven fruitful provinces, from Tangier to Tripoli, were overwhelmed by the invaſion of the Vandals; whoſe deſtructive rage has perhaps been exaggerated by popular ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, religious zeal, and extravagant declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. War, in its faireſt form, implies a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual violation of humanity and juſtice; and the hoſtilities of Barbarians are inflamed by the fierce and lawleſs ſpirit which inceſſantly diſturbs their peaceful and domeſtic ſociety. The Vandals, where they found reſiſtance, ſeldom gave quarter; and the deaths of their valiant countrymen were expiated by the ruin of the cities under whoſe walls they had fallen. Careleſs of the diſtinctions

of age, or ſex, or rank, they employed every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of indignity and torture, to force from the captives a diſcovery of their hidden wealth. The ſtern policy of Genſeric juſtified his frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of military execution: he was not always the maſter of his own paſſions, or of thoſe of his followers; and the calamities of war were aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by the licentiouſneſs of the Moors, and the fanaticiſm of the Donatiſts. Yet I ſhall not eaſily be perſuaded, that it was the common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Vandals to extirpate the olives, and other fruit-trees, of a country where they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſettle: nor can I believe that it was a uſual ſtratagem to ſlaughter great numbers of their priſoners before the walls of a beſieged city, for the ſole purpoſe of infecting the air, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a peſtilence, of which they themſelves muſt have been the firſt victims <note n="25" place="bottom">The original complaints of the deſolation of Africa are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, 1.

            <p>The generous mind of Count Boniface was <note place="margin">Siege of Hippo, A.

The old Hippo Regius was finally deſtroyed by the Arabs in the ſeventh century; but a new town, at the diſtance of two miles, was built with the materials; and it contained, in the ſixteenth century, about three hundred families of induſtrious, but turbulent, manufacturers.

            <p>By the ſkill of Boniface, and perhaps by the ignorance of the Vandals, the ſiege of Hippo <note place="margin">Death and retreat of Boniface, A.

The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and danger of Africa were deeply felt by the regent of the Weſt. Placidia implored the aſſiſtance of her eaſtern ally; and the Italian fleet and army were reinforced by Aſpar, who failed from Conſtantinople with a powerful arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As ſoon as the force of the two empires was united under the command of Boniface, he boldly marched againſt the Vandals; and the loſs of a ſecond battle irretrievably decided the fate of Africa. He embarked with the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of deſpair; and the people of Hippo were permitted, with their families and effects, to occupy the vacant place of the ſoldiers, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of whom were either ſlain or made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners by the Vandals.

Boniface accepted with gratitude the rank of patrician, and the dignity of maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general of the Roman armies; but he muſt have bluſhed at the ſight of thoſe medals, in which he was repreſented with the name and attributes of victory <note n="32" place="bottom">Ducange, Fam.

The diſcovery of his fraud, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the empreſs, and the diſtinguiſhed favour of his rival, exaſperated the haughty and perfidious ſoul of Aetius. He haſtily returned from Gaul to Italy, with a retinue, or rather with an army, of Barbarian followers; and ſuch was the weakneſs of the government, that the two generals decided their private quarrel in a bloody battle. Boniface was ſucceſsful; but he <note place="margin">His death, A.

The buildings of Carthage were uniform and magnificent: a ſhady grove was planted in the midſt of the capital; the <hi>new</hi> port, a ſecure and capacious harbour, was ſubſervient to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial induſtry of citizens and ſtrangers; and the ſplendid games of the circus and theatre were exhibited almoſt in the preſence of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians.

The habits of trade, and the abuſe of luxury, had corrupted their manners; but their impious contempt of monks, and the ſhameleſs practice of unnatural luſts, are the two abominations which excite the pious vehemence of Salvian, the preacher of the age <note n="40" place="bottom">He declares, that the peculiar vices of each country were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the ſink of Carthage (l. vii. p. 257.).

ignominious ſervitude. After he had permitted his licentious troops to ſatiate their rage and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, he inſtituted a more regular ſyſtem of rapine and oppreſſion. An edict was promulgated, which enjoined all perſons, without fraud or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, to deliver their gold, ſilver, jewels, and valuable furniture or apparel, to the royal officers; and the attempt to ſecrete any part of their patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, was inexorably puniſhed with death and torture, as an act of treaſon againſt the ſtate. The lands of the proconſular province, which formed the immediate diſtrict of Carthage, were accurately meaſured, and divided among the Barbarians; and the conqueror reſerved for his peculiar domain, the fertile territory of Byza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium, and the adjacent parts of Numidia and Getulia <note n="41" place="bottom">Compare Procopius, de Bell.

            <p>It was natural enough that Genſeric ſhould hate <note place="margin">African exiles and captives.</note> thoſe whom he had injured: the nobility and ſenators of Carthage were expoſed to his jealouſy and reſentment; and all thoſe who refuſed the ignominious terms, which their honour and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion forbade them to accept, were compelled by the Arian tyrant to embrace the condition of perpetual baniſhment.

Bibliothecâ Patrum, tom. xi. p. 856.), to the Greek acts of their martyrdom (apud Photium, p. 1400, 1401.), and to the Annals of the Patriarch Eutychius (tom. i. p. 391. 531. 532. 535. Verſ. Pocock.).</note>: whoſe imaginary date correſponds with the reign of the younger Theodoſius, and the conqueſt of Africa by the Vandals <note n="44" place="bottom">Two Syriac writers, as they are quoted by Aſſemanni (Bibliot. Oriental. tom. i. p. 336. 338.), place the reſurrection of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Sleepers in the years 736 (A. D. 425.), or 748 (A. D. 437.), of the aera of the Seleucides. Their Greek acts, which Photius had read, aſſign the date of the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius, which may coincide either with A. D. 439, or 446. The period which had elapſed ſince the perſecution of Decius is eaſily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained; and nothing leſs than the ignorance of Mahomet, or the legendaries, could ſuppoſe an interval of three or four hundred years.</note>. When the emperor Decius perſecuted the Chriſtians, ſeven noble youths of

Epheſus concealed themſelves in a ſpacious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in the ſide of an adjacent mountain; where they were doomed to periſh by the tyrant, who gave orders that the entrance ſhould be firmly ſecured with a pile of huge ſtones. They imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fell into a deep ſlumber, which was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly prolonged, without injuring the powers of life, during a period of one hundred and eighty-ſeven years. At the end of that time, the ſlaves of Adolius, to whom the inheritance of the mountain had deſcended, removed the ſtones, to ſupply materials for ſome ruſtic edifice: the light of the ſun darted into the cavern; and the ſeven ſleepers were permitted to awake. After a ſlumber, as they thought, of a few hours, they were preſſed by the calls of hunger; and reſolved that Jamblichus, one of their number, ſhould ſecretly return to the city, to purchaſe bread for the uſe of his companions. The youth (if we may ſtill employ that appellation) could no longer recogniſe the once familiar aſpect of his native country; and his ſurpriſe was increaſed by the appearance of a large croſs, triumphantly erected over the principal gate of Epheſus. His ſingular dreſs, and obſolete language, confounded the baker, to whom he offered an ancient medal of Decius as the current coin of the empire; and Jamblichus, on the ſuſpicion of a ſecret trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, was dragged before the judge. Their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual enquiries produced the amazing diſcovery, that two centuries were almoſt elapſed ſince Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blichus, and his friends, had eſcaped from the rage of a Pagan tyrant.

The origin of this marvellous fable cannot be aſcribed to the pious fraud and credulity of the <hi>modern</hi> Greeks, ſince the authentic tradition may be traced within half a century of the ſuppoſed miracle. James of Sarug, a Syrian biſhop, who was born only two years after the death of the younger Theodoſius, has devoted one of his two hundred and thirty homilies to the praiſe of the young men of Epheſus <note n="45" place="bottom">James, one of the orthodox fathers of the Syrian church, was born A. D. 452.; he began to compoſe his ſermons A. D. 474.: he was made biſhop of Batnae, in the diſtrict of Sarug, and province of Meſopotamia, A. D. 519, and died, A. D. 521. (Aſſemanni, tom. i. p. 288, 289.). For the homily <hi>de Pueris Epheſinis,</hi> ſee p. 335—339.: though I could wiſh that Aſſemanni had tranſlated the text of James of Sarug, inſtead of anſwering the objections of Baronius.</note>. Their legend, before the end of the ſixth century, was tranſlated from the Syriac, into the Latin, language, by the care of Gregory of Tours. The hoſtile communions of the Eaſt preſerve their memory with equal reverence; and their names are honourably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Roman, the Habyſſinian, and the Ruſſian calendar <note n="46" place="bottom">See the <hi>Acta Sanctorum</hi> of the Bollandiſts (Menſis Julii, tom. vi. p. 375—397.). This immenſe calendar of ſaints, in one hundred and twenty-ſix years (1644—1770.), and in fifty volumes in folio, has advanced no farther than the 7th day of October. The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Jeſuits has moſt probably checked an undertaking, which, through the medium of fable and ſuperſtition, communicates much hiſtorical and philoſophical inſtruction.</note>. Nor has their reputation been confined to the Chriſtian world. This po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular

Sura xviii. tom. ii. p. 420—427. and tom. i. part iv. p. 103. With ſuch an ample privilege, Mahomet has not ſhewn much taſte or ingenuity. He has invented the dog (Al Rakim) of the Seven Sleepers; the reſpect of the ſun, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his courſe twice a day, that he might ſhine into the cavern; and the care of God himſelf, who preſerved their bodies from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, by turning them to the right and left.</note>.

Their dreſs declared them to be Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; and the deacon conjectures, that they were reſerved by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence as the future apoſtles of thoſe unbelieving countries.</note>. This eaſy and univerſal belief, ſo expreſſive of the ſenſe of mankind, may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to the genuine merit of the fable itſelf. We imperceptibly advance from youth to age, without obſerving the gradual, but inceſſant, change of human affairs; and even in our larger experience of hiſtory, the imagination is accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed, by a perpetual ſeries of cauſes and effects, to unite the moſt diſtant revolutions.

The throne of the perſecuting Decius was filled by a ſucceſſion of Chriſtian and orthodox princes, who had extirpated the fabulous gods of antiquity: and the public devotion of the age was impatient to exalt the ſaints and martyrs of the Catholic church, on the altars of Diana and Hercules. The union of the Roman empire was diſſolved: its genius was humbled in the duſt; and armies of unknown Barbarians, iſſuing from the frozen regions of the North, had eſtabliſhed their vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious reign over the faireſt provinces of Europe and Africa.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE weſtern world was oppreſſed by the Goths and Vandals, who fled before the Huns; but the atchievements of the Huns them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <note place="margin">The Huns, A. D. 376—433.</note> were not adequate to their power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity. Their victorious hords had ſpread from the Volga to the Danube; but the public force was exhauſted by the diſcord of independent chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; their valour was idly conſumed in obſcure and predatory excurſions; and they often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded their national dignity by condeſcending, for the hopes of ſpoil, to enliſt under the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their fugitive enemies. In the reign of ATTILA <note n="1" place="margin">The authentic materials for the hiſtory of Attila may be found in Jornandes (de Rebus Geticis, c. 34—50. p. 660—688. edit. Grot.) and Priſcus (Excerpta de Legationibus, p. 33—76. Paris, 1648.). I have not ſeen the lives of Attila, compoſed by Juvencus Caelius Calanus Dalmatinus, in the twelfth century, or by Nicholas Olahus, archbiſhop of Gran, in the ſixteenth. See Maſcou's Hiſtory of the Germans, ix. 23. and Maffei Oſſervazioni Litteraric, tom. i. p. 88, 89. Whatever the modern Hungarians have added, muſt be ſabulous; and they do not ſeem to have excelled in the art of fiction. They ſuppoſe, that when Attila invaded Gaul and Italy, married innumerable wives, &amp;c. he was one hundred and twenty years of age. Thwrocz Chron. p. i. c. 22. in Script. Hungar. tom. i. p. 76.</note>, the Huns again became the terror of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0034700106:47"/>
the world; and I ſhall now deſcribe the character and actions of that formidable Barbarian; who alternately inſulted and invaded the Eaſt and the Weſt, and urged the rapid downfal of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man empire.</p>
            <p>In the tide of emigration, which impetuouſly <note place="margin">Their eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in modern Hungary.</note> rolled from the confines of China to thoſe of Germany, the moſt powerful and populous tribes may commonly be found on the verge of the Roman provinces. The accumulated weight was ſuſtained for a while by artificial barriers; and the eaſy condeſcenſion of the emperors invited, without ſatisfying, the inſolent demands of the Barbarians, who had acquired an eager appetite for the luxuries of civilized life. The Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who ambitiouſly inſert the name of Attila among their native kings, may affirm with truth, that the hords, which were ſubject to his uncle Roas, or Rugilas, had formed their encampments within the limits of modern Hungary <note n="2" place="margin">Hungary has been ſucceſſively occupied by three Scythian colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. 1. The Huns of Attila; 2. the Abares, in the ſixth century; and, 3. the Turks, or Magiars, A. D. 889.; the immediate and genuine anceſtors of the modern Hungarians, whoſe connection with the two former is extremely faint and remote. The <hi>Prodromus</hi> and <hi>Notitia</hi> of Matthew Belius, appear to contain a rich fund of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning ancient and modern Hungary. I have ſeen the extracts in Bibliotheque Ancienne et Moderne, tom. xxii. p. 1—51. and Bibliotheque Raiſonnée, tom. xvi. p. 127—175.</note>, in a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile country, which liberally ſupplied the wants of a nation of hunters and ſhepherds. In this advantageous ſituation, Rugilas, and his valiant brothers, who continually added to their power and reputation, commanded the alternative of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0034700106:48"/>
peace or war with the two empires. His alliance with the Romans of the Weſt was cemented by his perſonal friendſhip for the great Aetius; who was always ſecure of finding, in the Barbarian camp, a hoſpitable reception, and a powerful ſupport. At his ſolicitation, and in the name of John the uſurper, ſixty thouſand Huns advanced to the confines of Italy; their march and their retreat were alike expenſive to the ſtate; and the grateful policy of Aetius abandoned the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Pannonia to his faithful confederates. The Romans of the Eaſt were not leſs apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the arms of Rugilas, which threatened the provinces, or even the capital. Some eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical hiſtorians have deſtroyed the Barbarians with lightning and peſtilence <note n="3" place="margin">Socrates, l. vii. c. 43. Theodoret, l. v. c. 36. Tillemont, who always depends on the faith of his eccleſiaſtical authors, ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly contends (Hiſt. des Emp. tom. vi. p. 136. 607.), that the wars and perſonages were not the ſame.</note>; but Theodoſius was reduced to the more humble expedient of ſtipulating an annual payment of three hundred and fifty pounds of gold, and of diſguiſing this diſhonourable tribute by the title of general, which the king of the Huns condeſcended to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. The public tranquillity was frequently interrupted by the fierce impatience of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, and the perfidious intrigues of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zantine court. Four dependent nations, among whom we may diſtinguiſh the Bavarians, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the ſovereignty of the Huns; and their revolt was encouraged and protected by a Roman alliance; till the juſt claims, and formidable
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0034700106:49"/>
power, of Rugilas, were effectually urged by the voice of Eſlaw his ambaſſador. Peace was the unanimous wiſh of the ſenate: their decree was ratified by the emperor; and two ambaſſadors were named, Plinthas, a general of Scythian extraction, but of conſular rank; and the quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor Epigenes, a wiſe and experienced ſtateſman, who was recommended to that office by his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious colleague.</p>
            <p>The death of Rugilas ſuſpended the progreſs <note place="margin">Reign of Attila, A. D. 433—453.</note> of the treaty. His two nephews, Attila and Bleda, who ſucceeded to the throne of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, conſented to a perſonal interview with the ambaſſadors of Conſtantinople; but as they proudly refuſed to diſmount, the buſineſs was tranſacted on horſeback, in a ſpacious plain near the city of Margus, in the Upper Maeſia. The kings of the Huns aſſumed the ſolid benefits, as well as the vain honours, of the negociation. They dictated the conditions of peace, and each condition was an inſult on the majeſty of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Beſides the freedom of a ſafe and plentiful market on the banks of the Danube, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that the annual contribution ſhould be augmented from three hundred and fifty, to ſeven hundred, pounds of gold; that a fine, or ranſom, of eight pieces of gold, ſhould be paid for every Roman captive, who had eſcaped from his Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian maſter; that the emperor ſhould renounce all treaties and engagements with the enemies of the Huns; and that all the fugitives, who had taken refuge in the court, or provinces, of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dofius,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0034700106:50"/>
ſhould be delivered to the juſtice of their offended ſovereign. This juſtice was rigorouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on ſome unfortunate youths of a royal race. They were crucified on the territories of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, by the command of Attila: and, as ſoon as the king of the Huns had impreſſed the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans with the terror of his name, he indulged them in a ſhort and arbitrary reſpite, whilſt he ſubdued the rebellious or independent nations of Scythia and Germany <note n="4" place="bottom">See Priſcus, p. 47, 48. and Hiſt. des Peuples de l'Europe, tom. vii. c. xii, xiii, xiv, xv.</note>.</p>

His features, according to the obſervation of a Gothic hiſtorian, bore the ſtamp of his national origin; and the portrait of Attila exhibits the genuine deformity of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Calmuck <note n="6" place="bottom">Compare Jornandes (c. 35. p. 661.) with Buffon, Hiſt.

The character and portrait of Attila are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably tranſcribed from Caſſiodorius.</note>; a large head, a ſwarthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, ſmall deep-ſeated eyes, a flat noſe, a few hairs in the place of a beard, broad ſhoulders, and a ſhort ſquare body, of nervous ſtrength, though of a diſproportioned form. The haughty ſtep and demeanor of the king of the Huns ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the conſciouſneſs of his ſuperiority above the reſt of mankind; and he had a cuſtom of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0034700106:51"/>
fiercely rolling his eyes, as if he wiſhed to enjoy the terror which he inſpired. Yet this ſavage hero was not inacceſſible to pity: his ſuppliant enemies might confide in the aſſurance of peace or pardon; and Attila was conſidered by his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as a juſt and indulgent maſter. He delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in war; but, after he had aſcended the throne in a mature age, his head, rather than his hand, atchieved the conqueſt of the North; and the fame of an adventurous ſoldier was uſefully exchanged for that of a prudent and ſucceſsful general. The effects of perſonal valour are ſo incoſiderable, except in poetry or romance, that victory, even among Barbarians, muſt depend on the degree of ſkill, with which the paſſions of the multitude are combined and guided for the ſervice of a ſingle man. The Scythian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, Attila and Zingis, ſurpaſſed their rude countrymen in art, rather than in courage; and it may be obſerved, that the monarchies, both of the Huns, and of the Moguls, were erected by their founders on the baſis of popular ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The miraculous conception, which fraud and credulity aſcribed to the virgin-mother of Zingis, raiſed him above the level of human nature; and the naked prophet, who, in the name of the Deity, inveſted him with the empire of the earth, pointed the valour of the Moguls with irreſiſtible enthuſiaſm <note n="7" place="bottom">Abulpharag.

The religious arts of

Attila were not leſs ſkilfully adapted to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his age and country. It was natural enough, that the Scythians ſhould adore, with peculiar devotion, the god of war; but as they were incapable of forming either an abſtract idea, or a corporeal repreſentation, they worſhipped their tutelar deity under the ſymbol of an iron cimeter <note n="8" place="bottom">Nec templum apud eos viſitur, aut delubrum, ne tugurium qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem culmo tectum cerni uſquam poteſt; ſed <hi>gladius</hi> Barbarico ritû humi figitur nudus, eumque ut Martem regionum quas circumcircant praeſulem verecundius colunt.

That magnanimous, or rather that artful, prince accepted, with pious grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, this celeſtial favour; and, as the rightful poſſeſſor of the <hi>ſword of Mars,</hi> aſſerted his divine and indefeaſible claim to the dominion of the earth <note n="9" place="bottom">Priſcus relates this remarkable ſtory, both in his own text (p. 65.), and in the quotation made by Jornandes (c. 35. p. 662.). He might have explained the tradition, or fable, which characteriſed this famous ſword, and the name, as well as attributes, of the Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian deity, whom he has tranſlated into the Mars of the Greeks and Romans.</note>. If the rites of Scythia were practiſed on this ſolemn occaſion, a lofty altar, or rather pile of faggots, three hundred yards in length and in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0034700106:53"/>

Whether human ſacrifices formed any part of the worſhip of Attila, or whether he propitiated the god of war with the victims which he continually offered in the field of battle, the favourite of Mars ſoon acquired a ſacred character, which rendered his conqueſts more eaſy, and more permanent; and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian princes confeſſed, in the language of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion or flattery, that they could not preſume to gaze, with a ſteady eye, on the divine majeſty of the king of the Huns <note n="11" place="bottom">Priſcus, p. 55.

Towards the Eaſt, it is difficult to circumſcribe the dominion of Attila over the Scythian deſerts; yet we may be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he reigned on the banks of the Volga; that the king of the Huns was dreaded, not only as a warrior, but as a magician <note n="14" place="bottom">See Hiſt. des Huns, tom. ii. p. 296.

In the proud review of the nations who acknowledged the ſovereignty of Attila, and who never entertained, during his lifetime, the thought of a revolt, the Gepidae and the Oſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goths were diſtinguiſhed by their numbers, their bravery, and the perſonal merit of their chiefs. The renowned Ardaric, king of the Gepidae, was the faithful and ſagacious counſellor of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; who eſteemed his intrepid genius, whilſt he loved the mild and diſcreet virtues of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Walamir, king of the Oſtrogoths.

They watched his nod; they trembled at his frown; and, at the firſt ſignal of his will,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0034700106:56"/>
they executed, without murmur or heſitation, his ſtern and abſolute commands. In time of peace, the dependent princes, with their national troops, attended the royal camp in regular ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; but when Attila collected his military force, he was able to bring into the field an army of five, or, according to another account, of ſeven hundred thouſand Barbarians <note n="15" place="bottom">Jornandes, c. 35. p. 661. c. 37. p. 667.

They advanced, by a ſecret path, along the ſhores of the Caſpian ſea; traverſed the ſnowy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Armenia; paſſed the Tigris, the Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and the Halys; recruited their weary cavalry with the generous breed of Cappadocian horſes; occupied the hilly country of Cilicia, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed the feſtal ſongs, and dances, of the citizens of Antioch. Egypt trembled at their approach; and the monks and pilgrims of the Holy Land prepared to eſcape their fury by a ſpeedy embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The memory of this invaſion was ſtill recent in the minds of the Orientals. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Attila might execute, with ſuperior forces, the deſign which theſe adventurers had ſo boldly attempted; and it ſoon became the ſubject of anxious conjecture, whether the tempeſt would fall on the dominions of Rome, or of Perſia. Some of the great vaſſals of the king of the Huns, who were themſelves in the rank of powerful princes, had been ſent to ratify an alliance and ſociety of arms with the emperor, or rather with the general, of the Weſt. They related, during their reſidence at Rome, the circumſtances of an expedition, which they had lately made into the Eaſt. After paſſing a deſert and a moraſs, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Romans to be the lake Moeotis, they penetrated through the mountains, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, at the end of fifteen days march, on the confines of Media; where they advanced as far as the unknown cities of Baſic and Curſic. They encountered the Perſian army in the plains of Media; and the air, according to their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0034700106:58"/>
was darkened by a cloud of arrows. But the Huns were obliged to retire, before the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the enemy. Their laborious retreat was effected by a different road; they loſt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of their booty; and at length returned to the royal camp, with ſome knowledge of the country, and an impatient deſire of revenge. In the free converſation of the Imperial ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, who diſcuſſed, at the court of Attila, the character and deſigns of their formidable enemy, the miniſters of Conſtantinople expreſſed their hope, that his ſtrength might be diverted and employed in a long and doubtful conteſt with the princes of the houſe of Saſſan. The more ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Italians admoniſhed their Eaſtern brethren of the folly and danger of ſuch a hope; and convinced them, <hi>that</hi> the Medes and Perſians were incapable of reſiſting the arms of the Huns; and, <hi>that</hi> the eaſy and important acquiſition would exalt the pride, as well as power, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. Inſtead of contenting himſelf with a moderate contribution, and a military title, which equalled him only to the generals of Theodoſius, Attila would proceed to impoſe a diſgraceful and intolerable yoke on the necks of the proſtrate and captive Romans, who would then be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed, on all ſides, by the empire of the Huns <note n="17" place="bottom">See the original converſation in Priſcus, p. 64, 65.</note>.</p>

An enterpriſe had been concerted between the courts of Ravenna and Conſtantinople, for the recovery of that valuable province; and the ports of Sicily were already filled with the military and naval forces of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius. But the ſubtle Genſeric, who ſpread his negociations round the world, prevented their deſigns, by exciting the king of the Huns to invade the Eaſtern empire; and a trifling inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſoon became the motive, or pretence, of a deſtructive war <note n="18" place="bottom">Priſcus, p. 331. His hiſtory contained a copious and elegant account of the war (Evagrius, l. i. c. 17.); but the extracts which relate to the embaſſies are the only parts that have reached our times.

Under the faith of the treaty of Margus, a free market was held on the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſide of the Danube, which was protected by a Roman fortreſs, ſurnamed Conſtantia. A troop of Barbarians violated the commercial ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity: killed, or diſperſed, the unſuſpecting traders; and levelled the fortreſs with the ground. The Huns juſtified this outrage as an act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal; alleged, that the biſhop of Margus had entered their territories, to diſcover and ſteal a ſecret treaſure of their kings; and ſternly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the guilty prelate, the ſacrilegious ſpoil, and the fugitive ſubjects, who had eſcaped from the juſtice of Attila. The refuſal of the Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine

court was the ſignal of war; and the Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians at firſt applauded the generous firmneſs of their ſovereign. But they were ſoon intimidated by the deſtruction of Viminiacum and the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent towns; and the people was perſuaded to adopt the convenient maxim, that a private citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, however innocent or reſpectable, may be juſtly ſacrificed to the ſafety of his country. The biſhop of Margus, who did not poſſeſs the ſpirit of a martyr, reſolved to prevent the deſigns which he ſuſpected. He boldly treated with the princes of the Huns; ſecured, by ſolemn oaths, his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and reward; poſted a numerous detachment of Barbarians, in ſilent ambuſh, on the banks of the Danube; and, at the appointed hour, opened, with his own hand, the gates of his epiſcopal city. This advantage, which had been obtained by treachery, ſerved as a prelude to more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and deciſive victories. The Illyrian frontier was covered by a line of caſtles and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes; and though the greateſt part of them conſiſted only of a ſingle tower, with a ſmall gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, they were commonly ſufficient to repel, or to intercept, the inroads of an enemy, who was ignorant of the art, and impatient of the delay, of a regular ſiege. But theſe ſlight obſtacles were inſtantly ſwept away by the inundation of the Huns <note n="19" place="bottom">Procopius, de Edificiis, l. iv. c. 5. Theſe fortreſſes were afterwards reſtored, ſtrengthened, and enlarged by the emperor Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian; but they were ſoon deſtroyed by the Abares, who ſucceeded to the power and poſſeſſions of the Huns.</note>.

of Ratiaria and Marcianapolis, of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſus and Sardica; where every circumſtance, in the diſcipline of the people, and the conſtruction of the buildings, had been gradually adapted to the ſole purpoſe of defence.

The public danger and diſtreſs could not, however, provoke Theodoſius to interrupt his amuſements and devotion, or to appear in perſon at the head of the Roman legions. But the troops, which had been ſent againſt Genſeric, were haſtily recalled from Sicily; the garriſons, on the ſide of Perſia, were exhauſted; and a military force was collected in Europe, formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by their arms and numbers, if the generals had underſtood the ſcience of command, and their ſoldiers the duty of obedience. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Eaſtern empire were vanquiſhed in three ſucceſſive engagements; and the progreſs of Attila may be traced by the fields of battle. The two former, on the banks of the Utus, and under the walls of Marcianapolis, were fought in the extenſive plains between the Danube and Mount Haemus. As the Romans were preſſed by a victorious enemy, they gradually, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilfully, retired towards the Cherſoneſus of Thrace; and that narrow peninſula, the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the land, was marked by their third, and irreparable, defeat. By the deſtruction of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0034700106:62"/>
this army, Attila acquired the indiſputable poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the field. From the Helleſpont to Thermopylae, and the ſuburbs of Conſtantinople, he ravaged, without reſiſtance, and without mercy, the provinces of Thrace and Macedonia. Heraclea and Hadrianople might, perhaps, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape this dreadful irruption of the Huns; but the words, the moſt expreſſive of total extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eraſure, are applied to the calamities which they inflicted on ſeventy cities of the Eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern empire <note n="20" place="bottom">Septuaginta civitates (ſays Proſper-Tyro) depraedatione vaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae.

Theodoſius, his court, and the unwarlike people, were protected by the walls of Conſtantinople; but thoſe walls had been ſhaken by a recent earthquake, and the fall of fifty-eight towers had opened a large and tremendous breach.

But theſe conſiderations of hope and fear are almoſt unknown in the paſtoral ſtate of nations. The Huns of Attila may, without injuſtice, be compared to the Moguls and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, before their primitive manners were changed by religion and luxury; and the evidence of Oriental hiſtory may reflect ſome light on the ſhort and imperfect annals of Rome. After the Moguls had ſubdued the northern provinces of China, it was ſeriouſly propoſed, not in the hour of victory and paſſion, but in calm deliberate council, to exterminate all the inhabitants of that populous country, that the vacant land might be converted to the paſture of cattle. The firmneſs of a Chineſe mandarin <note n="22" place="bottom">He repreſented, to the emperor of the Moguls, that the four provinces (Petcheli, Chantong, Chanſi, and Leaotong) which he already poſſeſſed, might annually produce, under a mild adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 500,000 ounces of ſilver, 400,000 meaſures of rice, and 800,000 pieces of ſilk.

But in the cities of Aſia, which yielded to the Moguls, the inhuman abuſe of the rights of war was exerciſed, with a regular
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0034700106:64"/>
form of diſcipline, which may, with equal reaſon, though not with equal authority, be imputed to the victorious Huns. The inhabitants, who had ſubmitted to their diſcretion, were ordered to evacuate their houſes, and to aſſemble in ſome plain adjacent to the city; where a diviſion was made of the vanquiſhed into three parts. The firſt claſs conſiſted of the ſoldiers of the garriſon, and of the young men capable of bearing arms; and their fate was inſtantly decided: they were either inliſted among the Moguls, or they were maſſacred on the ſpot by the troops, who, with pointed ſpears and bended bows, had formed a circle round the captive multitude. The ſecond claſs, compoſed of the young and beautiful wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of the artificers of every rank and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and of the more wealthy or honourable citizens, from whom a private ranſom might be expected, was diſtributed in equal or proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lots. The remainder, whoſe life or death was alike uſeleſs to the conquerors, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to return to the city; which, in the mean while, had been ſtripped of its valuable furniture; and a tax was impoſed on thoſe wretched inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants for the indulgence of breathing their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive air.

The three great capitals of Khoraſan, Maru, Neiſabour, and Herat, were deſtroyed by the armies of Zingis; and the exact account, which was taken of the ſlain, amounted to four millions three hundred and forty-ſeven thouſand perſons <note n="24" place="bottom">At Maru, 1,300,000; at Herat, 1,600,000; at Neiſabour, 1,747,000.

The eſtimate of their reſpective value was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſimple judgment of unenlightened, and unprejudiced, Barbarians.

But they diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the language, and the ſciences, of the Greeks; and the vain ſophiſt, or grave philoſopher, who had enjoyed the flattering applauſe of the ſchools, was mortified to find, that his robuſt ſervant was a captive of more value and importance than himſelf.

But the merit of the phyſician was received with univerſal favour and reſpect; the Barbarians, who deſpiſed death, might be apprehenſive of diſeaſe; and the haughty conqueror trembled in the preſence of a captive, to whom he aſcribed, perhaps, an imaginary power, of prolonging, or

The ſpoils of war had reſtored and improved his private property; he was admitted to the table of his former lord; and the apoſtate Greek bleſſed the hour of his captivity, ſince it had been the introduction to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0034700106:69"/>
an happy and independent ſtate; which he held by the honourable tenure of military ſervice. This reflection naturally produced a diſpute on the advantages, and defects, of the Roman go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which was ſeverely arraigned by the apoſtate, and defended by Priſcus in a prolix and feeble declamation. The freedman of Onegeſius expoſed, in true and lively colours, the vices of a declining empire, of which he had ſo long been the victim; the cruel abſurdity of the Roman princes, unable to protect their ſubjects againſt the public enemy, unwilling to truſt them with arms for their own defence; the intolerable weight of taxes, rendered ſtill more oppreſſive by the intricate or arbitrary modes of collection; the obſcurity of numerous and contradictory laws; the tedious and expenſive forms of judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; the partial adminiſtration of juſtice; and the univerſal corruption, which increaſed the influence of the rich, and aggravated the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of the poor. A ſentiment of patriotic ſympathy was at length revived in the breaſt of the fortunate exile; and he lamented, with a flood of tears, the guilt or weakneſs of thoſe magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, who had perverted the wiſeſt and moſt ſalutary inſtitutions <note n="32" place="bottom">See the whole converſation in Priſcus, p. 59—62.</note>.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0034700106:70"/>
diſcipline, or virtue, were not ſupplied by the perſonal character of the monarch. Theodoſius might ſtill affect the ſtyle, as well as the title, of <hi>Invincible Auguſtus;</hi> but he was reduced to ſolicit the clemency of Attila, who imperiouſly dictated theſe harſh and humiliating conditions of peace. I. The emperor of the Eaſt reſigned, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs or tacit convention, an extenſive and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant territory, which ſtretched along the ſouthern banks of the Danube, from Singidunum or Belgrade, as far as Novae, in the dioceſe of Thrace. The breadth was defined by the vague computation of fifteen days journey; but, from the propoſal of Attila, to remove the ſituation of the national market, it ſoon appeared, that he comprehended the ruined city of Naiſſus within the limits of his dominions. II. The king of the Huns required, and obtained, that his tribute or ſubſidy ſhould be augmented from ſeven hundred pounds of gold to the annual ſum of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand one hundred; and he ſtipulated the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate payment of ſix thouſand pounds of gold to defray the expences, or to expiate the guilt, of the war. One might imagine, that ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which ſcarcely equalled the meaſure of private wealth, would have been readily diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the opulent empire of the Eaſt; and the public diſtreſs affords a remarkable proof of the impoveriſhed, or at leaſt of the diſorderly, ſtate of the finances. A large proportion of the taxes, extorted from the people, was detained and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted in their paſſage, through the fouleſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0034700106:71"/>
channels, to the treaſury of Conſtantinople. The revenue was diſſipated by Theodoſius, and his favourites, in waſteful and profuſe luxury; which was diſguiſed by the names of Imperial magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, or Chriſtian charity. The immediate ſupplies had been exhauſted by the unforeſeen neceſſity of military preparations. A perſonal contribution, rigorouſly, but capriciouſly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on the members of the ſenatorian order, was the only expedient that could diſarm, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſs of time, the impatient avarice of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tila: and the poverty of the nobles compelled them to adopt the ſcandalous reſource of expoſing to public auction the jewels of their wives, and the hereditary ornaments of their palaces <note n="34" place="bottom">According to the deſcription, or rather invective, of Chryſoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, an auction of Byzantine luxury muſt have been very produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.

III. The king of the Huns appears to have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, as a principle of national juriſprudence, that he could never loſe the property, which he had once acquired, in the perſons, who had yielded either a voluntary, or reluctant, ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his authority. From this principle he concluded, and the concluſions of Attila were irrevocable laws, that the Huns, who had been taken priſoners in war, ſhould be releaſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, and without ranſom; that every Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man captive, who had preſumed to eſcape, ſhould purchaſe his right to freedom at the price of twelve pieces of gold; and that all the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0034700106:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who had deſerted the ſtandard of Attila, ſhould be reſtored, without any promiſe, or ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, of pardon. In the execution of this cruel and ignominious treaty, the Imperial offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were forced to maſſacre ſeveral loyal and noble deſerters, who refuſed to devote themſelves to certain death; and the Romans forfeited all reaſonable claims to the friendſhip of any Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian people, by this public confeſſion, that they were deſtitute either of faith, or power, to protect the ſuppliants, who had embraced the throne of Theodoſius <note n="35" place="bottom">The articles of the treaty, expreſſed without much order or preciſion, may be found in Priſcus (p. 34, 35, 36, 37. 53, &amp;c.).

Azimus, or Azimuntium, a ſmall city of Thrace on the Illyrian borders <note n="36" place="bottom">Priſcus, p. 35, 36. Among the hundred and eighty-two forts, or caſtles, of Thrace, enumerated by Procopius (de Edificiis, l. iv. c. xi. tom. ii. p. 92. edit. Paris), there is one of the name of <hi>Eſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montou,</hi> whoſe poſition is doubtfully marked, in the neighbourhood of Anchialus, and the Euxine Sea. The name and walls of Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muntium might ſubſiſt till the reign of Juſtinian; but the race of its brave defenders had been carefully extirpated by the jealouſy of the Roman princes.</note>, had been diſtinguiſhed by the martial ſpirit of its youth, the ſkill and reputation of the leaders whom they had choſen, and their daring exploits againſt the innumerable hoſt of the Barbarians. Inſtead of tamely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0034700106:73"/>
their approach, the Azimuntines attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in frequent and ſucceſsful ſallies, the troops of the Huns, who gradually declined the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous neighbourhood; reſcued from their hands the ſpoil and the captives, and recruited their domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic force by the voluntary aſſociation of fugitives and deſerters. After the concluſion of the treaty, Attila ſtill menaced the empire with implacable war, unleſs the Azimuntines were perſuaded, or compelled, to comply with the conditions which their ſovereign had accepted. The miniſters of Theodoſius confeſſed with ſhame, and with truth, that they no longer poſſeſſed any authority over a ſociety of men, who ſo bravely aſſerted their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural independence; and the king of the Huns condeſcended to negociate an equal exchange with the citizens of Azimus. They demanded the reſtitution of ſome ſhepherds, who, with their cattle, had been accidentally ſurpriſed. A ſtrict, though fruitleſs inquiry, was allowed: but the Huns were obliged to ſwear, that they did not detain any priſoners belonging to the city, before they could recover two ſurviving countrymen, whom the Azimuntines had reſerved as pledges for the ſafety of their loſt companions. Attila, on his ſide, was ſatisfied, and deceived, by their ſolemn aſſeveration, that the reſt of the captives had been put to the ſword; and that it was their conſtant practice, immediately to diſmiſs the Romans and the deſerters, who had obtained the ſecurity of the public faith. This prudent and officious diſſimulation may be condemned, or excuſed, by the caſuiſts, as they incline to the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0034700106:74"/>
rigid decree of St. Auguſtin, or to the milder ſentiment of St. Jerom and St. Chryſoſtom: but every ſoldier, every ſtateſman, muſt acknowledge, that, if the race of the Azimuntines had been encouraged and multiplied, the Barbarians would have ceaſed to trample on the majeſty of the empire <note n="37" place="bottom">The peeviſh diſpute of St. Jerom and St. Auguſtin, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured; by different expedients, to reconcile the <hi>ſeeming</hi> quarrel of the two apoſtles St. Peter and St. Paul, depends on the ſolution of an important queſtion (Middleton's Works, vol. ii. p. 5—10.), which has been frequently agitated by Catholic and Proteſtant divines, and even by lawyers and philoſophers of every age.</note>.</p>

The Byzantine court was inſulted by five or ſix ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive embaſſies <note n="38" place="bottom">Monteſquien (Conſiderations ſur la Grandeur, &amp;c. c. xix.) has delineated, with a bold and eaſy pencil, ſome of the moſt ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances of the pride of Attila, and the diſgrace of the Romans. He deſerves the praiſe of having read the Fragments of Priſcus, which have been too much diſregarded.</note>; and the miniſters of Attila were uniformly inſtructed to preſs the tardy or imperfect execution of the laſt treaty; to produce the names of fugitives and deſerters, who were ſtill protected by the empire; and to declare, with ſeeming moderation, that unleſs their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign obtained complete and immediate ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, it would be impoſſible for him, were it even his wiſh, to check the reſentment of his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like tribes. Beſides the motives of pride and intereſt, which might prompt the king of the Huns to continue this train of negociation, he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0034700106:75"/>
was influenced by the leſs honourable view of enriching his favourites at the expence of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The Imperial treaſury was exhauſted, to procure the friendly offices of the ambaſſadors, and their principal attendants, whoſe favourable report might conduce to the maintenance of peace. The Barbarian monarch was flattered by the liberal reception of his miniſters; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with pleaſure the value and ſplendour of their gifts, rigorouſly exacted the performance of every promiſe, which would contribute to their private emolument, and treated as an important buſineſs of ſtate, the marriage of his ſecretary Conſtantius <note n="39" place="bottom">See Priſcus, p. 69. 71, 72, &amp;c. I would fain believe, that this adventurer was afterwards crucified by the order of Attila, on a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of treaſonable practices: but Priſcus (p. 57.) has too plainly diſtinguiſhed <hi>two</hi> perſons of the name of Conſtantius, who, from the ſimilar events of their lives, might have been eaſily confounded.</note>. That Gallic adventurer, who was recommended by Aetius to the king of the Huns, had engaged his ſervice to the miniſters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, for the ſtipulated reward of a wealthy and noble wife; and the daughter of count Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turninus was choſen to diſcharge the obligations of her country. The reluctance of the victim, ſome domeſtic troubles, and the unjuſt confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of her fortune, cooled the ardour of her intereſted lover; but he ſtill demanded, in the name of Attila, an equivalent alliance; and, after many ambiguous delays and excuſes, the Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine court was compelled to ſacrifice to this inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtranger the widow of Armatius, whoſe birth, opulence, and beauty, placed her in the moſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0034700106:76"/>
illuſtrious rank of the Roman matrons. For theſe importunate and oppreſſive embaſſies, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tila claimed a ſuitable return: he weighed, with ſuſpicious pride, the character and ſtation of the Imperial envoys; but he condeſcended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he would advance as far as Sardica, to receive any miniſters who had been inveſted with the conſular dignity. The council of Theodoſius eluded this propoſal, by repreſenting the deſolate and ruined condition of Sardica; and even ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to inſinuate, that every officer of the army or houſehold was qualified to treat with the moſt powerful princes of Scythia. Maximin <note n="40" place="bottom">In the Perſian treaty concluded in the year 422, the wiſe and eloquent Maximin had been the aſſeſſor of Ardaburius (Socrates, l. vii. c. 20.). When Marcian aſcended the throne, the office of Great Chamberlain was beſtowed on Maximin, who is ranked, in a public edict, among the four principal miniſters of ſtate (Novell. ad Calc. Cod. Theod. p. 31.). He executed a civil and military com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in the Eaſtern provinces; and his death was lamented by the ſavages of Aethiopia, whoſe incurſions he had repreſſed.

His friend, the hiſtorian Priſcus <note n="41" place="bottom">Priſcus was a native of Panium in Thrace, and deſerved, by his eloquence, an honourable place among the ſophiſts of the age. His Byzantine hiſtory, which related to his own times, was compriſed in ſeven books. See Fabricius, Bibliot. Graec. tom. vi. p. 235, 236. Notwithſtanding the charitable judgment of the critics, I ſuſpect that Priſcus was a Pagan.</note>, embraced the opportunity of obſerving the Barbarian hero in the peaceful and domeſtic ſcenes of life: but the ſecret of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0034700106:77"/>
embaſſy, a fatal and guilty ſecret, was entruſted only to the interpreter Vigilius. The two laſt ambaſſadors of the Huns, Oreſtes, a noble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Pannonian province, and Edecon, a valiant chieftain of the tribe of the Scyrri, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned at the ſame time from Conſtantinople to the royal camp. Their obſcure names were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards illuſtrated by the extraordinary fortune and the contraſt of their ſons: the two ſervants of Attila became the fathers of the laſt Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of the Weſt, and of the firſt Barbarian king of Italy.</p>
            <p>The ambaſſadors, who were followed by a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous <note place="margin">The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy of Maximin to Attila, A. D. 448.</note> train of men and horſes, made their firſt halt at Sardica, at the diſtance of three hundred and fifty miles, or thirteen days journey, from Conſtantinople. As the remains of Sardica were ſtill included within the limits of the empire, it was incumbent on the Romans to exerciſe the duties of hoſpitality. They provided, with the aſſiſtance of the provincials, a ſufficient number of ſheep and oxen; and invited the Huns to a ſplendid, or at leaſt, a plentiful, ſupper. But the harmony of the entertainment was ſoon diſturbed by mutual prejudice and indiſcretion. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the emperor and the empire was warmly maintained by their miniſters; the Huns, with equal ardour, aſſerted the ſuperiority of their victorious monarch: the diſpute was inflamed by the raſh and unſeaſonable flattery of Vigilius, who paſſionately rejected the compariſon of a mere mortal with the divine Theodoſius; and it was with extreme difficulty that Maximin and Priſcus
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0034700106:78"/>
were able to divert the converſation, or to ſoothe the angry minds of the Barbarians. When they roſe from table, the Imperial ambaſſador pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Edecon and Oreſtes with rich gifts of ſilk robes and Indian pearls, which they thankfully accepted. Yet Oreſtes could not forbear inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating, that <hi>he</hi> had not always been treated with ſuch reſpect and liberality: and the offenſive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, which was implied, between his civil office and the hereditary rank of his colleague, ſeems to have made Edecon a doubtful friend, and Oreſtes an irreconcileable enemy. After this entertainment, they travelled about one hundred miles from Sardica to Naiſſus. That flouriſhing city, which had given birth to the great Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, was levelled with the ground: the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were deſtroyed, or diſperſed; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſome ſick perſons, who were ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to exiſt among the ruins of the churches, ſerved only to increaſe the horror of the proſpect. The ſurface of the country was covered with the bones of the ſlain; and the ambaſſadors, who directed their courſe to the north-weſt, were obliged to paſs the hills of modern Servia, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deſcended into the flat and marſhy grounds, which are terminated by the Danube. The Huns were maſters of the great river: their navigation was performed in large canoes, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed out of the trunk of a ſingle tree; the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Theodoſius were ſafely landed on the oppoſite bank; and their Barbarian aſſociates im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately haſtened to the camp of Attila, which was equally prepared for the amuſements of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0034700106:79"/>
hunting, or of war. No ſooner had Maximin advanced about two miles from the Danube, than he began to experience the faſtidious inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the conqueror. He was ſternly forbid to pitch his tents in a pleaſant valley, leſt he ſhould infringe the diſtant awe that was due to the royal manſion. The miniſters of Attila preſſed him to communicate the buſineſs, and the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he reſerved for the ear of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. When Maximin temperately urged the contrary practice of nations, he was ſtill more confounded to find, that the reſolutions of the Sacred Conſiſtory, thoſe ſecrets (ſays Priſcus) which ſhould not be revealed to the gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, had been treacherouſly diſcloſed to the public enemy. On his refuſal to comply with ſuch ignominious terms, the Imperial envoy was commanded inſtantly to depart: the order was recalled; it was again repeated; and the Huns renewed their ineffectual attempts to ſubdue the patient firmneſs of Maximin. At length, by the interceſſion of Scotta, the brother of Onegeſius, whoſe friendſhip had been purchaſed by a liberal gift, he was admitted to the royal preſence; but, inſtead of obtaining a deciſive anſwer, he was compelled to undertake a remote journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, that Attila might enjoy the proud ſatisfaction of receiving, in the ſame camp, the ambaſſadors of the Eaſtern and Weſtern em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires. His journey was regulated by the guides, who obliged him to halt, to haſten his march, or to deviate from the common road, as it beſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0034700106:80"/>
the convenience of the King. The Romans who traverſed the plains of Hungary, ſuppoſe that they paſſed <hi>ſeveral</hi> navigable rivers, either in canoes or portable boats; but there is reaſon to ſuſpect, that the winding ſtream of the Teyſs, or Tibiſcus, might preſent itſelf in different places, under different names. From the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous villages they received a plentiful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſupply of proviſions; mead inſtead of wine, millet in the place of bread, and a certain liquor named <hi>camus,</hi> which, according to the report of Priſcus, was diſtilled from barley <note n="42" place="bottom">The Huns themſelves ſtill continued to deſpiſe the labours of agriculture: they abuſed the privilege of a victorious nation; and the Goths, their induſtrious ſubjects who cultivated the earth, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their neighbourhood, like that of ſo many ravenous wolves (Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, p. 45.). In the ſame manner the Sarts and Tadgies provide for their own ſubſiſtence, and for that of the Uſbec Tartars, their lazy and rapacious ſovereigns. See Genealogical Hiſtory of the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, p. 423. 455, &amp;c.</note>. Such fare might appear coarſe and indelicate to men who had taſted the luxury of Conſtantinople: but, in their accidental diſtreſs, they were relieved by the gentleneſs and hoſpitality of the ſame Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, ſo terrible and ſo mercileſs in war. The ambaſſadors had encamped on the edge of a large moraſs. A violent tempeſt of wind and rain, of thunder and lightning, overturned their tents, immerſed their baggage and furniture in the water, and ſcattered their retinue, who wandered in the darkneſs of the night, uncertain of their road, and apprehenſive of ſome unknown danger, till they awakened by their cries the inhabitants of a neighbouring village, the property of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0034700106:81"/>
widow of Bleda. A bright illumination, and, in a few moments, a comfortable fire of reeds, was kindled by their officious benevolence: the wants, and even the deſires, of the Romans were libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſatisfied; and they ſeem to have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed by the ſingular politeneſs of Bleda's widow, who added to her other favours the gift, or at leaſt the loan, of a ſufficient number of beautiful and obſequious damſels. The ſunſhine of the ſucceeding day was dedicated to repoſe; to collect and dry the baggage, and to the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the men and horſes: but, in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before they purſued their journey, the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors expreſſed their gratitude to the bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lady of the village, by a very acceptable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of ſilver cups, red fleeces, dried fruits, and Indian pepper. Soon after this adventure, they rejoined the march of Attila, from whom they had been ſeparated about ſix days; and ſlowly proceeded to the capital of an empire, which did not contain, in the ſpace of ſeveral thouſand miles, a ſingle city.</p>
            <p>As far as we may aſcertain the vague and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure <note place="margin">The royal village and palace.</note> geography of Priſcus, this capital appears to have been ſeated between the Danube, the Teyſs, and the Carpathian hills, in the plains of Upper Hungary, and moſt probably in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Jazberin, Agria, or Tokay <note n="43" place="bottom">It is evident, that Priſcus paſſed the Danube and the Teyſs, and that he did not reach the foot of the Carpathian hills. Agria, Tokay, and Jazberin, are ſituated in the plains circumſcribed by this definition. M. de Buat (Hiſtoire des Peuples, &amp;c. tom. vii. p 461.) has choſen Tokay; Otrokoſci (p. 180. apud Maſcou, ix. 23.), a learned.

its origin it could be no more than an accidental camp, which, by the long and frequent reſidence of Attila, had inſenſibly ſwelled into a huge vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, for the reception of his court, of the troops who followed his perſon, and of the various mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of idle or induſtrious ſlaves and retainers <note n="44" place="bottom">The royal village of Attila may be compared to the city of Karacorum, the reſidence of the ſucceſſors of Zingis; which, though it appears to have been a more ſtable habitation, did not equal the ſize or ſplendor of the town and abbey of St. Denys; in the 13th cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury (ſee Rubruquis, in the Hiſtorie Generale des Voyages, tom. vii. p. 286.). The camp of Aurengzebe, as it is ſo agreeably deſcribed by Bernier (tom. ii. p. 217—235.), blended the manners of Scythia with the magnificence and luxury of Hindoſtan.</note>. The baths, conſtructed by Onegeſius, were the only edifice of ſtone; the materials had been tranſported from Pannonia; and ſince the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent country was deſtitute even of large timber, it may be preſumed, that the meaner habitations of the royal village conſiſted of ſtraw, of mud, or of canvas. The wooden houſes of the more illuſtrious Huns, were built and adorned with rude magnificence, according to the rank, the fortune, or the taſte of the proprietors. They ſeem to have been diſtributed with ſome degree of order and ſymmetry; and each ſpot became more honourable, as it approached the perſon of the ſovereign. The palace of Attila, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed all other houſes in his dominions, was built entirely of wood, and covered an ample ſpace of ground. The outward encloſure was a lofty wall, or palliſade, of ſmooth ſquare timber, interſected with high towers, but intended rather for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than defence. This wall, which ſeems to

have encircled the declivity of a hill, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended a great variety of wooden edifices, adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the uſes of royalty. A ſeparate houſe was aſſigned to each of the numerous wives of Attila; and, inſtead of the rigid and illiberal confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment impoſed by Aſiatic jealouſy, they politely admitted the Roman ambaſſadors to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, their table, and even to the freedom of an innocent embrace. When Maximin offered his preſents to Cerca, the principal queen, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired the ſingular architecture of her manſion, the height of the round columns, the ſize and beauty of the wood, which was curiouſly ſhaped or turned, or poliſhed, or carved; and his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive eye was able to diſcover ſome taſte in the ornaments, and ſome regularity in the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. After paſſing through the guards, who watched before the gate, the ambaſſadors were introduced into the private apartment of Cerca. The wife of Attila received their viſit ſitting, or rather lying, on a ſoft couch; the floor was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a carpet; the domeſtics formed a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle round the queen; and her damſels, ſeated on the ground, were employed in working the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated embroidery which adorned the dreſs of the Barbaric warriors. The Huns were ambitious of diſplaying thoſe riches which were the fruit and evidence of their victories: the trappings of their horſes, their ſwords, and even their ſhoes, were ſtudded with gold and precious ſtones; and their tables were profuſely ſpread with plates, and gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and vaſes of gold and ſilver, which had
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0034700106:84"/>
been faſhioned by the labour of Grecian artiſts. The monarch alone aſſumed the ſuperior pride of ſtill adhering to the ſimplicity of his Scythian anceſtors <note n="45" place="bottom">When the Moguls diſplayed the ſpoils of Aſia, in the diet of Toncat, the throne of Zingis was ſtill covered with the original black felt carpet, on which he had been ſeated, when he was raiſed to the command of his warlike countrymen. See Vie de Gengiſcan, l. iv. c. 9.</note>. The dreſs of Attila, his arms, and the furniture of his horſe, were plain, without ornament, and of a ſingle colour. The royal table was ſerved in wooden cups and platters; fleſh was his only food; and the conqueror of the North never taſted the luxury of bread.</p>
            <p>When Attila firſt gave audience to the Roman ambaſſadors on the banks of the Danube, his tent <note place="margin">The beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Attila to the Roman ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</note> was encompaſſed with a formidable guard. The monarch himſelf was ſeated in a wooden chair. His ſtern countenance, angry geſtures, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient tone, aſtoniſhed the firmneſs of Maximin; but Vigilius had more reaſon to tremble, ſince he diſtinctly underſtood the menace, that if At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tila did not reſpect the law of nations, he would nail the deceitful interpreter to a croſs, and leave his body to the vultures. The Barbarian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended, by producing an accurate liſt, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the bold falſehood of Vigilius, who had affirmed that no more than ſeventeen deſerters could be found. But he arrogantly declared, that he apprehended only the diſgrace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with his fugitive ſlaves; ſince he deſpiſed their impotent efforts to defend the provinces which Theodofius had entruſted to their arms:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0034700106:85"/>
               <q rend="inline">"For what fortreſs" (added Attila), "what city, in the wide extent of the Roman empire, can hope to exiſt, ſecure and impregnable, if it is our pleaſure that it ſhould be erazed from the earth?"</q> He diſmiſſed, however, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, who returned to Conſtantinople with his peremptory demand of more complete reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and a more ſplendid embaſſy. His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger gradually ſubſided, and his domeſtic ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, in a marriage which he celebrated on the road with the daughter of Eſlam, might perhaps contribute to mollify the native fierceneſs of his temper. The entrance of Attila into the royal village, was marked by a very ſingular ceremony. A numerous troop of women came out to meet their hero, and their king. They marched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, diſtributed into long and regular files: the intervals between the files were filled by white veils of thin linen, which the women on either ſide bore aloft in their hands, and which formed a canopy for a chorus of young virgins, who chanted hymns and ſongs in the Scythian lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. The wife of his favourite Onegeſius, with a train of female attendants, ſaluted Attila at the door of her own houſe, on his way to the palace; and offered, according to the cuſtom of the country, her reſpectful homage, by intreating him to taſte the wine and meat, which ſhe had prepared for his reception. As ſoon as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch had graciouſly accepted her hoſpitable gift, his domeſtics lifted a ſmall ſilver table to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient height, as he ſat on horſeback; and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tila,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0034700106:86"/>
when he had touched the goblet with his lips, again ſaluted the wife of Onegeſius, and continued his march. During his reſidence at the ſeat of empire, his hours were not waſted in the recluſe idleneſs of a ſeraglio; and the king of the Huns could maintain his ſuperior dignity, without concealing his perſon from the public view. He frequently aſſembled his council, and gave audience to the ambaſſadors of the nations; and his people might appeal to the ſupreme tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, which he held at ſtated times, and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eaſtern cuſtom, before the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal gate of his wooden palace. The Romans, both of the Eaſt and of the Weſt, were twice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to the banquets, where Attila feaſted with the princes and nobles of Scythia. Maximin <note place="margin">The royal feaſt.</note> and his colleagues were ſtopped on the threſhold, till they had made a devout libation to the health and proſperity of the king of the Huns; and were conducted, after this ceremony, to their reſpective ſeats in a ſpacious hall. The royal table and couch, covered with carpets and fine linen, was raiſed by ſeveral ſteps in the midſt of the hall; and a ſon, an uncle, or perhaps a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite king, were admitted to ſhare the ſimple and homely repaſt of Attila. Two lines of ſmall tables, each of which contained three or four gueſts, were ranged in order on either hand; the right was eſteemed the moſt honourable, but the Romans ingenuouſly confeſs, that they were placed on the left; and that Beric, an unknown chieftain, moſt probably of the Gothic race, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0034700106:87"/>
the repreſentatives of Theodoſius and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian. The Barbarian monarch received from his cup-bearer a goblet filled with wine, and courteouſly drank to the health of the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed gueſt; who roſe from his ſeat, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, in the ſame manner, his loyal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful vows. This ceremony was ſucceſſively performed for all, or at leaſt for the illuſtrious perſons of the aſſembly; and a conſiderable time muſt have been conſumed, ſince it was thrice repeated, as each courſe of ſervice was placed on the table. But the wine ſtill remained after the meat had been removed; and the Huns conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to indulge their intemperance long after the ſober and decent ambaſſadors of the two empires had withdrawn themſelves from the nocturnal banquet. Yet before they retired, they enjoyed a ſingular opportunity of obſerving the manners of the nation in their convivial amuſements. Two Scythians ſtood before the couch of Attila, and recited the verſes which they had compoſed, to celebrate his valour and his victories. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſilence prevailed in the hall; and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the gueſts was captivated by the vocal harmony, which revived and perpetuated the memory of their own exploits: a martial ardour flaſhed from the eyes of the warriors, who were impatient for battle; and the tears of the old men expreſſed their generous deſpair, that they could no longer partake the danger and glory of the field <note n="46" place="bottom">If we may believe Plutarch (in Demetrio, tom. v. p. 24.) it was the cuſtom of the Scythians, when they indulged in the pleaſures of the table, to awaken their languid courage by the martial harmony of twanging their bow-ſtrings.</note>. This entertainment, which might be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0034700106:88"/>
conſidered as a ſchool of military virtue, was ſucceeded by a farce, that debaſed the dignity of human nature. A Mooriſh and a Scythian buffoon ſucceſſively excited the mirth of the rude ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, by their deformed figure, ridiculous dreſs, antic geſtures, abſurd ſpeeches, and the ſtrange unintelligible confuſion of the Latin, the Gothic, and the Hunnic languages; and the hall reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with loud and licentious peals of laughter. In the midſt of this intemperate riot, Attila alone, without a change of countenance, maintained his ſtedfaſt and inflexible gravity; which was never relaxed, except on the entrance of Irnac, the youngeſt of his ſons: he embraced the boy with a ſmile of paternal tenderneſs, gently pinched him by the cheek, and betrayed a partial affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was juſtified by the aſſurance of his prophets, that Irnac would be the future ſupport of his family and empire. Two days afterwards, the ambaſſadors received a ſecond invitation; and they had reaſon to praiſe the politeneſs, as well as the hoſpitality, of Attila. The king of the Huns held a long and familiar converſation with Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min; but his civility was interrupted by rude expreſſions, and haughty reproaches; and he was provoked, by a motive of intereſt, to ſupport with unbecoming zeal, the private claims of his ſecretary Conſtantius. <q rend="inline">"The emperor" (ſaid Attila) "has long promiſed him a rich wife: Conſtantius muſt not be diſappointed; nor ſhould a Roman emperor deſerve the name of liar."</q> On the third day, the ambaſſadors
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0034700106:89"/>
were diſmiſſed; the freedom of ſeveral captives was granted, for a moderate ranſom, to their preſſing entreaties; and, beſides the royal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, they were permitted to accept from each of the Scythian nobles, the honourable and uſeful gift of a horſe. Maximin returned, by the ſame road, to Conſtantinople; and though he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in an accidental diſpute with Beric, the new ambaſſador of Attila, he flattered himſelf that he had contributed, by the laborious journey, to confirm the peace and alliance of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note n="47" place="bottom">The curious narrative of this embaſſy, which required few obſervations, and was not ſuſceptible of any collateral evidence, may be found in Priſcus, p. 49—70. But I have not confined my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſame order; and I had previouſly extracted the hiſtorical circumſtances, which were leſs intimately connected with the journey, and buſineſs, of the Roman ambaſſadors.</note>.</p>
            <p>But the Roman ambaſſador was ignorant of the <note place="margin">Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Romans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the life of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tila.</note> treacherous deſign, which had been concealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the maſk of the public faith. The ſurpriſe and ſatisfaction of Edecon, when he contemplated the ſplendour of Conſtantinople, had encouraged the interpreter Vigilius to procure for him a ſecret interview with the eunuch Chryſaphius <note n="48" place="bottom">M. de Tillemont has very properly given the ſucceſſion of Chamberlains, who reigned in the name of Theodoſius. Chryſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phius was the laſt, and, according to the unanimous evidence of hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, the worſt of theſe favourites (ſee Hiſt. des Empereurs, tom. vi. p. 117—119. Mem. Eccleſ. tom. xv. p. 438.). His partiality for his godfather, the hereſiarch Eutyches, engaged him to perſecute the orthodox party.</note>, who governed the emperor and the empire. After ſome previous converſation, and a mutual oath of ſecrecy, the eunuch, who had not, from his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0034700106:90"/>
own feelings or experience, imbibed any exalted notions of miniſterial virtue, ventured to propoſe the death of Attila, as an important ſervice, by which Edecon might deſerve a liberal ſhare of the wealth and luxury which he admired. The ambaſſador of the Huns liſtened to the tempting offer; and profeſſed, with apparent zeal, his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as well as readineſs, to execute the bloody deed: the deſign was communicated to the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the offices, and the devout Theodoſius conſented to the aſſaſſination of his invincible enemy. But this perfidious conſpiracy was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by the diſſimulation, or the repentance, of Edecon; and, though he might exaggerate his inward abhorrence for the treaſon, which he ſeemed to approve, he dexterouſly aſſumed the merit of an early and voluntary confeſſion. If we <hi>now</hi> review the embaſſy of Maximin, and the behaviour of Attila, we muſt applaud the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian, who reſpected the laws of hoſpitality, and generouſly entertained and diſmiſſed the miniſter of a prince, who had conſpired againſt his life. But the raſhneſs of Vigilius will appear ſtill more extraordinary, ſince he returned, conſcious of his guilt and danger, to the royal camp; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by his ſon, and carrying with him a weighty purſe of gold, which the favourite eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch had furniſhed, to ſatisfy the demands of Edecon, and to corrupt the fidelity of the guards. The interpreter was inſtantly ſeized, and dragged before the tribunal of Attila, where he aſſerted his innocence with ſpecious firmneſs, till the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0034700106:91"/>
threat of inflicting inſtant death on his ſon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from him a ſincere diſcovery of the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal tranſaction. Under the name of ranſom or confiſcation, the rapacious king of the Huns accepted two hundred pounds of gold for the life of a traitor, whom he diſdained to puniſh. He pointed his juſt indignation againſt a nobler ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. His ambaſſadors Eſlaw and Oreſtes were <note place="margin">He repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and forgives the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</note> immediately diſpatched to Conſtantinople, with a peremptory inſtruction, which it was much ſafer for them to execute than to diſobey. They boldly entered the Imperial preſence, with the fatal purſe hanging down from the neck of Oreſtes; who interrogated the eunuch Chryſaphius, as he ſtood beſide the throne, whether he recogniſed the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his guilt. But the office of reproof was reſerved for the ſuperior dignity of his colleague Eſlaw, who gravely addreſſed the Emperor of the Eaſt in the following words: <q rend="inline">"Theodoſius is the ſon of an illuſtrious and reſpectable parent: Attila likewiſe is deſcended from a noble race; and <hi>he</hi> has ſupported, by his actions, the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which he inherited from his father Mund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuk. But Theodoſius has forfeited his pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal honours, and, by conſenting to pay tribute, has degraded himſelf to the condition of a ſlave. It is therefore juſt, that he ſhould reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the man whom fortune and merit have placed above him; inſtead of attempting, like a wicked ſlave, clandeſtinely to conſpire againſt his maſter."</q> The ſon of Arcadius, who was accuſtomed only to the voice of flattery, heard
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0034700106:92"/>
with aſtoniſhment the ſevere language of truth: he bluſhed and trembled; nor did he preſume directly to refuſe the head of Chryſaphius, which Eſlaw and Oreſtes were inſtructed to demand. A ſolemn embaſſy, armed with full powers and magnificent gifts, was haſtily ſent to deprecate the wrath of Attila; and his pride was gratified by the choice of Nomius and Anatolius, two miniſters of conſular or patrician rank, of whom the one was great treaſurer, and the other was maſter-general of the armies of the Eaſt. He condeſcended to meet theſe ambaſſadors on the banks of the river Drenco; and though he at firſt affected a ſtern and haughty demeanor, his anger was inſenſibly mollified by their eloquence and liberality. He condeſcended to pardon the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, the eunuch, and the interpreter; bound himſelf by an oath to obſerve the conditions of peace; releaſed a great number of captives; abandoned the fugitives and deſerters to their fate; and reſigned a large territory to the ſouth of the Danube, which he had already exhauſted of its wealth and inhabitants. But this treaty was purchaſed at an expence which might have ſupported a vigorous and ſucceſsful war; and the ſubjects of Theodoſius were compelled to redeem the ſafety of a worthleſs favourite by oppreſſive taxes, which they would more cheerfully have paid for his deſtruction <note n="49" place="bottom">This ſecret conſpiracy, and its important conſequences, may be traced in the fragments of Priſcus, p. 37, 38, 39. 54. 70, 71, 72.

Hiſt. Eccleſ. tom. iii. p. 563.), and the Paſchal Chronicle, mention the fall, without ſpecifying the injury: but the conſequence was ſo likely to happen, and ſo unlikely to be invented, that we may ſafely give credit to Nicephorus Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtus, a Greek of the fourteenth century.</note>.

No ſooner had Pulcheria aſcended the throne, than ſhe indulged her own, and the public reſentment, by an act of popular juſtice. Without any legal trial, the eunuch Chryſaphius was executed before the gates of the city; and the immenſe riches which had been accumulated by the rapacious favourite, ſerved only to haſten and to juſtify his puniſhment <note n="51" place="bottom">Pulcheriae nutû (ſays Count Marcellinus) ſuâ cum avaritiâ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teremptus eſt.

The zeal which he diſplayed for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox creed, as it was eſtabliſhed by the council of Chalcedon, would alone have inſpired the grateful eloquence of the Catholics. But the behaviour of Marcian in a private life, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on the throne, may ſupport a more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal belief, that he was qualified to reſtore and invigorate an empire, which had been almoſt diſſolved by the ſucceſſive weakneſs of two here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary monarchs. He was born in Thrace, and educated to the profeſſion of arms; but Marci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's youth had been ſeverely exerciſed by poverty and misfortune, ſince his only reſource, when he firſt arrived at Conſtantinople, conſiſted in two hundred pieces of gold, which he had borrowed of a friend.

            <p>IT was the opinion of Marcian, that war ſhould be avoided, as long as it is poſſible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a ſecure and honourable peace; but it was <note place="margin">Attila threatens both em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, and prepares to invade Gaul, A. D. 450.</note> likewiſe his opinion, that peace cannot be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable or ſecure, if the ſovereign betrays a puſillanimous averſion to war. This temperate courage dictated his reply to the demands of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tila, who inſolently preſſed the payment of the annual tribute. The emperor ſignified to the Barbarians, that they muſt no longer inſult the majeſty of Rome, by the mention of a tribute; that he was diſpoſed to reward, with becoming liberality, the faithful friendſhip of his allies; but that, if they preſumed to violate the public peace, they ſhould feel that he poſſeſſed troops, and arms, and reſolution, to repel their attacks. The ſame language, even in the camp of the Huns, was uſed by his ambaſſador Apollonius, whoſe bold refuſal to deliver the preſents, till he had been admitted to a perſonal interview, diſplayed a ſenſe of dignity, and a contempt of danger, which Attila was not prepared to expect from the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0034700106:97"/>
degenerate Romans <note n="1" place="bottom">See Priſcus, p. 39. 72.</note>. He threatened to chaſtiſe the raſh ſucceſſor of Theodoſius; but he heſitated, whether he ſhould firſt direct his invincible arms againſt the Eaſtern or the Weſtern empire. While mankind awaited his deciſion with awful ſuſpenſe, he ſent an equal defiance to the courts of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna and Conſtantinople; and his miniſters ſaluted the two emperors with the ſame haughty declaration. <q rend="inline">"Attila, <hi>my</hi> lord, and <hi>thy</hi> lord, commands thee to provide a palace for his immediate reception <note n="2" place="bottom">The Alexandrian or Paſchal Chronicle, which introduces this haughty meſſage, during the lifetime of Theodoſius, may have anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated the date; but the dull annaliſt was incapable of inventing the original and genuine ſtyle of Attila.</note>."</q> But as the Barbarian deſpiſed, or affected to deſpiſe, the Romans of the Eaſt, whom he had ſo often vanquiſhed, he ſoon declared his reſolution of ſuſpending the eaſy conqueſt, till he had atchieved a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and important enterpriſe. In the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable invaſions of Gaul and Italy, the Huns were naturally attracted by the wealth and fertility of thoſe provinces; but the particular motives and provocations of Attila, can only be explained by the ſtate of the Weſtern empire under the reign of Valentinian, or, to ſpeak more correctly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the adminiſtration of Aetius <note n="3" place="bottom">The ſecond book of the Hiſtoire Critique de l'Etabliſſement de la Monarchie Françoiſe, tom. i. p. 189—424, throws great light on the ſtate of Gaul, when it was invaded by Attila; but the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous author, the Abbé Dubos, too often bewilders himſelf in ſyſtem and conjecture.</note>.</p>
            <p>After the death of his rival Boniface, Aetius <note place="margin">Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</note> had prudently retired to the tents of the Huns;

and he was indebted to their alliance for his ſafety and his reſtoration. Inſtead of the ſuppliant lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a guilty exile, he ſolicited his pardon <note place="margin">A. D. 433—454.</note> at the head of ſixty thouſand Barbarians; and the empreſs Placidia confeſſed, by a feeble reſiſtance, that the condeſcenſion, which might have been aſcribed to clemency, was the effect of weakneſs or fear. She delivered herſelf, her ſon Valentinian, and the Weſtern empire, into the hands of an inſolent ſubject; nor could Placidia protect the ſon-in-law of Boniface, the virtuous and faithful Sebaſtian <note n="4" place="bottom">Victor Vitenſis (de Perſecut.

Apollinar. Carmen. ix. 181.). His adventures at Conſtantinople, in Sicily, Gaul, Spain, and Africa, are faintly marked in the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of Marcellinus and Idatius.

At the head of an army of Huns, he raſhly advanced to the gates of Thoulouſe, full of careleſs contempt for an enemy, whom his misfortunes had rendered prudent, and his ſituation made deſperate.

Her impatience of long and hopeleſs celibacy, urged her to embrace a ſtrange and deſperate reſolution. The name of Attila was familiar and formidable at Conſtantinople; and his frequent embaſſies entertained a perpetual intercourſe between his camp and the Imperial palace. In the purſuit of love, or rather of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, the daughter of Placidia ſacrificed every duty, and every prejudice; and offered to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her perſon into the arms of a Barbarian, of whoſe language ſhe was ignorant, whoſe figure was ſcarcely human, and whoſe religion and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhe abhorred. By the miniſtry of a faithful eunuch, ſhe tranſmitted to Attila a ring, the pledge of her affection; and earneſtly conjured him to claim her as a lawful ſpouſe, to whom he had been ſecretly betrothed.

The right of female ſucceſſion, though it might derive a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious argument from the recent examples of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidia and Pulcheria, was ſtrenuouſly denied; and the indiſſoluble engagements of Honoria were oppoſed to the claims of her Scythian lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note n="29" place="bottom">See Priſcus, p. 39, 40.

At the diſtance of no more than an hundred years, could he be ignorant, could the people be ignorant, of the fate of a city, the actual reſidence of his ſovereigns, the kings of Auſtraſia? The learned Count, who ſeems to have undertaken the apology of Attila, and the Barbarians, appeals to the falſe Ida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, <hi>parcens</hi> civitatibus Germaniae et Galliae, and forgets, that the true Idatius had explicitly affirmed, plurimae civitates <hi>effractae,</hi> among which he enumerates Metz.</note>, their cuſtomary maxims of war.

From the Rhine and the Moſelle, Attila advanced into the heart of Gaul; croſſed the Seine at Auxerre; and, after a long and laborious march, fixed his camp under the walls of Orleans.

He returned twice, without any intelligence, that could inſpire hope or comfort; but, in his third report, he mentioned a ſmall cloud, which he had faintly deſcried at the extremity of the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon. "It is the aid of God," exclaimed the biſhop, in a tone of pious confidence; and the whole multitude repeated after him, "It is the aid of God." The remote object, on which every eye was fixed, became each moment larger, and more diſtinct; the Roman and Gothic banners were gradually perceived; and a favourable wind blowing aſide the duſt, diſcovered, in deep array, the impatient ſquadrons of Aetius and Theodoric, who preſſed forwards to the relief of Orleans.</p>
            <p>The facility with which Attila had penetrated <note place="margin">Alliance of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans and Viſigoths.</note> into the heart of Gaul, may be aſcribed to his inſidious policy, as well as to the terror of his arms. His public declarations were ſkilfully mitigated by his private aſſurances; he alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſoothed and threatened the Romans and the Goths; and the courts of Ravenna and Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe, mutually ſuſpicious of each other's inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

But on his arrival at Arles, or Lyons, he was confounded by the intelligence, that the Viſigoths, refuſing to embrace the defence of Gaul, had determined to expect, within their own territories, the formidable invader, whom they profeſſed to deſpiſe. The ſenator Avitus, who, after the honourable exerciſe of the praetorian Praefecture, had retired to his eſtate in Auvergne, was perſuaded to accept the important embaſſy, which he executed with ability and ſucceſs.

He ſtrenuouſly urged, that it was the duty of every Chriſtian to ſave, from ſacrilegious vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the churches of God, and the relics of the ſaints: that it was the intereſt of every Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian, who had acquired a ſettlement in Gaul, to defend the fields and vineyards, which were cultivated for his uſe, againſt the deſolation of the Scythian ſhepherds. Theodoric yielded to the evidence of truth; adopted the meaſure at once the moſt prudent and the moſt honourable; and declared, that as the faithful ally of Aetius and the Romans, he was ready to expoſe his life and kingdom for the common ſafety of Gaul <note n="37" place="bottom">The policy of Attila, of Aetius, and of the Viſigoths, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly deſcribed in the Panegyric of Avitus, and the thirty-ſixth chapter of Jornandes.

The doctrine of predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo favourable to martial virtue, was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inculcated by the king of the Huns; who aſſured his ſubjects, that the warriors, protected by Heaven, were ſafe and invulnerable amidſt the darts of the enemy; but that the unerring Fates would ſtrike their victims in the boſom of inglorious peace. <q rend="inline">"I myſelf," continued Attila, "will throw the firſt javelin, and the wretch who refuſes to imitate the example of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, is devoted to inevitable death."</q> The ſpirit of the Barbarians was rekindled by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the voice, and the example of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepid leader; and Attila, yielding to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, immediately formed his order of battle. At the head of his brave and faithful Huns, he occupied, in perſon, the centre of the line. The nations, ſubject to his empire, the Rugians, the Heruli, the Thuringians, the Franks, the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundians, were extended, on either hand, over the ample ſpace of the Catalaunian fields; the right wing was commanded by Ardaric, king of the Gepidae; and the three valiant brothers, who reigned over the Oſtrogoths, were poſted on the left to oppoſe the kindred tribes of the Viſigoths. The diſpoſition of the allies was regulated by a different principle. Sangiban, the faithleſs king of the Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0034700106:125"/>
was placed in the centre; where his motions might be ſtrictly watched, and his treachery might be inſtantly puniſhed. Aetius aſſumed the command of the left, and Theodoric of the right, wing; while Toriſmond ſtill continued to occupy the heights which appear to have ſtretched on the flank, and perhaps the rear, of the Scythian army. The nations from the Volga to the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic were aſſembled on the plain of Châlons; but many of theſe nations had been divided by fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or conqueſt, or emigration; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſimilar arms and enſigns, which threatened each other, preſented the image of a civil war.</p>
            <p>The diſcipline and tactics of the Greeks and Romans form an intereſting part of their national <note place="margin">Battle of Châlons.</note> manners. The attentive ſtudy of the military operations of Xenophon, or Caeſar, or Frederic, when they are deſcribed by the ſame genius which conceived and executed them, may tend to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove (if ſuch improvement can be wiſhed) the art of deſtroying the human ſpecies. But the battle of Châlons can only excite our curioſity, by the magnitude of the object; ſince it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the blind impetuoſity of Barbarians, and has been related by partial writers, whoſe civil or eccleſiaſtical profeſſion ſecluded them from the knowledge of military affairs. Caſſiodorius, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, had familiarly converſed with many Gothic warriors, who ſerved in that memorable engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <q rend="inline">"a conflict," as they informed him, "fierce, various, obſtinate, and bloody; ſuch as could not be paralleled, either in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0034700106:126"/>
or in paſt ages."</q> The number of the ſlain amounted to one hundred and ſixty-two thouſand, or, according to another account, three hundred thouſand perſons <note n="44" place="bottom">The expreſſions of Jornandes, or rather of Caſſiodorius, are extremely ſtrong. Bellum atrox, multiplex, immane, pertinax, cui ſimili nulla uſquam narrat antiquitas: ubi talia geſta referuntur, ut nihil eſſet quod in vitâ ſuâ conſpicere potuiſſet egregius, qui hujus miraculi privaretur aſpectû. Dubos (Hiſt. Critique, tom. i. p. 392, 393.) attempts to reconcile the 162,000 of Jornandes, with the 300,000 of Idatius and Iſidore; by ſuppoſing, that the larger num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber included the total deſtruction of the war, the effects of diſeaſe, the ſlaughter of the unarmed people, &amp;c.</note>; and theſe incredible exaggerations ſuppoſe a real and effective loſs, ſufficient to juſtify the hiſtorian's remark, that whole generations may be ſwept away, by the madneſs of kings, in the ſpace of a ſingle hour. After the mutual and repeated diſcharge of miſſile weapons, in which the archers of Scythia might ſignalize their ſuperior dexterity, the cavalry and infantry of the two armies were furiouſly mingled in cloſer combat. The Huns, who fought under the eyes of their king, pierced through the feeble and doubtful centre of the allies, ſeparated their wings from each other, and wheeling, with a rapid effort, to the left, directed their whole force againſt the Viſigoths. As Theodoric rode along the ranks, to animate his troops, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a mortal ſtroke from the javelin of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages, a noble Oſtrogoth, and immediately fell from his horſe. The wounded king was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the general diſorder, and trampled under the feet of his own cavalry; and this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant death ſerved to explain the ambiguous prophecy of the Haruſpices. Attila already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulted
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0034700106:127"/>
in the confidence of victory, when the valiant Toriſmond deſcended from the hills, and verified the remainder of the prediction. The Viſigoths, who had been thrown into confuſion by the flight, or defection, of the Alani, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually reſtored their order of battle; and the Huns were undoubtedly vanquiſhed, ſince Attila was compelled to retreat. He had expoſed his perſon with the raſhneſs of a private ſoldier; but the intrepid troops of the centre had puſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards beyond the reſt of the line: their attack was faintly ſupported; their flanks were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded; and the conquerors of Scythia and Germany were ſaved by the approach of the night from a total defeat. They retired within the circle of waggons that fortified their camp; and the diſmounted ſquadrons prepared themſelves for a defence, to which neither their arms, nor their temper, were adapted. The event was doubtful: but Attila had ſecured a laſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable reſource. The ſaddles and rich furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the cavalry were collected, by his order, into a funeral pile; and the magnanimous Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian had reſolved, if his intrenchments ſhould be forced, to ruſh headlong into the flames, and to deprive his enemies of the glory which they might have acquired, by the death or captivity of Attila <note n="45" place="bottom">The count de Buat (Hiſt. des Peuples, &amp;c. tom. vii. p. 554—573.), ſtill depending on the <hi>falſe,</hi> and again rejecting the <hi>true</hi> Ida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, has divided the defeat of Attila into two great battles; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer near Orleans, the latter in Champagne: in the one, Theodoric was ſlain; in the other, he was revenged.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0034700106:128"/>
But his enemies had paſſed the night in equal diſorder and anxiety. The inconſiderate courage of Toriſmond was tempted to urge the purſuit, <note place="margin">Retreat of Attila.</note> till he unexpectedly found himſelf, with a few followers, in the midſt of the Scythian waggons. In the confuſion of a nocturnal combat, he was thrown from his horſe; and the Gothic prince muſt have periſhed like his father, if his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtrength, and the intrepid zeal of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, had not reſcued him from this dangerous ſituation. In the ſame manner, but on the left of the line, Aetius himſelf, ſeparated from his allies, ignorant of their victory, and anxious for their fate, encountered and eſcaped the hoſtile troops, that were ſcattered over the plains of Châlons; and at length reached the camp of the Goths, which he could only fortify with a ſlight rampart of ſhields, till the dawn of day. The Imperial general was ſoon ſatisfied of the defeat of Attila, who ſtill remained inactive within his intrenchments; and when he contemplated the bloody ſcene, he obſerved, with ſecret ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the loſs had principally fallen on the Barbarians. The body of Theodoric, pierced with honourable wounds, was diſcovered under a heap of the ſlain: his ſubjects bewailed the death of their king and father; but their tears were min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with ſongs and acclamations, and his funeral rites were performed in the face of a vanquiſhed enemy. The Goths, claſhing their arms, elevated on a buckler his eldeſt ſon Toriſmond, to whom they juſtly aſcribed the glory of their ſucceſs; and the new king accepted the obligation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0034700106:129"/>
as a ſacred portion of his paternal inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. Yet the Goths themſelves were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the fierce and undaunted aſpect of their formidable antagoniſt; and their hiſtorian has compared Attila to a lion encompaſſed in his den, and threatening his hunters with redoubled fury. The kings and nations, who might have deſerted his ſtandard in the hour of diſtreſs, were made ſenſible, that the diſpleaſure of their monarch was the moſt imminent and inevitable danger. All his inſtruments of martial muſic inceſſantly ſounded a loud and animating ſtrain of defiance; and the foremoſt troops who advanced to the aſſault, were checked, or deſtroyed, by ſhowers of arrows from every ſide of the intrenchments. It was determined in a general council of war, to beſiege the king of the Huns in his camp, to intercept his proviſions, and to reduce him to the alternative of a diſgraceful treaty, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal combat. But the impatience of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians ſoon diſdained theſe cautious and dilatory meaſures: and the mature policy of Aetius was apprehenſive, that, after the extirpation of the Huns, the republic would be oppreſſed by the pride and power of the Gothic nation. The patrician exerted the ſuperior aſcendant of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and reaſon, to calm the paſſions, which the ſon of Theodoric conſidered as a duty; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, with ſeeming affection, and real truth, the dangers of abſence and delay; and perſuaded Toriſmond to diſappoint, by his ſpeedy return, the ambitious deſigns of his brothers, who might occupy the throne and treaſures of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe <note n="46" place="bottom">Jornandes de Rebus Geticis, c. 41. p. 671. The policy of Aetius, and the behaviour of Toriſmond, are extremely natural; and the patrician, according to Gregory of Tours (l. ii. c. 7. p. 163.), diſmiſſed the prince of the Franks, by ſuggeſting to him a ſimilar apprehenſion. The falſe Idatius ridiculouſly pretends, that Aetius paid a clandeſtine, nocturnal, viſit to the kings of the Huns and of the Viſigoths; from each of whom he obtained a bribe of ten thouſand pieces of gold, as the price of an undiſturbed retreat.</note>.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0034700106:130"/>
After the departure of the Goths, and the ſeparation of the allied army, Attila was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at the vaſt ſilence that reigned over the plains of Châlons: the ſuſpicion of ſome hoſtile ſtratagem detained him ſeveral days within the circle of his waggons; and his retreat beyond the Rhine confeſſed the laſt victory which was attchieved in the name of the Weſtern empire. Meroveus and his Franks, obſerving a prudent diſtance, and magnifying the opinion of their ſtrength, by the numerous fires which they kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled every night, continued to follow the rear of the Huns, till they reached the confines of Thuringia. The Thuringians ſerved in the army of Attila: they traverſed, both in their march and in their return, the territories of the Franks; and it was perhaps in this war that they exerciſed the cruelties, which, about fourſcore years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, were revenged by the ſon of Clovis. They maſſacred their hoſtages, as well as their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: two hundred young maidens were tortured with exquiſite and unrelenting rage; their bodies were torn aſunder by wild horſes, or their bones were cruſhed under the weight of rolling wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons; and their unburied limbs were abandoned on the public roads, as a prey to dogs and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

Such were thoſe ſavage anceſtors, whoſe imaginary virtues have ſometimes excited the praiſe and envy of civilized ages <note n="47" place="bottom">Theſe cruelties, which are paſſionately deplored by Theodoric, the ſon of Clovis (Gregory of Tours, l. iii. c. 10. p. 190.), ſuit the time and circumſtances of the invaſion of Artila.

In the enſuing ſpring, he repeated his demand, of the princeſs Honoria, and her patrimonial treaſures. The demand was again rejected, or eluded; and the indignant lover immediately took the field, paſſed the Alps, invaded Italy, and beſieged Aquileia with an innumerable hoſt of Barbarians. Thoſe Barbarians were unſkilled in the methods of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting a regular ſiege, which, even among the ancients, required ſome knowledge, or at leaſt ſome practice, of the mechanic arts. But the labour of many thouſand provincials and captives, whoſe lives were ſacrificed without pity, might execute the moſt painful and dangerous work. The ſkill of the Roman artiſts might be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted to the deſtruction of their country. The walls of Aquileia were aſſaulted by a formidable train of battering rams, moveable turrets, and engines, that threw ſtones, darts, and fire <note n="48" place="bottom">Machinis conſtructis, omnibuſque tormentorum generibus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitis.

In the thirteenth century, the Moguls battered the cities of China with large engines, conſtructed by the Mahometans or Chriſtians in their ſervice, which threw ſtones from 150 to 300 pounds weight. In the defence of their country, the Chineſe uſed gunpowder, and even bombs, above an hundred years before they were known in Europe; yet even thoſe celeſtial, or infernal, arms were inſufficient to protect a puſillanimous nation.

the monarch of the Huns employed the forcible impulſe of hope, fear, emulation, and intereſt, to ſubvert the only barrier which delayed the conqueſt of Italy. Aquileia was at that period one of the richeſt, the moſt populous, and the ſtrongeſt of the maritime cities of the Hadriatic coaſt. The Gothic auxiliaries, who appear to have ſerved under their native princes Alaric and Antala, communicated their intrepid ſpirit; and the citizens ſtill remembered the glorious and ſucceſsful reſiſtance, which their anceſtors had oppoſed to a fierce, inexorable Barbarian, who diſgraced the majeſty of the Roman purple. Three months were conſumed without effect in the ſiege of Aquileia; till the want of proviſions, and the clamours of his army, compelled Attila to relinquiſh the enterpriſe; and reluctantly to iſſue his orders, that the troops ſhould ſtrike their tents the next morning, and begin their retreat. But as he rode round the walls, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, angry, and diſappointed, he obſerved a ſtork, preparing to leave her neſt, in one of the towers, and to fly with her infant family towards the country. He ſeized, with the ready penetration of a ſtateſman, this trifling incident, which chance had offered to ſuperſtition; and exclaimed, in a

loud and cheerful tone, that ſuch a domeſtic bird, ſo conſtantly attached to human ſociety, would never have abandoned her ancient ſeats, unleſs thoſe towers had been devoted to impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruin and ſolitude <note n="49" place="bottom">The ſame ſtory is told by Jornandes, and by Procopius (de Bell.

The favourable omen inſpired an aſſurance of victory; the ſiege was renewed, and proſecuted with freſh vigour; a large breach was made in the part of the wall from whence the ſtork had taken her flight; the Huns mounted to the aſſault with irreſiſtible fury; and the ſucceeding generation could ſcarcely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ruins of Aquileia <note n="50" place="bottom">Jornandes, about an hundred years afterwards, affirms, that Aquileia was ſo completely ruined, ita ut vix ejus veſtigia, ut appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reant, reliquerint.

After this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful chaſtiſement, Attila purſued his march; and as he paſſed, the cities of Altinum, Concordia, and Padua, were reduced into heaps of ſtones and aſhes. The inland towns, Vicenza, Verona, and Bergamo, were expoſed to the rapacious cruelty of the Huns. Milan and Pavia ſubmitted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance, to the loſs of their wealth; and applauded the unuſual clemency, which preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the flames the public, as well as private, buildings; and ſpared the lives of the captive multitude. The popular traditions of Comum, Turin, or Modena, may juſtly be ſuſpected; yet
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0034700106:134"/>

Before the irruption of the Barbarians, fifty Venetian cities flouriſhed in peace and proſperity: Aquileia was placed in the moſt conſpicuous ſtation: but the ancient dignity of Padua was ſupported by agriculture and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures; and the property of five hundred citizens, who were entitled to the equeſtrian rank, muſt have amounted, at the ſtricteſt computation, to one million ſeven hundred thouſand pounds. Many families of Aquileia, Padua, and the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent towns, who fled from the ſword of the Huns, found a ſafe, though obſcure, refuge in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring iſlands <note n="55" place="bottom">This emigration is not atteſted by any contemporary evidence: but the fact is proved by the event, and the circumſtances might be preſerved by tradition.

A people, whoſe habitations might be doubtfully aſſigned to the earth or water, ſoon became alike familiar with the two elements; and the demands of avarice ſucceeded to thoſe of neceſſity. The iſlanders, who, from Grado to Chiozza, were intimately connected with each other, penetrated into the heart of Italy, by the ſecure, though laborious, navigation of the rivers and inland canals. Their veſſels, which were continually increaſing in ſize and number, viſited all the harbours of the Gulf; and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which Venice annually celebrates with the Hadriatic, was contracted in her early infancy.

Amidſt the general conſternation, Aetius alone was incapable of fear; but it was impoſſible that he ſhould atchieve, alone, and unaſſiſted, any military exploits worthy of his former renown. The Barbarians who had defended Gaul, refuſed to march to the relief of Italy; and the ſuccours promiſed by the Eaſtern emperor were diſtant and doubtful. Since Aetius, at the head of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic troops, ſtill maintained the field, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed or retarded the march of Attila, he never ſhewed himſelf more truly great, than at the time when his conduct was blamed by an ignorant and ungrateful people <note n="59" place="bottom">Sirmond (Not. ad Sidon.

His brother Dengiſich, with an army of Huns, ſtill formidable in their flight and ruin, maintained his ground above fifteen years on the banks of the Danube.

Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded and oppreſſed by the multitude of his father's ſlaves, the kingdom of Dengiſich was confined to the circle of his waggons; his deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate courage urged him to invade the Eaſtern empire; he fell in battle; and his head, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniouſly expoſed in the Hippodrome, exhibited a grateful ſpectacle to the people of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.

But the emperor of the Weſt, the feeble and diſſolute Valentinian, who had reached his thirty-fifth year without attaining the age of reaſon or cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, abuſed this apparent ſecurity, to undermine the foundations of his own throne, by the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the patrician Aetius. From the inſtinct
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0034700106:147"/>
of a baſe and jealous mind, he hated the man who was univerſally celebrated as the terror of the barbarians, and the ſupport of the republic; and his new favourite, the eunuch Heraclius, awakened the emperor from the ſupine lethargy, which might be diſguiſed, during the life of Placidia <note n="72" place="bottom">Placidia died at Rome, November 27, A.

See Tillemont, Hiſt. des Emp. tom. vi. p. 240.</note>, by the excuſe of filial piety. The fame of Aetius, his wealth and dignity, the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and martial train of Barbarian followers, his powerful dependents, who filled the civil offices of the ſtate, and the hopes of his ſon Gaudentius, who was already contracted to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxia, the emperor's daughter, had raiſed him above the rank of a ſubject. The ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, of which he was ſecretly accuſed, excited the fears, as well as the reſentment, of Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian. Aetius himſelf, ſupported by the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his merit, his ſervices, and perhaps his innocence, ſeems to have maintained a haughty and indiſcreet behaviour. The patrician offended his ſovereign by an hoſtile declaration; he aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated the offence, by compelling him to ratify, with a ſolemn oath, a treaty of reconciliation and alliance; he proclaimed his ſuſpicions; he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected his ſafety; and from a vain confidence that the enemy, whom he deſpiſed, was incapable
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0034700106:148"/>
even of a manly crime, he raſhly ventured his perſon in the palace of Rome. Whilſt he urged, perhaps with intemperate vehemence, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his ſon; Valentinian, drawing his ſword, the firſt ſword he had ever drawn, plunged it in the breaſt of a general who had ſaved his empire: his courtiers and eunuchs ambitiouſly ſtruggled to imitate their maſter; and Aetius, pierced with an hundred wounds, fell dead in the royal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Boethius, the Praetorian praefect, was killed at the ſame moment; and before the event could be divulged, the principal friends of the patrician were ſummoned to the palace, and ſeparately murdered. The horrid deed, palliated by the ſpecious names of juſtice and neceſſity, was immediately communicated by the emperor to his ſoldiers, his ſubjects, and his allies. The nations, who were ſtrangers or enemies to Aetius, generouſly deplored the unworthy fate of a hero: the Barbarians, who had been attached to his ſervice, diſſembled their grief and reſentment; and the public contempt, which had been ſo long entertained for Valentinian, was at once converted into deep and univerſal abhorrence. Such ſentiments ſeldom pervade the walls of a palace; yet the emperor was confounded by the honeſt reply of a Roman, whoſe approbation he had not diſdained to ſolicit. <q rend="inline">"I am ignorant, Sir, of your motives or provocations; I only know, that you have acted like a man who cuts off his right hand with his left <note n="73" place="bottom">Actium Placidus mactavit ſemivir amens, is the expreſſion of Sidonius (Panegyr.

The luxury of Rome ſeems to have attracted the long and frequent viſits of Valentinian; who was conſequently more deſpiſed at Rome, than in <note place="margin">and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhes the wife of Maximus.</note> any other part of his dominions. A republican ſpirit was inſenſibly revived in the ſenate, as their authority, and even their ſupplies, became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ſupport of his feeble government. The ſtately demeanour of an hereditary monarch offended their pride; and the pleaſures of Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian were injurious to the peace and honour of noble families. The birth of the empreſs Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxia was equal to his own, and her charms and tender affection deſerved thoſe teſtimonies of love, which her inconſtant huſband diſſipated in vague and unlawful amours. Petronius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, a wealthy ſenator of the Anician family, who had been twice conſul, was poſſeſſed of a chaſte and beautiful wife: her obſtinate reſiſtance ſerved only to irritate the deſires of Valentinian; and he reſolved to accompliſh them either by ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem or force. Deep gaming was one of the vices of the court: the emperor, who, by chance or contrivance, had gained from Maximus a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſum, uncourteouſly exacted his ring as a ſecurity for the debt; and ſent it by a truſty meſſenger to his wife, with an order, in her huſband's name, that ſhe ſhould immediately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the empreſs Eudoxia. The unſuſpecting wife of Maximus was conveyed in her litter to the Imperial palace; the emiſſaries of her impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient lover conducted her to a remote and ſilent
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0034700106:150"/>
bed-chamber; and Valentinian violated, without remorſe, the laws of hoſpitality. Her tears, when ſhe returned home; her deep affliction; and her bitter reproaches againſt her huſband, whom ſhe conſidered as the accomplice of his own ſhame, excited Maximus to a juſt revenge; the deſire of revenge was ſtimulated by ambition; and he might reaſonably aſpire, by the free ſuffrage of the Roman ſenate, to the throne of a deteſted and deſpicable rival. Valentinian, who ſuppoſed that every human breaſt was devoid, like his own, of friendſhip and gratitude, had impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently admitted among his guards ſeveral domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics and followers of Aetius.

Whilſt Valentinian amuſed himſelf in the field of Mars with the ſpectacle of ſome military ſports, they ſuddenly ruſhed upon him with drawn weapons, diſpatched the guilty Heraclius, and ſtabbed the emperor to the heart, without the <note place="margin">Death of Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, A.

            <p>As early as the time of Cicero and Varro, it <note place="margin">Symptoms of decay and ruin.</note> was the opinion of the Roman augurs, that the <hi>twelve vultures,</hi> which Romulus had ſeen, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the <hi>twelve centuries,</hi> aſſigned for the fatal period of his city <note n="75" place="bottom">This interpretation of Vettius, a celebrated augur, was quoted by Varro, in the xviiith book of his Antiquities.

            </head>
            <p>THE loſs or deſolation of the provinces, from the ocean to the Alps, impaired the glory and greatneſs of Rome: her internal proſperity was ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retrievably <note place="margin">Naval power of the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals. A. D. 439—455.</note> deſtroyed by the ſeparation of Africa. The rapacious Vandals confiſcated the patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial eſtates of the ſenators, and intercepted the regular ſubſidies, which relieved the poverty, and encouraged the idleneſs, of the plebeians. The diſtreſs of the Romans was ſoon aggravated by an unexpected attack; and the province, ſo long cultivated for their uſe by induſtrious and obedient ſubjects, was armed againſt them by an ambitious Barbarian. The Vandals and Alani, who followed the ſucceſsful ſtandard of Genſeric, had acquired a rich and fertile territory, which ſtretched along the coaſt above ninety days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from Tangier to Tripoli; but their narrow limits were preſſed and confined, on either ſide, by the ſandy deſert and the Mediterranean. The diſcovery and conqueſt of the Black nations, that might dwell beneath the torrid zone, could not
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0034700106:155"/>
tempt the rational ambition of Genſeric: but he caſt his eyes towards the ſea; he reſolved to create a naval power, and his bold reſolution was executed with ſteady and active perſeverance. The woods of mount Atlas afforded an inexhauſtible nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of timber; his new ſubjects were ſkilled in the arts of navigation and ſhip-building; he animated his daring Vandals to embrace a mode of warfare which would render every maritime country ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible to their arms; the Moors and Africans were allured by the hopes of plunder; and, after an interval of ſix centuries, the fleets that iſſued from the port of Carthage again claimed the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Mediterranean. The ſucceſs of the Vandals, the conqueſt of Sicily, the ſack of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermo, and the frequent deſcents on the coaſt of Lucania, awakened and alarmed the mother of Valentinian, and the ſiſter of Theodoſius. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances were formed; and armaments, expenſive and ineffectual, were prepared, for the deſtruction of the common enemy; who reſerved his courage to encounter thoſe dangers which his policy could not prevent or elude. The deſigns of the Roman government were repeatedly baffled by his artful delays, ambiguous promiſes, and apparent conceſſions; and the interpoſition of his formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able confederate the king of the Huns, recalled the emperors from the conqueſt of Africa to the care of their domeſtic ſafety. The revolutions of the palace, which left the Weſtern empire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a defender, and without a lawful prince, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the apprehenſions, and ſtimulated the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0034700106:156"/>
of Genſeric. He immediately equipped a numerous fleet of Vandals and Moors, and caſt anchor at the mouth of the Tyber, about three months after the death of Valentinian, and the elevation of Maximus to the Imperial throne.</p>
            <p>The private life of the ſenator Petronius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus <note n="1" place="bottom">Sidonius Apollinaris compoſed the thirteenth epiſtle of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond book, to refute the paradox of his friend Serranus, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a ſingular, though generous, enthuſiaſm for the deceaſed emperor. This epiſtle, with ſome indulgence, may claim the praiſe of an elegant compoſition; and it throws much light on the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Maximus.</note>, <note place="margin">The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and reign of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, A. D. 455, March 17.</note> was often alleged as a rare example of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man felicity. His birth was noble and illuſtrious, ſince he deſcended from the Anician family; his dignity was ſupported by an adequate patrimony in land and money: and theſe advantages of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune were accompanied with liberal arts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent manners, which adorn or imitate the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable gifts of genius and virtue. The luxury of his palace and table was hoſpitable and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant. Whenever Maximus appeared in public, he was ſurrounded by a train of grateful and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequious clients <note n="2" place="bottom">Clientum, praevia, pediſequa, circumfuſa, populoſitas, is the train which Sidonius himſelf (l. i. epiſt. 9.) aſſigns to another ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of conſular rank.</note>; and it is poſſible that among theſe clients, he might deſerve and poſſeſs ſome real friends. His merit was rewarded by the favour of the prince and ſenate: he thrice exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the office of Praetorian praefect of Italy; he was twice inveſted with the conſulſhip, and he obtained the rank of patrician. Theſe civil ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours were not incompatible with the enjoyment
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0034700106:157"/>
of leiſure and tranquillity; his hours, according to the demands of pleaſure or reaſon, were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately diſtributed by a water-clock; and this ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of time may be allowed to prove the ſenſe which Maximus entertained of his own happineſs. The injury which he received from the emperor Valentinian, appears to excuſe the moſt bloody revenge. Yet a philoſopher might have reflected, that, if the reſiſtance of his wife had been ſincere, her chaſtity was ſtill inviolate, and that it could never be reſtored if ſhe had conſented to the will of the adulterer. A patriot would have heſitated, before he plunged himſelf and his country into thoſe inevitable calamities, which muſt follow the extinction of the royal houſe of Theodoſius. The imprudent Maximus diſregarded theſe ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary conſiderations: he gratified his reſentment and ambition; he ſaw the bleeding corpſe of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian at his feet; and he heard himſelf ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted emperor by the unanimous voice of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and people. But the day of his inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the laſt day of his happineſs. He was impriſoned (ſuch is the lively expreſſion of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius) in the palace; and after paſſing a ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs night he ſighed, that he had attained the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of his wiſhes, and aſpired only to deſcend from the dangerous elevation. Oppreſſed by the weight of the diadem, he communicated his anxious thoughts to his friend and quaeſtor Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentius; and when he looked back with unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regret on the ſecure pleaſures of his former life, the emperor exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"O fortunate Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocles <note n="3" place="bottom">

            <p>The reign of Maximus continued about three <note place="margin">His death, A. D. 455. June 12.</note> months. His hours, of which he had loſt the command, were diſturbed by remorſe, or guilt, or terror, and his throne was ſhaken by the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſoldiers, the people, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Barbarians. The marriage of his ſon Palladius with the eldeſt daughter of the late em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, might tend to eſtabliſh the hereditary ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of his family; but the violence which he offered to the empreſs Eudoxia, could proceed only from the blind impulſe of luſt or revenge. His own wife, the cauſe of theſe tragic events, had been ſeaſonably removed by death; and the widow of Valentinian was compelled to violate her decent mourning, perhaps her real grief, and to ſubmit to the embraces of a preſumptuous uſurper, whom ſhe ſuſpected as the aſſaſſin of her deceaſed huſband. Theſe ſuſpicions were ſoon juſtified by the indiſcreet confeſſion of Maximus himſelf; and he wantonly provoked the hatred of his reluctant bride, who was ſtill conſcious that ſhe deſcended from a line of emperors. From
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0034700106:159"/>
the Eaſt, however, Eudoxia could not hope to obtain any effectual aſſiſtance: her father and her aunt Pulcheria were dead; her mother lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed at Jeruſalem in diſgrace and exile; and the ſceptre of Conſtantinople was in the hands of a ſtranger. She directed her eyes towards Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage; ſecretly implored the aid of the king of the Vandals; and perſuaded Genſeric to improve the fair opportunity of diſguiſing his rapacious deſigns by the ſpecious names of honour, juſtice, and compaſſion <note n="4" place="bottom">Notwithſtanding the evidence of Procopius, Evagrius, Idatius, Marcellinus, &amp;c. the learned Muratori (Annali d'Italia, tom. iv. p. 249.) doubts the reality of this invitation, and obſerves, with great truth, "Non ſi può dir quanto ſia facile il popolo a ſognare e "ſpacciar voci falſe." But his argument, from the interval of time and place, is extremely feeble. The figs which grew near Carthage were produced to the ſenate of Rome on the third day.</note>. Whatever abilities Maximus might have ſhewn in a ſubordinate ſtation, he was found incapable of adminiſtering an empire; and though he might eaſily have been informed of the naval preparations, which were made on the oppoſite ſhores of Africa, he expected with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine indifference the approach of the enemy, without adopting any meaſures of defence, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation, or of a timely retreat. When the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals diſembarked at the mouth of the Tyber, the emperor was ſuddenly rouſed from his lethargy by the clamours of a trembling and exaſperated multitude. The only hope which preſented it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his aſtoniſhed mind was that of a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate flight, and he exhorted the ſenators to imitate the example of their prince. But no
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0034700106:160"/>
ſooner did Maximus appear in the ſtreets, than he was aſſaulted by a ſhower of ſtones: a Roman, or a Burgundian, ſoldier claimed the honour of the firſt wound; his mangled body was ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly caſt into the Tyber; the Roman people rejoiced in the puniſhment which they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the author of the public calamities; and the domeſtics of Eudoxia ſignalized their zeal in the ſervice of their miſtreſs <note n="5" place="bottom">

But Rome, and its inhabitants, were
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0034700106:161"/>
delivered to the licentiouſneſs of the Vandals and Moors, whoſe blind paſſions revenged the injuries of Carthage. The pillage laſted fourteen days and nights; and all that yet remained of public or private wealth, of ſacred or profane treaſure, was diligently tranſported to the veſſels of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeric. Among the ſpoils, the ſplendid relics of two temples, or rather of two religions, exhibited a memorable example of the viciſſitude of human and divine things.

and at the end of four hundred years, the ſpoils of Jeruſalem were transferred from Rome to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, by a Barbarian who derived his origin from the ſhores of the Baltic. Theſe ancient monuments might attract the notice of curioſity, as well as of avarice. But the Chriſtian churches, enriched and adorned by the prevailing ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the times, afforded more plentiful mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for ſacrilege; and the pious liberality of pope Leo, who melted ſix ſilver vaſes, the gift of Conſtantine, each of an hundred pounds weight, is an evidence of the damage which he attempted to repair. In the forty-five years, that had elapſed ſince the Gothic invaſion, the pomp and luxury of Rome were in ſome meaſure reſtored; and it was difficult either to eſcape, or to ſatisfy, the avarice of a conqueror, who poſſeſſed leiſure to collect, and ſhips to tranſport, the wealth of the capital. The imperial ornaments of the palace, the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent furniture and wardrobe, the ſideboards of maſſy plate, were accumulated with diſorderly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine: the gold and ſilver amounted to ſeveral thouſand talents; yet even the braſs and copper were laboriouſly removed. Eudoxia herſelf, who advanced to meet her friend and deliverer, ſoon bewailed the imprudence of her own conduct. She was rudely ſtripped of her jewels; and the unfortunate empreſs, with her two daughters, the only ſurviving remains of the great Theodoſius, was compelled, as a captive, to follow the haughty Vandal; who immediately hoiſted ſail, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with a proſperous navigation to the port

Many thouſand Romans of both ſexes, choſen for ſome uſeful or agreeable qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, reluctantly embarked on board the fleet of Genſeric; and their diſtreſs was aggravated by the unfeeling Barbarians, who, in the diviſion of the booty, ſeparated the wives from their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and the children from their parents.

The ordinary diſtribution of his time, as far as it is expoſed to the public view, may be conciſely repreſented. Before day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, he repairs, with a ſmall train, to his domeſtic chapel, where the ſervice is performed by the Arian clergy; but thoſe who preſume to interpret his ſecret ſentiments, conſider this aſſiduous devotion as the effect of habit and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. The reſt of the morning is employed in the adminiſtration of his kingdom. His chair is ſurrounded by ſome military officers of decent aſpect and behaviour: the noiſy crowd of his Barbarian guards occupies the hall of audience; but they are not permitted to ſtand within the veils or curtains, that conceal the council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber from vulgar eyes. The ambaſſadors of the nations are ſucceſſively introduced: Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doric liſtens with attention, anſwers them with diſcreet brevity, and either announces or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, according to the nature of their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his final reſolution.

If he chuſes to hunt, or at leaſt to exerciſe himſelf on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, his bow is carried by a favourite youth; but when the game is marked, he bends it with his own hand, and ſeldom miſſes the object of his aim: as a king, he diſdains to bear arms in ſuch ignoble warfare; but as a ſoldier, he would bluſh to accept any military ſervice which he could perform himſelf. On common days, his dinner is not different from the repaſt of a private citizen; but every Saturday many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable gueſts are invited to the royal table, which, on theſe occaſions, is ſerved with the elegance of Greece, the plenty of Gaul, and the order and diligence of Italy <note n="19" place="bottom">Videas ibi elegantiam Graecam, abundantiam Gallicanam; ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leritatem Italam; publicam pompam, privatam diligentiam, regiam diſciplinam.</note>. The gold or ſilver plate is leſs remarkable for its weight, than for the brightneſs and curious workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: the taſte is gratified without the help of foreign and coſtly luxury; the ſize and number of the cups of wine are regulated with a ſtrict regard to the laws of temperance; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful ſilence that prevails, is interrupted only by grave and inſtructive converſation. After dinner, Theodoric ſometimes indulges himſelf in a ſhort ſlumber; and as ſoon as he wakes, he calls for the dice and tables, encourages his friends to forget the royal majeſty, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted when they freely expreſs the paſſions, which are excited by the incidents of play.

The exploits of Theodoric ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the world, that he had not degenerated from the warlike virtues of his anceſtors. After the eſtabliſhment of the Goths in Aquitain, and the paſſage of the Vandals into Africa, the Suevi, who had fixed their kingdom in Gallicia, aſpired to the conqueſt of Spain, and threatened to extinguiſh the feeble remains of the Roman dominion. The provincials of Carthagena and Tarragona, afflicted by an hoſtile invaſion, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented their injuries and their apprehenſions. Count Fronto was diſpatched, in the name of the emperor Avitus, with advantageous offers of peace and alliance; and Theodoric interpoſed his weighty mediation, to declare, that, unleſs his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law, the king of the Suevi, immediately retired, he ſhould be obliged to arm in the cauſe of juſtice and of Rome. <q rend="inline">"Tell him," replied the haughty Rechiarius, "that I deſpiſe his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and his arms; but that I ſhall ſoon try, whether he will dare to expect my arrival under the walls of Thoulouſe."</q> Such a challenge urged Theodoric to prevent the bold deſigns of his enemy: he paſſed the Pyrenees at the head of the Viſigoths: the Franks and Burgundians ſerved under his ſtandard; and though he profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the dutiful ſervant of Avitus, he privately ſtipulated, for himſelf and his ſucceſſors, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute

The two armies, or rather the two nations, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered each other on the banks of the river Urbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, about twelve miles from Aſtorga; and the deciſive victory of the Goths appeared for a while to have extirpated the name and kingdom of the Suevi.

His entrance was not pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with blood, and the Goths reſpected the chaſtity of their female captives, more eſpecially of the conſecrated virgins: but the greateſt part of the clergy and people were made ſlaves, and even the churches and altars were confounded in the univerſal pillage. The unfortunate king of the Suevi had eſcaped to one of the ports of the ocean; but the obſtinacy of the winds oppoſed his flight; he was delivered to his implacable rival; and Rechiarius, who neither deſired nor expected mercy, received, with manly conſtancy, the death which he would probably have inflicted. After this bloody ſacrifice to policy or reſentment, Theodoric carried his victorious arms as far as Merida, the principal town of Luſitania, without meeting any reſiſtance, except from the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous powers of St. Eulalia; but he was ſtopped in

In his retreat towards the Pyrenees, he revenged his diſappointment on the country through which he paſſed, and in the ſack of Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia and Aſtorga, he ſhewed himſelf a faithleſs ally, as well as a cruel enemy. Whilſt the king of the Viſigoths fought and vanquiſhed in the name of Avitus, the reign of Avitus had expired; and both the honour and the intereſt of Theodoric were deeply wounded by the diſgrace of a friend, whom he had ſeated on the throne of the Weſtern empire <note n="23" place="bottom">This Suevic was is the moſt authentic part of the Chronicle of Idatius, who, as biſhop of Iria Flavia, was himſelf a ſpectator and a ſufferer.

Turon. l. ii. c. 7. p. 162.) was not incompatible with baſe and ſanguinary counſels.</note>. Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, after the death of Aetius, was recalled, and promoted; and his intimate connection with count Ricimer, was the immediate ſtep by which he aſcended the throne of the Weſtern empire. During the vacancy that ſucceeded the abdication of Avitus, the ambitious Barbarian, whoſe birth excluded him from the Imperial dignity, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Italy, with the title of Patrician; reſigned, to his friend, the conſpicuous ſtation of maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general of the cavalry and infantry; and, after an interval of ſome months, conſented to the unanimous wiſh of the Romans, whoſe favour Majorian had ſolicited by a recent victory over the Alemanni <note n="35" place="bottom">The Alemanni had paſſed the Rhaetian Alps, and were deſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Campi Canini,</hi> or Valley of Bellinzone, through which the Teſin flows, in its deſcent from mount Adula, to the Lago Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giore (Cluver.

Godefroy has not given any commentary on theſe additional pieces.</note>. His regulations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the finances manifeſtly tended to remove, or at leaſt to mitigate, the moſt intolerable griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. I. From the firſt hour of his reign, he was ſolicitous.

Novell. Majorian, tit. iv. p. 34.</note>. With this view, he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an univerſal amneſty, a final and abſolute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of all arrears of tribute, of all debts, which, under any pretence, the fiſcal officers might demand from the people. This wiſe dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction of obſolete, vexatious, and unprofitable claims, improved and purified the ſources of the public revenue; and the ſubject, who could now look back without deſpair, might labour with hope and gratitude for himſelf and for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. II. In the aſſeſſment and collection of taxes Majorian reſtored the ordinary juriſdiction of the provincial magiſtrates; and ſuppreſſed the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary commiſſions which had been introduced, in the name of the emperor himſelf, or of the Praetorian praefects. The favourite ſervants, who obtained ſuch irregular powers, were inſolent in their behaviour, and arbitrary in their demands: they affected to deſpiſe the ſubordinate tribunals,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0034700106:182"/>
and they were diſcontented, if their fees and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits did not twice exceed the ſum which they condeſcended to pay into the treaſury. One in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their extortion would appear incredible, were it not authenticated by the legiſlator him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. They exacted the whole payment in gold: but they refuſed the current coin of the empire, and would accept only ſuch ancient pieces as were ſtamped with the names of Fauſtina or the Antonines. The ſubject, who was unprovided with theſe curious medals, had recourſe to the expedient of compounding with their rapacious demands; or, if he ſucceeded in the reſearch, his impoſition was doubled, according to the weight and value of the money of former times <note n="42" place="bottom">The learned Greaves (vol. i. p. 329, 330, 331.) has found, by a diligent inquiry, that <hi>aurei</hi> of the Antonines weighed one hundred and eighteen, and thoſe of the fifth century only ſixty-eight, Engliſh grains. Majorian gives currency to all gold coin, excepting only the <hi>Gallic ſolidus,</hi> from its deficiency, not in the weight, but in the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard.</note>. III. <q rend="inline">"The municipal corporations (ſays the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror), the leſſer ſenates (ſo antiquity has juſtly ſtyled them), deſerve to be conſidered as the heart of the cities, and the ſinews of the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. And yet ſo low are they now reduced, by the injuſtice of magiſtrates, and the venality of collectors, that many of their members, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing their dignity and their country, have taken refuge in diſtant and obſcure exile."</q> He urges, and even compels, their return to their reſpective cities; but he removes the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which had forced them to deſert the exerciſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0034700106:183"/>
of their municipal functions. They are directed, under the authority of the provincial magiſtrates, to reſume their office of levying the tribute; but, inſtead of being made reſponſible for the whole ſum aſſeſſed on their diſtrict, they are only requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to produce a regular account of the payments which they have actually received, and of the defaulters who are ſtill indebted to the public. IV. But Majorian was not ignorant, that theſe corporate bodies were too much inclined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliate the injuſtice and oppreſſion which they had ſuffered; and he therefore revives the uſeful office of the <hi>defenders of cities.</hi> He exhorts the people to elect, in a full and free aſſembly, ſome man of diſcretion and integrity, who would dare to aſſert their privileges, to repreſent their griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, to protect the poor from the tyranny of the rich, and to inform the emperor of the abuſes that were committed under the ſanction of his name and authority.</p>
            <p>The ſpectator, who caſts a mournful view over <note place="margin">The edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Rome.</note> the ruins of ancient Rome, is tempted to accuſe the memory of the Goths and Vandals, for the miſchief which they had neither leiſure, nor power, nor perhaps inclination, to perpetrate. The tempeſt of war might ſtrike ſome lofty tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets to the ground; but the deſtruction which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined the foundations of thoſe maſſy fabrics, was proſecuted, ſlowly and ſilently, during a period of ten centuries; and the motives of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, that afterwards operated without ſhame or controul, were ſeverely checked by the taſte and ſpirit of the emperor Majorian. The decay of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0034700106:184"/>
the city had gradually impaired the value of the public works. The circus and theatres might ſtill excite, but they ſeldom gratified, the deſires of the people: the temples, which had eſcaped the zeal of the Chriſtians, were no longer inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited either by gods or men; the diminiſhed crowds of the Romans were loſt in the immenſe ſpace of their baths and porticoes; and the ſtately libraries and halls of juſtice became uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to an indolent generation, whoſe repoſe was ſeldom diſturbed, either by ſtudy, or buſineſs. The monuments of conſular, or Imperial, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were no longer revered, as the immortal glory of the capital; they were only eſteemed as an inexhauſtible mine of materials, cheaper, and more convenient, than the diſtant quarry. Specious petitions were continually addreſſed to the eaſy magiſtrates of Rome, which ſtated the want of ſtones or bricks for ſome neceſſary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: the faireſt forms of architecture were rudely defaced for the ſake of ſome paltry, or pretended, repairs; and the degenerate Romans, who convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſpoil to their own emolument, demoliſhed, with ſacrilegious hands, the labours of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. Majorian, who had often ſighed over the deſolation of the city, applied a ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to the growing evil <note n="43" place="bottom">The whole edict (Novell. Majorian. tit. vi. p. 35.) is curious. <q>Antiquarum aedium diſſipatur ſpecioſa conſtructio; et ut aliquid reparetur, magna diruuntur.

If I proſecute this Hiſtory, I ſhall not be unmindful of the decline and fall of the <hi>city</hi> of Rome; an intereſting object, to which my plan was originally conſined.</note> He reſerved to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0034700106:185"/>
the prince and ſenate the ſole congniſance of the extreme caſes which might juſtify the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an ancient edifice; impoſed a fine of fifty pounds of gold (two thouſand pounds ſterling), on every magiſtrate, who ſhould preſume to grant ſuch illegal and ſcandalous licence; and threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to chaſtiſe the criminal obedience of their ſubordinate officers, by a ſevere whipping, and the amputation of both their hands. In the laſt inſtance, the legiſlator might ſeem to forget the proportion of guilt and puniſhment; but his zeal aroſe from a generous principle, and Majorian was anxious to protect the monuments of thoſe ages, in which he would have deſired and deſerved to live. The emperor conceived, that it was his intereſt to increaſe the number of his ſubjects; that it was his duty to guard the purity of the marriage-bed: but the means which he employed to accompliſh theſe ſalutary purpoſes, are of an ambiguous, and perhaps exceptionable, kind. The pious maids, who conſecrated their virginity to Chriſt, were reſtrained from taking the veil, till they had reached their fortieth year. Windows under that age were compelled to form a ſecond alliance within the term of five years, by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of half their wealth to their neareſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or to the ſtate. Unequal marriages were condemned or annulled. The puniſhment of confiſcation and exile was deemed ſo inadequate
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0034700106:186"/>
to the guilt of adultery, that, if the criminal returned to Italy, he might, by the expreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Majorian, be ſlain with impunity <note n="44" place="bottom">The emperor chides the lenity of Rogatian, conſular of Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany, in a ſtyle of acrimonious reproof, which ſounds almoſt like perſonal reſentment (Novell. tit. ix. p. 37.). The law of Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, which puniſhed obſtinate widows, was ſoon afterwards repealed by his ſucceſſor Severus (Novell. Sever. tit. i. p. 37.).</note>.</p>
            <p>While the emperor Majorian aſſiduouſly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured <note place="margin">Majorian prepares to invade Africa, A. D. 457.</note> to reſtore the happineſs and virtue of the Romans, he encountered the arms of Genſeric, from his character and ſituation, their moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable enemy. A fleet of Vandals and Moors landed at the mouth of the Liris, or Garigliano: but the Imperial troops ſurpriſed and attacked the diſorderly Barbarians, who were encumbered with the ſpoils of Campania; they were chaced with ſlaughter to their ſhips, and their leader, the king's brother-in-law, was found in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſlain <note n="45" place="bottom">Sidon. Panegyr. Majorian. 385—440.</note>. Such vigilance might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the character of the new reign; but the ſtricteſt vigilance, and the moſt numerous forces, were inſufficient to protect the long-extended coaſt of Italy, from the depredations of a naval war. The public opinion had impoſed a nobler and more arduous taſk on the genius of Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian. Rome expected from him alone the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Africa; and the deſign, which he form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of attacking the Vandals in their new ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was the reſult of bold and judicious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. If the intrepid emperor could have infuſed his own ſpirit into the youth of Italy; if he could
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0034700106:187"/>
have revived, in the field of Mars, the manly exerciſes in which he had always ſurpaſſed his equals; he might have marched againſt Genſeric at the head of a <hi>Roman</hi> army. Such a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of national manners might be embraced by the riſing generation; but it is the misfortune of thoſe princes who laboriouſly ſuſtain a declining monarchy, that, to obtain ſome immediate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or to avert ſome impending danger, they are forced to countenance, and even to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, the moſt pernicious abuſes. Majorian, like the weakeſt of his predeceſſors, was reduced to the diſgraceful expedient of ſubſtituting Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian auxiliaries in the place of his unwarlike ſubjects: and his ſuperior abilities could only be diſplayed in the vigour and dexterity with which he wielded a dangerous inſtrument, ſo apt to recoil on the hand that uſed it. Beſides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, who were already engaged in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the empire, the fame of his liberality and valour attracted the nations of the Danube, the Boryſthenes, and perhaps of the Tanais. Many thouſands of the braveſt ſubjects of Attila, the Gepidae, the Oſtrogoths, the Rugians, the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundians, the Suevi, the Alani, aſſembled in the plains of Liguria; and their formidable ſtrength was balanced by their mutual animoſities <note n="46" place="bottom">The review of the army; and paſſage of the Alps, contain the moſt tolerable paſſages of the Panegyric (470—552.).

ſounding, with his long ſtaff, the depth of the ice, or ſnow, and encouraging the Scythians, who complained of the extreme cold, by the cheerful aſſurance, that they ſhould be ſatisfied with the heat of Africa. The citizens of Lyons had preſumed to ſhut their gates: they ſoon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored, and experienced, the clemency of Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian. He vanquiſhed Theodoric in the field; and admitted to his friendſhip and alliance, a king whom he had found not unworthy of his arms.

Jornandes has ſuppreſſed the defeat and alliance of the Viſigoths, which were ſolemnly proclaimed in Galicia; and are marked in the Chronicle of Idatius.</note>; and the independent Bagaudae, who had eſcaped, or reſiſted, the oppreſſion of former reigns, were diſpoſed to confide in the virtues of Majorian. His camp was filled with Barbarian allies; his throne was ſupported by the zeal of an affectinate people; but the emperor had foreſeen, that it was impoſſible, without a maritime power, to atchieve the conqueſt of Africa. In the firſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic war, the republic had exerted ſuch incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible diligence, that, within ſixty days after the firſt ſtroke of the axe had been given in the foreſt, a fleet of one hundred and ſixty gallies proudly rode at anchor in the ſea <note n="48" place="bottom">Florus, l. ii: c. 2.

Under circumſtances
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0034700106:189"/>
much leſs favourable, Majorian equalled the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and perſeverance of the ancient Romans. The woods of the Apennine were felled; the arſenals and manufactures of Ravenna and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num were reſtored; Italy and Gaul vied with each other in liberal contributions to the public ſervice; and the Imperial navy of three hundred large gallies, with an adequate proportion of tranſports and ſmaller veſſels, was collected in the ſecure and capacious harbour of Carthagena in Spain <note n="49" place="bottom">

The intrepid countenance of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorian animated his troops with a confidence of victory; and if we might credit the hiſtorian Procopius, his courage ſometimes hurried him beyond the bounds of prudence. Anxious to explore, with his own eyes, the ſtate of the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, he ventured, after diſguiſing the colour of his hair, to viſit Carthage, in the character of his own ambaſſador: and Genſeric was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mortified by the diſcovery, that he had entertained and diſmiſſed the emperor of the Romans.

The emperor of the Weſt, who was capable of forming great deſigns, and of ſupporting heavy diſappointments, conſented to a treaty, or rather to a ſuſpenſion of arms; in the full aſſurance that, before he could reſtore his navy, he ſhould be ſupplied with provocations to juſtify a ſecond war. Majorian returned to Italy, to proſecute his labours for the public happineſs; and, as he was conſcious of his own integrity, he might long remain ignorant of the dark conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy which threatened his throne and his life. The recent misfortune of Carthagena ſullied the glory which had dazzled the eyes of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; almoſt every deſcription of civil and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary officers were exaſperated againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, ſince they all derived ſome advantage from the abuſes which he endeavoured to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs; and the patrician Rieimer impelled the inconſtant paſſions of the Barbarians againſt a prince whom he eſteemed and hated.

and their arms ſpread deſolation, or terror, from the columns of Hercules to the mouth of the Nile. As they were more ambitious of ſpoil than of glory, they ſeldom attacked any fortified cities, or engaged any regular troops in the open field. But the celerity of their motions enabled them, almoſt at the ſame time, to threaten and to attack the moſt diſtant objects, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted their deſires; and as they always em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked a ſufficient number of horſes, they had no ſooner landed, than they ſwept the diſmayed country with a body of light cavalry. Yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the example of their king, the native Vandals and Alani inſenſibly declined this toilſome and perilous warfare; the hardy gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the firſt conquerors was almoſt extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and their ſons, who were born in Africa, enjoyed the delicious baths and gardens which had been acquired by the valour of their fathers. Their place was readily ſupplied by a various multitude of Moors and Romans, of captives and outlaws; and thoſe deſperate wretches, who had already violated the laws of their country, were the moſt eager to promote the atrocious acts which diſgrace the victories of Genſeric. In the treatment of his unhappy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, he ſometimes conſulted his avarice, and ſometimes indulged his cruelty; and the maſſacre of five hundred noble citizens of Zant or Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthus, whoſe mangled bodies he caſt into the Ionian ſea, was imputed, by the public indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to his lateſt poſterity.</p>

Such crimes could not be excuſed by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations; but the war, which the king of the Vandals proſecuted againſt the Roman empire, <note place="margin">Negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the Eaſtern empire, A.

The widow of Valentinian, Eudoxia, whom he had led captive from Rome to Carthage, was the ſole heireſs of the Theodoſian houſe; her elder daughter, Eudocia, became the reluctant wife of Hunneric, his eldeſt ſon; and the ſtern father, aſſerting a legal claim, which could not eaſily be refuted or ſatisfied, demanded a juſt proportion of the Imperial patrimony. An adequate, or at leaſt a valuable, compenſation, was offered by the Eaſtern emperor, to purchaſe a neceſſary peace. Eudoxia and her younger daughter, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidia, were honourably reſtored, and the fury of the Vandals was confined to the limits of the Weſtern empire. The Italians, deſtitute of a naval force, which alone was capable of protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their coaſts, implored the aid of the more fortunate nations of the Eaſt; who had formerly acknowledged, in peace and war, the ſupremacy of Rome. But the perpetual diviſion of the two empires had alienated their intereſt and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; the faith of a recent treaty was alleged; and the Weſtern Romans, inſtead of arms and ſhips, could only obtain the aſſiſtance of a cold and ineffectual mediation. The haughty Ricimer, who had long ſtruggled with the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of his ſituation, was at length reduced to addreſs the throne of Conſtantinople, in the humble language of a ſubject; and Italy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,

All ſerious buſineſs was ſuſpended du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this feſtival; the courts of juſtice were ſhut; the ſtreets of Rome, the theatres, the places of public and private reſort, reſounded with hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeal ſongs and dances; and the royal bride, clothed in ſilken robes, with a crown on her head, was conducted to the palace of Ricimer, who had changed his military dreſs for the habit of a conſul and a ſenator. On this memorable occaſion, Sidonius, whoſe early ambition had been ſo fatally blaſted, appeared as the orator of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne, among the provincial deputies who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the throne with congratulations or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints <note n="74" place="bottom">Interveni autem nuptiis Patricii Ricimeris, cui filia perennis Auguſti in ſpem publicae ſecuritatis copulabatur.

The ſituation, and perhaps the character, of Leo, diſſuaded him from expoſing his perſon to the toils and dangers of an African war. But the powers of the Eaſtern empire were ſtrenuouſly exerted to deliver Italy and the Mediterranean from the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals; and Genſeric, who had ſo long oppreſſed both the land and ſea, was threatened from every ſide with a formidable invaſion.

The troops of Egypt,

Thebais, and Libya, were embarked under his command: and the Arabs, with a train of horſes and camels, opened the roads of the deſert. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclius landed on the coaſt of Tripoli, ſurpriſed and ſubdued the cities of that province, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, by a laborious march, which Cato had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly executed <note n="85" place="bottom">The march of Cato from Berenice, in the province of Cyrene, was much longer than that of Heraclius from Tripoli.

The intelligence of this loſs extorted from Genſeric, ſome inſidious and ineffectual propoſitions of peace: but he was ſtill more ſeriouſly alarmed by the reconciliation of Marcellinus with the two empires. The inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent patrician had been perſuaded to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the legitimate title of Anthemius, whom he accompanied in his journey to Rome; the Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matian fleet was received into the harbours of Italy; the active valour of Marcellinus expelled the Vandals from the iſland of Sardinia; and the languid efforts of the Weſt added ſome weight to the immenſe preparations of the Eaſtern Romans. The expence of the naval armament, which Leo ſent againſt the Vandals, has been diſtinctly aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and the curious and inſtructive account diſplays the wealth of the declining empire. The royal demeſnes, or private patrimony of the prince, ſupplied ſeventeen thouſand pounds of gold; forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeven
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0034700106:210"/>
thouſand pounds of gold, and ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand of ſilver, were levied and paid into the treaſury by the Praetorian praefects. But the cities were reduced to extreme poverty; and the diligent calculation of fines and forfeitures, as a valuable object of the revenue, does not ſuggeſt the idea of a juſt, or merciful, adminiſtration. The whole expence, by whatſoever means it was defrayed, of the African campaign, amounted to the ſum of one hundred and thirty thouſand pounds of gold, about five millions two hundred thouſand pounds ſterling, at a time when the value of money appears, from the comparative price of corn, to have been ſomewhat higher than in the preſent age <note n="86" place="bottom">The principal ſum is clearly expreſſed by Procopius (de Bell. Vandal. l. i. c. vi. p. 191.); the ſmaller conſtituent parts, which Tillemont (Hiſt. des Empereurs, tom. vi. p. 396.) has laboriouſly collected from the Byzantine writers, are leſs certain, and leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant. The hiſtorian Malchus laments the public miſery (Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpt. ex Suida in Corp. Hiſt.

The fleet that ſailed from Conſtantinople to Carthage, conſiſted of eleven hundred and thirteen ſhips, and the number of ſoldiers and mariners exceeded one hundred thouſand men. Baſiliſcus, the brother of the empreſs Vorina, was entruſted with this important command. His ſiſter, the wife of Leo, had exaggerated the merit of his former exploits againſt the Scythians. But the diſcovery of his guilt, or incapacity, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the African war; and his friends could only ſave his military reputation, by aſſerting, that he had conſpired with Aſpar to ſpare Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeric,

            <p>Experience has ſhewn, that the ſucceſs of an invader moſt commonly depends on the vigour <note place="margin">Failure of the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and celerity of his operations. The ſtrength and ſharpneſs of the firſt impreſſion are blunted by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay; the health and ſpirit of the troops inſenſibly languiſh in a diſtant climate; the naval and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary force, a mighty effort which perhaps can never be repeated, is ſilently conſumed; and every hour that is waſted in negociation, accuſtoms the enemy to contemplate and examine thoſe hoſtile terrors, which, on their firſt appearance, he deemed irreſiſtible. The formidable navy of Baſiliſcus purſued its proſperous navigation from the Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Boſphorus to the coaſt of Africa. He landed his troops at Cape Bona, or the promontory of Mercury, about forty miles from Carthage <note n="87" place="bottom">This promontory is forty miles from Carthage (Procop. l. i. c. 6. p. 192.) and twenty leagues from Sicily (Shaw's Travels, p. 89.).

The aſſertion of Jornandes (de Succeſſione Regn.), that Baſiliſcus attacked Carthage, muſt be underſtood in a very qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſied ſenſe.</note>. If Baſiliſcus had ſeized the moment of conſternation, and boldly advanced to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, Carthage muſt have ſurrendered, and the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0034700106:212"/>
kingdom of the Vandals was extinguiſhed. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeric beheld the danger with firmneſs, and eluded it with his veteran dexterity. He proteſted, in the moſt reſpectful language, that he was ready to ſubmit his perſon, and his dominions, to the will of the emperor; but he requeſted a truce of five days to regulate the terms of his ſubmiſſion; and it was univerſally believed, that his ſecret libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity contributed to the ſucceſs of this public nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation. Inſtead of obſtinately refuſing whatever indulgence his enemy ſo earneſtly ſolicited, the guilty, or the credulous, Baſiliſcus conſented to the fatal truce; and his imprudent ſecurity ſeemed to proclaim, that he already conſidered himſelf as the conqueror of Africa. During this ſhort inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, the wind became favourable to the deſigns of Genſeric. He manned his largeſt ſhips of war with the braveſt of the Moors and Vandals; and they towed after them many large barks, filled with combuſtible materials. In the obſcurity of the night, theſe deſtructive veſſels were impelled againſt the unguarded and unſuſpecting fleet of the Romans, who were awakened by the ſenſe of their inſtant danger. Their cloſe and crowded order aſſiſted the progreſs of the fire, which was communicated with rapid and irreſiſtible violence; and the noiſe of the wind, the crackling of the flames, the diſſonant cries of the ſoldiers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, who could neither command, nor obey, increaſed the horror of the nocturnal tumult. Whilſt they laboured to extricate themſelves from the fireſhips, and to ſave at leaſt a part of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0034700106:213"/>
navy, the gallies of Genſeric aſſaulted them with temperate and diſciplined valour; and many of the Romans, who eſcaped the fury of the flames, were deſtroyed or taken by the victorious Vandals. Among the events of that diſaſtrous night, the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic, or rather deſperate, courage of John, one of the principal officers of Baſiliſcus, has reſcued his name from oblivion. When the ſhip, which he had bravely defended, was almoſt conſumed, he threw himſelf in his armour into the ſea, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully rejected the eſteem and pity of Genſo, the ſon of Genſeric, who preſſed him to accept honourable quarter, and ſunk under the waves; exclaiming with his laſt breath, that he would never fall alive into the hands of thoſe impious dogs. Actuated by a far different ſpirit, Baſiliſcus, whoſe ſtation was the moſt remote from danger, diſgracefully fled in the beginning of the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, returned to Conſtantinople with the loſs of more than half of his fleet and army, and ſheltered his guilty head in the ſanctuary of St. Sophia, till his ſiſter, by her tears and entreaties, could obtain his pardon from the indignant emperor. Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clius effected his retreat through the deſert; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus retired to Sicily, where he was aſſaſſinated, perhaps at the inſtigation of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expreſſed his ſurpriſe and ſatisfaction, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans themſelves ſhould remove from the world his moſt formidable antagoniſts <note n="89" place="bottom">Damaſcius in Vit.

After the death of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tila, he renewed his alliance with the Viſigoths of Gaul; and the ſons of the elder Theodoric, who ſucceſſively reigned over that warlike nation, were eaſily perſuaded, by the ſenſe of intereſt, to forget the cruel affront which Genſeric had inflicted on their ſiſter <note n="91" place="bottom">Jornandes is our beſt guide through the reigns of Theodoric II. and Euric (de Rebus Geticis, c. 44, 45, 46, 47. p. 675—681.).

The events that relate to Gaul are laboriouſly illuſtrated in the third book of the Abbé Dubos, Hiſt. Critique, tom. i. p. 424—620.</note>. The death of the emperor Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian delivered Theodoric the ſecond from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of fear, and perhaps of honour; he violated his recent treaty with the Romans; and the ample territory of Narbonne, which he firmly united to

The ſelfiſh policy of Ricimer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him to invade the provinces which were in the poſſeſſion of Aegidius, his rival; but the active count, by the defence of Arles, and the victory of Orleans, ſaved Gaul, and checked, during his lifetime, the progreſs of the Viſigoths. Their ambition was ſoon rekindled; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of extinguiſhing the Roman empire in Spain and Gaul, was conceived, and almoſt completed, in the reign of Euric, who aſſaſſinated his brother Theodoric, and diſplayed, with a more ſavage temper, ſuperior abilities, both in peace and war. He paſſed the Pyrenees at the head of a numerous army, ſubdued the cities of Saragoſſa and Pampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luna, vanquiſhed in battle the martial nobles of the Tarragoneſe province, carried his victorious arms into the heart of Luſitania, and permitted the Suevi to hold the kingdom of Gallicia under the Gothic monarchy of Spain <note n="92" place="bottom">See Mariana, Hiſt.

            <p>One of the laſt acts of juriſdiction, which the <note place="margin">Trial of Arvandus, A.

Sidonius, who rejoices that he lived under a reign in which he might pity and aſſiſt a ſtate-criminal, has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, with tenderneſs and freedom, the faults of his indiſcreet and unfortunate friend <note n="97" place="bottom">See Sidonius, l. i. epiſt. 7. p. 15—20, with Sirmond's notes.

The proſe of Sidonius, however vitiated by a falſe and affected taſte, is much ſuperior to his inſipid verſes.</note>. From the perils which he had eſcaped, Arvandus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed confidence rather than wiſdom; and ſuch was the various, though uniform, imprudence of his behaviour, that his proſperity muſt appear much more ſurpriſing than his downfal. The ſecond praefecture, which he obtained within the term of five years, aboliſhed the merit and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of his preceding adminiſtration. His eaſy
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0034700106:218"/>
temper was corrupted by flattery, and exaſperated by oppoſition; he was forced to ſatisfy his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate creditors with the ſpoils of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; his capricious inſolence offended the nobles of Gaul, and he ſunk under the weight of the public hatred. The mandate of his diſgrace ſummoned him to juſtify his conduct before the ſenate; and he paſſed the ſea of Tuſcany with a favourable wind, the preſage, as he vainly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, of his future fortunes. A decent reſpect was ſtill obſerved for the <hi>Praefectorian</hi> rank; and on his arrival at Rome, Arvandus was committed to the hoſpitality, rather than to the cuſtody, of Flavius Aſellus, the count of the ſacred largeſſes, who reſided in the Capitol <note n="98" place="bottom">When the Capitol ceaſed to be a temple, it was appropriated to the uſe of the civil magiſtrate; and it is ſtill the reſidence of the Roman ſenator. The jewellers, &amp;c. might be allowed to expoſe their precious wares in the porticoes.</note>. He was eagerly purſued by his accuſers, the four deputies of Gaul, who were all diſtinguiſhed by their birth, their dignities, or their eloquence. In the name of a great province, and according to the forms of Roman juriſprudence, they inſtituted a civil and criminal action, requiring ſuch a reſtitution as might compenſate the loſſes of individuals, and ſuch puniſhment as might ſatisfy the juſtice of the ſtate. Their charges of corrupt oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion were numerous and weighty; but they placed their ſecret dependence on a letter, which they had intercepted, and which they could prove, by the evidence of his ſecretary, to have been dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0034700106:219"/>
by Arvandus himſelf. The author of this letter ſeemed to diſſuade the king of the Goths from a peace with the <hi>Greek</hi> emperor: he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted the attack of the Britons on the Loire; and he recommended a diviſion of Gaul, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law of nations, between the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goths and the Burgundians <note n="99" place="bottom">Haec ad regem Gothorum, charta videbatur emitti, pacem cum Graeco Imperatore diſſuadens, Britannos ſuper Ligerim ſitos impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari opportere demonſtrans, cum Burgundionibus jure gentium Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias dividi debere confirmans.</note>. Theſe pernicious ſchemes, which a friend could only palliate by the reproaches of vanity and indiſcretion, were ſuſceptible of a treaſonable interpretation; and the deputies had artfully reſolved, not to produce their moſt formidable weapons till the deciſive moment of the conteſt. But their intentions were diſcovered by the zeal of Sidonius. He immediately appriſed the unſuſpecting criminal of his danger; and ſincerely lamented, without any mixture of anger, the haughty preſumption of Arvandus, who rejected, and even reſented, the ſalutary advice of his friends. Ignorant of his real ſituation, Arvandus ſhewed himſelf in the Capitol in the white robe of a candidate, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted indiſcriminate ſalutations and offers of ſervice, examined the ſhops of the merchants, the ſilks and gems, ſometimes with the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a ſpectator, and ſometimes with the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of a purchaſer; and complained of the times, of the ſenate, of the prince, and of the delays of juſtice. His complaints were ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0034700106:220"/>
An early day was fixed for his trial; and Arvandus appeared, with his accuſers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a numerous aſſembly of the Roman ſenate. The mournful garb, which they affected, excited the compaſſion of the judges, who were ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized by the gay and ſplendid dreſs of their adverſary; and when the praefect Arvandus, with the firſt of the Gallic deputies, were directed to take their places on the ſenatorial benches, the ſame contraſt of pride and modeſty was obſerved in their behaviour. In this memorable judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which preſented a lively image of the old republic, the Gauls expoſed, with force and freedom, the grievances of the province; and as ſoon as the minds of the audience were ſufficiently inflamed, they recited the fatal epiſtle. The obſtinacy of Arvandus was founded on the ſtrange ſuppoſition, that a ſubject could not be convicted of treaſon, unleſs he had actually conſpired to aſſume the purple. As the paper was read, he repeatedly, and with a loud voice, acknowledged it for his genuine compoſition; and his aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was equal to his diſmay, when the unanimous voice of the ſenate declared him guilty of a capital offence. By their decree, he was degraded from the rank of a praefect to the obſcure condition of a plebeian, and ignominiouſly dragged by ſervile hands to the public priſon. After a fortnight's adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſenate was again convened to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the ſentence of his death: but while he expected, in the iſland of Aeſculapius, the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

The faults of Arvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus might deſerve compaſſion; but the impunity of Seronatus accuſed the juſtice of the republic, till he was condemned, and executed, on the complaint of the people of Auvergne. That flagitious miniſter, the Catiline of his age and country, held a ſecret correſpondence with the Viſigoths, to betray the province which he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: his induſtry was continually exerciſed in the diſcovery of new taxes and obſolete offences; and his extravagant vices would have inſpired contempt, if they had not excited fear and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence <note n="101" place="bottom">Catilina ſeculi noſtri.

The peaceful and proſperous reign which Anthemius had promiſed to the Weſt, was ſoon clouded by misfortune and diſcord. Ricimer, apprehenſive, or impatient, of a ſuperior, retired from Rome,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0034700106:222"/>

Italy was gradually divided into two independent and hoſtile kingdoms; and the nobles of Liguria, who trembled at the near approach of a civil war, fell proſtrate at the feet of the patrician, and conjured him to ſpare their unhappy country. <q rend="inline">"For my own part," replied Ricimer, in a tone of inſolent moderation, "I am ſtill inclined to embrace the friendſhip of the Galatian <note n="103" place="bottom">Galatam concitatum.

Their

recommendation was approved; and Epiphanius, aſſuming the benevolent office of mediation, proceeded without delay to Rome, where he was received with the honours due to his merit and reputation. The oration of a biſhop in favour of peace, may be eaſily ſuppoſed: he argued, that in all poſſible circumſtances, the forgiveneſs of injuries muſt be an act of mercy, or magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or prudence; and be ſeriouſly admoniſhed the emperor to avoid a conteſt with a fierce Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian, which might be fatal to himſelf, and muſt be ruinous to his dominions. Anthemius acknowledged the truth of his maxims; but he deeply felt, with grief and indignation, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of Ricimer; and his paſſion gave elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and energy to his diſcourſe. <q rend="inline">"What favours," he warmly exclaimed, "have we refuſed to this ungrateful man?

The clemency of the emperor was extorted from his weakneſs; and Ricimer ſuſpended his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious deſigns, till he had ſecretly prepared the engines, with which he reſolved to ſubvert the throne of Anthemius. The maſk of peace and moderation was then thrown aſide. The army of Ricimer was fortified by a numerous reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Burgundians and Oriental Suevi: he diſclaimed all allegiance to the Greek emperor, marched from Milan to the gates of Rome, and fixing his camp on the banks of the Anio, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently expected the arrival of Olybrius, his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial candidate.</p>

The friendſhip of the public enemy might render Olybrius ſtill more unpopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to the Italians; but when Ricimer meditated the ruin of the emperor Anthemius, he tempted with the offer of a diadem the candidate who could juſtify his rebellion by an illuſtrious name, and a royal alliance. The huſband of Placidia, who, like moſt of his anceſtors, had been inveſted with the conſular dignity, might have continued to enjoy a ſecure and ſplendid fortune in the peaceful reſidence of Conſtantinople; nor does he appear to have been tormented by ſuch a genius, as cannot be amuſed or occupied, unleſs by the adminiſtration of an empire.

Pannonia. When that province was ceded to the Huns, he entered into the ſervice of Attila, his lawful ſovereign, obtained the office of his ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and was repeatedly ſent ambaſſador to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, to repreſent the perſon, and ſignify the commands, of the imperious monarch. The death of that conqueror reſtored him to his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and Oreſtes might honourably refuſe either to follow the ſons of Attila into the Scythian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, or to obey the Oſtrogoths, who had uſurped the dominion of Pannonia. He preferred the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Italian princes, the ſucceſſors of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian; and, as he poſſeſſed the qualifications of courage, induſtry, and experience, he advanced with rapid ſteps in the military profeſſion, till he was elevated, by the favour of Nepos himſelf, to the dignities of patrician, and maſter-general of the troops. Theſe troops had been long accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to reverence the character and authority of Oreſtes, who affected their manners, converſed with them in their own language, and was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected with their national chieftains, by long habits of familiarity and friendſhip.

muſt inculcate, will be retorted againſt himſelf; and that the precarious ſovereign of Italy was only permitted to chuſe, whether he would be the ſlave, or the victim, of his Barbarian mercenaries. The dangerous alliance of theſe ſtrangers, had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and inſulted the laſt remains of Roman freedom and dignity.

Oreſtes, with a ſpirit which, in another ſituation, might be entitled to our eſteem, choſe rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the rage of an armed multitude, than to ſubſcribe the ruin of an innocent people. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the audacious demand; and his refuſal was favourable to the ambition of Odoacer; a bold Barbarian, who aſſured his fellow-ſoldiers, that, if they dared to aſſociate under his command, they might ſoon extort the juſtice which had been denied to their dutiful petitions. From all the camps and garriſons of Italy, the confederates, actuated by the ſame reſentment and the ſame hopes, impatiently flocked to the ſtandard of this popular leader; and the unfortunate patrician, overwhelmed by the torrent, haſtily retreated to the ſtrong city of Pavia, the epiſcopal ſeat of the holy Epiphanites. Pavia was immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged,

During the ſame period, Chriſtianity was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by almoſt all the Barbarians, who eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed their kingdoms on the ruins of the Weſtern empire; the Burgundians in Gaul, the Suevi in Spain, the Vandals in Africa, the Oſtrogoths in Pannonia, and the various bands of Mercenaries, that raiſed Odoacer to the throne of Italy. The Franks and the Saxons ſtill perſevered in the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Paganiſm; but the Franks obtained the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of Gaul by their ſubmiſſion to the example of Clovis; and the Saxon conquerors of Britain were reclaimed from their ſavage ſuperſtition by the miſſionaries of Rome. Theſe Barbarian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felytes diſplayed an ardent and ſucceſsful zeal in the propagation of the faith. The Merovingian kings, and their ſucceſſors, Charlemagne and the Othos, extended by their laws and victories, the dominion of the croſs. England produced the apoſtle of Germany; and the evangelic light was gradually diffuſed from the neighbourhood of the Rhine, to the nations of the Elbe, the Viſtula, and the Baltic. <note n="78" place="bottom">Moſheim has ſlightly ſketched the progreſs of Chriſtianity in the North, from the fourth to the fourteenth century.

            <p>The different motives which influenced the <note place="margin">Motives of their faith.</note> reaſon, or the paſſions, of the Barbarian converts, cannot eaſily be aſcertained. They were often capricious and accidental; a dream, an omen, the report of a miracle, the example of ſome prieſt, or hero, the charms of a believing wife, and above all, the fortunate event of a prayer, or vow,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0034700106:282"/>

The advantage of temporal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity had deſerted the Pagan cauſe, and paſſed over to the ſervice of Chriſtianity. The Romans themſelves, the moſt powerful and enlightened nation of the globe, had renounced their ancient ſuperſtition; and, if the ruin of their empire ſeemed to accuſe the efficacy of the new faith, the diſgrace was already retrieved by the converſion of the victorious Goths. The valiant and fortunate Barbarians, who ſubdued the provinces of the Weſt, ſucceſſively received, and reflected, the ſame edifying example. Before the age of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne, the Chriſtian nations of Europe might exult in the excluſive poſſeſſion of the temperate climates, of the fertile lands, which produced
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0034700106:284"/>

            <p>Chriſtianity, which opened the gates of Heaven <note place="margin">Effects of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</note> to the Barbarians, introduced an important change in their moral and political condition. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, at the ſame time, the uſe of letters, ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to a religion whoſe doctrines are contained in a ſacred book; and while they ſtudied the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth, their minds were inſenſibly enlarged by the diſtant view of hiſtory, of nature, of the arts, and of ſociety. The verſion of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into their native tongue, which had facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated their converſion, muſt excite, among their clergy, ſome curioſity to read the original text, to underſtand the ſacred liturgy of the church, and to examine, in the writings of the fathers, the chain of eccleſiaſtical tradition. Theſe ſpiritual gifts were preſerved in the Greek and Latin lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, which concealed the ineſtimable monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ancient learning. The immortal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Virgil, Cicero, and Livy, which were acceſſible to the Chriſtian Barbarians, maintained a ſilent intercourſe between the reign of Auguſtus, and the times of Clovis and Charlemagne, The emulation of mankind was encouraged by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of a more perfect ſtate; and the flame of ſcience was ſecretly kept alive, to warm and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0034700106:285"/>
enlighten the mature age of the Weſtern world. In the moſt corrupt ſtate of Chriſtianity, the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians might learn juſtice from the <hi>law,</hi> and mercy from the <hi>goſpel:</hi> and if the knowledge of their duty was inſufficient to guide their actions, or to regulate their paſſions; they were ſometimes reſtrained by conſcience, and frequently puniſhed by remorſe. But the direct authority of religion was leſs effectual, than the holy communion which united them with their Chriſtian brethren in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual friendſhip. The influence of theſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contributed to ſecure their fidelity in the ſervice, or the alliance, of the Romans, to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the horrors of war, to moderate the inſolence of conqueſt, and to preſerve, in the downfall of the empire, a permanent reſpect for the name and inſtitutions of Rome. In the days of Paganiſm, the prieſts of Gaul and Germany reigned over the people, and controuled the juriſdiction of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; and the zealous proſelytes transferred an equal, or more ample, meaſure of devout obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to the pontiffs of the Chriſtian faith. The ſacred character of the biſhops was ſupported by their temporal poſſeſſions; they obtained an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſeat in the legiſlative aſſemblies of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and freemen; and it was their intereſt, as well as their duty, to mollify, by peaceful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, the fierce ſpirit of the Barbarians. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual correſpondence of the Latin clergy, the frequent pilgrimages to Rome and Jeruſalem, and the growing authority of the Popes, cemented the union of the Chriſtian republic: and gradually produced the ſimilar manners, and common juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence,

which have diſtinguiſhed, from the reſt of mankind, the independent, and even hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, nations of modern Europe.</p>
            <p>But the operation of theſe cauſes was checked <note place="margin">They are involved in the Arian hereſy.</note> and retarded by the unfortunate accident, which infuſed a deadly poiſon into the cup of Salvation. Whatever might be the early ſentiments of Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philas, his connections with the empire and the church were formed during the reign of Arianiſm. The apoſtle of the Goths ſubſcribed the creed of Rimini; profeſſed with freedom, and perhaps with ſincerity, that the SON was not equal, or conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial to the FATHER <note n="82" place="bottom">The opinions of Ulphilas and the Goths inclined to Semi-Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm, ſince they would not ſay that the Son was a <hi>creature,</hi> though they held communion with thoſe who maintained that hereſy.

His Catholic ſubjects were oppreſſed by intolerant laws, and arbitrary puniſhments.

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0034700106:290"/>
The religious war was preceded and prepared by an inſidious truce; perſecution was made the ſerious and important buſineſs of the Vandal court; and the loathſome diſeaſe, which haſtened the death of Hunneric, revenged the injuries, without contributing to the deliverance, of the church. The throne of Africa was ſucceſſively filled by the two nephews of Hunneric; by Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damund, who reigned about twelve, and by <note place="margin">Gunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund, A. D. 484.</note> Thraſimund, who governed the nation above twenty-ſeven years. Their adminiſtration was hoſtile and oppreſſive to the orthodox party. Gundamund appeared to emulate, or even to ſurpaſs, the cruelty of his uncle; and, if at length he relented, if he recalled the biſhops, and reſtored the freedom of Athanaſian worſhip, a premature death intercepted the benefits of his tardy clemency. His brother, Thraſimund, was the greateſt and moſt accompliſhed of the Vandal <note place="margin">Thraſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund, A.

Inſtead of threats and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he employed the gentle, but efficacious, powers of ſeduction. Wealth, dignity, and the royal favour, were the liberal rewards of apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy; the Catholics, who had violated the laws, might purchaſe their pardon by the renunciation of their faith; and whenever Thraſimund medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated any rigorous meaſure, he patiently waited till the indiſcretion of his adverſaries furniſhed him with a ſpecious opportunity. Bigotry was his laſt ſentiment in the hour of death: and he

exacted from his ſucceſſor a ſolemn oath, that he would never tolerate the ſectaries of Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius. But his ſucceſſor, Hilderic, the gentle ſon of the ſavage Hunneric, preferred the duties of <note place="margin">Hilderic, A.

were denounced againſt the guilt, both of the miſſionary, and the proſelyte. By theſe arts, the faith of the Barbarians was preſerved, and their zeal was inflamed: they diſcharged, with devout fury, the office of ſpies, informers, or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners; and whenever their cavalry took the field, it was the favourite amuſement of the march, to defile the churches, and to inſult the clergy of the adverſe faction <note n="99" place="bottom">See Procopius de Bell.

During the night they were confined, like a herd of cattle, amidſt their own ordure: during the day they purſued their march over the burning ſands; and if they fainted under the heat and fatigue, they were goaded, or dragged along, till they expired in the hands of their tormentors <note n="100" place="bottom">See this ſtory in Victor. ii. 8—12. p. 30—34.

They excite the flame which they ſtrive to extinguiſh; and it ſoon becomes neceſſary to chaſtiſe the contumacy, as well as the crime, of the offender. The fine, which he is unable or unwilling to diſcharge, expoſes his perſon to the ſeverity of the law; and his contempt of lighter penalties ſuggeſts the uſe and propriety of capital puniſhment. Through the veil of fiction and declamation, we may clearly perceive, that the Catholics, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially under the reign of Hunneric, endured the moſt cruel and ignominious treatment <note n="101" place="bottom">See the fifth book of Victor.

Reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able citizens, noble matrons, and conſecrated virgins, were ſtripped naked, and raiſed in the air by pullies, with a weight ſuſpended at their feet. In this painful attitude their naked bodies were torn with ſcourges, or burnt in the moſt tender parts with red-hot plates of iron. The amputation of the ears, the noſe, the tongue, and the right-hand, was inflicted by the Arians; and although the preciſe number cannot be defined, it is evident that many perſons, among whom a biſhop <note n="102" place="bottom">Victor. ii. 18. p. 41.</note> and a proconſul <note n="103" place="bottom">Victor. v. 4. p. 74, 75.

The ſame honour has been aſcribed to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of count Sebaſtian, who profeſſed the Nicene creed with unſhaken conſtancy; and Genſeric might deteſt, as an heretic, the brave and ambitious fugitive whom he dreaded as a rival <note n="104" place="bottom">Victor. i. 6. p. 8, 9.

A new mode of converſion, which might ſubdue the feeble, and alarm the timorous, was employed by the Arian miniſters. They impoſed, by fraud or violence, the rites of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and puniſhed the apoſtacy of the Catholics, if they diſclaimed this odious and profane cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which ſcandalouſly violated the freedom of the will, and the unity of the ſacrament <note n="105" place="bottom">Victor. v. 12, 13.

His Vandal clergy were ſtill more ignorant; and ſmall confidence could be placed in the Africans who had conformed.</note>, diſqualified the Barbarians for the eccleſiaſtical miniſtry of a great church; and the Africans, after the loſs of their orthodox paſtors, were deprived of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic exerciſe of Chriſtianity. VIII. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors were the natural protectors of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouſian doctrine: and the faithful people of Africa, both as Romans and as Catholics, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their lawful ſovereignty to the uſurpation of the Barbarous heretics. During an interval of peace and friendſhip, Hunneric reſtored the cathedral of Carthage; at the interceſſion of Zeno, who reigned in the Eaſt, and of Placidia, the daughter and relict of emperors, and the ſiſter of the queen of the Vandals <note n="108" place="bottom">Victor. ii. 1, 2. p. 22.</note>.

An oath was required from the biſhops, who were aſſembled at Carthage, that they would ſupport the ſucceſſion of his ſon Hilderic, and

The conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own ſuperiority might have raiſed them above the arts, and paſſions, of religious warfare. Yet, inſtead of aſſuming ſuch honourable pride, the orthodox theologians were tempted, by the aſſurance of impunity, to compoſe fictions, which muſt be ſtigmatized with the epithets of fraud and forgery. They aſcribed their own polemical works to the moſt venerable names of Chriſtian antiquity: the characters of Athanaſius

Love and honour might excite Hermenegild to reſent this injurious treatment of his bride; and he was gradually perſuaded, that Ingundis ſuffered for the cauſe of divine truth. Her tender complaints, and the weighty arguments of Leander, arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Seville, accompliſhed his converſion; and the heir of the Gothic monarchy was initiated in the Nicene faith by the ſolemn rites of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation <note n="128" place="bottom">The Catholics who admitted the baptiſm of heretics, repeated the rite, or, as it was afterwards ſtyled, the ſacrament of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to which they aſcribed many myſtic and marvellous preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, both viſible and inviſible. See Chardon, Hiſt. des Sacremens, tom. i. p. 405—552.</note>. The raſh youth, inflamed by zeal, and perhaps by ambition, was tempted to violate the duties of a ſon, and a ſubject; and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics of Spain, although they could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of perſecution, applauded his pious rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt an heretical father. The civil war was protracted by the long and obſtinate ſieges of Merida, Cordova, and Seville, which had ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly eſpouſed the party of Hermenegild. He invited the orthodox Barbarians, the Suevi, and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0034700106:307"/>
the Franks, to the deſtruction of his native land: he folicited the dangerous aid of the Romans, who poſſeſſed Africa, and a part of the Spaniſh coaſt; and his holy ambaſſador, the archbiſhop Leander, effectually negociated in perſon with the Byzantine court. But the hopes of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics were cruſhed by the active diligence of a monarch who commanded the troops and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Spain; and the guilty Hermenegild, after his vain attempts to reſiſt or to eſcape, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſurrender himſelf into the hands of an incenſed father. Leovigild was ſtill mindful of that ſacred character; and the rebel, deſpoiled of the regal ornaments, was ſtill permitted, in a decent exile, to profeſs the Catholic religion. His repeated and unſucceſsful treaſons at length provoked the indignation of the Gothic king; and the ſentence of death, which he pronounced with apparent reluctance, was privately executed in the tower of Seville. The inflexible conſtancy with which he refuſed to accept the Arian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as the price of his ſafety, may excuſe the honours that have been paid to the memory of St. Hermenegild. His wife and infant ſon were detained by the Romans in ignominious captivity: and this domeſtic misfortune tarniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the glories of Leovigild, and embittered the laſt moments of his life.</p>
            <p>His ſon and ſucceſſor, Recared, the firſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic king of Spain, had imbibed the faith of <note place="margin">Converſion of Recared and the Viſigoths of Spain, A.

againſt his father, Recared patiently expected the hour of his death. Inſtead of condemning his memory, he piouſly ſuppoſed, that the dying monarch had abjured the errors of Arianiſm, and recommended to his ſon the converſion of the Gothic nation. To accompliſh that ſalutary end, Recared convened an aſſembly of the Arian clergy and nobles, declared himſelf a Catholic, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to imitate the example of their prince. The laborious interpretation of doubtful texts, or the curious purſuit of metaphyſical arguments, would have excited an endleſs controverſy; and the monarch diſcreetly propoſed to his illiterate audience, two ſubſtantial and viſible arguments, the teſtimony of Earth, and of Heaven. The <hi>Earth</hi> had ſubmitted to the Nicene ſynod: the Romans, the Barbarians, and the inhabitants of Spain, unanimouſly profeſſed the ſame orthodox creed; and the Viſigoths reſiſted, almoſt alone, the conſent of the Chriſtian world. A ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious age was prepared to reverence, as the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Heaven,</hi> the preternatural cures, which were performed by the ſkill or virtue of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic clergy; the baptiſmal fonts of Oſſet in Boetica <note n="129" place="bottom">Oſſet, or Julia Conſtantia, was oppoſite to Seville, on the northern ſide of the Boetis (Plin. Hiſt. Natur. iii. 3.): and the authentic reference of Gregory of Tours (Hiſt.

They had been recently united by Leovigild to the Gothic monarchy of Spain.</note>. The Catholic king encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſome difficulties on this important change of the national religion. A conſpiracy, ſecretly fomented by the queen-dowager, was formed againſt his life; and two counts excited a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous revolt in the Narbonneſe Gaul. But Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cared diſarmed the conſpirators, defeated the rebels, and executed ſevere juſtice; which the Arians, in their turn, might brand with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of perſecution. Eight biſhops, whoſe names betray their Barbaric origin, abjured their errors; and all the books of Arian theology were reduced to aſhes, with the houſe in which they had been purpoſely collected. The whole body of the Viſigoths and Suevi were allured or driven into the pale of the Catholic communion; the faith, at leaſt of the riſing generation, was fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and ſincere; and the devout liberality of the Barbarians enriched the churches and monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of Spain. Seventy biſhops, aſſembled in the council of Toledo, received the ſubmiſſion of their conquerors; and the zeal of the Spaniards improved the Nicene creed, by declaring the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion

of the Holy Ghoſt, from the Son, as well as from the Father; a weighty point of doctrine, which produced, long afterwards, the ſchiſm of the Greek and Latin churches <note n="132" place="bottom">This addition to the Nicene, or rather the Conſtantinopolitan creed, was firſt made in the eighth council of Toledo, A. D. 653; but it was expreſſive of the popular doctrine (Gerard Voſſius, tom. vi. p. 527. de tribus Symbolis).</note>. The royal proſelyte immediately ſaluted and conſulted pope Gregory, ſurnamed the Great, a learned and holy prelate, whoſe reign was diſtinguiſhed by the converſion of heretics and infidels. The ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of Recared reſpectfully offered on the threſhold of the Vatican his rich preſents of gold and gems: they accepted, as a lucrative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, the hairs of St. John the Baptiſt; a croſs, which incloſed a ſmall piece of the true wood; and a key, that contained ſome particles of iron which had been ſcraped from the chains of St. Peter <note n="133" place="bottom">See Gregor.

            <p>The ſame Gregory, the ſpiritual conqueror of <note place="margin">Converſion of the Lombards of Italy, A.

Her devout labours ſtill left room for the induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and ſucceſs of future miſſionaries; and many cities of Italy were ſtill diſputed by hoſtile biſhops. But the cauſe of Arianiſm was gradually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the weight of truth, of intereſt, and of example; and the controverſy, which Egypt had
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0034700106:311"/>
derived from the Platonic ſchool, was terminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after a war of three hundred years, by the final converſion of the Lombards of Italy <note n="134" place="bottom">Paul Warnefrid (de Geſtis Langobard. l. iv. c. 44. p. 853. edit.

The pious <hi>Deacon</hi> does not attempt to mark the preciſe aera of the national converſion, which was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, however, before the end of the ſeventh century.</note>.</p>
            <p>The firſt miſſionaries who preached the goſpel <note place="margin">Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews in Spain, A.

But no ſooner had they eſtabliſhed their ſpiritual dominion, than they exhorted the Chriſtian kings to extirpate, without mercy, the remains of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Barbaric ſuperſtition. The ſucceſſors of Clovis inflicted one hundred laſhes on the peaſants who refuſed to deſtroy their idols; the crime of ſacrificing to the daemons was puniſhed by the Anglo-Saxon laws with the heavier penalties of impriſonment and confiſcation; and even the wiſe Alfred adopted, as an indiſpenſable duty, the extreme rigour of the Moſaic inſtitutions <note n="136" place="bottom">See the Hiſtorians of France, tom. iv. p. 114.; and Wilkins, Leges Anglo-Saxonicae, p. 11. 31. Siquis ſacrificium immolaverit praeter Deo ſoli morte moriatur.</note>. But the puniſhment, and the crime, were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually aboliſhed among a Chriſtian people: the theological diſputes of the ſchools were ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by propitious ignorance; and the intolerant ſpirit, which could find neither idolaters nor he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0034700106:312"/>
was reduced to the perſecution of the Jews. That exiled nation had founded ſome ſynagogues in the cities of Gaul; but Spain, ſince the time of Hadrian, was filled with their numerous colonies <note n="137" place="bottom">The Jews pretend that they were introduced into Spain by the fleets of Solomon, and the arms of Nebuchadnezzar; that Hadrian tranſported forty thouſand families of the tribe of Judah, and ten thouſand of the tribe of Benjamin, &amp;c. Baſnage, Hiſt. des Juifs, tom. vii. c. 9. p. 240—256.</note>. The wealth which they accumulated by trade, and the management of the finances, invited the pious avarice of their maſters; and they might be oppreſſed without danger, as they had loſt the uſe, and even the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, of arms. Siſebut, a Gothic king, who reigned in the beginning of the ſeventh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, proceeded at once to the laſt extremes of perſecution <note n="138" place="bottom">Iſidore, at that time archbiſhop of Seville, mentions, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, and congratulates, the zeal of Siſebut (Chron. Goth. p. 728.). Baronius (A. D. 614, No 41.) aſſigns the number on the evidence of Aimoin, l. iv. c. 22.): but the evidence is weak, and I have not been able to verify the quotation (Hiſtorians of France, tom. iii. p. 127.).</note>. Ninety thouſand Jews were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to receive the ſacrament of baptiſm; the fortunes of the obſtinate infidels were confiſcated, their bodies were tortured; and it ſeems doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful whether they were permitted to abandon their native country. The exceſſive zeal of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic king was moderated, even by the clergy of Spain, who ſolemnly pronounced an inconſiſtent ſentence: <hi>that</hi> the ſacraments ſhould not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly impoſed; but <hi>that</hi> the Jews who had been baptized ſhould be conſtrained, for the honour of the church, to perſevere in the external practice
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0034700106:313"/>
of a religion which they diſbelieved, and deteſted. Their frequent relapſes provoked one of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of Siſebut to baniſh the whole nation from his dominions; and a council of Toledo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a decree, that every Gothic king ſhould ſwear to maintain this ſalutary edict. But the tyrants were unwilling to diſmiſs the victims, whom they delighted to torture, or to deprive themſelves of the induſtrious ſlaves, over whom they might exerciſe a lucrative oppreſſion. The Jews ſtill continued in Spain, under the weight of the civil and eccleſiaſtical laws, which in the ſame country have been faithfully tranſcribed in the Code of the Inquiſition. The Gothic kings and biſhops at length diſcovered, that injuries will produce hatred, and that hatred will find the opportunity of revenge. A nation, the ſecret or profeſſed enemies of Chriſtianity, ſtill multiplied in ſervitude, and diſtreſs; and the intrigues of the Jews promoted the rapid ſucceſs of the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian conquerors <note n="139" place="bottom">Baſnage (tom. viii. c. 13. p. 388—400.) faithfully repreſents the ſtate of the Jews: but he might have added from the canons of the Spaniſh councils, and the laws of the Viſigoths, many curious circumſtances, eſſential to his ſubject, though they are foreign to mine.</note>.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Barbarians withdrew their <note place="margin">Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> powerful ſupport, the unpopular hereſy of Arius ſunk into contempt and oblivion. But the Greeks ſtill retained their ſubtle and loquacious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: the eſtabliſhment of an obſcure doctrine ſuggeſted new queſtions, and new diſputes; and it was always in the power of an ambitious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, or a fanatic monk, to violate the peace of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0034700106:314"/>
the church, and, perhaps, of the empire. The hiſtorian of the empire may overlook thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes which were confined to the obſcurity of ſchools and ſynods. The Manichaeans, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to reconcile the religions of Chriſt and of Zoroaſter, had ſecretly introduced themſelves into the provinces: but theſe foreign ſectaries were involved in the common diſgrace of the Gnoſtics, and the Imperial laws were executed by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic hatred. The rational opinions of the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians were propagated from Britain to Rome, Africa, and Paleſtine, and ſilently expired in a ſuperſtitious age. But the Eaſt was diſtracted by the Neſtorian and Eutychian controverſies; which attempted to explain the myſtery of the incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and haſtened the ruin of Chriſtianity in her native land. Theſe controverſies were firſt agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated under the reign of the younger Theodoſius: but their important conſequences extend far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the limits of the preſent volume. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical chain of argument, the conteſts of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical ambition, and their political influence on the decline of the Byzantine empire, may afford an intereſting and inſtructive ſeries of hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, from the general councils of Epheſus and Chalcedon, to the conqueſt of the Eaſt by the ſucceſſors of Mahomet.</p>

In the ſpace of four hundred years, the hardy Gauls, who had encountered the arms of Caeſar, were impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibly melted into the general maſs of citizens and ſubjects: the Weſtern empire was diſſolved; and the Germans, who had paſſed the Rhine, fiercely contended for the poſſeſſion of Gaul, and excited the contempt, or abhorrence, of its peaceful and poliſhed inhabitants. With that conſcious pride
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0034700106:317"/>
which the pre-eminence of knowledge and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury ſeldom fails to inſpire, they derided the hairy and gigantic ſavages of the North; their ruſtic manners, diſſonant joy, voracious appetite, and their horrid appearance, equally diſguſting to the ſight and to the ſmell. The liberal ſtudies were ſtill cultivated in the ſchools of Autun and Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux; and the language of Cicero and Virgil was familiar to the Gallic youth. Their ears were aſtoniſhed by the harſh and unknown ſounds of the Germanic dialect, and they ingeniouſly lamented that the trembling muſes fled from the harmony of a Burgundian lyre. The Gauls were endowed with all the advantages of art and nature; but as they wanted courage to defend them, they were juſtly condemned to obey, and even to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the victorious Barbarians, by whoſe clemency they held their precarious fortunes and their lives <note n="4" place="bottom">Sidonius Apollinaris ridicules, with affected wit and pleaſantry, the hardſhips of his ſituation (Carm. xii. in tom. i. p. 811.).</note>.</p>

Arles and Marſeilles ſurrendered to his arms: he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the freedom of Auvergne; and the biſhop condeſcended to purchaſe his recal from exile by a tribute of juſt, but reluctant, praiſe. Sidonius waited before the gates of the palace among a crowd of ambaſſadors and ſuppliants; and their various buſineſs at the court of Bordeaux atteſted the power, and the renown, of the king of the Viſigoths. The Heruli of the diſtant ocean, who painted their naked bodies, with its caerulean co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, implored his protection; and the Saxons reſpected the maritime provinces of a prince, who was deſtitute of any naval force. The tall Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundians ſubmitted to his authority; nor did he reſtore the captive Franks, till he had impoſed on that fierce nation the terms of an unequal peace. The Vandals of Africa cultivated his uſeful friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and the Oſtrogoths of Pannonia were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by his powerful aid againſt the oppreſſion of the neighbouring Huns.

Clovis encountered the invaders of Gaul in the plain of Tolbiac, about twenty-four miles from Cologne; and the two fierceſt nations of Germany were mutually animated by the memory of paſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, and the proſpect of future greatneſs.

The great Theodoric congratulated the victory of Clovis, whoſe ſiſter Albofleda the king of Italy had lately married; but he mildly interceded with his brother in favour of the ſuppliants and fugitives, who had implored his protection. The Gallic territories, which were poſſeſſed by the Alemanni, became the prize of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror; and the haughty nation, invincible, or rebellious, to the arms of Rome, acknowledged the ſovereignty of the Merovingian kings, who graciouſly permitted them to enjoy their peculiar manners and inſtitutions, under the government of official, and, at length, of hereditary, dukes. After the conqueſt of the Weſtern provinces, the Franks alone maintained their ancient habitations beyond the Rhine.

They accepted, without ſhame or reluctance, the generous capitulation, which was propoſed by a Catholic hero; and this ſpurious, or legitimate, progeny of the Roman legions, was diſtinguiſhed in the ſucceeding age by their arms, their enſigns, and their peculiar dreſs and inſtitutions.

The accidental, or artificial, prodigies which adorned the expedition of Clovis, were accepted by a ſuperſtitious age, as the manifeſt declaration <note place="margin">Victory of Clovis, A.

From the fourth to the fourteenth century, theſe <hi>ſortes ſanctorum,</hi> as they are ſtiled, were repeatedly condemned by the decrees of councils, and repeatedly practiſed by kings, biſhops, and ſaints. See a curious diſſertation of the Abbé du Reſnel, in the Memoires de l'Academie, tom. xix. p. 287—310.</note>. Orleans ſecured to the Franks a bridge on the Loire; but, at the diſtance of forty miles from Poitiers, their progreſs was intercepted by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſwell of the river Vigenna, or Vienne; and the oppoſite banks were covered by the encampment of the Viſigoths. Delay muſt be always dangerous to Barbarians, who conſume the country through which they march; and had Clovis poſſeſſed leiſure and materials, it might
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0034700106:343"/>
have been impracticable to conſtruct a bridge, or to force a paſſage, in the face of a ſuperior enemy. But the affectionate peaſants, who were impatient to welcome their deliverer, could eaſily betray ſome unknown, or unguarded, ford: the merit of the diſcovery was enhanced by the uſeful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of fraud or fiction; and a white hart, of ſingular ſize and beauty, appeared to guide and animate the march of the Catholic army. The counſels of the Viſigoths were irreſolute and diſtracted. A crowd of impatient warriors, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous in their ſtrength, and diſdaining to ſly before the robbers of Germany, excited Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric to aſſert in arms the name and blood of the conqueror of Rome. The advice of the graver chieftains preſſed him to elude the firſt ardour of the Franks; and to expect, in the ſouthern provinces of Gaul, the veteran and victorious Oſtrogoths, whom the king of Italy had already ſent to his aſſiſtance. The deciſive moments were waſted in idle deliberation; the Goths too haſtily abandoned, perhaps, an advantageous poſt; and the opportunity of a ſecure retreat was loſt by their ſlow and diſorderly motions. After Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis had paſſed the ford, as it is ſtill named, of the <hi>Hart,</hi> he advanced with bold and haſty ſteps to prevent the eſcape of the enemy. His nocturnal march was directed by a flaming meteor, ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the air above the cathedral of Poitiers; and this ſignal, which might be previouſly concerted with the orthodox ſucceſſor of St. Hilary, was compared to the column of fire that guided the

Iſraelites in the deſert. At the third hour of the day, about ten miles beyond Poitiers, Clovis overtook, and inſtantly attacked, the Gothic army; whoſe defeat was already prepared by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and confuſion. Yet they rallied in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme diſtreſs, and the martial youths, who had clamorouſly demanded the battle, refuſed to ſurvive the ignominy of flight. The two kings encountered each other in ſingle combat. Alaric fell by the hand of his rival; and the victorious Frank was ſaved by the goodneſs of his cuiraſs, and the vigour of his horſe, from the ſpears of two deſperate Goths, who furiouſly rode againſt him, to revenge the death of their ſovereign. The vague expreſſion of a mountain of the ſlain, ſerves to indicate a cruel, though indefinite, ſlaughter; but Gregory has carefully obſerved, that his valiant countryman Apollinaris, the ſon of Sidonius, loſt his life at the head of the nobles of Auvergne. Perhaps theſe ſuſpected Catholics had been maliciouſly expoſed to the blind aſſault of the enemy; and perhaps the influence of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was ſuperſeded by perſonal attachment, or military honour <note n="52" place="bottom">After correcting the text, or excuſing the miſtake, of Proco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius, who places the defeat of Alaric near Carcaſſone, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from the evidence of Gregory, Fortunatus, and the author of the Geſta Francorum, that the battle was fought <hi>in campo Vocladenſi,</hi> on the banks of the Clain, about ten miles to the ſouth of Poitiers.

that it is almoſt equally difficult to foreſee the events of war, or to explain their various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. A bloody and complete victory has ſometimes yielded no more than the poſſeſſion of the field; and the loſs of ten thouſand men has ſometimes been ſufficient to deſtroy, in a ſingle day, the work of ages. The deciſive battle of Poitiers was followed by the conqueſt of Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Alaric had left behind him an infant ſon, a baſtard competitor, factious nobles, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal people; and the remaining forces of the Goths were oppreſſed by the general conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or oppoſed to each other in civil diſcord. The victorious king of the Franks proceeded without delay to the ſiege of Angoulême. At the ſound of his trumpets the walls of the city imitated the example of Jericho, and inſtantly fell to the ground; a ſplendid miracle, which may be reduced to the ſuppoſition, that ſome clerical engineers had ſecretly undermined the foundations of the rampart <note n="53" place="bottom">Angoulême is in the road from Poitiers to Bordeaux; and although Gregory delays the ſiege, I can more readily believe that he confounded the order of hiſtory, than that Clovis neglected the rules of war.</note>.

Yet the laws of the Barbarians were adapted to their wants and deſires, their occupations and their capacity; and they all contributed to preſerve the peace, and promote the improvements, of the ſociety for whoſe uſe they were originally eſtabliſhed.

The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the poor, who purchaſed life by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of all that can render life deſirable, was gradually imitated by the feeble and the devout, who, in times of public diſorder, puſillanimouſly crowded to ſhelter themſelves under the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a powerful chief, and around the ſhrine of a popular ſaint. Their ſubmiſſion was accepted by theſe temporal, or ſpiritual, patrons; and the haſty tranſaction irrecoverably fixed their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and that of their lateſt poſterity. From the reign of Clovis, during five ſucceſſive cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, the laws and manners of Gaul uniformly tended to promote the increaſe, and to confirm the duration, of perſonal ſervitude. Time and violence almoſt obliterated the intermediate ranks of ſociety; and left an obſcure and narrow inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val between the noble and the ſlave.

The brave and numerous inhabitants diſplayed a ſingular trophy; the ſword of Caeſar himſelf, which he had loſt when he was repulſed before the walls of Gergovia <note n="100" place="bottom">When Caeſar ſaw it, he laughed (Plutarch. in Caeſar. in tom. i. p. 409.): yet he relates his unſucceſsful ſiege of Gergovia, with leſs frankneſs than we might expect from a great man to whom victory was familiar. He acknowledges, however, that in one attack he loſt forty-ſix centurions and ſeven hundred men (de Bell. Gallico, l. vi. c. 44.—53. in tom. i. p. 270—272.).</note>.

            <p>The Viſigoths had reſigned to Clovis the <note place="margin">The Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goths of Spain.</note> greateſt part of their Gallic poſſeſſions; but their loſs was amply compenſated by the eaſy conqueſt, and ſecure enjoyment, of the provinces of Spain. From the monarchy of the Goths, which ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved the Suevic kingdom of Galicia, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Spaniards ſtill derive ſome national vanity: but the hiſtorian of the Roman Empire is neither invited, nor compelled, to purſue the obſcure and barren ſeries of their annals <note n="122" place="bottom">Spain, in theſe dark ages, has been peculiarly unfortunate. The Franks had a Gregory of Tours; the Saxons, or Angles, a Bede; the Lombards, a Paul Warnefrid, &amp;c. But the hiſtory of the Viſigoths is contained in the ſhort and imperfect chronicles of Iſidore of Seville, and John of Biclar.</note>. The Goths of Spain were ſeparated from the reſt of mankind, by the lofty ridge of the Pyrenaean mountains: their manners and inſtitutions, as far as they were common to the Germanic tribes, have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready explained. I have anticipated, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding chapter, the moſt important of their eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical events, the fall of Arianiſm, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Jews: and it only remains to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſome intereſting circumſtances, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the civil and eccleſiaſtical conſtitution of the Spaniſh kingdom.</p>
            <p>After their converſion from idolatry or hereſy, <note place="margin">Legiſlative aſſemblies of Spain.</note> the Franks and the Viſigoths were diſpoſed to

embrace, with equal ſubmiſſion, the inherent evils, and the accidental benefits, of ſuperſtition. But the prelates of France, long before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the Merovingian race, had degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into fighting and hunting Barbarians. They diſdained the uſe of ſynods; forgot the laws of temperance and chaſtity; and preferred the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of private ambition and luxury, to the general intereſt of the ſacerdotal profeſſion <note n="123" place="bottom">Such are the complaints of St. Boniface, the apoſtle of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, and the reformer of Gaul (in tom. iv. p. 94.). The four-ſcore years, which he deplores, of licence and corruption, would ſeem to inſinuate, that the Barbarians were admitted into the clergy about the year 660.</note>. The biſhops of Spain reſpected themſelves, and were reſpected by the public: their indiſſoluble union diſguiſed their vices, and confirmed their authority: and the regular diſcipline of the church introduced peace, order, and ſtability into the government of the ſtate. From the reign of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cared, the firſt Catholic king, to that of Witiza, the immediate predeceſſor of the unfortunate Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric, ſixteen national councils were ſucceſſively convened. The ſix metropolitans, Toledo, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, Merida, Braga, Tarragona, and Narbonne, preſided according to their reſpective ſeniority; the aſſembly was compoſed of their ſuffragan biſhops, who appeared in perſon, or by their proxies; and a place was aſſigned to the moſt holy or opulent of the Spaniſh abbots. During the firſt three days of the convocation, as long as they agitated the eccleſiaſtical queſtions of doctrine and diſcipline, the profane laity was excluded from
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0034700106:386"/>
their debates; which were conducted, however, with decent ſolemnity. But, on the morning of the fourth day, the doors were thrown open for the entrance of the great officers of the palace, the dukes and counts of the provinces, the judges of the cities, and the Gothic nobles: and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Heaven were ratified by the conſent of the people. The ſame rules were obſerved in the provincial aſſemblies, the annual ſynods which were empowered to hear complaints, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs grievances; and a legal government was ſupported by the prevailing influence of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh clergy. The biſhops, who, in each revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were prepared to flatter the victorious, and to inſult the proſtrate, laboured, with diligence and ſucceſs, to kindle the flames of perſecution, and to exalt the mitre above the crown. Yet the national councils of Toledo, in which the free ſpirit of the Barbarians was tempered and guided by epiſcopal policy, have eſtabliſhed ſome pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent laws for the common benefit of the king and people. The vacancy of the throne was ſupplied by the choice of the biſhops and Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines; and, after the failure of the line of Alaric, the regal dignity was ſtill limited to the pure and noble blood of the Goths. The clergy, who anointed their lawful prince, always recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſometimes practiſed, the duty of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance: and the ſpiritual cenſures were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced on the heads of the impious ſubjects, who ſhould reſiſt his authority, conſpire againſt his life, or violate, by an indecent union, the chaſtity even of his widow. But the monarch
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0034700106:387"/>
himſelf, when he aſcended the throne, was bound by a reciprocal oath to God and his people, that he would faithfully execute his important truſt. The real or imaginary faults of his adminiſtration were ſubject to the controul of a powerful ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy; and the biſhops and palatines were guarded by a fundamental privilege, that they ſhould not be degraded, impriſoned, tortured, nor puniſhed with death, exile, or confiſcation, unleſs by the free and public judgment of their peers <note n="124" place="bottom">The acts of the councils of Toledo are ſtill the moſt authentic records of the church and conſtitution of Spain. The following paſſages are particularly important (iii. 17, 18. iv. 75. v. 2, 3, 4, 5. 8. vi. 11, 12, 13, 14. 17, 18. vii. 1. xiii. 2, 3, 6.).

            <p>One of theſe legiſlative councils of Toledo, <note place="margin">Code of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goths.</note> examined and ratified the code of laws which had been compiled by a ſucceſſion of Gothic kings, from the fierce Euric, to the devout Egica. As long as the Viſigoths themſelves were ſatisfied with the rude cuſtoms of their anceſtors, they indulged their ſubjects of Aquitain and Spain in the enjoyment of the Roman law. Their gradual improvement in arts, in policy, and at length in religion, encouraged them to imitate, and to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſede, theſe foreign inſtitutions; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a code of civil and criminal juriſprudence, for the uſe of a great and united people. The ſame obligations, and the ſame privileges, were communicated to the nations of the Spaniſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy: and the conquerors, inſenſibly renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

the Teutonic idiom, ſubmitted to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of equity, and exalted the Romans to the participation of freedom. The merit of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial policy was enhanced by the ſituation of Spain, under the reign of the Viſigoths. The Provincials were long ſeparated from their Arian maſters, by the irreconcilable difference of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. After the converſion of Recared had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the prejudices of the Catholics, the coaſts, both of the Ocean and Mediterranean, were ſtill poſſeſſed by the Eaſtern emperors; who ſecretly excited a diſcontented people, to reject the yoke of the Barbarians, and to aſſert the name and dignity of Roman citizens. The allegiance of doubtful ſubjects is indeed moſt effectually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by their own perſuaſion, that they hazard more in a revolt, than they can hope to obtain by a revolution; but it has appeared ſo natural to oppreſs thoſe whom we hate and fear, that the contrary ſyſtem well deſerves the praiſe of wiſdom and moderation <note n="125" place="bottom">The Code of the Viſigoths, regularly divided into twelve books, has been correctly publiſhed by Dom Bouquet (in tom. iv. p. 273—460.).

About forty years after the diſſolution of the Roman government, Vortigern appears to have obtained the ſupreme, though precarious, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <note place="margin">Deſcent of the Saxons, A. D. 449.</note> of the princes and cities of Britain. That unfortunate monarch has been almoſt unanimouſly condemned for the weak and miſchievous policy of inviting <note n="128" place="bottom">This <hi>invitation,</hi> which may derive ſome countenance from the looſe expreſſions of Gildas and Bede, is framed into a regular ſtory by Witikind, a Saxon monk of the tenth century (ſee Couſin, Hiſt. de l'Empire d'Occident, tom. ii. p. 356.). Rapin, and even Hume, have too freely uſed this ſuſpicious evidence, without regarding the preciſe and probable teſtimony of Nennius: Interea venerunt tres Chiulae a Germaniâ <hi>in exilio pulſae,</hi> in quibus erant Hors et Hengiſt.</note> a formidable ſtranger, to repel the vexatious inroads of a domeſtic foe. His am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors are diſpatched, by the graveſt hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, to the coaſt of Germany; they addreſs a pathetic oration to the general aſſembly of the Saxons, and thoſe warlike Barbarians reſolve to aſſiſt with a fleet and army the ſuppliants of a diſtant and unknown iſland. If Britain had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed been unknown to the Saxons, the meaſure of its calamities would have been leſs complete. But the ſtrength of the Roman government could not always guard the maritime province againſt the pirates of Germany: the independent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſtates were expoſed to their attacks; and the Saxons might ſometimes join the Scots and the Picts, in a tacit, or expreſs, confederacy of rapine and deſtruction. Vortigern could only balance the various perils, which aſſaulted on every ſide his throne and his people; and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy may deſerve either praiſe or excuſe, if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the alliance of <hi>thoſe</hi> Barbarians, whoſe naval
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0034700106:391"/>
power rendered them the moſt dangerous enemies, and the moſt ſerviceable allies. Hengiſt and Horſa, as they ranged along the Eaſtern coaſt with three ſhips, were engaged, by the promiſe of an ample ſtipend, to embrace the defence of Britain; and their intrepid valour ſoon delivered the country from the Caledonian invaders. The iſle of Thanet, a ſecure and fertile diſtrict, was allotted for the reſidence of theſe German auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries, and they were ſupplied, according to the treaty, with a plentiful allowance of clothing and proviſions. This favourable reception encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged five thouſand warriors to embark with their families in ſeventeen veſſels, and the infant power of Hengiſt was fortified by this ſtrong and ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reinforcement. The crafty Barbarian ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to Vortigern the obvious advantage of fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the neighbourhood of the Picts, a colony of faithful allies: a third fleet of forty ſhips, under the command of his ſon and nephew, ſailed from Germany, ravaged the Orkneys, and diſembarked a new army on the coaſt of Northumberland, or Lothian, at the oppoſite extremity of the devoted land. It was eaſy to foreſee, but it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to prevent, the impending evils. The two nations were ſoon divided and exaſperated by mutual jealouſies. The Saxons magnified all that they had done and ſuffered in the cauſe of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful people; while the Britons regretted the liberal rewards which could not ſatisfy the avarice of thoſe haughty mercenaries. The cauſes of fear and hatred were inflamed into an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable quarrel. The Saxons flew to arms; and,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0034700106:392"/>
if they perpetrated a treacherous maſſacre during the ſecurity of a feaſt, the deſtroyed the recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal confidence which ſuſtains the intercourſe of peace and war <note n="129" place="bottom">Nennius imputes to the Saxons the murder of three hundred Britiſh chiefs; a crime not unſuitable to their ſavage manners. But we are not obliged to believe (ſee Jeffrey of Monmouth, l. viii. c. 9—12.), that Stonehenge is their monument, which the giants had formerly tranſported from Africa to Ireland, and which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to Britain by the order of Ambroſius, and the art of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</note>.</p>
            <p>Hengiſt, who boldly aſpired to the conqueſt of <note place="margin">Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Saxon heptarchy, A. D. 455—582.</note> Britain, exhorted his countrymen to embrace the glorious opportunity: he painted in lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours the fertility of the ſoil, the wealth of the cities, the puſillanimous temper of the natives, and the convenient ſituation of a ſpacious ſolitary iſland, acceſſible on all ſides to the Saxon fleets. The ſucceſſive colonies which iſſued, in the period of a century, from the mouths of the Elbe, the Weſer, and the Rhine, were principally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of three valiant tribes or nations of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many; the <hi>Jutes,</hi> the <hi>old Saxons,</hi> and the <hi>Angles.</hi> The Jutes, who fought under the peculiar banner of Hengiſt, aſſumed the merit of leading their countrymen in the paths of glory, and of erecting, in Kent, the firſt independent kingdom. The fame of the enterpriſe was attributed to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Saxons; and the common laws and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the conquerors are deſcribed by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional appellation of a people, which, at the end of four hundred years, produced the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of South Britain. The Angles were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by their numbers and their ſucceſs;
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0034700106:393"/>
and they claimed the honour of fixing a perpetual name on the country, of which they occupied the moſt ample portion. The Barbarians, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the hopes of rapine either on the land or ſea, were inſenſibly blended with this triple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy; the <hi>Friſians,</hi> who had been tempted by their vicinity to the Britiſh ſhores, might balance, during a ſhort ſpace, the ſtrength and reputation of the native Saxons; the <hi>Danes,</hi> the <hi>Pruſſians,</hi> the <hi>Rugians</hi> are faintly deſcribed; and ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous <hi>Huns,</hi> who had wandered as far as the Baltic, might embark on board the German veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, for the conqueſt of a new world <note n="130" place="bottom">All theſe tribes are expreſsly enumerated by Bede (l. i. c. 15. p. 52. l. v. c. 9. p. 190.), and though I have conſidered Mr. Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aker's remarks (Hiſt. of Mancheſter, vol. ii. p. 538—543.), I do not perceive the abſurdity of ſuppoſing that the Friſians, &amp;c. were mingled with the Anglo-Saxons.</note>. But this arduous atchievement was not prepared or executed by the union of national powers. Each intrepid chieftain, according to the meaſure of his fame and fortunes, aſſembled his followers; equipped a fleet of three, or perhaps of ſixty, veſſels; choſe the place of the attack; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted his ſubſequent operations according to the events of the war and the dictates of his private intereſt. In the invaſion of Britain many heroes vanquiſhed and fell; but only ſeven victorious leaders aſſumed, or at leaſt maintained, the title of kings. Seven independent thrones, the Saxon Heptarchy, were founded by the conquerors, and ſeven families, one of which has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, by female ſucceſſion, to our preſent ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, derived their equal and ſacred lineage from
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0034700106:394"/>
Woden, the god of war. It has been pretended, that this republic of kings was moderated by a general council and a ſupreme magiſtrate. But ſuch an artificial ſcheme of policy is repugnant to the rude and turbulent ſpirit of the Saxons: their laws are ſilent; and their imperfect annals afford only a dark and bloody proſpect of inteſtine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord <note n="131" place="bottom">Bede has enumerated ſeven kings, two Saxons, a Jute, and four Angles, who ſucceſſively acquired in the heptarchy an indefinite ſupremacy of power and renown. But their reign was the effect, not of law, but of conqueſt; and he obſerves, in ſimilar terms, that one of them ſubdued the Iſles of Man and Angleſey; and that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other impoſed a tribute on the Scots and Picts (Hiſt.

            <p>A monk, who, in the profound ignorance of <note place="margin">State of the Britons.</note> human life, has preſumed to exerciſe the office of hiſtorian, ſtrangely disfigures the ſtate of Britain at the time of its ſeparation from the Weſtern em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Gildas <note n="132" place="bottom">See Gildas de Excidio Britanniae, c. i. p. 1. edit.

Under the long dominion of the emperors, Britain
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0034700106:395"/>
had been inſenſibly moulded into the elegant and ſervile form of a Roman province, whoſe ſafety was entruſted to a foreign power. The ſubjects of Honorius contemplated their new freedom with ſurpriſe and terror; they were left deſtitute of any civil or military conſtitution; and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain rulers wanted either ſkill, or courage, or authority, to direct the public force againſt the common enemy. The introduction of the Saxons betrayed their internal weakneſs, and degraded the character both of the prince and people. Their conſternation magnified the danger; the want of union diminiſhed their reſources; and the madneſs of civil factions was more ſolicitous to accuſe, than to remedy, the evils, which they imputed to the miſconduct of their adverſaries. Yet the Britons were not ignorant, they could not be ignorant, of the manufacture or the uſe of arms: the ſucceſſive and diſorderly attacks of the Saxons, allowed them to recover from their amazement, and the proſperous or adverſe events of the war added diſcipline and experience to their native valour.</p>
            <p>While the continent of Europe and Africa <note place="margin">Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,</note> yielded, without reſiſtance, to the Barbarians, the Britiſh iſland, alone and unaided, maintained a long, a vigorous, though an unſucceſsful ſtruggle, againſt the formidable pirates, who, almoſt at the ſame inſtant, aſſaulted the Northern, the Eaſtern, and the Southern coaſts. The cities which had been fortified with ſkill, were defended with reſolution; the advantages of ground, hills,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0034700106:396"/>
foreſts, and moraſſes, were diligently improved by the inhabitants; the conqueſt of each diſtrict was purchaſed with blood; and the defeats of the Saxons are ſtrongly atteſted by the diſcreet ſilence of their annaliſt. Hengiſt might hope to atchieve the conqueſt of Britain; but his ambition, in an active reign of thirty-five years, was confined to the poſſeſſion of Kent; and the numerous colony which he had planted in the North, was extirpated by the ſword of the Britons. The monarchy of the Weſt-Saxons was laboriouſly founded by the perſevering efforts of three martial generations. The life of Cerdic, one of the braveſt of the children of Woden, was conſumed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Hampſhire, and the iſle of Wight; and the loſs which he ſuſtained in the battle of Mount Badon, reduced him to a ſtate of inglorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Kenric, his valiant ſon, advanced into Wiltſhire; beſieged Saliſbury, at that time ſeated on a commanding eminence; and vanquiſhed an army which advanced to the relief of the city. In the ſubſequent battle of Marlborough <note n="134" place="bottom">At Beran-birig, or Barbury-caſtle, near Marlborough. The Saxon chronicle aſſigns the name and date. Cambden (Britannia, vol. i. p. 128.) aſcertains the place; and Henry of Huntingdon (Scriptores poſt Bedam, p. 314.) relates the circumſtances of this battle. They are probable and characteriſtic; and the hiſtorians of the twelfth century might conſult ſome materials that no longer exiſt.</note>, his Britiſh enemies diſplayed their military ſcience. Their troops were formed in three lines; each line conſiſted of three diſtinct bodies, and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, the archers, and the pikemen, were diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0034700106:397"/>
according to the principles of Roman tac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics. The Saxons charged in one weighty co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, boldly encountered with their ſhort ſwords the long lances of the Britons, and maintained an equal conflict till the approach of night. Two deciſive victories, the death of three Britiſh kings, and the reduction of Cirenceſter, Bath, and Glouceſter, eſtabliſhed the fame and power of Ceaulin, the grandſon of Cerdic, who carried his victorious arms to the banks of the Severn.</p>
            <p>After a war of an hundred years, the independent <note place="margin">and flight.</note> Britons ſtill occupied the whole extent of the Weſtern coaſt, from the wall of Antoninus to the extreme promontory of Cornwall; and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cities of the inland country ſtill oppoſed the arms of the Barbarians. Reſiſtance became more languid, as the number and boldneſs of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailants continually increaſed. Winning their way by ſlow and painful efforts, the Saxons, the Angles, and their various confederates, advanced from the North, from the Eaſt, and from the South, till their victorious banners were united in the centre of the iſland. Beyond the Severn the Britons ſtill aſſerted their national freedom, which ſurvived the heptarchy, and even the monarchy, of the Saxons. The braveſt warriors, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred exile to ſlavery, found a ſecure refuge in the mountains of Wales: the reluctant ſubmiſſion of Cornwall was delayed for ſome ages <note n="135" place="bottom">Cornwall was finally ſubdued by Athelſtan (A.

The ſpirit of the Corniſh knights was degraded by ſervitude; and it ſhould ſeem, from the Romance of Sir Triſtram, that their cowardice was almoſt proverbial.</note>; and a

Beyond that aera, the Britons of Armorica can be found only in romance; and I am ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized that Mr. Whitaker (Genuine Hiſtory of the Britons, p. 214—221.) ſhould ſo faithfully tranſcribe the groſs ignorance of Carte, whoſe venial errors he has ſo rigorouſly chaſtiſed.</note>.

In a century of perpetual, or at leaſt impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, war, much courage, and ſome ſkill, muſt have been exerted for the defence of Britain. Yet <note place="margin">The fame of Arthur.</note> if the memory of its champions is almoſt buried in oblivion, we need not repine; ſince every age, however deſtitute of ſcience or virtue, ſufficiently abounds with acts of blood and military renown. The tomb of Vortimer, the ſon of Vortigern, was erected on the margin of the ſea-ſhore, as a landmark formidable to the Saxons, whom he had thrice vanquiſhed in the fields of Kent. Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius Aurelian was deſcended from a noble family of Romans <note n="138" place="bottom">Bede, who in his chronicle (p. 28.) places Ambroſius under the reign of Zeno (A. D. 474—491.), obſerves, that his parents had been "purpurâ induti;" which he explains, in his eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, by "regium nomen et inſigne ferentibus" (l. i. c. 16. p. 53.). The expreſſion of Nennius (c. 44. p. 110. edit. Gale) is ſtill more ſingular, "Unus de <hi>conſulibus</hi> gentis Romanicae eſt pater meus."</note>; his modeſty was equal to his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and his valour, till the laſt fatal action <note n="139" place="bottom">By the unanimous, though doubtful, conjecture of our anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarians, Ambroſius is confounded with Natanleod, who (A.

But every Britiſh name is effaced by the illuſtrious name of ARTHUR <note n="140" place="bottom">As I am a ſtranger to the Welſh bards Myrdhin, Llomarch, and Talieſſin, my faith in the exiſtence and exploits of Arthur, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally reſts on the ſimple and circumſtantial teſtimony of Nennius (Hiſt.

Mr. Whitaker (Hiſt. of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, vol. ii. p. 31—71.) has framed an intereſting, and even probable, narrative of the wars of Arthur: though it is impoſſible to allow the reality of the round table.</note>, the hereditary prince of the Silures, in South Wales, and the elective king or general of the nation. According to the moſt rational ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0034700106:400"/>
he defeated, in twelve ſucceſſive battles, the Angles of the North, and the Saxons of the Weſt; but the declining age of the hero was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered by popular ingratitude, and domeſtic miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. The events of his life are leſs intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than the ſingular revolutions of his fame. During a period of five hundred years the tradition of his exploits was preſerved, and rudely embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, by the obſcure bards of Wales and Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, who were odious to the Saxons, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the reſt of mankind. The pride and curioſity of the Norman conquerors, prompted them to enquire into the ancient hiſtory of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: they liſtened with fond credulity to the tale of Arthur, and eagerly applauded the merit of a prince, who had triumphed over the Saxons, their common enemies. His romance, tranſcribed in the Latin of Jeffrey of Monmouth, and afterwards tranſlated into the faſhionable idiom of the times, was enriched with the various, though incoherent, ornaments, which were familiar to the experience, the learning, or the fancy, of the twelfth century. The progreſs of a Phrygian colony, from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to the Thames, was eaſily engrafted on the fable of the Aeneid; and the royal anceſtors of Arthur derived their origin from Troy, and claimed their alliance with the Caeſars. His tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies were decorated with captive provinces, and Imperial titles; and his Daniſh victories avenged the recent injuries of his country. The gallantry and ſuperſtition of the Britiſh hero, his feaſts and tournaments, and the memorable inſtitution of
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0034700106:401"/>
his Knights of the <hi>Round Table,</hi> were faithfully copied from the reigning manners of chivalry; and the fabulous exploits of Uther's ſon, appear leſs incredible, than the adventures which were atchieved by the enterpriſing valour of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. Pilgrimage, and the holy wars, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into Europe the ſpecious miracles of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian magic. Fairies, and giants, flying dragons, and enchanted palaces, were blended with the more ſimple ſictions of the Weſt; and the fate of Britain depended on the art, or the predictions, of Merlin. Every nation embraced and adorned the popular romance of Arthur, and the Knights of the Round Table: their names were celebrated in Greece and Italy; and the voluminous tales of Sir Lancelot and Sir Triſtram were devoutly ſtudied by the princes and nobles, who diſregarded the genuine heroes and hiſtorians of antiquity. At length the light of ſcience and reaſon was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled; the taliſman was broken; the viſionary fabric melted into air; and by a natural, though unjuſt, reverſe of the public opinion, the ſeverity of the preſent age is inclined to queſtion the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence</hi> of Arthur <note n="140" place="bottom">The progreſs of romance, and the ſtate of learning, in the middle ages, are illuſtrated by Mr. Thomas Wharton, with the taſte of a poet, and the minute diligence of an antiquarian.

The fields of battle might be traced, almoſt in every diſtrict, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of bones; the fragments of falling towers were ſtained with blood; the laſt of the Britons, without diſtinction of age or ſex, was maſſacred <note n="141" place="bottom">Hoc anno (490) Aella et Ciſſa obſederunt Andredes-Ceaſter; et interfecerunt omnes qui id incoluerunt; adeo ut ne unus Brito ibi ſuperſtes fuerit (Chron.

The arts and religion, the laws and language, which the Romans had ſo carefully planted in Britain, were extirpated by their barbarous ſucceſſors. After the deſtruction of the principal churches, the biſhops, who had declined the crown of martyrdom, retired with the holy relics into Wales and Armorica; the remains of their flocks were left deſtitute of any ſpiritual food; the practice, and even the remembrance, of Chriſtianity were aboliſhed; and the Britiſh clergy might obtain ſome comfort from the damnation of the idolatrous ſtrangers. The kings of France maintained the privileges of their Roman ſubjects; but the ferocious Saxons trampled on the laws of Rome, and of the emperors. The proceedings

of civil and criminal juriſdiction, the titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the forms of office, the ranks of ſociety, and even the domeſtic rights of marriage, teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and inheritance, were finally ſuppreſſed; and the indiſcriminate crowd of noble and plebeian ſlaves was governed by the traditionary cuſtoms, which had been coarſely framed for the ſhepherds, and pirates of Germany. The language of ſcience, of buſineſs, and of converſation, which had been introduced by the Romans, was loſt in the general deſolation.

His ſiſter Theudechildis retired to Sens, where ſhe founded monaſteries, and diſtributed alms (ſee the notes of the Benedictine editors, in tom. ii. p. 216.). If we may credit the praiſes of Fortunatus (l. vi. carm. 5. in tom. ii. p. 507.), Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diger was deprived of a moſt valuable wife.</note>. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken princeſs of the Angles, inſtead of bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, revenged her diſgrace. Her warlike ſubjects are <hi>ſaid</hi> to have been ignorant of the uſe, and even of the form, of an horſe; but ſhe boldly ſailed from Britain to the mouth of the Rhine, with a fleet of four hundred ſhips, and an army of one hundred thouſand men. After the loſs of a battle, the captive Radiger implored the mercy of his victorious bride, who generouſly pardoned his offence, diſmiſſed her rival, and compelled the king of the Varni to diſcharge with honour and fidelity the duties of an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <note n="163" place="bottom">Perhaps ſhe was the ſiſter of one of the princes or chiefs of the Angles, who landed in 527, and the following years, between the Humber and the Thames, and gradually founded the kingdoms of Eaſt Anglia and Mercia. The Engliſh writers are ignorant of her name and exiſtence: but Procopius may have ſuggeſted to Mr. Rowe the character and ſituation of Rodugune in the tragedy of the Royal Convert.</note> This gallant exploit appears to be the

The arts of navigation, by which they had acquired the empire of Britain and of the ſea, were ſoon neglected by the indolent Barbarians, who ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinely renounced all the commercial advantages of their inſular ſituation. Seven independent kingdoms were agitated by perpetual diſcord; and the <hi>Britiſh world</hi> was ſeldom connected, either in peace or war, with the nations of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent <note n="164" place="bottom">In the copious hiſtory of Gregory of Tours, we cannot find any traces of hoſtile or friendly intercourſe between France and England, except in the marriage of the daughter of Caribert king of Paris, quam regis <hi>cujuſdam</hi> in Cantia filius matrimonio copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit (l. ix. c. 26. in tom. ii. p. 348.).

At that unhappy period, the Saxons fiercely ſtruggled with the natives for the poſſeſſion of Britain: Gaul and Spain were divided between the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful monarchies of the Franks and Viſigoths, and the dependent kingdoms of the Suevi and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundians: Africa was expoſed to the cruel perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Vandals, and the ſavage inſults of the Moors: Rome and Italy, as far as the banks

All the ſubjects of the empire, who, by the uſe of the Latin language, more particularly deſerved the name and privileges of Romans, were oppreſſed by the diſgrace and calamities of foreign conqueſt; and the victorious nations of Germany eſtabliſhed a new ſyſtem of manners and government in the weſtern countries of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.

            <p>THE Greeks, after their country had been reduced into a province, imputed the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of Rome, not to the merit, but to the FORTUNE, of the republic. The inconſtant god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, who ſo blindly diſtributes and reſumes her favours, had <hi>now</hi> conſented (ſuch was the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of envious flattery) to reſign her wings, to deſcend from her globe, and to fix her firm and immutable throne on the banks of the Tyber <note n="1" place="bottom">Such are the figurative expreſſions of Plutarch (Opera, tom. ii. p. 318. edit.

The ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions had prevailed among the Greeks two hundred and fifty years before Plutarch; and to confute them, is the profeſſed intention of Polybius (Hiſt. l. i. p. 90. edit. Gronov. Amſtel. 1670.).</note>. A wiſer Greek, who has compoſed, with a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophic ſpirit, the memorable hiſtory of his own times, deprived his countrymen of this vain and deluſive comfort, by opening to their view the deep foundations of the greatneſs of Rome <note n="2" place="bottom">See the ineſtimable remains of the ſixth book of Polybius, and many other parts of his general hiſtory, particularly a digreſſion in the ſeventeenth book, in which he compares the phalanx and the legion.</note>. The fidelity of the citizens to each other, and to the ſtate, was confirmed by the habits of education, and the prejudices of religion. Honour, as well as virtue, was the principle of the republic; the ambitious citizens laboured to deſerve the ſolemn
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0034700106:415"/>
glories of a triumph; and the ardour of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man youth was kindled into active emulation, as often as they beheld the domeſtic images of their anceſtors <note n="3" place="bottom">Salluſt, de Bell. Jugurthin. c. 4. Such were the generous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of P. Scipio and Q. Maximus. The Latin hiſtorian had read, and moſt probably tranſcribes, Polybius, their contemporary and friend.</note>. The temperate ſtruggles of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians and plebeians had finally eſtabliſhed the firm and equal balance of the conſtitution; which united the freedom of popular aſſemblies, with the authority and wiſdom of a ſenate, and the executive powers of a regal magiſtrate. When the conſul diſplayed the ſtandard of the republic, each citizen bound himſelf, by the obligation of an oath, to draw his ſword in the cauſe of his country, till he had diſcharged the ſacred duty by a military ſervice of ten years. This wiſe inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution continually poured into the field the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing generations of freemen and ſoldiers; and their numbers were reinforced by the warlike and populous ſtates of Italy, who, after a brave reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, had yielded to the valour, and embraced the alliance, of the Romans. The ſage hiſtorian, who excited the virtue of the younger Scipio, and beheld the ruin of Carthage <note n="4" place="bottom">While Carthage was in flames, Scipio repeated two lines of the Iliad, which expreſs the deſtruction of Troy, acknowledging to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius, his friend and preceptor (Polyb. in Excerpt. de Virtut. et Vit. tom. ii. p. 1455—1465). that while he recollected the viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of human affairs, he inwardly applied them to the future cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of Rome (Appian. in Libycis, p. 136. edit.

and the invincible legion, ſuperior in active ſtrength to the Macedonian phalanx of Philip and Alexander. From theſe inſtitutions of peace and war, Polybius has deduced the ſpirit and ſucceſs of a people, incapable of fear, and impatient of repoſe. The ambitious deſign of conqueſt, which might have been defeated by the ſeaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of mankind, was attempted and atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the perpetual violation of juſtice was maintained by the political virtues of prudence and courage. The arms of the republic, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vanquiſhed in battle, always victorious in war, advanced with rapid ſteps to the Euphrates, the Danube, the Rhine, and the Ocean; and the images of gold, or ſilver, or braſs, that might ſerve to repreſent the nations and their kings, were ſucceſſively broken by the <hi>iron</hi> monarchy of Rome <note n="5" place="bottom">See Daniel ii. 31—40. <q rend="inline">"And the fourth kingdom ſhall be ſtrong as <hi>iron;</hi> foraſmuch as iron breaketh in pieces, and ſubdueth all things."</q> The remainder of the prophecy (the mixture of iron and <hi>clay)</hi> was accompliſhed, according to St. Jerom, in his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The riſe of a city, which ſwelled into an empire, may deſerve, as a ſingular prodigy, the reflection of a philoſophic mind. But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatneſs. Proſperity ripened the principle of decay; the cauſes of deſtruction multiplied with the extent of conqueſt; and as ſoon as time or accident had removed the artificial
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0034700106:417"/>
ſupports, the ſtupendous fabric yielded to the preſſure of its own weight. The ſtory of its ruin is ſimple and obvious; and inſtead of enquiring <hi>why</hi> the Roman empire was deſtroyed, we ſhould rather be ſurpriſed that it had ſubſiſted ſo long. The victorious legions, who, in diſtant wars, acquired the vices of ſtrangers and mercenaries, firſt oppreſſed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majeſty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their perſonal ſafety and the public peace, were reduced to the baſe expedient of corrupting the diſcipline which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them alike formidable to their ſovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military government was relaxed, and finally diſſolved, by the partial inſtitutions of Conſtantine; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.</p>
            <p>The decay of Rome has been frequently aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the tranſlation of the ſeat of empire; but this hiſtory has already ſhewn, that the powers of government were <hi>divided,</hi> rather than <hi>removed.</hi> The throne of Conſtantinople was erected in the Eaſt; while the Weſt was ſtill poſſeſſed by a ſeries of emperors who held their reſidence in Italy, and claimed their equal inheritance of the legions and provinces. This dangerous novelty impaired the ſtrength, and fomented the vices, of a double reign: the inſtruments of an oppreſſive and arbitrary ſyſtem were multiplied; and a vain emulation of luxury, not of merit, was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and ſupported between the degenerate
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0034700106:418"/>
ſucceſſors of Theodoſius. Extreme diſtreſs, which unites the virtue of a free people, embitters the factions of a declining monarchy. The hoſtile favourites of Arcadius and Honorius betrayed the republic to its common enemies; and the Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine court beheld with indifference, perhaps with pleaſure, the diſgrace of Rome, the misfortunes of Italy, and the loſs of the Weſt. Under the ſucceeding reigns, the alliance of the two empires was reſtored; but the aid of the Oriental Romans was tardy, doubtful, and ineffectual; and the national ſchiſm of the Greeks and Latins was enlarged by the perpetual difference of language and manners, of intereſt, and even of religion. Yet the ſalutary event approved in ſome meaſure the judgment of Conſtantine. During a long period of decay, his impregnable city repelled the victorious armies of Barbarians, protected the wealth of Aſia, and commanded, both in peace and war, the important ſtreights which connect the Euxine and Mediterranean ſeas. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Conſtantinople more eſſentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the preſervation of the Eaſt, than to the ruin of the Weſt.</p>
            <p>As the happineſs of a <hi>future</hi> life is the great object of religion, we may hear without ſurpriſe or ſcandal, that the introduction, or at leaſt the abuſe, of Chriſtianity, had ſome influence on the decline and fall of the Roman empire. The clergy ſucceſsfully preached the doctrines of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and puſillanimity; the active virtues of ſociety were diſcouraged; and the laſt remains
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0034700106:419"/>
of military ſpirit were buried in the cloyſter: a large portion of public and private wealth was conſecrated to the ſpecious demands of charity and devotion; and the ſoldiers pay was laviſhed on the uſeleſs multitudes of both ſexes, who could only plead the merits of abſtinence and chaſtity. Faith, zeal, curioſity, and the more earthly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of malice and ambition, kindled the flame of theological diſcord; the church, and even the ſtate, were diſtracted by religious factions, whoſe conflicts were ſometimes bloody, and always implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted from camps to ſynods; the Roman world was oppreſſed by a new ſpecies of tyranny; and the perſecuted ſects became the ſecret enemies of their country. Yet party-ſpirit, however per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious or abſurd, is a principle of union as well as of diſſention. The biſhops, from eighteen hundred pulpits, inculcated the duty of paſſive obedience to a lawful and orthodox ſovereign; their frequent aſſemblies, and perpetual corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, maintained the communion of diſtant churches; and the benevolent temper of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was ſtrengthened, though confined, by the ſpiritual alliance of the Catholics. The ſacred indolence of the monks was devoutly embraced by a ſervile and effeminate age; but if ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had not afforded a decent retreat, the ſame vices would have tempted the unworthy Romans to deſert, from baſer motives, the ſtandard of the republic. Religious precepts are eaſily obeyed, which indulge and ſanctify the natural inclinations
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0034700106:420"/>
of their votaries; but the pure and genuine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſtianity may be traced in its beneficial, though imperfect, effects on the Barbarian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes of the North. If the decline of the Roman empire was haſtened by the converſion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine, his victorious religion broke the violence of the fall, and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors.</p>
            <p>This awful revolution may be uſefully applied to the inſtruction of the preſent age. It is the duty of a patriot to prefer and promote the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive intereſt and glory of his native country: but a philoſopher may be permitted to enlarge his views, and to conſider Europe as one great republic, whoſe various inhabitants have attained almoſt the ſame level of politeneſs and cultivation. The balance of power will continue to fluctuate, and the proſperity of our own, or the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kingdoms, may be alternately exalted or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; but theſe partial events cannot eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially injure our general ſtate of happineſs, the ſyſtem of arts, and laws, and manners, which ſo advantageouſly diſtinguiſh, above the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the Europeans and their colonies. The ſavage nations of the globe are the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of civiliſed ſociety; and we may inquire with anxious curioſity, whether Europe is ſtill threatened with a repetition of thoſe calamities, which formerly oppreſſed the arms and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Rome. Perhaps the ſame reflections will illuſtrate the fall of that mighty empire, and explain the probable cauſes of our actual ſecurity.</p>

I. The Romans were ignorant of the extent of their danger, and the number of their enemies. Beyond the Rhine and Danube, the northern countries of Europe and Aſia were filled with innumerable tribes of hunters and ſhepherds, poor, voracious, and turbulent; bold in arms, and impatient to raviſh the fruits of induſtry. The Barbarian world was agitated by the rapid impulſe of war; and the peace of Gaul or Italy was ſhaken by the diſtant revolutions of China. The Huns, who fled before a victorious enemy, directed their march towards the Weſt; and the torrent was ſwelled by the gradual acceſſion of captives and allies. The flying tribes who yielded to the Huns, aſſumed in <hi>their</hi> turn the ſpirit of conqueſt; the endleſs column of Barbarians preſſed on the Roman empire with accumulated weight; and, if the foremoſt were deſtroyed, the vacant ſpace was inſtantly repleniſhed by new aſſailants. Such formidable emigrations can no longer iſſue from the North; and the long repoſe, which has been imputed to the decreaſe of population, is the happy conſequence of the progreſs of arts and agriculture. Inſtead of ſome rude villages, thinly ſcattered among its woods and moraſſes, Germany now produces a liſt of two thouſand three hundred walled towns: the Chriſtian kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, and Poland have been ſucceſſively eſtabliſhed; and the Hanſe merchants, with the Teutonic knights, have extended their colonies along the coaſt of the Baltic, as far as the Gulf of Finland. From
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0034700106:422"/>
the Gulf of Finland to the Eaſtern Ocean, Ruſſia now aſſumes the form of a powerful and civiliſed empire. The plough, the loom, and the forge are introduced on the banks of the Volga, the Oby, and the Lena; and the fierceſt of the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar hords have been taught to tremble and obey. The reign of independent Barbariſm is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to a narrow ſpan; and the remnant of Calmucks or Uzbecks, whoſe forces may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt numbered, cannot ſeriouſly excite the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the great republic of Europe <note n="6" place="bottom">The French and Engliſh editors of the Genealogical Hiſtory of the Tartars have ſubjoined a curious, though imperfect, deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their preſent ſtate. We might queſtion the independence of the Calmucks, or Eluths, ſince they have been recently vanquiſhed by the Chineſe, who, in the year 1759, ſubdued the leſſer Bucharia, and advanced into the country of Badakſhan, near the ſources of the Oxus (Memoires ſur les Chinois, tom. i. p. 325—400.). But theſe conqueſts are precarious, nor will I venture to enſure the ſafety of the Chineſe empire.</note>. Yet this apparent ſecurity ſhould not tempt us to forget that new enemies, and unknown dangers, may <hi>poſſibly</hi> ariſe from ſome obſcure people, ſcarcely viſible in the map of the world. The Arabs or Saracens, who ſpread their conqueſts from India to Sapin, had languiſhed in poverty and contempt, till Mahomet breathed into thoſe ſavage bodies the ſoul of enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The empire of Rome was firmly eſtabliſhed by the ſingular and perfect coalition of its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The ſubject nations, reſigning the hope, and even the wiſh, of independence, embraced the character of Roman citizens; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Weſt were reluctantly torn by the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0034700106:423" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Barbarians from the boſom of their mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>country <note n="7" place="bottom">The prudent reader will determine how far this general propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is weakened by the revolt of the Iſaurians, the independence of Britain and Armorica, the Mooriſh tribes, or the Bagaudae of Gaul and Spain (vol. i. p. 240. vol. iii. p. 273. 337. 434.).</note>. But this union was purchaſed by the loſs of national freedom and military ſpirit; and the ſervile provinces, deſtitute of life and motion, expected their ſafety from the mercenary troops and governors, who were directed by the orders of a diſtant court. The happineſs of an hundred millions depended on the perſonal merit of one, or two, men, perhaps children, whoſe minds were corrupted by education, luxury, and deſpotic power. The deepeſt wounds were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the empire during the minorities of the ſons and grandſons of Theodoſius; and after thoſe incapable princes ſeemed to attain the age of manhood, they abandoned the church to the biſhops, the ſtate to the eunuchs, and the provinces to the Barbarians. Europe is now divided into twelve powerful, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, kingdoms, three reſpectable common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, and a variety of ſmaller, though inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, ſtates: the chances of royal and miniſterial talents are multiplied, at leaſt, with the number of its rulers; and a Julian, or Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis, may reign in the North, while Arcadius and Honorius again ſlumber on the thrones of the South. The abuſes of tyranny are reſtrained by the mutual influence of fear and ſhame; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics have acquired order and ſtability; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies have imbibed the principles of freedom,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:0034700106:424"/>
or, at leaſt, of moderation; and ſome ſenſe of honour and juſtice is introduced into the moſt defective conſtitutions by the general manners of the times. In peace, the progreſs of knowledge and induſtry is accelerated by the emulation of ſo many active rivals: in war, the European forces are exerciſed by temperate and undeciſive conteſts. If a ſavage conqueror ſhould iſſue from the deſerts of Tartary, he muſt repeatedly van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the robuſt peaſants of Ruſſia, the numerous armies of Germany, the gallant nobles of France, and the intrepid freemen of Britain; who, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, might confederate for their common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Should the victorious Barbarians carry ſlavery and deſolation as far as the Atlantic Ocean, ten thouſand veſſels would tranſport be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their purſuit the remains of civiliſed ſociety; and Europe would revive and flouriſh in the American world, which is already filled with her colonies, and inſtitutions <note n="8" place="bottom">America now contains about ſix millions of European blood and deſcent; and their numbers, at leaſt in the North, are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually increaſing. Whatever may be the changes of their political ſituation, they muſt preſerve the manners of Europe; and we may reflect with ſome pleaſure, that the Engliſh language will probably be diffuſed over an immenſe and populous continent.</note>.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Cold, poverty, and a life of danger and fatigue, fortify the ſtrength and courage of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians. In every age they have oppreſſed the polite and peaceful nations of China, India, and Perſia, who neglected, and ſtill neglect, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbalance theſe natural powers by the reſources of military art. The warlike ſtates of antiquity,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:0034700106:425"/>
Greece, Macedonia, and Rome, educated a race of ſoldiers; exerciſed their bodies, diſciplined their courage, multiplied their forces by regular evolutions, and converted the iron, which they poſſeſſed, into ſtrong and ſerviceable weapons. But this ſuperiority inſenſibly declined with their laws and manners; and the feeble policy of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine and his ſucceſſors armed and inſtructed, for the ruin of the empire, the rude valour of the Barbarian mercenaries. The military art has been changed by the invention of gunpowder; which enables man to command the two moſt powerful agents of nature, air and fire. Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics, chymiſtry, mechanics, architecture, have been applied to the ſervice of war; and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe parties oppoſe to each other the moſt ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate modes of attack and of defence. Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians may indignantly obſerve, that the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a ſiege would found and maintain a flouriſhing colony <note n="9" place="bottom">On avoit fait venir (for the ſiege of Turin) 140 pieces de canon; et il eſt à remarquer que chaque gros canon monté revient à environ 2000 ecus: il y avoit 110,000 boulets; 106,000 cartouches d'une façon, et 300,000 d'une autre; 21,000 bombes; 27,700 gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades, 15,000 facs à terre, 30,000 inſtrumens pour le pionnage; 1,200,000 livres de poudre. Ajoutez à ces munitions, le plomb, le fer, et le fer-blanc, les cordages, tout ce qui ſer. aux mineurs, le ſouphre, le ſalpêtre, les outils de toute eſpece. Il eſt certain que les frais de tous ces préparatiſs de deſtruction ſuffiroient pour fonder et pour faire fleurir la plus nombreuſe colonie. Voltaire, Siécle de Louis XIV. c. xx. in his Works, tom. xi. p. 391.</note>; yet we cannot be diſpleaſed, that the ſubverſion of a city ſhould be a work of coſt and difficulty; or that an induſtrious people ſhould be protected by thoſe arts, which ſurvive
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:0034700106:426"/>
and ſupply the decay of military virtue. Cannon and fortifications now form an impregnable bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier againſt the Tartar horſe; and Europe is ſecure from any future irruption of Barbarians; ſince, before they can conquer, they muſt ceaſe to be barbarous. Their gradual advances in the ſcience of war would always be accompanied, as we may learn from the example of Ruſſia, with a proportionable improvement in the arts of peace and civil policy; and they themſelves muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a place among the poliſhed nations whom they ſubdue.</p>
            <p>Should theſe ſpeculations be found doubtful or fallacious, there ſtill remains a more humble ſource of comfort and hope. The diſcoveries of ancient and modern navigators, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic hiſtory, or tradition, of the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened nations, repreſent the <hi>human ſavage,</hi> naked both in mind and body, and deſtitute of laws, of arts, of ideas, and almoſt of language <note n="10" place="bottom">It would be an eaſy, though tedious taſk, to produce the authorities of poets, philoſophers, and hiſtorians. I ſhall therefore content myſelf with appealing to the deciſive and authentic teſtimony of Diodorus Siculus (tom. i. l. i. p. 11, 12. l. iii. p. 184, &amp;c. edit. Weſſeling.). The Icthyophagi, who in his time wandered along the ſhores of the Red Sea, can only be compared to the natives of New Holland (Dampier's Voyages, vol. i. p. 464—469.). Fancy, or perhaps reaſon, may ſtill ſuppoſe an extreme and abſolute ſtate of nature far below the level of theſe ſavages, who had acquired ſome arts and inſtruments.</note>. From this abject condition, perhaps the primitive and univerſal ſtate of man, he has gradually ariſen to command the animals, to fertiliſe the earth, to traverſe the ocean, and to meaſure the

heavens. His progreſs in the improvement and exerciſe of his mental and corporeal faculties <note n="11" place="bottom">See the learned and rational work of the Preſident Goguet, de l'Origine des Loix, des Arts et des Sciences. He traces from facts, or conjectures (tom. i. p. 147—337, edit. 12mo.), the firſt and moſt difficult ſteps of human invention.</note> has been irregular and various; infinitely ſlow in the beginning, and increaſing by degrees with redoubled velocity: ages of laborious aſcent have been followed by a moment of rapid down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal; and the ſeveral climates of the globe have felt the viciſſitudes of light and darkneſs. Yet the experience of four thouſand years ſhould enlarge our hopes, and diminiſh our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: we cannot determine to what height the human ſpecies may aſpire in their advances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perfection; but it may ſafely be preſumed, that no people, unleſs the face of nature is changed, will relapſe into their original bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm. The improvements of ſociety may be viewed under a threefold aſpect. 1. The poet or philoſopher illuſtrates his age and country by the efforts of a <hi>ſingle</hi> mind; but theſe ſuperior powers of reaſon or fancy are rare and ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous productions; and the genius of Homer, or Cicero, or Newton, would excite leſs admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they could be created by the will of a prince, or the leſſons of a preceptor. 2. The benefits of law and policy, of trade and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, of arts and ſciences, are more ſolid and permanent; and <hi>many</hi> individuals may be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by education and diſcipline, to promote, in their reſpective ſtations, the intereſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0034700106:428"/>
But this general order is the effect of ſkill and labour; and the complex machinery may be decayed by time, or injured by violence. 3. Fortunately for mankind, the more uſeful, or, at leaſt, more neceſſary arts, can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without ſuperior talents, or national ſubordination; without the powers of <hi>one,</hi> or the union of <hi>many.</hi> Each village, each family, each individual, muſt always poſſeſs both ability and inclination, to perpetuate the uſe of fire <note n="12" place="bottom">It is certain, however ſtrange, that many nations have been ignorant of the uſe of fire. Even the ingenious natives of Otaheite, who are deſtitute of metals, have not invented any earthen veſſels capable of ſuſtaining the action of fire, and of communicating the heat to the liquids which they contain.</note> and of metals; the propagation and ſervice of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic animals; the methods of hunting and fiſhing; the rudiments of navigation; the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect cultivation of corn, or other nutritive grain; and the ſimple practice of the mechanic trades. Private genius and public induſtry may be extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated; but theſe hardy plants ſurvive the tempeſt, and ſtrike an everlaſting root into the moſt unfavourable ſoil. The ſplendid days of Auguſtus and Trajan were eclipſed by a cloud of ignorance; and the Barbarians ſubverted the laws and palaces of Rome. But the ſcythe, the invention or emblem of Saturn <note n="13" place="bottom">Plutarch. Quaeſt. Rom. in tom. ii. p. 275. Macrob. Saturnal. l. i. c. 8. p. 152. edit. London. The arrival of Saturn (of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip) in a ſhip, may indicate, that the ſavage coaſt of Latium was firſt diſcovered and civiliſed by the Phoenicians.</note>, ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued annually to mow the harveſts of Italy;
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:0034700106:429"/>
and the human feaſts of the Laeſtrigons <note n="14" place="bottom">In the ninth and tenth books of the Odyſſey, Homer has em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed the tales of fearful and credulous ſailors, who transformed the cannibals of Italy and Sicily into monſtrous giants.</note> have never been renewed on the coaſt of Campania.</p>
            <p>Since the firſt diſcovery of the arts, war, commerce, and religious zeal have diffuſed, among the ſavages of the Old and New World, theſe ineſtimable gifts: they have been ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively propagated; they can never be loſt. We may therefore acquieſce in the pleaſing conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that every age of the world has increaſed, and ſtill increaſes, the real wealth, the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the knowledge, and perhaps the virtue, of the human race <note n="15" place="bottom">The merit of diſcovery has too often been ſtained with avarice, cruelty, and fanaticiſm; and the intercourſe of nations has produced the communication of diſeaſe and prejudice. A ſingular exception is due to the virtue of our own times and country. The five great voyages ſucceſſively undertaken by the command of his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, were inſpired by the pure and generous love of ſcience and of mankind. The ſame prince, adapting his benefactions to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtages of ſociety, has founded a ſchool of painting in his capital; and has introduced into the iſlands of the South Sea, the vegetables and animals moſt uſeful to human life.</note>.</p>
