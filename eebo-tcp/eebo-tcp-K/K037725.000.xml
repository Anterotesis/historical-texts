            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>The author. Well, that's nothing very new.</l>

It is not yet ten months ſince I returned from India: my heart how light, my eve how cheerful, and my hand prompt at any commendable act. I could then be moved to joy, and ſorrow, and every ſympathiſing paſſion. Smiles and mock courteſy paſſed current on me, the word of man and woman was taken on truſt, and I lived in the ſunſhine of an open unſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul. But I am now otherwiſe taught. I am changed. My better part is brutalized; and the wrongs that lie rankling here have ſtripped me of human affections, and made me almoſt ſavage.</p>

                     <p>THE ancient ſceptics doubted of every thing, affirmed nothing, and kept the judgment always in ſuſpenſe: All things, ſaid they, are equally indifferent, uncertain, and indeterminate. The mind is never to aſſent to any thing; that it may never be aſtoniſhed, or diſturbed, but enjoy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0057603000:21"/>
a perfect calm. <stage>(Riſes with important wiſdom in his looks)</stage> Such were the maxims of Pyrrho, and his diſciples; thoſe renowned ſages of antiquity! Well! And ſuch too have been my maxims, practically. All my life have I been wavering, uncertain, and indeterminate! A ſagacious ſceptic without knowing it; and as it were by inſtinct! It was but lately I diſcovered what a wiſe man I am! And yet it ſeems to me as if I were ſcarcely half wiſe enough, for I am told that I am to doubt of every thing which I find rather difficult. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: that my wife Lady Vibrate is an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant rackety rantipole woman of faſhion, can I doubt that? No. That ſhe ſquanders my money, diſturbs my peace, and contradicts for contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction's ſake, can I doubt that? No. Then have I not a daughter to marry, a law ſuit to begin, and a thouſand perplexing affairs ſo that I do not know which way to turn? Why all this appears true to me: but the ſceptics teach that appearances deceive, and that nothing is certain. I may be Lord Vibrate, or I may be the Grand Turk. Theſe doctrines are prodigiouſly deep. <stage>(Conſiders)</stage> But I muſt think of ſomething elſe juſt now. I have a thouſand things to do, and know as little where to begin as where they will end. Ay! All is uncertainty! <stage>(Rings)</stage> Harry! Edward!</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
                     <p>Which way?</p>

                     <speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
                     <p>His character is too pliant. If others are merry, ſo is he: if they are ſad, he is the ſame. Their joys and ſorrows play upon his countenance: but, though they may ſlightly graze, they do not penetrate his heart. Even while he relieves, he ſcarcely feels them.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LADY V.</speaker>

                     <speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
                     <p>I grant he does his utmoſt. But it is a folly to be the ſlave even of an endeavour to pleaſe.</p>

                     <speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
                     <p>Ha, ha, ha! Upon my honor, you are a whimſical young lady! Afraid of marrying
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0057603000:41"/>
a man becauſe of his aſſiduous endeavours to pleaſe! As if that were a huſband's failing! You can prefer no ſuch accuſation againſt Mr. Delaval.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
                     <p>I own he is of a very different cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Firm and inflexible, he imagines he makes virtue his rule, and reaſon his guide.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
                     <p>Firm indeed? No, no: ferocious, obſtinate, perverſe. Sir George tries to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and is ſucceſsful: Mr. Delaval has no fear of offending, and does not miſs his aim.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>LADY J.</speaker>

                     <speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
                     <p>Mr. Delaval never was approved by me; and this morning he has inſulted your father.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
                     <p>Inſulted! How do you mean, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam? Mr. Delaval is abroad! Has he written?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
                     <p>No. He is here.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
                     <p>Here! And has he not thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to let me know of his arrival?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
                     <p>No, no. The haughty gentleman has only thought proper to reproach Lord Vibrate for admitting the pretenſions of Sir George. He is too proud to endure a competitor.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LADY J.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed! Such pride is the very way to inſure his competitor ſucceſs. Inſulted my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LADY V.</speaker>
                     <p>I will leave you to judge how deeply when I tell you that, fluctuating and undecided as Lord Vibrate always is, he was ſo offended that he pledged his honor in favor of Sir George.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LADY J.</speaker>

                     <p>Pardon me, madam. I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to feel it, in the leaſt. It ſhall not affect me; no not for a moment. I had indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a very different opinion of Mr. Delaval. I am glad I have diſcovered my error, before it is too late. I could not have believed it poſſible! But it ſhall not diſturb me. It ſhall give me no uneaſineſs. I will keep myſelf perfectly cool, and unconcerned, and—ungenerous, unfeeling man!</p>

Since then all are ſo liable to be miſled, let gentle forbearance, indulgent thoughts, and a mild forgiving ſpirit, be ever held as the ſacred duties of man to man.</p>
