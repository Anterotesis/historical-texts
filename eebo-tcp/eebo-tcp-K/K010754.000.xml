            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Giant's country, birth, parentage, and education.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS Swediſh Giant was born at Oulo, or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0160602500:18"/>Ula. a port town ſituated on the eaſt ſide of the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Bay in Finland, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on Ruſſia, in the year 1709. His Father's name was <hi>Cajanus;</hi> a man of a good character, but better noted for his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantick ſize, than for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or fortune; though without doubt he came from a race of Giants, which it is too trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome at this time to trace
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0160602500:19"/>to the original. His Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likewiſe was of an uncommon height, which exceeded ſeven feet; and his Siſter, now living, is ſtill taller; who, perhaps, ſhould ſhe live to ſee her Brother return, and know his good luck, may take it in her head to travel upon the ſame errand.</p>
               <p>Of theſe Great Parents was our Giant born, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0160602500:20"/>his ſize proves he was no baſtard.</p>
               <p>His honeſt, careful old Father, beſtowed on him an education ſuitable to his own circumſtances, and his Son's capacity for learning, which never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very quick or live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and endeavoured to plant in him, whilſt young, the ſeeds of true honour and virtue. He likewiſe brought him up to induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0160602500:21"/>to work in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with the ſpade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to labour in the field in husbandry affairs, and in ſhort, to get his bread by the ſweat of his brow.</p>
               <p>As no extraordinary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent attended his younger years, he eat, drank, and play'd like other youth, only more at a time, and grew faſter; we'll paſs over this part of his life, and follow him to the next ſtage.</p>

                  <hi>Of the Giant's falling in love with a farmer's daughter, named</hi> Dolla Rucina: <hi>How he made known his paſſion to her father, and what recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he met with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NEar to Oulo lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthy farmer, who had an only daughter of great beauty, and poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0160602500:23"/>of all the virtues which render thoſe charms the more amiable: She was likewiſe trained from her infancy to induſtry, by the care and example of a good Mother, who taught her to ſpin flax and wool; to milk the kine; to make cheeſe and butter, and all that was neceſſary for the female part, in the dairy, the houſe, the garden, or the field; ſo that ſhe had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0160602500:24"/>no idle hours to ſpend in dreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor did ſhe need it; for nature had been very indulgent in plentifully beſtowing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſet her off, without any art or fallacy.</p>
               <p>The perfections of this fair maid had taken deep root in our Giant's heart, ſo that in her center'd all his happineſs. He had demonſtrated a good judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in placing his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0160602500:25"/>on one ſo worthy: but how to gain her was the point. He ſuffered Love's flame to ſmother a long time in his breaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dared to undertake this adventure. He was at this time a comely young man; and though he was tall, his ſtature might have been diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, had he ceaſed growing: but his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing to increaſe in bulk

                  </gap>ſes, which preſented themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the difficulty of this undertaking, he at length, with the courage of a Giant, pluck'd up a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0160602500:27"/>good heart, and ventured one pleaſant evening to viſit this fair damſel, to whom he was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſtranger. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with great diſcretion and caution, and he behaved with much po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs and good manners.</p>
               <p>After ſome little time he addreſs'd himſelf to <hi>Dolla Rucina</hi>'s father, and with a graceful air told his errand; and with great
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0160602500:28"/>modeſty deſired his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to viſit his charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daughter, the lovely <hi>Dolla Rucina;</hi> and tho' his deſigns were ſtrictly honourable, he would not enter upon a buſineſs of ſo great a concern without his leave.</p>
               <p>The father anſwer'd, Thou haſt done well, young man, in firſt mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known this affair unto me; but what thou askeſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0160602500:29"/>is of ſo great moment, that it requires much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: I cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immediately conſent to what thou requireſt, till I have well weighed it in my own mind. Tell me, therefore, thy name, parentage, and place of abode. The young Giant anſwered, My name is <hi>Daniel Cajanus,</hi> ſon of the old <hi>Cajanus,</hi> of Oulo. An honeſt and reputable fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0160602500:30"/>replied the old man: thy father was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me. Thou ſhalt be welcome to my houſe, and to ſuch good cheer as it will afford.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dolla Rucina</hi>'s parents entertain'd <hi>Cajanus</hi> with bowls of moſt delicious cream; pails of ſyllabub; freſh cheeſe and butter; all ſorts of choice fruit that their garden or orchard produced; with ſeveral
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0160602500:31"/>kinds of refreſhing liquors; and, what was more dear to him than all other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, a reception which gave him great hopes, that one day he ſhould obtain poſſeſſion of the moſt love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly object of his affection.</p>
               <p>Our young Giant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus fortunate in his firſt adventure, often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to this fair maiden, who as conſtantly receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and, with her
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0160602500:32"/>parents leave, entertained him in the ſame generous manner; plentifully, and yet prudently, regaling him with good cheer, and a hearty welcome.</p>

                  <hi>How the Giant was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in gaining the fair</hi> Dolla Rucina; <hi>and what followed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFter a conſiderable time ſpent in court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beautiful <hi>Dolla Rucina,</hi> wherein ſucceſs ſeemed to favour all <hi>Caja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s wiſhes, and he even rioted in exceſs of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0160602500:34"/>the parents of this fair maid, to whom ſhe was very dear, told her with much tenderneſs, leſt it ſhould cauſe too great an uneaſineſs in her mind; for ſhe had, during the viſits of <hi>Cajanus,</hi> conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very good liking to his perſon; his great bulk was the only objection, and the remarks which the world made of the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in their ſize. That
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0160602500:35"/>they ſhould inform <hi>Caja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> at his next viſit, that they could not approve of a match ſo unequal; that they were ſorry they had not broke it off ſooner; and adviſed their daughter no longer to entertain thoughts of marrying a man whoſe ſize exceeded all reaſon. <hi>Dolla Rucina,</hi> ever obedient to her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, promiſed them that ſhe would no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0160602500:36"/>him upon that foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded only.</p>
               <p>The great diſproportion in their ſize had often given much diſquietude to theſe lovers, and interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their greateſt and moſt innocent enjoyments, long before <hi>Dolla Rucina</hi> had received this injunction from her father.</p>
               <p>She at this time reach'd but a little above <hi>Cajanus</hi>'s
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0160602500:37"/>waſte, and was of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſize, and not likely to be taller. He, who alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſurpaſs'd all mankind in heighth, was ſtill growing on apace, as if he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to tower above the skies.</p>
               <p>It was likewiſe a great mortification to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of this unequal pair, to hear themſelves ridicul'd upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, by all the young
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0160602500:38"/>people in the country round about; to whom this courtſhip was well known, and which afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them much diverſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dolla Rucina</hi> deſired leave of her father, that ſhe herſelf might make this affair known to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus:</hi> to which he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſented.</p>
               <p>This fair damſel had that ſame evening reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution enough to tell <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0160602500:39"/>all that her father and mother adviſed her to, which was calculated for the good of them both: and this ſhe broke to him in the following manner.</p>
               <p>After a deep ſigh, ſhe ſaid, Dear <hi>Cajanus,</hi> thou haſt need to arm thyſelf with all the fortitude thou art maſter of, leſt what I have to tell thee wound ſo deep, that it overwhelm thy poor ſpirit. Alas!
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0160602500:40"/>
                  <hi>Dolla Rucina</hi> has this day received a ſtrict charge from her parents, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to entertain thee on any other terms than that of a friend. This charge from my father is of ſo much conſequence, and concerns the happineſs of us both, that I cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cajanus</hi> at this news was ſtruck dumb, not one word could he utter, till
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0160602500:41"/>after ſome time; he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, gave vent to his paſſion in a torrent of tears which flowed from his eyes in great abundance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dolla Rucina</hi>'s parents endeavoured by reaſon to pacify his great grief, but no arguments made any impreſſion; time only was to recover him.</p>
               <p>However, in ſome little time he began to recollect himſelf; to walk, talk,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0160602500:42"/>and uſe his reaſon. And before his departure they regaled him with curds, cream, and other country fare, as uſual; which <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus</hi> was a dear lover of, and fed pretty cheerfully upon.</p>
               <p>After this refreſhment he bid adieu to his dear <hi>Dolla Rucina,</hi> paid his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to her worthy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and then walk'd lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely home, with a belly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0160602500:43"/>brimful of good cheer, a heart loaded with ſorrow, and a head full of thoughts of what had happen'd, and of contriving what courſe to take. This held him till he got home, and to bed; where he ſpent the night in uttering deep ſighs and bitter groans: Grief and melancholly had ſeized his heart, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection was viſible in his countenance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0160602500:44"/>The friends of <hi>Cajanus</hi> endeavoured, as <hi>Dolla Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina</hi>'s had done before, to comfort him under this heavy trial, but in vain; he would yield to no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions: they left him therefore to his own courſe, which ſeemed fixt upon a firm reſolution of viſiting foreign parts.</p>
               <p>Upon every diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which <hi>Cajanus</hi> met with, a natural ſullenneſs
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0160602500:45"/>followed, which would yield to no arguments of reaſon; but was forced to be left always to his own will to rectify. This was the occaſion of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary trouble both to himſelf and to his friends.</p>

                  <hi>Of the Giant's reſolving to leave his country: How he was invited into the army; and what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE diſappointment which <hi>Cajanus</hi> met with in his love-adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was ſoon ſpread over the town of Oulo, and the neighbouring villages;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0160602500:47"/>that he became the jeſt of all the young people of thoſe parts, to whom this amour was well known. He ſhut himſelf up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from ſociety, refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any longer to appear in publick: and upon this account came to a fixed reſolution of leaving his native place, and viſiting foreign climates.</p>
               <p>There happen'd at this time to be recruiting offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0160602500:48"/>in the town of Oulo, who were raiſing men for the ſervice of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who was then about aſſembling a large army for the recovery of Finland from the Ruſſians, or ſome other important enterprize; being ſpirited up by the artful contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of a mitred prieſt, who was chief in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of a great prince.</p>
               <p>Theſe officers being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſormed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0160602500:49"/>of the Giant's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of going abroad, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to engage him to enter into the army; to which end they tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with money; they promiſed to get him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted: but neither of theſe allurements had any influence on <hi>Cajanus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was likewiſe ſtrongly repreſented to him, how much his king and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſtood in need at that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0160602500:50"/>time of his ſervice, and the honour he might get to himſelf. He was ſtill deaf to all this; and choſe rather to leave his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and kindred expoſed to the havock and miſery of war, than to lend them his aſſiſtance.</p>

                  <hi>How the example of ſome mighty Giants of old was propoſed to</hi> Cajanus; <hi>how be rejected them with diſdain: and whether this great Swediſh Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant is not a very great coward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE firſt is <hi>Goliah,</hi> the great Giant of Gath, who made the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0160602500:52"/>whole hoſt of the Iſraelites to quake: Even King Saul himſelf, who was taller than any man in his army, and a valiant ſoldier too, was afraid of this great Philiſtine. He went out day by day, and vaunted out his inſolent ſpeeches, and hold threats of pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their bones, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their fleſh to the fowls of the air and beaſts of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This put Saul and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0160602500:53"/>his army into ſo great a panick, that had it not been for the fortunate ſtone from the ſling of young David, the ſon of Jeſſe, it might have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Philiſtine army the victory.</p>
               <p>The next is the ſtrong and valiant <hi>Sampſon;</hi> who, when he was laid down to repoſe himſelf, and his enemies were ſtealing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares to ſeize him; it
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0160602500:54"/>was no ſooner called out to him, <hi>Sampſon, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines are upon thee;</hi> but he ſtarts up, lays hold of the firſt weapon in his way, even the jaw-bone of an aſs, with which he laid about him ſo faſt, that he ſmote them hip and thigh, and after he had ſurveyed the ſlain, he ſat down and compoſed a ſong of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; viz. <hi>Heaps upon heaps: with the jaw-bone
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0160602500:55"/>of an aſs I have ſlain a thouſand men.</hi> True cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage never wants a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.</p>
               <p>We read in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Kings of Iſrael, of the mighty Tachmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, named <hi>Adino,</hi> who ſlew eight hundred at one time. And of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> the ſon of Dodo, who rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a whole army. Sacred Writ mentions many ſuch ſtout champions who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0160602500:56"/>their ſervice for the defence of their country. Profane hiſtory relates the ſame of all their great heroes.</p>
               <p>The noble actions of theſe brave old Giants, was no inducement to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus;</hi> he was afraid of being placed in the front of the battle, to have the rough muſick of musket balls whiſtling in his ears. The thoughts of this was
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0160602500:57"/>death to him. How far ſhort does this Swediſh Giant's courage fall of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Gogmagog's, who, even now in his old age, will ſtand the fire of a whole regiment of our va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant city train'd-bands, without winching? and his ſtout brother Corineus will do the ſame.</p>
               <p>Giant <hi>Cajanus</hi> would hearken to no propoſals of going into the army; and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0160602500:58"/>told the recruiting officers that he look'd upon what they had promiſed, as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to inveigle and trappan him, and not in their power to perform; and therefore gave them an abſolute denial, that he would not accept of a ſoldier's life: and refuſed to be ſeen by them any more.</p>
               <p>As Giant <hi>Cajanus</hi> grew up, he ſhewed a leſſer
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0160602500:59"/>inclination to a military life than was expected: for inſtead of a brave mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſpirit, of gaining glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the field of war, he had a natural averſion to the life of a ſoldier; and choſe rather to travel like a vagabond, to ſhew his great bulk for lucre: which ſhews that the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt men have not always the ſtouteſt hearts.</p>
               <p>How pleaſant would it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0160602500:60"/>have been for future ages to have read in the Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh chronicle of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious atchievements of the great <hi>Cajanus,</hi> when he appeared in the day of battle in the fore front of the army? that to him, in a great meaſure, might be owing, victory againſt the Ruſſians.</p>
               <p>He might have been made to look very terrible and fierce, by gracing his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0160602500:61"/>head with a ſtately ſtrong helmet, properly adorn'd, which might have added to his ſtature two or three foot; and given him a handſome &amp; ſtrong ſhield; likewiſe to have fenced his body with armour of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd ſteel, and a ſword anſwerable to his great ſize; ſo to have equipp'd him every way like a man of war. And then, if he had had no true courage
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0160602500:62"/>of his own, he might have pretended to vaunt it out with big words, like the braggadocias of Totten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-court, of what they can do; though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſign to hurt their powerful antagoniſt. Such language, perhaps, might intimidate an enemy, and thereby have gain'd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Giant <hi>Cajanus</hi> had been privately inform'd, that the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0160602500:63"/>recruiting officers expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an order to preſs him into the King's ſervice, he therefore agrees with the captain of a ſhip to carry him to Holland.</p>
               <p>He immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for his voyage, takes leave of all his friends, and before his departure he went and took his laſt farewel of the charming <hi>Dolla Rucina,</hi> and her good father and mother.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0160602500:64"/>They gave him a hearty welcome: ſo that having eat of their meat and drank of their nectar, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with great tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and bid a final adieu to each other.</p>
               <p>I ſhould have told my readers, that <hi>Dolla Ruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> was now married to a young farmer, whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was lately dead, and had left him in poſſeſſion of a rich farm. They were
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0160602500:65"/>agreeable in ſize and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and had the proſpect of being a very happy couple: in which ſtate we ſhall leave her, and trace the footſteps of young Giant <hi>Cajanus</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

               </p>
               <p>GIant <hi>Cajanus,</hi> having provided all things neceſſary for this voyage, and the ſhip being ready to fail, went aboard as private as he could; where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0160602500:67"/>to ſhew himſelf till at ſea; the captain gave or ders to weigh anchor and ſet fail; a freſh gale of wind ſpringing up, which ſoon run them out of ſight of Oulo, and held favourable all down the Botnick Bay: they had likewiſe good weather thro' the Baltick ſea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cajanus</hi> was well uſed by the captain, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd him with his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0160602500:68"/>adventures in many voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages and travels to foreign parts, and the dangers he eſcap'd; very pleaſant to hear, but too much to relate in this Hiſtory. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus,</hi> in his turn, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the captain with his own adventures by land: theſe relations were often ſeaſon'd with good bowls of punch, canns of flip, and other refreſhing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors. And thus they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0160602500:69"/>ſpent their time, during a ſafe and quick paſſage to Holland; in which no real dangers or misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes happen'd: except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſtiff gale of wind, which they met with one evening off the coaſt of Norway, which obliged them to hand all their top-fails, and to fail under them three coaſts: there run a very great head-ſea, and the ſheets being cloſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0160602500:70"/>haul'd, ſhe made but dull way thro' the water; it was beſide dark hazy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The failors had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been in greater ſtorms than that, and ſo made light of it. But the caſe of poor <hi>Cajanus</hi> was quite different; he expected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than to be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up every minute by the waves. The ſhip ſometimes heel'd gunnel too, which is common in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0160602500:71"/>a gale of wind; this ſo much added to <hi>Cajanus</hi>'s fright, to ſee the water come upon deck, that he laid himſelf along, and held faſt by ſome ropes at the weather-ſide, where he was continually ſliding over to leeward, and crawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back again: and ſo, like Siſiphus with his ſtone, his work was never done.</p>
               <p>The ſailors endeavour'd to hearten him up at this
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0160602500:72"/>time; but nothing would do, till <hi>Cajanus</hi> ſaw the ſtorm abate, day-light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and a brave bowl of punch before him: He then look'd as ſtout as the beſt man aboard the ſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cajanus</hi> arriv'd ſafe in Holland, and having made the beſt advantage he could there, being told how fond the Engliſh people are of foreign novelties, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a tame Giant, he
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0160602500:73"/>might find his account in it, if he would viſit that country; for he would be look'd upon as a very great curioſity; perhaps the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt that ever was ſeen in that land.</p>
               <p>The Giant being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed how he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have when he came over, embark'd for England; where landing ſafe, he ſet out privately for London, and took up his reſidence

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0160602500:76"/>UPon the firſt notice of the arrival of this Grant at Charing-croſs, his fame was ſoon ſpread over the whole town; ſo that there was a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of perſons of all ranks to ſee him, at <hi>one Shilling</hi> each; which was a great profit to <hi>Cajanus,</hi> and an encouragement he ought to have been contented with.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0160602500:78"/>In a little time, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſits, he became ſo well acquainted with Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Caianus,</hi> that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him to be of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry covetous temper; and therefore was to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd on that quarter. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, an offer being made, he ſoon liſtned to the propoſal; and at laſt agreed, that Giant <hi>Pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi> for a ſum of money (ſome ſay <hi>two hundred

Articles being drawn up, and ſign'd, the Giant took the money, the ſight of which made him to ſmile, and put it into a purſe, and that ſafe into his pocket: This done, he delivers himſelf, body

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0160602500:83"/>part with him again; and to know his price, and what he was fit for. When upon examination, finding that he was no Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith, Wheelwright, Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, Cooper, Carpenter, Joiner, Taylor, nor any other ſerviceable trade, he declined having any thing to do with him: Tho' his maſter was of more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and knew better his own intereſt, than to have
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0160602500:84"/>ſold him to the Devil, if his Agent had liked him.</p>
               <p>The great Giant <hi>Puff</hi> was not ſo big a fool, but he underſtood the Agent's buſineſs: he grew very uneaſy at what he had done: and was afraid that he had already enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Articles with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.

               </p>
               <p>This threw the Giant into deſpair. He was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his maſter; and expected no other than the Devil to ſend his Agent for him.

                  <hi>How ſome unlucky ſcholars had formed a plot for ſeizing the Giant in one of his night peram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations: and how he was delivered out of their hands, and got ſafe to town.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DUring the time that the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Giant
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0160602500:92"/>was at Oxford, ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious ſcholars, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps could not afford to pay for the ſight of him, enter'd into a deſign of ſeizing, and carrying him by main force to ſome private place; where they intended to have read a lecture upon this great man, and to have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined him joint by joint, and limb by limb. In order, therefore, to put
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0160602500:93"/>this ſcheme in execution, it was agreed to ſeize him in one of his evening ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: it being cuſtomary for the Giant to take a ſmall airing, when the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was in profound reſt. This plot was carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution by a few of them, who were deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and reſolute: they knew he had not courage to defend himſelf. The Giant being laid hold on,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0160602500:94"/>was carried to a proper place; and a watch ſet over him, with a promiſe he ſhould come to no harm, if he would be quiet; and the next day be ſet at liberty. <hi>Pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi> his maſter, uſed all the arguments he could think of, to procure his Giant's liberty: but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could prevail with them, till he pull'd out ſome of his curious metal
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0160602500:95"/>toys, which he diſtribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt them, and which they took in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for gold: This ſo blinded their eyes, that after they had a little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied their curioſity, in viewing him from head to toe, he was ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: which he had no ſooner regain'd, but he begg'd of his maſter to leave that city; which he readily conſented to, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0160602500:96"/>gave him a guide directly to London; and diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his lodging, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him.</p>
               <p>Giant <hi>Puff,</hi> whenever he heard any travellers, either behind or before, always ſtepp'd into the hedge, and there ſtood upright; which in the night look'd like the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or trunk of an old tree. By which cunning ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem he eſcaped ſafe to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0160602500:97"/>town, without any thing remarkable happening</p>
               <p>He was convey'd to an apartment facing the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion-houſe; where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains this 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, 1742. under the circumſtances deſcribed in the following chapter.</p>
               <p>The time being now expired that he ſold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for, <hi>Pinchbone,</hi> like an honourable maſter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered Giant <hi>Puff</hi> into
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0160602500:98"/>his own hands, to make the moſt of himſelf.</p>

                  <hi>Of the preſent ſituation of Giant</hi> Puff; <hi>with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THis wonderful Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſus is cramm'd, like a Maramotte, in a box, in a ſmall cloſe back
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0160602500:99"/>room, up one pair of ſtairs, facing the Manſion-houſe; where, perhaps, ſhould he live to ſee it finiſh'd, he may expect to be put into ſome poſt, like Gogmagog and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineus; whether he has done any thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it or no. But that point muſt be left to the conſultation and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the heads of the city.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0160602500:100"/>Here each little boy and girl pays <hi>Six-pence</hi> for the ſight of this big Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. He is generally ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a great chair, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his bulk and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ready to receive company. His dreſs is a rich banjan, after the Turkiſh mode; double breaſted, and ornamented with gold, and girt round the waſte with a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did ſaſh, or girdle, like
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0160602500:101"/>that of Giant <hi>Gog.</hi>'s in Guildhall: All his other habit is anſwerable to this, and exactly fitted to the gravity of a peaceable Giant.</p>
               <p>Having enter'd <hi>Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s apartment, paid obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to his Giant Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and ſurvey'd him a little time ſitting, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to rouſe; for he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſeems drowſy; which we may impute to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0160602500:102"/>illneſs: he fills a glaſs of wine, and drinks to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (for if any of the company are minded to drink with him, they muſt ſend for their bottle.) He then riſes up, and ſurprizes all ſpectators with his great heighth and bigneſs. And hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtalk'd backwards and forwards in his room, half a dozen turns, and entertain'd the company
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0160602500:103"/>with a ſong, in a voice as loud as the great pipe of a large organ, and in a tune like <hi>Tidde-doll over his gingerbread;</hi> he drinks another glaſs, and perhaps another, if he fancies it. Then he ſhews how high he can reach; anſwers ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil queſtions, and ſuffers ſome parts of his body to be meaſur'd; and theſe are the chief exploits he performs, excepting it be
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0160602500:104"/>to ſnuff a candle, or to let a fart.</p>
               <p>His heighth was eight foot, four inches; and the bigneſs of his body and limbs was once in juſt proportion. But now his legs are gouty and ill ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; his knees knock to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; his body bowed, that it ſeems painful for him to ſtretch, or raiſe himſelf up. His head likewiſe hung down, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0160602500:105"/>his cheeks are pinched; his looks fickly, and all his parts greatly waſted. His hands and fingers are very long and ſlender; his feet and toes the ſame.</p>
               <p>He is now thirty three years of age, and has been done growing about eight.</p>
               <p>I have now, my young readers, given you the ſtate and way of life of this gigantick young man,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0160602500:106"/>who for the ſake of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lucre has deſtroy'd his health, wanting air and exerciſe. Whereas with a proper uſe of his parts, and due care, he might have liv'd to have been an old robuſt Giant, and deſcended to his grave loaden with honours and renown; as the brave Giants of old time.</p>
               <p>And it was in order to prevent his being utterly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0160602500:107"/>ten to the world, as alſo to oblige my young read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that I have been at the pains to publiſh this gigantick <hi>Hiſtory of his Life;</hi> and I doubt not but I ſhall be as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely rewarded for it, as I was for writing that of the two Giants my worthy next neighbours, old Gogmagog and Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0160602500:108"/>He is now attended by phyſicians and ſurgeons; and is in ſuch a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous way, as ſeems to forebode a ſpeedy diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <hi>A ſtory of the Giant's going to ſee a review; his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made an enſign in the army; and how be quitted his colours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS I would no ways derogate from our Giant's reputation for exploits in war, I think myſelf oblig'd to relate a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0160602500:110"/>ſtory I have lately heard, tho' I cannot atteſt the truth of it. It is this:</p>
               <p>There being a review of the troops aſſembled in Finland, the Giant was perſwaded by ſome of his acquaintance to go to ſee it. The handſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance the officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made, was much admired by all that ſaw them. This fine ſight ſo well pleaſed <hi>Cajanus</hi> (for ſo we may
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0160602500:111"/>now call him, as he is his own maſter again) that he accepted of an enſign's place, on promiſe, that if he diſliked a ſoldier's life, he ſhould be at liberty to quit the ſervice.</p>
               <p>He being meaſured, cloath'd and arm'd, enter'd into preſent pay; but he ſtalk'd about very awkard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his new equipments, and ſeldom in his proper place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0160602500:112"/>
                  <hi>Cajanus</hi>'s brother offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſoon perceiv'd, that tho' he was of a great bulk, he wanted courage; on which account he could do but little good in the front of an army, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to look big, and to help ſcare an enemy that did not know him. But the front was a poſt that great <hi>Goliah</hi> could by no means like, except at a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, and in time of peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0160602500:113"/>In ſhort, even the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſoldiers took upon them to make game of this tall enſign, nay, challeng'd and affronted him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually; knowing he had not the heart to reſent it.</p>
               <p>After a little time, a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was ſpread, that the Ruſſians were arming, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to drive the Swedes out of Finland.</p>
               <p>Upon this news, ſome of the young officers, who
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0160602500:114"/>look'd ſo gay at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, fell ſick; others ſold, or flung up their commiſſions. <hi>Cajanus,</hi> for his part, neither ask'd leave to quit, nor try'd to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>How the Giant went to viſit</hi> Gogmagog <hi>and</hi> Corineus <hi>in Guildhall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT happen'd that during the time this mighty <hi>Swediſh</hi> Giant was his own maſter, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with the <hi>Gigantick Hiſtory of the two famous Giants in Guildhall, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0160602500:116"/>at the ſight of which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> is impoſſible to expreſs his ſurprize and delight: But upon hearing it read, his countenance fell; and he was much alarm'd, leſt he ſhould not appear to great a curioſity, as he would fain make the world believe. He was inform'd that they were Giants of nice honour, but no ways quarrelſome, unleſs they were firſt affronted. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0160602500:117"/>this, he reſolved to make them a viſit in a private manner, to ſee if he could diſcern any linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his anceſtors or kindred in their faces. Accordingly, he ſqueez'd himſelf into a coach, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting almoſt double, and drove cloſe to Guildhall. As he enter'd the great door, he had preſently the ſatisfaction of ſeeing, and paying obeiſance to Gog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magog
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0160602500:118"/>and Corineus, thoſe two brave old city champions. He was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abaſh'd at the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their looks, their warlike habits, and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deportment; in which he ſaw nothing that was akin to himſelf. The two old Giants ſtood ſtiff to their poſts, taking very little notice of him; he appearing to them more like the ghoſt of a Giant
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0160602500:119"/>than any thing elſe: and tho' he came juſt about twelve a-clock, as if he expected an invitation to dinner, when they ſtepp'd down; he was entirely diſappointed if he did: perhaps they might have but ſhort commons that day; or might judge by his looks, that he would with much more intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity attack a ſheep than he would a lion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0160602500:120"/>The people began to gather about the ſtrange Giant from all parts of the Hall; but he, not caring to be ſtar'd at too much, ſtrides gently up to the Bookſciler's, next the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, look'd at his books, then turns himſelf round, and without ſaying one word, takes two or three coloſſus ſtrides acroſs the Hall, into the coach, and away he goes: the people
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0160602500:121"/>gazing after him, as if they had ſeen the apparition of ſome Giant, which has been ſaid to happen before their death.</p>
               <p>Now methinks I hear the Giant, upon hearing this read to him, mutter in broken Engliſh, <hi>A lye! A lye! A lye!</hi> Be that as it will; the next time he comes to Guildhall without giving notice, he will be in danger of being ſqueez'd into <hi>Little-eaſe.</hi>
