            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A REMARKABLE CASE OF MADNESS.</head>
            <p>THE records of medicine cannot perhaps afford an inſtance ſimilar to the preſent, nor do we find in the different writers, who have profeſſedly treated on <hi>maniacal</hi> affections, one caſe wherein, at ſo early a period as the age of <hi>eleven years,</hi> the diſorder has appeared with marks ſo clear and intelligible. And it is as ſingular in this inſtance that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0649400900:4"/>there ſeems no clue leading to the cauſe, as prediſpoſing to inſanity, no <hi>tranſlation</hi> of the diſeaſed matter of any part to the membranes of the brain producing <hi>delirium</hi> &amp;c, nor <hi>diffuſion</hi> of bile, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſubſidence of <hi>cutaneous eruptions, abſortion</hi> of matter from <hi>abſceſſes, wounds,</hi> or <hi>ulcers,</hi> no <hi>ſcrophulous</hi> or <hi>cancerous</hi> taint of the juices, no exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>deleterious</hi> vegetables or <hi>mercurial</hi> preparations, no <hi>ſudden fright, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental blow, fall,</hi> or any <hi>hereditary</hi> prediſpoſition to <hi>mania.</hi> No one of his family on the ſide of either father or mother having ever been remembered to have been the leaſt affected with mental diſeaſe; in ſhort there was no obvious cauſe to which the complaint could be rationally aſſigned. The child
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0649400900:5"/>was looked upon as poſſeſſed of no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſhare of genius, ability, nor activity of imagination, nor was he ſo ſprightly as moſt boys of that age, but rather of a thoughtful, melancholic diſpoſition, very little inclined to pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile amuſements and diverſions; but rather docile and tractable, he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been healthy, had never ſhewn a wanton propenſity to hard and indegiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aliment, he had never been too much indulged, nor compelled to any intenſe application of mind. It was his cuſtom in the morning to go with other children to a ſchool at ſome diſtance from his home, and to return in the evening. <hi>On the twenty ninth of January,</hi> 1789, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unuſually low and dull, little notice was then taken of the alteration in his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0649400900:6"/>appearance; but upon his return from ſchool the following day, the depreſſion and lowneſs being much more viſible, a ſerious enquiry took place, as to the cauſe of his complaint, but his anſwers ſeemed rather extorted, were vague, unconnected, and inconcluſive he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hurried at the ſight of ſtrangers, often turned pale, trembled, had an angry acute ſtaring look, with dilated pupils, and dreadful apprehenſions, frequently look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fearfully about, as if he ſuſpected ſome ill deſign, ſometimes he appeared timid and diſtreſſed ſig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed much, and had not more than a quarter of an hours ſleep throughout the whole night. <hi>January</hi> 31ſt, from a ſuppoſition of coſtiveneſs, ſome manna was diſſolved and given him, which operated once, but did not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0649400900:7"/>relieve him in the leaſt, he appeared all the day unuſually ſtrange in his manner and actions. Fear, diſtreſs, and ſhame, alternately occupied his mind but he did not at any time advert to any one object in particular, nor upon the ſtricteſt examination could it be found that he had been lately terrified, or undergone the leaſt degree of ſcholaſtic admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory diſcipline, or that his temper had been ruffled in any ſhape whatever. He was ſat up with, had very little ſleep, not more than two hours in the whole night. <hi>In the morning, February</hi> 1ſt, he ſpoke rather more rationally than he had done before, but complained of a pain in his head with giddineſs, weakneſs, and rather a dimneſs of fight, that his eyes ached and were painful, and that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0649400900:8"/>he ſcarcely knew where he was, and ſaid he was very ſleepy; he laid down to ſleep, but was ſo reſtleſs and diſtreſſed in mind, as not to get any, and if a word were ſpoken, it made him peeviſh, and petulant, and the leaſt motion from the bye ſtanders became an immediate object of freſh inquietude and vexation. Having ſome degree of rigor, and his legs and feet feeling very cold, by the directions of his mother, they were very judiciouſly immerſed in warm water, and he was put to bed again, when the ſame diſtreſsful ideas occaſioned the ſame watchfulneſs as before, and he ſlept not ſo much as an hour in the whole night, often waking in great perturbation of mind, ſometimes ſighing, as if he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured under great affliction and at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0649400900:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>inceſſantly talking and rambling with quick tranſition from one ſubject to another, without the leaſt reaſon or coherence whatever. <hi>February</hi> 2d, the family apothecary was ſent for, who found him in the ſtate as before deſcribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an alienation of mind without a fever; the ſkin harſh and dry, he had had little or no perſpiration from the time he was taken, ſometimes very wakeful and loquacious, at others ſtupid, abſent, and muſing, and the pulſe rather below the natural ſtandard at his age; ſinapiſms were ordered to the feet, and a bliſter to the back, which were applied in the evening; he paſſed the night in a more uneaſy and reſtleſs manner than before, and in the morning, at the particular requeſt of the apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary,

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0649400900:12"/>another practitioner was conſulted. <hi>February</hi> 3d, his ſleep during the night had been leſs diſturbed, but of very ſhort duration, at moſt not more than ten or fifteen minutes at a time, and in the intervals frequently interrupted with ſighs and ſtartings. <hi>February</hi> 4th, all the former ſigns of mental derange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment recurred, and there appeared not the leaſt alteration for the better, the bliſter had diſcharged but little, and he having been coſtive, for ſome time, four ſtimulant clyſters were ſucceſſively injected; but returned again, juſt tinged with the feces, and without any apparent good effect. <hi>Until February</hi> 18th, he continued alternately in a ſilent ſtupid or diſtreſsfully obſtreperous ſlate; but at intervals began to ſhew ſome ſigns of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0649400900:13"/>returning reaſon, which continued to furniſh hopes of recovery, until <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> 14th, when he reverted entirely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his former bad ſtate, had a miſerably diſtreſſing night, with the aggravated ſymptoms of diſtorted eyes, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reſpiration; neither was he in the leaſt better all that Day nor the following night; the bliſter at his back diſcharged tolerably well, was kept open, and an iſſue was alſo opened in his arm. <hi>February</hi> 15th, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> he took <hi>emetics</hi> twice, which had no manner of effect either upwards or downwards; <hi>boluſſes of cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor</hi> were preſcribed and given; but ſtill he remained in a gloomy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed ſtate of mind without any ſever until <hi>February</hi> 19th, when becoming much worſe in every reſpect, and by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0649400900:14"/>way of revulſion, it was thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to apply bliſters to the legs, which was done, and a very bad night enſued; for it was with much difficulty he was kept in bed; beſides the ordinary ſymptoms of melancholy, he was at times more iraſcible and furious than at any former period of his illneſs. <hi>February</hi> 20th, all day he appeared to labour under the moſt excruciating and intenſe ſenſations of anxiety and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, and paſſed a dreadful night. <hi>February</hi> 21ſt. the ſame ſymptoms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued without the leaſt mitigation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til toward the morning, when a ſullen ſilence and reſerve, accompanied with ſome degree of ſleep ſupervened, relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from which, for ſome hours, he appeared rational, and more calm and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0649400900:15"/>compoſed than he had been for ſome time before; but this was an interval of ſhort duration, for <hi>February</hi> 22d. he grew much worſe, with cold ſhudder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, great difficulty of breathing, was furious, and became quite raving, ſo that two ſtrong people could not hold him, down in his bed, without much exertion, and in this ſtate, with very little variation, he continued until <hi>February</hi> 27th. when ſoon after ſome looſe feces, procured by a laxative medicine, he ſuddenly became more eaſy and compoſed, paſſed more water than he had done for ſeveral days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſlept with much leſs interruption, ſeemed to be more rational, and in ſome degree, recoverd his uſual ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but <hi>February</hi> 28th. he reverted to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0649400900:16"/>his former ſtate of horror and dejection, and ſeemed ſcarcely to know or attend at all to external objects. <hi>March</hi> 1ſt. he was apparently leſs diſtreſſed and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in his mind. <hi>March</hi> 2d, produced ſome comfortable hopes that he was getting better, which in ſome degree alleviated the painful feelings of maternal affection, that had ſo long been upon the rack on account of his ſufferings; but this ceſſation of parental ſolicitude, was only protracted until <hi>March</hi> 7th, when he again appeared low and ſad, and much deranged in mind, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of a pain and weight in his head, which was directed to be ſhaved and embrocated with diſtilled vinegar, and a bliſter to the head was alſo adviſed as eſſentially neceſſary; but the idea of its
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0649400900:17"/>application was ſo diſtreſſing to his friends, as to preclude for the preſent all thoughts of it; another <hi>emetic</hi> much ſtronger than either of the former was next thought of and adminiſtered accordingly; but prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as inefficacious in its operation as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the preceding, neither occaſioning nauſea, vomiting, or purging; but ſome ſmall degree of dampneſs on the ſkin was thought to be in conſequence of it. Hitherto every medical effort had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved fruitleſs, and the poor little ſufferer obtained no palliation of the ſymptoms. <hi>March</hi> 9th. Still a victim to the ravages and returns of this mercileſs malady, he was ſeized with diſmal apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and groundleſs fears. The facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his mind were weak and timid. Taciturnity and meditation took place
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0649400900:18"/>of horror and depreſſion, tears and lamentations, which recurred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in proportion as his ruminating paroxyſms were longer or ſhorter, his nights were paſſed in watchfulneſs, and his days in ſadneſs, with lucid intervals of momentary duration, until <hi>March</hi> 13th, when the ſolitary ſtate of his mind changed, on a ſudden, into diſtraction audacity and violence,; the dilirium appearing to have taken a turn directly oppoſite to its former genus, ſo that from the deſponding, he was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the raving maniac, and the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf and friends was rendered truly deplorable indeed. At this criſis of calamity a <hi>bliſter to the head</hi> was again propoſed, and the former objections giving way to the emergency of the caſe,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0649400900:19"/>was applied, when the next day he was infinitely worſe, and more reſtleſs and unmanagable than he had ever been before. The cauſticity of the bliſter occaſioned the moſt violent excitement, and thereby counterbalanced every benefit which might have ariſen from its diſcharge, and indeed in a very long and extenſive practice I never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have ſeen more than <hi>two</hi> inſtances of the good effects of <hi>veſication</hi> to the head, one of which was in a <hi>phre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitic</hi> complaint where <hi>torpidity</hi> and <hi>langour</hi> had been brought on by profuſe evacuations, and the other in a <hi>maniacal affection,</hi> of ſome ſtanding, when the powers of nature had been debilitated by inanition. In the indiſcriminate uſes of <hi>epiſpaſtics</hi> to the head, for the cure of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0649400900:20"/>
               <hi>cerebral</hi> diſorders, particularly where an overfulneſs is already obvious, much miſchief may be apprehended from their ardent and powerfully ſtimulating influence. <hi>March</hi> 15th, the patient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo very raving and reſtleſs, that having no ſtrait waiſtcoat, nor uſing any ligatures to his arms and legs, it was as much as three people could keep him from getting out of bed, in which frantic and turbulent ſtate he continued until <hi>March</hi> 17th, when another <hi>emetic</hi> was adminiſtered, but with the ſame ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy as before. <hi>March</hi> 21ſt. The vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the diſorder ſeemed abated, and on that and the following day he was not ſo loud and raving as he had been for many days before but often muttered to himſelf, and appeared ſtupid, abſent,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0649400900:21"/>and muſing. <hi>March</hi> 23d, he continued more ſtill and quiet, but very low and melancholic, at any time ſcarcely ſpoke loud enough to be heard, and remained in this depreſſed ſtate until <hi>March</hi> 26, when he ſeemed to recover more or his uſual ſpirits, and was at times tolerably conſiſtent and rational. <hi>March</hi> 27th, his former ſymptoms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring, my advice and attendance was thought neceſſary, and when with the moſt feeling anxiety and ſymphathetic concern, the whole of the foregoing account was recollected, and given me in detail, as far as her memory could aſſiſt her, by the afflicted mother of the patient, whom I found removed to a remote part of the houſe, and lodged in a darkened room, with an aſſiſtant on
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0649400900:22"/>each ſide the bed, for the purpoſe of coercion when neceſſary, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the length of his confinement, the violence of his diſorder, and the many relapſes to which he had been ſubject, he had not that morbid or ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated appearence which might have been expected. Approaching to the bedſide, I did not at firſt ſeem to attract his attention, but after ſpeaking to him he turned round, and in a low deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, ſaid, <q>"He ſhould never be any better, but that I might do as I pleaſed with him, that his father was not able to provide for him, and that he had never been able to learn ſo quick as other boys;"</q> to which I made him the moſt conſolatory anſwers I could ſuggeſt, and ſoothed him as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0649400900:23"/>much as poſſible; at the ſame time aſſuring him of the great probability which I entertained of doing him good, and of getting him quite well, provided my rules and directions were punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed; by this means appearing to have gained his good opinion, he ſmiled, and ſeemed pleaſed; and to do my little patient juſtice, when in his ſenſes, and capable of ſo doing, he chearfully ſtrove to ſecond my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to aſſiſt him, by an implicit obedience to my advice and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Perceiving that he frequently made ſudden efforts to jump out of the bed, and that the attendants in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to reſtrain him, irritated him the more, I recommended the uſe of a ſtrait waiſtcoat, which I had brought
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0649400900:24"/>with me for that purpoſe, and which was uſed before I left the houſe, and continued occaſionally to the end of the cure. From the firſt beginning of his diſorder, his appetite had been much depraved: upon examination I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſmall degree of tenſion about the <hi>epigaſtric region;</hi> but not attended with any pain, nor had there been the leaſt degree of inflammation in the ſtomach or bowels; his breath had at times been fetid, but not extremely ſo, and was now rather offenſive; the urine had been ſometimes high coloured, and at others pale and limpid; but had never been obſerved to depoſit any kind of ſediment, and in general had been made in ſmaller quantities than was natural. His deglutition had been
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0649400900:25"/>obſerved to be more difficult, when under the paroxyſm of dejection, and in his moſt delirious ſtate, with a ſlight degree of deafneſs, moiſture of the eyes, dimneſs of ſight, and an involuntary diſcharge of tears, he talked much more inconſiſtent than when I firſt ſaw him, and complained of ſpectres and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dreams: often when at the beſt, I was informed, he appeared drowſy and ready to fall a ſleep, he had frequent eructationry, and his feet were remarked to have been alternately hot, dry, and cold, his eyes ſufficiently indicated the perturbed ſtate of his mind, their pupils were greatly diſtended, and the lids tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid and red, with a ſordid rheum adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the edges, his face was florid, but neither bloated nor ſwelled, he expreſſed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0649400900:26"/>ſome childiſhly ridiculous fears, appeared very forgetful, with a ſmall degree of ſtupor, and upon aſking him where he was moſt in pain, after two or three times waving his hand, as if in doubt, he at laſt pointed to his forehead, he appeared to have an equal degree of heat over the whole body, nor was there the leaſt augmentation thereof in his head and temples, he was naturally inclined to coſtiveneſs, and the ſtools he had had through the courſe of his diſorder, (when not procured by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,) where generally high coloured, and at the diſtance of two or three days; he had not the leaſt degree of fever, and the functions of his mind were apparently injured and deranged, he frequently changed his poſition in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0649400900:27"/>bed with an extraordinary degree of velocity and ſtrength, and was ſo little debilitated, that he appeared to have a greater ſhare of muſcular ſtrength, than in a healthy ſtate, is common to boys of his age. I obſerved that he ſeemed rather pleaſed in every opportunity to give his attendants freſh occaſion to watch and guard him, his reſpiration was not in the leaſt oppreſſed, and he had no ſickneſs at his ſtomach, his deep had been much interrupted, and ſeldom long continued, his ſweats had been partial, and never once either profuſe or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, chiefly in the night, and ſeldom continued more than a few minutes at a time; probably from the diſturbed ſtate of his mind, and the reſtleſſneſs of his body conſequent thereon. In the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0649400900:28"/>paroxyſms he had been ſometimes heard to grind and gnaſh his teeth; had never appeared thirſty, nor at any time had he drank with eagerneſs and voracity; his voice was much lower than its natural pitch, and ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of continued diſtinct articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The pulſe was low, at about ſixty, and ſcarcely perceptable, but though ſo low and weak, I conſidered it as a fallacious guide, and that its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate was a certain indication either of ſome obſtruction in the heart or lungs, or ſome degree of oppreſſion in the <hi>cerebellum.</hi> I was therefore fully ſatisfied with the expediency of taking away ſome blood as the beſt prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtep to the cure. Veneſection was accordingly performed, and about ſix
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0649400900:29"/>ounces of blood taken from the arm; immediately after which the vibrations of the artery were manifeſtly more diſtinct and ſomewhat accelerated; the blood, when cold, was covered with a a very thin cake of gluten, adhered to the baſon, was very bilious, and the ſerum was of a yellowiſh color. Soon after the operation, the child ſpoke rationally for ſome time, ſeemed much leſs drowſy; was more inclined to ſleep, than he was before, but in about an hour relapſed into his former ſtate. I directed a ſeton to be made between the <hi>ſcapuloe</hi> in the direction of the ſpine; that his feet ſhould be frequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed in a warm pediluvium of ſalt and water, and with a view to induce perſpiration, that he ſhould often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0649400900:30"/>his head over the edge of an earthen veſſel, and receive the fumes of warm vinegar and water; that he ſhould be reſtrained by the uſe of the waiſtcoat, as occaſion ſhould require; and be talked to as little as poſſible. Conſidering the <hi>proximate cauſe</hi> of his diſorder to ariſe from a turgency and detenſion in the <hi>cerebral</hi> veſſels, I recommended the diet to be cooling, plain and ſlender, with almoſt a total <hi>abſtinence</hi> from liquid food, that <hi>drinks</hi> of all ſorts ſhould be <hi>ſparingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;</hi> and in their ſtead directed roaſted apples, dried cherries, tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinds, or currant jelly, &amp;c. All objects, which engaged his attention, or excited the leaſt emotion, were to be removed, with a view to keep his mind calm
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0649400900:31"/>and placid; ſo that all mental irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation being taken off, the aptitude of frantic paroxyſm might be leſſened. He was ordered to abſtain from all flatulent, viſcid, and groſs food, to have more air, and even exerciſe, when it could be admitted. As <hi>emetics</hi> had been ſo repeatedly tried without effect, and were thought hazardous, as they force too great a quantity of blood to the head, I objected to their uſe, and preſcribed a <hi>ſaline purgative</hi> mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with the infuſion and tincture of ſena, to be taken until evacuations ſhould be procured. Laxatives were continued occaſionally to prevent coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs, and having in many inſtances experienced the efficacy and good effects of <hi>camphor</hi> in ſimilar diſorders,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0649400900:32"/>as may be ſeen in my late publication of SELECT CASES OF INSA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY, I preſcribed as follows,</p>

On the day after my viſit, <hi>March</hi> 28th, I was informed the patient had paſſed a tolerable eaſy night and had derived the expected re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from the purgative medicine. <hi>March</hi> 29th, he had ſome ſickneſs at the ſtomach, which was attributed to the <hi>camphor,</hi> on which account the julep was directed to be given in leſs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, and not ſo often, <hi>March</hi> 30th, the report was ſtill more favourable, he was more rational, and talked with recollection and propriety, but was ſubject to remitting pains in his head. <hi>March</hi> 31ſt, he became very low, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and was in every reſpect in a ſtate ſimilar to that at the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0649400900:34"/>of his complaint. <hi>April</hi> 1ſt, he was tolerably rational; but complained of his head, with depreſſion of ſpirits, and cried very much, ſaid <q>"nobody loved him, and that he ſhould not be happy in a future ſtate."</q>
               <hi>April</hi> 2d. having paſſed a very indifferent night, he was attacked with cold ſhiverings and yawning, cried very much, and intreated his mother to come, which ſhe did; but his diſtreſs and anxiety continued the ſame as before. The ſeton began to diſcharge plentifully, in the afternoon, his head was eaſier, he appeared better, and the depreſſions were of much ſhorter duration than they had been. <hi>April</hi> 3d, he had a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable good night, and was ſtill more rational and quiet than the day before;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0649400900:35"/>upon the whole, there appeared a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable chance of ſucceſs by a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the plan firſt laid down. <hi>April</hi> 4th, after a tolerable night, early in the morning the depreſſion returned, his feet being damp and cold, the <hi>pedilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium</hi> was uſed; he had no occaſion for opening medicines, having had fecal evacuations regularly once, and ſometimes twice, on the three preceding days; the urine had continued its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per courſe. <hi>April</hi> 5th, the urine was very high coloured, without ſediment, or fever, the belly regular, pulſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty. The diſcharge from the ſeton was little, but from the iſſue much increaſed; in the night he was rather reſtleſs, with ſlight wanderings of the mind, but more rational in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0649400900:36"/>The regimen continued to be punctually obſerved, and the patient was carried out in the open air up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of an hour. <hi>April</hi> 6th, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of his belly, and was obſerved to rub and pick his noſe, with ſome degree of lowneſs, a ſudden loſs of voice, and paleneſs of countenance; he complained of nauſea at his ſtomach, his breath was unuſually fetid, in the night, he was very watchful, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent in his expreſſions, and had troubleſome dreams, with evident marks of indigeſtion. <hi>April</hi> 7th, he was much the ſame all day, the night was reſtleſs and uneaſy, the fetor of the breath continuing, with pricking ſenſations of the abdomen and a frequent irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to ſtool, induced an idea of worms
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0649400900:37"/>being the cauſe; but as the excrements had never appeared white or ſlimy, and none had ever been voided by ſtool; that they really did exiſt was a matter of doubt; however, from the foregoing evidence, I thought it adviſeable to try the <hi>mercurius ſaccharatus</hi> of the Ebinburgh Diſpenſatory; both as a good evacuant, and a ſafe <hi>vermifuge;</hi> this medicine after being taken twice, occaſioned two dejections within the ſpace of a few hours; but no worms, nor any thing of a <hi>verminous</hi> nature appearing in the ſtools, and the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms which had given riſe to this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſtill continuing, the more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to diſlodge them, if they did exiſt; I preſcribed one grain of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0649400900:38"/>
               <hi>gum gut. gamb.</hi> with half a grain of <hi>calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,</hi> and an additional proportion of <hi>ſaccharum,</hi> made into the form of a powder, to be exhibited at proper pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, beſides which, I directed ſome garlic to be cut ſmall, and between whiles to be given in milk, but neither of theſe remedies producing the leaſt appearance of worms, and the patient being apparently not ſo well in many reſpects as before, he diſcontinued his former regimen and medicines. <hi>April</hi> 11th. They were had recourſe to again, the purgative medicine being directed to be intermitted as uſual—we had now a partial ſuppreſſion of urine, which was ſoon removed by mild diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics.—It was an obſervation made by thoſe about him, that he was
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0649400900:39"/>always more in his ſenſes, and that his head was always cleareſt when there was a plenty of urine, and that this had been the caſe from the commencement of his diſorder; it was therefore a ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom which more particularly required an alleviation, and was removed without much difficulty by ſmall doſes of the <hi>ſpiritus nitri dulcis</hi> in <hi>parſley-root tea,</hi> and to the prevention of which the warm pediluvium, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly continued, did in great meaſure contribute. <hi>April</hi> 12th, he appeared much better in every reſpect, his mind was ſettled and quiet, and he was taken into the air, and except ſome flatulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in the ſtomach, paſſed the day in a much more rational manner than at any time before; but in the evening was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0649400900:40"/>again very low, ſighed much, and was incongruous in his ſpeech and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but not turbulently ſo, he ſlept but little all that night, and the next morning appeared drowſy and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited, which was in great meaſure attributed to taking cold in his airing the day before. <hi>April</hi> 13th. After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had a tolerable good night he got up and dreſſed, walked about the room and was very rational; the ſeton which before had been very fore and painful, diſcharged more and became eaſier; having had no ſtool for two days, the purgative medicine was given and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated at proper diſtances, but not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its uſual effect in the evening, an emollient clyſter was adminiſtered, which produced ſtools of a fetid and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0649400900:41"/>looſe kind, and he had this night a more general and long continued per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration than at any time before during his illneſs; but was at intervals watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and reſtleſs. <hi>April</hi> 14th, he was very ſenſible, and at his own requeſt again taken out into the air for ſome conſiderable time, continued tolerably rational all day; but in the evening was again depreſſed and low, wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his converſation from one ſubject to another, and complained of pain and weight in his head. The warm <hi>pedilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium</hi> was made uſe of for half an hour before, and at bed-time, the <hi>camphora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted julep</hi> was given, his ſleep was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently interrupted with terrifying dreams, he had no ſtool, and in the morning awoke very ſorrowful and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0649400900:42"/>low, and continued in that ſtate through the greateſt part of the day. <hi>April</hi> 15th, he was much the ſame, in the forenoon he took twice of the camphorated <hi>julep,</hi> and in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon once of the laxative medicine, which had no effect; he had little or no appetite, appeared much out of temper, and at times talked wild and inconſiſtently; in the evening a clyſter was given, which ſoon after returned without doing any ſervice. The night was paſſed in watchfulneſs, and much interrupted by frightful dreams. <hi>April</hi> 16th, he appeared much clearer in his intellects, but complained of pain in his head, with a tenſion of the <hi>abdomen</hi> and difficult reſpiration; the <hi>oleum ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cini</hi> was therefore preſcribed inſtead of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0649400900:43"/>the former purgative, the ſecond doſe of which procured a ſtool ſoon after it was taken; but he was not able to paſs any water, nor had he made a drop for the laſt four and twenty hours. The <hi>ſpiritus nitri dulcis</hi> was therefore again directed to be taken in a cupful of <hi>parſley-root tea,</hi> till he made water freely—he continued calm all the day, but not very rational, and had rather a better night than before. <hi>April</hi> 17th, he was very low, ſpoke but little, and at times was rather abſurd in his actions and behaviour; continued ſo all the day, and paſſed but a very indifferent night. <hi>April</hi> 18th, he had a free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and had no occaſion for either the drops or oil. <hi>April</hi> 19th, he was very compoſed and conſiſtent; the feet were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0649400900:44"/>continued to be immerſed in the warm <hi>pediluvium,</hi> and continued moiſt and warm; he perſpired during his ſleep, which was longer and but little interrupted; and made water freely; it was of a reddiſh colour, and depoſited alight ſediment. <hi>April</hi> 19th and 20th, he continued in a comfortable ſtate, had good nights, and his appetite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. <hi>April</hi> 21ſt he was very low, and complained of his head, and having had no ſtool for three days, a ſpoonful of the oil was given him, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the purpoſe ſoon after it was taken; his head was relieved, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued cool and rational all the day, and had a very good night. <hi>April</hi> 22d, At his own particular requeſt he was placed in a little carriage for ſeveral
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0649400900:45"/>hours, drawn about in the air, and was indulged in every little amuſement that could be thought of; but with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution, that the <hi>mental faculty</hi> ſhould not be permitted to dwell too long at a time on any object whatever; he now began to ſpeak and play about in his uſual manner, and with more vivacity, it was obſerved, than before his diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der took place. He wiſhed to ride on horſeback, but for the preſent it was thought improper, and he patiently acquieſced in that opinion. As the ſingularity of his caſe excited much cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, many perſons had a deſire to ſee him, but none were admitted ſo to do, but thoſe he had been previouſly acquainted with—if by chance he ſaw
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0649400900:46"/>any ſtrangers, it was remarked that the ſight of them did not hurry and agitate his mind ſo much as it had done in the former part of his complaint. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in a quiet and rational ſtate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame regulation of diet and medicine as before enjoined, until <hi>May</hi> 10, when after an indifferent night, very early in the morning he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attacked with his former unaccountable lowneſs of ſpirits and melancholic ideas, his mind became alternately agitated with fear and ſorrow, ſuſpicion and ſolicitude, and continued ſo all the day, having had no regular ſtools for the laſt two days; ſome of the oil was given, the firſt doſe of which had no effect; the ſecond anſwered the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but from this as well as ſome
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0649400900:47"/>ſleep which he got in the firſt part of the night, he derived but little benefit. The <hi>pediluvium</hi> and <hi>camphorated julep</hi> were continued regularly, and <hi>May</hi> 12th he appeared much more tranquil, but complained of pain in the lower bowels, which was removed by a ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating clyſter, after two doſes of the oil had been tried in vain. <hi>May</hi> 13th, he was affected with a pain in his head, and his eyes being ſlightly inflamed, and the lids rather ſwelled and red, by my direction a ſurgeon was ſent for to bleed him, who at firſt objected to the operation, on account of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his pulſe; but at the requeſt of the mother, through reſpect to my advice, his opinion was overruled, and he took away about <hi>twelve
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0649400900:48"/>ounces of blood;</hi> he bled very ſlow, and did not appear to miſs the blood at all; until his arm was binding up, when he turned pale, his lips became white, and he was all over in perſpiration, but ſoon recovered without fainting. The pulſe, after bleeding, was obſerved to be more manifeſt to the touch, ſtronger, and rather more accelerated. Upon enquiry, I found the blood had a ſlight <hi>buffy</hi> appearance, and by way of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity upon being divided and put into ſcales, the <hi>craſſamentum</hi> weighed <hi>ſix ounces and three quarters,</hi> and the <hi>ſerum five ounces and a half:</hi> an experiment made to pleaſe the fancy, and for the ſatisfaction of the mother of the patient. The ſeton had diſcharged little, but the iſſue very much, which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0649400900:49"/>had been the caſe all along; after bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he paſſed the night well, and was tolerably well all the next day. <hi>May</hi> 15th, he was rather low and inconſiſtent in his diſcourſe, having had no ſtool the uſual quantity of oil was given and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, but without effect. <hi>May</hi> 16th, he was not ſo low as yeſterday and more conſiſtent, but having made no water all the former day and night, the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of it was relieved as uſual by the <hi>drops</hi> and <hi>parſley-root tea. May</hi> l7th, he was very dull, talked but little, and ſeemed not much to attend to external objects. <hi>May</hi> 18th. Having paſſed a very good night, and having had a natural ſtool in the morning, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared much better in every reſpect, and was very tractable, ſtill, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0649400900:50"/>all day. <hi>May</hi> 19th, he appeared quite comfortable and happy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ride on horſeback, which by my direction was agreed to. At the ſame time I adviſed, that he ſhould receive every admiſſible gratification. From this time, he continued rational in his converſation, and conſiſtent in his behaviour; but was frequently too high-ſpirited, and ſometimes rather troubleſome to rule, and it was not without the interpoſition of ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that he was prevailed on to perſevere in any part of the <hi>regimen</hi> which had been before enjoined; for having recovered his liberty, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the indulgent partiality na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally reſulting from the joy of the parent, whoſe tendereſt feelings had
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0649400900:51"/>been ſo long exerciſed on his account, and as he got better, the diet having been allowed to be more liberal and nutritious, though ſmall in quantity and gradually increaſed, he began to conſider every reſtraint with more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience—although in general he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to order tolerably well. On account of ſudden ſlight inflammation and itching in his right eye, it was thought adviſable to repeat the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>ſeventh of June,</hi> from which time every diſtreſſing and tumultuary motion ſubſided, and he has continued without interruption in the full pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his mental faculties, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and grateful acknowledgment of his worthy and reſpectable family. The ſeton was dried up ſoon after the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0649400900:52"/>laſt bleeding, but the iſſue in the arm has been kept open. It is very ſingular that ever ſince his recovery he has been much more chearful and ſprightly, and not in the leaſt ſubject to that lowneſs and dejection of ſpirits which had always before been conſidered as naturally attached to his temper and diſpoſition.</p>

            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0649400900:54"/>
            <p>A man about Forty-eight years of age, naturally of a melancholic tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without any apparent cauſe, on a ſudden, became ſullen, reſerved, and moroſe, ſhewed a great propenſity to ſuicide, and his mind gradually ſunk into the moſt diſtreſsful ſtate of dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and melancholy; his memory was very defective, the lucid intervals were of ſhort and momentary duration, his appetite was depraved there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipation of the bowels, he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very deaf, was ſubject to eructa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with involuntary motion of the eyes; his countenance was pallid, and his face bloated and ſwelled, he had often the moſt ridiculous fears and apprehenſions, and now and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of a pain as though a nail were
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0649400900:55"/>driven into his head, with an uneaſineſs in the right hypochondrium, which upon examination appeared rather hard and ſwelled; he had taken ſeveral vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and had a bliſter to the head with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving the leaſt advantage from either, he had never been in the leaſt reſtrained from fluids, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſuffered to indulge in the free uſe of thoſe, to which he was moſt partial; when he was placed under my care, the pulſe was in general about eighty, rather weak and ſmall, but became evidently ſtronger and greater, after the effuſion of ſix ounces of blood from the arm; evacuating cathartics were preſcribed occaſionally, a ſeton was opened between the ſhoulders in the direction of the ſpine; and Ten grains of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0649400900:56"/>camphor were adminiſtered in a bolus, four times in a day. <hi>Abſtinence from fluids</hi> was obſerved with the greateſt care and circumſpection, their quantities being gradually abridged, and almoſt totally left off for nearly five months ſucceſſively according to <hi>Dr. Rowley's ſyſtem,</hi> at the end of which period there remained not the leaſt incongruity of idea, his perception was clear, and his judgment as ſound as at any former period of his life, he voluntarily conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with me ſome months after the cure, and has ever ſince retained the full enjoyment of his health and reaſon.</p>
            <p>A YOUNG lady about the age of twenty ſeven, naturally of a habit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to inflammatory diſorders, whoſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0649400900:57"/>mother had unfortunately been ſubject to <hi>chronic</hi> madneſs, was ſuddenly ſeized with a rigor ſucceeded by an acute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory fever, a quick full and tenſe pulſe, great heat, thirſt, and acute pains in the head, back and loins, and ſlight deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, with dimneſs of ſight, to moderate the febrile ſymptoms veneſection, cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>diaphoretics</hi> and diluting drinks were preſcribed. On the ninth day from the attack, looſe ſtools and turbid urine, confirmed the criſis of the diſorder, and the more violent ſymptoms conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſubſiding, the <hi>cortex</hi> took place as a tonic, and ſhe was thought to be in a promiſing ſtate of convaleſcence, but an anxiety and ſolicitude of mind very unuſual to her before her illneſs, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening ſerved as a confirmation to her
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0649400900:58"/>friends of her being in the full poſſeſſion of the morbid patrimony of her mother, her appetite was depraved, her pulſe quick and hard, and her breath was uncommonly hot and offenſive, ſhe talked wild, and with almoſt inceſſant vociferation, got but little ſleep, with leſs perſpiration, expreſſed falſe fears, and often deſcribed images which did not exiſt, ſhe often ſhuddered with cold, and was afterwards hot and thirſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, after a continuation in this phrenetic ſtate for ſeveral days, ſhe was committ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my care. I found ſhe had been ſuffered to drink copiouſly of diluting liquors, the ſerous veſſels were tinged with red blood, the eye lids puffed and tumid, the <hi>tunica albuginea</hi> was red and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the pupils much diſtended, there
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0649400900:59"/>was an uncommon floridity of the face, a great diſcoloration of the tongue, and difficulty of reſpiration; at intervals ſhe became ſilent, reſerved, and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, at other times ſo obſtreperous and violent, as to render coercion abſolutely neceſſary, the pulſe was hard and <hi>cordlike,</hi> and about an hundred and twenty ſtrokes in a minute, <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectio ad deliquum</hi> was adviſed, the blood appeared to be in a very inflamed and diſordered ſtate, neutral ſalts were adminiſtered occaſionally, the warm <hi>pediluvium</hi> was directed every night before ſhe went to bed, camphor and nitre were given at ſtated intervals, and almoſt a <hi>total abſtinence</hi> from fluids, was enjoined for nearly two months, in which time veneſection was thrice
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0649400900:60"/>repeated; when the <hi>mental perturbation</hi> which was evidently dependent on the fever, and a type thereof, together with the primary cauſe terminated fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably, ſhe ſtaid with me ſome months after the cure, had no relapſe, and has remained perfectly clear in her intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects ever ſince.</p>
