            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE following <hi>Eſſay</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to inſtruct all ſober and ſerious Perſons, how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, or regain their Health; but chiefly to direct and relieve my <hi>Fellow-ſufferers,</hi> the <hi>Scorbutic, Gouty, Conſumptive,</hi> or <hi>Nervous</hi> Valetudinarian-low-livers; to make them paſs their Lives the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, the <hi>Degree</hi> of their Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, the <hi>Time</hi> of Life, the <hi>Nature</hi> of Things, and the ſecret Orders of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> will permit. And ſince they muſt be deprived, in ſome Degree, of the <hi>groſſer</hi> ſenſual Pleaſures; ſince all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and <hi>intelligent</hi> Beings are made for Happineſs, will by mere <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> ſeek it <hi>ſome-how,</hi> and ſome-where; ſince their neceſſary <hi>Low-living</hi> will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0412800400:5"/>
(in time at leaſt) make them <hi>high-ſpirited,</hi> and their <hi>intellectual Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> more acute, <hi>penetrating,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate</hi>; I have endeavour'd, by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> to ſupply them with ſome ſuitable <hi>Entertainments</hi> and <hi>Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> ſuch as I have often agreeably diverted my leiſure Hours with.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>True Philoſophy</hi> is the <hi>Science</hi> of living the moſt happily, through the whole <hi>Period</hi> of our Exiſtence, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things will permit; <hi>Phyſic</hi> is but one Branch of this <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and regards but one part of our Compoſition, and but for a ſmall <hi>Period</hi> of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <hi>True Philoſophy</hi> takes in the whole Extent of our Being, from its moſt diſtant Beginning, to its moſt advanced Stages, poſſible or conceiveable. True Phyſic is that only which directs how the Body may be preſerved the moſt <hi>health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> the intellectual Organs depending on the Body the moſt acute, the <hi>Senſes</hi> the moſt perfect, and the <hi>Limbs</hi> the moſt

active; not for a while only, and by Fits and Starts, but uniformly, as long as <hi>they</hi> were made to laſt, and as the <hi>original</hi> Frame and Texture will permit: Any thing leſs than this, is but as a Part to the Whole; an imperfect and unfiniſh'd <hi>Sketch</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Phyſic,</hi> their Theory and <hi>Principles,</hi> was intended by the following <hi>Eſſay</hi> and <hi>Diſcourſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They were compoſed at different Times, and on different Occaſions; but one general <hi>Scheme,</hi> and one manner of <hi>free philoſophizing,</hi> and <hi>eaſy Conjectur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> runs through them all; one, to wit, where the fundamental <hi>Truth,</hi> or <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> in general, is ſuppos'd either <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, reveal'd,</hi> or already <hi>demonſtrated.</hi> But the <hi>Why?</hi> the <hi>final Cauſes,</hi> the <hi>moral Conſequences,</hi> and the particular <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail,</hi> is only here conjectured about, from probable or <hi>philoſophic Principles.</hi> This neceſſarily makes them more <hi>looſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded,</hi> and <hi>immethodical,</hi> and the
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0412800400:7"/>
ſame things to be often repeated. But I had neither <hi>Leiſure, Reliſh,</hi> nor <hi>Strength of Application,</hi> to remedy theſe Faults; it would have coſt me more <hi>Trouble</hi> than the firſt <hi>Compoſure.</hi> All I could obtain of myſelf, was to make a ſhort, more diſtinct <hi>Abſtract</hi> of the whole, and join a few <hi>Explications,</hi> to prevent <hi>Cavil,</hi> and all <hi>Miſtakes</hi> not wilful and diſingenuous, if poſſible.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I am very ſenſible, by this Work, I ſhall make myſelf obnoxious to two very different kinds of Men, the <hi>Stiff, Rigid,</hi> and <hi>Preciſe</hi>; and the <hi>Licentious, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded, Spurious, Free-Thinkers.</hi> The <hi>firſt,</hi> very probably, will cenſure my <hi>Conjectures</hi> and <hi>Sentiments,</hi> as <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,</hi> and <hi>preſumptuous,</hi> and <hi>myſelf,</hi> as being <hi>wiſe above what is written,</hi> and arrogantly prying into the <hi>Secrets</hi> of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit Wiſdom. It is very poſſible I may have been <hi>faulty,</hi> in this particular. I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that ſome even undoubted <hi>Truths,</hi> that may hurt the <hi>Weak,</hi> ought to be concealed,

or enjoy'd only in ſecret; the ſame Degrees of <hi>Light</hi> not being equally <hi>luminous</hi> and <hi>perceptive</hi> to all Eyes.

               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0412800400:9"/>
before I had publiſhed them. But, on the contrary, I hoped they might agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably entertain my <hi>Valetudinarian,</hi> who being placed by his low Health, in the <hi>middle State,</hi> between both <hi>Worlds,</hi> the <hi>old</hi> and the <hi>new,</hi> muſt unavoidably, at ſome times, <hi>figure</hi> to himſelf ſome ſort of a <hi>Map</hi> of the next World. I was therefore willing to try to <hi>illuminat</hi> it, the beſt I could, and to trace ſome of the <hi>Out-lines</hi> of the <hi>Paſſages</hi> from <hi>this</hi> to <hi>that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>; by endeavouring to <hi>illuſtrat,</hi> from not ſo common a Set of <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> ſome great and fundamental <hi>Truths,</hi> eſtabliſh'd on more <hi>popular Proofs,</hi> viz. that there is no Poſſibility of Happineſs here or hereafter, without <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Life</hi>; and that the true <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the preſent <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> both in <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Revelation,</hi> is the Difficulty of recovering this <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Heart and Life,</hi> to its utmoſt Perfection, in free <hi>lapſed</hi> Intelligences, conſiſtent with their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and the <hi>Harmony</hi> of the Divine Attributes,

which infinit <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> will not, I might ſay, cannot, counter act.</p>

All I have to ſay is, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps my Manner of explaining ſome great and fundamental Truths, and a few of the Conſequences I draw by my <hi>Method,</hi> may be defective: And perhaps, from ſome of the <hi>Links</hi> being dropt, and from Faults in the <hi>wording,</hi> the <hi>Chain</hi> of the Reaſoning may not be always <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>ſtrong</hi>; but I am ſure the <hi>Foundation</hi> is <hi>ſolid</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> and allow'd to be ſuch by all <hi>true Philoſophers</hi>; and without it, all <hi>general</hi> and <hi>abſtracted</hi> Reaſoning (on theſe <hi>imperceptible</hi> Subjects) muſt be vain; I mean, without admitting <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy:</hi> For without ſuppoſing the Evidence and Probability of it, (it being in <hi>Things</hi> only, what <hi>Proportion</hi> is in <hi>Numbers,</hi> and its <hi>Progreſſions</hi> being only

Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians</hi> well know, that there are ſeveral different <hi>Methods</hi> of inveſtigating the ſame Propoſitions in <hi>Algebra</hi> and <hi>Geometry</hi>; and there is ſcarce a <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,</hi> but has his own <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation.</hi> The ſame Concluſions, drawn from different demonſtrated <hi>Truths,</hi> give a ſenſible <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and a ſtronger <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi> to an honeſt Heart, and a Lover of Truth; and I could not but be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the <hi>Univerſality, Simplicity,</hi> and <hi>Luminouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Method</hi> of

<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:0412800400:49"/>
of the juſteſt Accounts of theſe early Times. 2. That he would thereby conſtantly enjoy a <hi>clear</hi> Head, <hi>calm,</hi> at leaſt <hi>governable</hi> Paſſions, a Facility in <hi>intellectual</hi> Applications, and in the Acquiſition of Virtue; and ſo having a longer Duration ſecur'd to him, and all Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments removed, he might make ſurprizing and wonderful Advances in <hi>both.</hi> 3. He would thereby be ſecur'd againſt all the great <hi>atrocious</hi> and <hi>frightful</hi> Diſtempers, ſuch as <hi>Melancholy, Lowneſs</hi> of <hi>Spirits, Wrong-headedneſs, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy</hi> and <hi>Madneſs</hi> (the Bane of the fineſt, beſt and moſt penetrating Spirits in <hi>Great Britain</hi>).

Solution of this infinitely difficult <hi>Problem,</hi> but one worthy of its all-wiſe and all-powerful Author only; and this he has effected, I think, by theſe three Expedients or Means. 1. By continuing <hi>general Laws</hi> of Agency in mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, moral and ſpiritual Actions, plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that the Concurrence of the ſame Cauſes and Conditions will always produce the ſame Effects; and ſo leaving Room for Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, Amendment, Improvment, Choice, and the Diſcernment of moral Good and Evil, and thus ſecuring <hi>Liberty</hi> and the other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Powers of lapſed Intelligences. 2. By tying down, ſopiting and ſuſpending the <hi>natural Powers</hi> of the Soul for ſo long a Time, as is its Duration from the firſt original <hi>Male,</hi> till the Bonds and Chains, by which their Exertion is reſtrained, be broken and untyed by Death.

By the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of <hi>Redemption</hi> by a <hi>Saviour,</hi> which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs was projected before the Creation of the World, or this Syſtem, and when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

               <p>§. 2. 1. WHATEVER be the true, <hi>primoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,</hi> and laſt Principle of Bodies, beyond which it is impoſſible to <hi>analyſe</hi> or divide them, theſe are inconteſtably found in all <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> and <hi>vegetable</hi> Bodies, as has been before obſerv'd: 1. <hi>Sulphur,</hi> Oil or material Heat, from whence Spirit and Activity. 2. <hi>Salt,</hi> or hard angular Particles highly attractive, and diſſolvable in Water. 3. <hi>Air,</hi> or ſmall elaſtic Particles. 4. <hi>Water</hi> or <hi>Phlegm,</hi> from whence alone Fluidity: And, laſtly, <hi>Earth,</hi> the Baſe and <hi>Subſtratum</hi> of theſe others. In the due and proportional Union of theſe, do the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and Difference of animal Subſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. Now it is paſt all Doubt in Philoſophy, and in philoſophical <hi>Chemy,</hi> that <hi>animal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> of moſt kinds, poſſeſs in a much greater Proportion the <hi>two firſt</hi> of theſe Principles, <hi>viz. Salts</hi> and <hi>Oils,</hi> than <hi>Vegetables,</hi> which partake more of the laſt, <hi>viz.

The <hi>Jelly,</hi> the Juice or Chyle of <hi>animal</hi> Subſtances, is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0412800400:150"/>
infinitely more tenacious and glewy <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Memoirs of the Academy Royal for 1729 and 1730.</note>, and its laſt Particles more cloſely united, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with greater Difficulty, than thoſe of <hi>vegetable</hi> Subſtances. This is evident from the Experiments made with them in joining of Wood, and is known to all <hi>Artificers,</hi> and may be made manifeſt to the Senſes in the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Tenacity of <hi>Camp-jelly,</hi> or <hi>Fiſh-glew,</hi> and that of Paſte made of Flower or Barley; or from the Strength of <hi>Ropes</hi> or <hi>Cords</hi> made of <hi>Cat-gut</hi> or <hi>Leather,</hi> and thoſe made of <hi>Tow</hi> or <hi>Hemp,</hi> of the ſame <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter:</hi> And therefore <hi>animal Food</hi> muſt much ſooner, more ſtrongly, and irremediably make Viſcidities in <hi>animal</hi> Fluids, and more <hi>ſchir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly</hi> obſtruct the <hi>Capillaries</hi> and <hi>Glands,</hi> than vegetable Subſtances. 3. But the far more pernicious and deſtructive Part, is the <hi>Salts,</hi> and <hi>Oil,</hi> abounding more in moſt <hi>animal</hi> than in <hi>vegetable</hi> Subſtances; of which there are ſo many and convincing Demonſtrations, that none can have any Doubt of it, that has the leaſt Acquaintance with natural <hi>Philoſophy:</hi> For our Blood and Juices being nouriſh'd and ſupply'd by ſuch <hi>Subſtances,</hi> as abound moſt with theſe active <hi>elementary</hi> Principles, muſt neceſſarily be ſtored and ſaturated with <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Sulphurs</hi>; and theſe, being always in a

State of <hi>Action,</hi> are the true, original, and the moſt adequate Cauſes of the moſt excru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating Diſtempers. 4. When to theſe, <hi>ſtrong, fermented</hi> and <hi>ſpirituous</hi> Liquors are added as a Vehicle, or diluting Mixture, and join to the <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Sulphurs</hi> of animal Subſtances, not only their <hi>inflammable</hi> Spirits and <hi>tartar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Salts, but their condenſing and hardening Quality on the Food in the Stomach, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion is by that means hindered and ſtopped, and the Food not being ſufficiently divided and comminuted, but broken only into groſs Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, does more quickly and obſtinately thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Juices, and obſtruct the <hi>Glands</hi> and <hi>Capillaries,</hi> than <hi>vegetable</hi> Subſtances. 5. Animal Juices and Subſtances, before they were turned into Fleſh, muſt have been ſtrain'd through infinitely ſmaller and more numerous <hi>Tubes,</hi> ſuch as the laſt and extreme <hi>Capillaries</hi> are (ſome of which are not bigger than the <hi>ſix hundredth part</hi> of an Hair); by which Means their Particles muſt be render'd extremely ſmaller and finer, and conſequently have a much greater Degree of <hi>Attraction,</hi> than thoſe of Vegetables, which paſs through fewer <hi>Strainers,</hi> and have no other motive Powers but the <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi>; whereas thoſe of animal Subſtances have, beſides the <hi>Sun,</hi> the Force of <hi>muſcular</hi> Digeſtion, and of the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heart; the Fleſh of Animals, I ſay, muſt, upon this Account, neceſſarily conſiſt of ſmaller
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0412800400:152"/>
Particles, and ſo be united with a greater Force, and endow'd with a greater Degree of <hi>Attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and conſequently muſt, with far greater Difficulty, be digeſted and ſeparated, than <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable</hi> Subſtances poſſibly can. And hence it is that <hi>carnivorous</hi> Animals are much more <hi>deleterious</hi> Food, being endow'd with much finer and more pungent <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> than thoſe Animals that live on <hi>Vegetables</hi> only, as both the higher <hi>Savour</hi> and delete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Effects of the firſt abundantly ſhew. From all which it is plain to a Demonſtration, that animal Subſtances muſt naturally and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily <hi>incraſſate</hi> the Juices, and produce <hi>Obſtructions</hi> in the <hi>Glands</hi> and <hi>Capillaries,</hi> and conſequently create Pains and Diſeaſes, much more readily than vegetable Subſtances. 6. It is plain by Weight, that the Subſtance of moſt animal Food is ſpecifically heavier than that of moſt <hi>Vegetables</hi> commonly uſed for Food, ſometimes in the Proportion of three to two. The <hi>Fibres</hi> and Juices of animal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are not only more compact and cloſely united, and have fewer <hi>Vacuities</hi> than thoſe of Vegetables, whereby the digeſtive Powers have leſs Difficulty in concocting and grinding equal Quantities of <hi>Vegetable</hi> than <hi>animal Food</hi>; but by the leſs <hi>Flavour</hi> and <hi>Savour</hi> of vegetable than animal Food, the Appetite is ſooner ſatisfied, and is under leſs Temptation to Exceſs in the firſt than in the latter; and it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0412800400:153"/>
is conſequently better and ſooner digeſted, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated and ſecreted, eſpecially by tender and delicate digeſtive Powers, and ſo cannot ſo readily cauſe <hi>Viſcidities</hi> and <hi>Obſtructions. Laſtly,</hi> Infinite <hi>Experiment,</hi> and the beſt <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy,</hi> confirm to a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that thoſe Subſtances, which have leaſt of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> of <hi>Spirit, Oil,</hi> and hard pungent Particles, and moſt of ſoft Earth, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Air, are the fitteſt to circulate, and be ſecreted through animal Tubes, create leaſt Reſiſtance to the motive Powers, tear, rend, and wear out the <hi>Tubes</hi> themſelves leaſt, and form leſs obſtinate and powerful Obſtructions, in the ſmaller Veſſels; and conſequently, that <hi>vegetable</hi> Subſtances, which conſiſt of a leſs Proportion of <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Sulphurs, i. e.</hi> of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and fiery Particles, and of a greater Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Earth, Water and Air, <hi>i. e.</hi> of leſs active and cooler Particles, will be leſs ready to create Diſeaſes, and ſhorten Life, than an equal Quantity of animal Subſtances, which have all theſe in an <hi>inverted</hi> Proportion. In a Word, vegetable Subſtances are more <hi>rare,</hi> leſs <hi>compact,</hi> leſs <hi>coherent,</hi> more eaſily diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable and digeſtible, turn into a lighter <hi>Chyle,</hi> have leſs <hi>Salt, Oil,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are leſs heating and inflaming, than animal Subſtances, and ſo obſtruct and tear animal Tubes leſs.</p>

A Piece of Meat will continue ſweet and ſound, for many Years in Wine or ſtrong Beer, or in any ſtrong fermented Liquor; the Liquor cementing and pinning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Parts of the Meat; and the ſame hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens when they are mixed in the Stomach; by which the <hi>Digeſtibility</hi> and eaſy Diſſolution of it, is obſtructed; ſo that in ſuch a Mixture <hi>Mutton</hi> is turned into <hi>Beef,</hi> and <hi>Beef</hi> into <hi>Shoe-Leather.</hi> 2. There is in ſtrong Liquors a criſping, corrugating, or <hi>cauſtic</hi> Quality workt on the Fibres, which burns and dries them up, and deſtroys their <hi>elaſtic</hi> and <hi>ductile</hi> Virtue, and conſequently renders them unfit to be broken and divided in the Stomach. This is evident from the Uſe commonly made of ſtrong Beer, as the beſt Plaiſter for <hi>Sprains, Relaxations</hi> and <hi>Strains</hi>; and that Brandy will really ſtop <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhages</hi> and Ruptures in the Blood-Veſſels,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0412800400:161"/>
by burning and wrinkling the tender Fibres and Capillaries, and ſo by this criſping Quality muſt keep Food from being readily and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly digeſted. 3. The Fire and Heat in ſtrong Liquors, by ſtimulating and twitching the <hi>Fibres</hi> and Coats of the Blood-Veſſels and Nerves, and conſequently bringing them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to quick and frequent <hi>Vibrations,</hi> and elaſtic Efforts, will break and tear the Fibres of the alimentary Tubes, and ſeparate their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Continuity, ſo as at laſt to wear out theſe Organs, at leaſt, much ſooner, and with greater Pain and Suffering, than Water or aqueous Liquors poſſibly can. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It is a common and well-known Experiment, that to <hi>ſtunt</hi> the Growth of young Animals, as Dogs and Cats, they need only be frequently rubbed over with Brandy, Rum, or any Spirit. This ſtops the <hi>Ductility</hi> and Extenſion of the young animal <hi>Fibres,</hi> that they cannot be dilated and develop'd by the Force of the Circulation, and ſo <hi>ſtunts</hi> their Growth. From all which it is plain, that ſtrong, but eſpecially <hi>ſpirituous</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, are really <hi>Poiſon</hi> to an animal Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and their ill Effects, not only in ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the Lives, but in ſtunting the Growth and Stature of the lower Rank of People, from the late frequent Uſe of Gin, Punch, and other ſpirituous Liquors, have become ſo fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant, as to call aloud for the juſt Indignation of the <hi>Legiſlature</hi>; and it is to be wiſhed, that an effectual Remedy may be found out for ſo
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0412800400:162"/>
deſtructive an Evil. And I am fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that the primary and original Deſign of the <hi>Author of Nature</hi> for the ſolid Food of Animals, was nothing but earthy Particles mixed with Water and Air, finely divided and cemented only, with the leaſt <hi>Oil</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as they are found in Seeds, Fruits, young Vegetables, and <hi>farinaceous</hi> or <hi>pulpous</hi> Roots, with Water only for Drink; which alone would make the Animal laſt the longeſt, and with the feweſt Pains and Diſeaſes. But this Diet muſt be only tried and begun with the <hi>Young,</hi> while their Fibres are tender and ſweet.</p>

                  <hi>human Fleſh,</hi> and feeding on brute animal Fleſh, except <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>Example.</hi> I believe ſome rational Creatures would ſuffer leſs in being fairly butcher'd, than a ſtrong <hi>Ox,</hi> or <hi>red Deer</hi>; and in natural <hi>Morality</hi> and Juſtice, the Degrees of Pain here, make the <hi>eſſential</hi> Difference; for as to other Differences, they are relative only, and can be of no Weight with an <hi>infinitely perfect Being.</hi> Did not <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> weaken this Terror, and make the Difference, Reaſon alone could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do it.

In that He provided the <hi>Liver,</hi> (the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and other internal <hi>Glands</hi>) in Animals, theſe vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrong, complicated and elabour'd <hi>Organs,</hi> to draw out the moſt poiſonous Parts of ſtrong Meats and Drinks: the ſtronger the <hi>Liver,</hi> and the larger that <hi>Organ</hi> grows, the more <hi>Bile</hi> it throws out on the <hi>Common-ſhoar,</hi> the <hi>Inteſtines,</hi> to deprive the Chyle of its churliſh Salts, and acrid <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> and thus makes the <hi>Liver</hi> an uſeful Medicine to promote the animal Functions, <hi>Digeſtion, Chylification,</hi> and the <hi>periſtaltic Motion,</hi> and then throw its uſeleſs Parts out of the Habit. 2. By the create<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mineral and ponderous Medicines, (<hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> chiefly) to open Obſtructions, break ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Concretions, and diſſolve the <hi>Tenacity</hi> of the <hi>Globules</hi> and <hi>Serum.</hi> And, 3. In providing <hi>mineral</hi> Waters of ſo various and complicated Natures, for the ſame Ends and Purpoſes, which they will, well-choſen, effect at laſt, as certainly as thoſe formerly mentioned. Now it is plain to a <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> that under a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Diet, all thoſe have little or no Uſe in Medicine; nay, any one who is acquainted with the Delicacy, Tenderneſs and Senſibility of the internal and infinitely minute Parts of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0412800400:175"/>
an animal Machine, muſt know that they are not only in a great Degree uſeleſs, but hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and tend to tear, diſſolve and deſtroy the infinitely minute Fibrils, of which the Solids of an <hi>animal Machin</hi> are formed: So that their final End and Deſign in Providence muſt have been to <hi>antidote</hi> the ill Effects of <hi>animal Food</hi> and ſtrong <hi>fermented Liquors,</hi> to a certain Degree, and for a certain Time, <hi>probably</hi> till ſome time after the Meridian of Life, while the Organs had attained their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Extenſion and Firmneſs; for it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that none of the Mineral Waters exiſted under the <hi>Form</hi> and in the Manner they now appear, till after the <hi>Deluge,</hi> the <hi>Aera</hi> of <hi>animal Food, fermented Liquors,</hi> and the <hi>ſhortneſs of Life.</hi>

Thirſt of Blood: To theſe and ſuch-like Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, (I cannot call them Objections) it may be anſwer'd, I. Firſt, That theſe Facts are not denied, but are of no Weight againſt the Propoſitions here chiefly aſſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That it is <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophically</hi> certain, that <hi>animal</hi> Food is in its own Nature more ready to produce Diſtempers than vegetable Food. 2. That it is therefore highly probable, that an infinitely good and wiſe Being would not appoint in his firſt Intention, <hi>animal</hi> but <hi>vegetable</hi> Food, at leaſt to his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent</hi> and rational Creation, and which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly is confirm'd from <hi>Revelation:</hi> And, 3. The chief Aſſertion here made, is, That in Conſequence of theſe two <hi>Propoſitions</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that <hi>vegetable</hi> Food, Seeds eſpecially, muſt be the proper <hi>Antidote,</hi> and Cure of the Diſeaſes brought on by <hi>animal</hi> Food. But, II. It may be conſider'd, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts, that this whole <hi>Creation,</hi> the whole <hi>Syſtem,</hi> but chiefly this our <hi>Globe,</hi> with all its Inhabitants, <hi>labours,</hi> and is under a <hi>mortal</hi> Diſtemper, and in <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,</hi> like a parturient Woman, to throw off this preſent <hi>Load of Corruption, Deteriority,</hi> and <hi>Lapſe,</hi> that it may regain its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal <hi>Spirituality, Purity,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>; it is at preſent in a State of <hi>Expiation, Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>progreſſive Perfection</hi>; every Thing is out of its natural Order, the <hi>Syſtem</hi> is, as it were, in a Fever, and every Part and Particle is in Action, (like the Body of a Man in a <hi>febrile Fermentation</hi>), to throw off its peccant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0412800400:177"/>
and to bring the whole Compound into <hi>Order, Regularity,</hi> and <hi>perfect Health.</hi> But, III. Theſe very Appearances on which the Objection is founded, confirm to a <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> what I aſſert, <hi>viz.</hi> That all <hi>animal</hi> Life here is in an <hi>expiatory, purifying,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive</hi> State, towards its original Perfection; for it would be the groſſeſt Contradiction, to ſuppoſe that an <hi>infinitely good</hi> and <hi>wiſe</hi> Being, ſhould give Pain to any of his Creatures, for any other End, but to reclaim and perfect them; that He alone knows when his <hi>Juſtice, Purity,</hi> and the <hi>Amende Honorable,</hi> and the Infection of Impurity, are perfectly anſwer'd and cancelled, in their preſent State of <hi>Melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and ſo knows when and how it is fitteſt to put an End to it by Death, that is, by the Rupture and Diſſolution of their groſs and earthy <hi>Priſon,</hi> form'd out of this our ruinous <hi>planetary Syſtem,</hi> now ſpoil'd and defac'd; to ſet the indwelling <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Inhabitant free into ſome more <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>refin'd Syſtem</hi>; and that <hi>animal</hi> Life of all Kinds and Degrees, does and muſt neceſſarily ſuffer here, by bodily Wants and Infirmities, by the Injuries and Inclemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>Seaſons,</hi> by the <hi>Rapacity</hi> and <hi>Ferocity</hi> of their Fellow-Creatures, beſides a thouſand other <hi>Accidents,</hi> and at laſt moſt intenſely by their Death, and the Rupture of their outward Shell or Tabernacle; From all this is a plain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that they are in a State of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Expiation, and progreſſive Purification, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0412800400:178"/>
that at laſt they will all be ſet at Liberty, and become the Sons and Children of God in ſome Degree or Order or other, according to his original Intention, and the Plan of this his univerſal <hi>Monarchy</hi> and Kingdom, laid before the Foundation of the World; and all this Darkneſs, Sufferings, and unintelligible Play, is only to ſave human Liberty, and produce at laſt <hi>pure Love</hi> and <hi>naked Faith.</hi> IV. No body ever denied, that <hi>Animals</hi> of all Kinds might be deſtroyed, even <hi>intelligent</hi> as well as <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi> when it is done for ſome wiſe or uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Purpoſe, as in <hi>Self-defence,</hi> or even for moral Purpoſes, implicitly to admoniſh and teach others their Duty, what they deſerve, or what they are to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>hope</hi>; theſe Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, with all their particular Circumſtances, are under the <hi>moral</hi> Government of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wiſe Being. The only <hi>Queſtion</hi> here is, Whether they may reaſonably and juſtly be put to <hi>Pain</hi> unneceſſarily and <hi>wantonly,</hi> or for no wiſe End or Purpoſe, but only to ſcratch <hi>callous</hi> Pallates, when other Means of Health may be had more effectual, and no leſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. V. It is not altogether <hi>Fact,</hi> that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals devour one another from any other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but for Want of ſufficient Plenty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vegetable Food, as Seeds, tender Plants, mealy Roots, and the like, which even the moſt <hi>carnivorous</hi> Animals will brouze on, when they can meet with it in Plenty, as is well known in <hi>natural Hiſtory</hi>; and even the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0412800400:179"/>
Fiſh, which of all Animals are the moſt <hi>vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> will readily feed on Balls of Meal and Milk, without offering to devour one another; as the <hi>ingenious</hi> Mr. <hi>Andrews</hi> of <hi>Norfolk</hi> has found by Experiment; for having put ſeveral Sorts of ſmall and great Fiſhes together into a large whiten'd <hi>Pond</hi> of clear Water, where they might all be eaſily ſeen and number'd, and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with Balls made of Milk and Flower, (which were put into pervious <hi>Troughs</hi>) he found, at leaſt thought, that they did not offer the leaſt Violence to one another. VI. Allowing Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals to be actuated by a ſpiritual or immaterial Principle, of the ſame <hi>Nature</hi> with intelligent Creatures, yet they are not of the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and Order with them; they may be <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent</hi> Creatures of an <hi>inferior Order,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning lower, and verging more ſlowly towards their intended Perfection; they may be under different Conditions of Purification, and may paſs the whole of their Duration here, in the State of <hi>Infants,</hi> who dye before they are born, or before they arrive at the Uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and yet in other States of Being may grow and advance to a much higher Perfection of <hi>Senſation</hi> and <hi>Intelligence</hi> than we can readily imagine. For to me it ſeems utterly incredible, that any Creature, whether <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient</hi> or <hi>intelligent,</hi> ſhould come into this <hi>State</hi> of Being and Suffering, for no other Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than we ſee them attain here; and it is equally incredible, that any Creature ſhould
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0412800400:180"/>
ſpontaneouſly exert animal and muſcular Func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſhould live and feel, without ſome Degree of an <hi>immaterial, immortal,</hi> and <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active</hi> Spirit. Matter and its Laws, can never account for ſuch Appearances. There muſt be ſome infinitely beautiful, wiſe and good <hi>Scene</hi> remaining for all <hi>ſentient</hi> and <hi>intelligent</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Diſcovery of which will raviſh and aſtoniſh us one Day. Moderately wiſe Ends, Purpoſes, and Means, are unworthy of infinite Perfection; whatever <hi>God</hi> does muſt be every way worthy of Himſelf: His <hi>Working</hi> may ſerve many wiſe and good Ends and Purpoſes here, but the laſt and great End of all muſt be of <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> worthy of Him, tho' we cannot yet a great while comprehend it.</p>

               <p>§. 12. To conclude: 1. It is plain from <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> that <hi>animal Food</hi> was <hi>permitted,</hi> and <hi>fermented Liquors</hi> not <hi>forbidden</hi>; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that there is neither <hi>Virtue</hi> nor <hi>Vice</hi> in the Uſe of them abſolutely, but in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Time, Quantity, and other Circumſtances of their Uſage. 2. That in our preſent <hi>Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> and under our preſent Circumſtances, for <hi>ſome</hi> Perſons, and in Order for <hi>ſome</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, a reaſonable Quantity of <hi>animal Food,</hi> and <hi>fermented Liquors,</hi> may be abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. 3.

That a moderate and ſmall Quantity of <hi>animal Food,</hi> and <hi>generous fermented Liquors,</hi> will naturally tighten, harden, and ſtrengthen, give Firmneſs and Force to animal Solids and Fibres, and enrich, warm, and invigorate the Blood and Juices; and conſequently, is ſafeſt to all ſubject to eruptive Diſtempers, as Gout, Eriſipelas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Fits.</hi> But at the ſame time that it hardens and tightens the Solids, it condenſes and thickens the Juices, and renders the Animal of a ſhorter <hi>Duration</hi> of Life, and more ſubject to <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. 6.

gradually and inſenſibly, and as the bodily and intellectual <hi>Organs</hi> are form'd; and that for this wiſe and gracious End, That the <hi>moral</hi> Powers and Virtues of the Soul may have <hi>Time, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Leiſure,</hi> by repeated <hi>Acts,</hi> to turn into <hi>Habits,</hi> and ſo all <hi>three</hi> may equally develop and extend together, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the <hi>natural</hi> and radical Powers, (which in their Capacity, and original <hi>Energy,</hi> are invariable) and the <hi>moral</hi> Attributes of the Soul, and their mechanical and material Organs. <hi>5thly,</hi> But what is in this Caſe a Demonſtration, is, that all the vital Functions and <hi>Senſations,</hi> are all perform'd by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> by the Intermediation only of Motions, <hi>Vibrations</hi> and Tremors, properly modify'd and impreſs'd by Bodies, or their <hi>Effluvia,</hi> on rightly diſpos'd <hi>membranous Tubuli, elaſtic</hi> Threads or Filaments; which Motions or <hi>Vibrations,</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> naturally, and by its own innate and <hi>radical</hi> Powers and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity, knows to denote the Preſence of ſuch and ſuch Bodies, and their Actions.

Blunders in the <hi>firſt,</hi> will ſometimes proceed from a different Cauſe from our Miſtakes in the <hi>latter.</hi> A wrong Head, want of Culture, and <hi>Precipitation,</hi> are generally the Cauſe of our Miſtakes in <hi>Geometry</hi> and <hi>Algebra</hi>; but in <hi>Analogy,</hi> eſpecially that <hi>Analogy</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the moral Attributes of the Divine Nature, the <hi>human</hi> Soul, the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble States, it is owing often to a wrong <hi>Heart, Pride,</hi> and Self-ſufficiency. We are afraid ſuch pure and ſublime <hi>Theorems</hi> ſhould be true; they hint the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of a greater Purity in us than we are willing to cultivat at preſent. If we aſcribed all Perfection, every <hi>good Gift</hi> and <hi>perfect Donation,</hi> to the ſupreme Cauſe; and were at the ſame time humbled and contented even with our own Ignorance, Errors and Blunders of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Reſignation</hi> only; if our Sentiments and <hi>Ratiocination</hi> were intended for his <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Magnificence</hi> ſolely, and our own Humiliation, ſatisfied with this ſingle Truth alone, that God is <hi>God,</hi> that is infinitly <hi>perfect,</hi> they could neither hurt us nor others. But if our Heads muſt needs be at work (as mine has here); if, like Children, we muſt play with <hi>Ideas,</hi> and <hi>phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophiſe</hi> about the Kingdom of <hi>Inviſibles</hi> and <hi>Imperceptibles,</hi> and the <hi>Arcana Imperii divini</hi>; if we cannot at firſt, at leaſt and in our Years of <hi>Probation</hi> or <hi>elementary</hi> State, arrive <hi>per ſaltum</hi> at <hi>pure Love, naked Faith,</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Reſignation</hi> (the only ſolid Means of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0412800400:322"/>
Infallibility and Stability); then the beſt and ſureſt Method is to deal in <hi>Analogy,</hi> as the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians</hi> do in <hi>Algebra</hi> and <hi>Geometry,</hi> to acquire a Facility in ſolving difficult <hi>Problems</hi> with Readineſs and Accuracy; <hi>viz.</hi> by laying up in our <hi>Memory,</hi> or having ready at hand a <hi>Penus Analogica,</hi> as they have a <hi>Penus Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytica</hi>; in beginning with the moſt <hi>ſimple</hi> and leaſt complicated <hi>Analogies</hi>; in attentively ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the <hi>Ratio's,</hi> Relations and References of Things, Subſtances, their Qualities and probable <hi>final Cauſes,</hi> and finding out their Degrees and Progreſſion. The <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> had with Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Accuracy diſcover'd and ſettled the <hi>Orbit, Period, Diſtance,</hi> and Laws of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> before they attempted with any Succeſs that of the <hi>Moon</hi>; and Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> had ſettled and adjuſted the Laws, Motions and Appearances of the <hi>Solar Syſtem,</hi> before he attempted the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Planets</hi>; and had for ſeven Years ſtudied experimental <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> before he ſet about to inveſtigat the Nature and Laws of minute Bodies and their <hi>Syſtems</hi>; he had cultivated and made many and various Experiments, by ſeparating, combining and <hi>analyſing</hi> the <hi>Rays</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> through many <hi>diaphanous</hi> Mediums, before he attempted to diſcover the Nature, Figure, and Laws of their component Particles. <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> and its Appendages, <hi>Type, Alluſion, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, Parable, Hieroglyphic</hi> and <hi>Allegory</hi> (all more remote or nearer Approaches to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0412800400:323"/>
                     <hi>Analogy</hi>) is the only natural Language the <hi>Deity</hi> can ſpeak to us at preſent, under our Degeneracy and <hi>Lapſe,</hi> conſiſtent with his <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> and the Preſervation of our <hi>Liberty.</hi> He may ſpeak to us mediatly by his <hi>Angels</hi>; He may ſpeak to the Wills by his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and to our <hi>Underſtandings</hi> by his <hi>Word</hi> his only begotten <hi>Son,</hi> and in the holy Scriptures by his <hi>Prophets, Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi>; but his ſole, <hi>natural,</hi> articulat, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible and univerſal Language, can poſſibly be no other but his Works of Wonder <hi>ad extra. The Heavens declare the Glory of God:</hi> By the Characters and <hi>Hieroglyphics</hi> intimatly impreſs'd on them; and they can only be read or underſtood by <hi>Analogy</hi> to <hi>Him,</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> and to <hi>one another.</hi> If then we began with this inanimat World, in (which only true natural <hi>Philoſophy</hi> from final Cauſes can inſtruct us) thence proceeded to the <hi>vegetable</hi> World, then advanc'd to the <hi>brute</hi> Creation, (where <hi>natural</hi> Hiſtory and <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> will be of great Service) and at laſt aſcended to <hi>intelligent</hi> Beings, through the <hi>angelic Hierarchy,</hi> till by <hi>Analogy</hi> we arriv'd at the <hi>Supreme Cauſe</hi>; this Method would be the moſt natural and ſecure, in a <hi>natural Progreſſion</hi> by <hi>Analogy:</hi> And if with Humility, Modeſty, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Direction of the <hi>uncreated</hi> Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, we perſever'd with Patience: this divine <hi>Philoſophy</hi> might, in time, (cultivated by different Hands) be of Service to the <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative</hi>

                     <hi>Chriſtian Philoſopher</hi> himſelf, as well as to others. But my Meaning will be better underſtood by a ſhort <hi>Recapitalation</hi> of what has been ſaid, and an <hi>Illuſtration</hi> by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. WHEN God intended to bring Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into Being, He could not chuſe but make them after the moſt perfect Pattern: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtamp'd his own <hi>Image</hi> upon all his Works. Hence the Creatures, being all <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niatures</hi> of the Deity, muſt bear a mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to Him and to one another. This <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance</hi> is what we call <hi>Analogy,</hi> and runs through the whole <hi>Scale</hi> of <hi>Beings</hi>; every <hi>Being,</hi> beſides its <hi>peculiar</hi> and diſtinguiſhing Quality, whereby it is determin'd to this or that particular <hi>Order,</hi> and has the <hi>Pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> of all below it; being alſo poſſeſs'd of all thoſe Qualities that are to be found in any of the inferior <hi>Orders.</hi> As a <hi>Curve</hi> of any of the <hi>Orders</hi> has all the Properties of the inferior Orders of <hi>Curves,</hi> beſides thoſe that belong to its own Claſs or <hi>Species.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. THESE different <hi>Orders</hi> or Ranks of Beings, being diſtinguiſh'd by their reſpective Qualities, the <hi>firſt Term</hi> of this infinit <hi>Scale</hi> will be ſimple <hi>Exiſtence</hi>; the Addition of <hi>one</hi> Quality will conſtitute the <hi>ſecond Term</hi> or <hi>Order</hi>; of <hi>two,</hi> the <hi>third</hi>; and ſo of the reſt; whence the Number of Qualities with which
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0412800400:325"/>
any Being is endow'd, will determin its Place in this <hi>Scale,</hi> and ſhew its Diſtance from the <hi>firſt Term.</hi> Beſides this Difference in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Orders</hi> of Beings, there is alſo a Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity among thoſe of the ſame <hi>Order,</hi> which proceeds from their poſſeſſing ſome of the common Qualities in a more or leſs eminent Degree.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As <hi>God</hi> can have but one <hi>Model</hi> in all his Productions, every <hi>Syſtem</hi> of Beings will reſemble all the other <hi>Syſtems,</hi> and each will be a Copy of the whole <hi>Creation.</hi> The <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi> World will be a Tranſcript of the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>; and the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> will be analogous to and correſpond with thoſe of the <hi>other.</hi> Beſides this general <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> there will be a more immediat and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Relation between each <hi>material Syſtem,</hi> and the Intelligences to which it belongs; the Structure of the Bodies and other material <hi>Organs</hi> of theſe Intelligences, together with the whole Frame and Contexture of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial <hi>Syſtem,</hi> being ſuch as will beſt ſuit the Nature, Rank and <hi>Order</hi> of theſe <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.</hi> And this Relation probably will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and attend them in all the Changes and <hi>Periods</hi> through which they paſs; ſo that ſhould the intelligent <hi>Syſtem lapſe</hi> from its Purity and Perfection, the material <hi>Syſtem</hi> would fall into Diſorder likewiſe, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ſome <hi>ſimilar</hi> and <hi>analogous</hi> Change.</p>

                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0412800400:326"/>4. OF this general <hi>Analogy</hi> between the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>material Syſtems,</hi> there are many <hi>Traces</hi> plainly to be diſcern'd by an acute and <hi>contemplative Philoſopher.</hi> To inſtance only in the Similitude which our <hi>ſolar Syſtem,</hi> as now diſorder'd, bears to the <hi>lapſed Intelligences</hi> that inhabit it. In the Centre of this <hi>Syſtem</hi> is plac'd the <hi>Sun,</hi> a bright and lively Image of the <hi>Deity,</hi> his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial inanimat <hi>Miniature</hi>; the <hi>Planets</hi> and other <hi>celeſtial Orbs</hi> revolving about him at their reſpective Diſtances, and performing their Revolutions in different <hi>Periods</hi> of Time, will repreſent the ſeveral <hi>Orders</hi> of lapſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences, the different Degrees of their <hi>Lapſe,</hi> and the Duration and Continuance of their <hi>probatory</hi> State. This glorious Body, the <hi>Sun,</hi> infinitly ſurpaſſes all the other <hi>Orbs</hi> in Magnitude and Luſtre; they are no more, compar'd to him, than Points in the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> of a <hi>Circle.</hi> They have no Brightneſs of their own; it is all deriv'd by <hi>Reflection,</hi> and is more or leſs, according to their Diſtance from him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. THE chief Properties of the <hi>Sun</hi> are <hi>Attraction, Light</hi> and <hi>Heat.</hi> The <hi>Sun</hi>'s <hi>Attraction</hi> extends to the remoteſt Parts of the <hi>Syſtem,</hi> acting at all Diſtances, with a <hi>Force</hi> increaſing in a certain Proportion as theſe Diſtances decreaſe. 'Tis by this <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0412800400:327"/>
that the <hi>Planets</hi> are retain'd in their <hi>Orbits,</hi> and kept from flying off in the <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi> to which their <hi>projectile</hi> Force gives them a conſtant Tendency. Should the <hi>Sun</hi>'s <hi>Attraction</hi> ceaſe but a Moment, the whole <hi>Syſtem</hi> would fall into the utmoſt Diſorder, and be irrecoverably ruin'd. How like is this <hi>Attraction</hi> to the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> continually operating upon all created <hi>Intelligences,</hi> and powerfully ſolliciting them to a nearer Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and Reſemblance to Himſelf! Its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is conſtant and invariable; were it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it ſhould have the leaſt Intermiſſion, the whole <hi>Creation</hi> would fall into utter Ruin and Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. THE <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> is diffus'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole <hi>Syſtem</hi>; no <hi>Celeſtial</hi> Body is endow'd with this Quality but himſelf. This is an <hi>Image</hi> of that <hi>Light which enlightens every Man that comes into the World</hi>; an <hi>Emblem</hi> of Him who came forth from the <hi>Father of Lights</hi>; the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Sun</hi> of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of <hi>ſpiritual Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. THE <hi>Sun</hi>'s Light is always accompanied with Heat, the Principle of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> In the other celeſtial Bodies there is ſome ſmall Degree of this Quality, but it is originally deriv'd from or produc'd in them by the <hi>ſolar Heat</hi>; without which they would be barren and inhoſpitable <hi>Deſarts.</hi> This
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0412800400:328"/>
repreſents the Influences of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which are inſeparable from the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>; and are the Principle of our <hi>ſpiritual Life,</hi> animating and cheriſhing every intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Being, and making it productive of all the Fruits of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. LET us next conſider the Properties of the <hi>Planets,</hi> and other Bodies that revolve about the <hi>Sun.</hi> Their various <hi>Magnitudes</hi> and <hi>Diſtances</hi> from the <hi>Sun,</hi> with the <hi>perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical</hi> Times of their Revolution, will expreſs the ſeveral <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>lapſed Intelligences,</hi> the different Degrees of their <hi>Lapſe,</hi> and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Periods</hi> of Time allotted for their Trial and <hi>Probation.</hi> Some of theſe Bodies, as the <hi>Comets,</hi> move in <hi>Orbits</hi> that are very <hi>Ellyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> going off to immenſe Diſtances from the <hi>Sun,</hi> where the Influence of his <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> is almoſt inſenſible; but by the Force of his <hi>Attraction</hi> they are again drawn back, and brought even to a nearer Approach than other Bodies that move in narrower <hi>Orbits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. THE <hi>Planets</hi> are conſtantly acted upon by two different Forces, <hi>viz. Gravity</hi> or <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,</hi> and the <hi>projectile</hi> Force. Theſe are contrary to one another, and always act in oppoſite Directions; the <hi>projectile</hi> Force give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Planet</hi> a conſtant Tendency to recede from the <hi>Sun,</hi> and to fly off in the <hi>Tangent</hi>;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0412800400:329"/>
while the Force of <hi>Attraction,</hi> by drawing it the contrary way, prevents that Effect: So that by the joint Action of both, the <hi>Planet</hi> is kept in its <hi>Orbit.</hi> The <hi>attractive</hi> Force, though continually influencing the <hi>Planet,</hi> is not a Quality of it, but proceeds from the <hi>Sun</hi>; the only Quality belonging to the <hi>Planet</hi> is that of the <hi>projectile</hi> Force. This will ſhadow out the <hi>Lapſe,</hi> the Action of <hi>Selfiſhneſs,</hi> and the inordinate <hi>Love</hi> of the Creature, with their Oppoſition to the <hi>divine Love.</hi>

                  <item>That on the whole, it is plain from Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, 1. <hi>Animal</hi> Food was permitted, and <hi>fermented</hi> Liquors not abſolutly, but their Exceſſes, forbidden. 2.
