            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS not ſo much the Itch of being thought an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
nor of following, the Method of thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whether Originals, or Tranſlators, (eſpecially
the laſt) who think Prefacing ſo neceſſary; that, rather
than forego their Opinion, they will ſpoil a good Work for
the ſake of a Half-Sheet of their own Scribbling, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
me to attempt one in this Place: If I had had no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Advantage in ſo doing, I muſt, without Flattery,
inform you, that I had wav'd the Trouble: But ſince 'twas
neceſſary, pray take it and make the beſt on't. And now all
I have to ſay, is to make theſe Pages have a good Run;
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0745601600:3"/>
which I cannot pretend to do, by any Elogy on 'em; but
refer you to the Peruſal. It has indeed Two of the
Beſt Recommendations Book can have, at this Time; It
is like our Faſhions, FRENCH. (And as the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi>
Mode, tho' never ſo ridiculouſly adjuſted upon an
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Perſon, meets not only with Reception, but Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
I'm in great Hopes the very Place of this Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet's
Birth, will hide the Blunders of the Verſion.) And
then 'tis againſt the JESUITES. If with theſe
Two Qualities it ſhould not meet Acceptation, I ſhall be
apt to think <hi>Diogenes,</hi> who would be bury'd with his
Face downwards, that when the World turn'd upſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down,
(which in his Days he expected) he might lye right
in his Grave, has now got his Wiſh; and, by the Ill-vent

of thoſe good Fathers knew how to improve
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0745601600:5"/>
to the Detriment and Proſecution of many

            </p>
            <p>ACCORDING to the Cuſtom, this LITTLE
Good Man, on the <hi>Samaritan</hi>'s Day, did not
fail to make a Diſcourſe on Grace, and what
was more, upon Efficacious Grace by it ſelf:
And ſolidly proved from St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
That no one ever reſiſted that Grace; not
but that Men can, but will not; for its Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
is juſt to inſpire what we will not oppugn.
He added, That ſufficient Grace was a New
Syſtem, broach'd by the JESUIT. <hi>Molina,</hi>
to reconcile the pretended Contradictions of
its Omnipotent Power with Freewill. In
ſhort, he aſſerted <hi>Janſeniſm</hi> to the laſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
            <p>THOSE of the Society who were preſent
at this Sermon, being nettled to hear <hi>Molina</hi>'s
Reverend School uſed at this Rate, took it
(as you may well ſuppoſe) in great Dudgeon,
and reſolved to load the Poor Preacher with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0745601600:6"/>
the heavy Weight of their Holy and Implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Fury. They extracted ſeveral Tenets,
which, in their Opinion, contain'd the moſt
poiſonous Venom of Hereſy, pack'd away to
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Alby</hi>; and, giving the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
into his Hand, <hi>Is it not an Errant Shame,</hi>
(ſay they, with a Zeal animated not for the
Glory of God, but of the Society) <hi>Is it not a
Shame, my Lord, That this Little Whisk of a
Monk ſhall come hither to preach <hi>JANSENISM</hi>
Tooth and Nail; whilſt the Pope, Biſhops,
Kings, Magiſtrates, and, indeed, all Powers,
as well Eccleſiaſtick as Secular, are endeavouring
to root this Cockle out of the Field of the
<hi>CHURCH.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Archbiſhop, who knew by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
how neceſſary their Good-Will was, at
that Time, to the making of a Man's Fortune;
and, on the contrary, the Danger as well as
Inconveniency of being hated by them; the
Archbiſhop, I ſay, came into their Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and promiſed them condign and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Satisfaction. He cited <hi>Little Father AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DREW,</hi>

Threats, of inflicting on him the Puniſhments
ordain'd in ſuch Caſes by the Canons of the
Church.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Little</hi> Prieſt, who was too well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the JESUITES not to know
that they were not to be offended with Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
and that whoever offered to contradict
their Notions, was at leaſt a Heretick, gave a
ſhrewd Gueſs at what was coming; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was not mightily diſmay'd at the Biſhop's
thundering Reprimand; but, with a becoming
Preſence of Mind, made this Anſwer; <hi>God
preſerve me, my Lord, from Preaching Hereſy
I can aſſure you I never had the leaſt Intention to
deviate from the Sentiments of the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi>; ſome unguarded Expreſſions may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
in the Heat of Diſcourſe, have fallenn

Conſtruction, have given Room for the Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

at <hi>Sunday</hi>'s Sermon; and they had taken
ſpecial Care to invite all their Partiſans, and
to place themſelves over againſt the Preacher,
that they might more fully rejoice at his
Confuſion. They that knew the LITTLE
Father better, did not doubt of finding this
Sermon curiouſly intermix'd with Scenes of
Mirth: So that with thoſe who were of the

him. What, <hi>Bernard,</hi> with your meek and

I'll ſtand to't; but St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is my Guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee;
