            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
            <p>AMONG the great names, which have done honor to antiquity in general, and to the Roman Republic in particular, that of <hi>Marcus Attilius Regulus</hi> has, by the general conſent of all ages, been conſidered as one of the moſt reſpectable, ſince he not only ſacrificed his labours, his liberty, and his life for the good of his country; But by a greatneſs of ſoul, almoſt peculiar to himſelf, contrived to make his very misfortunes contribute to that glorious end.</p>
            <p>After the Romans had met with various ſucceſſes in the firſt Punic War, under the command of Regulus, victory at length declared for the oppoſite party, the Roman Army was totally overthrown, and Regulus himſelf taken priſoner, by <hi>Xantip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> a Lacedoemonian General in the ſervice of the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians: the victorious enemy, exulting in ſo important a conqueſt, kept him many years in cloſe impriſonment, and loaded him with the moſt cruel Indignities. They thought it was new in their power to make their own terms with Rome, and determined to ſend Regulus thither, with their Ambaſſador, to negotiate a peace, or at leaſt, an exchange of captives, thinking be would gladly perſuade his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen to diſcontinue a war, which neceſſarily prolonged his captivity. They previouſly exacted from him an oath to return ſhould his embaſſy prove unſucceſsful; at the ſame time giving him to underſtand, that he muſt expect to ſuffer a cruel death if he failed in it; this they artfully intimated, as the ſtrongeſt motive for him to leave no means unattempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to accompliſh their purpoſe.</p>
            <p>At the unexpected arrival of this venerable hero, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans expreſs'd the wildeſt tranſports of joy, and would have ſubmitted to almoſt any conditions to procure his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement;
<pb facs="tcp:0163902600:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but, Regulus ſo far from availing himſelf of his influence with the Senate to obtain any perſonal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, employed it to induce them to reject propoſals ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently tending to diſhonour their country, declaring his fixed reſolution to return to bondage, and death, rather than violate his cath.</p>
            <p>He at Laſt extorted from them their conſent; and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amidſt the tears of his family, the importunities of his friends, the applauſes of the Senate, and the tumultuous oppoſition of the people; and as a great poet of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beautifully obſerves, <q>he embarked for Carthage as calm and unconcerned, as if, on finiſhing the tedious law-ſuits of his clients, he was retiring to Vena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the above, and many other important parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, the Author has paid the ſtricteſt regard to hiſtorical truth: In ſome leſs eſſential points, where ſhe thought it would rather obſtruct than advance her purpoſe, ſhe has ventured to deviate from it; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, in fixing the return of Regulus to Rome, poſterior to the death of his wife Martia. In <hi>this,</hi> and in the <hi>general</hi> conduct of the ſtory, ſhe has followed the Italian poet Metaſtaſio in his Opera of <hi>three</hi> acts: of which ſhe has given a free tranſlation, and made ſuch <hi>additions,</hi> as were neceſſary to form it into a tragedy of <hi>five</hi> acts.</p>
