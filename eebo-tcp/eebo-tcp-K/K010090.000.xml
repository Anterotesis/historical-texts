            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE MEDICINAL VIRTUES OF MAGNESIA ALBA, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ABOUT two years ſince I publiſhed a ſmall volume of <hi>Experiments and Obſervations on va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Subjects,</hi> which alſo contained ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the diſeaſes in which Magneſia Alba is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly uſeful, and a recommendation of that medicine in a ſtate of calcination, as preferable, in many inſtances, to the uncalcined Magneſia. But as the remarks on this ſubject are intermixed with a number of others which are only intereſting to medical or philoſophical readers, I have been frequently requeſted to draw up a plain detail of the hiſtory and medicinal uſes of Magneſia, for the uſe of thoſe perſons who may be purchaſers of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and to whom the other part of my former publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be entirely uſeleſs.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0493300500:5"/>
            <p>Previous therefore to the recital of the virtues of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia, it may not be improper to give a ſhort hiſtory of the invention of this medicine, and of the gradual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs by which it has arrived at the degree of eſtimation in which it now ſtands.</p>
            <p>To thoſe mineral bodies which contain metallic earths, the earlier Chemiſts gave the name of Marcaſites; and thoſe earths, which were capable of attracting the acid from the atmoſphere, and thereby forming ſalts, were termed Magneſia. The firſt preparers of Magneſia Alba, who procured it from the mother-ley of nitre, or liquor remaining after the cryſtallization of that ſalt, imagining it to be the proper abſorbent of the nitrous acid, are ſuppoſed to have given it the name of Magneſia, and the epithet <hi>Alba</hi> appears to have been added as a diſtinction, on account of its ſuperior whiteneſs.</p>
            <p>Magneſia Alba was firſt introduced by the Jeſuits at Rome, and the preparation of it was concealed by them, for ſome time, as a noſtrum. But the ſecret, at length, was divulged, and its uſe became more general in ſeveral countries on the continent. It has been obſerved above that it was at firſt prepared from the mother-ley of nitre, and it was ſometimes obtained by evaporating the liquor, and afterwards driving off, by means of a ſtrong fire, the acid with which it was combined; and ſometimes by precipitating the Magneſia by pouring in a ſufficient quantity of an alkaline lixivium.</p>
            <p>The powder, thus prepared, was not however pure Magneſia. A quantity of wood aſhes and quick-lime are neceſſary to the cryſtallization of nitre, and, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, the Magneſia, ſeparated from the liquor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0493300500:6"/>maining after that proceſs, contained a proportion of theſe ſubſtances. Beſides, as but little nitre is prepared in Europe, the difficulty of obtaining the liquor in ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity was an impediment to the general prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Magneſia. That excellent Phyſician and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Chemiſt, Hoffman,<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoffman, Vol. 4. p. 500.</note> was induced, from the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity between <hi>that</hi> lixivium and the brine remaining af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the cryſtallization of ſea ſalt, to try whether Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia might not be precipitated from the latter. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment ſucceeded to his wiſhes, and he even found the powder, thus obtained, to be more purgative than the other. His animadverſions and experiments on this preparation were publiſhed, and engaged the attention of phyſicians to a medicine ſo ſtrongly recommended by that celebrated profeſſor. Dr. Black, to whom we are obliged for many ingenious experiments tending to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigate the Chemical Hiſtory of Magneſia, rendered the proceſs ſtill more eaſy by ſubſtituting the bitter purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalt, commonly known by the name of Epſom Salt, which is prepared from the laſt mentioned brine, inſtead of the brine itſelf, thereby enabling chemiſts to prepare the medicine, though at a diſtance from thoſe places where ſea-water is evaporated.</p>
            <p>The proceſs, notwithſtanding, publiſhed by Dr. Black, was little known, and in ſome reſpects defective. Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia Alba was indeed ſold in the ſhops, but ill prepared, coarſe and adulterated. Scarcely any was to be met with, in a tolerable ſtate of purity, except what was prepared by the late Mr. Glaſs of Oxford, who, having
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0493300500:7"/>beſtowed much attention on the ſubject, produced it greatly ſuperior to any at that time vended. This gentleman however had not the generoſity to divulge his proceſs, but carefully concealed it as a profitable noſtrum.</p>
            <p>About ſixteen years ago, I happened to reſide in the neighbourhood of Mr. Glaſs; I had before that time frequently prepared Magneſia, but had never been able to make it equally fine as his, though far ſuperior to what was commonly ſold. My ambition was excited, I wiſhed to attain to a like degree of perfection, and, after many trials I arrived at the deſired point, and found, by repeated compariſons, that the Magneſia which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, equalled that of Mr. Glaſs in every reſpect.</p>
            <p>When I left Oxford, I made no other uſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery I had made than preparing Magneſia for my own ſhop, and freely communicating what I knew on the ſubject to my acquaintance. After ſome years it occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to me that it might be of public utility to draw up an account of the method I had made uſe of, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it to the College of Phyſicians, who are the proper guardians of medicine in this kingdom. I accordingly tranſmitted my proceſs to the College, who did me the honour of publiſhing it in their Tranſactions.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Medical Tranſactions, Vol. 2. p. 226.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Some time after the publication of the Volume of Tranſactions which contained my method of preparing Magneſia; Dr. Saunders, a very ingenious phyſician in London, whoſe extenſive knowledge in chemiſtry has been diſplayed in ſeveral publications, mentioned in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, to Dr. Percival, the great improvement which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0493300500:8"/>Magneſia was capable of receiving by calcination. That by this means it might be deprived of thoſe diſagreeable qualities which occaſioned flatulencies in the bowels of ſome tender people, and had brought the medicine into a degree of diſrepute. My worthy friend, ſenſible how much I was intereſted in every diſcovery on that ſubject, communicated the information to me, and on trial of this proceſs, I found the Magneſia improved to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of my expectation; it was perfectly mild, and as free from cauſticity after as before calcination; it operated in half the doſe, and occaſioned none of thoſe diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſenſations in the bowels which often follow the uſe of common Magneſia.</p>
            <p>From hence I was inſenſibly led into a train of other experiments which have been ſince publiſhed,<note n="*" place="bottom">Experiments and Obſervations on various Subjects, by Thomas Henry, London, 1773.</note> and it is hoped may have contributed to explain the nature of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia, and determine its medicinal properties more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately than had hitherto been done. In the courſe of theſe experiments, it was obſerved that the <hi>Calcined</hi> Magneſia did not diſſolve ſo <hi>rapidly</hi> in the vitriolic acid as the <hi>uncalcined,</hi> and being deſirous of comparing ſome other with my own, and imagining I might depend on the purity of that vended under the name of Mr. Glaſs, who had, ſome time before, ſold his proceſs to Mr. Delamotte, who then reſided, as a ſtationer, at Weymouth; I purchaſed a box, from the agent for the ſale of it in Mancheſter, that I might calcine it, and obſerve whether it acquired the ſame or different properties from that which I had prepared.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0493300500:9"/>
            <p>The reſult of theſe experiments, and the caution with which I proceeded, has been already delivered to the public; and the torrent of abuſe, which has ſo plentifully flowed upon me in conſequence of the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, is notorious. Conſcious of my own integrity, I have ſtood undaunted at the attacks which malice and revenge ſuggeſted. The unchemical doctrines, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd inferences, the glaring contradictions, and illiberal language, with which the publications of my antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts abounded, ſerved only to convince the public of the badneſs of a cauſe ſo meanly, ſo ungenerouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>

            <head>ON THE ACTION OF ABSORBENT MEDICINES IN GENERAL.</head>
            <p>WHEN a mixture of animal and vegetable food has remained a ſhort time in the ſtomach, a fermentation enſues, which is neceſſary to carry on the work of digeſtion, but which, when it becomes exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, degenerates into diſeaſe. During this fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a conſiderable quantity of air is produced, and the alimentary mixture gradually tends to acidity.</p>
            <p>To reſtrain the inordinate ferment in the ſtomach, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has wiſely given us the ſaliva or ſpittle, which ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the property of preventing it from riſing to a degree injurious to health. But where the ſaliva is either cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0493300500:10"/>or inſufficient in quantity, where the tone of the ſtomach is ſo weak, as to detain the aliment too long before it be puſhed forward through the pylorus into the ſmall inteſtines, or where the nature of the aliment it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is too much diſpoſed to ferment; in all theſe caſes the air, which is of the ſame nature as that diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fermentation of vinous liquors, diſtends the ſtomach, and an obnoxious, and ſometimes moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere acid is produced, which irritates the coats of that bowel, particularly that plexus of nerves which is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed about its upper orifice, and occaſions pain, four belchings, vomiting and heart-burn.</p>
            <p>As this was the moſt obvious kind of acrimony, it became the faſhion, among the chemiſts of the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century, to aſcribe the origin of almoſt all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes to a redundant acid; and their practice conſiſted in giving to their patients alkaline ſalts and abſorbent earths, ſuch as chalk, calcined oyſter ſhells, crab's claws, &amp;c. and theſe were frequently adminiſtered in caſes where, perhaps, remedies of a very oppoſite kind were requiſite.</p>
            <p>But when ſcience became more founded on rational principles than on imaginary hypotheſes, this practice loſt ground, and the uſe of abſorbents was confined to its proper bounds, to the correction of acidities when obviouſly prevailing in the firſt paſſages. And here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was a large field for the employment of theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, a field which, perhaps, daily became more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as luxury more prevailed, and as the increaſe of arts and manufactures tended to enervate the people by inducing them to lead more ſedentary lives.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0493300500:11"/>
            <p>Even in this ſtate of things, inconveniences aroſe from the property which all the common abſorbents poſſeſſed of being aſtringent. For though they, for a time, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected acidity, yet they produced ſuch a degree of coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs, as in effect rather added to the diſeaſe they were intended to cure, and an abſorbent earth of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature was a deſideratum in practice.</p>
            <p>Dr. Cadogan appears to have been the firſt phyſician who introduced the uſe of Magneſia Alba into theſe kingdoms. In his excellent treatiſe on the management of children, he recommended this powder as being more eaſily ſoluble in acids than the common abſorbents, and as a moſt ſafe and efficacious purgative. The opinion of phyſicians was, for ſome time, ſuſpended by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of obtaining it in a ſtate of ſufficient purity. I have uſed my utmoſt endeavours to remove that difficulty; and by the great improvement of calcining it, which was firſt ſuggeſted by Dr. Saunders, the medicine is rendered much more extenſively uſeful.<note n="*" place="bottom">I am obliged to Dr. Saunders, for his permiſſion to inſert the following note.
<p>Dr. Saunders, in his public lectures both on the practice of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic and chemiſtry, has frequently recommended my proceſs for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Magneſia, and has declared, that my Magneſia was the pureſt and moſt ſoluble of any others.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>It may be neceſſary to premiſe, for the information of thoſe readers who may not be acquainted with medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſubjects, that alkaline ſalts and abſorbent earths, when united with acids, have their nature entirely chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and form ſalts of a different kind, neither acid not alkaline, which ſalts differ according to the different acid
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0493300500:12"/>or alkaline employed. It has been too cuſtomary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the action of theſe medicines as ſolely confined to the abſorption and neutralization of acids in the ſtomach and bowels; whereas, when thus united, they form a combination capable of being admitted into the lacteals, and from thence into the circulation, and thus acquire the property of acting by urine and by increaſing the perſpiration.</p>

            <p>DURING the firſt months after the birth of a child, the ſtate of the ſolids is lax, and the juices thin and dilute. Theſe circumſtances contribute to the more eaſy growth of the body; yet to prevent the tone of the parts from becoming too much relaxed, nature, with that providential care which pervades her whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has given an acid to the ſtomach of young animals to ſtrengthen their fibres and prevent too great a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to alkaline acrimony. But this, like her other proviſions, ſometimes exceeds the bounds which were intended, and degenerates into a diſeaſe of an oppoſite tendency to thoſe it was deſigned to prevent. From the exceſs of acidity in the bowels of infants, the milk is coagulated, and, by oppreſſing the ſtomach, becomes the ſource of many diſeaſes. The bowels are irritated,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0493300500:13"/>and ſpaſmodic contractions of the guts occaſion ſevere gripings to the tender infant, and as the nerves are, at that period, exceedingly irritable, convulſions of ſome particular part or of the whole ſyſtem are frequently the conſequence. Green ſtools and ſour vomitings diſcover this acidity in the bowels of young children ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that one of the beſt writers on the ſubject of their diſeaſes, attributes the origin of all infantile diſorders to this cauſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Harris de Morbis Infantum.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Children thus affected always loſe their florid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and become pale and wan. Sometimes they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſevere gripings which torment them, by the moſt piercing cries; and ſometimes, when their ſtomachs are oppreſſed with coagulated milk or viſcid phlegm, they lie in a ſtate of ſtupidity, refuſing all nutriment. Their ſtools and what they vomit ſhew evident ſigns of acidity, not only in the colour but the ſmell.</p>
            <p>Under theſe circumſtances it is too common a practice among nurſes, neglecting the primary cauſe of the diſeaſe, to pour in hot cordials, and often to quiet the complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the infant by adminiſtering opiates, inſtead of attempting to correct and carry off the acidity which occaſions the diſorder. Remove the cauſe and the effect will ceaſe. To this end, where the child vomits up phlegm or coagulated milk, or appears oppreſſed with them, it it may be proper to clear the ſtomach by giving a grain or two of ipecacuanha, or a tea-ſpoonfull of a dilute ſolution of emetic tartar; either of which may be adminiſtered with great ſafety; and after the operation
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0493300500:14"/>of the vomit, a ſmall doſe of Magneſia may be given and repeated occaſionally ſo as to keep the body of the child gently open. It is a great recommendation of Magneſia, that its inſipidity renders it more agreeable to infants than any other purgative; and it has this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over all the other abſorbents, that it acts as an eaſy purgative, whereas they tend to bind and render the body coſtive; a ſtate which ſhould be ſtudiouſly avoided during infancy, for a plentiful diſcharge by ſtool is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo favourable to the health of children, that we ought to be very cautious how we haſtily check even the exceſſes which may ſometimes happen in that evacuation. As the looſeneſſes of infants are generally occaſioned by ſome acrid ſtimulus in the bowels, they are beſt cured by changing the nature of the offending matter and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodging it from its ſeat. The method, therefore, which has been propoſed above ſhould firſt be uſed, before any aſtringents are called in to our aid.</p>
            <p>The raſh, commonly known by the name of the red gum, and the diſorder called the thruſh or frog, which ſo often affect children during the firſt months, may in general be cured by the ſame treatment. In the former, ſhould the body be too looſe, oyſter-ſhell powder, or ſhalk may ſupply the place of Magneſia. In the latter, ſome topical application may be neceſſary; the following <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0493300500:15"/>
            <p>It has been a common practice to give Magneſia to children as a preventive, and to mix it for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with their food, in order to correct that diſpoſition which milk and the farinaceous aliments have to turn four. This however ſhould be done with caution, for it is only the exceſs of acidity which is prejudicial to infants: ſome degree of it is neceſſary; and ſhould we too officiouſly and entirely deſtroy, what we ought only to reſtrain within due bounds, we may create diſorders of an oppoſite nature to thoſe we have endeavoured to prevent, and inſtead of an acid, produce an alkaleſcent diſpoſition in the firſt paſſages. Indeed, I fear that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes have been more frequently created than obviated by the uſe of preventive medicines, and they ſhould only be allowed in caſes where the approach to diſeaſe is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. But when a child is in a healthy ſtate, the beſt means to preſerve him from a ſuperabundant acidity, is to pay due attention to the regulation of his diet, to give him proper exerciſe, not to confine him too much in the foul air of hot unventilated rooms, to waſh his whole body every day in cold water, and to rub him very well night and morning with a dry flannel, taking care that his ſtomach be not too full at the time when this friction is performed.</p>
            <p>Nor would I adviſe parents to rely with too much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity on the virtues of this medicine, where the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of their children are complicated or obſtinate. The advice of the ſagacious and diſtinguiſhing practitioner will then be neceſſary, to direct what method of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be purſued. Nor can I here avoid lamenting that the management of children, when diſeaſed, is ſo
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0493300500:16"/>often in the hands of nurſes and ignorant women, from an abſurd notion that their diſeaſes are not proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of medical inveſtigation; when, in truth, there are none which require a clearer judgment, a quicker pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, or a greater ſhare of medical knowledge in the preſcriber.</p>
            <p>During the period between dentition and puberty, the diſeaſes attendant on a lax fibre ſtill continue, though not ſo predominantly as in the former ſtage; yet aceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency is the manifeſt cauſe, or at leaſt the concomitant of many of the complaints to which children are at this time liable. To this they are diſpoſed, notwithſtanding the change in their diet to a more alkaleſcent kind, by the great quantities of fruit, frequently crude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe, cakes, and other ſweet and greaſy food with which they are too often indulged. By theſe errors, their bowels are overcharged; their digeſtion impaired, and the aliment remaining too long in the ſtomach becomes ſour, and occaſions vomitings, head-achs, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints which are thought to proceed from worms, and indeed are frequently attended with that diſorder; as the crudities thus generated in the bowels ſerve as a nidus for theſe deſtructive vermin. Here likewiſe Magneſia may be of conſiderable advantage, as an alkaline purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, neutralizing the offending acid, and at the ſame time promoting its diſcharge by ſtool. But if the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach be overloaded with mucus, or undigeſted aliment, a gentle vomit ought to precede the exhibition of the Magneſia.</p>
            <p>And even in a more advanced ſtage of life, perſons of weak habits, and who lead ſedentary lives, are often af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0493300500:17"/>with indigeſtion, four eructations, heartburn, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, and coſtiveneſs. Theſe diſorders very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend women during their ſtate of pregnancy, and are ſometimes almoſt inſtantly removed by the uſe of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia. Doctor Watſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Medical Obſervations and Inquiries, Vol. 3. p. 335.</note> has publiſhed the caſe of a pregnant woman, who was afflicted with ſuch ſevere vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings as to bring on convulſions, hiccoughing, and violent pain at her ſtomach. What ſhe brought up was acid, and ſo very acrimonious, as to inflame and exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riate her mouth and throat; and the great uneaſineſs ſhe felt at her ſtomach, upon ſwallowing any liquor that had the leaſt degree of acrimony, or was more than luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, made it probable that the internal ſurface of the ſtomach was affected in the ſame manner. In this deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſituation, after variety of remedies had been tried in vain, the ſtomach was waſhed with unſalted mutton broth, till the liquor was diſcharged without any acid taſte. Her pain was by this means abated, but in about two hours was apparently returning with the ſame vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as before. This ingenious phyſician then directed a drachm of Magneſia to be given in mutton broth, and to be repeated as often as her pain returned, without any regard to the quantity the whole might amount to, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing her pain to continue ſevere. The firſt doſe reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and in three days ſhe took three ounces of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia; and in the next three days, two ounces more, by which time all her ſymptoms were removed. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in this caſe, that an exceſſive purging was not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0493300500:18"/>the conſequence of taking ſo large a quantity of Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, where there was ſo much acid to neutralize it.</p>
            <p>In bilious habits, where there is generally a diſpoſition in the ſtomach contrary to acidity, Magneſia is uſually eſteemed to be improper, taken alone: but I am dubious whether this opinion is well founded, and many reaſons for theſe doubts may be deduced from ſome experiments which have been recited in a former work.<note n="*" place="bottom">Henry's Experiments and Obſervations, p. 68, and ſeq.
<p>By theſe experiments it appears that Magneſia, though remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſeptic to animal fleſh, retards the putrefaction of bile, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores ſweetneſs to it when actually putrid: that theſe laſt effects are ſtill more ſtrongly produced by the Calcined Magneſia, which alſo powerfully reſiſts the corruption of fleſh: that ſome of the other abſorbents prove antiſeptic to bile; and, conſequently, that the opinion of the univerſal ſeptic property of the abſorbent claſs of medicines, and of the impropriety of preſcribing them in fevers of a putreſcent type, may admit of ſome exceptions; for as the bile is by many ſuppoſed to be the great ſource of putrid diſeaſes, ought not the antiſeptics, which are preſcribed in theſe caſes, to be ſuch as more particularly impede the corruption of this fluid, rather than that of fleſh?</p>
               </note> However, where putrid bile is to be corrected and diſcharged by ſtool, very good purpoſes may, perhaps, be anſwered by taking the Magneſia, joined with a ſufficient quantity of acid to neutralize it, while in a ſtate of efferveſcence; or by ſwallowing the Magneſia and the acid, one imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the other, ſo as to produce the fermentation in the ſtomach: for thus the fixed air, with which the Magneſia abounds, being let looſe, may powerfully cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the tendency to putridity in the contents of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0493300500:19"/>viae, and at the ſame time evacuate them down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>It is probable Magneſia may be of ſervice in diſeaſes of the ſkin. Several authors have attributed cutaneous eruptions, and indeed the antient chemiſts, as has been before obſerved, aſcribed almoſt all diſorders to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of an acid in the blood; whilſt others abſolutely deny that an acid can be admitted into the lacteals, or if admitted, exiſt in the blood in a ſtate of acidity. In theſe caſes, however, if an acid acrimony abounds in the ſtomach and bowels, with a coſtive habit, and pale com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, Magneſia will be a uſeful corrector, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the circulation in the form of a mild neutral ſalt, may act as an excellent alterative; or, where there is no ſuſpicion of acidity in the ſtomach, an equal quantity of cream of tartar may be mixed with the Magneſia.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus given a curſory detail of the medicinal properties of Magneſia in its natural ſtate, I ſhall now proceed to conſider it in a ſtate of calcination.</p>

            <head>MAGNESIA ALBA, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ON THE MEDICINAL VIRTUES OF CALCINED MAGNESIA.</head>
            <p>THOUGH, in the preceding chapter, notice has been taken of the good effects ariſing from the fixed air of the Magneſia being let looſe in the ſtomach, by drinking ſome acid beverage immediately after the powder, in diſeaſes of a putrid tendency; yet in diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of a different type, and in perſons of flatulent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, the diſcharge of this air by the acid of the ſtomach often occaſions uneaſy ſenſations in the bowels, inflating and diſtending them over-much, inducing griping pains, and above all, a ſenſe of debility or ſinking, which is not eaſily deſcribed. In order to obviate theſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, I was induced, by the reaſons mentioned in chapter firſt, to deprive the Magneſia of this part of its compoſition by calcination. By this proceſs it loſt ſeven twelfths of its weight, and though it produced no effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence with acids, yet it had not acquired any degree of acrimony to the taſte; and when thirty grains of it were diluted with a few ſpoonsful, and ſwallowed, it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned no uneaſy ſenſation in my ſtomach, nor ſenſe of heat in my throat, proved nearly as aperient as a double

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0493300500:23"/>quantity of uncalcined Magneſia, and operated without the leaſt griping.</p>
            <p>Thus Magneſia Alba is not only diveſted of the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable qualities which have been alluded to, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires new properties which render it likely to anſwer ſome very important practical purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Calcareous earths, alkaline ſalts, and Magneſia, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived of their air, attract it from every ſubſtance with which it has a ſmaller degree of affinity. The two former becoming highly cauſtic by the loſs of their air, cannot be adminiſtered but in very ſmall doſes. But Calcined Magneſia, being abſolutely diveſted of air, though not rendered acrimonious, and being able to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorb a large quantity of this elaſtic vapour, may act more powerfully than the whole tribe of carminatives, yet eſſentially differs from them in many reſpects. <hi>They</hi> contain a large quantity of air; <hi>Magneſia</hi> in this ſtate is entirely free from it; <hi>Aromatics</hi> may be apt to ferment, and increaſe acidities; the <hi>Calcined Magneſia</hi> is incapable of efferveſcence, and corrects an aceſcent diſpoſition in the gaſtric juices; the <hi>former</hi> conſtipate the belly, the <hi>latter</hi> is laxative.</p>
            <p>From this property of Magneſia, when calcined, of abſorbing air, it occurred to me that it would, of all others, be the moſt proper purgative for patients labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the ſtone who might be taking the lixivium ſaponarium, or ſoap ley, having the advantage over all the vegetable purgatives, which abound with air, and conſequently have a tendency to render the cauſtic alkali mild and inert: I even flattered myſelf that it might co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incide
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0493300500:24"/>in promoting the efficacy of that powerful ſolvent of the human calculus. Doctor Macbride's theory, that the lixivium acts by depriving the calculus of its fixed air, appears to be well founded; and Mr. Chittick, in the exhibition of his noſtrum, which, notwithſtanding all his arts to diſguiſe it, is now known to have been the ſoap ley, kept his patients from every kind of diet abounding with air. We may therefore venture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it, though not as a lithontriptic, being inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble in water, yet as an aſſiſtant to the lixivium, by abſorbing a part of that air in the primae viae, which would otherwiſe be attracted by the cauſtic alkali, and thereby render it incapable of acting on the calculus.</p>
            <p>In all the diſeaſes attended with an aceſcent diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the firſt paſſages, in which Magneſia has, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, been recommended, the calcined powder may be given with ſuperior advantages, as it will not produce any of thoſe inconveniences which have been attributed to that medicine when uncalcined. Beſides that it will act in a threefold capacity, viz. as an abſorbent of air, and of acidity, and alſo as an eaſy purgative. I know ſeveral who could never bear to take the common Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia, with whom the calcined perfectly agrees. This medicine has been very ſerviceable in flatulent cholics; and even in gouty habits, joined with ſome warm aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic, it has been found uſeful in correcting the very great flatulency which ſo much afflicts perſons of this conſtitution; and the Cayenne pepper appears to be the moſt proper addition to it, on account of the ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of this ſpice that is neceſſary to make the Magneſia
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0493300500:25"/>gratefully warm to the ſtomach. Hypochondriacs, and thoſe perſons who, from leading ſtudious and ſedentary lives, labour under obſtinate coſtiveneſs, and obſtructions of the bowels, have generally recourſe, for the cure of theſe complaints, to warm aloetic purgatives, and with propriety, where their habits are not too full, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to inflammation: but in theſe caſes, the uſe of ſuch medicines frequently induces piles, and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory irritation; whereas the Calcined Magneſia ſucceeds much better, correcting the acidity which is ſo prevalent in ſuch patients, and removing conſtipation, without oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioning the diſagreeable conſequences of more ſtimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting medicines.</p>
            <p>The Calcined Magneſia appears, in general, to be a preferable medicine for children to the uncalcined. It is an agreeable circumſtance that ſo much ſmaller a doſe of the former is neceſſary, as it operates in half the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity that is requiſite of the latter, and proves an effectual corrector of the flatulencies which give ſo much diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the tender bowels of infants. I have adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to children of but few days old, with ſafety and ſucceſs, nor have I ever obſerved any diſagreeable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences from its uſe.</p>
            <p>My ingenious friend Dr. Lettſom<note n="*" place="bottom">Lettſom's Medical Memoirs, p. 139, et ſeq.</note> has related the caſe of a woman, aged 43, who was ſeized with convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive twitchings in the left ſide, accompanied with a moſt acute pain under the ſhort ribs, ſhooting towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the ſtomach. She had laboured under this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0493300500:26"/>for about two years before her admiſſion into the Diſpenſary in Alderſgate-ſtreet. The fits attacked her two or three times a day, and generally continued from half an hour to three hours. During the paroxyſms, ſhe ſuffered the moſt excruciating torture, till at length, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being exhauſted, ſhe ſunk into a ſtate of ſtupefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In ſome of the fits, a ſpontaneous vomiting termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated them ſooner, but no particular matter was ejected.</p>
            <p>Beſides bleeding, bliſtering, and laxative medicines, ſhe had tried a great variety of remedies in vain. Dr. Lettſom, from the frequent eructations of wind, joined with the other ſymptoms, judiciouſly concluded that fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulence in the ſtomach and bowels principally excited this direful diſeaſe; and that beſides opiates to quiet the convulſive motions, it was neceſſary to abſorb the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundant air that ſeemed detached in theſe viſcera, and ſometimes diſtended them ſenſibly to the touch.</p>
            <p>An emetic was preſcribed to be taken every week, and in order to abſorb the fixed air which might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated in the inteſtines, and to correct acidity, ſhe was directed to take four ounces of lime water, and alſo two drachms of Calcined Magneſia three times a day, and one drachm of the Paregoric elixir was exhibited once a day at leaſt.</p>
            <p>By the uſe of theſe medicines, and due attention to her diet, ſhe experienced eaſe the firſt week; the fits gradually diminiſhed in violence and in frequency, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n two months nearly ſubſided; at which time the elixir was omitted. She continued to take Calcined Magneſia and lime-water for a week afterwards, and ſince ſhe was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0493300500:27"/>diſcharged from the hoſpital, the Doctor aſſures us that her health has remained uninterrupted, without the uſe of any medicine.</p>
            <p>Calcined Magneſia is a medicine very well adapted to counteract the coſtiveneſs occaſioned by the uſe of the Bath, Tunbridge, and Briſtol waters; and may be a convenient ſubſtitute for the ſaline purging waters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken in ſmall doſes, waſhed down with a large draught of pure water, or, in caſes where acidity does not prevail in the ſtomach, of lemonade or any acidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated liquor.</p>
            <p>As a preparative for the ſmall-pox, few medicines can be given to infants preferable to Calcined Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia. And from its antiſeptic property, or power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the putrefaction of fleſh and of bile, it ſeems well deſerving the attention of practitioners, as a purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in putrid diſeaſes.</p>

            <head>GENERAL DIRECTIONS RELATIVE TO THE DOSES OF MAGNESIA.</head>
            <p>THE following general directions may be uſeful, in reſpect to the doſes of Calcined Magneſia. But it is to be remembered, that a double quantity of the Uncalcined Magneſia will be requiſite to produce the ſame effects.</p>
            <p>A child during the month may take from three to ſix grains of Calcined Magneſia; and the doſe may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, at proper intervals, till a ſufficient number of ſtools be obtained.</p>
            <p>Children during the time they are cutting their teeth may take five, ten, or twenty grains of the Calcined Powder, in proportion as it is intended to act as a purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or only as an alterative. As they advance in years, the doſe muſt be increaſed accordingly.</p>
            <p>The doſes for adults, as well as for children, muſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer greatly, according to their different conſtitutions, or the degree of acidity in their ſtomachs. It may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per therefore to begin with ſmaller doſes, and to increaſe them if neceſſary. In general, twenty or thirty grains
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0493300500:29"/>will be ſufficient to procure a gentle purging for an adult perſon, who is eaſily moved; but much larger doſes may be neceſſary for the more robuſt. While acidity prevails in the ſtomach, and occaſions coſtiveneſs, heartburn, and vomiting, the doſe is only to be regulated by the effects which the medicine produces.</p>
            <p>The Magneſia is much more agreeable, when mixed well with the vehicle in which it is taken; to this end, only ſuch a quantity of water ſhould be added to it, at firſt, as may be neceſſary to reduce it to a paſte, which ſhould be rubbed till it be quite ſmooth, and then gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diluted.</p>
            <p>Water ſweetened with ſugar, milk and water, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond milk, are proper liquids in which to mix the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. To children it may be given mixed with their food, in ſuch a manner as not to be perceived by them.</p>
            <p>As moſt people are now provided with ſcales and weights for weighing gold, it may be proper to mention the proportions which theſe weights bear to thoſe uſed by the apothecaries. Two penny-weights are equal to 120 grains, or two drachms; and the grain weights, each of which contain as many grains as there are <hi>round</hi> marks on the ſurface, are exactly ſimilar to thoſe by which medicines are weighed. The money weights which are marked with the names of the ſeveral coins, bear the following proportions, viz. that marked one guinea, contains 129 grains, or 9 grains above two drachms; that marked 10s. 6d. ſixty-four grains and a half, or four and half grains above one drachm, &amp;c.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0493300500:30"/>So that the quantities of Magneſia to be given may thus be accurately determined.</p>
            <p>But where weights are wanting, the quantity may be meaſured in a tea-ſpoon; one of a moderate ſize contains about ſix grains, upon a level with the edge of the ſpoon; and when headed up, about twenty grains.</p>
