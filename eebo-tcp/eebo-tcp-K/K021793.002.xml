            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE VOYAGES OF CAPTAIN COOKE.</head>
            <p>THE rich cargo of the annual ſhip from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilla to Acapulco, has ever been the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which private adventurers to the South Seas have had in view; while, on the other hand, the annual ſhip from Acapulco to Manilla has been the purſuit of the ſhips of war. This difference has ariſen from the different conſtitution of the two ſhips; for the galleon, when ſhe ſets ſail from Manilla, being deep laden with a variety of bulky goods, (ſuch as Chineſe ſilks and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, vaſt quantities of Indian ſtuffs, calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes, and chintz, beſides the minuter articles of goldſmiths work, embroidery, &amp;c. wrought at Manilla by the Chineſe,) ſhe has not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of mounting her lower tier of guns, but generally carries them in her hold. Her hands too are as few as are conſiſtent with the ſafe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of the ſhip, that ſhe may be the leſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered by the ſtowage of proviſions; ſo that being but weakly manned, and indifferently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for defence, ſhe is thereby more expoſed to the attacks of ſmall privateers, and more eaſy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0204000302:3"/>
to be made their prey; and, though ſhe does not contain ſo great a treaſure as the other, yet ſhe is ſufficiently rich to recompenſe the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, and to enrich the captors, her cargo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally eſtimated at three millions of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>But the ſhip from Acapulco making her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn chiefly in ſilver and gold, and having little or no bulky goods on board, as her cargo lies in leſs room, her lower tier is always mounted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe leaves the port, and her crew is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with a ſupply of ſailors, and with one or two companies of foot, which are intended to reinforce the garriſon at Manilla. Beſides, there being many merchants who take their paſſage to Manilla on board the galleon, her whole number of hands on her return is uſually little ſhort of 600 fighting men; ſo that ſhe is more than a match for ſuch ſmall privateers as are generally ſent upon hazardous expeditions, and a prize only for a royal ſhip of war; and has therefore never been attempted by any other.</p>
            <p>The voyage we are now about to relate was purpoſely fitted out with a view to intercept the Manilla ſhip at the inſtance of Dampier, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of whoſe character (from reading the accounts written by himſelf) we were led into an error, which the preſent voyage, written by Captain Cooke, has enabled us to correct. The ill ſucceſs that attended the voyage to the South Seas, under the immediate command of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, of which a brief relation is given in the firſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0204000302:4"/>
volume of this work, was ſo far from diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that enterprizing officer from purſuing his favourite project of making prize of the Manilla ſhip, that, after his return, when he had wearied the merchants of London with fruitleſs ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he repaired to Briſtol, where his repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were better underſtood, and where they were attended with better effect. By his ſolid remonſtrances he prevailed upon nineteen of the principal merchants and gentlemen of that city to unite and form a company, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of fitting out two private ſhips of war, to ſhew what advantages might be derived from a well-conducted enterprize againſt the Spaniards in the South Seas: and it may, perhaps, be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to his judgment and experience, that they were more properly adapted to the ſervice on which they were to be ſent, and were better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt every accident to which they might be expoſed, than any privateers that ever were fitted out before them. Add to this, that their crews were furniſhed with better regulations, and ſubjected to ſtricter rules, and under ſeverer penalties, than men liſted to go on hazardous adventures are generally willing to ſubmit to.</p>
            <p>Their principal officers were gentlemen of experience, or highly intereſted in the ſucceſs of the voyage; being the firſt ſubſcribers, and the chief promoters of the undertaking; and theſe alſo were aſſiſted with a ſecond ſet of officers, equally able and experienced, who, in caſe of accidents, were ready to ſupply the places of thoſe who might be diſabled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0204000302:5"/>But, beſides being awed by penalties from treſpaſſing the articles of agreement that were ſigned by every man on board from the higheſt to the loweſt, they were likewiſe encouraged by rewards to behave gallantly; every common ſailor who ſhould loſe a limb in time of action being entitled to a douceur of 30l. and ſo in proportion to officers according to their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ranks: yet, notwithſtanding all theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, we find them ever ready to mutiny.</p>
            <p>The two ſhips, thus fitted up and regulated, were called the Duke and Dutcheſs; the firſt, of 300 tons, 36 guns, and 183 men, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Woodes Rogers; the other, of 270 tons, 30 guns, and 151 men, by Captain Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Courtney.</p>
            <p>Captain Rogers, who commanded in chief, was a bold, active man, an indefatigable officer, one who would not give up his opinion readily to others, nor be flattered by other people's giving up their opinion, without being convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to him. He had been, according to Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, a large ſufferer by the French, and was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally no great friend to that nation; but his moſt ſingular quality, and that which indeed recommended him to this command, was a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar art he had of maintaining his authority, and at the ſame time preſerving his influence, over his ſeamen; an <hi>art,</hi> or <hi>gift</hi> rather, in which Captain Dampier was remarkably deficient.</p>
            <p>Captain Courtney was a man of birth, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and of many amiable qualities; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0204000302:6"/>
largely to the expence of the voyage, and took a ſhare in it to ſuperintend the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, and to interpoſe and qualify the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that might ariſe in the courſe of a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and dangerous navigation; being a perſon of an admirable temper, and remarkable for moderation in all his deciſions, in which almoſt all men were ready to acquieſce.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe two gentlemen, who were firſt in command, Dr. Thomas Dover (the ſame, who, about forty years ago, ſo effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the uſe of quickſilver in a little book, entitled Dr. Dover's Laſt Legacy to his Country, that ladies as well as gentlemen of rank and fortune beſpangled the floors and carpets with quickſilver, and ſcattered their diamonds wherever they met to dance, or to play) was ſecond Captain on board the Duke; and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Edward Cooke, our author, was ſecond to Captain Courtney.</p>
            <p>Dover was a conſiderable contributor to the voyage, but he was of a rough ungovernable temper, ſeldom pleaſed with either meaſures or men; but incapable of forming any party to ſupport his own notions, becauſe no party could ever be brought to approve them.</p>
            <p>Captain Cooke was an able and experienced ſeaman, had been twice taken priſoner, and twice releaſed by the enemy, and now embarked his All in this bottom with a view to make one effort more to gain a fortune.</p>
            <p>Captain Dampier, who projected the voyage,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0204000302:7"/>
was made pilot on board the Duke to direct it. Of him the reader has already heard enough in the former volume of this Work; and from the character of the leaders it is natural to infer, that they were choice in the appointment of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior officers, and that even the common men were not of the meaner ſort.</p>
            <p>The general inſtructions of the owners were, firſt, to repair to Ireland to take in proviſions, and then to proceed with all poſſible expedition to the South Sea; if luckily they met with any prizes by the way, they were either to ſend them home or to America, as ſhould beſt ſuit; they were ordered by all means to keep together, and to act in concert; to undertake no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of conſequence without firſt deliberating the matter in a general council of officers in both ſhips; to be particularly careful in aſſiſting each other in every circumſtance of neceſſity; and that in giving relief in times of danger, or in ſupplying proviſions or water in caſe of want, they ſhould be as one ſhip, and that on no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence the one ſhould be ſuffered to want while the other had any thing to ſupply; but, as they were to ſhare alike in all advantages, they ſhould ſhare alike too in all ſufferings.</p>
            <p>Thus fitted out and thus inſtructed, and the officers of both ſhips being provided with legal commiſſions to cruiſe againſt her Majeſty's ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the French and Spaniards, in the South Seas, on the firſt of Auguſt, 1708, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moored from King-road, and on the 4th of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0204000302:8"/>
ſame month caſt anchor at the Cove in Cork, where they continued victualling, and adjuſting their men, changing ſome and enliſting others, among whom were many foreigners, till the firſt of September, when they ſailed in company with the Haſtings man of war, having firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, in caſe of ſeparation, to meet at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deira, there to take in wine and brandy for the remainder of the voyage.</p>
            <p>[Here it is neceſſary to apprize the reader, that, as there are TWO very authentic accounts of this voyage, one written by Captain Rogers, and one written by our author, we ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reduce them into ONE, by ſupplying from Captain Rogers what is wanting in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cooke, and ſhall, contrary to the method purſued in Harris, continue the narrative in the perſon of Captain Cooke, though ſometimes we may be obliged to uſe the words of Captain Rogers. And this being premiſed, we will now proceed:]</p>
            <p>On the 10th of September, ſays Captain Cooke, we ſpied a ſail, which we chaced and came up with. She happened to be a Swede, bound for Cadiz; and though from ſeveral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances there was reaſon to ſuſpect that ſhe had contraband goods on board, yet it being difficult to prove it, and we being in haſte, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed her. This cauſed a mutiny on board the Duke, headed by the boatſwain and three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior officers, who perſuaded the men not to give her up. Captain Rogers confined the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0204000302:9"/>
of this diſorder, in which there was not one foreigner concerned. He put ten of the mutineers in irons, a ſailor being firſt ſoundly whipped for exciting the reſt to join him; others leſs guilty he puniſhed and diſcharged; but the chief officers continued armed, fearing what might happen, the ſhip's company ſeeming too much to favour the mutineers. They had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a great deal of trouble with theſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, who did more miſchief when in irons than before, by ſtirring up the men to releaſe them, pretending that they ſuffered in the cauſe of the crew, and therefore the crew ought to riſe and releaſe them. This determined the Captain to make ſome examples, but not to irritate too much; he therefore began by removing the boatſwain from his office, and appointing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his room, without intending any thing further. But on the 14th this inteſtine ſtorm roſe higher than ever; for then a ſailor, with the beſt part of the ſhip's company at his heels, went up to the Captain, and demanded the boatſwain out of cuſtody. With this man the Captain deſired to ſpeak alone, and when he came upon the quarter-deck, the officers ſeized him, and cauſed one of his chief comrades to whip him. Thus by different corrections of the like kind, the officers on board the Duke broke the combination, and allayed the tumult. The boatſwain they ſent home in the Crown Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley in irons; the other priſoners they releaſed upon their humble ſubmiſſion; ſuch among
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0204000302:10"/>
them as were petty officers they reſtored to their commands, and all on board were forbidden to diſobey or reproach them: and thus ended an inſurrection, which, had it ſucceeded, would have put a ſtop at once to the farther proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the voyage.</p>
            <p>On the 15th, finding ourſelves to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and at the ſame time ſomewhat to the eaſtward of Madeira, we changed our place of rendezvous, and bore away for the Canaries.</p>
            <p>On Saturday the 18th, at five in the morning, we ſaw a ſail right a-head, to which we gave chace. About ten, we came up with, and took her, being a ſmall Spaniſh bark bound from Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriff to Fuertaventura, with ſeveral men and women paſſengers on board, and laden with ſundry ſorts of goods. Next day we bore away for Oratavia-road, where we ſtood off and on, and ſent away the prize's boat with one of our owner's agents, a prieſt, and the maſter of the prize, to treat about the ranſom of her, and to get wine, proviſions, and other neceſſaries, for the refreſhment of both the ſhips. About eight next morning, a boat came from the town, with a letter from the Engliſh merchants reſiding there, wherein they expoſtulated with us for making prize of the bark, alledging that there was a free trade agreed to in theſe iſlands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her Majeſty of Great Britain and the Kings of France and Spain, ſo religiouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the latter, that they had cauſed an Engliſh ſhip taken there by a French privateer,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0204000302:11"/>
to be reſtored; and farther, repreſenting the danger that might ariſe to themſelves, living by permiſſion in an enemy's country, if the bark was not immediately given up, for which repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals would be made on them; as alſo, that we ſhould be anſwerable at home for interrupting the ſettled commerce. This letter was ſigned by the Conſul and three capital merchants. Our Captains immediately returned for anſwer, that, having no inſtructions relating to the Spaniſh veſſels trading among thoſe iſlands, they could not juſtify the releaſing of the ſhip on their bare opinions, without ſome order or proclamation of her Majeſty, the Engliſh being protected there only on anchoring ground, and the bark being taken in the open ſeas; that, in caſe Mr. Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brugh, the owners agent, was not reſtored, they would carry away all the priſoners they had; and, if they apprehended any detriment to the factory, they might ranſom the bark, and ſeek their redreſs in England. They deſired diſpatch, there being no time to loſe; and, upon ſending back Mr. Vanbrugh, they would releaſe the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. At night another letter came in anſwer to theirs, from the Conſul, importing, that the Engliſh men-of-war were civilly received there, and never committed any hoſtilities; and that it was ſtrange we ſhould inſiſt on ranſoming any Spaniards, who were never made priſoners in England, or elſewhere; and the Governor there delivered up to him any Engliſh priſoners that were brought in by Spaniſh privateers; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0204000302:12"/>
he inſiſted, that thoſe in our cuſtody ſhould be diſmiſſed, and the bark diſcharged, accepting a preſent of wine in return. With this from the Conſul at the city of Laguna, came another letter from the merchants at Oratavia-port, much to the ſame purport, only offering to pay to the value of 450 pieces of eight, the ſum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for the bark, in wine, brandy, ſugar, oil, barley, and greens, to prevent incenſing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives againſt them, not doubting but that repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration would be made them in England. Our Captains replied, by threatening to cruiſe among the iſlands to avail themſelves for their loſs of time, and to cannonade the town of Oratavia, unleſs they received inſtant ſatisfaction. On the 22d, at four in the morning, we ſtood in for the ſhore, making a clear ſhip; but, ſoon after, we ſaw a boat coming with our owners agent, and Mr. Croſs, one of the Engliſh merchants, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five buts of wine, and other refreſhments. We lay off the town, took the goods out of the prize, ſold the bark to Mr. Croſs, and put the priſoners on board her. Thus ended this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome buſineſs, which being unanimouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of at a council of officers of both ſhips, they proceeded on their voyage; and, ſeeing a ſail to the weſtward, gave chace to her, but, night coming on, loſt her.</p>
            <p>On the 24th we croſſed the Tropic of Cancer, and, the Sunday following, performed the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of dipping the men of both ſhips who had
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0204000302:13"/>
not croſſed it before; a ceremony that cauſes a good deal of mirth among the common men.</p>
            <p>On the 30th we paſſed by Santa Lucia, one of the Cape de Verd iſlands, and by eight in the morning came in fight of St. Vincent, and about eleven came to an anchor in ten fathom water within the rock.</p>
            <p>As we knew the iſland not to be inhabited, we were not a little ſurprized to ſee ſome people on ſhore; and, in order to learn who they were, and what their buſineſs was, I armed the pinnace, and went on ſhore, when we found them to be Portugueſe come from the iſland of St. Anthony to catch turtle, who told us we might here wood and water.</p>
            <p>This iſland lies in lat. 16 deg. 55 min. N. and in 25 deg. 36 min. W. long. from the meridian of London. There are on it Guinea-hens, hogs, and goats, and about the ſhore plenty of fiſh. In the woods there are ſpiders as large as little birds, whoſe webs are not eaſily broken through, being woven with a ſubſtance nearly as ſtrong as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary thread.</p>
            <p>The Cape Verd iſlands are eleven in number, St. Anthony, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, St. Nicholas, Sal, Bona Viſta, Mayo, St. Jago, Fogo, Romes, and Brava; and take their general name from a promontory on the African ſhore. They belong to the Portugueſe, but are not all inhabited.</p>
            <p>While we lay at St. Vincent's, new diſturbances aroſe among the men in relation to plunder; for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0204000302:14"/>
here they had an opportunity of trading, and therefore every man wiſhed to have ſomething to exchange. The effects taken in the late prize occaſioned a general murmur throughout both the ſhips; to put an end to which, and to fix the people in a firm reſolution of doing their duty, we determined to ſettle the matter at once, by framing ſuch articles, as, without giving our owners any ground of complaint, might inſpire the ſeamen with courage and conſtancy, and make them as willing to obey as their officers were ready to command. It coſt ſome trouble to adjuſt the articles; but that was fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſated, by their effectually anſwering the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And now, having compoſed all differences, the men again chearfully returned to their duty, all but two or three of the Duke's men, who made their eſcape on ſhore; among whom was their linguiſt, who probably had no mind to be left behind; but, having ſtaid beyond his leave of abſence, and paid no regard to the orders that were ſent him to repair on board, it was thought proper, by way of example, to depart without him. Accordingly on the 7th of October we unmoored, and, on the 8th, after lying by all night for our conſort, we ſet ſail together for the coaſt of Braſil. But on our paſſage thither, ſome freſh diſputes aroſe among our men; and, after various conſultations to accommodate the differences, it was reſolved, that Mr. Page, who was our ſecond mate, ſhould be ſent to ſerve on board the Duke, and Mr. Ballet to come from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0204000302:15"/>
the Duke to ſerve on board the Dutcheſs in his room. This was not to be effected without force, Page refuſing to obey the order; and when it was on the point of being put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he reſiſted; but, being overpowered, and carried on board the Duke, he was there charged with mutiny. He deſired to go to the head, for a neceſſary purpoſe, before he made his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and was permitted ſo to do; when he inſtantly jumped over-board, with the deſign of getting back again to the Dutcheſs, but was taken up, tried, and puniſhed, which put an end to the diſturbance for that time.</p>
            <p>On Wedneſday the 27th we croſſed the Line, and on Sunday the 14th of November ſaw land at a great diſtance, and at noon made Cape Frio, on the coaſt of Braſil. On the 18th we anchored before Iſlo Grande, and on the 19th moored our ſhip in ten fathom water. Here one of our men going from the ſhip without leave, giving the firſt Lieutenant foul language, and threatening ſoon to be revenged, was put in irons; and his meſſmates and confederates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his releaſe, or deſiring to ſhare in his puniſhment, ſeven voluntarily went into irons.</p>
            <p>On the 21ſt I went on ſhore in the pinnace with a preſent to the Governor, and to acquaint him we were friends. At our firſt landing they fired ſeveral ſhot, taking us for French; but afterwards made an apology, and received us civilly. On the 23d two of the mutineers were whipped, and put in irons again. On the 24th
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0204000302:16"/>
four of the eight men in irons were releaſed, on their ſubmiſſion; and two men went on ſhore, deſigning to leave the ſhip, and, having bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained with a canoe to carry them to the main, they were by miſtake put aſhore at a diſtant part of the iſland, where, finding themſelves on an uninhabited coaſt, they began to relent; and, after ſtaying a night in the woods, where they were terrified with the roaring of wild beaſts, they came in ſight of the ſhip, and made ſigns of repentance, humbling themſelves in the moſt ſuppliant manner, and on their knees, with their hands lifted up, endeavouring to move compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. After ſome time the boat went off, and brought them on board, where they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in irons till the next day, and then ordered to be flogged and releaſed.</p>
            <p>On the 25th two Iriſh landmen ſtole away from the Duke, and ſecreted themſelves in the woods, in like manner as the two ſeamen had done from the Dutcheſs. About four next morning the watch on the quarter deck ſpied a canoe, and hailed her to come on board; but the rowers not anſwering, but ſtriving to eſcape, the Duke's pinnace purſued the canoe, fired into her, and mortally wounded one of the Indian rowers. He that owned and ſteered the canoe was a friar, and had a quantity of gold on board, which, after running the canoe aſhore, he had juſt time to hide before the Duke's pinnace reached the land. A Portugueſe, who was in the canoe, and who had no gold to loſe, would not follow
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0204000302:17"/>
the friar; but, on the contrary, knowing the Engliſh to be friends, called the Father back, who, upon his return, was carried with the wounded Indian on board the Duke, where the poor man was dreſſed by the ſurgeon, but died in a few hours. The officers in both ſhips were very ſorry for this unfortunate accident, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their proteſt againſt it, and cauſed the man to be buried on ſhore in a very ſolemn manner. The friar, however, who had loſt his gold, was not to be appealed, but threatened to ſeek for juſtice in Portugal or England.</p>
            <p>In towing the ſhip about the eaſternmoſt part of the iſland, we ſpied the Duke's two men waiting tor a canoe to carry them over to the main; and two of our Lieutenants manned the boat, and, landing ſome men in a convenient place to get behind them, to prevent their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping to the woods, they rowed to the place where the fellows were ſeen to lurk. When they found themſelves beſet, they endeavoured to fly; but, being intercepted, they were brought on board, put in irons, and ſent to their own ſhip, where they were afterwards ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
            <p>On the 27th the principal officers on board both ſhips went in their pinnaces to the town of Angra dos Reys on the main, carrying the ſhips muſic along with them. They were kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and entertained by the Governor and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who with their ſervants are the principal inhabitants, there not being more than 50 or 60
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0204000302:18"/>
low-built houſes in the place. They have a guard-houſe, where, at our landing, we were received by the Governor, with about 20 men under arms, and treated with a dinner, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, and rum. The Governor and Fathers deſired we would go to ſee their Franciſcan monaſtery and church, that day being a feſtival with them, and the people coming from the plantations in the country to celebrate it. We complied; and, at their requeſt, our muſick, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of trumpets, hautboys, and violins, played in a gallery belonging to the church, and aſſiſted in heightening the ſolemnization, to the no ſmall ſatisfaction of the Fathers. After divine ſervice we likewiſe joined in proceſſion with them, and accompanied them from the church in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, every one carrying a large wax candle in his hand, according to the cuſtom of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on ſuch occaſions. The proceſſion being cloſed, we were conducted into a great hall, and treated by the Fathers with an elegant ſupper of fiſh, ſweet meats, and fruits of various ſorts in the higheſt perfection. At our coming away, they gave us ſome vollies with their ſmall arms, and we returned the compliment by a flouriſh of trumpets, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fifteen days journey up the country there is ſaid to be a very rich gold mine; and it was not long ſince the French plundered a bark with 800 weight of gold-duſt on board, which it was bringing from the mine. Some men of credit told me, that the mines here are more
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0204000302:19"/>
profitable than even Mexico or Peru; but that the Tapoyars, who inhabit the inland plains, are an unconquerable race of men, taller and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Portugueſe, and not to be brought to labour. The Braſilian women are very fruitful, have eaſy labours, retire to the woods, where they are delivered alone, and return no more till after a certain time allotted for purification.</p>
            <p>On tueſday the 30th of November we weighed anchor; but a tornado coming on, we tacked, and ſtood under the iſland till its fury abated. On the 1ſt of December both ſhips ſailed out of the bay, and purſued their courſe to the ſouthward till the 21ſt, without meeting with any remarkable occurrence; but on that day a young man fell from the mizen-top-ſail yard, and fractured his ſkull.</p>
            <p>On the 23d we made land, which I ſuppoſed to be Falkland's Iſland, in lat. 51 deg. 25 min. S. by eſtimation.</p>
            <p>On the 24th, as we ran along ſhore, the land looked like ſome part of England, having ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good bays and vallies, but believe it to be wholly uninhabited.</p>
            <p>On the 5th of January, 1709, we had a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gale of wind at north-weſt, and very bad weather. At two in the afternoon we reefed both courſes, then lowered our fore yard, and lay by till five, at which time our waſte was filled with water, and we expected the ſhip to ſink every moment: got down our fore-yard as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0204000302:20"/>
well as we could, and looſed the ſprit-ſail to wear the ſhip, which at laſt we accompliſhed; but in wearing we thought we ſhould have foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with the weight of water that was in her waſte. Thus we ſcudded before the wind, the Duke following, and at nine ſhipped a ſea in the poop, as we in the cabbin were going to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. It beat in all the cabbin-windows and bulk-head, and hove the firſt Lieutenant half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way between the decks, with ſeveral muſkets and piſtols that hung there, darting a ſword that was againſt the bulk-head of the cabbin through my man's hammock and rug, which hung againſt the bulk-head of the ſteerage; and, had not the bulk-head of the great cabbin given way, all we who were there muſt inevitably have been drowned before the water could have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. Our yaul was ſtaved on the deck, and it was a wonder that many were not killed with the ſhutters, the bulk-head, and the arms, which were driven with a prodigious force; but Providence delivered us from this and many other dangers; only one man or two were hurt, and ſome bruiſed; but not one rag of dry cloaths was left us, our cheſts, beds, and bedding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſoaked in ſea-water. Next day the ſtorm abated, and we continued our courſe, coaſting very far to the ſouth, where we endured much cold, by which many of our men were greatly affected, inſomuch that a third part of both ſhips companies fell ſick, occaſioned, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, by their being long wet and cold. We
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0204000302:21"/>
were now in lat. 61 deg. 48 min. S. long. from Falkland's Iſles 18 deg. 5 min. W.</p>
            <p>Monday 17, by a good obſervation I found that we were got round Cape Horn, Terra del Fuego, and the Straits of Magellan, and to the northward of Cape Vileria. On the 19th I reckoned we were to the northward of Port St. Stephen on the coaſt of Patagonia in the Great South Sea.</p>
            <p>On Monday the 31ſt, at eight in the morning, made the Iſland of Juan Fernandes, where we deſigned to wood and water. In the afternoon Capt. Dover went off in the Pinnace to get ſome proviſions, and in the evening ſaw a fire aſhore, which made us conclude there were ſhips in the road, as we were aſſured the iſland had no inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants: we therefore made the ſignal for the boat to return, and ſhe accordingly came on board about twelve at night.</p>
            <p>Tueſday Feb. 1, we rowed and towed into the great bay, and came to an anchor in 50 fathom water. All this day we had a clear ſhip expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rencounter; but were much diſappointed, when, inſtead of a valuable prize, we diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only an odd figure of a man, who had been the ſole reſident on the iſland for more than four years. His name was Alexander Selkirk, a Scotchman, who had been Maſter of the Cinque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, the ſhip that accompanied Dampier in his voyage to the South Seas, and was, as Dampier ſaid, one of the beſt men in her. Captain Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers immediately agreed with him to be his mate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0204000302:22"/>It was this man who made the fire in the night when he ſaw our ſhips, which he judged to be Engliſh. During his ſtay here, he ſaw ſeveral ſhips paſs by; but only two came to an anchor. As he went to view them, he found them to be Spaniards, and retired from them; upon which they ſhot at him. Had they been French he would have ſubmitted, but choſe to riſque his dying alone on the iſland rather than fall into the hands of the Spaniards, becauſe he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended they would either murder, or make a ſlave of him in the mines; for he feared they would ſpare no ſtranger that might be capable of diſcovering the South Seas. The Spaniards had landed before he knew what they were, and they came ſo near him that he had much ado to eſcape; for they not only ſhot at him, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him to the woods, where he climbed to the top of a tree, at the foot of which they charged their pieces, and killed ſeveral goats juſt by, but went off again without diſcovering him. He told us, that he was born at Largo, in the county of Fife, and was bred a ſailor from his youth. The reaſon of his being left here was a difference between him and his Captain, which, together with the ſhip's being leaky, made him willing rather to ſtay here, than to go along with him at firſt, and when he was at laſt willing to go his Captain would not receive him. He had been at the iſland before to wood and water, when two of the ſhip's company were left upon it for ſix months, till the ſhip returned, being
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0204000302:23"/>
chaced thence by two French South Sea ſhips. He had with him his cloaths and bedding, with a firelock, ſome powder, bullets, and tobacco; a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a bible, ſome practical pieces, and his mathematical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and books. He diverted and provided for himſelf as well as he could; but for the firſt eight months he had much ado to bear up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt melancholy, and the terror of being left alone in ſuch a deſolate place. He built two huts in Piemento-trees, covered them with long graſs, and lined them with the ſkins of goats which he killed with his gun as he wanted, ſo long as his powder laſted, which was but a pound, and that being almoſt ſpent, he got fire by rubbing two ſticks of Piemento wood toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon his knee. In the leſſer hut, at ſome diſtance from the other, he dreſt his victuals, and in the larger he ſlept, and employed himſelf in reading, ſinging pſalms, and praying; ſo that he ſaid he was a better Chriſtian while in this ſolitude than ever he was before, or than, he was afraid, he ſhould ever be again.</p>
            <p>At firſt he never eat any thing till hunger conſtrained him, partly for grief, and partly for want of bread and ſalt, nor did he go to bed till he could watch no longer. The Piemento wood, which burnt very clear, ſerved him both for fire and candle, and refreſhed him with its fragrant ſmell. He might have had fiſh enough, but could not eat them for want of ſalt, becauſe they occaſioned a looſeneſs, except crayfiſh,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0204000302:24"/>
which are as large as lobſters, and very good. Theſe he ſometimes boiled, and at other times broiled, as he did his goat's-fleſh, of which he made good broth. He kept an account of 500 that he killed while there, and caught as many more, which he marked in the ear and let go. When his powder failed he took them by ſpeed of feet, for his way of living and continual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe cleared him of all groſs humours, ſo that he ran with wonderful ſwiftneſs through the woods and up the rocks and hills, as we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, when we employed him to catch goats for us. We had a bull-dog which we ſent with ſeveral of our nimbleſt runners to help him to catch goats; but he diſtanced and tired both the dog and the men, caught the goats, and brought them to us on his back. He told us that his agility in purſuing a goat had once like to have coſt him his life. He purſued it with ſo much eagerneſs that he catched hold of it on the brink of a precipice of which he was not aware, the buſhes hiding it from him; ſo that he fell with the goat down the precipice a great height, and was ſo bruiſed with the fall that he narrowly eſcaped with his life; and, when he came to his ſenſes, found the goat dead under him. He lay there about twent-four hours, and was ſcarce able to crawl to his hut, which was about a mile diſtant, or to ſtir abroad again in ten days. He came at laſt to reliſh his meat without ſalt or bread. He had a conſtant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of good turneps, which had been ſown there by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0204000302:25"/>
Captain Dampier, and have now overſpread ſome acres of ground. He had good cabbage from the cabbage-trees that grow wild upon the iſland, and ſeaſoned his meat with the fruit of the Piemento-trees, which is the ſame as Jamai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca pepper, and ſmells deliciouſly. He found alſo a black-pepper, called Malageta, which was very good to expel wind and ſtrengthen the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. He ſoon wore out all his ſhoes and cloaths by running in the woods; and at laſt, being forced to ſhift without them, his feet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo hard, that he ran every where without difficulty; and it was ſome time before he could wear ſhoes after we found him; for, not being uſed to any ſo long, his feet ſwelled when he came to wear them again. After he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered his melancholy, he diverted himſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with cutting his name upon the trees, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with contrivances to vary and increaſe his ſtock of tools, and ſometimes in clear evenings in counting the ſtars. He was at firſt much peſtered with cats and rats that had bred in great numbers from ſome of each ſpecies which had got aſhore from ſhips that put in there to wood and water. The rats gnawed his feet and cloaths while he ſlept, which obliged him to cheriſh the cats with his goat's fleſh, by which many of them became ſo tame, that they would be about him in hundreds, and ſoon delivered him from the rats. He likewiſe tamed ſome kids; and, to vary his diverſions, would now and then ſing and teach them to dance; ſo that

by his natural flow of humour, and the vigour of his youth, being now but 30 years old, he came at laſt to conquer all the inconveniences of his ſolitude, and to be very eaſy. When his cloaths were worn out, he made himſelf a coat and a cap of goat's ſkins, which he ſtitched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with little thongs of the ſame that he cut with his knife. He had no other needle but a nail; and, when his knife was worn out to the back, he made others of ſome iron hoops that were aſhore, which he beat thin, and ground upon ſtones. Having ſome linnen cloth by him, he ſewed himſelf ſome ſhirts with a nail, and ſtitched them with the worſted of his old ſtockings, which he pulled out on purpoſe. He had his laſt ſhirt on when we found him on the iſland. At his coming on board us, he had ſo much forgot his language for want of uſe, that we could ſcarce underſtand him; for he ſeemed to ſpeak his words by halves. We offered him a dram; but he would not touch it, having drank nothing but water ſince his being there; and it was ſome time before he could reliſh our victuals. He could give us no account of any other product of the iſland than what we have mentioned, except ſome black plumbs, which are very good, but hard to come at, the trees which bear them growing on high mountains and rocks.</p>
            <p>The officers that went firſt on ſhore were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to his retreat; but the way to it being very rugged and intricate, only a very few of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0204000302:28"/>
them had curioſity enough to viſit it, He had conceived an irreconcileable averſion to an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer on board the Cinque Ports, who, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, was on board the Duke; but, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a principal in command, he was prevailed upon to wave that circumſtance, and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Captain Dampier, for whom he had a friendſhip. He was very uſeful while the ſhips ſtaid at Juan Fernandez, in ſupplying them with freſh proviſions, and in facilitating the buſineſs of taking in wood and water. He ſaid, he had ſeen ſnow and ice in July, which is the middle of winter in that climate; but the months of September, October, and November, are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably pleaſant; the air being perfumed with a fragrance that cheriſhes and revives the ſpirits, and has a wonderful effect upon animals, as well as men, which Selkirk remarked by their play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and plumpneſs. He particularly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us to a plant not much unlike feverfew, of a moſt grateful and cordial ſcent, with which we ſtrewed the tents of the ſick, who were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much comforted, and their cure facilitated. We gathered many bundles of it, dried them in the ſhade, and ſent them on board.</p>
            <p>On the 13th of February, a general council of officers was held on board the Duke, when many neceſſary regulations were agreed to, for the maintenance of order, diſcipline, and ſecrecy; among which, two inſpectors were appointed from on board the Duke, to take account of all p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3+ letters">
                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap>s taken by the Dutcheſs; and the like
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0204000302:29"/>
number from the Dutcheſs, to regiſter ſuch as ſhould be taken by the Duke.</p>
            <p>While we continued in this bay the carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters fitted up the pinnaces, the frames of which were ready prepared at Briſtol, at our firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out.</p>
            <p>On the 14th the pinnaces were launched, and having each a gun fitted to her prow, were tried in the bay, to ſee how they would ſail, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſerve as ſmall ſhips of war, to examine the harbours where the large ſhips could not venture to approach the ſhore. And now, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things in readineſs, we began to prepare for our departure, all our ſick men being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, except two who died, and were buried on the iſland.</p>
            <p>On the 15th we cleared the bay, and purſued a northerly courſe till the 24th, when we croſſed the Tropic of Capricorn, and ſhot ſome Tropic birds about the ſize of a partridge, with only a ſingle feather in their tails, but that very long, and very taper. We had now the ſea as ſmooth as a pond; and, having little to do, we ordered the men to attend prayers regularly twice a day, prohibited gaming, to prevent the artful from taking advantage of the ſimple; and impoſed a penalty againſt ſwearing, by which that vice was almoſt excluded the ſhip's company.</p>
            <p>On Monday the 28th I ordered three of our men to be put in irons, for cutting the meat in the ſteep-tub, and hiding it; and on the 2d of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0204000302:30"/>
March, Captain Courtney cauſed them to be whipped and pickled, by way of example.</p>
            <p>On Thurſday he 14th of March, Captain Rogers, Captain Dover, and Captain Dampier, came on board the Dutcheſs; and concluded, that the ſtrict, obſervation of Lent having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Spaniards from trafficking in thoſe ſeas, the moſt eligible plan would be to bear away under an eaſy ſail for Lobos, and there to ſupply ourſelves with boats to land at Guaya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil; but in the afternoon ſaw a ſail, gave chace, and took her She came from Guayaquil, and was bound for Cheripe to load flour, and had been out 16 days. The crew were all Indians, except one Spaniſh paſſenger. They had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on board but about 50 l. in money to pay for their cargo, and told us, that part of the new town of Guayaquil had lately been burnt; that the Jeſus Maria, formerly a man-of-war, was coming from Lima to be there rebuilt; that another large ſhip was expected from Panama at Payta; and that they had heard nothing of any Engliſh men-of-war or privateers being in thoſe ſeas.</p>
            <p>On the 16th we made the iſland of Lobos, and in the evening anchored in the road. It lies in lat. 6 deg. 5 min. S. about 16 leagues from the continent, is barren, and affords neither wood nor water; but there is good riding for ſhips, and harbours proper for repairing and careening. Here the prize was fitted up, and it was agreed, that I ſhould go out in her with 35 men, to cruiſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0204000302:31"/>
in company with the Dutcheſs; and with that view ſhe was new named, and called <hi>The Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Galley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 26th, at day-break, we ſaw a ſhip ſtanding to the ſouthward, and ſoon came up with her. She was a bark of 50 tons, bound from Guayaquil to Truxillo, with timber and cocoa-nuts. It was agreed, that Captain Courtney ſhould ſtand in with her in the night; and that I ſhould continue to cruiſe till farther orders, which on the 27th I received, and the ſame even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing came to an anchor by the Duke and Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs in Lobos-Road. Next day, the priſoners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examined, reported, that a ſhip of 36 braſs guns was expected from Lima with the Viceroy of Mexico and his mother on board; and that they were bound to Panama. Upon this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence it was reſolved in full council to cruiſe in queſt of this ſhip, and if ſhe eſcaped to attack Guayaquil.</p>
            <p>While the Duke lay at Lobos, the carpenters built a large boat to land men, in caſe of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack; and, having made all neceſſary prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the ſick men from both ſhips being put on board the laſt prize, which was called the <hi>Increaſe,</hi> our firſt Lieutenant was ordered to command the <hi>Beginning Galley</hi>; and on the 31ſt of March we left Lobos, and agreed to cruiſe ſix leagues to the windward of the Saddle of Payta, as the moſt likely ſtation to ſucceed in our enterprize.</p>
            <p>On the 2d of April we fell in with a large
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0204000302:32"/>
ſhip, of 400 tons, from Panama, heavily laden with dry goods, commanded by Captain Morel, and thought to be one of the largeſt merchant-ſhips in all thoſe ſeas. He had 50 or 60 blacks on board, beſides ſeveral paſſengers.</p>
            <p>The next day we took another prize of ſmall value, having only about 90 or 100 l. in plate, and a ſmall quantity of timber. She was of 50 tons burthen, commanded by Juan Perezillo Baſtillo, who told us that a biſhop was coming by ſea from Panama to Lima with 200,000 pieces of eight, and a conſiderable quantity of family plate; but no ſhip appearing in ſight from the 3d to the 9th, it was then upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation agreed to call in the cruiſers, and to attempt the conqueſt of Puna and Guayaquil. This reſolution being taken in council, it was next debated, who ſhould command in chief on ſhore; and, after a warm conteſt, it was at length agreed, that Captain Rogers and Captain Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhould each command a company of ſeamen, and Captain Dover a party of landmen; that Captain Dover ſhould give the word of command the firſt night, and the other two Captains take their turns.</p>
            <p>On Sunday the 10th, Mr. Vanbrugh, the owner's agent, was removed from the council, and Mr. Samuel Hopkins was choſen in his room; the charge againſt him was founded on killing the Indian, as already mentioned, and engaging to vote with Captain Rogers upon all occaſions. Captain Dover likewiſe charged
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0204000302:33"/>
him with inſolence, and with diſobeying or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>On the 12th, the attack of Guayaquil was finally ſettled, and the whole fleet ſet ſail for that harbour. Some new regulations were framed, and freſh encouragement propoſed to animate the men to behave reſolutely.</p>
            <p>The three commanding officers ſelected each their reſpective parties, Captain Dover the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, and the Captains Rogers and Courney two parties of ſailors, 75 men in each; Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Dampier commanded the artillery, and was to form a body of reſerve, to act as occaſion ſhould offer. The whole number employed in this ſervice amounted to 238 effective men. The care of the ſhips and prizes was at the ſame time entruſted to the Captains Cooke and Fry, who, beſides a ſmall complement of ſailors, had 226 Indians and blacks on board.</p>
            <p>Friday 15. Saw a ſail near the ſhore, and, having little wind, the Duke's boat commanded by Captain Fry, and ours by myſelf, made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for her, going off in ſuch haſte that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us had the ſwivel guns we uſed to carry, nor our full complement of men. The Duke's boat nearing her firſt, ſhe put out Spaniſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, fired a gun, and hoiſted her Spaniſh flag at the main-top-maſt head. The Duke's boat then lay by for us to come up. We ſaw ſhe was French-built, and, by the deſcription the priſoners had given us, concluded it muſt be the ſhip we had been ſo long cruiſing for, which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0204000302:34"/>
was to carry the Biſhop. Our ſhips being almoſt out of ſight, and the Spaniards ſo near the coaſt, we reſolved to lay her on board on each bow, and accordingly fell to it. The diſpute was hot for a long time, we keeping a conſtant fire, and the enemy returning it, who killed two of Captain Fry's men, beſides wounding one of his and two of mine. One of the killed was Mr. John Rogers, our ſecond Lieutenant, and brother to Captain Rogers. The Duke's boat, finding the enterprize deſperate, bore away; and ſome time after we did the like: but Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Fry having put ſome of his men aboard of us, given us ſome powder and ſhot, and taken in our wounded, I made again to the chace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to keep her from the ſhore, and, rather than fail, to clap her aboard. The Spaniards, perceiving our deſign, edged off to ſea, and we followed them. Our ſhips came up apace, and the Dutcheſs having fired a ſhot or two, ſhe ſtruck her colours, and ſurrendered. The men begged for good quarter, and we promiſed them all civility. This ſhip came from Panama, and was bound for Lima, to be fitted out for a man of war. There were 70 blacks, and many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, with a conſiderable quantity of pearls, on board: the lading conſiſted of bale goods, and ſome things belonging to the Biſhop; but they had ſet him, with his attendants, aſhore at point St. Helena, from whence he was to go by land to Guayaquil. While the French poſſeſſed this veſſel, ſhe was called La Lune d'Or. She
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0204000302:35"/>
was of 270 tons burden, and commanded by Don Joſeph de Arizabella.</p>
            <p>Saturday 16. Took a ſmall bark laden with hides and ſome flour, and buried our Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, being all much concerned for the loſs of ſo good an officer.</p>
            <p>Sunday 17. All things being now in order, our men went aboard the two barks in order to land, and Captain Fry and I took charge of the ſhips, prizes, and priſoners.</p>
            <p>Monday 18. At one in the morning, being near the iſland Santa Clara, our two barks with the land forces left us.</p>
            <p>Tueſday 19. The boats rowed with 45 men towards the iſland Puna, and came to a grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling cloſe under the land, out of ſight of the look-outs. We ſeized the Governor of the iſland, and ſent our carpenter and two or three hands along the ſhore, to cut all the bark-logs, and canoes in pieces, for fear they ſhould get away and alarm the town of Guayaquil.</p>
            <p>Thurſday 21. I ſent the Beginning a-head, for fear of danger, who, ſeeing a veſſel riding cloſe under point Arena, fired two ſwivel guns at her; but found nobody on board. She was a new Spaniſh bark going to load ſalt, and had nothing in her but a few jars of water. At five in the afternoon the tranſports rowed for the town of Guayaquil, and at eleven at night were ſo near as to hear one centinel call to another for fire to be brought. Perceiving we were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, we rowed over to the other ſide, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0204000302:36"/>
ſaw a fire made where the centinels talked, and ſoon after many lights all over the town. We heard them likewiſe ring the alarm-bell, and fire ſeveral volleys; and we obſerved them to light a fire on the hill to give the town notice of our being come up the river. Hereupon the boats came to a grappling, when ſuch a hot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute aroſe among ſome of our chief officers, that they were heard aſhore; the officers differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their opinions, whether to land immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, or ſtay till morning; however, at laſt it was agreed, that, ſince we did not know the ground, it was beſt to ſtay till day-light.</p>
            <p>Friday 22. Our forces being all joined, we ſent a flag of truce, with the Captain of the French-built ſhip, and another priſoner, to the Corregidor, who aſked him our number, which the Captain magnified. The Corregidor ſuggeſted that we were mere boys; but the Captain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, he would find we were men, for we had fought him bravely in our open boats, though he had killed one of the Commander's brothers, and wounded and killed others; and therefore adviſed him to agree for the ranſom of the town.</p>
            <p>Saturday 23. The pinnace went up the river after ſome veſſels, and brought ſix of them to anchor by our barks; and we alſo took poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of two new ſhips, of about 400 tons each. We then went aſhore with a flag of truce, and the Governor came on board to agree about the ranſom of the town and ſhips; but this not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0204000302:37"/>
being then concluded, he promiſed to meet the Captain at ſeven in the evening, but was not ſo good as his word.</p>
            <p>Sunday 24. The Governor came off again to treat, and our Captains would have ſeized him for having forfeited his word; but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that it was incompatible with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a flag of truce, was ſet aſhore again, and all things were made ready for the attack. Accordingly the men landed, and, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to proceed, they went on with ſo much bravery, that the Spaniards fired only their firſt volley and fled, our people preſſing and purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to their cannon, which they ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, the gunner only, who was an Iriſhman, ſtanding by them till he was wounded in four places, of which wounds he ſoon after died. Our men then marched in a body through both towns, drove out the enemy, and, placing three guards in the three churches, ſet fire to five or ſix houſes adjoining to the wood, leſt the enemy ſhould annoy our guard, which was within piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol-ſhot. All this night they kept firing out of the woods at our centinels, but did them no harm. In the mean time the Dutcheſs's pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, commanded by Lieutenant Connely, went up the river, landed at every houſe, took the plate, and what elſe of value they found, and had ſome ſkirmiſhes with the enemy, in which one of our men was wounded.</p>
            <p>Monday 25. In the night one of our centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels ſhot another belonging to us, who was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0204000302:38"/>
from his poſt, and did not anſwer when challenged three times; our firſt Lieutenant's piſtol went off by his ſide, and wounded him in the leg; and another of our men was alſo ſhot through the foot by one of our own people: moreover, our ſurgeon cut off a man's arm who had been hurt by one of our grenadoe ſhells, which broke in the bark when fired out of the cohorne. The afternoon was ſpent in ſhipping off proviſions from the town, and diſpoſing all things in caſe of an attack in the night.</p>
            <p>Tueſday 26. A flag of truce came to treat concerning ranſoming the town, which was at laſt agreed on for 30,000 dollars. We were to have three hoſtages, and to ſtay at Puna till they could raiſe the money.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday 27. The hoſtages came on board; and we took down our Union flag, and hoiſted a flag of truce, firing a gun for a ſignal that the Spaniards might come into the town, and that no farther hoſtilities ſhould be committed on either ſide.</p>
            <p>Thurſday 28. Our barks weighed with the beginning of the ebb, the Duke's pinnace making the beſt of her way down to the ſhips; and the float, after going aſhore to fetch off the great guns, weighed alſo, and fell down the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>Friday 29. Captain Rogers came aboard, and gave us an account that they had taken, plundered, and ranſomed the town of Guaya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil; that three of our men had been killed,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0204000302:39"/>
two by our own people, and one by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, and four wounded, that the inhabitants, whilſt treating, had carried off their money and plate, retiring to the woods, and leaving their guns, four whereof were taken, with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable quantity of meal, peaſe, ſugar, brandy, and wine, all which was coming down in the barks. This day Hugh Tidcomb, who was ſhot by his fellow-centinel, died. At four in the afternoon, ſpied a ſail ſtanding up the river with the tide of flood: we ſent both ſhips boats after her, and before night they brought her in. She was a ſmall Spaniſh bark from Cheripe, having on board 330 bags of meal, 35 hundred weight of ſugar, ſome onions, quinces, and pomegranates. This, with the ſix barks, and two great ſhips ranſomed by the town of Guayaquil, made fourteen prizes taken in thoſe ſeas.</p>
            <p>Sunday 30. Captain Rogers went aboard the French built ſhip to carry her up to Puna, in hopes of diſpoſing of her cargo and ſome of the blacks, who only ſerved to eat up our provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; as alſo to bring down what water and proviſions could be got; Captain Courtney being gone there before on the ſame account.</p>
            <p>Monday, May 1. A boat came down from the town with part of the ranſom, whereupon moſt of the priſoners were ſet on ſhore.</p>
            <p>Thurſday 5. Captain Rogers returned with the French-built ſhip, the Spaniards having brought none of her cargo; but they had paid
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0204000302:40"/>
24,000 dollars, part of the 30,000 ranſom; upon which, the Governor of Puna, one of the hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, was diſcharged, but the others kept.</p>
            <p>Friday 6. In the afternoon the Duke and the prizes joined us, when we were ſeven ſail in all. A boat came down with about 3000 dollars more, in money and plate; and the men told us, that the other 3000 dollars would ſoon come, and 12,000 more to purchaſe goods: but this we ſuppoſed to be a trick to keep us till the men-of-war ſhould come from Lima; whereupon we made all poſſible diſpatch to get out of the bay, kept three of the hoſtages, and ſent the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners aſhore. The Beginning, being of no other uſe, ſince we had better veſſels, we ſold to the Spaniards for the value of 50l. in pearl, gold chains, &amp;c. and put the priſoners aboard, but kept pilots, and a man that could ſpeak Engliſh, the Preſident of Panama's ſon, and the hoſtages. The weather being very hot, ſome of our men fell into fevers; and in a few days we had near 100 ſick, and among the number Capt. Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>Sunday 8. Sailed with a ſmall breeze at N. W. At noon it began to blow freſh; but nothing material happened till the 13th, when, believing ourſelves near the longitude of the Gallapagoes, where we deſigned to water, fit our ſhips, and refreſh our men, we lay by from ſix in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till four the next morning, for fear of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by thoſe iſlands in the night.</p>
            <p>Monday 16. Mr. Hopkins, Lieutenant of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0204000302:41"/>
marines, and one of the doctors of the Duke, died.</p>
            <p>Tueſday 17. Saw land, being one of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapagoe iſlands. Next day the Duke's boat went on ſhore to ſeek for water, but could find none in any of them, tho' Captain Cowley, in his voyage round the round, ſays there is good water in one of them; but we miſſed the place.</p>
            <p>The 20th, 21ſt, and 22d, we ſpent in plying among the iſlands, where the boats found abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of turtle, large rock-fiſh, and guanos. Theſe laſt named creatures are larger here than thoſe in other parts of the Weſt Indies, and are of ſeveral colours and ſizes. They are eaten by the ſeamen, and reckoned good meat, though their deformity made me loathe them.</p>
            <p>Thurſday 26. Captain Rogers and Captain Dover came aboard the Dutcheſs, and, after holding a council, it was reſoled to run in for the iſland of Plata to water, and ſo come off again, for fear of meeting with two French ſhips, one of 60, and the other of 46 guns, and the Spaniſh men-of-war, which, we were told, would be ſhortly in ſearch of us. Some days before this we loſt Mr. Hatley, who was in one of the prizes, with five or ſix white men, four blacks, and an Indian, having on board little or no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions or water, and no boat; and we never more heard of them.</p>
            <p>Monday 30. The officers of the Duke came aboard, to conſult about the propereſt place to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reen and water at; and 'twas agreed to go to the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0204000302:42"/>
iſland Gorgona, to ſee whether any Spaniſh ſhips were there, and from thence to Mangla, where are ſome indians, enemies to the Spaniards, who, it was ſaid, would ſupply us with ſwine and fowls, good water, turtle, plantains, and other refreſhments.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday, June 1. Some of our men were told, that a conſpiracy was forming on board the galleon among the priſoners and blacks. We examined the Spaniards, who proteſted they knew nothing of it; then put matches between the fingers of two blacks, making them believe we would burn them to the bone if they would not confeſs. They owned there had been a talk of killing the Engliſh among the Indians and blacks, but they believed it was not in earneſt; however, they were diſperſed into ſeveral ſhips to break, the combination.</p>
            <p>Sunday 5. Saw a ſail right-a-head of us, chaced, and at eight in the evening came up with her, fired a chace-gun, and ſhe ſtruck. The veſſel was of about 80 tons burden, bound from Panama for Guayaquil, was laden with iron and other merchandize, and had two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and ſeveral paſſengers of note on board, one of whom was going Governor to Baldivia, whoſe name wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Monday 6. Made the beſt of our way for Gorgona; and at three in the afternoon next day, the Duke with the galleon came to an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor

in that harbour. Same day ſaw a ſail bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down towards the iſland, till ſpying the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon in the offing, ſhe ſtood to the weſtward. I went out in the pinnace well-manned, and at noon took and brought her to an anchor. She was a bark of 50 tons, called El Soldado, came out of a ſmall port the night before, and was bound for Guayaquil, to load ſalt, brandy, &amp;c. She had in her in gold chains and money to the value of 5 or 6 hundred pounds, deſigned to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe her cargo.</p>
            <p>Monday 13. Held a full council on board the Duke, and reſolved to careen our ſhips here as ſoon as poſſible. Here we continued till Sunday, Auguſt the 7th; and in the mean time plundered a ſettlement on the main, right oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite the iſland, ſet moſt of our priſoners on ſhore on the continent, and brought ſeven beeves, 14 hogs, ſome poultry, about 50 buſhels of Indian wheat, and a few goats on board: at the ſame time a black born in Jamaica, who ſpoke very good Engliſh, and had been taken with ſome Jamaica-men eight years before, came over to us in a canoe. Captain Morel, too, formerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the galleon, brought ſome money and fruit, and a merchant or two, who bought ſome of our blacks. During our ſtay at this iſland, Captain Rogers, Captain Courtney, myſelf, and ſome other officers, underwent much fatigue in fitting up the Marquis, for which ſhip we were forced to get entirely new maſts and yards, make moſt of the ſails, and a great deal of new cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0204000302:44"/>
The ſmith alſo made much new work; as did the carpenters, ſail makers, riggers, and rope-makers, who all came to help us from each ſhip.</p>
            <p>The 6th of Auguſt, I received my orders to command the Marquis, carrying 20 guns, 60 white men, and 16 blacks; and, the ſhips having taken in their loading from the prizes, and all our buſineſs being over at the iſland of Gorgona, we weighed anchor at 10 in the morning, and ran to the north of the iſland: but the maſts of the Marquis being new and heavy, and a great weight of goods between decks, I found ſhe proved crank, and ſailed dull upon the wind; ſo that the Duke and Dutcheſs were fain to ſpare a great deal of ſail for me to keep up with them.</p>
            <p>Friday 12. Held a conſultation about ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Marquis and a bark laden with bale-goods directly for India, to ſave proviſions and gain time; but this was oppoſed by Captain Courtney, and others, in regard to the Marquis, which being a good veſſel, might be of great uſe in caſe we ſhould meet with the Manilla ſhip, or the men-of-war we ſuppoſed were look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us.</p>
            <p>Thurſday, Auguſt 18. At ſix in the morning ſaw a ſail a-head, gave chace, and the Dutcheſs ſoon coming up with her, and firing a few guns, ſhe ſtruck, being a bark of about 70 tons, bound from Panama to Troxillo, with merchants goods, paſſengers, and blacks, on board. The maſter told us, he had been detained three months at Panama by an embargo, which being taken off
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0204000302:45"/>
upon advice that we were going to the iſland of Juan Fernandez, he had ſet ſail. Enquiring what ſhips were out in queſt of us, the priſoners ſaid, they had advice at Panama of five or ſix ſhips being ordered after us, two of them French, of 48 guns each, and ſome Spaniſh, of the like force, and good ſailors. They could tell no other news, than that the whole coaſt was alarmed.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 19. The Duke and Dutcheſs fired ſome vollies to exerciſe their men. Next day we fell in with land about a league to the lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Tacames, ran within a league of the ſhore, and on the 24th caſt anchor in the bay, from whence the Dutcheſs ſent her pinnace aſhore for water, but could get none. Tacames is a village of only ſeven houſes and a church, ſtanding in a bay, about ſeven leagues to the northward of Cape Franciſco. The houſes are built of ſplit bamboes, and covered with Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meto-leaves, ſtanding on ſtilts or poſts; and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſtairs, they have a piece of timber cut in notches to aſcend by. The men employ themſelves in killing wild ſwine with bows and arrows, and ſtriking fiſh with their lances, at both which they are very dexterous. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have only a piece of baize tied about their middle, and carry their children at their backs. They are under the authority of the Spaniſh prieſts, and are not permitted to trade without their licence.</p>
            <p>On the 27th. They received a letter of leave,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0204000302:46"/>
and our boats went aſhore to the houſes for cattle; and on the 28th and 29th continued trading and watering till we had ſufficiently ſupplied the ſhips. In return for the civility of theſe Fathers, I ſent as a preſent to the church at Tacames four large images, one of which was the Virgin Mary with our Lord and Saviour in her arms; and I believe Captain Rogers and Captain Courtney alſo gave ſomething to adorn their church. On Wedneſday the 31ſt of Auguſt we ſet ſail, the wind being at S. W.</p>
            <p>Thurſday, Sept 1. Saw abundance of water-ſnakes, one of which was coming up the ſide of our ſhip, and our men beat it off. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards ſay, there is no cure for ſuch as are bit by them; and one of our blacks happened to fall under that misfortune, and died, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the utmoſt care was taken by our ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons to recover him.</p>
            <p>On Wedneſday, Sept. 7. Made one of the Gallapagoe iſlands. On the 10th, ſtood cloſe in for the head-land, ſending our boat on ſhore for water and turtle. At night our boat came aboard, bringing 13 turtle, ſome weighing 200 weight; the other boats got near 50 each; and the Dutcheſs's ſeveral land-turtle, but no water. Our men ſaw ſeveral jars, and ſome of the wreck and rudder of a veſſel, and ſhould have gueſſed it to be the prize, Captain Hatley, loſt when here before, but the rudder was too ſmall for her.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday 14. The Dutcheſs, Marquis, and ſmall prize, weighed, ran out, and lay by for the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0204000302:47"/>
Duke, which could not get out for want of wind. On the 15th, ſet ſail in the morning; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſun was directly over our heads, the weather was cold, occaſioned, as I believe, by the ſoutherly winds, which are coldeſt in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>Thurſday, Sept. 22. The Marquis kept the pump continually going, having ſprung two leaks, not being well caulked at Gorgona; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore weared her on the other tack, and ſtopt one leak, but could not find the other, being about the ſtern. Weared again, and ſtood to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>Friday 22. At a conſultation on board the Duke, it was agreed to ſteer to the iſlands Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, for a convenient place to refit, wood, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; then to cruiſe in queſt of the Manilla ſhip, which was large, and of great value, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Spaniards to be worth 2,000,000 ſterling.</p>
            <p>On the 3d of October. Cape Corientes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, bearing N. E. 10 leagues; and on the 4th in the morning we made the iſlands called Tres Marias, at the diſtance of about 16 leagues; but could not fetch them till the 6th, when we got under the lee of one of them. I lay off with the ſhip, and ſent the boat aſhore for water and turtle; but neither the one nor the other was to be got, becauſe of the ſurff.</p>
            <p>Before our coming to this place, we diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the white rock, formerly mentioned by Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, and took it for a ſhip; on the ſight of which the Dutcheſs let go the bark ſhe had in tow, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0204000302:48"/>
her to make the beſt of her way to the middle iſland; under the lee of which both the Duke and Dutcheſs came to an anchor on the 7th and 8th; and I might have been there as ſoon, had I not ſeen the bark ſix or ſeven leagues to lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. It was fortunate that I came in time to relieve her, otherwiſe ſhe muſt have periſhed, having neither wood nor water on board, and not being able to make up againſt the wind and current to reach the land. I bore down to her, ſupplied her wants, and took her in tow till the 20th in the morning, when the middle iſland bearing north, diſtant about ſeven leagues, we ſaw a ſail coming from the iſland before the wind, which proved the Dutcheſs, who came in ſearch of us, and was glad to find us ſafe; brought us ſome water and turtle, and told us there was game enough in the iſland, if we could bear up to it. Captain Courtney took us in tow, to help us in the ſooner, having cleaned his ſhip's bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom before he ſet ſail to come to our aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>On the 11th, I came to an anchor, after much trouble and fatigue in plying ſo long againſt the wind and current. Seven of Captain Rogers's beſt blacks this day left him, and ran away. We continued in this bay till</p>
            <p>Monday the 24th, when a general council was held, at which it was reſolved to cruiſe off Cape St. Lucas for the Manilla ſhip, all our ſhips be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now very well fitted, wooded, watered, and provided with turtle. Several warm debates hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in council among our chief officers; and,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0204000302:49"/>
Captain Dover quitted the Duke, and went on board the Dutcheſs, by his own free choice. I endeavoured to accommodate theſe differences, but to no purpoſe, which gave ſeveral of us great concern.</p>
            <p>The iſlands of Tres Marias, where we anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, abound with animals of various kinds, and the ſhores with fiſh; among theſe the ſea and land turtle may be accounted of moſt uſe to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators. Of the ſea-turtle there are various ſorts; as the green, which are the ſweeteſt and beſt; the hawk's-bill, which are very good; and the logger-head, which the ſailors never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe when the others are not to be caught. The method of taking them is by turning them, and when they are on their backs, they appear as in the Plate, fig. 1.</p>
            <p>The land-turtle lives conſtantly aſhore, feeds upon graſs, moves very ſlow, and, when an enemy approaches, covers itſelf under its ſhell, ſquatting cloſe to the ground, from which it is not eaſily diſcernible, appearing like a bare patch without verdure. The ſhells of theſe animals are ſo hard, that a man may tread upon them without hurting them. Their fleſh is very good and nouriſhing. They will live five or ſix weeks without food, and appear to be never the worſe. They lay round eggs, about the ſize of a hen's, and are very good to eat. Some of the ſea-turtle taken in the bay where we anchored had 200 eggs in them. Our men liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt wholly upon turtle, and their eggs, from the time they went firſt to the Gallapagoes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0204000302:50"/>
till their departure for the Eaſt Indies, ſaving their ſhip-proviſions till their run acroſs the South Seas. For the land-turtle, ſee fig. 2.</p>
            <p>At theſe iſlands our men caught plenty of the fiſh called old wives. They have very ſmall mouths, large eyes, a high fin on the back, and ſhaped as you ſee fig. 3. The colour of the body is a deep blue; the fins of a lighter colour, tipped with yellow. Others are of an aſh colour on the back, and white under the belly.</p>
            <p>The rock-fiſh we caught in the iſland of Tres Marias were large, had great mottled fins, yellow backs, red bellies, and red and black tails. See fig. 4.</p>
            <p>Another fiſh our men caught was the cavallo, in ſhape not much unlike the dolphin, with a large bright eye, black back, white belly, a long ſtreak from his gills to the middle of his tail, and is about the ſize of a mackarel. See fig. 5.</p>
            <p>A ſmall fiſh we found there, about ſix inches long, was very delicious; the back of an indigo blue, a deep yellow ſtreak running from the gills to the tail, the belly white, and the tail forked. It ſeems peculiar to theſe iſlands, and wants a name. See fig. 6.</p>
            <p>Of the animals, the racoon was the moſt plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. It has a large black eye, whiſkers and noſe like a pig, tail and feet like a rat, a browniſh fur on his back, and a white belly. See fig. 7.</p>
            <p>Of the venomous creatures, the ſcorpion is the moſt noxious; its tail is jointed with a ſmall ſting at the tip; it has two claws like thoſe of

the lobſter; and its head and feet have a near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to thoſe of the ſame fiſh. See fig. 8.</p>
            <p>Among the ſinging-birds found in thoſe iſlands, the cardinal bird was ſeen in greateſt abundance. It is a very beautiful bird, with ſcarlet feathers, and on its head the male has a tuft of the ſame colour. They are of the ſame kind with thoſe we call the Virginia Nightingale; but the Spaniards call them cardinal birds, from their ſcarlet feathers. See fig. 9.</p>
            <p>Among the vegetables we found the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-plant, or ſilk-graſs, of which the Indians make ropes, ſails, ſacks, and all their curious netting. It alſo yields a liquor of which they make wine, honey, and a good balſam. The liquor as it comes from the plant is as ſweet as ſugar; after ſtanding it becomes a wine, and will intoxicate powerfully. It has thick juicy leaves, not unlike thoſe of the houſeleek, but grows up to a conſiderable height in the form repreſented by fig. 10. And, when it has ſtood about ſix years, the Indians cut out the middle leaves, leaving the heart of the plant hollow, which of itſelf fills with the juice, and is every morning during the ſeaſon taken out and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Of this juice the Spaniards make ſpirits; and it is ſo univerſally uſed in one ſhape or other by the Spaniards and Indians in New Spain, that the duty ariſing from it in one year is ſaid to have amounted to 110,000 pieces of eight at the port of Angels alone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0204000302:53"/>The prickly tree found on thoſe iſlands is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great curioſity. The trunk of it is angular, and covered with prickles; is of a pale green, and yields a gum which the druggiſts call euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium, which is ſaid to be powerful in removing pains in the head. It grows about 12 feet high, in the form repreſented in the plate, fig. 11.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the principal peculiarities obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the animal and vegetable tribes at the iſlands of Tres Marias.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday, Oct 2, at two in the afternoon, we weighed, and ſet ſail for Cape St. Lucas, where we ſpread ourſelves for fear the Manilla ſhip ſhould paſs by unſeen. The Duke cruiſed about two leagues to the ſouthward of the Dutcheſs, the Dutcheſs in the middle, and the Marquis two leagues to the northward of her. Place of rendezvous ſix or ſeven leagues in ſight of Cape St. Lucas.</p>
            <p>Nov. 1. The Marquis ſprang two great leaks, and broke the collar of the fore-ſtay, which obliged me to wear the ſhip to fix the ſtay, and then hauled up after the other ſhips, and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the leaks.</p>
            <p>Tueſday 2. All the officers and men on board the Marquis ſigned an inſtrument, oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to ſtand by the articles agreed to by the companies of the other ſhips.</p>
            <p>Nov. 4. I ſpoke with Captain Courtney, and changed ſtations with him, he having better boats than mine to ſend aſhore for water and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0204000302:54"/>
turtle; or, in caſe of ſeeing the Manilla ſhip, to prevent her ſending the paſſengers aſhore with their wealth. The 10th, the Duke and Dutcheſs having ſpoken with each other, changed ſtations, the Duke going in for the ſhore, and the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs off to the outward ſtation.</p>
            <p>Nov. 22. Captain Rogers informed me, that the bark and his boat had been in with the ſhore, and had ſpoken with the natives, who ſeemed very civil, and had pearl and ſome grain to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of; and that there was wood and water enough. Nothing material happened till</p>
            <p>Dec. 13, when we had a conſultation on board the Dutcheſs, to enquire into the ſtock of proviſions on board the ſhips, and found by the accounts given in, that only three months meat at ſhort allowance, and two months bread, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unexpended; and, as there was no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Manilla ſhip, though the uſual time of her coming was elapſed, it was agreed to make all poſſible diſpatch in fitting up the ſhips, in order to make the beſt of our way acroſs the Pacific Ocean, that we might take the advantage of the trade-winds to carry us to Guam on our return home. In purſuance of this reſolution, I was ordered into harbour, as the Marquis want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more conſiderable repairs than either of the other two, and the Duke and Dutcheſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to cruiſe a few days longer, while I was getting forward to be in readineſs to accompany them to Europe.</p>
            <p>On the 14th, I bore away for Puerto Segura,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0204000302:55"/>
and on the 15th entered the harbour at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</p>
            <p>On the 16th proceeded to buſineſs, my firſt orders being to return again to cruiſe as ſoon as poſſible; but theſe orders were afterwards coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termanded, it being abſolutely neceſſary that all the ſhips ſhould rendezvous together before their final departure from the American coaſt.</p>
            <p>This place is inhabited by about 200 Indians, living in huts made of boughs of trees and reeds, built like a bower, with a fire in the middle, round which they lie and ſleep. They all go naked, only the women have ſhort petticoats made of ſilk graſs, or elſe of pelicans or deers ſkins. The men are ſtraight, and well limbed; live by fiſhing and hunting, and value knives, ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, nails, or iron, beyond gold and ſilver. They have long black hair, and are of a dark brown complexion. The women are very ordinary, and employ themſelves in gathering and grinding corn, and in making fiſhing-lines. They are very honeſt and very civil. They aſſiſted in fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the ſhips, and took nothing away but what was given them. Our people at their firſt coming got ſome pearls among them, but I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could ſee any afterwards. I made ſigns for them to bring gold; but they pointed up to the mountains. They uſe bows and arrows, and even the boys are ſo dexterous as to kill birds flying with them.</p>
            <p>Dec. 22. Being buſy about our repairs, at 10 in the morning heard ſome guns firing in the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0204000302:56"/>
offing: I bent my ſails to haſten to the aſſiſtance of my conſorts, but the ſea breeze coming on rendered it impoſſible; whereupon I aſcended an adjacent hill, and ſaw our ſhips engage and take the Manilla ſhip, which we had been ſo long expecting,</p>
            <p>The account Captain Rogers gives of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement is as follows: <q rend="inline">"At day-break, ſays he, we ſaw the chace upon our weather-bow about a league from us, the Dutcheſs a-head of her to leeward, near about half as far. Towards ſix in the morning our boat came on board, having kept very near the chace all night, and received no damage; but told us the Dutcheſs paſſed by her in the night, and ſhe fired two ſhot at him; but they returned none. We had no wind, but got out eight of our ſhip's oars, and rowed about an hour, when there ſprung up a ſmall breeze. I ordered a large kettle of chocolate to be made for our ſhip's company, having no ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors to give them. Then we went to prayers; and before we had concluded, were diſturbed by the enemy's firing at us. They had barrels hanging at each yard-arm that looked like pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-barrels, to deter us from boarding them. About eight o'clock we began to engage her by ourſelves, for the Dutcheſs being to leeward, and having little wind, did not come up. The enemy fired her ſtern chace upon us firſt, which we returned with our fore-chace ſeveral times, till we came nearer, and went cloſe on board each other. We gave her ſeveral broadſides, plying
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0204000302:57"/>
our ſmall arms very briſkly, which they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as thick for a while, but did not ply their great guns with the ſame alacrity. After ſome time, we ſhot a little a-head of them, lying thwart her hawſe, cloſe aboard; and plied her ſo warmly, that ſhe ſoon ſtruck her colours two-thirds down. By this time the Dutcheſs came up, and fired about five guns, with a volley of ſmall ſhot; but the enemy, having ſubmitted, made no return. We ſent our pinnace on board, and brought the Captain with the officers away; and, having examined them, found there came another ſhip out from Manilla with them of larger burden, having about 40 braſs guns mounted, and as many patararoes; but they told us they loſt her company about three months ago, and reckoned ſhe was got to Acapulco be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, ſhe ſailing better than this ſhip.
<p>This prize was called by the ſwelling name of Noſtra Signiora de la Incarnacion Deſengenio, Sir John Pichberty Commander. She had 20 guns, 20 patararoes, and 193 men on board, whereof nine were killed, ten wounded, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral blown up with powder. We engaged them about three glaſſes, in which time we had only myſelf and another man wounded. I was ſhot through the left check; the bullet ſtruck away part of my upper jaw, and ſeveral of my teeth, part of which dropt down upon the deck where I fell; and the other, an Iriſh landman, was ſlightly wounded in the hip. They did us
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0204000302:58"/>
no great damage in our rigging, but their ſhot diſabled our mizzen-maſt. I was forced to write what I had to ſay to prevent the loſs of blood, and becauſe of the pain I ſuffered by ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>On the 23d of December, after putting our ſhips to rights, we ſtood in for the harbour, which was diſtant about ſeven leagues to the N. E. Our ſurgeons went on board the prize to dreſs their wounded men. About four in the afternoon we came to an anchor, and received the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all on board the Marquis on our ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unexpected ſucceſs, which gave us no ſmall ſatisfaction. We found that ſhip in good condition, ready to ſail, and all the men on board her very briſk, and eager for action.</p>
                  <p>At eight in the evening, we held a conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the two great points; firſt, what ſhould be done with the priſoners and hoſtages; and next, how we ſhould act with regard to the other Manilla ſhip, which we thought at leaſt there was a great probability of taking.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the firſt, we propoſed, as the hoſtages from Guayaquil were men of honour, and as we had good reaſon to believe that the Chevalier Pichberty, being brother to the famous M. du Caſs, was the ſame, to make the beſt terms we could with them, and ſet them at liberty. Accordingly, we put a part of the goods on board the bark into the prize, and then offered the remainder with the bark, together with what remained unpaid of the ranſom, for 6000 pieces of eight, and to take the Chevalier's bills pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0204000302:59"/>
at London for the money. This they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and gave us an acknowledgment at the ſame time, that they thought it a good bargain. When this was ſettled, we had nothing more to do than to provide for our own ſecurity, and to look after the other galleon.</p>
                  <p>I was very deſirous of going out with the Dutcheſs to cruiſe for her; but there having been ſome reflections caſt, on account of the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs's not engaging our laſt prize ſo ſoon as it was thought ſhe might have done, Captain Courtney was abſolutely bent on going out with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis; and the officers of both ſhips voting for this in council, my propoſal was over-ruled, and we were forced to ſtay in the harbour againſt our will. It was, however, agreed, that we ſhould put 10 of our beſt hands on board the Dutcheſs; and on Chriſtmas-eve ſhe and the Marquis ſail'd."</p>
               </q>—We now return to Captain Cooke in the Marquis.</p>
            <p>Sunday 25. At eight in the morning, being two leagues off Cape St. Lucas, we ſaw a ſail diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant about ſeven leagues, which we concluded to be the ſhip we were in purſuit of. The Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs was two leagues to the weſtward, and we both gave chace. At noon the enemy bore ſouth, diſtant about five leagues. At 12 at night, the Dutcheſs got along-ſide, and began to engage her. Captain Courtney fought her bravely about four glaſſes, and then lay by to ſecure his maſts, and knot his rigging, which were much wounded and ſhattered. Our ſhip not being ſo
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0204000302:60"/>
good a ſailor as the Dutcheſs, could not come up.</p>
            <p>Monday 26. As ſoon as it was day, we ſaw the Spaniard's flag, and knew him to be the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of the Manilla. At eight we perceived the Duke coming out to us. At two in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon we got alongſide the enemy; but the wind ſhifting, could fetch no nearer than about half muſket-ſhot to leeward of her. She then fired two ſhot at us, and we returned a broadſide and vollies of ſmall arms, beginning the combat with three cheers. When we had fought two glaſſes, the Dutcheſs came up under her ſtern, and raked her fore and aft, and then fell aſtern again, we ſtill continuing hot at her for five glaſſes: then weared, and ſtood to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to fetch nearer up to her; for firing ſo many guns had laid us to leeward. The Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs went up, and engaged again very briſkly for half an hour, and then ſtretched a-head of her. We could perceive many ſhot in her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween wind and water. At five we tacked, and raked her fore and aft with our ſtarboard broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, then weared under her ſtern, and did the ſame with our larboard broadſide; and firing ſeveral vollies while we loaded our larboard guns again, gave her the other broadſide. By this time it grew dark, and we fell a ſtern, to ſpeak with the Dutcheſs, and to get more ammunition, having but three rounds of ſhot for moſt of our guns left. At eight I went on board the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, and found her much diſabled in her maſts
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0204000302:61"/>
and rigging, and had ſeven men killed and wounded. Capt Courtney and I agreed to be yard-arm and yard-arm with the enemy in the morning, he to lie on the bow, and I on the quarter; and if he boarded, I was to clap him aboard, and enter my men over him. Being ſupplied with more ammunition, I returned on board the Marquis, both of us keeping cloſe under the chace's quarter, and firing guns all night, to annoy the enemy, and to give the Duke notice where we were. Before day the Duke joined us. The chace, miſtaking him for her conſort, had made ſignals all night, and had edged away to meet him, otherwiſe the Duke could not have come up, there being but very little wind, and that contrary.</p>
            <p>Then we all three agreed to fall upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at once, as ſoon as it was light; but while we lay athwart her hawſe, thoſe guns that miſſed the enemy flew through the Duke's maſts and rigging, which obliged him to change his ſtation, and to draw up along-ſide cloſe aboard her, where he kept up a conſtant fire of round ſhot, all other ſhot proving ineffectual, becauſe of the ſtrength of the ſhip's ſides, which no other ſhot would penetrate; and as none of the Spaniards appeared in ſight, but all kept to cloſe quarters, it was in vain to make uſe of ſmall arms, except now and then, when a man appeared to obſerve our ſituation, and to keep an eye upon their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. In this manner, the Dutcheſs lying upon her hawſe, the Duke along her broadſide, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0204000302:62"/>
the Marquis athwart her ſtern, we kept pelting her for four glaſſes; and, in the mean time, the Duke received a ſhot in his main-maſt, which much diſabled it; and, in ſhifting, both he and the Dutcheſs came back cloſe under the enemy, and had like to have been all aboard her. The Duke, in endeavouring to recover his ſtation, received a fire ball, which lighting upon his quarter deck, blew up a cheſt of arms and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch-boxes, all loaded, and ſeveral cartridges of powder in the ſteerage, by which means Mr. Vanbrugh, our agent, and two others, were very much burnt; the Dutcheſs going to laſh to the enemy, was forced to caſt off, and get clear, for fear of being ſet on fire. The enemy fired at us all three at once, but ſlowly, ſeldom miſſing our maſts and rigging, and ſometimes hulling us. After lying near half an hour along the chace's ſide, the Dutcheſs lay by to ſtop her leaks, and ſecure her fore-maſt, being very much diſabled, having 25 men killed and wounded, and the ſails and rigging much ſhattered. Captain Rogers ſome time after lay by to ſecure his maſt. Then I lay athwart the enemy's hawſe till I had fired three broadſides, ſome odd guns, and ſeveral vollies; then gave another broadſide and ſome vollies into her ſtern. The Duke came up again, and fired ſeveral guns, and both fell a-ſtern the chace, keeping under ſail, and ſtanding to the weſtward. We knotted ſome of our rigging, and ſtopt our leaks made with twelve pounders. Our main-maſt was diſabled alſo, the ſails and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0204000302:63"/>
rigging much ſhattered; but the enemy, aiming to diſable my maſts, I had the good fortune to have only my ſecond mate, and ſome others, blown up with powder. The ſhip was once ſet on fire by the enemy's ſtink-pots, but we ſoon put it out. About eleven I wore the ſhip, and deſigned to have attacked the enemy again; but, ſeeing the Duke and Dutcheſs lying by, the one with a waift in his enſign, and the other with a Spaniſh jack, the ſignals to ſpeak with one another, I brought to. Captain Courtney came on board of me, and we both went on board the Duke; where we conſidered the condition the three ſhips were in, their maſts and rigging being much damaged in a place where we could get no recruit; that if we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged her again we could propoſe to do no more than what we had already done, which was evident did her no great hurt, becauſe we could perceive few of our ſhot entered her ſides to any purpoſe, and our ſmall arms availed leſs, there being not a man to be ſeen above board; that the leaſt thing in the world would bring the Duke's main-maſt, and likewiſe the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs's foremaſt, by the board, either of which by its fall might carry away another maſt, and lay us a perfect butt for the enemy, having nothing to command our ſhips with; ſo that by his heavy guns he might either ſink or take us; that, if we went to board him, we ſhould run a great hazard in loſing a great many men with little hope of ſucceſs, they having above treble the number on board to oppoſe us, and there
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0204000302:64"/>
being now, in all our three ſhips, not above 120 men fit for boarding, and thoſe but weak, having been very ſhort of proviſions; ſo that, if we had boarded her, and been forced off, or left any of our men behind, the enemy by that means would have known our ſtrength, and then gone into the harbour, and took poſſeſſion of the prize in ſpite of all we could do to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it. Beſides our ammunition was very ſhort, having only enough to engage a few glaſſes longer. All this being ſeriouſly conſidered, and knowing the difficulty we ſhould have to get maſts, and the time and proviſions we muſt ſpend before we could get them fitted, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to forbear attempting her farther, ſince our battering her ſignified little, and we had not ſtrength enough to board her; therefore, we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to keep her company till night, and then to loſe her, and make the beſt of our way into the harbour to ſecure the prize we had already taken. We engaged firſt and laſt about ſeven hours, during all which time they had on board the Duke but eleven men wounded, among whom was the Captain for the ſecond time, who had part of his heel-bone ſtruck out with a ſplinter, and all under his ancle cut above half through with the ſame; on board the Dutcheſs, they had eleven killed, and more than that number wounded; and on board us only two men ſcorched with gun-powder. The enemy's was a brave, lofty, new ſhip, named the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, and this the firſt voyage ſhe had made. Her burden was 900 tons, and her complement
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0204000302:65"/>
of men 450, beſides paſſengers, 150 of whom were European pirates, who, having now got all their wealth on board, were reſolved to defend it to the laſt. The gunner, who had a poſt at Manilla, was an expert man, and had provided for her defence with great ſkill. He had filled up all the ſpace between the guns with bales to ſecure the men. We ſhattered her ſails and rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging very much, ſhot away her mizzen-yard, and killed two of her men out of her tops, which was all the damage we could ſee done, though we could not place leſs than 500 ſhot in her hull. Thus ended our attempt.</p>
            <p>Theſe large ſhips are built at Manilla, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent timber that will not ſplinter; and their ſides are thicker and ſtronger than thoſe of ſhips of the ſame burden conſtructed in Europe. Had we been together at firſt, and boarded her, we might, perhaps, have taken her; but, after her netting and cloſe quarters were fixed, ſhe valued us but little. We might, indeed, have burnt her, at the expence of one of our ſhips; but that was objected to, not only from a principle of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but becauſe we had goods of great value on board all our ſhips.</p>
            <p>The enemy had heard at Manilla, that there were two ſhips fitted out at Briſtol to cruiſe in the South Seas, and that Captain Dampier was to be their pilot; they had, therefore, provided for their own defence accordingly. However, to do them juſtice, they fought gallantly; and, had the two ſhips been together, it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that neither of them had been taken;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0204000302:66"/>
but as it happened, had not our unreaſonable ſquabbles prevented our ſailing out together, the chance would have rather been in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: yet this miſcarriage, inſtead of leading to a reconciliation, ſerved only as a foundation for new diſputes.</p>
            <p>On the 1ſt of Jan. 1710, we returned again into port, and determined to haſten home with all poſſible diſpatch. The firſt thing of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was to diſcharge our priſoners, and to provide for their voyage to Acapulco; and this being diſpatched, we applied to the ſettling of our own affairs. We ſpent our time till the 7th in repairing the damage our ſhips had received from the enemy, in taking in wood and water for our voyage to the Eaſt Indies, and in taking an account of the goods and ſtores on board the prize: and it was no ſmall ſatisfaction to find as much bread on board the prize as with our own ſtock would ſerve us, at ſhort allowance, during our long run to Guam.</p>
            <p>About this time a warm conteſt aroſe about appointing a Commander of the Manilla ſhip, which was looked upon as a truſt of no ſmall conſequence. Captain Dover, being an owner, deſired he might command in chief on board her. Captain Rogers and ſeveral officers of the council contended, that, as Captain Dover was wholly unacquainted with the navigating part of the buſineſs, the command ſhould be given to Captain Fry, or myſelf; but, as I had already the command of the Marquis, I declined any
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0204000302:67"/>
farther charge, and voted for Captain Dover; at the ſame time recommending Captain Fry and Captain Stretton to act under him; againſt which Captain Rogers and his officers entered their proteſt. However, on the 9th of January, at a full council, it was carried againſt them, and voted by a great majority, that the Captains Fry and Stretton ſhould both act in equal poſt in the ſole navigating the Batchelor Frigate (for that was the name now given to the Manilla prize), and in fighting her, if occaſion ſhould require, under Captain Dover, who at the ſame time was reſtrained from interrupting them in their buſineſs, but charged to be careful of what was in the ſhip, and to ſee that nothing was acted on board contrary to the intereſt of the owners and captors. The matter being thus qualified, the nominal command given to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Dover, and the executive power veſted in the naval officers, Captain Rogers withdrew his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and the council proceeded to the choice of the inferior officers, appointing Alexander Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk maſter, and Joſeph Smith, chief mate: they alſo agreed to furniſh her complement of men, by ſelecting 30 from the Duke, 25 from the Dutcheſs, and 13 from the Marquis, which, with 36 Laſcars taken on board her, formed a tolerable crew of more than 100 mariners. This buſineſs being thus fully ſettled, and the iſland of Guam pitched upon as the place of rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous in caſe of ſeparation, on the 10th of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary we weighed anchor, and ran out at midnight.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0204000302:68"/>
At 12 the next day Cape St. Lucas bore north, diſtant about five leagues. We ſteered away for ſome days S. W. by S. till we got into the trade-winds, and then our courſe was uniform.</p>
            <p>All the natives of California that we ſaw dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſtay at Puerto Seguro did not amount to 300. They had large limbs, were very ſtraight and tall, and of a much darker complexion than any other people that we had met with in the South Seas. Their hair was long, lank, and black, and hung down upon their hips. The men were all ſtark-naked; but the women had a covering about their waiſts made of the ſilk-graſs already mentioned, fringed and knotted. All of them that we ſaw were old, and miſerably wrinkled; perhaps they concealed from us their maidens, for reaſons that need not be explained. The language of the natives was guttural, very harſh, and unpleaſant. They ſeemed to covet nothing that we had, except axes, ſaws, and knives; and even theſe they did not attempt to ſteal. Their huts were low, and wholly made up of branches of trees; and ſeemed rather a kind of temporary coverings than ſettled dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. While we lay in port they ſubſiſted chiefly on fiſh; and though they neither made uſe of nets or lines, yet they had a method of ſtriking them with lances that was very dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and at which they were very expert. They were beſides moſt excellent divers, and inſtead of canoes made uſe of rafts. They were very civil and inoffenſive; and were obſerved to pay
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0204000302:69"/>
great reſpect to one among them, whoſe head was adorned with feathers very artificially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined, and who probably was their wizard, or cunning man. Some of them had ſtrings of pearls, and party-coloured ſhells ſo prettily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed, that, though we had glaſs-beads, and other ſhowy trinkets, yet they paid no ſort of attention to any of them; but prized their own ornaments above every thing but cutting inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Their arms are bows and arrows, in the uſe of which their boys were ſo expert as to ſhoot birds flying by way of amuſement. They grew very familiar with us while we ſtaid, and came frequently to gaze at the men as they cut wood and filled water, but never offered to aſſiſt in any thing like labour. They get fire like other Indians, by rubbing two ſticks together, which kindle almoſt inſtantaneouſly.</p>
            <p>From this harbour we departed but very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly provided, having but little live-ſtock, and hardly any liquors but what were found in the prize. As ſoon as we were out of ſight of land, we were all put to ſhort allowance, officers and men: to the latter four-and-twenty ounces of flour, four pounds of meat, and two gallons of water, to a meſs of five men in 24 hours. But in a few days, the Batchelor made a ſignal to give us ſome bread, they having found a large quantity concealed, with ſome ſweet-meats. We had 500 weight for our ſhare, the Duke 1000 weight, and the Dutcheſs as much; in return for which we ſent back to the prize ſome caſks
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0204000302:70"/>
of flour, and a barrel of Engliſh beef; and the like preſent was returned from the other ſhips. From this time till the 10th of March nothing remarkable happened.</p>
            <p>On that day we made the iſland Saraua, one of the Ladrones, and the ſame evening came in ſight of Guam, diſtant about three leagues. Next day we came to anchor in the port of Umatta, at about a mile diſtance from the houſes, in lat. 13 deg. 30 min. N. by eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; long from Cape St. Lucas, 100 deg. 19 min. W. We went in with French and Spaniſh colours, that they might not ſuſpect us to be enemies. Several of their boats came about our ſhips; but none would venture on board, till being off the anchoring-place, one was ſent by the Spaniſh Governor, deſiring to know who we were, and what we wanted. We preſently diſpatched our interpreter with a letter, purport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we were ſubjects of Great Britain, and driven by neceſſity to ſtop at thoſe iſlands to purchaſe proviſions and other neceſſaries; that, if our wants were ſupplied with civility, we ſhould pay generouſly; but, on the contrary, if our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt was denied, we ſhould proceed to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laws of war. To this letter we received a very obliging anſwer from the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Governor. Don Juan Antonio Pimental, and were furniſhed with hogs, oxen, rice, maize, poultry, and other neceſſaries in a more plentiful manner, and at a cheaper rate, than we could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. We continued at Guam till the 21ſt of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0204000302:71"/>
March, during which time reciprocal civilities daily paſſed between the officers on board and the gentlemen of the iſland; and we parted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſatisfied with each other's behaviour. We found the variation in theſe parts only half a point to the eaſtward, though in our run acroſs the Great South Sea, we had it 12 degrees: the reaſon I take to be, the unevenneſs of the globe, and its unequal mixture of much matter differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in itſelf as to the magnetical quality; as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing large and ſtoney mountains, ſpacious vallies, deep ſeas, long continued continents, with migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſcattered rocks of load-ſtone, iron mines, and other magnetical ſubſtances.</p>
            <p>The natives of Guam are of a dark com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, but not ſo black as the Indians of Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fornia. They are in general the largeſt and beſt limbed men I ever ſaw, and ſome of them hairy, and very ſtrong. The women are ſtraight and tall, and in the neighbourhood of the Spaniards go decently cloathed; but in the remote parts of the iſland they go quite naked. They are ſaid to be man-eaters, and to have no ſettled way of worſhip, but every one pays a kind of adoration to they know not what. The iſland is plentifully ſupplied with cattle, and might be made the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the world, if the Spaniards were not as idle as the Indians; but as nature ſpontaneouſly produces ſufficient for ſuſtenance, they avail themſelves but little of cultivation. Of all the works of art for which the Indians are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, the paroas, or boats, of this iſland
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0204000302:72"/>
are certainly the moſt wonderful, as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in ſwift ſailing every other veſſel yet ſeen throughout the world. We were aſſured upon the beſt authority, that they will ſail 20 leagues an hour; and the Captain of the Spaniſh guard ſaid, he would loſe his head if they did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday, March 21, 1710, we were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſail, and ſteered away W. by S. with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate gales from the N. N. E. which continued ſo for ſome weeks; but about the middle of April the blowing weather came on, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till the 27th of that month, during which time moſt of our main-ſhrouds, ſeveral of our ſtays, moſt of our running-ropes, and the miz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen gears, gave way, ſo that the yard came by the board, and by its fall wounded the firſt Lieutenant, ſo that we feared he never would have recovered. Moſt of our ſails too were ſplit; but, being ſupplied with new ſhrouds by Captain Rogers, and with other ropes by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Courtney, I bent new ſails; but found the ſhip very leaky. The Duke and Dutcheſs too ſuffered much by the tempeſtuous weather, and the Batchelor ſplit her ſails; but being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſtoutly built and rigged, nothing but run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt a rock could hurt her. I had no conception of meeting with ſuch boiſterous wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo near the Line, which proved as bad as that we encountered in ſurrounding Cape Horn, with this difference only, that the one was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſely cold, and the other intolerably hot. And
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0204000302:73"/>
being now croſſed by variable winds, ſometimes lying by, ſometimes ſcudding before the wind, and unable to purſue our direct courſe, our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions began to fail, and on board of us rats roſe to a very high price. The ſhips were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides leaky, and our men began to ſicken with exceſſive labour and hard living. A general council was therefore called to conſider what was beſt to be done in our preſent condition, when it was agreed to make the iſland of Talao, that of Ternate, or, if neither of them could be reached, then to put into ſome part of Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danao.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday, May the 2d, we obſerved a ring about the ſun, and were apprehenſive of more bad weather. In the night we paſſed by Talao without ſeeing it; and Captain Dampier, who had been twice in theſe ſeas before, gave out, that, if we could not reach Ternate, it would be impoſſible for us to get refreſhment on the coaſt of New Guinea, which proved true; yet it was with the greateſt difficulty the men could be prevailed upon to ſubmit to ſhort allowance.</p>
            <p>Monday the 8th, having had tempeſtuous weather, we perceived that a ſtrong current had ſet in to the eaſtward; and to our aſtoniſhment we found the land in ſight to be Cape Noba, a promontory at the eaſt end of Gilolo, bearing S. S. E. diſtant 15 leagues. Perceiving now that we could not get to the iſland of Ternate, nor to that of Mindanao, we reſolved to make the beſt of our way through the ſtraits of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lolo:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0204000302:74"/>
but, notwithſtanding our utmoſt efforts, we continued ſailing among a cluſter of iſlands, moſt of them uninhabited, but all capable of producing ſpices, during the whole month of May, without being able to avail ourſelves of any of their refreſhments, On the 20th of May we came in ſight of the iſland of Ceram, as we then thought, but afterwards found it to be the iſland of Bouro.</p>
            <p>On the 25th, we came in ſight of a low iſland right-a head of us, and about noon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved an opening, which, when we came near, we found to be a paſſage between two little iſlands that almoſt joined. They were very full of green trees, and by the ſea-ſide we beheld many groves of cocoa-nut, plantain, and other fruit-trees, that exhibited a very pleaſant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
            <p>In a capacious bay we likewiſe took notice of a little town, and ſaw ſeveral inhabitants paſſing and re-paſſing along the ſhore. We ſent in our boats for proviſions and pilots, and the Duke and myſelf turned up towards the village, but on ſounding found no ground. The natives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us, there was a bank oppoſite a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain land-mark, on which we might anchor. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of people came off with Indian wheat, cocoa nuts, yams, potatoes, papas, poultry, and ſeveral beautiful birds, which they exchanged for knives, ſciſſars, and other toys, being very civil, and to all appearance honeſt. They are Mahometans, of a middle ſtature, and tawney;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0204000302:75"/>
but the women are fairer than the men, having very long, lank, black hair; their mouths, lips, and noſes remarkably ſmall. The women were decently covered; but the men in general were naked. Theſe iſlands were named Camhava and Wanſhut; but, not anſwering our purpoſe, we agreed to ſteer for Bonton, where we arrived on Monday the 29th of May; and, the ſame day, Captain Dampier, Mr. Connely, and Mr. Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brugh, went with a preſent to the King of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, at the ſame time requeſting him to ſupply us with proviſions, and to ſend us a pilot to carry us to Batavia.</p>
            <p>On the 30th, a paroa came from the King with one of his nobles on board, and a pilot to carry us into harbour. He put on an air of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and aſked, How we dared to come to an anchor there, without leave from the Great King of Bonton? However, he brought each Commander a piece of his country-cloth, a bottle of arrack, ſome rice in baſkets, as a preſent from the King; as alſo a letter from the officers we had ſent on ſhore, giving an account, that they had been well received, and that the town where the King reſides was large, walled, fortified, and defended after the European manner with a number of heavy cannon. Another preſent was returned, and five guns fired by every ſhip at the meſſenger's going off; at which he ſeemed very well pleaſed. Our people trafficked with the natives for poultry, maize, pompions, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas, lemons, Guinea-corn, &amp;c. and gave them in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0204000302:76"/>
exchange knives, ſciſſars, old cloaths, and old nails. The people were civil; but our officers making a longer ſtay than they intended, we began to ſuſpect that the Moors had detained them; for they are very treacherous. However, we heard from them every day; and at length the Dutcheſs's pinnace came down with Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Connely, who told us, they had purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed four laſt of rice, which coſt 600 dollars; and that Mr. Vanbrugh was detained for the payment of the money. The next morning it came, and was equally diſtributed among the four ſhips, ſome great men coming to deliver it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the money.—The town of Bonton is very populous, and by it runs a fine river, but is barred ſo that ſhips of burden cannot approach it. About 50 iſlands are tributary to this king, who gives audience in a chair of ſtate covered with ſcarlet-cloth, and is always attended by a guard of nine men, armed, after the European manner, with muſquets and ſcymitars. He has, beſides, four or five ſlaves, who ſit at his feet, and are ready whenever he commands to do the moſt ſervile offices. The petty princes and great men ſit on his left hand, and the ſtrangers ſtand before him.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday, June the 7th, all the proviſions and neceſſaries which this town could ſupply being brought on board, and the officers who went to wait upon the King, returned, the ſignal was given to weigh, and at four in the afternoon we ſet ſail without a pilot, there being none to be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0204000302:77"/>
had on this iſland. Captain Dampier pretended to be acquainted with the paſſage, and mentions the ſame in his book, but now he remembered nothing of it but the ſtory.</p>
            <p>On Friday the 9th, we came in ſight of Solayo, lying cloſe to the iſland of Celebes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by Malayans, who are tributaries to the Dutch. Between the ſouth-end of Celebes and the iſland of Solayo, are three ſmall low iſlands, and the beſt paſſage is between that which lies next to Solayo, and a little one lying to the northward of it. It is very dangerous going to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Solayo, the Dutch never daring to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it.</p>
            <p>On the 10th we made prize of a country pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roa, and brought the Maſter on board the Dutcheſs. He was a Malayan belonging to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſar, bound thither, came laſt from Bonton, and undertook to pilot us to Batavia for a good reward, provided we would promiſe to keep the matter a ſecret from the Dutch, to both which conditions we very readily agreed; and the man performed what he undertook with great ſkill and fidelity. We paſſed through the ſtraits of Salango, having always from five to ſeven fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom water in our paſſage; then ſteering to the weſtward, our pilot's boat attended us till we were through the laſt ſtrait, and then bore away towards Macaſſar.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday the 20th of June, 1720, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our reckoning, we came to an anchor in Batavia road; but with the Dutch it was Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0204000302:78"/>
June 21; for we had loſt 18 hours in going round to the weſtward, and they had gained ſix in ſailing to the eaſtward, which made a whole day difference between our account and theirs. The reaſon is, that a ſhip ſailing to the weſtward, and ſo following the courſe of the ſun, makes every day ſomething longer than in any fixed ſtation it would be. Thus in every 15 degrees ſhe removes to the weſtward from the meridian from whence ſhe firſt ſet out, ſhe gains an hour; in 90 degrees, ſix hours; and in 360, which compoſe the whole circumference of the globe, ſhe will find a whole day ſhort in her reckoning, according to the account of the place ſhe arrives at. The contrary happens to the ſhip that ſails eaſtward; for, as ſhe advances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the courſe of the ſun, ſhe loſes ſo much of every day, which is thereby ſhortened, and becomes leſs than 24 hours, by conſequence loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an hour in every 15 degrees, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will be a day before the account of the place ſhe arrives at. By this it appears, that the ſhip which ſails round the world weſtward, loſes a whole day, and that which performs the ſame voyage eaſtward gains a day. So we having made the greater part of the circumference, and the Dutch at Batavia the other part the contrary way, our loſs and their gain made up the twenty-four hours; and thus we came to differ a day.</p>
            <p>When we came to an anchor, the Dutcheſs fired thirteen guns to ſalute the Dutch flag; but
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0204000302:79"/>
it being night, the Commandant did not then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; but in the morning ſent his boat to make an apology, and then fired gun for gun with every ſhip. Soon after this friendly ſalute taken on both ſides, the Commanders went on ſhore; and, after waiting upon the Shebander, were introduced to the Governor, who received us with civility, examined our commiſſion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired much concerning the ſucceſs of our voyage; but, not being King's ſhips, would not permit us to heave down in the States dock at Orereſt, but gave us leave to careen at the iſland of Hern, which is at no great diſtance from the other, and allowed us ſome Malayan caulkers to aſſiſt in ſtopping our leaks.</p>
            <p>As the Marquis was in the worſt condition, ſhe was ordered to be laid down firſt; but upon examination ſhe was judged unfit to proceed upon the voyage; and therefore was unladen and put up to ſale. We then hove down the Duke and Dutcheſs, and found their ſheathing much worm-eaten; but otherwiſe not much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged: the Batchelor wanted no repairs but in her rigging. The weather was extremely hot during our ſtay at this city: many of our men and officers fell ſick; and I was among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The maſter of the Duke, the gunner of the Dutcheſs, and ſeveral of the common men, fell a ſacrifice to this unfriendly climate. One Read, a young man belonging to the Dutcheſs, venturing to ſwim, had both his legs ſnapt off by a ſhark, which at the ſecond bite, before we
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0204000302:80"/>
could get him on board, cut him in two in the middle, and put an end to his miſery. During our ſtay, though we had the run of the markets, we found it very difficult to procure ſalt provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to lay in a ſtock to ſerve us till we ſhould arrive at the Cape of Good Hope, and therefore were obliged to purchaſe live cattle, and to kill and pickle them ourſelves. All manner of traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic, except for proviſions, was prohibited with the natives or inhabitants of the city, upon the ſevereſt penalties, to avoid every occaſion of diſpute with the Eaſt-India Companies of both nations: and, having ſettled all our affairs in a very amicable manner, new rigged our ſhips, and diſpoſed of the men belonging to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis among the other ſhips, we began on the 15th of September to prepare for ſailing, when I was appointed ſecond Captain in the Dutcheſs, and Mr. Ballot, maſter; Capt. Pope, firſt Lieutenant of the Duke, and Mr. Selkirk, maſter; Capt. Dampier, ſecond Captain in the Batchelor, and Mr. Knolman, maſter.</p>
            <p>On the 20th we repaired on board; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were ready to ſail, it was the 14th of October; when, about ſix in the morning, we weighed anchor; but in the afternoon the ſea-breeze took us, and we were forced to return.</p>
            <p>On the 19th we made ſail with a freſh breeze, and at two in the afternoon came to an anchor off Java-head, when two Engliſh gentlemen came off to us, to demand the releaſe of a man who had concealed himſelf, unknown to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0204000302:81"/>
officers, on board the Batchelor, and who was given up without oppoſition. In the mean time, while the gentlemen were in converſation with the officers, a party from the ſhip went off with their boat to buy fowls, for which they gave in exchange knives, toys, and other trifles, which the natives value more than money.</p>
            <p>On the 23d the gentlemen took their leave; and the party who went off to truck for fowls having reported that there were buffaloes in abundance to be had for ſhooting, another party were ſent off to bring ſome on board; but they returned without ſucceſs. They came in ſight of whole herds, but ſo exceeding wild, that the moment they ſaw the appearance of a man, they all took the alarm, and fled to the woods with ſo much ſwiftneſs, that it was impoſſible to come within muſket-ſhot of them. One of the party, who had ventured to follow them into the woods, was ſurprized by a tyger, who was within leſs than a hundred yards of him before he thought proper to make his retreat; and was purſued by the creature ſo cloſe, that, had he not reached the water, he muſt have been devoured. His companions fired more than twenty ſhot at the tyger before he went off, which he did at laſt, though ſorely wounded.</p>
            <p>We ſtaid here till the 26th, when we made ſail, and about noon Java-head bore E. by N. diſtant about ſeven leagues. From hence to the Cape of Good Hope we met with nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; and, on the 30th of December, came
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0204000302:82"/>
to an anchor in Table-bay, in ſeven fathom wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We ſaluted the fort with nine guns; and they returned ſeven. As ſoon as the ſhips were moored, the Captains and principal officers went aſhore to pay their compliments to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, by whom they were honourably received. The place and people have been ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed already, that we ſhall not diſguſt the reader with uſeleſs repetitions.</p>
            <p>During our ſtay here, we employed the time in victualling, watering, and refitting our ſhips, for the remaining part of our voyage home. The Duke, commanded by Captain Rogers, had been leaky ever ſince her departure from Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fornia; and, notwithſtanding all that could be done both at Batavia and this place, it could not be ſtopped; but what was remarkable, in a few days after we left the Cape, it ſtopt of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Here we had an opportunity of writing to our owners, by means of an Eaſt-India ſhip juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſail when we arrived. In the letter we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them with our having made prize of a ſmall Manilla ſhip, and of our having her in our poſſeſſion; and alſo, that we intended to take the advantage of returning home in company with the Dutch Eaſt-India fleet, who were hourly expected, which would occaſion us to tarry till the latter end of March, when it was imagined they would be ready to ſail.</p>
            <p>On February the 22d, the Dutch fleet arrived, being in all 12 ſail. We ſaluted the Admiral at
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0204000302:83"/>
his coming with ſeven guns, as did likewiſe the fort. There were at this time in the harbour 17 Dutch ſhips, and ſix Engliſh. The town was crowded, and many of our men were ill. Mr. Vanbrugh, the owners chief agent, died, as did Mr. Appleby, mate of the Duke, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others. We began to be impatient; and found it neceſſary to begin to furniſh ourſelves with proviſions as early as poſſible, as every thing began to increaſe in price as the town began to fill. The Batavia fleet was ſoon followed by four ſhips from Ceylon. Six came from that iſland; but near Madagaſcar met with ſuch a violent ſtorm, that ſome were forced to cut away their main-maſts, and throw over ſome of their lee-guns, having much water at the ſame time in their holds. The four came into the Cape much damaged, and believed the other two had foundered at ſea. Several Engliſh Indiamen ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived alſo in the road; as alſo a Portugueſe ſhip from Rio de Janeiro on the coaſt of Braſil, bound for Mezambique, to take in ſlaves.</p>
            <p>At length, on April the 6th, all the homeward bound ſhips being ready to ſail, we weighed in the morning, and ſailed with a ſmall breeze of wind at E.S.E. and by noon came to an anchor at Penguin iſland, the eaſt end of the iſland bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouth-weſterly. At three we ſailed again, being in all 25 ſail of Engliſh and Dutch, all good ſhips, under the command of Admiral Peter de Vos. At ſix the Cape of Good Hope bore S. by W. half W. diſtant about ſeven
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0204000302:84"/>
leagues; and thus, having taken our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we proceeded on our voyage April the 23d, which being Sr. George's-day, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary of her Majeſty of Great Britain, the Duke and Dutcheſs ſaluted each other with drums, trumpets, and other formalities, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the day; and in the evening the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Captains gave an entertainment, of which all the officers on board partook.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 3, 1711, we made the iſland of St. Helena, in lat. 16 deg. S. It lies 1000 miles at leaſt from any land, and is not more than 10 leagues in length, and about eight in breadth, ſurrounded with rocks, and elevated above the ſea by towering mountains, that look at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance like lofty buildings riſing to the clouds. Theſe mountains are covered with wholeſome herbs and plants; and the vallies are ſo fruitful, that they yield an increaſe of whatever is ſown in them an hundred-fold. The Portugueſe firſt diſcovered this little ſpot accidentally, as they were ranging along the coaſt of Africa, in order to find their way to the Eaſt-Indies. It was then uninhabited; and, according to their cuſtom, they ſet ſome live goats and ſwine on ſhore, which multiplied to that degree, that ever ſince there have been enough to ſupply the ſhips that touch at that iſland with ſeaſonable refreſhment. The Dutch firſt inhabited, and afterwards aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned it, and removed their ſettlement to the Cape of Hood Hope. The Engliſh then took poſſeſſion of it; when the Dutch, who did not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0204000302:85"/>
think it worth keeping before, returned, fell upon the Engliſh, and drove them out. The Dutch in their turn were expelled by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, who have now been long in poſſeſſion, have erected a very ſtrong fort for their ſecurity, and built a town near the little bay, where ſhips generally anchor in their way to and from the Eaſt Indies. It is of infinite uſe in relieving the ſailors from that dreadful diſtemper the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurvy; for, as it naturally produces lemons, oranges, and other fruits, and as greens and roots are planted in abundance, thoſe who are languiſhing under the laſt ſtage of the ſcurvy are frequently recovered by the uſe of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments without any other phyſic. It would be delightful living in this iſland, were it larger, or more frequented; but the confinement in ſo ſmall a place in the middle of a vaſt ocean ſo remote from all communication with the reſt of the world, renders the reſidence there ſo lonely, that it has rather the appearance of living in exile than in a land of freedom. And indeed, what makes it ſtill more uncomfortable, our own ſhips find ſo much better entertainment at the Cape than can be expected in this little ſpot, that many of them ſtore themſelves there ſo plentifully, and recover their ſick men ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, as not to be under the neceſſity of touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at St. Helena, whereby not only the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the inhabitants is rendered more dull, but their means of ſubſiſtence is very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained; for as they have nothing to depend
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0204000302:86"/>
upon but their traffic with the ſhips that call to refreſh, every one that paſſes by without touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a diminution of their profits: ſo that in fact the people have little or no encouragement to continue there, and many of them make heavy complaints. Indeed, the ſurrounding ſea, that abounding in fiſh is a conſiderable help, and the fertility of the ſoil, which is ſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the pains of the cultivator, exempt them from famine; but for cloaths and all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, their dependance is upon ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>On the firſt of May we took our departure from this iſland, and on the 7th made the iſland of Aſcenſion, which is ſtill uninhabited. As the ſprings, which were diſcovered by Dampier, lie remote from the ſhore, very few ſhips attempt to water, or indeed ſtop at Aſcenſion; ſome indeed, who are in want of freſh proviſions, fiſh here for turtle, of which there are great plenty all round the coaſts.</p>
            <p>Nothing remarkable happened in the courſe of our voyage till May the 27th, when two of our Dutch ſailors died, and were decently buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the cuſtom of the ſea.</p>
            <p>About this time all the flag-ſhips ſtruck their flags, the Admiral hoiſted a broad pendant, and all the other ſhips did the ſame. This was done with a view to deceive the enemy, that in caſe any cruiſers ſhould come in ſight, they might take us for a ſquadron of Dutch men of-war.</p>
            <p>On the 12th, a mutiny happened among our men; and two Dutchmen who were the ring-leaders
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0204000302:87"/>
were whipped and put in irons. For ſome days we had but little wind, being in the calm latitude, which we reckon from 22 deg. to 28 deg. N.</p>
            <p>June the 13th, the Dutch Admiral made the ſignal tor each ſhip to keep the Line, and we blacked our ſhip to make her look the more like a Dutchman.</p>
            <p>On the 15th, in the morning, the Admiral made the ſignal for all the Engliſh Commanders, and ſome of the Dutch ſkippers, to come on board him, where we were ſumptuouſly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Dinner, and the frank humour of the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men made the company jolly before we parted.</p>
            <p>June 23, a Dutch ſhip being in diſtreſs fired ſeveral guns; upon which the whole fleet ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened ſail. Her damage being ſoon repaired, the ſignal was given to continue our courſe, and we took the Batchelor in tow, being a heavy ſailor, and forced to croud the canvaſs to keep company; but, it blowing hard the next day, we were forced to caſt her off.</p>
            <p>On the 26th, the Batchelor's pinnace had her back broke, by the ſhip's running over her; but the men that were in her were all miraculouſly ſaved, by means of the hawſer which they were carrying from our ſhip to take her in tow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the evening the King William Indiaman took her in tow, and next morning caſt her off.</p>
            <p>On the 28th, being got into the latitude o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

This was done to keep the fleet together, and it anſwered the purpoſe very well; for when the fog diſperſed, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came clear, there was not one ſhip miſſing. The Dutch convoy, however, took care after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be well paid for his waſte of powder.</p>
            <p>Nothing remarkable happened till the 12th of July, when the Donnegall Indiaman loſt her fore-top maſt, and made the ſignal for the fleet to ſhorten ſail. Being now in near 60 deg. N. la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, we had no might, but cold drizzling wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet nothing to compare to the cold in the ſame latitude in going round Cape Horn ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; for there the cold was ſo intenſe that many of our men ſickened; and yet we were here and at Cape Horn much about the ſame time of the year, allowing for the difference of the two climates.</p>
            <p>On the 14th, we came in ſight of Bera, and ſpoke with a Daniſh ſhip bound to Dublin, who told us the war ſtill continued, and that he had ſpoke a day or two before with a Dutch ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of 10 men of war, and three victuallers, lying off Shetland to wait for us; ſo that by keeping between that and Fair Iſland, we could not poſſibly miſs ſeeing them. Next day we came in ſight of them, when all the fleet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted the Commodore, and he made the ſignal for all the Commanders to come aboard of him

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Captains Courtney and Dover went accordingly, and were courteouſly received, and given to underſtand, that they might be ſupplied with whatever proviſions they ſtood in need of, on paying for the ſame, he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought victuallers from Holland for that purpoſe. We lay off Shetland ſome days, and caught ling and cod in abundance, during which time the Shetlanders came off to us, and brought fowls and ſheep, which we purchaſed at much cheaper rates than of our Dutch victuallers.</p>
            <p>We were now very ſickly, having been more than three months in our paſſage from the Cape to this place; and we were beſides very peeviſh and quarrelſome among ourſelves; now that we came near home, jealouſies aroſe about embezzle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The agents had been to the Duke to demand the gold, plate, pearl, and jewels, on board; and they were returned not very well ſatisfied with their reception. But, while theſe diſputes were at their height, orders were given to ſet ſail. In the mean time letters were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to London and Amſterdam, acquainting the owners with our progreſs, and preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deſiring their inſtructions to regulate our future proceedings. Before we left Shetland we took four hogſheads of beer on board from the Dutch Commodore, which ſerved us till we arrived on the 23d in ſight of Holland, in the evening of which day we came to an anchor in the Texel road.</p>
            <p>On the 27th, we received a general letter from
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0204000302:90"/>
our owners, dated, Briſtol, june 6th, 1711, in which they acquainted us, that the Eaſt-India Company were incenſed againſt us, and had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a ſecret committee to inſpect their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as to privileges; and that they were reſolved to take all advantages, in caſe of the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement on what they pretended to be their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive right of trading to the Eaſt-Indies. This letter likewiſe recommended the greateſt caution on our part with regard to the Dutch Eaſt-India Company; or from that Company as well as from our own, they had reaſon to fear all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible obſtruction. It was therefore moſt ſtrictly enjoined, that neither officer nor ſailor ſhould, on any pretence whatever, be ſuffered to take any goods on ſhore; nor were we to allow any ſtranger to come on board to purchaſe the leaſt trifle; for that, if any ſuch thing ſhould be proved, the whole cargo would be forfeited.</p>
            <p>It was a great relief to us, when, on the 5th of Auguſt, Mr. Hollidge, one of our principal owners came on board us; for, though we kept the ſtricteſt watch, it was hardly poſſible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſailors from running things aſhore in the night. On this gentleman's arrival, it was judged neceſſary to draw up a ſhort account of our voyage from the journals of the reſpective Commanders, and an affidavit was made to the truth of it. In this memorial we ſet forth, that we went out as private men-of-war, and not as trading ſhips; and that no ſort of merchandize was ſhipped on board our ſhips at any of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0204000302:91"/>
iſlands or ports we touched at in the Eaſt Indies, nor any traffic carried on there, other than for neceſſaries and proviſions for the ſhips and ſhips company. To this all the officers and moſt of the ſeamen voluntarily ſwore and ſet their hands. We continued in Holland, without any remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able event, till the 30th of September, 1711, when we ſailed from the Texel, under convoy of her Majeſty's ſhips, Eſſex, Canterbury, Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and Dullidge, and anchored in the Downs on the 2d of October. On the 13th, the Duke and Dutcheſs came up to Eriff, where the Batchelor had been moored ſome time before: and here all the ſhips continued till they were unloaded. The produce of the cargo, and the treaſure brought home in theſe ſhips, were ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to amount to between 3 and 400,000 l. for, after all charges of convoy, agency, law-ſuits, embezzlements, of which great complaint was made, and of every kind of thievery practiſed in ſuch caſes, the nett profits, that were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fairly divided, amounted to 170,000 l.</p>
            <p>Among the diſaſters that befel the adventurers in this voyage, that of loſing Mr. Hatley, with his little crew, near the iſlands of Gallapagoes, was moſt to be deplored; yet, though his death was ſuppoſed to be certain, having little or no proviſions on board, and ſtill leſs water, after the concluſion of the war, he returned home, to the aſtoniſhment of all who knew him. It then appeared, that, when he parted company with the Duke, having no reſource, he made directly

Theſe wretches uſed their helpleſs priſoners barbarouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, tied their hands behind them, and laſhed them to poſts, where they half-fleed them with whips; and moſt certainly would have tortured them to death, had it not been for the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their prieſt, to whom theſe half-heathen converts pay great reſpect. Being, by the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of this good Padre, reſcued out of the hands of thoſe barbarians, and conveyed to a Spaniſh ſettlement, Mr. Hatley was received with kindneſs, and uſed with much civility; and, when peace was declared, was ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and aſſiſted to return to his country, where he afterwards engaged in a ſecond expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the ſame ſeas, and again fell into the hands of the ſame enemy.</p>
            <p>We have not yet been able to learn the future proceedings of the officers who conducted this enterprize. It is more than probable, that, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enriched themſelves by the voyage, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired and lived private. We find, indeed, a Mr. Cooke engaged in a ſucceeding voyage,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0204000302:94"/>
but it does not appear that it was the Captain Cooke of whoſe voyage we have juſt given an account. Mr. Hatley, indeed, who fell into the hands of the Spaniards, was employed as ſecond Captain under Shelvock, and of him we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak largely hereafter.</p>

            <head>THE VOYAGE OF CAPTAIN CLIPPERTON ROUND THE WORLD.</head>
            <p>CAPTAIN John Clipperton (or, as ſome write, Clippington) was born at Yarmouth, in the county of Norfolk; and his friends being moſt of them ſea-faring people, he was from his infancy bred up a mariner. His diſpoſition naturally inclining him to ramble, he embraced every opportunity to embark in new voyages, and there was hardly a corner of the earth which he had not viſited before he was thirty years of age. When he was made choice of to take the command of the expedition of which we are now to give an account, he was eſteemed, and that perhaps juſtly, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſeaman of his time. He had been frequently in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies; had been in the Northern and Mediterranean Seas, and had once ſurrounded the whole globe. He was that Clippington, who, in 1704, with a bark, of only 10 tons, two maſts, two ſquare-ſails, two pattararoes, and 21 men, left Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0204000302:96"/>
Dampier on the coaſt of Mexico; and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſulting Rio Leon, where he took two Spaniſh ſhips at anchor, one of which was ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed for 4000 pieces of eight, and after viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gulph of Salinas, where he cleaned and refitted his little bark, undertook to ſail in her from that coaſt round half the globe; a great part of which he performed in a track never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore attempted, purſuing his courſe in the 18th degree of north latitude, which former naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors had purſued after each other in the 13th; and, in that direction, he reached the Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines in 54 days, without ſeeing land, or meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with any croſs accident to interrupt his paſſage. While he was embarraſſed among thoſe iſlands, there came off a canoe with a friar on board, to enquire concerning ſo uncommon a veſſel, the like of which was never ſeen before in thoſe ſeas. He detained the friar till his crew were furniſhed with freſh proviſions, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed him.</p>
            <p>From the Philippines we ſteered to Pulo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, where he expected to have met with an Engliſh ſettlement; but, to his great mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he there learnt, that, ſome time before his arrival, the Engliſh had been all murdered by their Indian guards. Upon this melancholy news, he bore away for Macao, a port in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Portugueſe, near the mouth of the river Canton, in China, already frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and lately made famous by the arrival of ſome Ruſſian adventurers from Kampſchatka,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0204000302:97"/>
who, by that navigation, have confirmed the reality of a north-eaſt paſſage to the coaſts of China. At this Port he arrived, where Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock affirms that near half his crew were hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for pirates, that the reſt eſcaped, ſome to one place, and ſome to another; that Clipperton himſelf being deprived of his little boat, found means to get on board an Engliſh Eaſt India<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at Canton, and arrived in England in 1706.</p>
            <p>Clipperton was a blunt, rough, free-ſpoken ſailor, had not much the air of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and therefore never affected it; was free and eaſy among his ſeamen; and, though he was paſſionate, he was ſoon appeaſed, and, if in the wrong, ever ready to acknowledge his error, and to repair any injury his haſty temper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him to commit. He had a ſtrict regard to what he thought his duty, and was not to be diverted from the principles of moderation, which ever inclined him to acts of mercy and humanity towards thoſe over whom the chance of war gave him the ſuperiority. Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned almoſt deſtitute from his firſt voyage round the world, he ſettled in the north of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to which retreat he was traced, after more than twelve years retirement, and perſuaded to undertake this ſecond voyage, as a means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair his broken fortune.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſs that had attended the voyage of the Duke and Dutcheſs to the South Seas under the command of Captain Rogers, had revived the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0204000302:98"/>
ſpirit of privateering, which, by former miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, had been reduced to a very low ebb. Dampier, as has already been noticed, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, with all his ſkill and all his experience, to perſuade the London merchants to engage in a ſecond expedition into thoſe ſeas, after having failed in the firſt, and was obliged to apply to Briſtol to raiſe a new company of adventurers to ſecond his views; but ſuch is the nature of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that emulous, not to ſay envious, of the ſucceſs of others, they are ever ready to croud the road that has led to fortune, without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how unfit they are to undertake the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The owners of the Duke and Dutcheſs had been particularly careful to make choice of gentlemen, not only of ability, to conduct the voyage which proved ſo ſucceſsful, but who alſo had confidence in, and friendſhip for, each other; and yet, with all this care and caution, it was with the greateſt difficulty in the world that they were perſuaded to keep together, and to act in concert. On the contrary, the Commanders in the preſent expedition, were gentlemen of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite tempers, oppoſite views, and already, before they ſet out, engaged in oppoſite parties; it was therefore very unlikely that two ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders ſhould unite in one common intereſt, or that the one ſhould ſhare the danger where the other was to reap the glory. The event will ſhew, that the miſcarriage of this enterprize was not more owing to the miſtakes in the voyage, than in the wrong ſetting out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0204000302:99"/>The impatience of the undertakers was ſo great, and their confidence of making themſelves rich by the plunder of the Spaniards ſo certain, that, unwilling to truſt to an eventual rupture between Great Britain and Spain, they took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, from the war that then ſubſiſted between the Emperor and Spain, to apply to the Imperial Court for a commiſſion to carry their plan of hoſtilities into execution. With this view, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equipped two ſtout ſhips, the <hi>Succeſs</hi> and the <hi>Speedwell,</hi> it was thought neceſſary to find out ſome gentleman who had ſerved on board the royal navy, that might take upon him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the expedition, and be able to act with propriety in a joint commiſſion, wherein Flemiſh ſoldiers and Engliſh ſailors were to be united in the ſame deſign.</p>
            <p>For this difficult taſk no man was thought more fit than Captain George Shelvock, who had been bred from his childhood in the royal navy, had been thirty years in the ſervice, and arrived at the rank of Firſt Lieutenant of one of his Majeſty's ſhips of war, which he had borne with great reputation; was in his perſon and behaviour a fine gentleman, and was confeſſedly a very expert and able ſeaman. He was, beſides, of quick parts, ready ſpeech, and very winning addreſs, but withal rather too ſenſible of his own accompliſhments. This gentleman the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers thought themſelves happy in having found; and they accordingly not only inveſted him with the command, but entruſted to him the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0204000302:100"/>
grand buſineſs of the commiſſion, and for that purpoſe he received inſtructions to repair to Oſtend with the Speedwell, and there, as ſoon as the commiſſion was obtained, to take on board the complement of Flemings that were to give countenance to the undertaking; and to join the Succeſs in the Downs, which there lay ready un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of Capt. Mitchel. On this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the names of the ſhips were changed; the <hi>Succeſs</hi> was called the <hi>Prince Eugene,</hi> and the <hi>Speed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> the <hi>Starenberg,</hi> in compliment to the Prince and the Imperial Prime Miniſter. Capt. Shelvock was, beſides, inſtructed to lay in ſuch a ſtock of wines and ſpirituous liquors, as he ſhould judge ſufficient for the uſe of both ſhips in a voyage where ſuch refreſhments would be abſolutely neceſſary, and without which the climate of Cape Horn could hardly be endured.</p>
            <p>In this buſineſs, however, the Captain gave ſome diſguſt. He was either too extravagant, too oſtentatious, or too remiſs; and the voyage which the owners had ſo much at heart, was thought already to have ſuffered by unneceſſary delay. But, what was ſtill worſe, the Flemiſh ſoldiers, 90 in number, commanded by their own officers, had hardly arrived in the Downs before they became ſo inſolent, that it was preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that the ſcheme of their acting in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert with Engliſh ſailors was utterly impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable: ſo that after all this delay and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, the commiſſion was returned, the Flemiſh ſoldiers diſcharged, and a new plan formed,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0204000302:101"/>
which gave the firſt occaſion to thoſe diſſentions that in the end proved the ruin of the voyage.</p>
            <p>Captain Shelvock's management had much leſſened his credit, and his friends were unable to ſupport his intereſt. The reaſon for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement no longer exiſted; and it was found, that the diſcipline to which he had been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed on board the royal navy, was not the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline to be practiſed on board privateers. It was neceſſary, therefore, as the circumſtances of things were changed, war with Spain declared, and no extraordinary accompliſhment required, to look out for an officer to take the command, who had experience in the buſineſs in which he was to be employed; who knew the weſtern coaſts of America, and was acquainted with the genius of the people with whom he was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, as well as the tempers of thoſe with whom he was to attack.</p>
            <p>On this new regulation, the character of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clipperton was called to mind. He was known to ſome of the owners, and ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by other merchants, as of all men then living the fitteſt to be entruſted with the conduct of ſuch an expedition. The owners, who had already expended more than 15,000 l. began to conſider their own intereſt without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to perſons; and, therefore, they ſought out and inveſted Captain Clipperton with the chief command, continuing Captain Shelvock Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Speedwell, and appointing Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mitchell ſecond to Captain Clipperton, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0204000302:102"/>
Captain Hatley ſecond Captain to Shelvock. The ſhips were reſtored to their former names, an Engliſh commiſſion procured for the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and every thing prepared while the ſhips lay in the Downs for their immediate departure.</p>
            <p>The inſtructions given to the reſpective Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders were, in ſubſtance, the ſame with thoſe given to the Commanders of the Duke and Dutcheſs, ſtrongly recommending unanimity. But this precaution proved wholly uſeleſs. The expedition wore an unfortunate aſpect from the beginning. The ſhips were obliged to lie three months at Plymouth, waiting for a wind. Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were in the mean time formed, in which the crews as well as the Commanders were involved. Captain Shelvock highly reſented the affront that had been offered in depriving him of the chief command; and Captain Clipperton, being a boiſterous man, having himſelf ſtrong paſſions, and not having art to conceal them, knowing Captain Shelvock's prejudices, nothing but diſſention and diſcord prevailed. Every poſt brought the owners freſh complaints; and every poſt carried freſh reproofs to the Commanders. In this humour the parties continued while the ſhips lay at Plymouth. At length,</p>
            <p>On the 13th of February, 1719, the Succeſs, of 36 guns, and 180 men, commanded by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clipperton, and the Speedwell, of 24 guns, and 106 men, of which Captain Shelvock was Commander, ſailed with a fair wind; but, by an
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0204000302:103"/>
unaccountable over-ſight, the Speedwell had on board the whole ſtock of wine and brandy, and the Succeſs the greateſt ſhare of other ſtores.</p>
            <p>For ſeveral days they had freſh gales, ſqually, with rain, and the Succeſs was often obliged to ſhorten ſail for the Speedwell. Captain Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock tells us, that he complained to Captain Clipperton of the crankneſs of his ſhip, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to ſend for his wine and brandy, that he might ſtrike down ſome of his guns into the hold, which would enable him to ſail much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he did: but this, it ſeems, was neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; a proof that Clipperton had no intention to deſert the Speedwell, though it was a ſlight, which Shelvock could not but reſent. On the 19th, a violent ſtorm aroſe, which obliged both ſhips to take in their top-ſails. The gale in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, the Succeſs made a ſignal for the Speed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to bring to; which Captain Shelvock readily obeyed; and, by eleven at night, both ſhips were under bare poles. On the 20th, in the afternoon, the ſtorm abated, and Captain Clipperton made ſail, ſteering S. by E. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Captain Shelvock, according to his journal, ſtood north weſt; ſo that from this day they never ſaw each other, till they met in the South Seas by mere accident. Here then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly begins the hiſtory of Captain Clipperton's voyage round the world. He was now at ſea without liquors, and without his conſort. The firſt place of rendezvous appointed by them, was the Canary Iſlands; and, therefore, he ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0204000302:104"/>
thither, and arrived at Gomera on the 5th of March. Having taken in ſome wine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, for which he had great occaſion, he continued cruiſing at the Canaries ten days for his conſort; but, miſſing her here, he continued his voyage to the next place of rendezvous, at the Cape de Verd or Green iſlands.</p>
            <p>The former iſlands, called by the ancients the Fortunate Iſlands, from their fertility and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate air, were diſcovered by the Spaniards in 1402, who named them the Canaries, or the Iſlands of Dogs, becauſe no other creatures were found on them. They are eight in number. The Great Canary is the largeſt, is far diſtant from the others, and contains 9000 inhabitants. It is the ſeat of the Biſhop, the Inquiſition, and of the Council Royal. There is a mountain on the Teneriff, called the Pike of Teneriff, which, according to the common opinion, is the higheſt in the world. It may be diſtinctly ſeen at ſixty leagues diſtance. It is three days journey to the top of it, which, except in the months of July and Auguſt, is always covered with ſnow. Fero is one of the largeſt, but ſo dry, that there is not one drop of freſh water to be found in it, except in a few places by the ſea-ſide: but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has furniſhed a ſupply to remedy that inconvenience; for there grows all over this iſland a ſort of tree, which is pretty large, and full of leaves, that are always green, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a little cloud that wets the leaves by its dew, ſo that a fine clear water diſtills from
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0204000302:105"/>
them into little pails, which the inhabitants ſet to catch it. This water falls in ſuch quantities, that it not only abundantly ſupplies the neceſſity of the people, but it is ſufficient alſo to water the cattle. The Canaries in general are very fertile, and abound with wine that is tranſported into all parts of the world. On the right-hand of thoſe iſlands, about 100 leagues off, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners very often perceived an iſland named St. Baranora, inhabited, they ſay, by Chriſtians; but no man can tell of what denomination they are, nor what language they ſpeak. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards have often attempted to enter it, but could never find the way; which has raiſed an opinion in the people, that it is an inchanted iſland.</p>
            <p>On the 21ſt they ſaw St. Vincent's, and the next morning anchored in the bay. Here they ſpent ten days cruiſing in hopes of meeting with their conſort, but in vain; which ſo diſheartened the crew, that Capt. Clipperton found it diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to perſuade them to continue the voyage for the Straits of Magellan, without wine or brandy to keep up their ſpirits in that uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable navigation. Some are of opinion, that theſe iſlands were called Green Iſlands from the Green Cape of Africa, over-againſt which they lie; others, becauſe the ſea that ſurrounds them is ſo covered with a green herb, that you can hardly ſee the water; nor can ſhips ſail through it, but with a ſtiff gale of wind. It produces berries, much like white gooſeberries;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0204000302:106"/>
but without taſte. Nobody can tell how it grows; for there is no ground where it ſtoats upon the water, and it cannot come from the bottom, the ſea being in many places unfathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>On the 1ſt of April they left St. Vincent's, and on the 29th of May they had an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and found themſelves in lat. 52 deg. 15 min. S. being then off Cape Virgin Mary, the north point of the entrance of the Straits of Magellan. The next day they entered the Straits, and ſent their pinnace on ſhore on the main, to a freſh-water river, which was at this time frozen up. They ſaw large flocks of geeſe and ducks, but very ſhy. The ſurgeon's mate, by ſome accident, was left on ſhore; and next morning, when brought aboard, was near dead with cold. They anchored at Queen Elizabeth's Iſland, and found great plenty of ſmallage, which was of infinite ſervice to thoſe ſick of the ſcurvy. They eat it raw, boiled it in their ſoups, and kept the juice of it in bottles. They met with plenty of wild-fowl and ſhell-fiſh, filled their caſks with water, and continued their courſe. On the 22d they anchored in a fine bay, which, from its depth, they called No-bottom Bay. The trees were high, loaded with ſnow, and exhibited a moſt aſtoniſhing proſpect. On the 29th came a canoe, with four Indians. They were of a middle ſtature, dark com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection, their faces broad and round, low fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, black hair very lank and ſhort, with no
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0204000302:107"/>
cloathing, except a piece of ſkin to cover their middles. What ſeemed moſt remarkable, was a circle round their wriſts, of a bright azure. It ſeems theſe ſavages are extremely jealous of their women; for, notwithſtanding all that could be ſaid to them, they would not permit a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was of their party, to come on board. Bougainville, and the Engliſh voyagers who lately paſſed the Straits, make the ſame obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Capt. Clipperton ordered them bread and cheeſe, and a dram of brandy, though it was very ſcarce. The former they eat very heartily, or rather greedily; but the latter they could not be prevailed upon to taſte. They had bows and arrows, and ſome fiſhing-tackle along with them. After about two hours ſtay, they rowed aſhore, making ſigns that they would come again. The next day the pinnace was ſent aſhore, and returned in the evening with the Indian canoe laden with muſcles, which the Indians had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for bread, knives, and other trifles. In the beginning of the month of July they found the weather moderate. Theſe natives were a harmleſs people: one of the crew, being left on ſhore, lived with them two nights and a day, and was very kindly treated by them; which ſhews, that, if they are well uſed, they are not treacherous. All this time their ſhip's company were very ſickly, and ſcarce a day paſſed but ſome one or other died. On July 8 they buried their maſter-gunner. They cauſed a ſtrong plank to be driven at the head of his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0204000302:108"/>
grave, on which was the following inſcription: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Mr. William Pridham, gunner of the Succeſs, deceaſed July 7, 1719, in this Strait, and lies buried here."</q> On the 20th Capt. Mitchell and Lieut. Davidſon went in the pinnace to Terra del Fuego, in order to make diſcovery of the paſſage that a French Tartan is ſaid to have went through into the South Sea, May 1713, and to ſee if there was any anchoring beyond Cape Quad. On the 29th they returned, having found the paſſage, but ſo narrow, that it was judged hazardous to go that way. They found likewiſe ſeveral good bays to the north-weſt of Cape Quad to anchor in. The Indians brought them a ſeal, which they broiled and roaſted, and ſaid it eat like veniſon.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 1, they reſolved to proſecute their voyage thro' the Straits, which, with much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and difficulty, they accompliſhed. Aug. 18, they arrived in the South Seas, but ſo weak, that it was impoſſible to undertake any thing immediately; they therefore ſteered directly for the iſland of Juan Fernandez, the third and laſt place of rendezvous, where they arrived Sept. 7, and ſearched diligently in hopes of finding ſome token of the Speedwell, but to to manner of purpoſe. According to his inſtructions, Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perton continued to cruiſe a full month, and, before he took his departure, ordered an inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be cut on a remarkable tree fronting the landing-place; ſo that it was impoſſible for any ſhip's crew to come aſhore, and not ſee
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0204000302:109"/>
it. The inſcription thus: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"CAPTAIN JOHN W. MAGEE, 1719."</q> This William Magee was ſurgeon on board the Succeſs, was well-known to Capt. Shelvock, and all the ſhip's company, and therefore his name was made choice of rather than the Captain's, for a blind in caſe the inſcription ſhould be read by the Spaniards. Here the ſick were ſet aſhore, and every means uſed for their recovery; but the very thoughts of being without any cordial to comfort them, dejected them exceſſively. The weather was changeable; abundance of rain fell; and they had alſo ſome hard gales of wind. They took goats in plenty, which not only ſerved them for the preſent, but likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their ſea ſtore, having ſalted a great number with ſalt they found on the iſland ready-made. They likewiſe wooded and watered, and cleaned their ſhip, ready for action in the South-Seas, where it was now viſible they were to cruiſe alone; for Clipperton was of opinion the Speedwell was loſt; or at leaſt he gave out ſo, to pacify his company, who were continually curſing Capt. Shelvock for running away with their liquors. One thing remarkable was, the beauty and fertility of this iſland, added to the ſtories they had heard of others, tempted four of Clipperton's men, with a view of remaining there, to betake themſelves to the mountains, where two of them were made priſoners by the goat-hunters, who were forced to fire at them ſeveral times before they would ſurrender.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0204000302:110"/>October 7, they prepared to ſail; and, in the mean time, Captain Mitchell went on ſhore, to ſet up a croſs already cut for that purpoſe, at the foot of which he buried a bottle, in which was contained a letter for Captain Shelvock, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another place of rendezvous, and ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignal to know each other by at ſea. At eight in the morning they weighed from the iſland of Juan Fernandez, and left their two men in poſſeſſion of it, of whom more hereafter.</p>
            <p>After leaving this iſland, Captain Clipperton ſailed northward, till he was in the parallel of Lima, where he intended to act, though he was now in a very indifferent condition, having loſt thirty men ſince his paſſing the Equator; and the remaining crew expreſſing ſome uneaſineſs in relation to plunder, he cauſed a paper to be fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the main-maſt, which was aſſented to by the whole ſhip's company.</p>
            <p>On October 25, they gave chace to a ſmall veſſel, and took her. Being their firſt prize, ſhe was an ill omen of their future ſucceſs. She was a ſhow of 40 tons, laden with ſand and rubbiſh for manure, had ſeven Indians and two negroes on board; and all the captors could find worth taking, was two jars of eggs, as much treacle, and a couple of pieces of eight in ready money. The next day, they met with a ſhip called the St. Vincent, of 150 tons, laden with wood from Guiaquil, with two friars, ſixteen Indians, and four negroes aboard. On the 30th, they took a large ſhip called the Trinity, of 400 tons, taken

by Captain Rogers when he plundered Guiaquil ten years before. She had a great many paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers on board, and a cargo of conſiderable value.</p>
            <p>On Nov. 2, they took another prize, of 70 tons, with the Counteſs of Laguna and ſeveral other paſſengers on board, a great deal of money, and upwards of 400 jars of wine and brandy, articles very much wanted. Captain Clipperton deſired the Counteſs to make her choice, either to ſtay on board the prize, or accept of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations they were able to afford her on board the Succeſs. She choſe the former; and the Captain ſent an officer with ſtrict orders to ſuffer nobody to enter her cabbin but her own domeſtics: he likewiſe appropriated a part of the wine and brandy found on board the prizes for the uſe of his ſeamen, to whom, no doubt, it was a welcome refreſhment.</p>
            <p>He had already detached ſeveral officers, and above a third part of his company, to take care of his prizes; and yet was as eager to take more, as if, inſtead of a privateer weakly manned, he had commanded a ſquadron of ſhips of war. On the 12th he diſcovered, at ſome diſtance, a Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-built pink, of 200 tons, laden with wood, named the Roſario, the Maſter of which being a very cunning fellow, ſoon ſaw the error that Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perton had committed, and reſolved to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it. He gueſſed, by the number of prizes, that many men could not be ſent on board his ſhip; and, having about a dozen paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, he directed them, under the command
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0204000302:112"/>
of a French boatſwain, to hide themſelves in the hold, with orders, on his making a certain ſignal, to ſeize as many of the Engliſh as came down; aſſuring them, that he, with the ſhip's company, would be able to manage the reſt. As ſoon as the ſhip ſtruck, Captain Clipperton ſent Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Serjeantſon, with eight men, to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of her; who, as ſoon as he came on board, ordered all that appeared into the great cabin, and placed a centinel at the door of it. Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing ſecure, and not in the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of danger, he with ſome of his men went into the hold to ſee what was in the ſhip; on which the paſſengers, who were concealed, ſallied out, knocked moſt of them down, and the French boatſwain, coming behind Mr. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeantſon, knocked him down likewiſe, and then ordered them to be all bound. The Spaniards in the great cabin ſecured the centinel; and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus recovered their ſhip, made inſtantly for the ſhore, where their own company and the priſoners were all in equal danger of periſhing; which the Captain no ſooner perceived, than he ordered the Engliſh to be unbound; and, by good fortune every man eſcaped upon the rocks, againſt which the Spaniard in his eagerneſs had run his veſſel, and againſt which ſhe was daſhed to pieces. Lieutenant Serjeantſon and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſecured, and ſent priſoners to Lima. The Viceroy of Peru was no ſooner acquainted with this gallant action, than he ordered a new ſhip to be built at Guiaquil for the Captain, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0204000302:113"/>
taxed the traders towards the expence of her, intending this as a reward for the ſervice he had rendered the public, and hoping thereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage others to behave as nobly. On the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the priſoners at Lima, they were cloſely examined; and one of them gave a full account of every thing he knew, particularly of the two men left upon the iſland of Juan Fernandez, and of the bottle with a letter in it; upon which, the Viceroy ordered a ſmall veſſel to be fitted out, to fetch both the one and the other, which was accordingly performed.</p>
            <p>It was not till the 20th that Captain Clipper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton perceived that his laſt prize was retaken; when, conſidering what was beſt to be done, he prudently determined to ſet his Spaniſh priſoners at liberty, as well to ſave proviſions, which, at that time, he could very ill ſpare, as that their good uſage might be ſpeedily known, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to ſuch of his men as were in the enemy's power.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, on the 27th, they came to an anchor with all their prizes, at the iſland of La Plata, and, in his way, took another prize, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cayetan, of 200 tons, having on board 40 negroes, and 30 Spaniards, moſt of them paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Here the Captain began ſeriouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how he ſhould make the moſt of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition for his owners, as well as himſelf, and his company. He knew that all the coaſt was alarmed; and that two men of war, one of fifty, and one of thirty guns, were fitted out on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0204000302:114"/>
to take him: he was ſenſible, that the goods he had on board were not likely to be ranſomed in that part of the world; and that they would prove mere drugs, if brought into this; and therefore laid all theſe things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and, reflecting on a propoſition made by Captain Woods Rogers, to ſend a cargo of ſuch prize-goods to Brazil, he reſolved to try the experiment; and, accordingly, he fitted out the bark in which he took the Counteſs of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guna; mounted her with eight guns; and, putting on board of her thirteen Engliſhmen, and ten negroes, with what proviſions and other neceſſaries he could ſpare, he ſent her with a cargo of European commodities, valued at 10,000 pounds, for Brazil, under the command of Captain Mitchell, his ſecond in command. As ſoon as he was gone, the Captain parted with all his other prizes, preſenting them to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh priſoners, after taking out of them what he thought valuable, and detaining only the Captain of one of them for his pilot, and all the negroes; after which he ſailed from that iſland, in order to cruize in his former ſtation.</p>
            <p>December 12, they ſaw a ſail about five in the evening, and, at ſeven, took her. She was called the Roſary, and laden with proviſions. The launch and pinnace were all the next day employed in bringing on board the cargo, and having got out of her as much as they could ſtow, they cut her main-maſt by the board, leſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0204000302:115"/>
ſhe ſhould overſet, and ſo let her go. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners informed them that the men taken by the Roſario were ſent to Lima by land. On the 27th they looked into Guanchaco bay, and found two ſhips at anchor. They fired a ſhot at each, but they made no return. Sending then their boats aboard, they found them abandoned, and could diſcover nothing left, except ſome bread, and a few jars of water. They hung out a flag of truce, and fired two guns at half an hour's interval, hoping they would have come aboard to ranſom their ſhips. They were anſwered from ſhore; but no boat coming, they waited till next day, and then ſet them on fire.</p>
            <p>It was now reſolved to bear away for refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Gallapagos iſlands, where they might remain unmoleſted till the alarm of their being in thoſe ſeas ſhould be over; and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, put their deſign in execution. On January 9, 1720, they anchored on the north ſide of the Duke of York's iſland, immediately under the Equinoctial, where they found good water, and cleaned their ſhip, which confirms the account given by Captain Cowley, though Captain Rogers could not find the place.</p>
            <p>On the 21ſt of January they obſerved a ſail, and about eleven at night came up with her; and, on firing of their firſt gun, ſhe ſtruck. She was called the Prince Eugene, and had on board the Marquis de Villa Roche, and all his family, who were going to Lima.</p>
            <p>On February 26th, a Spaniard dying of a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0204000302:116"/>
wound he had received at the taking this ſhip, the Marquis deſired he might be buried accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ceremonies; which was granted. When the office for the dead had been perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the corpſe thrown over board, with a large bag of ballaſt tied at his feet, the Spaniards crying thrice, as their cuſtom is on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Bon Voiage,</hi> i. e. a good voyage, the body, to the admiration of every one, preſently floated, and continued floating as far as they could ſee it; which the Marquis concluded to be an ill omen, and declared that ſome ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accident would be the conſequence.</p>
            <p>On March 8, a prieſt, who was on board the Prince Eugene, deſired leave to go on ſhore on the iſland of Velas; which was granted, on his promiſing to perſuade the inhabitants to drive ſome black cattle to the ſhore, in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change them for what goods they liked beſt. On the 16th, he returned with four head of black cattle, ſome fowls, and fruit, as a preſent to the Marquis; but at the ſame time declared, that the Governor would not ſuffer the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to trade. He ſaid, Captain Mitchell had been aſhore there, and had ſhot ſome of their cattle; but that 200 men appearing under arms, they had forced him to retire. The next day ſome letters from the Marquis were intercepted, very little to his honour, ſince they tended to ſtir up the people to ſurpriſe, and ſecure the boat when it came next aſhore to water. Upon this, Captain Clipperton confined him for ſome
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0204000302:117"/>
days; yet, on the 20th, he allowed both the Marquis and his lady to go aſhore, leaving their only child as an hoſtage.</p>
            <p>On April 14, the Marquis, his lady, and the Governor, came aboard; and, an agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made for their ranſom, the lady and child were ſent on ſhore, and the Marquis only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained as an hoſtage. In this tranſaction Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perton appears to have been outwitted by this nobleman, who baſely broke his word, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the crew for truſting him. On April 20th, they anchored in the gulph of Amapala; and, not being able to water there, repaired to the iſland of Tigers, where they did it with great eaſe. On June 4, they ſailed to Gorgona on the ſame errand, and were well ſupplied. On the 24th, they made prize a ſecond time of the St. Vincent, now commanded by Don Clement de Andrado, laden with timber and cocoa-nuts. On Auguſt 11, they anchored, with their prize, at the iſland of Lobos de la Mar, where they ſet up tents on the ſhore, ſcrubbed and cleaned their ſhip, and where the crew talked over their affairs, till they began to think them deſperate. Sometimes, they reflected on the Captain, for pretending to remain in theſe ſeas without their conſort; at other times, they blamed him for giving in to the Spaniſh Marquis's project for ranſoming his ſhip, which, they believed, would never be performed: and, now-and-then, the ſhip's corporal, one James Roch, a bold, buſy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntriguing fellow, threw in ſome ſly inſinuations,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0204000302:118"/>
that, if they muſt go through ſuch hardſhips, it was better they ſhould do it for their own ſakes, than for other peoples; and one Joſeph Maynard, the boatſwain's mate, puſhing things ſtill further, a plot was at laſt formed for ſeizing the Captain, the reſt of the officers, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away with the ſhip. They likewiſe agreed, that, when their deſign was brought to bear, the officers ſhould be ſet on ſhore on the iſland of Lobos, and all who afterwards oppoſed them ſhot without mercy. This wicked combination, however, was happily diſcovered, the two ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders ſeverely puniſhed, and the reſt pardoned; by which wiſe conduct the conſpiracy was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. On the 17th they took a fiſhing-boat, with a large quantity of ſalt-fiſh well cured; but found the St. Vincent, which they had left at an anchor under the iſland of Lobos, driven aſhore, and ſunk: here they put thirty-eight Spaniſh priſoners on board the fiſhing-boat, and ſent them away.</p>
            <p>Nov. 1, they entered the bay of Conception, where, miſſing a prize that outſailed them, they bore away for Coquimbo, and took a ſhip laden with tobacco, ſugar, and cloth, in their paſſage. On the 6th, in the afternoon, they opened that harbour, where they ſaw three men of war lying, with their top-ſails looſe; and theſe no ſooner ſpied them, than they cut their cables, and ſtood after them. The Succeſs hauled cloſe on a wind, and the prize did the ſame; upon which the Spaniſh man of-war that ſailed beſt gave
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0204000302:119"/>
chace to the latter, and took her. The other two ſhips crouded all the ſail they could to come up with the Succeſs, but ſhe outſailing them, made her eſcape. In the Spaniſh prize they loſt their third Lieutenant, Mr. James Milne, and twelve of their beſt men. The Captain who took him was the famous Don Blas de Leſſo, Governor of Carthagena, when attacked by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Vernon. Don Blas treated his priſoner a little roughly at firſt, being enraged to find he had miſſed the Engliſh privateer, and only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken a Spaniſh prize; and, in the firſt tranſport of his paſſion, ſtruck Mr. Milne on the head with the flat of his ſword; but, when he came to himſelf, he ſent for him, and, finding him ſtripped by his ſoldiers, generouſly aſked his pardon, ordered him a new ſuit of cloaths, and kept him for ſome time on board his ſhip. He afterwards procured his liberty at Lima, paid or his paſſage to Panama, where he gave him a jar of brandy, and another of wine, for his ſea-ſtores, put 200 pieces of eight in his pocket, and ſent him to England. This unlucky acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of loſing their prize revived the ill humours among Clipperton's men, who did not indeed plot again, but became exceedingly dejected. On the 16th they ſaw another ſail, and gave chace, which, after a few guns fired on both ſides, bore away, being a clean ſhip, and left them, which proved a lucky eſcape; for this was likewiſe a ſhip of force, fitted out to take Capt. Shelvock, and commanded by one Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerald,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0204000302:120"/>
who, knowing this was not Shelvock's ſhip, and doubting what ſtrength ſhe might be of, had no great ſtomach to engage her. Theſe repeated diſappointments, as they broke the ſpirits of his crew, ſo they had a very bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on Capt. Clipperton himſelf, who began now to betake himſelf to drinking; and, as this vice generally grows upon people under misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, he drank at laſt to ſuch an exceſs, that he was hardly ever quite cool or ſober. It was chiefly owing to this unhappy practice, that he fell into many errors in his future conduct. They were now in want of proviſions, and they reſolved to continue cruiſing to the north, to ſeek a ſupply. In this cruiſe they had but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ſucceſs; and, therefore, on the 27th, they ſet aſhore their Spaniſh priſoners, and then determined to go once more to the Gallapagos in order to refreſh. In their paſſage to theſe iſlands, they began to ſuſpect ſome error in their log-line; and, upon meaſuring, found it three fathoms too ſhort.</p>
            <p>On the 4th of December, they loſt their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer; and the ſame day found themſelves very near the Gallapagos iſlands, but could find no anchoring-place, nor any freſh-water, though they had found a fine road on their firſt viſit, which gave Shelvock occaſion to charge Clipper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton with want of ſkill; they therefore made the beſt way they could to the Iſle of Cocoas, where they hoped certainly to get ſome fiſh, fowl, and cocoa-nuts, moſt of their people being very ſick
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0204000302:121"/>
and weak. On the 17th in the morning they came in ſight of it, which filled them with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible joy. On the 18th, all that could be ſpared went on ſhore to build a kind of booth for the reception of their ſick, who were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently lodged. The Captain opened here the laſt caſk of brandy for the uſe of the ſhip's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and gave every man a dram a day; and, on New-Year's-day, he allowed a gallon of ſtrong beer to every meſs; and, by having here plenty of nouriſhing food and much eaſe, the crew began to recover, and were able to wood and water, though with much difficulty.</p>
            <p>On the 17th of January, 1721, the Captain made the neceſſary diſpoſitions for ſailing; but, when they came to muſter the men, there were no leſs than eleven miſſing, three Engliſhmen, and eight negroes, who choſe rather to remain in this unfrequented iſland, than continue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to dangers and fatigues on board, and to their living conſtantly at ſhort allowance.</p>
            <p>On the 25th, they arrived on the coaſt of Mexico, where, diſcovering a ſail, they ſent their pinnace to give her chace; to whom ſhe inſtantly ſtruck. She proved to be Jeſu Maria, commanded by Capt. Shelvock; and the account he gave was, That he had no more than forty men alive, the reſt being all dead, or diſperſed; that he had loſt the Speedwell at Juan Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez, where they built a bark out of the wreck; that they had coaſted along Chili and Peru, till they came to Piſco, near Lima, where they took
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0204000302:122"/>
this prize; that they had no regular command among them; that they had choſen a quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, carrying every thing by a majority of votes; and that they had quite broken their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles with their owners, and had ſhared all among themſelves.</p>
            <p>On the 27th, Captain Shelvock came aboard, being ſent for by Captain Clipperton and the agent, to give an account of his tranſactions. The boat brought Mr. Dod, Lieutenant of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, having been uſed very ill for his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the owners; at leaſt ſo he aſſerted, and was firmly believed by Captain Clipperton, and his officers. The next day Captain Shelvock ſent on board them ſix cheſts of pitch and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and two barrels of tar, with ſix ſlabs of copper: Captain Clipperton ſpared him twenty-four quarter-deck guns, ſome great ſhot, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and a few other neceſſaries: his people purchaſed cloaths, ſhoes, hats, and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; and Mr. Hendric the purſer, and Mr. Dod, continued in the Succeſs, deſigning never more to ſail with Shelvock.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of March, both time and place favouring, they determined to attempt the Manilla ſhip, before ſhe entered Acapulco.</p>
            <p>On the 13th, they again met Captain Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock, and, at a general conſultation, agreed to make the attempt jointly. But, previous to the ſigning this agreement, it was propoſed by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clipperton to form a joint ſtock, to bury all former miſcarriages in oblivion, and again to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0204000302:123"/>
act in concert for the good of the owners. This propoſition was rejected by Captain Shelvock and his people, who did not care to part with what they poſſeſſed; upon which Captain Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perton and his company, perceiving there was nothing to be expected from their conſort, and that they were too weak of themſelves to effect their purpoſe, determined to ſail directly to the Eaſt-Indies, and inſtantly put their reſolution in execution, without waiting for or conſulting Captain Shelvock.</p>
            <p>The run from the coaſt of Mexico to the iſland of Guam, they performed in fifty-three days; and, May the 13th, anchored in the road of Umatta,—from whence they ſent their pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace aſhore, with a flag of truce, in order to obtain ſome proviſions, which met at firſt with a favourable reception, being told that, if they behaved civilly, and paid honeſtly, they ſhould be furniſhed with what the iſland could afford. Soon after the launch arrived, and brought on board ſome cattle, bread, ſugar, greens, palm-wine, and brandy, from the Governor, with a large quantity of chocolate. In return for which, his health was drank by the whole ſhip's crew, under a ſalvo of ſeven guns: this was the laſt act of civility that paſſed between them.</p>
            <p>On the 18th of May, their priſoner, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de Ville Roche, went aſhore, in company with the agent, the firſt lieutenant and doctor, having previouſly agreed with the Governor about his ranſom. Our launch was employed
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0204000302:124"/>
ſix days in bringing wood, water, and proviſion aboard; during which time, the Governor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired he might have ſome arms and ammunition in exchange: accordingly Captain Clipperton ſent him twelve fuzees, three jars of powder, ſixty round ſhot, four pair of piſtols, beſides cutlaſſes, long ſwords, and daggers. The 25th, they received a letter, in which the Governor demanded the Marquis's jewels, ſome conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plate, and two negroes, being Chriſtians, and ſubjects to the King of Spain; as alſo a certificate, under the Captain and officers hands, that peace was proclaimed, detaining Mr. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey and Mr. Pritty till all this was performed. The Captain returned for anſwer, that the Solidad, the laſt prize taken on the coaſt of Chili, declared there was peace between Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Spain; but, withal, aſſured the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, that, if he did not, in twenty-four hours, ſend the ranſom with the two gentlemen, he would demoliſh the houſes upon the ſhore, burn the ſhip in the harbour, and do all the miſchief he could at the Philippine iſlands.</p>
            <p>After this declaration, hoſtilities commenced on both ſides. The people on ſhore had raiſed a battery from whence they fired at the pinnace. The ſhip ran a-ground between two fires, one from the battery over their heads, and another from the ſhip in the harbour. In endeavouring to get their ſhip off, they ran foul of the rocks. The enemy fired ſo warmly with ſtones and ſhot, that they ſuffered extremely in their hull and

<figure>

                  <head>The distrest Situation of the Succeſs between the fire of the Spanish Fort at Umata &amp; the Ship in the harbour herself at the Same time Wedged on a Rock</head>

rigging. They had three men wounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the misfortune of loſing Mr. Davidſon, their firſt Lieutenant, who was an honeſt man, and a good officer.</p>
            <p>In this emergency, the Captain being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with liquor, the officers ſigned a paper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnifying Mr. Cook for taking upon him the command. They cleared away the hold, ready to ſtart their water, to make the ſhip lighter; and got their upper and lower-deck guns forward, to bring her by the head, the ſhip hanging abaft on the rock.</p>
            <p>During the laſt twenty-four hours, they had happily only one man wounded; but the ſhip was wretchedly torn and mangled between wind and water. The 30th, at ſix in the afternoon, the ſhip floating, they cut away the yawl, ſhe being ſunk with the ſhot; the other boats were much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged; they hove to their ſmall bower, then cut it away, and the other two hawſers, and ſent their pinnace a-head, to tow the ſhip off. Juſt as they got afloat, the enemy fired ſo ſmartly from the new battery, that their ſhot raked them through between wind and water, killing one of their people, and wounding two others. They loſt both their bow-anchors and cables, the ſtern and kedge anchors, four hawſers, four of their lower-deck guns, and nineteen barrels of powder, two men killed, and ſix wounded, having ſtood for no leſs than fifty hours a fair mark for the enemy to fire at; and, if they had not got clear, it was believed they would have been ſunk before
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0204000302:127"/>
morning. At ten in the forenoon they brought to, and began to ſplice their rigging, not a rope of which eſcaped a ſhot. Their carpenters were employed in fixing the maſts and yards, and the reſt of their people in fixing the rigging. At ſix in the afternoon they took their departure, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Pritty in the hands of the enemy. This was certainly one of the worſt errors committed by Clipperton; for he ſhould never have quitted the Marquis, without having the ranſom in his hands.</p>
            <p>On the 24th of June, they were in ſight of the Baſhee Iſlands; and, on the laſt day of the month, they ſaw the iſland-ſhoals of Prata.</p>
            <p>On the 1ſt of July, they fell in with other iſlands, and paſſed ſeveral boats that were fiſhing, though no ſuch iſlands are laid down in any chart. They anchored under one of theſe iſlands, and diſpatched their pinnace for intelligence; but not being able to learn their courſe to Macao, nor to get a pilot, they determined to ſail for Amoy; before which port they arrived on the 5th in the evening, but were afraid to enter it in the night, and therefore plied off and on till day-light. They took notice of a great number of ſnakes in the ſea, which were brought down by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that empty themſelves on that coaſt. In the evening of the 6th of July, they entered the port, and were well pleaſed to find themſelves once more in a place where they might hope to obtain refreſhments, and to be able to repair the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r ſhip; but they were no ſooner anchored in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0204000302:128"/>
this port, than they had 10 cuſtom-houſe officers put on board them. The firſt thing theſe cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-houſe officers demanded was, what the ſhip was reputed to be, and what buſineſs ſhe had there. Captain Clipperton anſwered, the ſhip belonged to the King of Great Britain, and that ſhe put in there by ſtreſs of weather, in order to obtain proviſions and neceſſaries. Next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the men mutinied, and inſiſted on being immediately paid their prize-money. Mr. Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, to whom we are indebted for this account, interpoſing, one Edward Boreman told him, he had beſt deſiſt, unleſs he had a mind to have a brace of balls through his head. Mr. Cook, who commanded in the affair of Guam, and who ſucceeded Mr. Davidſon as Firſt Lieutenant, now demanded thirty ſhares, in right of his office; in which he was ſupported by the men. Captain Clipperton, and the reſt of the officers, ſeeing the turn things were likely to take, were very deſirous, that ſome allowance ſhould be made to the officers that were taken priſoners, and to Mr. Hendry and Mr. Dod, who joined them from the Speedwell: but the men would hear of no ſuch allowances. Whilſt theſe diſputes laſted, ſome took it into their heads to go aſhore, without aſking leave; and, when Captain Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perton would have corrected them, the whole company declared on their ſide, and prevented it. After this, all things fell into confuſion: the men refuſed to work till they had their prize-money; and, upon complaint, a guard of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0204000302:129"/>
ſoldiers was ſent on board, with a peremptory order from the Mandarin to Captain Clipperton to comply.</p>
            <p>On September 16, the diſtribution was made; and no allowance being reſerved for ſuch as were taken priſoners, the repreſentatives of thoſe who were dead, or the two gentlemen who had ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on board the Speedwell, the prize-money of a fore-maſt-man was 419 dollars. According to this diſtribution, the owners ſhare in ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, wrought ſilver, gold, and jewels, amounted to between 6 and 7000 l. ſterling, which Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clipperton cauſed to be immediately put on board a Portugueſe Eaſt-Indiaman, called the Queen of Angels, Don Franciſco la Vero Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, which ſhip was unfortunately burnt at Rio Janeiro, on the coaſt of Braſil, June 6, 1722. So that of theſe effects the owners received no more, the charges of ſalvage deducted, than 1800.</p>
            <p>On September 30, they weighed anchor from the bay of Amoy, which lies in the province of Tonkin, after having paid, under the article of port charges, the moſt exorbitant ſum of 1700 dollars; and then proceeded to Macao, in the road of which they anchored, Oct. 4. As ſoon as Capt. Clipperton entered the port, he ſaluted the fortreſs; which compliment being returned, he went on ſhore, and found there the Captain of the Portugueſe man-of-war, who had undertaken to carry what belonged to the owners to Braſil. The mutinous crew found themſelves at a loſs
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0204000302:130"/>
here, the Portugueſe Captain declaring abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in favour of their Commander; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Captain Cook, and another officer, took paſſage to Canton, to conſult Mr. Winder, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percargo to an Eaſt-Indiaman, and ſon to one of the principal proprietors, as to the meaſures which ſhould be taken about carrying the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs home; and, upon their return, the ſhip was ſurveyed, condemned, and ſold for 4000 dollars: but Capt. Clipperton, to ſhew his opinion of her, agreed with the perſons who bought her, for his paſſage in her to Batavia; a plain indication, that there was no danger of her foundering at ſea. The ſhip being ſold, every man thought himſelf at liberty to ſhift as well as he could, and to uſe his beſt endeavour to ſave what little was left him. They were, by this time, ſatisfied, that Captain Mitchell, his crew, and cargo, were all gone to the bottom, or elſe fallen into the hands of the Spaniards; which was to them pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty much the ſame thing; and, therefore, what they had now in poſſeſſion was all they had to expect. Twenty of them, however, who had agreed to give ſix dollars a-piece for a paſſage in a Chineſe veſſel to Canton, were taken by a pirate, and moſt of them loſt all their effects. After a ſhort ſtay at Macao, Mr. Taylor, the chief mate, got ſafe to Canton in an armed boat, for which he, and the reſt of the Engliſh ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that ſtaid with him, paid 20 dollars a-head: and when they arrived, they were well received, and promiſed all imaginable aſſiſtance towards
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0204000302:131"/>
getting home. There were, at this time, ſeveral ſhips there ready to ſail. The Captains of theſe veſſels being ſolicited by the factory to take Captain Clipperton's men on board, they met, and agreed to carry them to Great Britain for five pounds a man; and accordingly they all paid their money. Mr. Taylor arrived ſafely at Batavia in the month of December, ſailed from thence to the Cape of Good Hope in February, came to St. Helena in March, and, in May 1722, arrived in London. The reſt of the ſhip's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany returned, ſome ſooner, ſome later, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities offered; but, as for Capt. Mitchell, who was ſent to Braſil with a ſmall crew, he was never heard of, and moſt probably was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the iſland of Velas, where he went aſhore for the ſake of getting freſh proviſions.</p>
            <p>Captain Clipperton ſailed in the Succeſs, after ſhe was ſold, as a paſſenger, from Macao to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia; from whence he procured a paſſage home in a Dutch Eaſt-India ſhip, and arrived, in the beginning of July, 1722, at Galway, in Ireland, where he died in leſs than a week of a broken heart.</p>
            <p>Thus ended the unfortunate voyage of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clipperton; that of Captain Shelvock re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be related.</p>

            <head>THE VOYAGE OF CAPTAIN SHELVOCK ROUND THE WORLD.</head>
            <p>WE have already given an account, in the introduction to the preceding voyage, of the motives that influenced the owners to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, and of the difficulties and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that attended the firſt ſetting out. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains now only to relate the proceedings of Captain Shelvock, the ſecond in command, who has himſelf been very circumſtantial in laying before the public the following particulars.</p>
            <p>On the 13th of February, 1719, we ſailed from Plymouth, in company with the Succeſs, of 36 guns, Captain John Clipperton, who, in conſideration of his knowledge of the coaſts and cuſtoms of Chili, Peru, and Mexico, was to act as chief of the expedition.</p>
            <p>On the 15th, I came under his lee, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the crankneſs of my ſhip, and deſired him to ſend for his wine and brandy, which he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, loſt his ſea ſtock of liquors; for we never ſaw any thing of each other till about two years afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0204000302:133"/>Thurſday 19, a ſtorm aroſe, and about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night a ſea drove in our quarter and one of our ſtern dead lights. For a conſiderable time we were under apprehenſions of foundering; a ſucceſſion of prodigious ſeas drove over us; and in this melancholy ſtate, the chain pump was the only means of our deliverance.</p>
            <p>February 20, we had no ſight of the Succeſs, and at midnight ſet the top-ſails and ſtood to the north-weſtward.</p>
            <p>This ſtorm ſo terrified my ſhip's company, that no leſs than 70 of them were reſolved upon bearing away for England, there to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt the ſhip. But, on the 23d, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their diſcontent, I ordered them all on deck, and uſed what arguments with them I was maſter of, to encourage them to proceed; but all I could ſay was but to little purpoſe. They continued in their reſolution to clap the helm a <hi>weather</hi>; and grew to that height of inſolence at laſt, that I was obliged to call upon my officers to aſſiſt in bringing the mutineers to reaſon. For this end moſt of them appeared armed; and the ſight of this ſo ſtartled the ringleaders, that they very ſubmiſſively begged I would forgive them; as I did, upon promiſe for the future to behave as became them. After this, ſeeing them inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be tractable, I ordered them ſome brandy, and they drank to our proſperous voyage. But the very next evening, Simon Hatley, my ſecond Captain, had like to have thrown every thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to confuſion, by telling me upon deck, before
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0204000302:134"/>
moſt of the ſhip's company, that he had private orders from one of the chief of the gentlemen adventurers, and Captain Clipperton, to take the charge of the ſhip upon himſelf. I aſked him, if he had a private commiſſion too? but to this he returned nothing but expreſſions of contempt. This unſeamanlike behaviour, immediately after my ſeparation from my conſort, laid me under a neceſſity of behaving with all poſſible circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, to prevent our being divided into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which would infallibly fruſtrate the ends of our expedition.</p>
            <p>We had a very tedious paſſage to our firſt place of rendezvous, the Canary Iſlands; and did not arrive there till the 17th of March, where having finiſhed our cruiſe without any thing remarkable, except taking an open boat with ſalt, and wine, hearing nothing of the Succeſs, on March the 29th, we took our departure from the iſland of Ferro, in hopes of meeting with Captain Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perton among the iſlands of Cape de Verd, and we took our prize along with us. But in our paſſage, my people began again to murmur; and one Turner Stevens, my gunner, very gravely made a propoſal to me, in the hearing of all the other officers, to go a cruiſing in the Red Sea; for, ſaid he, there can be no harm in robbing thoſe Mahometans; but, as for the poor Spaniards, continued he, they are good Chriſtians, and it would, doubtleſs, be a ſin to injure them. Upon this, I ordered him under confinement; and the man, after that, having threatened, in a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0204000302:135"/>
very outrageous manner, to blow up the ſhip, I, at his own requeſt, diſcharged him as ſoon as we arrived, together with my chief mate, who had likewiſe been guilty of many and great miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors.</p>
            <p>On the 14th of April, we made the Iſle of May; and, running along ſhore, ſaw a wreck, which we were told was the Vanzittern Indiaman, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Hide, who three weeks before had been caſt away. I endeavoured to avail myſelf of this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, to ſupply the neceſſaries we ſtood in need of; but could procure nothing but two or three ſheathing-boards. At this place I ſold our prize for 150 dollars to the Governor; and filled all our water caſks, and gave my ſhip a very good heel. Six of my people having deſerted, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in vain to the officer on ſhore to deliver them up to me; but, threatening the Maſter of a Portugueſe ſhip to make repriſals, he brought me off two of them, which happened to be the beſt. They fell on their knees, and aſked par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, aſſuring me the Commander on ſhore had ſeduced them, his deſign being to ſend the bark I ſold him on the Vanzittern's wreck, where he ſaid they might all make their fortunes; ſo I loſt the other four.</p>
            <p>Finding I could neither hear of the Succeſs, nor get what might be ſerviceable to us in this place, and having read in Frezier's voyage, that in the iſland of St. Catherine's, on the coaſt of Braſil, in latitude 27 deg. 30 min. S. every thing might be had that we ſtood in need of, I
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0204000302:136"/>
concluded it would be beſt for me to put in there.</p>
            <p>April 20, we ſailed from the Iſle of May, having wrenched the drum-head of our cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtane in weighing anchor, which took us up the remainder of the day to repair. We were 55 days in going to St. Catherine's, during which little remarkable happened; except that on June the 5th we ſaw a ſhip ſtemming with us, and ſpoke with her. I ordered the five-oar'd boat to be hoiſted out, and ſent Captain Hatley in her, to enquire after news, and gave him money to buy us tobacco. The Succeſs, amongſt other things, had got our ſtock of tobacco, and had made what the ſeamen call a weſt-country famine on board of us. When Hatley returned, he told me ſhe was a Portugueſe from Rio Janeiro, and bound to Fernambuco. Inſtead of tobacco, which he ſaid the ſhip had none to diſpoſe of, he had laid out my money in china ware, ſweet-meats, and the like; and, upon my expreſſing my diſſatisfaction at his having ſquandered away my money in ſo ſilly a manner, his anſwer was, that he had laid out his own in the ſame manner. My reply was, I did not like his proceedings.</p>
            <p>On Friday, June 19, we made the iſland of St. Catherine's; and at ten the next morning anchored in ten fathom water, the iſland of Gall bearing E. N. E. diſtant two leagues, and the eaſtermoſt point of St. Catherine's E. and by S. diſtant four leagues. The firſt thing I did, was to ſend the carpenter on ſhore, with all the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0204000302:137"/>
people that could be uſeful to him in felling of trees, and ſawing them into plank, and to order the cooper and his crew to trim the caſks, and fill them with water. Thoſe who remained on board, I employed in different ſervices. Mean while the inhabitants came off to us every day with the product of the place, which we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with ſalt.</p>
            <p>On July 2, we were alarmed, at break of day, by the appearance of a large ſhip at anchor four or five miles below the place where we lay. I ſent an officer in the launch, well manned and armed, to ſee what he could make of her, and put my ſhip into the beſt poſture of defence I could. About noon my launch returned, and brought word that this ſhip was the Ruby, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly an Engliſh man-of-war, and now one of M. Martinet's ſquadron; that ſhe came from the South Seas, and was commanded by M. la Jon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiere; that he, his officers, and ſeamen, to the number of 420, were all French; and tho' in the Spaniſh ſervice, they had not the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to moleſt us. My Lieutenant became thus punctually informed, by a direct breach of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in going aboard, and his temerity might have coſt me very dear; for, had they been ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, I ſhould have loſt 23 of my beſt hands; but their return confirmed the truth of his ſtory: yet it was a great misfortune, that I had not, to the beſt of my knowledge, one man of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience or capacity ſufficient to enable him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the common duty of an officer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0204000302:138"/>The next day, the Ruby turned up towards us, and the Captain ſent one of his lieutenants and a prieſt, to aſſure me of his friendſhip, and to deſire I would dine with him, which I did, and met with a very handſome reception, with offers of what money I would have upon my bills on London, or in general any thing elſe his ſhip afforded. He informed me that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards in the South Seas had advice of our two ſhips, and that they talked of fitting out ſome men of war to receive us.</p>
            <p>About this time there was a report ſpread, that Hatley had taken a bribe of the Maſter of the Portugueſe we met on the 5th of June, or had robbed him of 80 or 100 moidores, had given ten to his cockſwain, and ſix to each of his boat's crew, not to divulge it. I charged him with what had been ſaid againſt him; his anſwer was, He had done nothing he was aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, or that he could not juſtify. All I could do was to proteſt againſt him, and I gave the proteſt to Captain Clipperton in the South Seas.</p>
            <p>July 6, M. la Jonquiere, accompanied by ſeveral of his officers and paſſengers, came to dine with me; but in the midſt of our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, my boatſwain took it into his head to create a diſturbance, becauſe he had not been invited into the cabbin as a gueſt. He firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted Betagh the Captain of marines, and then Mr. Adams the ſurgeon. This outrage, which was ſupported by a party he had formed, being, by the help of my officers and the French
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0204000302:139"/>
gentlemen, pretty well quieted, M. la Jonquiere declared, that, if they perſiſted in their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, he would ſee the ringleaders puniſhed by carrying them home in irons; and as they grew a little quieter, he expoſtulated with them, and appealed to themſelves, whether they did not think it monſtrous for people to behave themſelves in ſuch a manner.</p>
            <p>The next morning I was informed, that the authors of the diſturbance were moſt of them ſorry for what had happened the night before, attributing the whole blame to the boatſwain, and the effect of too much liquor. I was glad to hear this, and therefore paſſed it all over with only threatening how I would manage them, if ever they were guilty of the like again. I had reſolved to puniſh the boatſwain in the ſevereſt manner; but I was prevailed on not to do it, he, in very humble plight, aſking my pardon, and begging I would not uſe any ſeverity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. He ſaid it was drink that had made him mad, and withal deſired I would give him leave to go home in the French ſhip. This I willingly agreed to, he being a very odd ſort of a fellow, and always incenſing the people againſt the number of officers, whom he termed Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuckers.</p>
            <p>July 15, we ſaw a great ſhip plying into the harbour's mouth; but when ſhe diſcovered us, ſhe made the beſt of her way out again. This poſſeſſed M. la Jonquiere with a notion of her being our conſort, and put him into a hurry to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0204000302:140"/>
be gone. Accordingly, when night came on, he weighed, and went to ſea the next morning, and at his departure ſaluted me with five guns. Three Frenchmen, belonging to me, went away with him; but I had two Frenchmen, and one Morphew, an Iriſhman, in lieu of them.</p>
            <p>During all this, our carpenter went on but ſlowly in the woods; and at laſt, when we came to caſe the ſtern all over with thick plank, we could find, to my great aſtoniſhment, no nails fit for that uſe. I was now told, that the firſt carpenter, and his crew, had ſold moſt of the ſtores before the ſhip came to Plymouth, which was before I commanded her.</p>
            <p>July 25, a large ſhip came in, called the Wiſe Solomon, of St. Malo's of 40 guns, and about 160 men, commanded by M. Dumain Girard, and bound to the coaſts of Chili and Peru to trade. She was the ſame ſhip we ſaw coming in before, and had ſpoke with the Ruby at ſea. This gentleman, I ſoon perceived, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little forced civility at his firſt arrival, was a deſigning mercenary man, and full of all the conceit and vanity aſcribed to his nation.</p>
            <p>Deſiring him to ſpare me ſome nails, he readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered he would; but, at the ſame time, gave me to underſtand that he could not afford them for leſs than 32 dollars a hundred, which ſum I was fain to give him; I likewiſe bought of him 60 cheeſes, and 300 weight of butter; ſo that it happened well for me, that I had ſome money from one of the Ruby's people. This
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0204000302:141"/>
done, I now thought of making a quick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch from this place, when there came a letter from my ſhip's company to me, with articles an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it for the immediate diviſion of prize-money, which they ſaid they were reſolved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on, alledging that they knew by woeful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience how they were uſed on board the Duke and Dutcheſs, that they were never paid one tenth of their due, and that they had been well informed what a paymaſter a certain gentleman would make, if ever their fortunes ſhould fall into his hands. They were ſo very importunate with me to comply with their articles, that both myſelf, and all my chief officers, thought it would be beſt and moſt adviſeable to ſign their papers with them, rather than run the riſque of their proceeding, when they ſhould get out to ſea, to acts of piracy. As ſoon as they had gained their point, they expreſſed great ſatisfaction, and promiſed to be always ready to hazard their lives in any undertaking I ſhould think condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the ends we were fitted out for.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 3, there came in here the St. Franciſco Xavier, a Portugueſe man-of-war, of 40 guns, and 300 men, from Liſbon, bound to Macao in China, commanded by Captain la Riviere, a Frenchman. I made no doubt but that Captain Hatley's affair would be reported to this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and, therefore, I told Hatley, that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected he would go and vindicate himſelf to the Portugueſe Captain, to prevent any diſturbances
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0204000302:142"/>
that might ariſe on his account. To which he readily replied he would.</p>
            <p>Hatley, at his return, told me, the Captain ſeemed to be angry with him for thinking he could harbour any ill thought of a gentleman bound on a voyage, which, to his knowledge, could hardly fail of anſwering the largeſt expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 6, three of my men deſerted, and the mate and his party went up to the Portugueſe plantations in ſearch of them. It being almoſt mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, the inhabitants took the alarm, and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in ambuſcade to deſtroy them as they came back. No ſooner had they returned into the boat, than they heard them ruſhing out of the woods, crying, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Kill the dogs, kill all the Engliſh dogs."</q> This outery was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly followed by a volley of ſmall arms, which wounded three of my men, two through the thigh, and another through the arm.</p>
            <p>I ſent a letter of complaint, by Hatley, to the Captain of the Portugueſe man-of-war in the harbour: but Hatley, at his entrance into the ſhip, was furiouſly aſſaulted by Emanuel Manſa (the Captain of the iſland), crying out, This was the man who had committed ſo many inſolencies towards them, and that this was he who had burnt one of their houſes, and had made it a common practice to abuſe and affront him with the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious name of cuckold. Upon this excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the ſhip's company ſided with Manſa, and fell upon Hatley, and would certainly have uſed both him and his boat's crew very ſeverely,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0204000302:143"/>
had not the Captain and his officers, with much difficulty, prevented it; for the Portugueſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were exaſperated to that degree, that it is more than likely they would have murdered him, had they not been timely hindered.</p>
            <p>The Captain, in his anſwer to my letter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his ſorrow for what had happened, ſaid the people were without law, and that it was out of his power to puniſh them; that they were wild and lurked in the woods; and that in ſeeking revenge, it would only expoſe my men to butchery. He aſked my pardon for the ill uſage my officer had met with on board his ſhip; but withal gave me to underſtand, there could be no greater provocation to the people of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than that which Hatley was accuſed of by Manſa. That his ſhip's company had got Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley amongſt them before he knew any thing of the matter, and that he was obliged to call his prieſt to his aſſiſtance, before he could get him out of their hands, and in a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome manner touched upon Hatley's ſtory. I made no long ſtay after this diſaſter, but took our departure from the northernmoſt point of St. Catherine's on the 9th of Auguſt; and on the 19th, Mr. La Port, my third Lieutenant, broke his leg.</p>
            <p>From the time we left St. Catherine's, till now, we had for the moſt part ſqually weather. As we advanced to the ſouthward, my people's ſtomachs increaſed with the ſharpneſs of the air to that degree, that the allowance which the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment gives in the navy was not ſufficient to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0204000302:144"/>
ſatisfy their hunger. Some of my officers, in particular Mr. Betagh, my Captain of marines, who had been formerly a purſer of a man-of-war, and a man whom I had a great regard for, was the champion for an addition of allowance at my table; for he told me he had orders from the adventurers to eat with me; and what was my table, if I did not eat better than the cook? He did not ſtop here, but urged by his intemperance, and finding me unwilling to ſquander away our proviſions, without knowing when or where we might get any more, he at length had the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to tell me publicly, that the voyage ſhould be ſhort with me, which he often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I ſhould have had reaſon to fear it, had he been capable of commanding; but, for his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, I excluded him both from my meſs and the great cabbin. Upon this, finding I was in earneſt with him, and fearing ſome heavier pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, he ſent me a letter, aſking my pardon for what he had done; upon which I again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored him in a handſomer manner than he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deſerved, as will appear by the ſequel.</p>
            <p>Between St. Catherine's and the river of Plate, the whales, grampuſſes, and other fiſh of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous bulk, are in ſuch numbers, that I cannot ſee why a trade for blubber might not be carried on here. I may venture to affirm, it is a ſafer navigation than that carried on to the northward, and I am apt to believe here is a greater certainty of ſucceſs in making up a cargo.</p>
            <p>Sept 19, about midnight I perceived the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be diſcoloured all at once, and upon heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0204000302:145"/>
the lead, we found ourſelves in 26 fathom water; this done, I ſtood off again to ſea, but we did not deepen our water in the running of five leagues. This ſeems to be a bank very near the entrance of the ſtraits of Magellan. I had a fine opportunity of going through theſe ſtraits: but Captain Clipperton in his plan pretended, out of the abundance of his judgment and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the ſtraits of Le Mair would be the beſt navigation for us, though he himſelf paſſed through the ſtraits of Magellan. From this I might have conjectured, that he, who never was fond of having a conſort with him, deſigned to make uſe of this as a likely expedient to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate himſelf; for he was a man that would do any thing, though ever ſo diſhoneſt or inhuman;—[a reflection, however, that carries more of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice than of truth on the face of it.]</p>
            <p>Sept. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, the fog clearing up, we had a full, but melancholy proſpect, of the moſt deſolate country that can be conceived, ſeeming no other than continued ridges and chains of mountains, one within another, perpetually buried in ſnow. Towards noon we were becalmed within three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>gues of the mountains called the Three Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo named from their equal height, near reſemblance, and proximity to one another. Till now, we had not been ſenſible of any helps or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances by currents; but this afternoon we were hurried with incredible rapidity into the ſtraits, and juſt as we had gained ſomewhat more than the mid-paſſage, the northern tide came ruſhing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0204000302:146"/>
upon us with a violence equal to that of the tide which had brought us in, and, to our great aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, drove us out of the ſtraits again at a great and extraordinary rate, notwithſtanding we had a freſh and fair gale with us at N. W. Upon the ſhifting of this tide to windward, there aroſe ſuch a ſhort, and, while it laſted, ſo hollow a ſea, and ſo lofty withal, that we alternately dipped our bowſprit end, and poop lanthorns, into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Our ſhip laboured in the moſt alarming manner, and became inſenſible of the guidance of her helm; but at midnight the tide ſhifted, and we put through the ſtraits without ſeeing the land on either ſide, and in the morning had a very good offing to the ſouthward. We had found it very cold before we came this length, but now we began to feel the extreme of it. The bleak weſterly winds of themſelves would have been ſufficiently piercing, but they were always attended with drifts either of ſnow or ſleet, which, continually beating on our ſails and rigging, caſed the maſts and every rope with ice, ſo that there was no handling them. It was common with us to be two or three days together lying to under bare poles, expoſed all the while to the aſſaults of prodigious ſeas, much larger than any I had ever obſerved before. The winds reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus tempeſtuouſly, without intermiſſion, in the weſtern board, we had ſtretched away into lat. 61 deg. 30 min. S. where we were in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual dread of falling foul of iſlands of ice, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0204000302:147"/>
where we found the variation to be 22 deg. 6 min. to the north-eaſtward.</p>
            <p>October 1, as we were furling the main-ſail, one William Camell cried out, that his hands were ſo benumbed, he could not hold himſelf; but before thoſe who were next to him could lay hold of him, he fell into the ſea, and the ſhip making freſh way, and the ſea running high, we loſt ſight of him before we could bring to. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, one would imagine it impoſſible that any thing could live in ſo rigid a climate; and, truly, we ſaw neither fiſh nor bird, except one ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary albitroſs, which accompanied us for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days, and hovered about us, till Hatley con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, in a gloomy fit, that the company of this melancholy bird brought us ill luck, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſtroy him, in hopes we might then have better weather.</p>
            <p>October 22, at eight at night, we carried away our fore-top-maſt, and rigged another next morning. We crept by very ſlow degrees, after we had ventured to tack and ſtand to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in hopes to weather our way into the Great South Seas; and indeed it may be averred, that from the time we paſſed the ſtraits of Le Mair, till we had the firſt ſight of the coaſt of Chili, we had been continually diſtreſſed by the winds, and diſcouraged by bad weather.</p>
            <p>Nov. 14, we ſaw the coaſt of Chili, diſtant 10 leagues, lat. by obſervation 47 deg. 28 min. S.</p>
            <p>Being now arrived on the confines of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſettlements, we found ourſelves under an
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0204000302:148"/>
abſolute neceſſity of contriving ſome means by which we might recruit our wood and water. We had but ſeven buts of water remaining, and a much leſs proportion of wood. I thought it would be beſt for us to go firſt to Narborough's iſland, and accordingly directed our courſe to that place.</p>
            <p>Nov. 21, at ſeven in the morning, we had ſoundings in 28 fathom water, of fine grey and black ſand. But here we found a wild road, which could not be deemed fafe for us—[Here Capt. Shelvock laments it as a great misfortune, that he could not reach Juan Fernandez, in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 33 deg. 30 min. S. without ſtopping: tho' at the ſame time it is plain, that he loſt more time in ſearching for a nearer place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, than the direct paſſage to that iſland would have taken him up. But the imputation he would throw upon Clipperton is applicable only to himſelf: he never intended to act under him; and all his excuſes are mere ſhifts.]</p>
            <p>Surrounded with doubts and apprehenſions, ſays he, leſt we ſhould be obliged to advance too far on theſe coaſts, without a competent ſtock of proviſions, one Joſeph de la Fontaine, a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, aſſured me, that, if I would go to the iſland of Chiloe, which was at that time a little to the northward of us, there was no place for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe like it in all the South Seas; that the towns of Chacao and Calibuco, the firſt on the iſland itſelf, and the ſecond on the continent, were rich
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0204000302:149"/>
places; that the former was the uſual place of reſidence of the Governor, and that at the latter there was a wealthy college of Jeſuits; and that there were conſiderable magazines kept up, which were always well ſtocked with proviſions of all kinds.</p>
            <p>On theſe conſiderations I formed a reſolution of going to Chiloe; and on the 30th of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we entered the channel, with an intent to ſurprize and attack the towns of Chacao and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libuco: but, immediately after we had come to, the windward tide made out with prodigious ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, which inſtantly cauſed a great ſea; and the wind increaſing at the ſame time, the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel all about us appeared like one continued breach. In the midſt of this our ſhip laid a great ſtrain upon her cable, which unfortunately part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we loſt our anchor. We paſſed by two commodious bays; and, at length, we rounded a point of land out of the tide's way, where we were commodiouſly ſheltered from all inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and, the next morning, I ſent my ſecond Lieutenant to make a diſcovery of the towns of Chacao and Calibuco, and, at the ſame time, Captain Hatley, to find out a watering place for us. He ſoon returned again, and brought with him an Indian, who gave us hopes of a ſufficient ſupply of all we wanted, but afterwards came in the evening to tell us, the country was forbidden to ſupply us with any thing The Lieutenant not being yet returned, this information made me
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0204000302:150"/>
apprehend the enemy had taken him, and by that means had learned who we were.</p>
            <p>December 3, there came to us a Spaniſh offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, in a piragua rowed by eight Indians, who was ſent by the Governor to be informed who we were. As ſoon as we had a ſight of the piragua, I hoiſted French colours, and, when the Spaniard came on board, I told him, we were a homeward-bound French ſhip, called the St. Roſe, and that my name was le Janis le Breton. Under this notion he ſtaid with us all. night, and next morning departed, not ſeeming to ſuſpect us. I wrote to the Governor by this gentleman, ſignifying that I wanted a ſupply of proviſions to carry me back to France, deſiring him to aſſiſt me in what he could; and received for anſwer a complaint againſt the violences of our men, in killing their ſheep, and driving away their cattle, by which I knew that they had ſeen my Lieutenant. But I was in deſpair of ever ſeeing him, or the people who were with him, any more. I therefore ſent a meſſage to the Governor, that proviſions I wanted, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions I muſt have, and that very ſpeedily; and that all the forces of Chacao, Calibuco, Carel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mapo, or Caſtro, ſhould not frighten or deter me from ſupplying myſelf. Soon after, there came a piragua with a meſſage, ſignifying, that if I would ſend an officer to Chacao, he would treat with me. But I gave him for anſwer, that I would treat no where but on board my own ſhip; and farther, that it was now too late, ſince
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0204000302:151"/>
I had already diſpatched 80 men to take all they could find.</p>
            <p>Soon after the pinnace arrived, which I had ſo long given over for loſt, with all her crew; but they were ſo terrified, that I had no hopes of their being fit for ſervice in any reaſonable time. The officer had no excuſe for not return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ſoon as he had got a ſight of the town, but that the tide hurried him away at unawares, and that in the fright he had forgot he had a graplin in the boat to come to with, till the tide had ſhifted. I ſaid but little to him; and only made the officer ſenſible of his miſmanagement, which had been the ruin of the advantageous views I might have had, in taking either Chacao or Calibuco.</p>
            <p>December 16, we had now our decks full of live cattle, ſuch as European ſheep, hogs, gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicces, poultry in abundance, and hams, &amp;c. as alſo a good quantity of wheat, barley, pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes, maize, or Indian corn; and, in ſhort, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted that I had added four months proviſions to what remained of our Engliſh ſtock, and that without the leaſt hindrance or moleſtation from the enemy.</p>
            <p>December 17, we began to unmoor, and at noon we weighed, and ſailed out with the wind at W. S. W. The night before we departed, one of our men made his eſcape into the woods. It was beyond all diſpute that this fellow would give a full account of us. This, added to the ill conduct of my Lieutenant, together with the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0204000302:152"/>
contrary execution of all my orders, by thoſe officers whom I had hitherto entruſted in affairs of importance, made me deſpair of ever having any thing done to the purpoſe; and on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, I could not forbear reflecting on the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management of ſome gentlemen in England, who blindly made uſe of their intereſt to prefer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to poſts for which they were utterly unfit.</p>
            <p>I ſailed from Chiloe with a deſign to go ſtraight to the iſland of Juan Fernandez, but was prevented by my people, who were poſſeſſed with notions of vaſt advantages to be made by going to the port of Conception. It was our Frenchman, who had been ſo inſtrumental in our Chiloenian attempt, who was the cauſe of this. Finding his accounts hitherto tolerably juſt, they once more liſtened to him; and every one of my ſhip's company, who could ſay any thing at this juncture, did not fail to ſpeak his mind ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what inſolently; particularly William Morphew, one of the men I had out of the Ruby, and who had been in theſe ſeas ſeveral years, took upon him to tell me, that it could not ſignify much whether we arrived two or three days ſooner or later at Juan Fernandez; that I was a ſtranger here, but that the Frenchman and himſelf were ſo well acquainted with theſe ſeas, that every body hoped I would be adviſed and go to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and not put a mere punctilio to orders in the balance againſt a certainty of ſucceſs, if we were ſo happy as to arrive at that port in time. Conſidering now how eaſily they might be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0204000302:153"/>
brought to throw off command, and how little I ſhould be able to help myſelf, alone, as I might be ſaid to be, if they came to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, I complied with them, and reſolved to ſpend two or three days in going to Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, on December the 23d, we came abreaſt of the Teats of Bio Bio, and in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived in the bay, from whence I ordered the boats, well manned and armed, to go up in the night to ſurprize what ſhips or veſſels might be in the harbour, and to make what obſervations they could concerning the place.</p>
            <p>About noon, Captain Hatley returned in the pinnace, and informed me he had taken the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidad d'Anday, of 150 tons, the only ſhip in the road or port, lately come from Baldivia, laden with timber; had no body on board except the boatſwain, an old negroe, and two Indian boys. He took alſo a ſmall veſſel of about 25 tons, near the iſland of Quiriquine, which belonged to a prieſt who had been gathering fruits, and was now made a priſoner in her, together with four or five Indians. This veſſel we found very uſeful, and called her the Mercury, being well built, and ready upon all occaſions to look into port. There was another ſmall veſſel that paſſed within piſtol-ſhot, but Capt. Hatley never once offered to follow her, or bring her to. Hatley, truly, ſaid, he did not mind her, though his boat's crew all agreed ſhe was full of men. This veſſel was bringing advice of us from Chiloe. I
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0204000302:154"/>
did not fail to reprimand him for this, but to what effect!</p>
            <p>Dec. 26, the prieſt being very ſolicitous to ranſom his bark, he left my ſhip in the morning, and, in my pinnace rowed by Indians, went aſhore to get money for that purpoſe. At noon, Mr. Brooks, firſt Lieutenant, brought down the ſhip we had taken, and anchored her about half a mile ſhort of us. The boatſwain of her had not been on board above two hours before he gave me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of a veſſel laden with wine, brandy, and other valuable things, bound to the iſland of Chiloe, lying at anchor in the bay of Herradura, about two leagues to the northward of us. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ordered Mr. Randall, our ſecond Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, with the boatſwain of the Solidad, and 25 men, to go; with poſitive orders not to ſet a foot on ſhore, or make any hazardous attempt whatever. But the next evening they returned with a diſmal ſtory, that they went into the bay, and finding the veſſel hauled dry on ſhore, the officer ordered his people to land, and bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way what they could out of her; but their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer was ſoon ſtopped; for they had no ſooner got upon the bank, than they diſcovered the enemy ruſhing out furiouſly upon them. They all eſcaped except five, who were overtaken in ſhoal water, and they all agreed that thoſe five were cut to pieces. The Spaniards came down upon them, preceded by 20 or 30 horſes a-breaſt, linked to each other. Theſe were two deep; then came the enemy, mounted, and lying upon
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0204000302:155"/>
their horſes necks, driving the others before them. They were not once ſeen to ſit upright in their ſaddles, except when there was no danger, or to fire their muſquets. This new addition to our misfortunes quite diſpirited the greateſt part of my ſhip's company. Nothing was now heard but murmuring, and damning the South Seas, and declaring that, if this was making their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, they had better have ſtaid at home and begged about the ſtreets; but juſt as I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulating with Mr. Randall, who conducted this unfortunate undertaking, I was agreeably ſurprized with the ſight of a large ſhip, which we ſaw coming about the northernmoſt point of the iſland of Quiriquine. It was almoſt dark, and ſhe could not perceive what we were, ſo that ſhe ſtood towards us without fear. As ſoon as ſhe approached near enough, I hailed her, to which ſhe returned no anſwer, and I fired into her. This was no ſooner done, than ſhe came to, and called for quarter. She was called the St. Fermin, came from Callao, burthen about 300 tons, and laden with ſugar, melaſſes, rice, coarſe French linnen, and ſome cloths of Quito, together with a ſmall quantity of chocolate, and about 5 or 6000 dollars in money and wrought plate. I ſent Mr. Hendry (the agent for prizes) to inſpect her lading, and to order every thing he could find valuable out of her, and the ſhip's company ſent their agent likewiſe. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon they returned, and brought all the bales, boxes, cheſts, portmanteaus, &amp;c. that were in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0204000302:156"/>
her; and alſo all the rice, with a large quantity of ſugar, melaſſes, and chocolate, and about 7000 weight of good ruſk, with all her eatables, and ſtores.</p>
            <p>Don Franciſco Larrayn, her Captain, deſired to ranſom his ſhip, to which I willingly conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſuffered him to go in his own launch to raiſe money for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Dec. 30, there came a boat with an officer and a flag of truce, who brought word, that three only of our people in the ſkirmiſh at Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radura were killed, the other two wounded, and in a fair way of recovery, and that the boat had brought advice of us, as I ſuſpected, from that iſland. The officer brought me ſeven jars of very good wine, a preſent from the Governor, and a letter full of civility, but written with a great deal of craft. He deſired to ſee my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and then he would treat with me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laws of arms.</p>
            <p>January 1, Captain Betagh went to Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a copy of my commiſſion, the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of war, &amp;c. and ſoon after he returned with a Flemiſh jeſuit, a Spaniſh lawyer, and an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and a Scotchman. The jeſuit aſſured me he was only come to pay his reſpects to me, and to do his utmoſt to promote the affair of the ranſom, and bring it to an immediate concluſion. Therefore the firſt thing I did, was to ſhew my commiſſion to the Engliſhman, who read it in Spaniſh. The jeſuit then told me, that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the St. Fermin and Solidad had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0204000302:157"/>
to give me 12,000 dollars for the ranſom of both the ſhips, and the Mercury included, inſtead of 16000 dollars which I had inſiſted on for the St. Fermin only. To this I poſitively anſwered, that all their perſuaſions, artifices, and pretences, ſhould never make me agree with them. We had taken in the St. Fermin, ten large ſilver candleſticks, each of them weighing above twenty-five pounds ſterling. The holy father, in a ſuppliant manner, repreſented to me that they were a legacy to his convent, and hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I would make no diſpute of ſo noble a charity as it would be to put them into the poſſeſſion of thoſe for whom they were deſigned. I offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to let him have them for their weight in dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which, conſidering the great price they pay in thoſe parts for the faſhion of wrought plate, was a very advantageous offer. But he ſaid they never bought any thing for ſacred uſes; and that, as the workmen put a great deal of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay into plate, it would be difficult to determine the different values of the dollars and the candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks; ſo, after a deal of needleſs diſpute and entreaties, both about this, and the ranſom of the ſhips, the jeſuit and the reſt affirming that the Captains of the St. Fermin, &amp;c. were not able to raiſe above 12,000 dollars, there was nothing done.</p>
            <p>Two days paſſing without news from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, I began to be certainly convinced they had ſomething elſe in view more than the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of the ranſoms; but on January the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0204000302:158"/>
4th, my two wounded men came on board, and with them brought a letter, importing, that, as he had now ſent back the priſoners, he hoped no difficulty would remain to prevent my ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſhore all the priſoners belonging to him.</p>
            <p>January 6, the morning paſſed away without any news from the town. I now began to make preparations for ſailing, and in thoſe preparations ſpent the greateſt part of the day. There being no appearance of any boat coming off to us, I ordered the St. Fermin to be ſet on fire. Her cotton ſails being looſed, made a prodigious blaze. I had already ſet fire to the Solidad, to quicken their motions; and now, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the treaty, I immediately got under ſail, much chagrined at the loſs of ſo many days without reaping any advantage. I was afterwards informed, that, if they had thought I would have deſtroyed the St. Fermin, they would have given even 20 or 30,000 dollars to have ſaved her; for ſhe was one of the beſt ſailers and the beſt fitted out ſhip of any of the Peruvian traders. I now directed our courſe to the iſland of Juan Fernandez, taking the Mercury with us.</p>
            <p>January 8, the ſea was all day perfectly red, appearing as if vaſt quantities of blood had been thrown into it, and curdled by the water. This, the Spaniards ſay, is occaſioned by the ſpawn of prawns, which muſt certainly be a miſtake. In our paſſage, the plunder was ſold before the maſt, by the ſhip's company's agent, at very extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0204000302:159"/>
prices. At the ſame time the account of every thing being taken, and the value of the ſhares calculated, the ſhip's company deſired me to let them have their dividend, according to the articles at St. Catherine's, which requeſt I could not withſtand. The prize-money and plunder amounting to ten pieces of eight per ſhare, was thereupon diſtributed; and all the bales of coarſe cloth, bays, linnen, ribbons, lace, ſilk, and ſeveral other ſorts of mercery wares, were equally divided, half to the owners, and half to the ſhip's company.</p>
            <p>Jan. 11, at ſix in the morning, we ſaw the iſland of Juan Fernandez, and from that day till the 15th I kept ſtanding off and on the ſhore for my boats, which were a fiſhing, who not having hitherto diſcovered any marks whereby we might conclude that Clipperton had been here, I thought it proper to render my coming hither ſerviceable in ſome reſpect, and therefore ſent the Mercury on ſhore to ſtop her leaks, while the boats continued catching fiſh, of which we ſalted as much as filled five puncheons. At length, going on ſhore to make a nicer ſearch, ſome of my men accidentally ſaw the word MAGEE, which was the name of Clipperton's ſurgeon, and CAPT. JOHN cut out under it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a tree, but no directions left, as was agreed on by him in his inſtructions to me. His actions being thus groſly repugnant to his inſtructions, it was evident he never meant I ſhould keep him company, or ever join with him again,—[This
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0204000302:160"/>
reflection may with great juſtice be retorted on the writer himſelf, and can in no ſhape affect Clipperton who followed his inſtructions in the moſt ſcrupulous manner.]—However, being by this confirmed in the certainty of Clipperton's arrival, I directly made the beſt of my way, and ſailed to the northward.</p>
            <p>Jan. 21, having a deſign to look into Copiapo as I went along ſhore, I ſent Mr. Dodd, ſecond Lieutenant of Marines, with eight men, as a rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement to the Mercury's crew, and the next evening they left us ſteering in for the land, whilſt I kept a proper offing, to prevent our being diſcovered. The next day the officer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and told me, he had looked into the port, but could ſee no ſhipping there, upon which I made him ſenſible of his error, and ſent him to the right place, which was about ſix leagues to the northward of us, and ordered him to be ready to look into Caldera by day-light the next morning. They did ſo, and ſaw nothing; but, inſtead of making uſe of the land wind to come off to me, they kept along ſhore, till the ſea breeze came on, and could not come to me till the morning after, by which means they hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me almoſt a whole day and night's ſailing; and in this vexatious manner were my orders al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways executed!</p>
            <p>Feb. 5th, I diſpatched Mr. Brooks a-head to diſcover if there were any ſhipping at Arica, and next day, I had a ſight of the head land of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and the iſland of Guano, with a ſhip at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0204000302:161"/>
on the northern ſide of it, and ſaw the Mercury ſtanding out of the bay, by which I judged the ſhip was too warm for her, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made all poſſible haſte to get up to her with our ſhip. When I came into the port, I found her already taken, and that the Mercury only went accidentally adrift. This prize was called the Roſario, of about 100 tons, laden with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morants dung, which the Spaniards call guana, and is brought from the iſland of Iquique, for the culture of the agi, or cod-pepper, in the vale of Arica. There was no white face in her but the pilot, whom I ſent to ſee if her owner would ranſom her. At ſeven o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I received a letter from the owner, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his poverty, and declaring his readineſs to comply to the utmoſt of his power: and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man was as good as his word.</p>
            <p>I agreed upon reſtoring to him his ſhip, and ſix negroes, for 1500 pieces of eight; and he was ſo punctual and expeditious, that at 10 the next night he brought the ſum agreed on. Soon after the receipt of this, we took a veſſel of about 10 tons, as ſhe was coming into the road, with a cargo of dried fiſh and guana, within a mile of the town. The maſter of this bark likewiſe came off upon a balſe, which is an odd ſort of an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation, made of two large ſeal-ſkins ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blown up like bladders, and then made faſt and joined together by a frame of wood. On this he brought off two jars of brandy, and 40 pieces of eight, for his ranſom, which, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0204000302:162"/>
his mean appearance, was as much as I could have expected. One part of his freight was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, which was his dried fiſh.</p>
            <p>Feb. 9, 1720, I ſailed from Arica, and as I went out, the inhabitants placed themſelves round the bay, and made a very good hedge fire after me for about half an hour. I judged there could not be leſs than 5 or 600 of them. I ſhaped my courſe for the road of Hilo, which we had a ſight of the next day at three in the afternoon, where we ſaw one large ſhip and three ſmall ones at anchor. The great ſhip imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately hoiſted French colours, and in the end proved to be the Sage Solomon, of 40 guns, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Monſ. Dumain, whom I had left at St. Catherine's, and who was now reſolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the veſſels that were with him, and obſtruct my coming in. I at firſt thought of ſhewing my reſentment, but, upon ſecond thoughts, I clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the helm a-weather, and ſtood out to ſea.</p>
            <p>Feb. 12, in the morning, the ſhip's company had their moiety of the money taken at Arica divided amongſt them, according to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſhares.</p>
            <p>Feb. 22, I came a-breaſt of Callao, the port for Lima, which is the metropolis of Peru; but there being no great proſpect of performing much here in our preſent ſituation, I had nothing to do but to ſlip away from hence in the night, by the help of a favourable breeze.</p>
            <p>Feb. 26, the officers in the Mercury deſired to be relieved, and it being Capt. Hatley's turn
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0204000302:163"/>
to go in her, he propoſed to me that he might continue along ſhore, till we had got the length of Lobos, an iſland in about ſeven degrees of ſouth latitude. I could not but approve of this, conſidering the probability there was of his meeting with the Panama ſhips; and every body being well pleaſed, I added to their complement of men, and gave them a month's proviſions, and mounted two of our quarter-deck guns on the Mercury, and lent Captain Hatley my pinnace. As ſoon as every thing was ready for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, Captain Betagh, whoſe duty and turn it was to relieve the marine officer in the Mercury, being unwilling to go on this party, addreſſed himſelf to the people, and with a fearful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance told them, that he, and the reſt who were to go with him, were ſent for a ſacrifice, with many other expreſſions tending to create a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mutiny. I now imagined no leſs than that he was about to act what he had threatened when he told me, it ſhould be a ſhort voyage with me; and, therefore, I addreſſed myſelf to the ſhip's company, deſired to know who amongſt them were of Betagh's opinion? Their anſwer was with one voice, None. This done, I ordered the Mercury alongſide, and Hatley and Betagh went on board of her; and, putting off from us, gave three cheers, and ſtood right in for the land, in the latitude by obſervation of 10 deg. 9 min S.</p>
            <p>The very next day they took a ſmall bark la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with rice, chocolate, wheat, flour, and the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0204000302:164"/>
like. The day following they took another. On the fourth day of their abſence they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came maſters of a ſhip of near 200 tons, worth 150,000 pieces of eight. Fluſhed with this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, it ſeems Betagh prevailed on Hatley, and the greateſt part of the people with them, to lay hold of this opportunity and go to India: but they no ſooner clapped their helm a-weather, than they ſaw a ſail ſtanding towards them, which, in ſhort, proved to be a Spaniſh man-of-war, who caught them, and put an end to their Indian voyage. The Engliſh were treated very indifferently; but Betagh, it ſeems, who was of their religion, and of a nation which the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards affect to be fond of, was made an officer, and uſed very reſpectfully. This he certainly deſerved at their hands; for he gave them an account of the whole ſcheme of our voyage; and not only informed them of what we had done, but alſo of what I deſigned to do; ſo that they did not doubt but I myſelf ſhould be in their hands very ſpeedily.</p>
            <p>Feb. 29, at ſix in the morning, we ſaw a ſail at anchor in the road of Guanchaco; at eleven we came up, and anchored along ſide of her. There was no body on board of her but two Indiamen and a boy. They informed us, there was a rich ſhip in the cove of Payta.</p>
            <p>March 21, at three in the afternoon, we ſaw the Pena Oradado, or the <hi>Hole in the Rock</hi>; and in an hour afterwards, we entered the cove of Payta with French colours flying. There we
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0204000302:165"/>
found only a ſmall ſhip at anchor with her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt out, and her main-top-maſt unrigged; but the taking of this town being conſidered in the ſcheme of our voyage as a matter of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, I conſulted with my officers concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the propereſt methods of going about it. At two of the clock the next morning I landed with 46 men, leaving Mr. Coldſea the maſter, and ſome others, to bring the ſhip nearer in, that we might the more expeditiouſly embark the plunder we might get. Being now on ſhore, I marched up to the great church without meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any oppoſition; and indeed I found the town entirely deſerted by the inhabitants. At day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light we ſaw what ſeemed great bodies of men on the hills, on each ſide of us, who, I expected, when they had viewed our ſtrength, would have paid us a viſit; but I found, that as we marched up towards them, we drove them before us. The remainder of the day was ſpent in ſhipping off what plunder we had got, which conſiſted of hogs, fowls, brown and white calavances, beans, Indian corn, wheat, flour, ſugar, and as much cocoa-nut as we were able to ſtow away, with pans, and other conveniences for preparing it; ſo that we were ſupplied with breakfaſt-meat for the whole voyage, and full of proviſions of one kind or other. In the afternoon there came to us a meſſenger, to know what I would take for the ranſom of the town and ſhip; to which I anſwered, I would have 10,000 pieces of eight, and thoſe to be paid in twenty-four hours, if they
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0204000302:166"/>
intended to ſave the town, or ſhip either. But the Governor gave me to underſtand in plain terms, that he neither could nor would ranſom the town, and did not care what I did with it, ſo that I ſpared the churches. Having received this negative anſwer, and got every thing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable out of the town, I inſtantly ordered it to be ſet on fire; and the houſes, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely dry, conſumed away a-pace. But no ſooner was Payta in a blaze than thoſe on board made ſignals for me to come off, and kept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly firing towards the mouth of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Upon which I ordered all hands off, and went firſt on board myſelf in a canoe, with three men only; but, before I had got half way, ſaw a large ſhip lying with her fore-top ſail aback, and with a Spaniſh flag flying at her fore-top-maſt-head. At this proſpect two of my three people were ready to ſink; and when I looked back on the town, I could not forbear wiſhing that I had not been ſo haſty. As the Admiral was coming in with all his ſails ſpread, Mr. Coldſea, by the aſſiſtance of the few on board, fired at him ſo ſmartly, that he ſtopped the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's career. The Spaniard apprehending he ſhould have hot work with us, brought his ſhip to, that he might put himſelf into a condition of making a vigorous attack upon us. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity of the enemy gave me an opportunity of getting on board, and ſuffered my men to come off, about 50 in number, but the Spaniard was within piſtol-ſhot before they had all got
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0204000302:167"/>
into the ſhip; upon which, we cut our cable, and our ſhip falling the wrong way, I had but juſt room enough to fill clear of him. Being now cloſe by one another, his formidable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſtruck an univerſal damp on every one's ſpirits; and I myſelf could foreſee nothing but that we ſhould be torn to pieces by him, and longed for an opportunity to try our heels with him, while our maſts were ſtanding. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected every minute that he would board us, and, upon hearing a ſhouting amongſt them, and ſeeing their forecaſtle full of men, I concluded they had now come to that reſolution; but I preſently ſaw that the occaſion of this joy was their having ſhot down our enſign-ſtaff; upon which, they, ſeeing our enſign trailing in the water, were in hopes we had ſtruck: but I ſoon undeceived them, by ſpreading a new enſign in the mizzen-ſhrouds. Upon ſight of this they lay ſnug, and held their way cloſe upon our quarter; at laſt, deſigning to do our buſineſs at once, they clapped their helm well a ſtarboard, to bring their whole broadſide to point at us; but their fire had little or no effect. All ſtood faſt with us, and they muzzled themſelves; which gave me time both to get a-head, and to windward of him, before he could fill his ſails again; and now I found, that, if our maſts, which were by this time but ſlenderly ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would bear what ſail we had abroad, we ſhould ſoon ſteal away from him. After this he was in a great hurry to get his ſpritſail-yard
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0204000302:168"/>
fore and aft, threatening us very hard, and ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with his fore-chace: but we ſoon were out of his reach, and all hands were immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed in repairing our damages. This ſhip was called the Peregrine, of 56 guns, with upwards of 450 men on board of her.</p>
            <p>During this action, we had not a man killed or wounded, although the enemy often hulled us, and once, in particular, a ſhot coming into one of our ports, diſmounted one of our guns between decks, tearing off the nut of the gun, and breaking itſelf into a great many pieces, which flew fore and aft in the midſt of a crowd of people, without hurting any one of them. Our ſtern was alſo much ſhattered, and our rigging much diſabled. Our main maſt was a little wounded, yet ſtood a long while with only-one good ſhroud to ſupport it; our fore-maſt fared little better, yet I kept all the canvaſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the main-top-gallant-ſail, at hard bats end. An unlucky ſhot took the bow of our launch, as ſhe lay upon the quarter, and ſet fire to ſome cartridges of powder, which were negligently left in her, and which blew away her moorings, and we loſt her. Seeing a great ſmoke ariſe on the quarter, I at firſt imagined ſome accident had happened within board. In ſhort, in about three glaſſes we got quite clear of the Admiral, who tacked, and ſtood in for Payta, and we ſhortened ſail. A narrower eſcape from an enemy could not well have been made, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vaſt difference between us, as to force.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0204000302:169"/>
The Spaniard had 56 guns; we, on the contrary, had but 20 mounted: they had 450 men; we, on our part, did not exceed 73; and 11 negroes and two Indians were included in that number. He had farther this great odds over us, of being in a ſettled readineſs, whilſt we were in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt confuſion. As for our ſmall arms they were wet and uſeleſs to us; and, what is more, in the midſt of the engagement, one third of my people, inſtead of fighting, were hard at work, to make farther preparation for an obſtinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, if we had been puſhed to extremities; and particularly the carpenter and his crew were buſied in making ports for ſtern-chace-guns, which, as it happened, we made no uſe of. Upon the whole, we had the good fortune to eſcape this danger, which was the more to be dreaded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as we had ſet fire to the town, they were probably exaſperated upon the account of the churches, which I never intended to deſtroy; and, if I had fallen into their hands, they might have given us but uncomfortable quarters. At the beſt, however, it cannot but be allowed to have been a moſt unfortunate diſaſter. The loſs of my boat and anchor was irreparable, and may be ſaid to be the cauſe of that ſcene of trouble which will take up the remainder of this narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; for we had now but one anchor, that at Payta being the third we had loſt, and were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides entirely deſtitute of a boat of any kind.</p>
            <p>At five, the ſame evening, we ſaw a ſail under our lee-bow, which I took to be the prize we
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0204000302:170"/>
had left to cruiſe for us near the Saddle of Payta; and we, therefore, ſtood to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all night, and the next morning we ſaw two ſail a-ſtern of us. I tacked, and ſtood to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and in a little time could ſee that one of them was ſtanding in for Payta, while the other kept ſtemming with us; but the nearer I approached her, the leſs I liked her, and could not but think it adviſeable to put my ſhip about, and crowd ſail from her. However, ſhe gained upon us, and advanced near enough to ſhew us ſhe was the Brilliant, the Admiral's conſort. She was a French built ſhip, of 36 guns, manned with people of that nation, and other Europeans. She was handſomely rigged, which is rare to be ſeen in thoſe parts, and ſailed almoſt two foot for our one; ſo that, notwithſtanding we had almoſt a calm all the heat of the day, ſhe near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us apace. But, night coming on, I made uſe of the old ſtratagem (I thought it might be new here), of turning a light adrift in a half tub, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a boat, darkening one part of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, that it might the more appear to be a ſhip's light, and then immediately altered my courſe. As the day broke I hauled all my ſails, and in full day-light could perceive nothing of the enemy. This was the ſhip wherein Betagh, my late Captain of marines, was ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected; and by his advice it was, as I have been told, that the Admiral ordered his conſort to ply up to windward to Lobos, our firſt place of rendezvous, whilſt he himſelf came to Payta
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0204000302:171"/>
in ſearch of us. This ſeparation, though intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a ſure means to catch us, proved to be very fortunately the means of our preſervation.</p>
            <p>Being thus cloſely purſued, I took an offing of thirty leagues from the ſhore, and then brought to, to conſider what I had beſt to do. I was ſtill in the dark, as to my conſort; an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargo, as I was told at Payta, was laid on aft ſhipping to leeward for the term of ſix months; and our prize, which I deſigned to make a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of, was taken by the Brilliant; I had but one anchor, and no boat at all; and I was as yet ignorant of what had become of the Mercury.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of all this peril and perplexity, I called my officers together, to let them know, it was my opinion, we had, as we were thus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced, a much better proſpect to the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward than to the leeward; that on the coaſt of Chili we ſhould not be in the leaſt ſuſpected, and ſhould, at the ſame time, in the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner, eſcape the enemy's men-of-war; that, after taking in water at Juan Fernandez, we might cruiſe out the whole ſeaſon off the ports of Conception, Valparaiſo, and Coquimbo, where among the ſhipping we might be ſtocked with anchors, cables, boats, and a veſſel to make a fire-ſhip of, on which I mightily depended. All this being univerſally approved of, we got our tacks on board, and ſtretched away to windward.</p>
            <p>My intentions after this were fixed upon the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0204000302:172"/>
coaſt of Mexico. There I propoſed to run the height of Tres Marias and California, as the moſt likely places to meet with the Succeſs. Theſe two places would have been commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; the firſt for ſalting of turtle, and the laſt for wooding and watering at, and for laying my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the track of the Manilla ſhip, which, if I ſhould have had the fortune to meet with, and, having a fire-ſhip with me, I would have tried what I could have done with her.</p>
            <p>March 26, having well ſecured our maſt, and bent a new ſuit of ſails, we ſtood to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, expecting to gain our paſſage to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in about five weeks.</p>
            <p>March 31, as they were pumping the ſhip, the water which came out of the well, was not only in greater quantity than uſual, but was alſo as black as ink. This made me judge that ſome water had got to our powder; and accordingly going into the powder-room, we heard the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter come in like a little ſluice. This had quite ſpoiled the greateſt part of our powder; ſo that we only ſaved the quantity of ſix barrels. We found upon ſearch a leak to be on the bow, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lower cheek of the head, occaſioned by a ſhot which had been lodged there in our late en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and which falling out by the working of the ſhip in an head ſea, had left room for a ſtream of water; but we brought the ſhip by the ſtern, and, with great difficulty, ſtopped it ſecurely.</p>
            <p>May 11, we ſaw the great iſland of Juan
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0204000302:173"/>
Fernandez, bearing eaſt half ſouth. Here I plied on and off till the 21ſt, but could not get off as much water as we daily expended.</p>
            <p>May 21, a hard gale of wind came out of the ſea upon us, and brought in with it a tumbling ſwell; ſo that in a few hours, our cable, which was never wet before, parted, and inevitable ſhipwreck appeared before our eyes. But Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſo far interpoſed in our behalf, that, if we had ſtruck but a cable's length farther to the eaſtward or weſtward of the place where we did ſtrike, we muſt certainly all have periſhed. Our main-maſt, fore-maſt, and mizzen-top-maſt, went all away together; and happy it was for us that they did ſo; for, by making them ſerve by way of raft, and by the help of thoſe who were aſhore before the wind came on, we were all ſaved, except one man. In the midſt of this ſurprize, the firſt thing I took care of, was my commiſſion; and, remembering the powder to be uppermoſt in the bread-room, I got moſt of it up, with about ſeven or eight bags of bread: theſe we ſaved, as the ſhip did not come to pieces immediately. In a few minutes, however, after ſhe firſt ſtruck, ſhe was full of water. We ſaved, notwithſtanding, two or three compaſſes, ſome of our mathematical inſtruments, and books.</p>
            <p>When we firſt got on ſhore, we were without any one thing neceſſary for our relief; not ſo much as a ſeat whereon to reſt our harraſſed limbs, except the wet ground, which, as far as
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0204000302:174"/>
we could ſee, was alſo like to be our bed and pillow, and indeed it proved to be ſo.</p>
            <p>In the evening, all the officers came to conſult with me, how we ſhould get ſome neceſſaries out of the wreck; and, having by this time lighted a fire, we wrapt ourſelves in what we could get, laid ourſelves round it, and, notwithſtanding the badneſs of the weather, we ſlept very ſoundly; but, the next morning, getting up with the firſt glimpſe of day-light, we looked at each other like men awakened out of a dream; ſo great and ſo ſudden was the melancholy change in our condition, that we could ſcarce truſt to our ſenſes.</p>
            <p>I went immediately among the people to ſet them about the work we had reſolved upon the night before; but they were ſo ſcattered, there was no getting them together, or we might, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, have regained all our beef and pork. This opportunity, however, was loſt, by their eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to build huts and tents, in order to ſettle themſelves for good; for, while they were thus employed, a furious gale of wind came on, which deſtroyed all the proviſions in the ſhip, except one caſk of beef, and one of farina de pao, which were waſhed whole on the ſtrand. I had ſaved 1100 dollars belonging to the gentlemen adventurers, which were kept in my cheſt in the great cabbin; the reſt, being in the bottom of the bread-room for ſecurity, could not poſſibly be come at. I need not ſay how diſconſolate my reflections were on the ſad accident that had
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0204000302:175"/>
happened. My firſt thoughts were on the means whereby to preſerve our lives, and on ſome ſcheme of oeconomy to be obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people, in relation to the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch quantities of proviſions as ſhould from time to time be obtained.</p>
            <p>I found a very commodious ſpot of ground about half a mile from the ſea, on which I ſet up my tent. There was a fine run of water within a ſtone's caſt of it on each ſide, with fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near at hand, and trees proper for our uſe. The people ſettled within call about me, in as good a manner as they could: and having all ſecured ourſelves againſt the inclemency of the weather, we uſed to paſs our time in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round a great fire, roaſting craw-fiſh in the embers.</p>
            <p>I now began to think of building ſuch a veſſel from the wreck as might carry us all off at once from this iſland; and for that purpoſe conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the carpenter; but was aſtoniſhed at his anſwer, <q rend="inline">'he could not make brick, he ſaid, without ſtraw,'</q> and walked away from me in a ſurly humour. From him I went to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourer, and aſked him what he could do to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards building a ſmall veſſel for us; to which he anſwered, that he hoped he could do all the iron work; that he had, with much labour, got his beſtows out of the wreck, and that he did not doubt but we ſhould find a great many other uſeful things, when we came to ſet about a ſearch for them in good earneſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0204000302:176"/>June 8, we laid the blocks, and got the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprit ready to make a keel. The carpenter for a little while went on with ſeeming good temper, but ſuddenly turning ſhort upon me as I ſtood by him, he ſwore a great oath, he would not ſtrike another ſtroke, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'he truly would be no body's ſlave, and thought himſelf now upon a footing with myſelf.'</q> This provoked me to uſe him a little roughly with my cane; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards came to an agreement with him to give him a four-piſtole piece as ſoon as the ſtem and ſtern-poſt were up, and 100 pieces of eight when the bark was finiſhed. He then went to work on the keel, and in two months time we made a tolerable ſhow, owing to the diligence and ingenuity of Poppleſtone, the armourer, who made us hammers, chiſſels, files, gimlets, bullet-moulds, and an inſtrument to bore our cartouch boxes. Theſe laſt we covered with ſeals ſkins, and contrived them ſo as to be both handy and neat. He, beſides all this, began and finiſhed with his own hands, a large ſerviceable boat, which was what we very much ſtood in need of.</p>
            <p>For a few days the people behaved themſelves very regularly and diligently, half of them work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day, and half another. But the time ſoon arrived when we fell into ſuch confuſion and outrageous diſorder, that it was a miracle we ever got off from this place by any aſſiſtance of our own; for, one afternoon, I miſſed all the people, and could ſee no body but Mr. Adams,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0204000302:177"/>
our ſurgeon, Mr. Hendry the agent, my ſon, and Mr. Dodd, lieutenant of marines, who, for ſome reaſons beſt known to himſelf, had a mind to act the madman. At night I was informed, they had aſſembled together at a great tree, had formed a new regulation and new articles, had excluded the gentlemen adventurers in England from having any part of what we ſhould take for the future, and had diveſted me of the authority of their Captain, having regulated themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſcipline of Jamaica. They had choſen Morphew to be their champion and ſpeaker. This man addreſſed himſelf to me, and told me, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'that, as the Speedwell was caſt away, they were now of conſequence at their own diſpoſal, ſo that their obligations to the owners and me were of no validity, the ſhip being now no more; they therefore, he ſaid, had now thought fit to frame ſuch articles as would be moſt conducive to their own intereſt; and, if I would ſign them, well; if not, they would not truſt themſelves under my conduct, as they ſhould always be apprehenſive that I ſhould ſerve them as Clipperton had ſerved ſome of his men, who (they heard) happening to be taken ſeparately, he denied them, and ſuffered eight of them to be hanged as pirates before his race.'</q>

            <p>In theſe articles, beſides caſting off the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I found myſelf reduced from ſixty ſhares to ſix. I was at a loſs what to do in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma; but at laſt I found myſelf under an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible

neceſſity of ſigning the articles, in order to get off from the iſland, where otherwiſe I might have been forcibly left behind.</p>
            <p>And now, having very unwillingly ſatisfied them in all I thought they could aſk, I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them the veſſel we had begun, not doubting, but after this they would have uſed their conſtant endeavours to fin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſh her, that they might have an opportunity of putting their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in execution; and they ſaid they would.</p>
            <p>But early the next morning, going down to the beach as uſual, and expecting to find every one employed, I ſaw none of them, except the carpenter, and two or three more; for, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were abettors of the deſigns that were carrying on, yet the hopes of a little money from me had made them work pretty diligently, though I cannot ſay they fatigued themſelves. Upon enquiry, I was informed, that the reſt of the people were again adjourned to the great tree; and it was not long before I was made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the reſult of their meeting; for, betimes the next morning, they ſurrounded my tent, while Morphew, and Stewart, their agent, came in to me, and told me. They came in the name of all the people to demand every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the gentlemen adventurers out of my poſſeſſion, and particularly 750 weight in Pinna or virgin ſilver, a ſilver diſh weighing 75 ounces, and 250 dollars in money, I did not eaſily part with all this: but they deſired I would make no diſpute; for, as all this came out of the wreck,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0204000302:179"/>
they inſiſted, the owners could have nothing to do with it, and they were determined to have it. In ſhort, I was obliged to give it all up, and they ſhared it amongſt them that very moment, according to their new regulation.</p>
            <p>After this, they entirely deſtroyed what little power they had allowed me over them; and the meaneſt of them were taught they were as good as I. They ſometimes denied me a quota of the fiſh, and wondered I could not go out to catch it as well as they; at beſt, they would give my ſervant who uſed to fetch it but the leavings, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had choſen the prime: and, to complete their inſults, my firſt lieutenant, who uſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to eat with me, entirely deſerted my meſs to join Morphew, to partake of his better fare.</p>
            <p>Quite tired out with their inceſſant mutinies, I became at length ſo deſperate, that I began to think of preferring the dangers of the ſea, in a ſmall open boat, to what I thought myſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to on this place from my ſhip's company. I apprehended, they would never reſt till they had made themſelves entirely their own maſters, by privately making away with me; and this made me melancholy and penſive, preparing myſelf for the worſt that could happen. They perceiving this change in me, grew ſuſpicious that I was now contriving ſome means to reduce them; and, therefore, they determined to get the arms out of my poſſeſſion. To this purpoſe they all came in a body, headed by Brooks and Morphew, who, in the preſence of all the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0204000302:180"/>
people, uſed me with inſupportable impudence; and even went ſo far as to threaten the life of my ſon, for only telling Morphew, that every one preſent had not choſen him for his ſpeaker.</p>
            <p>Having gained that point alſo, they had the pleaſure of ſquandering away their time, and powder and ſhot, in firing at cats, or any thing elſe, to waſte the ammunition.</p>
            <p>What I hare now related, is the ſubſtance of what occurred from May 24 till Auguſt 15, when we had ſight of a large ſhip, which put us into a great hurry, and gave us a conſiderable alarm. Before ſhe croſſed the bay, I ordered all the fires to be put out, and confined the negroes and Indians, leſt the ſhip ſhould be becalmed under the land, and any of them ſhould attempt to ſwim off to her. However, I was not long in fear, for ſhe kept away large, and at too great a diſtance to perceive any thing diſtinctly of us.</p>
            <p>On this occaſion I got moſt of the people under arms, and was glad to ſee ſo many of them, in ſome meaſure, obedient to command. I told them, I was pleaſed to ſee their arms in ſuch good order; to which they anſwered im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently, that it was for their own ſakes. But this alarm was ſcarce ſubſided before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came divided among themſelves. The queſtion ſtarted was, whether or no the bark ſhould be carried on, or, whether they ſhould not build two large ſhallops, and ſet what was done of the bark on fire. The workmen, and a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble majority of the reſt, ſided with me in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0204000302:181"/>
half of the bark: but at night the carpenter ſent me word, that, if I did not deliver him the money agreed on at the beginning, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the terms of the payment of it were not yet fulfilled, I ſhould not ſee his face again; ſo I was obliged to treat this gentleman as he pleaſed to have me, and raiſe the money for him.</p>
            <p>To complete the number of our diviſions and diſſentions, there aroſe a third party, who were reſolved to have nothing to do with the other two, they purpoſing to ſtay on the iſland. Theſe were to the number of 12, who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſeparated themſelves from the reſt, and never appeared amongſt us, except in the night, when they uſed to come about our tents, and the bark we were building, to ſteal powder, lead, and axes, and in ſhort, whatever elſe they could lay their hands on. Theſe, however, I found means to manage, and took from them all their arms, ammunition, and the reſt of their plunder, and threatened, that, if they were found within muſquet-ſhot of our tents, they ſhould be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as enemies.</p>
            <p>In a little time theſe diviſions had ſo far weakened the whole body, that, by degrees, they began to liſten a little to what I ſaid to them; and I prevailed ſo far as to get moſt of them into a working humour. Mr. Brooks now came with a feigned ſubmiſſion, and deſired he might eat with me again; but this, in the main, abated nothing of his eſteem for Morphew. His diſſimulation, however, proved of ſignal ſervice,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0204000302:182"/>
as it contributed to the ſpeedy finiſhing of the bark. This claimed the aſſiſtance of all our heads and hands; for when we came to plank her bottom, we had moſt diſheartening difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to encounter; for, having no plank but pieces of the wreck's deck, we found it ſo dry and ſtubborn, that fire and water had ſcarce any effect in making it pliable and fit for uſe. It rent and ſplit, and flew like glaſs; ſo that now I had ſufficient reaſons to believe, after all our labour, that we muſt patiently wait to be taken off from hence by ſome Spaniſh ſhip, and, after all our troubles, be led to a priſon, to reflect on our misfortunes paſt. However, by conſtant labour, and a variety of contrivances, we, in the end, patched our bark up in ſuch a manner, that I dare ſay the like was never ſeen, and I may venture to affirm, that ſuch a bottom never ſwam on the ſurface of the ſea before.</p>
            <p>Sept. 9, the boat, which I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to be begun by the armourer, was launch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, being now in a fair way of compleating our bark, there yet remained, unconſidered and undetermined, what proviſions we ſhould get to ſupport us in our preſent voyage. All the ſtock we had conſiſted of but one caſk of beef, five or ſix buſhels of farina or Caſſader flour, together with four or five live hogs.</p>
            <p>I made ſeveral experiments to cure both fiſh and ſeal, but found it impoſſible. At length, we luckily thought on a method of curing the conger-eel, by ſplitting it, and taking out the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0204000302:183"/>
back-bone, then dipping it in ſalt-water, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards hanging it up to dry in a great ſmoke. As no other fiſh could be preſerved after this manner, the fiſhermen were ordered to catch what congers they could. And now ſeveral of the people, who had not yet ſtruck a ſtroke, began to repent of their folly, as they grew weary of living on this place, and offered their ſervice to go a fiſhing, every one making ſome fooliſh excuſe or other, for having been ſo long idle. The new boat being ſent to try her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, returned at night, and brought in a great parcel of fiſh of ſeveral ſorts, amongſt which were 200 conger-eels. This was a good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and every tent took a proportion of them to cure.</p>
            <p>Having this conveniency of a large boat, I deſired Mr. Brooks, our only diver, to try what he could recover from that part of the wreck which lay under water. He accordingly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took it, and could find but one ſmall gun, which he weighed and brought on ſhore, together with two pieces of a large church candleſtick, which was a part of the plate which belonged to the gentlemen adventurers.</p>
            <p>Our boat was now daily employed in fiſhing. The armourer conſtantly ſupplied them with hooks, and there was no want of lines, which were made of twiſted ribbon. In the mean time, thoſe who were aſhore, made twice layed ſtuff for rigging and other uſes. We patched up the canvas for ſails; the cooper completed
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0204000302:184"/>
his caſks; and, in a ſhort time, we had maſts an-end tolerably well rigged, and thought we made a comfortable figure.</p>
            <p>And now, having done all we could, when we came to put in water, to try the tightneſs of our work, it was followed by an univerſal outcry, <hi>A ſieve! a ſieve!</hi> I was afraid the people would have deſpaired, and deſiſted from uſing any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means: but, in a little time, and by inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant labour, we repaired the ſhip's pumps, and fitted them to our bark. The next ſpring-tide we found means to launch her, which fell out on the 5th of October, by which time we had ſaved about 2300 conger-eels, weighing, one with another, about one pound each, and made about 60 gallons of ſeals oil to fry them in. This, with what I mentioned before, was all our ſea-ſtock. As ſhe went off the blocks, I named her the <hi>Recovery,</hi> though I was ſadly afraid of hearing ill news from thoſe afloat in her; but all proved indifferently well; and, knowing it to be dangerous for her to lie here long, eſpecially having no other anchor than a great ſtone, and a ſlight rope to hold her with, and that the leaſt puff of wind might have driven and deſtroyed her upon the rocks, we got all the water off that day, which we did ſo much eaſier and quicker, becauſe the caſks were ready ſtowed in the hold. She had two maſts, and was of about the burthen of twenty tons; and, to my great ſatisfaction, I found, that one pump, conſtantly working, kept her free. The next day, October the 6th, we
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0204000302:185"/>
got every one on board and embarked, leaving behind us eleven or twelve of thoſe who had deſerted us. They were deaf to all perſuaſions; and, in ſhort, ſent me word, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'They were not yet prepared for the other world;'</q> ſo they, with the like number of blacks and Indians, remained behind on the iſland.</p>
            <p>This iſland enjoys a fine wholeſome air, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that, out of 70 of us that were on it for the ſpace of five months and eleven days, not one of us had an hour's ſickneſs, notwithſtanding we fed on foul diet, without bread or ſalt. For my own part, I muſt acknowledge the bounty of Providence; for, although I loſt much of my fleſh, I became one of the ſtrongeſt and moſt active men on the iſland, from being before very corpulent, and almoſt crippled with the gout. On the tops of ſome of the mountains of this iſland, are plains covered with groves of the Italian laurel. Palm-trees are likewiſe found in moſt parts, growing in ſmooth joints like a cane, ſome 30, ſome 40 feet high. What ſeamen call palm-cabbage is the very ſubſtance of the head of this tree, which being cut off, you find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed a white and tender young cabbage: but, for every one we got, we were obliged to cut down a fine lofty tree.</p>
            <p>The northern part of this iſland is very well watered, and the water keeps well at ſea, and is, I dare ſay, as good as any in the world. Down the weſtern peak deſcend two caſcades, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, at leaſt 300 feet perpendicular; which,

            <p>We might have found goats enough in the mountains, if we had been able to follow them; and cats are ſo numerous, that there is hardly taking a ſtep without ſtarting one. Thoſe whoſe ſtomachs could bear their fleſh for food, found a more ſubſtantial relief from hunger by one meal of it, than from four or five of fiſh.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards, who firſt ſtocked this iſland with goats, have ſince endeavoured to deſtroy theſe goats by dogs, which are likewiſe very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous; but the goats have many inacceſſible places of refuge, where no dogs can follow them; and they ſtill continue to afford a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſupply to ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>While we were here, it was the ſeaſon for the ſea-lioneſſes to come to land, to bring forth their young. Theſe have bodies of a monſtrous bulk, being from 10 to 12 feet long, and near as much in circumference. I may venture to affirm, that, one with another, they would yield each a butt of train oil. They are ſo indolent, that, as ſoon as they have gained the land, they fall aſleep, and in that condition remain a month together ſo torpid, that you might fire a piſtol at their heads without diſturbing them; but where the ſea-lioneſſes lie, as they do in companies after they have yeaned, to give ſuck to their young, there is always an old lion, of the largeſt ſize, inceſſantly on the watch, and at the approach of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0204000302:188"/>
an enemy makes a hideous roaring, threatening death to him who ſhould be ſo hardy as to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt his charge; and, in truth, were they not ſo unweildy, they would be a deſperate creature to encounter. We were accuſtomed to walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them without dread; for all, but thoſe who were to take care of the young, were loſt in the profoundeſt ſlumbers. On the land they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender, and bring forth their young, who ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alſo before they go off, againſt the next ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſo quick and ſuddenly do they increaſe and propagate.</p>
            <p>The ſeals here may properly be called ſea-wolves, from the reſemblance of their heads to the heads of wolves, differing in that particular from the ſeals in the northern hemiſphere, where their heads are more like the dog's. They are naturally ſurly, and ſnarl in an angry manner, on the approach of any body. Two fins compoſe their tails, and with the help of theſe they get along much faſter than the lions.</p>
            <p>Every thing one ſees or hears in this iſland is different from what is elſewhere to be found. The very ſtructure of the iſland, in all its parts, appears with a certain ſavage, irregular beauty, nor eaſy to be expreſſed. The ſeveral proſpects of lofty inacceſſible hills in the day, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſs of the gloomy narrow vallies in the night, added to the mixed, confuſed noiſe of the ſurge continually beating againſt the ſhore, the tumbling of the waters from an immenſe precipice, the roaring of ſea lions and ſea-wolves,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0204000302:189"/>
whoſe voices are more or leſs ſhrill or hoarſe according to their youth or age, compoſe ſo wild and horrible a medley, that the ſtouteſt man muſt long be accuſtomed to it, before he can taſte the ſweets of refreſhing ſleep, or wholly diveſt himſelf of terror.</p>
            <p>October 6, we ſet ſail, with nothing to ſubſiſt on at ſea but the before-mentioned ſmoked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, one caſk of beef, and four live hogs, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with three or four buſhels of farina. We were upwards of forty of us crowded together, and lying upon bundles of eels, with no conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of keeping the men clean, nor any thing to defend us from their abominable ſtench; not a drop of water to be had without ſucking it out of the caſk through a pipe, which being uſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, became intolerably nauſeous. The unſavoury morſels we daily ate created perpetual quarrels amongſt us, every one contending for the frying-pan. All the conveniency we had for firing, was an half tub filled with earth, which made our cooking ſo tedious, that we had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual noiſe of frying from morning till night.</p>
            <p>Thus we traverſed the ocean: happy, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in the thought of being once more afloat, and cheriſhing the hope that ſomething would ſpeedily fall into our hands. Every day, while the ſea-breeze continued, we were hard put to it, for not having above 16 inches free board, and our bark tumbling prodigiouſly, the water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ran over us; and, having only a grating
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0204000302:190"/>
deck, and no tarpaulin to cover it, our pumps would but juſt keep us free.</p>
            <p>October 10, being the fourth day of our new expedition, we fell in with a large ſhip, which I could plainly ſee was Europe built. This ſtruck me with the dread of her being a man-of-war; however, our caſe being deſperate, I ſtood for her, and, before we could get quite up with her, the enemy diſcovered the brownneſs of our can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas, and, ſuſpecting us, wore ſhip, and hauled cloſe on a wind to the weſtward. This done, they hoiſted their colours, fired a gun, and crouded away from us at a great rate; but, in about two hours it fell calm, and we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to our oars. In the mean time we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauled our arms, which we found to be in very bad condition, one-third of them being without flints, and we had but three cutlaſſes; ſo that we were but ill prepared for boarding, which was the only means we could have of taking any ſhip. We had but one ſmall cannon, which we could not mount, and therefore were obliged to fire it as it lay along upon the deck; and to ſupply it we had no more ammunition than two round ſhot, a few chain-bolts and bolt-heads, the clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Speedwell's bell, and ſome bags of beach-ſtones to ſerve for partridge. In about four hours we came up with this ſhip, and every one ſeemed as eaſy in his mind as if actually in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of her. But, as we advanced nearer, I ſaw her guns and patararoes, and a conſiderable number of men upon deck, with their arms glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0204000302:191"/>
in the ſun, who called out to us by the name of Engliſh dogs, defying us, in a ſcornful way, to come on board of them, and at the ſame time gave us a volley of great and ſmall ſhot, which killed our gunner, and almoſt brought our fore-maſt by the board. This warm recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtaggered a great many of my men who before ſeemed the forwardeſt, inſomuch that they lay upon their oars for ſome time, in ſpite of all I could do to make them keep their way. We recovered ourſelves again, and rowed cloſe up with the enemy, and engaged them till all our ſmall ſhot was expended, which obliged us to fall aſtern to make ſome ſlugs. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we made three attempts, but with no better ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>All the night it was calm, and we were buſied in making ſlugs, and had provided a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity by the next morning, when we came to a final determination of either carrying the ſhip, or of ſubmitting to her; and accordingly, at day-break, I ordered twenty men in our yaul, to lay her athwart the hawſe, whilſt I boarded her in the bark. The people in the boat put off, giving me repeated aſſurances of their good behaviour; but, at the very juncture we were coming to action, a gale ſprang up, and ſhe went away from us.</p>
            <p>This ſhip was called the Margarita, and was the ſame which had been a privateer belonging to St. Malo's, and mounted forty guns, all the laſt war. In the ſkirmiſhes we had with her,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0204000302:192"/>
we had none killed, except Gilbert Henderſon, our gunner; and only three were wounded, viz. Mr. Brooks, Firſt Lieutenant, through the thigh, Mr. Coldſea, the Maſter, through the groin, and one of the fore-maſt-men through the ſmall of his back. Two of theſe did very well, and I think there was ſomething extraordinary in their cure; for the ſurgeon had nothing to apply to their wounds, but what he himſelf had prepared with ſeals-oil, and other matters he had found on the iſland. Mr. Coldſea, indeed, lingered in a miſerable manner for nine or ten months; but at length recovered.</p>
            <p>Our condition now grew worſe and worſe; for ſoon after we had parted from this ſhip, a bard gale came on, which laſted four days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing, during all which time we had not an hour's hope of living a minute. We were obliged to ſcud away under bare poles, with our yaul in tow; and, having but a ſhort ſcope of boat-rope, we were, on the deſcent of every ſea, in the greateſt danger of having the bark's ſtern beat in by the violence of the boat's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate fail after us; and, once in particular, a great hollow ſea had like to have thrown her upon our deck, which would have put an end to our voyage immediately. The exceſſive fright of this ſtorm made many of our people form a reſolution of going on ſhore the very firſt opportunity.</p>
            <p>In this extremity, calling to mind M. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier's account of Iquique, I mentioned the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0204000302:193"/>
of that place to the crew, which being univerſally approved of, we directed our courſe to that iſland.</p>
            <p>It was three weeks before we got this length; and having nothing to ride the bark with, we were obliged to keep the ſea with her, whilſt the boat went in between the rocks, and was received by ſome Indians on the ſtrand with a ſort of welcome. The men, being landed, went to the Lieutenant's houſe, broke it open, and rummaged the whole village, where they found a booty more valuable to us at that time than gold and ſilver. It conſiſted of about ſixty buſhels of wheat-flour, 120 of Calavances and corn, ſome jerked beef, pork and mutton, ſome thouſand weight of well-cured fiſh, a good number of fowls, ſome ruſk, and four or five days eating of ſoft bread, together with five or ſix jars of Peruvian wine and brandy; and, to crown all, they had the good fortune to find a large boat near the ſhore, to bring off the booty with, which otherwiſe would have been of little uſe to us, our own boat being already ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently laden with the men.</p>
            <p>Words cannot expreſs the joy that reigned among us when they came on board: the ſcene was now changed from famine to plenty; the loaves of ſoft bread were diſtributed to every one, and the jars of wine were broached; but I took care they ſhould drink but moderately of it, each man having no more than half a pint to his ſhare: and, after a day or two's
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0204000302:194"/>
living on wholeſome diet, we wondered how our ſtomachs had been able to digeſt our rank and nauſeous eels fried in train oil, and could ſcarcely believe we had lived upon nothing elſe for a month paſt.</p>
            <p>Mr. Randall, our Second Lieutenant, who commanded in this enterprize, told me, they did not meet with the leaſt oppoſition, and that the few Indians they found ſeemed to be as glad of this opportunity of pillaging the Spaniards as we were.</p>
            <p>The ſettlement at Iquique conſiſts of about 60 ſcattered ill-built houſes, which hardly deſerve that name, and a ſmall church. There is not the leaſt verdure to be ſeen in or about it, nor does it afford the leaſt neceſſary of life, of its own product, not even water, which they are obliged to fetch in boats from Piſagua, ten leagues to the northward.</p>
            <p>By two Indian priſoners we took here, we were informed, that the Lieutenant's boat was then at Piſagua, and that it would not be long before her return; however, being determined to make ſome attempt in the road of le Naſco, in lat 16 deg. S. and at Piſco, in lat. 13 deg. 45 min. S. we ſet ſail, and the very morning we came off the Sierra or high-land of le Naſco, two hours before day-light, we fell in with a large ſhip. The circumſtances of our meeting and engaging her were, in ſome meaſure, the ſame with thoſe we had with the Margarita. We met with both at the ſame time in the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0204000302:195"/>
morning, and, whilſt in purſuit of both, had the misfortune of being becalmed. We ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with this laſt for ſix or ſeven hours, and were at length obliged to leave her, becauſe the ſea-breeze came in ſo ſtrong, and the ſea ran ſo high, that, had ſhe been of no force, our ſlight bark muſt have been in pieces before a third part of us could have entered her. This ſhip was called the St. Franciſco Palacio<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of 700 tons, eight guns and ten pete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aroes, and was well manned and provided with ſmall arms.</p>
            <p>It happened very unfortunately, that we ſhould thus miſs two of the beſt equipped ſhips in the private trade at that time in the South Seas. This laſt repulſe was made a pretence for much murmuring; many, deſpairing of ever being able to take any thing as our condition was, were for ſurrendering to the enemy, who was all the night becalmed near us. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their deſign, I took care to remove the two boats out of their power, by ordering two men in each of them, ſuch as I thought I could truſt, and to caſt off from us at a little diſtance, that none might eſcape in them. But, notwithſtanding the confidence I had in theſe four, the two in the beſt boat ran away with her; and the next day I was informed, that the Firſt Lieutenant and Morphew had made a party, too ſtrong for me to oppoſe, to go away with the boat that was left; but, it blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freſh the next night, they were prevented from executing their deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0204000302:196"/>The next day we ſtood into the road of Piſco, as we had deſigned, where we diſcovered what appeared to be a large ſhip. We bore down to her with a reſolute deſpair, and laid her athwart the hawſe; but, to our great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, we met with no reſiſtance, and were received by the Captain and his Officers with their hats off, in the moſt ſubmiſſive manner aſking for quarter. Before we came up, I had ordered our boat to intercept theirs, which was going on ſhore. They clapped her on board, but, not holding faſt, they fell aſtern, and could not fetch up with her again; ſo that in this boat was conveyed away every thing that might have been valuable in the prize. She was a good ſhip, of about 200 tons, called the Jeſus-Maria, almoſt laden with pitch, tar, copper, and plank, but nothing elſe. The Captain offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 1600 dollars for her ranſom, but I could not give ear to it in the condition which I was then in.</p>
            <p>The Spaniſh Captain informed me, that the Margarita had been arrived ſome time at Callao, where ſhe had given a full account of us; that the Captain of her, and three more, were killed in the action with us, and that the Prieſt and ſeveral others were wounded; and that ſhe was now ready to put to ſea again, with an addition of ten guns and fifty men; to cruiſe for us: and, moreover, that the Flying fiſh, a frigate of 28 guns, was already out with the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Upon this advice, having cleared our
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0204000302:197"/>
bark, we gave her to the Spaniſh Captain, and as ſoon as the breeze ſprang up, we weighed, and went to ſea, and in going out met with our boat, which I have mentioned to have left us in the night; they edged towards us, imagining we were Spaniards, by which means we got them again. The two fellows in her were almoſt dead, having ate or drank nothing for three days, and had juſt been aſhore on a ſmall iſland, to kill ſeals to drink their blood. They had no excuſe for themſelves, but that they fell aſleep, and the faint breezes of the night had wafted us in the bark away from them.</p>
            <p>Piſco being 40 leagues to the windward of Callao, I kept cloſe hauled till I had gained a two degrees offing, and kept that diſtance till we had got well to the northward of Callao, and hauled in again for the land, a little to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Truxillo, and looked into the roads of Guanchaco, Malabriga, and Cheripe; but, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſhip at thoſe places, I paſſed between the iſland of Lobos de Tierra and the continent; and, Nov. 25, found ourſelves near the Saddle of Payta, where having made ſome priſoners, I examined them concerning the condition of the town, which they anſwered was very poor at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, there being neither money nor proviſions in it, and ſhewed me a ſmall bark on the ſhore, which Captain Clipperton had ſent in here a little while before with ſome of his priſoners, which had given them ſuch an alarm, that every thing had been again removed into the country. This
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0204000302:198"/>
unwelcome news did not hinder us from keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on our way, with our Spaniſh colours flying, till we came to the place of anchorage.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was our anchor down than I ſent away Mr. Brooks, with both the boats, armed with 24 men; no more of them, however, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared than thoſe who rowed, and two or three ſitters in each, the reſt, with their arms, lying in the bottom of the boat. Thus they advanced towards the town, without giving the leaſt um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage to the inhabitants, who were ſo thoroughly perſuaded of our being Spaniards, that, when the people landed, they found the children playing on the beach, who were the firſt that took the alarm, and ran away at the ſight of armed men. In an inſtant the whole place was in confuſion; the town was deſerted, and nothing left in it but a few bales of coarſe cloth, about 500 of dried tole or dog-fiſh, two or three pedlars packs, and an inconſiderable quantity of bread and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats; ſo that we unluckily had but little em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for our boats.</p>
            <p>As we lay at an anchor in the ſhip, we took a boat with about fifty jars of Peruvian wine and brandy, the maſter of which told us, he was come by ſtealth from Callao, there being orders that none but ſhips of ſome force ſhould ſtir out. This man was the firſt who acquainted me with Captain Hatley's being taken, and the value of his prizes; and likewiſe aſſured me, that, if Captain Clipperton had landed the firſt time he was here, there were 400,000 pieces of eight in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0204000302:199"/>
it, beſides a great quantity of jeſuits bark, and other valuable commodities, of all which he might eaſily have made himſelf maſter; but he wanted courage. Some of the King of Spain's treaſure is frequently lodged under the Governor's care; and, if he had made an attempt, even the ſecond time, it would have been worth his while. As for Collan, which is two miles to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of this, ſituated near the mouth of a little river, it is a mean place, being entirely inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Indians.</p>
            <p>From this place we directed our courſe for the iſland of Gorgona, in the bay of Panama, and in our paſſage thither built a tank, or wooden ciſtern, big enough to hold 10 tons of water, wherewith to ſupply our want of caſks, as without the help of ſome ſuch contrivance we ſhould have but little hopes of being ever able to return home. In our way we made the iſland of Plate, Cape St. Francis, and Gorgonella; and on Dec. 2, we came to anchor to the leeward of the northernmoſt point of Gorgona, within leſs than a quarter of a mile of the ſhore. Here we had the advantage of filling our water-caſks in the boat, the water running in ſmall ſtreams into the ſea, and cut down our wood at high water mark; ſo that in leſs than 48 hours we had done our buſineſs here, and hurried away to ſea, for fear of thoſe who might be in queſt of us.</p>
            <p>Having got out of the track of the enemies ſhips, we conſulted on the beſt methods of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, when the majority were for going di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0204000302:200"/>
over to the coaſts of Aſia. Upon this we changed our ſhip's name from the Jeſus Maria to the Happy Return, and applied all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours towards abandoning theſe coaſts; but the winds and currents were averſe to it; and ſome of thoſe who oppoſed our departure, did ſo much damage clandeſtinely to our tank, that the greateſt part of our water leaked out. This, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with continual contrary winds and dead calms, which detained us till our proviſions were much exhauſted, rendered us incapable to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſo long a run; and therefore, to furniſh ourſelves with what we wanted, I propoſed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent on the iſland of Quibo, in lat. 7 deg. 40 min. N. where, by Captain Rogers's account, I gueſſed there muſt be inhabitants who lived in a plentiful manner on the product of the country.</p>
            <p>On January 13, 1721, we anchored between Quibo and the iſle of Quivetta, in a ſandy bay, commodious for wooding and watering. The morning after our arrival, we ſaw two large pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raguas rowing in for the iſle of Quivetta, one of them with Spaniſh colours flying; and, after a little debate, whether it would be prudent for us to attack them in our boat or not, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, at all hazards, to go after them in our yaul. This enterprize was commanded by Mr. Brooks, our Firſt Lieutenant, who found the men on ſhore, brought away their piraguas, and two priſoners, the one a Mulatto, and the other a Negro; the reſt ſought for refuge in the woods. The Mulatto mortified us very much, by telling
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0204000302:201"/>
us, that a veſſel laden with proviſions had paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by very near us in the night; but, to make amends, promiſed to conduct us to a place where we might ſupply ourſelves without any hazard, provided we were not above two or three days about it. No news could be more welcome to us than this, wherefore we were very briſk in getting off our wood and water; and, on Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary the 19th, we got ſafe in between Mariato and the iſland of Sebaco, and anchored in ſix fathom water, over againſt a green field, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſufficient, there being but that clear ſpot hereabouts. Our guide deſired we might be going at leaſt three hours before day-light, and that then we ſhould be in good time at the plantations. Accordingly I embarked at two the next morning in our own boat, and ordered the two lieutenants in the two piraguas, leaving my ſon and a few men with him, to take care of the ſhip. Our guide carried us up ſome part of the river St. Martin, and out of that into ſeveral branches of very narrow creeks amongſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groves, where we had not room to row, which made me ſuſpect he had no good deſign in his head; but we landed juſt at day-break on a fine ſavannah, or plain; and, after a march of about three miles, came to two farm-houſes, whoſe owners had made their eſcape, except the wife and children of one houſe.</p>
            <p>The place anſwered the man's deſcription, being ſurrounded by numerous herds of black cattle, hogs, and plenty of fowls of all ſorts;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0204000302:202"/>
and here we found ſome dried beef, plantains, and Indian corn; and, for preſent uſe, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with a wholſome breakfaſt of hot cake and milk, a diet we had been long unacquainted with When it came to be broad day, I ſaw our ſhip cloſe by us, upon which I aſked our Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latto, How he came to bring us ſo far about? He anſwered, There was a river between us, and he did not know whether it was fordable or not. I therefore ſent ſome to try, who found it was not above knee deep. Wherefore, to avoid the trouble of carrying our plunder ſo far as we had been led, I ordered our boats to row out of the river St. Martin, and to come to the beach over againſt the ſhip. We had not been long here before the maſter of the family we were with, being anxious for their ſafety, returned, and made an offer of as many of his black cattle as we ſhould think ſit to require; which offer we kindly received: and he brought us the number we thought we could ſave; for, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but little ſalt, and not being able to ſpare water to keep them alive when at ſea, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were moderate; and the few we requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as ſoon as they were carried on board, were k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>ed. Their fleſh we preſerved by cutting it into long ſlips of the thickneſs of a finger, and then ſprinkling it with ſo ſmall a quantity of ſalt, that we did not uſe above four or five pounds to a hundred weight; then letting it he together two or three hours, we hung it up to dry in the ſun, which perfectly cured it, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0204000302:203"/>
that better than it could have been done by any other way.</p>
            <p>Having done all we propoſed in coming here, we departed with our decks full of fowls and hogs, amongſt which there was one with its navel, or ſomething like it, on its back. The Spaniards ſay, that this, when wild in the woods, is a terrible animal to meet with, although at full growth it be but ſmall.</p>
            <p>January 25, we made a ſail about two leagues to the leeward of us: we gave her chace till we found ſhe was of European ſtructure; and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe might be one of the enemy's ſhips of war, I clapped on a wind, and in half an hour's time it fell calm. Soon after, we ſaw a boat rowing towards us, which proved to be the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs's pinnace, commanded by Mr. Davidſon, their Firſt Lieutenant. My firſt interview with him was attended by an aſtoniſhment equal on both ſides; he could hardly believe that he ſaw us in ſo mean and forlorn a condition; and I could ſcarce believe that the Succeſs (if in being) had been all this while wandering up and down theſe ſeas.</p>
            <p>I entertained him with a rehearſal of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant run of misfortunes which had befallen us in the long interval ſince we ſeparated near the coaſt of England, till our preſent meeting that day; and he, on his part, entertained me with ſeveral remarkable incidents, which had happened to them in the courſe of their voyage. Particularly, he told me, that, about a twelve-month
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0204000302:204"/>
before, they had taken a new French-built brigantine, and put their officers and ſhip's company's plunder on board of her, which they valued at ten thouſand pounds ſterling; that their ſecond Captain, Mr. Mitchel, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the command of her, and was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to go to ſome iſland on the coaſt of Mexico, and to ſtay there till Captain Clipper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſhould join him with his ſhip; but that they never could find the iſland ſince, and, therefore, judged that poor Mitchel, and his men, were either ſtarved, or murdered by the Spaniards or Indians, or that he had periſhed with the iſland, ſuch ſubmerſions being frequent on thoſe coaſts. The ſtory of Captain Mitchel, who was a very worthy man, and an expert ſailor, is, in all its circumſtances, a very tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal one. There was always a jealouſy between him and his Captain, who ordered him to a place, and pretended to give him infallible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to find it, which never could be found afterwards, and, tis my opinion, never was above water; and the unfortunate gentleman, without doubt, periſhed in ſome obſcure, miſerable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in queſt of a place that was never yet, and perhaps never may be diſcovered. In our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I aſked Mr. Davidſon the value of the booty they had made, and he aſſured me it did not exceed 70,000 dollars—but that they had loſt great opportunities—that in October, 1720, they were in the bay of Conception, and had the misfortune to leave three laden ſhips
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0204000302:205"/>
behind them, and miſſed a fourth, which was coming into the bay, and which was ſo near as to hail and talk to them, beſides being becalmed by them;—that though it was probable their launch could have taken them all four, yet, through their Captain's deafneſs to advice, they took none of them:—that, moreover, they had never yet cleaned their bottom, notwithſtanding they had had it in their power to do it; and that this negligence had like to have coſt them dear; for that, in their return from Conception, they looked into Coquimbo, where they ſaw five ſhips at anchor, three of which let ſlip after them, and overtook them apace, but by the favour of thick weather, and a hard gale of wind, they got clear of them; and further, that, off the port of Callao, they fell in with the Flying-fiſh frigate, which was cruiſing for me in the bark, and which, by unpardonable miſmanagement on the part of Clipperton, got ſafe from them, although deeply laden with a valuable cargo deſigned for Cadiz. I have been ſince informed of this by one of my ſurgeon's mates, who was taken in the Mercury, and was ſurgeon of the Flying-fiſh at that time.</p>
            <p>This was the ſubſtance of my diſcourſe with Mr. Davidſon, when, in the mean time, a gale ſprung up, which interrupted us, and I bore down to the Succeſs, and went on board of her. I gave Captain Clipperton, and Mr. Godfrey, the agent-general, the whole hiſtory of my voyage hitherto, and expected that I ſhould
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0204000302:206"/>
have been treated by them as one belonging to the ſame intereſt, but found I was miſtaken; for they were unwilling to have any thing to do with me ſince my ſhip was loſt. However, I conceived, that he could not be ſo inhuman, as to deny me the ſupply of ſuch neceſſaries as I wanted, and he could conveniently ſpare. The anſwer I had to this was, that I ſhould know more of his mind the next day. Amongſt the reſt of the diſcourſe I had with him, he told me he was juſt come from the iſland of Cocos, that his people were ſickly, and at very ſhort allowance. Upon this, I offered my ſervice to pilot him to Mariato, which was not above thirty leagues diſtant from us, where he might have refreſhed his people, and ſupplied himſelf with what he would. But this was not accepted, he being reſolved to make the beſt of his way to the Tres Marias, where, he ſaid, there was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enough to be had; ſo I left him for that night.</p>
            <p>The next morning, as I was going on board of him again, with ſome of my officers, he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſpread all his canvas, and crouded away from us, who were in the boat: upon which I returned to our ſhip again, and made ſignals of diſtreſs, and fired our gun ſeveral times, which was not regarded by him, till his very officers cried out on his barbarity, and, at laſt, he brought to. When I had ſailed up with him, (being exaſperated at ſuch inhuman treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) I ſent Mr. Brooks, our Firſt Lieutenant,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0204000302:207"/>
to know the reaſon of his abrupt departure, and to tell him that we ſtood in need of ſeveral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, which, if he was not inclined to give, I would purchaſe of him. Upon theſe terms he ſpared me two of his quarter-deck guns, ſixty round ſhot, ſome muſquet-balls and flints, and a Spaniſh chart of the coaſt of Mexico and part of India and China, a half-hour, and a half-minute glaſs, a compaſs, and about 300 weight of ſalt; but with all the arguments I could uſe, I could not prevail on him to ſpare us the leaſt thing out of his ſurgeon's cheſt for the relief of Mr. Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, our maſter, who had been ready to die of his wounds received in the engagement with the Margarita, for above three months paſt. When this was concluded, I again aſked him, if I could be of any ſervice to him, and aſſured him, I had a pretty good ſhip under foot, though ſhe made but a poor figure, and believed I could hold him way, and that he knew our cargo was pretty valuable. To all this he anſwered, that, if I had a cargo of gold, he had no buſineſs with me, and that I muſt take care of myſelf. Mr. Hendry, the agent, and Mr. Rainer and Mr. Dodd, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants of marines, ſeeing but little proſpect that we ſhould ever get home, and being weary of the work that was impoſed upon them, deſired I would let them go on board the Succeſs, for a paſſage to England; which I conſenting to, they went on board accordingly, and Clipperton left us to ſhift for ourſelves, near the iſland of Cano. Having purchaſed this ſupply, I was for going to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0204000302:208"/>
the ſouthward into the bay of Panama, to try our fortune there; but the majority oppoſed me through fear, and were for going to the Tres Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as, to ſalt turtle there, and then ſtretch over for India. We directed our courſe thither; and, a few days after, met with the Succeſs in queſt of Sonſonnate, where they expected to receive the Marquis of Villa Roche's ranſom. That noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had been ſome time a priſoner with them, and his wife was now at Guatimali, a city within 30 leagues of that port. We ranged cloſe under their ſtern, and aſked how Captain Clipperton and the reſt of the gentlemen did, but it was not thought proper to return any anſwer; ſo without any concern, he ſteered one way, and we another. After this, calms, and contrary winds, and unaccountable currents, reduced us to a very ſmall allowance, which we were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diminiſh daily, and ſhould have been in deeper diſtreſs than ever, had it not been for the turtle which we took on the ſurface of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We had a continual look-out for them, and they were eaſily known, at a great diſtance, by the number of ſea-birds that perched on their backs. Upon ſight of theſe, we uſed to lay aſide the advantages we might have made of the wind, to embrace the opportunity of prolonging our proviſions. Upon the whole, though we loſt ſome of our way in purſuit of turtle after this manner, it was not the greateſt inconvenience that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tended us; the dreſſing it made a great conſumption of our water, the quantity of which
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0204000302:209"/>
decreaſed upon us very ſuddenly, by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual uſe of it in boiling the turtle with plantain flower. This relapſe into a ſtate of famine, threatening us with ſpeedy and certain perdition, if means were not uſed to avert it, made me propoſe the plundering of ſome ſmall town as we coaſted along the ſhore. Guatulco was the neareſt to us: but the very morning we were ſteering in for this place, at ſun-riſing we ſaw a ſail a conſiderable way to leeward of us. We thought it would be better to take this ſhip than to venture on ſhore, and therefore we bore down to her, who in the end proved to be the Succeſs. We now met with a double baulk, both as to our hopes of Guatulco and the ſhip; for we were by this accident got ſo far to the leeward of Guatulco, that it was needleſs to beat up ſo far againſt the wind for an uncertainty, when we had a gale, that, had it continued, would have carried us to ſome better port.</p>
            <p>But the winds were but a few hours propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and were ſucceeded by perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary gales, which deſtroyed all our hopes, and brought us down to a ſmall earthen plate of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavances, a kind of ſmall bean, for 24 hours, which not being ſufficient to keep us alive, we had recourſe to the remainder of our ſmoked congers, which had for ſome months been neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and lain ſoaking and rotting in the bulge water. They were certainly as diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able food as ever men eat.</p>
            <p>Under theſe calamitous circumſtances did we
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0204000302:210"/>
meet with the Succeſs a fourth time, near the port of Angels; and, after having made the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſignal, we ſtood ſo near to one another, that, to uſe the ſea phraſe, a biſket might have been toſſed from ſhip to ſhip, but we did not change a word with each other; for, Captain Clipperton, as I have ſince been informed, had ordered all his officers and ſhip's company to take no notice of us: and, though he was ſo truly ſenſible of the difficulties and hazards we had to cope with, if our deſign was to go for India, that he ſaid, The child that was born the day before would be grey headed with age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould arrive there (intimating by that expreſſion, that it was impoſſible for us to do it), yet, notwithſtanding, he, without any remorſe, could ſee us on the brink of ſuffering the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſeverities our ill fortune could load us with, and not lend us a helping hand to deliver us from the impending ruin.</p>
            <p>Thus ſurrounded on all ſides by preſent want and threatening diſaſters, we, on the 12th of March, being off the port of Acapulco, ſaw a ſhip between us and the ſhore. I bore down to her, till perceiving her to be a large Europe-built ſhip, with Spaniſh colours flying, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded ſhe was the Peregrine, who, as I had been informed, had carried the Prince of St. Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eno, who had been Viceroy of Peru, to this port in his way to Spain. With theſe ſuſpicions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet unwilling to run ourſelves ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into the enemy's clutches, I hauled again

on a wind, which he ſeeing, he pulled down his Spaniſh, and hoiſted an Engliſh enſign, and made the ſignal agred on between Clipperton and me for knowing one another. Had they been in any other part, I ſhould have been ſo far from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any thoughts of ſuch a change in him, that I ſhould have looked on all his ſignals as the artifices of the enemy, who might have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted themſelves with them by the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch of our men as they might have taken priſoners. But now, making no doubt that it was he, I bore down to him, and being come along his ſide, he ſent Captain Cook, his ſecond Lieutenant, in his yaul, with an obliging letter to me, to inform me, he was cruiſing for the homeward-bound Manilla ſhip, and deſiring I would aſſiſt him in the enterprize, and come on board of him the next morning, propoſing a union of our two ſhip's companies. I was very well pleaſed with this offer, and, without heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, returned him word that I would be with him early.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I read over his letter pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly to my people, and exhorted them ſeriouſly to conſider of the great benefits that would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to us on all ſides from it. Upon which they all expreſſed the moſt reſigned willingneſs to join in the undertaking. But, as Clipperton had uſed us ſo unhandſomely before, they deſired I would get ſome ſecurity for their ſhares, ſigned by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clipperton, Mr. Godfrey the agent, and the reſt of their officers. I went on board, and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0204000302:212"/>
to their requeſt, Capt. Clipperton, and Mr. Godfrey, the owners agent, immediately drew up an inſtrument fully worded for the purpoſe, and they and all the other officers ſigned it. This was all my people wanted to make them eaſy.</p>
            <p>We then proceeded upon our main buſineſs; and, after mature deliberation, it was thought moſt adviſeable, that I ſhould ſend the greateſt part of my men on board the Succeſs, as ſoon as we ſaw the Manilla ſhip come out of Acapulco, and leave only a boat's crew with me to bring me away, in caſe I ſhould have occaſion to make uſe of my ſhip as a fire-ſhip, or a ſmoaker, which we jointly propoſed to do, if we found the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my too hard for us; and it was determined to board her at once, as we ſhould otherwiſe have much the worſt of it, on account of their ſuperior weight of metal, and the better capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their ſhips, which are built very ſtrong, to bear a cannonading. Clipperton aſſured me, he was certain of the time when ſhe would ſail from this port, which the Spaniards ſay is always within a day or two after Paſſion-week, of which we had a fortnight yet to come.</p>
            <p>Before I returned to my own ſhip, I acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Captain Clipperton with our ſlender ſtock of proviſions, but particularly with our ſhortneſs of water; and he told me he had 80 tons of it on board, and he would ſpare me as much of it as I would have, or any thing elſe his ſhip afforded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0204000302:213"/>I had now the pleaſure of being reſtored to my command in as regular a manner as ever; every one, from the higheſt to the loweſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the ſatisfaction he had in the proſpect before us. But Morphew, that ringleader of all our diſorders, fearing my reſentment, thought it was his beſt way, to inſinuate himſelf into the favour of the Captain and Officers of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, which he did effectually, by an humble, ſubmiſſive, outward deportment, and prevailing preſents. In ſhort, he had his end, and left me; but, the next morning, Mr. Rainer, who acted with us afterwards as Captain of marines, came on board of us to viſit his old ſhipmates, and ſo continued.</p>
            <p>Thus we cruiſed in good order, and with a great deal of hope, until March 17, when, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evening, Clipperton, contrary to his uſual cuſtom, ſtretched a-head of us about two leagues, without lowering ſo much as a top-gallant-ſail for us to come up with him. I could not but be a little ſtartled at this, as being quite contrary to his uſual method. However, I kept ſtanding after him, as I thought, in the night, till we were almoſt in the breakers on the ſhore, which of courſe obliged us to tack, and ſtand out to ſea again, admiring all the time that we had had no ſignal for going about. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we had no ſight of any ſhip near us, which laid me under the moſt terrible apprehenſions, conſidering the bad condition we were in for want of water, and the vaſt diſtance we were at
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0204000302:214"/>
from any place where we could expect to get a recruit of any, having now no choice left, but either to beat up 220 leagues againſt the wind, to go to the Tres Marias, or bear away a much more conſiderable diſtance for the gulph of Amapala, or the iſland of Cocos.</p>
            <p>But, notwithſtanding our diſtreſs, I kept our cruiſing ſtation for him two or three days. At laſt it was reſolved to bear away to the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place to water at; and, in truth, it was time, for we were now 40 odd men, who had but three buts of water for a run of 300 leagues and upwards, on a coaſt ſubject to long calms, variable winds, and uncertain currents.</p>
            <p>It was afterwards told me, that the night Clipperton left us, he aſſembled all his officers, and told them it was his intention immediately to quit the coaſt. His officers remonſtrated to him on the barbarity of doing this without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting Captain Shelvock with his intention, and ſparing us ſome water. But he put off their ſerious expoſtulations with an inhuman ſneer, ſaying, That, if I ſhould, through want, be obliged to ſurrender to the enemy, I ſhould only ſhare the ſame fate, that, perhaps, ſome others had met with before me.</p>
            <p>Thus this man, perhaps, through an exceſs of mean-ſpiritedneſs, and dreading the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a ſhip that was always known to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend itſelf with ſome obſtinacy, neglected as fine an opportunity as moſt of our nation have ever had of taking this ſhip, which, as I was informed,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0204000302:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by ſome Spaniards from Manilla, when I was in China, came out of Acapulco about a week after we left the cruize—[For Capt. Clipperton's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this tranſaction we refer the reader to the preceding voyage.]</p>
            <p>On March 30, in the evening, we entered the road of Sonſonnate, and, as the ſun ſet, ſaw a ſhip at anchor there. It being a moon-light night, I ſent the firſt Lieutenant, with ſome of the beſt hands, to diſcover what this ſhip might be. On his return he informed me, the ſhip was a large one, of one tier of guns at leaſt. I nevertheleſs continued to ply in all the night, and prepared for action. At day-light we found they had hoiſted a jar of powder, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining about ten gallons, with lighted match, at each main and fore yard arm, and at the bowſprit end, with deſign to let them fall on our decks if we boarded them. This contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, if it had taken effect, would have ſoon made an end of both ſhips, and of all that were in them. Seeing them ſo deſperate in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, I expected a warm diſpute with them; and, by what I could ſee, they were, in all points, ſuperior by much to us in ſtrength.</p>
            <p>At eleven in the morning, the ſea-breeze came in, and ran us upon them very faſt, whilſt our ſmall arms were briſkly and effectually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to break their powder jars, before we came to board them, which we did without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and, after the exchange of a few ſhot when on board of each other, they ſubmitted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0204000302:216"/>This ſhip was called the Sacra Familia, of 300 tons, ſix guns, and 70 men; beſides a great number of ſmall arms, with ſome grenade ſhells and ſhot. She had been, for ſome time before, arrived from Callao, with wine and brandy; but had now nothing in her but fifty jars of gunpowder, and a ſmall parcel of ruſk and jerked beef. In ſhort, ſhe could hardly be ſaid to be worth the trouble we took, and the riſques we ran for her: but ſhe was reputed to be a better ſailor, and was viſibly better fitted out than our own; wherefore I changed ſhips, and we all went on board our prize, which was equipped in the warlike manner we found her, and commiſſioned, on purpoſe to take us.</p>
            <p>A merchant, the eſcrivan of the ſhip, being On board, deſired we would ſell him the Jeſus Maria, which we agreed to, and ſent him on ſhore to raiſe the money for that purpoſe; and at night he came off with another Spaniſh gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and brought us a letter of advice from the Governor on ſhore, ſignifying that there was a treaty of peace on foot between their Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannic and Catholic Majeſties, which was what we had not before heard of. However, I ſent to the Governor, ſignifying that I ſhould be very glad to ſee the proclamation and articles; and that thereupon, I ſhould be ready to obey the commands of my Sovereign; ſo we came to an agreement with the Governor to lye in the road till he ſent to Guatimala, 50 leagues diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, for thoſe papers, provided he would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0204000302:217"/>
us with water and proviſions. On the 5th of April, the Governor ſent on board two papers, which, by the beſt interpretation we could get of them, did not appear to us to be in the form of proclamations. We told thoſe who brought the papers aboard, that we were in great want of an interpreter; upon which they ſaid, there were ſome Engliſhmen at Guati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala, whom they would ſend for, if we would ſtay three days for them, and that they would ſupply us with water and proviſions till that time; which we agreed to, and they deſired we would ſend our boat on ſhore every morning for the ſupply. Accordingly, on the 7th of April, we ſent our boat on ſhore with Mr. Brooks, our firſt Lieutenant, and five men. This officer, men, and boat, the Governor detained under a flag of truce, and, at night, ſent off a ſmall boat, with two of our men, with a letter from himſelf, and another from Mr. Brooks. His letter ſignified, that, if we did not deliver up our ſhip to him, he would declare us pirates. And Mr. Brooks, by his, informed me, that it was his opinion, that the Governor was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to bully me into a ſurrender, having ſpoken very ambiguouſly of a ceſſation of arms: notwithſtanding which, I ſent the Governor a letter, ſignifying, that, if we could be ſecured of a ſafe and ſure conduct for ourſelves and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to Panama, and from thence, by the way of Porto Bello, be conveyed to any of our Britiſh plantations, we would come to a farther
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0204000302:218"/>
treaty; which if he intended, he was deſired to ſignify it by firing two guns as ſoon as he had received this advice, and by ſending back my officer and men; if not, neceſſity would oblige us to ſail. At three in the morning, (the Governor having ſhewn no ſignal, nor ſent any word) we weighed our anchor, yet lay to in the bay till ten, but then made ſail, being forced thereto for want of water; having, however, no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, in caſe of the certainty of a peace, than to deliver up the ſhip we were now in at the firſt convenient port, as was ſignified to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor by letter.</p>
            <p>Being now got out to ſea, we reduced our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a pint of water for 24 hours each man, and directed our courſe for the gulph of Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pala, which was about 35 leagues to the E.S.E. of this place, in order to get a freſh ſupply. The loſs of my officer and boat's crew, ſenſibly diminiſhed the number of white faces, and we ſhould have been ſo much weakened by it, that we ſhould never have been able to manage this great ſhip, with her heavy cotton ſails, if we had not taken with us our negro priſoners, who proved to be very good ſailors. The loſs of our boat was alſo a very great inconvenience to us; but as I only thought of taking water enough to carry us to Panama, where we were fully reſolved to ſurrender, if it was really peace, I imagined we might make ſhift without her, and get ſuch a quantity as we might want in two or three days time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0204000302:219"/>The winds were favourable, and we arrived there on the tenth following in the evening. As ſoon as we had entered the gulph we found our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the midſt of ſeveral ſmall iſlands, one of which was the iſland of Tygers, where we expected to find water; but our expectations proved vain, for, after a hazardous and fruitleſs ſearch not only on that, but on ſome of the greeneſt of the other iſles, there was not the leaſt drop of freſh water to be found, by us, on any of them.</p>
            <p>In this miſerable condition, threatened on all ſides with inevitable deſtruction, unfit for the ſea, fearful of truſting ourſelves in the cruel hands of the inhabitants on the ſhore, quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited by the continued courſe of misfortunes which had hitherto been our conſtant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; but, above all, lamenting this unhappy baulk in not finding water where we ſo much expected it, which had reduced us to ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities as we had never known before; in ſhort, ready to ſink under the burden of our calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we weighed our anchor on the 13th of April before day-break, and ſtood out from this gulph. And now having the open ſea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, I brought my people in general to an obſtinate reſolution not to ſurrender on this part of the coaſt, let the conſequences be ever ſo miſerable. Upon this unanimous agreement, with not 40 gallons of water in the ſhip, and no other liquids to ſupply the want of it, we came to ſo ſmall an allowance as half a pint of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0204000302:220"/>
water for 24 hours; and even this allowance was rather too large, there being no place, that we knew of, where we could get any more, nearer than Quibo, to which iſland, about 200 leagues diſtant from us, we ſhaped our courſe, but having very uncertain winds and weather, we were 13 days at this allowance. Our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from the extremity of thirſt are hardly to be conceived; ſome drank their own water to allay the burning heat within them, but though this moiſtened their mouths, it increaſed their miſery; ſome drank large draughts of ſea-water, which was near putting a period to their lives; while others eat juſt enough of the calavances moiſtened with water to ſuſtain life, and theſe ſuffered the leaſt.</p>
            <p>At length we were fortunately relieved, by falling in unexpectedly with the iſland of Cano, in lat. 9 deg. N. where ſeeing a run of water, Mr. Randall, without dreading the dangerous ſurf, paſſed through the breakers, and, to the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joy of all the company, ſoon returned on board with his jars filled; but as he could not bring off more than 60 or 70 gallons, I took care to reſtrain our people in the uſe of it, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to each man only a quart for their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate uſe: and I was the more ſtrict in this diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, becauſe Mr. Randall aſſured me, the breakers were ſo dangerous, that he believed we ſhould not be able to get at any more.</p>
            <p>Being willing, however, to make another trial, I next day ſent the boatſwain, to endeavour to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0204000302:221"/>
procure a further ſupply; but, after waſting the whole day in ſearch of a ſmooth beach to land upon, he could not ſee one ſpot where he durſt venture on ſhore. Therefore, thinking we had a ſtock ſufficient to carry us to Quibo, I weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anchor, and in ranging the iſland I acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally diſcovered a ſmooth beach, where the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boat getting on ſhore, the crew filled nine jars, which laſted till we arrived at Quibo, where we anchored at the ſame place we had twice an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored at before. Here we conſulted about ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendering ourſelves to the Spaniards, being within 80 leagues of Panama, a place of little or no ſtrength towards the ſea, and but little frequented by the enemy's ſhips of war, where we could treat with them at a diſtance, and be truly informed how affairs ſtood in Europe. During our deliberations we wooded and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at leiſure; and ſome ſearched the woods for fruits to refreſh us, by way of prevention againſt the ſcurvy, which we had been all along leſs ſubject to than any ſhip I ever ſaw or heard of in ſuch long runs. Thoſe who were thus uſefully employed brought us papas, guayavas, caſſia, limes, and a ſmall kind of white ſour plumb, which was much eaten and admired by moſt of us; but, by its violent operation, it put a ſtop to our proceedings for ſome days. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we ſoon recovered, without any bad ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and made an end of wooding and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſet ſail, fully determined to ſurrender at Panama. In our way we paſſed by a great many

ſmall iſlands, but the moſt remarkable are, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſa, Sebaco, and the iſle of Picara, which lies on the weſtern ſide of Quibo.</p>
            <p>May 15, a ſmall bark, taking us for Spaniards, bore down to us, the maſter of which was in the greateſt conſternation when he found his miſtake, but recovered when he heard we were bound for Panama to ſurrender, and readily offered his pilot thither, his veſſel, called the Holy Sacrament, being bound to that port, laden with dried beef, pork, and live hogs, which, as ſhe was leaky, he deſired that I would take in tow. I was glad this bark fell into our hands, and readily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with his requeſt, becauſe, if we found the Governor of Sonſonnate's account to be falſe, we might be thoroughly enabled by this help to go to India. In the mean while, it had remained a point yet undetermined, who ſhould be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon entruſted with the flag of truce; for my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, having known much treachery, were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive the perſon ſent would only, or chiefly, make good his own caſe and that of his friends to the Governor, and not care what became of the common men. At laſt, my ſon was judged the fitteſt to go, as he would ſurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, if it were purely for my ſake. Other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties were ſtarted that could not ſo eaſily be removed, notwithſtanding which, we kept on our way, fully fixed in our reſolution.</p>
            <p>May 17, another ſmall bark came down upon us, but having ſtood pretty near to us, ſhe bore away again, and ran on ſhore directly, at the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0204000302:225"/>
of the lives of every ſoul on board. This unaccountable behaviour, gave us good reaſon to believe, that the governor of Sonſonnate's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a ceſſation of arms was groundleſs.</p>
            <p>May 19, we ſaw a ſail a-head of us, ſtanding along ſhore, and being deſirous of ſpeaking with her, I let go the bark we had in tow, and made all the ſail we could after her. We gained very little upon her all the day; but had, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, got a great way a-head of our bark, wherein were four of our own people and five Spaniards. However, notwithſtanding night came on, all our ſail was kept abroad, and next morning we were within gun-ſhot of her. I immediately or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered our colours to be ſpread, fired a gun to leeward, and ſet a man to wave a flag of truce; but, on ſight of our Engliſh enſign, ſhe fired at us, and ſo continued to do, with her decks full of men, abuſing us with the groſſeſt appellations. I made no return until I came cloſe upon their quarter, and then I ſent one of their countrymen to the bowſprit end, to inform them in Spaniſh, that we were bound to Panama, and deſired to treat peaceably with them, and hoped, at leaſt, they would have ſome regard to the white flag which they ſaw flying; but they ſtill continued their fire; and preſuming, as I ſuppoſed, by our quiet behaviour, that we were unable to defend ourſelves, they were preparing to board us, which I no ſooner perceived than I met them with our helm, and gave them ſo warm a ſalute, that they ſteered round off from us. We juſt miſſed get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0204000302:226"/>
hold of them, but it falling almoſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately calm, we continued our engagement for the ſpace of two or three hours at the diſtance of muſquet-ſhot. At length, a breeze wafting us nearer to them, we found that as faſt as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, ſo faſt did their courage cool. Their Captain, however, ſtill bravely encouraging his people, and expoſing himſelf in the openeſt manner, was ſhot through the body, and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped down dead; upon which they immediately, and with one voice, cried out for quarter, and put an end to the diſpute. Mr. Randall, and two or three more, went on board the prize, and found the priſoners in the moſt ſubmiſſive poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, aſking for mercy, which was granted, though they had no great reaſon to expect it, after their direct breach of the laws of arms and nations in firing at a flag of truce.</p>
            <p>The moſt conſiderable priſoners, being brought on board, informed me, that their ſhip, called the Conception de Recova, belonging to Callao, was of the burthen of 200 tons, and laden with flour, loaves of ſugar, bales of boxes of malmalade, jars of preſerved peaches, grapes, limes, and the like, mounted ſix guns, and had 70 odd men on board. In this engagement, the Spaniſh Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and a negroe were killed, and one or two ſlightly wounded. On our part, our gunner was ſlightly wounded by a piſtol ball, and our main-maſt had a ſmall piece carried out of the ſide of it. We had now about 80 priſoners of all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, though we ourſelves were not above 26.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0204000302:227"/>Amongſt our priſoners we had ſeveral of note, particularly Don Baltazzar de Abarca, Conde de Roſa, an European nobleman, who had beeen Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of Piſco, and was now upon his return to Spain, together with Captain Morel, who had formerly been taken by Captain Rogers. They were all treated with the utmoſt civility, which they the more wondered at, becauſe, from a ſelf-conviction of their own ungenerous behaviour towards us, they could not but expect to have been dealt with quite otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>The winds and calms prevented our joining the Holy Sacrament, the prize we had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us, till May 22, when we bore down to her, and were ſurprized to find no ſoul on board, but that her decks and quarters were covered with blood. By many circumſtances it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that the Spaniſh crew had butchered thoſe who were left to aſſiſt them, while they were aſleep; otherwiſe it could not have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that five unarmed Spaniards could have overpowered four Engliſhmen completely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with arms for their defence. It is very probable, however, that theſe murderers paid with their lives, the loſs of thoſe lives they had taken away; for, being above four leagues from the land, and having no boat with them, they probably jumped into the ſea on our approach, fearing, if they fell into our hands, to meet the vengeance due for ſo horrid a crime. That part of the deck which was dyed with gore they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to cover, by throwing the flocks and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0204000302:228"/>
ſtuffings of beds over it; ſo that till theſe were removed, the blood was not to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>This tragical accident put a damp to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we had enjoyed for a day or two paſt on the account of our late prize. Our priſoners, at ſuch a ſad and ſudden change, began to be alarmed, and looked at one another as if they all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be the victims of our revenge upon this unhappy occaſion. On the other hand, I was fearful leſt theſe apprehenſions ſhould urge them to ſome deſperate attempt, they being 80 in number, and we not above 17 on board of our own ſhip, and, when we were all together, not above 25 that could ſtand to arms. In this dilemma, I ordered all the priſoners into the ſtern gallery, except the nobleman, and ſome of the chief officers, and a guard to be kept in the great cabbin.</p>
            <p>The Spaniſh gentlemen obſerving this, let fall ſome expreſſions whereby I perceived they were afraid I intended to proceed to ſeverities towards their people; but I aſſured them, that, if I was of ſo revengeful a nature, the laws of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try forbad me from indulging it; that I acted under my King's commiſſion; and that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural abhorrence our nation had to barbarity, might quiet their fears, and make them perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eaſy. They then, on their part, in the moſt ſolemn manner diſclaimed the very thought of an attempt upon our lives; and aſſured us, on their honour, that they thought they ſhould never be able to make a juſt return for the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0204000302:229"/>
generous treatment they had met with. It was, however, prudent to ſecure our priſoners of the meaner ſort, and when we had ſo done, we hauled the Holy Sacrament along-ſide of us. She was half full of water, and the greateſt part of her dried beef was wet and ſpoiled, but all that was not damaged we took out, together with ſome live logs. We alſo took out of the Conception a twelvemonth's proviſion of bread, flour, ſugar and ſweetmeats, and a like propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Succeſs, whom I expected to find at the Tres Marias, being then a ſtranger to Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perton's faithleſs deſertion. I likewiſe took from them their launch and their negroes; for conſidering we had a large ſhip, and a run of 175 degrees of longitude to ſail, which was little leſs than half way round the world, I thought we could do no other than reinforce ourſelves with theſe blacks, who are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good ſailors in theſe parts; and, indeed, we afterwards found we ſhould never have reached the coaſts of Aſia without them.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſupplied ourſelves with every thing the Conception afforded, I ſuffered our priſoners to return to their own ſhip again; but the chief of them would not leave me till they had drawn up a writing, which they ſigned, whereby they acknowledged the circumſtances of our engagement, in the manner I have already related. In ſhort, no people, circumſtanced as we were, could part in a more friendly manner than we did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0204000302:230"/>Thus were we put by our deſign of ſurrendering, and were going to undertake a long and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous voyage to Aſia. Our ſtrength was indeed conſiderably augmented, for we had now 15 guns, and ammunition enough to ſupply them.</p>
            <p>Before we proceeded any farther, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to get in a full ſtock of water. The iſland of Quibo was hazardous for us, being too near Panama; it was therefore determined to ply up to Cano, where, having a good boat, we ſoon did our buſineſs. In our paſſage thither, the ſweetmeats of all kinds, which we had taken out of our late prize, were divided among the meſſes. It happened that one of the fellows, one day, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained he had a box of malmalade which he could not ſtick his knife into, and deſired it might be changed. I opened it, and found in it a cake of virgin ſilver, moulded on purpoſe to fill ſuch boxes, and being very porous, it was of near the ſame weight of ſo much mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malade. In overhauling the reſt, we found five more of theſe boxes. This was a contrivance to defraud the King of Spain of his fifths, which he claims in all the ſilver taken out of any of the mines in Peru. We doubtleſs left a great many of theſe boxes behind us, ſo that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit ſerved them in a double capacity, to defraud their king's officers, and blind their enemies. An affair as vexatious as this, is ſaid to have been diſcovered too late on board a prize the Succeſs had taken, where they found a very
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0204000302:231"/>
conſiderable quantity of Pinna's or virgin ſilver, in the form of bricks, very artfully plaiſtered over with clay, and dried in the ſun, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the conſiſtence they give their bricks in that country, they were taken to be really ſuch, and a great number of them were thrown over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board as ſo much rubbiſh, without any diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of what they were, till the four or five laſt pieces. How true this may be I can't ſay, but it was reported to be, as matter of fact, by ſeveral of the officers belonging to Captain Clipperton.</p>
            <p>I muſt here obſerve, that every thing we took in the Conception was divided among us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Juan Fernandian articles, and that I had no more than ſix inſtead of ſixty ſhares. They would not ſo much as allow me the money I had laid out at St. Catherine's, which was upwards of a hundred pounds. I had ſome difficulty to perſuade them to run to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſo far as California; and was obliged to uſe many arguments to prevail upon them to believe that the harbour of Puerto Seguro was the only port of ſecurity where we could ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay down and refit our ſhip; but having at laſt obtained their conſents, I weighed from Cano, ſteering to the northward, and had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable gales for 48 hours; but then came on the conſtant, or what may be called the trade wind on this coaſt, which being as contrary to us as they well could be, I was willing to try how far off theſe winds might prevail, which,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0204000302:232"/>
in my opinion, may be called the eddy of the true trade wind, whoſe courſe may be perverted by the interpoſition of this vaſt mountainous continent.</p>
            <p>Accordingly I found, that, at the diſtance of 60 leagues, we had light winds and variable, and that, at the diſtance of between 70 and 80 leagues, it ſettled at E. N. E. and N. E. I therefore kept at this diſtance from the land till we had run up to the height of 20 degrees north. In all this paſſage, we were not in the leaſt ſenſible of any currents, and entirely out of the way of certain riplings and overfalls of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which we frequently met with nearer to the land, and which often ſurprized us when we were becalmed in deep water.</p>
            <p>In this paſſage we were accompanied by vaſt ſhoals of fiſh, and were continually incommoded by numerous flocks of the birds called boobies, making our ſhip their reſting place, which fouled our yards and deck with their dung as faſt as we could clean them. However, for change of diet, ſome of my people made ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouts of them, and the ſmoakers made ſtems for their pipes of their long wing-bones.</p>
            <p>We fell in with Cape Corientes in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the month of Auguſt, and were carried away to the iſlands called the Tres Marias, by a hard gale at ſouth, and came to an anchor under the lee of the middlemoſt of theſe iſlands, but could ſee no ſign of the Succeſs having been there. After a tedious ſearch on all the three
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0204000302:233"/>
iſlands for freſh water, there was nothing like a ſtream of it that we could find. This was the more aſtoniſhing to us, as one or two of our late navigators have reported that freſh water is to be found there in ſufficient plenty. It may have been ſo when they were there; but we were unfortunate enough to ſeek, when none was to be found.</p>
            <p>After employing three days in a fruitleſs ſearch, I ſtretched over for the coaſt of Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fornia, and arrived there on the 11th of Auguſt. The inhabitants, as ſoon as they diſcovered us, made fires all along the ſhore as the ſhip ran by them; and, towards the evening, it falling calm, two of them came off to us on a bark-log, but were a long time before they would accept of our invitation to come on board of us. At length, they ventured in; when, in a moment, ſeeing our blacks promiſcuouſly ſtanding toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with us white men, they, with very angry countenances, ſeparated them from us, and would hardly ſuffer them to look at us. They talked to us with great vehemence, but we could comprehend nothing more of their meaning, than that they rejoiced to ſee us. Night coming on, they took their leave, and we gave them a knife or two, an old coat, and ſome other trifles, which ſeemed to pleaſe them very well. They expreſſed themſelves by ſigns in ſuch a manner, that we could gueſs they gave us repeated invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to go on ſhore with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0204000302:234"/>On Sunday the 13th of Auguſt, at day-break, we found ourſelves near Puerto Seguro, which may be readily known by three white rocks, not much unlike the Needles of the Iſle of Wight, and you muſt keep cloſe on board the outermoſt to fetch into the bay. We entered Puerto Seguro, ſurrounded by numbers of ſmall embarkations of the inhabitants, while the ſhore, on all ſides, was crouded with Indians, whoſe numbers viſibly increaſed by multitudes which flocked together from the adjacent parts. Our anchor was no ſooner down, than they came off to us in ſhoals, ſome few on their bark-logs, but moſt of them ſwimming, talking and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to one another in a noiſy and confuſed manner, but ſuch as plainly ſhewed how deſirous they were to come to us. Our ſhip was in an inſtant full of theſe ſwarthy gentlemen quite naked, and amongſt the reſt was their King, or Chief man, who, unexpectedly, delivered to me his batoon, or enſign of royalty, which I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately returned to him. This man, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the wildneſs of his appearance to us, had a good countenance, and his behaviour had ſomething that was very engaging in it. I was, at firſt, at a loſs to know how to entertain our numerous gueſts, but at length I thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galing them with ſome of our liquid ſweetmeats, which we had in great plenty. This they liked extremely, and the ſpoons, which were moſtly ſilver, they returned with great honeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0204000302:235"/>Having thus commenced a friendſhip with them, at day-break next morning our boat went on ſhore to cut wood and fill water; and before the ſun was up, we were again crouded with our former gueſts, who ſeemed as if they could never be weary of gazing at us. To keep up the amity we had already contracted with them, I ordered a great boiler to be carried on ſhore, with good ſtore of flour and ſugar, and a negroe cook, who was continually boiling of haſty pudding for the numbers of ſpectators on the beach; and it really behoved us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep in their favour, for on ſeeing a few of our men rolling great and cumberſome caſks of water over the heavy ſand, it inclined them to help us. To this may be added, a ſenſe of the kind treatment they met with from us, and the particular readineſs of their chief to ſerve us, by ſhewing his people a good example; for, after Mr. Randall, my Lieutenant, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf took up the ſecond log of wood to carry to the boat, and was immediately followed by two or three hundred of them, who, encouraged by his example, all took to the work, repaying our civilities with their ſervices, and every day they ſeemed more and more fond of us.</p>
            <p>Mean while, the rumour of our arrival was ſpread through all the neighbouring parts, and ſome of the clans, different from thoſe who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited the ſhores, came daily to take a view of us. Thoſe who came from any diſtance in the country could not ſwim; and that they were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0204000302:236"/>
from thoſe we had firſt ſeen on our arrival here, appeared by their manner of painting themſelves, and by other little diſtinctions which were viſible amongſt them; but they all united to aſſiſt us, nor were any of them idle but the women, who uſed to ſit in companies on the ſcorching ſand, waiting for their ſhare of what was going forward, which they uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive very thankfully and without quarrelling.</p>
            <p>Having done all our buſineſs here, in the ſpace of five days, on the 18th of Auguſt, in the morning, we prepared for our departure in the afternoon. We employed the morning in making a large diſtribution of ſugar amongſt the women. To the men we gave a great many knives, old axes, and old iron, which we had taken in our prizes. Theſe were the moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things to them, and of which they ſtood moſt in need; in return for which, ſome of them gave us bows and arrows, deer-ſkin bags, live foxes, ſquirrels, and the like. Great many of the men ſtaid in the ſhip all the while we were purchaſing our anchor, and it was not till we were under weigh that they all jumped over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board to join in the lamentations of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen on ſhore.</p>
            <p>The men in this ſouthern part of California, are tall, ſtraight, and well made; their limbs are large, their hair coarſe and black, and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaches down to their ſhoulders. Their women are of a much ſmaller ſize; their hair is much longer than the mens, and with it ſome of their

faces are almoſt covered. The men go quite naked, and have not the leaſt thing to cover any part of them, except their heads, round which they wear a band of red and white ſilk-graſs, adorned on each ſide with a tuft of hawk's fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The women, on the contrary, wear a thick fringe of ſilk-graſs, which hangs down to their knees, and have either a deer's ſkin, or the ſkin of a large bird, careleſly wrapped over their ſhoulders.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more wild and ſavage to look at, than theſe people at firſt ſight: but there is a wide difference between what they ſeem, and what they really are; for, by all we could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in their behaviour towards one another, and in their deportment towards us, they are endued with great good nature.</p>
            <p>They ſeem to lead a careleſs life, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy every thing in common amongſt them; and, having nothing but their daily food to provide, they are ſtrangers to thoſe numerous grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, the want of which multiply diſtreſſes among nations more civilized and more refined. Their contentment makes them honeſt, for they never offered to ſteal even the things moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them. In a word, they ſeem to paſs their lives, according to the notions we have of the pureſt ſimplicity of the earlieſt ages of the world, before diſcord and contention were heard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men. Having no enemies, they live in perfect peace and harmony with one another. Hunting and fiſhing are their only employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0204000302:239"/>
except making the inſtruments they uſe in theſe purſuits, which are the ſimpleſt that can be. They have no canoes, and go to ſea on bark-logs; but they are the moſt expert divers I ever beheld By their ſimple manner of living, and their continual exerciſe, they live to a great age; and yet, what is very ſurprizing, they do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be very numerous, conſidering the extent of their country. Their only enemies are the wild beaſts, and of theſe there are plenty in the woods and foreſts. They do not appear to be ſo jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their women as they have been repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for we had the company of ſome hundreds of them, young and old, without any reſtraint from the men. Two things were remarkable, that they never would ſuffer us to take ſnuff, but would earneſtly take it from us whenever we attempted it; nor would they ever ſuffer us to look through a ſpying-glaſs, which I had frequent reſort to, to ſee how our work of wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and watering went on. In theſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, they always took upon them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul us, and in theſe two only; the cauſes of which we could never learn.</p>
            <p>They go out to ſea on their bark-logs, which are only compoſed of five logs of a light wood, made faſt to each other by wooden pegs, rowing with a double paddle; and with their harpoons, which are made of a ſort of hard wood, they ſtrike the largeſt albicores, and bring them in when ſtruck. This was altogether ſurprizing to us, who had ſo often experienced the ſtrength

               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0204000302:241"/>
of that fiſh, and the difficulty of getting them into our ſhip, when either hooked or ſtruck. One would imagine, that as ſoon as theſe Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had ſtruck one of theſe albicores, on his light embarkation, it would run away with him and his bark-log; but they either ſtrike them ſo as to give them ſome mortal wound, or have ſome particular way of managing them, for they ſtruggle and reſiſt in vain. When we were in this port, it was apparently their fiſhing ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but by the number of deer-ſkins one ſees amongſt them, it is natural to conclude they have alſo their ſeaſon for hunting. The ſkins of their deer are grey, and ſo are the ſkins of their foxes and ſquirrels; of all which, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they eat indifferently, as of moſt other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals that become their prey. Of birds amongſt them we ſaw ſcarce any, but a few pelicans.</p>
            <p>What theſe Indians uſed inſtead of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ead is very remarkable. It is a ſmall black ſeed of an oily ſubſtance, which they grind much the ſame way as we do our chocolate, and afterwards make it up in ſome ſuch manner. The look of theſe black lumps or rolls ſo made up, is not very inviting, yet the taſte is not very diſagreeable. When they want to drink, they go to the river.</p>
            <p>Their arms are bows and arrows. Their bows are about ſix feet in length, and their arrows ſeem to be ſomewhat too long for their bows. Their bow-ſtrings are made of deer's ſinews, and their arrows are compoſed of a hollow cane for
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0204000302:242"/>
two-thirds of their length, and the other third next the point is of a heavy kind of wood, which is headed with a piece of flint, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a kind of agate, the edges of which are indented, or cut in teeth like a ſaw. They made no manner of ſhew of their arms to us, and it was rarely that we ſaw them in the hands of any of the men. The women had them in the woods in ſearch of game, which may be thence preſumed to be ſome part of their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Upon the whole, they may be truly ſaid to be a happy people.</p>
            <p>Aug. 18, I ſailed, as before-mentioned, from Puerto Suguro, and the ſame evening we took our departure from Cape St. Lucar, in latitude 23 deg. 50 min. N. bound to Canton, in China, the moſt likely place where we could hope to meet with Engliſh ſhips homeward bound for Europe.</p>
            <p>Aug. 21, we diſcovered an iſland bearing W. S. W. 110 leagues diſtant from Cape St. Lucar. I endeavoured to get in with it; but night coming on, I could not loſe time to view it. This iſle my people called after my name. From hence we ſteered gradually into the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel of 13 deg. N. but had our way ſtopped for two or three days by weſterly winds. We were aſtoniſhed at ſuch an unforeſeen delay, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to dread we might meet with many ſuch reverſes of winds in this paſſage; nor could we conjecture, or conceive what might be the cauſe or cauſes of them. In the midſt of this, the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0204000302:243"/>
uſual trade-wind prevailed again, and delivered us from the fears and apprehenſions we had been involved in upon this occaſion. With this we proceeded on our paſſage, keeping the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel or track of the thirteenth degree of north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern latitude, except when we judged ourſelves to be near the ſhoals of St. Bartholomew. We then ventured to ſail a degree more northerly, and ſo continued to do for a run of 60 or 70 leagues.</p>
            <p>About a fortnight after we had left California, my people, who had hitherto enjoyed an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſtate of health, began to be afflicted with a ſickneſs which particularly affected their ſtomachs. This we took to be owing, in a great meaſure, to the quantities of ſweetmeats they were continually devouring, together with the dried beef, half devoured with ants, cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaches, and other vermin, which was their daily food. This ſickneſs increaſed every day, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that, out of our ſmall number, we once buried two in one day, one of whom was John Poppleſtone, our ingenious armourer, who was of ſuch uſe to us on the iſland of Juan Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez. Before we had ſtretched with favourable gales the length of Guam, moſt of my people were ſick and diſabled, my ſhip began to be very leaky, and, to add ſtill to our misfortunes, we had the ill luck to have one of our pumps ſplit, and rendered uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>Under theſe circumſtances, we met with black and diſmal weather, with tempeſtuous winds,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0204000302:244"/>
flying and varying all round the compaſs. Theſe boiſterous gales raiſed ſuch a tumbling ſea, and our ſhip laboured ſo much in it, that the knee of her head, and the whole beak-head, became looſe; ſo that the bowſprit fetched way, and played with the motion of the ſhip, which it continued to do all the time we were out at ſea, and till we arrived at Canton. Our main-maſt ſtood for ſome time without ſhrouds on the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board ſide, till we could unlay our beſt cable to make more, having knotted and ſpliced the old ſhrouds till our labour was in vain.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of all this ſickneſs and diſtreſs, I myſelf was taken violently ill, and had no hope to recover till a fit of the gout gave me ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Great was our want of every thing fit or comfortable for perſons in ſuch a ſtate of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet, about the beginning of October, we paſſed by Guam; and, though upon the very brink of periſhing, we dared not venture in, for fear the inhabitants ſhould take the advantage of our weakneſs, and make ſome attempt upon our lives.</p>
            <p>From Guam I directed my courſe for the iſland of Formoſa. And now, though the length of our voyage was decreaſing very faſt, our ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was daily increaſing upon us in a much greater proportion; and moſt truly it may be ſaid, that both our ſhip and ourſelves were no longer fit for the ſea. It was the 3d of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember before we had ſight of that iſland, and the 10th, before we could get any ſort of direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0204000302:245"/>
to enable us to reach our intended port. At length, as we were paſſing through a very narrow channel, between a couple of iſlands, a fiſherman took notice, by our cautious manner of working, that we were ſtrangers, and made ſigns to us to bring our ſhip to, till he came up with us; when we made him underſtand in general, that we were bound to Macao, and he made ſigns that he would conduct us thither, if we would give him as many pieces of ſilver as he counted little fiſh out of his baſket, which amounted to 40. We accordingly counted out 40 dollars into a hat, and next day he took us in charge, and anchored us ſafe in the road of Macao, near the entrance of the river of Canton.</p>
            <p>Soon after our arrival, there came off to us a great many of the Succeſs's people, to make us a viſit; I was amazed at the ſight of them, and was very glad to hear their ſtory. They ſaid, their Commander, Clipperton, left me deſigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that they went directly to Guam, where they were very well refreſhed, and ſupplied with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; that their Captain ſold the Governor a great quantity of powder and ſhot, and ſeveral other valuable things, and permitted the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Villa Rocha, who was his priſoner, to go on ſhore there; that Mr. Godfrey the agent, and a marine officer, went to ſettle the accounts for what ſupplies of things they had had; and that, as ſoon as they were landed, and the boat come off again, Captain Clipperton weighed with his ſhip, in order to attack a ſhip of 20 guns from
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0204000302:246"/>
Manilla, that had lain quietly in the road in company with him all the time: that in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching her he ran his own ſhip upon the rocks, and ſoon found the enemy was prepared for him: that, his condition being deſperate, and ſuppoſing the loſs of his ſhip inevitable, he had recourſe to his caſe of brandy, and took ſo abundantly of it, that he fell on the deck, and ſnored out his time in a beaſtly manner, whilſt his Firſt Lieutenant, Davidſon, in his ſtead, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the command of the ſhip, which he bravely executed till he was killed: he was ſucceeded by Captain Cook, their Second Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, who made a handſome reſiſtance, and got the ſhip afloat again, after ſhe had lain on the rocks forty-eight hours: that they loſt their priſoner the Marquis de la Rocha, and alſo Mr. Godfrey, the agent-general, with the officer already mentioned; which gave the ſhip's company ſo much diſtaſte, that they would not ſuffer him to have the command of them any more, and, locking him up in his cabbin, choſe Captain Cook to take charge of the ſhip.</p>
            <p>They had, it ſeems, much bad weather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Guam and Amoy in China, whither they got with much difficulty; and there made a dividend of all they had taken, half to the owners, and half to the ſhip's company. Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perton deſigned for the ſtraits of Malacca; but his people, fearing he had no good intentions, would go no farther with him than Macao, that being a Chriſtian port. Upon their arrival
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0204000302:247"/>
there, the Governor ordered Clipperton into cuſtody. It ſeems he had broke priſon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly from thence, where he had been confined (as far as could be learned) on account of his having run away with Dampier's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and one of his prizes; but upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing his Majeſty's commiſſion now for the Succeſs, they gave him no farther trouble, and only contented themſelves with fleecing him a little. Here he ſold his ſhip, the Succeſs, for about 1000l. ſterling.—[Such is the account given by Captain Shelvock, for the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he ſays, of the gentlemen-owners, who will never, either publickly or privately, be let into the truth of that ſtory.]</p>
            <p>But to go on, Nov. 12, about noon, a pilot came off to us, and we immediately weighed, and entered the river of Canton, where, finding the Bonita and Haſtings, two Engliſh country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, I anchored, and ſent off an officer, to deſire them to inſtruct us how to behave our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this port, and to acquaint me with the cuſtoms of it. To this they anſwered, that, ſince the Cadogan and Frances, two European Engliſh ſhips were lying at Wampo, they would adviſe me to ſend up to their factories at Canton, to acquaint them of our arrival, and with the reaſons which obliged me to come into that river, which I accordingly did the next day. I now thought I was going to reſt a little from my labours; but, to my misfortune, I ſuffered as much here, all circumſtances conſidered, as
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0204000302:248"/>
I had in any former part of my voyage; for the evening we anchored at Wampo, where the Engliſh ſhips commonly lie, there happened an accident which gave occaſion to much trouble. One of my men, being in a hurry to remove his effects on board the Bonita, in order to go in her to Fort St. George, the Bonita's boat was, in her way to their ſhip, purſued by a Hoppo, or cuſtom-houſe boat, who wanted to ſearch her. The fellow, being in liquor, and fearing they would take away the ſilver he had with him, fired a muſquet at the purſuers, and killed the officer. Early the next morning, the corpſe was laid at the door of one of the Engliſh houſes or factories, where Chineſe officers, appointed for that purpoſe, waited for the firſt conſiderable Engliſhman that ſhould come out, without any regard to whom this act of violence and murder was to be imputed. It happened that the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cargo belonging to the Bonita, was the firſt that came out; on him they ſeized, put him in chains, and led him, by way of example, about the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of Canton. All that could be ſaid or done by the moſt conſiderable of the Chineſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants who were in commerce with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, availed nothing; till my man, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the fact, was delivered to them, and then the Bonita's Supercargo was ſoon after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed.</p>
            <p>It is the cuſtom in China, at leaſt at Canton, to exact a certain ſum of money from all ſhips that come there, according to their meaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is divided into rates or portions of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0204000302:249"/>
firſt, ſecond, and third. I therefore every day expected the Hoppo to come to meaſure my ſhip, but was given to underſtand, that I muſt go up to Canton before that could be done, though even at the hazard of my life. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly went, and ſtaid two days at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogan's factory, during which time I was hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alarmed by ſuch ſtories as made me fear that I ſhould, indiſpoſed as I was, be dragged away from my bed, and put in irons: but at the end of two days, I was obliged to go down again to the ſhip, to be preſent at the meaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and a day afterwards the Hoppo came with a numerous retinue, and ſeemed to do his buſineſs very quietly, but would not let me know what was the ſum he intended to exact. This gave me much trouble, for I began to think the Chineſe, through a falſe report of our great riches, had an intention to gratify their love of money by a heavy impoſition; and in this I was not miſtaken.</p>
            <p>I had not been here many days before I was deſerted by all my officers and ſhip's company, who were continually employed in removing their effects from on board my ſhip to ſome of the Europeans, without my knowledge, as I was all the time confined to my bed. My officers were engaging the Indian gentlemen in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and had left me and my ſon, with a few negroes, to look after the ſhip. In ſhort, my ſhip's company had ſo many ways of diſpoſing of their effects, that it was impoſſible to oblige
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0204000302:250"/>
them to do what I ſhould have thought juſtice to the gentlemen in England and to myſelf. In a word, they were all ſoon recovered of their il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the aſſiſtance they met with here, and were become their own maſters. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who preſided over the trade, ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered our caſe, that they had half a mind to refuſe me a paſſage in one of their ſhips; and, in effect, I was treated by them almoſt as one enemy might treat another in a neutral port.</p>
            <p>The Captains Hill and Newſham, when they firſt came to ſee me, were aſtoniſhed at the ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appearance of my ſhip; and when I had given them a ſhort hiſtory of my voyage, and deſired they would receive me with my effects, they anſwered, that, ſince they plainly ſaw my ſhip was in no condition to ſtir any farther, upon paying our paſſage, they would entertain us as ſoon as we pleaſed. This I depended upon, and expected to have no farther trouble than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ourſelves at any time; but, on the contrary, I found that I had ignorantly applied to the wrong perſons, and that my addreſs ſhould have been to the Supercargoes, by which means I was left neglected, while the Engliſh Captains were ordered to fall down with their ſhips five or ſix miles below us. Thus was I left deſtitute in the company of five foreign ſhips, who, perceiving my own countrymen to be ſo careleſs of me, were ſo kind as to offer me their ſervice, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted me with what they could; and, had it not been for them, I don't know what I might have
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0204000302:251"/>
ſuffered, for I was under perpetual alarms that the Chineſe had a deſign to chop my ſhip, that is, to ſeize her.</p>
            <p>Having found out my error in applying to the Captains, and not to the Supercargoes, I ſent up a letter to them, not to deſire, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a paſſage for me, my officers, and ſhip's company, which I was ſenſible they could not refuſe, and indeed they did not; but their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion was accompanied with a charge to the Engliſh Captains, not to receive any thing belonging to us, except it was conſigned to the India Company in England. This was an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle which my people utterly rejected, vowing they would as ſoon throw what they had into the ſea, as comply with ſuch a demand; for my part, it gave me no concern, being conſcious to myſelf that I had infringed none of their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges. At the ſame time that I was acquainted with this intention of receiving us as paſſengers, I was alſo informed of the Hoppo's demand for anchorage in the river, which was no leſs than 6000 tahel; and, to quicken me in the payment of this exorbitant ſum, there was a penalty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to this extortion of 500 additional tahel for every day we failed in the payment of it. In ſhort, there was no means by which I could evade this unconſcionable impoſition; and as it was a day before I could poſſibly ſend the 6000 tahel up to Canton, they required 500 tahel more for neglect of payment; ſo that they received from me, upon this extraordinary occaſion, the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0204000302:252"/>
full ſum of 6500 tahel, equal to 2166l. 13s. 4d. Engliſh money. This was, as is apprehended, about ſix times as much as the Cadogan paid, which was the largeſt Engliſh ſhip there, and meaſured a third more than mine. It was now high time to get out of my ſhip; but before I quitted her, I ſold her for 2000 tahel, which money, and the reſt of my effects, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the India Company.</p>
            <p>Towards the latter end of December, 1722, I ſailed in the Cadogan, commanded by Captain John Hill, in company with the Frances, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Newſham, who, ſailing better than we, left us as ſoon as we were out at ſea. Captain Hill, finding his ſhip very tender, put into Batavia, where we continued about 10 days, and were informed there were ſeveral pirates in thoſe ſeas; we, therefore, when we departed from Batavia, joined the Dutch homeward-bound fleet in Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam-bay. The Dutch Commodore promiſed to aſſiſt us in wooding and watering at Mew-iſland, the water at Batavia being very bad; but on our joining Capt. Newſham in the ſtraits of Sunda, the Dutch made that a pretence to leave us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we got the length of Mew-iſland; and Capt. Newſham alſo deſerted us the ſame evening, ſo that we were left to ourſelves.</p>
            <p>We continued at Mew-iſland ſix or ſeven days, during which time ſeveral boats came to us from Princes iſland, and brought us turtle, cocoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, pine-apples, and other fruits.</p>
            <p>Some of the people having ſeen wild cattle
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0204000302:253"/>
grazing near the ſtrand, went on ſhore with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to kill them; but before they had advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near enough, they diſcovered a ſmall tyger, and ſaw the track of an old one, upon which they retired to the boat. At this place ſome of the gentlemen belonging to this ſhip, in their outward-bound paſſage, ſaw a rhinoceros.</p>
            <p>From Mew-iſland we had a very pleaſant paſſage to and about the Cape of Good Hope, which, in my opinion, was greatly owing to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Hill's good conduct, in coming in with the land betimes, I mean upon the eaſternmoſt part of the bank, and keeping a moderate diſtance from the land. I cannot be poſitive, but I think we never exceeded a degree in diſtance from it, generally leſs, and ſometimes even made the land itſelf.</p>
            <p>In this courſe, I do not remember that we took in our top-ſails above twice; once for a ſquall, which was over in an hour's time: and, another time, being threatened by the appearance of bad weather, Capt. Hill made all the requiſite pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to receive it, which done, he ſtood in for the land; and, in a few hours, we had fair weather, a favourable gale, and all our ſmall ſails ſet, at the ſame time that there remained great appearance of foul weather to the ſouthward of us, which continued for ſeveral days afterwards.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved before, that the Frances and the Dutch ſhips had ſeven days the advantage of us, by leaving us in the ſtraits of Sunda, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, we gained the Cape about
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0204000302:254"/>
as many days before the Frances, although ſhe ſailed ſo much better than we: and, as to the Dutch ſhips, there was no appearance at all of their arrival when we left the Cape.</p>
            <p>The officers of our ſhip, by comparing their accounts with thoſe of ſome of the Gentlemen belonging to the Frances, found that ſhe had ſuffered a great deal of bad weather; whilſt we, who were 10 leagues, or thereabout, to the northward of them, or nearer the ſhore, enjoyed fine pleaſant weather and fair wind continually, till we arrived in the Table-bay, which we did the latter end of March. This I ſhould think of ſufficient weight for any other to purſue the ſame track. Here we found Governor Boon, in the London Eaſt Indiaman, and others, bound for England.</p>
            <p>Whilſt we lay at the Cape of Good Hope, nothing remarkable occurred, and it has been ſo often deſcribed, that I can ſay nothing of it that has not been ſaid by moſt who have been there before.</p>
            <p>From the Cape of Good Hope we had an agreeable paſſage to the iſland of St. Helena, and from thence to England.</p>
            <p>We made the Land's-end in the latter end of July; and, being come into the Britiſh channel, met with briſk gales from the weſtern quarter, with thick foggy weather.</p>
            <p>On July the 30th, in the evening, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored under Dungeneſs, and the ſame night ſome of the Supercargoes and paſſengers, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0204000302:255"/>
amongſt the reſt myſelf, hired a ſmall veſſel to carry us to Dover, where we arrived early the next morning, and the ſame day proceeded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards London, where we arrived on the firſt of Auguſt.</p>
            <p>Thus ended a long and unfortunate voyage of three years, ſeven months, and ſome days; after having ſailed very conſiderably more than round the circumference of the earth, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone through a great variety of dangers and diſtreſſes, both on ſea and ſhore.</p>

            <head>COMMODORE ANSON's VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD.</head>
            <p>WHEN, in the year 1739, the Spaniſh depredations had rouſed the national reſentment, and the pacific miniſtry who then were entruſted with the adminiſtration of affairs, found it impoſſible any longer to prevent a war with Spain, ſeveral projects were propoſed, and ſeveral plans formed, for diſtreſſing the enemy in the moſt effectual manner, by cutting off the reſources by which alone they were encouraged to continue their inſults, and by which alone they could be enabled to ſupport a war.</p>
            <p>Among the reſt, two expeditions were planned by Sir Charles Wager, then at the head of the admiralty, and two gentlemen named by him for carrying them into execution; which were no ſooner laid before the privy council to be examined than they were unanimouſly approved.</p>
            <p>Captain Anſon, who was nominated to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the one, being out upon a cruiſe, a veſſel was diſpatched to order him to return with his ſhip, the Centurion, to Portſmouth; and Mr. Cornwall, who was appointed to command the other, was acquainted with the honour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him, and directed to prepare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0204000302:257"/>There are not to be found in the annals of Britain two expeditions, remote in the deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet having a connection one with the other, that promiſed equal advantages with theſe to the nation, equal honour to the promoters, or equal wealth and glory to the commanders: but by what fatality theſe expeditions were changed, or by what ſtate-craft one came to be laid aſide, and the other delayed,—who were the traitors that betrayed the ſecret of their deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or who the demon of ſeduction was that perverted the grand deſign to the pitiful purpoſe of one ſingle pilfering project,—remains at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent among thoſe ſecrets, which, perhaps, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Dalrymple, in ſome remote period of time, may diſcover; when it will probably appear how much the influence of Chilian gold had operated in defeating the moſt formidable project for the humiliation of Spain that ever was deviſed; and how eaſy it is for a prime miniſter of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in the plenitude of power, to defeat the beſt concerted meaſures, backed and ſupported by the King in his council, when either pride, envy, avarice, or emulation, may prompt him to oppoſition.</p>
            <p>The project, as firſt intended, was to conſiſt of two ſtrong ſquadrons; one under Captain Anſon was to take on board three independent companies of 100 men each, and Bland's regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of foot (who was himſelf to command the land forces), and was to ſail with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible expedition by the Cape of Good Hope to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0204000302:258"/>
the city of Manilla, in the iſland of Luconia, of which city and iſland frequent mention has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been made in the courſe of this work; while that commanded by Captain Cornwall, of equal force, was to proceed round Cape Horn into the South Seas, there to range the coaſts of Chili, Peru, and Mexico; and when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief had made himſelf maſter of the royal treaſures in that quarter, he was then to direct his courſe to the Philippines, and join the ſquadron of Captain Anſon. This done, they were to act in conjunction, as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhould ariſe, or to wait for freſh orders from Government to proceed on freſh enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes. The reader will perceive, at firſt view, the vaſt importance of this noble undertaking, calculated at once to enrich the nation, and to determine the war without the effuſion of much blood; for the places intended to be attacked were at that time incapable of reſiſtance; and as they were in poſſeſſion of the royal treaſures, any failure in the return of which muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity oblige Spain to ſue for peace, that haughty nation muſt thus have been ſubdued without a battle. But poſterity will ſtand amazed when they are told the iſſue of this project, on which Sir Charles Wager was ſo intent, that, tho' it was the 10th of September before Captain Anſon arrived in town, yet by the 18th he had received orders to take under his command the Argyle, Severn, Pearl, Wager, and Trial ſloop, and to proceed to victual the ſame with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0204000302:259"/>
moſt expedition. Before the end of December ſuch diſpatch had been made by that vigilant officer, that the ſhips were in readineſs to take the troops on board; but in January, when Captain Anſon attended the Board to receive further orders, he was told by Sir Charles, that the Manilla expedition was laid aſide, for what reaſons he knew not, but that the expedition to the South Seas was ſtill intended; and that he and his ſquadron, as their firſt deſtination was now countermanded, ſhould be employed in that ſervice.</p>
            <p>Accordingly on the 10th of January, 1740, he received his commiſſion as Commodore; yet it was not till the 10th of June that he obtained from the Duke of Newcaſtle his Majeſty's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions; and even then ſo many obſtacles were thrown in the way, ſo many difficulties ſtarted, and ſo many delays contrived, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was permitted to ſail, which was not till the latter end of September, the Spaniards were ſo well informed of his deſigns, that a perſon who had been employed in the South-Sea Company's ſervice, arrived from Panama, and was able to relate to the Commodore moſt of the particulars of his ſtrength and deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from what he had learnt among the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants before he left the South-Seas: but a ſtill more extraordinary proof of their early and perfect intelligence was diſcovered afterwards, in the courſe of the voyage, when the Pearl, being ſeparated from the reſt of the ſquadron,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0204000302:260"/>
in a ſtorm, on the coaſt of Brazil, fell in with the Spaniſh fleet, that, during the unprecedented de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, had been purpoſely fitted out to ruin the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and found Admiral Piſarro ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the form and make of Com. Anſon's broad pendant, and thoſe he employed had imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated it ſo exactly, that Capt. Mitchell, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Pearl, was decoyed by it within gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, before he was able to diſcover his miſtake.</p>
            <p>All delays being at length overcome, the ſquadron, conſiſting of five men of war, a ſloop of war, and two victualling ſhips, namely, the Centurion, of 60 guns, 400 men, commanded by Captain Anſon, as Commodore; the Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, of 50 guns, 300 men, of which Richard Norris, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was commander; the Severn, of 50 guns, 300 men, the Hon. Edward Legg, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Commander; the Pearl, of 40 guns, 250 men, Matthew Mitchell, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Commander; the Wager, of 28 guns, 160 men, the Hon. John Murray, Commander; two victuallers, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Ann pinks, the largeſt of about 400, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ther about 200 tons burthen; were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to take the troops on board at St. Helen's. But how much the numbers, ſtrength, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of ſucceſs, of this ſquadron, were dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the various incidents that took place in near a twelvemonth's procraſtination, may fully be conceived by what has already been ſaid. Had the honourable Board from whence the firſt idea of the expedition originated been permitted to direct, all the old and ordinary
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0204000302:261"/>
ſeamen on board the ſhips would have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for ſuch as were young and able; the full complement of each ſhip would have been made up; and the ſalt proviſions which had been ſo long on board in the Channel would have been remanded on ſhore, and freſh provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions replaced in their room: but, inſtead of theſe neceſſary precautions, the Captains were glad to retain their old crews; the deficiency in the numbers of which, amounting to more than 300 men, was no otherwiſe made up than by ſending on board about 100 cripples from the hoſpitals, and a party of raw marines who had never been at ſea before: nor were they more fortunate in the change that was made in the land forces; for, inſtead of three indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent companies, of 100 men each, and Bland's regiment of foot, as firſt promiſed, they had only 400 invalids from Chelſea allotted them, one part of whom was incapable of action by their age and infirmities, and the other part uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by their ignorance of their duty. But this diminution of ſtrength was not the greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune that attended theſe meaſures; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the time which was wilfully waſted was in its conſequences the ſource of all thoſe calamities to which the enterprize was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards expoſed, by obliging the Commodore to make his paſſage round the Cape in the moſt tempeſtuous ſeaſon, when, as it was foreſeen, almoſt all the invalids, to a man, periſhed long before they arrived at the place of action, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0204000302:262"/>
in a moſt lamentable condition when they came to be attacked with the ſcurvy, with their wounds bleeding afreſh, which had been healed ſome of them 20, ſome 30, and ſome 40 years before.</p>
            <p>But to proceed: Of this voyage there are two very authentic and well-written accounts; one by Paſco Thomas, the mathematical maſter on board the Centurion, who ſailed in her out of the Britiſh Channel, and returned with her in ſafety when ſhe arrived at Portſmouth, and was an eye-witneſs and careful obſerver of all that paſſed: the other by the Rev. Mr. Richard Walters, Chaplain to the above ſhip, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his materials, and every other aſſiſtance neceſſary to authenticate his narration, from the Commander in Chief.</p>
            <p>We have choſen to follow the former in the narrative of facts, as moſt exact and leaſt liable to impoſition; but, in the explanatory part, we ſhall copy the latter; becauſe, though Mr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas ſuffered nothing material that paſſed to eſcape his notice, there were many things tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacted, the motives for which he could only gueſs at; but theſe motives Mr. Walters has, by means of the Commodore's aſſiſtance, been able to explain.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">
                  <p>"Being quite ready about the beginning of September, 1740, we put to ſea three different times, but were as often put back to the road of St. Helen's, by contrary winds and ſtormy weather. At laſt, on Thurſday, Sept. 18, we
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0204000302:263"/>
ſailed in company with the Lark and St. Alban's, two of his Majeſty's ſhips, and ſeveral merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, beſides our own ſquadron; and Saturday evening ſaw ſome men-of-war, and a large fleet of merchantmen, waiting for us at Torbay. At one in the afternoon we joined them; and the Commodore hoiſted his broad pendant, which was ſaluted by all his Majeſty's ſhips in the fleet with 13 guns each. The King's ſhips which joined us here were, the Dragon, Chatham, Wincheſter, and South-Sea-Caſtle, and near 200 ſail of merchantmen under convoy, ſome of whom were bound to the Mediterranean, and others to ſeveral parts of North America. We had at preſent the command of the whole fleet; and this ſame afternoon, ſeeing a ſhip to the ſouth-weſt, we made the Dragon a ſignal for chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her; but ſhe proved one of our own ſhips, too far a-head of her ſtation. At four this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, the Start Point bore from us E. by N. at the diſtance of eight leagues.</p>
                  <p>Monday the 22d, we ſaw two ſail to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſent the Trial Sloop to ſpeak with them. They were Dutch ſhips bound to Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoe, with ſoldiers for their garriſons there.</p>
                  <p>Thurſday the 25th, the Wincheſter and South-Sea-Caſtle, with the merchant-ſhips under their convoy for Virginia, and other parts of North-America, parted from us, and proceeded on their reſpective voyages. And Monday the 29th, the Dragon, Chatham, St. Alban's, and Lark, with the merchant-ſhips in their charge for the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0204000302:264"/>
Mediterranean, did the like; and we had now no ſhips left in company but our own proper ſquadron.</p>
                  <p>Tueſday the 30th, we ſpoke with a Dutch man-of-war, who came from Malta, bound for Amſterdam.</p>
                  <p>Friday, October the 3d, we ſpoke with two Engliſh merchant-ſhips from Liſbon for New-York, and the 8th we ſpoke with a French ſloop from Rochelle. The 13th, one Philip Merrit, a common ſailor, died, which I mention becauſe he was the firſt man we loſt on the voyage. The next day, by an order from the Commodore, we went to ſhort allowance; that is, one third of the allowance granted by government is kept back, in order to make our proviſions hold out the longer. The 23d, we ſpoke with a ſhip from Liverpool, and the next day with another from Glaſgow, for the Cape de Verde iſlands; as alſo with a ſmall brigantine from Falmouth for Madeira, who kept us company thither. The next day we ſpoke with a Dutch ſhip from Surinam for Holland. The 26th, at 6 o'clock in the morning, we ſaw the land bearing W. N. W. diſtance ſix leagues, and at four in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anchored in Fonchale road, in forty fathom water, a-breaſt the town of Fonchale, and about a mile and a half from it. During this whole paſſage, we had almoſt continually contrary wind, and boiſterous uncertain weather; by which means, a paſſage which is very common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made in 10 or 12 days, took us up 38.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0204000302:265"/>Our buſineſs in this place was only to water, and take in wine, and ſome private ſtocks: but, ſoon after our arrival, we were informed, that they had ſeen from the iſland, to the weſtward, about 16 or 18 ſail of ſhips for ſeveral days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which were ſuppoſed to be a junction of French and Spaniſh Ships of war; and as we had reaſon to imagine that our expedition had long been known, there was little room to doubt, but that thoſe ſhips were deſigned to intercept and deſtroy us before we could attempt any thing to the prejudice of Spain. On this news the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore ſent out an Engliſh privateer which lay in the road, with one of his own officers, to ſee if they could diſcover them at ſea, and what they were; but ſhe returned the next day, having made no diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>Nov. 2, Captain Norris, at his own requeſt, being in an ill ſtate of health, with the conſent of the Commodore quitted the command of the Glouceſter, in order to return to England. The Glouceſter was hereupon given to Captain Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel, the Pearl to Captain Kidd, the Wager to the Hon. Captain Murray, and the Trial ſloop to David Cheap, our Firſt Lieutenant; and as one of the Lieutenants of the Glouceſter had quitted with Captain Norris, our two mates, who had long depended on the Commodore, were preferred to be Lieutenants on this occaſion.</p>
                  <p>The 4th, at four in the afternoon, we weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and put to ſea, with all the ſquadron under
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0204000302:266"/>
our command. An Engliſh ſloop, which lay in the road, ſaluted us at our departure with nine guns, to which we returned five.</p>
                  <p>The 6th, at four o'clock in the evening, we ſaw the iſland of Palma, one of the Canary iſlands, in the latitude of 29 degrees north, and longitude from the meridian of London 19 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees 44 minutes weſt. The ſame day we ſpoke with a French ſhip from Marſeilles bound to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinico, and the next morning with a Dutch ſhip from Amſterdam bound to Batavia, the metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis of the Dutch ſettlements in the Eaſt-Indies.</p>
                  <p>The 11th, about four in the morning, we croſſed the Northern Tropic for the firſt time in this voyage, in long. 24 deg. 24 min. weſt from London.</p>
                  <p>The 16th, being in the latitude of about 12 deg. 20 min. and the contract with our victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers expiring in that latitude, the Anne Pink fired a gun, and hoiſted a red flag at her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top maſt-head, to give us notice of it.</p>
                  <p>On the next day all the Lieutenants of the ſquadron were by a ſignal ordered on board the Centurion, and orders were given to unlade the Induſtry Pink, and each ſhip to take on board from her their reſpective quotas of proviſions; in purſuance of which we immediately began to unlade her, lying by in the day, and making an eaſy ſail in the night.</p>
                  <p>The 19th, having unloaded and diſcharged the Induſtry, at eight in the evening ſhe parted
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0204000302:267"/>
from us, in order to proceed to Barbadoes, whither ſhe was bound; but the Commodore having entered into a new contract with the maſter of the Anne pink, ſhe was detained with us for his Majeſty's ſervice, our ſhips being too much encumbered to admit of taking on board any more proviſions at this time.</p>
                  <p>The 28th, about five in the morning, we croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Equinoctial, in the longitude of 28 deg. 15 min. W. from London, the variation of the compaſs at that place being 35 min. E.</p>
                  <p>December the 2d, at eight in the morning, we ſaw a ſail to the north-weſt, to which we gave chace. At night we loſt ſight of her; but next morning we ſaw her and gave chace again, but in the afternoon quitted her. We imagined this ſail to be a tender on the Spaniſh fleet, ſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to get intelligence of us: but on our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at the Cape of Good Hope, in our return home, we learned that ſhe was the Eaſt-India-Company's packet bound for the iſland of St. Helena.</p>
                  <p>The 10th, expecting to be near the coaſt of Brazil, we ſounded, and found 67 fathom water, on which we fired a gun for a ſignal, and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our courſe more to the ſouthward. This day died Thomas Waller, our ſurgeon, who was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by Henry Ettrick, ſurgeon of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; the ſurgeon of the Trial ſucceeded him, and Joſeph Allen, our ſurgeon's firſt mate, was made ſurgeon of the trial.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0204000302:268"/>The 11th, we ſpoke with a Portugueſe bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantine from Rio Janeiro, bound to Santos, one of the principal Portugueſe ſettlements in the Brazils. The 13th, we croſſed the South Tropic for the firſt time, in long. 38 deg. 36 min. W. from London.</p>
                  <p>The 14th died Robert Welden, our purſer, who was ſucceeded by John Rule, purſer of the Wager, and Commodore's Secretary; Thomas Harvey, one of our midſhipmen, was made pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of the Wager, in the room of Mr. Rule.</p>
                  <p>The 17th, we ſaw the land of the Brazils, from W. to W. S. W. very mountainous, and full of woods. I have, for ſeveral days laſt paſt, found, by my obſervations, a ſtrong current on this coaſt, ſetting to the ſouthward near three quarters of a mile an hour, which, perhaps, may be occaſioned by the neighbourhood of the vaſt river of Rio de la Plata; another obſervation, which I ſhall have occaſion to make after our leaving the coaſt of Brazil, will very much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate this conjecture.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day, at four in the evening, we had 40 fathom of water, muddy ground; the iſland of Alvoredo, a ſmall iſland at the north-eaſt end of the large iſland of St. Katharine's, then bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing N. W. by N. about eight leagues diſtant; and the next day at ſeven in the evening we came to an anchor in twelve fathom water, the north-eaſt end of St Catharine's bearing S. S. W. about three miles diſtant, and the iſland of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voredo, N. N. E. about ſix miles diſtant. Here
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0204000302:269"/>
we found the tide to ſet S. S. E. and N. N. W. We ſent aſhore a Lieutenant to the fort to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment the Governor, and to deſire a pilot to carry us into the road. The Governor returned a very civil anſwer, and granted our requeſt. The next morning we weighed and ran up the harbour, and about noon anchored in five fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom and a half water, in a place they there call Boon Porto; but being ſtill too far from the watering-place, we on the 20th, about ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the morning, weighed and ran farther up between St. Katherine's and the main land of Brazil, and in the afternoon anchored and moored in five fathom water, about two miles from the watering-place; and the ſame even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our third Lieutenant went aſhore with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for building a tent, to ſhelter the people who were to be employed in watering. We likewiſe ſaluted the Portugueſe fort with eleven guns, who returned us the like number.</p>
                  <p>Our ſhips beginning to be very ſickly, tents were erected on ſhore, one for every ſhip, and the ſick were ſent aſhore to them, with ſurgeons and proper attendance.</p>
                  <p>The agents for victualling, of which we had two with us, were ordered to procure what freſh proviſions we could expend during our ſtay here, which they accordingly did; but though their meat, which is altogether beef, was both cheap and plenty, it was for the greateſt part miſerably bad, and ſcarce fit to be eaten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0204000302:270"/>The men throughout the whole ſquadron be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan now to drop off apace with fevers and fluxes, occaſioned chiefly, I believe, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heat of the climate, and the bad air; the country being ſo very woody that the air muſt thereby be ſtagnated, and rendered unhealthful.</p>
                  <p>We continued here wooding, watering, and overhauling our rigging, till Sunday, Jan. 18, 1741, during which time we had variable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain weather, ſometimes ſea and land breezes, at other times ſtrong gales of wind, with heavy rain, thunder and lightning, but always exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive heat.</p>
                  <p>While we lay here, we gave our ſhip a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough cleanſing, ſmoaked her between decks, in order to deſtroy the vermin, and waſhed every part with vinegar, which I mention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is abſolutely neceſſary in large ſhips, the ſtench of ſo many ſick perſons being noiſome in hot climates.</p>
                  <p>Dec. 21, I obſerved an eclipſe of the moon, and by comparing the time of the end of it, with a calculation I purpoſely made of it in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of London, from Sir Iſaac Newton's New Theory of the Moon, I found the place where the ſhip then lay to be 49 deg. 53 min. to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the meridian of London. The calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion itſelf, and the time it ended at St. Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine's, I have unfortunately loſt; but as the longitude is thereby ſettled, they are of no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe, and not worth retrieving at the trouble of a new calculation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0204000302:271"/>Before we arrived at this iſland, we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the deſcriptions of M. Frezier, a French author, and ſome other perſons who had been on the ſpot, ſuch accounts as, together with the climate in which it is ſituated, gave us very great ideas of its fruitfulneſs, and hopes of a plentiful ſupply of every thing we wanted for a long run; but we found ourſelves miſerably miſtaken in almoſt every article we expected.</p>
                  <p>As here are ſeveral fine ſandy bays, we had very good fiſhing with a ſeine, for mullets, old wives, ſting-rays, maids, turbots, and other flat fiſh, ſilver fiſh, baſs, a very boney long fiſh like a baſs, but which our ſeamen call a ten-pounder, and ſome other ſorts. We likewiſe had freſh beef for preſent expending plenty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but ſcarce better than the carrion that we gave to our dogs. As for lemons, limes, plantains, bananaes, potatoes, and other roots, fruits, and greens, with which thoſe climates generally abound, which the authors above mentioned aver to be extremely plentiful here, and which we principally depended on for ſea-ſtores, there were ſo few at the time of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here, that I believe we could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed all that came to our knowledge of thoſe things in one day. The officers, however, no doubt, found plenty; as Mr. Walters agrees in his report with Frezier, that there was no want of pine-apples, peaches, grapes, lemons, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, melons, apricots, and adds, there were beſides potatoes and onions for ſea-ſtores. Saſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafraſs
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0204000302:272"/>
is here in great plenty, and we cut much of it among other wood for fuel. Guaiacum they report to be very plenty here likewiſe, but I ſaw none of it, nor heard of any perſon who did during our ſtay. Rum and ſugar they have in ſmall quantities, but very indifferent and dear. The inhabitants are a mixture of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe and Indians incorporated together, and appear to be very poor, idle, lazy, ignorant, and rude. I believe the original of the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe here was chiefly from felons, who fled hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from other parts of the Brazils to ſhelter themſelves from juſtice; they never till lately having any government among them, except a Chief choſen from among themſelves, who was more like a Captain of thieves and robbers, than the Commander of a colony. At preſent there are ſome European Soldiers, and a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor from Rio Janeiro, whoſe name was Don Joſſe Sylva de Paz, an expert engineer, who, as Mr. Walters obſerves, underſtood one branch of his buſineſs very well, which is the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which new works bring to thoſe who are entruſted with the care of erecting them; for, beſides a battery on a neck of land that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows the channel to a little more than a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a mile, there were three other forts car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on for the defence of the harbour, none of which were then compleated.</p>
                  <p>The country, both the main and the iſland, is mountainous, and all over-grown with thick
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0204000302:273"/>
woods, and thoſe ſo entangled with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growth of thorny briars, brambles, and the like, that in moſt places they are ſcarce penetrable. Theſe woods are reported to be full of very fierce tygers, which makes any excurſions into the country dangerous, unleſs you go well arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and even then much caution is neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>They have here ſome hogs and fowls, but I believe not very plenty; and in the woods are monkeys, apes, armadilloes, and other wild creatures unknown to me; as alſo parrots, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roquets, and many other ſorts of birds proper to the climate. Alligators are ſaid to be plenty near the ſhores and in the lakes, but we ſaw none of them.</p>
                  <p>The country appears to me to be a good ſoil, and very capable of improvement, were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants more civilized and induſtrious.</p>
                  <p>This iſland lies in latitude 27 deg. 30 min. S. longitude, as before determined, 49 deg. 53 min. W. from London; and the variation of the compaſs 11 deg. 20 min. eaſterly.</p>
                  <p>Dec. 27, we diſcovered a ſail in the offing, and the eighteen-oar'd barge was manned, and armed, and ſent, under the command of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Lieutenant of the Centurion, to examine her before ſhe arrived within the protection of the fort. She proved to be a Portugueſe bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantine from Rio Grande; but, though the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer behaved to the maſter with the utmoſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, yet the Governor took offence at our ſending our boat, complained of the violation of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0204000302:274"/>
the peace, and made that a pretence for ſending Don Piſarro the moſt circumſtantial intelligence of our force and condition, as we afterwards found by letters intercepted in the South Seas.</p>
                  <p>January 18, 1741, we left this iſland, having had a melancholy proof how much the healthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this place had been over-rated by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer writers; for we found, that, though the Centurion alone had buried no leſs than 28 men ſince our arrival, the number of the ſick in the ſame interval had increaſed to 96; and this very day we had three men die.</p>
                  <p>Before our departure the Commodore took every precaution to prevent a ſeparation; but conſidering that, in ſuch boiſterous ſeas as we were about to encounter, he himſelf might be diſabled, he called the officers together, and in a full council ſo ordered it, that, if but one ſhip eſcaped, the expedition ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned. Proper places of rendezvous were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; the time was ſettled for ſtaying at theſe places; and, if the Commodore did not arrive in that time, the Captains were ordered to put themſelves under the command of the ſenior, and to proceed without farther delay.</p>
                  <p>The 22d in the morning, we had very ſtormy weather, with ſome thunder, lightning, and rain; and the Trial carried away the head of her main-maſt. A thick fog ſucceeding, we lay to, and ſoon after loſt ſight of the Pearl, the Trial, and the Anne pink. In the afternoon we got ſight of and joined company with the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0204000302:275"/>
Trial and the Anne, but the Pearl was ſtill miſſing.</p>
                  <p>From hence to February the 13th, very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable weather, moſtly foggy, from latitude 35, or thereabouts, to latitude 39; the reſt a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not much unlike our weather in England in the month of October, except that we had pretty often thunder and lightning, which are not ſo frequent with us in that month. Being paſt the latitude of 36 degrees to the ſouthward, I obſerved the current, which had hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſet ſoutherly, now on the contrary, ſet to the northward; and the great river of Rio de la Plata being ſituated in between 35 and 36 degrees ſouth, ſtrengthens my conjecture that thoſe currents are occaſioned by the flux and reflux of that mighty river.</p>
                  <p>February 13, we ſaw the land from S. by W. to S. half E. appearing plain, with very few riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and of a very moderate height, our ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at that time from 46 to 56 fathom, the firſt mud, the latter ſtony ground. This day, at four in the evening, we were within about four miles of Cape Blanco on the coaſt of Patagonia, and in 12 fathom water; on which we hauled off, and ran along the coaſt, the ſoundings from 20 to 60 fathom water. At five the next morning we ſaw the land from W. by N. to S. W. half W. with an opening near the middle; which I believe to be the harbour of Port De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, ſo called by Sir John Narborough. The northernmoſt land in ſight is Cape Blanco,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0204000302:276"/>
and the ſouthermoſt Penguin Iſland, ſo called from the great numbers of penguins about it, of which birds Sir John's ſhip's company killed and ſalted large quantities for proviſions, and which he reports to be very good and wholeſome food. Cape Blanco is in the latitude of 47 deg. 10 min. S longit. from St. Katharine's 17 deg. 38 min. W. which makes it from London 67 deg. 20 min. W. taking the N. E. point of St. Katharine's in 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> deg. 42 min. W. to be about 11 minutes to the eaſtward of the place where the ſhip lay when I fixed it by obſervation.</p>
                  <p>The 17th, in the evening, we anchored about 17 or 18 leagues ſhort of the harbour of Port St. Julian, ſo called by Sir Francis Drake, who touched there in his voyage round the globe, and where he condemned and executed Mr. Doughty, the next perſon in command to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, on pretence of a conſpiracy to murder him and ruin the expedition; whence a ſmall iſland within the harbour is to this day called the Iſland of True Juſtice. The next morning we ſaw a ſail at S. by E. which we believing to be the Pearl, made the ſignal for the return of all cruizers; but ſhe not minding it, as I ſuppoſe not ſeeing it, we ordered the Glouceſter to chaſe, and at two in the afternoon the Glouceſter and her chace, which to our great ſatisfaction proved to be the Pearl, joined us. They informed us, that, on January the 31ſt, their Commander, Captain Dandy Kidd, died; and that on the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0204000302:277"/>
7th inſtant they were chaced by five large ſhips, which they believed to be Spaniſh men-of-war, and were ſome time within gun-ſhot of them, though they never fired a gun, having endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to decoy the Pearl by hoiſting a broad red pendant, like that of the Engliſh Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, at the Admiral's main-top-maſt head, and hoping by that means to be taken for our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore, and ſo to inveigle and make ſure of their prey; Capt. Mitchell, thus decoyed, narrowly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped them, by running through a ſpace of water, where the tides or currents making a great rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the Spaniards, who thought it was rocky and broken ground, were afraid to follow her. Theſe ſhips we ſuppoſed to be the Spaniſh ſquadron, commanded by Admiral Piſarro, the ſame who got ſo great a name among them for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in bringing home their ſlota ſafe into Port Andero the laſt year, eluding the vigilance of our ſquadrons who waited for them off Cadiz, and was therefore looked on as the propereſt perſon to be ſent to intercept us. We ſhould not have been diſpleaſed, however, to have met them with our whole force, and did not much doubt to have either deſtroyed or diſabled them. But the time of their deſtruction was not yet come; their miſerable fate ſhall be related in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>We were now, being the 18th, ſailing along ſhore for the harbour of St. Julian. I found the tide to ſet here north and ſouth, about a mile an hour. The time of flowing here on the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0204000302:278"/>
full and change days is N. E. by E. and S. W. by W. neareſt. We ſent one of our boats with an officer in-ſhore, to ſound and endeavour to diſcover the mouth of the harbour. At ſix in the evening we came to an anchor in 12 fathom water. At eight the Lieutenant returned, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found the harbour. We ſent aſhore our boats to make farther diſcoveries, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſome to get freſh water, and others to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſalt, (of which Sir J. Narborough obſerved, when he was here, that in February there was enough of it to load 1000 ſhips) for the uſe of the ſquadron in the South Seas. We continued here till the 27th, during which time we ſtove moſt of our empty caſks, in order to clear our ſhips as much as poſſible, and got up and mounted ſuch of our guns as we had before ſtruck down into the hold in order to eaſe the ſhips; for now, not knowing how ſoon we might meet with the Spaniſh ſquadron, it was neceſſary to have them all in readineſs. We could find no freſh water here, and but a very ſmall quantity of ſalt, and no other refreſhments whatever; all the country, as far as we could diſcover, being quite barren and deſolate. We got ſome proviſions out of the Anne victualler on board each of the other ſhips, repaired the Trial's maſt, and aſſiſted her and the victualler to overhaul and new-fix moſt of their rigging. Having loſt the hopes of a ſupply of water here, we were put to the allowance of one quart a man for one day, and three pints for
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0204000302:279"/>
another, alternately; but, conſidering our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage had hitherto proved extremely ſtormy and cold, and a dead time of the year coming on very faſt, it was thought proper, in order to keep the people in as good heart as poſſible, to give them whole allowance of all other provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which was ordered accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Here we farther ſecured our lower-deck guns, by nailing quoins under the trucks, in caſe the tackles, breechings, or iron-work, might give way, or fail in the ſtormy weather, which we had much reaſon to expect.</p>
                  <p>Here likewiſe the Commodore removed the Honourable Captain Murray into the Pearl, in the room of Captain Kidd; and Captain Cheap into the Wager in the room of Captain Murray. He advanced Mr. Charles Saunders, his Firſt Lieutenant, to be Commander of the Trial ſloop, in the room of Captain Cheap; and made Mr. Piercy Brett, Firſt Lieutenant of the Glouceſter, Second Lieutenant of his own ſhip. The Trial being repaired, and the Pearl, who had thrown about 14 ton of water overboard when chaced by the Spaniards, being ſupplied from the other ſhips, we made ready to proſecute our voyage.</p>
                  <p>This harbour of Port St. Julian is a barred harbour, only fit to receive ſmall ſhips and veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. We lay off in the road about two miles from the mouth of it. It is not to be ſeen open from where we lay, one point ſhutting in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and before any ſmall ſhip or veſſel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to venture into the harbour, they ought
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0204000302:280"/>
to ſend in their boats at low water, and fix poles or buoys on the ends of the ſhoals, which, in a manner, block up the paſſage. The country about it is pretty much on the level, except a few copling hillocks to the northward, and a pretty high one in the bay, which bears W.S.W. from the place where we lay at anchor. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Port St. Julian is 49 deg. 10 min. S. its longitude from London 69 deg. 48 min. W. and the variation of the compaſs 17 deg. 20 min. E. We had here uncertain boiſterous weather, with much rain, ſome ſnow, and generally thick fog, with ſo much wind and ſea as made us ride hard, and haſtened our departure from this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy ſituation.</p>
                  <p>Sir John Narborough and ſome others write, that they have often ſeen and converſed with the inhabitants in this and other parts of Patagonia, and have given wonderful deſcriptions of them; but as we ſaw none of them, I have nothing to ſay of that ſort, nor indeed do I think there is any thing in this wild part of the world worthy of the leaſt notice.</p>
                  <p>The 27th, at ſix in the morning, we made the ſignal, weighed, and put to ſea; but the Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter being long in weighing her anchor, and the weather proving thick and hazy, we ſoon loſt ſight of her, and at one in the afternoon, tacked, and lay by for her coming up; at ſeven we fired a gun, a ſignal for her, and ſoon after ſhe joined us, having broke her main-yard in the ſlings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0204000302:281"/>Previous to our leaving this port, a council was held on board the Centurion, at which all the officers by ſea and land attended, when it was propoſed by the Commodore, that their firſt attempt, after their arrival in the South Seas, ſhould be the attack of the town of Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divia, the principal frontier of the diſtrict of Chili. To this propoſition the council unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agreed; in conſequence of which, new inſtructions were given to the Captains of the ſquadron, by which they were directed, in caſe of ſeparation, to rendezvous at the iſland of Neuſtra Senoro del Secoro, and there cruiſe for 10 days; after which, they were ordered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the height of Baldivia, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 40 deg. and 40 deg. 30 min. to continue to cruiſe 14 days longer; and, if in that time they were not joined by the reſt of the ſquadron, they were then to quit that ſtation, and direct their courſe to the iſland of Juan Fernandez.</p>
                  <p>March the 4th, in the morning, we paſſed by the Streights of Magellan, ſo near that we ſaw them very plain; the northernmoſt point of which, known by the name of Cape Virgin Mary, I found to be in the latitude of 52 deg. 28 min. S. longitude from London 70 deg. 55 min. W. variation of the compaſs 18 deg. 40 min. E. the ſoundings, when it bears about S. W. by W. at the diſtance of eight leagues, from 32 to 50 fathom, the bottom black-grey ſand and mud. The afternoon of this day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very bright and clear, with ſmall breezes,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0204000302:282"/>
inclinable to calm, moſt of the Captains took the opportunity of this favourable weather to pay a viſit to the Commodore; but, while they were in company together, they were all great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alarmed by a ſudden flame which burſt out on board the Centurion, and which was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a cloud of ſmoak. However, they were ſoon relieved from their apprehenſions, by receiving information, that the blaſt was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by a ſpark of fire from the forge light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſome gunpowder, and other combuſtibles, which the officers on board were preparing for uſe, in caſe we ſhould fall in with the Spaniſh fleet; and that it had been extinguiſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger to the ſhip.</p>
                  <p>The 6th, in the morning, we ſaw the land of Terra del Fuego, conſiſting of high craggy hills, towering above each other, moſtly covered with ſnow, with deep horrid vallies, ſome few ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed trees, no plains, nor one chearful green through all the diſmal proſpect; ſo that the whole may not improperly be termed the Land of Deſolation; and I much queſtion whether a more dreary aſpect is to be ſeen in any other part of the habitable earth; for voyagers ſay this is inhabited, but ſurely its inhabitants muſt be the moſt miſerable of human beings. This evening we lay by, that we might not overſhoot the Streights of Le Maire in the night; though I believe, had we kept on, and paſſed round Staten Land, a ſmall iſland or two, which lie to the eaſtward of thoſe Streights, and together
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0204000302:283"/>
with Terra del Fuego frame them, it would have been more to our advantage than by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through them.</p>
                  <p>The 7th, at eight in the morning, we were very near a point of land on Terra del Fuego, called Cape St James, bearing E. S. E. another called Cape St. Vincent, S. E. half E. the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt of the Three Brothers, being three high hills on Terra del Fuego, appearing almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to each other, S. by W. and a very high Sugar-loaf Hill, called Monte Gorda, farther up in the country, and appearing above them, bore ſouth from us. It is by theſe marks that you know you are near Strait Le Maire; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we began to open them in this poſition. By noon we were almoſt through them, being aſſiſted by a very ſtrong tide with much rippling, and which made to the ſouthward ſomewhat before 10 o'clock in the morning. The courſe through is almoſt directly ſouth, and there are no ſhoals nor rocks in the paſſage from whence you may incur any danger; the only thing you have to fear is, the tide's turning againſt you while you are in the ſtraits, for in that caſe you are certainly hurried back again, and can have no paſſage there till the next turn of the tide. The breadth of this ſtrait may be about ſix or ſeven leagues, and its length about ſeven or eight; which being paſſed, you enter into a vaſt open ocean, commonly known by the name of the South Sea. This ſtrait lies in latitude 55 deg. ſouth, longitude from London 67 deg.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0204000302:284"/>
30 min. weſt, variation of the compaſs 21 deg. 36 min. eaſt, ſoundings in the ſtraits from 43 to 58 fathom, the bottom black ſand and peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-ſtones. In paſſing through here, our joy was increaſed by the brightneſs of the ſky and the ſerenity of the weather, which was indeed remarkably pleaſing, for though the winter was now advancing apace, yet the morning of this day, in its brilliancy and mildneſs, gave place to none we had ſeen ſince our departure from England. But we here found what was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly verified by all our obſervations in theſe high latitudes, that fair weather was ever the forerunner of a ſucceeding ſtorm, and that ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine and tempeſt followed one another like light and ſhade. We had ſcarcely reached the ſouthern extremity of the ſtraits, when the ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the ſky, which had ſo much flattered our expectations, was all at once obſcured, the wind ſhifted to the ſouthward, and the ſea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſwell to an aſtoniſhing height. Before night the tempeſt aroſe, and the tide, which had hitherto favoured us, turned furiouſly againſt us; ſo that, inſtead of purſuing our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended courſe, we were driven to the eaſtward, by the united force of wind and current, with ſo much precipitation, that in the morning we found ourſelves ſeven leagues to the eaſtward of Streight Le Maire. From this time we had ſuch a continual ſucceſſion of tempeſtuous weather as ſurprized the oldeſt and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced mariners on board, and obliged them
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0204000302:285"/>
to confeſs, that what they had hitherto called ſtorms were inconſiderable gales compared with the violence of theſe winds, which raiſed ſuch ſhort and at the ſame time ſuch mountainous waves, as greatly ſurpaſſed in danger all ſeas known in any other part of the globe: and it was not without reaſon that this unuſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance filled us with continual terror; for, had any one of theſe waves broke fairly over us, it muſt in all probability have ſent us to the bottom. Nor did we eſcape with terror only; for the ſhip rolling inceſſantly gunwale to, gave us ſuch quick and violent motions, that the men were in perpetual danger of being daſhed againſt the maſts or ſides of the ſhip: and though we were extremely careful to ſecure ourſelves from theſe ſhocks by graſping at ſome fixed body, yet many of our people were forced from their holds, ſome of whom were killed, and others greatly injured; in particular, one of our beſt ſeamen was carried over-board and drowned, another diſlocated his neck, a third was thrown into the main hold, and broke his thigh, and one of our boatſwain's mates broke his collar-bone twice; not to mention many other accidents of the ſame kind. Theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, ſo dreadful in themſelves, though unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by any other unfavourable circumſtance, were rendered more miſchievous to us by their inequality, and the deceitful intervals which they at ſome times afforded; for, though we were often obliged to lie to for days together
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0204000302:286"/>
under a reefed mizzen, and were frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to lie at the mercy of the waves under our bare poles, yet now and then we ventured to make ſail with our courſes double reefed; and the weather proving more tolerable, would perhaps encourage us to ſet our top-ſails; after which, the wind, without any previous notice, would return upon us with redoubled force, and would in an inſtant tear our ſails from the yards. And, that no circumſtance might be wanting which could aggravate our diſtreſs, theſe blaſts generally brought with them a great quantity of ſnow and ſleet, which caſed our rigging, and froze our ſails, thereby rendering them and our cordage brittle, and apt to ſnap upon the ſlighteſt ſtrain, adding inexpreſſible difficulty and labour to the working of the ſhip, benumbing the limbs of the people em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in handing the ſails, or handling the ropes, and making them incapable of exerting themſelves with their uſual activity, and even diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling many by mortifying their toes and fingers.</p>
                  <p>And now, as it were to add the finiſhing ſtroke to our misfortunes, our people began to be univerſally afflicted with that moſt terrible, obſtinate, and, at ſea, incurable diſeaſe, the ſcurvy, which quickly made a moſt dreadful havock among us, beginning at firſt to carry off two or three a day, but ſoon increaſing, and at laſt carrying off eight or ten; and as moſt of the living were very ill of the ſame diſtemper,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0204000302:287"/>
and the little remainder who preſerved their healths better, in a manner, quite worn out with inceſſant labour, I have ſometimes ſeen four or five dead bodies, ſome ſown up in their ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocks, others not, waſhing about the decks, for want of help to bury them in the ſea. But as the particulars of all the various diſaſters and ſufferings of various kinds that befel us, would be endleſs, I ſhall only mention a few.</p>
                  <p>The 10th, 11th, and 12th, very ſtormy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with ſnow and ſleet, and a very great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown ſea from the S. W.</p>
                  <p>The 15th, one William Baker fell overboard and was drowned. The 16th, the Anne pink, which had ſeparated from us the 11th in the ſtorm, again joined us, in lat. 59 deg. 20 min. S.</p>
                  <p>Part of the 17th, 18th, and 19th, very ſtrong gales, and a great rolling ſea from the N. W.</p>
                  <p>The 18th, we had again ſtrong gales of wind with extreme cold, and at midnight the main-top-ſail ſplit, and one of the ſtraps of the main dead-eyes broke.</p>
                  <p>The 23d, and part of the 24th, a moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtorm of wind, hail, and rain, with a very lofty ſea. The 23d, in the evening, we ſprung the main-top-ſail yard, and ſplit the main-ſail into rags, the greateſt part of which was blown overboard. On theſe accidents we furled all our other ſails, and lay-to under a mizzen.</p>
                  <p>The latter part of the 24th proving more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, we bent a new main-ſail, got down the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0204000302:288"/>
broken main top-ſail yard, and got up and rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged another in its place.</p>
                  <p>The 25th, it blew a very hurricane, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced us to the neceſſity of lying-to under our bare poles. As our ſhip kept the wind better than any of the reſt, we were obliged in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon to wear ſhip; in doing of which, we had no other expedient but clapping the helm a-weather, and manning the fore-ſhrouds; in the execution of which we had one of our beſt men canted overboard. We perceived, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the prodigious agitation of the waves, he ſwam very ſtrong; and it was with the utmoſt concern that we found ourſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of aſſiſting him. Indeed we were the more grieved at his unhappy fate, as we loſt ſight of him ſtruggling with the waves, and conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the manner in which he ſwam, that he might continue ſenſible for a conſiderable time longer of the horror attending his irretrievable ſituation.</p>
                  <p>The 26th being ſomewhat more moderate, we found two of our main-ſhrouds broke, which we repaired; we likewiſe bent our main-top-ſail, and made ſail.</p>
                  <p>The 30th, in the evening, the Glouceſter made a ſignal of diſtreſs; and, on ſpeaking with her, we found ſhe had broke her main-yard in the ſlings; an accident the more grievous, as it tended unavoidably to delay us in theſe inhoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable latitudes, where every moment we were in danger of periſhing. The weather proving
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0204000302:289"/>
favourable, all the carpenters were ordered on board the Glouceſter, and next day ſhe was ready to ſail.</p>
                  <p>The 3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th of April, a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtorm of wind and rain; a dreadful ſea, and very cold weather. We lowered our yards, furled our courſes, and lay by for the moſt part under a mizzen and mizzen-ſtay ſail. The 3d, about 11 o'clock at night, a raging ſea took us on the larboard quarter, where it ſtove in the quarter gallery, and ruſhed into the ſhip like a deluge. For ſome time it laid the ſhip down upon her ſide; but ſhe providentially righted again, though ſlowly; it threw down and half drowned all the people on the deck, broke one of the ſtraps of the main dead-eyes, and ſhaped a mizzen and puttock ſhroud. This was the greateſt ſea which we had encountered ſince we came into thoſe parts, and we met with but one ſuch ſtroke more in the whole voyage; two or three ſuch ſucceeding muſt certainly have ſent us to the bottom.</p>
                  <p>The 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th, continued very ſtormy and ſqually, with ſnow, hail, rain, and a large ſea; the weather continuing very cold.</p>
                  <p>The 8th, at four in the evening, the Anne pink made a ſignal of diſtreſs; and, on ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her, we found ſhe had ſprung her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtay, and the gammoning of her bowſprit. This was the more unfortunate, as none of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters were yet returned from the Glouceſter. Nor was the Anne the only ſhip that ſuffered in
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0204000302:290"/>
this ſtorm; the Wager loſt her mizzen-maſt and main-top-ſail yard, owing to the badneſs of the iron work. In this dilemma we were obliged to bear away till theſe ſhips had made all faſt.</p>
                  <p>The 10th, foggy and hazy. This afternoon the Severn and Pearl were far a-ſtern, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me to lag deſignedly. We made a very eaſy ſail all day, and lay by at night, and fired ſeveral guns as a ſignal for them to join us; the weather being pretty moderate, and the wind fair for them, they might have effected it with eaſe. By the cloſe of the evening we could but juſt ſee them, and from that time ſaw them no more. However, we heard afterwards in the South Seas, by letters taken on board ſome of the Spaniſh ſhips, of their arrival at Rio Janeiro, in the Brazils.</p>
                  <p>The 15th, the weather proved ſomewhat more moderate. At half an hour paſt one in the morning we ſaw two iſlands right a-head, at about two leagues diſtance; we immediately wore our ſhip, and ſtood off to the ſouthward. Thoſe iſlands were very unexpected, as well as unwelcome, we imagining we had been to the weſtward of all lands and iſlands of the coaſt of Terra del Fuego; but we now found our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and that there was a neceſſity of our ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther to the ſouthward, in order to get a ſufficient weſting. Thoſe iſlands I find to lie in the latitude of 54 deg. 20 min. S. longitude from London 84 deg. 10 min. W. Mr. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſuppoſes the land we fell in with on this
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0204000302:291"/>
occaſion to be Cape Noir, and a part of Terra dei Fuego.</p>
                  <p>From this time to the 23d we had nothing remarkable, the weather continuing very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and variable, with a large ſea and a very cold air; and the 21ſt, at nine at night, we were in the latitude of 60 deg. 5 min. S. being the greateſt ſouth latitude we made during the voyage.</p>
                  <p>The 23d very hard gales and ſqualls, with much rain. This evening we loſt ſight of the Glouceſter, Wager, Trial, and Anne Pink, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the remainder of our ſquadron, after the defection of the Severn and Pearl. The Wager's unfortunate cataſtrophe is well known; the others afterwards joined us at Juan Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez, as ſhall be related in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>The 24th, 25th, and 26th, the wind being moſtly fair, though ſtill blowing hard, we made pretty good runs under an eaſy ſail to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſtward. The 24th, it blew a hurricane, and the men endeavouring to hand the top-ſails, the clew-lines and bunt lines broke, and the ſheet being half flown, every ſeam in the fore-topſail was ſoon ſplit from top to bottom, and the main-topſail ſhook ſo ſtrongly in the wind, that it carried away the top lanthorn, and endangered the head of the maſt; however, at length, ſome of the moſt dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our men ventured upon the yard, and cut the ſail away cloſe to the reefs, though with the utmoſt hazard of their lives, whilſt at the ſame time the fore-topſail beat about the yard with
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0204000302:292"/>
ſo much fury that it was ſoon blown to ſhreds: nor was our attention to our topſails our ſole employment; for the mainſail blew looſe, which obliged us to lower the yard to ſecure the ſail, and the fore-yard being likewiſe lowered, we lay to under a mizen. The 25th, we found much of our running rigging broken, which we repaired. The 27th, we bent other topſails in the places of thoſe ſplit. Nothing more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable the reſt of this month and the firſt week in the next, but ſtormy uncertain wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and great ſickneſs and mortality among our people.</p>
                  <p>Friday, May 8, at ſeven in the morning, ſaw the main land of Patagonia appearing in high mountains covered moſtly with ſnow. We likewiſe ſaw ſeveral iſlands, one of which we took to be the Iſland del Soccoro, ſo called by Sir John Narborough, in his account of his voyage into thoſe parts; and from the fine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription this gentleman had given of this iſland, (having been there in the very height of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer), this place was appointed for our firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rendezvous in the South Seas. An unhappy appointment it was in its conſequences; for when the people, already reduced to the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, found this to be the place of rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, where they had hoped to meet the reſt of their companions with joy, and what a miſerable part of the world it appeared to be, their grief gave way to deſpair; they ſaw no end of their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, nor any door open to their ſafety. Thoſe
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0204000302:293"/>
who had hitherto been well and in heart, now full of deſpondency, fell down, ſickened, and died; and, to ſum up this melancholy part, I verily believe, that our touching on this coaſt, the long ſtay we made here, and our hinderance by croſs winds, which we ſhould have avoided in a direct courſe to Juan Fernandez, loſt us at leaſt 60 or 70 of as ſtout and able men as any in the navy. This unſpeakable diſtreſs was ſtill aggravated by the difficulties we found in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhip, as the ſcurvy had by this time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed no leſs than 200 of our men, and had in ſome degree affected almoſt the whole crew. It were, indeed, endleſs to recite minutely the various diſaſters, fatigues, and terrors, which we encountered on this coaſt; all theſe went on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing till the 22d of May, at which time the fury of all the ſtorms which we had hitherto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, ſeemed to be combined, and to have conſpired our deſtruction. In this hurricane al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all our ſails were ſplit, and great part of our ſtanding rigging broken; and, about eight in the evening, a mountainous overgrown ſea took us on our ſtarboard quarter, and gave us ſo prodigious a ſhock, that ſeveral of our ſhrouds broke with the jerk, by which our maſts were in danger of coming by the board; our ballaſt and ſtores too were ſo ſtrangely ſhifted, that the ſhip heeled afterwards two ſtreaks a-port. Indeed, it was a moſt tremendous blow, and we were thrown into the utmoſt conſternation, from the apprehenſion of inſtantly foundering. Our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0204000302:294"/>
ſituation allowing no longer any room for deliberation, we ſtood for the iſland of Juan Fernandez; and, to ſave time, which was now very precious, our men dying four, five, and ſix in a day, we endeavoured to hit the iſland upon a meridian courſe. On the 28th of May, being nearly in the parallel in which it is laid down, we expected to have ſeen it, and indeed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore was perſuaded that he did ſee it; but all the other officers being of opinion that it was only a cloud, to which the hazineſs of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave too much colour, we made ſail to the eaſtward, and by ſo doing loſt near 14 days in recovering our weſting again. This was a moſt fatal diſappointment; for in this run we loſt about 80 of our men, which, probably, had the Commodore's advice been attended to, would moſt of them have been ſaved.</p>
                  <p>The 8th of June, at ſix in the evening, we at length ſaw the iſland of Juan Fernandez, bearing N. by E. half E. about 15 or 16 leagues off. The 10th, at two in the morning, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored in 56 fathom, cloſe under the N. E. end of the iſland. At 10 in the morning of the 11th, we with much labour and difficulty weighed our anchor, and at noon happily moored our ſhip in the Great Bay, about a mile from the ſhore, in 52 fathom water, to our inexpreſſible joy, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been from St. Katharine's in the Brazils to this place 148 days, on ſuch a dreadful and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal paſſage as I believe very few other perſons ever experienced.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0204000302:295"/>The 11th, at two in the afternoon, the Trial ſloop appeared in the offing. We immediately ſent ſome of our hands on board her, by whoſe aſſiſtance ſhe was brought to an anchor between us and the land. We ſoon found that the ſloop had not been exempted from the like calamities which we had ſo ſeverely felt; for her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, Captain Saunders, waiting on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore, informed him, that, out of his ſmall complement, he had buried 34 of his men; and thoſe who recovered were ſo univerſally afflicted with the ſcurvy, that only himſelf, his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and three of his men, were able to ſtand by the ſails.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day we got out our long-boat, and ſent her on ſhore with materials for building tents for the ſick, and with orders to bring on board ſome water.</p>
                  <p>The 15th, we ſent our pinnace to aſſiſt the Trial, ſhe being driven from her anchors to ſea, by the violent flaws of wind which blow off the high lands. This and the next day we put aſhore 75 ſick men, in ſo weak a condition, that we were obliged to carry them out of the ſhip in their hammocks, and to convey them afterwards in the ſame manner from the water-ſide over a ſtoney beach to the tents prepared for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. In this work of humanity, not only the officers, but the Commodore himſelf, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully lent their aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>The 17th, the Trial came again to an anchor, and moored. This day and the next we ſent
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0204000302:296"/>
on ſhore the remainder of our ſick people, the whole number now on ſhore being 135, many of whom, being too far gone in the ſcurvy, died one after another to the number of not leſs than ſixty.</p>
                  <p>We now began to ſend on ſhore materials for tents for the coopers, ſail-makers, and ſome of the officers; a copper oven which we had with us for baking ſoft bread for the ſhip's company, and the ſmith's forge for making or repairing ſuch iron-work as was neceſſary: and, after a ſhort interval of relaxation, all hands were buſily employed, ſome in cutting large quantities of wood for the ſhip's uſe, ſome in making char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal for the ſmith, and for a farther ſtore; the bakers in baking bread, the coopers in making up and cleaning the caſks for water, the ſail-makers in mending the ſails and making others; ſome in fiſhing for the ſick, and the reſt were otherways employed: and here being very great plenty of fine fiſh, all taken by the hook, two or three people could never fail to take us as much in about two hours as all the ſhip's company could eat: beſides this we took great quantities for ſalting and curing; and ſome private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had hooks and lines fiſhed for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and never failed of enough for their own uſe, and to give to thoſe who had none. The people on board were employed in cleaning the ſhip, which was in a very filthy condition, and in ſtripping the maſts, and overhauling the rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. One of the boatſwain's mates, with ſome
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0204000302:297"/>
aſſiſtants, having run up a rope-walk on ſhore, was employed in making what ſmall cordage we might want; others in watering, and, in ſhort, in every thing that might contribute to put us in as good a condition, and in as ſhort a time as poſſible; and as faſt as the ſick recovered, they were put on the like employments.</p>
                  <p>At firſt ſight of this iſland, it appeared with a moſt unpromiſing aſpect, being extremely mountainous, rugged, and irregular; but, upon our nearer approach, it improved upon us; and when we were landed, we found all the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables which are uſually eſteemed to be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly adapted to the cure of thoſe ſcorbutic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders which are contracted by ſalt diet, and long continuance at ſea; for here we found wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-creſſes and purſlain, wild-ſorrel, and Sicilian-radiſhes, in profuſion. Theſe vegetables, not to mention the turneps which now abound in every plain, with the fiſh and fleſh we got here, were not only grateful to us in the extreme, but were likewiſe very refreſhing to the ſick, and contributed not a little to the recovery of thoſe who were not already too far advanced in the diſorder to admit of relief; and to the reſtoring of others to their wonted vigour, who, though not apparently under the malignancy of the diſtemper, and its baneful concomitants, were yet greatly debilitated by continual watching and anxiety of mind, from which not a ſoul on board was exempt.</p>
                  <p>During the time of our reſidence here, we
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0204000302:298"/>
found the inland parts of the iſland no ways to fall ſhort of the ſanguine prepoſſeſſions we had firſt entertained in its favour; for the woods, which covered moſt of the ſteepeſt hills, were free from all buſhes and underwood, and afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an eaſy paſſage through every part of them; and the irregularities of the hills and precipices, in the northern part of the iſland, neceſſarily traced out, by their various combinations, a great number of romantic vallies, moſt of which had a ſtream of the cleareſt water running through them, that tumbled in caſcades from rock to rock, as the bottom of the valley by the courſe of the neighbouring hills was at any time broken into a ſudden ſharp deſcent. Some particular ſpots occurred in theſe vallies, where the ſhades and fragrance of the contiguous woods, the loftineſs of the over-hanging rocks, and the tranſparency and frequent falls of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſtreams, preſented ſcenes of ſuch ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and dignity, as would with difficulty be rivalled in any other part of the globe. It is in this place, perhaps, that the ſimple productions of unaſſiſted nature may be ſaid to excel all the fictitious deſcriptions of the moſt animated ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. The ſpot where the Commodore pitched his tent, and where he choſe, during his ſtay, to fix his reſidence, exceeded in beauty any thing that words can be ſuppoſed to repreſent. It was a delightful little lawn, that lay on an eaſy aſcent at the diſtance of about half a mile from the ſea, and was probably the very ſpot on

which Shelvock twenty years before had pitched his tent. In front there was a large avenue cut through the woods to the ſea-ſide, which ſlop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the water with a gentle deſcent, opened a proſpect to the bay and the ſhips at anchor. This lawn was ſcreened behind by a tall wood of myrtle, ſweeping round it in the form of a theatre, the ſlope on which the wood ſtood riſing with a much ſharper aſcent than the lawn itſelf, though not ſo much but that the hills and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices within land towered up conſiderably above the tops of the trees, and added to the grandeur of the view. There were, beſides, two ſtreams of chryſtal water, which ran on the right and left of the tent, within an hundred yards diſtance, and were ſhaded by the trees that ſkirted the lawn on either ſide, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted the ſymmetry of the whole. Add to theſe, the gentle murmuring of the diſtant brooks, the muſic of the birds among the myrtles, the ſweet aromatic odour of the ſpice-trees that every where perfumed the air with their fragrance, and you may form in imagination a faint idea of this ſecond paradiſe, which could only be exceeded by the perfection of the firſt.</p>
                  <p>It is aſtoniſhing, that, among all the voyagers who have viſited this fortunate iſland before us, and who have obliged the world with deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, none of them have mentioned a charming little bird that, with its wild, various, and irregular notes, enchants the ear, and makes the woods reſound with its melody. This untu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0204000302:301"/>
choiriſter is ſomewhat leſs in ſize than the goldfinch, its plumage beautifully intermixed with red and other vivid colours, and the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en crown upon its head ſo bright and glowing, when ſeen in the full light of the ſun, that it ſurpaſſes all deſcription. Theſe little birds are far from being uncommon or unfamiliar; for they perched upon the branches of the myrtle-trees ſo near us, and ſung ſo chearfully, as if they had been conſcious we were ſtrangers, and came to give us welcome.</p>
                  <p>There is, beſides the above, another little bird, unnoticed by any former writer, and which ſeems likewiſe peculiar to the iſland, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently without a name; it is ſtill leſs than the former in ſize, but not inferior in beauty, tho' not ſo muſical; the back, wings, and head, are of a lively green, intermixed with fine ſhining golden ſpots, and the belly a ſnow white ground, with ebony coloured ſpots, ſo elegantly varied as no art can imitate. To the catalogue of birds mentioned by former writers as inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this iſland, ſhould alſo be added black birds and thruſhes very like thoſe in England; and owls, but of a diminutive ſize.</p>
                  <p>Of four-footed animals we ſaw none but dogs, cats, rats, and goats; and of the latter but few, as the dogs of various kinds, grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, maſtifs, pointers, ſpaniels, and mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grels, have thinned them in the plains, and driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them to the inacceſſible mountains; yet ſome
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0204000302:302"/>
were ſhot by the hunters, and were preferred by them to the beſt veniſon. Among thoſe preſented to the Commodore were two or three venerable through age, that had been marked more than thirty years before by Selkirk, who trained them for his ſport, ſlit their ears, and turned them looſe to graze the mountains.</p>
                  <p>I remember we had once an opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a remarkable diſpute betwixt a herd of thoſe animals and a number of dogs; for going in our boat into the eaſtern bay we perceived ſome dogs run very eagerly upon the foot, and being willing to diſcover what game they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we lay upon our oars ſome time to view them, and at laſt ſaw them take a hill, where, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little farther, we obſerved upon the ridge of it an herd of goats, which ſeemed drawn up for their reception. There was a very narrow path ſkirted on each ſide by precipices, in which the leader of the herd poſted himſelf fronting the enemy, the reſt of the goats being ranged behind him where the ground was more open; as this ſpot was inacceſſible by any other path, excepting where this champion had placed himſelf, the dogs, though they ran up hill with great alacrity, yet when they came within about twenty yards, found they durſt not encounter this formidable Goliah, for he would infallibly have driven the firſt that approached him down the precipice; they therefore quietly laid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves down, panting, and did not offer to ſtir while we remained in ſight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:0204000302:303"/>Theſe dogs have multiplied prodigiouſly, and have deſtroyed moſt of the cats as well as goats: the rats, however, keep poſſeſſion, and were very troubleſome gueſts in the night, when they generally paid us their viſits. It is not eaſy to determine in what manner ſuch a multitude of dogs ſubſiſt, as they are much more numerous than all the other four-footed creatures upon the iſland. Our people, indeed, were inclined to think, that they lived in a great meaſure upon the young ſea-lions and ſeals, and ſupported their opinion by the report of the ſailors, ſome of whom killed the dogs for food, who ſaid they taſted fiſhy: and, truly, there is hardly any other way of accounting for the ſubſiſtence of theſe animals; for, as has been ſaid, they have already deſtroyed all the goats in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible parts of the country; ſo that there now remain only a few among the crags and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices, where the dogs cannot follow them. Theſe are divided into ſeparate herds of 20 or 30 each, which inhabit diſtinct faſtneſſes, and never mingle with each other; by this means we found it extremely difficult to kill them, and yet we were ſo deſirous of their fleſh, that we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, I believe, all their herds, and it was thought, by comparing their numbers, that they ſcarcely exceeded 200 upon the whole iſland. The dogs had deſtroyed the pardellas, too, of which former writers have given a large ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſo that there was not one of them to be ſeen; we found indeed their boroughs in the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0204000302:304"/>
earth, which leaves no room to doubt of their being found in plenty in Selkirk's time, as well as cats, of which there is now ſcarce one alive.</p>
                  <p>Fleſh meat being thus extremely ſcarce, our people, being tired of fiſh, though excellent in their kind, at length condeſcended to eat ſeals, which, by degrees, they came to reliſh, and called them lamb. Of theſe, it being their brooding time, the numbers were incredible;—and likewiſe of the ſea-lion—theſe animals have frequently furious battles among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, principally about their females; and we were one day ſurprized by the ſight of two animals, which, at firſt, ſeemed different from all we had ever obſerved; but, on a nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, they proved to be two ſea-lions that had been goring one another with their tuſhes, and were covered with blood, with which they plentifully abound. This led us to watch them more cloſely, and one was obſerved larger than the reſt, and from his driving off other males, and keeping a great number of females to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he was by the ſeamen humorouſly ſtiled the Baſhaw. To this pre-eminence, however, he had not arrived without many bloody con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts; for, on our people's attacking him in the midſt of his ſeraglio of females, he made a deſperate defence, and, when overpowered, the ſignals of his bravery appeared in numerous ſcars on every part of his body.</p>
                  <p>We had now been ten days on this iſland, when ſome of our people from an eminence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0204000302:305"/>
a ſhip to leeward with her courſes even with the horizon, without any other ſail abroad than her main topſail; from which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it was immediately concluded, that it was one of our own ſquadron; but the weather being hazy, no definitive conjecture could be formed concerning her. She again diſappeared for ſome days, and we were all thrown into the deepeſt concern, fearing the weakneſs of her condition had diſabled her from working to windward, and that all her people had periſhed.</p>
                  <p>We continued our employ till the 26th, when we again ſaw the ſame ſhip; and, on her nearer approach, could diſtinguiſh her to be the Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter; and, making no doubt of her being in diſtreſs, the Commodore ſent our boat on board her with water and refreſhments. We found her in a miſerable condition, not many above 100 people alive, and almoſt all thoſe helpleſs with the ſcurvy; their water ſo very ſhort, that they were obliged to allow but one pint a day to a man; and the continual flaws off the land, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their being diſabled in their ſails and yards, hindered them from getting into the bay. The next day we ſent them a freſh ſupply of fiſh, greens, water, and men to help to work the ſhip; ſoon after which the flaws drove them off again, and the ſhip appeared no more till the 30th, when at two in the afternoon ſhe fired a gun, and made a ſignal of diſtreſs. She continued in this manner off and on, ſometimes in ſight, and ſometimes not, till July 23, during which
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0204000302:306"/>
time, though we often relieved the people on board with water and other neceſſaries, yet their ſufferings were inſupportable, and their whole complement were reduced to about 96 living perſons, all of whom muſt have periſhed in a few days more, had not the wind proved favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bring them into the bay; but providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially a freſh gale ſprung up from the ſea, and brought them to an anchor. We immediately ſent men on board to aſſiſt in mooring the ſhip, and continued our conſtant aſſiſtance afterwards, during our ſtay at this place.</p>
                  <p>The 5th of Auguſt, the Commodore ſent the Trial ſloop to ſearch the iſland of Little Juan Fernandez, leſt any of the ſquadron ſhould have miſtaken that iſland for the place of rendezvous, and might remain there in expectation of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt of the fleet.</p>
                  <p>On the 16th, the Anne pink, which was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from us with the reſt of the ſquadron the 23d of April, appeared in ſight. Her arrival gave us new ſpirits, ſhe being laden principally with proviſions, and we immediately were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed full allowance of bread. This ſhip had been about two months in a ſafe harbour, on the main land, near the ſame parallel with del Soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coro, where ſhe had been directed by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and where ſhe lay in ſecurity, enjoyed plenty, and her people, 16 in number, being once freed from their fears of ſhipwreck, very ſoon recovered their wonted vigour, having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced none of thoſe hardſhips that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0204000302:307"/>
by the reſt of the fleet. They told us they had ſeen ſome Indians, and one time took one of their canoes with a man, a woman, ſome children, a dog, a cat, &amp;c. and ſome implements for fiſhery; but in a day or two the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, the dog excepted, made their eſcape from them in the ſhip's ſmall boat, and left them their canoe in her ſtead. Thoſe Indians, they ſay, underſtood a few Spaniſh words, and probably might have ſome little correſpondence with the ſouthern Spaniards of Chili, or their nearer bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Indians; or, perhaps, ſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for propagating the faith may now and then have been among them. The principal refreſhments they met with in this port, were wild celery, nettletops, and ſorrel; cockles and muſcles of an extraordinary ſize; good ſtore of geeſe, ſheep, and penguins. They judged it to lie in lat. 45 deg. 30 min. S. and it may be known by an iſland which faces it, and which the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants call <hi>Inchin,</hi> and by a river in which they found excellent fiſh.</p>
                  <p>This veſſel, the Anne pink, was the laſt that joined us at Juan Fernandez. The remaining ſhips of the ſquadron were the Severn, the Pearl, and the Wager ſtore-ſhip. The Severn and Pearl, as has been already obſerved, parted company off Cape Noir, and, as we afterwards learned, put back to the Brazils; ſo that of all the ſhips that came into the South Seas, the Wager was the only ſhip that was miſſing. Captain Cheap, who commanded her, knowing the importance
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0204000302:308"/>
of the charge he had in truſt, without which no enterprize on ſhore could be undertaken, was extremely ſolicitous to reach Baldivia as the laſt place of rendezvous, and the firſt to be attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before the reſt of the ſquadron ſhould have finiſhed their cruiſe, that no blame might reſt upon him, if the attack of that city ſhould be judged improper to be carried into execution. But, whilſt this brave officer was exerting himſelf in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to keep clear of the land in making the iſland of del Soccoro, he had the misfortune to diſlocate his ſhoulder, and thereby to diſable himſelf from proſecuting with vigour the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he had in view. The ſhip being little better than a wreck, the crew in a miſerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding condition, the officers quite exhauſted, the weather cold and ſtormy, and the wind and currents bearing in-ſhore, all theſe unlucky cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances concurring, ſo entangled the ſhip with the land, that all the efforts of the feeble crew could not prevent her from running upon a ſunken rock; where ſhe grounded between two ſmall iſlands, not a muſquet ſhot from the ſhore. In this ſituation ſhe continued entire till every one on board might have reached the land in ſafety, and might have ſtored themſelves with proviſions, and every neceſſary for their preſent ſubſiſtence and future eſcape: but the moment the ſhip ſtruck, all ſubordination ceaſed; one part of the crew got poſſeſſion of the liquors, intoxicated themſelves in a beaſtly manner, and grew frantic in their cups; another part began
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0204000302:309"/>
to furniſh themſelves with arms, and to make themſelves maſters of the money and things of moſt value on board; while the Captain, and ſome of the principal officers, endeavoured in vain to maintain their authority, and to preſerve a proper diſcipline among them, in order to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the deliverance of as many as it was poſſible from the common danger in which all of them were involved; but the mutinous diſpoſition that prevailed rendered every effort for their preſervation ineffectual. Thoſe who remained in poſſeſſion of the ſhip and her ſtores, pointed the cannon, and fired at thoſe who had gained the land; thoſe at land grew riotous for want of proviſions; nothing but anarchy and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion prevailed; and, what added to the cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe, a midſhipman, named Cozens, who had buſied himſelf in oppoſition to all good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was, by the Captain, ſhot dead upon the ſpot. This put an end at once to all manner of ſubſerviency; and after this every one thought himſelf at liberty to purſue what ſcheme he thought beſt for his own preſervation.</p>
                  <p>Of about 130 perſons who reached the ſhore, 30 died on the place; about 80 others, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing converted the long boat into a ſchooner, ſailed to the ſouthward, attended by the cutter. Theſe, being diſtreſſed for want of proviſions in re-doubling Cape Horn, and having loſt their cutter in a ſtorm, ſuffered unprecedented hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips in their return to the coaſt of Brazil, where only 30 of them arrived to give an account of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0204000302:310"/>
the miſerable fate of their companions, ſeveral of whom died of hunger; others deſired to be ſet on ſhore; and ſome, beginning to be muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, they landed and deſerted. Of the 19 who were left behind in Wager-Iſland with the Captain, 16 embarked on board the barge and the yawl, and attempted to eſcape to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; of theſe one was drowned in the yawl, and four were left on a deſart part of the coaſt, where it is probable they all periſhed; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining 11, after a fruitleſs attempt to weather a point of land, called by the Spaniards Cape Treſmentes, were forced to return to Wager Iſland, from whence they firſt ſet out, where meeting with a Chiloen Indian, who could ſpeak a little Spaniſh, they agreed with him to pilot them to Chiloe; but, after coaſting along for four days, the Captain and his officers being on ſhore, five in number, the other ſix perſuaded the Indian to put to ſea without them, by which the reſt were reduced to the ſad neceſſity of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling near 600 miles, ſometimes by land, and ſometimes by water, till at length, after a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of misfortunes and hardſhips not to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelled in romance, four of them, namely, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cheap, the Hon. Mr. Byron, who lately went round the world, Mr. Hamilton, and Mr. Campbell, arrived at Chiloe, where they were received by the Spaniards with great humanity. After ſome ſtay at Chiloe, the Captain and his three officers were ſent to Valparaiſo, and thence to St. Jago, the capital of Chili, where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0204000302:311"/>
above a year; but on advice of a cartel, the Captain, Mr. Byron, and Mr. Hamilton, were permitted to return to Europe; and Mr. Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, who in the mean time had changed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, choſe to embark for Spain; but not meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there with the encouragement he expected, he ſoon after returned to England, where he publiſhed an account of his adventures, but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned not a word of changing his religion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does he aſſign his reaſon for leaving Spain.</p>
                  <p>It is very remarkable, that the place where the Wager ſtruck upon the rock, was ſo near the harbour where the Anne pink found ſhelter during the winter, that the Wager's people were within hearing of the Pink's evening and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gun, yet never had the thought to follow the ſound, or to look out for any ſtraggler from their own ſquadron.</p>
                  <p>On the 22d, the Trial arrived from ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the iſland of Little Fernandez, and reported that it lies about 20 leagues due weſt from this where we lay; that it is about three leagues in compaſs, being very mountainous, with ſome woods and good runs of water, with multitudes of goats, fiſh, ſea-lions, and ſeals, as with us; but no ſhips were to be ſeen, nor any marks of any having been there.</p>
                  <p>While we continued at Juan Fernandez, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our neceſſary employments, we likewiſe began, and pretty far advanced, a wharf for the better landing and embarking ſuch neceſſaries
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0204000302:312"/>
as we had occaſion for. We kept two ovens employed in baking bread for the ſhip's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, two ſmith's forges for repairing old and fitting new iron work, and made abundance or charcoal for future uſe. The Commodore likewiſe ordered the carpenters to take a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſurvey of the Anne Pink, the maſter of which ſet forth, that ſhe was in ſo rotten a condition, as not to be fit to proceed nor return without very conſiderable repairs; which repreſentation upon a ſurvey being found to be true, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore purchaſed her materials at a fair valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ordered her to be broke up, and her crew to be put on board the Glouceſter, that ſhip not having hands enough left to navigate her, much leſs to fight her, in caſe of an attack from the enemy.</p>
                  <p>This iſland lies in latitude 33 deg. 40 min. S. and longitude 87 deg 37 min. W. from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; diſtance from the main continent 105 leagues; compaſs, by the beſt accounts of thoſe who had been round it, 12 or 13 leagues. There are two ſmall and very commodious bays within the points, which form the large one where we lay, one to the eaſtward, the other to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of us, and no doubt ſeveral others in other parts of the iſland; variation, by an obſervation July 2, in the morning, 8 deg. 4 min. half E. 'Twas reported, that the S. W. end of the iſland is much more flat and level than that where we reſided, and the goats more numerous, but wood ſcarcer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0204000302:313"/>On Tueſday, Sept. the 8th, at noon, we ſaw a ſail at ſea bearing N. E. by E. and, perceiving, by our glaſſes that ſhe could be none of our ſquadron, nor an Engliſh-built ſhip, we fired a gun as a ſignal for getting all our people on board; and, having taken ſeveral men out of the Trial, bent our ſails, ſet up our rigging, and ſlipt our ſmall bower cable; at ſix in the evening we weighed in purſuit of her. In the morning of the next day we got down our ſtumps, which are generally ſet up in bad wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtead of top-gallant maſts, and in their place get up our top-gallant maſts and yards, rigged them, and bent their ſails. At eleven the ſame morning we muſtered and quartered the ſhip's company. At noon the iſland of Juan Fernandez bore W. half S. diſtance eight leagues; the two next days we ſaw nothing of the chace, nor any thing remarkable.</p>
                  <p>Saturday, Sept. 12, at five in the morning we ſaw a ſail to windward, which bore down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and at about two leagues diſtance ſhe hawled up the lee clue-garnet of her foreſail, ſhewed her Spaniſh colours, and fired a gun, which we ſuppoſed to be a ſignal concerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and others which came out in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with her; but we not anſwering nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding it, ſhe hauled cloſe on a wind and ſtood from us, endeavouring to eſcape; upon which we gave chace, and it proving ſometimes hazy and foggy, we were in danger of loſing ſight of her. About nine in the morning we tacked,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0204000302:314"/>
and at noon coming within gun-ſhot, we fired five ſhot at her rigging to bring her to; but ſhe keeping on her courſe, we fired four more, on which ſhe ſtruck her colours, and ſurrendered without making any oppoſition. This ſhip hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened not to be the ſame we went out after. She proved a rich merchant ſhip, having on board 18,000l. ſterling in dollars and plate, with ſome jewels, and abundance of gold and ſilver twiſt; but the bulk of her cargo conſiſted in ſugars and bale goods, moſt of the latter Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean, but ſome the produce of the country. She was called the Nueſtra Senora del Monte Carmelo. She was of about 500 tons, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Don Manuel Zamorra, and had on board 13 paſſengers, moſt of them perſons of fortune, amongſt whom was the ſon of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the city of St. Jago, the capital of Chili. She came from Callao, a port of Lima, the capital of the empire of Peru, bound for Valparaiſo in Chili, where thoſe ſhips annually trade, exchanging ſilver in return for gold and corn, the latter being very ſcarce in Peru, Some of the priſoners informed us, that, if we had taken her in her return from Chili to Peru, we ſhould have met with as much gold in her as we had now found ſilver. She had in the whole a board her 67 perſons, many of them Indians and black ſlaves, who were afterwards very uſeful to us in aſſiſting towards the ſhip's duty. She had been 27 days from Callao, and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0204000302:315"/>
wanted not above two days ſail to compleat her voyage when we took her.</p>
                  <p>We found in this ſhip, on ſearch among the letters from ſome merchants in Lima to their friends in Chili, an account of the fate of the Spaniſh ſquadron which had been ſent after us, viz. that, in attempting to paſs the Cape, they had been forced to put back, after encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt terrible ſtorms and moſt preſſing famine, being reduced to two ounces of bread and half a pint of water each man a day; that, beſides being grievouſly attacked by the ſcurvy, which had made greater havock among them than among us, their ſhips were almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diſabled, their maſts, ſails, yards, rigging and hulls in a manner ſhattered and torn to pieces; that Admiral Piſarro, and one more of his ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, after having ſuffered the greateſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, had got, with the utmoſt difficulty, to Buenos Ayres, on the River Plate; that another of the ſquadron, a ſhip of 70 guns, had been entirely loſt near Rio Grande, and that two more had never been heard of; that on their return they had ſeen two large ſhips paſs by very near them, which they ſuppoſed to be two ſhips of our ſquadron, but the weather proving ſtormy, and the ſea running mountains high, they could not interfere with or attack each other. Thoſe ſhips of ours we believed to be the Severn and the Pearl, and hoped they were ſafely arrived at ſome port of the Brazils. Thoſe letters came over land from Buenos Ayres to Lima,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0204000302:316"/>
and with them came others containing Admiral Piſarro's advice and inſtructions to the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of Peru concerning us; wherein he told him, that, though he himſelf had been forced back in ſuch a miſerable condition, not having above 80 or 100 of his men living, and his ſhips in ſo ill a ſtate, that, till ſufficient rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements could come to him from Old Spain, he could not poſſibly come into thoſe ſeas, yet as the Engliſh were a ſtubborn and reſolute peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and daring enough to perſiſt obſtinately in the moſt deſperate undertakings, he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſome of us might poſſibly get round; but as he experimentally knew what of neceſſity we muſt have ſuffered in that dreadful paſſage, he made no doubt but we ſhould be in a very weak and defenceleſs condition; he therefore adviſed the Viceroy to fit out all the ſtrength of ſhipping he could, and ſend them to cruiſe at the iſland of Juan Fernandez, where we muſt of neceſſity touch to refreſh our people, and to repair our ſhips; and farther adviſed, that, in caſe of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, they ſhould not ſtand to fight or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonade at a diſtance, in which poſſibly we might have the advantage, or make our eſcape, but ſhould board us at once ſword in hand; which muſt, if well executed, in our weak condition, infallibly prove the means of taking us.</p>
                  <p>This was a well-laid ſcheme, and in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of it the Viceroy equipt three ſhips at Callao, one of 50, one of 30, and one of 20 guns, all double manned with the choiceſt men
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0204000302:317"/>
they could poſſibly procure, and ſent them to wait for us accordingly. Thoſe ſhips arrived at Juan Fernandez ſome time, I think, in May, and continued till about June the 6th, when, imagining that we muſt be either put back or loſt, they quitted their ſtation, and ſailed for the port of Conception in Chili, and by this means we luckily miſſed them: had it happened other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as we arrived there with only our ſingle ſhip, in ſuch a defenceleſs condition, and had they put their orders in execution with any tolerable degree of reſolution, we muſt in all human probability have fallen into their hands.</p>
                  <p>Our priſoners informed us further, that thoſe ſhips, during their cruiſe, had met with a ſtorm, in which they had received ſo much damage, that it muſt be at leaſt two months before they could again be fit to go to ſea. The whole of his intelligence was as favourable as we could have wiſhed; and now we were at no loſs to account for the freſh marks we found at Juan Fernandez, of that iſland's having been lately viſited by ſome white people.</p>
                  <p>Sunday the 13th, having got on board moſt of the priſoners of note, and all the ſilver, we made ſail for Juan Fernandez; and the weather proving very moderate, at ſix in the evening that iſland bore N. W. by N. at the diſtance of five leagues. At three the next morning we fired three guns, as a ſignal to the ſhips in the bay. At four we anchored, got in our ſmall
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0204000302:318"/>
bower cable, which we had ſlipped at leaving the place, and moored our ſhip.</p>
                  <p>The 15th we employed in watering, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up our rigging, in order to purſue our voyage. And this day, the Commodore being informed that ſeveral merchant-ſhips were now purſuing their trade without fear of any ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, the Trial was ordered out on a cruiſe, and proceeded immediately.</p>
                  <p>The 16th we got up a new top-gallant-maſt, and wanting ſome cordage we were ſupplied with it from the Glouceſter. This and the following days, until the 19th, we ſpent in getting every thing ready for ſea with the utmoſt expedition.</p>
                  <p>The 19th we ſent 28 of our priſoners on board the Glouceſter, ſhe being weakly manned, and thoſe priſoners being good ſailors. We likewiſe ſupplied the prize with two months proviſions of all ſorts, at full allowance, for 20 men; put all the guns belonging to the Anne pink on board of her; and, having left orders with Captain Mitchell, of the Glouceſter, to burn the pink, together with her uſeleſs ſtores, and appointed him his ſtation off the town of Payta, which is the place where the ſhips be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Lima and Panama generally touch to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver part of their cargoes to be diſperſed through the inland parts of Peru, with orders to ſail to that ſtation as ſoon as poſſible, we weighed, and took leave of our winter reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in company with the prize, which the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0204000302:319"/>
Commodore had fitted up to cruiſe againſt the enemy.</p>
                  <p>The 21ſt, at four in the evening, we had the laſt ſight of this iſland, it then bearing from us W. by N. at the diſtance of 17 leagues. The remaining days, until the 24th, we had variable and uncertain weather, in which we ſplit our main-top-ſail and fore-ſail, and received ſome other ſlight damage.</p>
                  <p>The 24th, at five in the evening, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hazy, we ſaw two ſail to windward, on which we cleared ſhip, in order to be ready to engage, the largeſt of the two ſhips bearing down upon us. At ſeven ſhe came ſo near, that we haled her in Spaniſh, and ſhe anſwered in Engliſh, and told us, that ſhe was a prize taken by the Trial, and that her conſort was the Trial itſelf, which was very much diſabled. At 11 the next morning, there being a hard gale and high ſea, the Trial fired two guns as a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of diſtreſs, and bore away before the wind, and we after her. The ſame day half an hour paſt noon we ſpoke with the Trial, and found ſhe had ſprung her main-maſt, and that her main-top-maſt had come by the board: and as we were all of us ſtanding to the eaſtward next morning, with a freſh gale at ſouth, ſhe had the additional misfortune to ſpring her fore-maſt; ſo that now ſhe had not a maſt left. This was a great obſtruction; for now we had intelligence by the Trial's prize, that there were many ſhips at ſea richly laden, and that they
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0204000302:320"/>
had no apprehenſions of being attacked by us, having received intelligence that our ſquadron was either put back or deſtroyed. In the courſe, therefore, of the 48 hours we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in waiting upon the Trial, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded we miſſed the taking many valuable prizes. The reſult was, that a council being called, and all the officers convened together on board our ſhip, it was there concluded, that in her preſent condition the Trial could be of no farther ſervice; and the Commodore, being reſolved to ſeparate the ſhips, in order to cruiſe upon the coaſt to the greateſt advantage, gave orders to Captain Charles Saunders, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, to burn the Trial, and in her room commiſſioned the Trial's prize for his Majeſty's ſervice, with the ſame Commander, officers, and people. This ſhip, the Trial's prize, was called by the Spaniards the Nueſtra Senora de Arin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zazie; but, being now commiſſioned for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſervice, ſhe was henceforth called the Trial's Prize. She was the largeſt ſhip we took in thoſe ſeas, being between five and ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred tons, and loaded with bale goods, ſugar, and other commodities, to a conſiderable value, and about 5000l. in ſpecie and wrought ſilver.</p>
                  <p>The 28th, at nine in the morning, we parted with the Trial and both the prizes.</p>
                  <p>The 30th, we ſaw the main land of Chili. This day we began to exerciſe our people with ſmall arms, which was the firſt time we had done it ſince we came into thoſe ſeas, and which
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0204000302:321"/>
we continued at all proper opportunities during the voyage.</p>
                  <p>On the 1ſt of October we came in ſight of the high land of Valparaiſo, bearing N. E. half E. at the diſtance of about 14 leagues. This city lies in the latitude of 32 deg. 58 min. S. its longitude from London is by my account 80 deg. 37 min. W.</p>
                  <p>On the 5th, the Commodore, being informed that there were murmurings amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe the prize-money was not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately divided, ordered the articles of war to be read; and after that remonſtrated to them on the danger of mutiny, and ſaid he had heard the reaſon of their diſcontent, but aſſured them their properties were ſecured by act of parliament as firmly as any one's own inheritance, and that the money, plate, &amp;c. were weighed and marked in public; ſo that any capable perſon, if he pleaſed, might take an inventory of the whole. He then read an account of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and told them they might (if they pleaſed) make choice of any perſon to take an inventory for them, or buy their parts. This ſpread a viſible joy, and gave content to every one. We continued cruiſing off the coaſt of Valparaiſo till the 8th, when at twelve at night we broke the main top-ſail yard in the ſlings, on which we unbent the top-ſail and got down the broken yard. At ten in the morning we ſaw the high land of Choapa, and over it the Cordillera mountains, being part of that long
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0204000302:322"/>
ridge of mountains called the Andes, which run from one end of South America to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, appearing exceſſively high, with their tops covered with ſnow.</p>
                  <p>The 14th we croſſed the ſouth Tropic to the northward, and from this time, till we were ſome degrees to the northward of the Equator, met with nothing but fair weather and a ſmooth ſea.</p>
                  <p>The 21ſt, at noon, the high land of Morro Quemado bore E. by N. at the diſtance of four leagues; and here we continued cruiſing off and on till Nov. 2, when, about ſix in the morning, we ſaw two ſail of ſhips ſtanding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; upon which we made a clear ſhip, and immediately gave them chace, when we ſoon perceived that they were the Trial and Centurion prizes. As we had the wind of them, we brought to, and waited their coming up, when Captain Saunders came on board, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Commodore that he had cleared the Trial purſuant to his orders, and having ſcuttled her, he remained by her till ſhe ſunk; but that it was not till the 4th of October be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this was effected, by reaſon of the great ſwell and hollow ſea; that, during his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the ſloop, they were all driven ſo far to leeward, that they were afterwards obliged to ſtretch a long way to the weſtward, to regain the ground they had loſt; that in their cruiſe they had met no prize, nor had ſeen any veſſel on all the coaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:0204000302:323"/>Nov. the 3d, at five in the evening, the iſland of Aſia, in lat. 13 deg. 5 min. S. long. 84 deg. 43 min. W. bore from us N. E. by E. diſtance five leagues.</p>
                  <p>The 5th, at four in the evening, we ſaw the high land of Barranca, bearing N. E. by E. diſtant eight or nine leagues; and half an hour after we ſaw a ſail to the northward, to whom we gave chace, and cleared our ſhip for engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. At 10 in the evening we came up with her, fired eight guns, and took her. She came from Guaiaquil, and was bound for Callao, with timber, cacao, cordage, tobacco, cacao-nuts, and a ſmall trunk with bale goods; all of little value to us, though a very conſiderable loſs to the Spaniards. She was called the Santa Tereſa, commanded by Don Bartolo Urrunaga, with between 30 and 40 people on board, paſſengers included, and five or ſix women, beſides children. Our Third Lieutenant, two other officers, and a party of ſailors, were ſent on board to command and take care of her; and our other prizes being far a-ſtern, occaſioned by our chacing this ſhip, we lay by till four the next morning, and fired a gun every hour as a ſignal for their joining us. This day I find, by the difference of our dead reckoning and obſervations, a current to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long this coaſt to the northward of near a mile an hour.</p>
                  <p>The 7th, we were employed in getting aboard ſeveral neceſſary ſtores, as planks, cordage, and the like, from our laſt prize, for the uſe of the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0204000302:324"/>
ſquadron. The ſea here appeared for ſeveral miles of a blood-red colour, which the priſoners informed us was common in thoſe parts, and of which mention has been made more than once already in this work. This day we found aboard the prize, in ſpecie and plate, 50 pounds averdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pois weight.</p>
                  <p>The 9th, we brought from on board the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa 10 ſerons of cacao, one of wax, and 180 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom of three and a half rope.</p>
                  <p>The 10th, we brought from on board our firſt prize the Carmelo, the following goods, viz. cloth two bales, bays five ditto, ſugar 182 loaves, ſtraw mats two, tar one ſkin, raiſons three bales, indigo four ſerons, cotton cloth one bale, hats two caſes, and 25 looſe ones, ſkins one parcel, chocolate one bag, camlet one bale and two parcels, ſilks one box, lead four pigs, and combs one ſmall parcel.</p>
                  <p>The 12th, at five in the morning, we ſaw a ſail, to which we gave chace; but there being very little wind, we manned and armed our barge, pinnace, and the Trial's pinnace, and ſent them to take her, and at eight they boarded and took her, and brought her to us at half an hour paſt 10. She was called the Carmen, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Signior Marcus Marina, and came out of Payta the day before, bound to Callao, laden with iron and cloth, being a very valuable cargo. We found on board an Iriſhman, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed John Williams, who pretended himſelf a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner amongſt them, and with much ſeeming
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0204000302:325"/>
joy entered with us. He informed us, that, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other ſhips in the Port of Payta, they left in the road a bark which was taking in 400,000 dollars, with which ſhe would ſail for Panama in a day or two at fartheſt; and the Spaniſh priſoners being examined, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the intelligence, and farther giving ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſtrength of the place, the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore reſolved to attack it this very night, and made preparations accordingly. Mr. Thomas Simmers, mate of our ſhip, with one midſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and about 10 or 12 men, were ſent to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and take cate of this laſt prize. At four in the afternoon, Point Nonura bore E. by S. half S. diſtant eight leagues. At 10 at night, we ſent our barge, pinnace, and Trial's pinnace, to attack the town of Payta, by ſurprize. They had 49 men well armed, and were commanded by the Lieutenants Brett, Dennis, and Hughes, who had orders, if poſſible, to ſecure the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Payta, and ſend him priſoner on board, in order by that means to procure a ſupply of proviſions, and a ranſom for the town. Half an hour after 11 we ſounded, and found 43 fathom water, the ground mud, the iſland of Lobos bearing N. N. E. at the diſtance of three or four miles. At ſeven in the morning, Point Onado, being the point that forms the bay of Payta, bore S. S. E. two miles diſtant; and the town of Payta at the ſame time began to open in a direct line with it, diſtant about four miles; ſoon after which we ſaw our Britiſh colours fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0204000302:326"/>
on the caſtle. At 10, the Trial's boat came on board, loaded with gold and ſilver, corn, wrought plate, jewels, and rich moveables. They informed us, that they took the town about two in the morning; and that, though the Spaniards had ſome time before been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized of our intent, they yet made a very faint reſiſtance, having fired but two guns from their caſtle before our men landed, and a few ſmall arms afterwards, when they all quitted the town with the greateſt precipitation. The Governor and his family made their eſcape in ſo much haſte, that his lady was handed out of a window with no other cloaths to cover her but her ſhift. All the inhabitants fled in the like confuſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome negro women and children. In this action we loſt one man, Peter Obrian, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore's ſteward, who was ſhot through the breaſt by a muſquet ball; and had two wounded, to wit, Arthur Luſk, a quarter-maſter, and the Spaniſh pilot of the Tereſa, whom we had made uſe of as a guide; the firſt through the fleſhy part of the arm near the ſhoulder, the ſecond through the wriſt, but neither dangerouſly: and I have had it reported from ſeveral officers then on ſhore, that our men ran to the attack, and fired in ſo irregular a manner, that it was, and ſtill remains a doubt, whether thoſe were not ſhot by our people rather than by the enemy.</p>
                  <p>The town of Payta, at the time of the attack, had a fort with eight guns mounted, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the town and harbour; and the balcony
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0204000302:327"/>
of the Governor's houſe, which again command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that fort, together with ſeveral other houſes, was lined with armed men, of which there might be about 400 in the town; but theſe people having enjoyed a long peace, and being enervat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the luxury ſo cuſtomary in thoſe parts, their arms in a bad condition, and no perſon of experience or courage to head them, it is no wonder that they made ſo ſmall a reſiſtance, and were all driven out of the town in leſs than half an hour by only 49 men; but I believe the noiſe of two drums which we made uſe of, together with the ſuddenneſs of the ſurprize, contributed to intimidate them, and facilitated our ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>On our getting poſſeſſion of the caſtle, our commanding-officer very inconſiderately order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the guns to be thrown over the walls, which accordingly was executed; but ſome time after reflecting on the ill conſequence which might attend that proceeding, he ordered two of them to be got up and re mounted.</p>
                  <p>At 11, our barge came on board, loaded with money, plate, and jewels. This town contains about 140 or 150 houſes; there are in it two churches, which, together with the Governor's houſe and caſtle, are the only remarkable build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. There are ſeveral large ſtore-houſes full of rich European, Aſian, and American goods, all which were deſtroyed when we ſet the town on fire; of which in its place. The town lies in latitude 5 deg. 3 min. S. and longitude from London 88 deg. 48 min. W. This afternoon
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0204000302:328"/>
we employed ourſelves in getting off the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and proviſions of hogs and fowls, which were here in great plenty. In the evening we anchored in 10 fathom water, the town bearing from us S. by E. half E. at about three miles diſtance, not being able to get farther in, by reaſon of the flaws of wind from off the land.</p>
                  <p>From this time to the 15th we were employed in getting on board the plunder, which chiefly conſiſted of rich brocades, laced cloaths, bales of fine linens and woolens, Britannia's, ſlays, and the like; together with a great number of hogs, ſome ſheep and fowls, caſes of Spaniſh brandies and wines, a great quantity of onions, olives, ſweet-meats, and many other things too tedious to name; all which the ſailors hoped would have been equally divided among the ſhips companies, but they found themſelves diſappointed.</p>
                  <p>We found in the road, one ſhip, two ſnows, one ſchooner, and two quarter-gallies, all which we took poſſeſſion of. The 14th, in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſaw a bark-log as they call it, being a ſort of raft made of the ſtumps of trees faſtened together, overlaid with poles, and covered with for all twigs twiſted mat wiſe, with ſeveral peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in her coming along ſhore from the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. She had a ſort of maſt and ſail in her, and at firſt ſight we knew not what to make of her; and none of our own boats being on board, we ſent the carmen's boat, with Mr. Langdon, a midſhipman, who commanded in the ſecond place on board that ſhip, and ſome armed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0204000302:329"/>
to purſue them, who perceiving it put on ſhore, and made their eſcape over the rocks. Mr. Langdon took their bark-log, which he found to be laden with dried fiſh, which we ſuppoſe they were carrying to Payta for a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. This evening the Spaniards, who had all along appeared in great numbers from the hills, and were now conſiderably increaſed, making a ſhew of warlike preparations, as if they deſigned in the night to attack our people in the town, they thereupon barricaded the ſtreets, and kept very ſtrict watches, to prevent a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. Several negroes delivered themſelves up, deſiring to be made priſoners, that they might have ſome food, and more eſpecially water, to keep them from periſhing; for the country thereabouts being for many miles round quite barren and ſandy, without either water or any other thing neceſſary for life, and the neareſt town to them, named as I think Sancta Cruz, whence relief might be got, being a day and a half or two days journey off, the people who had left the town were in a ſtarving condition, and we had melancholy accounts of ſeveral dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among them for want chiefly of water dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſmall ſtay; and yet ſo greatly were they infatuated or frightened, that they never offered to treat for the ranſom of the place, which if they had done, I believe it would not have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; in which caſe they might have ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to themſelves not only their habitations, but proviſions and water enough (till they could
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0204000302:330"/>
have got a freſh recruit), which we ſhould on that condition have readily left them.</p>
                  <p>The town ſeems to be very unhappily ſituat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that and ſome other accounts, they hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no water but what is brought them by land-carriage from ſeveral leagues off; ſo that they are obliged to keep very conſiderable quantities by them in earthen jars, not only for their own uſe, but for the ſhips who frequently touch here, where they likewiſe often unload, and take in freſh cargoes. They are in the ſame caſe as to grain, bread, and almoſt all other neceſſaries of life; and lie ſo open to an enemy, that the town has been often taken and ruined by the Engliſh, Dutch, and French; all which inconveniencies, one would imagine, ſhould tempt them to change their ſituation: but then the conveniency of their trade is ſo great, being the only proper place they can pitch on for a mart between Panama and Peru, that they prefer this lucrative conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to all other conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Among the ſlaves who had deſired to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in our ſervice, was one, who, having been a ſlave in Jamaica, had on the death of his maſter obtained his liberty, and thereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered himſelf a ſervant to one of the South-Sea Company's factors, whom he accompanied to Porto Bello and Panama, and there got into the ſervice of a Spaniſh gentleman, who took a great fancy to him, and with whom he went to Lima in Peru, where this maſter likewiſe dying left him a very conſiderable legacy; but the power
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0204000302:331"/>
being now in the hands of his executors, they not only defrauded him of this legacy, but made him a ſlave a ſecond time. He was now at Payta with one of his new maſters, on his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from Lima to Panama, when he took this opportunity to come over to us; and being a very handy fellow, and accuſtomed to wait on gentlemen, he was immediately taken into the Commodore's ſervice, came with us into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and, I believe, continued with him till his death. This perſon gave us ſome information of the deſigns of the Spaniards on ſhore, and told us we had killed one or two of them, and wounded ſeveral others; but this account was never, that I know of, farther confirmed.</p>
                  <p>The 15th, in the morning, we ſent on ſhore all our Spaniſh, and ſeveral of our Indian pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, keeping all the blacks and ſome of the Indians, to aſſiſt in working the ſhips, &amp;c. To the blacks, who were all or moſt of them ſlaves, was promiſed their liberty in England, in caſe they would ſtand by and aſſiſt us againſt our enemies the Spaniards; which they all promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very cordially: but we could ſoon diſcover, that, notwithſtanding their ſeeming condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, moſt of them would have much rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the ſervice of their old maſters, than fail to accept of liberty with us; not that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe people were in love with ſlavery, or would not willingly have had their liberty, but then it muſt be on their own terms, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards in thoſe parts being in great awe of the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0204000302:332"/>
Indians, whom, though they have ſubdued, and ſeem to have incorporated among them, they dare not truſt, but keep theſe blacks as guards, and uſe them well. The truth is, thoſe Indians have ſtill preſerved, by tradition from father to ſon, the memory of the great cruelties which the firſt Spaniards exerciſed in thoſe parts, and are angry enough at their preſent hard uſage. They look on themſelves as the natural lords of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the Spaniards as covetous intruders, and cruel inhuman tyrants; and want only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make them ſenſible of their reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to recover their loſt country and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. 'Tis on this account that the Spaniards are very kind to their black ſlaves, whom they cheriſh and encourage highly, and look on them in the ſame light of a ſtanding militia, always ready to arm againſt thoſe Indians; ſo that, though the negroes in all other plantations in the Weſt Indies are ever ready for revolts and rebellions, theſe, on the contrary, are always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to defend their kind maſters with their lives. In effect they live very eaſy, are favoured by the Spaniards, and ſcorn and inſult the poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, who in return hate and deteſt both them and their maſters; that being all that is left in their power.</p>
                  <p>This day an order was given to Mr. Brett, the then commanding officer on ſhore, to burn and deſtroy the town entirely, the two churches, which ſtood a little out of the way of the reſt, only excepted; the Spaniards, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0204000302:333"/>
ſaid, never having made any advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards treating for its ranſom.</p>
                  <p>But now, before I entirely quit the relation of our tranſactions at this place, it may, perhaps, be expected, that I ſhould give a more particular account of the booty we made, and of the loſs the Spaniards ſuſtained. I have already obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there were great quantities of valuable effects in the town; but, as moſt of them were what we could neither diſpoſe of, nor carry away, the total of this merchandize can only be rudely gueſſed at. The Spaniards, in their repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſent to the court of Madrid (as we were afterwards aſſured), eſtimated their whole loſs at a million and a half of dollars; and when it is conſidered, that no ſmall part of the goods we left behind us, were of the richeſt and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive ſpecies, as broad-cloths, ſilks, cambrics, velvets, &amp;c. I cannot but think their valuation ſufficiently moderate.</p>
                  <p>As to ourſelves, the acquiſition we made, though inconſiderable in compariſon of what we deſtroyed, was yet far from deſpicable; for the wrought plate, dollars, and other coin, which fell into our hands, amounted to upwards of 30,000 l. beſides ſeveral rings, bracelets, and jewels, whoſe intrinſic value we could not then eſtimate: and over and above all this, the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which became the property of the immediate captors, was very great; ſo that, upon the whole, it was by much the moſt important booty we met with upon that coaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:0204000302:334"/>There remains ſtill another matter to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, which on account of the ſignal honour which our national character in thoſe parts has thence received, and the reputation which our Commodore in particular has thereby acquired, merits a diſtinct and circumſtantial diſcuſſion. I have already obſerved, that all the priſoners taken by us were, before our departure, put on ſhore, and diſcharged, amongſt whom there were ſome perſons of conſiderable diſtinction, eſpecially a youth of about 17 years of age, ſon of the Vice-Preſident of the Council of Chili. As the barbarity of the buccaneers, and the art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful uſes the eccleſiaſtics had made of it, had filled the natives of thoſe countries with the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ideas of Engliſh cruelty, we always found our priſoners, at their firſt coming on board us, to be extremely dejected, and under great hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and anxiety; particularly this youth, who, having never been from home before, lamented his captivity in the moſt moving manner, regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in very plaintive terms, his parents, his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, his ſiſters, and his native country; of all which, he was fully perſuaded, he had taken his laſt farewel, believing that he was now devoted for the remaining part of his life to an abject and cruel ſervitude. Indeed, his companions on board, and all the Spaniards that came into our power, had the ſame deſponding opinion of their ſituation. Mr. Anſon conſtantly exerted his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to efface thoſe terrifying im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions they had received of us, always taking
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0204000302:335"/>
care, that as many of the principal people among them as there was room for ſhould dine at his table by turns; and giving the moſt peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory orders, too, that they ſhould always be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the utmoſt decency and humanity: but, notwithſtanding this precaution, it was generally obſerved, that for the firſt day or two they did not quit their fears, ſuſpecting the gentleneſs of their uſage to be only preparatory to ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of calamity. However, being at length convinced of our ſincerity, they grew perfectly eaſy in their ſituation, and remarkably chearful; ſo that it was often diſputable, whether or no they conſidered their being detained by us as a misfortune: for the youth I have above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, who was near two months on board us, had at laſt ſo far conquered his melancholy ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and had taken ſuch an affection to Mr. Anſon, that it is doubtful to me, whether, if his own opinion had been aſked, he would not have preferred a voyage to England in the Centurion, to the being ſet on ſhore at Payta, where he was at liberty to return to his country and friends.</p>
                  <p>This conduct of the Commodore to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, which was continued without interruption or deviation, gave them all the higheſt idea of his humanity and benevolence, and occaſioned them, likewiſe, (as mankind are fond of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing general opinions) to entertain very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thoughts of the whole Engliſh nation. But whatever they might be diſpoſed to think of Mr. Anſon before the capture of the Tereſa,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0204000302:336"/>
their veneration for him was prodigiouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by his conduct towards the ladies whom he took in that veſſel; for, being informed that there were among them a mother and two daughters of exquiſite beauty, who were of quality, he not only gave orders that they ſhould be left in full poſſeſſion of their own apartments, but alſo forbid, on the ſevereſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, any of the common people on board from approaching them; and, that they might be the more certain of having theſe orders com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, or of having the means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining if they were not, he permitted the pilot, who in Spaniſh ſhips is generally the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon on board, to ſtay with them as a guardian and protector. Theſe were meaſures that ſeemed ſo different from what might have been expected from an enemy and an heretic, that the Spaniards on board, though they had themſelves experienced his beneficence, were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at this new inſtance of it; and the more ſo, as all this was done without ſolicitation, and without the interpoſition of one friend to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede in their favour. The ladies were ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the obligations they owed him for the care and atention with which he protected them, that they abſolutely refuſed to go to ſhore at Payta, till they had been permitted to wait on him on board the Centurion to return him thanks in perſon. Indeed, all the priſoners left us with the ſtrongeſt aſſurances of their grateful remembrance of his uncommon treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0204000302:337"/>
a jeſuit, in particular, whom the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore had taken, and who was an eccleſiaſtic of ſome diſtinction, could not help expreſſing himſelf with great thankfulneſs for the civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he and his countrymen had found on board, declaring that he ſhould conſider it as his duty to do Mr. Anſon juſtice at all times, adding that his uſage of the men priſoners was ſuch as could never be forgotten, and ſuch as he ſhould never fail to acknowledge upon all occaſions; but that his behaviour to the ladies was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and ſo extremely honourable, that he doubted if all the regard due to his own eccleſiaſtical character would be ſufficient to render it credible. Indeed, we were afterwards informed, that he and the reſt of our priſoners had not been ſilent on this head; but that, both at Lima and at other places, they had given the greateſt encomiums to our Commodore; that the jeſuit, in particular, as we were told, on his account, interpreted in a lax and hypothetical ſenſe, that article of his church which aſſerts the impoſſibility of heretics being ſaved—But to return:</p>
                  <p>After we had finiſhed our buſineſs, ſet the town in flames, and got the treaſure on board, Mr. Brett, the officer who commanded the attack, having collected his men together, was directing his march towards the beach where the boats waited to take them on board, when the Spaniards on the hill behind the town, obſerving his retreat, reſolved to try if
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0204000302:338"/>
they could not precipitate his departure, and thereby lay ſome foundation for future boaſting. To this end a party of horſe, all picked men ſingled out for this daring enterprize, marched down the hill with much ſeeming reſolution; ſo that, had we not entertained a juſt opinion of their proweſs, we might have imagined, that, now we were upon the open beach, with no advantages of ſituation, they would certainly have charged us: but we preſumed, and we were not miſtaken, that all this was mere oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for, notwithſtanding the pomp and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade they at firſt came on with, Mr. Brett had no ſooner ordered his men to halt and face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, than the enemy ſtopt their career, and never dared to advance a ſtep farther.</p>
                  <p>When our people arrived at their boats and were ready to go on board, they were for ſome time retarded by miſſing one of their number; and being unable, on their mutual enquiries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong each other, to inform themſelves where he was left, or by what accident detained, they, after a conſiderable delay, reſolved to get into their boats and to depart without him: but, when the laſt man was actually embarked, and the boats were juſt putting off, they heard him calling to them to take him in. The place was by this time ſo thoroughly on fire, and the ſmoke covered the beach ſo effectually, that they could ſcarcely diſcern him, though they heard his voice. However, the Lieutenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ordered one of the boats to his relief,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0204000302:339"/>
who found him up to the chin in water, for he had waded as far as he durſt, being extremely frightened with the apprehenſions of falling into the hands of an enemy, enraged, as they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs were, at the pillage and deſtruction of their town. On enquiring into the cauſe of his ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind, it was found that he had taken that morning too large a doſe of brandy, which had thrown him into ſo ſound a ſleep, that he did not awake till the fire came near enough to ſcorch him. He was ſtrangely amazed, at firſt opening his eyes, to ſee the houſes on a blaze on one ſide, and ſeveral Spaniards and Indians not far from him on the other. The greatneſs and ſuddenneſs of his fright inſtantly reduced him into a ſtate of ſobriety, and gave him ſufficient preſence of mind to puſh through the thickeſt of the ſmoke, as the likelieſt means to eſcape the enemy; and, making the beſt of his way to the beach, he ran as far into the water as he durſt (for he could not ſwim), before he ventured to look back.</p>
                  <p>By the time our people had helped their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade out of the water, and were making the beſt of their way to the ſquadron, the flames had taken poſſeſſion of every part of the town, and burnt ſo furiouſly, both by means of the combuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibles that had been diſtributed for that purpoſe, and by the ſlightneſs of the materials of which the houſes were compoſed, and their aptitude to take fire, that it was ſufficiently apparent no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the enemy (though they flocked down
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0204000302:340"/>
in great numbers) could poſſibly put a ſtop to it, or prevent the entire deſtruction of the place, and all the merchandize contained therein. Mr. Brett had the curioſity to delineate its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, together with that of the ſhips in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as may be ſeen in the Plate.</p>
                  <p>Our detachment having now ſafely joined the ſquadron, the Commodore prepared to leave the place the ſame evening. At ſeven, Cape Blanco, in lat. 4 deg. 28 min. S. and long. 88 deg. 16 min. W. from London, bore from us S. S. E. half E. about ſeven or eight miles diſtant. This afternoon and the next day we were employed in taking the moſt uſeful and valuable things out of the Santa Tereſa and the Payta bark: we likewiſe deſigning to take every neceſſary thing which we conveniently could out of the Santa Tereſa, in order to deſtroy her, and bring our ſtrength into a leſs compaſs, we took her in tow, and ſet the Payta bark on fire with the ſame view. The next day we deſtroyed the Santa Tereſa in the ſame manner, having got out of them both ſome anchors, cables, hawſers, yards, and top-maſts, blocks, bales of goods, and ſeveral other neceſſaries.</p>
                  <p>The 17th at three in the afternoon, the Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, with a prize of her's in tow, joined us. This prize was called the Del Oro, and was chiefly laden with wine; however, out of her and a ſmall boat which they took going along ſhore, they got, in gold, ſilver, and wrought plate, to about the value of 17 or 18000 l.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0204000302:341"/>
Theſe two were all the prizes the Glouceſter took in thoſe ſeas.</p>
                  <p>On board this prize of this Glouceſter were two horſes, which being, I ſuppoſe, fat, and probably better food than their ſalt beef or pork, they killed and eat them; and this, I imagine, gave ground to that fiction which one of the ſpurious accounts of our voyage has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, of our eagerly hunting and eating wild horſes, whereas in reality we never ſaw nor heard of a wild horſe during the voyage.</p>
                  <p>The Glouceſter had chaced two or three ſhips which had eſcaped her, and one of thoſe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Payta; and though they could give no certain account that the ſhip which had chaced them was an enemy, yet the circumſtances they gave were ſo ſtrong, that it put the people of Payta upon ſecuring their treaſure, and the beſt of their effects, not caring to be too well provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the profit of ſuch unwelcome viſitants.</p>
                  <p>The 21ſt, at half paſt five in the morning, we ſaw the iſland of Plata, ſo called from Sir Francis Drake's having, as it is ſaid, divided the treaſure he took in the South Seas at this place. At two this afternoon, the port of Manta bore S. E. by E. diſtant about eight or nine leagues. We at this time ſent ſix months proviſions on board the Carmen; and all the ſhips had orders, in caſe of ſeparation, for ſeveral rendezvouſes on the coaſt of Mexico, or, in caſe of not meeting there, to make the beſt of their way to Macao,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0204000302:342"/>
in China, where they were to await the arrival of the Commodore.</p>
                  <p>The 22d, a diviſion was made of the plunder of Payta, and the Commodore not appearing in that affair, it was done at the pleaſure, and to the entire ſatisfaction, of five or ſix (no doubt) very diſintereſted officers; and, indeed, moſt things of this nature, during the courſe of the voyage being managed with the ſame diſcretion and honour, no room was left for complaining of particular partialities.</p>
                  <p>Here, however, we cannot help remarking a very conſiderable difference between the relation given by Paſcoe Thomas, and that given by Mr. Walters; the former having aſſerted, that the Commodore did <hi>not</hi> interfere in the diſtribution; the latter, that it was by his prudent manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that a jealouſy, which had ariſen between thoſe who were the real captors, and thoſe who remained on board the ſhip, was accommodated. Mr. Walters' account will ſet this matter in a true light: <q rend="inline">"And now, ſays he, (while the ſhips lay-to, in hopes of joining the Glouceſter,) a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, which had taken its riſe at Payta, between thoſe who had been commanded on ſhore for the attack, and thoſe who had continued on board, grew to ſuch a height, that the Commodore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made acquainted with it, thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to interpoſe his authority to oppoſe it. The ground of this animoſity was the plunder gotten at Payta, which thoſe who had acted on ſhore had appropriated to themſelves, conſidering it
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0204000302:343"/>
as a reward for the riſques they had run, and the reſolution they had ſhewn in that ſervice. But thoſe who had remained on board looked on this as a very partial and unjuſt procedure, urging, that, had it been left to their choice, they ſhould have preferred the acting on ſhore to the continuing on board; that their duty while their comrades were on ſhore was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fatiguing; for, beſides the labour of the day, they were conſtantly under arms all night, to ſecure the priſoners, whoſe numbers exceeded their own, and of whom it was then neceſſary to be extremely watchful, to prevent any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts they might have formed in that critical conjuncture: that, upon the whole, it could not be denied, but that the preſence of a ſufficient force on board was as neceſſary to the ſucceſs of the enterprize, as the action of the others on ſhore; and, therefore, thoſe who had continued on board maintained, that they could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their ſhare of the plunder without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt injuſtice. Theſe were the conteſts amongſt our men, which were carried on with great heat on both ſides; and, though the plunder in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a very trifle in compariſon of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure taken in the place (in which there was no doubt but thoſe on board had an equal right), yet as the obſtinacy of ſailors is not always regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the importance of the matter in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, the Commodore thought it neceſſary to put a ſtop to this ferment betimes. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the morning after our leaving Payta, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0204000302:344"/>
all hands upon the quarter-deck, where addreſſing himſelf to thoſe who had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached on ſhore, he commended their behaviour, and thanked them for their ſervices on that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; but then, repreſenting to them the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons urged by thoſe who had continued on board, for an equal diſtribution of the plunder, he told them, that he thought theſe reaſons very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, and that the expectations of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades were juſtly founded; and therefore, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, that, not only the men, but all the officers likewiſe who had been employed in taking the place, ſhould produce the whole of their plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der immediately upon the quarter-deck, and that it ſhould be impartially divided amongſt the whole crew, in proportion to each man's rank and commiſſion; and, to prevent thoſe who had been in poſſeſſion of the plunder from murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this diminution of their ſhare, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore added, that, as an encouragement to others who might be hereafter employed on like ſervices, he would give his entire ſhare to be diſtributed amongſt thoſe who had been detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the attack of the place. Thus, this troubleſome affair, which, if permitted to have gone on, might, perhaps, have been attended with miſchievous conſequences, was, by the Commodore's prudence, ſoon appeaſed, to the general ſatisfaction of the ſhip's company: not but there were ſome few whoſe ſelfiſh diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were uninfluenced by the juſtice of this procedure, and who were incapable of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0204000302:345"/>
the force of equity, however glaring, when is tended to deprive them of any part of what they had once got into their hands."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being now joined by the Glouceſter and her prize, it was reſolved that we ſhould ſtand to the northward, and make the beſt of our way either to Cape St. Lucas on California, or to Cape Corientes on the coaſt of Mexico. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Commodore, when at Juan Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez, had determined to touch in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Panama, and to endeavour to get ſome correſpondence over land with the fleet under the command of Admiral Vernon; for when we departed from England, we left a large force at Portſmouth, which was intended to be ſent to the Weſt Indies, there to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in an expedition againſt ſome of the Spaniſh ſettlements. And Mr. Anſon, taking it for granted that this enterprize had ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that Porto Bello perhaps might be then garriſoned by Britiſh troops, he hoped that, on his arrival at the iſthmus, he ſhould eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an intercourſe with our countrymen on the other ſide, either by the Indians, who were greatly diſpoſed in our favour, or even by the Spaniards themſelves, ſome of whom for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per rewards might be induced to carry on this intelligence; which, after it was once begun, might be continued with very little difficulty; ſo that Mr. Anſon flattered himſelf, that he might by this means have received a reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men from the other ſide, and that, by

ſettling a prudent plan of operations with our Commanders in the Weſt Indies, he might have taken even Panama itſelf, which would have given to the Britiſh nation the poſſeſſion of that iſthmus, whereby we ſhould have been in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect maſters of all the treaſures of Peru.</p>
                  <p>Such were the projects which the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore revolved in his thoughts, at the iſland of Juan Fernandez, notwithſtanding the feeble condition to which he was then reduced; but in examining the papers which were found on board the Carmelo, the firſt prize we took, we learned, that our attempt againſt Carthagena had failed, and that there was no probability that our fleet in that part of the world would engage in any new enterprize that would at all facilitate this plan. Mr. Anſon therefore gave over all hopes of being reinforced acroſs the iſthmus, and conſequently had no inducement at preſent to proceed to Panama, as he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of attacking the place, and there was great reaſon to believe that, by this time, there was a general embargo on all the coaſt.</p>
                  <p>The only feaſible meaſure, then, which was left us, was to ſteer as ſoon as poſſible to the ſouthern parts of California, or to the adjacent coaſt of Mexico, there to cruiſe for the Manilla galleon, which we knew was now at ſea, bound to the port of Acapulco; and we doubted not but to get on that ſtation time enough to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept her: but there was a buſineſs which we fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw would occaſion ſome delay, and that was the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0204000302:347"/>
recruiting our water, it being impoſſible to think of venturing upon this paſſage to the coaſt of Mexico till we had procured a freſh ſupply. It was for ſome time a matter of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, where we ſhould take in this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary article; but, by conſulting the accounts of former navigators, and examining our priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, we at laſt reſolved for the iſland of Quibo, ſituated at the mouth of the bay of Panama. Nor was it but on good grounds that the Commodore conceived this to be the propereſt place for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the ſquadron. Indeed, there was a ſmall iſland called Cocos, which was leſs out of our way than Quibo, where ſome of the buccaneers had pretended to find water; but none of our priſoners knew any thing of it, and it was thought 100 dangerous to riſque the ſafety of the ſquadron, by expoſing ourſelves to the hazard of not meeting with water when we came there, on the mere authority of thoſe legendary writers, of whoſe miſrepreſentations and falſities we had almoſt daily experience. Determined, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to take in water at Quibo, we directed our courſe northward, being eight ſail in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and conſequently having the appearance of a very formidable fleet; and on the 19th, at day-break, we diſcovered Cape Blanco, bearing S. S. E. half E. ſeven miles diſtant. By this time we found that our laſt prize, the Solidad, was far from anſwering the character given of her as a good ſailor; and ſhe and the Santa Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa delaying us conſiderably, the Commodore
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0204000302:348"/>
commanded them to be cleared of every thing that might prove uſeful to the reſt of the ſhips, and then to be burnt. And having given proper inſtructions, and appointed a rendezvous to the Glouceſter, and to the prizes, in caſe of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we proceeded in our courſe for Quibo.</p>
                  <p>On the 25th, Point Manta bore S. E. by E. at ſeven miles diſtance, and there being a town of the ſame name in the neighbourhood, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mitchell in the Glouceſter took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſetting on ſhore ſeveral of his priſoners. The boats were now daily employed in diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting proviſions on board the prizes, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat their ſtock for ſix months; and that the Centurion might be the better prepared to give the Manilla ſhip a warm reception, if happily ſhe ſhould fall in our way, the carpenters were ordered to fix eight ſtocks on the main and fore tops, which were properly fitted for the mounting of ſwivel guns.</p>
                  <p>On the 25th we had ſight of the iſland of Gallo; and from hence we croſſed the bay of Panama, ſhaping our courſe in a direct line for Quibo. Here we found, in a few days, a very conſiderable alteration in the climate; for, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that uniform temperature, where neither the exceſs of heat or cold was prevalent, we had now cloſe and ſultry weather, like that we met with on the coaſt of Brazil. We had, beſides, frequent calms and heavy rains, which we at firſt aſcribed to the neighbourhood of the Line,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0204000302:349"/>
where this kind of weather is obſerved to obtain at all ſeaſons of the year; but, finding that it attended us for more than ſeven degrees of north latitude, we began to ſuſpect that the ſtormy ſeaſon, or, as the Spaniards call it, the Vandewals, was not yet paſt; though many writers, particularly Captain Shelvock, aſſert, that this ſeaſon begins in June, and ends in November: but, perhaps, its end may not be always regular.</p>
                  <p>On the 27th, Capt. Mitchell having cleared his largeſt prize, ſhe was likewiſe ſet on fire; and now our fleet conſiſted only of five ſhips, and we were fortunate enough to find them all good ſailors. On the 3d of December we had a view of the iſland of Quibo, the eaſt end of which bore from us N. N. W. four leagues diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and the iſland of Quicara W. N. W. at about the ſame diſtance. When we had thus got ſight of land, we found the wind to hang weſterly; and therefore night coming on, we thought it adviſeable to ſtand off till morning, as there are ſaid to be ſome ſhoals at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the channel. At ſix the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Point Marrato bore N. E. half N. three or four leagues diſtant. In weathering this point, all the ſquadron, except the Centurion, were very near it; and the Glouceſter, being the leeward-moſt ſhip, was forced to tack and ſtand to the ſouthward; ſo that we loſt ſight of her; and, the wind proving unfavourable, we ſaw her no more till we quitted the iſland. At
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0204000302:350"/>
ſeven in the evening we anchored in the Canal Bueno, or Good Channel, which is at leaſt ſix miles in breadth, muddy ground. Next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an officer was diſpatched on ſhore to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the watering-place, who, having found it, returned before noon; and then we ſent our long-boat for a load of water, and at the ſame time weighed and ſtood further in with our ſhips, for the convenience of being ſooner ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; ſo that we were little more than two days in laying in all the wood and water we wanted. Whilſt the ſhip continued here at anchor, the Commodore, attended by ſome of his officers, went in a boat to examine a bay which lay to the northward, and they afterwards ranged all along the eaſtern ſide of the iſland. In the places where they put on ſhore, in the courſe of this expedition, they generally found the ſoil to be rich, and met with great plenty of excellent water. In particular, near the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt point of the iſland, they diſcovered a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral caſcade, which ſurpaſſed, as they conceived, every thing of this kind which human art had ever yet produced. It was a river of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent water, about 40 yards wide, which rolled down a declivity of near 150 feet in length. The channel itſelf was very irregular, intirely compoſed of rocks, both its ſides and bottom being made up of large detached blocks, and by theſe the courſe of the water was frequently interrupted; for in ſome parts it ran ſloping with a rapid but uniform motion, whilſt in
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0204000302:351"/>
others it tumbled over ledges of rocks with a perpendicular deſcent. On the neighbourhood of this ſtream was a fine wood; and even the huge maſſes of rock which over-hung the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and which by their various projections formed the inequalities of the channel, were covered with lofty foreſt trees. Whilſt the Commodore, with thoſe who accompanied him, were attentively viewing this place, and were remarking the different blendings of the water, the rocks, and the wood, there came in ſight, as it were to heighten and animate the proſpect, a prodigious flight of Mackaws, which, hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over this ſpot, and often wheeling and playing on the wing above it, afforded a moſt brilliant appearance, by the glittering of the ſun, and their variegated plumage; ſo that ſome of the ſpectators cannot refrain from a kind of tranſport when they recount the beauties which occurred in this extraordinary waterfal.</p>
                  <p>In three days we compleated our buſineſs in this place, and were impatient to depart, that we might arrive time enough on the coaſt of Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, to intercept the galleon; but the wind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary, detained us a night; and next day, when we had gained an offing, while we were hovering about in hopes of getting ſight of the Glouceſter, we on the 20th diſcerned a ſmall ſail to the northward of us, to which we gave chace, and coming up with her took her. She proved to be a bark from Panama, called the Jeſu Nazareno, laden with oakum, rock ſalt,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0204000302:352"/>
and a ſmall quantity of money to purchaſe a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go of proviſions at Cheripe, an inconſiderable village on the continent, which, however, has a good market, from whence future voyagers, in caſe of neceſſity, may be plentifully ſupplied.</p>
                  <p>On the 12th of September we joined the Glouceſter, who informed us, that, in tacking to the ſouthward, on her firſt approach towards the iſland, ſhe had ſprung her fore-top-maſt, which had diſabled her from working to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and prevented her from joining us ſooner. We now ſcuttled and ſunk the Jeſu Nazareno, and, on the 12th of December, ſtood to the weſtward, having previouſly delivered freſh inſtructions for the conduct of the fleet. We had now little doubt of arriving ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough upon our intended ſtation, as we expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon the increaſing our offing from Quibo, to fall in with the regular trade-wind, but, to our extreme vexation, we were baffled for near a month, ſo that it was the 25th of December before we ſaw the iſland of Cocos, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our reckoning, was only 100 leagues from the continent, and even then we had the mortification to make ſo little way, that we did not loſe ſight of that iſland again in five days. This iſland we found to be in the lat. of 5 deg. 20 min. N.</p>
                  <p>We had flattered ourſelves, that the uncertain and weſtern gales we met with were owing to the neighbourhood of the continent, from which,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0204000302:353"/>
as we got more diſtant, we hoped to be relieved by falling in with the eaſtern trade-wind; but in this too being diſappointed, we began at length to deſpair of the great purpoſe we had in view. This produced a general dejection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, as we had at firſt conſidered the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as almoſt infallible, and had indulged our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the moſt boundleſs hopes of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages we ſhould thence receive. However, our deſpondency was, in ſome meaſure, alleviated by a favourable change of the wind; and, as we now advanced a-pace towards our ſtation, our hopes began again to revive. On the 17th of January, we were advanced to the lat. of 12 deg. 50 min. N. and, on the 26th of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, finding ourſelves to the northward of Acapulco, we tacked and ſtood to the eaſtward, with a view of making the land; and we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, by our reckonings, to have fallen in with it on the 28th, yet, though the weather was perfectly clear, we had no ſign of it at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet; about ten at night we diſcovered a light on the larboard bow, bearing from us N. N. E. and, ſoon after, the Trial's prize made the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for ſeeing a ſail. As we had none of us any doubt but that what we ſaw was a ſhip's light, we were all extremely animated with a firm perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that it was the Manilla galleon, that had been ſo long the object of our wiſhes. We immediately caſt off the Carmelo, and preſſed forward with all our canvas, making a ſignal for the Glouceſter to do the ſame. Thus we
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0204000302:354"/>
chaced the light, keeping all our hands at their reſpective quarters, under an expectation of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging within half an hour, as we ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the chace to be about a mile diſtant, and at other times to be within reach of our guns. In this conſtant and eager attention we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued all night, always preſuming that another quarter of an hour would bring us up to this Manilla ſhip, whoſe wealth we now eſtimated at round millions: but, when day-light came, we were moſt vexatiouſly diſappointed, by finding that the light which had occaſioned all this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectancy, was only a fire on the ſhore. At ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing, after this mortifying deluſion, we found ourſelves about nine leagues off land, extending from the N. W. to E. half N. On this land we obſerved two remarkable hammocks, which bore N. from us, and which a Spaniſh pilot and two Indians affirmed to be over the harbour of Acapulco; but we found them egregiouſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, theſe being in 17 deg. 56 min. whereas Acapulco lies in 17 deg. only.</p>
                  <p>Being now in the track of the Manilla gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon, it was a doubt with us, as it was near the end of January, whether ſhe was or was not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived: but, examining our priſoners about it, they aſſured us, ſhe was ſometimes known to come in after the middle of February; and they endeavoured to perſuade us, that the fire we had ſeen on ſhore was a proof that ſhe was yet at ſea, it being cuſtomary, as they ſaid, to make uſe of theſe fires as ſignals for her direction when
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0204000302:355"/>
ſhe continued out longer than ordinary. On this reaſoning of our priſoners, we reſolved to cruiſe for her ſome days, and we accordingly ſpread our ſhips at the diſtance of 12 leagues from the coaſt, in ſuch a manner that it was impoſſible ſhe ſhould paſs us unobſerved; however, not ſeeing her ſoon, we were very ſolicitous to gain ſome poſitive intelligence. With this view the Commodore reſolved to ſend a boat under cover of the night into the harbour of Acapulco, to ſee if the Manilla ſhip was there or not. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute this enterprize, the barge was diſpatched the 6th of February, carrying a ſufficient crew and two officers, as alſo a Spaniſh pilot and an Indian. Our barge did not return till the 11th, when the officers acquainted Mr. Anſon, that they had miſtaken the harbour, and that Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulco lay a conſiderable diſtance more to the eaſtward, and that, not having a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of proviſions for their paſſage thither, they were obliged to return to make known their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment. On this intelligence we made ſail to the eaſtward, and the next day we diſpatched the barge, with particular inſtructions to keep at a ſufficient diſtance not to be ſeen from the ſhore. We watched ſix days without receiving any intelligence, ſo that we began to be uneaſy for her ſafety; but on the 7th day ſhe returned with advice, that, being at the very place they ſought for, though they were then ignorant of their ſituation, they ſurprized a fiſhing canoe with three negroes, who told us that the Manilla
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0204000302:356"/>
galleon arrived at Acapulco on the 9th of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, but that, having delivered her cargo, ſhe was taking in water and proviſions in order to return; and that the Viceroy of Mexico had by proclamation fixed her departure from Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulco to the 14th of March. This laſt news was moſt joyfully received by us, ſince we had no doubt but ſhe muſt fall into our hands; and it was much more eligible to ſeize her on her return, than it would have been to have taken her before her arrival, as the money for which ſhe had ſold her cargo, and which ſhe would now have on board, would be much more eſteemed by us than the cargo itſelf. Thus we were a ſecond time engaged in an eager expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of meeting with this Manilla ſhip, which, by the ſame of its wealth, we had been taught to conſider as the moſt deſirable capture that was to be made on any part of the ocean.</p>
                  <p>As it was the 19th of February when the barge returned, and brought us our intelligence, and the galleon was not to ſail till the 3d of March, the Commodore reſolved to continue the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the intermediate time in his preſent ſtation to the weſtward of Acapulco, in order to avoid a diſcovery from the ſhore. During this interval we were employed in getting all things in readineſs to engage; and, when the long-wiſhed-for 3d of March came, we were all ſo ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed with the certainty of our intelligence, and with an aſſurance of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of port, that ſome or other of us were
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0204000302:357"/>
conſtantly imagining that they diſcovered one of our cutters returning with a ſignal; but, to our extreme vexation, both this day and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding night paſſed away without any news of her approach. However, we did not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, nor did we abate of our vigilance: but, after remaining till the 25th of March, we at length concluded, and we afterwards found it to be true, that we had been diſcovered, and that in conſequence an embargo had been laid upon the galleon, and her departure poſtponed till the next year.</p>
                  <p>The cutters, having on that day finiſhed their cruiſe before the harbour, returned to the ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, and the ſignal being given for the fleet to join, it was determined to retire to Chequetan, to take in a freſh ſupply of water, which was then nearly exhauſted. In the mean time, a cutter, commanded by Mr. Hughes, Lieutenant of the Trial's prize, was ordered to continue off the harbour of Acapulco for 24 days, in order that, if the galleon ſhould ſet ſail in that time, we might be ſpeedily informed of it.</p>
                  <p>On the 5th of April we entered the harbour of Chequetan, in lat. 17 deg. 36 min. N. about 30 leagues to the weſtward of Acapulco. The watering-place has the appearance of a large ſtanding lake, without any viſible outlet into the ſea, from which it is ſeparated by a part of the ſtrand. The origin of this lake is a ſpring that bubbles out of the ground, near half a mile within the country. We found its water a little
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0204000302:358"/>
brackiſh, but more conſiderably ſo towards the ſea ſide; for the nearer we advanced towards the ſpring-head, the ſofter and freſher it proved. This laid us under a neceſſity of filling all our caſks from the fartheſt part of the lake, which was facilitated by means of canoes which tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed the lake, and brought a number of ſmall caſks to the ſide next the beach; thence the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſtarted into larger veſſels in the boats, and by that contrivance brought on board with very little trouble.</p>
                  <p>As the country hereabouts, particularly the tract of coaſt contiguous to Acapulco, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be well peopled and cultivated, we hoped to have eaſily procured from thence ſome freſh proviſions, and other refreſhments, which we now ſtood much in need of. To facilitate theſe views, the Commodore, the morning after we came to an anchor, ordered a party of 40 men well armed to march into the country, and to endeavour to diſcover ſome town where they were to attempt to ſet on foot a correſpondence with the inhabitants; for, when we had once begun this intercourſe, we doubted not but by proper preſents we ſhould allure them to bring down to us whatever fruits or freſh proviſions were in their power. As our prizes abounded with various ſorts of coarſe merchandize, which were of little conſequence to us, though to them they would be extremely valuable, our people were directed on this occaſion to proceed with the greateſt circumſpection, and to make as little
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0204000302:359"/>
oſtentation of hoſtility as poſſible; for we were ſenſible we could find no wealth in thoſe parts worth our notice; and what neceſſaries we real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanted, we expected would be better, and more abundantly ſupplied, by an open, amicable traffic, than by violence and force of arms. But this endeavour of opening a commerce with the inhabitants proved ineffectual, and therefore we deſiſted from any more attempts of the ſame nature, contenting ourſelves with what we could procure for ourſelves in the neighbourhood of the port where we lay. We caught fiſh in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; among the reſt cavallies, bream, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, ſoals, fiddle-fiſh, and lobſters; and we here, and in no other place, met with that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fiſh called the Torpedo, which is in ſhape very much reſembling the fiddle-fiſh, and is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed from it in appearance by a brown circular ſpot of about the bigneſs of a crown-piece near the center of its back. This fiſh is, indeed, of a moſt ſingular nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbing whoever touches it all over his body, but more particularly that limb which happens to come in immediate contact with it. The ſame effect, too, will be in ſome degree produced by touching the fiſh with any thing held in the hand; and it has lately been diſcovered, that it may be communicated like the electrical ſhock to a large circle, by means of a certain appara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus much more ſimple than that which is uſed in experiments in electricity.</p>
                  <p>The animals which we met with on ſhore
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0204000302:360"/>
were chiefly guanoes, with which the country abounds, and which are by ſome reckoned deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious food. We ſaw no beaſts of prey, except we ſhould eſteem that amphibious creature the alligator as ſuch, ſeveral of which our people diſcovered, but none of them very large. It is, however, certain, that there were great numbers of tygers in the woods, though none of them happened to make their appearance while we remained upon the coaſt. Parrots and phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants were found in plenty, but by no means proper for food, being dry and taſteleſs, though they were often killed and eaten, being by ſome thought preferable to ſalt proviſions.</p>
                  <p>The papah, lime, and a little ſour plumb, were all the fruits the woods furniſhed, and of theſe there were but a ſcanty portion; nor was there any other uſeful vegetable, except brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, which, being eſteemed an antiſcorbutic, was frequently eaten, though from its bitterneſs it was exceedingly unpalatable.</p>
                  <p>While we lay at Chequetan, it was reſolved, after mature deliberation, to deſtroy all our prizes, as the whole number of men on board our ſquadron did not amount to the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a fourth-rate man of-war. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore judged moſt prudent to ſet fire to the ſhips, and to divide the men between the Centurion and Glouceſter, now preparing to ſet ſail for China. Beſides the neceſſary repairs for a voyage of ſuch length, the removal of their ſtores and cargoes into the men-of-war took up ſo much
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0204000302:361"/>
time, that it was the end of April before we were in a condition to leave the place.</p>
                  <p>It ſhould have been remarked, that, from this harbour of Chequetan we diſcovered but one pathway through the woods into the country; and as this was much beaten, we were from that circumſtance convinced, that it was not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by the natives. As it paſſed by the ſpring-head, and was the only avenue by which the Spaniards could approach to ſurprize us, we at ſome diſtance beyond the ſpring-head felled ſeveral large trees, and laid them one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acroſs the path, and at this barricadoe we conſtantly kept a guard. We, beſides, ordered our men employed in watering, to have their arms always in readineſs, in caſe of an alarm, and to march inſtantly to this poſt. And, though our principal intention herein was to prevent our being diſturbed by the enemy's horſe, yet it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered another purpoſe, which was, to hinder our people from ſtraggling ſingly into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where we had reaſon to believe they would be ſurprized by the Spaniards, who would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be very ſolicitous to pick up ſome of them, in hopes of getting intelligence of our future deſigns. To avoid this inconvenience the ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt orders were given to the centinels, to let no perſon whatever paſs beyond this poſt; but, notwithſtanding this precaution, we miſſed one Lewis Legere, who was the Commodore's cook. As he was a Frenchman and a Roman Catholic, it was at firſt imagined that lie had deſerted
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0204000302:362"/>
with a view of betraying all that he knew to the enemy; though this appeared, by the event, to be an ill-grounded ſurmiſe; for it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards known, that he had been taken by ſome Indians, who carried him priſoner to Acapulco, from whence he was tranſported to Mexico, and thence to Vera Cruz, where he was ſhipped on board a veſſel bound to Old Spain. But, the veſſel being obliged, by ſome accident, to put into Liſbon, Legere eſcaped on ſhore, and was by the Britiſh Conſul ſent from thence to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; where he gave the firſt authentic account of the ſafety of the Commodore, and of his principal tranſactions in the South Seas.</p>
                  <p>The relation he gave of his own ſeizure, was, that he rambled into the woods, at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the barricadoe where he had firſt attemped to paſs, but had been ſtopt and threatened to be puniſhed; that his principal view was to gather a quantity of limes for his maſter's ſtores; and that in this occupation he was ſurprized unawares by four Indians, who ſtript him naked, and carried him in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to Acapulco, expoſed to the ſcorching heat of the ſun, which at that time of the year ſhone with its greateſt violence; that afterwards, at Mexico, his treatment was ſufficiently ſevere; ſo that the whole courſe of his captivity was a continued inſtance of the hatred which the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards bear to all thoſe who endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb them in the peaceable poſſeſſion of the coaſts of the South Seas. Indeed, Legere's
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0204000302:363"/>
fortune was, upon the whole, extremely ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; as, after the hazards he had run in the Commodore's ſquadron, and the ſeverities he had ſuffered in his long confinement among the enemy, a more fatal diſaſter attended him on his return to England; for though, when he arrived in London, ſome of Mr. Anſon's friends intereſted themſelves in relieving him from the poverty to which his captivity had reduced him, yet he did not long enjoy the benefit of their humanity, ſince he was killed in an inſignificant night-brawl, the cauſe of which could ſcarcely ever be diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>When we were neceſſitated to proceed to Chequetan to recruit our water, the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore conſidered that our arrival in that harbour would ſoon be known at Acapulco; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hoped, that on the intelligence of our being employed in that port, the galleon might put to ſea, eſpecially as Chequetan is ſo very remote from the courſe generally ſteered by the galleons: he therefore ordered the cutter, as has already been noticed, to cruiſe twenty-four days off the Port of Acapulco, and her Commander was directed, on perceiving the galleon under ſail, to make the beſt of his way to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore at Chequetan. As the Centurion was certainly a much better ſailor than the galleon, Mr. Anſon, in this caſe, reſolved to have got to ſea as ſoon as poſſible, and to have purſued the galleon acroſs the Pacific Ocean; however,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0204000302:364"/>
the Viceroy of Mexico ruined this project, by detaining the galleon in port all the year.</p>
                  <p>Towards the latter end of April, all things being in readineſs for ſailing, the Centurion and Glouceſter weighed anchor; and, after having gained an offing, the prizes were ſet on fire, and a canoe fixed to a grapple in the middle of the harbour, with a bottle in it, well corked, incloſing a letter to Mr. Hughes, directing him to go back immediately to his former ſtation before Acapulco, where he would find Mr. Anſon, who reſolved to cruiſe for him in that ſtation ſome days. Indeed, it was no ſmall mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to us, now we were at ſea, and the ſtormy ſeaſon approaching, that we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the abſence of the cutter, and under a neceſſity of ſtanding towards Acapulco in ſearch of her. As the time of her cruiſe had been expired near a fortnight, we ſuſpected that ſhe had been diſcovered from the ſhore, and that the Governor of Acapulco had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſent out: force to ſeize her; which, as ſhe carried but ſix hands, was no very difficult enterprize. However, this being only conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Commodore, as ſoon as he was got clear of the harbour of Chequetan, ſtood along the coaſt to the eaſtward in ſearch of her; and, to prevent her from paſſing by us in the dark, we brought-to every night, and carried lights which the cutter could not but perceive.</p>
                  <p>By the 2d of May we were advanced within three leagues of Acapulco; and, having ſeen
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0204000302:365"/>
nothing of our boat, we gave her over for loſt; which, beſides the compaſſionate concern for our ſhipmates, and for what it was apprehended they might have ſuffered, was in itſelf a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, which in our preſent ſcarcity of hands we were greatly intereſted in; ſince the crew of the cutter were the flower of our people, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely picked out for this ſervice, as known to be, every one of them, of tried and approved reſolution, and as ſkilful ſeamen as ever trod a deck. However, as it was the general belief among us, that they were taken and carried into Acapulco, the Commodore's prudence ſuggeſted a project which we hoped would recover them. This was founded on our having many Spaniſh and Indian priſoners on board, ſome of them of quality. The Commodore, therefore, wrote a letter to the Governor of Acapulco, telling him, that he would releaſe them all, provided the Governor returned the cutter's crew. This letter was diſpatched by a Spaniſh officer, of whoſe honour we had a high opinion, and who was furniſhed with a launch belonging to one of our prizes, and a crew of Spaniards, who gave their parole for their return. The Spaniſh officer, too, beſides the Commodore's letter, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him a joint petition, ſigned by all the reſt of the priſoners, beſeeching the Governor to acquieſce in the terms propoſed for their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. But while we were thus contriving their releaſe, the centinel called out from the maſt-head, that he ſaw a boat under ſail at a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0204000302:366"/>
diſtance to the ſouth-eaſtward, which, to our unſpeakable joy, upon her nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, we found was our own cutter, the wan and meagre countenances of whoſe crew, the length of their beards, and the feeble and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low tone of their voices, convinced us that they had ſuffered much greater hardſhips than could be expected from even the ſeverities of a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh priſon. They were obliged to be helped into the ſhip, and were immediately put to bed; where, by reſt, and nouriſhing diet, with which they were plentifully ſupplied from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore's table, they recovered their health and vigour. And now we learnt that they had kept the ſea the whole time of their abſence, which was above ſix weeks; that, when they had finiſhed their cruiſe, and had juſt begun to ply to the weſtward, in order to join the ſquadron, a ſtrong adverſe current had forced them upwards of 80 leagues to leeward, where they found every where ſo great a ſurf, that there was no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of landing; that they paſſed ſome days in the moſt dreadful ſituation, without water, having no other means left them to allay their thirſt than ſucking the blood of the turtles which they caught; that at laſt, giving up all hopes of ſuccour, the heat of the climate too augmenting their neceſſities, and rendering their ſufferings inſupportable, they abandoned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to deſpair, fully perſuaded that they ſhould periſh by the moſt terrible of all deaths; but that ſoon after a moſt unexpected incident
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0204000302:367"/>
happily relieved them; for there fell ſo heavy a rain, that, on ſpreading their ſails horizontally, and putting bullets in the centers of them, they caught as much water as filled their caſks; that immediately upon this fortunate ſupply, they ſtood to the weſtward in queſt of the Commodore, and being now luckily favoured by a ſtrong current, they joined him in leſs than 50 hours from that time, after having been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the whole full 43 days.</p>
                  <p>And now having, to our entire ſatisfaction, got on board our people, and the ſeaſon of the year for ſailing to Aſia being far (we found it too far) advanced, the Commodore reſolved not to wait for any return from Acapulco, but gave orders to equip two large prize launches, to carry on ſhore the Spaniſh and Indian priſoners, both from ourſelves and the Glouceſter; and, having given them proviſions and all neceſſaries for Panama, whither they intended to ſail, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four in the evening they left us, to the number of about ſixty perſons, having firſt, though enemies, obſerved the cuſtom of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring people at parting, and wiſhed us a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous voyage.</p>
                  <p>From the 6th of May, the day we took our departure, we met with little remarkable for above a month, except that the true trade-wind, which is ſaid never to fail at about ſixty or ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>venty leagues from the ſhore of Mexico at the fartheſt, was ſo far from anſwering our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, that we had nothing but croſs winds,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0204000302:368"/>
ſqualls, rain, thunder and lightning, till by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we were 600 leagues to the weſtward of Acapulco, having been above 40 days in getting ſo far. The 9th, we found the foremaſt ſprung in a dangerous manner, and thereupon fiſhed and ſecured it very ſtrongly.</p>
                  <p>The 22d in the evening, we ſprung a leak, making 12 inches water in a watch, and on a ſearch found it to be on the larboard ſide, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaſt the main hatch-way, and not quite under water. The carpenters ſoon ſtopt it with very little trouble.</p>
                  <p>The 11th of June, we found a current to ſet to the ſouthward, about 24 miles a day, but could not diſcover whether to the eaſt or weſt, for want of opportunity to try it. This was by account about 450 leagues from Acapulco; and, much about this time, abundance of ſcorbutic ſymptoms, ſuch as blackneſs in the ſkin, hard nodes in the fleſh, ſhortneſs of breath, and a general laſſitude and weakneſs of all the parts, began to prevail, almoſt univerſally, among our people. This, with the great mortality we experienced from this diſtemper in our Cape Horn paſſage, and the time we might ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be at ſea, having yet 1800 leagues to thoſe iſlands called, by Sir Francis Drake, the Ladrones, or Iſlands of Thieves, from the thieviſh diſpoſition of the inhabitants, but by the Spaniards the Marian Iſlands, where only we could expect our next refreſhments; and no trade-wind being yet ſettled;—theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0204000302:369"/>
I ſay, gave us dreadful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of what this paſſage might terminate in; and the event ſhewed that we had but too much reaſon for them.</p>
                  <p>The 14th, at five in the evening, the Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, having ſprung the head of her main-maſt, 12 feet below the truſſel-trees, fired a gun as a ſignal of diſtreſs, on which we brought to, and waited for her; and, after enquiring into, and hearing the cauſe, we ſent them on board two carpenters to aſſiſt in fiſhing and ſecuring it; but the carpenters in concert, having viewed and conſidered the damage, reported, the next day, that the maſt was unfit to ſtand, and would not bear repairing; but that it muſt be ſhortened 26 feet from the head, and the top-maſt be ſet on the ſtump. This, therefore, was concluded on, and ordered accordingly.</p>
                  <p>The 23d, we found our own main-top-maſt ſprung in the wake of the cap; whereupon we reefed it 20 inches, that is, we lowered it ſo much, and ſecured it there, and fleeted and ſet up the ſhrouds and back-ſtays.</p>
                  <p>The 24th, in the evening, we got the top-maſt down, and put up another in its place, and a man falling overboard, we brought the ſhip to, and took him up ſafe; likewiſe, the ſlings of our croſsjack-yards being broke, we fixed new ones, and the next day got up the fore-top-gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant maſt and yard.</p>
                  <p>The 27th, we made the Glouceſter ſignal, and ſent our boat on board of her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="359" facs="tcp:0204000302:370"/>The 28th, we received from the Glouceſter half an anchor-ſtock, for a farther ſecurity to the fore-maſt.</p>
                  <p>The 29th, the Glouceſter finiſhed her jury-maſt, and made ſail on it. Nothing farther remarkable till</p>
                  <p>July 1ſt, we had freſh gales, and cloudy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with ſome lightning.</p>
                  <p>The 2d, we unbent the fore-ſail, and bent ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We had, not only now, but for almoſt our whole paſſage, abundance of birds of prey, alſo flying fiſh, which are their proper food, and vaſt quantities of ſkipjacks, albicores, &amp;c. whereof we took a great number, which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted much to our refreſhment after the loſs of the tortoiſes, that generally leave all ſhips about twenty or thirty leagues off the land. I think this the more worthy of notice, becauſe Dampier, Rogers, Cook, Cowley, and moſt other voyagers, ſome of whom have been not only once, but ſeveral times on this voyage, have reported, that they never ſaw a fiſh or fowl in this whole run. I will not ſay, as Mr. Cook frequently does, when any other perſon's account does not happen to ſquare exactly with what himſelf has obſerved, viz. <q rend="inline">"What credit is to be given to ſuch authors?"</q> never making allowances for contingencies which might or might not happen, and which would better have diſplayed his own impartiality, than a dogmatical condemnation of every other perſon, without
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0204000302:371"/>
examination. For my part, I readily believe and conclude, that this difference in our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and accounts is really occaſioned by the different ſeaſons of the year in which we happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to perform this paſſage; it being a known truth, and confirmed by the experience of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands in all ages, that moſt fiſh have their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſeaſons for their different rendezvouſes.</p>
                  <p>The 10th, we ſaw three gannets, or, as they call them in Scotland, ſoland geeſe; being, by what I can learn from the moſt intelligent of that nation whom I have converſed with, and who often have opportunity to obſerve them in ſeveral different parts, of one and the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; we likewiſe ſaw ſome ſee weeds; both which circumſtances made us imagine that ſome iſlands or ſhoals were not far off, thoſe fowls never being obſerved to fly very far out to ſea.</p>
                  <p>The 10th, we unbent the fore-top-ſail, and bent another.</p>
                  <p>The 12th, at noon, we were, by my account, 180 deg. 11 min. to the weſtward of the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of London, which is juſt 11 min. more than half round the globe, for which reaſon I note it. We were at this time, by my account, 1429 leagues diſtant from the port of Acapulco.</p>
                  <p>From this time till the 16th we had freſh gales, with ſqualls and rain.</p>
                  <p>The 17th and 18th, we had moderate and cloudy weather.</p>
                  <p>The 19th and 20th, freſh gales, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0204000302:372"/>
of rain. We made this obſervation, that, with rainy weather, or even ſlight tranſient ſhowers, the fiſh bit more freely, and were caught in greater numbers, than with fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which made our fiſhermen the more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive at ſuch times. It was likewiſe remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Glouceſter, when they could find opportunity to fiſh, had always much greater ſucceſs than we; whether their fiſhermen had more art than ours, or whatever elſe occaſioned it, the fact is true. They had alſo a better way of diſpoſing of them, when taken, if I may be allowed to judge, than we; for Capt. Mitchell conſtantly ordered ſeveral boys, who were very dexterous at it, to catch fiſh for the ſhip's company, eſpecially the ſick; and thoſe were very juſtly and regularly divided among them: whereas our fiſhermen were left at liberty to make their advantage of what they took, and to prey upon their ſuffering ſhipmates; and they took care not to overſlip the opportunity, for the leaſt fiſh you could purchaſe of them would coſt you a bottle of brandy; which, at this time, was worth four, or perhaps ſix, and ſometimes even eight ſhillings, or half a guinea; and you muſt be very thankful, and acknowledge yourſelf to be highly obliged into the bargain, or elſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect none next time, and very often fail of it notwithſtanding. About this time our people began to die very faſt, and, I believe, above five parts out of ſix of the ſhip's company were ill, and expected to follow in a ſhort time.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0204000302:373"/>
Thoſe, whoſe breath was any ways affected, dropt off immediately; but thoſe. who were attacked firſt in the more remote parts of the body, languiſhed generally a month or ſix weeks; the diſtemper advancing, in the mean time, towards the lungs, by a very regular and ſenſible approach. As I was myſelf one of thoſe who were ſeverely afflicted in this latter manner, I ſhall give ſuch an account of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, as I found by experience in myſelf, and corroborated by the ſimilar report of my fellow-ſufferers. I was firſt taken, about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this month, with a ſlight pain on the joint of my left great toe; but, having hurt that a little while before, I imagined it to be the effect of that hurt, and minded it the leſs—(but here I ſhall obſerve, once for all, that if ever any part of the body had received a bruiſe, ſtrain, or contuſion, if not perfectly cured, the ſcurvy was ſure to attack that part firſt); but, in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, a large black ſpot appearing on the part affected, with very intenſe pains at the bone, gave me to underſtand my caſe. I now took phyſic often, by way of prevention, but to little purpoſe: ſeveral hard nodes now began to riſe in my legs, thighs, and arms, and not only many more black ſpots appeared in the ſkin, but thoſe ſpread, till my legs and thighs were for the moſt part as black as a negroe; and this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſuch exceſſive pains in the joints of the knees, ancles, and toes, as I thought, before I experienced them, that human nature
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0204000302:374"/>
could never have ſupported. It next advanced to the mouth; all my teeth were preſently looſe, and my gums, over-charged with extravaſated blood, fell down almoſt quite over my teeth: this occaſioned my breath to ſmell much, yet without affecting my lungs; but, I believe, one week more at ſea would have ended me, and leſs than a month more, all the reſt. One thing was very remarkable, and likewiſe univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, which was, that, when the diſtemper had far prevailed, if the afflicted perſon lay quiet in his hammock, he ſeemed to be perfectly well and hearty; but, if he was removed out of it, on any neceſſity, he immediately fainted away; and this was always a ſure ſign of the party's diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>Since our paſſing Cape Horn, our ſurgeon, Henry Ettrick, who was a very good practical ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, had been very buſy in digeſting a theory of ſcurvies, wherein he enumerated many caſes very particularly, having been allowed to open and examine as many bodies as were abundantly ſufficient for that purpoſe. His ſyſtem was principally grounded on the obſervations made on a long paſſage in a very cold climate. He took abundance of pains to prove, by many inſtances, that the tone of the blood was broken by the cold nipping air, and rendered ſo thin, as to be unfit for circulation, or any other of the uſes of life; and being thus deprived of a proper force and vigour, ſtagnation and death muſt neceſſarily enſue. From this ſuppoſition,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0204000302:375"/>
he had laid it down as an infallible rule, that food of a glutinous nature, ſuch as ſalt fiſh, bread, and ſeveral ſorts of grain, were alone proper on ſuch voyages. As for liquids, I know not which he had pitched on, as the moſt ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, on this occaſion. But this paſſage, in a very hot climate, where the ſymptoms were not only more dreadful, but the mortality much more quick and fatal, in proportion to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people, put our ſcheming doctor to a ſad non-plus: he could not account for this on the ſame principles with the other; nay, they muſt be, in a manner, diametrically oppoſite. All this obliged him at laſt (though he was ſtill endeavouring to reconcile contradictions), to own, that, though ſome of the concurrent cauſes of this diſeaſe were plain enough, yet the grand cauſe was certainly the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at ſea, or an entire ſecret; and that no cure but the ſhore would ever be effectual. The Commodore, on this great mortality, having by him a quantity of Ward's pills and drops, in order to experience whether they would be of any uſe, firſt tried them on himſelf, and then gave what he had left to the ſurgeon, to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to ſuch of the ſick people as were willing to take them. The ſurgeon would not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to any perſon, but ſeveral took them; though I know of none who believed they were of any ſervice to them. They worked moſt people who took them very violently, both by vomit and ſtool: after which, as ſeveral told
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0204000302:376"/>
me, they would ſeem to be a little eaſier, tho' weaker, for perhaps a day or two, but then they always relapſed, and became worſe than before; and this, together with the inefficacy of all that our ſurgeons could do in the caſe, ſufficiently ſhewed the vanity of attempting the cure of this diſtemper at ſea.</p>
                  <p>And here, before I quit this ſubject, I ſhall endeavour to remove a prejudice, under which the afflicted have long ſeverely ſuffered; and that is, from the notion generally prevalent, that none but the lazy are attacked with this diſorder; whereas, the direct contrary is the truth; our experience having abundantly ſhewn, that the moſt laborious, active, ſtirring perſons were ofteneſt ſeized with this diſeaſe; and the continuation of their labour, inſtead of curing, only helped to kill them the ſooner.</p>
                  <p>Many undeniable inſtances might be given of this in our voyage; and, if future voyagers will give themſelves the trouble of obſerving this hereafter, I am certain that the event will correſpond with my aſſertion; nor does this diſtemper, in a general way, incline people to indolence, till it is come to that height, that, at the leaſt motion, the perſon is ready to faint. It is certain, that, if the perſon afflicted deſires to lengthen out his life as long as he can, his beſt way is to ſtir as little as poſſible. This I have ſeen verified by many inſtances.</p>
                  <p>The 23d and 24th, we reefed and repaired our
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0204000302:377"/>
rigging, which had ſuffered much in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable weather.</p>
                  <p>The 26th, being, according to our reckoning, 300 leagues from the Ladrones, we met with a weſterly wind, which did not come about again in four days. This was a moſt diſpiriting inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as we were all that while forced to lie to, the current inſenſibly driving us out of our courſe.</p>
                  <p>The 27th, our gunner, Henry Kipps, died of the ſcurvy, being one of the moſt able-bodied men, as well as the moſt active in the ſhip: he had taken Ward's medicines once or twice.</p>
                  <p>On the 28th, we had calms with much rain, and received from the Glouceſter 20 caſks of flour and four of groats. Having here an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of mentioning flour, it may not be amiſs to take notice, that, ſince our departure from Juan Fernandez, the principal officers had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſoft bread new baked, the biſcuit being ſo much worm-eaten, it was ſcarce any thing but duſt, and a little blow would reduce it to that ſtate immediately. Our beef and pork were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very ruſty and rotten; and the ſurgeon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perſuade us from eating it, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was, though a ſlow, yet a ſure poiſon; but very little other food being to be had, we were reduced to a very deplorable condition.</p>
                  <p>The 29th, in the morning, the Glouceſter's fore cap ſplitting, her fore-top-maſt came by the board, and, in its fall, meeting with the fore-yard, broke it in the ſlings. As ſhe was hereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0204000302:378"/>
incapable of making any ſail for ſome time, we were under a neceſſity, as ſoon as a gale ſprung up, to take her in tow, and near 20 of the healthieſt and ableſt of our ſeamen were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the duty of our own ſhip, and were continued eight or ten days together to aſſiſt in repairing her damages; but theſe things, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying as we thought them, were only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of our misfortunes; for, ſcarce had our people finiſhed their buſineſs in the Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, before we met with a moſt violent ſtorm from the weſtern board, which obliged us to lie to. This ſtorm laſted from the 10th to the 13th of Auguſt, attended with rain, thunder, and lightning, and ſuch a lofty and dangerous ſea as I have ſeldom ſeen, and could not have believed in latitudes between the Tropics, eſpecially for ſuch a long duration. Moſt of the time we lay to, we drove to the northward; abundance of our people died daily; and, the ſhip proving very leaky, every perſon who could ſtir, the principal officers not excepted, was obliged to take his turn at the pumps, and all little enough to keep us above water.</p>
                  <p>The 13th of Auguſt, at 10 in the morning, the Glouceſter made a ſignal of diſtreſs, and, being to windward, bore down towards us; but we obſerved ſhe was long in wearing, rolled very much, and made bad ſteerage. About half an hour after noon they ſpoke with us, and told us that they were ſo leaky that they muſt quit their ſhip; that they had ſeven feet water in the hold;
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0204000302:379"/>
and that all the men they had capable of ſtirring were quite exhauſted with pumping, and could work no longer. This was an additional mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and ſeemed to be without reſource; for, whilſt the Glouceſter's crew were thus enfeebled, our own ſick were now ſo much increaſed, and thoſe who ſtill remained in health, ſo over-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued with labour, that it was impoſſible for us to lend them any aid: all, therefore, that could be done was to ſend our boat on board for a more particular account of the ſhip's condition; as it was ſoon ſuſpected, that the taking her people on board us, and then deſtroying the Glouceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was the only meaſure that could be proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the preſent emergency both for the preſervation of their lives and of our own.</p>
                  <p>Our boat ſoon returned with a repreſentation of the melancholy ſtate of the Glouceſter, and of her ſeveral defects, ſigned by Capt. Mitchell and all his officers; by which it appeared, that the ſhip was decayed in every part; that her crew was greatly reduced; that there remained alive no more than 77 men, officers included, 18 boys, and two priſoners; that of the whole number, only 16 men and 11 boys were capable of keeping the deck, and ſeveral of theſe very infirm; that the water was ſo deep in the hold, that thoſe who were yet alive were ſtarving, and could neither come at freſh water nor proviſions.</p>
                  <p>From this repreſentation, which was in no one inſtance exaggerated, the Commodore ſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0204000302:380"/>
an order to Capt. Mitchell, to bring his people on board the Centurion, and to take out ſuch ſtores as could moſt eaſily be come at, among which he was very deſirous of ſaving two cables, and a ſheet anchor; but the ſhip rolled ſo much, and the men were ſo exceſſively fatigued, that it was with the greateſt difficulty the prize-money was ſecured, (the prize-goods amounting to many thouſand pounds being abandoned): nor could any other proviſions be got at, than five caſks of flour, (three of which were ſpoiled by the ſalt-water), a ſmall quantity of brandy, and ſome living ſtock. Even this little buſineſs was ſo languiſhingly performed, that two days were waſted in the execution, during which time three or four of the ſick periſhed on being removed.</p>
                  <p>As the weather was now calm, and we were uncertain how far diſtant we might be from Guam, a ſettlement in poſſeſſion of the enemy, to whom the wreck of ſuch a ſhip with guns and ammunition on board would have been a very valuable acquiſition, the Commodore judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt effectual way to prevent her from falling into their hands was to ſet her on fire: and accordingly, as ſoon as the Captain and his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers had quitted her, the combuſtibles placed for that purpoſe were lighted, and ſhe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed burning the whole night, and at ſix the next morning ſhe blew up. Thus periſhed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſhip the Glouceſter; and now, it might have been expected, that, being freed from
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0204000302:381"/>
the embarraſſment in which her frequent diſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had involved us, we ſhould have proceeded on our way much briſker than we had hitherto done. However, we were ſoon taught, that our anxieties were not yet to be relieved.</p>
                  <p>We were at this time in the utmoſt diſtreſs; the ſhip conſiderably lumbered with prize-goods, and the ſmall room we had left thronged with the ſick, whoſe numbers were now very much increaſed with thoſe from the Glouceſter; the dirt, nauſeouſneſs, and ſtench, almoſt every where intolerable; more people daily diſabled with the diſeaſe; no ſign of land, nor but very little wind, and that not fair but variable; very bad proviſions and water, and the ſhip very leaky; and, though we diſcovered the leak to be in her bows on each ſide the ſtern, it lay in ſuch a manner that we could not ſtop it, nay the attempting it rather made it worſe. In this diſtreſs we made the beſt of every little ſpurt of wind.</p>
                  <p>Nothing farther remarkable happened till Sunday the 22d, when, about eight in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we diſcovered two iſlands, one bearing W. half S. and the other S. W. by W. at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of about 10 leagues. We were overjoyed at this ſight, and ſtood toward them with all our ſail; but, there being little wind, we did not get near them till the next day about noon, when being about three miles off the largeſt and moſt promiſing of them, which appeared very hilly and full of trees, we ſent on ſhore one of our Lieutenants in the cutter to make diſcoveries,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0204000302:382"/>
who returned at nine in the evening, and gave us but a very indifferent account of the ſhore. The trees were moſtly cocoa-nut-trees, of which there were prodigious quantities; about 60 co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coa nuts they brought on board with them, but they could find no water, nor any good place to anchor in: on this account it was thought fit to ſtand further to the ſouthward, for ſome more proper place. This was a ſevere diſappointment to moſt of the ſick, who, on the ſight of land, (or hearing that we were ſo near it) had begun ſenſibly to revive: but as perſons in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are ſoon driven to deſpond, when an aid they had depended upon deſerts them, ſo this diſappointment deſtroyed our hopes, and increaſed our dejection. We feared, that, if we met with more iſlands in the ſame run, they might be either as bad, worſe, or inhabited by our enemies the Spaniards, who, in our weak condition, might eaſily be able to hinder us from proper refreſhments: add to this, how near ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us were to death, and how little we could expect to ſurvive any time in ſearching for other iſlands. I know not whether theſe were the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral thoughts of the ſick, but I muſt own they were mine, and made our ſituation at that time appear ten times worſe to me than at any other in the whole courſe of our voyage. I was indeed very ill, and my illneſs might poſſibly occaſion every thing to appear in its worſt light, yet I never was one of thoſe who were frightened at the apprehenſion, or even the viſible approach
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0204000302:383"/>
of death; it had no unreaſonable terrors in any of its proſpects to me; and I always could, and I hope always ſhall be ready to meet it with calmneſs and perfect reſignation: but I believe the healthieſt and ſtouteſt at that time had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the greateſt apprehenſions; and I have ſince heard it from many of thoſe, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected all to have periſhed, had we been ſo little as three weeks longer at ſea; and I much queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether they were not right in that expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>On the 26th, at five in the morning, we ſaw three other iſlands, bearing from S. E. by S. to N. E. the middlemoſt of the three, which was the largeſt, due E.</p>
                  <p>The 27th, at three in the afternoon, being got pretty near the ſhore of the middlemoſt iſland, we ſent our cutter and pinnace in-ſhore for diſcovery. At four the pinnace came off, and brought with her an Indian paroo, with a Spaniard and four Indians, whom they took in her. They likewiſe told us, that they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore a ſmall bark of about 16 tons, and between 20 and 30 more people on the iſland, all of whom had been ſent there from Guam to kill cattle and hogs, and make jerked beef and cocoa-nut-oil, &amp;c. for the Spaniſh garriſon there; and that there are conſtantly people ſent on that account, who, after ſome months ſtay at that place, are relieved by freſh parties for the ſame purpoſe. We ſecured both bark and paroo, together with all the Indians who fell into our hands, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0204000302:384"/>
their carrying intelligence of us to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards at Guam. One of thoſe Indians was a carpenter by trade, and his father was one of the principal builders at Manilla. This young man, having been ill uſed by the Governor at Guam, voluntarily entered with us, and became one of our carpenter's crew, and proved a very uſeful handy fellow.</p>
                  <p>The Spaniard being examined as to the ſtate of the iſland we were now approaching, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he gave ſurpaſſed even our moſt ſanguine hopes; and, tho' uninhabited, he ſaid, it wanted none of thoſe accommodations with which the beſt cultivated countries are furniſhed. On muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering up our whole force, as we drew near, all the hands we could collect capable of any kind of duty, even on the moſt preſſing occaſions, amounted to no more than 71 men, officers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. This number, inconſiderable as it may ſeem, were all of the united crews of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, Glouceſter, and Trial, that could move without being aſſiſted, notwithſtanding that, when we left England, they conſiſted of near 1000 men.</p>
                  <p>When we had entered the road, our firſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, after furling the ſails and ſecuring the ſhip, was to provide an hoſpital on ſhore for the ſick; but the officer and ſeamen who were ſent upon this ſervice, returned joyfully, and acquainted us, that the Indians on ſhore had ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that trouble, and had provided for us better than we could have done for ourſelves;
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0204000302:385"/>
for, having erected a number of little cabbins for their accommodation during their reſidence on the iſland, and one in particular, which they made uſe of by way of ſtorehouſe to ſtow their proviſions in, there could be nothing more ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably adapted for the reception both of the ſick and the healthy than theſe erections. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, we inſtantly began ſending aſhore as many of the ſick as could poſſibly be conveyed, among which number I myſelf was one; I ſay, as many as could poſſibly be conveyed, for we were all ſo extremely feeble and helpleſs, that we were no otherwiſe to be landed than by being carried in our hammocks, both in and out of the boats, on mens ſhoulders, in which ſervice both the Commodore himſelf and his officers very hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely aſſiſted; and, indeed, they were almoſt the only perſons on board capable of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; the healthieſt ſeamen being ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled, that they had but juſt ſtrength enough left to help themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The next day, being the 29th, the remainder of the ſick were brought on ſhore, of whom 21 men died; but the greateſt part of the reſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſurprizingly. As ſoon as I was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſtirring about, I found the iſland to lie in lat. 14 deg. 58 min. N. [Walters ſays 15 deg. 8 min.] and in long. 223 deg. 35 min. W. from London, being, according to my reckoning, 117 deg. 7 min W. from Acapulco. [Walters ſays 114 deg. 50 min.] And here it is obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, how writers of the firſt characters for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0204000302:386"/>
differ in their accounts of the ſame places, by writing them at different periods. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this iſland of Tinian by Commodore Byron, who lately viſited it in his voyage round the world, bears no ſimilitude to that we are now about to recite; nor can any one conceive how an interval of only 30 years could occaſion ſo remarkable an alteration. But to proceed:</p>
                  <p>The ſoil, upon examination, we found to be every where dry and healthy; and being withal ſomewhat ſandy, it was thereby the leſs diſpoſed to a rank and over-luxuriant vegetation: and hence the meadows and woods were neater and ſmoother than is uſual in hot climates. The vallies and hills were moſt beautifully diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the mutual encroachments of woods and lawns, which ſkirted each other, and traverſed the iſland in large tracts. The woods conſiſted of tall and well-ſpread trees, ſome celebrated for their beauty, and ſome for their fruit; whilſt the lawns were generally crouded with herds of cattle, of which it was not uncommon to ſee thouſands feeding in a herd, and, being all milk-white, it is no wonder that ſuch an appearance excited our longings, and increaſed our impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, to kill and eat. Add to theſe, the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſwarms of poultry that crouded the woods, and, by their frequent crowings, gave us in idea the pleaſing apprehenſion of being in the neighbourhood of farms and villages; and we even fancied, that in the covert of the woods
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0204000302:387"/>
we ſhould find ſuch concealed. The cattle we had ſight of were computed at 10,000; and, beſides theſe and the poultry, we likewiſe found abundance of wild hogs, which were excellent food, but fierce, and not eaſily maſtered. At firſt we killed them by ſhooting; but, our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition failing, owing to an accident, we at laſt hunted them down with dogs, ſeveral of which joined us on the iſland, and, being train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſport by the Indians, readily enough followed us, and afforded us good diverſion. In their conflicts with the boars, ſome indeed were killed; but thoſe that came off victorious, were ſtill more eager to engage in every new purſuit.</p>
                  <p>This iſland was no leſs fortunate to us in its vegetable than in its animal productions; more particularly abounding in ſuch fruits and plants as were beſt adapted to the cure of that diſeaſe by which we had been ſo dreadfully debilitated. In the woods cocoa nuts were to be gathered without number; and, what is remarkable, cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages grew on the ſame trees. There were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, guavas, limes, ſweet and ſour oranges, and, what is common to all the Tropical iſlands, bread-fruit. In the plains we found water melons, dandelion, creeping-purſlain, mint, ſcurvy-graſs, and ſorrel; all which, together with the freſh-meats of the place, were ſuch ſalutary refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the ſick, who were at death's-door when they landed, before they had been a week on ſhore, put on very different countenances,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0204000302:388"/>
and with their new complexions received a freſh recruit of ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Amidſt ſuch a variety of proviſions as the land furniſhed, it was thought unneceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge ourſelves in thoſe offered us by the ſea. From fiſh, therefore, we wholly refrained; and the rather, as ſome we caught at our firſt arrival ſurfeited thoſe who eat of them. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was not regretted, as beef, pork, poultry, and wild-fowl, were in ſuch plenty, that, except the trouble of bringing them from a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance ſometimes, there was no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty attending their procurement. It were, indeed, an endleſs taſk to recount all the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and delicacies we met with in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful iſland: nor is it eaſy to ſay which to prefer where every thing is worthy of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the neatneſs of its lawns, the ſtatelineſs, freſhneſs, and fragrance of its woods, the happy inequality of its ſurface, and the variety and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of the views it afforded,—all theſe conſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to charm the ſight, while at the ſame time the excellency of its productions could not fail to gratify the appetite. And theſe advantages were greatly enhanced by the healthineſs of the climate, by the almoſt conſtant cool breezes that prevailed, and by the frequent gentle ſhowers that ſeemed to fall juſt to refreſh the earth, and add to its fertility; for theſe, inſtead of the long-continued rains that in other countries fill the air with noxious vapours, and overflow the earth with waſteful inundations, ſeemed juſt enough
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0204000302:389"/>
to purify the air, and to refreſh the ſoil; which was obſervable enough by the effect it had in increaſing our appetites, and promoting our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. This effect was, indeed, remarkable, ſince thoſe amongſt our officers, who were at all other times ſpare and temperate eaters, were here in appearance transformed into gluttons; for inſtead of one reaſonable fleſh-meal a day, they were ſcarcely ſatisfied with three: and yet our digeſtion ſo well correſponded to the keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our appetites, that we were neither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered nor even loaded by this uncommon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion; for, after having made a large beef breakfaſt, it was not long before we began to conſider the approach of dinner as a very deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and even ſomewhat tardy event.</p>
                  <p>The principal inconveniences that attended our reſidence upon this iſland aroſe from the vaſt number of muſketos and other troubleſome flies, by which we were perpetually teized; there was likewiſe a venomous little inſect, that, like the ſheep-ticks in England, would bury its head in the ſkin, and, if not inſtantly removed, would cauſe an inflammation.</p>
                  <p>Running water there was none in the iſland; but that defect was ſupplied by a large lake, or lagoon, almoſt in the center of it, to which the cattle, in times of drought, generally reſorted; but the freſhneſs of their paſture, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious dews and gentle ſhowers that often moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened it, rendered that reſource almoſt unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. There were, beſides, ſprings of excellent
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0204000302:390"/>
water, and near the ſurface wells might every where be dug, whoſe waters, in any other place, would not have been complained of.</p>
                  <p>But the great danger we had to dread remains to be told. During four months in the year, that is, from the middle of June to the middle of October, when the weſtern monſoons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, the winds, about the full and change of the moon, are variable, and blow with ſuch fury, that the ſtouteſt cables afford no ſecurity to ſhips riding at anchor in the road: and what adds to the danger is the rapidity of the tide, which ſets to the S. E. and occaſions ſuch a hollow and over-grown ſea as is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; inſomuch that, though we were in a ſixty-gun ſhip, we were under the dreadful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of being pooped by it. During the reſt of the year the weather is conſtantly ſettled, and ſhips have nothing to fear, if their cables are well armed, which otherwiſe will ſuffer from the foulneſs of the ground.</p>
                  <p>From the 29th of Auguſt, when our ſick were all put on ſhore, to the 12th of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when the Commodore himſelf landed, thoſe who remained on board were chiefly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in mooring and ſecuring the ſhip, in ſhifting her guns to come at her leaks, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ackling the cables, to prevent their being gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the friction againſt the rocky bottom. At the ſame time an anchor and cable were put on board the Spaniſh bark, her own being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a heavy log of wood, and a rope made of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0204000302:391"/>
baſs; and ſome barrels of powder to be dried and recovered, which by long keeping was become moiſt.</p>
                  <p>From the 12th to the 18th, the hands were continually ſhifting, thoſe who were ſo well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered as to be capable of duty were ſent on board, and thoſe who had born the burden of the labour were relieved and ſent on ſhore.</p>
                  <p>On the 19th, the weather began to alter, and to threaten a ſtorm: on that day, the next, and the 21ſt, it blew hard; however, we rode it out, and flattered ourſelves that the prudence of our meaſures had ſecured us from accidents, On the 22d, the hurricane came on, and our only hope of ſafety ſeemed to depend on our putting out to ſea; but the Commodore was on ſhore, and all communication with the land ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely cut off. At five in the afternoon, the ſmall bower parted, and the ſhip ſprung off to the beſt bower. As night approached, the violence of the ſtorm increaſed; yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding its inexpreſſible fury, the rapidity of the tide was ſuch as to prevail over it, and to force the ſhip before it, as it were, in deſpight of its utmoſt rage. It was now that the ſea broke all round us in a moſt tremendous manner; and that a large tumbling ſwell threatened to ingulph us in its boſom: the long-boat, which was moored a ſtern, was on a ſudden canted ſo high that it broke the tranſum of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore's gallery, and would, doubtleſs, have riſen as high as the tafferel, had it not been for the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0204000302:392"/>
ſtroke, which ſtove the boat to pieces; but yet the poor boat-keeper, though much bruiſed, was ſaved almoſt by miracle. About eight, the tide ſlackened; but, the wind not abating, the the beſt bower cable, by which alone we rode, parted at eleven. In this extremity, Mr. Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marez, our Firſt Lieutenant, who commanded in the abſence of the Commodore, ordered guns to be fired, and lights to be ſhewn, as ſignals of diſtreſs; and, in a ſhort time after, the night being exceſſively dark, the ſtorm raging, the thunder roaring, and nothing to be ſeen but the blue lightning flaſhing through the rain, we were driven to ſea, and, by this cataſtrophe, the whole crew, both by ſea and land, reduced to a ſtate of deſpair; thoſe on ſhore concluding they had now no means left them ever to get home; whilſt thoſe on board, being utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared to ſtruggle with the fury of ſuch ſeas and winds, expected each moment to be their laſt. In this ſtate of deſpondency, while thoſe on board were every moment in expectation of being daſhed againſt the rocks of Aiguigan, an iſland at about three leagues from Tinian, thoſe on ſhore were perſuaded the ſhip could not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the ſtorm, the whole channel between the two iſlands appearing from the land like one continued breach, the ſea ſwelling, breaking, and roaring, like mountains rolling over moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and forming the moſt awful and terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſight that the mind of man can poſſibly conceive. Indeed, the condition of thoſe on
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0204000302:393"/>
board was truly pitiable; they were in a leaky ſhip, with three cables in their hawſes, to one of which hung their only remaining anchor; they had not a gun on board laſhed; nor a port barred in; their ſhrouds were looſe; and their fore top-maſt unrigged; and they had ſtruck their fore and main yards down before the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane came on, ſo that there was no ſail they could ſet except the mizzen: to add to their misfortunes, they were no ſooner at ſea, than, by the labouring of the ſhip, whole floods of water ruſhed in through the hawſe-holes, ports, and ſcuppers; which, with the uſual leakage, kept the pumps conſtantly at work. Perſuaded that their deſtruction was inevitable, ſinking, however, was only their ſecondary concern; they judged, by the driving of the ſhip, that they were making towards the land, and that, in the darkneſs of the night, they ſhould no otherwiſe perceive it than by ſtriking upon it; but day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light relieved them from that uneaſy appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, and ſhewed them that the iſland they ſo much dreaded was at a conſiderable diſtance, and that a ſtrong northern current had proved the means of their preſervation. It was not, however, till after three days that the turbulent weather that had driven them from Tinian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to abate; when every man in the ſhip was ſo worn out with fatigue, that they found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to man the pumps, and hand the ſails at the ſame time. They had twice attempted to heave up the main and fore yards, in which
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0204000302:394"/>
they had as often miſcarried by the breaking of the jeers, and in the laſt effort one of their beſt men periſhed. During all this time the ſhip was driving to leeward, and dragging her ſheet anchor, the only one ſhe had left, with two cables an end at her bows. This was a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the greateſt conſequence, and required a ſpeedy remedy; for, though upon a third exertion of their whole force, they had replaced their yards, they durſt not, while the anchor continued in that ſituation, venture to ſpread their canvas. Some reſt and refreſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came neceſſary before a work of ſuch labour could be propoſed to a feeble and diminiſhed crew, who hardly conſiſted of 100 men: It was, therefore, five days after their departure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could ſecure their anchor; and now they ſet their courſes, and, for the firſt time, ſtood to the eaſtward, in hopes of ſoon regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the iſland, and rejoining their Commander and the reſt of their company: but in this they were unhappily diſappointed; for having run, as they thought, the diſtance neceſſary for making the iſland, and being in full expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſeeing it, they found themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildered by the irregularity of the currents, and knew not what courſe to ſteer, till, after ſeveral days uncertainty, they came at laſt in ſight of Guam, from whence they directed their courſe with infinite labour to Tinian, the wind being conſtantly againſt them, and the tide variable. This ſevere employment held till the 11th of
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0204000302:395"/>
October, when, after nineteen days abſence, they appeared again in the offing, and were rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced from the ſhore, to the inexpreſſible joy of the whole crew.</p>
                  <p>A few days after the ſhip was driven off, ſome of the people on ſhore cried out, <hi>A ſail!</hi> and this ſpread a general joy, ſuppoſing it to be the Centurion returning; but preſently a ſecond ſail was deſcried, which wholly deſtroyed the firſt conjecture, and made it difficult to gueſs who they were. The Commodore turning his glaſs towards them, ſaw they were two boats; and inſtantly concluding that the Centurion was gone to the bottom, and that thoſe were her boats returning with the remains of her people, this ſudden ſuggeſtion wrought ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully upon him, that, to conceal his emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was obliged to retire to his tent, where he paſt ſome bitter moments in the firm perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that all his hopes were now at an end, and that, inſtead of diſtreſſing the enemy, he muſt himſelf with his people fall a prey to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentleſs cruelty. He was, however, ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from this mortifying thought, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, upon their nearer approach, to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian proas, directing their courſe towards the bay, with a view, as was ſuppoſed, to relieve their countrymen, or to take on board their proviſions. On this intelligence, the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore ordered his people to conceal themſelves; but the proas, after advancing within a quarter of a mile of the ſhore, lay by for the ſpace of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0204000302:396"/>
a few hours, and probably obſerving ſome change in the appearance of the place, which might raiſe their ſuſpicion that an enemy lay in ambuſh, they got again under ſail, and ſteered to the ſouthward.</p>
                  <p>After this incident an opinion began gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to prevail, that the Centurion would never more appear at this iſland; and that ſhe was either loſt, or forced upon the coaſt of China, from whence, in her crazy condition, it would be impoſſible for her ever to return. Though the Commodore did not apparently give into this opinion, yet he was not without his fears; and, therefore, to provide againſt the worſt, he propoſed cutting aſunder the Indian bark which they took on their firſt arrival, and lengthening her in ſuch a manner as to be capable of taking on board all who were then upon the iſland, and following the ſhip, if peradventure ſhe ſhould be driven to Mocao. After ſome heſitation, owing to the difficulty attending the execution, the men were at length prevailed upon to engage in the work, and the Commodore by his example en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged their diligence; for, being always at work by day-break himſelf, it was thought a diſgrace to be idle when their Chief was employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It fortunately happened, that the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters both of the Glouceſter and Trial were on ſhore, and that they had brought for ſafety their cheſts of tools with them. The ſmith, too, was on ſhore with his forge, but his bellows was ſtill in the ſhip. This defect occaſioned ſome
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0204000302:397"/>
delay; but was ſoon ſupplied by the ingenuity of his ſhip-mates, one or other of them never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a loſs for expedients on ſuch occaſions: they limed a freſh hide for leather, the carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhaped out a wooden frame, and a gun bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel ſerved for a nozel. The ſmith being now in readineſs to prepare the iron-work, ſome were employed in cutting down trees, nnd ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into plank, whilſt the main-body were buſied in digging out a draw-dock to receive the bark, and in laying of ways to heave her up and down. All, in ſhort, were variouſly employed; and the work went on ſucceſsfully for 16 days, in which time the bark was ſawn aſunder, her two parts ſeparated, and placed at the proper diſtance from each other; and, the materials be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all in readineſs before-hand, they proceeded with no ſmall diſpatch in the enlargement, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they fixed the 5th of November as the day when they ſhould be ready to depart. The alacrity with which this buſineſs was carried on, left no room for reflection among the common ſailors, though their ſuperiors were not without their fears. They had no ſea-proviſions, except ſome jerked beef, which the Indians had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and abandoned when they fled, and they had a run of 600 leagues before they could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon a ſupply; they had no bread, and the bread fruit on the iſland could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at ſea; they wanted ſalt; and, what was ſtill a more neceſſary article in their preſent ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, they wanted ammunition for their defence,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0204000302:398"/>
in caſe of an attack from the enemy; for, upon the ſtricteſt ſearch, no more than 90 charges of powder could be collected, which was ſhort of one round a-piece for each of the company; they were, too, in an unknown ſea, and wanted inſtruments to direct their courſe: in ſhort, though the common men had no other thought but how they ſhould get on board, the officers foreſaw a thouſand difficulties, which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſurmountable to human apprehenſion, but which they carefully concealed, that the main buſineſs might not be retarded.</p>
                  <p>But, in the midſt of theſe gloomy apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which, the nearer the time of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture approached, ſtill became the more ſerious, and when all hope of ſeeing the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion at Tinian had ſubſided, one of the Glouceſter's men, being upon a hill at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance looking out for cattle, perceived, as he fancied, ſomething like a ſhip in the clouds, which, on ſteadily obſerving it, ſeemed to move ſlowly towards the land. It was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was ſenſible of its approach, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading himſelf it was the Centurion, he in an extacy ran towards the landing-place, crying to his comrades, <hi>The ſhip! The ſhip!</hi> This being heard by the neareſt, was echoed from mouth to mouth till it reached the ſpot where the Commodore was at work, who, on hearing the joyful news, threw down his axe, and joined in the general tranſport. In a few hours the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion appeared in the offing, and a boat with
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0204000302:399"/>
18 men was ſent off to reinforce her, and to carry freſh meats, fruits, and refreſhments, for the crew. In the afternoon of the 11th of October ſhe happily caſt anchor, the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore went inſtantly aboard, and the joy and congratulations on that occaſion were equally ſincere and mutual.</p>
                  <p>The labour of the artificers was now at an end, and another kind of employment ſucceeded, which was that of laying in water for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the voyage. Now alſo hunting, ſhouting, ſetting, and every device that could be contrived to catch live cattle, hogs, and poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for ſtores, took, place; while, at the ſame time, the Commodore and Officers amuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with traverſing the iſland, and examining more minutely its ſeveral parts. In one of theſe excurſions, being on a riſing ground, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in a valley beneath them, the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a ſmall thicket, which, by attending to it, ſeemed to have a progreſſive motion, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it had; but was no other than a parcel of cocoa-buſhes trailed upon the ground by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concealed beneath them. From this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common circumſtance, it was immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the Indians, whoſe boat they had ſurprized upon their firſt arrival, muſt be the perſons who were dragging the buſhes, and that it could not be far to the place of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment; they therefore kept their eye upon them, and traced them to their cell; but, to their ſurprize, when they came to enter it, they
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0204000302:400"/>
found it abandoned, though all things were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy prepared for dinner, and ſtood ſmoaking hot on a table of turf. The officers, having in vain endeavoured to track them, returned, and, with an appetite increaſed by the keenneſs of the purſuit, ſat down to that meal which the poor hungry ſavages had abandoned. It conſiſted of ſalted ſpareribs, cocoa-nuts, and bread fruit; all which they found ready dreſt, and in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity as much as they all could eat.</p>
                  <p>On the third day after the ſecond arrival of the ſhip, the Commodore being on board, a ſudden guſt of wind aroſe, and again brought home our anchor, and drove us out to ſea. Our chief officers were now all on board; and only about 70 of our men, with a midſhipman or two to command them, were employed on ſhore in filling water and catching cattle. Of theſe about 30 came off to us in the cutter, and the eighteen-oared barge was ſent for the reſt; but they not being in readineſs, and the ſhip quickly driving out of ſight, it was no longer in their power to join us. However, as the weather ſoon proved favourable, and we were now ſtronger and healthier than at our firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſter, in about five days we regained the road, and anchored ſafe in our former ſtation. On our return we found the Spaniſh bark reſtored to her old dimenſions, and the parts brought together, and in good forwardneſs to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated; for the few remaining people, deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the return of the ſhip, had determined
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0204000302:401"/>
to follow her to her deſtined port. We now laboured indefatigably to get in our water, in order to ſail, in which ſervice two of our men employed in the well unfortunately periſhed; for the ſides of the well being looſe earth, by the careleſſneſs of thoſe above, in not properly attending the filling, the bank gave way by the weight of a heavy caſk, and both that and the bank fell in upon them together. Some other misfortunes happened through haſte in rafting the caſks to the ſhip; yet, notwithſtanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as are generally accounted trifling on board a man of war, our watering went on ſo ſucceſsfully, that by the 20th of October it was compleated; and on that day leave was given for a man from each meſs to go aſhore, and gather as many oranges, lemons, cocoa-nuts, and other fruits of the iſland, as ſhould be ſufficient for us all while at ſea. This being accompliſhed, the Spaniſh bark ſet on fire, the men returned on board, and the boats hoiſted in, on the 21ſt we ſet ſail; and the wind being fair, and the weather mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, nothing remarkable happened till we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on the coaſts of China, except that while we were paſſing by the rocks of Vele Rete, near the ſouth end of the iſland Formoſa, we were alarmed by a cry of fire on the forecaſtle, which brought the whole crew together in the utmoſt confuſion, ſo that it was difficult for ſome time to reduce them to order; but, as ſoon as diſcipline took place, and a proper exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0204000302:402"/>
could be made, it was found to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the furnace, where the bricks, being over-heated, had begun to communicate the fire to the wood-work, which, had it not been timely diſcovered, might have been of the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequence; but, as it fell out, it was extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed with the greateſt facility, and the brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work ſo ſecured, that no accident of the like kind could again happen.</p>
                  <p>From the iſland of Formoſa we directed our courſe ſo as to fall in with the coaſt of China, to the eaſtward of Pedro Blanco, as that rock is generally eſteemed the beſt direction for ſhips bound to Mocao; and, on the 6th of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we fell in with it, when we were preſently ſurrounded by an incredible number of fiſhing-boats, which covered the ſurface of the ſea as far as the eye could reach. Nor was this ſwarm of fiſhing veſſels peculiar to that place; for, as we ran on to the weſtward, we found them as abundant on every other part of the coaſt. From among theſe we had no ſort of doubt of procuring a pilot to Mocao; but, when we thought ourſelves near it, though we tempted them with ſhewing them bags of Spaniſh dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, for which, it is ſaid, a Chineſe would ſell his father, yet not one of them would venture to come on board us, nor give us the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence; neither did our ſhip, the like of which, ſo armed and fitted, had never before appeared upon their coaſts, ſeem to excite in them any curioſity: they continued their fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0204000302:403"/>
with the ſame apparent indifference as if any trading ſhip had been paſſing by; and, when we made them ſignals, they diſregarded them as much, though they certainly underſtood them, as if we had been only in ſport. The next day, however, about two in the afternoon, as we were ſtanding to the weſtward within two leagues of the ſhore, ſtill ſurrounded as before, we obſerved that a boat a-head of us waved a red flag, and blew a horn. This we apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was a ſignal for us, and accordingly we hoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out our cutter, and ſent to know the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; when we preſently diſcovered our miſtake, and that it was only the uſual notice to leave off fiſhing, which the whole fleet inſtantly obeyed. Being thus diſappointed, we kept on our cruiſe till we came to a group of iſlands, round the weſternmoſt of which we were direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to paſs, and then to haul up. While we were thus employed, a Chineſe pilot came on board, and in broken Portugueſe undertook to pilot us into harbour for 30 dollars, and on the 12th of November anchored us ſafe in Mocao-road; where the firſt thing we did was to ſalute the fort, and to ſend to the Portugueſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to adviſe with his Excellency in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to behave to avoid giving offence to the Chineſe. The difficulty the Commodore prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally apprehended related to the port charges uſually paid by ſhips in the river Canton, from which charges men-of-war are exempted in every port of Europe, and which the Commodore was
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0204000302:404"/>
determined not to be forced to pay in this. In the evening the boat returned with two officers, who delivered it as the Governor's opinion, that, if the Centurion ventured into the river of Canton, the duty would moſt certainly be expected; and, therefore, if the Commodore approved of it, he would ſend a pilot to conduct the ſhip into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther harbour, called the Typa, where it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the port charges would never be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To this propoſal the Commodore agreed, the pilot was ſent, and the ſhip ſafely moored.</p>
                  <p>Next day the Commodore paid a viſit in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the Governor, to ſolicit a ſupply of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and of naval ſtores to refit the ſhip. The Governor very frankly acquainted the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, that he durſt not openly furniſh either the one or the other; for that he himſelf nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther received proviſions for his garriſon but from day to day, by permiſſion from the Chineſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, nor any thing elſe but what his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſities required: however, he aſſured the Commodore in a friendly manner, that he would give him all the aſſiſtance in his power. On this declaration, the Commodore determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go to Canton himſelf, to procure a licence from the Viceroy to purchaſe a ſupply, and, with this view, hired a Chineſe boat for himſelf and his attendants to carry them into port: but juſt as they were ready to embark, the Hoppo refuſed to grant them a permit; nor would he, notwithſtanding all the intereſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore could make, withdraw the prohibition,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0204000302:405"/>
till he was threatened to be compelled to it by force. This operated when fair means had fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; a permit was next day ſent on board, and the Commodore proceeded to the Engliſh fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, to conſult with the principal officers there about the cautions that were to be uſed, leſt the factory ſhould ſuffer by violent meaſures, which he was ſolicitous to avoid. They adviſed him to tranſact the buſineſs by the mediation of the Chineſe merchants, who at firſt undertook to accompliſh it; but, after trifling with him more than a month, they declared they durſt not interfere in it. The merchants then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to procure him proviſions clandeſtinely; but that would not ſuffice. Upon his return, he found the ſhip ſo much out of repair, that ſhe could not proceed without being hove down; he, therefore, next day wrote a letter to the Viceroy, acquainting him, that he was Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore of a ſquadron of his Britannic Majeſty's ſhips that had been cruiſing in the South Seas againſt the Spaniards, who were at war with his nation; that his ſhip was leaky; that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were in want of proviſions; that he had put into Mocao, a friendly port, for a ſupply, but that, being a ſtranger to the cuſtoms of the country, he had been unable to ſucceed; and, therefore, requeſted, that he might be permitted to employ workmen to repair his ſhip, and that he might be ſupplied with proviſions at the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed rates at which the articles he ſtood in need of were generally ſold. Another difficulty
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0204000302:406"/>
was now ſtarted as to the delivery of this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Hoppo at firſt refuſing to intermeddle with it; but, on the Commodore's expreſſing ſome reſentment, and threatening to convey it to Canton by his own meſſengers, he at length undertook not only to deliver it, but to procure an anſwer: accordingly, though the letter was only dated on the 17th of December, on the 19th a Mandarine of the firſt rank, together with two others of an inferior claſs, and their attendants, having in their retinue 18 half gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, decorated with ſtreamers, and furniſhed with bands of muſic, came to a grapple a-head of the Centurion, whence the Mandarine ſent in form to acquaint the Commodore, that he came by order of the Viceroy to examine the condition of the ſhip, and to report the ſame as it ſhould appear to him upon a juſt ſurvey. On this meſſage, preparations were inſtantly made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; in particular, a hundred of the moſt ſightly men on board, uniformly dreſſed in the regimentals of the marines, were drawn up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der arms on the main-deck againſt his arrival. When he entered the ſhip, he was ſaluted by the drums and military muſic, and conducted by ſome of the principal officers to the quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck, where he was received in ſtate by the Commodore, and then introduced to the great cabbin, where he explained his commiſſion, and preſented the perſons he had brought with him to take the ſurvey. The Mandarine appeared to be a perſon of ſuperior abilities, and endowed
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0204000302:407"/>
with a frankneſs and honeſty not uſually to be met with among the ordinary ranks of Chineſe officers; and, being an eye-witneſs of the dangerous ſtate of the leaks, and of the neceſſity there was for a thorough repair, he expreſſed his entire acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence in the report that had been given, and promiſed to lay the ſame immediately before the council upon his return. He was exceeding curious in inſpecting the ſhip, in examining her guns, and poiſing her great ſhot. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt his aſtoniſhment at her ſtrength and her magnitude; and the Commodore, to increaſe his wonder, and ſhew his own power, let him know how eaſy it would be for him to deſtroy the whole navigable force of China, and lay the city of Canton in ruins; but, nevertheleſs, he aſſured him, that not the leaſt violence ſhould be offered, provided his wants were ſupplied upon reaſonable terms.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time the Commodore complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the behaviour of the officers at Mocao, who had prohibited the country people from ſelling proviſions to his company, though they had paid for what they purchaſed in ſterling ſilver. The Mandarine heard the complaint without emotion, but ſaid it ſhould be remedied for the future. After the buſineſs was over, dinner was ordered, and the Commodore apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſed for the meanneſs of the fare from the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty he had to procure better: but the two inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Mandarines, who were the only perſons of their retinue permitted to ſit at table with them, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0204000302:408"/>
no diſlike to any thing ſet before them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the beef, to which they have the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like as the Jews have to pork, from an early prejudice derived from their anceſtors; of this the Commodore was not apprized, nor were they offended at its being ſet before them. They were, indeed, very aukward at the uſe of knives and forks, and it was found neceſſary to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their own ſervants to carve for them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could make an end of their dinners. But if they were deficient in their manner of eating, they were no novices in putting about the glaſſes; for there was not an officer at table that durſt engage with them. Seeing they were fond of Frontiniac, and that they preſently emptied four or five bottles of it without any effect, the Commodore ordered a bottle of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron water to be brought up, which, on taſting, they liked, and, the Commodore excuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on account of an illneſs he had not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, they clapped a ruddy-faced officer on the ſhoulder, and deſired him to pledge them, ſaying, by their interpreter, they were ſure he could not plead illneſs for declining his glaſs. When the bottle was out, they all roſe from table, without appearing to be in the leaſt diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and, after the uſual ceremonies, depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, very well pleaſed with their entertainment.</p>
                  <p>The Commodore now impatiently expected the licence he had requeſted; but it was ſeveral days before it paſſed the neceſſary forms, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owing to the intrigues of a Frenchman, who,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0204000302:409"/>
having the advantage of ſpeaking the language fluently, was at no loſs in traverſing the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the friendly Mandarine in favour of Mr. Anſon; but a repetition of the threats already referred to, produced, at laſt, the deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed effect. On the 6th of January, the licence was received, and the carpenters were ſet to work; but, previous to this, the prohibition was taken off, and proviſions were every day brought to the ſhip in plenty.</p>
                  <p>It was, however, the beginning of April be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the repairs could be compleated, and the Chineſe began to be very uneaſy at their long ſtay. They had frequently ſent meſſages to the Commodore to haſten his departure, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or believing that he was no leſs in earneſt to be gone, than they were to be freed from the dread of his ſtay. At length, on the 3d of April, two Mandarines came on board from Mocao, with a peremptory command addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Commodore, requiring him to depart; to which he made anſwer, in a determined tone, that he would go when he thought proper, and not when they preſumed to command him. After this rebuke, however, all communication was forbidden, and no more proviſions were ſuffered to go on board; and ſo ſtrictly were thoſe injunctions carried into execution, that from thenceforwards nothing could be purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at any rate whatever. On the 6th of April, the Centurion weighed, and warped to the ſouthward; and, by the 15th, ſhe was ſafe in
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0204000302:410"/>
Mocao road, having compleated her water as ſhe paſſed along. On the 19th, ſhe again weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anchor, and put to ſea.</p>
                  <p>But long before this, that is, ſome time in November, Captain Saunders, Commander of the Tryal's prize, took paſſage on board a Swediſh ſhip with diſpatches from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore to the government. And ſoon after, that is, about the middle of December, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mitchell, Col. Crackerode, Mr. Taſwell, with his nephew Mr. Charles Herriot, and the Rev. Mr. Walter, embarked on board the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's ſhips on their return home. About this time we received the firſt news of the ſafe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the Severn and Pearl (the two ſhips of our ſquadron that parted from us in doubling Cape Horn) at Rio Janeiro, on the coaſt of Brazil. The Severn had been remarkable for the extraordinary ſickneſs that had been more fatal on board her than on board of any other in the whole ſquadron, inſomuch that her hands had been twice recruited from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion during her voyage to the ſtraits of Le Maire; and yet when ſhe parted company ſhe wanted hands to navigate her in a ſtorm, which was the reaſon of her return. It was from the knowledge of this uncommon mortality that prevailed among the crew, that the Commodore concluded the Severn to be loſt. The news, therefore, of her and the Pearl's ſafety was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the greater pleaſure, as we had long
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0204000302:411"/>
entertained an opinion that both of them had periſhed. But to return from this digreſſion:</p>
                  <p>From the 1ſt to the 15th of April, we had ſtormy weather, with heavy rains and ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing and terrifying claps of thunder and flaſhes of lightning as nothing of the kind I had ever ſeen or heard bore any proportion to. This was upon the breaking-up of the eaſterly mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon, when ſuch ſtorms are uſual in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, accompanied ſometimes with dreadful guſts of wind, called here by the name of Tuffoons, of the effects of which the Chineſe relate very wonderful ſtories.</p>
                  <p>While we were warping out of the harbour, the Commodore went on ſhore to Mocao, to take leave of the Portugueſe Governor, who had, to the utmoſt of his power, behaved in a very friendly manner; and, at his coming from the fort, he was ſaluted with 15 guns.</p>
                  <p>During our ſtay we had entered about 20 freſh hands, being chiefly Laſcars, Perſians, and Dutchmen; ſo that our whole complement, when we ſailed, amounted to 224 men and boys, among whom were ſome of all nations, languages, and religions.</p>
                  <p>Being now at ſea, we were ſome time in a ſtate of uncertainty what courſe the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore intended to ſteer. He gave out at Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cao, that he was bound to Batavia, and thence to England; but his real deſign was very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. The project the Commodore had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon in his own mind, was, to cruiſe
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0204000302:412"/>
for the annual ſhip from Acapulco to Manilla; and, not diſcouraged by his former diſaſters, he determined again to riſque the caſualties of the Pacific Ocean, and to take his ſtation off Cape Spirito Santo on the iſland of Jamal, being the firſt land the Acapulco ſhips always make in approaching the Philippines.</p>
                  <p>Being now at ſea, it was no longer neceſſary to conceal this project; he, therefore, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned all his people on the quarter-deck, and in a ſhort, but ſpirited ſpeech, informed them of his deſign; which was received by them with the moſt expreſſive tokens of general approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and ſuch a confidence of ſucceeding dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed itſelf through all the ſhip's company, that the Commodore, who had taken ſome Chineſe ſheep to ſea with him for his own proviſion, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring one day of his butcher, why he had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen no mutton at his table? the man replied dryly, that in truth there were only two ſheep left, and theſe, with his honour's leave, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to reſerve for the entertainment of the General of the galleons.</p>
                  <p>When the Centurion left the port of Mocao, ſhe ſtood for ſome days to the weſtward; and, on the firſt of May, paſſed the iſland of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſa; and, ſteering to the ſouthward, on the 4th in the evening they came in ſight of the Baſhee Iſlands, which they ſuſpected to be wrong laid down by Dampier, and from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation found them 25 leagues too far to the weſtward. On the 20th of May, they came in
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0204000302:413"/>
ſight of Eſpirito Santo. As it was known there were centinels placed upon the Cape to make ſignals to the Acapulco ſhips, the Commodore immediately tacked, and ordered the top-gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant-ſails to be taken in, to prevent a diſcovery: and this being the ſtation in which he propoſed to cruiſe, he fixed the limits between the latitude of 12 deg. 50 min. N. and 13 deg. 5 min. the Cape itſelf lying in 12 deg. 40 min. N. and in 4 deg. of eaſt longitude from Pſotel Tobago Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. It was now the time when the Manilla ſhip was every hour expected; for they ſeldom or never fail of making land in the month of June, and ſometimes ſooner, and it was now the laſt day of May, according to their ſtile, when the Commodore took his ſtation.</p>
                  <p>It were tedious to entertain the reader with the various conjectures, ſurmiſes, doubts, and anxieties, that agitated the minds of the people on board, from the day they came in ſight of the Cape till the day that Mr. Charles Proby, a midſhipman, called out from the maſt-head, <hi>A ſail!</hi> This was on the 20th of June, juſt one month after their arrival at the Cape. There did not remain a doubt but that it was one of the galleons (for two were expected this year, as none had been permitted to ſail the year pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding); and the Commodore accordingly ſtood towards her. At half after ſeven in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they could ſee her from the deck, at which time ſhe fired a gun to leeward, and took in her top-gallant-ſails, as a ſignal, as it was then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0204000302:414"/>
to her conſort; but in reality, as a ſignal to her own people to prepare for action. The Commodore was ſurprized to ſee her ſteadily purſue her courſe, and was now in no fear of loſing ſight of her, as at noon he could fetch her wake. Her conſort not appearing, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded they had parted company; and it now became viſible, that the galleon did not intend to fly, but to fight. Every preparation had been previouſly made on board the Centurion, and all hands properly inſtructed; ſo that every man on board repaired to his poſt with as much regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and unconcern as if preparing for a review. Thirty of the beſt markſmen lined the tops; two men placed themſelves at a gun to load them; and gangs of ten men each were appointed to go from gun to gun, to run them out, and fire them as faſt as they were loaded. A conſtant running fire was by this means kept up, and no interval allowed for the enemy to ſtand to their guns in ſafety, as is common when whole broadſides are diſcharged at once.</p>
                  <p>About one in the afternoon, the galleon haul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up her fore-ſail, and brought to under top-ſails, with her head to the northward, hoiſting Spaniſh colours, and having the ſtandard of Spain flying at the top-gallant-maſt-head. About the ſame time the Centurion hoiſted her broad pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and colours, being within gun-ſhot of the enemy; and the Commodore, ſeeing them clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their decks of their cattle and lumber, gave orders to fire the chace-guns, to diſturb them in
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0204000302:415"/>
their work. The galleon returned the fire with two of her ſtern-guns, one of which carried away one of our fore-ſhrouds, and our foreſtay tackle, which could not have been done by an ordinary ball. The Centurion ſetting her ſprit-ſail fore-and aft for boarding, the galleon, out of a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado, did the ſame. Soon after, the Centurion ſhot a-breaſt of the enemy within piſtol-ſhot, and now the engagement became hot. For the firſt half hour the Centurion over-reached the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon, and lay on her bow, and, by the wideneſs of her ports, could traverſe almoſt all her guns upon the enemy, whilſt the galleon could only bring a part of her's to bear upon the Centurion in return. In the heat of the action, the mats with which the galleon had ſtuffed her netting took fire, and burnt violently, blazing up near as high as the mizzen-top. This accident threw the enemy into the utmoſt terror, and alſo alarmed the Commodore, for fear the galleon ſhould be burnt, and for fear he himſelf might ſuffer by being cloſely grappled by her. Happily, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that danger was averted, and the fire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, by cutting away the netting, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the whole tumble into the ſea. All this while the Commodore kept his firſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous poſition, firing with great regularity and briſkneſs; while at the ſame time the galleon's decks lay open to our top-men, who, having at their firſt volley driven the Spaniards from their tops, made prodigious havock with their ſmall arms, killing or wounding every officer but one
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0204000302:416"/>
that appeared upon the quarter-deck, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in particular the General of the galleon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Thus the action continued for more than half an hour; but then the Centurion loſt the ſuperiority of her ſituation, and came cloſe along<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the galleon, when the enemy continued their fire with great activity for near an hour longer; yet, even in this poſition, the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore's grape-ſhot ſwept their decks ſo effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the number of the dead and wounded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo conſiderable, that they began to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great confuſion, eſpecially as the General, who was the life of the action, was no longer able to exert himſelf. The diſorder was ſo great, that their officers were ſeen from the Centurion run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about to prevent the deſertion of their men from their poſts: but all their endeavours were in vain; for, after having, as a laſt effort, fired five or ſix guns with more judgment than uſual, they yielded up the conteſt; and, the galleon's colours being ſinged off the enſign-ſtaff at the beginning of the engagement, ſhe ſtruck the ſtandard at the main top-gallant-maſt-head; but even this office would have been at the peril of the man's life, had not the Commodore, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he was about, given expreſs orders to leave off firing.</p>
                  <p>The Commodore, when the action was ended, reſolved to make the beſt of his way with his prize to the river Canton, being in the mean time fully employed in ſecuring his priſoners, and in removing the treaſure from on board the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0204000302:417"/>
galleon into the Centurion. His firſt buſineſs was to commiſſion the ſhip, and put her under the command of proper officers: Lieut. Saumarez was appointed Captain, and was immediately or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered on board to take poſſeſſion of his charge.</p>
                  <p>But, juſt as the galleon had ſtruck, the officer who commanded between decks cam cup, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to congratulate the Commodore on his conqueſt, but at the ſame time privately whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, that the Centurion was dangerouſly on fire near the powder-room. It ſeems one of the lads, called powder-monkies, being heedleſs, a cartridge that he was carrying blew up in his hands; this fired another, and that three of the lower-deck guns on the off ſide of the ſhip, which being happily loaded and laid down for ſervice, and the ports hauled up to vent the ſmoke, they did not occaſion the leaſt miſchief; however, the cartridges and guns together raiſed ſuch a ſmother, that it was at firſt doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it proceeded from the exploſion, or from a part of the ſhip being on fire. In fact, upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, it was found to proceed from both; for, part of a cartridge having fallen between the planks of the cieling, cloſe aft by the ſcuttle of the Chaplain's cabbin, not only a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſmoke iſſued out, but a very ſenſible heat, and, had it not been immediately extinguiſhed, the conſequence would have been dreadful: to be brief, a few pails of water ſeaſonably applied did more than all the water of the ocean could had effected after an hour's delay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="407" facs="tcp:0204000302:418"/>This alarm being thus happily ſubſided, we draughted out 50 of our people (of whom my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was one) to board and man the prize. I had heard we had killed them 60 men, and wounded as many more, and expected to have ſeen the horrid ſpectacle of mangled limbs, dead carcaſſes, and decks covered with blood; but no ſuch ſpectacle appeared; a party having been properly ſtationed, during the time of action, to waſh away the blood, and to throw the dead over-board. We found, however, many deſperately wounded, and among them the General, who had received a muſket-ball in his breaſt, and was ſo ill, or pretended to be ſo ill, that it was judged unſafe to move him from him cabbin; but all the other officers, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the paſſengers of note, were ſent on board the Centurion. Among the latter was an old gentleman, Governor of Guam, who was going to Manilla to renew his commiſſion, and who had ſcarce mounted the Centurion's ſide before he was received with open arms by Mr. Crooden, Captain of marines, who 36 years before, at the battle of Almanza, had been his priſoner, and honourably uſed by him. Theſe two renewed their old acquaintance, and Captain Crooden had a long-wiſhed for opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of returning the favours he had formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and which he gratefully remembered.</p>
                  <p>The ſhip, upon examination, was found to contain to the value of more than a million and
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0204000302:419"/>
a half of dollars, was called the Nueſtra Signora de Cabadonga, Don Jeronimo de Montero Commander, by nation a Portugueſe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the moſt intrepid officer employed in the Spaniſh mercantile ſervice: and, indeed, in my opinion, he was more brave than prudent; for, ſurely, no wiſe man, intruſted with ſuch a cargo, ſix leagues to the windward of a man-of-war purpoſely ſtationed to intercept him, would have borne down upon his enemy, and braved him to his teeth, when, with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the wind, he might have gone ſafe to port, from whence he was not more than 10 or 12 leagues diſtant, and where he might then have ſet his purſuer at defiance.</p>
                  <p>His galleon was indeed larger than the man-of-war, was pierced for 64 guns, but had only 36 mounted, moſt of them 12 pounders, and 17 of them braſs: ſhe had, beſides, 28 petera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, in her gunwale, quarters, and tops, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying each a 4 lb. ball; and, before the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe muſtered 640 men capable of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arms, officers and paſſengers included. She was, beſides, well furniſhed with ſmall arms, and was particularly provided againſt boarding, both by her cloſe quarters, and by a ſtrong net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of two-inch rope laced over her waſte, and fortified with half-pikes placed in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of cheveaux de frize; but, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all her defences, ſhe had 64 men killed, and 84 wounded, whilſt the Centurion had only two men killed, and a Lieutenant and 16 men
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0204000302:420"/>
wounded, all of whom recovered, one man only excepted.</p>
                  <p>And now the Commodore learnt from ſome of the priſoners, that the other ſhip, which he had kept in the port of Acapulco the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, inſtead of returning in company with this, as was expected, had ſailed earlier in the ſeaſon than uſual, and was probably got into Manilla before the Centurion ſet ſail from Mocao; ſo that, notwithſtanding our preſent ſucceſs, we had reaſon to regret the loſs of time occaſioned by the delays of the Chineſe, which prevented our taking two rich prizes inſtead of one; though, to ſay the truth, it would not have been an eaſy taſk to diſpoſe of the priſoners, which, even as it fell out, was a matter that gave the Commodore no ſmall diſquietude; for they were above double the number of our own people; and ſome of them obſerved, when they were brought aboard, how ſlenderly we were manned; and the General himſelf could not help expreſſing his indignation to be thus beaten by a handful of boys. It was therefore neceſſary for our own preſervation to prevent their riſing; and that could not be ſecurely ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected without exerciſing a degree of ſeverity, which in any other circumſtances could not have been juſtified on the principles of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for there was no method practicable but that of ſtowing the men in the holds of the two ſhips; and as for the officers, 17 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they were confined in the Firſt Lieutenant's
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0204000302:421"/>
cabbin, under a guard of ſix men, firſt depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of their arms, and then keeping a ſtrict watch on all their motions. Indeed, the ſufferings of the common men, ſuch of them in particular who were not employed in navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the ſhip, were much to be pitied; for, the weather being extremely hot, the ſtench of the holds loathſome beyond conception, and their allowance of water but juſt ſufficient to keep them alive, being only a pint a day for each man, it was next to a miracle that not a man of them died during their confinement, except five of the wounded, who expired the very night they were brought aboard the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion. Thus circumſtanced, the motives of humanity, as well as intereſt, ſtrongly urged the Commodore to haſten his return to China; and the prize being much damaged, both in her hull and rigging, it was found neceſſary to take her in tow for the quicker diſpatch.</p>
                  <p>On the 21ſt of June it blew a ſtorm, which continued till the 25th, when the ſea ran moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains high: in this ſtorm the Centurion loſt her long-boat, and the prize a launch.</p>
                  <p>On the 2d of July we paſſed between the Baſhee Iſlands, though the rippling of the ſea ſeemed to indicate breakers or rocky ground; but the wind being ſo far to the northward as to render it difficult to weather them, we riſqued the danger to ſhorten the voyage. On the 8th of July we made the coaſt of China, and on the 11th came to an anchor off the city of
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0204000302:422"/>
Mocao; from thence we proceeded to the river of Canton, where we met with the uſual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from the cuſtom-houſe officers, and where the Commodore was again obliged, as it were, reſolutely to force his way to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſtation. The officer who came to take the dimenſions of his ſhips, in the uſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſeemed aſtoniſhed when he talked of being exempted from the accuſtomed rates, and gave him to underſtand that the emperor's duty muſt be paid by every ſhip that came into his ports; and the pilot had private inſtructions not to carry the ſhips through the Bocca Tygris, or narrow paſs that forms the entrance into the river of Canton, till ſecurity was given for the accuſtomed charges.</p>
                  <p>And here it may be neceſſary juſt to mention, that this paſs, not more than a quarter of a mile in breadth, is defended by two forts on the oppoſite ſides; but theſe the Commodore diſregarding, and being determined to enter the river without delay, as the ſtormy ſeaſon was approaching, he cauſed the pilot to be brought before him, and in a determined tone threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hang him to the yard arm, if he did not inſtantly take charge of the ſhip, and carry her ſafe, without ſtriking ground, through the Bocca Tygris into the open river. The poor pilot performed his office, but did not eſcape puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for what he could not help. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſeized on being releaſed from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, committed to priſon, and rigorouſly
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:0204000302:423"/>
diſciplined with the bamboo. However, he found means to get acceſs to the Commodore afterwards, to ſupplicate a recompence, who, ever ready to reward the ſufferers in his ſervice, gave him ſuch a ſum as more than contented him for his whipping. Nor was the poor pilot the only ſufferer; for the Governors of the forts were both diſplaced for not preventing what it was in vain for them to attempt to oppoſe, and for not doing what all the council muſt know was impoſſible to be done.</p>
                  <p>On the 16th, the Commodore ſent his Second Lieutenant to Canton, with a letter to the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, aſſigning his reaſons for putting into that port, demanding a licence for purchaſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and ſtores, and intimating an intention of waiting upon his Excellency in perſon to make his acknowledgements. The Lieutenant was civilly received, and promiſed an anſwer the next day. In the mean time, the principal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the prize deſired permiſſion to go to Canton on their parole, which was readily granted. Theſe no ſooner arrived, than they were called before the magiſtracy, and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when they generouſly and frankly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that they fell into the hands of the Commodore by the chance of war, and that though they were priſoners, they were notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at liberty to treat for their releaſe: they ſaid farther, that it was not the cuſtom among European nations to put priſoners to death; but that the laws of war authorized
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0204000302:424"/>
much ſeverer treatment than they had hitherto met with from their conquerors. This confeſſion from an enemy had great weight with the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe, who, till then, though they had revered the Commodore's naval force, had yet ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his morals, and had conſidered him rather as a lawleſs free-booter, than as one commiſſioned by the ſtate for the revenge of public injuries.</p>
                  <p>On the 20th of July, three Mandarines with their retinue came on board, and brought the Viceroy's permit for a daily ſupply of proviſions, and for pilots to carry the ſhips up the river as high as the ſecond bar; and, at the ſame time, they delivered a meſſage from the Viceroy, in anſwer to that part of the Commodore's letter which related to his viſiting his Excellency; the ſubſtance of which meſſage was, that the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy wiſhed the Commodore to defer his viſit till the hot ſeaſon was over, but that, in September, when the weather would be more temperate, he ſhould be glad to receive him. This the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore looked upon as a fineſſe, knowing an expreſs was ſent up to the Emperor's court at Peking; whence the real motive for putting off the viſit ſeemed to be to gain time to receive the Emperor's inſtructions concerning the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to be obſerved at his reception. The Mandarines, having diſpatched this part of their commiſſion, next entered upon the buſineſs of the port charges; whereupon the Commodore at once cut them ſhort, by telling them, that,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0204000302:425"/>
as he did not come to trade, he was not to be treated upon the ſame footing with trading ſhips; that his Britannic Majeſty's ſhips never paid cuſtoms in the ports of Europe, nor ever would be ſubject to any pecuniary impoſts in any other port whatever. Finding nothing to be gained on this head, they told the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, that they had ſtill another matter in charge, and that was the releaſe of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers taken on board the galleon; for that the Emperor would never permit the ſubjects of princes with whom he was in alliance to be held in bondage in his dominions, nor could the Viceroy anſwer it to his Sovereign, if he ſuffered it; and that, therefore, his Excellency hoped that the Commodore would give immediate orders for their releaſe.</p>
                  <p>Though nothing could be more agreeable to the Commodore, who wanted much to be rid of the incumbrance, than this requiſition, yet, to inhance the favour, he at firſt raiſed difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but at length ſuffered himſelf to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon by their intreaties, and concluded, by aſſuring them, that, to ſhew his readineſs to oblige, he would deliver up the priſoners when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Viceroy would pleaſe to order boats to fetch them. Matters being thus adjuſted, the Mandarines departed: and, in a few days, two Chineſe junks were ſent from Canton to carry them to Mocao, under the direction of one Captain Fial, Commander of a Spaniſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-man, to whoſe ſhip we gave chace in our
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:0204000302:426"/>
paſſage from the Baſhee Iſlands to Mocao, but loſt ſight of her in the night.</p>
                  <p>To this gentleman the General of the galleon, and all his officers, except one who accompanied us to England, were delivered up. And now I have occaſion to mention the General, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help relating an affair which gave us on board the prize a great deal of concern, and ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed the meanneſs of his ſpirit, and his beggarly craft. I have already taken notice of his being wounded in the engagement, and of his being indulged with the uſe of his own cabbin till he was fit to be removed. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore, over and above this indulgence, ſent him a ſurgeon from his own ſhip, upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint that the Spaniſh ſurgeon on board the galleon was quite ignorant in his profeſſion; but at the ſame time he ſent an officer to demand his commiſſion. Pretending to the officer that he was unable to move, he referred him to a ſmall box in a locker of his private cabbin, in which, he ſaid, it was, and likewiſe a ſword-belt ſet with diamonds of great value, his own property; but, upon ſearch, neither the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion nor the belt could be found: and, as ſome of our people had been rummaging both that and other parts of the ſhip, he proteſted, that, if they could not be there found, they muſt have been taken away and concealed. Under colour of this concealment, though he never produced his commiſſion, he all along re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the moſt humane and gentlemanlike
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:0204000302:427"/>
treatment that the moſt worthy officer could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire or expect; and ſuch was continued till his departure, when neither his cheſts, of which he had two very large ones, nor any of his trunks or caſes were ſuffered to be ſearched: but every thing which he claimed as his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal effects were delivered to him with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt care and punctuality; though, as I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards informed, he had many valuable ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures concealed, which ought to have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up as prize to the captors; but, as that was never examined into, he carried them off with the reſt, and, it was ſuppoſed, was not the leaſt among the gainers by the capture of his ſhip. He perſiſted, however, to the laſt in the loſs of his commiſſion and belt, and, though there were none on board on whom he could charge the theft, yet the Commodore ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his diſpleaſure againſt the whole by the prohibition he laid upon us, as ſoon as the prize came to an anchor in the river, by which all communication was cut off between us and the country people, and no boat ſuffered to come near us but our own; by which ſevere order we were entirely debarred from purchaſing our own proviſions and neceſſaries from the Chineſe, which the people in the Centurion were at full liberty to do; neither could we employ the Chineſe tradeſmen to ſupply us with apparel, of which we ſtood greatly in need, though in that too the Centurion's people were indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and all this for no other reaſon, that was
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:0204000302:428"/>
ever aſſigned, but that, if the jewels the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral had loſt were concealed, the Commodore was determined the ſecreter ſhould have no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of diſpoſing of them without being diſcovered. Had this precaution been taken, as it ought, for the ſatisfaction of thoſe who ſuffered under the ſeverity of the cenſure, and had the effects of the Spaniſh General been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly inſpected, the ſecreter would have been publicly expoſed; for, when we afterwards fell down to Mocao with the ſhips, where we ſold the prize, I was myſelf told by an Iriſh prieſt, that the General had both his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and his belt; that he made no ſecret of the matter at Mocao; and that he had offered the jewels (being only made up by way of blind) among the merchants for ſale.</p>
                  <p>But to return: during our ſtay in the river Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, our people were employed in repairing the Centurion, over-hauling her ſails and rigging, cleanſing and ventilating her decks and quarters below, and in paying and decorating her hull; inſomuch, that when ſhe came to ſail, ſhe had more the appearance of a ſhip newly fitted out, than one that had been a three-year's voyage in traverſing the globe. While theſe things were doing on board the Centurion, we in the prize were buſied in rummaging for treaſure, till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the latter end of Auguſt, when we made a full end of our ſearch, and found, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the captors, in ſpecie, 1,278,546 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and 1,324 of wrought plate and virgin
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:0204000302:429"/>
ſilver. The jewels we found were not then valued.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time that the inferior officers and ſeamen were employed in theſe different ſervices, the Commodore had a ſtill more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant buſineſs in hand. He knew it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to proceed to Europe without an ample ſupply of proviſions and other ſea-ſtores; and, though we were furniſhed with a daily allowance, yet no order had been obtained for victualling us for our intended voyage. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication had indeed been made, and terms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon with the contractors to furniſh what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was neceſſary; and they had undertaken to procure the Viceroy's permiſſion for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery; but when, about the middle of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the proper officer was ſent to enquire what forwardneſs theſe things were in, he found that neither the baker had begun to bake the bread, nor the butcher to kill the oxen, nor was the leaſt ſtep taken to comply with any one article of the agreement. We could no otherwiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for this faithleſs procedure of the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe, than by ſuppoſing they meant to ſtarve us into a compliance with their accuſtomed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands for port charges, with which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore was determined never to acquieſce. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it was ſuſpected, that the contractors themſelves had ſome intereſt in promoting the delay, though it was not eaſy to penetrate the views by which they were influenced, as it may with truth be aſſerted, that in artifice, falſhood,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0204000302:430"/>
and attachment to all kinds of lucre, the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe, as a nation, are not to be paralleled by any other people under the ſun. It were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to recount all the artifices, extortions, and frauds, which were practiſed on the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore and his people by this intereſted race. The method of buying proviſions in China be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by weight, the tricks made uſe of to make them heavy are almoſt incredible. At one time a number of fowls and ducks being brought for the ſhip's ſtore, the greateſt part of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently died, which ſpread a general alarm on board leſt they ſhould have died of poiſon; but, on examination, it was diſcovered that they had been crammed with ſmall ſtones and gravel to increaſe their weight. The hogs, too, bought of the Chineſe butchers ready killed, were found to have had water injected into the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes for the ſame purpoſe; and when, to avoid this cheat, the hogs were bought alive, it was found that ſalt had been given them to increaſe their thirſt, that methods had been uſed to ſuppreſs their urine, and that the tortured ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals had been ſold in that inflated ſtate. Mr. Walter adds—[for it is on his authority that theſe inſtances are reported]—that, as the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe never ſcruple to eat the animals that die of themſelves, they contrived, by their ſecret prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, when the Commodore put to ſea, that part of his live ſea-ſtore ſhould die in a ſhort time after it was put on board: in order, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to make a ſecond profit of the dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:0204000302:431"/>
which they expected would be thrown over-board, they followed in boats to pick up the carrion; and, accordingly, two thirds of the hogs dying before they were out of ſight of land, their labour could not be in vain.</p>
                  <p>The treachery of the contractors being now diſcovered, the Commodore determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his former requiſition for an audience with the Viceroy. With this view, he notified his intention to the proper Mandarine, and deſired that he would fix the time with the Viceroy when he would be pleaſed to receive him; at the ſame time giving him to underſtand, that, on the firſt of October, he intended to proceed in his boat to Canton. The Mandarine return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for anſwer, that he would acquaint the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy with the Commodore's intentions. As it was apprehended, that the payment of the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary duties would be demanded at this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, the Commodore took the neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions to prevent the Chineſe from facilitating the ſucceſs of their pretenſions by having him in their power at Canton, and, therefore, gave the command of the Centurion to his Firſt Lieut. Mr. Brett (now Sir Piercy), with orders, if he ſhould be detained, to lie at the mouth of the river, and ſuffer no ſhip or boat to paſs or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs till he was releaſed, by which the whole navigation of the river would be immediately obſtructed.</p>
                  <p>This being known to the Chineſe, they were now more than ever embarraſſed in their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations.
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0204000302:432"/>
The morning of the firſt of October arrived, and juſt as the boat's crew, eighteen in number, which the Commodore propoſed to take with him, appeared in their uniform, namely, ſcarlet jackets and blue ſilk waiſtcoats, the whole trimmed with ſilver, with ſilver badges on their jackets and caps, his linguiſt came to him from the Mandarine, to tell him, that a letter had been received from the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, deſiring the Commodore to defer his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended purpoſe for two or three days, which not being doubted, the men were ordered to be undreſt, and the preparations were all laid aſide; but, in the afternoon of the ſame day, another linguiſt came on board, ſeemingly in a great panic, informing him, that the Viceroy had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected him up that day; that the council was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, and the troops under arms to receive him; and that the Viceroy was highly incenſed at the diſappointment, and had ſent the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore's linguiſt to priſon, chained, ſuppoſing him to be the ſole cauſe of the contempt. This plauſible tale gave the Commodore great uneaſineſs, not at that time ſuſpecting any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and though it afterwards appeared to be all a mere farce, yet the falſhood was ſo well ſupported by the artifices of the Chineſe merchants, that three days afterwards the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore received a letter, ſigned by all the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percargoes of the Engliſh ſhips then at the place, expreſſing their uneaſineſs at what had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and intimating their fears that ſome inſult
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:0204000302:433"/>
would be offered to his boat, if he attempted to come to Canton before the Viceroy was fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the miſtake. To this letter the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore replied, that he did not believe there had been a miſtake, but was perſuaded it was a forgery of the Chineſe to prevent his viſiting the Viceroy; that, therefore, he would certainly come up to Canton on the 13th of October, confident that the Chineſe would not dare to offer him any inſult, as well knowing he ſhould want neither power nor inclination to make them a proper return.</p>
                  <p>On the 13th of October, the Commodore continuing firm to his reſolutions, all the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cargoes of the Engliſh, Daniſh, and Swediſh ſhips, came on board the Centurion, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him to Canton, for which place he ſet out in his barge the ſame day, attended by his own boats, and by thoſe of the trading ſhips, which on this occaſion were ſent to augment his reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. As he paſſed by Wampo where the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean veſſels by, he was ſaluted by all of them except the French, and in the evening he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſafely at Canton.</p>
                  <p>The Chineſe merchants, who affected to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very much pleaſed that he had met with no oppoſition in his way, pretended that the Viceroy was then ſo fully employed in preparing his diſpatches for Peking, that there was no get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting admittance to him; but that they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged one of the officers of his court, as ſoon as he was at leiſure, to notify the Commodore's
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:0204000302:434"/>
arrival, and endeavour to fix the audience. Though the Commodore knew this to be a falſehood, yet he ſuffered himſelf to be perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the European Supercargoes not to appear to doubt it, provided the Chineſe merchants would undertake that his bread ſhould be bak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his meat ſalted, and his ſtores in readineſs, within the ſpace of 40 days; after which time, if the leaſt article was pretended to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, he would force his way to the Viceroy, and prefer his complaint. During the interval, while the contractors were endeavouring in earneſt to fulfil the terms of the agreement on their part, (which by the way they inſiſted ſhould be paid for in advance on his), a fire broke out in the ſuburbs of Canton, which on the firſt alarm might eaſily have been extinguiſhed, by pulling down ſome of the adjoining ſheds; which the Commodore with his officers and crew obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were inſtantly about to carry into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but they were told, that whatever they pulled down they muſt build up again at their own expence, and that none but a Mandarine muſt preſume to direct upon ſuch occaſions. The Commodore, on this admonition, diſpatched his people to the Engliſh factory to aſſiſt them in ſecuring their effects, as it was eaſy to foreſee that no diſtance was ſafe from fire, where the common people contented themſelves with gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at it, and now-and-then holding up an idol or two to extinguiſh it. At length, however, a Mandarine came out of the city, with 4 or 500
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:0204000302:435"/>
firemen, who made ſome very feeble efforts to pull down the neighbouring houſes; but by this time the fire had extended itſelf, and had ſpread among the merchants warehouſes, where the Chineſe firemen had neither ſpirit nor ſkill to encounter it; ſo that it was feared the whole city would have been laid in aſhes. In this emergency, the Viceroy vouchſafed to make his appearance, and a meſſage was ſent to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore, requeſting his aſſiſtance. Accordingly, he haſtened a ſecond time, with about 40 of his people, to the place where the fire raged with the moſt violence, and in ſight of the whole city performed ſuch daring, and, to the people who beheld them, ſuch aſtoniſhing feats, that they looked upon them as ſalamanders, and cried out, that they could live in fire. In truth, it was no uncommon thing to ſee the boldeſt and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive among them tumble on the roofs amidſt the ruins of the houſes which their own efforts had brought down under them. And thus, by their reſolution and agility, the fire was very ſoon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, to the aſtoniſhment of the Chineſe who were ſpectators of the wonders they performed. On this occaſion the Swediſh was the only Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean factory that ſuffered; yet on my arrival in England, to my no ſmall diverſion, I read in the Paris Gazette, that the city of Canton had been almoſt wholly deſtroyed; and that, in particular, the Engliſh, Dutch, Daniſh, and Portugueſe factories, had been burnt down, and almoſt all their effects conſumed; but that the French
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:0204000302:436"/>
factory had providentially eſcaped, their goods being all ſhipped before the conflagration reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the quarter allotted for their reſidence.</p>
                  <p>This ſignal aſſiſtance gained the Admiral much reſpect, he was the next day waited <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

Being highly pleaſed with this laſt intimation, he inſtantly gave orders for the neceſſary preparations; and engaged Mr. Flint, a gentleman belonging to the Engliſh factory, for his interpreter, who, being trained up from his infancy among the Chineſe, ſpoke their language fluently, and who was not afraid to declare with boldneſs what the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

Thus happily concluded this long-expected audience; and, in purſuance of the Viceroy's promiſes, the proviſions were begun to be ſhipped the very next day: and now all the preparations for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſea were purſued with ſo much expedition, that by the 9th the Centurion and her prize were ready to unmoor, and on the 10th paſſed through the Bocca Tygris into the open road, and on the 12th anchored before the town of Mocao. While they lay here, the Portugueſe merchants entered into treaty with the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore for the purchaſe of the prize, for which they would give no more than 6000 dollars, though worth double that ſum; but the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the Commodore to be gone, that he might himſelf be the meſſenger of his own good fortune, and thereby prevent the enterprizes of the enemy to intercept him, prevailed upon him to conclude the bargain; and, ſhe being deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the 15th of December, and the money received, in the afternoon of the ſame day he hoiſted ſail, and took his departure for his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive home. On the 3d of January he came to an anchor on Prince's Iſland, in the ſtraits of Sunda, where he ſtaid the beſt part of five days to wood and water, and on the 8th weighed and continued his courſe. From this time till
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:0204000302:439"/>
the 20th we had foul and ſtormy weather, ſo bad, that I thought it impoſſible to meet with ſuch in latitudes ſo near the Equator; and the wind blowing directly againſt us, we were driven pretty near the coaſt of New Holland; and, had it continued blowing from the ſame quarter, with equal violence, for 48 hours longer, we ſhould have found it difficult to have cleared that coaſt; but, on the 21ſt, the wind abated, and the weather became moderate. On the 24th, the trade-wind ſet in, and we then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on our paſſage with the higheſt alacrity.</p>
                  <p>On the 22d of February, at half after four in the morning, I diſcovered a comet to the eaſtward, near the horizon, being, as I judged, lately emerged from the ſun's rays. Its tail was at this time about 10 degrees in length; but in leſs than a fortnight it increaſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended itſelf to near 40 degrees. Its head ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very large and bright; and, on a nice inſpection, I have perceived it when the ſun has been about a diameter above the horizon. The next time I obſerved its diſtance from the planet Venus to be 26 deg. 50 min. following the order of the planets; but not having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments proper for taking altitudes without a very obvious ſenſible horizon, I was prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from making more ſatisfactory obſervations. From this time, till the 6th of March, we had pleaſant weather, with few exceptions; but on that and the three following days, being near the Cape of Good Hope, we had ſome boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:0204000302:440"/>
ſtorms; yet, when we arrived at Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay, on the 11th, the Dutch knew not that any ſuch had happened. We found riding here two Engliſh Eaſt-Indiamen, the Saliſbury and Warwick, each of which ſaluted us with 13 guns, and we returned 11. We alſo found five Dutch ſhips, one of which having, as Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, a flag at his main-top-maſt-head, ſaluted us with 9 guns, to which we returned 7. At 11 at night we parted our beſt bower cable and hawſer, both of which were very rotten, and the next day moored again with others pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed from the Dutch. Here the Commodore continued till the beginning of April, highly delighted with the place, and during his ſtay entered about 40 new men. On the 3d of May, having compleated our water and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, we on that day weighed and put to ſea. On the 19th of April we paſſed within ſight of the iſland of St. Helena, which, however, we did not viſit. On the 26th we caught on board the ſhip a ſnake that meaſured in length ſix feet and two inches, which our ſurgeon, on examination, pronounced to be perfectly harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. It was ſuppoſed to be brought on board with our wood, at Prince's Iſland, in the ſtraits of Sunda. The 30th, being before the wind, with a fine breeze, and a gentle rain, a violent and ſudden ſquall took us a-head, threw all the ſhip's ſails a-back, carried away her fore-top-ſail yard, ſplit the fore-ſail, the fore-top-ſail, the fore-top-gallant-ſail, and the mizzen and
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:0204000302:441"/>
mizzen-top ſail. During this ſquall the ſhip laid down very much, and we were in the utmoſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of our maſts coming by the board; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially we eſcaped without further damage.</p>
                  <p>The 9th of June, in the evening, it being a thick fog, we on a ſudden ſaw a ſhip cloſe by us; we fired a ſhot, and brought her too. She proved an Engliſh ſhip from Amſterdam, bound for Philadelphia or Carolina, with Palatine emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants. She gave us the firſt notice of a war with France, and proceeded on her voyage. The 10th of June we came into ſoundings. The 11th, at half paſt eleven in the morning, we diſcovered three ſail, and at one in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon ſpoke with one of them, being a Dutch ſhip from Dublin. At the ſame time, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, being pretty near us, ſhewed Dutch co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. The third, who had been in chace of the others the whole day, perceiving we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſpeak with her, ſtood from us with all the ſail ſhe could crowd. We gave chace to her for about three hours, when, finding we did not gain upon her, we reſumed our former courſe. On the 12th, in the morning, the fog clearing up, we perceived the Lizard Point: but that the ſignal perils, which had ſo often threatened us, and from which we had been more than once providentially delivered, might be diſcoverable to the laſt, we were afterwards told, that there was a French fleet of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable force cruiſing in the chops of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:0204000302:442"/>
through the middle of which we had this night ſailed without being perceived.</p>
                  <p>On the 13th, between the Iſle of Portland and the Iſle of Wight, we ſaw a ſhip towing another which was diſabled in her maſts. This ſhip proved the Salamander privateer, with a French <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> corpſe, only to receive the dead man's allowance.</p>
            <p>In this dreadful ſituation, they were alarmed by the diſcovery of a conſpiracy among the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:0204000302:446"/>
on board the Aſia, to murder the Admiral, and all the ſhip's crew, originating from no other motive but that of appropriating the whole ſtock of proviſions to the conſpirators own proper uſe. But this plot was prevented, when juſt upon the point of execution, by means of the prieſt on board, who, having taken the confeſſion of one of the conſpirators as he lay at the point of death, purſued proper meaſures to defeat their bloody purpoſes, and to bring three of the ring-leaders to condign puniſhment.</p>
            <p>But, though this combination failed of its effect, there were other diſtreſſes that multiplied upon them, and which could not be prevented. Hunger and thirſt, the moſt dreadful of all other calamities, daily became more grievous; the ſhips grew continually more and more leaky, and the men leſs able to ſtand at the pumps; nothing was to be ſeen but deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in every countenance; nothing heard but lamentations and complaints, which were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered by the abſolute impoſſibility of reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Under the weight of theſe affecting circumſtances, the Aſia was near ſinking, when ſhe arrived at Monte Vedio with ſcarce half her crew alive. The Eſtevan, when ſhe anchored in the bay of Barragan, had in like manner loſt about the ſame number of her hands; but, what was ſtill worſe, and is almoſt incredible, the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peranza, out of a crew of 450 ſeamen which ſhe brought from Spain, had only 58 that reached the ſhore, and the whole regiment of ſoldiers, 60 men only excepted, periſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="436" facs="tcp:0204000302:447"/>Being now in want of all kinds of neceſſaries, maſts, yards, rigging, proviſions, and money, Pizarro diſpatched an expreſs over land to St. Jago, in Chili, to be from thence forwarded to the Viceroy of Peru, deſiring a remittance of 200,000 dollars; and what muſt aſtoniſh the reader is, that the Indian who was charged with this diſpatch, though in the depth of winter, when the Cordilleras are judged impaſſable by reaſon of the ſnow, was only 13 days in his journey from Buenos Ayres to St. Jago, places diſtant from each other 300 Spaniſh leagues. At the ſame time an advice-boat was ſent with a letter of credit to Rio Janeiro, to purchaſe what was wanting of the Portugueſe; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other of theſe diſpatches ſucceeded to the wiſh of the Spaniſh Admiral. The Viceroy, inſtead of 200,000 dollars, ſent him only 100,000; and the Portugueſe, inſtead of furniſhing him with maſts and yards, the principal articles of naval ſtores that he wanted, ſpared him only ſome pitch, tar, and cordage, with which he was obliged to be contented: but a more mortifying diſappointment he had ſtill to ſuffer; for a carpenter, whom, after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the money, he had truſted with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſum, and whom he had ſent up into the country of Puraguay to cut maſts, inſtead of proſecuting the buſineſs with which he was entruſted, married in the country, and ſettled out of his reach, refuſing to return.</p>
            <p>In this dilemma, the only thing that could
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:0204000302:448"/>
be done, was, to ſhift the maſts of the Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranza into the Aſia, and to fit up the Eſtevan with what ſpare maſts and yards they could muſter, and with theſe two ſhips to hazard a ſecond attempt to double Cape Horn, as it was now ſummer, and the weather leſs ſevere. But a certain fatality ſeemed to preſide over every part of this unfortunate expedition. The Eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, as ſhe was coming down the river Plate, ran on a ſhoal and beat off her rudder; and the Aſia, though ſhe proceeded alone with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate weather and a favourable gale, yet when ſhe came to the height of Cape Horn, and was tacking to change her courſe to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by ſome miſconduct in wearing the ſhip, rolled away her maſts, and was a ſecond time forced back to the river of Plate; from whence Pizarro undertook to croſs the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent by land, and with ſome difficulty accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed his deſign.</p>
            <p>By this time Don Mindinuetta, Captain of the Guipuſcoa, wrecked, as has been ſaid, on the coaſt of Brazil, arrived, with thoſe of his crew who eſcaped, at the place of general ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous; and, finding the Eſperanza without maſts, applied a ſecond time to the Portugueſe, by whoſe aſſiſtance he completed her repair, and, in 1742, doubled the Cape, and arrived in the South Seas, where he was met by Pizarro, who claimed the command of the Eſperanza, which Mindinuetta diſputing, an irreconcileable quarrel aroſe between the two Commanders,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0204000302:449"/>
which the Viceroy of Peru in vain endeavoured to reconcile. In 1745, they both returned over land to the coaſt of Brazil, where they found the Aſia ſtill in a ſhattered condition. This ſhip, however, they determined to carry to Europe, and, with this view, they fitted her up in the beſt manner they could; and, having manned her partly with Portugueſe, partly with Engliſh priſoners, and partly with Spaniards, together with ſome Indians whom they forced out of the country, they ſet ſail from Monte Vedio for Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope about the beginning of November; but they had not been long at ſea before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, eleven in number, formed a conſpiracy to deſtroy the Spaniards, and to regain their liberty, in which they had hopes of being joined by the Engliſh and Portugueſe, whom the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards uſed with great inſolence. At the head of this conſpiracy was their Chief Orellana; and one evening, about nine o'clock, he and his companions came all together on the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-deck, and drew towards the door of the great cabbin. The boatſwain immediately repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, and ordered them to be gone; on this Orellana ſpoke to his followers in his native language, when four of them drew off, two towards each gangway, and the Chief and the remaining ſix ſeemed to be ſlowly quitting the quarter-deck. When the detached Indians had taken poſſeſſion of the gang-way, Orellana placed his hands hollow to his mouth, and bellowed out the war-cry
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:0204000302:450"/>
uſed by thoſe ſavages. This was the ſignal for beginning the maſſacre; accordingly, the ſix, with their Chief, who remained on the quarter-deck, falling ſuddenly on the Spaniards who were intermingled with them, laid near forty of them at their feet, of which above twenty were killed on the ſpot, and the reſt diſabled. Many of the officers, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the tumult, puſhed into the great cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
